He played 26 seasons in Major League Baseball, principally as a catcher, for 11 different major league clubs. His longest stretches were with the Washington Statesmen/Senators (901 games, 1892–99), Brooklyn Superbas (202 games, 1899–1901) and New York Highlanders (225 games, 1904–07). He played on Brooklyn teams that won National League pennants in 1899 and 1900. McGuire was the most durable catcher of his era, setting major league catching records for most career games caught (1,612), putouts (6,856), assists (1,860), double plays turned (143), runners caught stealing (1,459), and stolen bases allowed (2,529). His assist, caught stealing, and stolen bases allowed totals remain current major league records. During his major league career, he also compiled a .278 batting average, .341 on-base percentage, 770 runs scored, 1,750 hits, 300 doubles, 79 triples, 45 home runs, 840 RBIs and 118 stolen bases. His best season was 1895 when he caught a major league record 133 games and compiled a .336 batting average with 10 home runs, 97 RBIs and 17 stolen bases. McGuire was also the manager of the Washington Senators (1898), Boston Red Sox (1907–08) and Cleveland Indians (1909–11). He compiled a 210–287 (.423) as a major league manager. Early years McGuire was born in Youngstown, Ohio, in 1863. He moved as a boy to Cleveland, learned to play baseball \\"on the lots\\" of that city, and at age 18 was playing for the \\"Woodlands\\" team. As a young man, he moved to Albion, Michigan, where he worked as an apprentice in an iron foundry in Albion and played baseball on the weekend. Professional baseball player =Minor leagues= McGuire first gained note playing baseball for a team in Hastings, Michigan, where he was paired with pitcher Lady Baldwin. McGuire was reputed to be \\"the only catcher within a 50-mile radius who could handle\\" the left- handed Baldwin and his \\"incendiary fastball and sinuous curve, a so-called 'snakeball.'\\" At age 19, McGuire began his professional baseball career in 1883 with the Terre Haute, Indiana, club. =Toledo Blue Stockings= McGuire made his major league debut in June 1884 with the Toledo Blue Stockings of the American Association. He hit .185 in 151 at bats and appeared in 45 games. At Toledo, he shared the catching responsibilities with Moses Fleetwood Walker, the first African-American player in Major League Baseball. McGuire and Walker each caught 41 games for the Blue Stockings. The Blue Stockings finished in eighth place (out of 13 teams) with a 46–58 record and folded after the 1884 season. =Detroit Wolverines= McGuire began the 1885 season playing for the Indianapolis Hoosiers of the newly formed Western League. McGuire appeared in 16 games for the Hoosiers, who were the dominant team in the Western League, compiling an .880 winning percentage. In mid June 1885, the Western League disbanded, and a mad rush developed to sign the players on the Indianapolis roster, a line-up that included McGuire, Sam Thompson, Sam Crane, Chub Collins, Jim Donnelly, Mox McQuery, Gene Moriarty, and Dan Casey. Sam Thompson later told the colorful story of the Detroit Wolverines' acquisition of the Indianapolis players. Detroit sent two representatives (Marsh and Maloney) to Indianapolis, principally to sign the Hoosiers' battery of Larry McKeon and Jim Keenan. The Wolverines were outbid by the Cincinnati Reds for McKeon and Keenan but wound up with the Hoosiers' manager (Bill Watkins) and the rest of the team's starting lineup. The only catch was that a 10-day waiting period would allow other teams to outbid Detroit. Marsh and Maloney promptly sent the players to Detroit and quartered them in a hotel there. The next morning, the players were told that the team had arranged a fishing trip for them. The players boarded the steamship Annette and enjoyed the first day and night of successful fishing. After three days, the players became suspicious, but the ship captain laughed when asked when they would return to Detroit. As the players became mutinous on the sixth day, the captain admitted he had been ordered to keep them \\"out at sea\\" for 10 days. In another account, Thompson described his 10 days aboard the Annette as follows: > \\"We were prisoners, but well cared-for prisoners. Anything in the line of > creature comforts you could find packed away on ice. We lived on the best in > the market, and spent the rest of the time in fishing and playing poker, > chips having very thoughtfully been provided. On the night of the tenth day, > at midnight, we were all taken ashore where Watkins met us and signed us to > our contracts.\\"Fleitz, More Ghosts, p. 155. The players were only later presented with their accumulated mail which included scores of offers from other clubs. A writer in the Detroit Free Press later noted: \\"Detroit magnates showed some inside baseball brains and great finessing in sending the players away from all tempters for that period when they belonged to no club.\\" Once at Detroit, McGuire hit .190 in 121 at bats and served as the backup for catcher Charlie Bennett; Bennett caught 62 games and McGuire 31. While with the Wolverines, McGuire was reunited with Lady Baldwin, the \\"snakeball\\" pitcher who he had caught in Hastings. Despite the infusion of talent from Indianapolis, the Wolverines finished in sixth place with a 41–67 record. =Philadelphia Quakers= Gilbert & Bacon photograph of McGuire In November 1885, the Wolverines returned McGuire to league control, and he was then acquired by the Philadelphia Quakers in January 1886. McGuire played with the Quakers for two full seasons. In 1886, McGuire caught 49 games for the Quakers, two more than the team's other principal catcher Jack Clements. The 1886 season was McGuire's first in the major leagues with a winning ball club, as the Quakers finished in fourth place in the National League with a 71–43 record. In 1887, McGuire and Clements again split the catching duties for the Quakers, with 41 and 59 games, respectively. McGuire improved dramatically as a batter in 1887. After compiling a .198 batting average in 1886, McGuire hit .307 in 150 at bats. The team also improved to second place with a 75–48 record. McGuire began the 1888 season with the Quakers. However, on June 30, 1888, he was released by the Quakers after batting .333 in 12 games and 51 at bats. =Cleveland, Toronto and Rochester= On July 2, 1888, McGuire signed as a free agent with the Detroit Wolverines. He appeared in only three games for Detroit, had no hits in 13 at bats, and was released on August 1, 1888. In late August 1888, McGuire met and signed with Tom Loftus, the manager of the Cleveland Blues of the National League. The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported at the time: \\"He will strengthen the team a good deal, especially in batting. Jim was a little careless as to his condition early in the season and Harry Wright released him because he had three other cheaper catchers. . . . At this time he is in perfect condition and has given a fine sample of his work in the three games against Kansas City.\\" McGuire appeared in 26 games for Cleveland at the end of the 1888 season, batting .255 in 94 at bats. In early February 1889, McGuire was released by Cleveland and signed by the Toronto Canucks of the International League. McGuire appeared in 93 games for Toronto and hit .282 with 72 runs scored, 42 extra base hits and 29 stolen bases. (An account published at the end of the 1889 season stated that McGuire hit .300 at Toronto and caught 92 games). In February 1890, the Rochester Broncos of the American Association purchased McGuire from Toronto. In his return to the major leagues, McGuire appeared in 87 games for Rochester, 71 as a catcher, 15 at first base, three in the outfield and one as a pitcher. He hit .299 with a .356 on-base percentage, .408 slugging average and 53 RBIs. Prior to the 1890 season, McGuire had never earned a Wins Above Replacement (WAR) rating even as high as 1.0; his 1890 season received a 2.7 WAR rating. His defensive play also blossomed in 1890 with a 0.9 Defensive WAR rating – the only season in McGuire's long career in which he ranked among the top ten Defensive WAR ratings in his league. =The \\"Deacon\\"= In The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, sports historian Bill James wrote that McGuire was called Deacon, \\"because he didn't drink and carouse\\", like other players of his era. To the contrary, a biographical sketch of McGuire published in 1901 stated that McGuire had been a heavy drinker for much of his career, though he did later become a \\"teetotaler.\\" The sketch noted: > \\"McGuire's career, as will be noted, has been a somewhat checkered one and > not without its ups and downs. His downs, for the most part, were due to an > acquaintance he early formed with the Hon. John Barleycorn, and his > association with this noted gentleman led to frequent and divers bouts with > one Ben Booze who invariably gave Mac the worst of it and came near causing > his downfall. It was not until he quit these gentlemen entirely that the > true worth of the man permanently asserted itself and his flight into fame > was continued.\\" Another account, published in Sports Illustrated 1984, stated that McGuire's Brooklyn teammates gave him the nickname in 1900 because he was \\"so straight- arrow\\" and had never been fined or ejected from a game. Multiple accounts support the widely publicized claim that he was never fined or ejected from a game and describe McGuire as \\"placid, easy-going, hard-working and thoroughly conscientious.\\"(\\"McGuire was never fined or put out of a game by an umpire.\\") However, the origin of the \\"Deacon\\" nickname appears to date back to 1896. In February of that year, The Sporting Life, a national baseball newspaper, reported a dispatch from Michigan that McGuire \\"has experienced religion at a revival meeting and is thinking of giving up baseball and devote his time to preaching, perhaps.\\" The Sporting Life closed with this observation: \\" If Mac felt bent on doing missionary work his duty is to remain right where he is. But he will be back next April doing just as brilliant work behind the bat as last year. He will have no redress, however, if he is addressed hereafter as 'Deacon' McGuire.\\" =Washington Senators= McGuire on the cover of Sporting Life, June 1898 Deacon McGuire in Washington Senators uniform. Photographed by C. M. Bell studio In February 1891, McGuire jumped from the Rochester Broncos to the Washington Statesmen. He played the next nine seasons in a Washington uniform. During the 1891 season, McGuire appeared in 114 games for the Statesmen, including 98 as a catcher and 18 in the outfield. He compiled a .303 batting average and, with the boost from 43 bases on balls and 10 times hit by pitch, a .382 on-base percentage. For the second consecutive season, he earned a 2.7 WAR rating – a level he would exceed only once in his career. Focusing solely on offense, his Offensive WAR rating in 1891 was 3.3 – the only time he ranked among the top ten Offensive WAR ratings in his league. Defensively, McGuire led the American Association's catchers with 130 assists, 56 errors, 204 stolen bases allowed and 129 runners caught stealing. Despite McGuire's efforts, the Statesmen finished the 1891 season in last place in the American Association with a 44–91 record. In 1892, the Statesmen were admitted to the National League and renamed the Senators. The Senators finished the season in 10th place (out of 12 teams) with a 58–93 record. McGuire's batting average, ever erratic, dropped 71 points from the prior year to .232. However, McGuire had almost as many bases on balls (61) as hits (73), giving him a more than respectable .360 on-base percentage. Factoring in all of his contributions, McGuire received a 2.4 WAR rating for 1892. In 1893, McGuire caught only 50 games and, despite the limited playing time, ranked second in the National League's catchers with 27 errors. The 1893 season also generated McGuire's worst WAR rating (0.4) of the decade. The Senators as a team also suffered in 1893, finishing in 12th (last) place with a 40–89 record. The Senators rebounded only slightly in 1894, finishing in 11th place with a 45–87 record. McGuire, on the other hand, improved markedly. His batting average jumped 49 points to .306, and his WAR rating increased to 1.5. Defensively, he led the league with 278 stolen bases allowed and finished second among the league's catchers with 114 assists, 127 runners caught stealing, 36 errors and 27 passed balls. McGuire had the best season of his career in 1895 as he hit .336 with 48 extra bases hits (including 10 home runs), 97 RBIs and 17 stolen bases. His WAR rating of 4.0 was, by far, the highest of his career. Defensively, he set a new major league record by catching all 133 games. The Sporting News in October 1895 called McGuire's 133 games the \\"record of records\\": > Catcher Jim McGuire's correct record of League games caught in this season > is 133, 128 of which appear in the standing of the club, four were tie games > and one the postponed Boston game. He is to-day in excellent condition. This > is the record of records in the league, and many a year will roll by before > it is equaled.\\" He also led the National League's catchers with 312 putouts, 180 assists, 40 errors, 12 double plays turned, 28 passed balls, 293 stolen bases allowed, and 189 runners caught stealing. Even with McGuire having his best season, the Senators continued to wallow near the bottom of the National League, finishing the 1895 season in 10th place with a 43–85 record. In 1896, McGuire had another good season, and the Senators again finished near the bottom of the standings, in ninth place with a 58–73 record. McGuire hit .321, earning a 2.4 WAR rating. Defensively, he led the league's catchers in multiple categories for the second consecutive year, totaling 98 games at catcher (1st), 349 putouts (1st), 87 assists (2nd), 30 errors (1st), 14 double plays (1st), 205 stolen bases allowed (1st), and 97 runners caught stealing (2nd). The 1897 season was one of modest improvement for the Senators, finishing in sixth place with a 61–71 record. McGuire appeared in fewer games, 73 at catcher and six at first base, compiled a .343 batting average (the highest of his career), and earned a 2.5 WAR rating. In 1898, the Senators' improvement dissipated, as they finished in 11th place with a 51–101 record. McGuire appeared in 131 games for the Senators, 93 at catcher and 37 at first base. His batting average dropped by 75 points under the prior year to .268 with a WAR rating of 1.6. McGuire was also asked to serve as player-manager during the latter half of the 1898 season, compiling a record of 19–49 in the final 68 games of the season. By 1899, McGuire was 35 years old and the ninth oldest player in the National League. He began the year for the ninth consecutive season with an overmatched Washington team that finished in 11th place. During the first half of the season, McGuire's performance ebbed, earning a 0.8 WAR rating. =Brooklyn Superbas= McGuire as a player for Brooklyn On July 14, 1899, McGuire received good news; he had been traded to the Brooklyn Superbas, a team managed by Ned Hanlon and competing for the National League pennant. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle praised the trade: \\"McGuire has always been looked upon as one of the best catchers in the league . . . he has no superior as a coacher of pitchers and for steady and uninterrupted work.\\" The Washington correspondent for the Sporting Life wrote that the trade \\"marked the passing of the most consistent and reliable player that ever wore a Washington uniform\\" and called McGuire \\"the backbone of the Washington team.\\" Playing for a winning ball club for the first time in a decade, McGuire caught 46 games and blossomed. His batting average bounced back to .318 with a .385 on-base percentage, .446 slugging average and 1.4 WAR rating. The team finished strong with the addition of McGuire, compiling a 39–14 record after August 12 and winning the National League pennant by eight games. In 1900, McGuire shared catching responsibility with Duke Farrell, McGuire handling 69 games at the position and Farrell 76. McGuire compiled a .286 batting average, .348 on-base percentage and 1.2 WAR rating. His performance helped the Superbas win their second consecutive pennant with an 82–54 record. During one game in 1900, McGuire threw out seven runners attempting to steal second base, caught another \\"asleep on second and nipped still another slumbering off third.\\" McGuire resumed his role as the Superbas' number one catcher in 1901. He caught 81 games and compiled a .296 batting average, .342 on-base percentage and 1.6 WAR rating. The Superbas remained competitive, finishing in third place with a 79–57 record. =Challenging the \\"reserve clause\\"= In March 1902, McGuire jumped to the still new American League, signing a two-year with the Detroit Tigers. The Brooklyn club sued McGuire for breaching his contract to play there and sought an injunction prohibiting him from playing anywhere else. The case went to trial in June 1902 in Philadelphia federal court. Brooklyn club president Charles Ebbets testified in court \\"to the extraordinary qualities of McGuire as a catcher.\\" McGuire argued that his contract with Brooklyn was invalid on the ground that the \\"reserve clause\\" was a violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. After hearing the evidence, Judge George M. Dallas ruled in favor of McGuire, holding that the Brooklyn contract was unenforceable due to a lack of mutuality, and because Brooklyn had failed to prove that McGuire's services were unique and irreplaceable. Judge Dallas' opinion, in part, stated: > \\"The contract upon which this suit is founded provides that the party of the > first part (the plaintiff) may end and determine all its liabilities and > obligations thereunder upon giving the party of the second part (the > defendant) ten days' notice of its option and intention to do so, and in > Marble Company vs. Itipley, 10 Wall. 339, it was distinctly held that a > contract which the plaintiff may abandon at any time on giving one year's > notice is not enforceable in equity.... In short, I am of opinion that the > decision in Marble Company against Ripley is binding upon this Court and is > determinative of the present motion. A preliminary injunction should not be > awarded in any case where the proofs leave the mind of the Court in serious > doubt respecting the plaintiff's asserted right, and the testimony and > affidavits submitted for and against the present application do not > establish with reasonable certainty that the breach of contract of which the > plaintiff complains could not be adequately compensated at law. The evidence > adduced is by no means conclusive upon the question whether the services > which the defendant contracted to render were so unique and peculiar that > they could not be performed and substantially as well by others engaged in > professional ball playing, who might be easily be obtained to take his > place. The motion for a preliminary injunction is denied.\\"(quoting the > opinion of Judge Dallas) The Brooklyn correspondent for The Sporting News wrote that the court's decision did not change the fact that \\"McGuire played the Brooklyn management a low and cowardly trick\\", suggested that the team sue McGuire for damages, and opined that the Brooklyn public did not care \\"two cents whether McGuire never comes back.\\" In 1914, the McGuire case became a significant precedent that was relied upon by players and Federal League officials when that league sought to entice players to its ranks. =Detroit Tigers= With the legal proceedings at an end, McGuire shared catching responsibility in Detroit with Fritz Buelow, McGuire catching 70 games in 1902 and Buelow 63. The Tigers' management valued McGuire not only for his playing ability, but also because his coaching \\"was figured on to aid greatly in developing the young material\\" that the Tigers were bringing together. At age 38, McGuire was the fourth oldest player in the American League, his batting average dropped to .227 – his lowest level since 1886 ---, and his WAR rating fell to 0.7. The Tigers finished in seventh place with a 52–83 record. In February 1903, Ned Hanlon, manager of the Brooklyn club, claimed that Brooklyn still had the reserve rights to McGuire and challenged his contract with Detroit. Hanlon did not issue the threatened order to report for several weeks, then did so in April 1903. In the end, a deal was struck pursuant to which Brooklyn released any claim it had over McGuire. During the 1903 season, McGuire again shared catching duties with Buelow – 69 games for McGuire and 63 for Buelow. McGuire hit .250 and earned a 1.2 WAR rating. The Tigers finished in fifth place with a 65–71 record. =New York Highlanders= In February 1904, Detroit sold McGuire to the New York Highlanders. He spent his final years as a full-time player with the Highlanders from 1904 to 1906. In 1904, at age 40, McGuire caught 97 games, his highest tally since 1899. He led the American League's catchers with 11 double plays turned and ranked second in the league with 530 putouts and 120 assists. His batting average fell to .208, but with Willie Keeler batting .343 and Jack Chesbro winning 41 games, the Highlanders compiled a 92–59 and finished one-and-a-half games behind Boston for the American League pennant. In 1905, McGuire remained New York's number one catcher, appearing in 71 games at the position. He hit .219 and earned a 0.7 WAR rating. By 1906, McGuire, at age 42, was the second oldest player in the league. In his last season as a full-time player, he caught 51 games and hit .299 in 144 at bats. Manager and coach =Boston Red Sox= McGuire was hired by the Boston Red Sox in early June 1906 and took over as the team's manager on June 10, 1907. He compiled a 45–61 (.425) record as manager in 1907 and returned in 1908, compiling a 53–62 (.461) record. McGuire also appeared in seven games as a player for Boston, principally as a pinch-hitter, and made three hits, including a home run, and scored a run in five plate appearances. He was released by the Red Sox on August 28, 1908. Although McGuire's Boston teams did not achieve a winning record, his teams lacked batting strength. He had Cy Young as a pitcher, but his 1907 team finished with the lowest batting average (.234) in the American League. McGuire was credited with having \\"whipped the bunch of veterans and kids from tailenders into a fighting machine, laying the foundation for the whirlwind team\\" that went 88–63 in 1909. =Cleveland Naps= McGuire as manager at Cleveland On September 18, 1908, McGuire signed as a free agent with the Cleveland Naps and appeared in only one game, at first base. McGuire served principally as a scout for Cleveland in 1908 and the first half of 1909. On August 21, 1909, he was hired as Cleveland's manager, replacing Nap Lajoie. Club officials at the time opined that McGuire \\"possesses the necessary ginger to bring about a different style of playing.\\" McGuire led the team to a 14–25 (.359) record during the last weeks of the 1909 season. He returned in 1910 and led the team to a 71–81 (.467) record. In 1911, McGuire compiled a 6–11 (.353) record as Cleveland's manager. On May 3, 1911, he resigned as manager and was replaced by George Stovall. In resigning his post, McGuire stated that he was disappointed in the team's showing and hoped that better results could be achieved with a new man in charge. =Detroit Tigers= In February 1912, McGuire was hired as a pitching coach for the Detroit Tigers. He had been expected to serve as a scout during the regular season, but was assigned in May 1912 to remain with the club as a coach throughout the season, working alongside manager Hughie Jennings. The Sporting Life wrote: \\"With McGuire and Jennings on the coaching lines the Tigers would be better fortified in this department than any team in the league.\\" In May 1912, when the Detroit players refused to play in protest over the suspension of Ty Cobb for attacking a fan, the club's management was forced to come up with a substitute team for a game in Philadelphia. McGuire took to the field as one of the Tigers' replacement players. He had a hit and scored a run in his final major league game, but the Tigers lost the game by a 24–2 score. In January 1914, McGuire was assigned to coach Detroit's young pitchers during spring training with the understanding that he would then leave the club to assume \\"his regular duties as chief of scouts.\\" In 1915, he returned to the Tigers as a scout. In January 1916, Detroit president Frank Navin released McGuire from the position he had held with the club as a scout and coach. McGuire stated at the time that he expected \\"to devote all his attention to his business In Albion, Mich.\\" (Some accounts indicate that he continued to scout for the Tigers until 1926.) Legacy =Padding the glove= In 1936, H. G. Salsinger wrote an article that was published in The Sporting News crediting McGuire as the \\"first catcher to pad a glove.\\" Salsinger wrote that McGuire \\"resorted to a primordial method\\" by stuffing his glove with a piece of raw steak to absorb the shock. Salsinger wrote that manufacturers took a hint from McGuire and began padding catcher's mitts with felt and hair. Salsinger opined that modern catchers \\"should erect a monument\\" to repay the debt owed to McGuire's innovation. McGuire claimed he came up with the idea when he was catching for pitcher Hank O'Day at Toledo in 1884. McGuire said that O'Day \\"threw the heaviest and hardest ball I ever caught\\", and that O'Day's pitches \\"came like a shell from a cannon.\\" McGuire recalled: \\"The reinforced full-fingered catcher's glove had just come into use the year before. One day on my way to that old Toledo park on Monroe Street, I passed a butcher pounding round steak. It gave me an idea, and I went in and bought a lot of it. I put a piece of it in my glove at the start of every inning, and Hank's pitches beat that steak into a pulp.\\" McGuire's wife recalled her husband using \\"a piece of beefsteak\\" and noted: \\"At game's end it would be hamburger.\\" =Gnarled hands= McGuire's gnarled, knotted left hand, x-rayed in 1906 McGuire played before the advent of most modern protective equipment, and his fingers were reportedly \\"gnarled, broken, bent, split and crooked\\" by the end of his career. One account, published in 1901, emphasized the physical beating: > \\"A picture of McGuire's hands would be an interesting and wonderful exhibit. > The maimed and misshapen members which he will carry with him after he quits > the game and to the grave are mute reminders of many a foul ticked off the > bat, a wild thrown ball stopped with the finger tips after a leap into the > air, or a low one clawed up out of the roots of the plate, and an occasional > one caught full on the end of a digit, splitting the flesh and nail.\\" In 1904, former teammate Sam Crane called McGuire \\"a wonder – physically and mentally\\" and \\"a human octopus.\\" Crane also described McGuire's hands: > \\"His big, brawny, strong hands, now grotesquely disfigured by the continuous > battering they have received from the viciously wicked inshoots, curves, > slants and benders of the speediest pitchers known in the long history of > the game, have acted as an unflinchable barrier to the accumulation of > momentum that if concentrated would have an irresistible force capable of > crushing a battleship or of pulverizing a backstop construction of > Harveyized steel armor plate.\\" In 1907, newspapers across the country published an x-ray of McGuire's left hand (pictured, above at right), showing \\"36 breaks, twists or bumps all due to baseball accidents.\\"(available in LOC Chronicling America data base) The text accompanying the widely published photograph noted: \\"When the picture was developed the photographer was amazed to see the knots, like gnarled places on an old oak tree, around the joints, and numerous spots showing old breaks. In several joints the bones are flattened and pushed to the side.\\" =Career statistics and records= Despite the injuries and physical demands of a catcher's duties, McGuire showed remarkable longevity. In 26 years in the major leagues, McGuire compiled a .278 career batting average, .341 on-base percentage and .372 slugging percentage. He appeared in 1,781 games and totaled 770 runs scored, 1,750 hits, 300 doubles, 79 triples, 45 home runs, 840 RBIs, 118 stolen bases and 515 bases on balls. McGuire's longevity enabled him to set numerous major league records, some of which are set forth below: *Most seasons. McGuire played in 26 major league seasons. That remained a major league record for many decades. Tommy John tied the record in 1989, and Nolan Ryan exceeded it in 1993 when he appeared in his 27th major league season. *Most teams. McGuire played for 11 different major league teams. That stood as a major league record until 2000 when Mike Morgan played for his 12th major league team. *Caught stealing. McGuire still holds the major league records for most runners caught stealing in a season (189 in 1895) and in a career (1,459). *Stolen bases allowed. While McGuire threw out a lot of base runners, he also allowed a lot of stolen bases. He holds the current major league record for most stolen bases allowed in a season (293 in 1895) and in a career (2,529). *Assists as catcher. McGuire broke the record for most career assists by a catcher in 1901. His final total of 1,860 assists remains the current major league record. *Games as catcher. McGuire set both season and career records for games at catcher. He set the season record in 1895 when he appeared in 133 games, and he became the career leader in 1900 by breaking Wilbert Robinson's record of 1,108 games. His final tally of 1,612 games as catcher remained a major league record until it was broken in 1925 by Ray Schalk. *Putouts as catcher. McGuire broke the career record for putouts as catcher in 1901. His final total of 6,856 putouts remained the major league record until it, too, was broken in 1925 by Ray Schalk. *Double plays as catcher. In 1904, McGuire broke Chief Zimmer's record for most double plays turned as catcher. McGuire's final total of 143 double plays remained the major league record until 1920 when it was broken by Steve O'Neill. In The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, sports historian Bill James ranked McGuire as the 40th best catcher of all time. The only 19th century catcher ranked higher than McGuire was Buck Ewing, whom James ranked 17th. Family and later years McGuire was married in 1893 to May K.

By 1901, McGuire and his brother owned a \\"well paying wet goods emporium\\" and an ice business in Albion. The \\"wet goods emporium\\" appears to refer to a saloon in Albion known as \\"McGuire Brothers\\", originally located at 204 S. Superior St., which moved in 1912 to 103 West Porter Street. McGuire worked in the saloon during the off-season, and his brother (George) operated it year round. In 1915, Albion \\"went dry\\", and McGuire Brothers became a restaurant and \\"sample room\\" and eventually closed. In 1906, McGuire and his wife also purchased a flour mill on the Kalamazoo River near Albion. In 1914, a man who was believed to have gone insane twice attempted to kill McGuire. The first attempt was at McGuire's cabin in Duck Lake, Michigan, using both an axe and a revolver. The second attempt was at McGuire's home in Albion, using a repeating rifle. McGuire was reported to have narrowly escaped death. After retiring from baseball, McGuire returned to his home in Albion.

In 1901 he founded the Archives de psychologie with his cousin, Théodore Flournoy,R. Gregory ed., The Oxford Companion to the Mind (1987) p. 149 which he edited until his death. He was based from 1904 onward at the University of Geneva, where he became director of the experimental psychology lab.R. Gregory ed., The Oxford Companion to the Mind (1987) p. 149 Among the positions he held were: 1904 General Secretary at the Second International Congress of Psychology; 1909 General Secretary at the Sixth International Congress of Psychology; 1912 founder of the Rousseau Institute; Founder and President (1920-1940) of the Association Internationale de Psychotechnique (now the International Association of Applied Psychology); co-founder of the International Bureau of Education (IBE) in 1925; 1915-1940 professor of psychology at the University of Geneva in succession to Flournoy; Permanent Secretary at the International Congress of Psychology; Life President of the Comité de l'Association Internationale des Conferences de Psychotechnique. Claparède was married to Hélène Spir, daughter of the Russian philosopher African Spir. Trauma experiment Claparède performed an influential experiment demonstrating how the trauma of a painful event could be retained even if short term memory was lost.Claperede's Pinprick Experiment His experiment involved a woman who suffered from a form of amnesia. She had all of her old memories as well as her basic reasoning skills, but the recent past was not remembered. Claparède had greeted her every day, each time she could not remember his face at all. Then during one session of the experiment, Claparède hid a pin in his hand and reached to shake the woman's hand, pricking her. The next day, sure enough, she did not remember him. But when Claparède went to shake her hand, he found that she hesitated, recognizing a threat when her memory had been severely damaged.R.

These were developed in the United States in southern California, because of the climate. The first such facilities were all within the studio zone, often in the foothills of the San Fernando Valley, Santa Clarita Valley, and Simi Valley in the U.S. state of California. Movie ranches were developed in the 1920s for location shooting in Southern California to support the making of popular western films. Finding it difficult to recreate the topography of the Old West on sound stages and studio backlots, the Hollywood studios went to the rustic valleys, canyons and foothills of Southern California for filming locations. Other large-scale productions, such as war films, also needed large, undeveloped settings for outdoor scenes, such as battles. History To achieve greater scope, productions conducted location shooting in distant parts of California, Arizona, and Nevada. Initially production staff were required to cover their own travel expenses, resulting in disputes between workers and the studios. The studios agreed to pay union workers extra if they worked out of town. The definition of \\"out of town\\" was defined as a distance of greater than from the studio, or beyond the studio zone. To solve this problem, many movie studios purchased large tracts of undeveloped rural land, in many cases existing ranches, that were located closer to Hollywood. The ranches were often located just within the perimeter, specifically in the Simi Hills in the western San Fernando Valley, the Santa Monica Mountains, and the Santa Clarita area of the Greater Los Angeles Area. The natural California landscape proved to be suitable for western locations and other settings. As a result of post-war (WWII) era suburban development, property values and taxes on land increased, even as fewer large parcels were available to the studios. Los Angeles development was widespread, resulting in urban sprawl. Most of the historic movie ranches have been sold and subdivided. A few have been preserved as open space in regional parks, and are sometimes still used for filming. In addition, studios have developed movie ranches in other regions, such as New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. Below is a partial listing of some of the classic Southern California movie ranches from the first half of the 20th century, including some other and newer locations. Classic movie ranches =Apacheland Movie Ranch (Apacheland Studio)= A building in the area of the ranch, 2010 Located in the Apache Junction area of Phoenix, Arizona, the Apacheland Movie Ranch and Apacheland Studio was developed from 1959-1960 and opened in 1960. Starting in late 1957, movie studios had been contacting Superstition Mountain-area ranchers, including the Quarter Circle U, the Quarter Circle W, and the Barkley Cattle Ranch, for options to use their properties as town sets. One notable production during this time was Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957) with Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster. Though historically inaccurate, it features the area known as Gold Canyon, with the Superstitions prominent behind the movie's representation of the Clanton ranch. During this time, Victor Panek contacted his neighbors in Apache Junction, Mr. and Mrs. J.K. Hutchens, to suggest the idea of building a dedicated studio in the Superstition area. Hutchens and Panek found a suitable site that was developed into Apacheland, intended to be the \\"Western Movie Capitol of the World\\". Construction on the Apacheland Studio soundstage and adjacent \\"western town\\" set began on February 12, 1959 by Superstition Mountain Enterprises and associates. By June 1960, Apacheland was available for use by production companies and its first TV western Have Gun, Will Travel was filmed in November 1960, along with its first full-length movie The Purple Hills. Actors such as Elvis Presley, Jason Robards, Stella Stevens, Ronald Reagan, and Audie Murphy filmed many other western television shows and movies in Apacheland and the surrounding area, such as Gambler II, Death Valley Days, Charro!, and The Ballad of Cable Hogue. The last full-length movie to be filmed was the 1994 HBO movie Blind Justice with Armand Assante, Elisabeth Shue, and Jack Black. On May 26, 1969, fire destroyed most of the ranch. Only a few buildings survived, but the sets were soon rebuilt to accommodate ongoing productions. A second fire destroyed most of Apacheland on February 14, 2004. The causes of both fires were never determined. On October 16, 2004, Apacheland was permanently closed. The Elvis Chapel and the Apacheland Barn, both of which survived the second fire, were donated to the Superstition Mountain Museum. Each structure was partially disassembled at the ranch, moved by truck, and reassembled on the museum grounds, where both stand today. * = Big Sky Movie Ranch = Big Sky Ranch is a movie ranch located in Simi Valley, California. It has been widely used for the filming of Western television and film productions. Some of the past television episodes and productions filmed there include: Rawhide, Gunsmoke, Bonanza, Little House on the Prairie, Highway to Heaven, Father Murphy, The Thorn Birds, Jericho and Carnivàle. A fire in 2003 destroyed most of the standing sets, including a replica of the farm house from Little House on the Prairie and sets used in the TV series Gunsmoke and many movies. In 2019, the ranch's web site indicates that it is still available as a filming location, \\"with rolling hills and great vistas and .. with secluded canyons, undulating valleys and a grand mesa.

However, many of the earliest citations have turned out to be incorrect. For example, \\"The Squaw Man\\" is now known to have filmed a scene elsewhere in Chatsworth, a short distance southwest of the Iverson property, but did not film on the Iverson Ranch. By the late 1910s, what would become a long and fruitful association developed between Hollywood and the Iverson Movie Ranch, which became the go-to outdoor location for Westerns in particular and also appeared in many adventures, war movies, comedies, science-fiction films and other productions, standing in for Africa, the Middle East, the South Pacific and any number of exotic locations.https://books.google.ca/books?id=eXZXCAAAQBAJ&pg;=PT18&dq;=iverson+movie+ranch+history&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwj9tPWP16PkAhURy1kKHarvDW0Q6AEIODAC#v=onepage&q;=iverson%20movie%20ranch%20history&f;=false, Western Movie Making Locations Volume 1 Southern California Buster Keaton's Three Ages (1923), Herman Brix's Hawk of the Wilderness (1938), Laurel and Hardy's The Flying Deuces (1939), John Wayne's The Fighting Seabees (1944), and Richard Burton's The Robe (1953) are just a handful of the productions that were filmed at the ranch. The rocky terrain and narrow, winding roads frequently turned up in Republic serials of the 1940s and were prominently featured in chases and shootouts throughout the golden era of action B-Westerns in the 1930s and 1940s. For the 1945 Western comedy Along Came Jones, producer and star Gary Cooper had a Western town built at the ranch; this set was subsequently used in many other productions during the next 20 years. Hollywood's focus began to shift to the medium of television beginning in the late 1940s, and Iverson became a mainstay of countless early television series, including The Lone Ranger, The Roy Rogers Show, The Gene Autry Show, The Cisco Kid, Buffalo Bill, Jr., Zorro, and Tombstone Territory.http://employees.oxy.edu/jerry//iverson.htm oxy.edu. 'Iverson Movie Ranch: History, Filmography, vintage Photos.' access date: 5/15/2010. An estimated total of 3,500 or more productions, about evenly split between movies and television episodes, were filmed at the ranch during its peak years. The long-running TV western The Virginian filmed on location at Iverson in the ranch's later period, as did Bonanza and Gunsmoke. By the 1960s, the ownership of the ranch was split between two of Karl and Augusta's sons, with Joe Iverson, an African safari hunter married to Iva Iverson, owning the southern half of the ranch (the Lower Iverson) and Aaron Iverson, a farmer married to Bessie Iverson, owning the northern half (the Upper Iverson). In the mid-1960s the state of California began construction on the Simi Valley Freeway, which ran east and west, roughly following the dividing line between the Upper Iverson and Lower Iverson, cutting the movie ranch in half. That separated the ranch, and also produced noise, making the property less useful for movie-making. The waning popularity of the Western genre and the decline of the B-movie coincided with the arrival of the freeway, which opened in 1967, and greater development pressure, signaling the end for Iverson as a successful movie ranch. The last few movies that filmed some scenes here included Support Your Local Sheriff (1968) and Pony Express Rider (1976). In 1982, Joe Iverson sold what remained of the Lower Iverson to Robert G. Sherman who almost immediately began subdividing the property. The former Lower Iverson now contains a mobile home park, the non-denominational Church at Rocky Peak, and a large condominium development. The Upper Iverson is also no longer open to the public as it is now a gated community consisting of high- end estates along with additional condos and an apartment building. Part of the ranch has been preserved as parkland on both sides of Red Mesa Road, north of Santa Susana Pass Road in Chatsworth.https://www.google.com/maps/place/Garden+of+the+Gods/@34.2738846,-118.6140078,16.74z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c2833a43a9b9ff:0x78873beea0b5d6a8!8m2!3d34.2738758!4d-118.6111633, Garden of the Gods Map This section includes the famous \\"Garden of the Gods\\" on the west side of Red Mesa, in which many rock formations seen in countless old movies and TV shows are accessible to the public.https://mrca.ca.gov/parks/park-listing/garden-of-the-gods/, Garden of the Gods This includes the area on the east side of Red Mesa that includes the popular Lone Ranger Rock, which appeared beside a rearing Silver, the Lone Ranger's horse, in the opening to each episode of The Lone Ranger TV show.

It is commonly believed, though not the case, that Leave It to Beaver was filmed here, ('Beaver' actually filmed (first season) at CBS Studio Center - née Radford Studios and later at Universal Studios). The Waltons originally filmed on the Warner Bros. main lot where the recognizable house facade was located until it burned down in late 1991. A recreation of the Walton house was built on the Warner Bros. Ranch lot, utilizing the woodland mountain set originally utilized by Apple's Way, and later occasionally used by Fantasy Island TV shows. The facade remains and has been used in numerous productions such as NCIS, The Middle, and Pushing Daisies. On April 15, 2019, it was announced that Warner Bros. will sell the property to Worthe Real Estate Group and Stockbridge Real Estate Fund as part of a larger real estate deal to be completed in 2023 which will see the studio get ownership of The Burbank Studios in time to mark its 100th Anniversary. =Pioneertown= Pioneertown saddlery, 2009 Pioneertown, California, in the Morongo Basin region of Southern California's Mojave Desert in San Bernardino County, California.

Ltd. It is the largest cookware distributor in the United States and second largest in the world. The company was founded in 1981. Cookware labels or lines for which Meyer is the parent firm include Circulon, Anolon, the now defunct Steelon range, NapaStyle, SilverStone (under license from DuPont), Rachael Ray, Paula Deen, Cake Boss, Ruffoni, Ayesha Curry, Joe Wicks, Breville Cookware (under license from Breville Group), Prestige and BonJour. Meyer owns the license for cookware produced under the Farberware label in addition to producing private label cookware for Macy's and Sur La Table. The roots of the company began in Hong Kong with aluminum goods manufacturing and changed to cookware beginning in 1971 with the ascension of Stanley K. Cheng as CEO and chief inventor. The name of the firm is a transliteration of the Chinese words 'beautiful' (mei) and 'Asia' (yah). In 1972, the first line of cookware produced by Meyer was sold in London. Marketing distribution centers in Liverpool, England, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, were founded in 1976 and 1980, respectively. Meyer's cookware is manufactured and distributed internationally with factories in China, Thailand and Italy. Cookware lines are stainless steel, hard-anodized aluminum, and non-stick aluminum. The parent manufacturing firm is still based in Hong Kong while the distribution company moved to California in 1992. Revenues for the parent and subsidiary distributor were $287 million (US) for fiscal year 2005. In January 2018, Mitchell Loring retired as president of the company. Cookware innovations Meyer Corporation developed Circulon in 1984 with the innovation of non-stick cookware bonded to hard-anodized aluminum and tiny grooves in the interior that reduced abrasion of the Teflon surface. The \\"high-low food release system\\" was developed and patented by Stanley K. Cheng. The development of Anolon was to satisfy the marketplace which desired thicker gauge non-stick pans that were also dishwasher safe. The Anolon technology was not patented and was quickly incorporated by rivals into their own cookware lines.

Plot The film opens with an Orange walk on The Twelfth, and an audio tape being handed to Paul Sullivan (Dourif), an American human rights lawyer and activist, which becomes his death warrant. The film begins with a quote from Margaret Thatcher insisting that Northern Ireland is part of Britain. It ends with one from a former British intelligence agent, stating, \\"There are two laws running this country: one for the security forces and the other for the rest of us.\\" UK mainland police investigator Peter Kerrigan (Cox), with the help of Sullivan's assistant, Ingrid Jessner (McDormand), investigates the shooting death of Sullivan and his Provisional IRA driver by security forces in Northern Ireland. The investigation reveals the men were killed without warning. Captain Harris, an ex-army intelligence officer now in hiding, possesses a tape recording of senior military leaders and Conservative Party politicians discussing how they arranged the rise to power of Margaret Thatcher. Harris gives a copy of the tape to Jessner, after which British security forces kill Harris and blame his death on the IRA. Kerrigan is blackmailed into silence. Jessner has the tape, but without Harris to authenticate it, the recording can be dismissed as a forgery. Background The story references the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet in Chile, implying that British rule of Northern Ireland was sustained with terrorism equivalent to that which Pinochet inflicted upon his enemies; that the political ascent of Margaret Thatcher was like that of Pinochet, by means of a U.S.-sponsored coup d’état, not an election; and that police and right-wing politicians, who denounced the IRA as terrorists, were, themselves, engaged in state-sponsored terrorism. The implication that British state authorities are terrorists is reinforced with a scene in an Irish republican club of a singer singing a Wolfe Tones ballad honouring the H-Block hunger striker Joe McDonnell, including the chorus: The story of Hidden Agenda was inspired by the investigation into the Royal Ulster Constabulary's shoot-to-kill policy. The Peter Kerrigan character represents John Stalker, the leader of that investigation. The secret unit E4A of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which was believed involved in the assassinations, is briefly mentioned. The Captain Harris character represents Colin Wallace, who was a technical advisor to the film. The Chief Constable Brody character represents RUC Chief Constable Sir John Hermon. The right-wing Tory conspirators Andrew Neame and member of British Intelligence (MI5 or MI6) Alec Nevin claim Airey Neave was involved in similar intrigues during the 1970s. All three of these characters have the initials A.N although Airey Neave was killed in 1979 while the conspiracy in question was in 1974. In conversation with Kerrigan, a conspirator justifies breaking the law to fight terrorism, by citing the use of force to extort confessions from the Birmingham Six (which turned out to be false, and they were released in 1991, a year after the film's release). At one point, Teresa Doyle (Republican journalist Michelle Fairley) shows Jessnser a photograph of a masked British soldier posing with an IRA cadaver after a cross-border operation into the Irish Republic, representing a rumour that Captain Robert Nairac had such a trophy photograph of the body of John Francis Green. Cast * Frances McDormand as Ingrid Jessner * Brian Cox as Peter Kerrigan * Brad Dourif as Paul Sullivan * Maurice Roëves as Captain Harris * Ian McElhinney as Jack Cunningham * Mai Zetterling as Moa * Michelle Fairley as Teresa Doyle Production The production was originally set up at Columbia Pictures in 1987, when David Puttnam ran the studio. After Puttnam was ousted, Loach had to find new financial backing, and eventually found it with John Daly who ran Hemdale Film Corporation. Reception =Critical response= Hidden Agenda was praised for its honesty and complexity, as well as its resonance. It was criticised for a simplistic view of the Northern Ireland Troubles as an anti-colonial war and for portraying the Troubles as an adjunct to British rather than Irish politics. Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected 20 reviews and gave the film a score of 85%. =Awards= Hidden Agenda won the Jury Prize at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for Best European Film at the Goya Awards. At the Festival press conference, the Northern Irish critic Alexander Walker publicly denounced the film as IRA propaganda.

This method requires no pre- arrangement between the two systems. Opportunistic encryption can be used to combat passive wiretapping. (An active wiretapper, on the other hand, can disrupt encryption negotiation to either force an unencrypted channel or perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the encrypted link.) It does not provide a strong level of security as authentication may be difficult to establish and secure communications are not mandatory. However, it does make the encryption of most Internet traffic easy to implement, which removes a significant impediment to the mass adoption of Internet traffic security. Opportunistic encryption on the Internet is described in \\"Opportunistic Encryption using the Internet Key Exchange (IKE)\\", \\"Opportunistic Security: Some Protection Most of the Time\\", and in RFC 8164 \\"Opportunistic Security for HTTP/2\\". Routers The FreeS/WAN project was one of the early proponents of OE.History of OE The effort is continued by the former freeswan developers now working on Libreswan. Libreswan aims to support different authentication hooks for Opportunistic Encryption with IPsec. Version 3.16 released in December 2015 has support for Opportunistic IPsec using AUTH-NULLOpportunistic IPsec using AUTH-NULL which is based on . The Libreswan Project is currently working on (forward) DNSSEC and Kerberos support for Opportunistic IPsec. Openswan has also been ported to the OpenWrt project. Openswan used reverse DNS records to facilitate the key exchange between the systems. It is possible to use OpenVPN and networking protocols to set up dynamic VPN links which act similar to OE for specific domains. Unix and unix-like systems The FreeS/WAN and forks such as Openswan and strongSwan offer VPNs which can also operate in OE mode using IPsec based technology. Obfuscated TCP is another method of implementing OE. Windows OS Windows platforms have an implementation of OE installed by default. This method uses IPsec to secure the traffic and is a simple procedure to turn on. It is accessed via the MMC and \\"IP Security Policies on Local Computer\\" and then editing the properties to assign the \\"(Request Security)\\" policy. This will turn on optional IPsec in a Kerberos environment. In a non-Kerberos environment, a certificate from a certificate authority (CA) which is common to any system with which you communicate securely is required. Many systems also have problems when either side is behind a NAT. This problem is addressed by NAT Traversal (NAT-T) and is accomplished by adding a DWORD of 2 to the registry: HKLMSYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesIPsecAssumeUDPEncapsulationContextOnSendRule Using the filtering options provided in MMC, it is possible to tailor the networking to require, request or permit traffic to various domains and protocols to use encryption. E-mail Opportunistic encryption can also be used for specific traffic like e-mail using the SMTP STARTTLS extension for relaying messages across the Internet, or the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) STARTTLS extension for reading e-mail. With this implementation, it is not necessary to obtain a certificate from a certificate authority, as a self- signed certificate can be used. * RFC 2595 Using TLS with IMAP, POP3 and ACAP * RFC 3207 SMTP Service Extension for Secure SMTP over TLS * STARTTLS and postfix * STARTTLS and Exchange Many systems employ a variant with third-party add-ons to traditional email packages by first attempting to obtain an encryption key and if unsuccessful, then sending the email in the clear. PGP, p≡p, Hushmail, and Ciphire, among others can all be set up to work in this mode. In practice, STARTTLS in SMTP is often deployed with self-signed certificates, which represents a minimal one-time task for a system administrator, and results in most email traffic being opportunistically encrypted. VoIP Some Voice over IP (VoIP) solutions provide for painless encryption of voice traffic when possible. Some versions of the Sipura and Linksys lines of analog telephony adapters (ATA) include a hardware implementation of SRTP with the installation of a certificate from Voxilla, a VoIP information site. When the call is placed an attempt is made to use SRTP, if successful a series of tones are played into the handset, if not the call proceeds without using encryption. Skype and Amicima use only secure connections and Gizmo5 attempts a secure connection between its clients. Phil Zimmermann, Alan Johnston, and Jon Callas have proposed a new VoIP encryption protocol called ZRTP.ZRTP: Extensions to RTP for Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement for SRTP They have an implementation of it called Zfone whose source and compiled binaries are available. Websites For encrypting WWW/HTTP connections, HTTPS is typically used, which requires strict encryption and has significant administrative costs, both in terms of initial setup and continued maintenance costs for the website operator. Most browsers verify the webserver's identity to make sure that an SSL certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority and has not expired, usually requiring the website operator to manually change the certificate every one or two years. The easiest way to enable some sort of opportunistic website encryption is by using self-signed certificates, but this causes browsers to display a warning each time the website is visited unless the user manually marks the website's certificate as trusted. Because unencrypted websites do not currently display any such warnings, the use of self-signed certificates is not well received. In 2015, Mozilla started to roll out opportunistic encryption in Firefox version 37. This was quickly rolled back (in update 37.0.1) due to a serious vulnerability that could bypass SSL certificate verification. Browser extensions like HTTPS Everywhere and HTTPSfinder find and automatically switch the connection to HTTPS when possible. Several proposals were available for true, seamless opportunistic encryption of HTTP/2 protocol.Minimal Unauthenticated Encryption (MUE) for HTTP/2 These proposals were later rejected. Poul-Henning Kamp, lead developer of Varnish and a senior FreeBSD kernel developer, has criticized the IETF for following a particular political agenda with HTTP/2 for not implementing opportunistic encryption in the standard.  Weaknesses  STARTTLS implementations often used with SMTP are vulnerable to STRIPTLS attacks when subject to active wiretapping.

It was directed by Bruce Beresford and stars Glenn Close as Adrienne Pargiter, Frances McDormand as the brash Dr. Verstak, Pauline Collins as missionary Margaret Drummond (based on missionary Margaret Dryburgh), Julianna Margulies as U.S. socialite Topsy Merritt, Jennifer Ehle as British doyenne and model Rosemary Leighton Jones, Cate Blanchett as Australian nurse Susan McCarthy and Elizabeth Spriggs as dowager Imogene Roberts. Plot Basing his film on real events, Bruce Beresford tells the story of a vocal orchestra created by the women in a Japanese Internment camp, a classic survivors' tale about women's ability to survive hardship and atrocity through perseverance, solidarity and creativity. The film opens with a dance at Raffles Hotel in Singapore. Wives and husbands, soldiers and socialites are enjoying a night of dancing, libations, and conversation. The scene is happy and carefree, but the film continues to unfold and it soon becomes known that a war is raging right outside the doors. Paradise Road is set during the time of World War II, and the Japanese forces have just attacked Singapore. When a bomb explodes right outside the club, it becomes known that the Japanese have advanced beyond defensive lines. The women and children are immediately collected and carried off by a boat to a safer location. A few hours out, the boat is bombed by Japanese fighter planes and the women must jump over board to save their lives. Three women, Adrienne Pargiter the wife of a tea planter, Rosemary Leighton-Jones a model and the girlfriend of a Royal Malayan Volunteer, and Susan Macarthy, an Australian nurse, swim their way to shore. The place on which they land is the island of Sumatra. The women are found by a Japanese officer, Captain Tanaka, and ushered to a deserted village. They are then taken to a prison camp in the jungle. The three women are reunited with the rest of the women and children from the boat. At the prison camp, there are women of all nationalities including Dutch, English, Irish, Portuguese, Chinese, and Australian; and they all come from many levels of society. Some of the women are nuns, some are nurses, and some are socialites and mothers. The women are forced to bow to the Japanese officers and its flag. The women must endure torture and hard labour while trying to remain positive and level headed. Many believe the war would end soon and their husbands or soldiers will come looking for them. Nonetheless, the living conditions are brutal, and many face sickness and death. The women have been at the prison camp for two years now. Adrienne Pargiter, a graduate from the Royal Academy of Music, and Daisy \\"Margaret\\" Drummond a missionary, decided to create a vocal orchestra in order to encourage the women. Some of the women fear for their lives because the Japanese officers, especially Sergeant Tomiashi \\"The Snake\\", who is made known for his cruelty and abuse, have prohibited any meetings whether religious or social. The orchestra finally performs for the entire camp, even the officers stop to listen to the vibrant music. However, the music only works as motivation for so long and the women continue to dwindle in numbers. After some time, the women are moved to a new location where they will remain for the duration of the war. The war ends and the women rejoice for their freedom. The film closes on a scene of the last performance by the vocal orchestra. The vocal orchestra performed more than 30 works from 1943 to 1944. The original scores survived the war and are the basis for the music performed in the film. In 1997, many of the survivors were still alive during the making of the film and contributed to the inspiration for Paradise Road.

The 1965 book Song of Survival by Helen Colijn (granddaughter of Hendrikus Colijn), another camp survivor, is not listed in the film's credits as being a source for this film, although Colijn is thanked for her help in the credits. According to the media information kit for the film, Martin Meader and David Giles researched the story from 1991 and met with survivors from the camp and choir. Meader and Giles wrote the original screenplay, which was titled \\"A Voice Cries Out\\". Graeme Rattigan then joined Meader and Giles and together the three travelled the world, raising $8.275 million for the film. They met Beresford in London and he immediately became interested in the project. Together with Village Roadshow, Beresford took over the film, re-wrote the script and renamed the project Paradise Road. Beresford and producer Sue Milliken then did their own research of the story for over more than two years, by reading books and unpublished diaries on the subject and by interviewing survivors. Meader and Giles got a \\"Story by\\" credit, and with Rattigan, they all received a Co- Executive Producer Credit. Their company, Planet Pictures, received an \\"In Association With\\" credit. The film represents an alternative take on female imprisonment by the Japanese during World War II compared with BBC's dramatic offering from the early 1980s, Tenko. Some criticism of the film's historical accuracy is discussed in an article by Professor Hank Nelson. Fox provided $19 million of the budget with $6 million coming from Singapore businessman Andrew Yap. The role of Dr Verstak was originally offered to Anjelica Huston, who demanded more profit share than the filmmakers were willing to give, so Frances McDormand was cast instead. The part of Margaret Drummond was to be played by Jean Simmons but she had to withdraw due to illness; the studio wanted Joan Plowright but she accepted another offer and Pauline Collins wound up being cast. Fox were reluctant to cast Cate Blanchett in the lead as she was relatively unknown at the time but Beresford insisted.Milliken pp. 228-229. Production took place in Marrickville (Sydney), Singapore, Port Douglas and Penang. Historical context During World War II, many women became prisoners of war and faced a twenty to fifty percent death rate in Japanese prison camps. However, many women prisoners of war stories have been overlooked, with the exception of the women POWs of Sumatra. Thousands of British and Dutch colonists made the East Indies their home. Singapore was the most popular living option with the Raffles Hotel, shops, and beautiful houses, which attracted many soldiers and their wives. The Japanese armed forces attacked Pearl Harbor, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong on 7 December 1941. Europeans held the Japanese forces to an inferior level and put their trust in the British navy that guarded Singapore. But the Japanese advanced on British military lines, captured the British airfield, and dropped bombs on the city, which led to a retreat by the British forces. On 15 February 1942 the Japanese took Singapore. Due to the belief that the city was safe, many women and children had remained in Singapore when the city was attacked. The inhabitants of the city, including women and children, ran to board ships to flee the island. Some of these ships housed the women POWs of Sumatra. The \\"Vyner Brooke\\" contained 65 nurses from the Australian Army Nursing Service. It reached the Banka Strait before the Japanese attacked and released bombs over the ship. The women and children were forced to jump overboard to save their lives, but the Japanese continued to fire on the women in the water. The survivors swam ashore to Banka Island. One of the Australian nurses suggested the women and children to head toward a village on the island while the nurses remained on the beach to care for the men's wounds. When the Japanese discovered them, the men were rounded up and twenty-two of the nurses were forced back into the water where they were shot by the soldiers. Only Vivian Bullwinkel survived the open fire. Bullwinkel later found the rest of the nurses that survived the sinking of the ship. The women were transferred from Banka Island to Sumatra. Some survived the multiple voyages back and forth between the islands for three and a half years. The women were living in the Sumatra prison camp when the war ended and a rescue came for the survivors. Reception On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 45% approval rating, based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 5.84/10. On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 48 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

It is situated 10 km south of Dundalk, about 1 km inland from the Irish Sea coast. History The village was home to a monastery for hundreds of years, which was reputedly associated with Saint Patrick. The first bishop of Dromiskin was Lughaidh, son of Aengus mac Nadfraoch the first Christian king of Munster. St. Patrick reputedly pierced Aengus's foot with his pastoral staff during the baptism. Áed Findliath monarch of Ireland, son of Niall Caille, retired to and died at Dromiskin. The Chronicon Scotorum records his death at 879. O'Donovan records his death as 876 and the Annals of Ulster place it at 878. The next few hundred years would be turbulent times for Dromiskin. The constant plundering by both Viking and Irish would destroy the Abbey and disperse the monks. Annudh macRuaire rampaged through the territory in 1043http://www.ucc.ie/celt/online/T100005B/text015.html and Dromiskin was destroyed. The ecclesiastical site was abandoned and the monks took refuge in the neighbouring Abbey of Saint Mochta, the possessions of this ancient church being placed in the hands of the Prior of Louth Abbey. Dromiskin served as the home to the Archbishops of Armagh for a time. The Archbishops of Armagh lived at Dromiskin House. Archbishop Milo Sweetman is buried here. The old ninth century round tower and parts of the Abbey still remain. From the tower there is a view of all of Dundalk Bay and the surrounding countryside. Parish The village is part of the Darver and Dromiskin parish, Darver being a neighbouring village. The parish is bounded by the Fane River on the north and by the Glyde River on the south. Demographics Since the mid-1990s, Dromiskin, like many areas in County Louth, has seen an increase in population. In 2006, 992 people were living in Dromiskin.Central Statistics Office, Census 2006 (Volume 1, Tables 5 and 6) By 2016, the population of the village had increased to 1,195. According to 2016 census figures, 221 of the village's 391 private houses built between 1991 and 2010. Sport The local Gaelic football club, St. Joseph's, was formed in 1961. It covers the entire parish of Darver & Dromiskin, and won the Senior county championship (Joe Ward Cup) in 1996 and 2006. As of 2011, the club were playing Intermediate level championship as well as Division 2 league football, having been relegated from League Division 1 in 2010. The club's Minor (U-18) team won the county championship for the first time in 2009 and retained the championship in 2010. There is also an athletics club, St Peter's Athletic Club, based on the outskirts of the village. Transport Bus Éireann route 168, Annagassan to Dundalk serves Dromiskin Mondays to Fridays inclusive providing one journey in each direction.

Depending on the disease classification, the presentation may be at birth, or much later into adult life. Cystic disease may involve one or both kidneys and may, or may not, occur in the presence of other anomalies. A higher incidence of is found in males and prevalence increases with age. Renal cysts have been reported in more than 50% of patients over the age of 50. Typically, cysts grow up to 2.88 mm annually and may cause related pain and/or hemorrhage. Of the cystic kidney diseases, the most common is polycystic kidney disease with two sub-types: the less prevalent autosomal recessive and more prevalent autosomal dominant. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is primarily diagnosed in infants and young children while autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is most often diagnosed in adulthood. Another example of cystic kidney disease is Medullary sponge kidney. Types =More Cystic Kidney Diseases= Cystic kidney disease includes various conditions related to the formation of cysts in one or both kidneys. The most common subset is polycystic kidney disease (PKD) which is a genetic anomaly with two subsets, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Consequently, causation can be genetic, developmental, or associated with systemic disease which can be acquired or malignant. Examples of acquired cystic kidney disease include simple cysts and medullary sponge kidney (MSK). Other types of genetic cystic kidney disease include juvenile nephronophthisis (JNPHP), medullary cystic kidney disease (MCKD), and glomerulocystic kidney disease (GCKD). =Polycystic Kidney Disease= PKD causes numerous cysts to grow in the kidneys. These cysts are filled with fluid and if they grow excessively will lead to kidney damage. Mutations in genes PKD1 and PKD2 are responsible for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Those genes encode for polycystic proteins and mutations regarding those genes are inherited and responsible for the disorder of autosomal dominant cystic kidney disease. In the United States, more than half a million people have PKD, making it the fourth leading cause of kidney failure. PKD affects all races and genders equally and those with PKD have a possibility of developing cysts in other organs such as liver, pancreas, spleen, ovaries, and large bowel. Usually, these latter cysts do not impose a problem. Half of patients have no manifestation of symptoms, but symptoms may include: hematuria, back or abdominal pain, or the development of hypertension. The disease is usually manifested before age 30, and 45% develop kidney failure by age 60. Mutation in the HDK1 gene is currently thought to be responsible for autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), often diagnosed shortly after birth and usually before 15 years of age. Cause The site of preference for cyst development is the renal tubule. After growth of a few millimeters has occurred, the cysts detach from the parent tubule, this detachment induced by excessive proliferation of tubular epithelium or excessive fluid secretions. Diagnosis Diagnosis includes imaging with ultrasound, CT and/or MRI. The least expensive, non-invasive, and most reliable method is ultrasonography but smaller cysts may escape detection, while the resolution of CT and MRI will enable smaller cysts to be captured. However, the increased complexity and expense of CT and MRI is usually reserved for higher risk situations. MRI can be used to monitor the development of cysts and growth of kidneys. Genetic test can be applicable to those who have a family history of PKD but is expensive and fails to detect PKD in 15% of cases where it is present. = Antenatal scans = Many forms of cystic kidney disease can be detected in children prior to birth. Abnormalities which only affect one kidney are unlikely to cause a problem with the healthy arrival of a baby. Abnormalities which affect both kidneys can have an effect on the baby's amniotic fluid volume which can in turn lead to problems with lung development. Some forms of obstruction can be very hard to differentiate from cystic renal disease on early scans. File:Multicystic Dysplastic kidney.svgMulticystic dysplastic kidney - affects only one side; the other kidney is usually healthy. File:Cystic dysplastic kidney.svgCystic dysplasia - can affect one or both kidneys File:Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.svgAutosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease File:Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.svgAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease File:Posterior Urethral Valve.svgPosterior urethral valves - easily mistaken for cystic renal disease on early scans; appearances are due to obstruction not cysts File:Grade 5 Vesico Ureteric Reflux.svgHigh grade vesico-ureteric reflux - easily mistaken for cystic renal disease on early scans File:Severe pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction.svgPelvi-ureteric junction obstruction - easily mistaken for cystic renal disease on early scans Treatment The goal of treatment is to manage the disease and its symptoms, and to avoid or delay complications. Options include pain medication (except ibuprofen and other ‘non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAID’s)’ which may worsen kidney function), low protein and sodium diet, diuretics, antibiotics to treat urinary tract infection, or interventions to drain cysts. In advanced cystic kidney disease with renal failure, renal transplant or dialysis may ultimately be necessary. Prognosis By late 70s, 50-75% of patients with CKD require renal replacement therapy, either dialysis or kidney transplant. The number and size of cysts and kidney volume are predictors for the progression of CKD and end-stage renal disease. PKD does not increase the risk for the development of renal cancer, but if such develops, it is more likely to be bilateral. The most probable cause of death is heart disease, ruptured cerebral aneurysm, or disseminated infection. Some factors that can affect life expectancy are mutated gene type, gender, the age of onset, high blood pressure, proteinuria, hematuria, UTI, hormones, pregnancies, and size of cysts. If risk factors are controlled and the disease is stabilized then the patient's life expectancy can be prolonged greatly.

It opened the 2006 Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2006, and went into limited release in North America on April 7, 2006. Plot Olivia (Jennifer Aniston) is a single, cash-strapped woman working as a maid in Los Angeles in order to make ends meet. She is surrounded by a support network of well-off friends consisting of Franny (Joan Cusack) - a stay at home mom with a large trust fund; Christine (Catherine Keener) - a successful television writer; Jane (Frances McDormand) - a fashion designer; and their husbands. While the disparity in financial situations between Olivia and her friends creates some friction, each woman is facing her own individual struggles. Olivia can't seem to find love or money and resorts to questionable tactics to satisfy both. Franny's inheritance sometimes causes tension between her and her accountant husband, who likes to spend it. Christine's marriage is falling apart because she and her husband can't communicate effectively. Finally, Jane is becoming increasingly unpleasant to be around, possibly because of her discomfort with her age and her husband's sexual ambiguity. Together, these women attend charity benefits, have lunch, lean on each other, and wade their way through life.

K. Chang From Movable Type Printing to the World Wide Web Page 128 2007 \\"However, in 1418, another leader, Lê Lợi, staged an uprising, which led in 1428 to the establishment of the Lê dynasty, from which time Vietnam broke free of China and became independent.\\" Lê Lợi is among the most famous figures of Vietnamese history and one of its greatest heroes. Biography = Early life= Lê Lợi was the youngest of three sons. His father was an ethnic Kinh wealthy aristocratic nobleman in Lam Sơn (northern Vietnam). The town was in a newly colonized area of Vietnam which would eventually be called Thanh Hóa Province. Lam Son had been established by Lê Lợi's great-grandfather Le Hoi sometime in the 1330s. His exact date of birth is not certain, but 1384 is generally agreed upon by historians. Lam Son was on the frontier of Vietnam, and as a result it was further and hence more free from government control. This was a troubled time in Vietnam's history as the Hồ dynasty in 1400 finally displaced the Trần dynasty and set about reforming the empire. Hồ rule was short lived as members of the Trần dynasty petitioned for intervention from the Yongle Emperor of the Chinese Ming Empire to the north. He responded by sending a powerful army south into Vietnam and vanquished the Hồ. Upon failing to find a Trần heir, the Ming government chose to re-establish sovereignty over Vietnam, as was the case in the days of the Tang dynasty, some 500 years prior. The Ming government enjoyed some support from the Vietnamese, at least in the capital of Thăng Long, but their efforts to assert control in the surrounding countryside were met with stiff resistance. The Vietnamese claim that the Ming military stole valuable artifacts from Vietnam such as gems, jade, golden pieces of art as well as books. Lê Lợi himself said that he chose the path of revolt against China's brutal government when he personally witnessed the destruction of a Vietnamese village by Ming forces. = Revolt of 1418–1427 = Coins issued by the Lam Sơn 's National Liberation army Lê Lợi began his campaign against the Ming Empire on the day after Tết (New Year) February 1418. He was supported by several prominent families from his native Thanh Hóa, most famously were the Trịnh and the Nguyễn families. Initially, Lê Lợi campaigned on the basis of restoring the Trần to power. A relative of the Trần emperor was chosen as the figurehead of the revolt but within a few years, the Trần pretender was removed and the unquestioned leader of the revolt was Lê Lợi himself, under the name \\"Pacifying King\\" (Binh Dinh Vuong).Le Loi. The Encycloaedia Britannica. Micropedia, Volume VI, 15th Edition. Jiaozhi (northern Vietnam) when it was under Ming occupation (1407–1427) The revolt enjoyed patchy initial success. While Lê Lợi was able to operate in Thanh Hóa, he was, for 2–3 years, unable to muster the military forces required to defeat the Ming army in open battle. As a result, he waged a type of guerrilla war against the large and well organized Ming army. One famous story from this time is about the heroism of one of Lê Lợi's soldier, Lê Lai. One time during the revolt, Lê Lợi's forces had been surrounded by Ming forces on the top of a mountain. Lê Lai devised a plan that would allow Lê Lợi and the main bulk of the force to escape. He pretended to be Lê Lợi to divert the Ming army's attention by dressing himself in Lê Lợi's attire and lead a kamikaze-like charge down to attack the enemy. During the battle, Lê Lợi was able to escape.Le Loi – The Man and the Legend of the Golden Turtle God journeyfromthefall.com (copy at the Internet Archive) Besides fighting Ming forces, Lê Lợi and his army also had to fight against ethnic minorities' forces whom the Ming government bribed known collectively as Ai Lao (Laos) . Although there were many difficulties, Lê Lợi's army was able to suppress Ai Lao multiple times. However, because his force was not strong enough at the time, he had to lurk in the forests or mountains of Thanh Hoa province. Often due to lack of food supplies, Lê Lợi had to order the killing of army horses and elephants for use as food. In one particularly dangerous situation in 1422, Lê Lợi made peace with the Ming army. But in 1423 when his forces were built up better, Lê Lợi broke the peace agreement when the Ming army captured and killed his envoy. =Reaching South= By Nguyen Chich tactic, 1424 Lê Lợi decided to march his army to Nghe An plain. On the way, Lam Son army captured Da Cang fortress, beaten back Cam Banh forces, a commander who worked for the Ming. Lam Son forces attacked Tra Long garrison. Ming general Chen Zhi led reinforcement from Nghe An to Tra Long to rescue Cam Banh but was beaten back by Lam Son forces. Besieged by Lê Lợi, with Chen Zhi unable to rescue, Cam Banh eventually surrendered. Lê Lợi sent Dinh Liet with a detachment to attack Nghe An, and the same time he took the main part of the army. Zhen Zhi was repeatedly defeated and had to retreat inside the Nghe An citadel. Li An, Fang Zheng from Dong Quan came to Nghe An to rescue Chen Zhi, while Chen also moved out his forces from the castle to join force with them. However the Ming forces were defeated, Chen Zhi had to retreat to Dong Quan, An and Chinh withdraw in Nghe An citadel. In May 1425, Lê Lợi commanded Dinh Le to attack Dien Chau. Ming army lost and retreated to Dong Do (Thanh Hoa). Then Lê Lợi also sent Le Sat, Le Nhan Chu. Le Trien supported Dinh Le for attack Tay Do, Ming army must retreat inside the castle. Lê Lợi on one hand surrounded Nghe An and Tay Do, and on the other hand sent Tran Nguyen Han, Doan No, Le Da Bo to attack Tan Binh, Thuan Hoa. Ming general Nham Thang was defeated. Then Lê Lợi sent Le Ngan, Le Van An to support Tran Nguyen Han. Ming army had to retreat. As a result of these victories, from the end of 1425, Lê Lợi was in control all land from Thanh Hoa to the south, and besieged all the Ming's forces in the region. =Tốt Động – Chúc Động Victory= On 1426 August, Lê Lợi divided his grand army into 3 parts. Pham Van Xao, Do Bi, Trinh Kha, and the expert swordsman Le Trien went North west, while the feared Luu Nhan Chu, and wise Bui Bi headed North East. The cavalry commander Đinh Lễ, and trusted lieutenant Nguyễn Xí moved on Dong Quan. From the wilderness, Le Trien approached Dong Quan, when he ambushed Tran Tri and defeated Tri. Meanwhile, a Ming army was incoming from Yunnan. Trien divided forces and sent Pham Van Xao, and Trinh Kha on a route to intercept, and combined Doanh Le, and Nguyen Xi, into a siege army to attack Dong Quan. Pham Van Xao defeated the Yunnan reinforcements. Van Nam forces fled and entrenched at the Xuong Giang rampart. Tran Tri's supply lines were threatened, and he sought Ly An reinforcements at Nghe An. Ly An, and Phuong Chinh commanded Thai Thuc to the keep Nghe An rampart, and sent forces to rescue Dong Quan. Lê Lợi commanded Le Van An's elite troops to surrounded the rampart, while he himself moved the main forces to the north. The Ming Emperor sent Wang Zong, and Ma Ying to the rescue. They combined all available Dong Quan forces and became 100,000 strong, then began a drive to Phuong Chinh. Le Trien and the infamous thief Do Bi defeated Ma Qi at Tu Liem, and attacked Fang forces headlong. Fang and Ma fled and combined with the Wang Zong forces at Co So. Le Trien attacked Wang, but he had already prepared. Thien lost, retreated back to Cao Bo and sought help from Nguyen Xi. Dinh Le, Nguyen Xi took their forces to Tot Dong Chut Dong to prepare an ambush. They know Wang Zong would divide forces into two parts and raid Le Trien, so they enticed Wang to place an ambush force. Wang's army lost heavily, with Tran Hiep, Ly Luong and 50,000 soldiers killed, and 10,000 captured. fled and entrenched at Dong Quan. Lê Lợi got the victorious news and then sent Tran Nguyen Han and Bui Bi to divide forces, and drive two ways towards Dong Quan. =Made Tran Cao Emperor= Vuong Thong was lost. Lê Lợi wanted Ming forces to withdraw fast. Meanwhile, court scholars found the reason the Ming government wanted to help the Tran enemies defeat Ho, and sent to Lê Lợi a proclamation made which Tran descendants to become Emperor. Vuong Thong agreed to the mutual agreement in outward appearance, but knew Lê Lợi held a plan up his sleeve. After Lê Lợi showed his hand, Vuong Thong made his move and broke the agreement. =Siege of Dong Quan fortress= After a break in mutual agreement, Lê Lợi sent some generals to attack and occupy key forts such as: Dieu Dieu, Tam Giang, Xuong Giang. They were occupied soon after. At the beginning of 1427, he moved his troop to Nhi river, and attacked Dong Quan. Lê Lợi created strict troop rule to assure the people that his troops would not be a threat to them. Ming general Thai Thuc surrendered and handed over Nghe An. Lê Lợi demand foreign minister Nguyễn Trãi write a letter, insisting others generals to surrender. When Lam Son's garrison force at Dong Quan appeared weak, Ming cavalry attacked suddenly. Le Trien died at Tu Liem. Dinh Le. Nguyen Xi was captured at Thanh Tri. After that Dinh Le was killed, Nguyen Xi fled. =Chi Lang Xuong Giang Victory= At the end of 1427, the Ming Emperor sent reinforcements to rescue Vuong Thong. Lieu Thang took 100,000 soldiers from Guangxi; Moc Thanh with 50,000 ones from Yun Nan. They were generals who participated in the battle with Ho and Tran dynasty. According to some historians, 150,000 soldiers were magnified in number; in fact, the number was 120,000 and the main forces belonged to Lieu Thang. Having heard this information, Lê Lợi and the generals wanted to attack and occupy Dong Quan immediately. However they listened to Nguyễn Trãi's advice, attacking rampart was a bad solution because the Ming forces in the rampart were so crowded and food was full. So Lê Lợi and generals decided to attack reinforcements first to discourage Ming forces at Dong Quan. At first, Lê Lợi commanded the residents be moved Lạng Giang, Bắc Giang, Quy Hoa, Tuyên Quang to segregate Ming troops. He knew Lieu Thang kept the main forces, so he sent Le Sat, Le Nhan Chu, Le Van Linh, Dinh Liet to wait at Chi Lang, and at the same time commanded Le Van An, Le Ly to take alternative forces to support. With Moc Thanh's forces, he knew Thanh was an experienced general and will be waiting for Lieu Thang's results before taking actions, so Lê Lợi commanded Pham Van Xao and Trinh Kha entrenched all time. The border general, Tran Luu, faked losing and ran away from Nam Quan gate to Luu gate and then moved to Chi Lang. On 18 September at lunar calendar, Thang followed Chi Lang. Thinking Tran Luu had lost continuous, Thang was too optimistic and took 100 cavalries to come after. On 20 September, Thang was killed by Tran Luu and Le Sat ‘s forces and they shed all the remaining troop. All Lê Lợi's generals got the opportunity and attacked Minh troops, killed 10,000 soldiers, cut Luong Minh, Ly Khanh committed suicide. Some remain Ming generals such as Hoang Thuc, Thoi Tu tried to retreat at Xuong Giang but they came there and knew the rampart was occupied. They were forced to gather troops in empty field. Lê Lợi sent Tran Nguyen Hang to block Ming's food transporting way, sent Pham Van, Nguyen Xi supported Le Sat and get close to attack, killed 50,000 Ming soldiers at Xuong Giang. Hoang Thuc with 30,000 Ming soldiers were arrested; Thoi Tu did not surrender and was killed. More than 70,000 Ming soldiers were killed or captured along Lang Son. Moc Thanh heard Lieu Thang was killed so he retreated and ran away. Pham Van Xao and Trinh Kha followed, killed 10,000 soldiers, arrested 1,000 ones and horses.Nola Cooke, Tana Li, James Anderson The Tongking Gulf Through History Page 15 2011 \\"... forced to withdraw by Lê Lợi's victorious Thanh Hóa-based army.\\" = Founding of the Lê dynasty = Temple in Lê Thái Tổ's burial tomb in Thanh Hóa In 1427, after 10 years of war, Vietnam regained its independence and the Ming Empire officially acknowledged Vietnam as an independent state. Lê Lợi took the throne and was declared Emperor of Đại Việt (大越). According to a Ming report, Le Bi (黎秘), the chief eunuch of Lê Lợi and 10,000 Vietnamese were killed after Ming forces crushed and defeated their invasion in 1427 of a Chinese town.Tsai (1996), p. 15 Lê Lợi's proclamation of independence reflected the Sino-Vietnamese tensions as well as Vietnamese pride and patriotism: The Vinh Lang stele from Lê Lợi's mausoleum, erected in the 6th year of Thuận Thiên reign (1433) Lê Lợi formally established the Lê dynasty as the Xuande Emperor of the Ming Empire officially recognized Lê Lợi as the new ruler of Vietnam. In return, Lê Lợi sent diplomatic messages to the Ming imperial court, promising Vietnam's loyalty as a vassal state of China and cooperation. The Ming imperial court accepted this arrangement, much as they accepted the vassal status of Korea under the Joseon dynasty. The Chinese largely left Vietnam alone for the next 500 years, intervening only about once every hundred years. Lê Lợi embarked on a significant reorganization of the Vietnamese government, clearly based on the Confucian system of government which was developed by the Chinese Tang and Song dynasties. He also elevated his longtime comrades and generals such as Nguyễn Trãi,Burke Origines \\"Nguyễn Trãi is best known, however, as the military strategist who assisted Lê Lợi in driving Ming forces out of Vietnam between 1407 and 1427. From these experiences he drew the inspiration to write Bình Ngô Đại Cáo, Proclamation of Victory over the Minh Invaders. Upon the death of Lệ Lợi (King Lê Thái Tổ)...\\" Tran Nguyen Han, Lê Sát, Pham Van Sao, and Trịnh Khả to high official rank. The Le government rebuilt the infrastructure of Vietnam: roads, bridges, canals. Land distribution were rewarded to soldiers that contributed in the war against the Ming Empire. New money currency was minted and new laws and reforms were passed. The system of selecting government administrators by examination was restored and exams were held at regular intervals throughout Lê Lợi's reign. From 1430 to 1432, Lê Lợi and his army fought a set of campaigns in the hills to the west of the coastal area. Then, in 1433, he became sick and his health declined. On his deathbed he appointed Lê Sát as the regent for his second son, who would rule after him as Lê Thái Tông. Internal palace politics quickly decimated the ranks of Lê Lợi's trusted counselors, Trần Nguyên Hãn committed suicide when he was being taken to the capital for investigating his suspected betrayal, Phạm Văn Xảo was executed in 1432 and Lê Sát, who ruled as regent for five years, was executed in 1438. Nguyễn Trãi was killed in 1442 (it was claimed he was involved in or responsible for the death of Lê Thái Tông). Only Trịnh Khả survived to an old age and even he was executed in 1451.  Myths and legends  Water puppet of Lê Lợi on the Lake of the Returned Sword The Lake of the Returned Sword in Hanoi is where Lê Lợi returned the sword to the Golden Turtle, according to the legend. Many legends and stories were told about Lê Lợi. The most famous story concerns his magical sword. Much like King Arthur and his sword Excalibur, Lê Lợi was said to have a magic sword of wondrous power. One story tells that he obtained the sword, inscribed with the words 'The Will of Heaven' (Thuận Thiên) from the Dragon King (Vietnamese: Long Vương), a demi-god to the local people, who decided to lend his sword to Lê Lợi. But there was a catch: the sword did not come straight to him in one piece. It was split into two parts: a blade and a sword hilt. First, in Thanh Hóa province, there was a fisherman named Lê Thận, who was not related to Lê Lợi in any way. One night, his fishing net caught something heavy. Thinking of how much money he would get for this big fish, he became very excited. However, his excitement soon turned into disappointment when he saw that his catch was a long, thin piece of metal which had somehow become entangled to the net. He threw it back into the water, and recast the net at a different location. When he pulled the net in, the metal piece had found its way back into the net. He picked it up and threw it far away with all its strength. The third time the fishing net came up, the same thing happened, the metal piece was once again caught in the net. Bewildered, he brought his lamp closer and carefully examined the strange object. Only then did he notice that it was the missing blade of a sword. He took the blade home and not knowing what to do with it, put it in the corner of his house. Some years later, Lê Thận joined the rebel army of Lê Lợi, where he quickly rose in ranks. Once, the general visited Lê Thận's home. Lê Thận's house lacked lighting, so everything was dark. But as though it was sensing the presence of Lê Lợi, the blade at the corner of the house suddenly emitted a bright glow. Lê Lợi held up the blade and saw two words manifesting before his very eye: Thuận Thiên (Will of Heaven). With Lê Thận's endorsement, Lê Lợi took the blade with him. One day, while on the run from the enemy, Lê Lợi saw a strange light emanating from the branches of a banyan tree. He climbed up and there he found a hilt of a sword, encrusted with precious gems. Remembering the blade he found earlier, he took it out and placed it into the hilt. The fit was perfect. Believing that the Heaven had entrusted him with the great cause of freeing the land, Lê Lợi took up arms and rallied people under his banner. For the next few years, the magic sword brought him victory after another. His men no longer had to hide in the forest, but aggressively penetrated many enemy camps, captured them and seized their granaries. The sword helped them push back the enemy, until Vietnam was once again free from Chinese rule. Lê Lợi ascended the throne in 1428, ending his 10-year campaign, and reclaimed independence for the country. The stories claim Lê Lợi grew very tall when he used the sword and it gave him the strength of many men. Other stories say that the sword blade and the sword hilt came together from different places, the blade fished out of a lake, the hilt found by Lê Lợi himself. The stories largely agree on what happened to the sword: One day, not long after the Chinese had accepted Vietnam as independent, Lê Lợi was out boating on a lake in Hanoi. The golden turtle advanced toward the boat and the king, then with a human voice, it asked him to return the magic sword to his master, Long Vương (Dragon King), who lived under the water. Suddenly it became clear to Lê Lợi that the sword was only lent to him to carry out his duty, but now it must be returned to its rightful owner, lest it corrupt him. Lê Lợi drew the sword out of its scabbard and lobbed it towards the turtle. With great speed, the turtle opened its mouth and snatched the sword from the air with its teeth. It descended back into the water, with the shiny sword in its mouth. Lê Lợi then acknowledged the sword had gone back to the Long Vương (Dragon King) and caused the lake to be renamed 'The Lake of the Returned Sword' (Hoan Kiem Lake) located in present- day Hanoi. Countless poems and songs were written about Lê Lợi, both during his lifetime and in later years. Lê Lợi is looked upon as the perfect embodiment of the just, wise, and capable leader. All future Vietnamese kings were measured against the standard of Lê Lợi and most were found wanting.Education As a Political Tool in Asia - Page 147 Marie-Carine Lall, Edward Vickers - 2009 \\"New heroes enter the national pantheon, first of all King Lê Lợi and the cultured Nguyễn Trãi who defeated the Chinese in 1427.\\"Van Dao Hoang Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang: A Contemporary History of a National ...

He was a physician before he became archbishop, one of the earliest great doctors of the Schola Medica Salernitana. As a translator, Alfanus was well-versed in both Latin and Arabic and he translated many manuscripts from the latter into the former. His interest in medicine and the translation of Arabic treatises on the subject led him to invite Constantine the African from Carthage (in what is now Tunisia) to Salerno to assist him. Constantine brought with him a library of Arabic medical texts which he commenced to translate into Latin. In 1076, Robert Guiscard laid the foundations for the new Salerno Cathedral.

One segment would run from Las Vegas to Primm, Nevada, with proposed service to the Las Vegas area's forthcoming Ivanpah Valley Airport. The top speed would be . Though $45 million was appropriated in 2005 for the planning phase for the first segment, the money was never spent, and was finally reallocated to a highway project in a Las Vegas Airport in June 2010. The maglev project was not in the 2012 transportation plan under consideration by the Southern California Association of Governments. Removing it from the plan means that the project cannot receive federal funds, even for studies. The Southern California Association of Governments did leave a small portion of the route – from Anaheim to Ontario – in their 2012 transportation plan. American Magline Group, working with the California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission, has received most of the government funds released so far. The German consortium famous for the Shanghai Maglev Train, Transrapid International, has performed some research into it as well; hoping to demonstrate its technology in a long-distance route. In August 2014 the backers of the scheme were seeking to revive interest in the proposal. In October 2018 it was reported that the LA-LV maglev project was over in 2012. In September 2019, it was reported that Virgin Trains USA, formerly known as Brightline, intended to begin construction in the first half of 2020 of a competing non-maglev route between Victor Valley and Las Vegas. History In the late 1970s and 1980s, Nevada politicians talked of a \\"bullet train\\" to connect Southern California to Las Vegas. Since the 1997 termination of the Amtrak-run Desert Wind, Las Vegas has been without any passenger train service. Plans to resume service using a Talgo train have failed to gain traction due to the high cost of upgrades to the existing track, much of it being only a single track as of 2006. With McCarran International Airport expected to reach capacity in a few years and I-15 upgrades for more lanes an ongoing project, an alternative mode of transportation between Southern California and Las Vegas is considered important by many transportation planners . As a result, a maglev train was proposed in the late 1990s. Operating on a dedicated track, it would not be subject to delays from freight trains, a problem that plagued the old Amtrak service. As a high-speed service, it would be able to compete with airlines for passengers, especially from the outlying areas of Southern California. Funding allocated to date: * $1 million on December 8, 2004 in the 2005FY appropriation bill. * $45 million (later withdrawn) for planning in the 2006FY Federal appropriation bill for the Las Vegas to Primm segment. The money was redirected to a highway project at McCarran International Airport.* The maglev project's cost has recently been estimated to be around $12 billion. In June 2010 it lost key support from Senator Harry Reid, who then stated support for the privately financed Desert Xpress (later Brightline West) project. The availability of these funds for the Maglev project were withdrawn at the direction of Reid by language contained the Federal \\"Jobs Bill\\" passed in March 2010. In a press release, the Senator claimed the Maglev Commission had failed to raise the required matching funds of 20%; a claim subsequently disputed by American Magline Group President Neil Cummings, who reported raising $10 million. Reid then noted that commission had \\"failed to complete an environmental impact statement\\", the value of which was counted as part of the \\"$10 million\\" in matching funds claimed to have been raised by the Magline Group, despite the statement being unfinished. The project's technology also remains controversial among rail enthusiasts since it is untried in the United States. The application for $83 million was filed by the California-Nevada Super Speed Commission, but according to the federal department, \\"only states, groups of states, interstate compacts, and public agencies established by one or more states\\" were eligible. While the Super Speed Train Commission is ostensibly a bi-state body, there is a wrinkle, a senior Transportation Department official said.

It would be the first album from the band on the Island label, and the last to feature Joe Boyd as the producer.Whitburn, Joel; Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Albums, 1955-1996; p. 366. Background =Recording= Recording of the album and soundtrack came during a transitional period for the band. Tracks were completed during Wee Tam and the Big Huge and I Looked Up sessions. As a result, the girlfriends Licorice McKechnie and Rose Simpson are more involved in some tracks in comparison to others. Even the compositions themselves reflect differentiation from the dream-like folk pieces to the less experimental contemporary ones that are more similar to Liquid Acrobat as Regards the Air. The whole B-side of the album is instrumentals that were the soundtrack of the documentary. They appear in the film to set mood to significant scenes. Three additional tracks were added from the Wee Tam sessions that did not make it to the album to have a completed LP. Joe Boyd stated the whole development was \\"a kind of clear out the cupboard thing\\".Be Glad: An Incredible String Band Compendium (167-168) =The documentary = The documentary film was released in July 1970 and was based on the members of The Incredible String Band. The film is broken down into two parts. Part one featured stage performances and interviews of the band with the intent of learning about the group's thought process and way of living. Part two involves the group with friends dressing up to create a short, 20-minute drama play called The Pirate and The Crystal Ball. Filming began as early as a March 1968 Royal Festival Hall concert, and was budgeted by Ominibus for what they expected to be a straightforward documentary. Since there was limited camera angles, the concert was broken down into brief clips of pre-selected segments. After concert segments of material including \\"Mercy I Cry City\\" and \\"A Very Cellular Song\\", brief questioning is taken up by reporters. On one particular intense, regarding the meaning of their music, Heron responds, \\"If I could describe my songs I wouldn't sing them\\".Be Glad: An Incredible String Band Compendium (156) Then, extensive interviews are conducted at the group's communal home in Glasgow along with clips of their daily lives. Finally, was the fable drama designed by the band, which was completed in one weekend. A basic-storyline included a pirate attempting to steal a crystal ball from three fates (Simpson, McKechnie, and Schofield). The fates enlist a hunter (Maistre) to set matters right, and the hunter captures the pirate to be judged by two Gods (Williamson, Heron). In the end, the pirate is forced into an endless reincarnation cycle. A collage of psychedelic images relating to the pirate's past begin and end with the sound of a baby's cry, concluding the fable.Be Glad: An Incredible String Band Compendium (154-155) Track listing Side one Side two Personnel * Robin Williamson - bass, claves, fiddle, finger cymbals, gimbri, guitar, keyboard, mandolin, piano, sarangui, shakers, violin, vocals * Mike Heron - bass, chimes, glockenspiel, guitar, harp, horn, keyboard, organ, sitar, vocals * Licorice McKechnie - backing vocals, keyboard, violin * Rose Simpson - backing vocals, bass, percussion References The Incredible String Band albums Albums produced by Joe Boyd 1970 soundtrack albums Film soundtracks Island Records soundtracks ","title":"Be Glad for the Song Has No Ending"},{"id":"4299684","text":"René Simard, (born October 4, 1935) is a Canadian physician, cancer researcher and university administrator.

Pavel Pavel studied electrical engineering at the university in Plzeň and later worked as a design engineer in Agrostav Strakonice. Solving how the ancient people could move megalithic statues and stone blocks became his hobby for which he became known. He began this line of inquiry as a child, when he became worried he may inadvertently be transported back in time and charged with moving heavy objects.http://www.czsk.net/svet/clanky/osobnosti/pavel.html After the Velvet revolution (1989), Pavel became involved in local politics as a member of the Civic Democratic Party. He ran in two elections for the Czech Senate (in 2002 and again in 2003) finishing second. Since 1990 Pavel has worked in the field of heavy transportation, founding his company PAVEL PAVEL s.r.o. in 2000. – short history of the company, in Czech. Experimental archaeology Inspired by Thor Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki, Pavel Pavel set out to demonstrate how the monolithic Moai of Easter Island might have been moved into place by a small number of people using only rudimentary technologies. He conducted a practice experiment in 1982 in south Bohemia using a concrete model (4.5 m, 12 tonnes). In 1986 he was invited by Heyerdahl to Easter Island to test his experiment in its actual setting, where he successfully replicated the experiment. Only 16 people with one leader were needed for relatively fast statue transportation., Articles by Thor Heyerdal, Arne Skjolsvold and Pavel Pavel about the moai experiments. He then performed some further experiments. He and five assistants using only wooden sledges erected and moved a 30-ton rocking stone at the village of Kadov (in Strakonice District) to its original location, from where it had been removed in the 19th century by unknown vandals.http://www.pavelpavel.cz/Image/foto/29.jpg – photo of the moved Kadov stone. He estimated that only 160 people with similar simple technology would have been necessary for transportation of the 800 ton stones in Baalbek. One of next experiments, realised 1991, was building of one segment of Stonehenge model 1:1. 10 peoples transported during 1 day 5 ton concrete stone to the top of other two stones, using only ropes and wooden sledges.

Historically, it was a common food in the Middle East, as attested by the following Bible quotes: *\\"On the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes, and parched grain.\\" *\\"Now Boaz said to her at mealtime, 'Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.'\\" So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed parched grain to her; and she ate and was satisfied, and kept some back.\\" Biblical Quotes The grain has the same length of the normal grain, although somewhat thinner and darker with a green shade. It is served as a casserole hot dish, cooked with morsels of meat or poultry.  Use as a Camp Ration  A variety of parched grains have been used historically as a camp ration, both for military troops on maneuvers and civilian travelers on extended overland journeys. Because parching both cooked the grains and removed most of the water content, it was useful as a way to have pre-cooked meals which could be stored or carried for extended periods, and weighed the same or slightly less than the uncooked grains. It also had the advantage that it could be eaten without re-heating it, either dry or by soaking in water, and so would both reduce cooking time in the field and allow troops to travel without any campfires at all if needed. In particular, parched rice was widely used in South and East Asia for troops well into the 20th century, including by the Imperial Japanese Army during the Sino-Japanese Wars and World War II. It was a primary staple of the People's Liberation Army of China during the Long March as well, being one of the few items they were able to carry a significant supply of while on the move. During the U.S. Civil War, parched maize was used both as a grain itself and as a way to carry maize for grinding into cornmeal.

For much of its first 100 years of existence, phosphorus-derived chemicals formed the majority of its products. It was set up as a partnership between two Quakers, Arthur Albright, and John Edward Wilson.Description of Albright family papers at Birmingham City ArchiveArthur Albright died 3 July 1900, aged 89: Sources:Birmingham Daily Post, Wednesday, 4 July 1900; Issue 13123: Obituary. Wrexham Advertiser, and North Wales News, Saturday, 25 August 1900; pg. 5 \\"Personal\\" - Description of Will. It became a private limited company, Albright & Wilson Ltd, in 1892; and it remained a double family-owned firm, for nearly 100 years, until 5 March 1948, when it became a public company.Threlfall (1951). Chapter XIV: The Public Company. Albright and Wilson expanded considerably into silicones, detergents, food additives, metal finishing chemicals, strontium based chemicals and chromium based chemicals. It was the second largest chemical manufacturer in the United Kingdom; although it was always very much smaller than ICI. In 1971 Tenneco bought a part of Albright and Wilson's share holdings; and in 1978 obtained full ownership. In the short term, the company retained its own identity; however many of its subsidiaries were sold off. In 1995, Tenneco divested many of its assets; and parts of the original core of Albright and Wilson were transferred into a new public company, Albright and Wilson Plc which was floated on the stock market, in February of that year. However, just four years later, following disappointing results, the French chemical company Rhodia acquired Albright and Wilson in March 2000 and the century-and-a-half old name finally disappeared except in India, Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines.Hugh Podger (2002). Albright & Wilson: The Last 50 Years. Studley: Brewin Books. . Parts of the original Albright and Wilson company are now owned by the Huntsman Corporation. After a large fire at its Avonmouth plant in 1996, which caused the temporary closure of local motorways and rail services, Albright and Wilson were fined £60,000. The move to Oldbury In 1842 Arthur Albright, a trained chemist, became a Partner in the Birmingham chemical firm of John and Edmund Sturge; his sister had married Edmund Sturge who was also a Quaker.It is not known how long the company retained Quaker scruples. Arthur Albright was an Active Quaker for his whole life. Later the company produced phosphorus munitions, contrary to the Quaker Peace Testimony. The Sturges were already manufacturing potassium chlorate for the match industry, at their chemical works at Selly Oak, adjacent to the Worcester and Birmingham Canal.British History Online Albright therefore added the production of white phosphorus in 1844. In 1850 the production of potassium chlorate and white phosphorus was moved to Langley Green, Oldbury, West Midlands; and production of white phosphorus restarted in 1851.Threlfall (1951). Chapter IV: The Foundations, 1844–56: John Wilson. The new site was located next door to the firm of Chance and Hunt in order to obtain access to a supply of sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid; and of coal from the Black Country coal fields. It was also adjacent to two different arms of the Birmingham Canal Navigations, (the BCN), one leading off the Titford Canal, so it had good transport links. Production of the red form of phosphorus, \\"amorphous phosphorus\\" was commenced by Arthur Albright in 1851, by heating white phosphorus in a sealed crucible under a vacuum. It had been discovered by Professor Schrötter, in Vienna and patented by him. However, it was explosive to make and Albright discovered a safe means of production. On 31 December 1854 Albright terminated his partnership with the Sturges; and John Edward Wilson, a merchant, joined him. In 1856 John Edward Wilson became a partner, and the new partnership was known as Albright and Wilson. In 1857 John Wilson married the sister of Rachel Albright (Albright's wife). The Sturge Brothers continued as manufacturing chemists at Birmingham, but moved their works to Stirchley; and no longer had any involvement with phosphorus. Oldbury remained the Headquarters of Albright and Wilson for most of the company's existence, eventually becoming known as the Oldbury Division. The Oldbury site was also the location of its central Research Laboratories. The business was so highly regarded in Oldbury that a new secondary school opened in the town in the 1930s was named Albright Secondary Modern School. The firm also maintained a leased London office, at Knightsbridge Green. In October 1974 it moved its Industrial Chemicals Divisional Offices, from Oldbury, to Warley. The six-storey office block, A&W; House, at 210–222 Hagley Road, was originally rented for 25 years. Fifteen years later, parts of the Head Office were moved from Knightsbridge Green to A&W; House. In October 1991 the Head Office moved to A&W; House; and in 1997 the freehold of the building was purchased. A&W; House was sold in 2001; and is now known as Quadrant West.Hugh Podger (2002), Page 218. Phosphorus and match phosphates In the early days, white phosphorus was obtained from bone ash by treating them with hydrochloric acid to produce precipitated phosphates. Then heating the meta phosphate for several days in a sealed crucible, in a retort, and distilling off phosphorus vapour, under water. Huge quantities of coal were needed for heating these retorts. The production of white phosphorus was improved by using phosphate rock and sulfuric acid instead of bone ash and hydrochloric acid; and by the use of reverberatory furnaces instead of the direct-heated furnaces. White and amorphous phosphorus remained the main product of Albright and Wilson until World War I. White phosphorus was poisonous to match makers, causing Phossy jaw. Albright and Wilson exhibited amorphous phosphorus at the Great Exhibition of 1851, at The Crystal Palace. A sample was taken away for testing by the two Swedish brothers Lundström, to make an experimental match composition. In 1855, just before the Paris Exhibition, John Edvard Lundstrom found that the matches were still usable. He placed a large order for amorphous phosphorus with Albright and Wilson and this led to the foundation of the Swedish Safety Match Industry. In 1899 Albright and Wilson added phosphorus sesquisulfide production. They were the first company to produce phosphorus sesquisulfide commercially: it was fiery and dangerous to make. Two French chemists, Savene and Cahen, proved that year that it was non-poisonous and could be used to make safety matches. Savene and Cahen Patented the match formula. In 1929 the British Match Corporation, formerly known as Bryant and May, set up a jointly- owned company with Albright and Wilson: The A & W Match Phosphorus Company. It took over ownership of a small part of the Oldbury site concerned with producing amorphous phosphorus and phosphorus sesquisulfide. Expansion Albright and Wilson expanded both by opening new sites and by buying up its rivals. The original phosphorus-based part of the company became known as the Oldbury Division. As they moved into new areas, they set up new Divisions. Just after the end of World War I, Albright and Wilson took over the Holmes' Marine Life Protection Association. It remained within Oldbury Division. Ann Street, Widnes The works in Widnes, Cheshire, were used for Phosphorus production from 1933. The works started with 2 furnaces and gradually extended to 5. The manufacture of Phosphates continued as well as the production of Calgon (water softener). All the products produced here were based on Phosphoric Acid. In 1983, Albright and Wilson celebrated 50 Years at Ann Street. Albright and Wilson was taken over by Rhodia and subsequently by Thermphos and operated until it closed in 2013, with the loss of 25 jobs. In 2010, 69 jobs were axed when production of food phosphates was transferred to Germany and the Netherlands, as a result of lower production costs abroad. , the premises are being demolished, after Thermphos went into administration in September 2012 and following the full closure of the plant in 2013. Oldbury Division In 1888 a patent was granted to four people from Wolverhampton covering the use of an electric furnace to produce white phosphorus from phosphate rock; and in 1890 they set up a works at Wednesfield to produce phosphorus. Albright and Wilson bought the patent and the works; and ran it for two years whilst they built their own furnace at Oldbury. The Wednesfield works was then closed down. White phosphorus continued in production at Oldbury until 1972 when production was moved to Newfoundland. Bulk liquid white phosphorus was then transferred by special bulk tanker ship back to Portishead, Somerset. Unfortunately the move to Newfoundland had been inadequately planned and the Company encountered serious production problems with its new giant electric furnaces – several times larger than the Oldbury machines – and with the availability of skilled local labour. These problems contributed to the company's poor financial performance and precipitated the take-over by Tenneco. Marchon Division In 1955 Albright and Wilson purchased Marchon Products Ltd based in Whitehaven, which produced phosphorus- based detergents by the \\"wet\\" process. The A&W; Group now controlled production of phosphorus compounds by both important manufacturing routes. However, the phosphate detergent business, which was the bread-and-butter market for Marchon, ran into terminal decline in the late 1970s as the eutrophication of inland waterways by pollution from detergent phosphate residues pressed the detergent formulators to move away from phosphates, thus removing Marchon's prime product application area. The name \\"Marchon\\" ended when the French company, Rhodia, took over Albright and Wilson in 1999.  References  = Notes = = Sources = * Beaver, Patrick (1985). The Match Makers.

Biography Marcos António da Fonseca Portugal was born in Lisbon. He studied music at the Patriarchal Seminary in Lisbon where, as a 14-year-old student, he wrote his first work, a Miserere. He later worked as composer and organist at the Patriarchal See, and was maestro at the Theatre of Salitre in Lisbon from c. 1784. He lived in Italy from late 1792 to 1800, possibly funded by the Prince Regent D. João, the later King John VI of Portugal. He wrote 21 operas for various Italian theatres. The first, I due gobbi (also known as Confusioni della Somiglianza), premiered in Florence in the spring of 1793. His version of The Marriage of Figaro, titled La pazza giornata, ovvero Il matrimonio di Figaro (The Crazy Day, or The Marriage of Figaro), to a libretto by Gaetano Rossi, premiered in Venice in 1799. Like most theatre composers of the time, Portugal set several librettos that had proven successful for earlier operas, such as Metastasio's Demofoonte (premièred at La Scala, Milan, in 1794) and Artaserse; he set many stories that had been used before, including Serse, Alceste, Adrasto, Semiramide and Sofonisba. Page from Portugal's manuscript of Zaira (1802) Marcos Portugal returned to Portugal in 1800. He became maestro at the São Carlos National Theatre in Lisbon and was appointed music master at the Patriarchal Seminary in Lisbon. He continued to write operas, mainly opere serie, and a large number of religious works, until the Prince Regent summoned him to the Portuguese colony of Brazil in 1811. Upon arriving, Portugal was appointed music master to the sons and daughters of the Prince Regent and became the official Royal Composer. He wrote mainly religious music until at least 1824, the date of his last known surviving autograph. In Portugal and Brazil, his reputation rests mainly on his religious music, a genre he cultivated throughout his life. He remained in Rio de Janeiro when the Portuguese Court returned to Portugal in 1821, and continuing in the employ of his pupil, the First Emperor of Brazil, D. Pedro, as he had previously served his father, King John VI of Portugal. He died as a Brazilian citizen in Rio de Janeiro in 1830. He authored the first official national anthems of Portugal (Hymno Patriótico, 1809) and Brazil (Hino da Independência do Brasil, 1822). In 2010, Bampton Classical Opera presented the UK première of Portugal's The Marriage of Figaro.

The pair are members of the string of galaxies known as Markarian's Chain.  NGC 4435  NGC 4435 is a barred lenticular galaxy currently interacting with NGC 4438. Studies of the galaxy by the Spitzer Space Telescope revealed a relatively young (190 million years) stellar population within the galaxy's nucleus, which may have originated through the interaction with NGC 4438 compressing gas and dust in that region, triggering a starburst. It also appears to have a long tidal tail possibly caused by the interaction;The Tail of NGC 4435 however, other studies suggest the apparent tail is actually foreground galactic cirrus within the Milky Way unrelated to NGC 4435.  NGC 4438  NGC 4438 is the most curious interacting galaxy in the Virgo Cluster, due to the uncertainty surrounding the energy mechanism that heats the nuclear source; this energy mechanism may be a starburst region, or a black hole- powered active galactic nucleus (AGN). Both hypotheses are currently under investigation by astronomers. This galaxy shows a highly distorted disk, including long tidal tails due to the gravitational interactions with other galaxies in the cluster and its companion. The aforementioned features explain why sources differ to classify it as a lenticular or spiral galaxy. NGC 4438 also shows signs of a past, extended, - but modest - starburst, a considerable deficiency of neutral hydrogen, as well as a displacement of the components of its interstellar medium - atomic hydrogen, molecular hydrogen, interstellar dust, and hot gas - in the direction of NGC 4435. This observation suggests both a tidal interaction with NGC 4435 and the effects of ram-pressure stripping as NGC 4438 moves at high speed through Virgo's intracluster medium, increased by the encounter between both galaxies.  As interacting galaxies  While there is evidence to suggest that the environmental damage to the interstellar medium of NGC 4438 may have been caused by an off-center collision with NGC 4435 millions of years ago, a recent discovery of several filaments of ionized gas links NGC 4438 with the large neighboring elliptical galaxy Messier 86, in addition to a discovery of gas and dust within M86 that may have been stripped from NGC 4438 during a past encounter between the two. Given the high density of galaxies in the center of the Virgo galaxy cluster, it is possible that the three galaxies, NGC 4435, NGC 4438, and M86, have had past interactions. In popular culture In the 2014 film Interstellar, \\"NGC 4438\\" along with specific observation data can be seen in Murphy Cooper (Jessica Chastain)'s notepad during the film's climactic sequence. As the presence of a supermassive black hole in the AGC of NGC 4438 is one of two leading theories, the galaxy is potentially that accessed by the wormhole in the film.

The Alingtons thrived under the Stuarts and had the privilege of handing to the King his first drink at coronations. The house was rebuilt in 1663-65 by architect Sir Roger Pratt; (Vitruvius Britannicus is wrong in assigning the house to Webb). It was a Classical eleven-bay house with a three-bay pediment, quoins, hipped roof, balustrade and belvedere on the roof. It was further enlarged in 1688, but pulled down in 1777. The splendid wrought-iron gates went to St John's College and Trinity College, Cambridge, and the rectory at Cheveley.

Background  Born in Louisville, Kentucky, on July 28, 1924, to Gambrell N. McCarty & Anita D. (Crabbe) McCarty and raised in rigidly segregated Anniston, Alabama, Braden grew up in a white, middle-class family that accepted southern racial mores wholeheartedly. A devout Episcopalian, Braden was bothered by racial segregation, but never questioned it until her college years at Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia. As she grew older she experienced what has been framed as a \\"racial conversion narrative\\", \\"a conversion of almost religious intensity\\" \\"turning myself inside out and upside down\\". After working on newspapers in Anniston and Birmingham, Alabama, Anne Braden returned to Kentucky as a young adult to write for The Louisville Times. She became a supporter of the Civil Rights Movement at a time when it was unpopular among southern whites. While working at The Louisville Times, Anne met fellow newspaperman Carl Braden, a left-wing trade unionist. The couple married in 1948. Both were deeply involved in the civil rights cause and the subsequent social movements it prompted from the 1960s to the 1970s. Career = Early activism = In 1948, Anne and Carl Braden immersed themselves in Henry Wallace's run on the Progressive Party for the presidency. Soon after Wallace's defeat, they left mainstream journalism to apply their writing talents to the interracial left wing of the labor movement through the FE (Farm and Equipment Workers) Union, representing Louisville's International Harvester employees.Fosl, Catherine (2002). Subversive Southerner (1st ed.). Palgrave Macmillan. . Even as the postwar labor movement splintered and grew less militant, civil rights causes heated up. In 1950, Anne Braden spearheaded a hospital desegregation drive in Kentucky. She endured her first arrest in 1951 when she led a delegation of southern white women organized by the Civil Rights Congress to Mississippi to protest the execution of Willie McGee, an African American man convicted of the rape of a white woman, Willette Hawkins. = Wade case = In 1954, Andrew and Charlotte Wade, an African American couple who knew the Bradens through association, approached them with a proposal that would drastically alter all lives involved. Like many other Americans after World War II, the Wades wanted to buy a house in a suburban neighborhood. Because of Jim Crow housing practices, the Wades had been unsuccessful for months in their quest to purchase a home on their own. The Bradens, who never wavered in their support for African American civil rights, agreed to purchase the home for the Wades. On May 15, 1954, Wade and his wife spent their first night in their new home in the Louisville suburb of Shively, Kentucky. Upon discovering that black people had moved in, white neighbors burned a cross in front of the house, shot out windows, and condemned the Bradens for buying it on the Wades' behalf. The Wades moved in two days before the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark condemnation of public schools' racial segregation policy in Brown v. Board of Education, Topeka, Kansas. Six weeks later, amid constant community tensions, the Wades' new house was dynamited one evening while they were out. While Vernon Bown (an associate of the Wades and the Bradens) was indicted for the bombing, the actual bombers were never sought nor brought to trial. McCarthyism affected the ordeal. Instead of addressing the segregationists' violence, the investigators alleged that the Bradens and others helping the Wades were affiliated with the Communist Party, and made that the main subject of concern. White supremacists who were pro-segregation at the time charged that these alleged Communists had engineered the bombing to provide a cause célèbre and fund-raising opportunity, but this was never proven. Nonetheless, in October 1954, Anne and Carl Braden and five other whites were charged with sedition. After a sensationalized trial, Carl Braden—the perceived ringleader—was convicted of sedition and sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. As Anne and the other defendants awaited a similar fate, Carl served eight months, but got out on $40,000 bond after a U.S. Supreme Court decision (Pennsylvania v. Nelson in 1956) invalidated state sedition laws (Steven Nelson had been arrested under the Pennsylvania Sedition Law but the federal Smith Act superseded it). All charges were dropped against Braden, but the Wades moved back to Louisville. = Southern Conference Educational Fund = Blacklisted from local employment, the Bradens took jobs as field organizers for the Southern Conference Educational Fund (SCEF), a small, New Orleans- based civil rights organization whose mission was to solicit white southern support for the beleaguered southern civil rights movement. In the years before southern civil rights violations made national news, the Bradens developed their own media, both through SCEF's monthly newspaper, The Southern Patriot, and through numerous pamphlets and press releases publicizing major civil rights campaigns. Her 1958 book The Wall Between helped place the Bradens among the civil rights movement's most dedicated white allies. Carl Braden died suddenly of a heart attack on February 18, 1975. After Carl's death, Anne Braden remained among the nation's most outspoken white anti- racist activists. She instigated the formation of a new regional multiracial organization, the Southern Organizing Committee for Economic and Social Justice (SOC), which initiated battles against environmental racism. She became an instrumental voice in the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition of the 1980s and in the two Jesse Jackson presidential campaigns, as well as organizing across racial divides in the new environmental, women's, and anti-nuclear movements that sprang up in that decade. In 1977, Braden became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. In 2005, she joined Louisville antiwar demonstrations in a wheelchair. She cofounded the Kentucky Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression and continued involvement in local activism addressing modern concerns of police brutality, environmental racism, and LGBT rights. Personal life and death In 1948, she married fellow newspaperman Carl Braden, a left-wing trade unionist. The Bradens had three children: James, born in 1951, a 1972 Rhodes Scholar, and a 1980 graduate of Harvard Law School (where he preceded Barack Obama as editor of the Harvard Law Review), has lived and practiced law for over 25 years in San Francisco, California. Anita, born in 1953, died of a pulmonary disorder at age 11. Elizabeth, born in 1960, has worked as a teacher in many countries around the world, serving as of 2006 in that capacity in rural Ethiopia. Anne Braden died on March 6, 2006, at Jewish Hospital in Louisville and was buried at Eminence Cemetery in Eminence, Kentucky. Only three days earlier, she had completed a proposal for a local activist summer camp. She was remembered by many in the civil rights movement, including Ira Grupper, Dorie Ladner, David Nolan, Efia Nwangaza, and Gwendolyn Patton. Awards Braden received the American Civil Liberties Union's first Roger Baldwin Medal of Liberty in 1990 for her contributions to civil liberties. As she aged, her activism focused more on Louisville, where she remained a leader in anti-racist drives and taught social justice history classes at University of Louisville and Northern Kentucky University. Legacy =Anne Braden Institute for Social Justice Research= After her death, The Anne Braden Institute for Social Justice Research was established at the University of Louisville in November 2006 and was officially opened on April 4, 2007. The institute focuses on social justice globally, but concentrates on the southern United States and the Louisville area. Over her nearly six decades of activism, her life touched almost every modern U.S. social movement, and her message to them all was the centrality of racism and the responsibility of whites to combat it. =\\"Anne Braden\\" (song) = The alternative hip hop group Flobots paid tribute with the song \\"Anne Braden\\" on their 2007 album Fight With Tools. The track includes several audio samples of Anne Braden (courtesy of Dr. Vincent Harding and the Veterans of Hope Project), describing her life and thoughts on race in her own words.  Works  In 1958 Anne wrote The Wall Between, a memoir of their sedition case. One of the few books of its time to unpack the psychology of white southern racism from within, it was praised by human rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Eleanor Roosevelt, and became a runner-up for the National Book Award. From the 1980s into the 2000s, Braden wrote for Southern Exposure, Southern Changes, and the National Guardian and Fellowship.  * Anne Braden : Southern Patriot (1924-2006) Directed by Anne Lewis and Mimi Pickering; Peter Pearce - camera; Dirk Powell - score; Appalshop Film & Video,; California Newsreel (Firm).

In 2017, the company celebrated its 60th anniversary. Frommer has maintained a travel-related blog on the company's website since 2007.  History  In 1957, Arthur Frommer, then a corporal in the U.S. Army, wrote a travel guide for American GIs in Europe, and then produced a civilian version called Europe on $5 a Day. The book ranked popular landmarks and sights in order of importance and included suggestions on how to travel around Europe on a budget. It was the first travel guide to show Americans that they could afford to travel in Europe. Frommer returned to the United States and began practicing law. During that time, he continued to write and also began to self-publish guidebooks to additional destinations, including New York, Mexico, Hawaii, Japan and the Caribbean. In 1977, Frommer’s trademark was sold to Simon & Schuster, Inc. Pearson bought the reference division of Simon & Schuster in 1998 and sold it to IDG Books in 1999.

The album includes versions of all four of Monkey Mafia's singles. The album cover and artwork throughout features photographs of the 1965 Watts Riots. The British DJ Jon Carter originally started using the pseudonym Monkey Mafia in 1994 for his dub and dancehall-inspired music productions. By the time the album was released, Monkey Mafia had expanded into a full band, including Douge Reuben on vocals, Dan Peppe on bass, Tom Symmons on drums, DJ Krash Slaughta (aka Paul Smith) on turntables, and Carter himself on samplers and keyboard programming. The band played the songs live at clubs and music festivals, including tours supporting Roni Size Reprazent in 1997 and Massive Attack in 1999. However, they disbanded in 2000 as Carter increasingly began to concentrate on his DJing career. Carter revived the Monkey Mafia name for a one-off single titled \\"Royal Ascot\\" in 2012. Critical reception Reviews for the album were generally favourable. NME described the album's opening as \\"gut-stabbingly groovy stuff\\" but was disappointed when the pace slowed midway through the album, concluding \\"you have to applaud the boy Carter's intermittent touch of genius. Otherwise, you're bound to conclude that if they'd curtailed a third of the 72 minutes, it would be a much more consistent and vibey listen\\". In the US Shoot the Boss was well-received, with reviewers hailing the record's rough edges and reggae influences as a refreshing alternative to current dance music. Rolling Stone claimed that the album boasts \\"deep and dubby dance mixes, reggae toasting and puréed sample soups thick enough to clog a speaker\\", and has \\"a ragged, street-smart edge too seldom found on the polished postmodern dance floor\\". Spin declared that \\"Monkey's Mafia's first full-length is a delightfully messy and rambunctious effort... Shoot the Boss captures the spirit of contemporary British multiculture in a way that really hasn't been accomplished since the end of the '70s – when the Clash, the Slits, Mark Stewart of the Pop Group, and other punky-reggae types discovered the vast legacy of Jamaican music.\\" The A.V. Club called the record \\"a tough-sounding but danceable and highly musical mini-revolt\\" and praised Carter for standing out from the other big beat artists of the time, saying, \\"his music is much more diverse and satisfying... his songs never veer far from the music he loves, and the album doesn't make lazy concessions to the charts or the clubs\\". Allmusic stated that \\"Shoot the Boss shows that although Carter is interested in electronic dance, he wants to also keep a 'human' element to his music\\" and that by including a full band \\"Monkey Mafia contains the best of both worlds\\".

He is well-remembered for his defence of the three Indian National Army soldiers accused of treason during World War II, and for attempting to negotiate a secret power-sharing agreement with Liaquat Ali Khan of the Muslim League.  Early life  Bhulabhai Desai was born in Valsad, Gujarat. Initially schooled by his maternal uncle, Bhulabhai further studied at the Avabai School in Valsad and the Bharda High School in Bombay, from where he matriculated in 1895, standing first in his school. He married Ichchhaben while still in school. They had one son, Dhirubhai, but Ichchhaben died of cancer in 1923. He then joined the Elphinstone College in Bombay from where he graduated in high standing in English literature and history. He won the Wordsworth Prize and a scholarship for standing first in History and Political Economy. He did his MA in English from the University of Bombay. Bhulabhai was appointed Professor of English and History in the Gujarat College, Ahmedabad. While teaching he also studied law. Desai enrolled as an advocate at the Bombay High Court in 1905, and became one of the city's and later the nation's leading lawyers.  Political career  Bhulabhai began his political career with joining Annie Besant's All India Home Rule League. He had joined the Indian Liberal Party, supportive of British influences, but came out in opposition of the all-European Simon Commission formed in 1928 by the British to formulate constitutional reforms in India. His connection with the Indian National Congress began when he represented the farmers of Gujarat in the inquiry by the British Government following the Bardoli Satyagraha in 1928. The satyagraha was a campaign by the farmers of Gujarat protesting oppressive taxation policies in a time of famine, under the leadership of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Bhulabhai formidably represented the farmers' case, and was important to the eventual success of the struggle. Desai formally joined the Congress in 1930. Convinced about the effectiveness of boycott of foreign goods, he formed the Swadeshi Sabha and persuaded 80 textile mills to join in, with the aim of building a boycott by Indian companies of foreign goods. The Sabha was declared illegal and he was arrested in 1932 for his activities. While in jail, Bhulabhai Desai was constantly ill. On his release on health grounds, he went to Europe for treatment. When the Congress Working Committee was reorganised, at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's insistence Desai was included in the committee. In November 1934, Desai was elected to the Central Legislative Assembly from Gujarat. The Government of India Act 1935, which allowed provincial autonomy, raised the question whether the Congress should participate in the legislatures. Bhulabhai among others supported Congress participation, pointing out the greater autonomy and political rights granted to Indians. When the Congress entered the Central Assembly, he was elected the leader of all elected Congressman, thus becoming the majority leader. He built much respect and standing by forcefully leading the first elected representation of the Congress. At the onset of World War II, the Congress opposed the arbitrary inclusion of India and Indian soldiers in the war effort. Bhulabhai Desai considered it important to use the Central Assembly to clarify the Congress attitude to the world. Bhulabhai addressed the House on 19 November 1940, making a strong plea which read \\"...unless it is India's war, it is impossible that you will get India's support.\\" Participating in the satyagraha initiated by Mohandas Gandhi, he was arrested on 10 December, under the Defense of India Act and sent to Yerwada Central Jail. He was released from prison in September 1941 on grounds of poor health, which also affected his participation in the Quit India movement.  Desai-Liaquat pact  While Mohandas Gandhi and the entire Congress Working Committee had been arrested during the Quit India movement, from 1942 to 1945, Desai was one of few Congress leaders free. While pressing demands for the immediate release of political prisoners, Desai began secretive talks with Liaquat Ali Khan, the second-most important leader of the Muslim League. However this assertion has been seriously challenged by other eminent people like Sir Chiman Lal Setalwad who have stated that Gandhi had full knowledge of the ongoing negotiations. It was their intention to negotiate an agreement for a future coalition government, which would enable a united choice for Hindus and Muslims for the independent Government of India. In this deal, Liaquat gave up the demand for a separate Muslim state in turn for parity of Muslims-to-Hindus in the council of ministers. Conceding the League as the representative of Muslims and giving a minority community equal place with the majority Hindus, Desai attempted to construct an ideal Indian alliance that would hasten India's path for freedom while ending the Quit India struggle. While Desai was working without the knowledge of Gandhi, Patel, Jawaharlal Nehru or any other Congress leader, Khan had kept the deal a secret from his superior, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. When a press report leaked the prospective deal in 1945, the respective parties were alarmed. While Desai presented full information to Gandhi, Jinnah and the League outrightly rejected any agreements, and Liaquat Ali Khan denied that such a pact was being negotiated. Desai's assertion that a deal had been reached was ridiculed by the League, while Congress leaders were angry at him for conducting such negotiations without informing them. Bhulabhai Desai would lead a major effort in March 1945 to get the House to defeat the unpopular war budget, but he had lost political standing in his own party owing to the fallout of the Desai-Liaquat pact. He was not given a ticket to contest elections for the Constituent Assembly of India on grounds of his ill-health, but also due to feelings in the Congress that Desai had been advancing his own power and popularity while the Congress leadership was imprisoned. This should be kept in mind that at that time many a proceedings of the Indian National Congress were shrouded in secrecy and people like Sir Chiman Lal Setalwad have time and again asserted that Gandhi had full knowledge of the Desai-Liaquat pact and was in fact the silent force behind the negotiations. It is also a matter worth note that when Desai was on his death bed, Gandhi went to meet him and did not speak a single word citing his \\"Maunvrata\\" (a fast wherein people do not speak for a designated period of time).  INA soldiers trial  When three captured Indian National Army (INA) officers, Shahnawaz Khan, Prem Kumar Sahgal and Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon were put on trial for treason, the Congress formed a Defence committee composed of 17 advocates including Bhulabhai Desai. The court-martial hearing began in October 1945 at the Red Fort. Bhulabhai was the leading counsel for the defence. Undeterred by poor health, Bhulabhai made an emphatic and passionate argument in defence of the charged soldiers. He worked for three months at a stretch. He cited international law in his arguments, arguing that the accused were entitled to take up arms to gain independence for their country under the order of the Provisional Government which Subhas Bose had established and which had the recognition of a few sovereign governments, and that the Indian Penal Code did not apply to their case. The judge nevertheless pronounced the three officers guilty and sentenced them to transportation for life. The accused were however released and during the course of the trials reignited the Indian freedom struggle leading to complete independence in 1947.  Death  Bhulabhai Desai died on 6 May 1946. His immense wealth led to the creation of the Bhulabhai Memorial Institute in Bombay. Legacy M.C. Setalwad authored his biography, Bhulabhai Desai. Bhulabhai Desai Road in Mumbai is named after him.

The City Museum is a cultural history museum. It displays Gothenburg and West Sweden's history, from the Viking Age to the present day. There is a permanent exhibition about the Swedish East India Company. However, the maritime history of Gothenburg has a separate museum of its own. The museum is also used as a public forum for the Gothenburg Town Planners to display new ideas and visions of the city for the citizens. History The museum was founded as the 'Göteborgs stadsmuseum' in East India House in 1861. Modelled on the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, it initially comprised natural history, art and books and covered art, science and industry. Its founders were Sven Adolf Hedlund, AF Ericsson, August Malm and Victor von Gegerfelt. The merchant John West Wilson paid for a fourth wing, opened in May 1891 shortly after his death. At the time of the Gothenburg Exhibition in 1923 the city's collections were split in two, with the art housed in the Göteborgs konstmuseum and the rest in the Göteborgs museum or Göteborgs naturhistoriska museum.

Taylor was the first African-American student enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the first accredited African-American architect when he graduated in 1892.Ellen Weiss, Robert Robinson Taylor, Encyclopedia of Alabama. He was an early and influential member of the Tuskegee Institute faculty. A native of Wilmington, North Carolina, Taylor remained in architectural practice in the American South for over forty years. He designed many of the early buildings of the Tuskegee Institute, and at several other Historically black colleges and universities. As second-in-command to Booker T. Washington, the Tuskegee Institute's founder, Taylor was instrumental in both campus planning and inventing the school's industrial curriculum. Early life Robert Robinson Taylor was born on June 8, 1868, in Wilmington, North Carolina. His father, Henry Taylor, worked as a carpenter and businessman, born into slavery but freed in 1847 by his father and owner Angus Taylor. His mother, Emily Still, was the daughter of freedmen even prior to the Civil War. He left home for MIT in 1888, where he studied architecture. In June 1890 and again in September 1891, he was recommended for the Loring Scholarship, which he held for two consecutive academic years: 1890-1891 and 1891-1892. During his course of study at MIT, he talked in person on more than one occasion with Booker T. Washington. What Washington had in mind was for Taylor to develop the industrial program at Tuskegee and to plan and direct the construction of new buildings for the campus. At the MIT faculty meeting on May 26, 1892, Taylor was one of twelve students in Course IV recommended for the degree in architecture. The class of 1892 was the largest on record since MIT's founding. After graduation Taylor did not head directly to Tuskegee. He finally accepted the Tuskegee offer in the fall or winter of 1892. Career Taylor's first building project on the Tuskegee University campus was the Science Hall (Thrasher Hall) completed in 1893. The new Science Hall was constructed entirely by students, using bricks made also by students under Taylor's supervision. The project epitomized Washington's philosophy of instilling in Tuskegee students, the descendants of former enslaved Africans, the value and dignity of physical labor and it provided an example to the world of the capabilities of African Americans in the building trades, and it underscored the larger potential of the manual training curricula being developed at Tuskegee. A number of other buildings followed, including the original Tuskegee Chapel, erected between 1895 and 1898. After the Chapel came The Oaks, built in 1899, home of the Tuskegee University president. From 1899 to 1902, he returned to Cleveland, Ohio, to work on his own and for the architectural firm of Charles W. Hopkinson. Upon his return to Tuskegee from Cleveland in 1902, he was architect and director of \\"mechanical industries\\" until his retirement in the mid-1930s. To develop a sound curriculum at Tuskegee, both Washington and Taylor drew inspiration from MIT as a model. Taylor's own admiration for MIT as a model for Tuskegee's development was conveyed in a speech that he delivered at MIT in 1911. Taylor cited examples to the 1911 US Congress in a paper to illustrate the kinds of rigorous ideas, approaches, and methods that Tuskegee had adopted from MIT and successfully applied within the context of a black educational institution. Taylor also designed buildings that were not at Tuskegee. These include Carnegie libraries at Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, and at Livingstone College in Salisbury, North Carolina. With his later partner, the black architect Louis H. Persley, he did large buildings at Selma University in Selma, Alabama, and the Colored Masonic Temple, which is also an office building and entertainment venue, in Birmingham, Alabama. He served for a period as vice-principal of Tuskegee, beginning in 1925. In 1929, under the joint sponsorship of the Phelps-Stokes Fund, the Liberian government, and Firestone Rubber, he went to Kakata, Liberia to lay out architectural plans and devise a program in industrial training for the proposed Booker Washington Institute – \\"the Tuskegee of Africa.\\" Robert Taylor served on the Mississippi Valley Flood Relief Commission, appointed by President Herbert Hoover, and was chairman of the Tuskegee chapter of the American Red Cross. Following his retirement to his native Wilmington, North Carolina, in 1935, the governor of North Carolina appointed Taylor to the board of trustees of what is now Fayetteville State University. Moreover, in 1942, less than a decade after his retirement from Tuskegee, he wrote to the secretary of his MIT class indicating that he had just been released from treatment for an unspecified illness at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. \\"Thanks to a kind Providence and skillful physicians,\\" he said, \\"I am much better now.\\" Personal life In 1898, he married Beatrice Rochon Taylor. They had four children. Beatrice's younger sister was teacher and pharmacist Etnah Rochon Boutte.\\"Mrs. Kate Rochon Dead\\" The New York Age (April 12, 1924): 2. via Newspapers.com After she died in 1906, he remarried in 1912 to Nellie Chestnut Taylor. They had one child, Robert Rochon Taylor, who became a housing advocate in Chicago. Death He died on December 13, 1942, while attending services in the Tuskegee Chapel, the building that he considered his most outstanding achievement as an architect.Robert Robinson Taylor: Institute Archives & Special Collections. MIT Institute Archives & Special Collections He was buried at the Pine Forest Cemetery in Wilmington, North Carolina. Legacy The Taylor School of Architecture and Construction Science at Tuskegee University is named for Taylor.

The Ballona Wetlands State Ecological Reserve is immediately east of Fisherman's Village and immediately to the south is the federally-owned riverine estuary of Ballona Creek. The historical Fisherman's Village that was built 53 years ago in 1967 is nestled on the eastern bank of main harbor entrance channel between Whiskey Reds (formerly Shanghai Reds) restaurant to the south and the Windward boatyard to the north. Constructed in the style of a New England fishing village, Fisherman's Village comprises five brightly painted wooden buildings, a waterfront promenade, a lighthouse, water fountain and commercial boat docks. Tourist attractions include; live music concerts, restaurant and café dining, harbor and fishing cruises, boat and bicycle rentals, a Catalina Island ferry service, souvenir shops, a nightclub and a public water shuttle (harbor ferry) service. The waterfront promenade offers panoramic views of the harbor in which approximately 5,300 pleasure boats, yachts and commercial vessels are berthed in 21 individual marinas including yacht clubs. Various types of ocean-going vessels can be seen as they pass Fisherman's Village en route to or returning from voyages into Santa Monica Bay, Catalina Island, the Pacific Ocean and beyond. On Wednesday evenings during March to September from 5 pm to 7 pm, up to 100 sailboats from 22 to 70 feet in length can be seen, sails unfurled, racing toward the finishing line in California Yacht Club's (CYC) Sunset Series regatta. Fisherman's Village address is 13755 Fiji Way, Marina del Rey, California, 90292-6909. It is situated on Los Angeles County land (public land) and designated as parcel #56 by the DBH (Department of Beaches and Harbors). DBH lease the parcels on the public's behalf. The adjoining public parking lot #1 is managed by Parking Concepts International (PCI) on behalf of DBH. The leasee of Fisherman's Village is 'Gold Coast Village, LLC' who have appointed their property management company, 'Pacific Ocean Management'. The leasee also holds other parcels in Marina Del Rey such as Admiralty Apartments on Admiralty Way, Marina Beach strip mall on Washington Boulevard and Pier 44/Dock 77 marinas.

A seal cage was emptied and various arcades for pinball machines and video games closed, including an eponymous arcade owned by actor Gary Coleman in the early 1990s. At times, the boat tours were shut down as well. There has been an effort to rebuild Fisherman's Village with a parking complex, however, due to the millions of dollars involved in order to add new shops and stores, as well as the influx of heavy traffic, it had to go through several environmental impact reports before any demolition could take place. No decision has been made at this time. The parking lot had to start charging fees in order to pay for the maintenance of Fisherman's Village.

The novel has been adapted numerous times for both stage and screen. The novel inspired the same-titled song published in 1913.  Plot summary  She Had Never Been Up There Before..., by Frederick Coffay Yohn, c. 1906, published in The Trail of the Lonesome Pine by John Fox, Jr., Scribner's, 1908 - New Britain Museum of American Art Set in the Appalachian Mountains at the turn of the twentieth century, a feud has been boiling for over thirty years between two influential mountain families, the Tollivers and the Falins. The character of Devil Judd Tolliver in the novel was based on the real life of \\"Devil John\\" Wesley Wright, a United States Marshal for the region in and around Wise County, Virginia, and Letcher County, Kentucky. The outside world and industrialization, however, are beginning to enter the area. Coal mining begins to exert its influence on the area, despite the two families' feuds. Entering the area, enterprising \\"furriner\\" (foreigner) John Hale captures the attention of the beautiful June Tolliver, and inadvertently becomes entangled in the region's politics. Geologist Hale has a vision for the potential wealth of the natural raw materials, especially coal, that he intends to use as a means of creating a legacy for himself and the Gap. But he also has an eye for the young natural beauty of a mountain girl, June Tolliver, whom he feels compelled to free from the confines of mountain life and introduce to higher education. The coming boom time for the region requires Hale to establish authoritative law and order that the two feuding clans refuse to recognize. It is this conflict between clans, who are used to settling their differences established by a century of tradition, and the principled Hale that threatens to destroy the budding romance between him and June, who then must choose between clan loyalties and the man she loves.  Adaptations  Reprising her 1912 Broadway role, Charlotte Walker starred with Thomas Meighan in the 1916 film The Trail of the Lonesome Pine. The Trail of the Lonesome Pine was first adapted for the stage by Eugene Walter. The 1912 Broadway production starred Berton Churchill and Walter's wife, Charlotte Walker. An adaptation was filmed in 1914. In the 1916 film adaptation directed by Cecil B. DeMille, Charlotte Walker reprised her Broadway role, starring with Thomas Meighan. A 1923 film adaptation starring Mary Miles Minter and Antonio Moreno is considered a lost film. A 1936 motion picture was directed by Henry Hathaway. Starring Sylvia Sidney, Henry Fonda, and Fred MacMurray, the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for Louis Alter and Sidney D. Mitchell's \\"A Melody for the Sky.\\" It was also awarded the Venice Film Festival Award for Best Color Film. Hathaway's version marked the first time the Technicolor process was used for outdoor filmmaking. The 1916 DeMille adaptation features an additional plot angle of Hale being a revenue agent seeking out \\"moonshiners.\\" It also omitted much of the subplot concerning the Falin family. Henry Hathaway's 1936 version, which was the first feature film to be filmed outdoors in full (three-strip) Technicolor, remains relatively faithful to the original novel. The novel was adapted into a successful stage play by Earl Hobson Smith and Clara Lou Kelly. Since 1964, the play has been performed in an outdoor theater in Big Stone Gap, Virginia, the hometown of the novel's author.Trail of the Lonesome Pine Amphitheatre/June Tolliver Playhouse Official Tourism Website of the Commonwealth of Virginia It is considered the longest running outdoor drama in the United StatesColbert, Judy.

Early life Aasen was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His mother, Kristi (Danielsen) from Rollag in Numedal,Johan Aasen - culture and travel industry project in Rollag municipality , Buskerud county municipality was an extremely tall Norwegian woman of around 2.20 m (almost 7 ft 3 inches) in height (latest information from September 2008, sets her height to 188 cm, almost 6 ft 2 inches). It is not certain who his father was, but according to Aasen's sister Evelyn (who died in 1988), his father was Alfred Aasen. When Aasen was ten years old, he and his mother moved from Ridgeway, Iowa (where his uncle Sam/Sevre lived with his wife Cornelia) to Sheyenne, North Dakota with his two younger siblings. Aasen was a Freemason. He raised to the degree of Master Mason at Highland Park Lodge No. 382, Los Angeles on July 14, 1924.Denslow, William R. 10,000 Famous Freemasons, Vol. I, A-D. When in Sheyenne, Aasen's mother operated a restaurant. He attended school and helped out in the family business. In 1902, Aasen's mother died. He was taken into many homes and families. When a family he was staying with started to operate a hotel in Leeds, North Dakota, he moved with them there. Aasen's growth started slowly. When he was confirmed in the Lutheran faith in Grandfield Lutheran Church near Sheyenne, North Dakota, he was the shortest in his class. According to some sources, Aasen was around 2.74 m or 8 feet, 11½ inches (which, if true, would make him even taller than Robert Wadlow, the tallest verified person in history). The Top 10 of Everything 2010 edition states his height at 8 feet, 9.7 inches (2.68 m). True height According to the 1978 edition of Guinness World Records he was only 7 feet (213.4 cm). Just before his death, at age 46, he was medically measured at 7 feet 0.9 inches, however he had lost some height due to age and could not stand completely straight anymore. In June 2008, Loma Linda University confirmed that the skeleton they had in their collection was John Aasen. Career Aasen worked for Midway Chemical, a company based in St. Paul, in 1917–1918. After that, he worked in various shows, including Barnum & Bailey and C.A. Wortham's World's Best Shows. The death of giant George Auger led to Aasen's working in the film Why Worry? (1923). Later, he acted in several other films like Bengal Tiger, Charlie Chan at the Circus, Growing Pains, Should Married Men Go Home?, Legionnaires in Paris, Two Flaming Youths, The Sting of Stings, Long Fliv the King and the Tod Browning film Freaks, in a small uncredited cameo appearance. Death Aasen died from pneumonia on August 1, 1938 at Mendocino State Hospital in Mendocino, California. His body was later shipped to Dr. Charles Humberd in Missouri for study and dissection. The skeleton was kept by the doctor, and eventually shipped to Loma Linda, California. Aasen's cremated soft parts were given a Masonic funeral at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, California.

He represented the plaintiff in Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511 (1985), which addressed whether a government official could be sued for damages based on his conduct in authorizing a warrantless wiretap for the purpose of gathering intelligence regarding a suspected threat to national security. The Supreme Court held that the official was immune from suit because his actions had not violated clearly established law. In addition, Rudovsky represented the plaintiff in City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378 (1989), which addressed whether police could be sued for failing to provide medical treatment to an arrestee who had fallen down while in police custody and allegedly had suffered \\"emotional ailments\\" as a result. The Supreme Court held that the plaintiff had not proven deliberate indifference by the police to the plaintiff's medical condition, and therefore had not established that they were liable for damages.

Steinberg (born October 4, 1933) is an American politician who served as the fifth Lieutenant Governor of Maryland from 1987 to 1995 under Governor William Donald Schaefer. He was also President of the Maryland State Senate from January 1983 to 1987, and a member of the State Senate from 1967 until his election to the position of Lieutenant Governor. Steinberg graduated from the University of Baltimore with an A.A. degree in 1952 and with a J.D. degree in 1955. The relationship between Steinberg and Schaefer was strained, with each publicly criticising the other and extensive coverage being devoted to their personal relationship. Despite their differences, they worked together for eight years (1987-1995), winning two elections in the process. Steinberg ran for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1994 launching his campaign pledging a war on crime, but was defeated by Parris Glendening, who went on to become governor. Steinberg then took up a career in lobbying. In 1998, he drew criticism for supporting the Republican candidate for Governor, Ellen Sauerbrey, rather than endorsing Glendening in his bid for re- election; Sauerbrey was a critic of abortion and of gun control, positions opposite those held by Steinberg. In 2018, he again endorsed the Republican nominee for governor, incumbent Larry Hogan, over the Democratic nominee, Ben Jealous.

Today only some parts of her journal are extant, but in 1991 it was discovered that Arabella had left two of her sister's journals to the British Museum. These journals are now in America as they were not delivered at the time. These journals reveal that Emily's autobiography was, to a degree, converted into a biography by her then elderly sisters.Introduction, Self-writing as Legacy: The Journal of Emily Shore, Barabara Timms Gates, University of Virginia, retrieved November 2014 Legacy Margaret EMILY Shore - her journal - a sample The University of Virginia Press have digitized Emily Shore's diaries to show how her sisters censored her original thoughts, what Emily Shore herself censored in her diary, and what was actually cut out of the original diary.

Foss, The Judges of England, Vol. V: 1485-1603 (Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans, & Roberts, London 1857), pp. 511-13 (Internet Archive).

Hamilton, 'Heigham, Sir Clement (died 1570)', Dictionary of National Biography (1885-1900), Vol. 25. Background and early career Clement Heigham was the son and heir of Clement Heigham of Lavenham, Suffolk, the fourth son of Thomas Heigham of Heigham (died 1492). His mother was Matilda (Maud), daughter of Lawrence Cooke of Lavenham. His exact birth date is not known, but (if we follow Metcalfe's edition) he was the first of five sons, also Thomas, John, William and Edmond.'The Visitation of Suffolk, 1561: Higham of Barrow', in W.C.

They are not to be confused with the Heighams of Giffords Hall at Wickhambrook in Suffolk. His father died on 29 August 1500, and was buried under a marble slab in the Braunches chapel on the north side of the chancel of Lavenham church, with a brass figure in full armour, a brief Latin inscription, and above it a single shield for Heigham displaying Sable a fess componée or and azure, between 3 horses' heads erased argent. (The brasses are long since lost.)Described in Richard Reyce's Breviary of Suffolk (Harleian MSS), recited in J.J. Howard (ed), The Visitation of the County of Suffolke, 2 vols (Whittaker & Co., London/Samuel Tymms, Lowestoft 1868), II, p. 228 (Internet Archive). It is suggested that Clement may have received early education from the monks of Bury St Edmunds. He was admitted at Lincoln's Inn in July 1517,Register of Admissions, Lincoln's Inn, Vol. I: From A.D. 1420 to A.D. 1799 (Lincoln's Inn, 1896), p. 38 (Internet Archive). but, being appointed an officer for the Inn's celebration of Christmas in 1519, failed to turn up, and was fined.The Records of the Honorable Society of Lincoln's Inn: The Black Books, Vol. I: A.D. 1422 to A.D. 1586 (Lincoln's Inn, 1897), p. 189 (Internet Archive). He was called to the bar in 1525.The Black Books, I, p. 212 (Internet Archive). In around 1520 he married Anne Monnynge, of a mid-Suffolk family, and over the next years she had five daughters, and one son (who died in infancy). In 1521 Clement Heigham, Roger Reve (brother of John Reve, Abbot of Bury St Edmunds 1513-1539) and Thomas Munning were among the feoffees for 2nd Duke of Norfolk and others in lands at Stow Bardolph and Wimbotsham, Norfolk.Norfolk Record Office, Hare MSS: Charter - feoffment, ref Hare 4710/5 214x6 (Discovery catalogue). By 1528, however, his first wife was dead, and he remarried to the widow Anne Bures, daughter of George Waldegrave of Smallbridge, Suffolk and Anne Drury,Howard (ed.), The Visitation of the County of Suffolke, II, p. 216 (Internet Archive). with whom he had a further three sons and two daughters. Anne had previously been the wife of Sir Henry Bures (died 1528),Will of Henry Bures of Acton, Suffolk (P.C.C. 1528, Porche quire). of Acton Hall, Suffolk, and by him had four daughters, Joan, Bridget, Anne and another, who were small children at the time of the second marriage. They were therefore the step-sisters of Heigham's elder daughters, and of similar ages to them,Howard, Visitation of Suffolk, II, at p. 250, note (Internet Archive). and were to become the half-sisters of the Heigham children by the second marriage. Estimates of the birthdate of John Higham, his first son by Anne, range between c. 1530 and c. 1540.In his will of 1626 John Higham gave his age as 96 (sc. birth 1530); if so, his admission to Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1555 was extremely late.

Dissolution and Edwardian period Following the death in 1539 of Roger Reve,Will of Roger Reve, Clothmaker of Bury St Edmunds, P.C.C. 1539, Dyngeley quire). the Court of Augmentations instructed Clement Heigham of Chevington to pay £220 to Abbot John Reve (Roger's executor), and in March 1540, shortly before his death, John Reve made his own testament appointing Heigham his executor and disposing of the sum in many small legacies, not forgetting his sister Elizabeth Munning and her daughter.

He was again appointed Autumn Reader at Lincoln's Inn at All Souls 1545, but he was reported to be \\"sykke and disseased\\", and Giles Townsend had to read for him. The Solicitor-General (Edward Griffith) called an immediate council which appointed Heigham Lent Reader next coming if willing, or to pay a fine of 20 nobles, and wrote at once for his decision. He read at Lent 1547/48.The Black Books, I, pp. 270-71, and p. 285 (Internet Archive). Following the death of King Henry and the accession of Edward VI in 1547, the Autumn vacation of 1548 was not kept owing to a death from plague in the Inn, but at the Council at All Saints' Day 1548 Clement Heigham first sat as a Governor of Lincoln's Inn, and regularly thereafter through the reigns of Edward and of Mary, where he was often in company with Edward Griffith.The Black Books, I, pp. 287-88 (Internet Archive). The names \\"Griffith\\" and \\"Griffin\\" appear to have been interchangeable.

Abbot John had, until the dissolution of St Edmund's, been responsible for the collecting of the tenths in the diocese of Norwich (which Bishop Reppes had not blushed to spend), and in Edward's reign Heigham was still being held accountable for £972 outstanding so on the abbot's account.S.M.

However, after an Act was introduced in 1549 to regulate and restore monastic pensions, in September 1552 Heigham was appointed a commissioner, together with Sir William Drury, Sir Thomas Jermyn (deceased), Sir William Waldegrave and others, to investigate abuses. They interviewed the late priors of Woodbridge and Eye, the abbot of Leiston and the prioress of Redlingfield, the Master and three fellows of Wingfield College, and many priests, former monks and lay annuitants. It was found that Ambrose Jermyn (son of Sir Thomas) had accepted the transfer of an annuity as an inducement for the granting of a benefice; Edward Reve had sold his annuity to John Holt, one of the commissioners.J.C.

Marian advancement In the succession crisis of the following summer, on 8 July 1553 Queen Mary wrote to Sir George Somerset, Sir William Drury, Sir William Waldegrave and Clement Heigham, informing them of the death of King Edward and commanding them to repair to her at Kenninghall in Norfolk. They, together with the Earl of Bath, Sir John Sulyard, Sir Henry Bedingfield, Henry Jerningham and others were with her on 12 July, in preparation for her journey to London: their swift loyalty to her was afterwards remembered.J.G. Nichols (ed.), The Chronicle of Queen Jane, and of Two Years of Queen Mary, Camden Society XLVIII (1850), pp. 3-7, and p. 175 (Internet Archive); citing Lansdowne MS 1236, fol 29. Bedingfield and Drury had sat in March for the county of Suffolk; but it was in the parliament of October 1553 that Heigham sat first, initially for Rye, and was placed in charge of some important legislation, including an Act to avoid unlawful risings.Dale, Heigham, Clement', History of Parliament. Wyatt's rebellion intervened in February 1554. In April 1554 Heigham was returned to parliament for Ipswich, Suffolk, and had responsibility for the bill concerning Ordinances for Cathedral churches in late April. This parliament was dissolved in May 1554, and soon afterwards he was admitted to the Privy Council of England.Dale, Heigham, Clement', History of Parliament. ;Speaker of the House of Commons It was then in November 1554, following solemnization of the marriage of Philip and Mary, that, being returned for West Looe (Cornwall), Heigham was elected Speaker of the House of Commons.Foss, The Judges of England, V, pp. 511-13 (Internet Archive). The Bishop of Winchester, Lord Chancellor, opened the proceedings by declaring that the parliament was called for the confirmation of true (i.e. Catholic) religion. Then Heigham, being chosen Speaker, \\"in an excellent oration, comparing the body politic to the body natural, introduced the three usual petitions, for freedom of speech, etc., and was accepted.\\" He presided over very weighty affairs. Cardinal Pole, his attainder reversed, spoke before both houses. The schemes of Stephen Gardiner were accomplished: the Acts against the Pope were repealed, and those against Heresy revived. Almost forty members of the Commons rose and left the house when they saw that the majority were minded to capitulate: Heigham's colleague Edward Griffith, since May 1552 Attorney-General, was ordered to indict them.The Parliamentary History of England from the Earliest Period to the Year 1803, Vol. I: A.D. 1066-1625 (Hansard, London 1806), pp. 616-25 (Google).

At Lincoln's Inn, at the All Saints' Day Council of 1554, Mr. Hygham's name appeared second in precedence among the six Governors, between Edward Griffith, Attorney-General of the King and Queen, and William Cordell, Solicitor-General: one year later, Clement Hygham, Knight, headed the list.The Black Books, I, p. 311 and p. 314 (Internet Archive). Sir William Waldegrave died during that year, leaving £20 among the children of his sister Anne wife of Clement Higham.Will of Sir Wyllyam Waldgrave of Buryes (Bures) St Mary, Suffolk (P.C.C. 1555, More quire). Heretics According to Heigham's own epitaph, > \\"In punishment unto the pore which ded their cryme lament > He wold with pyty mercyfull from rigour soone relent: > But unto them which wilfully contynude in offence, > A terro[r] unto them he was in Justice true defence.\\"A Concise Description > of Bury St. Edmund's and Its Environs (Longman and Co., London 1827), pp. > 19-20 (Google). Advancement to the summit of his career depended, for Heigham, upon the favour of Mary and her Chancellor, which came with expectations. Inevitably he was an instrument of their persecutions, and as a justice and magistrate he must frequently have given the first hearings to cases of religious delinquency. His reputation for severity towards common people as heretics seems borne out by a few stories in John Foxe's Acts and Monuments. ;Hooper and Mountain He was plunged directly into the full political force of Gardiner's intentions within hours of receiving his knighthood. On 28 and 29 January 1554/55 Heigham was in St Mary Overie where Stephen Gardiner with Edmund Bonner presided over a solemn company of the bishops, many lords, knights and others, to witness the public inquisition and excommunication of John Hooper, Bishop of Gloucester. Hooper was condemned, sentenced and handed over to the Sheriffs of London for burning. Many, including Sir Clement Heigham and Sir Richard Dobbs, were required to witness the notarial certificate of the proceedings. John Rogers (Prebendary of St Paul's), Dr. Rowland Taylor and Laurence Saunders (brother of Sir Edward) were condemned in the same session: Hooper was burned on 9 February 1554/55.J. Strype, Ecclesiastical Memorials, Relating Chiefly to Religion, and the Reformation of it, Vol. III Part 1 (Clarendon Press, Oxford 1822), pp. 282-91 (Internet Archive). On 5 March 1555, Queen Mary rewarded Heigham for his loyalty to her at Framlingham, and for his services as Speaker, by the grant in chief of the reversion of the manor and rectory of Nedging, Suffolk, with its lands in Semer, Bildeston, Whatfield and Chelsworth.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Philip and Mary, Vol. II; A.D. 1554-1555 (HMSO, London 1936), p. 50 (Hathi Trust). Heigham was also on the Cambridge Castle Bench with Sir Robert Broke, Edward Griffith and others when Thomas Mountain, the troubled minister of Whittington CollegeA.F. Pollard, 'Mountain, Thomas (died 1561)', Dictionary of National Biography (1885-1900), Vol. 39. was brought into the August sessions of 1555, after a long imprisonment, and was found to have no accusers. The County Sheriff for November 1554 to 1555, Sir Oliver Leader, spoke up for Mountain, and then said he had forgotten to bring with him the writ against the man. Griffith, in the meantime, was telling Mountain that he was a traitor and a heretic, and likely to be hanged. However without a writ or an accuser Broke and his fellow-justices were obliged in all equity to release Mountain on bail, which was immediately put up by his acquaintances, and he was later able to make an escape.Strype, Ecclesiastical Memorials, Vol. III Part 1, p. 306 (Internet Archive). ;East Anglian martyrs In Ipswich in summer 1555 Robert Samuel, a minister of East Bergholt, was imprisoned, and burnt at the stake on 31 August. During his confinement two devout women of reformist views, Agnes Potten and Joan Trunchfield, visited Samuel and gave him encouragement.'The Martyrdome of Rob. Samuell, Preacher', and ' John Foxe, The Acts and Monuments (1583 edition), Book 11, pp. 1727-1731 (1703-1707) and p. 1917 (1893) (The Acts and Monuments Online). Immediately after his execution they were arrested and imprisoned, and the accounts of the Chamberlains of Ipswich show that Sergeant Holmes made two journeys to the home of Sir Clement Heigham in that connection before they were burned in a single fire at Ipswich on 19 February 1555/56.'Audited Accounts 1554-1813: Robert Sparrowe, Jafferye Carre, Chamberlains, 1555-1556', in D. Allen, Ipswich Borough Archives, 1255-1835: A Catalogue, Suffolk Records Society XLIII (Boydell Press/Sponsors, Woodbridge 2000), p. 210 (Google). At about this time information had been given against Robert Pygot, a painter from Wisbech, for non-attendance at church. He was called into the sessions, and Heigham said to him, \\"Ah, are you the holy father the painter? How chance you came not to the church?\\": to which Pygot answered, \\"Sir, I am not out of the church; I trust in God.\\" \\"No, sir\\", said Heigham, \\"this is no church: this is a hall.\\" \\"Yea, sir\\", said Pygot, \\"I know very well it is a hall: but he that is in the true faith of Jesus Christ, is never absent, but present in the church of God.\\" \\"Ah sirrah\\", said the judge, \\"you are too high for me to talk with, wherefore I will send you to them that are better learned than I.\\" So he was taken to jail in Ely and interrogated, and was burned there on 16 October 1555.'The Martyrdom and Burning of William Wolsey and Roberte Pygot, paynter', in John Foxe, The Acts and Monuments (1583 edition), Book 11, p. 1739 (1715) (The Acts and Monuments Online). Heigham was present at the examination of John Fortune alias Cutler, a blacksmith of Hintlesham who had influenced Roger Bernard (a man burned at Bury St Edmunds on 30 June 1556). The Bishop of Norwich interviewed him, and Heigham intervened at a critical point in the dialogue. The bishop told Fortune he should be burned like a heretic, and Fortune asked \\"who shall give judgement upon me?\\" The bishop said, \\"I will judge a hundred such as thou art\\", and Fortune asked again, \\"Is there not a law for the spiritualty as well as for the temporalty?\\" Sir Clement Heigham said, \\"Yes, what meanest thou by that?\\" Fortune told the bishop he was a perjured man, because he had taken an oath to resist the Pope, in King Henry's time: and therefore, like a perjured lawyer, he should not be allowed to sit in judgement. 'Then sayde maister Hygham: \\"it is tyme to weede out suche fellowes as you bee in deede\\".' (This is from Fortune's own account.) Fortune was condemned.'The examination of John Fortune', in John Foxe, The Acts and Monuments (1563 edition), Book 5, pp. 1717-19 (1636-38) (The Acts and Monuments Online). Foxe also mentions John Cooper of Wattisham, who was arraigned at a Bury Lent Assize in 1557 before Sir Clement Heigham for allegedly having said that he should pray \\"if God would not take away Queen Mary, that then the devil would take her away.\\" This accusation, for a treasonable saying, was made by one Fenning, who is thought to have borne false witness: Cooper denied it. Heigham told Cooper \\"he should not escape, for an example to all heretics\\", and sentenced him to be hanged, drawn and quartered, which was accordingly done.John Foxe, The Acts and Monuments (1563 edition), Book 5, p. 1785 (The Acts and Monuments Online). In July 1558 the outspoken country wife Alice Driver of Grundisburgh, near Woodbridge, who had been pursued for her Protestant views into hiding in the countryside, appeared before Sir Clement at the Bury Assizes. Before him her principal offence was to compare Queen Mary to Jezebel, and to call her by that name, for which Heigham then and there commanded that her ears be cut off, which was done. He then committed her to be interrogated by Dr Spenser, Chancellor of Norwich, at Ipswich, where her spirited defence led to her condemnation and death at the stake in November 1558.'The death and martirdom of ii which suffred at Ipswich', in John Foxe, The Acts and Monuments (1563 edition), Book 5, p. 1751 (The Acts and Monuments Online). It is said that he issued a writ for the burning of three men at Bury St Edmunds about a fortnight before the death of Queen Mary, when it was already known that she was beyond hope of recovery.'The Martyrdome of three that were burned at Burye', in John Foxe, The Acts and Monuments (1583 edition), Book 12, p. 2073 (The Acts and Monuments Online). ;Chief Baron of the Exchequer In the parliament beginning 20 January 1557/58, in which William Cordell was chosen Speaker, Sir Clement Heigham sat for Lancaster. When the session rose on 7 March, Heigham had a few days earlier (2 March) received appointment \\"during good behaviour\\" to be Chief Baron of the Exchequer (though he had never held the rank of Serjeant- at-law), in succession to Sir Robert Broke.Calendar of the Patent Rolls, Philip and Mary, Vol. V: A.D. 1557-1558 (HMSO, London 1939), p. 60 (Hathi Trust). The great matter then in preparation was the indictment against John Harleston (Captain of Ruysbank Castle), Edward Grymeston (Comptroller of Calais), Sir Ralph Chamberlain (Lieutenant of Calais Castle), Nicholas Alexander (Captain of Newenham Bridge Castle) and Thomas Lord Wentworth (Deputy of Calais), that they had become adherents of the King of the French and had treasonably conspired to deprive Her Majesty of Calais and the other castles and to surrender them to the French during the preceding January. The indictment was found before Thomas Curtis (lord mayor), Sir John Baker (Chancellor of the Exchequer), Sir Clement Heigham and Sir Robert Broke on 2 July 1558.'Pouch XXXVIII: Trial and Acquittal of Thomas Lord Wentworthe', in Fourth Annual Report of the Deputy Keeper of the Public Records (By Command, London 1843), Appendix II: Calendar of the Contents of the Baga de Secretis, at pp. 259-61 (Google).

Elizabethan years Heigham received a new patent as Chief Baron of the Exchequer upon the accession of Queen Elizabeth, but he resigned it on 22 January 1559, and so served only 10 months in the office in all, making way for Sir Edward Saunders to succeed him. The reversal of Mary's religious policy and the abhorrence of her persecutions was such that he withdrew from public office, and retired to Barrow Hall.Foss, Judges of England, V, pp. 511-13 (Internet Archive).

His son and heir John Heigham, who had matriculated from Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1555, was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 7 May 1558.Register of Admissions, Lincoln's Inn, I, p. 64 (Internet Archive). Sir Clement however retained his place in the Suffolk magistracy, and is said, in his epitaph, to have been beloved by his neighbours for his effectiveness in settling their disputes peaceably. On 22 June 1559, following the death of Dr Thomas Bacon (Master of Gonville Hall, Cambridge), incumbent, he presented John Crosyer, Cambridge B.A. (1535-1536), M.A. (1538), to the Rectory of Barrow.J.

Heigham retained until his death the office of Chief Bailiff to the town of Bury St Edmunds, as he had held it since the time of Sir Robert Drury. He drew support from his long connection with Sir Nicholas Bacon, appointed Lord Keeper of the Great Seal and Lord Privy Seal to Elizabeth in 1558, who in the 1560s was building his residences at Old Gorhambury, Hertfordshire and Redgrave Hall, Suffolk. During the 1540s Heigham was connected with Bacon in the manors of Ingham, Ampton and Culford.'Ingham', in W.A. Copinger, The Manors of Suffolk, Vol. I: The Hundreds of Babergh and Blackbourn (T.

In 1562 Bacon was recruited by Heigham, Ambrose Jermyn, John Holt and others, to assist in their attempts to obtain a charter for Bury St Edmunds. He wrote supportively, but expressing doubt as to the prospects of success.J.

John Crosyer, rector of Barrow, died in December 1569 leaving a charitable request to the poor of the village and to its church, arising from the rents of 13 acres of land in Bury St Edmunds. He was buried in front of the altar at Barrow under a stone with his effigy in brass, and a long English verse inscription referring (in the third person) to his education, his teaching, his example and his benefaction. There were also short inscribed scrolls, and six lines of prayer in Latin verse (in the first person), which have now gone.Cooper, Athenae Cantabrigienses, I: 1500-1585, p. 282 (Google).H.K.

Then on 28 May 1570 Sir Clement presented as rector another University of Cambridge academic, Dr Humphrey Busby, who had been (the second) Regius Professor of Civil Law in Cambridge from c. 1545 to c. 1550. He was apparently deputy as Vice-Chancellor to Walter Haddon (1549-50). Like Crosyer he was originally of Trinity Hall: in 1557-1558 he served at St Stephen Walbrook, but during the 1560s he was, as Dr Bacon had been, a member of Gonville Hall, and he established scholarships at both colleges.Cooper, Athenae Cantabrigienses, I: 1500-1585, pp. 424-25 (Google).

It opens with a lengthy prayer of repentance for his many sins, hoping for and trusting in forgiveness, so that he may have Grace to receive the body and blood in the form of bread, \\"the whiche after the consecracion thereof I steadfastly belive to be the verie bodie and bludd of our Saviour Jhu Christe, the whiche was crucified for me uppon the Crosse for the redempcon of me and all sinners\\", etc., thus professing his continued adherence to the mysteries of the Old English Religion. Naturally he could not make arrangements for a chantry, but he made numerous bequests to the poor people dwelling on his estates. The will, making his widow Anne and son John his executors, amply describes the family relationships, settling Barrow with all its appurtenances and other lands upon his widow Anne for life: they are to remain thereafter to his son John, who in his own right is to have the manor of Semer, or in default of issue it is to pass by entail through Sir Clement's heirs, all of whom are in other ways provided for. Sir Clement died on 9 March 1571 and was buried as he requested at Barrow, in the tomb described below. His son John received licence to enter upon his father's lands on 2 June 1571.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Elizabeth I, Vol. V: A.D. 1569-1572 (HMSO 1966), p. 245, no. 2003 (Internet Archive).

Monument Sir Clement is buried in the Church of All Saints at Barrow, Suffolk. Against the south wall of the chancel is a tomb-chest surmounted by a low canopy with a flat-arched roof, ornamented within with quatrefoils and Tudor flowers. Externally the canopy has a horizontal frontage carved with quatrefoils (three enclosing shields, two enclosing double roses) between coursed mouldings, crowned above with a frieze of lozenge-formed crinkled foliage between the slender octagonal columnar quoins which rise at the corners as turrets. The front of the tomb-chest has three lozenges enclosing quatrefoil tracery with a heraldic shield at the centre of each.Gage, History and Antiquities of Suffolk, pp. 19-23 (Google), with Plate facing p. 22. Beneath the canopy, a brass memorial of composite construction is set into the upright wall at the back.Howard, Visitation of Suffolke, II, pp. 235-37 (Internet Archive) and Plate following p. 244 (not displayed in available scans). In the lower part are two large brass rectangular plates set adjacent, containing an epitaph to Sir Clement Heigham in 44 lines of English rhymed heptameter couplets,A Concise Description of Bury St. Edmund's and Its Environs (Longman and Co., London 1827), pp. 19-20 (Google). engraved in very controlled gothic lettering. Directly surmounting these are three figural groups separately mounted. Sir Clement, in full plate armour and with sword, appears centrally: he kneels in prayer at a desk with an open book upon it, his helmet beside it and his gauntlets hanging in front of it. He faces sinister (to the right as viewed), towards a separate group facing towards him, representing his second wife (Anne Waldegrave) kneeling at another desk, and behind her their two daughters, Judith and Dorothy.Copinger, Manors of Suffolk, VII: Thingoe, pp. 5-8 (Internet Archive). Sir Clement faces away from a third group on the dexter side (left as viewed), representing his first wife Anne Munnings kneeling at another desk, with their five daughters, Elizabeth, Margaret, Anne, Frances and Lucy, kneeling behind her. Between Sir Clement and this group is a gap with three rivet holes in the wall, representing a missing fourth group directly behind him which should have shown his sons by his second wife, John, Thomas and William Heigham. Vincent, the son of the first marriage who died in infancy, is shown by a kneeling shrouded chrisom child just behind Sir Clement himself.Howard, Visitation of Suffolke, II, pp. 235-37; Copinger, Manors of Suffolk, VII: Thingoe, pp 5-8. Above these images are three heraldic shields. The central one, engraved on a square plate of latten, bears the arms of Heigham (quarterly 1st and 4th Heigham; 2nd and 3rd Francys), including the crest of a horse's head erased, argent. The other two escutcheons are shield-shaped plates. The shield to the right as viewed, above the second wife, contains the arms of Waldegrave, 1st and 4th (shown as a quartering with Montchency, Creake, Vauncy and Moyne), quartered with Fray, 2nd and 3rd. The shield to the left as viewed represents the impalement of the Heigham quartering (as before) on the dexter side, with the Waldegrave quartering (as before) on the sinister side: it is the heraldic representation of the second marriage.Image by Simon Knott at flickr.com.Howard, Visitation of Suffolke, II, pp. 235-37; Copinger, Manors of Suffolk, VII: Thingoe, pp 5-8.

Life Prince Tysilio (or Sulio) was the second son of Brochfael Ysgythrog (of the Tusks). He fled his father's court at an early age to throw himself on the mercy of Abbot Gwyddfarch of Caer-Meguaidd (Meifod) and beg to become a monk. A Powysian warband was sent to retrieve him, but King Brochfael was eventually persuaded that his son should be allowed to stay. Tysilio probably started his career in Trallwng Llywelyn (Welshpool) and afterwards took up residence in Meifod where he was associated with Gwyddvarch and St Beuno. Fearful of further trouble from his family, Tysilio set up his base at a hermitage on Ynys Tysilio (Church Island) in the Menai Straits and became a great evangeliser on Ynys Mon (Anglesey). He spent seven years there before returning to Caer-Meguaidd (Meifod) and succeeding as Abbot. Tyslio rebuilt the Abbey Church and things were peaceful for a while. He founded the second church in Meifod - the Eglwys Tysilio. His feast day, or gwyl-mabsant, was 8 November which was also the date of the patronal festival and \\"wakes\\" in the nearby parish of Guilsfield, where a holy well was dedicated to him - the Fons Tysilio. After the death of Tysilio's brother, his sister-in-law, Queen Gwenwynwyn, desired to marry Tysilio and place him on the throne of Powys. Objecting to both proposals, Tysilio refused and found his monastery persecuted by the state. He resolved to leave for Brittany with a handful of followers. Tysilio travelled through Dyfed and across the Channel to Saint- Suliac where he established a second monastery. Tysilio is traditionally said to be the original author of the Brut Tysilio, a variant of the Welsh chronicle Brut y Brenhinedd,Brynley F. Roberts, Brut y Brenhinedd, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1971, pp. xxiv-xxxi although Brynley F. Roberts has demonstrated that the Brut Tysilio originated around 1500 as an \\"amalgam\\" of earlier versions of the Brut y Brenhinedd, which itself derives from Geoffrey of Monmouth's 12th-century Latin Historia Regum Britanniae. Tysilio died and was buried at the Abbey of Saint Suliac in 640. Identity St. Tysilio has been confused, historically, with Saint Sulien, with some scholars suggesting that they were the same historical character. The facts that they lived in different Celtic states, and had different feast days from antiquity, make this suggestion unlikely. Place names Today Tysilio's name is remembered in several church and place names in Wales, including Llandysilio in Powys, Llandissilio in Pembrokeshire, Llandysiliogogo in Ceredigion and Llantysilio in Denbighshire. Most famously it appears in the longest place name in the United Kingdom, Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwll _llantysilio_ gogogoch, part of which (shown underlined here) means the Church of St. Tysilio.Llan- is normally followed by a soft mutation in Welsh place names, as in Llandysilio. Use of the unmutated form is anomalous. The name, however, is a late 19th-century invention for the burgeoning tourist industry in the area.  References   References  *Roberts, Brynley F (Ed.).

Calder is the youngest person to receive this accolade, one of the game's top honours, and the only Wisden Cricketer of the Year that never played first-class cricket. Calder was born in South Africa. His father, Henry Calder, had a brief first-class career, playing ten matches for Hampshire, Western Province and Eastern Province in the late 19th century. He came to England in 1914 and was educated at Cranleigh School in Surrey for five years, playing cricket for the school's First XI for five years, three as captain. As a 16-year-old spin bowler, he took many wickets for the school team in 1917, and was named as a Cricketer of the Year in the 1918 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack alongside four other schoolboy cricketers, there being no first-class cricket during the First World War. Another five schoolboys were selected by Wisden as Cricketers of the Year in 1919. Calder was the youngest. Calder never appeared in a first-class game, although he did play for the Surrey Second XI in 1920, scoring 0 and 6 not out and bowling four wicketless overs for 21 against Staffordshire. The other nine schoolboy Cricketers of the Year in 1918 and 1919 all played at least one first-class game. Calder went back to South Africa with his family in 1919. His father encouraged him to continue to play cricket, but he decided to concentrate on golf and tennis instead. He worked in industry and banking. He was not tracked down until 1994, the year before his death, when the cricket historian Robert Brooke traced him to a nursing home in Cape Town. Calder said he had not known of the honour and had not played cricket since school, more than three-quarters of a century earlier.

Duson, (aka CC Duson or Curley, born August 31, 1846)Fontenot and Freeland, Acadia Parish, p212 was a legendary Louisiana lawman. He was the sheriff of St. Landry Parish, Louisiana from 1874 to 1888. During his career, he was known for his dogged determination. Famous exploits In one case, he single-handedly chased two fugitives from Opelousas to the Red River. There he killed one of them in a hand-to-hand fight. He wounded the other man and brought him back to Opelousas to face justice. His most famous case was his capture of Louis Rousseau. Rousseau had fled the state after allegedly committing a murder in the town of Ville Platte. Duson tracked Rousseau for months, and found him in the Indian Territory of Oklahoma. Louis Rousseau was captured and brought to trial. Louis Rousseau was hanged on June 8, 1877 in what was the first execution of a white man in St. Landry parish in 30 years. In another well known case, a John Sonnier eluded capture for nine years after being indicted on two counts of murder in 1871. Several years after his indictment, Sonnier returned to St. Landry Parish. He narrowly escaped Sheriff Duson and disappeared. After some determined questioning, Duson located Sonnier in Brazoria County, Texas where he was working as a prison guard. Sheriff Duson enlisted the help of two Texas officers to capture Sonnier. John Sonnier was captured and sentenced to life in prison.Information and material from an article by Mary Alice Fontenot \\"Sheriff Curley Duson always got his man\\" in Acadiana Profile Vol. 5 No.5, November/December 1976 History CC Duson was the son of Cornelius Duson McNaughton, an Irish Scotch Canadian infamous for rebelling against the English in Canada.Biographical and Historical Memoires of Louisiana, (vol. 2), pp. 478-479. Published by the Goodspeed Publishing Company, Chicago, 1892 At age 21, he started work as a deputy sheriff in 1867, under Sheriff James G. Hayes. Hayes and Duson had been friends since the Civil War when they met as POWs in a POW camp in Washington, Louisiana. James Hayes was assassinated, and the job of sheriff went to his younger brother Egbert Hayes. As sheriff, Egbert appointed Curley as his executive assistant. Curley Duson held this job until 1872, when he campaigned for the office of sheriff in 1872.The Opelousas courier. (Opelousas, La.) 1852-1910, April 20, 1872 FOR SHERIFF.

As such, he held a seat on the Legislative Council of Southern Rhodesia ex officio. The post of Administrator was officially created by section 8 of the Southern Rhodesia Order in Council of 1894, but in practice had existed as a deputy to the Chief Magistrate, who was the principal officer from 1890. The term of office was theoretically three years, though it was common to reappoint incumbents. There was, in addition, an Acting Administrator, who was a deputy. The Administrator office became defunct when Southern Rhodesia received responsible government within the British Empire in October 1923.

It plays in Division 1A of the All-Ireland League and historically has been one of the most successful clubs in Irish rugby union. History The club was formed in 1884. The founding members of the club were: * President W.L. Stokes * Secretary J. Gogarty * Treasurer M. L. Joyce * Captain J.O'Sullivan * Messrs, Patrick Stapleton, Jim Prendergast, J.O'Connor, J.G.O'Brien, Roche, Riordan, Pender, Gilligan and Dick Founding member of the club, W.L.Stokes, had a huge influence on the game in Limerick during the 1880s. He made sure Garryowen received Union recognition in 1884. If not for his tireless work promoting rugby, Garryowen might never have begun. Another great family linked to Garryowen were the O'Connors. John O'Connor was a founder member of the club and his seven sons were prominent rugby players, runners and oarsmen of national and international renown. They won 47 Munster senior cup medals between them beginning in the early 1890s. Born in Athlunkard Street, Limerick, the seven brothers - Mick, Charlie, Jack, Thade, Joe, Bryan and Jim - set an impressive record with 47 medals. Jack with 11 had the most. His son, Mick, won 4 further Munster Senior Cup medals between 1925 and 1934. The club has had two fixed homes. The Markets Field until 1957 then the club moved to Dooradoyle. After the club moved, Garryowen which had won the Senior cup in 1954 did not achieve success again for 15 years. This was the longest period in the club's history without a cup win. It was not till 1969 that another led to a glorious period for the club with probably the finest collection of players since the great nine in row team. With 5 senior cups coming in the next 10 years. There was also great success on the international scene with 6 players getting capped for Ireland in this time. After winning the Cup in 1979 the club did not achieve Cup success again until 1993, not the largest gap between wins but this was the 1st time that they had failed to win at least one cup in each decade. Back-to-back Munster Senior League successes in 1982 and 1983 were the highlights of the 80's. The foundations were laid for the great success that was achieved in the 90's. The advent of the All Ireland League would give the club game in Limerick the platform it had long sought. Having won the league title in its second and fourth year (1992, 1994), Garryowen reached two finals and a number of semi-finals only to fall just short. However, 2007 proved a spectacular year for the Limerick side, seeing them finally re-take the AIL crown after their years of disappointment and also the Munster Senior and AIL cups in what is an unprecedented clean sweep of all domestic competitions in Irish club rugby. In total Garryowen have won the Munster Senior Cup 38 times, more times than any other club. Garryowen won the trophy nine times in a row between 1889 and 1898 and have the distinction of having played in the first final in 1886 and the 100th final in 1986. The garryowen kick In playing terms a garryowen is a very high up and under kick (named after the rugby club)https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/garryowen designed to put the opposing team under pressure, by allowing the kicking team time to arrive under and compete for the high ball. It is thought to have come part of the modern lexicon in the early 1920s as one of the great Garryowen teams that won three Senior cups from 1924 to 1926 used this tactic to the utmost.

Prior to 1793, Ontario was part of Quebec and New Brunswick was part of Nova Scotia. The 84th Regiment was also involved in offensive action in the Thirteen Colonies; including North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia and what is now Maine, as well as raids upon Lake Champlain and the Mohawk Valley. The regiment consisted of 2,000 men in twenty companies. The 84th Regiment was raised from Scottish soldiers who had served in the Seven Years' War and stayed in North America. As a result, the 84th Regiment had one of the oldest and most experienced officer corps of any regiment in North America.Stacy, p. 56 The Scottish Highland regiments were a key element of the British Army in the American Revolution. How the Scots Invented the Modern World by Arthur L. Herman. p. 255 The 84th Regiment was clothed, armed and accoutred the same as the Black Watch, with Lieutenant Colonel Allan Maclean commanding the first battalion and Major General John Small of Strathardle commanding the second.Initially, Major John's Small's regiment was named the Young Royal Highlanders and Allan Maclean's was called the Royal Highland Immigrants. John Small's regiment was later amalgamated into Allan MacLean's, both taking on the name the Royal Highland Emigrants. In January 1779, all battalions of the regiment were moved from the Provincial to the Regular Establishment as the 84th Regiment of Foot. They served as part of the Regular Establishment until the end of the war. The two Battalions operated independently of each other and saw little action together.

Vol. 11, p. 447Naval Chronicle, Vol. 14, p. 28p. 125 The distinguished war hero, Lieutenant Colonel Allan Maclean of Torloisk, (1725–83), was authorized by Lieutenant General Thomas Gage to raise a regiment from Scottish communities in Canada, New York and the Carolinas. The 84th Highland Regiment was the first to be raised from American Loyalists. The soldiers were drawn from those who had served Britain in the Seven Years' War – the 42nd Regiment of Foot (Black Watch), 77th Regiment of Foot (Montgomerie's Highlanders), and 78th Fraser Highlanders.Brander, pp.203-205 The prospect of raising regiments in the Thirteen Colonies was a dangerous mission. Only two battalions of the five originally requested were raised because of the difficulty of recruiting. When Maclean arrived in New York not long after the war broke out, he was warned not to disembark in his uniform for fear of attack. As a result, when travelling alone he dressed as a doctor.Fryer, Mary Beacock, Allan Maclean, Jacobite General: The life of an eighteenth century career soldier, Dundurn Press, Toronto, 1987, p. 123 The dangers of recruiting American Loyalists became even clearer after the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge, a patriot victory, in North Carolina.Fryer, pp. 121–122  Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge, North Carolina  Members of the 84th Highland Regiment were in the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge, North Carolina, in early 1776. On 27 February 1776, the 84th Regiment, with a number of new recruits, was marching to the port of Wilmington, North Carolina. There they were to join with a force arriving from Europe and participate in operations in the southern colonies. The recruited force, at first numbering 1,600 American Loyalists but reduced during the march by desertions to fewer than 800, faced off against 1,000 American Patriots. The American Loyalists' movement was blocked by Patriot forces on two occasions, but the Loyalists managed to bypass them to reach the bridge over Widow Moore's Creek. Captain McLeod, who had survived the Battle of Bunker Hill, was killed leading the charge at Moore's Creek Bridge. Half of the regiment was captured and thirty were killed; with ninety six officers and men taken prisoner.Bruce, Bernard. The British Eighty-Fourth Regiment, (1775-1784).

It marched from Quebec in an attempt to repel Brigadier General Richard Montgomery's invasion in the Siege of Fort St. Jean, Quebec. The regiment made two attempts to relieve the fort, but eventually returned to Quebec, where it helped to stiffen the resolve of the civil population until Carleton's return from Montreal. The regiment was also involved in the Battle of Quebec. Montgomery and Benedict Arnold, who led an expedition through the wilderness of what is now Maine, combined forces and mounted attack on Quebec City. At a crucial moment in the battle, Captain McDougal led 120 of the 84th and 60 Royal Navy sailors against a force of New Hampshire troops commanded by Henry Dearborn. They overwhelmed Dearborn's men, forcing the survivors to surrender.Lefkowitz, pp. 257-258 = Military operations – Thirteen Colonies = Later in the war, they took part in raids upon Lake Champlain in 1778 and into the Mohawk Valley in 1780, 1781 and 1782.

Throughout the war, American privateers devastated the maritime economy by raiding many of the coastal communities. There were constant attacks by American privateers,Benjamin Franklin also engaged France in the war, which meant that many of the privateers were also from France. such as the Sack of Lunenburg, Nova Scotia (1782), numerous raids on Liverpool, Nova Scotia (October 1776, March 1777, September, 1777, May 1778, September 1780) and a raid on Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia (1781).Roger Marsters (2004).

There was also a naval engagement with a French fleet at Sydney, Nova Scotia, near Spanish River, Cape Breton (1781).Thomas B. Akins. (1895) History of Halifax. Dartmouth: Brook House Press.p. 82 In the fall of 1775 General George Washington authorized some ship's captains to engage in privateering activities. In violation of their charter (which allowed the taking of ships but not raids on land targets), the privateering ships Hancock and Franklin made an unopposed landing at Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, on 17 November 1775. Three days later, they sailed to Nova Scotia and raided Canso, Nova Scotia. In 1779, American privateers returned to Canso and destroyed the fisheries, which were worth £50,000 a year to Britain.Lieutenant Governor Sir Richard Hughes stated in a dispatch to Lord Germaine that \\"rebel cruisers\\" made the attack. To guard against such attacks, the 84th was garrisoned at forts around the maritime provinces. One such fort was Fort Howe,Fort Frederick was destroyed and rebuilt at Fort Howe. at the mouth of the Bay of Fundy at what is now Saint John, New Brunswick. As soon as the fort was built, it was immediately pillaged and burned by American privateers (August, 1775).Bold Privateers, p. 88 Saint John was raided three more times in the span of two months (1777) before the 84th was able to rebuild Fort Howe.Stacy, pp. 26–27 In Newfoundland, American privateers sacked numerous ports such as Chateau Bay (1778) and Twillingate (1779). Off the coast of Newfoundland, the 84th Regiment were the first to defeat an American privateer in the Battle of the Newcastle Jane (1776). Major Small also had companies from the 84th Regiment stationed in Fort Frederick, Placentia, Newfoundland. The 84th Regiment also defended Nova Scotia, attacking an American privateer off Lunenburg, Nova Scotia (1775). The 84th was led by Captain John MacDonald. They boarded the warship when part of its crew were ashore seeking plunder. They captured the crew and sailed her into Halifax.Craig, C. (1989). The Young Emigrants: Craigs of the Magaguadavic. p. 53 There were also Patriot attacks on Nova Scotia by land, such as the Battle of Fort Cumberland (also known as the Eddy Rebellion). There was the constant fear that American Patriots would attack Halifax, Nova Scotia, by land. The threat involved American Patriots landing in Windsor and marching to Halifax. As a result, in the summer of 1778, Major John Small moved the headquarters of the 84th Regiment from Halifax to Fort Edward (Nova Scotia) in Windsor. =Major General John Small, Commander, 2nd Battalion= Major Small (centre, standing) intervenes to protect Joseph Warren in The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker Hill by John Trumbull When Col. Allan Maclean landed in America, he discovered that Major General John Small, was already mobilizing American Loyalists from the 13 Colonies as well as present day Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada to create a Highland Regiment.While it wore the Scottish Highland uniform and was known as a Highland Regiment, it consisted of no more than 25% Scottish membership, the rest made up of the other nationalities present in the English Colonies during the American Revolution. Along with getting soldiers who fought in 77th Regiment of Foot (Montgomerie's Highlanders) and 78th Regiment of Foot (Fraser's Highlanders), Small was recruiting soldiers from the 42nd Regiment of Foot (Black Watch); the same regiment that he had served with in the Seven Years' War. The regiment was known as the \\"Young Royal Highlanders\\" until it turned into the 84th Regiment.Savas, p. xli Small was involved with also recruiting new immigrants as they arrived off transports from the British Isles. On one occasion, the transport George arrived in New York with 172 immigrant Highlanders. Major Small went aboard, explained the situation, and pressed the men into service. Small gave them assurance that their families would be well taken care of by the regiment. The same thing happened on October 3, 1775, with Scottish immigrants arriving in New York on the ship Glasgow. On that occasion, there were 255 immigrants (men and their families). Upon Small redirecting the immigrants to Halifax, the officer in command in Halifax reported that their amount of luggage was enough to \\"fill St. Paul's Church.\\"Duncanson, John (1989) p. 64  Battle of Bunker Hill, Boston  Major John Small was engaged to establish the Royal Highland Emigrants on 13 June 1775. Five days later, on June 17, before recruits could be found, Small and a number of other officers of the 84th Regiment were in the Battle of Bunker Hill.Also participating in the Battle were other officers of the newly raised Royal Highland Emigrants (A.K.A.Young Royal Highlanders). With him were Captain Ranald MacDonald, Captain Alexander Campbell, Captain Donald McLeod (who was recovering from wounds taken at Lexington), Volunteer William Walker, Sergeant Allan MacArthur, and a small contingent of men. Small was a central figure in the battle, leading the 38th and 43rd Regiments in storming the hill. Along with three other members of the 84th Regiment who were wounded, Small was also wounded in the arm by cannon fire. He relayed his experience to John Trumbull, who then painted his famous painting The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker Hill, in which Major Small is one of the central figures in the painting. Although the British won the battle, it was very costly: 226 were killed and 828 were wounded.Frothingham, pp. 191, 194 = Fort Edward, Headquarters, 2nd Battalion = Fort Edward, 84th Headquarters Fort Edward, 84th Headquarters (1753) Fort Edward (Nova Scotia) in Windsor was the Headquarters for the 84th Regiment in Atlantic Canada. Initially, the headquarters for the 84th Regiment was in Halifax. During the nine years of the war, members of the Battalion served on Detachments around Halifax: the Redoubt & Fort Needham (Halifax), Fort Sackville (Bedford), Fort Charlotte (Georges Island (Nova Scotia), Fort Clarence (Eastern Battery, Dartmouth). The 84th Regiment was also stationed at four locations around the Bay of Fundy: Fort Edward (Windsor), Fort Anne (Annapolis), Fort Cumberland (Amherst), and Fort Howe (Saint John). There were also forts that the 84th were stationed at on Cape Sable, Fort Cornwallis (Kentville, Nova Scotia), Sydney Mines Battery (Spanish River, Sydney),Coal Mine Battery (1759 - 1854), Sydney Mines. A British blockhouse and three earthwork batteries were built on the Spanish (Sydney) River near Indian Cove and Peck's Head. Also known as the Sydney Mines Battery. The blockhouse was rebuilt in 1778 with a four-gun battery. Fort Frederick (Placentia, Nfld.). The Regiment was also at Fort Hughes (New Brunswick) (Oromocto, New Brunswick). As well the 84th Regiment was stationed at forts in the 13 Colonies: Brooklyn Heights (New York) and Ft. Augusta (Georgia).Locations of the Forts are identified by Logan, G.M., Dr. Scottish Highlanders and the American Revolution, (1976), Halifax, NS., pp.80, 81, 99, 110, 111 Because of the threat of a land assault on Halifax by landings in Windsor, Small moved the headquarters for the 84th Highland Regiment from Halifax to Fort Edward, Windsor (1778). The 84th operated on land and sea. In June 1779, for example, the 84th Regiment at Fort Edward had captured twelve American privateers, who had plundered many small vessels and neighbouring inhabitants on the Bay of Fundy. The prisoners were wounded. The prisoners were almost rescued by another American privateer vessel the Statagem, from Marblehead which had a crew of nine. Upon seeing the fate of the prisoners, however, they abandoned the rescue mission for fear of sharing the same fate. One report stated, \\"It is to be hoped that if they dare return they will fare no better.\\"The Nova Scotia Gazette and the Weekly Chronicle, (Halifax), June 22, 1779. Kim Stacy refers to this skirmish as \\"The Battle of the Bay of Fundy\\", p. 31) Small assigned Captain Allan Macdonald, husband of the famous Scottish heroine Flora MacDonald, to be the commander of Fort Edward for five years.  Flora MacDonald  Captain Allan Macdonald had fought in the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge in North Carolina, where he was captured. He was imprisoned for two years until a prisoner exchange in 1777, when he was sent to New York and then to Fort Edward in Windsor, Nova Scotia. Major Small gave him command of the Second Battalion, 84th Regiment, at Fort Edward (Nova Scotia). He served there along with two of his sons, Ranald and Charles, who were among the young officers of the regiment.Gresner, C. C. \\"Loyalty and Devotion (The Story of Flora Macdonald\\" in Loyalists in Wetmore, D. and Sellick L. (eds.) Nova Scotia: Biographies of Loyalists Settlers. Hantsport, Nova Scotia: Lancelot Press. p. 34 Flora MacDonald by Allan Ramsay (artist) In 1750, at the age of 28, Flora married Captain Allan Macdonald of Kingsburgh, and in 1773 together they emigrated to Montgomery County (formerly Anson), North Carolina. Flora actively participated in recruiting men for the 84th Highland Regiment, displaying once more her resolution. She exhorted the 84th Regiment at Cross Creek, North Carolina (present-day Fayetteville) before they went off to fight in the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge. After Flora's husband was taken prisoner, Flora remained in hiding while the American Patriots ravaged her family plantation and she lost all her possessions. When her husband was released from prison, she travelled with him out of North Carolina to New York and then to Fort Edward in Windsor, Nova Scotia, in the fall of 1778. Flora only stayed in Nova Scotia for one year at Fort Edward, Windsor. In 1779 Flora returned home to Dunvegan Castle in Isle of Skye, Scotland. After the war, in 1784, Allan followed her. There is a plaque at Fort Edward which reads: > \\"Flora MacDonald: A name that will be mentioned in history, and if courage > and fidelity be virtures, mentioned with honour\\" - Samuel Johnson The > preserve of Bonnie Prince Charlie spent the winter of 1779 here with her > husband, Captain Allan Macdonald of the Royal Highland Emigrants, when > returning to her old home in Skye.

Halifax, November 5, 1776. This battle was the first in which a merchant British vessel defeated an American Privateer vessel. The 84th Regiment was on the transport ship Newcastle Jane off the coast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. On board the ship was 20,000 pounds sterling and 3,000 sets of uniforms, much of which was for the 84th Regiment. On October 23 at 4:00 am American privateer came within 30 yards of the Newcastle Jane. The American had ten carriage guns and twelve swivel guns and the Jane had only 6 three-pound carriage guns and a few swivels. The ships opened fire on each other. After a 24-hour standoff, the 84th Regiment had outmanoeuvred the Americans, leaving them with many wounded and a damaged vessel. By the time the battle was over, the Newcastle Jane only had two rounds of shot left.Kim Stacy (1994).

Unpublished manuscript. pp. 22–23 = Lachlan Macquarie = One of the crew in the Battle of the Newcastle Jane was a young recruit Lachlan Macquarie, who eventually became known as \\"the Father of Australia.\\"\\"Burke's landed gentry of Great Britain: together with members of the titled and non-titled contemporary establishment\\" By Peter Beauclerk Dewar, 2001, p. 923 Macquarie began his military career in 1776 at the age of fourteen when he sailed from Scotland to the New World. The attackers were repulsed and, six months later, on 9 April 1777, he obtained an ensigncy in the 84th Regiment. He did garrison duty, first in Nova Scotia, and then in New York and Charleston. He was commissioned a lieutenant in the 71st Regiment in January 1781. In 1784 he returned to Scotland from his posting in Jamaica, and was reduced to half-pay.Ellis, M. H., (1952), p. 4  Siege of Saint John (1777)  Fort Howe Machias, Maine was used as a base for privateering against Nova Scotia and as a staging and supply point for American Patriot attacks on Fort Frederick, Saint John and Fort Cumberland. In 1776, privateers from Machias had burned Fort Frederick at Saint John to the ground. In 1777, American forces briefly controlled Saint John. In response, Major John Small personally led a force to drive out the Americans. When the 84th Regiment landed at Saint John on June 30, 1777, the Americans retreated to the woods. The 84th marched through the woods and were ambushed by the American. Twelve Americans and one member of the regiment were killed. Weeks later, on July 13, 1777, American privateers again attacked Saint John and were repulsed by the 84th. In August 1777, the Americans attacked yet again and were successful, carrying off 21 boatloads of plunder.Stacy, pp. 26–27; Craig, p. 54. The 84th immediately began to replace the low-lying Fort Frederick with Fort Howe, which overlooked the settlement. Fort Howe became instrumental in curtailing privateer action and was used as an assembly point for attacks on the 13 Colonies.  Raid on Cape Sable Island, Nova Scotia  On September 4, 1778, the 84th Regiment, under the command of Ranald MacKinnon, was in the Raid of Cape Sable Island. Privateers were threatening Cape Sable Island when the 84th arrived; they surprised the ship in the night and destroyed it. For his aggressive action, MacKinnon was praised highly by Brigadier General Eyre Massey. In response, one of his friends, Captain MacDonald, wrote to Major John Small, \\"McKinnon was embarrassed by the praise of the General and requested it not be inserted in the record since he only did his duty.\\"Kim Stacy (1994).

Captain MacDonald arrived at Annapolis by ship, only to find a large privateer ship raiding the port. He destroyed the privateer vessel, which mounted ten carriage guns. Captain MacDonald also caught the attention of General Massey, who wrote that he \\"highly approved\\" of his conduct. Captain Campbell of the 84th Regiment, in December 1778, took seven men with him to retrieve an American privateer that was abandoned on Partridge Island. They returned the ship safely to Annapolis Royal.Kim Stacy (1994).

Unpublished manuscript. p. 31 In 1780, Rev. Jacob Bailey was appointed the Deputy Chaplain to the 84th Regiment. In another raid on Annapolis Royal in 1781, prisoners were captured by the crew of an American privateer and later released on parole on promise of exchange for an American prisoner at Halifax.Dunn, pp. 222-223 =Military operations – Thirteen Colonies=  Maine  In November 1777, the 84th Regiment was involved in the raid of a fort at Castine, Maine, a privateering port at the mouth of the Penobscot River. The capture of this vital port interrupted its use as a staging area by privateers to attack Nova Scotia.  Southern theatre  Upon leaving New York, the Second Battalion, 84th Regiment was engaged in the Southern theatre of the American Revolutionary War. The Southern theater was the central area of operations in the second half of the American Revolutionary War. During the first three years of the conflict, the primary military encounters had been in the north, focused on campaigns around the cities of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. Earlier in the war, the 2/84th Regiment was involved in trying to take Charleston, South Carolina, in the Battle of Sullivan's Island. On June 24, companies of the 2/84th Regiment from Boston and New York left their ports to descend upon Fort Sullivan (later renamed Fort Moultrie), South Carolina. Four days later the 84th Regiment from New York, on June 28, 1776, engaged in the Battle of Fort Sullivan (see Fort Moultrie National Monument). The fleet bombarded the fort and suffered excessive damage by return fire. The attack was a failure; 38 of the regiment died.Kim Stacy (1994).

Unpublished manuscript. p. 33 The 2/84th Regiment was involved in a skirmish at Wiboo Swamp, Savannah River, Clarendon County, South Carolina (1781). 3 of the 84th Regiment were killed as were about 18 American Patriots.Kim Stacy (1994). No One harms me with impunity - the History, Organization and Biographies of the 84th Highland Regiment (Royal Highland Emigrants) and Young Royal Highlanders during the Revolutionary War 1775-1784. Unpublished manuscript. p. 37 The 2/84th Regiment was then involved in protecting the Loyalist stronghold of Augusta, Georgia. The first skirmish was at Wiggin's Hill, Savannah River, Georgia, in April 1781. The Patriots surprised the regiment at Wiggin's Hill, but were twice repulsed. The 84th then took prisoners, killed many of them and burned their homes. Captain McKinnon tried to stop what he considered his own regiments \\"barbarity\\". The 84th was also involved with trying to protect Fort Motte in the Siege of Fort Motte, Georgia (1781). The 2/84th Regiment was forced to surrender on May 12 and were taken prisoner.Kim Stacy (1994). No One harms me with impunity - the History, Organisation and Biographies of the 84th Highland Regiment (Royal Highland Emigrants) and Young Royal Highlanders during the Revolutionary War 1775-1784. Unpublished manuscript. p. 39 =Siege of Ninety-Six, South Carolina= On June 18, 1781, the 2/84th Regiment was involved with the relief of the American Loyalists besieged by Americans Patriots in the Siege of Ninety-Six. The American Patriots were trying to defeat the American Loyalists who were trapped in an earthen fortification known as the Star Fort. The American Patriots had 1,000 troops in a siege against the 550 American Loyalists. On the 28th day of the siege, Lord Rawdon, along with the 2/84th Regiment arrived. The American Patriots retreated and those in the Star Fort were saved, although Ninety-Six was abandoned by the British not long after.Duncanson, John (1989). Rawdon and Douglas: Two Loyalists Townships in Nova Scotia. Ontario: Mika Publishing Company John Bond One of those in the Star Fort who belonged to the Ninety-Six Militia was Captain John Bond. Along with the rest of the American Loyalists from Ninety-Six, John Bond eventually left South Carolina and settled in Rawdon Township (see Rawdon, Nova Scotia), the place being named after Lord Rawdon who had saved them in the siege. =Battle of Eutaw Springs= The American Patriots attacked Orangeburg, South Carolina, with 2,600 troops. The 2/84th were part of a British force of 2,300, which stopped their advance at the Battle of Eutaw Springs on September 8, 1781. In the battle, the 84th Regiment lost 6 killed, 22 wounded and 2 missing.Craig, p. 13 =Skirmish at Fair Lawn= In the last months of the war, the Second Battalion, 84th Regiment, defending Charleston, was involved in the Skirmish at Fair Lawn (also known as Fair Lawn Barony, Colleton House, \\"below Monck's Corner\\"). The battalion was in the area of the hospital where many of their fellow wounded soldiers were located. They were also stationed at a blockhouse near Baggen's Bridge, which lead directly to Charleston. They had few soldiers in the area and the captain in charge was forced to choose between either protecting the hospital or protecting the bridge that led to Charleston. He chose to protect the bridge. On November 17, 1781, the American Patriots attacked the undefended hospital; pillaging it and then burning the building to the ground. Most of the wounded were dragged into the surrounding woods and swamps, where they died from exposure and maltreatment. After this incident, the 2/84th Regiment went to Georgia, Florida and Jamaica. In Georgia, they were involved in the skirmish on the Ogeechee River, Burke County (1781).Kim Stacy (1994). No One harms me with impunity - the History, Organisation and Biographies of the 84th Highland Regiment (Royal Highland Emigrants) and Young Royal Highlanders during the Revolutionary War 1775-1784. Unpublished manuscript. p. 44 Uniform and equipment The 84th was the only Highland regiment to keep and use its traditional highland uniform; plaids and swords, for the duration of the war. General Gage specified that the new military unit would be \\"cloathed Armed and accoutred in like manner with His Majesty's Royal Highland Regiment\\", indicating that they would wear the Highland Scots military uniform, unlike the more conventional uniforms worn by other Provincial units.Logan, pp.7-16 The original uniform of the first battalion was the green Provincial uniform, consisting of a long, green coat, tri- cornered black hat, breeches, and gray hose. They were armed with surplus King's Long Land Muskets from the Seven Years' War. In the second quarter of 1777, they received kilts, belted plaids (or perhaps both) in the government sett and wore these with their green Provincial coats (which were shortened) until these wore out, at which time they were replaced with the red coats of regulars.Fryer, p. 37 The Second Battalion did not do as well; having to provide for their own uniforms until the local governor was formally ordered to clothe and arm them in the autumn of 1776. Upon their incorporation into the Regular Establishment, their uniform was standardized to the short Highland- style coat with dark blue facings and white turnbacks. The regimental lace is presumed to have been white tape, with one blue worm between two red ones: but this description is based on a later 84th Regiment's practices. No contemporary descriptions of the regimental lace have been discovered. Buttons had one of three variations; all of which incorporated \\"84th\\" with the customary Highland embellishment. The men were issued plaids or kilts of government sett. Each man was also issued a bonnet, multiple shirts and a white wool waistcoat with regimentally marked buttons. (In addition, each man was issued two pairs of gaitored trousers, one of linen for the summer and one of blue wool for the winter. - this statement not currently supported by documentation). Companies in the South Theatre were issued brown wool gaitored trousers for the winter instead of blue wool. Officers' uniforms used gold lace and buttons. In winter, it was common for the men to wear trousers and plaids simultaneously. Members stationed in Canada were issued a wool waistcoat, a blanket coat, overshoes, a watch cape, mittens, ice creepers, and snow shoes.For more on the 84th Regiment uniform see Fryer Beacock, Mary, Allan Maclean, Jacobite General, Dundurn Press, Toronto, 1987, p. 119  Disbanded  After the American Revolution, the soldiers of the 2nd Battalion, 84th Regiment became part of the migration of the United Empire Loyalists to Nova Scotia. The 2/84th Regiment evacuated Charlotte, North Carolina, and went to New York in April 1782 and then on to Halifax, arriving on October 24, 1782.Two companies sent to Jamaica for garrison duty from Charleston, South Carolina, on December 18, 1782. The battle between France and Britain raged on in other parts of the world, e.g. the Battle of the Saintes). These men did not return to Nova Scotia until three weeks after the majority of the regiment (Duncanson, p. 69). Major Small followed them, arriving on the frigate Jason on November 12.Duncanson, p. 69 Small arrived with a number of the settlers that the 84th Regiment had saved in the Siege of Ninety-Six. These men founded Rawdon Township (currently, Rawdon, Nova Scotia, and area).Duncanson, p. 14 After the 2nd Battalion was disbanded at the headquarters for the 84th Regiment Fort Edward (Nova Scotia) on October 10, 1783, many of the 84th Regiment settled beside Rawdon Township in the newly formed Douglas Township (Kennetcook, Nova Scotia and surrounding area).Some chose to settle elsewhere, chiefly in Pictou, Halifax, and Colchester Counties, as well as along the South Shore. Major Small purchased Malachy Salter's grant (present day Selma, Nova Scotia) and built a manor house on an estate which he named \\"Selma\\", after which the community is named.Duncanson, John (1989). Rawdon and Douglas: Two Loyalists Townships in Nova Scotia. Ontario: Mika Publishing Company, p. xvi Small had hoped to establish the Feudal Barony of Straloch in Selma but his last will and testament was not honoured.Small's last will and testament was the responsibility of his cousin General Ried, who bequeathed Small's money to the University of Edinburgh (Duncanson, p.xiv, p. 71). The First battalion settled mainly in Kingston, Ontario. A few took passage, instead, to Britain. This unit, the \\"old 84th\\", was completely disbanded and has no direct descendants in the military of the modern United Kingdom. Later regiments to bear this number (84th (York and Lancaster) Regiment of Foot) have no historical nor traditional connection to it. However, the Canadian Army considers the 84th to be continued in the Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry Highlanders. = 84th Regiment soldiers in Hants County, Nova Scotia = The following is a list of the soldiers from the 84th Regiment who settled in Douglas Township in Hants County, Nova Scotia, after the war: * Hector Maclean (politician), Kennetcook, Nova Scotia * Abraham Blois, Gore, Nova Scotia * Alexander Cameron, Minasville, Nova Scotia * James Dalrymple, Kennetcook, Nova Scotia * Lewis Ettinger, Kennetcook, Nova Scotia * Christian Hennigar, Kennetcook, Nova Scotia * Thomas Laffin, Kennetcook, Nova Scotia For list of the 84th Regiment soldiers who settled in the Douglas Township see Duncanson, John (1989).

The reciprocal rule can be used to show that the power rule holds for negative exponents if it has already been established for positive exponents. Also, one can readily deduce the quotient rule from the reciprocal rule and the product rule. The reciprocal rule states that if f is differentiable at a point x and f(x) ≠ 0 then g(x) = 1/f(x) is also differentiable at x and : g'(x) = frac {d}{dx} left(frac {1}{f(x)}right) = -frac{f'(x)}{f(x)^2}.  Proof  This proof relies on the premise that f is differentiable at x, and on the theorem that f is then also necessarily continuous there. Applying the definition of the derivative of g at x with f(x) e 0 gives :begin{align} g'(x) = frac d {dx} left(frac {1} {f(x)}right) & = lim_{hto0} left (frac{frac {1}{f(x+h)} - frac {1}{f(x)}} {h} right ) & = lim_{hto0} left( frac{f(x)-f(x+h)}{h cdot f(x)f(x+h)} right) & = lim_{hto0} left( - frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} cdot frac 1 {f(x)f(x+h)} right).end{align} The limit of this product exists and is equal to the product of the existing limits of its factors: :left( lim_{hto0} -frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} right)cdotleft( lim_{hto0} frac {1}{f(x)cdot f(x+h)}right). Because of the differentiability of f at x the first limit equals -f'(x), and because of f(x) e 0 and the continuity of f at x the second limit thus yielding :g'(x) = -f'(x) cdot frac {1}{f(x)^2} = -frac{f'(x)}{f(x)^2}.  A weak reciprocal rule that follows algebraically from the product rule  It may be argued that since : f(x)cdot frac 1 {f(x)} = 1, an application of the product rule says that : f'(x) left( frac 1 fright)(x) + f(x) left( frac 1 fright)'(x) = 0, and this may be algebraically rearranged to say : left( frac 1 fright)'(x) = frac{-f'(x)}{f(x)^2}. However, this fails to prove that 1/f is differentiable at x; it is valid only when differentiability of 1/f at x is already established. In that way, it is a weaker result than the reciprocal rule proved above. However, in the context of differential algebra, in which there is nothing that is not differentiable and in which derivatives are not defined by limits, it is in this way that the reciprocal rule and the more general quotient rule are established.  Application to generalization of the power rule  Often the power rule, stating that tfrac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}, is proved by methods that are valid only when n is a nonnegative integer. This can be extended to negative integers n by letting n = -m, where _m_ is a positive integer. : begin{align} frac d {dx} x^n & = frac d {dx},left(frac 1 {x^{m}}right)  & = -frac{frac {d} {dx} x^{m}}{(x^{m})^2}, text{ by the reciprocal rule}  & = -frac{mx^{m-1}}{x^{2m}}, text{ by the power rule applied to the positive integer } m,  & = -mx^{-m-1} = nx^{n-1}, text{ by substituting back }n = -m. end{align}  Application to a proof of the quotient rule  The reciprocal rule is a special case of the quotient rule, which states that if f and g are differentiable at x and g(x) ≠ 0 then : frac d {dx}, left[frac{f(x)}{g(x)}right] = frac{g(x)f,'(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{[g(x)]^2}. The quotient rule can be proved by writing : frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = f(x) cdot frac 1 {g(x)} and then first applying the product rule, and then applying the reciprocal rule to the second factor. begin{align} frac d{dx} left[frac{f(x)}{g(x)}right] &= frac d{dx} left[f(x) cdot frac 1 {g(x)}right] &= f'(x) cdot frac{1}{g(x)} + f(x) cdot frac d{dx} left[frac{1}{g(x)}right] &= f'(x) cdot frac{1}{g(x)} + f(x) cdot left[frac{-g'(x)}{g(x)^2}right] &= frac{f'(x)}{g(x)} - frac{f(x)g'(x)}{[g(x)]^2} &= frac{f'(x)g(x)-f(x)g'(x)}{[g(x)]^2}. end{align}  Application to differentiation of trigonometric functions  By using the reciprocal rule one can find the derivative of the secant and cosecant functions. For the secant function: : begin{align} frac d {dx} sec x & = frac d {dx} , left(frac 1 {cos x}right) = frac{-frac d {dx} cos x}{cos^2 x} = frac{sin x}{cos^2 x} = frac 1 {cos x}cdotfrac{sin x}{cos x} = sec xtan x. end{align} The cosecant is treated similarly: : begin{align} frac d {dx} csc x & = frac d {dx} , left(frac 1 {sin x}right) = frac{-frac d {dx} sin x}{sin^2 x} = -frac{cos x}{sin^2 x} = -frac 1 {sin x}cdotfrac{cos x}{sin x} = -csc xcot x. end{align} See also *Product rule *Quotient rule *Chain rule *Difference quotient Differentiation rules ","title":"Reciprocal rule"},{"id":"4300322","text":"The following list includes all the works of Lydia Sigourney that were published as books under her supervision.

The company was founded in 1980 by Lido Filippi. Today, the running of the boatyard is undertaken by Lido Filippi’s son David; the yard employs 60 technicians and produces just over 1100 boats each year which supply Federations worldwide. In the previous 20 years, crews in Filippi boats have achieved over 400 medals in World Rowing Championships and at the Olympic Games. History The history of Cantiere Filippi dates back to 1980 when Lido Filippi opened his own boat-building business producing wooden rowing boats in a small shed with five other shipwrights. The boatyard's location is unique, as it stands in Donoratico on the Tyrrhenian Sea, which looks out onto the Tuscany archipelago, home to Elba, the \\"buen retiro\\" of Napoleon Bonaparte. By the mid- to late 1980s, Cantiere Filippi was already enjoying its first international successes winning gold medals at the 1986 World Rowing Championships in Nottingham, England and in 1987 World Rowing Championships in Copenhagen. It went on to scale even greater heights by winning gold in the coxless quadruple sculls at the Seoul Olympics in 1988. In 1997 Cantiere Filippi was awarded the first ISO quality certification. This was a decisive step as it enabled Cantiere Filippi to guarantee both its international clientele and its 22 exclusive resellers on all five continents consistently high quality according to a clearly defined process. Each boat that leaves Donoratico complies fully with all the points of a technical card that is signed by each one of the craftsmen who worked on it. Today Nowadays, traditional wooden boats have been replaced by carbon fibre and honeycomb sandwich constructions made with vacuum bag technology and polymerisation in high-temperature ovens. Today, Cantiere Filippi employs 60 craftsmen and those old boats have been replaced by its familiar blue and white ones, which are built in the 2500 square metre boatyard of Filippi Lido Srl, just outside the town of Donoratico in the province of Livorno. Filippi Boats Srl manufacture a wide variety of moulds of shell, suitable for athletes of a wide variety of weight and height. Boats can also vary in the rigging set up with the latest and most advanced being the Carbon Aliante set up, which is seen on the vast majority of Filippi boats at world level competitions. Each year Filippi endeavor to bring out at least one new mould of boat to cater for an even greater expanse of rowers. Boats along with accessories are distributed through the network of worldwide Filippi boats dealers.374x374px Developments in boat-building techniques, a proverbial attention to detail and an excellent price-quality ratio have made Filippi a worldwide name. The hallmark of Cantiere Filippi, however, is that it invests much of its resources into research and employs the latest techniques, such as carbon riggers in both traditional and wing form. It also used to assess the seaworthiness of its boats with hydrodynamic tests at its ship tank in Insean, but today these have been replaced by sophisticated Computer Fluid Dynamics software. In addition to its research, Cantiere Filippi has also invested in workplace safety systems and its production processes are conducted in full respect of the environment. Today, Lido Filippi works alongside his son David and employs more than sixty technicians who help to produce about 700 boats per year for federations across the world. Much is owed to the directors, trainers and athletes of these federations for the noticeable increase in the technical level of these boats. Their preparation, passion and ambition blend effortlessly with the way the boatyard views the future of rowing. High praise must also go to the International Rowing Federation (FISA) which in 1996 officially invited the company to attend the Olympic Games, recognition of the excellent quality of boatyard's work in the service of rowing, one of the Olympics' most long-standing events. Design Today, Cantiere Filippi is able to design and test a boat without actually building it, with the help of sophisticated observation techniques designed in conjunction with the University of Ferrara and with the Department of Applied Mathematics at Milan Polytechnic, which helped develop Team Alinghi. A virtual rower is placed inside a virtual boat and the athlete's movement is simulated in the water. As the position of the rower's centre of gravity changes, the force exerted on the stretcher, seat and rowlock is monitored. Rowers with different builds, techniques and experience are used so that a range of force is generated. Once these data have been gathered, they are put into software that matches the three-dimensional drawings of the boat created ad hoc by a research laboratory with the most suitable hull for each individual athlete, or team of athletes. This match also takes account of maximum speed and pitch as well as the conditions of the regatta basin. Once the best hydrodynamics have been established, the whole boat is created with design software that ensures each measurement is reproduced with pinpoint accuracy. A model is produced by removing any unnecessary elements from the drawing and by adding the ones required to layer the mould. The end-drawing is then used to mill the model on the CNC machine. Once the model has been made, the next step is to produce the mould.  Parmigiani Spirit Award  Parmigiani Fleurier joined World Rowing in supporting all young rowing scholars around the world with the creation of the Parmigiani Spirit Award. The Parmigiani Spirit Award is presented to a university rower who has demonstrated the core values of rowing in his/her social, academic and sporting life, and, through these values, also enabled or inspired exceptional success in other people's lives - for example in education, business, sports or charity. _Eligibility Criteria_ The Parmigiani Spirit Award is open to current university students worldwide who study full-time and row regularly for a university rowing club. The rowing club of the winner is presented with a custom-made new Filippi racing eight boat. Each nomination must be made by two of the nominated rower's teammates, supported by the rowing club and endorsed by the university. Only one member may be nominated by each club. Results Over the last 20 years, Teams competing in Filippi boats have won more than 400 medals at World Championships and Olympic Games. In 2014 Filippi boats won 85 medals in international competitions (27 golds) and 12 potentially of Olympic interest. In particular the gold and silver medal with New Zealand and Italy in senior men's coxless four in Munich has really no precedents. Quality Certification The company has implemented and maintains the ISO9001-2008 Quality Management System.

The twenty-five-and-a- half-minute production was written and directed by Buffy creator Joss Whedon, and was expanded upon and re-shot for the first episode of the series. It is notable for featuring a different actress in the role of Willow, Sunnydale High is Berryman High and a different actor as Principal Flutie. After having burned down her school gym and been expelled from a school in L.A., Buffy Summers has moved to Sunnydale with her mother. Buffy goes to school for the first time at Sunnydale High and meets new people: Cordelia, Willow, and Xander. Willow is lured by a vampire into a trap. Buffy shows up with Xander and kills all the vampires except one; the surviving vampire reports the incident back to The Master. While a popular bootleg, Whedon has said the pilot episode will not be officially released, as he feels it is poor quality. Plot synopsis A couple breaks into a deserted school. The girl is a beautiful blonde, and she follows the guy to the theater stage. She stops, seemingly afraid that she has heard something. He assures her that there is nothing to be worried about, but the girl, whose identity is later revealed to be Darla, turns towards him with a monstrous face and bites his neck, killing him. Buffy Summers begins her first day at Berryman High School. She meets Principal Flutie, who can't remember her name. Meanwhile, Xander arrives and announces he is troubled by mathematics work. He offers his best friend Willow a shiny nickel in exchange for her help. Cordelia and her gang of mean girls mock Willow's outfit, before mocking Xander for daring to speak to them. Xander searches for a witty comeback but is interrupted by Buffy bumping into him and dropping her things. She introduces herself and asks for directions to the library. Xander explains where the library is; after she walks away, he finds a stake that she dropped. Buffy arrives at the library and encounters the British librarian, Mr. Giles. She explains she's working on history, but instead of helping her with that, Giles slams a book on the desk entitled Vampyr. She leaves, obviously unsettled. After class, Willow approaches her, offering to help her with her studies. Buffy cheerfully accepts. The two walk through the school, and Willow admits to having a dorky nature. Buffy tries to convince Willow she's pretty, but Willow won't listen. Buffy asks her about the librarian. Willow says that Mr. Giles is new, \\"from some British museum\\". Cordelia and her gang interrupt them, attempting to get Buffy to join them and leave Willow. Two other school girls, Aura and Aphrodesia, talk about the new girl while preparing for gym class. However, they are interrupted by a body falling out of a locker. Meanwhile, Xander returns Buffy's stake. Xander then gives Buffy a tour of the school. Willow approaches Buffy and Xander, troubled. She explains about the body in the locker. Once Cordelia confirms the news, Buffy runs off. She meets Principal Flutie when he is coming out of the girl's locker room and asks to see the body. When she finds the two holes in the neck, she heads for the library. Mr. Giles is unsurprised by the news; instead, he is surprised that Buffy seems to be rejecting interest in Slaying. She angrily tells him that she loved her life before she knew about her calling and even loved it for a little time after. She explains she then lost everything she valued (including her Watcher) and now wants nothing to do with it. Xander overhears the conversation in the stacks. That night, en route to her first visit to The Bronze the cool student hangout in Sunnydale, Buffy meets a stranger, who warns her that she is living on a Hellmouth. He also gives her a large silver cross. It isn't revealed in the pilot that the stranger's name is Angel. This was the only deleted scene in the pilot. That night, Buffy meets Xander outside the Bronze and asks about Willow. Xander says that Willow has seemingly found a boyfriend, information that unnerves Buffy. She quizzes Xander about the guy's appearance; when he mentions a 'Lionel Richie' look, Buffy runs off. Xander follows. Willow is shyly hanging out with a handsome blond guy whose face turns to the monstrous form of a vampire about to feed. Xander and Buffy hear Willow's scream from the auditorium. Buffy charges in, finds the blond vampire biting Willow, and attacks him. Two other vampires emerge. Xander and Willow attempt to escape, using a cross to scare the vamps. Buffy dispatches the vamps and announces she is \\"The Slayer\\". One vampire runs away, and Buffy is left to dispatch the blond vampire. The next morning, Giles is unimpressed by Buffy's sloppy fighting and the fact that she allowed others to find out her identity as the Slayer. Her new friends, Willow and Xander, defend her, but Buffy is unbothered.

He was president of Brigham Young University (BYU) from 1951 to 1971, simultaneously overseeing the entire LDS Church Educational System (CES). He is credited with the expansion of BYU. Under his presidency, the student body increased six times to over twenty-five thousand students due to the physical growth of the university and his aggressive recruiting policies. The number of colleges at the university increased from five to thirteen and the number of faculty members increased four-fold. Wilkinson focused on recruiting more faculty and convincing current faculty to receive education outside the university. As a result, the number of teachers with doctorate degrees increased from 50 to 500. Associate and doctoral programs were created for BYU. The J. Reuben Clark Library (now the Harold B. Lee Library (HBLL)) was built and library resources were expanded by 500 percent. The number of buildings on BYU campus increased from 6 to over 300 buildings, representing an increase in floor space of about 4.2 million square feet. He initiated the construction of various student housing options to accommodate over 6,000 students. Additionally, he increased the number of student religious congregations. During his twenty-year presidency, the number of congregations increased from 1 student branch to 98 wards and 10 stakes for LDS students. Under Wilkinson's presidency, the BYU Honor Code was more clearly established and was designed to include a strict dress code. Wilkinson was a strongly conservative Republican. He unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 1964, while he was president of BYU. Prior to his career in education, Wilkinson was a lawyer in Washington, D.C. and New York City, his most well-known and lucrative case being a $32 million settlement from the U.S. government for the Ute Indian Tribes.  Background and education  Ernest Leroy Wilkinson was born in Ogden, Utah on May 4, 1899. He was one of seven children of Robert Brown Wilkinson and Annie Cecilia Anderson. Robert Wilkinson was a Scottish immigrant who arrived in the United States as a young boy and later married Annie Anderson. Robert Wilkinson worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad for 25 years. Robert Wilkinson supported the union and according to family, at one time ran for mayor of Ogden as a Socialist candidate. During Ernest Wilkinson's childhood, he associated mostly with older boys and men, as there were few boys his age. He became involved in cock fighting, buying a few cocks with the money he made from delivering Desert News, but stopped cock fighting after police started persecuting offenders. In order to cultivate his faith as a member of the LDS Church, his mother suggested he attend Weber Academy, which was then owned by the church. Before his graduation, he won the Dr. Edward S. Rich oratorical contest with his speech entitled, \\"American Ideals\\". He graduated from Weber Academy in Ogden in 1917. He continued studies at the expanded Weber Academy, then known as Weber College. During his time at Weber he organized the Public Service Bureau (a service organization), was editor of the yearbook, and was president of the student body for two years. He competed in forensics meets and won the state championship with his team. He received the Lewis Efficacy Medal for students excelling in scholarship and public service and was valedictorian of his class. After a year at Weber College, Wilkinson became a member of the Student Army Training Corps unit located at BYU. Wilkinson attributed his success to what he learned at Weber Academy and became interested in the idea of offering a religiously affiliated education to more LDS youth. After the war, he became a regular student at BYU and among other things served as the editor of the weekly newspaper White and Blue and was president of his senior class. Wilkinson and a few colleagues received special recognition when they beat the Princeton debate team. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at BYU in 1921. He married Alice Valera Ludlow, a native of Spanish Fork, whom he had met while they were both students at BYU. They were married in the Salt Lake Temple on August 16, 1923. The ceremony was performed by James E. Talmage. Alice was elected vice president of the student body with Wilkinson as her campaign manager and had studied drama at BYU. The Wilkinsons had five children together. Career After graduation, Wilkinson began teaching English and speech at Weber College. During this time, Wilkinson began to take an active interest in politics. He ran as a Democrat for county auditor and lost. =Law School= In 1923, Wilkinson was involved with the campaign of William H. King for United States Senate. King invited Wilkinson to be his secretary (administrative assistant) in Washington D.C. He agreed so that he could take evening classes at George Washington University. When he arrived in Washington D.C., he was informed by King's current secretary that he was to arrange for another position for him. He was offered the position of assistant architect of the Capitol Building. Uninterested in architecture, Wilkinson found a job as a teacher of a business high school teaching shorthand and typing, still able to attend law school at night. He earned a law degree from George Washington University summa cum laude in 1926. He was admitted to the Washington D.C., Utah, and New York bar associations. He studied at Harvard Law School on scholarship for his graduate studies. Even though five years of teaching were prerequisite for entering in the doctoral program, he was granted exception from Dean Roscoe Pound of the law school due to his academics at George Washington University. In 1927, Wilkinson graduated from Harvard Law School with a Doctor of Juridical Science. = Teaching law = He initially accepted a position teaching law at the University of California, but quickly resigned in order to pursue another offer to teach at the more prestigious New Jersey Law School, the largest law school in the United States at the time, where he taught from 1927 to 1933. After aiding Hughes, Schurman, and Dwight law firm with a challenging tax problem, he was invited to join their law firm in New York City. He began practicing there as well as teaching at New Jersey Law School, where he was known as notoriously difficult professor.; =Practicing law= After working for future Supreme Court chief justice Charles Evans Hughes, and working with Moyle & Wilkinson in Washington D.C., Wilkinson opened up a private firm in 1940 where he practiced for eleven years. One case involved a young, American soldier in Japan who was sentenced to death for accidentally killing a child in a motorcycle accident. He succeeded in lowering the sentence to only the time in jail that the man had already served. Even though he received no compensation for the case, he considered it the most gratifying case he ever worked on. He served as attorney for the Ute Indian Tribes in their suit to be compensated for land never paid for by the U.S. government as part of the Treaty of 1880. In 1950, this suit was upheld by the United States Court of Claims and as a result, the Ute tribes were awarded $32 million. Due to Wilkinson's work, the Indian Claims Commission was signed in 1946 by Harry S. Truman. This opened up more claims to be filed and prosecuted by Wilkinson, making his firm the most active in the country for tribal cases. Wilkinson's share of the Ute Indian settlement as the plaintiff's attorney made him independently wealthy, and allowed him to give up his law practice to pursue his interests in education. When he became the 7th president of BYU, Wilkinson created a new law firm: Wilkinson, Cragun, and Barker. He was the senior partner, but management was left to his brother, Glen Wilkinson, Cragun, and Barker. =Political= Wilkinson was heavily interested in politics. Influenced by his socialist father from a young age, his viewpoints shifted to conservatism in his adult years. During the Cold War, LDS Church leaders were particularly fearful of the influence of Communism in the United States. This was manifest in their choice of strictly conservative Wilkinson as the next BYU president. LDS Church leader Stephen L. Richards hoped in Wilkinson's inauguration that Wilkinson would, \\"implant in youth a deep love of country and a reverential regard for the Constitution of the United States.\\" Wilkinson made it clear that he supported the Republican party and disliked Communism. Some students at BYU criticized his \\"unabashed partisanship\\". Despite his interest in politics during the beginning of his presidency at BYU, he did not seriously consider running for the U.S. Senate. Though his law career had taught him how to navigate federal bureaucracy, he did not feel that he had the skills to win a congressional race. In addition, he was more concerned, at the time, in the work he could accomplish in Utah as BYU president rather than in Washington. Several times during the 1950s and 1960s, Wilkinson approached church president David O. McKay for his permission to run for public office. He was advised not to run until 1964 when he was given a one-year leave of absence to run for the senate. In his absence, duties of the president and chancellor were taken up by Earl C. Crockett and Harvey L. Taylor respectively. In 1964, Wilkinson won the Republican Party nomination for the United States Senate, defeating Sherman P. Lloyd. Wilkinson lost in the general election to incumbent Senator Frank Moss. Within a month after his defeat, Wilkinson returned to BYU, but members of the Board of Trustees maintained that Harvey Taylor remain chancellor. As consolation, Wilkinson was granted a $20,000 salary, the largest salary of any BYU employee at the time. BYU presidency =The First Era: 1951-1957=  Beginnings  After Howard S. McDonald resigned from his position as BYU President, Christian Jensen served as interim president for about ten months. In 1949, at a dinner for Jensen, Wilkinson gave a speech asserting the ways in which he believed BYU could excel. He expressed that he had high aspirations for the school and believed in the values of combining a spiritual and secular education. After the dinner, Wilkinson was invited to share his ideas with the church's First Presidency and the Board of Trustees. The favorite candidate of J. Reuben Clark to fill the vacancy of BYU president was the vocally conservative Wilkinson who lobbied LDS Church leaders to be appointed as president of BYU and was offered the position in July 1950. Wilkinson refused to be paid a salary, which attracted church officials in the aftermath of tense financial negotiations with previous president, McDonald. In September 1950, Wilkinson changed the members of the board of trustees from local members to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles with the First Presidency serving as president and vice presidents, respectively, of the board. Wilkinson wanted a direct line of communication to McKay, the church president at the time. Wilkinson would frequently counsel directly with McKay, avoiding the Board of Trustees. From 1951 to the end of 1952, Wilkinson had no official assistants besides William F. Edwards, the dean of the College of Commerce, and William E. Berrett, a professor of religion. At the end of 1952, Harvey L. Taylor became Wilkinson's first administrative assistant. Wilkinson was considered by most of his subordinates difficult to work with, citing him as dictatorial and inconsiderate. At 5'5\\", his nicknames among colleagues were \\"Little General\\" or \\"Little Napoleon\\". Aware of his difficulty getting along with his employees, he claimed he \\"[didn't] have time to be polite\\".  Unification and CES  In 1953, in an attempt to unify church schools, Wilkinson was named administrator of the church's schools. Besides his duties at BYU, he oversaw the administrative duties of Ricks College (now Brigham Young University-Idaho), LDS Business College, the McCune School of Music, and Juarez Academy in Mexico, along with seventeen institutes and 193 seminaries. Wilkinson proposed that the name CES be changed to University of Deseret, but his proposal was rejected for multiple reasons, one of them being that people were unwilling to drop the name of Brigham Young from their school. After this expansion of CES and thus Wilkinson's duties, he appointed Edwards and Barrett as vice presidents of the LDS Department of Education. In 1953, CES considered reacquiring Weber College, Snow College, and Dixie College in order to expand its influence. A referendum was included on the November 1954 ballot to transfer these three junior colleges from the State of Utah back to CES. The controversial referendum was defeated in the election with less than 40% of voters in favor. Still interested in pursuing junior colleges, CES established the Church College of Hawaii (CCH) (now Brigham Young University-Hawaii) in 1955 in Laie, Hawaii. Shorty thereafter, CCH and other LDS institutions in the Pacific were removed from CES, considered to be closer to \\"missionary operations\\" and the presidents of the institution were subject to the local school systems rather than CES.A hallway in the Wilkinson Center at BYU, named after President Ernest L. Wilkinson.  Enrollment and the establishment of colleges  The next concern for Wilkinson was increasing the enrollment of BYU. He instituted a program in which members of BYU faculty would travel with general authorities to stake conferences. They attended nearly 180 conferences, emphasizing the benefits of a BYU education. Enrollment increased by more than twenty-five percent in fall of 1952. After discontinuing the program in 1952, Wilkinson continued to recruit for BYU by sending representatives to high schools and church missions, which received some criticism from mission presidents and was terminated by the First Presidency shortly after. Despite the criticisms, Wilkinson's tactics were successful and enrollment increased to over 10,000 by the 1956–57 school year. Colleges were reorganized in order to group similar studies together and allow for the most growth and success of students. For example, the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Applied Sciences were broken into multiple colleges in 1954 including, but not limited to, the College of Biological and Agricultural Sciences and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences. The Department of Physical Education, Health, and Athletics was separated from the College of Education and established as its own college and the College of Education was forced to relinquish its monopoly on the training of teachers and made to be a college specific to teaching methods. Wilkinson improved the salaries of faculty in order to recruit more talented professors and staff members to BYU. The Army and Air Force ROTC program at BYU was established by Wilkinson in 1951 for the Air Force and 1968 for the Army. An engineering program with its own building was established by Wilkinson with the help of Harvey Fletcher, and in 1956, broke into three programs: civil, mechanical, and electrical. Wilkinson also established a College of Family Living in late 1951, alleged to be the first in the United States, however, Purdue University had opened a Department of Family Life in 1946.; In order to increase the size and quality of the graduate program at BYU, Wilkinson instituted a policy that encouraged faculty to pursue graduate studies at other universities. Through the policy, the university could obtain faculty qualified to teach graduate students as well as faculty who have attended other universities and thus obtained a more well-balanced education, preventing the \\"academic inbreeding\\" that had been a problem at the institution. The number of professors that held doctorates, especially from other universities, increased significantly. Building construction Wilkinson sought to increase the size and the beauty of the BYU campus. The first construction project during his presidency commenced July 1952. The Student Service Center, or unofficially, the bookstore, was dedicated in March 1953. After the planning committee devised a \\"master plan\\" for building and expansion of BYU campus, and the LDS Church appropriated $500,000 for the acquisition of more land in pursuit of the building projects proposed in the master plan. Wilkinson received ten million dollars from the Board of Trustees in order to build student housing and academic buildings. In order to accommodate more students, student housing was expanded. Heritage Halls were apartment-style dormitories that included a kitchen were built for girls, and Helaman Halls, which included a large dining hall, were built for men. With these additions, the number of women's accommodations increased to 2,000 students while the men's accommodations increased to 1,600 students. 150 homes were bought from the Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho and transported to Provo. Considered a fairly temporary solution, the complex was named Wyview Village and was intended to accommodate married students. Construction of the Harvey Fletcher Building was completed in 1953 in order to house the new engineering program, though other departments, namely the English department was allowed to share the space due to the lack of buildings. The David O. McKay Building was completed in 1954 for the College of Education. The college shared its walls with some other humanities disciplines until the campus was expanded more in later years. The Benjamin Cluff Jr. Building, along with two greenhouses, was built to house the laboratories for the College of Biological and Agricultural Sciences in 1955. These buildings were torn down for the new Life Science Building completed in 2014. The Howard S. McDonald Student Health Center, which also housed the Air Force ROTC program, was completed in 1955 and contained an x-ray room and a hydrotherapy room. A separate Student Health Center now exists. The Howard S. McDonald Building now contains BYU's MRI Research Facility. The Joseph F. Smith Family Living Center was built in 1957 to house the College of Family Living. Dedicated in 2005 and still home to the College of Family, Home and Social Sciences, the Joseph Fielding Smith Building took the place of the Family Living Center. A number of other smaller, miscellaneous buildings were built in the 1950s, including a ticket office for the football stadium and a poultry laboratory for the Animal Science Department. Significant effort was also put into improving the campus utilities and landscaping. The Department of Physical Plant was established in 1954. Due to the nearly seventy hours of work he was putting in per week, Wilkinson suffered a heart attack in October 1956. He was permitted to return to work in January 1957. Taylor, Edwards, and Berrett took over his responsibilities while he was recovering. =The Second Era: 1957-1971= Building construction With the continuous growth of the student body, Wilkinson understood the need to continue expanding campus. The first large project was the BYU Motion Picture Studio (now the LDS Motion Picture Studios), built in 1958. In 1961, At a cost of nearly $4,000,000, the J. Reuben Clark Jr. Library (now the HBLL) was built due to lack of library resources and space in the Heber J. Grant Library. The library was built to accommodate 3,000 people and house one million books. The Jesse Knight Building was completed in 1960 to house the College of Commerce. Plans were made in early 1960 for a new student center; student costs were raised by ten dollars each student to raise the funds for the project. The building cost $7 million, and two-thirds of the funds came directly from students. The building was six stories and contained a bookstore, cafeteria, two theaters, lounges, a bowling alley, and a barber shop. A consensus hadn't been reached on the name of the building. Students were interested in naming the building \\"Memorial Union\\" to honor BYU students killed in war. Shortly before the dedication, the Board of Trustees revealed they intended to name the building the Ernest L. Wilkinson Student Center. Although some students believed that they should have had the right to name the building since they paid for most of it, the Board of Trustees named the building after Wilkinson. During his presidency, church appropriations to the school increased from $1 million to $22 million annually, while university expenditures increased from $2 million to $65 million annually. The Honor Code Wilkinson felt that his job was to prevent the decay of moral values of the students and increase administrative control of the BYU Honor Code. He instituted a strict dress code meant to prevent students from dressing like \\"go-go girls\\" or \\"surfers\\". Women's skirts and dresses were required to be below the knee and they were prohibited from wearing pants. Upon protestation, female students achieved a small victory when they were permitted to wear slacks at the university's bowling alley. Men were required to keep their hair cut short. Wilkinson pushed to increase the social interaction among the students, believing that it would be facilitated if every student was required to wear a name tag. Due to the unpopularity of the plan among students, this was never enforced. Wilkinson attempted to weed out students who were not following the honor code, because he felt that they prevented other worthy students from attending the university. Wilkinson also instituted a rule against male facial hair with the exception of a small, well-trimmed mustache. The 1966 BYU spy ring controversy Extremely conservative and anti-communist, Wilkinson wasn't bashful in expressing his political philosophy to BYU students and faculty. After his unsuccessful run for U.S. Senate in 1964, he \\"returned to campus with a vengeance\\". Some of the employees publicly supported his opponent Sherman Lloyd in the primaries, which Wilkinson felt was disloyal. When he returned to BYU, he became aware of a group of \\"liberal\\" teachers who were interested in changing the social and political atmosphere at BYU. He invited right-wing speakers to BYU and gave highly political speeches on campus. Wilkinson gave a lengthy May 1965 commencement address in which he attributed the beginning of moral decay of American values to Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal as well as criticizing the current president Lyndon B. Johnson's views of social security. Hoping to incite controversy, Wilkinson planned to give another politically charged speech in April 1966. He asked his comptroller, Joseph Bentley, to find students to report on professors' reactions to the speech. Bentley in turn asked student Stephen Hays Russell to report on professors' reactions unofficially. The two made a list of professors to surveil, and Russell recruited ten students to take notes on what their professors said about Wilkinson's speech in their classes. Political science professor Ray Hillam was one of Bentley and Russell's targets. He was notified of the spy ring by one of his students and he requested a formal hearing be arranged. In the first hearing on September 15, presided over by vice presidents of the university, Hillam was formally charged for being pro-communist and disloyal to the university, with information gathered by the student spies used as evidence. Hillam rejected the charges and questioned the motives of all involved. The vice presidents formally issued a report on October 17. The report did not address that Hillam was the target of a spy ring, only accusing him of \\"minor indiscretions\\". Ronald Hankin, one of the students involved, went to local television and radio stations to inform them of the spying scandal and Wilkinson's involvement in it. Wilkinson admitted that he recruited students to report on faculty members in an official statement. In the official history of BYU, Wilkinson included information about the spy ring, but omitted any information that led him to appear guilty. End of presidency Wilkinson considered the most important accomplishment of his term as president to have been the organization of student wards and stakes. Wilkinson was the ninth Commissioner of Church Education of the LDS Church. During his tenure, he also bore the title \\"Administrator–Chancellor of the Unified Church Schools System\\". On April 21, 1966, Wilkinson gave an address to the student body of BYU, entitled \\"The Changing Nature of American Government from a Constitutional Republic to a Welfare State.\\" This was published in booklet form by Deseret Book Company. After McKay died in 1970, Neal A. Maxwell was named the new commissioner of CES. Wilkinson had relied on McKay as a buffer in interacting with Harold B. Lee, a senior member of the Board of Trustee with whom Wilkinson differed greatly in educational and administrative philosophies. Sensing a lack of support among the church leaders, Wilkinson resigned from his position as BYU president in mid-1970 and was released at the beginning of 1971. Even though he was no longer president, Wilkinson hoped to be involved in the establishment of the J. Reuben Clark Law School. Due to his domineering reputation, school officials were unsure that he should continue to be so closely involved in administration of BYU, so they asked him to edit the university's official centennial history. Published in 1976, Brigham Young University: The First One Hundred Years was composed of four volumes. Death Wilkinson died of a heart attack April 6, 1978. Before he died, he had been supervising the work on his biography, Ernest L. Wilkinson: Indian Advocate and University President.; LDS Church service In the early 1930s, Wilkinson served as branch president in New York and Queens, and later, bishop of the Queens Ward. His colleagues in the Hughes law firm called him the \\"Bishop of Wall Street\\". In 1940, he served as second counselor to Ezra Taft Benson in the presidency of the Washington Stake and as first counselor from 1944 to 1948 to a later president of the stake. He represented the church on the General Commission for Chaplains of the Army and Navy. Legacy During the twenty years of Wilkinson's presidency at BYU, the student body increased from 4,004 students in 1951 to over 25,000 in 1971. The university went from having five colleges with 37 departments to 13 colleges with 71 departments. The number of faculty members increased by from 244 to 932, while the number of them holding a doctoral degree increased from 50 to more than 500. The first associate and doctoral programs were organized. The quarter system was changed to the semester system. The number of resources in the library increased by 500%. The number of buildings increased from six permanent buildings to 254 permanent buildings and 85 temporary buildings, an increase from 800,000 to 5 million square feet of floor space. After 1972, student housing could accommodate almost 6,000 students, an increase from the 1,200 student accommodations in 1951. The achievement Wilkinson was most proud of was the creation of student wards and stakes. In 1951, there was one branch for LDS students and in 1971, there were 98 wards and 10 stakes for LDS students.;  Notes   References  *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *.

During his presidency, the board of trustees approved a master of theology program. Enrollment at BYU greatly increased after World War II, and McDonald petitioned the board of trustees to build many buildings, including the Eyring Science Center. McDonald helped establish the student health center and student wards. He discouraged students from smoking and drinking. He left BYU because of his strained relationship with the board of trustees. McDonald was president of Los Angeles State College (now known as California State University, Los Angeles) and Los Angeles City College in 1949. In 1958, Los Angeles City College received its own president as a junior college. McDonald helped found San Fernando State College (now known as California State University, Northridge) in 1956, and was president of the general faculty until 1958. He helped to formally organize the colleges, recruit more faculty, build more buildings, and petition the state of California for funds. Early life and education The Howard S. McDonald building at Brigham Young University McDonald was born in Holladay, Utah on July 18, 1894, to Francis McDonald and Rozella Stevenson. He attended the first LDS Seminary, the Granite High School Seminary. He served as a missionary in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints (LDS Church) in the Eastern States Mission, which was headquartered in New York City. He spent part of his mission as president of the Western Pennsylvania Conference headquartered in Pittsburgh. While serving in this area he met Ella Gibbs, a woman serving as a missionary who was the first Relief Society president in Pittsburgh. Ella was later transferred to Baltimore. After both returned from their missions, McDonald courted Ella Gibbs. They married in the Salt Lake Temple on September 26, 1917. They had two daughters. In 1918, McDonald served in the 163rd Artillery Brigade in France. Following his military service, he graduated from Utah State Agricultural College in 1924 in architectural engineering. He taught advanced mathematics at Utah State Agricultural College during the chairman's sabbatical. Teaching career Franklin Harris asked him to head BYU's engineering department in 1924, but McDonald declined, stating that he was unqualified for the position. He taught math and physical education part-time at Mission High School while studying at the University of California, Berkeley. He received his M.A. from there in 1925. In 1928 he was vice- principal and dean of boys at Balboa High School, and 1934–1936 he was director of personnel in the San Francisco School District, becoming superintendent in 1937. From 1944–45, McDonald was superintendent of schools in Salt Lake City, Utah. He instituted the 12-year system and successfully campaigned for better funding for public schools. In 1949 he completed a Doctorate of Education, also from the University of California. President of BYU =Importance of religious studies= McDonald became president of Brigham Young University in 1945. At McDonald's request, he had meetings directly with the board of trustees, not receiving their instructions through a commissioner of church schools. Unlike with his previous administrative roles, the board of trustees wanted more input over the details of administration compared to the boards of public school districts, who were happy to defer administrative details to McDonald. Additionally, the board selected McDonald as president because they believed McDonald could bring a stronger religious emphasis to the school with his ecclesiastical leadership background. Initially the board of trustees asked McDonald to prepare to close BYU, but McDonald convinced them of the LDS Church's need for BYU. Joseph Fielding Smith was particularly concerned with the education of institute teachers, which he felt was best done at a church-owned institution. Religious studies at BYU were a great source for seminary instruction materials and training for seminary teachers. However, religious instructors had previously focused on encouraging students to live righteous lives rather than on intellectually engaging with religious ideas. John A. Widtsoe advised against forming a graduate school separate from the rest of BYU, stating there were fears that an overly scholarly school of divinity could create unorthodox graduates. In 1949, the board of trustees approved a master of theology degree and encouraged graduates to study elsewhere for their doctorate. =Sudden increase in enrollment= Enrollment more than doubled in the winter and fall semesters as veterans from World War II came home and enrolled at BYU. His administration received surplus military buildings from the Federal Public Housing Authority in San Francisco to house the huge influx of students, and they began to build permanent buildings to replace them. McDonald initiated the construction of several new buildings to alleviate the intense crowding at the university. He petitioned the board of trustees for approval to build a large science building, partially planned by Dean Eyring. The planned building was larger than the five largest buildings on campus combined. While some members of the board disliked the proposal, Joseph Fielding Smith championed the project. In 1945, the projected cost was around $300,000, and the board approved a budget of $950,000. The final cost of the Eyring Science Center was over 2 million dollars. Enrollment in the College of Arts and Sciences increased five percent. Construction on other buildings was suspended because of the high cost of the science building, and in 1947 several physical education instructors resigned because of \\"unfavorable working conditions,\\" and the board of trustees considered abandoning sports programs altogether. Other in-progress building projects were heavily delayed. The board of trustees approved plans for the Smith Fieldhouse, which was completed in 1951. Instructors at the time often taught over thirteen hours per week. McDonald recruited more professors to teach the more numerous student body, including Hugh Nibley and M. Wells Jakeman. He petitioned to increase professors' salaries to make positions more attractive, and over 80 professors were hired during his administration. He created a dean of student life position to organize student services, and gave more responsibility to department chairs, college deans, and their assistants, who conveyed faculty requests and ideas to him. Ernest Wilkinson suggested that BYU increase the cost of tuition, and McDonald agreed with the idea, but stated that the First Presidency did not wish to burden students with more expensive tuition, despite their anxiety about the LDS Church's increased cost in enrolling so many more students. The cost to educate each student increased by $55 from 1944 to 1946, and faculty requested and received raises to combat postwar inflation. =Changes to student life= In 1946, McDonald organized a student health plan with Vasco Tanner as the chair on the committee. Full-time doctors were employed through a $10 contribution from each student. The student health center was named after him. He developed a character recommendation required for new applicants to the university to be sure that university attendees conform to the standards of the LDS Church. Also in 1946, McDonald made efforts to stop students from smoking and drinking. He gave students three months to change their habits. He also called for more strict adherence to curfew. In Amanda Knight Hall, doors were locked on the outside and inside after curfew, causing one woman to publicly protest the policy as dangerous in the case of an emergency. In 1947, McDonald helped establish student branches, with student leaders. This helped create a more intimate atmosphere for church services, as previous Sunday school classes could exceed 100 students at a time. =Leaving BYU= McDonald constantly requested additional funding, including emotional appeals, which strained his relationship with the board of trustees. J. Reuben Clark, then a counselor in the first presidency, was also unhappy with McDonald's performance as president of BYU and harshly rebuked his behavior; as tension grew McDonald began looking for another job. In 1949, McDonald left BYU to become president of Los Angeles City College and Los Angeles State College. Educational administrator in California When McDonald became president of both Los Angeles City College and Los Angeles State College, they were housed in borrowed spaces with part-time faculty. He hired administrators to help him formally organize the colleges. He found a site within LA to house the new Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences, which replaced the Los Angeles State College in 1949. He recruited faculty, petitioned the California state government for more funds, and met with the state architect to plan buildings. The college opened in its new location in 1958. When McDonald retired in 1962, seven buildings on the new campus were completed. The Los Angeles City College remained as a junior college under John Lombardi in 1958. College students in California began to protest the loyalty oaths that faculty in California state colleges were compelled to make in 1950. After prohibiting the student executive council at the Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences from discussing the issue, they resigned in protest. After negotiations, McDonald rescinded the ban on discussing the loyalty oaths and the student executive council returned. He helped found San Fernando Valley State College in 1956, where he was president of the general faculty 1956–1958. He retired in 1962 and was appointed as a regional representative of the US Commissioner of Education, a position he held until 1964. LDS Church service McDonald served as a member of the San Francisco stake high council, a member of the stake presidency, and as stake president. In 1943, McDonald asked to be released as stake president so he could continue pursuing his doctoral studies. Fifteen years after leaving as BYU president, he returned to Utah and served as president of the LDS Church's Salt Lake Temple from 1964 to 1968. References External links *Howard S.

Avon Books) Cover artist: Ron Walotsky Cluster is a series of science fiction novels by Piers Anthony. Anthony originally conceived of and wrote the series as a trilogy but later added two additional volumes. Setting As the series opens, humanity has colonized an area of the galaxy roughly 100 light years in diameter. This area is called Sphere Sol, as it is the sphere of influence of the race from the star Sol, that is, the Sun. Sphere Sol's \\"neighborhood\\" is also home to other spheres, each centered around a particular star: Spheres Polaris, Canopus, Spica, Nath, Mirzam, and Bellatrix as well as the huge, decadent Spheres Sador and Mintaka. In the Cluster setting, races colonize other planets in three ways. The first is through instantaneous teleportation, called matter transmission or mattermission. This, however, is prohibitively expensive. Second, colonists travel to new worlds in \\"freezer\\" ships, where they are cryonically stored for the decades it takes for the voyage. Half of those frozen are lost due to failures either of the containment units or the ships themselves. The third and most common method of colonist travel is via lifeships, slower but safer multigenerational vessels that may take centuries to reach their destination. The drawback of the lifeships is that as they plod through space, their occupants regress in technical sophistication. In part due to this, and perhaps because colony worlds with small populations cannot support sophisticated social constructs, all spheres in the Cluster series suffer spherical regression—i.e., the farther a colony is from its home star, the less technology the inhabitants use, while the social order begins to resemble periods of the home planet's past. For instance, the inhabitants of Outworld, Sphere Sol's farthest colony, are paleolithic tribes. They hunt with flint spears and make fire, but their society has little technology beyond that level. Spherical regression does not create true copies of Earth or any world's past, however. Colonists know they are part of an interstellar empire, and they are aware of the technological and social differences on other planets. Furthermore, the home world mattermits some government and security personnel to all colony worlds. Therefore, individual students of history can often use their knowledge of the home world's past to make their own planets more or less primitive than one would expect when simply calculating the distance from the home star. =Kirlian transfer= The central plot mechanism of the Cluster novels is that of transfer. Every living thing has a Kirlian aura that can be measured. Through transfer, the mind and personality of individuals with high aura can be sent to animate a body physically distant. For instance, a transferee living on Earth could be sent to Outworld and inhabit the body of one of that planet's stone-age tribesmen. Transfer is a refinement of mattermission technology, but because only the aura is transferred, it is substantially less expensive. In the first three novels, the protagonists find themselves transferring from alien body to alien body in order to combat threats from elsewhere in space. =Thousandstar and Viscous Circle= These later novels take place between Chaining the Lady and Kirlian Quest. While the original Cluster trilogy tells epic stories of galactic scope, the later two books are smaller stories in the same setting. Instead of transferring to different worlds with each chapter, the protagonists spend almost the full novel on a single planet. See further details below. Relationship with other novels Anthony first conceived of the Cluster series when writing But What of Earth?, a speculative novel in which the government discovers the secret of mattermission, making interstellar colonization feasible. Earth? follows developments on humanity's home planet as its civilization and resources dwindle when half the population leaves for the colony worlds. The Cluster series takes place roughly 500 years further in the future and is in continuity with Anthony's original manuscript of Earth?, published in an annotated edition by Tor Books in 1989. The Cluster series is not necessarily consistent with the first published version of Earth?, the heavily reworked 1976 Laser Books edition credited to Anthony and Robert Coulson as collaborators. According to Anthony this was an unauthorized collaboration. More detail can be found on Anthony's main page. After completing the original Cluster trilogy, Anthony returned to the earlier time frame. His three-volume Tarot series featured Brother Paul of the Holy Order of Vision, a major supporting character in Earth?, and is set some years after that earlier novel. At the same time Anthony wrote the two additional Cluster novels, Thousandstar and Viscous Circle. Series synopsis =Cluster (1977)Also known as Vicinity Cluster in the UK.= As the story opens, the alien envoy Pnotl of Sphere Knyfh attempts to enlist the cooperation of Sphere Sol in a mutual crisis of galactic proportion: Galaxy Andromeda has discovered the secret of energy transfer and intends to use it to steal the basic energy of the Milky Way Galaxy. Knyfh proposes to give Sphere Sol the secret of transfer—the ability to transfer an individual's Kirlian aura (and thus his entire mind and personality) into another \\"host.\\" In exchange for this priceless knowledge, Knyfh and other Spheres request that Sphere Sol spread the technology to its neighboring Spheres, creating a galactic coalition in which all minor spheres will patrol their own regions to find and weed out Andromedan agents. Kirlian transfer, a technology known to the mysterious vanished culture known as The Ancients, is a millionth the effective cost of mattermission and has been sought for decades. This knowledge is proven by Pnotl himself, who pleads his case while hosted in a human body, and the government of Sol agrees to the plan. Because a hosted aura fades at the rate of about 1 unit per Earth day, higher-Kirlian individuals last longer and thus have more freedom of movement. Sphere Sol's highest-Kirlian individual at the time is Flint, a green-skinned native of Outworld, Sphere Sol's most distant planet. Flint has a Kirlian aura of 200, an eidetic memory (useful for memorizing the complex equations of Kirlian transfer that he will need to communicate to other Spheres), extraordinary intelligence, and is highly adaptable. His mission is complicated, however, by the fact that he is pursued everywhere by a very high Kirlian female Andromedan agent—somehow the Andromedans are able to detect and trace Kirlian transfers. Flint embarks upon several missions to bring transfer technology to neighboring Spheres, inhabiting various alien forms and learning much about alien sex, among other things. His efforts are successful despite a couple of false starts and the efforts of the Andromedan agent to prevent or kill him. In the process, the mutual attraction of their two vastly superior auras begin to create a conflict of loyalties. Upon discovery and investigation of an archaeological site of the Ancients in the Pleiades, Flint and a group of other non-Sol entities recover the information that will allow them also to detect and trace transfers, giving them parity with Andromeda. One of the group is revealed as the Andromedan agent and in an attempt to prevent her escape, the entire site is destroyed. Flint and his nemesis are, through the mechanism of the Ancient site, transferred into Mintakan bodies. Choosing to leave things as they are, with parity between their two galaxies, Flint and the Andromedan mate and remain together until their auras fade (which happens rapidly since their physical bodies have been destroyed). =Chaining the Lady (1978)= The book opens with the discovery that Andromeda, the enemy galaxy of the first novel, has discovered the secret of involuntary hosting: a sufficiently higher- Kirlian aura can in effect possess an individual of a lower-Kirlian aura. This has enabled Andromeda to secretly infiltrate the highest levels of government in Sphere Sol and its allies and resurrect its plot to steal the energy of the Milky Way. Melody of Mintaka, a direct descendant of Flint of Outworld and his Andromedan nemesis, has a Kirlian aura of well over 200. She is pressed into service to \\"possess\\" and interrogate a captured Andromedan transferee. Melody, hosted in the young and beautiful body of Yael of Dragon, must like her ancestor Flint find a way to defeat the Andromedan threat and save the galaxy. The mysterious Ancients are present again in the form of their artifacts and sites. The themes of Tarot and of various myths of Sphere Sol (in this case that of Perseus and Andromeda) are carried throughout this novel as well—for example, the interSphere fleet of starships has forms analogous to the Tarot suits of Disks, Cups, Wands and Swords. =Kirlian Quest (1978)= For a thousand years Sphere / of Andromeda was cursed by the other spheres because a representative, Llume of /, betrayed Andromeda during the Second War of Energy. As Kirlian Quest opens, a new threat has appeared on the horizon: the Space Amoeba, a fleet of alien ships one million strong, whose intentions are definitely hostile. Herald the Healer, aural (but not literal) descendant of Flint and Melody, who is a / of Andromeda, has the chance to redeem his species' honor and save the galaxy, but in order to do so he must solve the riddle of the Space Amoeba and of the Ancients themselves. = Thousandstar (1980)= A new Ancient Site has been discovered, and unlike others which are \\"dead\\" this one appears to be active and functioning. To determine which Sphere has the right to explore it and investigate its secrets, a competition is being held. Each competing team consists of a carefully matched host and transferee pair, chosen for their complementary skills and knowledge. The tasks test all of the competitors' abilities to their limit and range from word puzzles to navigating past a black hole. However, both Heem of Highfalls and his transferee Jessica of Capella have deep dark secrets that may cost them not just the competition but their lives. =Viscous Circle (1982)= Viscous Circle is a story about a strange and inhuman race of beings and an experimental attempt to transfer into creatures that seem only slightly sapient. They are ultimate pacifists that take the form of magnetic disks that float through space and simply demagnetize and destroy themselves when faced with an unpleasant thought.

He is also a former sumo wrestler.  Sumo career  He made his sumo debut in March 1988, after leaving junior high school. He joined at the same time as future yokozuna Takanohana and Wakanohana. He initially trained at the same stable as these two, Futagoyama-beya, but when former yokozuna Takanosato branched off to set up Naruto-beya in March 1989, Inoue was one of the young recruits to follow him to the new stable. He also changed his shikona, or fighting name, from Futagozakura to Rikio. In July 1993 he was promoted to the second highest jūryō division, becoming the first wrestler from Naruto stable to reach elite sekitori status. He was demoted from that division after just one tournament, but returned to jūryō in May 1994 and was promoted to the top makuuchi division in July 1996 after winning his second jūryō yūshō, or tournament championship. In September 1997 he was promoted to his highest rank of maegashira 4, but he did not take part in the tournament. This was initially said to be due to a liver disorder, but it was later revealed that relations with his stablemaster had broken down, and Rikio was forced to retire from sumo. Due to the dispute he was unable to have a formal retirement ceremony, but some of his friends in the sumo world organised an informal one for him in early 1998, with Akebono and Konishiki among the attendees.  Professional wrestling career  After leaving sumo he was soon spotted by All Japan Pro Wrestling. After training in their dojo, he made his debut in 2000 in a tag team match in which he partnered Masao Inoue against Takeshi Morishima and Jun Akiyama. However, before he could build any momentum, Mitsuharu Misawa left AJPW and in the process, took most of the native talent with Rikio being among these talents. In Pro Wrestling Noah, he has seen much success. He dethroned the legendary Kenta Kobashi for the GHC Heavyweight Championship (at the end of this match Rikio can be seen sobbing as he accepts the title from Kobashi.), ending his two-year reign, before losing the title to Akira Taue some time later. On June 4, 2006, he captured his second GHC Tag Team Championship with Jun Akiyama when he pinned Muhammad Yone after a Musou. However, Rikio and Akiyama were forced to vacate their title on September 25, 2006 after Rikio suffered a neck injury. On November 27, 2011, Rikio announced his retirement from professional wrestling due to serious neck injuries.

His administration was the longest in BYU history and saw the granting of the first master's degrees. Under his administration the school became an accredited university. He set up several colleges, such as the College of Fine and Performing Arts with Gerrit De Jong as the founding dean. Harris was an agricultural scientist, holding a doctorate in agronomy from Cornell University. He had served as the agriculture department head and head of the experiment station at Utah State Agricultural College and left BYU to become president of that institution. Harris also traveled to Russia, Iran, and the Middle East in order to provide expert advice on agriculture issues. The Harris Fine Arts Center on BYU's Provo campus was named after him.  Early life  Harris was born in Benjamin, Utah Territory, United States.Jenson, Andrew. \\"HARRIS, Franklin Stewart,\\" Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret News Press, 1936) Vol 4, p. 240 In the 1890s his family moved to the Mormon colonies in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. Harris did his early studies at BYU, taking a year to teach at Utah State Agricultural College, before going on to receive his doctorate from Cornell. After Cornell, Harris traveled back to Logan to become a professor of agronomy and an agronomist at Utah State Agricultural College (USAC). In 1920, Harris was working as director of the Utah State Agricultural Experiment Station and was also head of the department of zoology and Entomology at USAC. Although he held these administrative positions at USAC and was already the president of the American Society of Agronomy, Harris accepted the General Church Board of Education's offer of the BYU presidency on April 22, 1921. He was the first non-polygamous president of Brigham Young University. As president of a university =Brigham Young University= Before officially becoming president of BYU, Harris began to encourage college's development. He submitted a plan of organization that suggested adding the Extension and Research Division to the university, which was approved. He also began to recruit professors who had completed their doctorate degrees as well as well-known Latter-day Saint scholars to join the faculty at BYU. As president his first year, Harris hired five faculty members with PhDs and required all new faculty to possess at least a master's degree. Janet Jenson, author of The Many Lives of Franklin S. Harris, wrote: \\"The most significant and enduring accomplishment of Franklin S. Harris was his leadership in transforming what was essentially a high school with a small collegiate division into a university\\". Harris recognized that the combination of high school students and university students was hurting the scholarship of the college and organized the high school and college into separate buildings. His second year as president, Harris attempted to get BYU accredited with the Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools; BYU became recognized as a four-year college but was not given the status of university. Harris then requested accreditation with the Association of American Universities, \\"but BYU failed to meet the criteria in student entrance requirements, coursework, faculty credentials, or research funds\\". In 1928, BYU was finally accepted as a member of the Association of American Universities. Harris instituted special lectures on campus from LDS General Authorities relating to a variety of different topics such as religion, science, and industry. He also instituted the school's radio program with extended broadcasting to all inter-mountain states. President Harris contributed to the Improvement Era, the LDS Church magazine, along with other important members of the BYU administration. He also took the initiative to visit different parts of the continental United States such as Hawaii and other countries like Japan in order to share information about his studies of soil alkali. Prompted by these trips, Harris extended his international experience in order to travel around the world for his expertise in agronomy. He not only shared his own educational knowledge at universities but gathered information about the practices of other educational institutions around the world. Harris believed that university education should prepare students for community leadership. Harris oversaw the founding of the College of Fine Arts and viewed the enjoyment of the arts as vital to living a rich life. The first building constructed on BYU campus during Harris's administration was the Heber J. Grant building. Its first purpose was as the university's library. The building was dedicated in 1925. Harris wanted Brigham Young University to become a center of religious scholarship and advocated acquiring a broad spectrum of religious books in the library. Just as the BYU presidents before him, Harris continued to differentiate and better organize the different collegiate subjects at the university and to separate the colleges, the normal school, and the training schools. The university continued to struggle financially through Harris' presidency. This, coupled with the Great Depression in the 1930s, alienated Harris from the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees were slow to approve funds to the university. Instead of waiting, Harris would pay for campus expansions with the profits from the student bookstore without telling the Board of Trustees. Over time, Harris grew tired of debating with the board over financial programs he deemed important. He also struggled with J. Reuben Clark, Jr. who wanted a \\"purging of heretical faculty.\\" Harris gave his resignation to the board in 1944 in order to become the president of Utah State Agricultural College. =Utah State University= On November 20th, 1944 Harris was offered the position of president at Utah State Agricultural College. He met with the USAC board of trustees on November 25 to be appointed president effective July 1, 1945. Harris began his career at USAC with the difficult task of finding funds for new buildings. USAC buildings were old and run down, additionally, the influx of students attending USAC after World War II led to a space problem as capacity was already limited on campus. With World War II ending, Harris was able to acquire temporary buildings from military bases that were being dismantled. In 1948 he received approval from the board to rent Cache Valley Hospital as a dorm. Harris also worked to provide new, permanent buildings on campus. He continued to follow his agronomist pursuits and in 1950 he spent the month of January as a consultant to the United States State Department. Harris continued as USAC's president until 1955.  Politics  In 1938 friends of Harris encouraged him to run for the Senate. He started campaigning when J. Reuben Clark Jr. told him the First Presidency wanted Harris to run for United States Senate. With fall approaching and school starting again Harris had little time to campaign, however, Harris won the primary election and became the Republican candidate for senator. Harris ran on an anti-New Deal platform. He eventually lost the election to Elbert D. Thomas. Harris ran for governor of Utah in 1948. He won the third most votes at the Republican state convention but did not make it on to the primary ticket. By August he decided to give his support to Mabey, another candidate running for governor at the time. Other LDS church service In June 1925 Harris was made a member of the General Board of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association (YMMIA) and remained affiliated with the association until November 1948. He served as a missionary in Japan in 1926. The following year he served a short mission among the Latter-day Saints in Syria. After returning from foreign trips, Harris would often speak in LDS sacrament meetings detailing his experiences. Harris was never an LDS General Authority but did receive some of their privileges. He was given an assigned seat with his name on it to attend general conference. Harris' church service was often combined with his job as president of Brigham Young University. He often taught religious classes and attended church school conventions. On his second trip to Iran in 1950, Harris became the branch president of Tehran. The branch started out with nine members but eventually reached thirty-five individuals. International work =Russia= The International Coordination of Revolutionary Parties and Organizations (ICOR) was established by pro-Soviet Americans in order to develop agricultural settlements in Soviet territory specifically for Jews. In 1928 one of the journalists involved with the ICOR, Leon Talmy, invited Franklin Harris to Russia in order to evaluate the area of Birobidzhan where the creation of a Jewish autonomous district had just been approved. In 1929, Harris traveled to the Soviet Union as chairman of a commission appraising the territory. In July 1929 the commission began searching in Birobidzhan to see if it could agriculturally sustain a large population. Harris spent two months \\"evaluating the territory for agricultural development.\\" The commission met with Alexei Rykov, chairman of the Council of Ministers as well as Jewish community leaders. Upon Harris' return to the United States, he traveled back to Utah by train in order to stop and speak in many cities about Birobidzhan and rally support for its progress. Harris wrote to Talmy for a time but eventually lost touch. He \\"regarded his trip to Birobidzhan as a highlight of his professional career.\\" The commission's work on the agricultural potential of Birobidzhan would later help in forming the Jewish Autonomous Oblast in 1934. =Iran= In March 1939 Harris was asked by the United States Department of Agriculture to consider working with the Iranian government in order to reorganize Iran's Department of Agriculture. Harris and his wife left for Iran the next month. Upon arrival, Harris became the agricultural adviser to the Shah, Reza Shah, and the Iran government in 1939. Harris' first project was to inspect the structure and performance of the agricultural college in Karaj. He also studied Iran's forestry problem while working to improve Iran's Department of Agriculture. After a year contract Harris returned to Provo to manage BYU as its president. His relationships in Iran attracted Iranian students to the United States and specifically to Utah to study. On March 10, 1950 Harris was asked by the Office of Foreign Agricultural Relations of the United States Department of Agriculture if he would be head the United States international technical collaboration program part of Truman's Point Four program in Iran. That July Harris and his wife returned to Iran where he worked in the United States embassy and at the Iranian Ministry of Agriculture. Esfahanak, Markazi was chosen as the first demonstration site for the Point Four program. The village of Esfahanak had continually struggled in agriculture, education, and health. A drain was dug to reduce mosquito- breeding water and old buildings were repaired to become schools. In 1951 Harris helped relocate funds from the Point Four program for emergency aid as a large plague of locusts couldn't be controlled through local methods. The Point Four program created confusion as to who was supposed to oversee work in Iran. Harris became the program's technical director and worked to get the Point Four program operating. Of Harris' two-year contract in Iran it took a year to sign the Point Four program into action. Harris also served as the president of the LDS Church branch headquartered in Tehran, as reported in the October 1951 general conference. =Middle East= In 1945 Harris was asked to lead a three-man mission to the Middle East by the United States Department of State and Agriculture. The purpose of the mission was to help survey foreign agricultural situations and provide \\"American agricultural experience\\" to the Middle East. The first stop was Egypt where the group focused on diplomatic activities. The mission traveled through Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Greece surveying agricultural conditions. Back in the United States Harris gave a speech to the Institute of World Affairs in December 1948 where he addressed his recommendations for Middle Eastern advancement. He believed educating the area's population on agricultural improvement would sustain agriculture in these countries as well as provide new developments to maintain and preserve water. Later years, death, and legacy At age 65, in 1949, Harris attempted to retire as president of USAC, however, the board asked him to stay one more year. By the end of the next year Harris had agreed to return to Iran in order to implement the Point Four program. He was 68 when he officially retired. Board of trustee members and BYU presidents sought Harris' advice in his later years. Harris had a mild stroke the day after Christmas 1954 and in January 1956 experienced another. This ended his public career after which he kept mostly to himself and family. He suffered another stroke in 1960 and died seven days later on April 18th. =Legacy= In his third year as BYU president he was awarded the \\"Supreme Honor Man of the Student Body\\" by the student body president. As a gift, the graduating class of 1935 commissioned his portrait to be painted by Lee Greene Richards. In 1964 the Franklin S. Harris Fine Arts Center was inaugurated and named after Harris because of his support for the Fine Arts while president of BYU. After his twenty-four years as president of BYU, Harris also became known as \\"Mr. BYU.\\" During BYU's 1998 Homecoming week on Founders Day, October 6th, Harris was honored as the \\"right man.\\" Publications Some of the publications of Franklin S.

After graduating from Brigham Young Academy (BYA), Brimhall served as principal of Spanish Fork schools and then as district superintendent of Utah County schools, finally returning to BYU. In April 1904, Brimhall became president of the school, which had become BYU in October 1903. As president of BYU, Brimhall helped institute the collegiate program, departments for specific subjects, and an emphasis on religious learning.Ernest L. Wilkinson, ed., Brigham Young University: The First 100 Years. (Provo: BYU Press, 1975) Vol. 1, p. 331-521. Early life Brimhall was born to George W. Brimhall and Rachel Ann Meyer in Salt Lake City. When Brimhall was about a year old his family moved to Ogden and then moved to Spanish Fork, which is where Brimhall attended \\"Timpanogos University\\". Because of his family's financial situation, one semester they gave the school a side of beef to pay for his tuition. After working closely with instructor George Carson at a Spanish Fork common school, he moved back to Spanish Fork, became a teacher, and received a county teachers certificate. In 1874, Brimhall married Alsina Elizabeth Wilkins. They were the parents of 6 children. Early career While in Spanish Fork, Brimhall was involved with the city's civil affairs. He became city marshal in 1875, but only for a short period of time and was later appointed as \\"auditor of accounts\\" for 2 terms. He also organized a literary and debate society and helped build a schoolhouse called \\"The Young Men's Academy\\". He eventually became principal of the academy. After being involved in most of the educational events in Utah County, Brimhall became interested in BYA and decided to begin attending in 1876. In 1877, Brimhall graduated from Maeser school, but often struggled to get good scores on teacher examinations and other academic assessments. In 1883, Brimhall was elected as the district superintendent of Utah County schools and oversaw many other educational programs in Utah County and in Salt Lake City. He worked closely with Warren Newton Dusenberry, who was an instructor at BYA. Brimhall also worked with the Sunday School organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and taught classes for the church's Young Men Mutual Improvement Association. He published some articles in the Contributor Magazine and was on the local board of examiners. He eventually moved from Spanish Fork to Provo in order to take his place as head of the Provo community schools. In 1890, Abraham O. Smoot invited Brimhall to be a part of the faculty at BYA as a church calling. Through BYA and with special instruction from Benjamin Cluff, Brimhall was finally able to complete a college degree, while simultaneously heading the Intermediate Department and Preparatory School. When Cluff became BYA's principal , Brimhall took his place as head of the Normal Department, but continued in his position over the Training School as well. Then in 1894, Cluff returned to Michigan to complete his graduate work and left Joseph B. Keeler and Brimhall as co-acting principals of BYA. Both Brimhall and Keller had desires to follow Cluff's example and go east to study, but because Keller had been at BYA longer, he was permitted to go east first. Because of this delay in Brimhall's education, he would never again have such an interest in pursuing higher education. This became one of the greatest weaknesses of his administration. In 1897, Brimhall was called by John W. Taylor to serve a month-long mission in Colorado. While in Colorado, Brimhall became ill, along with others he contracted continued the rest of his life. When he returned to BYA after his mission, he continued to work closely with Cluff. They worked to persuade the state legislature to recognize the BYA Normal School. He also worked closely with church leaders in Salt Lake City and in 1898 he became an official member of the Church Board of Education. BYA acting president When Cluff left on an expedition to South America, Brimhall was appointed as the temporary superintendent of the LDS Church's schools and acting president of BYA. As acting president, Brimhall encountered many obstacles, especially with the funding of the school and the proposed Church University which threatened the existence of the Academy. Eventually, Brimhall was able to successfully secure enough money to construct a building for BYA's Training School and from the generous donations of the Jesse Knight family and colleagues, a new Central Building for BYA was built. Brimhall served on the high council of the Utah Stake during this time. Because BYA was being closely watched by the Board of Education and resources were scarce, Brimhall took it upon himself to ensure the success of the students. He began a class to help local parents with childcare, gave emphasis to the importance of student assemblies and clubs, and sent students and faculty to local LDS meetinghouses to speak about the value of education and about BYA. He also gave much of his attention to finding excellent speakers for BYA's summer school and often found himself in the classrooms at the school lecturing and helping individual students with their educational pursuits. Because of this workload, many of Brimhall's past illnesses began to manifest themselves again. Luckily, a couple months after the illness took hold of Brimhall, Cluff returned from South America and was able to take on the responsibilities that Brimhall had been shouldering at BYA. In April 1902, Brimhall went to California to recuperate. The year after Cluff returned, the institution's name was officially changed from BYA to BYU. BYU president In December 1903, the board met to appoint a new president for BYU. Brimhall and Keeler, who had served as co-presidents together during Cluff's absence, were the two main candidates. The votes were evenly divided between the two until Stephen L. Chipman decided to vote in favor of Brimhall, breaking the tie. On 16 April 1904, Brimhall was unanimously elected as president of BYU. Following the pattern of LDS Church leadership, the board requested that BYU, Latter-day Saints University, and Brigham Young College appoint a presidency for their respective institutions. Brimhall appointed Keeler and Edwin S. Hinckley as members of the BYU presidency. Just as in past years, the first couple years of Brimhall's presidency were met with financial problems. The church allocated more funds for BYU than any other of the schools supported by its funding, but it still was not enough money to cover BYU's expenses. Brimhall continued to support the BYU athletics programs, just as his predecessor, Cluff, had done. During Brimhall's presidency, the Training School Building gymnasium was constructed and because football had been banned by the board, the school focused on basketball, baseball, and track. Brimhall was known for his influential speeches that were able to evoke both positive and negative emotions from the students and faculty. He was also known for his outgoing and talkative nature, which helped him secure friends who could come to his aid for emotional and financial hardships. In 1907, BYU applied to be the official LDS Church university and Brimhall pushed for grants in order to fund the construction of BYU's first university facility. The application to build the facility (now known as the Maeser Building) was approved by the board and BYU was the church's official university for a short time, but because of heated discussions among other Utah educators the board decided to keep all of the church's schools at the same status for the time being. However, BYU was recognized as the LDS Church Teacher's College, which accelerated its increase in prestige among other known universities. During Brimhall's time as BYU president, he helped organize the collegiate program into separate departments in order to increase concentration of certain subject. Class credits were better defined and a more defined separation of high school and college was put into place. That same year, Brimhall permitted students to paint the letters \\"B\\", \\"Y\\", and \\"U\\" on the mountain nearest to campus, but because of limited time and resources, the \\"Y\\" was the only letter put on the mountain. The mountain that the students painted is now called \\"Y Mountain\\" In 1908, students built a concrete retaining wall around the Y. The Maeser building was completed in 1911, but leading up to its completion, Brimhall took it upon himself to invest more in the school just as many students and faculty members had done monetarily for the new university building. In order to achieve the goals that he had set for BYU, Brimhall recruited educators who had degrees from prestigious universities in the East. These educators helped facilitate the organization of the departments and curriculum of the collegiate program. Many controversial topics relating to modernism were introduced to the school through faculty, which caused quite a stir at BYU. After a group of students approached Brimhall and let them know that they were questioning their belief in God because of their exposure to false doctrine, Brimhall and Horace H. Cummings (who was superintendent of the church's schools), decided to approach the board with the hopes of setting a precedent for what could be taught at BYU. After a hearing in front of the board, Ralph Vary Chamberlin, Joseph Peterson, and Henry Peterson, who advocated evolution, biblical criticism and historical criticism were to be dispensed from their teaching positions unless they would change their teachings.Bowen, Craig H. (1995). Academic Freedom and the Utah Controversies of 1911 and 1915, Unpublished Master's thesis, J. Willard Marriott Library Special Collections, University of Utah, Salt Lake City. This caused many in the press and members of other church institutions to question the church's authority to regulate professor's freedom of speech in the classroom. A similar controversy at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City — what Brimhall himself at the time described as 'a tempest in a teapot' — erupted four years later in February 1915. There, the dismissals of two professors and two instructors by Joseph T. Kingsbury — and the subsequent resignations of 14 faculty members in protest (including Peterson, who earlier had resigned from BYU) — launched the American Association of University Professors' (AAUP) first institutional academic freedom inquest, spearheaded by AAUP founders Arthur O. Lovejoy and John Dewey. The 1911 BYU controversy, involving some of the same professors, led in part to the University of Utah debacle.Bowen, Craig H. (1995). Academic Freedom and the Utah Controversies of 1911 and 1915. Unpublished Master's thesis, J. Willard Marriott Library Special Collections, University of Utah, Salt Lake City. As a result of these intertwined academic storms, the AAUP published, in December 1915, its inaugural volume of the Bulletin of the American Association of University Professors, including the document now known as the 1915 Declaration of Principles on Academic Freedom and Academic Tenure — the AAUP’s foundational statement on the rights and corresponding obligations of members of the academic profession. Because of the recent controversies between the school and the board, Brimhall was surprised when the school was given $50,000 for BYU high school and $90,000 (initially $25,000) for BYU, although the school still remained in debt. BYU would continue to face financial problems throughout Brimhall's presidency and around 1914 unofficial reports stated that BYU would be closed and moved to Salt Lake City to become part of LDS University. Near the end of Brimhall's time as president, BYU began to emphasize its role as a religious institution, specifically focusing on the importance of testimony and morality. When the United States declared war with Germany in 1917, Brimhall conducted many patriotic assemblies and supported his students who enlisted. In October 1918, under the direction of Brimhall, BYU officially opened an Army Training Corps center. The school continued its growth by building the Mechanic Arts Building, which would be the first step to the construction of separate buildings for each of the colleges within the University. Executive committee Brimhall in 1922 At a BYU board meeting, Brimhall announced that the church had asked him to devote some of his time to the seminary program. In order to keep BYU running without Brimhall's constant supervision, a faculty executive committee would help with important school affairs. This shift in power marked a new era for BYU. With regards to BYU, Brimhall was focused on the liberal arts program and would often travel with other faculty members to promote the program. Although Brimhall was not as interested in hiring professors from eastern universities, he did keep in touch with (Latter-day SaintsLatter-day Saints students who went to graduate schools and their reports helped Brimhall see the value of advanced degrees. Brimhall also received reports from eastern administrators praising the values and intellectual prowess of students who received their undergraduate education from BYU. Post-presidency Suffering from chest and abdominal pain, Brimhall resigned the presidency of BYU in July 1921, although he remained head of the Department of Theology and Religion. Brimhall committed suicide on July 29, 1932, although many newspapers simply reported that he died after a long battle with illness.

The objective was to inhibit the movement of U-boats from bases in Germany to the Atlantic shipping lanes bringing supplies to the British Isles. Rear Admiral Lewis Clinton- Baker, commanding the Royal Navy minelaying force at the time, described the barrage as the \\"biggest mine planting stunt in the world's history;\\"Belknap, Reginald Rowan The Yankee mining squadron; or, Laying the North Sea mining barrage (1920) United States Naval Institute pp.5,15,18-22,27-36,43-47,56,82-83,101&108 but larger fields containing more mines were laid during World War II. Concept The idea of a mine barrage across the North Sea was first proposed in the summer of 1916 by Admiral Reginald Bacon and was agreed at the Allied Naval Conference on 5 September 1917. The Royal Navy—and in particular Admiral Beatty as Commander in Chief of the Grand Fleet—was skeptical about the value of the operation and did not feel it justified the large logistical and manufacturing commitment required. A minefield across the North Sea would require mining water deep while no previous minefield had been established in waters more than deep. A minefield across the North Sea had been estimated to require 400,000 conventional anchored mines. An \\"antenna\\" mine developed in July 1917 was effective at the assumed maximum submarine depth of ; and 100,000 of these new Mk 6 mines would be adequate to form the North Sea mine barrage. The United States was altogether more enthusiastic about the operation, as the loss of trans- Atlantic shipping was a major domestic concern and this plan allowed the United States to play an active part in tackling this, while playing to their industrial strength and with minimal risk of American casualties. Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt appealed directly to President Woodrow Wilson to overcome opposition to the project from Vice Admiral William Sims, who commanded all United States naval forces in Europe.Potter and Nimitz Sea Power (1960) Prentice-Hall p.470 The U.S. Navy tendered an order for the Mk 6 mines in October 1917 with of steel wire rope required to moor the mines to the seabed. Project spending of $40 million was shared among 140 manufacturing contractors and over 400 sub-contractors. All mine components other than wire rope, explosives, and detonating circuitry were manufactured by Detroit automobile firms.Daniels, Josephus The Northern Barrage and other Mining Activities (1920) Government Printing Office p.20,47-58 Eight civilian steamships were converted to minelayers; and another 24 mine carrying freighters, sailing at a rate of two or three per week, were required to transport manufactured mine components to assembly depots in Scotland. Objectives The objective was to prevent U-boats from operating in the North Atlantic and preying on trans-Atlantic shipping. A similar barrage had already been placed across the English Channel, which had resulted in U-boats diverting north around Scotland. The North Sea Mine Barrage was intended to close this alternative route, and it also made it hard for the U-boats to get supplies. Mark 6 Mines A Mk 6 mine atop its anchor. Two horn fuzes are visible, but the antenna fuze cannot be seen in this image. The Mk 6 mine was a diameter steel sphere containing a buoyancy chamber and of TNT.Campbell, John Naval Weapons of World War II (1985) Naval institute Press p.167 Each mine was constructed of two steel hemispheres welded together. A Toxyl bursting charge was cast into the lower hemisphere. Toxyl was a mixture of 60% trinitroxylene (TNX) with 40% TNT used because the United States Army controlled United States TNT production and would not release sufficient quantities for the naval mine barrage. For transport, the mine rested atop a box-shaped steel anchor approximately square. The anchor box had wheels allowing the mine assembly to be moved along a system of rails aboard the minelayer. The mine was connected to its anchor box by a wire rope mooring cable stored on a reel. The depth of the mine below the water surface was controlled by allowing the steel mooring cable to unwind from its reel as the mine was dropped from the minelayer until a sensor suspended beneath the anchor reached the bottom. The sensor locked the cable reel so the falling anchor would pull the buoyant mine below the surface; and the float extended the antenna above the mine. Each mine had two hydrostatic safety features intended to render the mine safe if it detached from its mooring cable and floated to the surface. The first was an open switch in the detonation circuit closed by hydrostatic pressure. The second was a spring pushing the detonator away from the explosive charge into the buoyancy chamber unless compressed by hydrostatic pressure. The mines were intended to be safe at depths less than . Each mine contained a dry cell battery with an electrical detonating circuit which could be initiated by any one of five parallel fuzes. Four of the fuzes were conventional horns in the buoyant upper hemisphere of the mine. Each horn contained a glass ampule of electrolyte which would connect an open circuit if an ampule was broken by bending the soft metal horn. The novel fifth fuze was a copper wire antenna with a float to extend it above the mine. A ship's steel hull touching the copper antenna would form a battery, and seawater acted as an electrolyte completing a circuit with an insulated copper plate on the mine surface to actuate a detonating relay within the mine. The relay armature was initially set to complete the detonating circuit at 25 to 40 millivolts. The Bureau of Ordnance subsequently increased sensitivity to 10 to 25 millivolts, but this was later readjusted on the basis of field experience.Daniels, Jesephus The Northern Barrage and other Mining Activities (1920) Government Printing Office pp.105-120 Each mine had five separate spring-loaded safety switches in the detonating circuit held open by salt pellets which took about 20 minutes to dissolve in sea water after the mine was dropped overboard from the minelayer. Battery life for the detonating circuit was estimated at greater than two years.Daniels, Josephus The Northern Barrage and other Mining Activities (1920) Government Printing Office p.26 Laying the minefield The mine barrage was within a belt long and to wide divided into area B off the east coast of Orkney, area C near the Norwegian coast between Utsira and Bergen, and the longest central area A connecting the two coastal areas between 0° 50′ West and 3° 10′ East. The Royal Navy laid mines in areas B and C while the United States Navy mined area A. The Royal Navy left a channel open for navigation adjacent to Orkney. Because of neutrality regulations no mines were laid within Norwegian territorial waters.Daniels, Josephus The Northern Barrage and other Mining Activities (1920) Government Printing Office pp.38&121 The United States North Sea Mine Force was commanded by Rear Admiral Joseph Strauss aboard the Atlantic Fleet Mine Force flagship USS . Strauss was an ordnance specialist and had been chief of the Bureau of Ordnance from 1913 to 1916. Mine Squadron One, under the command of Captain Reginald R. Belknap, assembled at Inverness, Scotland in June 1918. Over the following five months, these ships planted 56,571 of the 70,177 mines laid to form the North Sea mine barrage. The WWI Mine Memorial on Boston Common (Massachusetts, USA) Only the two smallest of the eight steamships converted to lay the barrage remained in commission for conventional minelaying operations. USS Shawmut, shown laying the North Sea mine barrage, sank 23 years later during the attack on Pearl Harbor after being renamed Oglala. * USS (old protected cruiser converted in 1911 to carry 170 mines) (flagship) * USS (old protected cruiser converted in 1915 carry 180 mines) * USS (former Eastern steamship Bunker Hill carried 320 mines on one deck) * USS Shawmut (former Eastern steamship Massachusetts carried 320 mines on one deck) * USS (former Southern Pacific freighter El Siglo carried 830 mines on 3 decks) * USS (former Southern Pacific freighter El Dia carried 830 mines on 3 decks) * USS (former Southern Pacific freighter El Cid carried 830 mines on 3 decks) * USS (former Southern Pacific freighter El Rio carried 830 mines on 3 decks) * USS (former Old Dominion steamship Hamilton carried 612 mines on 2 decks) * USS (former Old Dominion steamship Jefferson carried 612 mines on 2 decks) The mine barrage consisted of 18 rows of mines laid in an east-west direction. Ten rows of mines were laid at a depth of to be detonated by ships traveling on the surface. Submerged submarines were targeted by four rows of mines at , and another four rows at . Since Utsira is slightly north of Orkney, alignment of minefields within the central area A was skewed east-northeasterly from Orkney. Where possible, longitude was determined from a calibrated taut-wire anchored near a landmark and unreeled from a spool of piano wire aboard one of the cruisers acting as the minelaying formation guide. Latitude was checked from the elevation of the sun when atmospheric conditions permitted. The mine barrage required multiple missions, called \\"excursions\\", laying parallel rows of mines partway across the North Sea between Norway and Orkney. Mine Squadron One made thirteen two- day minelaying excursions laying parallel rows of mines while steaming in columns apart with the last ship in each column dropping mines at intervals. As a minelayer exhausted its supply of mines, another minelayer in that column would drop back to the last position to continue the minelaying sequence. The minelayers were preceded by Royal Navy destroyers sweeping for enemy mines and submarines. A covering force of battleships with Royal Navy cruiser squadrons maneuvered nearby to defend the minelaying formation, but no German surface warships attempted engagement. Buoys were dropped temporarily marking the end point of a mining excursion to avoid leaving an unmined gap when the next excursion started. These buoys were subject to potential movement by storms or enemy action. Three to five percent of the new mines dropped into the North Sea detonated as soon as the salt pellets dissolved; and hydrophones detected premature detonations continuing for a week after minelaying. These premature detonations were initially attributed to activation of the horn fuze detonation circuits by seawater leaking into the mines; and mine spacing was increased from on the first minelaying excursion to on subsequent excursions to minimize leakage caused by detonation of nearby mines. About one percent of the mines deployed during the first excursion broke free of their mooring cables and washed ashore in Norway within a month. Mines used for the last eleven excursions had springs installed at the mine mooring cable attachment points to buffer wave loading during storms. Premature detonations increased to 14 percent for the fourth minelaying excursion; because some mines had been assembled with the more sensitive antenna fuze relay settings made by the Bureau of Ordnance. The fifth minelaying excursion was halted when 19 percent of the mines detonated prematurely. San Francisco identified relay armature sensitivity as a major cause of premature detonations during a comparative field test minelaying excursion on August 12. Subsequent investigations revealed copper sulfate deposits caused by antenna corrosion created a weak battery increasing the probability of relay activation by shock wave accelerations when nearby mines detonated. Premature detonations dropped to four to six percent when sensitivity was adjusted to 30 to 45 millivolts for mines deployed by the last five minelaying excursions. Success of the barrage Supply problems and technical difficulties caused some delays. Planned additional minelaying excursions to complete the barrage were cancelled when the approaching end of hostilities was recognized upon completion of the thirteenth minelaying excursion on 26 October 1918. The design of the minefield meant there was a theoretical 66% chance of a surfaced U-boat triggering a mine and a 33% chance for a submerged U-boat.Daniels, Jesephus The Northern Barrage and other Mining Activities (1920) Government Printing Office p.125 On the basis of the number of effective mines observed while sweeping the barrage, the actual odds were assessed at being closer to 20% for a surfaced U-boat and 10% for a submerged one. As the final mines were laid only a matter of days before the end of World War I, it is impossible to assess the success of the plan. Some contend the minefield was a major cause of the declining morale of the Imperial German Navy through the final months of the war, while others suggest Germany easily swept safe channels through the large, unguarded minefield. The official statistics on lost German submarines compiled on 1 March 1919 credited the North Sea mine barrage with the certain destruction of four U-boats, presumed destruction of two more, and possible destruction of another two. * 19 August 1918 unknown - possibly sunk by the North Sea mine barrageTarrant, V.E.

Cleanup United States participation in the minesweeping effort was overseen by Rear Admiral Strauss aboard the repair ship Blackhawk from which he had commanded the minelaying operation. Tugs and towed Admiralty wooden sailing smacks Red Rose and Red Fern out to conduct the first trial sweep in December. Sweeping was accomplished by suspending a serrated wire between two ships on a parallel course. While held underwater by planing devices called \\"kites\\", the wire would foul the cables suspending the buoyant mines above their anchors. If the serrated wire parted the mine mooring cable, the mine would bob to the surface to be destroyed by gunfire. The smacks swept and destroyed six mines before winter weather halted further work at sea. The winter was spent testing an electrical protective device to reduce the risk of sweeping the antenna mines with steel-hulled ships. Patapsco and Patuxent tested the protective device by sweeping 39 mines in March.Davis, Noel, LT, USN Sweeping the North Sea Mine Barrage (1919) pp.15-18 Royal Navy minesweeping efforts involved 421 vessels manned by 600 officers and 15,000 men from 1 April to 30 November 1919. Twelve Lapwing class minesweepers and 18 submarine chasers were available for the first routine sweep of the United States minesweepers on 29 April 1919. After the first sweep took two days to clear 221 mines, Strauss requested more ships in the hope of clearing the mine barrage that summer. Twenty Admiralty trawlers with American crews, 16 more Lapwing class minesweepers, and another repair ship were assigned to his command. Panther was given responsibility for tending trawlers William Ashton, Thomas Blackhorne, Thomas Buckley, Richard Bulkeley, George Burton, Pat Caharty, William Caldwell, George Clarke, John Clay, George Cochrane, John Collins, William Darnold, Sam Duffy, John Dunkin, John Fitzgerald, John Graham, Thomas Graham, Thomas Henrix, William Johnson, Thomas Laundry, and submarine chasers SC-37, 38, 40, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 95, 110, 164, 178, 181, 182, 206, 207, 208, 254, 256, 259, 272, 329, 354 and 356. Blackhawk provided tender services for the larger ships operating as six divisions.Davis, Noel, LT, USN Sweeping the North Sea Mine Barrage (1919) pp.19,27&94-95 USS Eider (Minesweeper No. 17) (left) in port with submarine chasers alongside during the clearance of the North Sea Mine Barrage in 1919.

Sweeping gear was often lost if the mine detonated and cut the sweeping cables. Approximately one third of the ships were damaged by exploding mines. Two men were killed in separate incidents while attempting to haul mines aboard to clear fouled sweeping kites. It had been assumed the Mk 6 mine hydrostatic safety devices would minimize the risks of this procedure, but sweeping gear losses increased after unreliability of these safety devices was recognized. Countermining sequences initiated by destruction of a swept mine causing detonation of an undetected mine closer to one of the minesweepers were another source of damage. Some of this countermining was attributed to acceleration of the antenna fuze relay armature or seawater leaking into damaged mines rather than sympathetic detonation of explosives. The minesweepers were sometimes able to continue sweeping, but the trawlers were less durable. Seven men drowned when the Richard Bulkeley was sunk by a mine detonation on 12 July. Strauss discontinued use of the trawlers for minesweeping, but retained six for transporting replacement sweeping gear to minesweepers when wires were destroyed by exploding mines. The remaining 13 trawlers were returned to the Admiralty. Most damaged ships were repaired, but SC-38 was declared a total loss. Three more men of the minesweeping force were killed in individual accidents involving sweeping gear before Strauss declared the barrage cleared on 30 September 1919.Davis, Noel, LT, USN Sweeping the North Sea Mine Barrage (1919) pp.5,50-51&76-77 The minesweepers found only about 25 to 30 percent of the mines laid a year earlier;Bernaerts, Arnd Climate Change and Naval War (2006) Trafford Publishing pp.285-290 but it was assumed the others had either broken free, sunk to the bottom, or been destroyed by premature explosions. Strauss was recognized as a Knight Commander of St Michael and St George for his efforts; but doubts about effectiveness of the minesweeping effort persisted into the 21st century. Postwar consequences As 1919 drew to a close, the onset of winter forced the suspension of sweeping for moored buoyant mines, but the Royal Navy resumed minesweeping operations the following spring, continuing to clear sunken mines from fishing grounds, and maintaining a destroyer patrol to track down mines that had broken free of their moorings and gone adrift. Losses of civilian ships to North Sea mines continued; the origin of the mine in these cases was often difficult to determine. In 1919, twenty crewmen drowned when the Swedish steamship Hollander sank, minutes after striking a mine in October;Launceton, Australia Examiner 28 October 1919 p.5 and the steamer Kerwood struck a mine and sank on 1 December.United Nations REPORTS OF INTERNATIONAL ARBITRAL AWARDS Vol VII pp.199-203 See also * Otranto Barrage  Notes  Bibliography * Conflicts in 1918 North Sea operations of World War I Naval mines ","title":"North Sea Mine Barrage"},{"id":"4300411","text":"Benjamin Cluff Jr. (February 7, 1858 – June 14, 1948) was the first President of Brigham Young University, and the school's third principal. Under his administration, the student body and faculty more than doubled in size, and the school went from an academy to a university, and was officially incorporated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Cluff changed class periods from half an hour to a full hour, adopted the official colors of the university, started summer school and the Alumni Association, encouraged the university's first student newspaper (White and Blue), provided the first student loans, and developed an intercollegiate sports system. Early life Benjamin Cluff was a native of Provo and was born to Benjamin Sr. and Mary Ellen Foster Cluff in 1858. When he was 4 years old, his family moved to Logan, Utah. They then moved to Hawaii when Cluff was 7 years old because his father was serving a mission there. The family worked at a church owned plantation for cotton and sugar cane. They returned to Utah in 1870. Cluff later lived in Coalville, Utah with his uncle where he became the city librarian at age 17 because of his love of reading. In 1877, he walked 67 miles from Coalsville to Provo in order to start his studies at Brigham Young Academy, where he studied in the Normal Department. When he first started school he worked as a janitor, but after one year he became an instructor in the Primary Department at Brigham Young Academy. He then went on a 3-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to the Hawaiian Islands in 1879. In 1882 he returned to teach at the Academy, teaching everything from language to bookkeeping. He also helped the fire brigade in Provo when the Lewis Building, which was the original location of Brigham Young Academy, caught on fire. In 1886, he received approval for a leave of absence to go to the University of Michigan and was set apart to study there by John W. Taylor. While studying in Michigan, Cluff joined a prestigious student organization called the Adelphi Society. He worked closely with professors in the fields of astronomy and engineering, and became good friends with James Burrill Angell, president of the university. Cluff received his bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan in 1890. He also served as president of the Ann Arbor Branch of the LDS church while there. At the time he left for the University of Michigan, Cluff had two wives, Mary the daughter of David John and Harriet \\"Hattie\\" Cullimore. Principal of Brigham Young Academy After receiving his degree, Cluff returned to Brigham Young Academy and became the assistant principal. Although the Board voted unanimously to make Cluff assistant principal, much of the faculty at the Academy were apprehensive because of Cluff's ties to education in the East and their distrust in eastern influences at the Academy. When Karl G. Maeser, the acting principal of the Academy, returned from an extended trip, he found that many of the affairs of the Academy, especially financial affairs, were in disarray and because of Maeser's reaction, Cluff resigned as assistant principal. A few months later the board rejected Cluff's resignation. By late 1891, Karl G. Maeser had to be replaced as principal of Brigham Young Academy because he had been called to oversee the entire LDS education program as Superintendent of Church Schools, and was unable to do both jobs. =Church University= On January 4, 1892, the principalship of Brigham Young Academy was passed from Maeser to Cluff. This occurred on the same day that approximately one thousand people were gathered for the dedication of the new Academy Building. After becoming principal, there were many pressing matters that Cluff had to address. One of those matters was the proposed formation of an LDS university in Salt Lake City. Many worried that this would affect the Academy by taking away some of its most prestigious teachers, including Cluff who had been offered a position there. Fortunately for the Academy, Cluff did not go to the LDS College. When the Circular Number Eight, a document that restricted the right of existing LDS schools in order to centralize the new Church University, was created by the General Board of Education, Cluff and other leaders of major church schools tried to fight back against certain provisions of the document. One provision that Cluff feared was the restriction of church schools other than the new Church University to give degrees to their students. Although the leaders of the major LDS schools were apprehensive about the idea of creating a Church University, many of the most prestigious of these educators were called to be members of the committee charged with the responsibility to organize the new Church University. Along with Cluff, the committee consisted of Karl G. Maeser, and James E. Talmage from the Academy, plus James Sharp, and Willard Young. The next day, the committee proposed that the new university be called \\"The University of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\\" or the \\"Church University\\". After nationwide financial issues, church leadership decided to suspend any further efforts to create the Church University and proceeded to give their support to the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. After continuous financial struggles, the Academy was able to stay open, but because of the death of Abraham O. Smoot who was a generous benefactor of the Academy, the financial struggles lasted longer than other periods of financial challenges. In 1893, Cluff went back to the University of Michigan to work on a master's degree and left George H. Brimhall as acting president. =Changes under Cluff= Cluff's methods as principal have been described as nearly opposite those of Maeser. Maeser was insular and conservative in his teaching methods. He kept his teachings well within the LDS world, and adhered to classical education standards. Cluff was more open to new ideas and methods. He also believed that the world outside Mormonism had a lot to offer the school. Cluff often referred to his time as administrator of the Academy as the \\"New Epoch\\" because of his commitment to academic excellence and his motto, \\"learn to do by doing\\". At the beginning of Cluff's principalship, the administration continued to strictly enforce the rules of the Academy as the Maeser administration had done, but over time Cluff helped the Academy transfer that power to the students themselves. This helped to establish an atmosphere of discipline and responsibility maintained by the students through self-governance. Before Cluff's principalship, Brigham Young Academy was still more like a present-day high school than a university. Cluff, however began implementing several changes to the school according to his experiences at Michigan. He began separation of the college from the high school, giving older students access to higher level materials. The Collegiate Department of Brigham Young Academy was officially established in 1896 and was an extension of the college-level courses that Cluff had been teaching since becoming principal. He also introduced an athletics program, which included baseball, football, and track and field. The football program was quickly closed by the Board of Trustees because many colleges at this time frowned on athletics programs and because the sport was an \\"abomination to the spirit.\\" Cluff also helped implement many programs that were ahead of their time such as adding a military department, a summer school, a school song, and psychology classes. He also extended the length of class from thirty minutes to one hour blocks. The school was privately supported by members of the community, and was not absorbed and sponsored officially by the LDS Church until July 18, 1896. Around 1894, Cluff was finding it increasingly difficult to find qualified teachers who were willing to take the salary that the Academy was able to offer them. Another recurring problem was the Academy's teacher retention because of mission assignments from the church that required the instructors to leave their teaching jobs and dedicate all of their energies to their missionary efforts. That same year, Cluff was able to hire a handful of non-Mormon teachers after much resistance from Maeser and Brigham Young Jr. Although hiring teachers outside of the Mormon community was Cluff's doing, he also saw the importance of training high quality teachers within the Mormon community. In order to accomplish this goal, Cluff started a \\"Normal Training School\\" which gave free lessons to students who were interested in teaching. This approach proved to be successful, and the normal school supplied experienced and qualified teachers to the schools in the region. In May 1898, College Hall was built in order to provide more space for the upper division students of the Academy's Collegiate Department. Even with the added space, many students at the Academy were cramped because of the continuous increase in enrollment. The school continued to have success with the dedication and opening of the annual Brigham Young Academy Summer School. Another successful initiative that Cluff suggested was the implementation of a Missionary Training Program in 1899 for prospective missionaries of the LDS church. =Expedition to Central and South America= In 1899, Cluff outlined his proposal to take Academy students on an expedition to ancient Book of Mormon ruins and complete other related historical studies in Central and South America. Church leadership approved Cluff's plans, and he began preparing for the trip. He had to select the men who would accompany him, getting needed funding, and better organize the studies that would take place during the expedition. The men who were part of the expedition were set apart on 7 April 1900 and 10 days later they embarked on their expedition, leaving George Brimhall as acting principal of the Academy. As they journeyed through Southern Utah, for the first 16 days of the journey they were met by feasts and celebrations in many of the cities that they entered. After leaving predominately Mormon areas, members of the expedition began to go off in pairs to act as missionaries in the cities that they passed through. The expedition stopped in Thatcher Arizona for a month while Cluff went to visit Florence Reynolds, who was a teacher at the Juarez Academy in the Mormon Colonies in Mexico and would become Cluff's second wife. The young men in the company were getting restless because of the significant delay in their journey, and after their month-long wait, they continued towards the Mexican border and began to familiarize themselves with Mexican culture. Heber J. Grant went and visited the expedition camp which had stopped in Nogales, on the border of Mexico. Once he returned to Utah to report his findings, the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles decided that because the members of the expedition were not well experienced travelers and were not proving to be completely compliant with the rules that they were taught at the Academy, a letter was sent to Joseph F. Smith. He met with Cluff and expressed the concern of church leadership and recommended the termination of the trip. Even as he was told to cease the venture, Cluff ignored this counsel and proceeded with the journey. Although Cluff decided to continue, some members of his expedition party decided to return to Provo, leaving only 9 members of the expedition party, including Cluff. They passed through many Mormon settlements in Mexico and had many hardships including starvation, illness, and fatigue. After nearly two years of travel, the expedition ran out of supplies, had problems with securing safe passage through Colombia, and was forced to turn back. Cluff finally returned to his position in 1904, but was accused of various improprieties, including sexual immorality by his assistant Walter Wolfe. Cluff was forced to resign. The charges of immorality stemmed from a post-Manifesto marriage between Cluff and twenty-five-year-old Florence Mary Reynolds conducted in Mexico. Cluff had obtained permission for the marriage from Joseph F. Smith. =Founding of Brigham Young University= In Cluff's last official act, he proposed to the Board that the Academy be named \\"Brigham Young University\\". At first there was a large amount of opposition to this. Many members of the Board thought that the school wasn't large enough to be a University. However, the decision ultimately passed. One opponent to the decision, Anthon H. Lund, later said, \\"I hope their head will grow big enough for their hat.\\" Today, the Cluff Building on BYU's Provo campus is named for him.  Later life  After resigning in 1903, Cluff moved to Mexico to establish a rubber plantation and once again had trouble in Mexico. At one point he was held by bandits for 2 weeks and during his absence his family was robbed. He worked with mahogany and shipped some lumber to California which caused him to decide to move his family to California where he opened a grocery store and gas station. He died on June 14, 1948 at the age of 90. Family Life Cluff was husband to three wives and fathered 25 children. References Notes * External links *Benjamin Cluff Jr.'s diary from at L.

The Modern are a British electropop band. They are currently signed to Ninth Wave Records in the United States and EQ Music in Asia. The band consists of vocalist Emma Cooke, with Nathan Cooper and Chi Tudor-Hart on vocals and synthesizers. The band changed their name from Dirty Blonde to The Modern in 2003, and then on to Matinee Club in September 2006, before reverting to The Modern in November 2008. History The band first began to form in 2001. Fronted by Nathan Cooper and Chi Tudor-Hart, the group were then known as Dirty Blonde. In 2003, vocalist Emma Cooke joined the band, and they changed their name to The Modern. Following Cooke's induction to the group, guitarist Telee and drummer Rees also joined. Rees then left the band to tour with Dirty Vegas, and was replaced by Bob Malkowski shortly afterwards. It was not long after this that Telee left to concentrate on his own band. The Modern line up was completed, and the group started to write and perform together. They obtained got a recording contract in 2005, when they were signed to Mercury Records. The band recorded several songs with record producer Stephen Hague, with a view towards preparing for their debut album, which was tentatively going to be called 'Life In The Modern World'. The first of these songs was released as a single. \\"Jane Falls Down\\" received little airplay on commercial radio stations. but entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 4. The group followed this with their second single, \\"Industry\\" on 6 March 2006. The song airplay on the music video channels, but due to sales irregularities, the single was disqualified from the UK Singles Chart. The band conducted UK wide tours supporting these singles. They also played the 2005 Reading and Leeds Festivals and the October 2005 Whitby Gothic Weekend, as well as the 2006 Elektrofest. In July, 2006, they performed at Pride Rally's 'Prides Against Prejudice' in Trafalgar Square. In September 2006, it was announced on the group's forum that they had parted company with Mercury Records, and that Malkowski and Robert James had left the band. The trio continued as Matinee Club. They signed to a new independent record label, Planet Clique and, in March 2007, the song \\"Discotheque Francais\\" was issued through the record label's website. Months later the band had changed record labels once again, this time moving onto Universal Music under Europa Recordings, although this was short-lived as Europa Recordings was closed down. In October the group transferred back to Planet Clique for the digital release of \\"Discotheque Francais\\". The debut album, Modern Industry, was made available to download in December. It included a cover version of David Bowie's \\"Modern Love\\". In January 2008, the group released The Modern LP through Ninth Wave Records, albeit only in the US. It differed from the later UK release. Matinee Club recorded a video for the American global warming awareness show, Earth Hour. In November 2008, the group reformed as The Modern, and the drummer Rees returned to the band. Signing another record deal that covered most of Asia, the band released a double album, under the same title as their US LP, in July 2009.

Before becoming principal of Brigham Young Academy, Dusenberry was the founder of three other schools in Provo, Utah. Dusenberry was only a temporary principal and was succeeded by Karl G. Maeser. He also served as County Judge of Utah County and mayor of Provo. Early years and family Dusenberry was born in White Haven, Pennsylvania. In 1840 he moved with his parents to Pike County, Illinois, which was located near Mormon headquarters. In 1846, shortly after the move his mother joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, but his father did not. Due to this, when the majority of the Latter Day Saints moved to Utah the Dusenberry family remained in Illinois. In 1860, the Dusenberry family began the trek west and stopped in Provo, Utah Territory to visit their mother's brother Howard Coray. After their visit to Provo, the Dusenberry family continued on to Los Angeles, California where they lived for six months before moving to northern California near Sacramento. In California Warren Dusenberry studied at Vacaville College, which was a Methodist high school. In 1862 Dusenberry moved with his mother, brother Wilson, and two sisters to Provo, leaving his father and one brother behind in California. First Ward School After settling in Provo, Dusenberry began teaching at a Mormon school called the \\"First Ward School\\" in the basement of the tabernacle. Seeing that the school needed materials, he went to Salt Lake City and spent $50 out of his own pocket in order to buy materials for the \\"First Ward School\\". Because the school was growing rapidly it caused the church leaders, who were also the school administrators, to move the school into a large house with two stories. This pattern of relocating to more spacious venues continued with multiple other building because of Dusenberry's popularity as a school teacher. At one point he was teaching 62 students on his own. Later many accounts of his struggle to maintain order in the classroom came to light. Even with said difficulties in the classroom and the financial difficulties surrounding the school, Dusenberry often commented on how much he enjoyed teaching. . The school grew in popularity and numbers and eventually Warren decided to \\"establish a school of his own.\\" Dusenberry School In 1863, Warren Dusenberry opened the Dusenberry School, also called Provo High School, which was actually a \\"graded\\" elementary school. He rented \\"cluff hall\\" on 2nd north and 2nd east, which had enough room for the expected enrollment and for theatrical activities and other features that fit Dusenberry's teaching style. The school was furnished with desks that Dusenberry made by hand and had 83 students when its doors first opened. Because Warren and Wilson Dusenberry were the only administrators at the school while it was being established, they took care of all responsibilities including teaching and cleaning. Warren took over the teaching of the more advanced classes while Wilson taught the novice students. They promoted extracurricular activities including participating in after school debates, playing ball, acting, and learning to play instruments (Dusenberry taught the accordion). The Dusenberry brothers were forced to live at the school because of their obligation to this new investment, initially sleeping on the hardwood floor In the spring of 1864, the Dusenberry School was more popular than ever. With a capacity of 103 students, some of the 120 students who enrolled for that semester had to be turned away. The Dusenberry brothers were into dramatic acting and helped acting become a popular activity among young people in Provo. Many say that the Dusenberry brothers helped the people of Provo realize Brigham Young's vision of education and culture in the Mormon community. In the spring of 1865 schools in the Provo area were still struggling financially, including the Dusenberry School. As the president of the county board of education, Dusenberry attempted to improve the quality of teachers and materials in the classroom, but because of limited funds, his efforts were in vain. Because tuition was often paid in commodities or services rendered, the Dusenberrys struggled to pay rent for their school building, especially after the price nearly tripled. In order to bring in extra money, Dusenberry farmed during the summers, served on a grand jury, and took part in other civic happenings. In 1867, the Dusenberry brothers opened a general store, helped in the Provo Post Office, and took over the Provo telegraph agency. Dusenberry also took on the role county tax assessor, county school examiner, and the county road district road district. After taking up other interests and becoming discouraged by so many financial setbacks, the Dusenberry School closed after the spring of 1865 and would not reopen for another 4 years. Second Dusenberry School In 1869, the Dusenberry brothers along with their new colleague James E. Daniels, organized the Second Dusenberry School in the Kinsey Building on Center Street in Provo. Once the school opened they faced many of the same problems that they had encountered with the first Dusenberry School. They did not have enough room for all of the students who enrolled, but this time they were able to expand to some vacant rooms in the Lewis hall next door. The Dusenberry school helped form a solid educational system in Provo, and helped Provo become an important educational center in Utah. Timpanogos Branch of the University of Deseret The University of Deseret was established in 1850, and although it was located in the Salt Lake Valley, just like the schools in Provo, the university struggled with financial problems and was closed from 1853-1868. When the university was reestablished in Mar. 1869, the popularity and quality of the second Dusenberry School made it a prime candidate to be the first branch of the university, and it was converted into the Timpanogos Branch. From 1870 to 1875, Dusenberry was the principal the University of Deseret's Timpanogos Branch (also called Timpanogos University), but for much of his time in that position he was not able to be a full-time administrator. In 1871, Dusenberry was sent to New York to help with the emigration office. When he returned home he focused more on civil duties and the practice of law than being in the classroom. After more financial struggles, the Timpanogos Branch was closed in April 1875. Brigham Young Academy In April 1875, Brigham Young, George Q. Cannon, and Dusenberry began to make plans for the opening of a new school that would be called Brigham Young Academy. The land that had once belonged to the Timpanogos Branch would now be used for the new academy. In November of that same year a Board of Trustees was formed and Dusenberry was elected as the first principal of Brigham Young Academy. Dusenberry would only act as principal of the academy for a few months before resigning and to go to law school. In 1892 Dusenberry was elected mayor of Provo, defeating Reed Smoot. Religious affiliations Eventually, both of the Dusenberry brothers decided to be baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, despite counsel from their father to keep \\"free from the curse of Mormonism\\"Brigham Young University the first 100 years, vol. 1 pg. 33 https://archive.org/details/brighamyounguniv01wilk. They were baptized on July 25, 1864 and were confirmed the next day. By 1867, both Warren and Wilson were ordained as members of the Quorum of the Seventy. On April 7, 1867, Dusenberry went on a mission to the Southern States. He served for one year as a proselyting missionary and then was reassigned to help in the immigration office in Boston where he helped LDS church members prepare to move west.

Two subspecies are recognised. Heard much more often than seen, it is a dark olive-green and black in colour with a distinctive white cheek patch and crest. The male and female are similar in plumage. Taxonomy The eastern whipbird was mistakenly described by John Latham as two separate species in 1801 from early colonial illustrations, first as the white-cheeked crow (Corvus olivaceus) and as the coachwhip flycatcher (Muscicapa crepitans). The bird became commonly known as coachwhip bird or stockwhip bird. John Gould recorded the aboriginal term Djou from the Hunter Region of New South Wales. Its specific name is derived from its olive colouration, though was soon placed in the new genus Psophodes by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield, derived from the Greek psophōdes/ψοφωδης meaning 'noisy'. The family placement has changed, some now placing it in a large broadly defined inclusive Corvidae, while others split it and several other genera into the quail-thrush family Cinclosomatidae. Other research proposes that the quail-thrushes are themselves distinctive, leaving the whipbirds and wedgebills in a family with the proposed name Psophodidae. The name \\"Eupetidae\\" had been used for this grouping; however, because of the distant relationship of the rail-babbler to the other members of this group uncovered in research by Jønsson et al. (2007) that name is more appropriately used for the monotypic family which contains this species. =Subspecies= Two subspecies are recognized: *P. o. olivaceus, the nominate subspecies, is found from eastern Victoria to southeastern Queensland. *P. o. lateralis is found on the Atherton Tableland and is smaller and browner.Boles, (The Robins and Flycatchers of Australia), p. 410 Description A slim bird some in length and in weight, it is olive green with a black head and breast. It has a small black crest with a white cheek-patch on its face. It has a paler abdomen with a long dark olive-green tail tipped with white. The iris is brown and bill is black with blackish feet. The male is slightly larger than the female. Juveniles are a duller olive-brown and lack the white cheek stripes and dark throat. The eastern whipbird is generally shy, and is heard much more often than seen. Its long drawn out call - a long note, followed by a \\"whip crack\\" (which is the source of the common name) and some follow on notes - is one of the most distinctive sounds of the eastern Australian bush. The call is usually a duet between the male and female, the male producing the long note and whip crack and female the following notes. Calls are most frequent in the early morning, though do occur through the day with small peaks at noon and sunset. Though male calls are consistent across the species range, a high degree of variation in female calls has been reported. The call samples have been used in many films such as: Bush Christmas 1983 and The Dark Crystal 1982 Distribution and habitat The eastern whipbird is found in wet temperate forests including both rainforests and wet sclerophyll forests, generally near water. It occurs from eastern Victoria north through to central Queensland. A northern race, sometimes known as the northern whipbird (Psophodes olivaceus lateralis) is found in the wet tropics of North Queensland from Cooktown to Townsville. At least one study has found it to be a specialist species in terms of habitat and threatened by urbanisation. Behaviour The eastern whipbird is insectivorous, recovering insects from leaf litter on the forest floor. =Breeding= Whipbirds are monogamous. Breeding occurs from late winter through spring; a loosely built bowl of twigs and sticks lined with softer material such as grasses, located in shrubs or trees less than above the ground. Several broods may be laid in an extended breeding season. A clutch of two eggs, pale blue with blackish splotches and spots, measuring 28 x 20 mm. Female incubate and brood the eggs and nestlings, though males help feed and take a more active role in looking after fledglings for 6 weeks after leaving the nest.

In 1959 his family moved to Ballybrack, Dublin, Ireland and Bathurst attended school in Killiney and later was enrolled at Headfort, an Irish boarding school. In 1966, the family moved to England and Bathurst transferred to Worth School in Sussex, where he took up amateur dramatics. At the age of 18, he read law at Pembroke College, Cambridge and joined the Cambridge Footlights group. After graduating, he took up acting full-time. He made his professional stage debut in 1983, playing Tim Allgood in Michael Frayn's Noises Off, which ran for a year at the Savoy Theatre. To broaden his knowledge of working on stage, he joined the National Theatre. He supplemented his stage roles in the 1980s with television roles, appearing in comedies such as the aborted pilot episode of Blackadder, Chelmsford 123, The Lenny Henry Show and the first episode of Red Dwarf. In 1991, he won his first major television role playing Mark Taylor in the semi-autobiographical BBC sitcom Joking Apart, written by Steven Moffat. Although only thirteen episodes were made (between 1991 and 1995), the role remains Bathurst's favourite of his whole career. After Joking Apart concluded, he was cast as pompous management consultant David Marsden in the ITV comedy drama Cold Feet, which ran for five series from 1998 to 2003 and again for four further series from 2016 to 2020.

A casting director for the James Bond film The Living Daylights persuaded Bathurst to audition for Bond.

In 1990, he performed on Up Yer News, a live topical programme broadcast on BSB. =Joking Apart= While working on Up Yer News, Bathurst auditioned for a one-off television comedy called Joking Apart. Earlier in the day, he noticed a fellow Up Yer News performer reading the script to prepare for his own audition. As Bathurst went into the audition room, his colleague was leaving and told Bathurst he would \\"break his legs\\" if he got the part, a threat that seemed not to be \\"entirely jocular\\". Bathurst got the part and the pilot of Joking Apart was broadcast as an installment of the BBC 2 Comic Asides strand. It returned for two series in 1993 and 1995. Bathurst appeared as sitcom writer Mark Taylor in the series. After the first series was broadcast, a critic called Bathurst the \\"Best Comedy Newcomer of 1993\\". The show was punctuated by fantasy sequences in which his character performed his thoughts as a stand-up routine in a small club. In the commentary and the interview on the DVD, Bathurst says that he was told that they would be re-shot after filming everything else, an idea abandoned because of the expense. He has an idea of re-filming the sequences 'now', as his older self, to give them a more retrospective feeling.Bathurst, Robert; Steven Moffat. (2008). Joking Apart DVD commentary for Series 2, Episode 4. [DVD]. Replay DVD. He has also said that he believes Mark was too \\"designery\\" and wishes that he had \\"roughened him up a bit\\".Rai, Bindu (4 October 2008). \\"Bathurst toons in to finance \\". Emirates Business 24/7 (Arab Media Group). Retrieved 4 October 2008. The role is his favourite of his whole career; he has described it as \\"the most enjoyable job I will ever do\\" and considers several episodes of the series to be \\"timeless, beautifully constructed farces which will endure\\". Bathurst is often recognised for his appearance in this series, mentioning that \\"Drunks stop me on public transport and tell me details of the plot of their favourite episode\\".Keal, Graham (30 January 2005). \\"New role suits Cold Feet star \\". The Sunday Sun (ncjMedia). As punishment for arriving late for the series one press launch at the Café Royal in Regent Street, London, writer Steven Moffat pledged to write an episode in which Mark is naked throughout. To a large extent, this vow is realised in the second series. Between 1991 and 1995, Bathurst also appeared on television in No Job for a Lady, The House of Eliott and The Detectives and on stage in The Choice, George Bernard Shaw's Getting Married at Chichester with Dorothy Tutin and Gogol's The Nose adapted by Alastair Beaton, which played in Nottingham and Bucharest. He also filmed a role in The Wind in the Willows (Terry Jones, 1996) as St John Weasel. =Wider recognition= In 1996, while appearing in The Rover at the Salisbury Playhouse, Bathurst got an audition for the Granada Television comedy pilot Cold Feet. He arrived for the audition \\"bearded and shaggy\\", on account of his role in the play and did not expect to win the role of upper-middle class management consultant David Marsden.Smith, Rupert (2003). Cold Feet: The Complete Companion. London: Granada Media. pp. 115–116. . The role in the pilot was only minor and created at the last minute to support characters played by James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale; the only character note in the script about David related to his high salary. Bathurst identified the character as merely a \\"post-Thatcherite whipping boy\\". Bathurst reprised the role in the Cold Feet series, which ran for five years from 1998 to 2003. He described the character of David as an \\"emotional cripple\\", originally with little depth.McCaffrey, Julie (22 February 2003). \\"Bathurst's cure for cold feet\\". Edinburgh Evening News (The Scotsman Publications): p. 18. The third series features an affair between David and a political activist played by Yasmin Bannerman. Bathurst appreciated the opportunity to bring some depth to a previously one-dimensional character, but was more impressed with the storylines that came out of the affair, rather than the affair itself: \\"It was the deception, the guilt and the recrimination rather than the actual affair, which was neither interesting nor remarkable\\". Like other cast members, Bathurst was able to suggest storylines as the series went on; one episode features David celebrating his fortieth birthday and Bathurst suggested the character could get a Harley-Davidson motorbike. Granada paid for him to take motorcycle lessons and a test. On the day before taking his test, the filming of a scene where David takes off on his new bike was scheduled. Bathurst \\"wobbled, missed the camera and crashed into the pavement\\", leading director Simon Delaney to exclaim it was the funniest thing he had ever seen. In another episode, David buys a racehorse – ostensibly as a birthday present for his wife – in a plot born out of Bathurst's own love of horseracing. The role made him more widely recognisable and he often received prospective scripts that were \\"obvious rewrites of the character\\". He turned them down, preferring to play a \\"good person\\", which would be more interesting from a dramatic point of view. Between 1998 and 2003, he made television appearances in Goodbye, Mr Steadman (2001), starring opposite Caroline Quentin as a shy and unassuming teacher who has been declared dead after one of his pupils erases all computer records relating to him and in the adaptation of White Teeth (2002). On stage, in 1998 he appeared in Michael Frayn's Alarms and Excursions and in 1999 in Hedda Gabler, which was his last theatre role for several years. In the Daily Telegraph, Charles Spencer described his role as Tesman as a \\"weird casting choice\\" but called his acting \\"a brave stab\\".Spencer, Charles (2 December 1999). \\"Ibsen in a sauna\\". The Daily Telegraph (Telegraph Media Group): p. 30. In 2001, Bathurst appeared in the music video for Westlife's Comic Relief single \\"Uptown Girl\\". In 2002, straight after finishing Cold Feet, Bathurst went straight into filming My Dad's the Prime Minister, a series in which he portrays fictional British prime minister Michael Philips. The first series was broadcast in a Sunday afternoon CBBC slot in 2003. He watched debates in the House of Commons to prepare for the role but did not base his portrayal on Tony Blair.Bathurst, Robert (10 May 2007). \\"A figure of ridicule: Oh, how we will miss him\\". The Independent (Independent News & Media): p. 1 (features section). In 2003, he returned to theatre for the first time in four years to play Vershinin in The Three Sisters, opposite Kristin Scott Thomas and Eric Sykes. He had not seen The Three Sisters before starring in it. Director Michael Blakemore advised him to turn this to his advantage, as he would not feel he had to live up to previous portrayals.\\"The Big Interview: Robert Bathurst\\".

The same year, he starred in the ITV thriller The Stepfather playing Christopher Veazey, a man whose daughter goes missing. Bathurst was pleased that this white-collar worker had an emotional side, in comparison to David Marsden, whom he used as a yardstick when accepting those sorts of roles. Also in 2005, he played Mr Sesseman in an adaptation of Heidi and Dottore Massimo in The Thief Lord. =2006–present= In 2006, he played Mark Thatcher in Coup!, a dramatisation of the attempted coup in Equatorial Guinea. He also starred as Adrien opposite Nicholas Tennant in the UK premiére of Members Only at the Trafalgar Studios. He accepted the part because it was \\"funny, plausible, plausibly absurd and cruel\\" and he liked that it was a translation from an original French play. He enjoyed working on it, telling What's on Stage: \\"Nick is a really good actor and really good to work with in that you can have completely frank discussions about tiny issues and it's totally ego- free. We're all just discussing the point and not playing games with each other. It does make the working practice easier.

It is traversed by New York State Route 214, although in the past the Ulster and Delaware Railroad went through it as well. The notch divides Hunter and Plateau mountains. There is just enough room for the road, and the steep, soaring slopes of both mountains are some of the Catskills' most striking scenery, with landslides and rocky cliffs visible. It sits at one end of the range of mountains known as the Devil's Path, and early visitors found it a terrifying place to visit. Today it is a popular destination not only for tourists in the region but for outdoor recreationists as well. One of the Catskills' major hiking trails crosses the road near the notch, and ice climbers and snowboarders have lately been attracted to the cliffs and slopes in winter. History =Natural origins= Stony Clove Notch was created during the end of the last Ice Age, when meltwater that had accumulated in what is now the Schoharie headlands to the north of the notch gradually began eroding its way through the gap between the mountains, eventually becoming the Stony Clove Creek. =Human use= When the first Europeans were taken through the notch, it was narrow enough that not only was travel through it possible only on foot, those travelers had to go through in single file. As painter and writer Charles Lanman said in the 1840s: Catskill historian Alf Evers suggests that those interested in getting an idea of what Stony Clove Notch was like before the construction of the roads visit nearby Diamond Notch, where it is still possible to put one foot on Southwest Hunter Mountain and another on West Kill Mountain. A few years later, at great expense, the route through the notch was widened to allow enough room for a single wagon by Charles Edwards, a local tanner. Later excavations allowed the Stony Clove and Catskill Mountain Railroad to build a narrow gauge rail line through the gap. It was later upgraded to standard gauge and used until 1940,Kudish, Michael, The Catskill Forest: A History, Purple Mountain Press, Fleischmanns, NY, 2000, , 122 with a flagstop Stony Clove Notch Railroad Station located nearby. The railbed remains visible in the woods to the east almost all the way to the height of land. The Stoney Clove Turnpike was a private company that incorporated in 1873 to upgrade and improve the existing wagon road. It eventually became today's Route 214.Kudish, 117 Geography The notch divides the Schoharie and Esopus subwatersheds of the Hudson River basin. Northern approach to notch in gloomy weather The approach from the Schoharie to the north, where the two mountains can be seen from 214's junction with Route 23A, is characterized by a steady upward climb after the creek has been crossed, the two mountains seeming more and more immense until they just about swallow the road. Evers recommends coming this way when thunderstorms are brewing to the south if one wishes to understand attitudes such as Lanman's. \\"Lightning and thunder will be tossed back and forth from one mountain to the other,\\" he writes. \\"And it will not be hard for a man with a normal amount of imagination to put himself in the place of his ancestors and see the Stony Clove transformed into the very gates of Hell.\\" From the south, via Phoenicia, the approach up Stony Clove has less drama, since Hunter and Plateau are not visible until the notch is considerably closer. However, it offers much sylvan scenery, winding along Stony Clove Creek as it gradually gets higher and higher. Finally, at the Devil's Tombstone public campground it straightens out and the notch becomes apparent as it sweeps by Notch Pond and up to the height of land. Environment The notch is noteworthy as one of the few locations in the Catskills where boreal forest occurs below 3,000 feet (914 m) in elevation. Forest fires in 1893Kudish, 120 which destroyed 3,000 acres (12 km²) around the notch, mostly on the Plateau side, and the steep terrain have left depleted, thin soils where balsam fir and red spruce can be seen along the west (Hunter) side of the road from the pond up into the notch. Scrubby paper birch, also common to boreal forests, is the dominant deciduous species on the Plateau side.This can be confirmed by any visitor to the notch Most of the lands around the notch are protected areas of the Catskill Park portion of New York's Forest Preserve. The Plateau lands are the western end of the Indian Head Wilderness Area; Hunter's are currently classified a step lower, as the Hunter Mountain Wild Forest, though a pending update to the Catskill State Land Master Plan would combine it with other properties to classify it, too, as wilderness. Recreation A medium-sized parking lot sits next to Notch Pond (known in the early days as Lake Stygian) just below the notch, right where the popular Devil's Path hiking trail crosses the road (the only road crossing in its entire 24.2-mile (39 km) length). Most are bound for one of the three High Peaks in the area: Plateau, Hunter and Southwest Hunter. Potable water is available for hikers and people using the day-use facilities from several pumps next to the parking lot. The climb up Plateau offers the best chance to appreciate just how stark the notch is. After crossing the old railbed, the trail begins a steady ascent of 1,400 vertical feet (427 m) to the popular Orchard Point lookout, which offers a view across the notch to all the nearby peaks plus West Kill Mountain beyond Southwest Hunter. From there it is two miles (3.2 km) across the aptly named Plateau to the mountain's actual summit. To the west, the ascent is not so severe, although there are some steep sections, most famously near a ledge lower down on the trail called the Devil's Portal. There are no views, although there is a nice level section traversing along the back of Hunter to the Devil's Acre Lean-to, where the Hunter Mountain Trail leads to the top of the Catskills' second-highest peak. The Acre is also the beginning of the sometimes-difficult bushwhack to Southwest Hunter. Currently, the Long Path long-distance trail joins the Devil's Path here for the trip up Plateau after a two-mile (3 km) roadwalk. Future plans will relocate it into the deep forest, far from the highway. In winter, ice climbers can also be found here seeking thrills on the cliffs on the Plateau side via a short hike; climbing is not otherwise done much in the Catskills due to the loose sedimentary rock of the region. Snowboarders have also found the slope offers challenging wilderness runs. Hunters have also come in-season, although the topography can make the area fatally dangerous. In fall 2000 a local high school teacher was found dead after having fallen off one of the cliffs on the Hunter side during a hunt.

The ward was renamed Crosland Moor and Netherton in time for the 2011 Census. Its population at the Census was 18,723. St Luke's Hospital The former St. Luke's Hospital was situated alongside Blackmoorfoot Road. It was originally a workhouse for the poor and needy of the area in the 19th century. This ended up being a hospital that included the headquarters for the Calderdale & Huddersfield NHS Trust, a psychiatric unit and also other services such as physiotherapy. The hospital closed in December 2010 and over time, all the buildings on that site have been demolished and the site has been fenced off. However, in 2015 a plan to regenerate the hospital site with up to 200 homes, a retail unit and a small neighbourhood centre have been approved by councillors. Education Moor End Academy (formally Moor End Technology College) is Crosland Moor's secondary school based on Dryclough Road near Beaumont Park. Crosland Moor Junior School and the Crosland Moor and Dryclough Infant Schools are also on Dryclough Road. Beaumont Park At the end of Dryclough Road, Beaumont Park, Huddersfield's first park, begins. Opened in 1883, the park mainly consists of woodland and is on a hillside that looks over the Holme Valley and the Lockwood railway viaduct. It is currently being restored to its former glory by the Friends of Beaumont Park. Housing around the park is some of the most expensive in Huddersfield. William Horsfall and the Luddites Along Blackmoorfoot Road beyond the junction with Dryclough Road was the spot where in April 1812 mill owner William Horsfall was shot and killed by the Luddites George Mellor, William Thorpe, Thomas Smith and Benjamin Walker.Murder of William Horsfall - Rootsweb.ancestry.comHuddersfield Exposed - William Horsfall (1770-1812) They objected to the introduction of machinery at Horsfall's mill in Marsden. Walker turned informer, and the other three were hanged. A side street where the incident occurred was named after Horsfall (William Horsfall Street). Airfield Just off Blackmoorfoot Road beyond the Crosland Heath Golf Course is the Crosland Moor airfield which was established by the David Brown Engineering Works based in Lockwood. Even further up the road is Huddersfield's Observatory which is situated high over the town for good views of the sky at night. Before the airfield is the Wellfield quarry where Crosland Hill Sandstone comes from. According to the Building Research Establishment it is a durable stone not affected by acid rain or air pollution.

Life  Modarres-Sadeghi was born in Isfahan and moved to Tehran in 1972. While he was studying in the College of Literature and Foreign Languages in Tehran, he began to work as a journalist in a few dailies and literary magazines, writing reports, reviews and weekly columns. His first short story appeared in a literary monthly, Roudaki, in 1973. His first collection of stories, Children Don't Play Anymore, was published in 1977. His first novel, A Play, was published in 1980. The publication of this first novel coincided with the outbreak of Iran–Iraq War and was neglected by audience and critics. Modarres-Sadeghi's second novel, Gavkhooni (The River's End), published in 1983, was acclaimed as an avant-garde literary masterpiece a few years after its publication. It was translated into English in 1996, and was awarded a prize as one of the best novels of post-revolution era in 1998. A movie based on the novel, directed by Behrooz Afkhami, and produced by Ali Moallem, was made in 2003. It was shown in the Cannes International Film Festival, May 2004, in Directors' Fortnight section, and later in the 2004 Vancouver International Film Festival and a few other international film festivals in Asia. Modarres-Sadeghi has published six collections of short stories and seventeen novels. His latest novel, Behesht o Douzakh, was published in 2016.

It has a large white patch on its cheek, brown eyes, and a yellow panel on its wing. Taxonomy The white-cheeked honeyeater was described by Bechstein in 1811. Two subspecies are recognised: Phylidonyris niger niger in eastern Australia; and P. n. gouldii (Schlegel, 1872) in southwest Western Australia. The latter subspecies has a narrower white cheek-patch, slightly more black on the breast, and different vocalizations, which in future may lead to its classification as a separate species. The generic name Phylidonyris combines the term Phylidon or Philedon, used by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1817 for the friarbirds (now placed in the genus Philemon), with Cinnyris (Cuvier, 1816) for the sunbirds; the specific epithet derives from Latin niger 'black'.  Description  The white-cheeked honeyeater is a medium-sized black and white honeyeater, with a long, sturdy bill that curves downwards. It has large bright-yellow tail and wing panels, with a large conspicuous white cheek-patch on a mainly black head. The eye is dark brown and it has a long, tapering, white brow-line. Young birds have a yellow gape and brow and the plumage is dusky or dull brownish. It is gregarious, active and noisy with swift, erratic flight. It is in length; males weigh and females .Higgins, P., L. Christidis, and H. Ford (2020). \\"White-cheeked Honeyeater (Phylidonyris niger), version 1.0.\\" In Birds of the World (J. del Hoyo, A. Elliott, J. Sargatal, D. A. Christie, and E. de Juana, Editors). Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA. https://doi.org/10.2173/bow.whchon2.01 =Similar species= The New Holland honeyeater, Phylidonyris novaehollandiae, is very similar in size, shape and appearance, but can be distinguished by its white eye.Slater, Peter (1974) A Field Guide to Australian Birds: Passerines. Adelaide: Rigby. Simpson, Ken, Day, N. and Trusler, P. (6th edn., 1999). Field Guide to the Birds of Australia. Ringwood, Victoria: Penguin Books Australia . Other black and white honeyeaters are much smaller, including the crescent (P. pyrrhoptera), tawny- crowned (Gliciphila melanops) and white-fronted honeyeaters (Purnella albifrons).Although very similar in appearance, there is not much competition between white-cheeked and New Holland honeyeaters, as they choose different perching sites and have different nesting seasons. Cooloolah NP, SE Queensland, Australia Distribution and Habitat The white-cheeked honeyeater is endemic to eastern and south-western Australia. It ranges from east of the Great Divide in Queensland through coastal New South Wales, becoming scattered south to Jervis Bay. It also occurs in south-western Western Australia and from Israelite Bay, east of Esperance, to the Murchison River in Kalbarri National Park. The white-cheeked honeyeater is usually found in moist heathlands, as well as around paperbark swamps and wetlands, and in forests or woodlands with a heath understory. Occurring in both temperate and subtropical zones, they are found in parks, gardens and flowering street trees throughout their range. Not afraid of humans and adapting easily to settlement activity, they are sometimes killed by cats. Behaviour Mostly resident or sedentary, with some seasonal movement at edge of range. =Vocalization= The white-cheeked honeyeater has a distinctive yapping call \\"chwikup, chwikup\\"; a melodious \\"chippy-choo, chippy-choo\\" and a higher, repeated lilting \\"twee-ee-twee-ee\\" call given in display song-flight during the breeding season. =Feeding= White-cheeked honeyeaters feed mainly on nectar from the flowers of Banksia, eucalypt, Grevillea, bottlebrush and heath, and (in southwest Western Australia) Darwinia, Calothamnus and Dryandra species. They also glean insects on bark or sally and hover for them in the air. They often feed busily and noisily in small groups and may feed beside New Holland honeyeaters. =Breeding= White-cheeked honeyeaters pair monogamously for the breeding season, which can be at any time of year coincident with nectar availability, though peaking from August to November and March to May.Morcombe, Michael (2012) Field Guide to Australian Birds. Pascal Press, Glebe, NSW. Revised edition. Males defend breeding territories that can be held for several years. Males aggressively attack other birds of their own and other species during the breeding season, but not familiar birds such as their own mates, relatives and resident neighbours.Higgins, P.J., Peter, J.M. and Steele, W.K. (eds) (2001) Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic Birds, Volume 5 (Tyrant-flycatchers to Chats). Oxford University Press, Melbourne. There is not much competition between white-cheeked and New Holland honeyeaters, as they choose different perching sites and have different nesting seasons. The female builds a cup-shaped nest from twigs, strips of bark, and other plant materials, bound with spider web, and lined with plant down and pieces of flowers. The nest is placed low in forked branches of trees or shrubs, often close to the ground, but well-concealed in dense foliage or in grass below shrubs and ferns. A clutch of 2 or 3 eggs, each measuring , is laid. The eggs are whitish buff to pink, splotched with chestnut-red and slate-grey towards the large end.Pizzey, Graham; Doyle, Roy (1980) A Field Guide to the Birds of Australia. Collins Publishers, Sydney. The female incubates the eggs for 15 days. Both parents feed the nestlings for 15 days, then continue feeding the young for several weeks after fledging. Conservation Status The white-cheeked honeyeater is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List.

Situated on one of the most desolate and highest points of the region, it comprises three standing portal stones supporting a heavy horizontal capstone, and dates to the Neolithic period, probably between 4200 BC and 2900 BC. It the best known and most widely photographed of the approximately 172 dolmens in Ireland. The karst setting has been formed from limestone laid down around 350 million years ago. The dolmen was built by Neolithic farmers, who chose the location either for ritual, as a territorial marker, or as a collective burial site. What remains today is only the \\"stone skeleton\\" of the original monument; originally it would have been covered with soil, and its flagstone capped by a cairn. When the site was excavated in 1986 and again in 1988, around 33 human remains, including those of adults, children (and the remains of a much later Bronze Age infant) were found buried underneath it, along with various stone and bone objects that would have been placed with them at the time of interment. Both the human remains and the burial objects date to between 3800 BC and 3200 BC. Name Poulnabrone is an English phonetic transcription of Irish Poll na Brón. Brón is the genitive case of Irish word bró, meaning quern, so the name means \\"Hole (or Pool) of the Quernstone\\". It is sometimes wrongly translated as \\"Hole of Sorrows\\" (Poll na mBrón).Cunningham (2011), p. 31 Location and purpose Poulnabrone dolmen is situated in a rocky and unblemished field in the remote and high altitude townland of Poulnabrone, Kilcorney, close to the R480 road, 8 km south of Ballyvaughan. It is well outside the boundaries of the Burren National Park, contrary to some information sources suggesting otherwise. Its location would have been difficult of access at the time it was built, and it was probably used as a centre for ritual until well into the Bronze Age, with evidence that it was in use even into the early medieval Celtic era. It may have served also as a territorial marker in the Neolithic landscape, in a significant position widely visible from all around and close to the important north-south route from Ballyvaughan Bay south to the region where Kilnaboy now stands. It is possible that the inhabitants of the settlements near what is now Kilnaboy erected the structure to delimit the northern border of their territory, though it was also used for burials.  Design  View with karst limestone pavement in foreground Poulnabrone is the largest Irish portal tomb after Brownshill Dolmen in County Carlow. It is located on the remains of a mound, and consists of slab-like tabular capstone which is thirteen feet in length, 2 metres (6 ft) to 3 metres (10 ft) wide and 30 cm (1 ft) thick. Unusually for dolmens of this type, the capstone slopes towards the west.Westropp, Thomas Johnson. \\"Archaeology of the Burren: Prehistoric Forts and Dolmens in North Clare\\". Clare County Library, 1898. Retrieved 24 March 2019 The chamber's \\"roof\\" formed by this huge capstone is supported by two sets of slender upright parallel portal stones and orthostats (upright slabs), each about 2 metres (5 to 7 feet) high, which mark the entrance, and support the capstone from the ground, creating a chamber that tapers eastwards. Its cairn on average extends for 3 metres from the chamber.Lynch (1988), p. 105 The upright stones stabilise the chamber and, as they are placed directly on the limestone bedrock, would have been no higher during the Neolithic period.Weir (1980), p. 110 The entrance faces north, and is crossed by a low sill stone, which is positioned on an east-west crevice. Three stones just before the sill stone form an antechamber backfilled with earth and stones. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the tomb was probably in use as a burial site between 3,800 and 3,200 BC. The findings are now at the Clare Museum, Ennis, loaned from the National Museum of Ireland.Carthy (2011), p 136Poulnabrone Collection. Clare County Museum.

As the crack was thought likely to destabilise the tomb, two phases of conservation were undertaken, both overseen by Dr. Ann Lynch, Senior Irish Government Archaeologist at the National Monuments Service.\\"Minister Humpreys welcomes new report on Poulnabrone Portal Tomb, County Clare\\". Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, 18 July 2014. Retrieved 18 March 2019 The dolmen was dismantled, and the cracked stone replaced during excavations in 1986 and 1988. =Human remains= During the digs, the remains of around 33 people were found buried underneath the monument. All but one of the adults were under the age of 30. They were established as having lived between 3800 and 3200 BC, and because the ground did not become an ongoing burial site over millennia, they can be assumed to have been members of a specific elite. Personal items buried with them included a polished stone axe, jewelry in the form of bone pendants and quartz crystals, as well as weapons and pottery.Lynch (1988), p. 107 The fact that none of the skeletons was intact led to the conclusion that the site was not intended as an ongoing burial place: instead, the bodies were jumbled chronologically, rather than having been buried sequentially - although they were all found in the original strata. It was often difficult, or impossible, to distinguish the remains of each individual, or even establish their sex. Only one adult seems to have lived past 40.Lynch (1988), p. 106 Many of the bones showed signs of arthritis in the upper body, and the children's teeth showed evidence of illness and malnutrition. In most cases, the pathology and physical condition of the remains indicated lives spent in hard physical labour, and a life-span that ended before the age of 30, despite the theory that these were apparently high-ranking individuals. Two of the bodies show proof of major injuries: a skull and rib cage with depressed fractures, healed before death, and an adult male hip bone, pierced by the tip of a stone projectile and not healed, which means the injury occurred not much before the time of death. The bodies had been left elsewhere to decompose - in a protected location, as none of the bones show any signs of animal teeth marks. Only the bare bones were then taken here and deposited. As some of them show scorch marks, they may have been ritually purified by fire beforehand.Carthy (2011), pp. 136-38 During the Bronze Age (c. 1750 to 1420 BC), i.e. very much later, a newborn baby was buried in the portico, just outside the entrance.Carthy (2011), p 138 Tourism and preservation The site is relatively unblemished, despite being a popular tourist attraction. A rope provides a barrier between tourists and the dolmen in order to preserve the ancient stone, and it is requested that tourists do not go beyond this barrier or touch the dolmen. A large car park was opened in 2007 by the Clare County Council to deal with traffic problems caused by cars or coaches parking in the narrow road, guided by a 2005 estimate that put the number of annual visitors at 200,000.\\"Poulnabrone Dolmen Car Park: Traffic Management \\". burrengeopark.ie Retrieved 7 February 2015 In 2007, tension arose when Dr. Ann Lynch, the archaeologist who led the excavation of the site, requested that visitor facilities should be reduced in order to preserve \\"the spiritual quality of the landscape surrounding the tomb.\\"Deegan, Gordon. \\"Visitor Facilities at Dolmen Site to be Reduced\\".

The movie stars Ray Liotta as Frank Sinatra, Joe Mantegna as Dean Martin, Don Cheadle as Sammy Davis, Jr., and Angus Macfadyen as Peter Lawford. Despite his membership in the Pack, Joey Bishop (played by Bobby Slayton) is given minimal screen time, while John F. Kennedy (played by William L. Petersen), depicted as an on-and-off friend of Sinatra's, is given a more central role. Also featured in supporting roles are Željko Ivanek as Bobby Kennedy, Veronica Cartwright as Rocky Cooper (wife of Gary Cooper), Deborah Kara Unger as Ava Gardner, Megan Dodds as May Britt, Dan O'Herlihy as Joseph Kennedy, Robert Miranda as Sam Giancana, John Diehl as Joe DiMaggio and Barbara Niven as Marilyn Monroe. Don Cheadle won a Golden Globe for his performance as Sammy Davis Jr. The Rat Pack won three Emmy awards and earned several more nominations, including acting ones for Cheadle and Mantegna. Plot After a brief flash-forward to Frank Sinatra as an old man, saying \\"I miss my guys,\\" the movie's main narrative begins during high points in the solo careers of the Rat Pack: Dean Martin has become a big success despite the breakup of his partnership with Jerry Lewis; Sinatra's career is at its peak; Sammy Davis Jr., is making a comeback after a near fatal car crash in which he lost one eye, and standup comic Joey Bishop is gaining exposure as an opening act for the other three. The Pack becomes complete when Sinatra reconciles with actor Peter Lawford, who has been ostracized since being seen out publicly with Sinatra's ex-wife, Ava Gardner. Lawford has married Patricia Kennedy. Abandoning a notion to seduce Pat for his own amusement, Sinatra becomes more interested in her brother John F. Kennedy's political ambitions. He sincerely believes Jack Kennedy would be a great president, but he also feels having a friend in the White House could benefit his own public image. Sinatra arranges for the entire Pack to perform at a JFK campaign fund-raiser. Sinatra also knows Kennedy's infatuation with the opposite sex and introduces him to Marilyn Monroe, who begins seeing Kennedy behind the back of her husband, baseball star Joe DiMaggio. Kennedy's pompous father, Joseph P. Kennedy, feels Sinatra's mob ties might hurt Jack's chances of defeating Richard Nixon in the election of 1960. He insists that Sinatra help the campaign from behind the scenes only; hypocritically, he also asks Sinatra to use those same mob ties to swing the West Virginia unions' support Kennedy's way. Meanwhile, the Rat Pack continues to enjoy success in Hollywood and Las Vegas, often combining their stage acts for joint performances. They even parlay their friendship into a movie collaboration, Ocean's 11, working and playing together at the same time, enjoying wine, women and song. Davis is sometimes secretly hurt by the racist jokes of their stage act, especially after his girlfriend, actress May Britt, insinuates that the rest of the Pack is laughing at him, not with him. Davis has a more serious brush with racism when he and Britt announce their engagement, which results in a mixed-marriage protest in front of Davis's hotel. Davis day-dreams about scaring the protesters away with a song and dance routine in which he wields a gun. But he concedes the possible political repercussions of an interracial marriage. He postpones the wedding to avoid hurting Sinatra, who had agreed to serve as best man. In the White House, President Kennedy seeks to renew his friendship with Sinatra. The two go sailing and plan for Kennedy to stay at Sinatra's Palm Springs residence during an upcoming West Coast presidential trip. Thrilled by the idea, Sinatra returns home and arranges for a guest compound to be built for Kennedy and his entourage. However, the FBI finds a potential mafia link to the White House through a woman, Judy Campbell, who shared phone calls, and possibly affairs, with both Kennedy and mob boss Sam \\"Momo\\" Giancana after being introduced by Sinatra to each. Kennedy's brother, attorney general Robert F. Kennedy, insists that the President cancel his stay at Sinatra's house and cut off all ties to the entertainer. This enrages Sinatra, who had sunk a lot of money and time into the renovation and had been at least partially responsible for Kennedy's being elected president. Sinatra takes out his wrath on Lawford, who as Kennedy's brother-in-law was Sinatra's direct link to the White House. Lawford finds himself repeatedly serving as a messenger between Sinatra and the Kennedys, including JFK's secret dalliances with Monroe, and he is sick of it. Lawford dreads delivering the news of Kennedy's decision to cancel his visit to Sinatra's house and stay instead with Bing Crosby, a Republican. A furious Sinatra physically throws Lawford out of his home and vows never to forgive him. The movie depicts this incident as the beginning of the end of the Rat Pack's influence in both politics and entertainment.

Generally speaking, when it comes to things that are being contemplated as ostensible or potential signs of other things, neither the existence nor the uniqueness of the elements appearing in the sign relation is guaranteed. For example, the reference of a putative sign to its putative objects may achieve reference to zero, to one, or to many objects. A proper treatment of this complication calls for the conception of something slightly more general than a sign relation proper, namely, a sign relational complex. In effect, expressed in the roughest practical terms, this allows for missing data in the columns of the relational database table for the sign relation in question. Typically one operates on the default assumption that all of the roles of elementary sign relations are filled, but remains wary enough of the possible exceptions to deal with them on an ad hoc basis.

The borders of Byelorussia were greatly expanded in the invasion of Poland of 1939 and finalised after World War II. Following the German military disasters at Stalingrad and Kursk, a collaborationist Byelorussian self-government (BCR) was formed by the Germans in order to drum up local support for their anti- Soviet operations. The Byelorussian BCR in turn formed the twenty-thousand strong Belarusian Home Defence (BKA), active from 23 February 1944 to 28 April 1945. Assistance was offered by the local administrative governments from the Soviet era, and prewar public organizations including the former Soviet Belarusian Youth. The country was soon overrun by the Red Army. Devastated by the war, Belarus lost significant populations and economic resources. Many battles occurred in Belarusian and neighbouring territory. Belarusians also participated in regional conflicts. September 1939 – June 1941 The Molotov–Ribbentrop Non-Aggression Pact of August 1939 had established a non- aggression agreement between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, and a secret protocol described how Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland (Second Polish Republic) and Romania would be divided between them. In the Invasion of Poland of 1939 the two powers invaded and partitioned Poland, and to return the Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Moldavian territories in the North and North- Eastern regions of Romania (Northern Bucovina and Bessarabia). The Polish defense was already broken, with their only hope being retreat and reorganisation in the south-eastern region (the Romanian Bridgehead), when on 17 September 1939, it was rendered obsolete overnight. The 800,000 strong Soviet Union Red Army, divided into the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, invaded the eastern regions of Poland that had not yet been involved in military operations, in violation of the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. Soviet diplomacy were protecting the Ukrainian and Belarusian minorities inhabiting Poland in view of Polish imminent collapse. Polish border defence forces (Korpus Ochrony Pogranicza) in the east (about 25 battalions) were unable to defend the border, and Edward Rydz-Śmigły further ordered them to fall back and not engage the Soviets. This, however, did not prevent some clashes and small battles, like the defence of Grodno was defended by soldiers and local population. The Soviets murdered a number of Poles, including prisoners-of-war like General Józef Olszyna-Wilczyński. Ukrainians rose against the Poles, and communist partisans organised local revolts, e.g. in Skidel, robbing and murdering Poles. Those movements were quickly disciplined by the NKVD. Prior to the Soviet partisans support from the East, the Polish military's fall-back plan had called for long-term defence against Germany in the southern-eastern part of Poland (near the Romanian border), while awaiting relief from a Western Allies attack on Germany's western border. However, the Polish government decided that it was impossible to carry out the defence on Polish territories. There was retaliation to surrender or negotiate for peace with Germany and ordered all units to evacuate Poland and reorganize in France. Meanwhile, Polish forces tried to move towards the Romanian bridgehead area, still actively resisting the German invasion. From 17 September to 20 September, the Polish Armies Kraków and Lublin were crippled at the Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski, the second largest battle of the campaign. Oksywie garrison held until 19 September. Polish gained victory at the battle of Szack, and the Red Army reached the line of rivers Narew, Bug, Vistula and San by September 28, in many cases meeting German units advancing from the other side. The last operational unit of the Polish Army, General Franciszek Kleeberg's Samodzielna Grupa Operacyjna \\"Polesie\\", capitulated after the 4-day Battle of Kock near Lublin on 6 October, marking the end of the September Campaign. New borders of Byelorussian SSR after the invasion of Poland in 1939 Adolf Hitler had argued in Mein Kampf of the necessity of acquiring new territory for German settlement (Lebensraum) in Eastern Europe. However these plans were delayed through the period of the Phoney War, followed by the Nazi invasions of Norway, France and Benelux, Denmark, and the failed Battle of Britain. Polish citizens took an active part in the Soviet partisan movement in the occupied territory of the former USSR. 2,500 Polish citizens took part in the Soviet partisan movement in the territory of the Byelorussian SSR,В.

Патриотическая борьба советского народа в тылу врага в период Великой Отечественной войны. М., «Знание», 1970. стр.11 June 1941 - September 1941 At 04:45 on 22 June 1941, four million German soldiers, to be joined by Italian, Romanian and other Axis troops over the following weeks, burst over the borders and stormed into the Soviet Union, including the Byelorussian SSR. For a month the offensive was completely unstoppable north of the Pripiet marshes, as the Panzer forces encircled hundreds of thousands of Soviet troops in huge pockets that were then reduced by slower-moving infantry divisions while the panzers charged on, following the Blitzkrieg doctrine. Army Group Centre comprised two Panzer groups (2nd and 3rd), which rolled east from either side of Brest and affected a double encirclement at Belostok and west of Minsk. They were followed by 2nd, 4th and 9th Armies. The combined Panzer force reached the Berezina river in just six days, from their start lines. The next objective was to cross the Dnieper river, which was accomplished by 11 July. Following that, their next target was Smolensk, which fell on 16 July, but the engagement in the Smolensk area blocked the German advance until mid-September, effectively disrupting the blitzkrieg. Operation Barbarossa: the German invasion of the Soviet Union, 21 June 1941 to 5 December 1941 With the capture of Smolensk and the advance to the Luga river, Army Groups Centre and North had completed their first major objective: to get across and hold the \\"land bridge\\" between the Dvina and Dnieper. The German generals argued for an immediate drive towards Moscow, but Hitler overruled them, citing the importance of Ukrainian grain and heavy industry if under German possession, not to mention the massing of Soviet reserves in the Gomel area between Army Group Centre's southern flanks and the bogged-down Army Group South to the south. After a meeting held in Orsha between the head of the Army General Staff, General Halder, and the heads of three Army Groups and armies, it was decided to push forward to Moscow since it was better, as argued by head of Army Group Center, Field Marshal Fedor von Bock, for them to try their luck on the battlefield rather than just sit and wait while their opponent gathered more strength. Occupation and Collaboration 1941 - June 1944 Atrocities against the Jewish population in the conquered areas began almost immediately, with the dispatch of Einsatzgruppen (task groups) to round up Jews and shoot them. Local gentiles were encouraged to carry out their own pogroms. By the end of 1941, there were more than 50,000 troops devoted to rounding up and killing Jews. In three years of occupation, between one and two million Soviet Jews were killed. June 1944 - May 1945 thumb300pxSoviet advances from 1 August 1943 to 31 December 1944 In the summer of 1944 a balcony-shaped frontline had shaped following advances by the Red Army during late 1943. This invited an encirclement attack to cut off and destroy Army Group Centre. For Operation Bagration, as it was to be called, the Red Army achieved a ratio of ten to one in tanks and seven to one in aircraft over the enemy. At the points of attack, the numerical and quality advantages of the Soviets were overwhelming. More than 2.5 million Soviet troops went into action against the German Army Group Centre, which could boast a strength of less than 800,000 men. The Germans crumbled, with the loss of almost 400,000 men who were either overrun or encircled. Minsk, the capital, was taken on 3 July 1944, trapping 100,000 Germans. Ten days later the Red Army reached the prewar Polish border. In West Belarus, as the Red Army approached the Polish Home Army launched the Operation Tempest. Despite the war now passing out of Belarus, the Soviet Fronts name \\"Byelorussian\\" kept their name until the end of the war, and were to distinguish themselves in the battles in Poland and Germany in 1944 and 1945. In the Soviet Union the end of World War II in Europe is considered to be 9 May, when the surrender took effect Moscow time. This date is celebrated as a national holiday, Victory Day, or День Победы in Belarus, Russia and some other post-Soviet countries.

Ltd., he is considered an innovator of cookware design and engineering with his development of the Circulon and Anolon brands of cookware, which married nonstick surfaces to hard-anodized aluminum. Born 1947 in Hong Kong, he is one of seven children. He attended the University of Oregon, majoring in business, but switched to engineering. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Oregon State University in 1971. He returned to Hong Kong in 1971 to join his family's aluminum rolling mill, using its outputs to create a new business manufacturing and selling cookware. He released his first line in London, England in 1972; distribution centers in Liverpool, England and Milwaukee, Wisconsin followed in 1976 and 1980, respectively. In the 1980s, he converted his factory to the production of high-end nonstick cookware and in 1984 unveiled Circulon, the first line of hard-anodized, nonstick cookware on the market. When Circulon was introduced, the nonstick system was so unique in extending the durability of nonstick cookware that it was granted a patent. The unique Circulon Hi-Low surface and hard-anodized aluminum substrate made the pans at least three times more abrasion-resistant than any other nonstick cookware on the market. Anolon followed in 1986 as the first hard-anodized nonstick with a smooth cooking surface (and heavier-gauge aluminum than Circulon). Unfortunately, Cheng did not patent the hard-anodized nonstick process, which allowed competitors to develop similar products. He still develops unique technologies and products for Meyer, including Infinite Circulon's impact-bonded base and the Anolon Outdoor BBQ Pan, respectively. Cheng won the Humanitarian of the Year award from the Housewares Charity Foundation in 2002. In 1992, Cheng moved his family and main office of Meyer Corporation to Vallejo, California.

This article covers a 3 part developmental process that is observed in most reptiles, birds and mammals, including humans. Nephrogenesis is often considered in the broader context of the development of the urinary and reproductive organs. Phases Diagram shows the sequential development and degeneration of the pronephros and mesonephros, and the induction of the ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme during kidney development in mammals. The development of the kidney proceeds through a series of successive phases, each marked by the development of a more advanced kidney: the archinephros, pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros. The pronephros is the most immature form of kidney, while the metanephros is most developed. The metanephros persists as the definitive adult kidney. =Archinephros= The archinephros is considered as hypothetical or primitive kidney. =Pronephros= The pronephros develops in the cervical region of the embryo. During approximately day 22 of human gestation, the paired pronephri appear towards the cranial end of the intermediate mesoderm. In this region, epithelial cells arrange themselves in a series of tubules called nephrotomes and join laterally with the pronephric duct. This duct is fully contained within the embryo and thus cannot excrete filtered material outside the embryo; therefore the pronephros is considered nonfunctional in humans =Mesonephros= The development of the pronephric duct proceeds in a cranial-to-caudal direction. As it elongates caudally, the pronephric duct induces nearby intermediate mesoderm in the thoracolumbar area to become epithelial tubules called mesonephric tubules. Each mesonephric tubule receives a blood supply from a branch of the aorta, ending in a capillary tuft analogous to the glomerulus of the definitive nephron. The mesonephric tubule forms a capsule around the capillary tuft, allowing for filtration of blood. This filtrate flows through the mesonephric tubule and is drained into the continuation of the pronephric duct, now called the mesonephric duct or Wolffian duct. The nephrotomes of the pronephros degenerate while the mesonephric duct extends towards the most caudal end of the embryo, ultimately attaching to the cloaca. The mammalian mesonephros is similar to the kidneys of aquatic amphibians and fishes. =Metanephros= During the fifth week of gestation, the mesonephric duct develops an outpouching, the ureteric bud, near its attachment to the cloaca. This bud, also called the metanephrogenic diverticulum, grows posteriorly and towards the head of the embryo. The elongated stalk of the ureteric bud, called the metanephric duct, later forms the ureter. As the cranial end of the bud extends into the intermediate mesoderm, it undergoes a series of branchings to form the collecting duct system of the kidney. It also forms the major and minor calyces and the renal pelvis. The portion of undifferentiated intermediate mesoderm in contact with the tips of the branching ureteric bud is known as the metanephrogenic blastema. Signals released from the ureteric bud induce the differentiation of the metanephrogenic blastema into the renal tubules. As the renal tubules grow, they come into contact and join with connecting tubules of the collecting duct system, forming a continuous passage for flow from the renal tubule to the collecting duct. Simultaneously, precursors of vascular endothelial cells begin to take their position at the tips of the renal tubules. These cells differentiate into the cells of the definitive glomerulus. In humans, all of the branches of the ureteric bud and the nephronic units have been formed by 32 to 36 weeks of gestation. However, these structures are not yet mature, and will continue to mature after birth. Once matured, humans have an estimated two million nephrons (approximately 1,000,000 per kidney) but this number is highly variable ranging widely from approximately 300,000 to over 2 million per kidney.http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/703532_3 Migration After inducing the metanephric mesenchyme the lower portions of the nephric duct will migrate caudally (downward) and connect with the bladder, thereby forming the ureters. The ureters will carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder for excretion from the fetus into the amniotic sac. As the fetus develops, the torso elongates and the kidneys rotate and migrate upwards within the abdomen which causes the length of the ureters to increase.

Made in Iowa by a group of friends over 18 months, the movie documents a Star Wars fan's attempt to make an epic fan film of his own, only to become disillusioned by the process and turn on his friends. The movie centers on the motivations of fan filmmakers, and proved popular for encouraging other would-be filmmakers to not give up their own projects and enjoy the process. The Formula has been featured as a leading representative of the fanfilm genre, with print references in The Weekly Standard and The Times. It eventually screened theatrically, showing as an official selection at the 2003 Cedar Rapids Film Festival. Film Threat gave it a five-star (out of five) review, calling it \\"a great surprise to those seeking out a good Star Wars fanfilm that's not made up exclusively of angst-filled Jedi, stormtroopers, over the top villains, or whatever the norm is nowadays.\\". The Formula was the first film for directors Chris Hanel and Stephen Phelan, and both have gone on to filmmaking careers. Besides working as a video game designer, Chris Hanel also co-wrote and served as the VFX Supervisor for the series Return of Pink Five. The film is also notable because it was the first visual effects collaboration of Ryan Wieber and Michael Scott, who went on to create the popular lightsaber fight Ryan vs. Dorkman. Plot The film begins with the opening credits of a typical Star Wars fanfilm entitled \\"Bond of the Force\\". Gregory (Abe Peterka) plays Jacen Solo, and Jennifer (Rebecca Peterka) plays the offscreen voice of Jaina Solo. Jacen is on a forest planet searching for Anakin Solo, but only encountering a Sith Lord named Darth Katai, played by Zarth (Justin Whitlock). The two begin to duel, and it is an intense battle...until Greg misses his cue, incurring the wrath of writer-director Tom \\"Servo\\" Harrison (Chris Hanel). Tom gets into a fight with his friends, and they walk out on him. After a monologue based on High Fidelity, with Star Wars in the place of rock music, Tom reflects back a few months to the genesis of the fanfilm project. Tom, Greg, Jenny, and Zarth are seen hanging out at Excalibur Games, a hobby shop, playing the Star Wars pants game. Tom is revealed to be an employee at the store, working for store credit while he has his money saved up for film school. He claims the only downside to the job is the trekkies—specifically, two irate, Star Wars-hating ones named James (James Kropa) and Stewart (Michael Mulherin). The two enter the store, arguing over a discrepancy between the film Star Trek Generations and the Technical Manual. While waiting for Tom to get their new Star Trek cards, Stewart accidentally spills soda on a set of comics that Greg's boss ordered. Tom demands they pay for the damaged goods, and the Trekkies overpay him before leaving the store in a rush. Tom realizes that they can sell the undamaged books to Greg's boss for full price and pocket the money from the Trekkies. At Greg's suggestion, Tom combines the money with his remaining store credit and buys model lightsabers, which prompts the idea in his mind of making a Star Wars fanfilm. Tom, Greg, Jenny, and Zarth sit around discussing ideas for a plot for their fanfilm, deciding against a story about a mischievous not-good-but-not-evil Jedi, a story about a post-Return of the Jedi Boba Fett (sitting on his ass watching Jerry Springer all day), a story about all the sith in the galaxy competing for the master-and-apprentice positions, and a rock musical. Tom doesn't want to do just another lightsaber duel film, which had become a cliche in Star Wars fan films by that point, but because no one can agree on any of the other ideas, they decide to do a duel after all, much to Tom's frustration. Tom approaches the reluctant Trekkies to do the visual effects, offering them ten percent of his store credit (which was all already spent on the lightsabers). Tom ends up spending all his money on preproduction for the film, and finds himself no longer able to afford film school. He has a nightmare about his film being terrible, with poorly- rotoscoped lightsabers and a soundtrack by Meco. Back in the present, Zarth tells Tom he needs to \\"pull his head out\\". An irate Tom grabs a prop lightsaber, and the two enter a Matrix-inspired lightsaber duel fantasy sequence. When Zarth beats Tom, he asks him, \\"Do you think that's a real lightsaber you're holding?\\" Tom realizes he's been taking himself and the film too seriously, and has lost any sense of fun. On their way back to Excalibur Games, Tom and Zarth are stopped by Greedo. Greedo and Tom begin to play out a homage to Greedo's scene in A New Hope, until Zarth interrupts and points out that the gag has already been done—in Crapisode One. Back at Excalibur, the gang shows Greedo the scene in question. He flips out, complaining that a lightsaber fight is so overdone, but one Greedo scene is done before and suddenly it's off-limits. Jenny explains that a lightsaber duel is a formula, and can be personalized, but they can't add anything to a Greedo scene, because \\"in the end, you always wind up dead,\\" which Greg then proves by shooting Greedo in the head. Later that night, the gang is eating pizza, and Tom apologizes to the others for his behavior. When it is revealed that Tom had dressed up as Darth Maul for the midnight showing of Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, Tom recounts the story in a soliloquy reminiscent of Jaws. Tom then reveals how much he hated the movie, and how mad he was at George Lucas. Later, when he met his friends, he realized that no movie would have met his expectations. Now, he just wants to finish his fanfilm. The gang finishes shooting the duel, and holds the premiere in the store. Everybody is excited watching the film. After everybody else goes home, Tom reflects on the point of making a Star Wars fanfilm—to have fun. Your film may not be perfect, but you shouldn't care what others think, because in the end, \\"it's only a movie.\\" External links * The Formula at TheForce.net Review at Film Threat * The Formula review at The Fan Film Menace 2002 films 2002 independent films Fan films based on Star Wars American independent films American films English- language films Films about filmmaking Films shot in Iowa ","title":"The Formula (2002 film)"},{"id":"4300784","text":"is an autobahn in Germany, connecting Berlin and Munich via Leipzig and Nuremberg. It is the fifth longest autobahn spanning .  Route  Potsdam interchange The northern terminus of the A 9 is at the Potsdam interchange, where it merges into the A 10, also known as the \\"Berliner Ring\\", about away from the Berlin city limits. The shortest route from there into Berlin would be the A 10 (east) and the A 115 (AVUS). The southern end is in the Munich borough of Schwabing. On its way, the A 9 passes through the German states of Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, and Bavaria. West of Leipzig, the border between Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony crisscrosses along the autobahn. In Bavaria, long sections of the Nuremberg–Munich high-speed railway run parallel to the autobahn. History Plans for a European motorway connection from Berlin to Rome were already developed from 1927 by a private MüLeiBerl (Munich-Leipzig-Berlin) company. However, construction of the A 9 was not begun until the 1930s as part of the Reichsautobahn project set up by Nazi Germany. Mercedes-Benz touring coach. The bridge was later destroyed at the end of the war but rebuilt due to a West and East German cooperation until 1966. The river marked the inner German border It was inaugurated in sections, beginning in 1936 with the Strecke 16 between what is today's Schkeuditz interchange (present-day A 9 and A 14) near Leipzig and Bad Berneck im Fichtelgebirge, in length. With the opening of the second lane near Schnaittach in 1941, the last gap was closed. This makes the A 9 Germany's first completed autobahn. After World War II, the section from the inner German border to Berlin served as one of four transit access roads through East Germany (GDR) toward West Berlin during the Cold War era. Yellow signs with \\"TRANSIT\\" in black letters marked the allowed route. Distances were usually given towards Berlin - Hauptstadt der DDR (\\"Berlin - Capital of the GDR\\"), i.e. East Berlin. Despite funding from West Germany, road conditions were generally poor. The surface was made up of 1930s concrete slabs rather than blacktop or continuously cast concrete. A section in Thuringia between Schleiz and the Rodaborn rest area even was a cobblestone road, later paved over by the East German authorities until being replaced by concrete in the 1980s. Until the introduction of a new numbering system in 1974, the southern part was known as the West German A 3. Railbus crossing the A 9 near Bayreuth, 1986 After reunification, the continuous six-lane expansion of the A 9 from the Potsdam junction to the Nuremberg interchange was tackled as an important transport project German unit No. 12. With a traffic load of up to 50,000 vehicles per day near Bayreuth in 1990, the four-lane route was close to the capacity limit. As part of the six-lane expansion, the new route was relocated in some sections, as the old road has gradients of sometimes over seven percent and tight curve radii. For example, in the area of Münchberg south of Hof a viaduct was built to avoid the guidance of the highway through a fog valley, especially because in this section on October 19, 1990 a heavy pile-up with ten dead and numerous seriously injured had occurred. West of Bad Berneck in the Fichtelgebirge led the old carriageway on a bridge in the middle of the village Lanzendorf. This very stressful condition for the residents was eliminated with the new track construction; Today, the highway runs east of the village. Even before the expansion, the motorway church Himmelkron was built directly on the old carriageway and consecrated on 6 October 1996. The church building is therefore today a bit off the new route. The course was also changed at the connection point Trockau (43). The new route runs slightly east of the old one. The formerly very steep and extremely winding Trockauer Berg was defused by the laying of the route. At Hienberg between the junctions Hormersdorf (47) and Schnaittach (48), there are always different routes for the two lanes. The separation of the lanes was maintained in the six lane expansion, but the course changed. The rest stop Hienberg, which lay on the mountain of the same name, does not exist anymore. In 2001, the six-lane expansion, with the exception of three sections, was completed. The 120 million DM expensive conversion between the junctions Bayreuth-North and -Süd, which included a 320 -meter-long enclosure and noise barriers, dragged itself into the year 2006. After its completion, there were only in Thuringia track sections of the A 9 with four lanes without hard shoulder. These were on the one hand to the Hermsdorfer cross and on the other to 19 kilometers south of the junction Triptis at operating kilometer 205 and north of the junction Schleiz at operating kilometer 224. Another reason for the delay was the fact that in terms of financing new Tried ways and private investors were searched by tender, which should refinance on the truck toll (so-called A-model). It promises a higher quality of the road and a faster completion. According to the announcement of 4 August 2011, the consortium A9SixLanes from the companies VINCI Concessions (47.5%), BAM PPP (47.5%) and Reinhold Meister GmbH (5%) was awarded the contract for the expansion. The construction work was carried out by a construction consortium led by Eurovia, Wayss & Freytag (daughter of Royal BAM) and Reinhold Meister and started in 2012. The section was released on September 5, 2014. In November 2014, the remaining work was completed. The expansion of the A 9 took about 25 years. Despite the six-lane expansion still some structures of the original route have been preserved, such. B. the bridge in the Holledau at the rest area Holledau, the Saale bridge in the direction of Munich between Bad Lobenstein (29) and Rudolphstein (30) and the Tautendorfer bridge in direction Berlin between Hermsdorf-South (25a) and Lederhose (25b). Between the cross Rippachtal (19) and the exit Naumburg (21a) still lead three original bridges over the highway. The expressway along Hienberg ICE tracks along the expressway Furthermore, some service areas were closed and replaced during the expansion. Thus, on 30 June 2004, the rest area Rodaborn near Triptis was closed. It had been opened in 1928 as a tourist restaurant for the citizens of Triptis and was in 1936 with the completion of the Reichsautobahn to the first motorway service area in Germany. In GDR times, it was closed in the 1970s and reopened in 1986 only for transit travelers by the hospitality company Mitropa. At the same place an uncultivated parking lot was built after the closure. Also two resting places in Bavaria had to give way to the six-lane extension; on the one hand Sophienberg south of Bayreuth and Hienberg north of Nuremberg on the same mountain. In place of the former, an uncultivated parking facility was built, as a replacement for both facilities was built in 1999 at Pegnitz the service area Franconian Switzerland / Pegnitz.  Current condition and future plans  A 9 near Münchberg, Bavaria With one exception, Hermsdorf interchange, the A 9 has a profile of at least three lanes and one emergency lane per direction. The section between Neufahrn and the München- Nord interchange north of Munich was upgraded between 2004 and 2006 to four lanes each way. A survey of this section recorded an average number of 143,000 vehicles per day and a maximum of 184,000. Since 2006 talks have been underway about turning the three-way interchange Holledau into a four-way, and extending the A 93 into the Pfaffenhofen area. Further plans and visions include widening the Hermsdorfer Kreuz to six lanes, and widening the sections Nuremberg – Nuremberg-East and Holledau – Neufahrn to eight lanes. On January 26, 2015 German transport minister Alexander Dobrindt announced plans to outfit an as yet undesignated section of the A9 in Bavaria as a test track for autonomous cars.  Along the route  Vockerode Elbe Bridge tower, c. 1984 East of Dessau, the autobahn crosses the Elbe River via the long Vockerode Bridge. Built in 1938 according to plans designed by Paul Bonatz, it was replaced by a new construction in the course of the A 9 extension from 1996 to 2000. The prominent tower at the northern end is preserved, it was widely known to transit travellers for its Plaste und Elaste aus Schkopau (\\"plastic and elastomer from Schkopau\\") neon sign, now on display at the German Historical Museum in Berlin. Close to exit 10, Dessau-East, a gravel pit had provided material for the construction of the autobahn. After 1939 the pit was renaturated and became the \\"Reichsautobahnbad Mildensee\\", with cabins to change, and eateries. It is still in use today as a beach, but not under the old name. Dessau Racetrack with modern jersey barrier median =The Dessauer Rennstrecke= South of exit 11, Dessau-South, nearly ten kilometers of the roadbed — roughly from Thurland southwards to just north of the B 183 (ex-B 186) interchange (exit 12 for Bitterfeld/Wolfen of the modern A9 roadbed) — were upgraded with a paved-over median to become the \\"Dessauer Rennstrecke\\" (Dessau Racetrack), a 25-meter (82 ft) wide high-speed track intended for races and record attempts, such as by Rudolf Caracciola in 1938/39, Goldie Gardner in 1939 or those by Hans Stuck with the Mercedes-Benz T80 land speed record car, intended to start in January 1940 - the Rennstrecke segment itself had even been marked out on road maps as early as 1938.1930s German Road map for Reichsautobahn Berlin-Halle-Liepzig/today's A 9 with Rennstrecke annotation from 1938 With its pillarless bridges and no interchange exits before 1945, but especially with the straight alignment and the broad concrete surface without a distinct median, it was also intended to function as an auxiliary airfield in World War II. After the war, annual races were resumed from 1949 to 1956. The East German driver Paul Greifzu was killed in a training accident on 10 May 1952. The four-way interchange at Schkeuditz was the first cloverleaf interchange in Germany, as well as the first autobahn interchange in Europe. It was opened in 1936, two years before construction was finished. On June 30, 2004, Germany's oldest autobahn inn, Rodaborn near Triptis, was closed due to the upgrading of the old two-lane to the modern three-lane profile. Located near the source of the Roda River, the restaurant was opened in 1928 as a country inn for the local population and turned into a rest area on 20 December 1936 when the Reichsautobahn was opened. During the days of the GDR, it was run by the state-owned Handelsorganisation (HO) company, later by Mitropa. The rest area was open only for transit travellers, not for East German citizens. In 2009, in a loop of history, it was rented by a local couple to re-open it as an inn for local daytrippers. Though the connection to the adjacent autobahn parking lot is cut off by a fence, Rodaborn still is a popular stop for motorway travellers. Old and new Saale Bridge The Rudolphstein Saale Bridge south of Bad Lobenstein, an arch bridge designed by Paul Bonatz, was opened on 27 September 1936 and soon became an icon of the Reichsautobahn development program. Between 1945 and 1966 the A 9 was interrupted at the inner German border between Bavaria and Thuringia since an arch of the bridge had been blown up by retiring Wehrmacht forces near the end of the war. Traffic to and from West Berlin was diverted via A 72 until 1951 and from then until 1966 via B 2. Not until then the bridge could be rebuilt in a complicated joint venture of West and East German authorities. In the course of the autobahn extension, a second bridge was erected parallel to the original construction. The Frankenwald rest area near exit Rudolphstein is one of two rest areas in Germany with a restaurant bridging the road. In Lanzendorf near Bad Berneck, the autobahn passed right through the village on a bridge. The route was realigned during the construction after 1990. Right next to the old route, the autobahn church Lanzendorf was built. Sanctification took place October 6, 1996. Exit 40b, Bindlacher Berg, was until after reunification no public exit, but used exclusively by the US Forces stationed on the Bindlacher Berg. Until the upgrade to six lanes, from Bayreuth-Nord to Bindlach existed the last autobahn alley of trees in Germany. It has been replanted since. Near Trockau, the former steep and curvy section also was realigned after 1990. Exit 45, Weidensees, was called \\"Veldensteiner Forst\\" until the 1970s and was probably built on behalf of Hermann Göring, who had a hunt nearby. Weidensees itself did not merit its own exit. Interchange 51, Nuremberg, was originally a cloverleaf. It had been improved by adding a long, sweeping bridge from the northern lane of the A9 coming from Munich towards the A3 in the direction of Würzburg and Frankfurt, since the traffic in that direction was much heavier than the traffic heading north. The old, small curve in the former south-east quadrant still shows what is probably the original 1930's cobblestone. Despite the upgrade to six lanes total, some original bridges have been retained, but carry just one direction, like the bridge crossing the Saale at the old border crossing between Bavaria and Thuringia. From 2000 until construction began to upgrade to four lanes for each direction, the section between Neufahrn and Munich-Nord was among the first in Germany where it was allowed in appropriately heavy (and correspondingly slow) traffic to legally use the emergency lane as an additional traffic lane. Since further adding of two more lanes north of Neufahrn towards Holledau is not in sight, a similar regulation is considered for this section. Near exit 73, München-Fröttmaning, there's a Berlin Bear statue placed on the median (). Its equivalent is placed on the median of the A 115 (as the extension of the A 9 into Berlin) near former rest area Dreilinden, north of the former checkpoint Bravo . At the entrance to the rest area \\"Köschinger Forst\\", direction Berlin, there's a milestone with the inscription Berlin - 500 km.

California, 395 U.S. 752 (1969), is a 1969 Supreme Court of the United States case. In Chimel, the Court held that police officers arresting a person at home could not search the entire home without a search warrant, but police may search the area within immediate reach of the person.. The rule on searches incident to a lawful arrest within the home is now known as the Chimel Rule. Ronald M. George, the young deputy attorney general who unsuccessfully argued the State of California's position before the high court, ultimately became Chief Justice of the State of California. Background In the court case of Chimel v. California (1969), Police officers went into the home of Chimel with a warrant authorizing their arrest of Chimel on counts of burglary from a coin shop. The Police officers were let into Chimel's home by his wife where they awaited his return home to serve him with his arrest warrant. Upon receiving his warrant for arrest, “Chimel denied the request of officers to look around” his home for further evidence. Ignoring Chimel, the Police officers continued their search of Chimel's home “on the basis of the lawful arrest”, and the police even “instructed Chimel’s wife to remove items from drawers”, where she eventually found coins and metals. Later at Chimel's trial for burglary charges, “items taken from his home were admitted over objection from Chimel that they had been unconstitutionally seized”. However, a number of these items including the coins and medals that were taken from his home were used to convict Chimel. The “state courts upheld the conviction” of Chimel, even though he petitioned that the arrest warrant was not a valid warrant, considering that the Police officers searched his home and found evidence that they used against him, without having a search warrant for his house. Prior to Chimel, the Court's precedents permitted an arresting officer to search the area within an arrestee's \\"possession\\" and \\"control\\" for the purpose of gathering evidence. Based on the \\"abstract doctrine,\\" it had sustained searches that extended far beyond an arrestee's grabbing area. Issue Could the warrantless search of Chimel's entire house be constitutionally justified as incident to his arrest?  Decision  The Supreme Court ruled 6–2 in favor of Chimel. It held that the search of Chimel's house was unreasonable under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Court reasoned that searches \\"incident to arrest\\" are limited to the area within the immediate control of the suspect. While police could reasonably search and seize evidence on or around the arrestee's person, police were prohibited from rummaging through the entire house without a search warrant. The Court emphasized the importance of warrants and probable cause as necessary bulwarks against government abuse: It overturned the trial court conviction by stating that the officers could reasonably search only \\"the petitioner's person and the area from within which he might have obtained either a weapon or something that could have been used as evidence against him.\\" Criticism In a concurring/dissenting opinion in Riley v. California (2014), citing his dissent in Arizona v. Gant (2009), Justice Alito called Chimel's reasoning \\"questionable:\\" \\"I think it is a mistake to allow that reasoning to affect cases like these that concern the search of the person of arrestees.\\" See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 395 * Cupp v.

A farmer, he was nominated to prevent the loss of voters to the Populist Party. The Panic of 1893 occurred just before he took office, leading to severe economic problems during his term. Republicans took the Indiana General Assembly in the 1894 mid-term election and repudiated many of the Democrats' laws, leading to violence in the assembly. A popular party figure when he left office, he was a nominee to run for president at the 1896 Democratic National Convention, but lost his bid for the nomination to William Jennings Bryan. Early life =Family and background= Matthews was born in Bethel, Kentucky, on December 14, 1845, the son of Thomas A. and Eliza Ann Fletcher Matthews. His mother died when he was four months old, and his father sent him to be raised by an aunt in Kentucky. His father remarried in 1858, and he returned to live with them near Danville, Kentucky. He worked on the family's farm and attended Centre College and graduated in 1867. The same year he moved to Clinton, Indiana, where he met Martha Whitcomb, the daughter of former state governor James Whitcomb. The couple married on January 1, 1868, and had three children.Gugin, p. 204 =Early political career= Matthews purchased a farm and began to raise livestock and produce grain. He became prominent in the area because of his breeding program and the qualify cattle and horses he produced. In 1872 he was one of the founding members of the National Association of Breeders of Short- Horn Cattle. In 1876 he was elected to a seat in the Indiana House of Representatives and served a single term. In 1882 he ran for the state senate, but was defeated.Gugin, p. 205 In 1890, Democratic party leaders approached Matthews and encouraged him to run for Indiana Secretary of State. He was one of several men the party was grooming as a potential candidate for governor in the upcoming election. Democrats at that time were losing members to the Populist Party, and were seeking farmers to lead the party and help win back farming voters. He campaigned against Republican John B. Stoll and won the election by 20,000 votes. He continued in that office for two years before resigning to run for governor. He used his position to become a well-known advocate of the unlimited coinage of silver.Gugin, p. 206 Governor =Campaign= Matthews was nominated to run as the Democratic candidate for governor in 1893 and ran in the fall election against incumbent Republican governor Ira Joy Chase and Populist candidate Leroy Templeton. The campaign focused primarily on depressed farm prices and farmers desires to inflate the currency to alleviate debt problems. Matthews won the election by seven thousand votes. The Populist party failed to make significant gains in the state, and the election marked the party's decline in the state. Shortly before Matthews took office, the national economy was struck by the Panic of 1893, caused in part by the inflationary acts of the government, which Matthews supported in the campaign. In Indiana, it led to a large rise in unemployment, the bankruptcy of most of the state railroad companies, the collapse of many state banks, business failures, and a collapse in land value. Matthews came into office with projected budget shortfalls and threats of worker strikes across the state. =Strikes= Coal miners in southern Indiana made good on their threats and joined in a national strike. The strikers attacked railroad tracks to prevent strikebreakers from sending out shipments. Matthews called out nine companies of militia and sent them to forcibly break up the strikers and protect coal shipments. As the militia arrived to resolve the situation, and second large strike broke out in Hammond, as railroad workers seized control of an important railroad hub in northern Indiana, effectively shutting down a large part of the state's exporting via Lake Michigan. Matthews called up additional militia and dispatched them to break up the second strike. The legislature was not in session when Matthews ordered the militia to duty, but they approved of his actions when they gathered later in the year. Because they had not approved the call-up, no funds had been appropriated for paying the men, and Matthews borrowed over $40,000 on his personal credit to pay for the operations. The legislature agreed to reimburse him for his expense. In addition to fighting strikers, Matthews continued the policy of the previous governors of suppressing white cap organizations in the southern part of the state. Matthews had advocated in the campaign the banning of horse racing and prize fighting in the state. He successfully pressed the General Assembly to pass legislation banning the enterprises. He then dispatched the militia and state police to seize the horse tracks and fighting arenas in the state.Gugin, p. 207 =Conflict with the General Assembly= As the 1894 mid-term elections neared, Republicans were able to secure blame for the poor economic situation on the Democrats, and swept into power in the statehouse, taking strong majorities in both houses. The legislative districts created in 1890 were a subject of intense debate at the time; the legislature during the term of Governor Isaac P. Gray had created several gerrymander districts that favored Democrats. Republicans had contested the districting in the courts, who ruled the state must be redistricted. The Democrats had done so in 1893, but the Republicans overrode their redistricting upon taking power, and created their own plan which effectively reversed the situation and created pro-Republican gerrymander districts. The Republicans continued in their effort to repudiate the decade of Democrat control and passed a controversial bill that revoked all the legislation passed by the previous Democratic-controlled General Assembly and restored the governor's power to appoint people to office. The bill was passed on the final day of the legislative session, knowing that if the governor did not veto it before adjournment, it would become law. It arrived on Matthews's desk just minutes before adjournment; he promptly vetoed it and ran with his secretaries to try to return it to the assembly before it adjourned. He found the doors locked and called for help from fellow Democrats to beat down the door to the House of Representatives. A newspaper recorded that \\"Democrats and Republicans fought like beasts of forest\\" as the governor struggled to deliver the vetoed bill to the speaker. Republicans successfully beat back the Democrats just as the speaker declared an adjournment. Fighting continued for a half-hour after the adjournment before the Democrats withdrew. Matthews took the issue to the Indiana Supreme Court, who ruled in favor of the Assembly, effectively rolling back a decade of Democratic legislation.Gugin, p. 208 Before his term as governor ended, Matthews was nominated by David Turpie to run for president at the 1896 Democratic National Convention held in Chicago. Matthews was a leading candidate until the sixth ballot when his supporters switched to William Jennings Bryan after Bryan delivered an impassioned speech. Matthews left office and returned to his farm. He continued making occasional public appearances and delivering speeches. While delivering a speech in Montgomery County, he suffered a stroke and died three days later in an Indianapolis hospital on August 28, 1898. His body was returned to his home town and buried in a Clinton cemetery.

Born in Cyprus in 1936 into a nationalistic family; his father was interned by the colonial authorities during the insurrection in 1931. The family emigrated to the United States in 1950 but continued to support Cyprus' struggle for freedom, a link that led Gregoriou to the writing of the books Cyprus: A View from the Diaspora. He worked as a political science professor at the William Paterson University of New Jersey, has written numerous books on the Western geopolitical strategies in the Eastern Mediterranean, particularly the political forces of British colonialism, the Greek and Cyprus events responsible for the events leading to the de facto partition in 1974 and the Anglo-American policies outside and inside the United Nations to legitimize the facts on the ground created by the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus. Georgiou is highly critical of American foreign policies and ascribes the partitioning of Cyprus to an American plot as much as Turkish invasion. He has also criticised the war on Iraq and remarked that the Pentagon \\"needs to soil the Iraqi landscape with young blood\\", \\"a small price for oil, profits, and power for the political-military-industrial complex\\".. In a recent editorial, Georgiou disputed whether \\"the Pentagon, the CIA, the White House ever tell the truth\\".

His term coincided with the economic recovery following the Panic of 1893, and focused primarily on industrial regulations and advancement of agriculture. As governor during the Spanish–American War, he oversaw the formation as dispatch of the state levies and played an important role in changing national policy to allow African-Americans to serve as army officers. Early life James Atwell Mount was born in Montgomery County, Indiana on March 24, 1843, one of the twelve children of Atwell and Lucinda Fullenwider Mount. He received little formal education during the winter months when no farming could be conducted, and spent most of his youth working on his family's farm, and clearing land for use as pasture and fields.Gugin, p. 211 =American Civil War= He enlisted in the Union Army in 1862, during the height of the American Civil War, and was assigned to the 72nd Indiana Infantry. His regiment was part of the famous Lightning Brigade commanded by John T. Wilder. Mount gained a reputation for valor and bravery, and twice volunteered for charges against superior forces during the Battle of Chickamauga during September 1863. He remained in the service for the duration of the war and served primarily as a scout and skirmisher. During Sherman's march to the sea he was one of the leading scouts of the army, and was the first Union soldier to enter Georgia. He remained with the army throughout its destructive march across the state, and participated in the widespread scorched earth tactics of the campaign.Gugin, p. 212 =Farming= After the war ended, Mount returned to Indiana in 1865 where he used the money he had earned as a soldier to pay for schooling. He attend the Presbyterian Academy in Boone County and received a classical education. While in school he met Kate Byrd, who became one of his closest friends. He only had funds to complete one year at the university, and returned to his family's farm. Kate and Mount continued their relationship and fell in love, marrying after she graduated in 1867. The couple rented a small run-down house and farm in Montgomery County and began to work it. After working the farm for several years they were able to save enough to purchase it and all of its equipment. They soon had three children who grew to help them on the growing farm. They purchased neighboring land, eventually owning over and building a new large home. He called the estate Willow Brook. Mount was known for his business acumen in the community and was very good at predicting the most profitable times to sell crops. In his spare time, he would lecture and teach at a county agricultural school to help other farmers learn advanced farming techniques and methods to get the greatest income from their crop sales, primarily through marketing timing and group negotiations. Mount became instrumental in the formation of several farming co-ops and became well known in the region. Political career =State Senator= Mount had been approached several times to run for public office by the Republican Party, to which he belonged, but had always refused. In 1888 he was nominated to run for the Indiana State Senate, despite his protests. The party at that time was losing farming votes to the Populist Party, and bringing farmers to the ticket was seen as a way to reverse the trend. He reluctantly accepted the nomination expecting to lose, but won the election in an ordinarily Democratic-controlled district. In the Democratic-controlled Senate he submitted no legislation of his own, but did support several measures he believed would benefit the farming community, including increasing funding for state agricultural programs. In 1890, his party nominated him to run for Congress, again against his wishes. He again reluctantly accepting, believing he would be defeated and not have to serve in the office. He was overwhelmingly defeated in the election, finished out his two remaining years as a state senator, and returned to his farm in 1892. The following year the nation was adversely affected by the Panic of 1893, leading to a collapse of farm and produce value. Across the state, farmers began to lose their land to their lenders. The following year in the 1894 mid-term elections the Republicans swept to power in the statehouse, and took control of the Indiana General Assembly. As a farmer, Mount was also affected by the economic downturn and decided a return to politics was the best way he could help the situation.Gugin, p. 213 =Governor= Mount sought his party's nomination for governor, and won, being aided by his farming background which was believed to give him an edge in the campaign. The primary issue of the campaign was national, the unlimited coinage of silver money, which would cause inflation, which farmers believed would alleviate their financial problems. Although the issue could only be resolved at the federal level, it dominated the state campaign as well, and Mount openly supported the measure. Mount won the election by plurality, defeating the Democratic candidate Benjamin by over 26,000 votes. Mount had become president of the State Horse Thief Detective Association in 1892. It was a vigilante group that privately defended country farmers, leading him to change the policy of recent Governors who were attempting to suppress such white cap groups. Although he actively sought the governor's seat, he soon came to dislike it and wanted to leave office. Mount's primary dislike from the job arose from the constant lobbying of individuals for patronage jobs and party leaders' demands. Several progressive agenda items were enacted during his term, including compulsive school attendance laws, requiring all children between age eight and fourteen attend school. Anti-trust laws, a number of industry regulations on worker health and safety, and food and drug quality were also passed during his term. The economy began to recover shortly after his term began, increasing state revenues and taking pressure off of the government. A coal miners strike was still continuing when his term began, so he dispatched two commissioners to determine the problems who successfully ended the strike with promises of regulatory reform. Mount's primary concern remained to be the farming community. He advocated granting more power to the state agricultural department. Among the authority it was granted was the ability to enforce quarantines on diseased farm animals, the ability to inspect farms for disease, and promotion of fruit crops.Gugin, p. 214 The Spanish–American War began during the second half of Mount's term, and he was responsible for preparing the Indiana's levies. Indiana had maintained regiments of black troops since the Civil War, and Mount activated two of their companies to serve in the new conflict. The United States War Department refused to accept them unless they were commanded by white officers, leading to a dispute with Mount. Most blacks in Indiana were Republican at the time, and the party did not want to alienate them given the recent string of close elections. Mount objected strongly to the War Department demand and enlisted the support of Indiana's senator, Charles W. Fairbanks. Mount and Fairbanks both spoke with President McKinley to demand that he allow the blacks companies to be commanded by black officers. McKinley complied, making the first steps towards the racial equality and integration of the United States Army. Mount received national attention in the last year of his term when he refused to extradite William S. Taylor to Kentucky. Taylor was a Republican candidate for Governor of Kentucky in the 1899 election, and was believed to have been involved in the murder of his Democratic opponent after making accusations of vote fraud. Mount ordered state police to protect Taylor who remained in Indiana for the rest of his life. Mount left office on January 14, 1901, and was relieved and happy to return to his farm. In his farewell speech he called it the happiest day of his life. Two days later, January 16, as he was preparing to leave the capitol and return home, he died of a heart attack in his Indianapolis apartment. His body lay in state for three days before he was returned to be buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Crawfordsville, Indiana.Gugin, p. 215 Electoral history See also *List of Governors of Indiana *Indiana White Caps References Notes Bibliography * External links * Indiana Historical Bureau: Biography and portrait * [Obituary] *National Governors Association *James Mount at FindAGrave 1843 births 1901 deaths American Presbyterians Governors of Indiana Indiana Republicans Indiana state senators People of Indiana in the American Civil War People from Indiana in the Spanish–American War Republican Party state governors of the United States ","title":"James A.

Müller called his development Hornhautlinsen or 'corneal lenses'. His efforts to develop a new corrective lens were ultimately unsuccessful, since a patient could only tolerate the lens bearing down heavily on the sclera for half an hour, less than those of Fick. Moreover, it had to be inserted underwater to prevent trapping air bubbles, and cocaine administered to anaesthetise the eye, but he did however lay the groundwork for later researchers and his ideas and recommendations on fit, tear flow and rounded edges still form the basis for contact lens fitting today.

Background A successful design rule check (DRC) ensures that the layout conforms to the rules designed/required for faultless fabrication. However, it does not guarantee if it really represents the circuit you desire to fabricate. This is where an LVS check is used. The need for such programs was recognized relatively early in the history of ICs, and programs to perform this comparison were written as early as 1975. These early programs operated mainly on the level of graph isomorphism, checking whether the schematic and layout were indeed identical. With the advent of digital logic, this was too restrictive, since exactly the same function can be implemented in many different (and non-isomorphic) ways. Therefore, LVS has been augmented by formal equivalence checking, which checks whether two circuits perform exactly the same function without demanding isomorphism.Fabio Somenzi and Andreas Kuehlmann, Equivalence Checking, chapter 4 (volume 2) of Electronic Design Automation For Integrated Circuits Handbook, by Lavagno, Martin, and Scheffer, Check LVS checking software recognizes the drawn shapes of the layout that represent the electrical components of the circuit, as well as the connections between them. This netlist is compared by the \\"LVS\\" software against a similar schematic or circuit diagram's netlist. LVS checking involves following three steps: # Extraction: The software program takes a database file containing all the layers drawn to represent the circuit during layout. It then runs the database through many area based logic operations to determine the semiconductor components represented in the drawing by their layers of construction. Area based logical operations use polygon areas as inputs and generate output polygon areas from these operations. These operations are used to define the device recognition layers, the terminals of these devices, the wiring conductors and via structures, and the locations of pins (also known as hierarchical connection points). The layers that form devices can have various measurements performed to and these measurements can be attached to these devices. Layers that represent \\"good\\" wiring (conductors) are usually made of and called metals. Vertical connections between these layers are often called vias. # Reduction: During reduction the software combines the extracted components into series and parallel combinations if possible and generates a netlist representation of the layout database. A similar reduction is performed on the \\"source\\" Schematic netlist. # Comparison: The extracted layout netlist is then compared to the netlist taken from the circuit schematic. If the two netlists match, then the circuit passes the LVS check. At this point it is said to be \\"LVS clean.\\" (Mathematically, the layout and schematic netlists are compared by performing a Graph isomorphism check to see if they are equivalent.) In most cases the layout will not pass LVS the first time requiring the layout engineer to examine the LVS software's reports and make changes to the layout. Typical errors encountered during LVS include: # Shorts: Two or more wires that should not be connected have been and must be separated. # Opens: Wires or components that should be connected are left dangling or only partially connected. These must be connected properly to fix this. # Component Mismatches: Components of an incorrect type have been used (e.g. a low Vt MOS device instead of a standard Vt MOS device) # Missing Components: An expected component has been left out of the layout. # Parameter Mismatch: Components in the netlist can contain properties. The LVS tool can be configured to compare these properties to a desired tolerance. If this tolerance is not met, then the LVS run is deemed to have a Property Error. A parameter that is checked may not be an exact match, but may still pass if the lvs tool tolerance allows it. (example: if a resistor in a schematic had resistance=1000 (ohms) and the extracted netlist had the a matched resistor with resistance=997(ohms) and the tolerance was set to 2%, then this device parameter would pass as 997 is within 2% of 1000 ( 997 is 99.7% of 1000 which is within the 98% to 102% range of the acceptable +-2% tolerance error) ) Software = Commercial software = * Assura, Dracula and PVS by Cadence Design Systems * Calibre by Mentor Graphics * Guardian LVS by Silvaco * Quartz LVS by Magma Design Automation * IC Validator by Synopsys * PowerLVS by Polyteda LLCPOLYTEDA LLC * VERI and HVERI by Zeni EDA =Free software= * KLayout https://klayout.de/ * Magic http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/ References Electronic circuit verification ","title":"Layout Versus Schematic"},{"id":"4300935","text":"Samuel Moffett Ralston (December 1, 1857 - October 14, 1925) was a Democratic politician, the 28th Governor of Indiana and a United States Senator from the U.S. state of Indiana. Born into a large impoverished family, he took many jobs as a child including working in a coal mine. He taught school and studied law, becoming a prominent state lawyer. He became active in his local politics and eventually secured the Democratic nomination for governor. Because he served during the state's 100th anniversary he is sometimes called the Indiana's Centennial Governor. He was responsible for implementing many progressive era reforms in the state and putting down a violent riot in Indianapolis. He had become popular among the national Democratic party as the front-runner for the Presidential nomination in 1924, but he dropped out of the race because of his failing health. Early life =Family and background= Ralston's childhood home in Owen County Samuel Ralston was born near New Cumberland, Ohio, on December 1, 1857 the second child of John and Sarah Ralston. He was of Scottish descent, his great-grandparents immigrated to Pennsylvania in about 1760. His older brother John had died at age three, shortly before Samuel's birth. In 1865 the Ralston family moved to Owen County, Indiana where John purchased a large farm and began to raise livestock.Dunn, p. 1228 His boyhood home, the Moffett-Ralston House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Ralston, and his three brothers and four sisters, worked on the family farm to help the family subsist. The family suffered from financial difficulty and lost their farm in 1873, they then moved to Fontanent, Indiana. He took up employment in a butcher shop and later worked in a coal mine to help provide income for the family. His father later opened a butcher shop of his own returning the family to prosperity. =Education= Jennie Craven, Ralston's second wife As a boy he attended public school in Owen County, Indiana. As he grew older, he began working as a school teacher during the winter months while attending college during the summer. After completing high school he married Mary Josephine Backous on December 26, 1881; she died six months later. Ralston graduated from Central Indiana Normal College in Danville, Indiana in 1884 having completed a scientific course, but was interested in learning law after attending trial as a spectator. Ralston read law in the office of Robinson & Fowler. Unable to afford boarding, he spent several months sleeping on the sofa of the law office. He began a formal course in September 1884 and was admitted to the bar on January 1, 1886. In June he opened a law practice in Lebanon, Indiana with partner John A. Abbott, there he remained for several years. He became well known in the state for skills, and was soon one of Indiana's preeminent lawyers, mostly representing businesses.Dunn, p. 1229Gugin, p. 245 While attending college he met Jennie Craven and began courting her. The couple later married on December 30, 1889. Together they had three children, Emmet, Julian, and Ruth. The family was Presbyterian and attended church regularly. Ralston had also become a member of the Young Men's Democratic Club and took an interest in politics and began stumping on behalf of Democrat candidates. =Early campaigns= Ralston had been a Democrat for all of his adult life. Living in a Republican dominated area though, he had a difficult time to obtain political office. He ran for the Indiana State Senate in 1888 but was defeated. In 1896 and 1898 he ran for Indiana Secretary of State but was defeated both times. During his times running for office, he became friends with party boss Thomas Taggart. Taggart attempted to have Ralston nominated to run for governor in 1908 because of Ralston's anti- prohibition position, but was defeated at the party convention by prohibitionist and future Vice President of the United States Thomas R. Marshall. In 1908, Ralston was elected President of the Lebanon School Board and served until 1911, his first election victory.Gugin, p. 246 Governor In 1912 Taggart again supported Ralston's nomination for Governor, and this time succeed and was nominated on March 17. Ralston received the endorsement of numerous groups in the state, including the women’s suffrage movement and many churches. Ralston won the general election by plurality and became the Governor of Indiana on January 13, 1913, defeating Progressive candidate Albert Beveridge, and the Republican candidate former Governor Winfield T. Durbin.Dunn, p. 1230 =Indianapolis riots= One of the first events Ralston became involved in was a strike by the street car workers in Indianapolis that began in October. The strike was called on the week of the city elections and Republicans accused the strikers of trying to prevent them from voting. The union demanded the passage of a law to better protect what they believed to be their rights and wanted the governor to call a special session of the Indiana General Assembly to pass such a bill. The strike quickly grew into a citywide riot as the growing mob began to attack police, business leaders, and public officials. Business leaders and Mayor of Indianapolis Samuel Shank demanded the governor call out the army and end the strike, but the unions threatened violence if that happened. On November 5 Ralston finally called out the entire Indiana National Guard and put the city under martial law. At noon on the 6th, the strikers and their sympathizers gathered around the Indiana Statehouse and began chanting a demand that the troops leave the city. Ralston exited the building and spoke to the crowd offering to withdraw the troops if the strikers would go back to work and negotiate peacefully. He offered concessions and promises that convinced the strikers of his good intentions effectively ended the strike that day. After several days passed, and it became apparent that the strike was truly over, he demobilized the guard.Gugin, p. 248 When the General Assembly convened, Ralston was able to have several acts passed that led to improved working conditions for many workers in the state. Among the laws he advocated and passed were acts banning the sale of narcotic drugs for the first time, a minimum wage, conservation measures to prevent deforestation, incentives to encourage development of the livestock industry, free vaccinations for several prevalent diseases, and aid in helping the blind find work. His signature work though was his target of the tenement slums in the state. He successfully lobbied for funds to provide running clean water, children's playgrounds, and several other improvements to the living conditions of the urban poor. The final bill he signed empowered the state police to close the brothels in the state, which effectively ended any forms of legal prostitution in Indiana. =Progressive agenda= Thomas R. Marshall, Ralston's predecessor, had attempted to have a new constitution adopted but his plans were ruled unconstitutional by the Indiana Supreme Court who ruled a constitutional convention needed to be held. Ralston also favored creating a new constitution to enact numerous reforms that under the present constitution would have been illegal. To accomplish this goal, he began urging the General Assembly to call a constitutional convention. A bill was passed by the assembly in 1913 to permit the state to adopt a new constitution. The measure had to be submitted to a statewide referendum, as required by the current constitution, before the convention could be held. Outside of Indianapolis and the few industrial cities, there was little support for reform for industrial workers, the majority of the state's population was still rural. When the public voted in 1914, the measure was defeated, 235,140-338,947.Kettleborough, p. 214Gugin, p. 247 His two projects with the longest impact on the state were the Utilities Law and the Vocational Education Act. Ralston advocated and obtained significant increases in education spending and began a system of free vocational education for the state's school students. The regulations he enacted on the public utility companies began a process that would take running water and electricity to the entire state. The state park system and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources were created along with several state parks. Carl G. Fisher lobbied Ralston to help him promote the creation of a large highway project. At his urging, Ralston helped launch an ambitious project to build a major inter- state highway. He arranged a meeting of seven governors and was able to sell them on a plan to build a highway throughout their states connecting Jacksonville, Florida with Chicago, Illinois with each state funding its portion of the road. About twenty percent of the road's length would run through Indiana. The road was largest highway project in the United States up until that point, and resulted in the creation of the Dixie Highway, now US-31.Dunn, p. 1231 Other important measures were passed during his term including Indiana's first worker's compensation program, the creation of the state's primary election system, and the creation of an inheritance tax. He also made substantial contributions to the state's financial situation. The state had been in debt since the start of the internal improvements in the early 1830s and had twice verged on total bankruptcy, in 1847 and 1863, and once entered a partial bankruptcy in 1841. Although the state was not in immediate financial risk, it was still heavily burdened by debt. Ralston was insistent on paying off the state's debt and creating a rainy day fund, and advocated amending the constitution to prevent the state from borrowing funds in the future. Through a combination of spending cuts and increased taxation and with the support of the General Assembly, the government was able to pay off the entire state debt and create a $3.76 million surplus fund by the time he left office. =World War I= As the United States entered World War I, Ralston was called on by United States President Woodrow Wilson to help ready Indiana's levies. Numerous regiments, totaling more than 130,000 men, were mustered in Indiana and sent overseas in the state's largest deployment since the American Civil War. With most of the Indiana National Guard out of the state, Ralston reactivated the Indiana Legion, which had recently been renamed the Liberty Guard, an organization that had not seen action since the American Civil War. In 1916 tensions began to increase between the United States and Mexico and there was a possibility of war. The majority of the American forces were at that time in Europe, and Wilson requested Ralston to mobilize a full brigade of Hoosiers to defend the Mexican border. It was the largest single unit call the state had responded to, as the federal government typical only called out regiments. Several thousand men were quickly assembled and dispatched to the border. Historians note that Ralston had one of the most eventful terms in the state's history, and faced more challenges than any governor, except for Oliver Morton. The state constitution prevented him from seeking a second term as governor, and he left office on January 8, 1917 after delivering a farewell address and urging the General Assembly to adopt additional progressive legislation that he was unable to have passed during his term. U.S. Senator Ralston campaigned for the United States Senate beginning in 1922. Because of his friendly relationship with the Indiana branch of the Ku Klux Klan, he was able to get their endorsement. Ralston delivered a speech at St. Mary's of the Woods where he condemned religious interference in state affairs. The Klan's primary goals at the time were to remove all Catholic influence from the government and public schools, and to shut down Catholic private schools. His speech earned him considerable popularity among the group who said he \\"was not afraid to tell off the papists to their faces.\\"Charmers, p. 167 The Klan was one of the most influential groups within the state at the time, and it reprinted and circulated his speech. The Klan's support of Ralston was one of its most forceful attempts to have a candidate elected in Indiana, as it feared the Republican candidate who had publicly condemned the organization. The Klan fell apart in 1926--the year after Ralston's death--after a scandal, revealing that the majority of Indiana's politicians, including Ralston, had ties to the Klan. Ralston won election to the United States Senate from Indiana, defeating Albert Beveridge in November 1922. The New York Times ran a lengthy story on his wife, referring to her as a \\"Chicken Farmer\\" because she was reluctant to move to Washington D.C., she did not want to leave her chickens unattended. He took up his Senate seat on March 4, 1923. In the senate he advocated the adoption of the Mellon tax plan, which was effectively a wealth redistribution plan. In 1924 he was the front runner and expected to be the Democratic presidential nominee, but for reasons that were unknown at the time, he dropped out of the race just before the national convention. He later revealed that due to his failing health he did not believe he was fit to become President. His steadily worsening health lead to his death on October 14, 1925, his home near Indianapolis. He was buried in the Oak Hill Cemetery in Lebanon.

Ralston"},{"id":"4300938","text":"Warren Terry McCray (February 4, 1865 near Brook, Indiana – December 19, 1938 in Kentland, Indiana) was the 30th Governor of the U.S. state of Indiana from 1921 to 1924. He came into conflict with the growing influence of the Indiana Ku Klux Klan after vetoing legislation they supported. His personal estate was threatened with bankruptcy during his term and he solicited loans via the mail in order to help maintain his home and took a questionable loan from the State Department of Agriculture. The Indiana Attorney General was a Klan member and used the opportunity to bring a suit against the governor for embezzlement for which he was found not guilty. Immediately after the embezzlement case failed, a new case was launched in federal court claiming he had solicited private loans in a fraudulent way. He resigned from office after his conviction for mail fraud and served three years in federal prison before being paroled in 1927 and pardoned by President Herbert Hoover in 1930. Early life =Family and background= Warren Terry McCray was born near Brook, Indiana, on February 4, 1865, to Greenberry Ward and Martha (Galey) McCray. His friends and family called him \\"Warnie\\". He had two sisters, Annie Eliza and Fannie. At age five he moved to Kentland, Indiana where he grew up attending a local public school. His father and uncle formed a successful livery business there. From an early age, McCray was encouraged to find a way to make money, and began growing vegetables and selling them door to door as a young boy. As he grew older he began taking care of cattle of townspeople who did not have enough land for them to graze. For a fee, he drove the cattle into a pasture outside of town during the day and returned them in the evening.Gugin, p. 260. In April 1874, his uncle died and his father took on new partners. They soon purchased the Discount and Deposit Bank of Kentland and began to accumulate considerable wealth. As a teenager, McCray took a job in the bank as a bookkeeper. After completing high school in 1882 his father offered to send him to college, but the young McCray choose to instead remain working at the bank. By 1885 he had grown tired of his banking job, and decided to go into business on his own. With a friend, Willis Kirkpatrick, he purchased a town grocery store which was immediately very profitable. He used his income from the store to invest in railroad and mining stock, but mostly to buy land. He also made a significant investment in grain elevators and became President of the National Grain Dealers Association.Gugin, p. 261. McCray soon owned a large tract of quality farmland surrounding a large pond outside of Kentland which he named Orchard Lake. He married Ella Ade, the daughter of one of his father's business partners and sister of writer George Ade, on June 15, 1892. The couple had four children, although one died as an infant. McCray became interested in breeding cattle and began building a herd of specialized breeds. His reputation in the cattle community grew rapidly and he established a show barn and auction house and began selling his quality bred cattle, quickly growing his fortune.Gugin, p. 262. =Local politics= McCray became involved in local civics organizations and served on the country school board for one term in 1890. A devastating fire struck Kentland a few years later, and the county placed him in charge of overseeing several projects to rebuilding the town. He gained a reputation for getting things done quickly and cost effectively, and ran for a seat on the town council the following year. There, he successfully advocated the modernization of the town by paving the roads, building an electric plant, installing street lighting, building safer railroad crossings, and several other projects. The tax increases needed to pay for the projects turned out to be too much, and he was voted out of office after one term. His activities gained him notice by the state party leaders who helped him to gain a seat on the state committee in the summer of 1896. He traveled to Washington D.C. in 1901 to attend the inauguration of President William McKinley and came back convinced he should pursue politics. The same year he was appointed by Governor Winfield T. Durbin as a trustee of the Northern Hospital for the Insane, serving as treasurer. He remained on the board for twelve years. In 1912, he was appointed to the State Board of Agriculture, and became President of the board in 1915. His success at implementing reforms as a board member helped his popularity in the state.Gugin, p. 263. =State politics= McCray decided to run for governor in the 1916 Republican primary, but was defeated by the well connected former state party chairman, James P. Goodrich. McCray returned to his board duties, which expanded as World War I broke out. Goodrich appointed him Chairman of the Food Conservation Committee of Indiana and a member of the United States Live Stock Advisory Committee to help ensure adequate army supplies and rationing during the war. In 1922 he became Chairman of the Corn Belt Advisory Committee of the War Finance Corporation which sought government assistance for farmers. McCray was also very involved with the Red Cross and led several fund raising drives to help the organization. In 1920 McCray considered running for governor in the Republican primary again, but decided against it and to instead support Will H. Hays in his run. Hays, however, announced he would not be running and instead backed McCray. In the primary, he ran against five other candidates, who attacked him primarily over his war record, as some Republicans were not supportive of the war effort, and for his business practices. The charges proved ineffective, and McCray won the primary defeating his closest competitor by over 50,000 votes.Gugin, p. 264. Governor =Reforms= In the general election, McCray was opposed by Democratic congressman Carleton B. McCulloch. McCulloch was a war veteran and a doctor and the campaign focused largely on the progressive agenda. The election was highly contested and remains the election with highest voter turnout in state history, most polling places having a turnout near 95%. The election was a landslide for Republicans across the board, as they increased majorities in both houses of the Indiana General Assembly. McCray came to office and in his inaugural address he all but declared an end to the Progressive Era, stating that people demanded \\"a season of government economy and a period of legislative inaction and rest.\\" He and the Republican majority in the General Assembly began rolling back several key regulatory laws and attempted to cut back on government spending. McCray focused attention on what he considered the useful and necessary state institutions and undertook an expansion of the education system by building dozens of new schools, constructing the first new state prisons in several decades, enlarging state hospitals, and building a new state reformatory for juvenile delinquents. McCray began laying out plans for a grander state highway system to better accommodate the automobiles which were becoming commonplace. Among the roads he approved creation of was the Lincoln Highway. To fund the road projects, the state introduced its first gasoline tax. =Ku Klux Klan= The Indiana Ku Klux Klan had been rising in power over the past decade in Indiana. Although it was unknown to McCray at the time, over half the members of the Indiana General Assembly were klansmen. Several members of the administration were also klansmen including Indiana Secretary of State Edward L. Jackson. In 1921, the General Assembly passed a bill to approve a \\"Klan Day\\" at the state fair, complete with cross-burnings and other Klan trappings. McCray promptly vetoed the bill, angering Klan leaders.Gugin, p. 265. The Klan gained even more influence in the government in the following year, and Edward Jackson granted the Klan a state charter and officially recognized their organization. McCray was angry with Jackson over the action, and demanded it be rescinded and threatened to take the measure to court, claiming that no organization could receive a charter unless its leaders would reveal themselves and sign the charter. Grand Dragon D.C. Stephenson ordered Jackson to offer McCray a bribe to change his mind. Jackson offered McCray US$10,000 if he would fill several public offices with Klan members. McCray, a millionaire, declined the bribe and was offended. The dealing was behind the scenes and not made public.Gugin, p. 278. =Loan scandal= Land values in Indiana collapsed during the early 1920s and severely hurt McCray's financial position because of his large involvement in land speculation. Although he owned nearly $3 million in assets, he was faced with bankruptcy, but was disturbed at the thought of losing his beloved farm. He took a loan from the State Agricultural Board for $155,000 and deposited into his personal account to cover his debts. He then began soliciting loans from banks by creating fake promissory notes and using them as collateral. Bank officials later claimed that they were coerced by the governor, who hinted that he would remove state deposits if they did not grant him the loans. Klan members soon found out about McCray's dealings and decided to use the situation to force him out of office. The Indiana Attorney General brought McCray up on charges of embezzlement regarding the loan he took from the agricultural board. By then, however, he had already repaid the loan to the board with the help of several friends. The case ended in a hung jury on April 11, 1924. On April 21, he was brought up on mail fraud charges after it was alleged he had mailed the fake promissory notes to several banks. During the trial, he admitted his entire scheme but declared he intended to repay all of the debts and had no criminal intentions. He was soon convicted and sentenced to serve ten years in prison, and he resigned on April 30 and was promptly arrested. The same day, Lieutenant Governor Emmett Forrest Branch was sworn in as governor. A close friend of McCray, he cried while taking the oath of office and later said that everything was so \\"sudden and surprising.\\"Gugin, p. 270 Later life After serving three years in the federal penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia, he was paroled and returned home in 1927. While in prison, the Indiana Klan fell apart as their schemes were revealed by the Grand Dragon after he was convicted of rape and murder. McCray resumed his business, which had recovered and repaid his loans though he remained reclusive in his home. When Republican party leaders informed USPresident Herbert Hoover in 1930 of the Klan's role in McCray's conviction, he received a presidential pardon. McCray remained on his farm where he died on December 19, 1938. He was buried in Fairlawn Cemetery in Kentland, Indiana.Gugin, p. 266.

McCray, who had resigned from office after being convicted for mail fraud. Branch's brief term focused on continuing the reforms and projects of his predecessor. Early life Branch was born in Martinsville the oldest of his four siblings Olive Branch, Leafy Branch, and Frank Oaks Branch. His parents were Elliot and Alice Parks Branch. His father was a Republican politician who had served in state government for several decades. His grandfather and great-grandfather had also been involved in state politics and served as state senators. He attended Indiana University and graduated in 1896, where he played on the school's championship-winning baseball team. He would be the first IU graduate to become governor. After college, he studied law with his uncle Judge M.H. Parks. He was admitted to the bar in 1899 and established a law practice in Martinsville.Gugin, p. 268 During the Spanish–American War, he enlisted in Company K of the 158th Regiment eventually rising to the rank of First Lieutenant. After the war he entered politics and was elected to the Indiana House of Representatives, serving three terms from 1903 to 1909. During World War I, he returned to the army as a lieutenant colonel of the 151st Infantry. He later commanded the 165th Depot Brigade at Camp Travis in Texas and served as part of the forces guarding the Mexican border in 1916 and 1917.Gugin, p. 269 Politics =Legislator= After returning from the army, he opened a law office in Martinsville and married Katherine Bain, the daughter of a prominent newspaper owner. The couple had one son. In 1902, he was elected to the Indiana House of Representatives and served for three terms. He was elected Speaker of the House in 1907 and 1908. While Speaker, he ended the omnibus practice that allowed multiple bills to be combined and passed without debate.Gugin, p. 270 In 1910, he returned to his law practice where he remained until nominated to run for Lieutenant Governor in 1920 and won the election. As President of the Senate, he took part in debate and supported several controversial measures including banning gambling and liquor sales on Memorial Day. When legislation to ban teaching the German language in public was introduced, the Senate edged on violence and order was restored only after Branch beat his gavel so hard on the podium that he broke both the podium and the gavel, causing the chamber to burst into laughter. =Governor= Governor Warren T. McCray had been having a behind the scenes battle with the Indiana Ku Klux Klan and became involved in questionable loan transactions, which the Klan exposed as a scandal to force him out of office.

He oversaw the completion of the Riley Hospital for Children. A month after taking office, a boxing match was held in Michigan City. Prize fighting was illegal in Indiana, and protesters demanded that for the governor to shut down the match. Branch secretly ordered the militia mobilized and put on standby, and sent a general to attend the match to see if he could detect any gambling going on. The general reported that nothing of note happened, and the match was held without incident.Gugin, p. 271 Later life After his term as governor ended, he retired to Martinsville, where he practiced law and managed his business interests as President of the Branch Grain and Seed Company and a major stockholder in the Martinsville Trust Company.

He is the only Indiana governor elected to two non-consecutive terms, and the only governor between 1852 and 1977 to be elected to more than one term in office. His terms were marked by strong opposition party control of the Indiana General Assembly, which attempted to remove powers from the governor that had been granted during the Great Depression. Schricker fought the attempt in the state courts, and although his power was significantly reduced, the Indiana Supreme Court ruled in the case of Tucker v. Indiana that the governor was the chief executive of the state, and the legislature could not pass legislation that interfered with the division of powers. Family and background He was born in North Judson, Indiana, on August 30, 1883, to Bavarian immigrants Fredrick and Magdelena Gray Schricker. Schricker attended a Lutheran parochial school in North Judson to elementary school and attended a public school and completed grade eight. After graduation, he began working in his family's grocery store as a bookkeeper. His parents sent him to a local college to take a course in bookkeeping as the final step in his education. After working in the grocery store for nine years, Schricker decided to become a lawyer and worked toward that goal by taking a position in the Starke County clerk's office in Knox, Indiana.Gugin, p. 299 After a year of studying law on the side, he passed the bar examination and began practicing law in Knox with his mentor, Adrian Courtright. He became the cashier of the Hamlet bank in 1907.and became the owner, publisher, and editor of the Starke County Democrat in 1908. He was actively involved in the community, organizing the first Boy Scout troop in Starke County in 1912 and presiding as the chief of the Knox Fire Department. It was also during this time that Henry met Maude Brown, a teacher in North Dakota, who had originally come from Knox. In 1914, Henry visited her and persuaded her to return to Knox, resulting in their marriage on October 21, 1914. In 1919, he returned to his previous career, and became the cashier of the First National Bank of Knox. Legislator Schricker's first entry into politics was his run for the Indiana Senate in 1924 as a Democrat. After losing the race, he retained his cashier position and continued there until 1932, when he again ran and won. During his term in the Indiana Senate, he drafted legislation to create a new circuit court district for Starke County. Another important bill he created was one to create a tenure system for state teachers, which guaranteed the teachers they would remain employed by the state upon completing a certain number of years in state service. A third bill created a pension fund for firemen in the state. All three bills were passed and signed into law.Gugin, p. 300 Lieutenant governor He was nominated to run again for re-election to the senate in 1936, but turned down the nomination after Governor Paul V. McNutt arranged for the convention to nominate him to run for Lieutenant Governor of Indiana, on a ticket with M. Clifford Townsend. McNutt was considered to be significantly more conservative than Townsend, and party leaders believed Schricker would help draw more Republican votes. Townsend and Schricker won the election and took office in January 1937.Gugin, p. 301 As President of the Democratic-controlled Senate, Schricker helped pass welfare measures supported by Townsend. As lieutenant governor, he was also head of the state's agricultural department and spent considerable time traveling around the state for meetings with leaders of farming communities. The state party was in the midst of a dispute during his term, with the McNutt and Frederick Van Nuys faction opposing President Franklin D. Roosevelt's plan to stack the US Supreme Court. Roosevelt intervened in the state party affairs, and with the support of Townsend, he attempted to remove the state's senators, who were blocking his plan. Schricker did not takes sides in the debate, which McNutt ultimately won, but tried to avoid the Capitol. His traveling effectively turned into a four-year campaign for the governorship as he gained support around the state. At the 1940 state Democratic Party Convention, Schricker won the nomination for governor on the second ballot, winning the majority of the delegates from the rural parts of the state. Opinion had turned strongly against the Democrats in the last year, primarily over welfare spending. To win the election, Schricker focused on his personal popularity rather than his connection to the party. He won the election by less than 4,000 votes and was the only Democrat elected in any statewide election. Republicans swept to power and took strong majorities in the General Assembly for the first time in 15 years. Part of the Republican platform had been to remove the state from the federal welfare system, revoke the massive increase in power granted to the governor by the Executive Reorganization Act, and cut spending and taxes.Gugin, p. 302 Governor =First term= As Schricker took office in January 1941, the battle with the General Assembly was inevitable. Once convened they immediately repealed the Executive Reorganization Act, stripping the governor of his direct authority over numerous government agencies and his authority to appoint officials, which reverted to the Assembly. Schricker openly supported the repeal of the act, stating he had no desire for \\"dictatorial powers.\\"Gugin, p. 303 However, when the bill arrived to be signed into law, he vetoed it claiming that as it was written it would reduce his status to that of an \\"errand boy.\\" Only a simple majority was required to override his veto, which the Assembly promptly did. Republicans soon continued their attempt limit the governor's power and passed the State Administration Act of 1941. The bill reorganized the state into five administrative departments, with only the smallest, which consisted of the governor's aides, remaining under the direct authority of the governor. The other four agencies were to be placed under the control of three-member boards of commissioners. The boards would consist of the governor and two commissioners appointed by the Assembly. The arrangement would effectively give the Assembly the ability to manage the departments. Schricker vetoed the bill when it reached his desk, but his veto was again overridden. When the Assembly adjourned in April, Schricker filed a suit in the state courts, claiming the bill violated the division of powers. The Marion County Circuit Court stayed the law until the matter could be reviewed by the Indiana Supreme Court. Indiana Secretary of State James M. Tucker, a Republican, filed a countersuit claiming the state courts had no authority to stay an act of the legislature, and accusing the court of violating the division of powers. Tucker v. State came before the Supreme Court, which ruled that the governor was the chief executive of the state, and the legislature could not pass legislation that infringed upon that power. It declared, 4-1, the State Administration Act to be unconstititional, on party lines.Gugin, p. 304 Schricker refused to call a special session of the General Assembly. The legislature was unable to reconvene until 1943, when it promptly passed a bill to reform the patronage system and transferred most of the state's agencies to the merit system already employed in some agencies. It also took over the Two Percent Fund, which required all state employees to contribute two percent of their income to a fund that supported the Democratic Party. By creating a board to oversee the fund, they guaranteed that it would be split equally between both parties. Schricker vetoed the bill, but the legislature again overrode it. In 1944, Schricker was mentioned as a candidate for vice president; Indiana Democrats were opposed to the renomination of incumbent Henry A. Wallace, and suggested that because he was from a midwestern state that often supported Republicans, the selection of Schricker could effectively counter the Republican vice presidential selection, Ohio Governor John W. Bricker. Despite the mentions in the press, Shricker made no effort to run for vice president; at the Democratic National Convention, the Indiana delegation, led by Schricker, attempted unsuccessfully to generate support for Paul V. McNutt or Sherman Minton as an alternative to Wallace or the favorite to succeed him, Harry S. Truman. When support for McNutt or Minton failed to materialize, the Indiana delegation supported Truman. Prevented by law from running for reelection to a consecutive term as governor, Schricker was nominated to run for the United States Senate. The race was hard-fought, but Schricker was defeated by incumbent Homer E. Capehart by 1.3% of the vote. =Second term= Schricker returned to private life by joining the American Fletcher National Bank and Trust Company of Indianapolis. However, he ran for the governorship again in 1948 and won, becoming Indiana's first governor to be elected to two non-consecutive terms, and the second to serve non-consecutive terms. During the Kentucky Derby weekend in 1949, Schricker authorized a crackdown on illegal gambling in Orange County, Indiana, near the French Lick Springs Hotel. Democrats held a small majority in the General Assembly during Schricker's first two years in office, but in the midterms, Republicans again took power. They passed legislation to make public the names of welfare recipients and the amounts received. This was in violation of federal welfare laws, and would have resulted in a loss of federal funding for the state welfare system. Schricker vetoed the bill, but the legislature overrode his veto. The federal government immediately cut off funding, creating an $18 million budget deficit for the state. Schricker called a special session of the legislature to resolve the financial situation, but no solution could be agreed upon. Instead the legislators passed a bill that delayed the opening of the public welfare records by two years. Meanwhile, Senator William E. Jenner successfully introduced legislation at the federal level to prevent the state from losing its funding once the bill took effect.Gugin, p. 305 Schricker left office with the state having a $115 million surplus fund due to frugal spending and his own support of the spending plans. The state's highway system, public schools, and prisons suffered during the years because of their neglect. After leaving office, Schricker cofounded the Wabash Fire and Casualty Insurance Company of Indianapolis. Later years Schricker was a popular Hoosier politician known for his charm of a small-town boy and his signature white hat. He was in demand as a speaker, and his advice and sanction were sought by Democratic candidates. He received national recognition when he was chosen to deliver the joint nomination speech for Adlai Stevenson at the Democratic National Convention in 1952. The same year, Schricker again Senate and again lost to the Republican incumbent, Jenner, by 5.6%. He retired to Knox in 1960 but remained active in civic affairs and played a role as himself in the 1950 movie Johnny Holiday.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/79841/Johnny-Holiday/ He died on December 28, 1966.Gugin, p. 306 See also *List of governors of Indiana References Notes Bibliography * External links *Indiana Historical Bureau: Biography and portrait *Political Graveyard * Henry Schricker at FindAGrave 1883 births 1966 deaths Burials at Crown Hill Cemetery Indiana Democrats Governors of Indiana Lieutenant Governors of Indiana Indiana state senators People from Starke County, Indiana American Lutherans American people of German descent Indiana lawyers Democratic Party state governors of the United States 20th-century American politicians Recipients of the Silver Buffalo Award ","title":"Henry F.

A lawyer and veteran of World War I, he is credited with returning his party to power after the Ku Klux Klan scandal in late 1920s that led to years of Democratic dominance of the state government during the Great Depression. His term in office focused primarily on encouraging economic growth as World War II ended through the improvement of the state highway system, education reform, and offering incentives for industrial growth. After leaving office he remained active as a leader in the state Republican Party until his death. Early life =Family and background= Ralph Gates was born in Columbia City, Indiana, on February 24, 1893, the first son of Benton E. and Alice Fesler Gates. Gates had three younger brothers; John, Scott, and Benton. His father was a local banker, an attorney, and chaired the county Republican Party for ten years. To earn an income as a boy, Gates delivered newspapers and became acquainted with Thomas R. Marshall, who later became Vice President of the United States. Gates attended public school in Columbia City and graduated from high school in 1911. He attended the University of Michigan where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1915 and law degree in 1917.Gugin, p. 316 After the United States entered World War I, Gates enlisted in the United States Navy in September 1917. He was mustered in as an ensign and assigned to the Pay Corps, which was responsible to managing the payroll of the navy. In December he was promoted to lieutenant and transferred overseas to work in the War Risk Insurance Bureau based in Ireland where he was employed to sell bonds to insure government war assets. He personally sold over $1 million in bonds, almost entirely to naval personal. In April 1919 he was transferred to France where he was placed in command of an airbase that was being constructed. The base was finished just as the war ended and Gates was offered a position in the Belgian relief effort, but he turned down the offer so he could go home. =Early political career= After he returned to Indiana, he began practicing law in his father's firm. He soon met Helene Edwards of South Whitley, a local school teacher in Muncie. The couple was married on October 30, 1919 and purchased a home in Columbia City where they lived the rest of their lives. They had two children, Robert and Patricia. Gates' father soon brought him into the family banking business where he served as a manager in the Farmer's Loan and Trust Bank. Gates first became involved in politics in 1920 when he became the attorney for Whitley County. He became the town attorney for South Whitley in 1922, a position he held until 1944. He also served as attorney for Columbia City from 1927 through 1929. The Ku Klux Klan dominated the state government during the 1920s and Gates, thanks to his father's advice, was among the few office holders in his region who did not become involved with the secret organization. The Klan was exposed in a scandal in 1927 that led to a near collapse of the state Republican Party.Gugin, p. 317 With the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, the family bank entered a period of financial difficulty. Gates and his brothers were able to successfully meet with each of the banks depositors and convince them to sign non-withdrawal pledges. Thanks to their cooperation, the family was able to preserve the bank and made it one of the few in the region to avoid a bank run. In 1928 he succeeded his father as the chairman of the Whitley County Republican Party and served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention. In 1931 Gates became the Indiana commander of the American Legion. The position led him to travel around the state and meet with many state leaders as he lobbied for veterans. Gates continued to grow in popularity and power among the state party. He served again as a delegate to the national conventions in 1936 and in 1940. In 1941 he became the chairman of the state Republican Party where he immediately set to work to strengthen it and return it to power. He was known as a \\"master politician\\" and soon began to cull from the party leadership the last vestiges of the old progressive movement and those willing to compromise with the Democrats. He personally oversaw the reorganization of each county party in the state on the model of the Whitely County party.Gugin, p. 318 Governor =Campaign= In 1944 Gates used his influence to secure a unanimous nomination at the state convention to run for Governor of Indiana. At the same convention, by Gates' design, Homer E. Capehart and William E. Jenner were nominated to run for the U.S. House of Representatives and the United States Senate respectively. The three men were deeply conservative, but Jenners was the most \\"rigidly ideological\\" of the three, leading to growing differences between him and Gates. Jenners gave the keynote address at the convention which set the tone for the campaign. He attacked President Franklin Roosevelt and the national Democratic Party for their failures during the Great Depression and their domination of both the state and federal government, but urged the party to support the ongoing World War II war effort. Gates supported Jenners' position, and in his speech attacked the state Democratic Party, calling them puppets of the Roosevelt administration claiming they took their orders from Washington and not citizens of Indiana. After the convention Gates returned home where a parade had been organized in his honor in Columbia City. He launched his campaign after the parade and began traveling around the state to stump. He spent considerable time in traditionally Democratic southern Indiana in hopes that he could win over their support. In all of his speeches he used the term \\"a local problem can best be solved by local government.\\" He also continued to charge that leadership of the state had been abandoned to federal government and that Republicans could remedy the situation. Gates and his Democratic opponent, Samuel D. Jackson, did not hold any debates or travel to make joint appearances. The Republican party platform paid off and Gates defeated Jackson by more than 46,000 votes. Republicans also took a large two-thirds majorities in both houses of the Indiana General Assembly.Gugin, p. 319 =Promoting economic growth= The Indiana World War Memorial, made available by Gates as a new headquarters for the American Legion. In Gates inaugural address he called on each branch of the government to do its job and not to interfere with the other branches. He promised not to abuse the executive authority, and the speech successfully ended what had become a fifteen-year battle between the legislature, the governor, and the Indiana Supreme Court over who held the final power to control the state bureaucracy. Gates announced he would focus on three main areas while he served as governor; industrial growth, highway construction, and improved health care. He also urged the legislature to reform state taxes and spending and predicted a fall in tax revenues as the war ended. Gates became friends with Josiah K. Lilly, Jr. the President of Eli Lilly and Company. Lilly advised Gates on a number of health care reforms and successfully lobbied Gates to support the construction of three new state-run mental hospital for the insane. The departments of revenue, veterans affairs, and commerce were all created at Gates urging during his term. He also successfully advocated the creation of Shades State Park. Teacher's wages were raised statewide, the Bureau of Motor Vehicles was reorganized to hire employees using the state merit system, and a retirement fund for state employees was started. To fund the new initiatives, excise taxes were raised on beer, liquor, and cigarettes. Using his connections in the American Legion, Gates was instrumental in influencing the organization to move its national headquarters from Washington D.C. to Indianapolis and providing it office space in the World War Memorial building which was expanded to accommodate them.Gugin, p. 320 Gates' position on highway construction came to be at odds with the more conservative wing of the party. The federal government offered matching funds to the state to build certain highways, but they feared taking the money would be seen as a sign of going back on their promise to not let the federal government influence them. Gates insisted that it was in the best interest of the state to accept the money and build the highways, but legislature failed to act on his recommendation. Jenners had been behind the movement to stop the highway construction bill, and Gates retaliated by planning to block Jenners from winning the nomination to run for governor in 1948. The Constitution of Indiana prevented governors from serving consecutive terms, barring Gates from running for office again. However, he still controlled the state party and at the state convention in 1948, he was able to unite the three factions opposing Jenners to deny him the nomination. Jenners, who had a two-hundred vote lead in the first ballot, was outraged and never forgave Gates. Later life =Party leader= When Gates left office he resumed his duties as chairman of the state party, and also served at different times in the national party as a member of the Republican National Committee. He met with Robert A. Taft in 1952 and was offered the chance to run for Vice President of the United States, but he declined. The same year party leaders tried to nominate him to run for governor again, but he refused. Although he never ran for office again, his support and backing proved critical to Republicans for many years in gaining party nominations. Richard Lugar was among the last men he helped secure the party's Senate nomination for. He continued offering political advice until 1976 when told a reporter that the national party made a mistake in choosing Gerald Ford over Ronald Reagan for the 1976 president nomination, and that Jimmy Carter was \\"well intentioned, but had no grasp of politics.\\"Gugin, p. 321 =Death and legacy= Gates and his wife remained living in their Columbia City home, the same he had purchased in 1919. They also purchased a cottage on Crooked Lake just outside the town where they spent considerable time in the summer. He became an American Civil War enthusiast and collected a large number of books on the subject. After retiring from his law practice he also spent considerable time gardening. He died of natural causes on July 28, 1978. Only a private service was held after his death because of his request for only a simple ceremony where his favorite song, \\"Onward Christian Soldiers\\" was played. Indiana State Road 205, which runs from Garrett, through Churubusco and Columbia City, before ending in South Whitley, is called the Ralph F. Gates Memorial Highway. As a governor, Gates was responsible for helping the state to successfully transition from a war to peace time economy. He is best remembered as an important Republican Party leader, who rebuilt the party following its near collapse after the KKK scandal in the late 1920s, and his continued role in the party after his time as governor. The Ralph F. Gates Nature Preserve at Crooked Lake near the Whitley - Noble county line was given to ACRES Land Trust, Inc. in 1977 by Phil and Patricia McNagny. A public dedication of an Indiana state historical marker commemorating Governor Ralph Fesler Gates was held on July 2, 2013 at 1:15 PM on the Whitley County Courhouse north lawn in Columbia City, Indiana.

A lawyer and veteran of World War II who was promoted to serve in a division command staff, Craig first gained popularity in the state as National Commander of The American Legion. He was a political outsider when he ran for governor and was at odds with more conservative party leadership during his time in office. Although he made significant reforms, his term ended with a high profile bribery scandal when it was found that several high level state employees had been accepting bribes to influence their decision in assigning construction contracts. Craig was personally uninvolved in the scandal but was held responsible for it by the public, ending his political career. At odds with party leaders, and angered by the bribery scandal, he left the state after his term and moved to Virginia where he opened a law office and later became president of an automotive company. After a decade he returned to Indiana where he retired from public life, but resumed activity in the Republican Party as a political adviser until his death in 1992.  Early life  George Craig was born August 6, 1909, in Brazil, Indiana, the son of attorney Bernard C. and Clo Branson Craig. He attended local public schools and graduated from Brazil High School in 1927. He enrolled the University of Arizona in the same year and continued there until 1929 where he was a member of the Delta Chi fraternity. He later admitted that he spent little time studying and joined Kappa Beta Phi, a school forbidden drinking fraternity. He left the school before graduating and decided to become a lawyer. He enrolled in Indiana University School of Law in 1930, but was required to meet with the school dean, Paul V. McNutt, to explain his poor grades in Arizona. After promising to apply himself he was accepted into the school.Gugin, p. 322 Among Craig's classmates was William E. Jenner, who would later become his primary opponent within the Republican Party. The two often argued over politics while in school together. In 1931 Craig married his classmate Kathryn Louisa Heiliger. After graduating with a law degree in 1932, the couple returned to Clay County where they had two children, Margery and John, and Craig began practicing law in his father's firm. As the Great Depression set in, demand for lawyers dropped and Craig had only a few cases a year. He began to become involved in local politics and became the chairman of the county Republican Party in 1938. The following year he became the town of Brazil's attorney. In 1940 he was able to have himself named a candidate for lieutenant governor at the state convention, but was defeated in the vote.Gugin, p. 324  World War II  As the United States entered World War II, Craig decided to enlist in the army. He was mustered in as a first lieutenant in the 18th Infantry Division that was training in Camp Bedford Forrest in Tullahoma, Tennessee. He remained with the division for the remainder of the war. His division was soon dispatched to Great Britain where they participated in the Invasion of Normandy. After commanding a platoon in storming the beach, he was promoted to command a company, and later a battalion in the subsequent liberation of France. After the war he earned a Bronze Star Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster and the Croix de Guerre for his service. As the army began invading Germany, he was promoted to the regimental command staff and then the divisional command staff. There he became acquainted with Supreme Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhower who often visited the division level commanders. His friendship with Eisenhower later played an important role in influencing his position on political issues. After the war in Europe ended, Craig was discharged in 1946 with a final rank of lieutenant colonel.Gugin, p. 234  The American Legion  Craig returned home and resumed his father's law practice which he eventually took over. By the end of 1947 he became involved in The American Legion as the Clay County commander. He quickly rose in the organizations rank, becoming the vice-commander for the state of Indiana, a national committeeman, and in 1949 he was nominated commander of the national organization. The Legion headquarters were in Indianapolis and the group had significant political influence in the state. Command of the organization had been a stepping stone to the governorship for previous men, but Craig denied that he had such ambitions after being elected to the position. He began to travel national and around the state and became acquainted with many national and international dignitaries and high office holders. The Legion's \\"Tide for Toys\\" campaign which was intended to distribute toys to foreign children, was started during his term. He continued his friendship with Eisenhower during his tenure and influenced the organization to support the anti-communist agenda as the Cold War set in. He personally delivered a number of anti-communist speeches. After 14 months as commander he returned to his law firm, which he moved to Indianapolis in December 1950.  Governor of Indiana = Political campaign = Publicly, Craig announced he intended to leave public life and work as a lawyer for the rest of his career. Secretly, however, he began making arrangement to run for the governorship of Indiana. He was an outsider to the Republican Party leadership, and owed his rise in The American Legion largely to patronage from Democrats. Craig was considerably less conservative than the party leadership, of whom William Jenner was chief, and knew that any attempt to run would be opposed by them. Knowing that most state convention delegates were reelected to each convention, he launched an unprecedented campaign, by personally meeting with hundreds of potential convention delegates before the May election in 1951. He was able to gain enough support to ensure he would be a contender at the convention, and then announced his intention to run. Jenner and the party chairman attempted to unite support in favor of one of the other five more conservative candidates, but after three rounds of balloting Craig won the nomination. He later credited the popularity of The American Legion for his victory. Harold W. Handley, of the opposing faction, was nominated to run for lieutenant governor.Gugin, p. 325 The national Republican Party was at that time going through a period of internal problems over their position on communism, and the best way to deal with the threat--both internally and externally. Craig brought the national party's problem to the state. Jenner and the party leadership supported faction of the party was virulently anti- communist, but Craig openly sided with Eisenhower and the wing of the party advocating a more measured response to the problem. Jenner was incensed not only by Craig's position on communism, but also on his campaign platform that advocated significant increased state spending and the start of a number of new programs. The difference between Craig and the party continued throughout his time in office. Craig's Democratic opponent was incumbent lieutenant governor John Watkins. Thanks in large part to Eisenhower's popularity, Craig won a landslide victory in the election.Gugin, p. 326 = Reform agenda = His agenda was largely reform-oriented and included enhancing worker's compensation and unemployment benefits, building new schools, raising teacher's salaries, building a new state prison, constructing new hospitals, and improving traffic safety. Following his inauguration in January 1953, he submitted twenty-six proposals to the Indiana General Assembly that encompassed all of his agenda. His most controversial with the legislation was a proposal to reorganize the states 141 agencies into eleven departments centralized under the governor's control. The Republican legislature dismissed the request out of hand and accused him of trying to restart the battle over executive power that had been ongoing in the past three decades, but had largely been avoided by the previous two governors. Most of Craig's agenda was never implemented as the legislature accused him of not working with them, but in large part it was his differences with party leaders that caused the problems. A Democratic senator observed that it was as if there were three parties in the assembly--the pro-Craig, the anti-Craig, and the Democratic parties. Craig was successful in having the Department of Corrections created, which he used to implement most of his penal reform. The Uniform Traffic Code was also established, which standardized road signs, speed limits, and traffic rules across the state. Funding was also granted to improve safety by installing signage and signal lights around the state. The police academy was expanded and the first narcotics group. The state police force was expanded to add fifty new officers, making it the largest in the nation at the time. The state's Mental Health Division was also established to reform the state's mental hospitals.Gugin, p. 327 Craig wrangled with the legislature over the creation of major highways around Indiana. The assembly didn't want to pay for the roads, so Craig recommended a toll road be created. The assembly leadership balked at the idea, as toll roads had been abolished decades earlier. The assembly finally authorized the Indiana Toll Road in northern Indiana, but refused to build anymore, primarily because they didn't want to allow the governor control over a large number of patronage positions which he could potentially use to gain more power in the party. His other construction recommendations, a state office building, new prisons, and the expansion of Purdue University were ignored by the assembly. They also refused what he believed his most economically valuable proposal, creating a shipping harbor on Lake Michigan. The state's $22 million budget surplus disappeared during Craig's term, in large part though due to the Korean War bonus paid out to soldiers to enlist that the assembly authorized over Craig's veto. Craig was quoted as saying, \\"you can't put a bonus on patriotism any more than you can on motherhood.\\" The bonus cost the state $7.6 million. The rest of the surplus was spent on school consolidation as one room schoolhouses were phased out and students bused to larger centralized facilities. = Bribery scandal = Craig was featured on the cover of Time magazine in 1955, where his reforms in the state were touted as a national example. Eisenhower praised Craig as a leader, and urged the party leaders to help him transition to a federal office. Eisenhower offered to make him Secretary of the Army in 1955, but Craig declined saying he wished to finish his term as governor. In later years, he also said his refusal was in part due to his personal dislike of Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson.Gugin, p. 328 Despite his popularity, he continued to remain at odds with the state party leadership. During the final session of the General Assembly he recommended that the death penalty be abolished. The request was not considered by the body, and Jenner used it as proof that Craig had abandoned his conservative principles. Near the end of Craig's term in 1956 a scandal was discovered that implicated three highway commissioners in accepting bribes to influence their decision on accepting construction contracts. Lieutenant Governor Harold Handley used the situation to attack Craig, and accused him of being responsible for the scandal. Craig himself was not found to be personally involved in the plot, but was required to testify before a grand jury in 1957, after he left office. When he left the court building, he gave an interview to the press in which he attacked William Jenner and a number of other party leaders for having a political vendetta against him. The scandal and his interview were published around the state and significantly hurt his popularity. In his later years he said that he forgave Jenner for his actions while Craig was governor, and that the two never agreed on anything except the weather.  Death and legacy  In December 1957 Craig and his family left Indiana, largely because of his disgust with the state Republican Party, and moved to Virginia where he opened a law office and later became president of an automotive company. In 1965 he moved again to Los Angeles and continued practicing law. Finally in 1967, he returned home again to Brazil, Indiana and retired. He resumed some activity in the Republican Party as a political adviser, but never made any significant public appearances. He continued practicing law until 1976, and was made a member of the State Board of Law Examiners that year and remained on the board for a decade. He retired in 1986 and lived relatively secluded until his death on December 17, 1992.

A veteran of World War II, and furniture salesman by trade, Handley began his political career as a state senator. Thanks to his longtime friendship with state party leader and United States Senator William E. Jenner, he was able to secure the nomination to run for lieutenant governor in 1952, during which time he opposed many of the actions of Governor George N. Craig. His popularity rose among the conservative leadership of the Indiana Republican Party and aided him in winning the nomination and subsequent election as governor in 1956. He was elected during a period of conservative domination of the state government. He successfully implemented major parts of his party's agenda that affected the state for decades. After raising the gasoline tax 50% to balance the state budget, his opponents branded him \\"High Tax Harold\\", ignoring the fact that he also eliminated state property taxes. He launched an unprecedented mid-term campaign for a United States Senate seat, but ended in defeat and he finished his term as governor. He personally advocated mental health reform in Indiana and after leaving office he remained active in several charities that helped the mentally disabled, winning a Drummer Boy Award in 1970. He operated a successful public relations business in Indianapolis for several years and in 1969 served on the Constitutional Revision Committee that authored a set of major amendments to the state constitution.

His father was a merchant who sold furniture. He attend local public schools before enrolling in Indiana University. His classmates included William E. Jenner and George N. Craig. Handley became good friends with Jenner; the two later became important political allies. Craig however, would become Handley's major opponent within his own party. He studied at the school for four years and graduated in 1932 with a bachelor's degree in economics.Gugin, p. 330 After school Handley returned home where he joined his father's sales department. Although Handley was an able salesman, his company was one of many that folded during the mid-1930s because of the continuing Great Depression. Handley took a new job as a salesman at Unagusta Furniture Corporation, a North Carolina furniture company, but in turn folded in less than a year after he joined it. It was during his period of unemployment that he began to become involved in politics. He formed the Young Republicans of LaPorte County in 1935 and in 1936 he made an unsuccessful run for the Indiana Senate. He remained active in the party and ran for the senate again in 1940 and was elected along with a strong Republican majority to both houses of the body. In the first session of the Indiana General Assembly of his term, he supported the Republican position of repealing almost a decade of Democratic legislation, and reorganizing the executive branch of the government to decentralize control away from the governor.Gugin, p. 331 =World War II= After the United States entered World War II in 1941, Handley resigned from the senate and enlisted in the army as a lieutenant, but eventually rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was assigned to the Eighty-eighth Infantry Division headquartered in Mojave desert. Despite making multiple requests to be sent overseas, the army kept him in the United States for the duration of the war to serve as a trainer for new recruits. As fresh soldiers arrived in the camp he was responsible for overseeing the drill sergeants and ensuring they were properly trained before they were dispatched to serve as reinforcements to the main body of the division. During his time in the army he met Barbara Jean Winterble, a psychiatric nurse working at a Red Cross post near his base. The two were married on February 17, 1944 and they moved back to LaPorte after Handley was discharged from the army in 1946. He took a new job in furniture sales and a second job in sales a small movie production company. He soon had two children, Kenneth and Martha Jean. =Legislator= Handley returned to politics in 1948 after winning election to his former senate seat. It was still a period of Republican domination in the state, and he quickly rekindled his friendship with then-United States Senator William E. Jenner. In the 1952 state convention, George N. Craig, a dark horse candidate, won the nomination to the consternation of the party leadership. Jenner and others had hoped to have a more conservative nominee for governor. They successfully maneuvered Handley as their candidate to win the nomination to run for lieutenant governor. Party tickets were not run at that time, and Handley ran a separate campaign for office, advocating a significantly different platform than Craig, who was calling for many progressive reforms. Thanks in part to the popularity of Dwight Eisenhower, Handley won a landslide victory and defeated his Democratic opponent E. Spencer Dalton by 230,420 votes.Gugin, p. 332 In his role as President of the Senate, Handley became an early opponent of Governor Craig. Craig submitted a plan to reorganize the state's 141 agencies into eleven departments centralized under his leadership, a reversal of the reorganization Handley supported during his first term as a senator. Handley was able to kill all debate on the bill in the Senate and prevent it from passing. The short legislative sessions allowed Handley to focus most of his attention on his statutory offices, serving as the Commissioner of Agriculture and Commissioner of Commerce. He successfully attracted a number of companies to expand and move operations to Indiana, providing thousands of new jobs. He also used his position to build a considerable political base of support. A scandal in the state highway department was discovered just before the 1956 state Republican Party convention. It was found that three governor-appointed commissioners had accepted bribes to influence their decision in assigning construction contracts. Handley publicly blasted Governor Craig and blamed him for the scandal. Craig had been in a constant battle with the Republican leadership during his term, and they had largely prevented him from gaining control of any of the state's patronage system. Craig later accused Handley, Jenner, and others of purposely attempting to derail his reform agenda and using the bribery scandal, in which Craig was found to be uninvolved in, to tarnish his reputation to end his political career. Governor =Campaign= At the state convention, Handley ran for the nomination to run for governor with the backing of Senator Jenner. Although Craig tried to block his nomination, Handley was able to overcome his opposition and win the nomination. In the general election his opponent was Democrat Ralph Tucker. The central election issues was the bribery scandal, the impending state budget deficit, and reform of the state health institutions. Handley also repudiated past governors who had taken federal grant money for selling out control of the state to the federal government. He said \\"Hoosiers refuse to stand in line in front of the treasury in Washington with tin cups in their hands,\\" and that depending on the federal government for revenue would lead to the ruin of the state. President Eisenhower was running for re-election in the same year, and again thanks in part to his popularity, Handley won a second landslide victory, defeating Tucker by 227,475 votes. =Agenda= Handley had not advocated any significant agenda items during his term, but rather focused on advocating his principles. His party controlled both houses of the Indiana General Assembly, and for the first time in fifty years, they were able to use their power implement a major Republican agenda. Because of his good relations with the Assembly, they readily passed a number of items he requested.Gugin, p. 333 The most controversial position Harold took was advocating a 50% increase in the state gasoline tax. The bonuses paid to soldiers, and the state's school consolidation plan had used up the budget surplus in 1956. A deficit was predicted for 1957 and 1958, but the state was not permitted to take on debt by the constitution. Members of his party recommended using some of the state's reserve fund to handle the deficit, but ultimately the tax increase was approved, earning him the nickname \\"High Tax Harold.\\" Handley also successfully advocated the passage of a withholding law that allowed employers to withhold state income taxes from their employee's pay. This led to the discovery of thousands of tax cheats that produced an unexpected windfall for the state government. Hoping to use the situation to restore some confidence in his conservativeness, Handley proposed that most of the state property taxes be repealed. The General Assembly readily agreed and state level property taxes completely repealed, leaving only some local property taxes in place. A number of other important laws were passed in Indiana during Handley's administration. The state's first right-to-work law was put in place, but Handley was reluctant to support it. When he finally did sign the bill, his public image had already been tarnished by his opponents who attacked his lack of vigor in helping the common worker. A bill of major importance that Handley supported was also passed, making Indiana the first state to outlaw union shops, leading to a gradual decline in the influence of labor unions. The Interstate Highway system was also started during Handley's term, using $1 billion in federal grants to begin constitution. Before he left office, over had been completed. Some in his own party saw his support of the highway construction as breaking one of his campaign pledges to not accept federal money and the string that came attached to it. Handley countered that the highway was in the best interest of the state, and that it was the only exception he would make to his position on accepting federal money. A number of delayed construction projects were also started during his term, including the building of the Indiana State Office Building to allow for room to be made in the crowded Indiana Statehouse. Funds were granted to expand Purdue University and a new state mental hospital was built.Gugin, p. 334 =Senate campaign= Senator William Jenner resigned shortly before the mid-term elections in 1958 and urged Handley to seek his seat. A plan was created where Handley would resign the governorship, his lieutenant would appoint him senator, and he could finish the term. When the plan was revealed to the party leadership, they strongly advised him to not implement the it because they feared it would hurt the party and be perceived as a scandal. Handley then decided to have the Secretary of State order an election for the office in November, and Handley himself ran for the position. Handley did not resign from the governorship during his campaign and was widely criticized for the unprecedented action. His Democratic opponent, Vance Hartke, brought up his tax increase, the breaking of his campaign promise, his reluctance on signing the right-to-work bill, and the rising state unemployment. Statewide unemployment was just above 10% in April, but dropped to 6.9% by the end of September. Handley also faced national backlash against the Republican Party in the wake of the recession in late 1957 and early 1958. Despite Handley's claim to have to helped lower unemployment, he lost the election and returned his focus the governorship. Later life The constitution of Indiana prevented governors from serving consecutive terms, making it impossible for Handley to seek re-election. He returned to his private life in his new Indianapolis home after leaving office in January 1961. He had become increasingly interested in helping the mentally retarded during his time as governor and quickly became involved in several charitable groups. In 1970 he won a Drummer Boy Award from the Retarded Children's Association for his work.Gugin, p. 335 Handley started a public relations and advertising firm based in Indianapolis that became very successful. In 1969, a major revision of the state constitution was finally authorized. He and fellow former Governor Matthew E. Welsh were appointed to the Constitutional Revision Commission. Among the important influences he had on the revision was allowing governors to serve consecutive terms again. The state courts were also reorganized, and a level of appointment power was also returned to the governor. In total seven amendments he helped author were drafted and passed into law. Handley traveled to Wyoming for a vacation in 1972. He died in Rawlins on August 30 of a heart attack. His remains were returned to Indiana for a public service, and he was buried at the Pine Lake Cemetery in LaPorte. His memoir and gubernatorial papers were donated to the Indiana State Archives.

This encyclopaedia consists of seven volumes and 2628 pages. In his 12-page introduction, which is incorporated in the first volume, Qasim states his purpose and objectives of compiling such a work. He also mentions the scope or coverage, the criterion of inclusion, arrangement of the various entries and hints on how to use his encyclopaedia. Background Qasim's encyclopaedia had its origins in the mid-1980s when he was collecting material for two of his other contributions, Halfayat al-Muluk, which is a regional biographical dictionary of the Halfaya region north of Khartoum North, and Qamus al-lahja al-'ammiya fi 'l-Sudan, 'A Dictionary of Sudanese Arabic'. Among those who appreciated the value of this indispensable source for Sudanese studies was R.S. O'Fahey, who followed its forms in writing Sudanese personal, tribal and place names. Having revised and published these two works, Qasim's began to plan for a project with a wider scope. His encyclopaedia appeared after more than ten years of active research and preparation. There has been no shortage of studies on tribes, genealogies and noteworthy persons and places names in the Sudan. Much research has been done during the past decades. The results, however, are scattered and often inaccessible. As Heather J. Sharkey points out, Richard Leslie Hill felt this problem a long time ago, when he said in the preface to the second edition of his Biographical dictionary of the Sudan, \\"Little books are born in the Sudan by the dozen, without imprints without date, even without title page. They circulate for a brief season and die without trace.\\"  Scope and coverage of the encyclopaedia  Qasim states in his introduction that his original intention was to mimic his first encyclopaedia in including the major ethnic groups, important place names and noteworthy individuals deceased before the present day. The author, however, felt that bringing together such material and bringing them up to date would make his work more useful. Thus his encyclopaedia covers all of the Sudan and spans ancient and present times.  Arrangement of the encyclopaedia  The author does not follow a thematic or subject classification or arrangement for the entries of the six volumes. He prefers to arrange his entries in Arabic alphabetical order, irrespective of their subject matter. Thus entries on tribes, noteworthy persons and important place names are arranged together. Cross-references are used to lead the reader from names that are familiar to alternate names that may not be. Internal cross-references also appear frequently within entries, where they are identified by the Arabic letter mem to denote 'see' or 'see also'.

It is based on the experiences of BBC news producer David Belton, who worked in Rwanda during the Rwandan genocide. Belton is the film's co-writer and one of its producers. The setting of the film is the École Technique Officielle (ETO) in Kigali, Rwanda, in 1994, during the Rwandan genocide. Hurt plays a Catholic priest (loosely based on Vjekoslav ĆurićSan Francisco Chronicle, Amid genocide in Rwanda, one man stands tall) and Dancy an English teacher, both Europeans, who are caught up in the events of the genocide. Unlike Hotel Rwanda, which was filmed in South Africa using South African actors, the film was shot in the original location of the scenes it portrays. Also, many survivors of the massacre were employed as part of the production crew and minor acting roles. The film's title refers to the actions of UN soldiers in shooting at the stray dogs that scavenged the bodies of the dead. Since the UN soldiers were not allowed to shoot at the Hutu extremists who had caused the deaths in the first place, the shooting of dogs is symbolic of the madness of the situation that the film attempts to capture.

Originally a Democrat, he joined the Republican Party in 1856 after being expelled by the pro-slavery faction of the Democratic Party. Only the second person born in Indiana to become the state's governor, he reluctantly accepted his party's nomination to run. His term saw the start of Indiana's industrialization that continued for several decades. During the second half of his term a strong Democratic majority took control of the Indiana General Assembly and revoked all of the governor's appointment powers and other authorities, weakening the governors position to its lowest state in the history of the state. Early life =Family and background= Albert G. Porter was born on April 20, 1824, in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, the son of Thomas and Myra Tousey Porter. His father, a veteran of the War of 1812, was a bank teller at the Farmer and Mechanic's Bank. Established by the state government in 1818, the bank folded after the Panic of 1819. His father then served several years as a county clerk until the family moved to Boone County, Kentucky, after his mother inherited her father's farm. The large farm neighbored the Ohio River at the area's most convenient crossing point, and Porter began managing his father's ferryboat, crossing wagons and passengers across the river. Using the money he earned from working the ferry, he enrolled in Hanover College in 1839, but soon ran out of money to continue his education. His uncle offered to pay for the remainder of his school, provided that he would switch to a Methodist school. Porter agreed, and attended and graduated from Asbury University (now DePauw University) in 1843. The following year he moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, where he took a job in the state's auditors office and briefly served as a private secretary to Governor of Indiana James Whitcomb. Whitcomb influenced Porter to pursue a career in law, so he began to study law in the office of Philip Spooner. He was admitted to the Indiana bar in 1845 and entered a corporate law practice in Indianapolis headed by Hiram Brown. He met and married Brown's daughter, Minerva, on November 20, 1846. The couple had five children. Porter took a secondary job writing for the Indianapolis Journal, recording Indiana Supreme Court decisions, and gained a good reputation with the court. He served as the city attorney from 1851 until 1853, having run for office as a Democrat. In 1853 he was appointed to a vacant reporter seat for the Supreme Court. He was elected to the position in 1854 by a strong majority and served until 1856. That year, he became embroiled in the ongoing political feud between the pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions of the state Democratic party. The pro-slavery faction won, and Porter was among the anti-slavery men expelled from the party, causing him to join the newly formed Republican Party. With his brother-in-law's help, Porter began to organize the Marion County Republican Party, and ran for the city council on the Republican ticket. He served a partial term in the office but resigned in 1859 after having won the 1858 congressional election. =Congressman= He served in the United States House of Representatives until 1863, having been reelected once. As a congressman during the American Civil War, he supported much of the wartime legislation. His primary contribution was his own investigation of the railroads, which had accepted numerous land grants from the government during the war and the years leading up to it. He calculated the value of the transactions, and balanced it again the amount the railroads were demanding for payment for shipping men and munitions, saving the at time cash-strapped government several million dollars. He was nominated a third time to run for Congress in 1862, but declined primarily because of the position's poor salary and his need to replenish his savings. He returned to Indianapolis where became head of one of the state's leading law firms; his most famous partner was future United States President Benjamin Harrison. He took on several high- profile cases, including the Ex parte Milligan case, which ended before the United States Supreme Court, who ruled that Lambdin P. Milligan, who had been arrested during the war for subversive activities, and tried and convicted by a military tribunal, should be released as the tribunal had no authority to prosecute so long as the civil courts were still in operation. He was nominated as a Republican candidate to run for governor in 1876, but he declined. In 1878, Porter was appointed by President Rutherford B. Hayes as Comptroller of the United States Treasury. As Comptroller he oversaw the settlement of numerous treasury disputes dating back to the Civil War. In 1880, while Porter was still in Washington, his party again nominated him to run for Governor, without his knowledge. By the time he received word, his party was already printing campaign posters and the party leaders were able to convince him to run for the good of the party. He reluctantly accepted, and returned to Indianapolis. Governor =Republican legislature= One of the most notable thing about the campaign was Porter's sudden change in attire. In Washington he was well known for his style and manner of dress, but upon accepting the nomination he began dressing like a farmer, including wearing a straw hat. The campaign was \\"vigorous\\", and Porter traveled to all but five of the state's counties to stump and deliver speeches . Because he had supported the strikers in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, he was able to gain the endorsement of the Knights of Labor, who turned out a large labor vote in his favor. Porter narrowly won the election by about seven thousand votes. He was the first Republican to win the governorship in twelve years, and along with a strong Republican majority elected to the Indiana General Assembly, he began a period of Republican dominance that would continue for a generation. Shortly after his term began, his party nominated him as a candidate for the United States Senate, but he declined. Porter's term focused primarily on the continuing industrial development in the state, and internal improvements. Porter had the Great Kankakee Swamp in northwestern Indiana surveyed and plans drafted for its draining. The swamp was at the time one of the largest wetlands in the United States and encompassed nearly a tenth of Indiana, and a large part of Illinois. The plans were submitted to the General Assembly who approved of the plan, leading the reclamation of more than of land. To implement the project, the governor also advocated the creation of the Department of Geology and Natural History, the forerunner of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Among Porter's other successful projects included the creation of the State Board of Health, the institution of mining regulations that significantly improved working conditions for miners in the state, and advocacy for women's rights. In 1881, he delivered a speech to the General Assembly urging them to grant suffrage to women. Although no action was taken on his advice, it renewed the debate which had seen little advancement since Governor James D. Williams had issued a similar request several years earlier. Porter used his appointment powers to advance the women's cause, appointing women to a variety of positions in state agencies, but primarily to board positions overseeing the state's benevolent institutions, like hospitals and orphanages. He also successfully forced out many of the non-expert members of important state boards, and replaced them with field experts. =Democratic legislature= After several months of debate, the General Assembly finally agreed to a compromise to grant women the right to vote by agreeing to also enact prohibition legislation. They proposed an amendment to the state constitution that would both grant women the right to vote, and enact statewide prohibition. The two issues were to much for the electorate to consider at once, and in the mid-term election of 1882, the amendment was overwhelming defeated, and so were the Republicans as a large Democratic majority came to power. The second half of Porter's term was one of the uncommon times in Indiana's history where the legislature was completely controlled by a party hostile to the governor. Typical to such occasions, the assembly began to reign in the governor whose weak constitutional position made it difficult to resist. One of their first acts was to revoke all of the governor's appointment powers. He vetoed the bill on its first passage, but the assembly quickly overrode it, taking the responsibility for appointing all board members in the state, a power the governor had held since the Civil War. They also began to enact legislation designed to weaken Republican power across the state, first by creating a state board to manage the newly formed Indianapolis metropolitan police department, taking away control from the Republican-controlled city government. Along with other restrictive measures placed on the governor, they weakened the executive office to its lowest point in the history of the state. Nearly fifty years would pass before governors began to regain their former power. The only significant legislation the governor was able to have passed during this time was a bill to fund a relief program following a flood that devastated the Wabash River and Ohio River areas in 1883. At the time the flood was the worst in the state's recorded history, and destroyed and damaged many towns and cities were in significant need of assistance. Consecutive terms being banned by the state constitution, Porter left office in 1884 and returned to his law practice. Final years and legacy Porter's wife had died in 1875, and on January 5, 1881, he remarried to Cornela Stone. The marriage was brief, and she died in 1886. His party attempted to nominate him to run for governor again 1888, but he declined. He did serve as a delegate to the 1888 Republican National Convention where he delivered a speech and nominated his old law partner Benjamin Harrison to run for president. Harrison won the nomination and campaign and appointed Porter as Minister to Italy in 1889. During his time there, he oversaw negotiations with Italy concerning the lynching of eleven Italians in 1891, following a highly publicized murder trial in New Orleans. He resigned in 1892 and returned to Indianapolis where he spent the final years of his life working on a book on the history of Indiana. He never finished the book, which remains unpublished. He suffered a hard fall from which his health never recovered, leading to his death on May 3, 1897, and was buried in Crown Hill Cemetery.

He led a life of extraordinary intrigue after the war. A veterinarian's son, he went to the Reformgymnasium in Kufstein and eventually learnt to be a druggist. NSDAP membership Already by 1923, the then 14-year-old Hartmann Lauterbacher had become a member of the Austria-based NSDAP's youth organization. It is even said that Lauterbacher founded the first ever NSDAP youth local in Austria, in Kufstein. In 1925, when he was 16 years old, Lauterbacher was the leader of the Deutsche Jugend (\\"German Youth\\"), which he transferred to the Hitler Youth in 1927. Hitler Youth leader For professional reasons, Lauterbacher had to move to Braunschweig, where he joined the NSDAP in September 1927. Between 1929 and 1930, he attended the Braunschweig Druggists' Academy. From 1929 to 1932 he led the Hitler Youth of the Gau of South Hanover–Brunswick, as of 1930 as his main job. Between 1932 and 1933, Lauterbacher was appointed leader of the Westphalia-Lower Rhine area, and between 1933 and 1934 he was appointed high area leader of the Hitler Youth West. On 22 May 1934, Baldur von Schirach appointed Lauterbacher his deputy and Stabsführer. In 1936, Lauterbacher was elected as a member of the Reichstag. In April 1937 he was made a Ministerial Councilor to Schirach. Second World War While von Schirach was away performing a short stint in the military, Lauterbacher took over the Hitler Youth's commissary leadership. When he likewise found himself having to spend a few weeks at military service, in the shape of an SS formation, he suffered an accident and was wounded badly enough to make deployment anywhere other than on the homefront quite impossible. However, since a Hitler Youth leader could not show any sign of physical flaw or marring, Lauterbacher had to hand his position over to Artur Axmann, who now became Baldur von Schirach's deputy. Helmut Möckel became Stabsführer. Gauleiter of South Hanover–Brunswick On 8 August 1940, Lauterbacher was appointed Deputy Gauleiter of Gau South Hanover–Brunswick, and on 8 December 1940, as Science and Education Minister Bernhard Rust's successor, he was appointed full- fledged Gauleiter. At the same time he received an appointment as Honorary Leader of the Academy for Youth Leadership in Braunschweig In January 1941, Lauterbacher was appointed to the Prussian State Council. He took over as Oberpräsident of the Prussian Province of Hanover on 1 April 1941 as SA Chief of Staff Viktor Lutze's successor. As Gauleiter and Oberpräsident, he thus united under his control the highest party and governmental offices in the province. At about the same time came his promotion to SS-Gruppenführer. Lauterbacher's last new assignment came in November 1942, when he was appointed Reich Defence Commissioner for his Gau. On 30 January 1944, he was promoted to SS-Obergruppenführer.Michael D. Miller & Andreas Schulz: Gauleiter: The Regional Leaders of the Nazi Party and Their Deputies, 1925-1945, Volume II (Georg Joel - Dr. Bernhard Rust). R. James Bender Publishing, 2017, pp. 161-170, On 10 April 1945, shortly before the Allied forces marched into Germany, and only 20 days before Adolf Hitler killed himself, Lauterbacher took his family to safety in the Harz, but not without having announced over wired radio the requisite exhortations to hold out against the onslaught. Two days earlier, on 8 April, he had loaded his car up with cigarettes so that he could flee south from the Harz posing as a cigarette sales agent. Leaving his family in the Harz on 11 April, after making it as far as Carinthia, Lauterbacher was seized and taken prisoner by the British on 26 May. Post war  =Internment, acquittal, and escape= Early in July 1946, the High British Military Court in Hanover acquitted Lauterbacher of the charge of having ordered early in April 1945 the murder of German and Allied detainees at the prison in Hamelin. In August 1947, new proceedings against Lauterbacher began at the Dachau International Military Tribunal. At issue this time was an order allegedly given by Lauterbacher in September 1944 for the shooting of twelve American airman who had been shot down over Goslar. In October 1947, this trial, too, ended in acquittal. Lauterbacher, who since the end of the war had been interned in the Sandbostel camp near Bremervörde, managed on 25 February 1948 to flee detention owing to circumstances that are still unclear. =Ratlines= He went underground, until he was arrested in Rome in April 1950. Here he was dealing with people smugglers who took people from former fascist states with warrants or charges outstanding against them to South America or the Middle East. Sent to the La Frachette camp near Rome by the Italians, who had declared him an \\"undesirable foreigner\\", Lauterbacher still managed to flee a few months later, in December 1950, to Argentina, following the same route Adolf Eichmann took the same year. In Buenos Aires he helped develop ratlines for other Nazis seeking to flee from Europe.\\"The Prize Lies of a Nazi Tycoon\\" , MICHAEL PINTO-DUSCHINSKY. Standpoint Magazine. April 2010. Retrieved May 5, 2010. =Anti-Israel activities= From there he went to Egypt with the assistance of the CIA and West German intelligence to train anti-Israel guerrillas. Later life He was reported by the police in Munich on 4 September 1956. As more intensive investigations got underway, Lauterbacher once more went underground, this time, though, without leaving any trail. In the early 1980s it came to light that between 1977 and 1979, Lauterbacher had been working as an adviser in the Omani Ministry of Youth. The last few years of his life he spent very reclusively in Germany. Only his death certificate establishes that he died in Seebruck. Hartmann Lauterbacher, Baldur von Schirach's deputy, was said to be the organizational talent and the active element of the Reich Youth Leadership. As Gauleiter and High President in Hanover, he bore a great deal of the responsibility for stripping Jews of their rights and deporting them. German justice, which had already begun proceedings through the Hanover prosecutor's office in 1947, later followed by investigative proceedings in Munich and Hanover, contented itself, however, to discontinue the investigation owing to lapse of time. The suspicion keeps arising that Hartmann Lauterbacher was active in the Allied secret service, and the Gehlen Organization.

His term focused on progressive legislation and suppression of white cap vigilante organizations operating in the southern part of the state. He was the seventh and last veteran of the American Civil War to serve as governor. Early life Durbin was born in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, on May 4, 1847, the son of William S. and Eliza Ann Sparks, the youngest of seven sons. While still a young boy, his family moved to New Philadelphia, Indiana where he attended public school and worked in his father's tannery producing leather. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, he and his brothers enlisted in the Union army. His brothers were accepted, but he was turned away because of a recent arm injury. After it healed he attempted to enlist again, and helped raise a company of the 139th Regiment Indiana Infantry, serving from April 1864 until the conclusion of the war. He mustered in at Camp Morton and his regiment was first dispatched to the Siege of Vicksburg, and was then in the expedition to Arkansas Post.Gugin, p. 216 He left the army after the war and studied briefly in a St. Louis, Missouri college before moving to Indianapolis, Indiana where he worked in a dry-goods store as a bookkeeper. In 1879 he left Indianapolis and moved to Anderson where he met Bertha McCullough. The two were married on October 6, 1875 and had two children. During the Indiana Gas Boom, Durbin worked with his father-in-law to found a number of manufacturing businesses and became moderately wealthy.Gugin, p. 217 Durbin became active in local politics and was elected as a member of the State Republican Central Committee and was appointed to the executive committee in charge of western headquarters. He played a prominent role nationally in the Grand Army of the Republic, and was involved in lobbying. At the outbreak of the Spanish–American War he enlisted in the army and promoted by Governor James A. Mount to colonel, and was given command of the 161st Regiment Indiana Infantry in July 1898. His regiment was deployed in the occupation of Havana, Cuba for three months after which he returned home. Durbin was nominated to run for governor in 1900, and easily won the convention vote. Opinion was strongly against Democrats, and the leading members of the party refused to run for governor that year. The party fielded John Kern to oppose Durbin, but Durbin became the first governor to win by majority in twenty-five years. Durbin's primary goal as governor was to bring efficiency to the state, and reform the government to function more economically, and to enact progressive legislation.Gugin, p. 218 Governor =White caps= His predecessors policy toward white cap organizations had led to an increase of their activities. Although exact numbers are not known, at least sixty-eight lynching had occurred in recent years against suspected criminals, and numerous other types of vigilante justice was being dealt out by the groups. Most of their activity was in the southern part of the state. The General Assembly passed anti-lynching laws in 1899, requiring sheriff's to petition the governor for military assistance when lynchings were threatened and granted the governor power to remove sheriffs from office who refused to turn over prisoners to state custody, and to call out the militia to protect prisoners. Despite the law, lynchings continued until Durbin took office. In 1902 he invoked the law after a lynching, removing from office numerous law enforcement officials and putting the militia on patrol.Gugin, p. 219 In 1903, a police officer was killed in Evansville, and the sheriff sent word to the governor, requesting assistance in protecting the suspect in custody. Durbin dispatched a company of militia to protect the jailhouse. A mob of the white caps soon surrounded the jailhouse and the militia and began taunting them for several hours. Someone in the crowd fired a shot at the soldiers, who responded by opening fire on the crowd, wounding eleven and killing one. The mob quickly fled. No more lynchings would occur in Indiana for more another thirty years until the deaths of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith. =Progressive agenda= Indiana's industry had grown at a rapid pace over the past decade, and numerous labor unions had begun to form in the state. He advocated additional anti-trust protections for the public, enactment of fines for vote buyers, and the creation of juvenile courts. He conducted statewide audits, and discovered an embezzlement scheme at Indiana University by Monroe County officials. He threatened to move the college to another city if the board could not get the situation under control.Gugin, p. 220 Automobile usage in Indiana went from almost non-existent to such a level that Durbin began to advocate the construction of superior state highways. He saw the advantages of Indiana's position in the nation, which required a large part of traffic from the west to pass through Indiana in order to reach the northeastern United States. Final years When Durbin left office he returned to Anderson to resume overseeing his business interest. He returned to the public again in 1911 when Democrats attempted to call a constitutional convention. Along with former Governor Frank Hanly, he traveled the state railing against the Democrats and their proposed constitution as socialist. He remained active in the party, and was nominated as the Republican candidate to for governor again in 1912. The Republican party had fractured over the constitutional issue, despite preventing the calling of a convention. Many members left to join the Progressive Party in the following year. Durbin came in third in the election and was defeated by Democrat Samuel M. Ralston, with the Progressive candidate Albert Beveridge coming in second.Gugin, p. 221 Durbin returned again to Anderson where he remained the rest of his life. He died on December 18, 1928, of bronchial pneumonia following an attack of influenza. He was buried in Crown Hill Cemetery.

Opened in 1851, the 2,242 capacity prison is the oldest prison in the state. The all-male facility is located in Salem and is operated by the Oregon Department of Corrections. OSP contains Oregon's death row, which houses most of the 37 people awaiting execution in Oregon. It also contains an intensive management wing, which is being transformed into a psychiatric facility for mentally ill prisoners throughout Oregon. History Oregon State Penitentiary in 1892 Prior to the construction of prisons in Oregon, many people convicted of crimes were either hanged or pardoned.Bancroft, History of Oregon (1888), pp. 155–156. Oregon State Penitentiary was originally built in Portland in 1851. Operating this facility proved difficult because it spanned two blocks, with a city street running through the middle. In 1859, the facility was leased to private contractors (Robert Newell and L. N. English), who instituted a system of prison labor. This new system led to many escapes.Bancroft, History of Oregon (1888), pp. 644–645. In 1866 the state officially moved the penitentiary to a site in Salem, enclosed by a reinforced concrete wall averaging in height. The prison also began using a device called the \\"Gardner shackle\\" (later called the \\"Oregon Boot\\"), a heavy metal device attached to prisoners' legs to impede movement. Bunko Kelly describes prison guards flogging several people to death, including a disabled African American named Monroe. Escapes continued at the new facility, despite the wall and the Boot. The most famous of these occurred in 1902, when Harry Tracy and David Merrill killed three guards with a gun. Details about this period can be read in Thirteen Years in Oregon State Penitentiary, a book written by Joseph \\"Bunko\\" Kelly. Kelly describes scenes of extreme brutality, particularly floggings, which he recounts happening to whites, blacks, Indians, and a Chinese \\"half boy and half woman\\". He describes negligent doctors and a lack of mental health care, and complains that whiskey drinking affects the behavior of the guards. He also identifies a five-year period in which the warden stopped newspaper deliveries to prevent convicts from learning of pardons.Joseph \\"Bunko\\" Kelly, Thirteen Years in Oregon State Penitentiary, 1908. The prison announced in 1904 that it would end the use of flogging, and instead punish prisoners by spraying them with cold water from a garden hose.\\"Oregon Water Cure: As Administered in Penitentiary It Proves Better Than Flogging\\", Washington Post (from the Portland Oregonian), 26 August 1904, p. 11; accessed via ProQuest. The prison experimented briefly in 1917–1918 with an \\"honor system\\" in which 130 prisoners were paroled with certain conditions. The prisoners were released into jobs outside the prison during the daytime. After 66 of these absconded, Governor James Withycombe announced that he would find a way for them to work jobs within the prison facility.\\"Honor System in the Oregon Prison\\", Christian Science Monitor, 24 August 1918; accessed via ProQuest. In the 1920s, the Penitentiary created a flax plant which employed more than half of its inmates. Inmates worked on construction and in the fields, and were paid $0.50–$1.00 per day. The plant was touted nationally as a way to make the prison financially self-sustaining, and to rehabilitate prisoners by giving them something to do and preparing them to work.\\"Oregon State Penitentiary Finds Work Proves Its Worth: Flax Works, Flax Works, Chief Industry at Oregon State, Nationally Known\\" Christian Science Monitor, 21 April 1926, p. 5A; accessed via ProQuest.

In September 1988, 28 female inmates at the Oregon Correctional Center staged a sit-down protest that prison Superintendent Robert H. Scheidler described as the first of its kind in the facility's history. On October 1, between four and eight women staged a hunger strike—inmate Jody Bedell fasted for 24 days before ending the strike. Both the sit-down protest and hunger strike were meant to call attention to overcrowding, poor medical care, inadequate education programs and the shortage of showers and laundry machines. At the time, the prison was built for 80 women but was housing over 140 women and had only one shower for every 43 inmates. The women who participated in the hunger strike were ordered to spend a year in a segregation unit and were fined $214.Sarah B.

The facility itself consists of ten acres, surrounded by a 25-foot wall which is patrolled by armed correctional officers.Jessica Rondema, \\"Oregon State Penitentiary\\", The Oregon Encyclopedia, c. May 2011. Most housing in the penitentiary is in large cell blocks with most inmates housed in single man cells that have been converted to double man cells to increase capacity. The penitentiary also has a full service infirmary. =Intensive Management Unit= Oregon State Penitentiary was the site of Oregon's first supermax unit: the \\"Intensive Management Unit\\" (IMU), constructed in 1991. The 196-bed self-contained Intensive Management Unit provides housing and control for those death row and male inmates who disrupt or pose a substantial threat to the general population in all department facilities. In 2006 this facility held 147 people (out of a total of 784 across Oregon) in solitary confinement. Conditions in the IMU were the object of public criticism, triggered particularly by multiple suicide of mentally ill prisoners.Mary Beth Pfeiffer, \\"Mentally ill inmates need more help\\", Portland Oregonian, 12 February 2005. Former warden Brian Belleque also expressed doubts about the possibility of rehabilitation in the IMU, saying: \\"We realize that 95 to 98 percent of these inmates here are going to be your neighbor in the community. They are going to get out.\\"Laura Sullivan, \\"As Populations Swell, Prisons Rethink Supermax\\", NPR, 27 July 2006. Prisoners in the OSP IMU were moved in 2009 to Snake River Correctional Institution in Ontario, Oregon.Sal Rodriguez, \\"'Total Isolation': Solitary Confinement in Oregon\\", Solitary Watch, 11 September 2012. In 2010, ODOC began to convert the IMU into a psychiatric facility, which will serve mentally ill prisoners from across Oregon.Stuart Tomlinson, \\"Oregon's mentally ill prison inmates will all move to one building at the Oregon State Penitentiary\\", The Oregonian, 15 April 2010.Alan Gustafson, \\"Oregon State Penitentiary to adapt to mental illnesses\\", Statesman Journal, 25 April 2010. Some advocates for the mentally ill have argued that the IMU facility is not suitable for treating the mentally ill because it is \\"dark\\" and \\"crowded\\", and generally designed for solitary confinement.Chris Lehman, \\"Prison Mental Health Unit Not Designed for Treatment\\", Oregon Public Broadcasting (Northwest News Network), 29 February 2012. =Death row= OSP has long been the site of death row in Oregon. As of November 2012, death row contains 34 men (with two men and one woman, also slated for execution, held elsewhere for medical reasons). Death row includes notorious serial killers such as Dayton Leroy Rogers.\\"Oregon Death Row\\", Oregon Live (The Oregonian), accessed 10 November 2012. OSP also contains the lethal injection chamber where prisoners are executed.James Pitkin, \\"Killing Time:Dead Men Waiting on Oregon’s Death Row\\", Willamette Week, 23 January 2008. Executions in Oregon were conducted in public by counties until 1902, when they were centralized (and made less spectacular) at the State Penitentiary.William R. Long, \\"Death penalty\\", The Oregon Encyclopedia, c. 2008. Since the US Supreme Court reaffirmed the death penalty in Gregg v. Georgia (1976), Oregon has executed only two people: Douglas Wright, in 1996, and Harry Charles Moore, in 1997. Governor John Kitzhaber announced an official moratorium on executions in November 2011.William Yardley, \\"Oregon Governor Says He Will Block Executions\\", New York Times, 22 November 2011. OSP prisoner Gary Haugen says he is ready to die and has sought to waive this waiver and be executed. =Hospice= Oregon State Penitentiary is home to a hospice, which is staffed by volunteers from among the prison population. The current incarnation of the hospice began in 1999, and won \\"Program of the Year Award\\" from the National Commission on Correctional Health Care in 2001. The OSP hospice was at the forefront of a national trend of prison hospices—reacting to increased prison deaths resulting from the HIV/AIDS epidemic and from harsher sentencing laws. The program's volunteer-based structure has served as a model for other institutions.Jaime Shimkus, \\"Prison Hospice Comforts the Dying, Touches the Living\\", CorrectCare, Spring 2002.Jeff Barnard, \\"Convicted Murderers Relearn Compassion in Prison Hospice\\", Los Angeles Times (AP), 1 August 1999. =Minimum security annex= Oregon State Penitentiary has a separate minimum security facility located on its grounds.\\"Oregon State Penitentiary.\\" Oregon Department of Corrections.

Criticism and legal actions Prisoners and advocates have charged the OSP system with racism, saying that the system discriminates against black inmates—both by placing them in worse conditions and by failing to protect them from racially motivated violence. They cite the case of Pete Wilson, a black prisoner who was stabbed by ten white inmates while white guards looked on.Larry Baker, \\"IMPRISONED: OSP Prisoner Stabbed\\", The Skanner, 6 October 1982; accessed via ProQuest. \\"Wilson recalled one of the guards who was supposedly supervising him repeatedly shouting for the inmates to stop fighting, while others merely stood in the gun tower and watched with rifles in hand. But the guards were white. Wilson stated it was 10 minutes before any guards were able to rescue him and by that time his lungs had been punctured and he had sustained many other wounds. During his struggle with the 10 whites, a Cuban prisoner, Ricardo Guerra, tried to assist Wilson but to no avail. 'I couldn't just stand by and see 10 white prisoners beating on a black man just because his skin is a different color,' said Guerra.\\" Black inmates also charged the OSP library with showing racial bias in access and employment. One black inmate described their opinion on the causes and effects of this bias:Larry Baker, \\"IMPRISONED: Bias in Library\\", The Skanner, 17 November 1982; accessed via ProQuest. > Black and other minorities at OSP have an acute problem with the librarian > when it comes to their gaining access to courts. First we recognize racism > is an ingrained traditional attitude. And second, prisons are reflections of > those views.

But quite often > the librarian tries to preclude these efforts in many different ways. Such > as telling prisoners his notary seal is broken and of course this tactic > will go on for two or three weeks until one of the counselors puts a stop to > it, being that if the librarian doesn't notarize documents they will have to > do his job. Prisoners have accused OSP guards of homophobia, censoring homosexual materials in the men's prison and contact among inmates in the women's prison (closed in 2010). In 1982, prisoners filed a class-action lawsuit against the prison, charging that their rights to receive mail were being violated. In particular, they charged prison officials with censoring the mail by withholding \\"not approved\\" material, including material related to homosexuality.\\"ACLU files against prison censorship\\", The Skanner, 10 March 1982; accessed via ProQuest. District Judge Owen Panner decided for the prisoners and the ACLU, ruling that blacklisting certain publications and materials (including those related to homosexuality) violated the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the prisoners. However, some advocates believed that the legal ruling would have little effect. Carole Pope, a former prisoner at OSP, said: \\"We've had five major law suits. After each one, there was a token change, then it went back to the way it was. They [prison officials] don't take any of this seriously.\\"Jil Clark, \\"Court Bars Prison Censorship of Periodicals\\", Gay Community News 10 (38), 16 April 1983; accessed via ProQuest. In 1977, three inmates (two current and one former) filed a lawsuit alleging that they had been harmed by medical experiments using drugs and radiation. The experiments were voluntary and affected 67 prisoners, who were paid $125 each.\\"Convicts Who Were Part of Test Of Drugs File $3.6 Million Suit\\", New York Times (UPI), 11 September 1977; accessed via ProQuest.

Its aroma is unique, bringing honeysuckle and peach ripe, succulent, with perfect harmony of sugar, alcohol and acidity. Sweet taste sometimes has a bitter sensuous taste of almonds.

It is a part of the municipality of Edam-Volendam in the Dutch province of North Holland. Kwadijk is located about north of Amsterdam and about north of Purmerend. In 2001, the village of Kwadijk had 270 inhabitants. The built-up area of the village was 0.05 km², and contained 101 residences. The statistical district \\"Kwadijk\\", which covers the village and the surrounding countryside, has a population of around 780. History Map from around 1868 left At least from 1414 there was a church in Kwadijk. That year the inhabitants of Kwadijk became \\"citizens\\" of Edam, from where the village was largely controlled. Many of the inhabitants of Kwadijk had relocated from the abandoned village Drei or Verdrey to the north of current Kwadijk between the Nieuwendijk and the Wijzend (near present-day Hobrede). At least until 1567 the Kwadijkers maintained the old graveyard of Drei. In the 16th and 17th centuries, in addition to livestock and fishery, inhabitants also received income from through sailing industry. The old cruciform church from the beginning of the 16th century was replaced by the present church of Kwadijk, which dates back to 1835. On January 1, 1812 both Kwadijk and Warder were added to the municipality of Middelie, however on May 1, 1817 all three emerged as independent municipalities. Yet even while independent, all three municipalities shared one mayor and were administered from the nearby city of Edam. This situation changed in 1890, when at the age of 29, Simon Berman was appointed mayor of Kwadijk, Middelie, and Warder. Berman moved the mayor's residence and local government office for the three municipalities into Kwadijk so he could live and provide services among his constituents. On May 20, 1884 a railway station was opened in Kwadijk, on the line Enkhuizen- Zaandam. Originally the station was known as Kwadijk-Edam. From May 15, 1935 it was named Kwadijk. Not for long, as the station was closed on May 15, 1938. An occasional train would still make a stop at Kwadijk until 1941. Between May 1, 1906 and May 15, 1933 one could travel from \\"Kwadijk-Edam\\" railway station to Volendam and Edam by a steam-propelled tram, operated by the Hollandsche IJzeren Spoorweg-Maatschappij.Historie Kwadijk Some of the tram's right-of-way is still distinguishable in the landscape between Kwadijk and Edam. After its final closure, the structure of Kwadijk's railway station served as residential building, art studio, and warehouse. In 2010 the building was rehabbed into a modern office building, while preserving historical elements.http://www.noordhollandsdagblad.nl/nieuws/stadstreek/waterland/article6398891.ece/Oude- treinstation-weer-blikvanger-in- Kwadijkhttp://www.stationsweb.com/nieuws.asp?rec=3275 In 1925 the water tower of Kwadijk was built by the provincial water supply company of North Holland. It was designed by the architect B.F. van Niefelt. The tower later became a residential structure. It is a national monument of the Netherlands. In 1970 the municipality of Kwadijk merged into the new municipality of Zeevang. As part of the reorganization, the hamlet of Verloren Einde was added to the village of Kwadijk.

He was again selected for the combined West Indies team in Trinidad against Lord Brackley's team three years later. Sydney Smith in 1906 He was selected to tour England with the second West Indies team in 1906. He was described pre-tour as \\"the best amateur bowler in the West Indies, bowls slow left hand; can also bat very well\\"Cricket – A Weekly Record of the Game, 1906 page 178 and \\"he is regarded as the crack bowler of the side. A left-hander with easy delivery who can make the ball break either way, and who sends down a deceptive fast ball. He can hit with vigour and precision and cuts well. He is a good field in the slips\\".The West Indian Tour of England 1906 by Gerry Wolstenholme, page 8 Smith started the tour extremely well, being particularly effective against the weaker sides. After 8 matches (4 first class, 4 against minor teams) he had scored over 700 runs and taken over 50 wickets. After that his batting was disappointing although he continued to take wickets, including 12 in the final match against Northamptonshire. In first-class matches he scored 571 runs at an average of 24.82, including a century against Hampshire and taking 66 wickets at an average of 24.36. In all matches he performed the \\"double\\", scoring 1107 runs and taking 116 wickets, leading the averages in both categories. England career After the 1906 tour, he stayed in England to qualify for county cricket with Northamptonshire. During his two-year residence qualification he was only able to play against the touring teams. In 1907 he took 10 wickets against the South Africans and in 1908 he scored 23 and 76* and took 9 wickets against the Philadelphians. When he started playing regularly in 1909 he was an instant success, scoring more than 1000 runs and taking 115 wickets, his first full county season. In six seasons with the county, he passed the 1000-run mark four times and took 100 wickets four times, achieving the all-rounder's \\"double\\" in 1909, 1913 and 1914. In 1913, he became county captain during the season when George Vials fell ill and he retained the position in 1914. He was selected to play for the Gentlemen v Players a number of times, four times in the prestigious match at Lord's. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1915 for his performances in 1914. By this time first-class cricket had been suspended in England because of the First World War. In all he played 119 first class matches for Northamptonshire scoring 6396 runs (with 12 centuries) and taking 502 wickets. During his period with Northamptonshire he twice toured the West Indies; in 1910–11 and 1912–13. In 1910–11 he was second in the tourists first class batting averages and led their bowling averages, while 1912–13 his batting was a little disappointing but he was still second in the tourists' bowling averages. New Zealand career Smith moved again, this time to New Zealand, where he appeared in first-class matches from 1917–18 through to 1925–26, when he retired from the first class game. In 1919–20, he scored 256 for Auckland against Canterbury, which was his highest first-class score. In the next game against Wellington he took eight wickets for 55 runs in the first innings, and 13 wickets in the match. He was selected for the New Zealand team against the Australians in 1920–21, the MCC in 1922–23 and against the touring New South Wales team in 1923–24. \\"He used his height to the full to bowl a leg-break with a dropping ball and gave some fine exhibitions with the bat, though already in his mid-thirties\\".New Zealand Cricket, Volume II 1914-1933, T.W. Reese, 1936, page 38 In all he played 5 times for New Zealand and in 26 first class matches for Auckland. His uncles Frederick and Augustus Smith played for Barbados in early inter-colonial cricket. A biography, Cricket's Mystery Man: The Story of Sydney Gordon Smith: West Indies, MCC, New Zealand, by Bill Francis, was published in Australia in 2014.

He now manages AFC Telford United. He has notably played as a professional in the Football League for Shrewsbury Town. He has also played for Braintree Town, Canvey Island, Nuneaton Borough, Kidderminster Harriers, Grays Athletic, AFC Telford United, Fleetwood Town and Gainsborough Trinity. Career Cowan began his career at non-League club Braintree Town and moved to Canvey Island in 2003. He fell out of favour with Canvey Island manager Jeff King and in early 2005 was sent out on loan to Nuneaton Borough. Impressing for the Football Conference side, he was spotted by Shrewsbury Town who signed him on a permanent deal in March 2005. Shrewsbury did not use him regularly, with Cowan playing 15 times in the 2005–06 season. Early into the 2006–07 season he was sent out on loan to Kidderminster Harriers to gain more experience. He was recalled from this loan a few days short of the agreed month, in order to give him more preparation time for Shrewsbury's next league game, for which he appeared on the bench. Shrewsbury Town cancelled his contract on 1 January 2007, allowing him to join Grays Athletic. In March 2007, Cowan returned to Nuneaton Borough on one-month loan. Cowan was released by Grays Athletic by mutual consent on 9 June 2007. Finally after two loan previous spells in his career, he returned to Nuneaton Borough signing a two- year contract on 17 June 2007 ready for the club's Conference North promotion campaign ahead. Cowan's contract with Nuneaton was however announced to have been cancelled by mutual consent on 30 May 2008. After returning to Essex briefly Cowan decided Shropshire was the place for him and so returned opting to come out of full-time football signing a two-year at Nuneaton Borough while looking to pursue a career in sports development. He studied for a sports science degree at Shrewsbury College and had taken his coaching badges. He had also been involved with the Football Association helping to coach children of all ages and abilities. Cowan then signed for AFC Telford which enabled him to combine football with studying and coaching which he is hoping will all benefit him in his desire to give something back into a game that has been so good to him. In January 2010, Cowan signed for Conference North rivals Fleetwood Town following his release by Telford, making his debut on 7 February away at Corby. He joined Gainsborough Trinity in March 2010. Cowan left Gainsborough after the 2011/12 season to join Nuneaton Town, the club that reformed from Cowan's former team Nuneaton Borough, after they were promoted to the Conference Premier. Coincidentally Nuneaton had been promoted by beating Cowan's Gainsborough in the playoff final the previous season (although Cowan did not play in the final due to injury). Following Nuneatons relegation to The Conference North, Cowan is now being linked with a move to Tamworth, to join up with teammates from the Nuneaton side of 2013–14. On 18 May 2015, Cowan signed for National League North side Solihull Moors as player/coach. He left at the end of the 2015–2016 season. Outside of football Cowan is both founder, and head coach of his own Football Academy, coaching Children on Football, life skills and general guidance on a healthy life style.http://telfordutd.com/ References External links 1981 births Living people English footballers England semi-pro international footballers Association football defenders Braintree Town F.C. players Canvey Island F.C. players Nuneaton Borough F.C. players Shrewsbury Town F.C. players Kidderminster Harriers F.C. players Grays Athletic F.C. players A.F.C.

The complex consists of three separate facilities. The facilities are now referred to as Level V (opened 1985), Level VI (opened 1985) and Level II (opened 1990) for the minimum restrict facility, based upon the New Mexico adaptation of the Federal Bureau of Prisons system for inmate classification and restriction. The regular daily population is about 790 inmates, whose average age is 32. The Level VI Supermax site contains New Mexico's Death Row. This is where Terry Clark was executed in 2001. He remains, as of 2017, the only execution in New Mexico since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. The death penalty was repealed in New Mexico in 2009, and therefore no further executions have taken place. History The entrance to the Penitentiary of New Mexico, as seen from Highway 14. Opened in 1885, the New Mexico Penitentiary had been authorized by Congress since 1853.Johnson, Judith R. (1994) \\"A Mighty Fortress is the Pen: Development of the New Mexico Penitentiary\\" pp. 119-132 In DeMark, Judith Boycw (editor) (1994) Essays in Twentieth-Century New Mexico History University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, New Mexico, , pages 119-120 The design of the original facility on Cerrillos Road was based on the same plans used for Sing Sing and Joliet. The first prison industry produced bricks.These were probably adobe bricks, as the prison reports do not indicate any kilns for firing. Beginning in 1903, New Mexico became the first western state to employ prisoners in building highways.Johnson, pages 121-122 On 19 July 1922, prisoners at the penitentiary rioted against overcrowding, the poor food, and the use of excessive force by the prison authorities.Johnson, pages 124-125 When the inmates refused to return to their cells, the tower guards opened fire, killing one inmate and injuring five others. In the report following the riot, the prison authorities were blamed for lack of experience, and failure to understand how to control a prison population.New Mexico State Penitentiary Board of Commissioners (1924) Annual Report of the Board of Penitentiary Commissioners for the 11th Fiscal Year 1923 pp.1-2, The penitentiary's defunct gas chamber. The second riot was 15 June 1953. Inmates protesting the use of excessive force seized Deputy Warden Ralph Tahash and twelve guards and held them hostage. In the resulting melee, guards killed two inmates and wounded a number of others.Johnson, page 128 This second riot led to the construction in 1956 of a new facility about 11 miles south of the original prison, in open country along State Road 14, which came to be called \\"the main unit.\\" The original 1885 facility was demolished shortly thereafter. In the new 1956 facility, between the years 1967 and 1970, the population was below capacity and dorm rooms were used as classrooms. Warden J.E. Baker used Federal funds from President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty to address prison reform. It was called Project Newgate and the money was used to support programs such as prisoner education, job training, and community service. In 1980, Cell Block 4, at the far northern end from the Control Center, was the scene of one of the most violent prison riots in the correctional history of the United States. Over two days 33 inmates were killed and 12 officers were held hostage by prisoners who had escaped from crowded dormitories located at the southern end from the Control Center. Men were brutally butchered, dismembered, and decapitated and hung up on the cells and burned alive. This section of the prison was closed in 1998 and is now referred to as the \\"Old Main.\\" Systemic reforms after the riot and the Duran v. King consent decree, including implementation of the Bureau Classification System under Cabinet Secretary Joe Williams, led to the modern New Mexico prison system. The prison is reputedly haunted, with numerous unexplained phenomena, from prison doors opening and close of their own accord, to shadows, to ghostly voices and footsteps.

Their home ground moved from Ern Holmes Oval in April 2011 to Mike Kenny Oval History The club was formed in 1971. Pennant Hills were promoted to the top Sydney grade, the SFL (now Sydney AFL Premier Division) in 1977. The club has won the Sydney Premier Division premiership 5 times. Their first was won in 2000, when the Demons defeated North Shore 15.12 (102) to 12.7 (79) at Macquarie University. Their second was in 2006, at Henson Park. The Demons scored eight behinds in a row to defeat the previously undefeated East Coast Eagles by two points. Pennant Hills 5.20 (50) East Coast Eagles 7.6 (48) The third flag in 2008 again came against East Coast Eagles, with a record 104-point win also at Henson Park. Pennant Hills 20.12 (132) East Coast Eagles 3.10 (28) The Demons won again in 2015 against the highly fancied East Coast Eagles Pennant Hills 14.5 (89) East Coast Eagles 7.12 (54). This was the third time the two clubs had played off in the final game of the season, with all three being played at Henson Park and all three going the way of the demons. The most recent flag was in 2017 against the highly rated Sydney University side.

It was developed as part of the Missile Defense Agency's Ballistic Missile Defense System. The radar is mounted on a fifth generation CS-50 twin-hulled semi- submersible oil platform. Conversion of the vessel was carried out at the AmFELS yard in Brownsville, Texas; the radar mount was built and mounted on the vessel at the Kiewit yard in Ingleside, Texas. It is nominally based at Adak Island in Alaska, but has spent significant time at Pearl Harbor in test status.  Specifications  * Vessel length: * Vessel height: from keel to top of radome * Vessel draft: approximately when in motion or not on station; approximately when on station * Vessel stability: remains within 10 degrees of horizontal on station (fully passive stabilization) * Cost: * Crew: Approximately 75-85 members, mostly civilian contractors * Radar range: * Displacement: Details SBX-1 is part of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system under development by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA). The decision to place the system on a mobile sea-based platform was intended to allow the vessel to be moved to areas where it is needed for enhanced missile defense. Fixed radars provide coverage for a very limited area due to the curvature of the Earth. However, the same limitation applies to the SBX. SBX's primary task is discrimination of enemy warheads from decoys, followed by precision tracking of the identified warheads. Testing has raised doubts about the system's ability to perform these tasks, to deal with multiple targets, and to report accurately to command authorities. The vessel has many small radomes for various communications tasks and a large central dome that encloses a phased-array, 1,800 tonne (4,000,000 pound) X band radar antenna. The small radomes are rigid, but the central dome is not - the flexible cover is supported by positive air pressure amounting to a few inches of water. The amount of air pressure is variable depending on weather conditions. The radar antenna itself is described as being . It has 45,000 solid-state transmit- receive modules mounted on an octagonal flat base which can move ±270 degrees in azimuth and 0 to 85 degrees elevation (although software currently limits the maximum physical elevation to 80 degrees). The maximum azimuth and elevation velocities are approximately 5-8 degrees per second. In addition to the physical motion of the base, the beam can be electronically steered off bore-sight (details classified). There are currently 22,000 modules installed on the base. Each module has one transmit-receive feed horn and one auxiliary receive feed horn for a second polarization, totaling 44,000 feedhorns. The base is roughly 2/3 populated, with space for installation of additional modules. The current modules are concentrated toward the center to minimize grating lobes. This configuration allows it to support the very-long-range target discrimination and tracking that GMD's midcourse segment requires. The radar is never pointed at land, for the safety of the inhabitants. In addition to the power consumed by the radar, the thrusters which propel the vessel are electric and require substantial power. The maximum speed is approximately . To support this and all other electrical equipment, the vessel currently has six 3.6-megawatt generators (12-cylinder Caterpillar diesels). The generators are in two compartments, one port and one starboard. SBX entering Pearl Harbor, Hawaii for repairs on 9 January 2006 The radar is derived from the radar used in the THAAD theater ballistic missile defense system, and is a part of the layered ballistic missile defense (BMDS) program of the United States Missile Defense Agency (MDA). One important difference from Aegis is the use of X band in the SBX. Aegis uses S band, and Patriot uses the higher- frequency C band. The X band frequency is higher still, so its shorter wavelength enables finer resolution of tracked objects. The radar was described by Lt. Gen Trey Obering (former director of MDA) as being able to track an object the size of a baseball over San Francisco in California from Chesapeake Bay in Virginia, approximately away. The radar will guide land- based missiles from Alaska and California, as well as in-theater assets, depending on the mission. The vessel is classed by ABS and has the IMO number of 8765412. SBX departing Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on 31 March 2006 The first such vessel is scheduled to be based in Adak Island, Alaska, part of the Aleutian Islands. From that location it will be able to track missiles launched toward the US from both North Korea and China. Although her homeport is in Alaska, she will be tasked with moving throughout the Pacific Ocean to support her mission. The hull code number given to the SBX vessel, \\"SBX-1\\", indicates the possibility of further units of the class. In circumstances when a vessel is required to be continually on duty over a long period of time, common naval practice is to have at least three units of the type available to allow for replenishment, repair and overhaul. Three further vessels of the CS-50/Moss Sirius design were under construction or contract at the Severodvinsk Shipyard in Russia as of early 2007, but were configured for oil production. On 11 May 2011, Col. Mark Arn, the SBX project manager for MDA, said that the \\"SBX is the only one of its kind and there are no current plans for another one\\". In July 2011, a Missile Defense Agency spokesman explained that other, smaller radars in the Pacific will \\"pick up the slack\\" while SBX is in port with its radar turned off. Operational history The SBX deployed in 2006. The ship has spent time for maintenance and repair at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii several times, including 170 days in 2006, 63 days in 2007, 63 days in 2008, 177 days in 2009, and 51 days in 2010. When not at Hawaii, the SBX has been on operational deployments in the Pacific, including the waters off Alaska. The ship has not moored at Alaska, in spite of the construction of a $26 million, eight-point mooring chain system installed in 2007 in Adak's Kuluk Bay. On 23 June 2009, the SBX was moved to offshore Hawaii in response to a potential North Korean missile launch. Between 2009 and 2010, the vessel spent 396 continuous days at sea. The SBX failed during a flight test on 31 January 2010, designated FTG-06. The test was a simulation of a North Korean or Iranian missile launch. The test failure arose from two factors, the first being that algorithms in the SBX radar software (designed to filter out extraneous information from the target scene) were left disengaged for the test, and the second was a mechanical failure in a thruster on the kill vehicle. During flight test FTG-06a on 15 December 2010, the SBX performed as expected, but intercept of the target missile was again not achieved. In May 2011, the SBX-1 entered Vigor Shipyard (formerly the Todd Pacific Shipyard) in Seattle for a $27 million upgrade and maintenance work by contractor Boeing. The work was completed in about three months and in August 2011, SBX-1 departed Seattle for deployment. In December 2011, MDA transferred responsibility for the SBX vessel management and physical security to the U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command. MDA retains responsibility for communications, the X-band Radar, and for mission integration. In February 2012, the Missile Defense Agency requested only $9.7 million per year for Fiscal Years 2013 through 2017, down from $176.8 million in fiscal 2012. This reduced amount would be used to maintain SBX in a “limited test support” role, \\"while also retaining the ability to recall it to an active, operational status if and when it is needed.” In April 2012, it was reported that SBX-1 had left Pearl Harbor and was assumed to be being deployed to monitor North Korea's planned Unha-3 missile in the launch window of 12–16 April 2012. The vessel returned to Pearl Harbor on 21 May 2012. It redeployed to monitor the next North Korean launch attempt at the end of 2012. In April 2013, it was reported that SBX-1 was being deployed to monitor North Korea. It has never been deployed to Adak. In November 2015, it was moved to Pearl Harbor for repairs and testing. It departed Pearl Harbor November 2017 for North Pacific Ocean waters to monitor North Korea ballistic missile operations. In January 2017 the SBX-1 was deployed into the Pacific during North Korean threats of ICBM and nuclear attacks on other nations. The radar was able to perform its mission of tracking a target operating at ICBM speeds during the interception of a mock ICBM by a GMD interceptor on 30 May 2017. In May 2019, the SBX-1 docked on the north side of Ford Island in Pearl Harbor, where it underwent maintenance. It departed Pearl Harbor on 26 September 2019.

He served as reeve for the township from 1841 to 1857 and warden for the united counties of Frontenac, Lennox and Addington from 1849 to 1857. Over time, he expanded his business interests into the trade in timber. He took advantage of his political connections to support legislation in favour of the Grand Trunk Railway and received a contract to build a railway bridge and an appointment as arbitrator for the railway company. In 1854, he was elected to the 5th Parliament of the Province of Canada representing Lennox and Addington; he was re-elected to the 6th Parliament. Although he was a Reformer, he helped prop up the Liberal-Conservative coalition during his time in office.

He entered the snow event in Sweden and finished a very respectable 28th, in what is a very specialist event. He was 5th amongst the privateer crews. One of the most remarkable achievements of Andrew's career was winning the Jim Clark Memorial Rally for three consecutive years, breaking the record in the process. On August 11 and 12 2007 at Maasmechelen in Belgium Nesbitt contested his first ever round of the FIA European Championships for Rallycross Drivers with a 550+bhp strong spare Saab 9-3 T16 4x4 of Swede Per Eklund. Nesbitt recently acquired a Solar energy company, Cool Power, which he later incorporated into Cross Energy, under the Cross-Group, along with its fruit ripening, hire and refrigeration departments. With Cross Energy, Nesbitt introduced Northern Ireland's first solar powered car charger. References * \\"Supreme Nesbitt dominates Clark Rally\\", The Scotsman.

Collegiate career Bosley was a third team Class B all-state fullback at Green Bank High School when he was offered a full scholarship to play for the Mountaineers. Bosley was an immediate starter and contributed to West Virginia going from 5-5 in 1951 to 7-2 in 1952. In 1954 after a dominating performance against Penn State, Bosley was named Associated Press Player of the Week. He went on to earn consensus All-America honors as a senior in 1955. West Virginia won 31 of 38 games Bosley played in during his four seasons from 1952-55. Bosley, also an Academic All-American with a degree in chemical engineering, was invited to play in the College Football All-Star Game, the North-South Game and the Senior Bowl. Professional career The San Francisco 49ers made Bruce Bosley their second-round selection in the 1956 NFL Draft. Bosley played his entire rookie season at defensive end. By 1957, Bosley switched to line and was the team’s starting left guard, earning his first Pro Bowl berth in 1960. Two years later in 1962 when the team was searching for a center after an injury to starter Frank Morze, all-pro guard Bosley started at center. Bosley was named to the Pro Bowl again in 1965 and was honored two more times in 1966 and 1967. Bosley spent another season with the 49ers in 1968 and a year with the Atlanta Falcons in 1969 before retiring. Post-football By 1967, Bosley was cultivating his other passion: restoring old homes. NFL Films visited his Hillsborough W.S. Crocker Estate carriage house for a show called “They Lead Two Lives,” which chronicled his career as both a star football player and respected home builder. During the next 11 years he remodeled two other estates in Hillsborough as president of Interior Design, a home building, remodeling, interior decorating, furnishing and real- estate company. Personal life Bosley became part-owner of a wholesale electrical supply house in addition to his home remodeling business and was also well known for his civic and charitable activities in San Francisco. Among his most prominent roles was membership on the board of directors for the San Francisco Annex for Cultural Arts, membership on the mayor’s committee for the San Francisco Council for the Performing Arts, and a long-time volunteer role with both the San Francisco Film Festival and the San Francisco Ballet. Bosley also served a stint as the president of the NFL Alumni Association. He lived and thrived in San Francisco until his death from a heart attack on April 26, 1995. Despite spending nearly 40 years of his life in northern California, Bosley never forgot his West Virginia roots. “Things may change and your career may take you away in a different direction but there are things you never forget. I’ve never left my roots. They are in West Virginia,” Bosley told Charleston Daily Mail sports editor Bill Smith several years ago. Legacy Bosley is listed on the San Francisco 49ers “Golden Era” team from 1946–1969 and he was named to the college football’s 75th Silver Anniversary Team in 1981. Bosley, a member of the College Football Hall of Fame, was a part of West Virginia University’s second hall of fame induction class of 1992. West Virginia University has announced that they will retire his number, 77, in a pregame ceremony on September 3, 2016. More recently, he was named the state of West Virginia’s 30th greatest sports figure in a poll conducted by CNNSI.com. Dave Beronio, sports editor of the Vallejo Independent Press, once wrote of Bosley: “As a newsman of more than 40 years, I have found very few ‘Bruce Bosleys,’ those willing to contribute and participate during and after their days as stars. It would be difficult for me to believe that I will see his equal again in our area.” References 1933 births 1995 deaths All-American college football players San Francisco 49ers players Atlanta Falcons players Western Conference Pro Bowl players West Virginia Mountaineers football players College Football Hall of Fame inductees ","title":"Bruce Bosley"},{"id":"4301195","text":"Warder is a small village in the Dutch province of North Holland.

He played college football at Stanford University, where he was the team's MVP during his senior season. He was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals in the fourth round of the 1974 NFL Draft, but was shortly traded to the Eagles for first- and sixth-round draft picks after Cincinnati acquired another quarterback in Wayne Clark; Boryla had threatened to defect to the World Football League if he was not traded. The move reunited Boryla with Eagles head coach Mike McCormack, who worked with him at that year's Senior Bowl. Boryla spent much of his tenure in Philadelphia sharing quarterbacking duties with Roman Gabriel. In 1975, he was named to the 1976 Pro Bowl roster despite losing the starting job partway through the season opener and throwing for just 996 passing yards, six touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. Boryla, who had planned to attend the New York University School of Law, was approached by the NFL to play in the game as other NFC quarterbacks were injured and declined their invitations. He threw two touchdown passes in the final minutes of the game, including a trick play he created called the \\"Boryla Special\\", to lead the NFC to a 23–20 win. Boryla started ten games for the Eagles in 1976 before joining the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1977. After missing the year with a knee injury (which Buccaneers head coach John McKay called \\"the most devastating single blow we've had\\"), he played one more game in 1978 before ending his playing career. After retiring, he attended the Stetson University College of Law before becoming a lawyer and mortgage banker in Denver. In 2014, Boryla made his professional acting debut at Plays and Players Theatre in Philadelphia performing The Disappearing Quarterback, a one-man autobiographical theatrical performance that includes history, wit, and thinly veiled opinions regarding professional sports concussions.

It allows them to sell products or services to other companies or organizations that resell them, use them in their products or services or use them to support their works. It is a way to promote business and improve profit too. Business marketing is also known as industrial marketing or business-to-business (B2B) marketing. Business-to-government marketing, while still classified within the B2B discipline due to the sharing of dynamics, does differ slightly.  Origins  The practice of a purveyor of goods trading with another may be as old as commerce itself. In relation to marketing today, its history is more recent. Michael Morris, Leyland Pitt, and Earl Dwight Honeycutt say that for several years business marketing took \\"a back seat\\" to consumer marketing.Morris, Pitt and Honeycutt, pg. xix This entailed providers of goods or services selling directly to households through mass media and retail channels. David Lichtenthal (professor of marketing at Zicklin School of Business) notes in his research that business marketing has existed since the mid-19th century. He adds that the bulk of research on business marketing has come in the last 25 years. This began to change in the middle to late 1970s. Academic periodicals, including the Journal of Business-to-Business Marketing and the Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing now publish studies on the subject regularly. Professional conferences on business marketing are held every year and courses are commonplace at many universities today. According to Jeremy Kourdi, more than half of marketing majors start their careers in business marketing rather than consumer marketing.  Business and consumer markets  Business markets have derived demand – a demand in them exists because of demand in the consumer market. An example would be a government wishing to purchase equipment for a nuclear power plant. Another example would be when items are in popular demand. The underlying consumer demand that has triggered this is that people are consuming more electricity (by using more household devices such as washing machines and computers). Business markets do not exist in isolation. A single consumer market demand can give rise to hundreds of business market demands. The demand for cars creates demands for castings, forgings, plastic components, steel and tires. In turn, this creates demands for casting sand, forging machines, mining materials, polymers, rubber. Each of these growing demands has triggered more demands. As the spending power of citizens increases, countries generally see an upward wave in their economy. Cities or countries with growing consumption are generally growing business markets.  Vs. consumer marketing  Despite the differences between business and consumer marketing from a surface perspective being seemingly obvious, there are more subtle distinctions between the two with substantial ramifications. Dwyer and Tanner note that business marketing generally entails shorter and more direct channels of distribution. While consumer marketing is aimed at large groups through mass media and retailers, the negotiation process between the buyer and seller is more personal in business marketing. According to Hutt and Speh (2004), most business marketers commit only a small part of their promotional budgets to advertising, and that is usually through direct mail efforts and trade journals. While advertising is limited, it often helps the business marketer set up successful sales calls. Both business to business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) marketing is done with the ultimate intention of making a profit to the seller (business-to-business marketing). In B2C, B2B and B2G marketing situations, the marketer must always: * successfully match the product or service strengths with the needs of a definable target market; * position and price to align the product or service with its market, often an intricate balance; and * communicate and sell it in the fashion that demonstrates its value effectively to the target market. These are the fundamental principles of the 4 Ps of marketing (the marketing mix) first documented by E. Jerome McCarthy in 1960.McCarthy, Jerome E.: \\"Basic Marketing: A Managerial Approach\\". Homewood, IL: Irwin, 1996 While \\"other businesses\\" might seem like the simple answer, Dwyer and Tanner say business customers fall into four broad categories: companies that consume products or services, government agencies, institutions and resellers. The first category includes original equipment manufacturers, such as large auto-makers who buy gauges to put in their cars and also small firms owned by 1-2 individuals who purchase products to run their business. The second category - government agencies, is the biggest. In fact, the U.S. government is the biggest single purchaser of products and services in the country, spending more than $300 billion annually. But this category also includes state and local governments. The third category, institutions, includes schools, hospitals and nursing homes, churches and charities. Finally, resellers consist of wholesalers, brokers and industrial distributors. So what are the meaningful differences between B2B and B2C marketing? * A notable characteristic of B2B marketing is that it is rarely 'product first' or 'service first'. Marketing messages lead with significant context that acknowledges the customer's need or problem first and then establishes the relevance of the vendor's product or service to the customer's situation. In B2C marketing, the product or service features and benefits are called out up front. The customer is expected to already know why they need the product or service. * The buyer or customer is often a group or committee or department comprising several individuals who have specific roles in evaluating the proposed product or service. In B2C, the buyer is mostly an individual who needs the product or service for his or her own use. Offerings are evaluated mainly on price, reviews and word of mouth, although these are factors in B2B marketing as well A B2C sale is to a \\"Consumer\\" i.e. to a single person who pays for the transaction. A B2B sale is to a \\"Business\\" i.e. organization or firm. Given the complexity of organizational structure, B2B sales typically involve multiple decision makers. While the structure of a B2B sale involving an organization is understood, the psychology of a B2B sale, particularly from a marketing perspective, is not always devoid of human emotion. According to Bill Blaney (2012), a B2C and a B2B sale can be differentiated by the customer as either a \\"want\\" or a \\"need.\\" While retail consumer sales rarely hinge upon a product or service that customers \\"need\\" in order to survive (pharmaceutical and other health industry products notwithstanding), business sales are more directly applied to the growth and survival of that particular company, organization or institution. As a result, marketing to businesses relies on communication that can provide the company buyer with a level of comfort in the long-term performance of their product or service, and support in its continued efficacy. The marketing mix is affected by the B2B uniqueness which include complexity of business products and services, diversity of demand and the differing nature of the sales itself (including fewer customers buying larger volumes).Kotler & Pfoertsch: \\"B2B Brand Management\\", page 21. Springer Berlin, 2006 Because there are some important subtleties to the B2B sale, the issues are broken down beyond just the original 4 Ps of marketing developed by McCarthy.  Strategies  =B2B branding= B2B branding is different from B2C in some crucial ways, including the need to align corporate brands, divisional brands and product/service brands and to apply brand standards to material often considered “informal” such as email and other electronic correspondence. It is mainly of large scale when compared with B2C. = Product (or service) = Due to the fact that business customers are focused on creating shareholder value for themselves, the cost-saving or revenue-producing benefits of products and services are important to factor in throughout the product development and marketing cycles. = Target market = B2B Buyer Decision Map: Problem, solution alternatives, decision supportQuite often, the target market for a business product or service is smaller and has more specialized needs reflective of a specific industry or niche.Malaval: \\"Strategy and Management of Industrial Brands: Business to Business Products and Services\\", page 16. 2001 A B2B niche, a segment of the market, can be described in terms of firmographics which requires marketers to have good business intelligence in order to increase response rates. Regardless of the size of the target market, the business customer is making an organizational purchase decision and the dynamics of this, both procedurally and in terms of how they value the product offered, differ dramatically from the consumer market. There may be multiple influencers on the purchase decision, which may also have to be marketed to, though they may not be members of the decision making unit.Brown, Duncan and Hayes, Nick. Influencer Marketing: Who really influences your customers?, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008 In addition the research and decision making process a B2B buyer undertakes will be more extensive.Glynn. Business-to- business Brand Management, Emerald Group Publishing, 2009 Finally the purchase information that buyers are researching changes as they go through the buying process (see sample decision map). = Pricing = The business market can be convinced to pay premium prices more often than the consumer market with appropriate pricing structure and payment terms. This pricing premium is particularly achievable if it is supported with a strong brand.Kotler & Pfoertsch: \\"B2B Brand Management\\", page 53. Springer Berlin, 2006 = Promotion = Promotion planning is relatively easy when the decision making habits of the customer base and the vocabulary unique to their segment are known. Specific trade shows, analysts, publications, blogs and retail/wholesale outlets tend to be fairly common to each industry/product area. Once it is figured out for the industry/product, writing the promotion plan is simple. Promotion techniques rely heavily on marketing communications strategies (see below).. Promotion in digital marketing is as synonymous and vital as it is in physical marketing as it involves persuasion and advertising and the goal of advertising is to elicit a response. = Sales and distribution = The importance of a knowledgeable, experienced and effective direct (inside or outside) sales force is often critical in the business market. When selling through distribution channels also, the number and type of sales forces can vary tremendously and success as a marketer is highly dependent on their success. One of the distinguishing features of the B2B sales cycle is its comparably longer lead times compared to B2C. The result of this longer lead cycle affects the entire B2B marketing process. = Communications methodologies = The purpose of B2B marketing communications is to support the organizations' sales effort and improve company profitability. B2B marketing communications tactics generally include advertising, public relations, direct mail, trade show support, sales collateral, branding, and interactive services such as website design and search engine optimization. The Business Marketing Association is the trade organization that serves B2B marketing professionals. It was founded in 1922 and offers certification programs, research services, conferences, industry awards and training programs.  Positioning statement  An important first step in business to business marketing is the development of a positioning statement. This is a statement of what is done and how it will be better and more efficient than competitors.  Developing messages  The next step is to develop messages. There is usually a primary message that conveys more strongly to customers, what is done and how the customers benefit from it. This is often supported by a number of secondary messages, each of which may have a number of supporting arguments, facts and figures.  Campaign plans  A comprehensive plan to target resources where they will deliver the best return on investment. The infrastructure to support each stage of the marketing process has to be in place and the entire organization must be geared up to handle the inquiries appropriately.  Briefing an agency  A standard briefing document is usually a good idea for briefing an agency, as well as focusing the agency on what is important in the campaign. It serves as a checklist of all the important things to consider as part of the brief. Typical elements to an agency brief are: objectives, target market, target audience, product, campaign description, product positioning, graphical considerations, corporate guidelines, and any other supporting material and distribution.  Measuring results  The value in results measurement is in tying the marketing campaign back to business results. Metrics to measure the impact are e.g. cost per acquisition, cost per lead or tangible changes in customer perception.  Size  Hutt and Speh (2001) note that \\"business marketers serve the largest market of all; the dollar volume of transactions in the industrial or business market significantly exceeds that of the ultimate consumer market.\\" For example, they note that companies such as GE, DuPont and IBM spend more than $60 million a day on purchases to support their operations. Dwyer and Tanner (2006) say the purchases made by companies, government agencies and institutions \\"account for more than half of the economic activity in industrialized countries such as the United States, Canada and France.\\" A 2003 study sponsored by the Business Marketing Association estimated that business-to-business marketers in the United States spend about $85 billion a year to promote their goods and services. The BMA study breaks that spending out as follows (figures are in billions of dollars): * Trade Shows/Events -- $17.3 * Internet/Electronic Media -- $12.5 * Promotion/Market Support -- $10.9 * Magazine Advertising -- $10.8 * Publicity/Public Relations -- $10.5 * Direct Mail -- $9.4 * Dealer/Distributor Materials -- $5.2 * Market Research -- $3.8 * Telemarketing -- $2.4 * Directories -- $1.4 * Other -- $5.1  Growth  The tremendous growth and change that business marketing is experiencing is largely due to three \\"revolutions\\" occurring around the world today, according to Morris, Pitt and Honeycutt (2001). # Technological revolution. Technology is changing at an unprecedented pace, and these changes are speeding up the pace of new product and service development. A large part of that has to do with the Internet, which is discussed in more detail below. Technology and business strategy go hand in hand. Both are correlated. While technology supports forming organization strategy, the business strategy is also helpful in technology development. Both play a role in business marketing. #Entrepreneurial revolution. To stay competitive, many companies have downsized and reinvented themselves. Adaptability, flexibility, speed, aggressiveness and innovativeness are the keys to remaining competitive today. Marketing is taking the entrepreneurial lead by finding market segments, untapped needs and new uses for existing products, and by creating new processes for sales, distribution and customer service. #(Occurring within marketing itself) Companies are looking beyond traditional assumptions and they are adopting new frameworks, theories, models and concepts. They are also moving away from the mass market and the preoccupation with the transaction. Relationships, partnerships and alliances are what define marketing today. The cookie-cutter approach is out. Companies are customizing marketing programs to individual accounts.  Impact of the Internet  The Internet has become an integral component of the customer relationship management strategy for business marketers. Dwyer and Tanner (2006) note that business marketers not only use the Internet to improve customer service but also to gain opportunities with distributors. According to Anderson and Narus (2004), two new types of resellers have emerged as by-products of the Internet: infomediaries and metamediaries. Infomediaries, such as Google and Yahoo, are search engine companies that also function as brokers, or middlemen, in the business marketing world. They charge companies fees to find information on the Web as well as for banner and pop-up ads and search engine optimization services. Metamediaries are companies with robust Internet sites that furnish customers with multiproduct, multivendor and multiservice marketspace in return for commissions on sales. With the advent of b-to-b exchanges, the Internet ushered in an enthusiasm for collaboration that never existed before—and in fact might have even seemed ludicrous 10 years ago. For example, a decade ago who would have imagined Ford, General Motors and DaimlerChrysler entering into a joint venture? That's exactly what happened after all three of the Big Three began moving their purchases online in the late 1990s. All three companies were pursuing their own initiatives when they realized the economies of scale they could achieve by pooling their efforts. Thus was born what then was the world's largest Internet business when Ford's Auto-Xchange and GM's TradeXchange merged, with DaimlerChrysler representing the third partner. While this exchange did not stand the test of time, others have, including Agentrics, which was formed in 2005 with the merger of WorldWide Retail Exchange and GlobalNetXchange, or GNX. Agentrics serves more 50 retailers around the world and more than 300 customers, and its members have combined sales of about $1 trillion. Hutt and Speh (2001) note that such virtual marketplaces enable companies and their suppliers to conduct business in real time as well as simplify purchase processes and cut costs.  Design  B2B design often relies heavily on gradients. This is seen by some to represent the fluid nature of the sector and the democratic approach to design employed by B2B agencies. https://www.xmple.com/wallpaper/gradient-purple-blue- linear-5120x2880-c2-9400d3-00ced1-a-345-f-14.svg  References  * Anderson, James C., and Narus, James A.

He played five years in the National Football League (NFL) with the Detroit Lions, was a member of NFL championship teams in 1952 and 1953, was selected as a second-team All-Pro in 1950 and a first-team All-Pro in 1952, and played in the 1951 and 1953 Pro Bowl games. On December 3, 1950, he set Detroit team records with 12 catches, four touchdown receptions, 24 points, and 302 receiving yards. He later became a successful businessman in the oil and gas business in Texas. Early years Box was born in 1923 in Hamilton, Texas. From 1938 to 1942, he attended Jonesboro High School in Jonesboro, Texas, where he and his twin brother Boyce Box were both star athletes. He never saw a game of football until he was 18 years old, having played basketball throughout his youth. Box and his brother Boyce attended West Texas A&M; University on basketball scholarships and helped the Buffaloes win a Border Conference championship in 1943 before being inducted into the United States Marine Corps. He attained a rank of captain during World War II. He also attended Louisiana Tech University as part of the V-12 Navy College Training Program. When he returned from the Marine Corps in 1946, the West Texas A&M; basketball program slumped, and Box ended up playing college football as a quarterback and halfback for the West Texas A&M; Buffaloes football team from 1946 to 1948. Detroit Lions Box played professional football at the end and halfback positions in the National Football League (NFL) for five seasons with the Detroit Lions from 1949 to 1950 and 1952 to 1954. As a rookie in 1949, Box appeared in ten games, principally as a halfback. He rushed for 62 yards on 30 carries and caught 15 passes for 276 yards and four touchdowns. Box later recalled: \\"I probably was the worst halfback in the history of the league.\\" In 1950, Box's second year in the NFL, Detroit's coaches sought to take advantage of Box's speed and converted him into an end. Teaming up with Lions' quarterback Bobby Layne, Box appeared in 12 games and ranked among the league's leading receivers with 50 receptions (third), 1,009 receiving yards (second), 11 receiving touchdowns (second), 84.1 receiving yards per game (second), and 1,009 yards from scrimmage (second). On December 3, 1950, in a game against the Baltimore Colts, he set Detroit team records with 12 catches, four touchdown receptions, 24 points, and 302 receiving yards. His 302 receiving yards against the Colts was the second highest in NFL history at the time and currently ranks fifth in league history. After the 1950 season, Box was selected by the Associated Press (AP) as a second-team end on its All-Pro team. In February 1951, with the Korean War ongoing, Box was recalled from inactive reserve status by the United States Marine Corps. He missed the entire 1951 season due to military service. In June 1952, after being discharged from the Marine Corps, Box returned to the Lions. Box was the leading receiver on the 1952 Lions team that won the NFL championship. On October 19, 1952, he led a comeback victory over the Los Angeles Rams, with touchdown catches covering 64 and 10 yards. He led the NFL with 15 receiving touchdowns, ranked second in the league with 90 points scored, and again ranked among the league leaders with 924 receiving yards (fourth), 22.0 yards per reception (fourth), and 924 yards from scrimmage (sixth). In the 1952 NFL Championship Game, a 17–7 victory over the Cleveland Browns, Box was used mainly as a decoy but was credited with a key block on Doak Walker's 67-yard touchdown run. After the 1952 season, Box was selected by the AP as a first-team All Pro player and was selected to play in the 1953 Pro Bowl. In 1953, the Lions won their second consecutive NFL championship, though Box's receiving statistics declined significantly with only 16 receptions for 403 yards. He was reportedly \\"robbed of his blinding speed by a leg injury,\\" though he did manage a career-long 97-yard touchdown reception against the Green Bay Packers on Thanksgiving Day 1953. In the 1953 NFL Championship Game, he had four receptions for 54 yards. In 1954, Box's final year in the NFL, he appeared in 11 games but caught only six passes for 53 yards. Over the course of his five years with the Lions, Box totaled 129 receptions for 2,665 yards and 32 touchdowns. Business career and later years After retiring from football, he had a long career in business. He began in 1954 as an assistant manager in the Dallas office of the George A. Fuller Company, eventually serving as chairman of the board. He became president of the Oklahoma Cement Company and president and chairman of OKC Corporation, which later became known as the Box Energy Corporation. He also served as chairman of the board of regents for West Texas State University and the Texas Board of Penal Corrections. His Cloyce Box Ranch was used as the original Southfork Ranch for the mini-series that became the first season of the television series Dallas. Box and his wife, Fern Virginia Box, had four sons Don, Gary, Thomas and Douglas. And later married his second wife Ashley Scott Box. They lived in Frisco, Texas, for more than 30 years. Box died at his home in Frisco in 1993 at age 70.

Field Guide to Writing Flash Fiction. Ed. Masih, Tara L. Brookline, MA, USA: Rose Metal Press, 2009, 8-9; 11-14. Davis has produced several new translations of French literary classics, including Swann’s Way by Marcel Proust and Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert. Early life and education Davis was born in Northampton, Massachusetts, on July 15, 1947. She is the daughter of Robert Gorham Davis, a critic and professor of English, and Hope Hale Davis, a short-story writer, teacher, and memoirist. Davis initially \\"studied music—first piano, then violin—which was her first love\\". On becoming a writer, Davis has said, \\"I was probably always headed to being a writer, even though that wasn't my first love. I guess I must have always wanted to write in some part of me or I wouldn't have done it.\\" She studied at Barnard College, and at that time she mostly wrote poetry. In 1974 Davis married Paul Auster, with whom she had a son named Daniel. Auster and Davis later divorced; Davis is now married to the artist Alan Cote, with whom she has another son, Theo Cote. She is a professor of creative writing at the University at Albany, SUNY, and was a Lillian Vernon Distinguished Writer-in-Residence at New York University in 2012. Career Davis has published six collections of fiction, including The Thirteenth Woman and Other Stories (1976) and Break It Down (1986), a finalist for the PEN/Hemingway Award. Her most recent collections were Varieties of Disturbance, a finalist for the National Book Award published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in 2007, and Can't and Won't (2013). The Collected Stories of Lydia Davis (2009) contains all her fiction up to 2008. Davis has also translated Proust, Flaubert, Blanchot, Foucault, Michel Leiris, Pierre Jean Jouve and other French writers, as well as Belgian novelist Conrad Detrez and the Dutch writer A.L. Snijders. Reception and influence Davis has been described as \\"the master of a literary form largely of her own invention.\\" Some of her \\"stories\\" are only one or two sentences. Davis has compared these works to skyscrapers in the sense that they are surrounded by an imposing blank expanse. Michael LaPointe writing in the LA Review of Books goes so far as to say while \\"Lydia Davis did not invent flash fiction, ... she is so far and away its most eminent contemporary practitioner\\". Her \\"distinctive voice has never been easy to fit into conventional categories\\", writes Kassia Boddy in the Columbia Companion to the 21st Century Short Story. Boddy writes: \\"Davis's parables are most successful when they examine the problems of communication between men and women, and the strategies each uses to interpret the other’s words and actions.\\" Of contemporary authors, only Davis, Stuart Dybek, and Alice Fulton share the distinction of appearing in both The Best American Short Stories and The Best American Poetry series. In October 2003, Davis received a MacArthur Fellowship. She was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2005. Davis was a distinguished speaker at the 2004 &NOW; Festival at the University of Notre Dame. Davis was announced as the winner of the 2013 Man Booker International Prize on 22 May 2013. The official announcement of Davis' award on the Man Booker Prize website described her work as having \\"the brevity and precision of poetry\\". The judging panel chair Christopher Ricks commented that \\"[t]here is vigilance to her stories, and great imaginative attention. Vigilance as how to realise things down to the very word or syllable; vigilance as to everybody's impure motives and illusions of feeling.\\" Davis won £60,000 as part of the biennial award.

Providence is currently accredited by The Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE). The College offers over 200 courses that are transferable to University of Manitoba. Students can also transfer many courses to other Canadian educational institutions such as Brandon University and the University of Winnipeg.  History (synopsis)  The Winnipeg Bible Training School was founded in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada in 1925, and renamed a short time later to Winnipeg Bible Institute. Its founding was pushed forward by Reverend H. L. Turner. When it received a provincial charter to grant theological degrees in 1949, it was renamed Winnipeg Bible Institute and College of Theology The college started a full degree-granting program and was renamed Winnipeg Bible College in 1963. In 1970, facing the demolition of its quarters, shortfall in funds, and low enrolment, the college moved 50 kilometers south to Otterburne, Man., where it acquired the vacant building of the former St. Joseph's College, a Roman Catholic high school. Enrollment that year was 70 students. A graduate division was formed as Providence Theological Seminary in 1972, which had full membership in the Association of Theological Schools (ATS). In 1992 the school was renamed Providence College and Theological Seminary. For the academic year of 2009-10 more than 200 students had enrolled. The name was further changed in 2011 to Providence University College and Theological Seminary. Academics =Providence University College= Providence University College offers Bachelor of Arts degrees with majors in Communications and Media, Biblical and Theological Studies, Business Administration, TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages), Humanities, and Social Sciences.http://prov.ca/College/col_academics.aspx Providence University College has the following faculties. * Biblical and Theological Studies. Providence College's core is in Biblical and Theological Studies. It is offered to students in three different programs: a 1-year Certificate in Biblical and Theological Studies; 3-year B.A. degrees in Old Testament, New Testament, and Theology; and 4-year B.A. degrees in Old Testament, New Testament, and Theology. * Business Administration * Communications and Media * Aviation - studies in career and missionary flight * Youth Leadership * Humanities * Social Sciences Providence University College is also home to an English Language Institute which prepares international students, whose first language is not English, for successful academic studies at the post-secondary level. The inter-denominational evangelical Providence Theological Seminary prepares workers for service in global ministries, pastoral ministry, counseling, TESOL, and wider Christian service. =Providence Theological Seminary= The seminary offers one-year certificates and Master of Arts (in a range of majors and programs), Master of Divinity (in two tracks), and Doctor of Ministry degrees. The various programs offer options for students seeking ordination, advanced training, and general knowledge. Examples of majors (M.A.): global ministries, educational studies, counseling, theological studies, and Christian studies. For a two- or three- year degree, a one-year residency is required. In some cases, up to one year of courses can be studied on-line. Because the faculty and student body are international in scope, professors and students bring an enriching range of perspectives and experiences to the classroom setting and broader community life. The seminary publishes the journal Didaskalia. =William Falk Library and Learning Resource Centre= Providence College and Seminary proposed to improve the library facilities through the construction of this new learning resource centre. The Learning Resource Centre provides room for over 100,000 volumes and the latest in technology. The number of private study carrels and other private work stations was increased to 200. The facility is around 20,000 square feet.http://prov.ca/library/history.aspx Athletics Providence is the home of the Pilots, who compete in both the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA), as well as the Manitoba Colleges Athletics Conference (MCAC).

The airport is the fourth highest airport in Pakistan (1605 metres above sea level). It is second largest airport in the south region of the country and the largest for the province of Balochistan. It is situated 12 km south-west of the city spread over an area of . Average scheduled flights were 1332, non-scheduled flights 247, and the total recorded passenger flow was 152,698 in 2007. History The airport is linked to local cities as well as central hubs domestically by several airlines. International services are at present carried out by the national flag carrier, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), flydubai, and Air Arabia, although the city has also been served by regional carriers like Iran Aseman Airlines and Ariana Afghan Airlines in the past. The airport like many airports in pre-independence days were mainly a small airstrip offering air operations on behalf of the British Empire. After independence, the national flag carrier of Pakistan launched Karachi-Quetta-Lahore flights in 1954. This led to the development of a new runway that was constructed by a French company in 1958. Fokker F-27 Friendship flights initiated in 1964. This meant a new apron had to be constructed to deal with this larger turboprop aircraft in 1968. Due to the growth of the airport and number of passengers travelling through it, PIA launched Boeing flights from the airport in 1972. The first international flight was launched in 1977. The revenue the airport generated allowed the construction of the terminal building in 1982. A new control tower was built between 1982 and 1983. Navigational aids Precision Approach Path Indicators and Doppler Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (DVOR) were installed in 1984. The main concourse hall was inaugurated in 2001 to accommodate a great influx of passengers and families that came to see off their relatives. Airblue and Shaheen Air International operated flights from Quetta, however due to more lucrative opportunities decided to withdraw.  Structure  Quetta International Airport is the fourth highest airport as well as the second largest airport in province of Balochistan. The airport is currently under evaluation to being upgraded to make it compatible with future needs of the geographical location. The CAA is currently working with provincial government to develop the airport to meet international standards. The terminal building consists of the concourse hall, briefing hall, Domestic and International arrival and two lounges on first floor for domestic and international departures. The aerodrome category for fire fighting is CAT 8. It has annual capacity of 250,000 passengers and growing. The airport has several facilities to handle the normal needs of passengers such as telephone calling (domestic/international) booths, money exchange facilities, automated teller machines, Internet stations (powered by Wateen), information counters, gifts and souvenir shops, snack shops, rent a car services, as well as a post office. At present, the following technical features are available at the airport. In 2007, the CAA of Pakistan allocated a Rs 270m budget for the upgrading work on the airport. *Lounges **Two lounges each for domestic and international operations **One CIP Premium Lounge for premium passengers or VIP diplomats *Apron **Aircraft parking capacity is available for two wide body aircraft such as an A300 and three narrow body or prop aircraft such as Fokker or Airbus A319 at one time. *Runway ** runway with the ability to handle a weight of one wide-body aircraft such as the A-300. *Additional **Shell Aviation Ltd carry out the re-fuelling of aircraft under an exclusive licence. **New taxiways have been fully constructed and the tarmac reinforced to handle larger aircraft. **Aircraft maintenance is very low at this airport, as it is not a hub for any air carrier. **Heated Storage, Livestock Handling, and Security for Valuables cargo can be handled at this airport.

In 1860, in Michigan City were purchased for $4,500. The first warden, Charles Seely, was the superintendent in charge of construction and was the general handyman. The first building was the Temporary Prison Building which was long and made of red brick. A year after Michigan City Prison opened, prison labor outside of the institution started; inmates were employed at a cooperage firm making barrels, receiving 38 cents a day. The first prison school was started in 1861 where prisoners would learn from the chaplain five days a week. Later the prison started charging 25 cents per visitor to boost prison revenue. At the turn of the century, the prison was increased to twice its size. By 1930 prisoners were placed in two cell houses that contained 230 and 340 cells respectively, and three dormitories, which were considered among the best in the country.Garrett, Paul W., and Austin H. MacCormick. Handbook of American Prisons. New York: National Society of Penal Information, 1929. During that same time period, of farmland were in use by the prison on land leased by the state. A hospital was built in 1943 that was almost . In the late 1950s, arguably one of the finest state recreational facilities was opened at the prison. From 1960 to 1990, only minor renovations were implemented at the State Prison. In 1992, a new type of food door with locking capability for each cell was designed. A year later, the first hot meal was served in the dining room, and in that same year, the inmates received three meals a day for the first time. Soon thereafter, a new riot system was put into effect in Dormitories E and F. Michigan City is known for having housed two famous inmates during its tenure. John Dillinger spent time in Michigan City from 1929 until he was paroled in 1933. A few months after Dillinger made parole, on September 26, ten inmates, including Harry Pierpont, Charles Makley, Russell Clark, and Ed Shouse, escaped thanks to the help of three pistols Dillinger had smuggled into the prison. The other especially famous inmate was D.C. Stephenson. In 1922 Stephenson became one of the most powerful Grand Dragons of the Ku Klux Klan. In 1925 he raped a woman named Madge Oberholtzer. She died a month later from either poison or bite marks from being raped. That same year he was convicted of second degree murder and was sent to the Indiana State Prison for 31 years.Indiana History, Chapter Seven Michigan City had a cemetery for prisoners when the prison first opened in 1860; however, that cemetery no longer exists.

A train kiddie ride A kiddie ride - or kids' ride - is a coin-operated amusement ride for young children. Kiddie rides are commonly available in amusement parks, arcades, malls, hotel game rooms, outside supermarkets and discount department stores. Less commonly, they may also appear in other venues such as restaurants, food courts, grocery shops and auto dealerships. When activated by a coin, a kiddie ride entertains the rider with motion, depending on the ride type (miniature Ferris wheel, miniature carousel, track ride or stationary platform ride). Most rides include sounds and music, and some feature flashing lights, pedals, and buttons. Commercial kiddie rides often use simple but colorful equipment, with the driving mechanism usually hidden under vacuum formed plastic covers. The term \\"kiddie ride\\" can also be used for an amusement park ride that is mainly geared for young children. These rides often do not use coins to run, and are smaller versions of major rides.  History  The kiddie ride was first invented in 1930 by James Otto Hahs of Sikeston, Missouri. Originally called the Hahs Gaited Mechanical Horse, the ride was originally conceived as a Christmas present for his children. However, Hahs soon realized that he has a potential money-maker in his hands and set about commercializing the toy. Initially, he used wooden horses not unlike those found on carousels, and commissioned carousel makers to make the horses. However, he soon found these horses to be heavy, and decided that aluminum would be a better material to sculpt his horses out of. When told it couldn't be done, however, Hahs went ahead and invented a process to form horses out of aluminum. These rides would be manufactured at Hahs Machine Works in Sikeston, Missouri and went on to win several awards, including most original invention of the year 1932. In 1933, Hahs struck a deal with Exhibit Supply Company to distribute his horses, with a 5% cut going to Hahs. When the patent on the ride eventually ran out, Hahs had retired as a wealthy inventor. In 1953, Billboard magazine called it \\"1953's fastest growing business\\". Eventually, the rides changed from aluminum to fiberglass. Developed around the same time, the Link Trainer was initially intended for use as a coin operated entertainment device, in addition to its role as a pilot trainer.  Music  Many very old rides do not feature music; also, some vehicle rides may favor engine sounds instead of music. However, on rides that do feature music, early rides (and cheaper modern rides that imitate more well-known rides) are equipped with simple integrated circuits that continually play back one melody or repeat a set of melodies in sequence. These have evolved in the sense that the earliest musically-enabled rides played back only a single monophonic melody repetitively, while later ones played multiple polyphonic melodies, whilst sometimes including short sound or speech samples. Later rides could also use a tape deck, while more recent rides may have a solid state audio playback device akin to flash-based MP3 players. Usually the music chosen is generic children's songs, while on licensed rides the theme song for the character licensed would be used. However, in rare cases, there are rides that play standard pop music, and for private rides the owner may request a song that has personal relevance to be programmed into the ride. Many modern rides are programmed to play multiple melodies with the music changing each time the ride is used, the logic being to prolong the interest of the child on the ride. However, some modern rides, in particular licensed character ones, are usually programmed to play a single melody or song which is usually the theme song of the character's television show or film. There are also some exceptions where there are licensed rides playing totally unrelated pieces of music or non-licensed rides that play only one particular tune, for example a song about cars on a car-themed ride, the Thomas theme tune on a Thomas the Tank Engine ride, the Postman Pat theme tune on a Postman Pat ride and the Fireman Sam theme tune on a Fireman Sam ride. Certain rides exist that do not emphasize music, but play a running narration or tell a story instead. They usually have generic instrumental music running softly in the background while the story is being told.  Modern rides  Newer, more advanced rides do not usually start as soon as coins are inserted; instead they prompt the rider, parent or guardian to press a start button, so as to allow the rider to seat him/herself comfortably before starting the ride. Often, these rides will also play a message before movement begins and may also play an ending message once the ride ends, to let the rider know that it is safe to disembark. Other safety precautions commonly found in more advanced rides include: *allowing use of the start button to pause the ride, so the rider can reposition themselves or even disembark safely if desired; *safety sensors that detect if anything is potentially obstructing the ride's movement and stop the ride accordingly until the obstruction is removed; *overload sensors that stop the ride from moving if the weight limit on the ride is exceeded; *a slow start/stop action so as not to shock or frighten younger riders. To attract attention, most rides occasionally flash their lights or play a sound, or both, at set intervals, although many older rides, as well as low-cost, or knockoff, rides do not have an attract mode. Some rides may, as mentioned above, narrate a story through sound or using a video monitor, the latter providing limited interaction with the video displayed.

In general, the ride is powered by a low-voltage current passing through the tracks but sometimes the rides are powered by batteries. Most versions of these rides are specifically designed to carry young children, due to the low-voltage used and the size of the ride, although it is possible to find bigger models designed for older children. Track rides are not necessarily restricted to trains; animal track rides that feature horses or frogs have also been documented. In a similar fashion, another type of ride that would classify as a track ride would be one with an elongated base where the figure paces the length of the base, then turns and moves in the opposite direction on reaching its limit. = Miniature Ferris wheel rides = These rides usually have a safety cage - most frequently in the form of a chair (with a built-in seat-belt), or sometimes a vehicle or an animal - which the child sits in. The ride moves in a clockwise or counter-clockwise motion at a moderate speed. The child usually sits facing to the side or facing front. Sometimes features flashing lights. = Carousel rides = Harness racing kiddie ride at the Herschell Carrousel Factory Museum Another common type of kiddie ride is the miniature carousel type. These rides are usually in the form of a small-sized carousel and newer models have the coin-box on the main pillar whereas older units have the coin box on a pole sticking out of the side of the ride. Carousel rides featuring licensed characters (see below) are not common, but do exist. A Thomas the Tank Engine carousel ride is known to exist, as is one from a British television show for children called Play School. Carousel rides featuring the characters from The Wiggles, Bob the Builder, Sesame Street and Hi-5 have also been documented. = Hydraulic rides = More commonly built by European kiddie ride manufacturers like Automatic Toys Modena (ATM) from Italy, hydraulic rides are kiddie rides situated on a hydraulic arm that raise and lower the ride during their activation. Usually, the rider is given limited interaction with the ride in the form of up/down buttons or levers so that the rider can instruct the ride to fly higher or lower, giving the user the impression of some control over their experience. = Base rides = A helicopter ride This kind of ride is perhaps the most common type, an animal or vehicle situated on a vacuum-formed base that moves up-and-down or side-to- side, or even both, when activated; some even move in a slithering-like motion. Usually, rides of this configuration have the motor hidden in the base, although some larger rides have the motor hidden in the ride-on figure instead. One of the most popular rides is a horse ride. Recent developments have included the \\"Pony Express\\" ride, first manufactured by Italian company Cogan. These feature a complicated mechanism that alternates between galloping and trotting motions during the ride, mimicking the movements of a real-life horse. This type of ride has become very popular, that this base has been adapted by both the Spanish manufacturer Falgas for their own version of the \\"Pony Express\\" and Memo Park, another Italian based company, for their own type of Western style horse. Both companies have added unique features to the original Cogan version of the ride, Falgas adds horse sounds to the soundtrack whilst a more innovative function on the Memo Park version is the use of rider interactivity, in where if the rider pulls back on the reins, the horse stops for a few seconds before continuing to either gallop or trot depending at what pace it is travelling at when the reins are pulled. Another one of the most popular rides is the Kiddie Coaster. First manufactured by Amutec in 2000 and in 2002 by ICE, this ride simulates one of two different roller coasters. The ICE version simulates Blue Streak and Gemini while the Amutec version simulates two different Six Flags coasters. The ICE version is one of the most common kiddie rides that can be found in malls and shopping outlets. = Free movement (bumper car-like) rides = These kinds of rides are usually in the form of animals or vehicles. These are most common in Asia, particularly China. Unlike a real bumper car ride commonly found at funfairs, the coin- operated variant uses batteries instead of drawing electricity off of an overhead mesh, and one can ride it anytime, instead of having to wait for the operator to start the ride for them. = Teeter totter rides = These rides are generally teeter totters for one person. An inanimate figure typically sits at the opposite end of the ride. The rides moves on a gentle up-and-down motion mimicking that of a standard teeter-totter. Jolly Roger Rides has made three of these: one featuring Mr. Bump from The Mr. Men Show, one featuring the Pink Panther and one featuring Mr. Blobby. = Video-game hybrids = These rides are a hybrid of kiddie ride and arcade video games. The rides usually incorporate a video display and, while the motion is synchronized to the events happening on the screen, the ride will start and end following the events on the screen. The ride is usually interactive and there are push- buttons to allow the rider to interact with the on-screen actions. These rides should not be mistaken for simulators, which reproduce the action of a video game withpout offering further interactivity. Furthermore, the video-game hybrid is time-based and ends at a pre-determined time, regardless of the actions of the user. An example of a hybrid ride would be the Waku Waku Sonic Patrol Car ride and other waku-waku and wanpaku series of rides released by Sega Japan. Another example is a Mario Kart ride manufactured by OMC Electronics Ltd. of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire and licensed to Nintendo which features Mario climbing on the back of the kid's seat and plays the DIC Super Mario World theme song when it is ridden.  Character rides  In many cases, kiddie rides in the likes of well-known copyrighted characters or objects from films or television shows can also be found, usually at bigger shopping malls that can afford them due to the higher purchasing costs. A classic example would be the Batmobile ride mentioned earlier. One model looks like a miniature Batmobile on a stand, and occasionally flashes lights and plays a short tune from a Batman movie at set intervals, Another manufactured by Jolly Roger Ltd, a Garfield car ride, Which include Garfield wearing the hat and sitting on the car with car horn sound. Another example of a character kiddie ride would be a Clifford the Big Red Dog kiddie ride, manufactured by Jolly Roger Ltd of the United Kingdom and licensed by Scholastic UK. The ride costs around US$5000 purchased new. It talks in a girl's voice (presumably the voice of Emily Elizabeth) and plays the theme song from the PBS Kids TV series when it is ridden. A button to make Clifford bark also exists on the ride. A Teletubbies Tubbytronic Super Dome ride was manufactured by Amutec of Mablethorpe. It features Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa & Po on a hill and has 16 Tubbytronic sounds (made in 1999) (another version has Noo-Noo with two phrases) Dipsy has got his hat and a rabbit stands on the hill, Jolly Roger Ltd made a carousel, it features the Teletubbies, plays the theme song, and a push button to hear Teletubbies sounds, Another is a Bob the Builder ride, which features Bob climbing onto Scoop with 4 sounds (made in 1998) (another version has got Roley with 3 phrases (made in 2003), the Scoop version has Pilchard in his shovel). Also, Merkur Kids, the German manufacturer has made a Cars ride where it features Lightning McQueen with brake and accelerate pedals, a green button (does a horn) and a yellow button (to hear Luigi say \\"You are a famous race car, a real race car\\", while they also made another Lightning McQueen ride but in Dinoco, and Mater. In 2015, Kiddy Rides UK manufactured a SpongeBob SquarePants kiddie ride based on the Krabby Patty Wagon from The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie ( which was released in 2004). This ride has SpongeBob seated next to the \\"rider's seat\\", and his pet snail Gary rides on the back of the model. This SpongeBob-themed ride also includes a screen displaying the lyrics to the SpongeBob SquarePants theme song. The words to the theme don't play, instead they have to be sung out by whoever rides it (this is known as sing-along). The attract mode is also the SpongeBob theme, and each of the 3 buttons on the ride plays a sound effect: a horn, bubble noises (those are commonly used in transitions from a scene to another in SpongeBob), and a dolphin noise. Thomas the Tank Engine has been made as a kiddie ride by R.G. Mitchell with 4 push buttons which do \\"You're a really useful engine!\\" (Thomas: blue), \\"I need you to help the other engines\\" (Sir Topham Hatt: yellow), a whistle sound (James: red) and a steam sound (Percy: green). There is also a mini version of the aforementioned ride for places that don't have enough space. Jolly Roger Rides of the UK also made him as another ride, also with a video available, plays the theme tune, and a red push button to blow Thomas' whistle. A Barney & Friends ride was manufactured by Fun2Learn. This features Barney sitting on a train and has 7 push button sounds \\"A is for Alphabet! Let’s sing it together! A-B-C-D-E-F-G, H-I-J-K-L-M- N-O-P, Q-R-S, T-U-V, W-X, Y-&-Z\\" (A is for Alphabet:) \\"Hi there, I’m Barney, what’s your name?\\" (B is for Barney:) \\"Choo Choo!\\" (C is for Choo Choo, The sounds on this train:) a whistle sound (1 whistle:) \\"Tickets please, Tickets please!\\" (2 tickets:) a bell sound (3 bells:) Another Barney Tractor ride, plays Old Macdonald Had A Farm, and a red push button to hear Barney. Jolly Roger Rides is also known for making other licensed kiddie rides, including: a fire truck and an airplane featuring Woody Woodpecker and Chilly Willy, a seesaw, train and police van featuring the Pink Panther and Inspector Clouseau, and a sailboat featuring Popeye. Character rides costs much more than generic rides when purchased new. The higher cost stems from the royalty of the voice samples and theme song as well as character licensing fees. Knockoff rides that feature figures that look like those of famous cartoon characters exist. commonly knocked off characters include: Pikachu from Pokémon, Disney's Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse, Despicable Me's Minions and Hello Kitty. They are cheaper than real licensed rides, and are typically found at smaller establishments. However, as the name suggests, they are not licensed, and in certain areas with high intellectual property rights recognition, purchasers of knockoff rides can potentially get themselves entangled with legal complications. Furthermore, the ride figure might not be designed to look as close to a licensed character compared to genuinely licensed rides, possibly resulting in diminished recognition. Occasionally, there are some countries where knockoff characters are found in fairground rides. These feature paint jobs of popular characters that are featured on the rides without a license from their respective owners. Some vehicles in said rides can also be based on popular cartoon characters, including Disney's Mickey Mouse and Goofy, Looney Tunes' Bugs Bunny, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Bart Simpson from The Simpsons.  Kiddie rides and personal use  While kiddie rides are primarily used to garner extra income for commercial areas like shopping malls, supermarkets and amusement centers, like classic arcade game machines they are becoming increasingly common in homes in many developed countries, usually bought by game collectors and families. This renaissance is being led by Denver-based Kiddie Rides USA, and has received coverage in many magazines including Time, Fortune, United Airline's Hemispheres, and on CNBC. Many of the rides are ex-location units which have been written off by the original owner, usually to make way for newer games or rides, and bought for a fraction of what they would cost brand new, either directly from the previous owner or on online auction sites like eBay.  Free play  Usually, older rides would be slightly modified; the coin mechanism is replaced by a push button switch to allow for free play, while more sophisticated rides that have a mode switch would be set permanently to free play.

Many areas of Utah were paralyzed by up to 4 feet (1.2 m) of snow. The Wasatch Front from the Salt Lake Valley northward saw generally 1–3 feet of snow (30-90 cm), with up to four feet on the benches, while the surrounding mountains generally saw 5–7 feet of snow (1.5–2 m), with up to nine feet in some areas. The storm even reached southern Utah with moderate snow amounts, with a few inches in some low-lying valley locations. At least five deaths were attributed to the heavy snow. Clearing a driveway during the storm. The Salt Lake City airport saw 21.9 inches (55.6 cm) of snow. The 19.4 inches (49.3 cm) of snow that fell during December 25-28, in the first wave of the storm, ranks as the 5th-largest storm in Salt Lake City history. The most snow along the Wasatch Front was found on the Layton bench in Davis County, which saw 51 inches (130 cm). Davis and Weber Counties were perhaps the hardest-hit areas, with even valley locations recording over 2 and as much as 3 feet (60–90 cm) in places. Bountiful, typically one of the areas hardest hit by lake-effect snows, saw 32 inches (81 cm), Clearfield 28 in (71 cm), and Ogden 36 in (91 cm). The storm also affected areas further north, including Brigham City with 19 inches (48 cm) and Logan with 18 inches. Areas along the southern Wasatch Front saw less snow, with just six inches (15 cm) in Provo, although Spanish Fork saw 17 inches (43 cm), due to lake effect snows from Utah Lake, which Spanish Fork is frequently in the path of. The Wasatch Back also saw significant amounts of snow, with 50 inches (130 cm) in Summit Park, near the summit of Parley's Canyon and just a few miles northwest of Park City. The Wasatch Mountains saw phenomenal, near-record amounts of snow. Farmington Canyon in Davis County saw the most snow of any place in the storm, with 103 inches (262 cm) of snow. The ski resorts of Salt Lake County saw several feet of snow as well, with some skiers reporting \\"epic ski conditions.\\" Alta saw 87 inches (221 cm) of snow, Snowbird had 82 inches (208 cm), Brighton 66 inches (168 cm), and Nordic Valley 51 inches (130 cm). Unusual for such a storm, this massive snowstorm even penetrated into southern Utah, dropping moderate amounts across the south. The Brian Head ski resort saw 40 inches (102 cm) to top off mountain locations, while even low valley locations saw snow, including Kanab with seven inches (18 cm), and Hurricane with two inches (5 cm), just a few hundred feet (~100 m) higher and a few miles east of Saint George. Overall, five people were killed in the storm. An avalanche on the east side of Mount Timpanogos killed three snowboarders on December 26, while traffic accidents killed two people on December 28. In addition, at least 1,000,000 people along the Wasatch Front lost power just on the first day of the storm, and at least 2,000 traffic accidents were reported (most of them along the Wasatch Front). In total, the storm caused at least $3,820,000 in damage. Utah Power (now Rocky Mountain Power) faced criticism from residents and even the Salt Lake City council on the speed and effectiveness of restoring power to the area after more than 300 customers were still without power 20 days after the storm.

She was portrayed by Jenny Platt making her first on-screen appearance on 8 October 2004 and remained until 29 February 2008. Platt returned for one episode on 24 April 2011. Storylines Violet arrives on the Street on in October 2004, as a barmaid in the Rovers Return Inn. A former pupil of Ken Barlow (William Roache) when he was a teacher at Weatherfield Comprehensive, she addresses him as \\"Sir\\" during her time on the Street. Violet befriends neighbour Katy Harris (Lucy-Jo Hudson) and is good friends with Sean Tully (Antony Cotton), whom she knew before moving to Coronation Street. Violet begins a relationship with Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas), whose mother Eileen (Sue Cleaver) finds Violet a pleasant young woman. After some unease by Violet, who states that she had left home at a young age to live with an older, dominant man, she moves into 11 Coronation Street with Jason. They break up after Violet is seduced by Charlie Stubbs, but reunite. The relationship breaks up when Jason has an affair with Sarah-Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien). Jason proposes to Violet but she turns him down. Violet soon begins dating Jamie Baldwin (Rupert Hill). She moves in with him but after a while she starts to doubt Jamie's loyalties in September 2006, when he begins spending more time with Sean, than her and worries that Jamie is interested in Sean, who is gay. Violet asks Sean to find out if Jamie is gay but Sean discovers that Jamie is having an affair with his stepmother Frankie (Debra Stephenson). Violet discovers she is pregnant in December with Jamie's baby and tells him but is shocked and disgusted when he confesses the truth about his affair with Frankie and is further upset when she discovers Sean's knowledge of the affair. Violet suffers an ectopic pregnancy on New Years Day 2007, and has to have emergency surgery to remove her Fallopian tube and the baby. She is then told that she has a reduced chance of conceiving. While drunk, Violet and Sean make a pact - if they are both single and childless by 30, they would have a child together. Violet ponders over this, and agrees to try for a child together immediately, due to Violet's reduced fertility. In July 2007, Violet finds out she is expecting Sean's baby. When Violet tells Sean, he is thrilled that she is going to be a mother. Violet makes him keep it secret for the first 12 weeks but Sean is so excited about Violet's pregnancy, he tells Jamie. Violet is angry and upset when she finds out. Sean tricks his boyfriend - sonographer Marcus Dent (Charlie Condou) - into telling him that Violet is expecting a baby boy. He wants to know the sex of the baby but Violet doesn't. He tells Jason and Jamie about Violet expecting a boy and Jason accidentally lets slip to Violet. She is furious with Sean for betraying her and making her feel worthless. Sean soon discovers that Violet is planning to bring up their baby without him, and when he confronts her about being pushed out, she tells him that she sees him as the donor, not the father. Upset, he warns Violet that he will take legal action, and she walks out in a rage. Violet and Sean later apologize to one another and the friendship is rekindled. Violet reunites with Jamie shortly after attending his mother Carol's wedding in Birmingham as his date. After restarting the relationship, they move in together and both agree to bring up the baby together. Violet goes into labour on 22 February 2008 while in Rovers with Sean by her side and names her newborn son Dylan. She is unhappy about the situation as Jamie is away, moving some of their belongings down to London. Sean quickly bonds with Dylan and is ecstatic to be a dad but Violet, however, is sad that Sean has bonded with the baby since she can't take Dylan away from him. The following week Violet proposes and Jamie accepts straight away and they prepare to leave Manchester but Violet's sister Lauren (Lucy Evans) alerts Sean after she sees Jamie loading up the car. Sean tries to stop Violet but she and Jamie speed away. Sean phone Violet but she throws her mobile out of the car, making sure Sean cannot contact them. Two years later, Sean decides that he wants to make contact with his Dylan and set out to do so by making contact with Violet via social networking site Facescene, similar to Facebook. Knowing that Violet does not want any contact with him, he sets up a page under Liz McDonald's (Beverley Callard) name and asks her to e-mail some pictures of Dylan, who is now two. Violet does so and confesses to 'Liz' that she feels bad for alienating Sean, to which 'Liz' berates Violet for doing so. Upset, Violet rings The Rovers, demanding answers from Liz. Liz discovers Sean's deception and fires him, but rehires him when she realizes how upset and desperate he was to see his son and then phones Violet back, asking her to let Sean see Dylan to which she accepts. Sean heads down to London in April 2011 to visit Dylan and discovers Violet and Jamie arguing and he and Marcus who have recently reconciled, take Dylan out for the day and when they return they witness Jamie leaving in a Taxi. They try to comfort Violet but she is homophobic towards Sean and they leave. Violet is later injured in a crash and is hospitalized with back problems and her grandmother rings Sean and asks him to look after Dylan. Sean is worried at first but is able to connect with him. After several months, Violet calls Sean, telling him she is ready to have Dylan back and he is reluctant, however she agrees he and Marcus can visit him anytime they want. Creation and development =Background= Violet first appeared on 8 October 2004 and the character was originally going to be called Julie, Platt stated filming in August 2004. In late 2004, it was also claimed that Violet would reveal to her new love interest Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) that she was HIV positive, but for unknown reasons, this storyline never went through. In 2007, Sunday Newspaper The People reported that Platt had quit the serial. However, the Serial's producers denied the reports and a spokesperson confirmed on Digital Spy that she had signed a new one-year contract taking her through to March 2008. Platt returned to the serial for one episode in 2011. =Pregnancy= In one storyline, Violet falls pregnant to Jamie Baldwin. Platt commented on the way she handled the delicate storyline offscreen stating: \\"Obviously, I wanted to find out about it. Violet actually doesn't know anything about it - she just wakes up in the hospital and is told about it, so I kind of didn't need it. It wasn't like I got diagnosed and had to live with it for a while. By the time I've woken up everything's gone. But, just for my own interest, I did, I looked into it and found out a bit about it. I looked at the NHS site to find out what the symptoms would be, and how common it is, all that kind of stuff.\\" =Lesbian Storyline= After the character had left the show it was later revealed that the soap's bosses had been on the look out for a lesbian character since 2004, the year that the character entered the series. The original intentions were revealed for the character, that were to make her the soaps first lesbian character in the shows history. Due to the popularity of her two relationships within the character's early storylines the idea was scrapped at the last minute. An ITV insider told the News of the World on July 2008: \\"Executives want to create a soap which is representative of society in 2008 and they are acutely aware they need more gay characters. They went on: \\"It does seem ridiculous it (lesbianism) has never been explored on Corrie but that's all about to change.\\" Later it was revealed that the producers had shifted the plans, which they had once put onto Platt's character, onto fellow character Sophie Webster.

If the product is made exclusively at a single distillery (along with other restrictions), it is typically called a single malt whisky. Although malt whisky can be made using other malted grains besides barley, those versions are not called malt whisky without specifying the grain, such as rye malt whisky or buckwheat malt whisky. Laws The exact definitions of \\"malt whisky\\" and \\"single malt whisky\\" and the restrictions governing their production vary according to regulations established by different jurisdictions for marketing whisky. For example, Scotch whisky regulationsThe Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009, The National Archives, 2009.The Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009: Guidance for Producers and Bottlers , Scotch Whisky Association, February 12, 2009. require malt whisky to be made in pot stills using water and malted barley without the addition of any other grains or cereals, and the whisky must be aged for at least three years in oak casks. The use of new barrels is not required. Caramel coloring can be added, but no other additives are allowed. Irish whiskey regulations are almost identical to Scotch regulations. Malt whiskey must be distilled in a pot still from a mash of 100% malted barley, which may be peated or unpeated in character, although unpeated malt is typically used. All Irish whiskeys must be matured for at least three years in wooden casks (which may have been previously used) and must contain a minimum of 40% alcohol by volume, with caramel coloring as the only allowed additive. Single pot still whiskey, while also being primarily made from malted barley, is not called malt whisky because it contains unmalted barley. It is considered a separate category under Irish regulations. In the United States Code of Federal Regulations, the Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits define a \\"malt whisky\\" as a whisky produced at an alcohol by volume (ABV) level not exceeding 80% from a fermented mash of not less than 51% malted barley grain that is stored for aging in charred new oak containers at less than 62.5% ABV. If such a whisky has been aged for at least two years, contains no added coloring and flavoring, and has not been blended with neutral spirits or other types of whisky, the adjective \\"straight\\" can be applied, as in straight malt whisky. A blended whisky that contains at least 51% straight malt whisky may be labelled as blended malt whisky or malt whiskey – a blend. Canadian whisky regulations\\"Canadian Food and Drug Regulations (C.R.C., c. 870) – Malt Whisky (B.02.013)\\". (Access date March 25, 2015.) allow the addition of flavoring agents as well as caramel coloring. There is no maximum limit on the alcohol level of the distillation or aging for Canadian whisky, so the distillate may be close to neutral before aging. Like the regulations for the aging of Irish and Scotch whisky, the aging requirement for Canadian whisky is three years, and the use of new barrels is not required.

In response, critics accused him of being \\"arrogant\\", having \\"vile manners\\", and \\"never (having) done a stroke (of work)\\".Master of Fitzwilliam attacks \\"Class War\\" view of Cambridge Publications  * Maupassant: Pierre et Jean (1984) * Zola and the Craft of Fiction (ed 1990) * Artistic Relations, Literature and the Visual Arts in Nineteenth-Century France (ed 1994) * Editions of novels by Guy de Maupassant (2001) and by Émile Zola (1995, 2000, 2001) See also * Picture of Robert Lethbridge receiving the Ordre des Palmes Académiques * List of Masters of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge References 1947 births Living people Educators from New York City Alumni of the University of Kent McMaster University alumni Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge Fellows of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge Academics of the University of Cambridge Academics of Royal Holloway, University of London Masters of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge Chevaliers of the Ordre des Palmes Académiques ","title":"Robert Lethbridge"},{"id":"4301459","text":"The Satellite Awards are annual awards given by the International Press Academy that are commonly noted in entertainment industry journals and blogs.

These reforms were efforts to resolve perceived problems in military, economic, agricultural, financial and religious systems.Hall, John Whitney et al. (1991). Early Modern Japan: The Cambridge History of Japan, p. 21. The changes were intended to address problems in local politics, but they were also addressed more broadly to \\"domestic uneasiness.\\" The perceived need for change led to the arrest of many prominent political figures and writers. The reforms became a precursor of reforms initiated after the Meiji Restoration two decades later. The Tenpō Reforms were mostly instituted by Mizuno Tadakuni. Notably, the restrictions on entertainment were enforced solely by him and when he was removed from government in 1845, they ceased to be enforced. New coinage was issued; and commodity price controls were lifted. Immigration to Edo was prohibited and the formation of societies was also banned. Rangaku (Dutch Learning) was banned. An annual calendar ( nenjū gyōji) was set up during this period to bring order to Japanese society. Families were required to register themselves at the nearest Shinto shrine annually on the 16th of the first and seventh months. A Shinto festival (muramura jingi), meeting (jingi kasihū) or pilgrimage (muramura kamimōde) was scheduled once a month. The popular bon festival was rewritten as Sensosai, the Ancestor Festival, and held twice a year. Buddhism was written out of this religious calendar; the government revoked its support for existing Buddhist institutions.Ketelaar, James Edward. (1990). Of Heretics and Martyrs in Meiji Japan: Buddhism and Its Persecution, pp. 52–53. This reform movement was accompanied by three others during the Edo period, the Kyōhō reforms (1716–1736), the Kansei reforms of the 1790s and the Keiō Reforms, 1866–1867.Traugott, Mark. (1995).

Biographical Directory of the United States Congress In 1977 he was convicted of accepting bribes from the Tandy Corporation in his previous job as Orange County, California assessor. Biography Hinshaw was born in Dexter, Missouri and attended public schools in Michigan and Los Angeles, California. He was in the Navy in World War II from 1942 to 1945. He received a B.S. degree from the University of Southern California in 1950 and attended the USC Law School. Hinshaw worked for 10 years for the California State Board of Equalization and five years for the Los Angeles County Assessor's Office. He entered politics as the Assessor of Orange County, California, serving from 1965 to 1972. This had been a controversial office and there had been calls from Orange County grand juries to change the extremely lenient treatment given to large landowners. This was Hinshaw's pledge, which he achieved. Hinshaw was convicted of accepting bribes while Assessor of Orange County. He served 8 months in prison in 1977. In 1972 Hinshaw entered the Republican primary for California's 39th Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives. The district, which had been the 35th District prior to redistricting, was represented by outspoken conservative John G. Schmitz. Hinshaw, considered a moderate Republican by Orange County standards, was personally recruited by President Richard Nixon, whose home in San Clemente was in the district after Schmitz suggested that Nixon should not have returned from his 1972 visit to China. Hinshaw scored a considerable upset in the Republican primary election, narrowly defeating Schmitz by 2.7 percentage points. This was tantamount to election in what has long been considered the most Republican district in California. Hinshaw was reelected in 1974 but was defeated in the 1976 primary by State Assemblyman Robert Badham, who won the general election. Hinshaw died on January 21, 2016 at the age of 92.Andrew J.

The largest of these buildings was Building 2, which was destroyed by fire in late December 2005. Plans for the reconstruction of Building 2, which held the majority of the market's fabric shops, are still being made. There are four other building complexes, and two other large shopping areas.

The film's plot revolves around a disgruntled employee who sets fire to an oil refinery, setting off a blaze which engulfs an entire city. People try to either fight the fire or flee as it spreads throughout the city. The film was shot in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, although the name of the city is not mentioned in the film. Plot In an unnamed Midwestern U.S. city, the corrupt mayor William Dudley has allowed an oil refinery to be built right in the center of town, far from any river, lake or reservoir. On one typically hot summer day, Herman Stover, a dangerously disturbed employee at the works, has been denied an expected promotion and in addition, finds himself fired. He then decides to take his revenge against the works by opening the valves to the storage vats and their interconnecting pipes, flooding the area and sewers with gasoline and chemicals. It doesn't take long for this act of petty vandalism to start a fire, which starts a chain reaction that causes massive explosions at the refinery, destroying it and spreading a mushroom-cloud of flame that soon engulfs the entire metropolis. The drama focuses on a newly built hospital which, like the refinery and all civic buildings that went up during the mayor's crooked administration, is shoddily built and poorly equipped. There, head doctor Frank Whitman and his staff treat thousands of casualties from the fire while the city fire chief Risley keeps in constant contact with the fire companies fighting a losing battle against the fires, and Maggie Grayson, an alcoholic reporter, sees it as her chance to make it nationwide with her coverage of the story of the \\"city on fire\\". A major subplot of the film involves Diana Brockhurst-Lautrec, a wealthy socialite who is currently and secretly involved with Mayor Dudley to further advance her rank up the social circles and who also finds herself, along with the mayor, at the hospital assisting the head nurse Andrea Harper with treating the large number of casualties. The womanizing Dr. Whitman also becomes smitten with Diana after meeting her during the hospital's dedication ceremony prior to the fire. Herman Stover also arrives at the hospital having left the refinery before the explosion to stalk Diana, having known her since attending high school. No one ever finds out that Stover is the one responsible for the citywide fire, and on top of that, Stover is not sane enough to understand or regret his actions. When the hospital becomes surrounded by the fire, Chief Risley orders his son, Harrison, assemble a fire company to create a \\"water tunnel\\" composing of firemen creating a channel across a burning street to evacuate the hospital. Despite some casualties of the hospital staff and patients, the evacuation is successful. Stover is one of the casualties when, distraught and in a daze after Diana rejects him, is killed by falling debris from a building. Nurse Harper is also killed when she attempts to rescue Stover. Diana, Mayor Dudley, and Dr. Whitman are the last ones to make it out of the hospital. The final scene is set the following day at a quarry outside the city which is set up as a makeshift camp for the thousands of people rendered homeless by the fire as it is finally brought under control. There, Dr. Whitman and Diana acknowledge their love for each other, while Mayor Dudley gives a press statement about his actions and of his intention now to run for governor. Maggie Grayson, still reporting from the studio, signs off her broadcast and leaves with her assistant Jimbo on a date for assisting her throughout her coverage. The final scene shows Chief Risley leaving his headquarters with his staff telling them that it takes only one man to set fire and destroy a city. Cast Production The film required several urban blocks that could be set on fire which led to the production team to search for appropriate locations to shoot, including Atlanta, Edmonton, St. Louis, and Cincinnati. Montreal was eventually chosen to represent the fictional American city in the film. Principal photography was scheduled to begin 10 August 1978 and became one of the largest film sets in Canada to that date, costing approximately $400,000. The shoot was constructed in the east end of the city and involved 45,000 gallons of fuel required to set it ablaze during filming.. Release City on Fire was first shown in Paris on July 11, 1979. It was later distributed in Canada by Astral Films, showing in Montreal on Astral Films on 29 August 1979. It opened in United States on 31 August 1979. Reception From a contemporary review, Gilbert Adair of the Monthly Film Bulletin declared that \\"'dull' as criticism, scarcely does justice to the ludicrous contrivance of this disaster movie\\" and that \\"its idiocy is best exemplified by the scene in which, as the crooked mayor and the jet-setting benefactress of a hospital resolve their amours differences, the camera focuses on the beatific expression of an elderly patient who has finally managed to relieve himself into a bedpan.\\" See also *List of firefighting films References =Sources= *  External links   = Mystery Science Theater 3000 = Episode guide: K16- City on Fire 1979 films 1970s disaster films 1979 action films American films American action films American disaster films Canadian action films Canadian films Canadian disaster films Embassy Pictures films Films about arson Films shot in Montreal Films about firefighting ","title":"City on Fire (1979 film)"},{"id":"4301559","text":"MythQuest is a Canadian television series that originally aired on PBS in 2001.

They become characters in the myths, and strive to keep the myth to its normal progression; a difficult task when confronted by Gorgos, a trickster god who appears in each myth to try to change it. Alex's initial journey into the Cyber Museum is an accident, but soon they both begin searching for their father within the myths. As the series progresses, they realize that their search is much more important than they first realized, as Gorgos is bent on wiping out entire cultures by corrupting their mythologies.

It is a variant of dynamic recrystallization. The basic mechanism is that during deformation the grains will be increasingly flattened until the boundaries on each side are separated by only a small distance. The deformation is accompanied by the serration of the grain boundaries due to surface tension effects where they are in contact with low-angle grain boundaries belonging to sub-grains. Eventually the points of the serrations will come into contact. Since the contacting boundaries are defects of opposite 'sign' they are able to annihilate and so reduce the total energy in the system. In effect the grain will pinch in two new grains. The grain size is known to decrease as the applied stress is increased. However, high stresses require a high strain rate and at some point statically recrystallized grains will begin to nucleate and consume the GDRX microstructure. There are features that are unique to GDRX: * The recrystallisation spreads throughout the specimen over a strain range (0.5-1 in Al-Mg-Mn alloys) without any change in flow stress. This is in contrast to discontinuous mechanisms where the flow stress normally decreases by ~25% as the recrystallized grains form. * GDRX results in grains that are around 3 times the sub-grain size. Statically recrystallized grains are normally 20-30 times the sub-grain size.

It can be viewed as an intramolecular disproportionation reaction, as one carbon center is oxidized while the other is reduced. Scheme 1. Benzilic acid rearrangement The reaction has been shown to work in aromatic, semi-aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic substrates. The reaction works best when the ketone functional groups have no adjacent enolizable protons, as this allows aldol condensation to compete. The reaction is formally a ring contraction when used on cyclic diketones. It has been found that aryl groups more readily migrate than alkyl groups, and that aryl groups with electron-withdrawing groups migrate the fastest.  Reaction mechanism  The reaction is a representative of 1,2-rearrangements. The long- established reaction mechanism was first proposed in its entirety by Christopher Kelk Ingold, and has been updated with in silico data as outlined below. The reaction is second order overall in terms of rate, being first order in diketone and first order in base. A hydroxide anion attacks one of the ketone groups in 1 in a nucleophilic addition to form the alkoxide 2. The next step requires a bond rotation to conformer 3 which places the migrating group R in position for attack on the second carbonyl group. In a concerted step, the migrating R group attacks the α-carbonyl group forming another alkoxide with concomitant formation of a keto-group at the other carbon. This migration step is rate-determining. This sequence resembles a nucleophilic acyl substitution. Calculations show that when R is methyl the charge build-up on this group in the transition state can be as high as 0.22 and that the methyl group is positioned between the central carbon carbon bond! center 500x500px The carboxylic acid in intermediate 4 is less basic than the alkoxide and therefore reversible proton transfer takes place favoring intermediate 5 which is protonated on acidic workup to the final α-hydroxy–carboxylic acid 6. Calculations show that an accurate description of the reaction sequence is possible with the participation of 4 water molecules taking responsibility for the stabilization of charge buildup. They also provide a shuttle for the efficient transfer of one proton in the formation of intermediate 5. The above mechanism is consistent with all available experimental evidence. The equilibrium between species 1 and 2 is supported by 18O Isotopic labeling experiments. In deuterated water, carbonyl oxygen exchange occurs much faster than the rearrangement, indicating that the first equilibrium is not the rate-determining step. Further experiments showed a larger relative rate in a deuterated solvent system compared to a non- deuterated solvent system of otherwise identical composition. This was explained as being due to the greater relative basicity of the deuterated hydroxide anion compared to the normal hydroxide anion, and was used to indicate that hydrogen migration did not occur in the rate determining step of the reaction. This ruled out a concerted mechanism for the reaction, as hydrogen transfer would occur in the rate determining step. Variations = Benzilic ester rearrangement = This reaction is identical to the normal benzilic acid rearrangement, except that an alkoxide or an amide anion is used in place of a hydroxide ion. The alkoxide used should not be easily oxidizable (such as potassium ethoxide) as this favors the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction pathway as a side reaction. The reaction is second order overall in terms of rate, being first order in terms of alkoxide and first order in terms of diketone. The product of the reaction is an α-hydroxy–ester or an α-hydroxy-amide. = Alpha-ketol rearrangement = The alpha-ketol rearrangement is an interconversion of a hydroxyl alpha to a carbonyl to the complementary carbonyl and hydroxyl groups, with migration of a substituent. It is mechanistically equivalent to the benzyllic acid rearrangement at the point after the nucleophile attacks the 1,2-dicarbonyl. This variation of the reaction has been known to occur in many substrates bearing the acyloin functional group. The picture below shows the ring expansion of a cyclopentane to a cyclohexane ring as an example reaction.Über Steroide und Sexualhormone. 48. Mitteilung.

Route 35 starts at the New York state line, where the road continues as New York State Route 35, and ends at U.S. Route 7. The road is often used as an alternative to the congested Route 7. Originally part of New England Route 3 in the 1920s, Route 35 was designated in 1932. Route description NY 35 approaching the CT state line, where CT 35 begins in the town of Ridgefield Route 35 begins at the New York state line (where it continues west as NY 35) and heads east along South Salem Road and West Lane until Route 33 in downtown Ridgefield, about east of the state line. It then turns north along Main Street, taking over Route 33. After downtown Ridgefield, Route 35 turns right on Danbury Road while Route 116 begins straight ahead. Route 35 then proceeds in a northeast direction until it meets U.S. Route 7 about later. Danbury Road continues as US 7.ConnDOT map of Ridgefield History Modern Danbury Road in Ridgefield and Sugar Hollow Road in Danbury was first laid out as a turnpike in 1801 by the Danbury and Ridgefield Turnpike Corporation. The turnpike connected Ridgefield center and downtown Danbury. Tolls continued to be collected on the road until 1860 when the charter of the corporation was repealed. Route 35 was originally part of New England Route 3 (designated in 1922), which was part of the main route connecting New York City and Hartford via Bedford and Danbury. Most of Route 3 became co-signed as U.S. Route 6 east of Danbury in 1927. A small portion south of Danbury was also assigned as part of U.S. Route 7 about a year later. In the 1932 state highway renumbering, the New England road numbering system was abandoned and the remaining section of old Route 3 west of US 7 was then designated as Route 35. Originally, Route 35 used West Lane from the state line to Main Street. This was realigned by 1934 to use South Salem Road (the modern alignment) instead. The original 35 became Route 35A. In 1963, this was renumbered as unsigned State Road 835. Around 1942, New York designated the continuation across the state line as New York State Route 35, creating a unified route from Peekskill to Ridgefield.

Early life He was born in Montreal, Quebec, and attended Lower Canada College in Montreal. He studied creative writing at Concordia University under noted Canadian poet Deborah Eibel, and earned his BA magna cum laude in Communication Studies from Concordia in 1978. While a student, he took a six-week seminar with Jean-Luc Godard and worked as director John Huston's personal assistant during the filming of Angela. He began his career as a journalist covering the Yom Kippur War as a cameraman. He later worked as a reporter, editor and film critic for various Canadian publications, and made documentary films at the National Film Board of Canada. In 1980, he moved to Los Angeles, where he collaborated with cult film director Monte Hellman on a number of film projects. He later worked for a variety of film producers including Francis Coppola, Lawrence Gordon, Steve Tisch, Michael Gruskoff and Mace Neufeld. In 1988, he helped adapt Miguel Pinero's play Midnight Moon at the Greasy Spoon for KCRW radio, starring Ed Asner and Peter Falk. In 1989 he wrote his first television project, the movie of the week Out on the Edge which won the American Psychological Association Award of Excellence. This led to writing assignments on other movies of the week and for the series Star Trek: The Next Generation, Capital News, Veronica Clare and Nasty Boys. Career Balcer is noted for writing and showrunning the television series Law & Order, and for creating and showrunning its spin- off series Law & Order: Criminal Intent. He was hired as staff writer on Law & Order's first season in 1990, becoming showrunner in the show's seventh season in 1996. Balcer won an Emmy in 1997 as Showrunner and Executive Producer of Law & Order. He has also won a Peabody Award, a Writers Guild of America Award, four Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America (three for his writing for Law & Order, and a fourth for Law & Order: Criminal Intent), a Career Award from the Reims International Television Festival, and a Career Angie Award from the International Mystery Writers Festival. His work has been recognized outside the entertainment community: in 1999 and 2000, he received the Silver Gavel Award from the American Bar Association for his Law & Order episodes \\"DWB\\" and \\"Hate\\"; in 2004, he received a Margaret Sanger Award from Planned Parenthood for his Law & Order: Criminal Intent episode \\"The Third Horseman\\"; in 2010, he received the Champion of Justice award from the Washington-based Alliance for Justice, for his work on the Law & Order episode \\"Memo from the Dark Side\\". In 2004, he was awarded the Alumnus of the Year from Concordia University. On November 17, 2008, he received an honorary Doctorate of Laws (LLD) from Concordia at their fall convocation and delivered the Commencement Address. Balcer has received additional recognitions, including being commissioned a Kentucky Colonel by Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear in 2008; in the Season Five episode of The Sopranos, \\"In Camelot\\", Chris's writing friend JT (played by Tim Daly) tells Chris that he has a meeting with René Balcer, explaining that Balcer is \\"Dick Wolf's right-hand man!\\" Balcer's altercation with a Fox employee during the Writers Guild strike on January 10, 2008 became the subject of a joke by David Letterman during his monologue on January 12, 2008. At the North Dakota Museum of Art, Balcer's Law & Order episodes are played in a continuous loop in the installation Barton Benes Period Room: 21st Century Artist Studio. In October 2009, Balcer came under attack by right-wing bloggers for an episode of Law & Order about the Bush Administration's Enhanced Interrogation policy. Writing in Breitbart, former Law & Order star Michael Moriarty accused Balcer of being a \\"Marxist agent provocateur.\\" Balcer said of the attacks, \\"What many of these critics fail to realize is that Law & Order has always been an equal-opportunity offender, and if a Democratic administration had implemented this despicable (torture) policy, our show would have taken them to task for it.\\" Balcer was showrunner for Law & Order: Criminal Intent through the fifth season. In March 2007, Balcer returned to Law & Order at the end of its 17th season as executive producer and head writer. He continued on as showrunner through the show's 20th and final season, writing and directing the show's series finale \\"Rubber Room\\", which the New York Times called the \\"best finale of all\\" that season's TV series. In June 2010, he was hired as showrunner of the Law & Order spinoff, Law & Order: Los Angeles. LOLA, as it was called, was cancelled after one season, with Balcer again writing and directing the series finale. Balcer then rewrote the series finale of Law & Order Criminal Intent, bringing to a close his long association with the Law & Order franchise. In 2012, Balcer created the series Jo, an English-language cop drama set in Paris and starring Jean Reno, Jill Hennessy, Tom Austen and Orla Brady. Shot in Paris, the eight-episode series premiered internationally in January 2013. In 2013, he served as showrunner and executive producer of the CBS pilot, The Ordained, with Charlie Cox, Sam Neil and Hope Davis. In 2013, Balcer made two short videos: Watching Tea Leaves in Shanxi, was shot in China and is a zen meditation on the dynamics of tea leaves in fluid, the video is available on Vimeo and YouTube; the other, Blue Sky, was shot in Nice, France and is an \\"unhinged zen piece\\" featuring the music of Chinese contemporary composer Huang Ruo, the video is available on Vimeo and YouTube. In 2015, Balcer wrote and produced For Justice, a pilot for CBS directed by Ava DuVernay, and developed a series about the porn world in the early 1980s with Owen Wilson for the Starz channel entitled WonderWorld,. In 2016, the CBC and NBC green lighted Balcer's environmental thriller The Council set in the Canadian Arctic. In 2017, Balcer co-directed, co-wrote and produced the documentary Above the Drowning Sea, narrated by Julianna Margulies and Tony Goldwyn. The documentary tells the epic story of thousands of Austrian Jewish refugees who escaped the Holocaust and found refuge in Shanghai. The film has been the Official Selection at 31 international film festivals, winning the Golden Dragon Award for Best Documentary at the Ferrara Film Festival along with other awards and nominations at other festivals. In the summer of 2017, Balcer re-teamed with Dick Wolf to write and produce the limited series Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders, a kaleidoscopic take on the notorious 1989 murders of Beverly Hills socialites by their sons. Created by Balcer, the series stars Edie Falco, Miles G. Villanueva, and Gus Halper, with Heather Graham, Josh Charles, Elizabeth Reaser, Lolita Davidovich, Julianne Nicholson and Anthony Edwards in co-starring roles. The eight-episode series aired in the Fall of 2017 on NBC. In 2019, Balcer created FBI: Most Wanted for CBS as a spin-off of Dick Wolf's FBI. The series stars Julian McMahon, Kellan Lutz, Keisha Castle-Hughes, Roxy Sternberg and Nathaniel Arcand, and premiered on CBS on January 7, 2020. After becoming that season's highest-rated new drama, FBI: Most Wanted was renewed for a second season on May 6, 2020. Balcer has served on the jury for Best Drama Series at the 2013 Monte-Carlo Television Festival, and on the jury for Best Television Miniseries or Film at the 2014 Shanghai Television Festival. Balcer is a distant cousin of actress Alana de la Garza, sharing a common relative Juan Cortina, a Mexican folk hero known as the Rio Grande Robin Hood. Other activities In the summer of 2011, Balcer collaborated with Chinese artist Xu Bing on an artwork that was part of Xu Bing's exhibition Tobacco Project Virginia at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in September of that year. The Washington Post named Tobacco Project Virginia one of the Top Ten art exhibitions of 2011. Balcer's contribution—a poem entitled \\"Backbone\\" using Virginia tobacco plantation brand names as a tribute to the enslaved black women who picked the tobacco—was integrated by Xu Bing into an installation. The work is now part of the VMFA's permanent collection. Balcer later turned the poem into a blues song, Backbone, featuring the blues artists Captain Luke on vocals and Big Ron Hunter on guitar and produced by Michael Sackler-Berner. Backbone was exhibited at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in Connecticut in 2012, the Taipei Fine Arts Museum and the Asia Society Hong Kong Center in 2014, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2015 at SCADA in 2015-16, and at the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing in the fall of 2018. Balcer produced a film documenting Xu Bing's Tobacco Project: Virginia (2011). In 2006, Balcer donated a collection of works by the Japanese woodblock artist Kawase Hasui to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. The René and Carolyn Balcer Collection comprises some 800 works and includes woodblocks prints, watercolors, screens, sketches and other works and writings by Hasui. A major exhibit of the collection, Hasui: Water & Shadow, opened at the VMFA in November 2014 and ran until March 2015. In 2010, through his Mattawin Company, Balcer sponsored the publication of a 13-volume catalogue of the works of the Wuming (No Name) Group, a cooperative of underground Chinese artists during the Cultural Revolution. In the fall of 2011, Balcer and his wife Carolyn organized and sponsored the exhibition Blooming in the Shadows: Unofficial Chinese Art 1974–1985 at New York's China Institute, featuring works from the Wuming, Stars and Grass groups of experimental artists. A larger iteration of the exhibit, Light Before Dawn, opened at the new Asia Society Museum in Hong Kong in May 2013. The exhibit was accompanied by a new documentary written and produced by Balcer, The No Name Painting Association, about the Wuming Group. The documentary was an official selection at some thirty festivals in the US, Canada, Europe and Australia, garnering a dozen awards and nominations. In 2011, Mattawin sponsored the publication of a book of photographs by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, Ai Weiwei New York 1983–1993. In 2014, it sponsored the art exhibit Oil and Water: Reinterpreting Ink at New York's Museum of Chinese in America. Mattawin also co-published A Token of Elegance (2015), a historical and photo survey of cigarette holders as objets d'art; Chow! Secrets of Chinese Cooking (2020), an updated edition of a timeless classic about Chinese cuisine and culture and winner of a 2021 Gourmand World Cookbook Award; and the historical biographies Kuo Ping-Wen, Scholar, Reformer, Statesman (2016) and C.T. Wang: Looking Back and Looking Forward (2008). Balcer has contributed essays to Impressions: The Journal of the Japanese Art Society of America, and It Begins with Metamorphosis: Xu Bing. Balcer has lectured widely about writing, art and the duties of artists in free societies, notably at Columbia, NYU, Harvard, UCLA, UPenn, and Loyola Marymount; at Internews (Moscow), the Sorbonne (Paris), Central Academy of Fine Arts (Beijing), Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Museum of Fine Arts Boston, Canadian Film Centre (Toronto), Deauville American Film Festival, Banff World Media Festival, Monte Carlo TV Festival, International Ukiyo-e Society (Tokyo), and SPAA Conference (Brisbane).

The duo has provided soundtracks to a variety of TV programmes and films, and is known for its rescoring of silent films. Career Twin brothers Klive and Nigel Humberstone and guitar player Anthony Bennett formed this Sheffield-based band in 1981. Influenced by Joy Division, the trio originally tagged along with the UK's industrial music scene, releasing the six-track When Cherished Dreams Come True in June 1983. The \\"Witness (To a Scream)\\" single and Sonority EP followed before the band moved to the Sweatbox label for the fearsome Temper EP. The full-length Twins was recorded without the departed Bennett at Bradford's Flexible Response Studio. The album adopted a more subtle approach by favouring theatrical atmospherics over industrial clatter. Multi-lingual vocalist Dolores Marguerite C made her debut on the Trinity EP adding French narration to \\"Elegy'. Dolores and military-styled percussionist Q were added to the line-up on the subsequent Stormhorse, the soundtrack to an imaginary film that provided the cinematic blueprint for all their future recordings. The quartet's final recording for Sweatbox, 1988's Köda, completed the transition to a classical instrumental sound and utilised computer sequencing in the recording process for the first time. Following the collapse of Sweatbox, the band moved to Third Mind Records to complete the delicate L'Esprit. The album was recorded with engineer Steve Harris who had contributed to Köda and would feature on all the band's subsequent releases. Sense and Duality were followed by a logical progression to real soundtrack work on 1993's psychological drama An Ambush of Ghosts. Their music has also featured in Interview with the Vampire, Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, and The Rainmaker. In the late 90s the band was commissioned, as part of the Optical Music Series, to provide new scores for the silent classics The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Asphalt, and Man with a Movie Camera. Anatomy of a Poet, a concept album about the creative psyche, featured author Colin Wilson reciting romantic poetry against a lush backdrop of strings, and also included a cover version of Scott Walker's \\"Seventh Seal\\". A retrospective compilation of their work was the first release on their own ITN Corporation label. Further concept albums have included Deco (inspired by the Art Deco movement) and the ambitious Lingua, an exploration of language featuring vocal contributions from around the world. The Humberstones also record more dance-oriented material under the Les Jumeaux moniker, and as such were involved in pre-production work on Sabres of Paradise's classic techno anthem \\"Smokebelch\\". The 2011 release Blind Sound was a more consistently dark album from the Humberstone brothers and featured more real percussion than previous releases. In 2011, \\"White Robe\\" from An Ambush of Ghosts was used on a trailer for Game of Thrones. In 2011, head of Radio 1 Christopher Price highlighted the In the Nursery remix of Haunted Dancehall as the style of music that would be played on pop radio to prepare audiences before cutting to an announcement of tragic news such as the death of the Queen.

It premiered in the May 2001 issue of Monthly Shōnen Jump, where it continued until the magazine was shut down in June 2007. At which point the series was temporarily moved to Weekly Shōnen Jump, until transferring to the newly launched Jump Square in November 2007, where it continued until its conclusion in December 2014. The individual chapters were collected into 27 tankōbon volumes by Shueisha between January 2002 and December 2014. Madhouse adapted the first eleven volumes of the series into a twenty-six episode anime series. Directed by Hiroyuki Tanaka, it premiered in Japan on Nippon TV in April 2007 and ran until September 2007. A CD soundtrack for the anime and a CD of character songs using its voice actresses were released on July 25, 2007 and September 27, 2007, respectively. The Claymore manga is licensed for an English language release in North America by Viz Media. It released the first volume of the series on April 4, 2006 and the last volume on October 6, 2015. The anime adaptation is licensed for release in North America by Funimation, which has released the first DVD for the series in Fall 2008 and released the entire series on Blu-ray in Spring 2010. Madman Entertainment has licensed the anime for release in Australia and New Zealand and the anime is sub-licensed by Manga Entertainment for UK distribution. Plot =Setting= The series is set on a fictional medieval island where humans are plagued by , humanoid shape-shifters that feed on humans. A mysterious group, known as The Organization, creates human-Yoma hybrids to kill Yoma for a fee. These female warriors wear armored uniforms. The public refer to them as \\"Claymores,\\" alluding to their Claymore swords,Claymore 1, Scene 3, or \\"Silver-eyed Witches,\\" due to their silver eyes.Claymore 1, Scene 1, p. 17 Yoma and Claymore warriors alike are powered by a demonic energy, , which allows shape- shifting and extreme strength. When warriors use too much Yoki, they \\"awaken,\\" becoming a super-Yoma called an Awakened Being. The act of awakening is likened to the feeling of sexual climax, so while both male and female warriors existed in the past only the women proved to be successful warriors and so the creation of male Claymores stopped altogether. The island world is divided into 47 districts, with one warrior assigned to each.Claymore 5, Scene 25, pp. 130–131 Claymore warriors No. 1 through 47 are ranked on their baseline Yoki potential, strength, agility, intelligence, sensing and leadership. A warrior's rank rises and falls according to the warrior's strength in relation to other warriors. It is unclear whether the warriors strength comes from training/experience or if the potential lies within the warriors themselves. In addition to all having different names, most warriors (usually high in rank) further their individuality by possessing a unique sword technique, fighting style, or Yoki ability. Examples of sword techniques are: twisting the arm around and thrusting for a drill-like strike, unsheathing and re-sheathing the sword faster than the eye can see, or vibrating the sword so quickly the enemy cannot tell where the blade is coming from. A few fighting styles include: stretching the arm, fighting with two blades, and releasing a burst of Yoki for a momentary burst of speed. For Yoki ability, there are several Claymores who can sense Yoki over vast distances and very accurately in close quarters. This appears to be, while not offensive, a very rare and valuable ability and the Claymores in the Organization with this ability are usually highly ranked. In addition, there are four Claymores that have offensive techniques that are Yoki based. The first is Galatea's ability to control her opponents Yoki for brief periods during battle, usually to cause the enemy's attack to miss. The second is Teresa's: her ability to sense Yoki is so strong that she can sense it moving around her opponents body and can therefore sense how and when her enemy would attack next, a technique later copied by Clare. The third ability is that of Rafaela who is able to manipulate the vision and movements of other Claymores. She is employed as an anti-training warrior. =Story arcs= The first arc introduces the protagonist of the series: No. 47, Clare, who saves a young boy, Raki, from a Yoma. The next arc flashes back to the time of Teresa, warrior No. 1 of her era. And the young girl she saves from Yoma—Clare. The arc ends with their tragic encounter with Priscilla. Flashing forward to Clare's time, the Slashers arc introduces Miria (No. 6), Deneve (No. 15), Helen (No. 22) and Galatea (No. 3). The Gravestones arc introduces Ophelia (No. 4). The Witch's Maw arc introduces Jean (No. 9), Riful and Dauf. The Northern Campaign arc introduces Flora (No. 8), Undine (No. 11), Isley and Rigaldo. Raki and Priscilla reappear here. Media =Manga= Written and drawn by Norihiro Yagi, the individual chapters of Claymore began serialization in Shueisha's Monthly Shōnen Jump in 2001. After the magazine was discontinued, the series was moved to Weekly Shōnen Jump, where it still was appearing once a month from July 2 to October 22, 2007. On November 2, 2007, serialization was moved to Jump Square, Shueisha's replacement for the original Monthly Shōnen Jump. The individual chapters are published in tankōbon volumes by Shueisha, which released the first volume on January 5, 2002. As of December 4, 2014, the series has concluded in Japan with 27 volumes and 154 chapters (plus epilogue). On July 18, 2006, Viz Media announced the serialization of the Claymore manga in North America in its Shonen Jump manga anthology. The first chapter of the English adaptation appeared in the April 11, 2006 issue and continued serialization only until the entire first volume was released. Viz released the first volume of the series on April 4, 2006, and the last volume on October 6, 2015. The series is also being released in English in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment. It is licensed for regional language releases in Russia by Comix-ART, in France by Glénat, Spain by Glénat and later Norma Editorial, in Mexico by Grupo Editorial Vid, in Italy by Star Comics, in Brazil by Panini Comics and in Germany by Tokyopop Germany. =Anime= An animated TV series adaptation of the manga produced by Nippon Television, D.N. Dream Partners, Avex Entertainment and Madhouse aired from April 4 to September 26, 2007 in Japan. The anime is directed by Hiroyuki Tanaka, with Yasuko Kobayashi handling series composition, Takahiro Umehara designing the characters and Masanori Takumi composing the music. It adapts the first eleven volumes of its source material over the first 24 episodes, then uses an alternate ending for its final two episodes. As of February 2008, seven DVD volumes, each containing three episodes of the anime, have been released in Japan by Avex Trax. In addition, four limited edition sets have been released. The first limited edition set contains the first DVD volume, while the other three sets each contain two DVD volumes. The latest limited edition set and volumes were released on January 30, 2008. Two more DVD volumes and one more limited edition set are planned for release on March 26, 2008. On February 15, 2008, Funimation announced that it has acquired the Region 1 DVD and broadcast licenses for the anime, and released the first DVD in North America on October 14, 2008: as of February 2009, three volumes have been released. On February 16, 2010, Funimation released a boxed set containing the complete series in Blu-ray format. Madman Entertainment has licensed the series and Volume 1 released early 2009. The series made its North American television debut when it started airing on the Funimation Channel September 6, 2010. Netflix also made Claymore available for streaming, but the series has been removed as of April 2012. All 26 episodes are available on Hulu, however, and Funimation via their streaming video service and DVD.  Music  Two pieces of theme music are used for the episodes: one opening theme and one ending theme. The opening theme is by visual kei rock band Nightmare. The ending theme is J-pop singer Riyu Kosaka's single, . These two themes are used in all twenty-six episodes. Two CDs have been released for the Claymore. The first soundtrack, entitled Claymore TV Animation O.S.T., contained tracks from the anime series and was released on July 25, 2007 with instrumental compositions by Masanori Takumi. Spanning 32 tracks, the soundtrack includes the television-sized versions of the opening and ending themes. A second soundtrack, entitled , was released on 27 September 2007. It contains ten tracks, one each for ten characters from the series, featuring songs performed by the character voice actresses from the anime adaptation. These songs do not appear in anime. =Video game= Cover of Claymore: Gingan no Majo was released by Digital Works Entertainment, 28 May 2009, in Japan. In this Nintendo DS game, the player controls Clare in a similar fashion to side-scrolling Castlevania and Metroid games. Player can alter the strength of Clare's Yoki by using the touch screen and stylus. Abusing the power results in Clare becoming fully possessed by the Yoma, resulting in a game over.  Reception  As of August 13, 2016, the Claymore manga has sold over 8 million copies in Japan. In his review of volume 7, Carlo Santos of Anime News Network says about Clare's action scenes that \\"Clare's fights are nothing short of eye-popping, with page layouts designed for maximum dramatic effect\\". About the drama, he says that \\"even the occasional attempts at drama feel oddly distant\\". About the part in the story where Raki and Clare are separated, he states that it is more like \\"leave now because that's the obvious next step in the plot\\". The art of volume 7 is rated A, story C+, and overall B. Theron Martin, also of Anime News Network, says in his review of volume 14 that \\"the series has lost some of its luster, and it seems like less and less is actually happening with each volume\\". About the action scenes, he says that \\"the actual fights lack some of the dynamism seen in earlier volumes\\". As for the art, he states that \\"as has been true in the past, Yagi's artistry lacks for nothing\\". He rates the art A− in his reviews for volume eleven, twelve and fourteen. However, in his review of volume sixteen, Theron Marton says that \\"Yagi is back on track\\", and that \\"he provides a good mix of old friends popping back up, new allies, startling revelations, dire threats, and of course good-ol' beatdown action, in the process returning the series to arguably its strongest level since volume 12\\". Theron Martin also gave his thoughts on the first five episodes of the anime. He stated that \\"while not without some flaws, the first five episodes generally get the series off to a strong start, practically assuring that Funimation has a solid hit on their hands\\". The rating he gave for the anime is: story A−, animation B+, art A−, music A, and overall A−. In ICv2's list of \\"Top 50 Manga - Summer 2008\\", which subjectively ranks manga based on sales and perceived popularity, Claymore placed 42nd. On release, Weekly Famitsu scored Gingan no Majo a 21 out of 40.

Retrieved from https://www.ck12.org/biology/habitat-and-niche/lesson/Habitat-and-Niche-MS- LS/. The competitive exclusion principle states that if two species with identical niches (ecological roles) compete, then one will inevitably drive the other to extinction. This rule also states that two species cannot occupy the same exact niche in a habitat and coexist together, at least in a stable manner.Khan Academy. \\"Niches & Competition\\". https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/community-ecosystem- ecology/a/niches-competition. When two species differentiate their niches, they tend to compete less strongly, and are thus more likely to coexist. Species can differentiate their niches in many ways, such as by consuming different foods, or using different areas of the environment. As an example of niche partitioning, several anole lizards in the Caribbean islands share common diets—mainly insects. They avoid competition by occupying different physical locations. Although these lizards might occupy different locations, some species can be found inhabiting the same range, with up to 15 in certain areas.Joshua Anderson. \\"Interspecific Competition, Competitive Exclusion, and Niche Differentiation\\". Retrieved from https://study.com/academy/lesson/interspecific-competition-competitive- exclusion-niche-differentiation.html. For example, some live on the ground while others are arboreal. Species who live in different areas compete less for food and other resources, which minimizes competition between species. However, species who live in similar areas typically compete with each other. Detection and quantification  The Lotka–Volterra equation states that two competing species can coexist when intra-specific (within species) competition is greater than inter-specific (between species) competition (Armstrong and McGehee 1981). Since niche differentiation concentrates competition within- species, due to a decrease in between-species competition, the Lotka-Volterra model predicts that niche differentiation of any degree will result in coexistence. In reality, this still leaves the question of how much differentiation is needed for coexistence (Hutchinson 1959). A vague answer to this question is that the more similar two species are, the more finely balanced the suitability of their environment must be in order to allow coexistence. There are limits to the amount of niche differentiation required for coexistence, and this can vary with the type of resource, the nature of the environment, and the amount of variation both within and between the species. To answer questions about niche differentiation, it is necessary for ecologists to be able to detect, measure, and quantify the niches of different coexisting and competing species. This is often done through a combination of detailed ecological studies, controlled experiments (to determine the strength of competition), and mathematical models (Strong 1982, Leibold 1995). To understand the mechanisms of niche differentiation and competition, much data must be gathered on how the two species interact, how they use their resources, and the type of ecosystem in which they exist, among other factors. In addition, several mathematical models exist to quantify niche breadth, competition, and coexistence (Bastolla et al. 2005). However, regardless of methods used, niches and competition can be distinctly difficult to measure quantitatively, and this makes detection and demonstration of niche differentiation difficult and complex.  Development  Over time, two competing species can either coexist, through niche differentiation or other means, or compete until one species becomes locally extinct. Several theories exist for how niche differentiation arises or evolves given these two possible outcomes. =Current competition (The Ghost of Competition Present)= Niche differentiation can arise from current competition. For instance, species X has a fundamental niche of the entire slope of a hillside, but its realized niche is only the top portion of the slope because species Y, which is a better competitor but cannot survive on the top portion of the slope, has excluded it from the lower portion of the slope. With this scenario, competition will continue indefinitely in the middle of the slope between these two species. Because of this, detection of the presence of niche differentiation (through competition) will be relatively easy. It is also important to remember that there is no evolutionary change of the individual species in this case; rather this is an ecological effect of species Y out- competing species X within the bounds of species Y's fundamental niche. =Via past extinctions (The Ghost of Competition Past)= Another way by which niche differentiation can arise is via the previous elimination of species without realized niches. This asserts that at some point in the past, several species inhabited an area, and all of these species had overlapping fundamental niches. However, through competitive exclusion, the less competitive species were eliminated, leaving only the species that were able to coexist (i.e. the most competitive species whose realized niches did not overlap). Again, this process does not include any evolutionary change of individual species, but it is merely the product of the competitive exclusion principle. Also, because no species is out-competing any other species in the final community, the presence of niche differentiation will be difficult or impossible to detect. =Evolving differences= Finally, niche differentiation can arise as an evolutionary effect of competition. In this case, two competing species will evolve different patterns of resource use so as to avoid competition. Here too, current competition is absent or low, and therefore detection of niche differentiation is difficult or impossible.  Types  Below is a list of ways that species can partition their niche. This list is not exhaustive, but illustrates several classic examples. =Resource partitioning= Resource partitioning is the phenomenon where two or more species divides out resources like food, space, resting sites etc. to coexist. For example, some lizard species appear to coexist because they consume insects of differing sizes. Alternatively, species can coexist on the same resources if each species is limited by different resources, or differently able to capture resources. Different types of phytoplankton can coexist when different species are differently limited by nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, and light. In the Galapagos Islands, finches with small beaks are more able to consume small seeds, and finches with large beaks are more able to consume large seeds. If a species' density declines, then the food it most depends on will become more abundant (since there are so few individuals to consume it). As a result, the remaining individuals will experience less competition for food. Although \\"resource\\" generally refers to food, species can partition other non- consumable objects, such as parts of the habitat. For example, warblers are thought to coexist because they nest in different parts of trees. Species can also partition habitat in a way that gives them access to different types of resources. As stated in the introduction, anole lizards appear to coexist because each uses different parts of the forests as perch locations. This likely gives them access to different species of insects. =Predator partitioning= Predator partitioning occurs when species are attacked differently by different predators (or natural enemies more generally). For example, trees could differentiate their niche if they are consumed by different species of specialist herbivores, such as herbivorous insects. If a species density declines, so too will the density of its natural enemies, giving it an advantage. Thus, if each species is constrained by different natural enemies, they will be able to coexist. Early work focused on specialist predators; however, more recent studies have shown that predators do not need to be pure specialists, they simply need to affect each prey species differently. The Janzen–Connell hypothesis represents a form of predator partitioning. =Conditional differentiation= Conditional differentiation (sometimes called temporal niche partitioning) occurs when species differ in their competitive abilities based on varying environmental conditions. For example, in the Sonoran Desert, some annual plants are more successful during wet years, while others are more successful during dry years. As a result, each species will have an advantage in some years, but not others. When environmental conditions are most favorable, individuals will tend to compete most strongly with member of the same species. For example, in a dry year, dry-adapted plants will tend to be most limited by other dry- adapted plants. This can help them to coexist through a storage effect. =Competition-predation trade-off= Species can differentiate their niche via a competition-predation trade-off if one species is a better competitor when predators are absent, and the other is better when predators are present. Defenses against predators, such as toxic compounds or hard shells, are often metabolically costly. As a result, species that produce such defenses are often poor competitors when predators are absent. Species can coexist through a competition-predation trade-off if predators are more abundant when the less defended species is common, and less abundant if the well-defended species is common. This effect has been criticized as being weak, because theoretical models suggest that only two species within a community can coexist because of this mechanism.  Coexistence without niche differentiation: exceptions to the rule  Some competing species have been shown to coexist on the same resource with no observable evidence of niche differentiation and in “violation” of the competitive exclusion principle. One instance is in a group of hispine beetle species (Strong 1982). These beetle species, which eat the same food and occupy the same habitat, coexist without any evidence of segregation or exclusion. The beetles show no aggression either intra- or inter-specifically. Coexistence may be possible through a combination of non- limiting food and habitat resources and high rates of predation and parasitism, though this has not been demonstrated. This example illustrates that the evidence for niche differentiation is by no means universal. Niche differentiation is also not the only means by which coexistence is possible between two competing species (see Shmida and Ellner 1984). However, niche differentiation is a critically important ecological idea which explains species coexistence, thus promoting the high biodiversity often seen in many of the world's biomes. Research using mathematical modelling is indeed demonstrating that predation can indeed stabilize lumps of very similar species. Willow warbler and chiffchaff and other very similar warblers can serve as an example. The idea is that it is also a good strategy to be very similar to a successful species or have enough dissimilarity. Also trees in the rain forest can serve as an example of all high canopy species basically following the same strategy. Other examples of nearly identical species clusters occupying the same niche were water beetles, prairie birds and algae. The basic idea is that there can be clusters of very similar species all applying the same successful strategy and between them open spaces. Here the species cluster takes the place of a single species in the classical ecological models.

Career Eisenstein was educated at Vassar College where she received her B.A., then went on to Radcliffe College for her M.A. and Ph.D. It was there she studied under Crane Brinton. She reported that in the early 1950s she was not able to find a position in a university history department, not even part-time work. In 1957, after she had obtained her PhD, she and her husband moved to Washington, D.C. where she applied to multiple institutions for teaching positions, including Georgetown, George Washington University, Howard, and the University of Maryland. She eventually found a part-time position at American University. She taught as an adjunct professor at American University from 1959 to 1974, then the University of Michigan, where she was the Alice Freeman Palmer Professor of History.Cherry Williams, \\"Analytical Intellectual Biography of Elizabeth L.

From the age of 50, Eisenstein began competing in senior tennis tournaments, becoming well-known and winning three national grand slams between 2003-2005.https://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/news/article/13031769/the- assassin The Printing Press as an Agent of Change Eisenstein describes the conditions of scarcity that characterized the book as artifact in the age of the scribe. Eisenstein's best-known work is The Printing Press as an Agent of Change, a two-volume, 750-page exploration of the effects of movable type printing on the literate elite of post-Gutenberg Western Europe. In this work she focuses on the printing press's functions of dissemination, standardization, and preservation and the way these functions aided the progress of the Protestant Reformation, the Renaissance, and the Scientific Revolution. Eisenstein's work brought historical method, rigor, and clarity to earlier ideas of Marshall McLuhan and others, about the general social effects of such media transitions. This work provoked debate in the academic community from the moment it was publishedPeter F. McNally, ed., The Advent of Printing: Historians of Science Respond to Elizabeth Eisenstein's \\"The Printing Press as an Agent of Change\\" (Montreal: McGill University Graduate School of Library and Information Studies, 1987). and is still inspiring conversation and new research today.Sabrina Alcorn Baron, Eric N. Lindquist, and Eleanor F. Shevlin, eds. Agent of Change: Print Culture Studies After Elizabeth L. Eisenstein (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2007). Her work also influenced later thinking about the subsequent development of digital media. Her work on the transition from manuscript to print influenced thought about new transitions of print text to digital formats, including multimedia and new ideas about the definition of text.James A. Dewar, The Information Age and the Printing Press: Looking Backward to See Ahead, RAND Paper 8014 (Santa Monica, CA: RAND, 1998), https://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P8014 Eisenstein’s book has also received sharp criticism. Paul Needham, now Librarian at Princeton University’s Scheide Library, described it as \\"almost impossible to comprehend\\" and suffering \\"from more general flaws of historical method: an unconcern for exact chronology; a lack of historical context; an exclusive reliance of [sic] secondary writings, not always accurately absorbed, not always particularly relevant …\\" The Unacknowledged Revolution Eisenstein's book The Printing Press as an Agent of Change lays out her thoughts on the \\"Unacknowledged Revolution,\\" her name for the revolution that occurred after the invention of print. Print media allowed the general public to have access to books and knowledge that had not been available to them before; this led to the growth of public knowledge and individual thought. The ability to formulate thought on one's own thoughts became reality with the popularity of the printing press. Print also \\"standardized and preserved knowledge which had been much more fluid in the age of oral manuscript circulation\\" Eisenstein recognizes this period of time to be very important in the development of human culture; however, she feels that it is often overlooked, thus, the 'unacknowledged revolution'.

The ventral cochlear nucleus is unlayered whereas the dorsal cochlear nucleus is layered. Auditory nerve fibers, fibers that travel through the auditory nerve (also known as the cochlear nerve or eighth cranial nerve) carry information from the inner ear, the cochlea, on the same side of the head, to the nerve root in the ventral cochlear nucleus. At the nerve root the fibers branch to innervate the ventral cochlear nucleus and the deep layer of the dorsal cochlear nucleus. All acoustic information thus enters the brain through the cochlear nuclei, where the processing of acoustic information begins. The outputs from the cochlear nuclei are received in higher regions of the auditory brainstem. Structure The cochlear nuclei (CN) are located at the dorso-lateral side of the brainstem, spanning the junction of the pons and medulla. * The ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) on the ventral aspect of the brain stem, ventrolateral to the inferior peduncle. * The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), also known as the tuberculum acusticum or acoustic tubercle, curves over the VCN and wraps around the cerebellar peduncle. ** The VCN is further divided by the nerve root into the posteroventral cochlear nucleus (PVCN) and the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN). = Projections to the cochlear nuclei = The major input to the cochlear nucleus is from the auditory nerve, a part of cranial nerve VIII (the vestibulocochlear nerve). The auditory nerve fibers form a highly organized system of connections according to their peripheral innervation of the cochlea. Axons from the spiral ganglion cells of the lower frequencies innervate the ventrolateral portions of the ventral cochlear nucleus and lateral-ventral portions of the dorsal cochlear nucleus. The axons from the higher frequency organ of corti hair cells project to the dorsal portion of the ventral cochlear nucleus and the dorsal-medial portions of the dorsal cochlear nucleus. The mid frequency projections end up in between the two extremes; in this way the tonotopic organization that is established in the cochlea is preserved in the cochlear nuclei. This tonotopic organization is preserved because only a few inner hair cells synapse on the dendrites of a nerve cell in the spiral ganglion, and the axon from that nerve cell synapses on only a very few dendrites in the cochlear nucleus. In contrast with the VCN that receives all acoustic input from the auditory nerve, the DCN receives input not only from the auditory nerve but it also receives acoustic input from neurons in the VCN (T stellate cells). The DCN is therefore in a sense a second order sensory nucleus. The cochlear nuclei have long been thought to receive input only from the ipsilateral ear. There is evidence, however, for stimulation from the contralateral ear via the contralateral CN, and also the somatosensory parts of the brain. = Projections from the cochlear nuclei = There are three major fiber bundles, axons of cochlear nuclear neurons, that carry information from the cochlear nuclei to targets that are mainly on the opposite side of the brain. Through the medulla, one projection goes to the contralateral superior olivary complex (SOC) via the trapezoid body, whilst the other half shoots to the ipsilateral SOC. This pathway is called the ventral acoustic stria (VAS or, more commonly, the trapezoid body). Another pathway, called the dorsal acoustic stria (DAS, also known as the stria of von Monakow), rises above the medulla into the pons where it hits the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus along with its kin, the intermediate acoustic stria (IAS, also known as the stria of Held). The IAS decussates across the medulla, before joining the ascending fibers in the contralateral lateral lemniscus. The lateral lemniscus contains cells of the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus, and in turn projects to the inferior colliculus. The inferior colliculus receives direct, monosynaptic projections from the superior olivary complex the contralateral dorsal acoustic stria, some classes of stellate neurons of the VCN, as well as from the different nuclei of the lateral lemniscus. Most of these inputs terminate in the inferior colliculus, although there are a few small projections that bypass the inferior colliculus and project to the medial geniculate, or other forebrain structures. *Medial superior olive (MSO) via trapezoid body (TB) – Ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation for low frequency sounds. *Lateral superior olive (LSO) directly and via TB – Ipsilateral stimulation for high frequency sounds. *Medial nucleus of trapezoid body (MNTB) – Contralateral stimulation. *Inferior colliculus – Contralateral stimulation. *Periolivary nuclei (PON) – Ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation. *Lateral lemniscus (LL) and lemniscal nuclei (LN) – Ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation. =Histology= Three types of principal cells convey information out of the ventral cochlear nucleus: Bushy cells, stellate cells, and octopus cells. * Bushy cells are found mainly in the anterior ventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN). These can be further divided into large spherical, small spherical and globular bushy cells, depending on their appearance, and also their location. Within the AVCN there is an area of large spherical cells; caudal to this are smaller spherical cells, and globular cells occupy the region around the nerve root. An important difference between these subtypes is that they project to differing targets in the superior olivary complex. Large spherical bushy cells project to the ipsilateral and contralateral medial superior olive. Globular bushy cells project to the contralateral medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, and small spherical bushy cells likely project to the lateral superior olive. They have a few (1-4) very short dendrites with numerous small branching, which cause it to resemble a “bush”. The bushy cells have specialized electrical properties that allow them to transmit timing information from the auditory nerve to more central areas of the auditory system. Because bushy cells receive input from multiple auditory nerve fibers that are tuned to similar frequencies, bushy cells can improve the precision of the timing information by in essence averaging out jitter in timing of the inputs. Bushy cells can also be inhibited by sounds adjacent to the frequency to which they are tuned, leading to even sharper tuning than seen in auditory nerve fibers. These cells are usually innervated only by a few auditory nerve fibres, which dominate its firing pattern. These afferent nerve fibres wrap their terminal branches around the entire soma, creating a large synapse onto the bushy cells, called an \\"endbulb of Held\\". Therefore, a single unit recording of an electrically stimulated bushy neuron characteristically produces exactly one action potential and constitutes the primary response. * Stellate cells (aka multipolar cells), have longer dendrites that lie parallel to fascicles of auditory nerve fibers. They are also called chopper cells, in reference to their ability to fire a regularly spaced train of action potentials for the duration of a tonal or noise stimulus. The chopping pattern is intrinsic to the electrical excitability of the stellate cell, and the firing rate depends on the strength of the auditory input more than on the frequency. Each stellate cell is narrowly tuned and has inhibitory sidebands, enabling the population of stellate cells to encode the spectrum of sounds, enhancing spectral peaks and valleys. These neurons provide acoustic input to the DCN. * Octopus cells are found in a small region of the posterior ventral cochlear nucleus (PVCN). The distinguishing features of these cells are their long, thick and tentacle-shaped dendrites that typically emanate from one side of the cell body. Octopus cells produce an \\"Onset Response\\" to simple tonal stimuli. That is, they respond only at the onset of a broad-band stimulus. The octopus cells can fire with some of the highest temporal precision of any neuron in the brain. Electrical stimuli to the auditory nerve evoke a graded excitatory postsynaptic potential in the octopus cells. These EPSPs are very brief. The octopus cells are thought to be important for extracting timing information. It has been reported that these cells can respond to click trains at a rate of 800 Hz. Two types of principal cells convey information out of the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) to the contralateral inferior colliculus. The principal cells receive two systems of inputs. Acoustic input comes to the deep layer through several paths. Excitatory acoustic input comes from auditory nerve fibers and also from stellate cells of the VCN. Acoustic input is also conveyed through inhibitory interneurons (tuberculoventral cells of the DCN and \\"wide band inhibitors\\" in the VCN). Through the outermost molecular layer, the DCN receives other types of sensory information, most importantly information about the location of the head and ears, through parallel fibers. This information is distributed through a cerebellar like circuit that also includes inhibitory interneurons. * Fusiform cells (also known as pyramidal cells). Fusiform cells integrate information through two tufts of dendrites, the apical dendrites receiving multisensory, excitatory and inhibitory input through the outermost molecular layer and the basal dendrites receiving excitatory and inhibitory acoustic input from the basal dendrites that extend into the deep layer. These neurons are thought to enable mammals to analyze the spectral cues that enable us to localize sounds in elevation and when we lose hearing in one ear. * Giant cells also integrate inputs from the molecular and deep layers but input from the deep layer is predominant. It is unclear what their role is in hearing.  Function  The cochlear nuclear complex is the first integrative, or processing, stage in the auditory system. Information is brought to the nuclei from the ipsilateral cochlea via the cochlear nerve. Several tasks are performed in the cochlear nuclei. By distributing acoustic input to multiple types of principal cells, the auditory pathway is subdivided into parallel ascending pathways, which can simultaneously extract different types of information. The cells of the ventral cochlear nucleus extract information that is carried by the auditory nerve in the timing of firing and in the pattern of activation of the population of auditory nerve fibers. The cells of the dorsal cochlear nucleus perform a non-linear spectral analysis and place that spectral analysis into the context of the location of the head, ears and shoulders and that separate expected, self-generated spectral cues from more interesting, unexpected spectral cues using input from the auditory cortex, pontine nuclei, trigeminal ganglion and nucleus, dorsal column nuclei and the second dorsal root ganglion. It is likely that these neurons help mammals to use spectral cues for orienting toward those sounds. The information is used by higher brainstem regions to achieve further computational objectives (such as sound source location or improvement in signal to noise ratio). The inputs from these other areas of the brain probably play a role in sound localization. In order to understand in more detail the specific functions of the cochlear nuclei it is first necessary to understand the way sound information is represented by the fibers of the auditory nerve. Briefly, there are around 30,000 auditory nerve fibres in each of the two auditory nerves. Each fiber is an axon of a spiral ganglion cell that represents a particular frequency of sound, and a particular range of loudness. Information in each nerve fibre is represented by the rate of action potentials as well as the particular timing of individual action potentials. The particular physiology and morphology of each cochlear nucleus cell type enhances different aspects of sound information.

Along with the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN), it forms the cochlear nucleus (CN), where all auditory nerve fibers from the cochlea form their first synapses. Anatomy The DCN differs from the ventral portion of the CN as it not only projects to the central nucleus (a subdivision) of the inferior colliculus (CIC), but also receives efferent innervation from the auditory cortex, superior olivary complex and the inferior colliculus. The cytoarchitecture and neurochemistry of the DCN is similar to that of the cerebellum, an important concept in theories of DCN function.Bell CC, Han V et al. Cerebellum-like structures and their implications for cerebellar function. Annu.Rev.Neurosci. 2008.Vol31. Thus, the DCN is thought to be involved with more complex auditory processing, rather than merely transferring information. The pyramidal cells or giant cells are a major cell grouping of the DCN. These cells are the target of two different input systems. The first system arises from the auditory nerve, and carries acoustic information. The second set of inputs is relayed through a set of small granule cells in the cochlear nucleus. There are also a great number of neighbouring cartwheel cells.Wouterlood FG and Mugnaini E. Cartwheel neurons of the dorsal cochlear nucleus: a Golgi-electron microscopic study in rat. J.Comp Neurol 1984 Jul20;227(1) The granule cells in turn are the target of a number of different inputs, including both those involved in auditory processing and, at least in lower mammals, somatosensory inputs associated with the head, the ear, and the jaw. Projections from DCN principal cells form the dorsal acoustic stria, which ultimately terminate in the CIC. This projection overlaps with that of the lateral superior olive (LSO) in a well-defined manner, where they form the primary excitatory input for ICC type O units. Physiology Principal cells in the DCN have very complex frequency intensity tuning curves. Classified as cochlear nucleus type IV cells, the firing rate may be very rapid in response to a low intensity sound at one frequency and then fall below the spontaneous rate with only a small increment in stimulus frequency or intensity. The firing rate may then increase with another increment in intensity or frequency. Type IV cells are excited by wide band noise, and particularly excited by a noise-notch stimulus directly below the cell's best frequency (BF). While the VCN bushy cells aid in the location of a sound stimulus on the horizontal axis via their inputs to the superior olivary complex, type IV cells may participate in localization of the sound stimulus on the vertical axis. The pinna selectively amplifies frequencies, resulting in reduced sound energy at specific frequencies in certain regions of space. The complicated firing patterns of type IV cells makes them especially suited to detecting these notches, and with the combined power of these two localization systems, an ordinary person can locate where a firework explodes without the use of their eyes. Somatosensory inputs inhibit type IV cell activity, possibly silencing their activity during head and pinna movements. While this has not been studied extensively, it may play an important role in sound source localization in elevation. A similar effect is seen in the visual system in an effect known as change blindness. Current auditory models of the DCN employ a two-inhibitor model. Type IV cells receive excitation directly from the auditory nerve, and are inhibited by type II (vertical) cells and a wide band inhibitor (onset-c cells).

Q. Khan Research Laboratories, or KRL for short, is a federally funded, multi-program national research institute and national laboratory site primarily dedicated to uranium enrichment, supercomputing and fluid mechanics. It is managed by the Ministry of Energy for the Government of Pakistan. The laboratory is located in Kahuta, a short distance north-east of Rawalpindi, Punjab, Pakistan. The site was organized to produce weapons-grade nuclear material, primarily weapons-grade uranium, as part of Pakistan's secretive atomic bomb program in the years after the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971. Chosen to be a top-secret location, it was built in secrecy by the Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers. It was commissioned under the Army engineers with civilian scientists joining the site in late 1976. During the midst of the 1970s, the site was the cornerstone of the first stage of Pakistan's atomic bomb program, and is one of the many sites where classified scientific research on atomic bombs was undertaken. The KRL has prestige for conducting research and development to be able to produce highly enriched uranium (HEU) utilizing the Zippe-method of gas centrifuge– the other user of this method is the Urenco Group in the Netherlands. Since its inception, many technical staff have been employed, mostly physicists and mathematicians, assisted by engineers (both Army and civilians), chemists, and material scientists. Professional scientists and engineers are delegated to visit this institute, after undergoing strict screening and background checks, to participate as visitors in scientific projects. As of its current mission, KRL is one of the largest science and technology research sites in Pakistan, and conducts multidisciplinary research and development in fields such as national security, space exploration, and supercomputing. History As early as the 1970s, the early stage of Pakistan's atomic bomb program focused its primary efforts on producing and developing a weapons-grade plutonium nuclear device under the research led by the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) at its national laboratory, the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology (PINSTECH) in Nilore. In 1974, India conducted a surprise nuclear test, (Smiling Buddha), so PAEC launched a clandestine uranium enrichment project with nuclear engineer Sultan Mahmood becoming its director– Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan joined the program in 1974 as an adviser. Work at the Kahuta site was initiated by Prime Minister of Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. After disagreeing with Director Sultan Mahmood's calculations and feasibility report submitted to the government, Prime Minister Bhutto detached the work from PAEC by making Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan its chief scientist in 1976. The uranium program was moved to Kahuta where the project was established as the Engineering Research Laboratories (ERL). According to Dr. Khan, materials were imported from Europe with the help of two procurement officers; one of them was Engineer Ikramul Haq Khan, deputed to KRL via Major-General Ali Nawab, Hilal-i-Imtiaz (Military) 1979. Wanting a capable civil engineer to supervise the construction, Bhutto asked the Chief of Army Staff for the selection, and the Engineer-in-Chief chose Brigadier Zahid Ali Akbar to lead the program. Because the experiments were deemed too dangerous to conduct in a major city, the operations were moved in a remote mountainous northern areas of Pakistan. The entire site and Kahuta was rebuilt in the 1980s by the Corps of Engineers under Lieutenant-General Zahid Ali Akbar, with logistics provided by the Military Engineering Service. Conducting classified research, the facility was heavy secured by both the Pakistan Army and the Pakistan Air Force (PAF). All employees needed badges to pass a checkpoint, and the laboratories are electronically fenced and guarded. The ERL was intended to spur innovation and provide competition to the weapon design at PAEC. Some renowned scientists, Dr. G. D. Alam (theoretical physicist) from PAEC had joined the ERL and enriched the uranium at Kahuta while Dr. T. M. Shah (a mathematician) and Anwar Ali (a physicist) and some other scientists also supported him. The site quickly installed thousands of gas centrifuges, using the Zippe method, to run at about 65,000 revolutions per minute (rpm) for an average of 10 years. The Uranium-235 (U235) containing only ~0.7% enriched material is brought to more than 90.0% through three stages of enrichment, leaving the original material depleted from 0.7% to 0.2%, which then now at both civilian and military- grade. In the 1970s, ERL heavily depended on URENCO's method but lessened the dependence in 1979 after local methods were developed with efforts studied and learned by Dr. G. D. Alam and Dr. T. M Shah. Unverified claims were made by KRL in 1983–84 of conducting weapon design tests. After visiting the site in May 1981, President Zia-ul-Haq renamed ERL as the Khan Research Laboratory (KRL) in honor of its founder and senior scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan. The KRL established a system of computer numerical control to control the ultracentrifuges in 1983. By 1986, KRL began producing highly enriched uranium (HEU) as well as developing the krytron, while classified work on the uranium weapon design took place with uranium hexafluoride (UF6) being reduced to uranium metal and machined into weapon pits. The KRL began publishing a series of academic articles on numerics and computational methods for centrifuge design, including a 1987 article co-authored by Abdul Qadeer Khan on techniques for balancing sophisticated ultracentrifuge rotors.Upadhyaya, Gopal S. (2011). \\"§Dr. A.Q. Khan of Pakistan\\". Men of Metals and Materials: My Memoires. Bloomington, Indiana, United States: iUniverse.com. p. 248pp. . In the 1990s, KRL had a number of the most high-performance supercomputer and parallel computing systems installed at the facility. A parallel Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) division was established which specialized in conducting high performance computations on shock waves in weapons effect from the outer surface to the inner core by using difficult differential equations of the state of the materials used in the bomb under high pressure. In an investigative report published by Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), Chinese scientists were reportedly present at Kahuta in the early 1980s— an unconfirmed indicator of Chinese assistance in the development of equipment at Kahuta. In 1996, the U.S. intelligence community maintained that China provided magnetic rings for special suspension bearings mounted at the top of rotating centrifuge cylinders. In 2005, it was revealed that President Zia-ul- Haq's military government had KRL run a HEU programme in the Chinese nuclear weapons program. Abdul Qadeer Khan also alleged that \\"KRL has built a centrifuge facility for China in Hanzhong city\\". Extended research The academic research programs and development opportunities at the KRL are supported by the physics departments of the Government College University in Lahore in Punjab and the University of Karachi in Sindh. The KRL supports its physics program through funding and providing scholarship to physics and engineering students at the Government College University. The continuing efforts to make the laboratories more science efficient led the Ministry of Science (MoST) to grant a three research and fellowship programmes with the Government College University with the support of Pakistan Science Foundation (PSF). Since 1980 at present, the KRL continues to develop the research work on computational mathematics, supercomputing and advanced mathematics to the extended applications to natural sciences. In 1999, the KRL established a research institute on computer science at Kahuta, which was later integrated to University of Engineering and Technology in Taxila. The civilian research on biotechnology, biology and Genetic Engineering is supported by the KRL at the University of Karachi, with the support from Pakistan Science Foundation. The KRL organized a conference on Computational biology in Islamabad to present overview of the scope of computational sciences. National security program Apart from researching on uranium and developing the uranium enrichment facilities, the KRL includes a ballistic missile-space research laboratories that competes with the PAEC to produce advanced ballistic missiles ranging for targeting enemy combatant targets and the space exploration. Its space-missile exploration projects based on producing the liquid fuel rockets in comparison to solid fuel rockets projects of the National Development Complex (NDC). The KRL's missile projects are widely believed to be based on North Korean technology; exchanges took place in the late 1990s. The following missiles have been produced by KRL: * Ghauri I (Hatf V) – first tested in 1999. * Ghauri II – has a range of 2,000–2,500 km. * Hatf-I The KRL performs variety of weapons science and engineering projects for Pakistan Armed Forces. Since the 1980s, the KRL is involved in numerous military equipment and conventional weaponry development projects. The resulting systems have been put into service by the Pakistan's military and exported to other friendly nations. The following is a list of known equipment produced under these projects: * Guided missiles: ** Anza series of man- portable air defence systems. ** Baktar-Shikan man-portable anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) system. ** Modules for the BGM-71 TOW ATGM. * Electrical and electronic equipment: ** Power conditioners for the above missile systems. ** Switched-mode power supplies for the following air defence systems: *** LAADS radar, Skyguard radar, Air Defense Automation System. * Equipment for clearance of anti-personnel and anti-tank mines, including remote control mine exploders (RCME) and mine-sweeping line charges. * Laser equipment: ** Laser range-finders, laser warning receivers, laser aiming devices, a laser actuated targeting system for training tank gunners. * Reactive armour kits for armoured vehicles and APFS-DS anti-tank ammunition for main battle tanks. * Digital goniometers.

This occurs when recovery and recrystallisation are complete and further reduction in the internal energy can only be achieved by reducing the total area of grain boundary. The term is commonly used in metallurgy but is also used in reference to ceramics and minerals. Importance of grain growth Most materials exhibit the Hall–Petch effect at room-temperature and so display a higher yield stress when the grain size is reduced (assuming abnormal grain growth has not taken place). At high temperatures the opposite is true since the open, disordered nature of grain boundaries means that vacancies can diffuse more rapidly down boundaries leading to more rapid Coble creep. Since boundaries are regions of high energy they make excellent sites for the nucleation of precipitates and other second-phases e.g. Mg–Si–Cu phases in some aluminium alloys or martensite platlets in steel. Depending on the second phase in question this may have positive or negative effects. Rules of grain growth Grain growth has long been studied primarily by the examination of sectioned, polished and etched samples under the optical microscope. Although such methods enabled the collection of a great deal of empirical evidence, particularly with regard to factors such as temperature or composition, the lack of crystallographic information limited the development of an understanding of the fundamental physics. Nevertheless, the following became well-established features of grain growth: # Grain growth occurs by the movement of grain boundaries and not by coalescence (i.e. like water droplets) # Boundary movement is discontinuous and the direction of motion may change suddenly. # One grain may grow into another grain whilst being consumed from the other side # The rate of consumption often increases when the grain is nearly consumed # A curved boundary typically migrates towards its centre of curvature # When grain boundaries in a single phase meet at angles other than 120 degrees, the grain included by the more acute angle will be consumed so that the angles approach 120 degrees. Driving force The boundary between one grain and its neighbour (grain boundary) is a defect in the crystal structure and so it is associated with a certain amount of energy. As a result, there is a thermodynamic driving force for the total area of boundary to be reduced. If the grain size increases, accompanied by a reduction in the actual number of grains per volume, then the total area of grain boundary will be reduced. The local velocity of a grain boundary at any point is proportional to the local curvature of the grain boundary, i.e.: v=M sigma kappa , where v is the velocity of grain boundary, M is grain boundary mobility (generally depends on orientation of two grains), sigma is the grain boundary energy and kappa is the sum of the two principal surface curvatures. For example, shrinkage velocity of a spherical grain embedded inside another grain is v= M sigma frac{2}{R} , where R is radius of the sphere. This driving pressure is very similar in nature to the Laplace pressure that occurs in foams. In comparison to phase transformations the energy available to drive grain growth is very low and so it tends to occur at much slower rates and is easily slowed by the presence of second phase particles or solute atoms in the structure. Ideal grain growth phase field model. Click to see the animation. Ideal grain growth is a special case of normal grain growth where boundary motion is driven only by local curvature of the grain boundary. It results in the reduction of the total amount of grain boundary surface area i.e. total energy of the system. Additional contributions to the driving force by e.g. elastic strains or temperature gradients are neglected. If it holds that the rate of growth is proportional to the driving force and that the driving force is proportional to the total amount of grain boundary energy, then it can be shown that the time t required to reach a given grain size is approximated by the equation d^2 - {d_0}^2 = kt ,! where d0 is the initial grain size, d is the final grain size and k is a temperature dependent constant given by an exponential law: k = k_0 exp left ( frac{-Q}{RT} right ) ,! where k0 is a constant, T is the absolute temperature and Q is the activation energy for boundary mobility. Theoretically, the activation energy for boundary mobility should equal that for self-diffusion but this is often found not to be the case. In general these equations are found to hold for ultra-high purity materials but rapidly fail when even tiny concentrations of solute are introduced.  Self-similarity  Click to see the animation. Geometry of a single growing grain is changing during grain growth. This is extracted from a large scale phase-field simulation. Here surfaces are \\"grain boundaries\\", edges are \\"triple junctions\\" and corners are vertexes or higher-order junctions. For more information please see. An old-standing topic in grain growth is the evolution of the grains size distribution. Inspired by the work of Lifshitz and Slyozov on Ostwald ripening, Hillert has suggested that in a normal grain growth process the size distribution function must converge to a self-similar solution, i.e. it becomes invariant when the grain size is scaled with a characteristic length of the system R_{cr}that is proportional to the average grain size langle R rangle. Several simulation studies, however, have shown that the size distribution deviates from the Hillert's self-similar solution. Hence a search for a new possible self-similar solution was initiated that indeed led to a new class of self-similar distribution functions. Large-scale phase field simulations have shown that there is indeed a self-similar behavior possible within the new distribution functions. It was shown that the origin of the deviation from Hillert's distribution is indeed the geometry of grains specially when they are shrinking.  Normal vs abnormal  discontinuous (abnormal) grain growth, where one grain grows at a much greater rate than its neighbours. In common with recovery and recrystallisation, growth phenomena can be separated into continuous and discontinuous mechanisms. In the former the microstructure evolves from state A to B (in this case the grains get larger) in a uniform manner. In the latter, the changes occur heterogeneously and specific transformed and untransformed regions may be identified. Abnormal or discontinuous grain growth is characterised by a subset of grains growing at a high rate and at the expense of their neighbours and tends to result in a microstructure dominated by a few very large grains. In order for this to occur the subset of grains must possess some advantage over their competitors such as a high grain boundary energy, locally high grain boundary mobility, favourable texture or lower local second-phase particle density. Factors hindering growth If there are additional factors preventing boundary movement, such as Zener pinning by particles, then the grain size may be restricted to a much lower value than might otherwise be expected. This is an important industrial mechanism in preventing the softening of materials at high temperature. Inhibition Certain materials especially refractories which are processed at high temperatures end up with excessively large grain size and poor mechanical properties at room temperature. To mitigate this problem in a common sintering procedure, a variety of dopants are often used to inhibit grain growth. References * F. J. Humphreys and M.

Their name comes from Abney Park Cemetery in London (UK). Formerly a goth band, Abney Park has transformed their look and sound and has been called the \\"quintessential\\" spokespeople of steampunk culture.  History  = Early days = Abney Park is the creative brainchild of Robert Brown, who formed the band in 1997 and continues to be the lead singer, principal songwriter, artistic director, and chief manager of the band. Brown released the first full-length album Abney Park in 1998, and in 1999 released Return to the Fire. The band's third album \\"Cemetery Number 1\\" drew from their first two albums as well as introducing several new songs. These early albums pioneered steampunk themes prior to the band’s adoption of the steampunk label with lyrics depicting clockwork boys and steampowered dystopian cities (“the Change Cage”, and “Twisted and Broken”). In 1998 the Tacoma-based counter culture magazine “Pandemonium” first labeled Abney Park a “goth band,” citing their electronic sound and Robert Brown’s deep baritone voice. (The band is named after an iconically gothic cemetery in London, where Brown lived and studied for a period in 1988). This label stuck, and influenced the band’s musical and visual style, which culminated with their 2002 release From Dreams Or Angels. Their songs \\"The Change Cage\\", \\"Black Day\\" and \\"No Life\\" reached number one on the Industrial, Dark-wave and Black Metal music charts, respectively In 2005, the band released Taxidermy, which is a collection of new versions of songs from past albums, three live tracks and two covers. In 2006, the release of the album The Death of Tragedy marked the beginning of a major change for the band, as their music departed from a goth/pagan sound to a more world music/fusion one. = Becoming steampunk = In early 2005, Robert Brown took the creative leap of transforming Abney Park from a largely goth industrial band into a steampunk band. As Brown said on his live journal post March 13, 2005, “(We) seem to be a sort of specialized variation on Steam Punk, sort of a ‘Victorian Sci-fi Adventurer’. As if we just arrived by jet-powered-zeppelin for a midnight dig just outside of Cairo in the 1900s - I’m excited because I feel like for the first time our appearances are starting to capture the same level of imagination and exotic tones the music and lyrics always have.” As part of that transformation, fictional identities were created for the main performers; e.g., Robert Brown became known as Captain Robert. Since steampunk is largely derived from science fiction and fantasy literature, a fictional backstory was created to set a stage for their new music. According to that story (as told in The Wrath of Fate: Book 1 of The Airship Pirate Chronicles, by Robert Brown) the band's plane collided with a time-travelling dirigible called the HMS Ophelia— said to have been created by a Dr. Leguminous Calgori in a freak storm. The band commandeered the vessel, deciding to become airship pirates, and formed a new band from the surviving members of the crash. Much of their music since that time has been based around this fictional backstory. “The new, eclectic sound is attributed to the strange instruments and exotic musical influences lifted from the numerous locations and eras they have visited in the airship Ophelia, featuring “clockwork guitars, belly dancers, flintlock bassists, Middle-Eastern percussion, violent violin, and Tesla powered keyboards blazing in a post-apocalyptic, swashbuckling, Steampunk musical mayhem.’ In the spring of 2008, they released Lost Horizons, their first wholly steampunk-themed album, and in 2009, the band released Æther Shanties, their tenth album. A recording of a live performance of their next album, The End Of Days, can be found here. Their seventh studio album, was released on October 15, 2010. = Popularity = Now sometimes called the \\"quintessential\\" steampunk band, Abney Park has been featured in major news media and interviewed by several genre magazines and websites, and has been highlighted on MTV and G4TV as primary examples of the steampunk musical scene. Abney Park has performed at numerous festivals. It was the featured band at the first Steamcon in 2009 and has appeared at Steamcon numerous times since. They have appeared three times at World Steam Expo, five times at Dragon*Con; also WGW, Utah Dark Arts, Bats Day, Convergence, Ravenwood Festival, Masque and Veil, Queen Mary Pyrate Daze, the Bay Area Maker Faire, and Wild Wild West Steampunk Convention. Internationally, they have made four appearances at Whitby Gothic Weekend in the UK, two appearances at Wave Gotik TReffen in Leipzig, Germany, and four at the Grand Canadian Steampunk Exposition in Ontario Canada.They have been in demand for shows in St Petersberg and Moscow, Russia, Spain, Australia, and the UK. Their music has also been featured in many compilation CDs, including Gilded Age Records' An Age Remembered: A Steampunk and Neo-Victorian Mix, Cleopatra Records' The Unquiet Grave vol. III, Sepiachord's A Sepiachord Companion, BLC Productions' Annihilation and Seduction, Squish Me Down Records' Eighteen (Eighteen NW Bands Benefit CD) Their music has also appeared in several movie soundtracks, including Insomnis Amour, Goth, and Lord of the Vampires. The Abney Park song \\"Sleep Isabella\\" was used in a scene in the HBO series True Blood, Season 5 Episode 4.

Set in the post-apocalyptic world after their album, The End Of Days – a future world with a severely disrupted timeline – Airship Pirates features steampunk themes and Victorian-era style. Airship Pirates places players as air pirates in command of their own steam-powered airships. There they will seek not only to pillage the skies, but to plunder history, possibly causing even greater disruption to the past. Meanwhile, the world below struggles in Victorian- style squalor under an oppressive government that maintains control through clockwork policemen. In December 2011, the RPG game won Diehard GameFAN's \\"Best Core Rulebook of 2011\\" award.  Novels  In 2012, a novel was released entitled The Wrath of Fate: Book 1 of The Airship Pirate Chronicles, by Robert Brown. Set in a post-apocalyptic steampunk future, the book is a companion to Abney Park's music and RPG game, exploring Abney Park's backstory and fictional setting in greater detail. A second novel in the series, Retrograde, came out in 2013, followed by a third novel, \\"The Toyshop At The End Of The World\\", in 2015.

He is most remembered as the founder of the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in his native city. View of Monte Video, Seat of Daniel Wadsworth, Esq., oil on panel, 1828, Thomas Cole. Wadsworth Atheneum Early life and education Daniel Wadsworth was descended from some of the first Puritan settlers of the Connecticut colony. His father Jeremiah Wadsworth was one of the wealthiest men in Hartford, and his mother was also from an elite family. The senior Wadsworth was involved in trade, manufacturing, banking, and insurance. Young Daniel was educated partly at home; he was introduced to the great art and architecture of the royal courts of Europe by his father, who traveled there with him (see Grand tour).. Marriage and family Wadsworth married Faith Trumbull in 1794. He later became acquainted with her uncle, John Trumbull, one of the period’s most celebrated historical painters. Career Wadsworth was an accomplished amateur artist and architect. He took many trips with writer Benjamin Silliman and Trumbull to Niagara Falls and the White Mountains (New Hampshire) to write accounts and sketch the landscapes they saw. In later years, he became a patron of painters like Thomas Cole and advised he and others on itineraries for their own sketching expeditions. He played a formative role in the life and work of a fellow son of Hartford, Frederic Edwin Church, whose prodigious talent Wadsworth was among the first to recognize. A letter of introduction to Cole vouched for the astonishing natural ability of this young man and secured him the chance to live and study with Cole. This launched Church on a meteoric career that would see him become the most famous and financially successful artist in America. Determined to promote American artists, Wadsworth purchased the entire collection of the American Academy of the Fine Arts in New York. He then announced his plans to build \\"a Gallery of Fine Arts\\" on Main Street in Hartford, which would later be named after him. He provided many of the art objects initially displayed from his personal collection in addition to the ones from the American Academy.

He is currently the ICC High Performance Manager for the Americas Region. An express-pace bowler, Pick played county cricket for Nottinghamshire. He made his first-class debut against Hampshire in July 1983, returning first-innings figures of 20-3-101-0. During this match he also made his List A debut in the John Player League, taking 1-56 from eight overs, his victim being Mark Nicholas. Pick's maiden first-class wicket finally arrived in the second innings of his third game, when he dismissed Yorkshire's Martyn Moxon, but he ended the season with a dismal record of just seven first-class wickets. He received notoriety for his personal record pace of 95 mph. Pick had a better 1984 season, taking 25 wickets at an average of a shade under 31, and from then until 1995 he was a regular in the Nottinghamshire first team, amassing almost 750 wickets in all forms of the game. His best years came in the early 1990s: after a winter in New Zealand with Wellington during which he topped the bowling averages and helped Wellington to win the Shell Trophy, in 1990 he recorded his best bowling figures, 7-128 against Leicestershire, and that winter he travelled with the England A team, claiming 21 first-class wickets in Sri Lanka at just 17 runs apiece. He continued his good form in the summer, taking a career best 67 wickets in the English season. He again toured with England A to the West indies and Bermuda, playing in two of the three Tests. His final England experience came in 1996 when he represented England in the Hong Kong Sixes. In 1994, Pick hit his highest first-class score of 65 not out - batting at number ten - against Northamptonshire, but by this time his playing days were numbered, and his last appearances came in the 1997 season. He went wicketless in his final first-class game, against Yorkshire, but in one-day cricket he signed off in style, with 3-17 in a ten-wicket hammering of Staffordshire in the NatWest Trophy. He finished his playing career having been involved in teams that had won all the domestic honours. After retiring from top-level cricket, Pick played a handful of times for Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire before turning to coaching where he achieved his ECB Level 4 qualification, the games Elite Coaching Qualification. He coached the England Under-19 team in the 2004 & 2006 U-19 World Cup before being appointed by the Canadian Cricket Association in March 2006 to coach that country's national team in the run-up to the 2007 World Cup. Canada performed admirably against both England and New Zealand and scored over 200 in both games, the only Associate team to pass that figure. He also had two spells as Bowling Coach at Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club. After the World Cup both Pick and the Canadians tried to broker a deal for him to remain but in the end he returned to England, taking charge once again of the England Under-19 team to the 2008 ICC U19 World Cup. During his time as England U19 Coach he worked closely with Alistair Cook, Stuart Broad and Tim Bresnan, amongst others and during this time he established a reputation as a leading Fast Bowling Coach. In 2009 he left the England set up to become ICC High Performance Manager for the Americas Region. Pick is the brother-in-law of David Millns, and the two played in the same Nottinghamshire team on a number of occasions.

He has been nominated for Golden Globe and Emmy awards. Early life Newman was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of a Belarusian-born mother, Sarah (née Ostrovsky), and an Austrian father, Carl Newman. Newman graduated from the prestigious Boston Latin School in 1948. He was a childhood friend of actor Leonard Nimoy. After graduating from Brandeis University with a degree in Anthropology, Newman was drafted into the army and, having learned saxophone and clarinet in high school, he was assigned to the 3rd Army band in Atlanta Georgia. After being discharged, Newman went to New York to receive his master's degree in Anthropology from Columbia University, when a friend, who was studying acting with Lee Strasberg, invited him to sit in on a class. His destiny changed as he fell in love with acting and left Columbia University after only five weeks, to study acting with Strasberg. Career Newman's first acting job was in Herman Wouk's first comedy, Nature's Way, in which he played a jazz musician. Newman, coincidentally, played saxophone. For his work, Newman received his very first Broadway review, in which New York critic Richard Watts called him, \\"The creme of the Jesters\\". This was followed by a featured part in the play \\"Maybe Tuesday\\", written by Mel Tolkin, Sid Caesar's head writer, and Lucille Kallen, Imogene Coca's head writer. Newman then went on to star in the New York production of the longest running play on the British stage, Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap. After numerous parts on Broadway, including the musical What makes Sammy Run, Sidney Kingsley's Night Live, America Hurrah,, Newman went on to do TV and movies. While working at nights on Broadway in What Makes Sammy Run, Newman starred as attorney John Barnes in the daytime drama, The Edge of Night for two years. Earlier, Newman also co-starred in his first film, the gangster potboiler, Pretty Boy Floyd (1960), but he made his breakthrough with his first starring role in The Lawyer (1970), directed by Sidney Furie, for which Newman received critical acclaim. Newman then went on to star in the 1971 cult movie Vanishing Point, as Kowalski, followed by starring roles in 20th Century Studios's Salzburg Connection, and Paramount's Fear Is The Key. In 1974, Petrocelli, a TV series created around the character Newman first played in The Lawyer, debuted on NBC and ran two seasons. After Petrocelli, Newman starred in the film City On Fire with Henry Fonda and Ava Gardner, then in Disney's Amy. He starred or co- starred in more than twenty TV movies of the week, including ABC's King Crab, which won the ABC Theater Award. He also co-starred in several mini-series including NBC's Fatal Vision. Variety called Newman \\"The Spencer Tracy of the 80's\\". In 1989, Barry Newman starred with Suzanne Pleshette in the television series Nightingales, playing Dr. Garret Braden. Then, in the early 1990s, Newman went to London to star in the BBC's production of Miss Marple, The Mirror Cracked, with Claire Bloom. During the 1990s Newman went back to co- star in movies such as Daylight with Sylvester Stallone; Bowfinger, starring Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy; and in Steven Soderbergh's comeback movie The Limey, among others. =Vanishing Point= Director Richard C. Sarafian's original choice for the role of Kowalski was Gene Hackman but the studio, 20th Century Studios insisted on using Newman. The film was not initially a success in the United States when it first opened in 1971, but received critical acclaim and was a commercial success in Europe. Newman's success with the two hour TV film Night Games, based on the 1970 movie The Lawyer, led to the NBC TV series, Petrocelli, starring Newman as a compassionate big-city lawyer, living and working in the fictional town of San Remo, Arizona (filmed in Tucson, Arizona). He was nominated for an Emmy in 1975 for Outstanding Lead Actor In A Drama Series and, in 1976, for a Golden Globe.

This high western gate of the city wall is the largest surviving city gate in England. Built of Kentish ragstone around 1379, it is the last survivor of Canterbury's seven medieval gates, still well-preserved and one of the city's most distinctive landmarks. The road still passes between its drum towers. This scheduled monument and Grade I listed building houses the West Gate Towers Museum. History =4th–18th centuries= River Stour Canterbury was walled by the Romans around 300 AD. This has been consistently the most important of the city's gates as it is the London Road entrance and the main entrance from most of Kent. The present towers are a medieval replacement of the Roman west gate, rebuilt around 1380. There was a gate here at the time of the Norman conquest, which is thought to have been Roman. From late Anglo- Saxon times it had the Church of the Holy Cross on top, but both church and gate were dismantled in 1379, and the gate was rebuilt by Archbishop Simon Sudbury before he died in the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. It has been suggested that it was built primarily as an entrance for pilgrims visiting the shrine of St Thomas Becket at the cathedral. However the rebuild as a defensive status symbol was paid for partly by Sudbury and partly by taxation for military protection against expected raids by the French. In 1453 Henry VI permitted the Mayor and Commonality to keep a jail at the Westgate, so the building was Canterbury's prison from the 15th to the 19th century, while Canterbury Castle was the county jail. In January 1648, after the Christmas Day riot, Parliamentarians burnt down all the wooden doors of the city's gates. They were all replaced in 1660, but these replacements were removed at the end of the eighteenth century. They were similar to the surviving wooden Christ Church gates at the cathedral. After repairs to the Westgate and jail in 1667, a pound was built on the north side for the hail; this is now gone, but Pound Lane remains. The guard rooms, heavily wood-lined in the eighteenth century, became cells for both debtors and criminals, and the room over the arch became the condemned cell with the portcullis now laid on top. Until 1775 there was a grated cage in the prison gateway, where certain prisoners were allowed to beg for alms and speak with passers by. Capital punishment was normally the gallows, plus the stake at Wincheap for religious martyrs in the time of Queen Mary. =19th–21st centuries= Westgate Towers in the Edwardian era In the 19th century, the city walls that joined the gateway to the back of the drum towers were removed. Following this, in 1823–1829, a jailer's house was built on the north side, and this became the headquarters of Canterbury City Police. It is now a bar and cafe, whose dining room is still known as \\"The Parade Room\\", with a police truncheon used as its badge. The disused iron bridge which connects the Westgate with the bar and cafe dates from this time. Contemporary with this work was the building of St Peter's Place on the south side of the Westgate, along with passages around the Westgate and a new road across the Stour, to cope with increased traffic. At the end of the 19th century the Westgate was used as a temporary repository for the city archives, and a museum was opened in the gatehouse in 1906.Kentish Gazette and Canterbury Press, June 1906 In 2009–10, Canterbury City Council considered closing the museum, now called the Westgate Towers Museum, which proved to be a controversial option. An additional year's funding was made available to give time to examine alternative operating models, and in 2011 the museum was reopened by Charles Lambie, the chairman of the trustees of Canterbury Archaeological Trust, who intended to build an extension to the building focusing on the penal history of Westgate.Liz Crudgington, \\"Bitter debate over 'realistic' budget\\", Herne Bay Times (Kent Messenger), p.7, 25 February 2010 Lambie died in 2012, having invested £1 million in the project, causing the closure of the museum and generating fresh questions about the building's future. In 2014, the council agreed to assign the lease to the One Pound Lane company, who stated that they intended to reopen the existing museum and develop a restaurant and bar in the premises. The Westgate reopened to the public on 3 August 2015. In the 21st century, Westgate is the largest surviving city gate in England. The gateway is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building, and a trial to ban road traffic from passing through the gate was undertaken in 2012.Canterbury City Council Online St Dunstans and Westgate traffic management trial – 27 March 2012Kentish Gazette 17 November 2011 Plans to ban traffic from passing through Westgate Towers revealed, by Alex Claridge Architecture gunloop The gatehouse is expensively faced in coursed ashlar of Kentish ragstone. It has battered plinths to the drum towers, battlements, machicolations and eighteen gunloops: a high number for a gateway, and among the earliest gunholes in Britain. The gunloops would have been added by the beginning of the fifteenth century. It had a drawbridge over the Stour, a portcullis and wooden doors. The gateway has three floors. The ground floor was designed so that the gateway and vaulted passage had entrances to the towers on each side. Each tower had a ground-floor room with fireplace and four gunloops. The north tower's ground-floor room had a spiral staircase to upper floors. The first floor contains a large room with fireplace and, originally, the portcullis mechanism over the vaulted entranceway. This room had doors to the upper room of each tower, each with fireplace and three gunloops, and a northern door to a spiral staircase leading to the roof. Repairs were carried out due to an invasion scare during the 1470s and 1480s. In 1491 or 1492 a large, two-light, transomed, perpendicular east window was added to the large first-floor room, with a view towards the cathedral and along St Peter's Street. The roof over the large first-floor central room has a battlemented parapet walk, originally with access to the tops of both towers and machicolations, as well as to the two low chambers, each with two gunports, in the tops of both towers. This part of the tower was less well-built than the lower storeys, either due to haste during the Peasants' Revolt or because it was built later. In 1793−1794 the hall over the gate was split into three and the present square lantern added to the roof, along with the wooden doors and cell linings which are visible today; the cost was £400. Museum exhibits These are 17 six-foot, painted, plaster-cast maquettes for the sixteen bronze barons and two bishops which today stand in the Lords Chamber at Westminster Palace; cast in 1847−1851. These were made by various named sculptors, and represent the men who signed Magna Carta: each of the fifteen barons and two bishops is named at the base. In 1908 three of the maquettes were displayed in the museum (see photo below), and two remain on show. The rest were put in storage and forgotten in the ground floor room of the north tower in 1987, along with several other museum exhibits, before being brought to the attention of museum staff in May 2008 after the building was flooded. The City of Canterbury museums department was said to have been attempting to remove them to safety for restoration, but was inhibited by logistics and funding.Information from records at the Museum of Canterbury As of May 2011, ten of the maquettes in the basement have been photographed; the fate of the remaining five is unknown. The sculptors of the maquettes are as follows: John Evan Thomas who made the maquette of Stephen Langton, as of 2013 in Canterbury Heritage Museum; Patrick MacDowell; Henry Timbrell; James Sherwood Westmacott; J. Thorneycroft (possibly Thomas Thornycroft); Frederick Thrupp; Alexander Handyside Ritchie; and William Frederick Woodington.

Called \\"the most original and far-ranging theorist of his generation\\" , he did his most influential theoretical work on the development of transformational theory, which involves the application of mathematical group theory to music. Biography Lewin was born in New York City and studied piano from a young age and was for a time a pupil of Eduard Steuermann. He graduated from Harvard in 1954 with a degree in mathematics. Lewin then studied theory and composition with Roger Sessions, Milton Babbitt, Edward Cone, and Earl Kim at Princeton University, earning an M.F.A. in 1958. He returned to Harvard as a Junior Fellow in the Harvard Society of Fellows from 1958 to 1961. After holding teaching positions at the University of California, Berkeley (1961–67), the State University of New York at Stony Brook (1967–79), and Yale University (1979–85), he returned to Harvard as the Walter W. Naumburg Professor of Music in 1985. Lewin was a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship grantee in 1983–84, served as the president of the Society for Music Theory from 1985 to 1988 and was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He received honorary doctoral degrees from the University of Chicago in 1995, from the New England Conservatory of Music in 2000, and posthumously from Université Marc Bloch de Strasbourg, France, in 2006. Composition While Lewin is primarily known as a theorist, he was also an active composer who wrote works for a wide range of forces, from solo voice to full orchestra. In 1961, he became the first professional musician to compose a computer-generated piece at Bell Laboratories . Criticism Lewin's theoretical work may best be understood against his background in 1950/60s avant-garde compositional circles on the North American East Coast. Most of those composers, such as Benjamin Boretz, Edward T. Cone, and Milton Babbitt, were also music critics and theorists/analysts. During the late 1970s, Lewin's work in this area became more explicitly concerned with issues in literary theory; he published articles in 19th-Century Music. Studies in Music with Text, published posthumously, demonstrates Lewin's concerns in this area while also synthesizing his critical/theoretical methods. Theory David Lewin's work in music theory was both influential and eclectic. Broadly, his writings can be divided into three overlapping groups: formal or mathematically based theory, more interpretive writing on the interaction of music and text, and metatheoretical discussions on the methodology and purpose of contemporary music theory (e.g. and ). The first group includes his innovations in transformational theory, as expressed in numerous articles and in his treatise Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations. In this work, Lewin applied group theory to music, investigating the basic concepts, interval and transposition, and extending them beyond their traditional application to pitch. Based on a powerful metaphor of musical space, this theory can be applied to pitch, rhythm and metre, or even timbre. Moreover, it can be applied to both tonal and atonal repertories . Lewin's writing on the relationship between text and music in song and opera involves composers from Mozart and Wagner, to Schoenberg and Babbitt. In one interesting example, \\"Music Analysis as Stage Direction,\\" he discusses how structural aspects of the music can suggest dramatic interpretations. Important writings for the discipline of music theory include \\"Behind the Beyond\\" (1968–9), a response to Edward Cone, and \\"Music Theory, Phenomenology, and Modes of Perception\\" (1986). Lewin also undertakes considerable methodological and disciplinary reflection in writings that are chiefly oriented around other claims. This aspect of Lewin's intellectual style is evident as early as \\"A Theory of Segmental Association in Twelve-Tone Music\\" (1962). Lewin often makes clear which dense sections can be skipped by readers unfamiliar with mathematics, and connects his abstract theory to practical musical considerations, such as performance and music perception. For example, in Musical Form and Transformation: Four Analytic Essays, Lewin provides ear-training exercises to develop an ability to hear more difficult musical relationships. Posthumously, in 2003, a symposium on David Lewin's theories was conducted at the Mannes Institute for Advanced Studies in Music Theory. Lewin's papers are now held at the Library of Congress.

Biography Wiechert's birthplace and childhood home Wiechert was born in the village of Kleinort, East Prussia, (now Piersławek, Poland). He was one of the most widely read novelists in Germany during the 1930s. He incorporated his humanist ideals in his novels among which Das einfache Leben (The simple Life, 1939) and Die Jeromin-Kinder (The Jeromin children, 1945/47) are the best known today. Wiechert was strongly opposed to Nazism from the start. He appealed in 1933 and 1935 to the undergraduates in Munich to retain their critical thinking in relation to the national socialist ideology. This was rated as call to internal resistance. The minutes of the speech circulated illegally in Germany and reached Moscow in 1937 baked in bread. Here it was published in the influential exile magazine Das Wort (The Word). But Wiechert went even further and dared to openly criticize the imprisonment of Martin Niemöller by the Nazis in 1938. He was arrested shortly after the rigged plebiscite by which Germany absorbed Austria in April 1938.MacDonogh, G. 1938: Hitler's Gamble. New York: Basic Books, 2009. p 106. In consequence of his criticism, he was interned in the Buchenwald concentration camp for four months. He wrote down his memories about his imprisonment and buried the manuscript; it was published in 1945 as Der Totenwald (Forest of the dead). After the war, Wiechert was a critic of West German society. In 1948 he settled in Stäfa, Switzerland, where he died in August 1950 of cancer. He was buried in Stäfa.

During his career he played safety for the Houston Oilers and the Cleveland Browns. Bostic served as the Oiler defensive captain under Jerry Glanville. He earned one Pro Bowl selection and missed another based on a tiebreaker for the last safety chosen. In his Pro Bowl season, he led the American Football Conference in interceptions. Prior to playing in the NFL, he played for the Michigan Wolverines football team of the Big Ten Conference from 1979–1982 NCAA Division I-A football season. During this time Michigan won two Big Ten Conference Championships and Bostic was named first team All- Big Ten. While at Michigan, he accumulated fumble recovery and interception statistics that continue to rank among the leaders in school history. Bostic had a reputation as a very physical safety.  College  Rose Bowls. Born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Bostic starred at his hometown Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor. He then stayed in Ann Arbor to play for the University of Michigan where he earned four varsity letters in football from 1979-1982 while wearing the #13. In college at the University of Michigan, Bostic started eight games in 1980, and he had an interception in the January 1, 1981 Rose Bowl for the 1980 Big Ten Conference Champions. This game was the first bowl game victory for Bo Schembechler. He started eleven games in 1981 and twelve in 1982. Bostic was first team All-Big Ten for the 1982 Big Ten Champions who also went to the Rose Bowl. When he was drafted into the NFL, he was second on the modern Michigan career interceptions list (since 1965) with ten career interceptions, which places him in a tie for seventh on the list now. He ranks tenth on the All-time list. He ranks second on the All-time single-season fumble recovery list with four and fourth on the career list with six. His 119 interception return yards in 1982 ranks fifth all-time.  Professional career  = Pre-Bostic Oilers = During the 1970s Bum Phillips had traded away draft picks for veterans several times and between the 1974 NFL Draft and the 1981 NFL Draft the team only had four first round picks, but reached the AFC Championship game twice during the decade with veterans. They went to the playoffs in 1980 as well. However, by 1981 they were below .500 with an aging team. From the 1982 NFL Draft to the 1987 NFL Draft they had nine first round choices. They complemented their drafting with the signing of Warren Moon out of the Canadian Football League and Mike Rozier out of the United States Football League (USFL), a league that attempted to compete with the NFL in the 1980s. = Biles, Studley, Campbell era = Bostic was drafted with the fourteenth pick of the second round of the 1983 NFL Draft with the 42nd pick overall by the Houston Oilers. He was also drafted by the Michigan Panthers of the United States Football League (USFL) in the 1983 Territorial Draft. Bostic joined the Oilers who were rebuilding from being the oldest average age NFL team in 1981. Bostic started the last 12 games of the 1983 NFL season and every game thereafter as an Oiler until leaving the team in 1989. The 1983 Houston Oilers under coaches Ed Biles and Chuck Studley went 2–14. The 1984 and 1985 teams of Hugh Campbell also were below .500. By 1985 he had nonetheless become one of the best safeties in the league. During the 1985 NFL season he had a career-high five quarterback sacks, three interceptions and a fumble recovery. = Glanville era = Bostic's physical style of play was well-suited for Jerry Glanville who took over the Oilers' head coaching job for the 1986 NFL season after having been the team's defensive coordinator. Bostic signed a contract extension before the 1987 NFL season. Then, Bostic earned a Pro Bowl birth in 1987 and was named second-team All-Pro the same season. During the 1987 season he finished second in the NFL with a career- high six interceptions. That total led the American Football Conference (AFC), and he added three quarterback sacks and a fumble recovery that season. Glanville took the team to both the 1987-88 and 1988-89 NFL Playoffs. The unheralded 1987 team was a surprise playoff entrant in the first round Wild Card game. Even after a surprise 1987–88 NFL playoff run the Oilers fired their defensive backs coach, Tom Bettis who had taken over from Ken Houston. Bostic earned All-Pro honorable mention in 1988. That season, he finished tied for the third and final AFC safety Pro Bowl spot with David Fulcher and missed being invited due to the tiebreaker. With all the rebuilding turnover Bostic was one of the four longest tenured Oilers by his sixth season with the team. He started 88 consecutive non-strike games for the Oilers. He was replaced by Bubba McDowell as the Oilers' starting strong safety. In 1989, the Oilers became fed up with Bostic for his untimely penalties and his moody and unpredictable personality. The Indianapolis Colts signed Bostic as a plan B free agent to a two-year $900,000 contract, but released him during training camp. They released him during the second week of training camp and it was rumored he might head to the Los Angeles Raiders. The Oilers lost a league high fifteen plan B free agents that season. In 1990, the Cleveland Browns signed Bostic as a free agent. However, they waived him during the season. = Overall reputation = Bostic's physical style of play was respected by his peers: Lester Hayes said Raider tight end Todd Christensen is the best receiving tight end and that \\"The only guy I've ever seen cover Todd is my son, Keith Bostic...Bostic's the only guy I've ever seen pulverize him. I mean he really pulverized him. I call Bostic and Frank Minnifield (Cleveland cornerback) my sons, my sons of dirt.\\" Hayes meant that Bostic and Minnifield played a physical style, just like Hayes. Bostic is known as a big hitter blessed with athletic ability. He combined strength and speed to play his physical style according to Ozzie Newsome: \\"He's as strong as any linebacker and can run like any of the guys on the corner.\\" Bostic earned the nickname \\"Batman\\" for his style of play. Instead of instructing his team to elect captains, Glanville instructed his team to \\"...pick the three toughest guys. If somebody throws a grenade into a room, they're the ones who'll jump on it.\\" Bostic was the player chosen from the Oilers' defense. Although much is made of his strength and toughness, it should also be mentioned that he once collared Tony Dorsett from behind in a footrace. At one point in Bostic's career, while Glanville was still defensive coordinator, the Oilers considered moving him to cornerback because of his speed. = NFL Single Season Record = Fewest interception return yards (1987): -14  Personal  During the offseasons, Bostic was a regular on the Oilers' summer basketball team that traveled around the state raising money for charities by playing various local All-star teams. After the team's twelfth season, Bostic had a reputation as the best player ever to play for the team. During one NFL training camp Bostic played with tape over his mouth to try to win a $20 bet with Steve Brown over who could keep from talking the longest. His son, Tony Bostic, played running back for the New Mexico State Aggies as a non-recruited walk-on. His nephew, Nigel Bostic was a promising college football player who won a scholarship to Oklahoma State but was later arrested for gun trafficking.

History In the 10th century, King Ordoño III of León donated the Vila de Moraria (Moreira de Rei) and Monte Longo to the monastery of Guimarães, founded by the Countess Mumadona. The territory was effect the Diocese of Braga in the 12th century, and was one of the largest of the seven dioceses, with approximately 950 to 1000 civil parishes divided into 38 group. During the 1220 Inquirições (Inquiries), the territory of Monte Longo was first identified. This location would have an effect; in 1258, the municipality was designated as the lands and julgado (judicial territory) of Monte Longo. By 1320, Fafe was part of the Diocese of Braga and the Terra de Entre Ave e Vizela, also known as the Terra de Montelongo, with 15 parochia, among which Santa Ovaia Antiga (Santa Eulália de Fafe). On 15 November 1514, King D. Manuel I conceded the first foral (charter) to the town of Fafe. The 1527 Numeramento de D. João III (census of King John III), the parish of Samta Ovaya Antigua (Santa Eulália) had only 64 neighbours. It was only in 1647 that the first reference to the toponymy Fafe, and shortly thereafter (1655) the parish adopted the name Santa Eulália de Fafe. In 1706, the donatário of the town of Fafe and municipality of Montelongo was the Count of Vimieiro. By mid- century, though, in 1758, the Memórias Paroquiais (Parochial Memories) described that the donation was attributed to the Marquis of Valença, D. Miguel de Portugal e Castro.

It followed an ultra right-wing nationalistic ideology and had the ultimate goal of achieving the Enosis (union) of Cyprus with Greece. During its short history, the organisation's chief aim was to block any attempt to enforce upon the Cyprus people what the organisation considered to be an unacceptable settlement to the Cyprus issue. In addition, the organisation drafted various plans to overthrow President Makarios. The organisation continued its activities until it officially declared its dissolution and disbanded on February 11, 1978. Due to its attacks on civilians, it was considered a terrorist organization and was outlawed by the Republic of Cyprus. Among the attacks it is responsible for is the Maratha, Santalaris and Aloda massacre. EOKA-B members were also arrested for the kidnapping of the son of president Spyros Kyprianou. and for being involved in the assassination of US ambassador Rodger Paul Davies. Homicide charges were dropped on June 4, 1977 by a Cypriot court against the two men accused of killing the ambassador. According to the Washington Post's renowned 1970s Cyprus correspondent, Joseph W Fitchett, EOKA-B members were \\"motivated by a mixture of patriotism, money and macho\\". Formation EOKA-B was founded by General George Grivas as his last organizational attempt before his death on January 17, 1974. Grivas, a stridently anti-communist military leader during the Greek Civil War, was among the founders of EOKA in the early 50s. After the declaration of independent Cyprus state he took over the Supreme Command of the Greek Cypriot forces organised under the National Guard as well as the Greek military division in early 60s. Following Turkey's ultimatum of November 1967 he was recalled by the Greek Junta to Athens, only to return under cover in 1971. After Grivas returned to Cyprus in 1971, he created EOKA-B in response to President Archbishop Makarios' deviation from the policy of enosis in 1959 and the reaffirmation of this position during his re- election in 1968. Grivas, along with his new EOKA-B organisation, attempted to forcefully oust Makarios in order to enact his original goal of enosis with Greece. Whereas EOKA (1955–59) were seen by the majority of the Greek Cypriots as anti-colonialist freedom fighters, the EOKA-B did not have the overwhelming support of the Greek Cypriot population, as Makarios had called an election after a failed assassination attempt on him and his coalition won 27 out of the 35 seats.O'Malley, Brandan and Craig. Ian. The Cyprus Conspiracy, Pub. I.B. Tauris, London , 1999. p. 137. The main supporters of EOKA B were pro- enosis supporters who won 7 seats in the previous election, old EOKA fighters who felt they never received the recognition that they deserved after the revolt, right wing military personnel and some pro-enosis elements of the Church of Cyprus. The only armed, organized resistance to EOKA-B came from the \\"Efedriko\\", a special police force set up by Makarios and the members of the Socialist Party EDEK as well as armed supporters of Makarios in every town. The Communist Party AKEL, despite the mild verbal opposition to EOKA-B, had not organized any form of resistance against it.  Coup d'etat and Turkish invasion  When Grivas Digenis died from heart failure on 27 January 1974, the post-Grivas EOKA-B increasingly came under the direct control and influence of the military junta in Athens. EOKA-B was on the verge of dissolution by July 1974. Yet on July 15, 1974 the Greek dictator Dimitrios Ioannides used the National Guard which was led by Greek officers and consisted of Greek-Cypriot conscripts, and EOKA-B to launch a military coup. EOKA-B attempted to assassinate Makarios but failed, and he fled to London. Nikos Sampson was installed as the new president of Cyprus. This action provoked a Turkish invasion of Cyprus on July 20, 1974, leading to the subsequent de facto division of the island. Ioannides was taken by surprise by the Turkish invasion and failed to convince or coerce the Greek generals to send military reinforcements to Cyprus. The subsequent toppling of the Greek Junta led to Sampson's resignation on 23 July 1974. On 14 August 1974, Turkey mounted a second invasion into Cyprus. By the end of hostilities, about 180,000 Greek Cypriots (almost one third of the population), were forcibly uprooted from their homes and properties, while 80,000 Turkish Cypriots were forced north. Thousands more were killed or listed as missing. = Atrocities on 14 August 1974 = On 14 August, during the invasion, EOKA-B committed massacres and crimes against Turkish-Cypriots in Maratha, Santalaris, Aloda, Tochni and Kiti. They massacred 84 Turkish-Cypriot men and boys from the village of Tochni, leaving one survivor. 126 were killed in the villages of Maratha, Santalaris and Aloda. = Later testimony = On April 17, 1991, Ambassador Nelson Ledsky testified before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee that \\"most of the 'missing persons' disappeared in the first days of July 1974, before the Turkish invasion on the 20th. Many killed on the Greek side were killed by Greek Cypriots in fighting between supporters of Makarios and Sampson.\\"Paul Sant Cassia, Bodies of Evidence: Burial, Memory, and the Recovery of Missing Persons in Cyprus, Berghahn Books, 2007, , a result of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus of July 20, 1974 2,500 Greek Cypriots died in fighting or as a result of war crimes by the Turkish army or Turkish Cypriot extremists, 500 T/C in fighting and as result of atrocities of Greek Cypriot extremists and around 500 Turkish troops (The Tragic Duel and the Betrayal of Cyprus-Marios Adamides-2011).ei=7sBsTM- vJ8nJcbPU_G8&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=4&ved;=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q;=Aloa&f;=false p. 237. .

Underground wine cave of the Rutherford Hill winery in Napa County, California. Wine caves are subterranean structures for the storage and the aging of wine. They are an integral component of the wine industry worldwide. The design and construction of wine caves represents a unique application of underground construction techniques. The storage of wine in extensive underground space is an extension of the culture of wine cellar rooms, both offering the benefits of energy efficiency and optimum use of limited land area. Wine caves naturally provide both high humidity and cool temperatures, which are key to the storage and aging of wine. History The history of wine cave construction in the United States dates back to the 1860s in Sonoma, and the 1870s in the Napa Valley region. In 1857, Agoston Harazsthy founded Buena Vista Winery and in 1862, Buena Vista Winery's Press House was completed, and in 1864, a second building now called the Champagne Cellars was completed. In total, Buena Vista Winery had five caves among the two buildings in operation in 1864. Jacob Schram, a German immigrant and barber, founded Schramsberg Vineyards near Calistoga, California in 1862. Eight years later, Schram found new employment for the Chinese laborers who had recently finished constructing tunnels and grades over the Sierra Nevada Mountains for the Union Pacific Transcontinental Railroad. He hired them to dig a network of caves through the soft Sonoma Volcanics Formation rock underlying his vineyard. Another Chinese workforce took time away from their regular vineyard work to excavate a labyrinth of wine-aging caves beneath the Beringer Vineyards near St. Helena, California. These caves exceeded 1,200 ft (365 m) long, 17 ft (5 m) wide and 7 ft (2 m) high. The workers used pick-axes and shovels – and on occasion, chisel steel, double jacks and black powder – to break the soft rock. They worked by candlelight, and removed the excavated material in wicker baskets. At least 12 wine storage caves were constructed by these methods. From the late 19th century to the early 1970s, the development of wine caves went through a long period of “dark ages.” No new caves were built, and many existing caves were abandoned or fell into disrepair. A “renaissance” of cave building began in 1972 when Alf Burtleson Construction started the rehabilitation of the old Beringer wine caves, and was followed by the design and construction of new caves. In 1982, the Far Niente Winery completed the first of these “new age” wine caves in the Napa Valley AVA. The cave was only 60 ft (18 m) long and was used exclusively to age the wine and to store empty barrels. In 1991, 1995, and 2001, the caves were expanded. New rooms and storage areas were added, featuring different crown heights and intriguing shapes. An octagonal room was constructed for a wine library and a round domed room was added in the complex’s center. Far Niente Winery caves now encompass about 40,000 sq ft (3,700 m²). In 1991, Condor Earth Technologies Inc. joined with Alf Burtleson on the design and construction of the elaborate Jarvis Wine Cave project. Over 45,000 sq ft (4,200 m²) of underground winery and cave space was constructed, with cave spans exceeding 85 ft (25.5 m) in width. At Jarvis, the entire winery is contained within the tunneled areas, including crushing, fermentation, barrel storage, bottling, lab, office, marketing, and hospitality areas. These caves are open for public tours by appointment. Humidity High humidity minimizes evaporation. Wine makers consider humidity over 75% for reds and over 85% for whites to be ideal for wine aging and barrel storage. Humidity in wine caves ranges naturally from 70 to 90%. In Northern California, wine barrel evaporation in a surface warehouse is on the order of 4 gallons (15.1 liters) per each 60 gallon (227 liter) barrel per year. In a wine cave, barrel evaporation is reduced to about 1 gallon (3.8 liters) per barrel per year. Since red wines are usually barreled and aged for two years, this represents a 10% gross volume loss difference. For white wines, which are barreled and aged for about one year, a 5% loss difference is realized, a significant savings. Temperature The wine industry has long considered a constant temperature between 55 °F and 60 °F (13.0 °C and 15.5 °C) to be optimal for wine storage and aging. The air temperatures in Northern California result in a uniform underground temperature of about 58 °F (14.5 °C), optimal for wine caves. A surface warehouse requires energy to cool, heat, and humidify. While the most basic wine cave can cost over $100 per sq ft to construct, reduced energy costs result in a net savings over the long term. Land use In the Napa-Sonoma wine growing region, as in many areas of California, land values are high. Non-agricultural development is often restricted. A storage warehouse reduces the land available to grow grapes, impacts open space and natural habitats, and precludes other land uses. Land- use regulation in California places limitations on the types and locations of land development. Many land use restrictions and permitting requirements do not apply to underground space. As of 2004, there were an estimated 130 to 150 caves used for wine aging, barrel storage, and tasting rooms in Northern California. Marketing Marketing is an important component of the modern wine industry, and many caves serve varied marketing and public relations functions. Recently constructed caves contain commercial and private kitchens, wine libraries, concert and exhibit halls, staff offices, elevators, restrooms, and other amenities. Some have high-end interiors, including ceramic and stone flooring, masonry-lined walls and ceilings, sculpture and artwork, mood lighting, fountains, waterfalls, and chandeliers. At Stag's Leap Wine Cellars, a Foucault pendulum swings continuously across a bed of black sand in the central exhibit hall. Wine cave construction The challenge for the design and construction of most wine caves is to create a fairly wide span in weak rock with low cover. The size of a typical wine barrel storage cave is 13 to 18 ft (4 to 5.5 m) wide and 10 to 13 ft (3 to 4 m) high. Constructed caves, however, range up to 85 ft (30 m) in width and 50 ft (15 m) in height; difficult to achieve in poor quality rock. In areas of complex geology, good portal sites are hard to find. A typical wine cave is constructed with two or more portal sites, for safety and operational reasons. At least one portal leads directly outside, but in many cases at least one portal makes a direct connection to a winery building. The wine cave at Schramsberg Vineyards in Napa Valley AVA. Most portals into the wine caves have rock/soil overburden heights less than 0.2 times their entrance heights and widths. The height of the portal face normally ranges from 12 to 20 ft (3.5 to 6 m). The portal areas are seldom stripped of the loose soil material and the portals are cut from the native ground surface using excavators. The side slopes of the portal are often laid back to 0.5H:1V or steeper, and the portal face is excavated to vertical or near vertical. The construction of cave interiors can be complicated by the elaborate curves and labyrinth-style floor plans selected by some owners for their wine caves. As the ground surface slopes upward, providing more cover and usually sounder rock, caves can accommodate multiple drifts. Where possible, the cave is designed and constructed to provide at least 1.2 times their width of cover at intersections. Room and pillar layouts, similar to underground mine design, provide an economical construction arrangement. Tunnel legs are usually 30 to 100 ft (9 to 30 m) in length and pillars are typically a minimum of 20 ft (6 m) wide. On most occasions, the New Austrian Tunneling Method (single or multiple face), also known now as Sequential Excavation Method (SEM), with minor innovative technology advances, is used to excavate and support wine caves. The caves are typically excavated in an inverted horseshoe shape with a crown radius and with straight or curved legs. The tunnels are usually excavated using a tunnel roadheader or a milling head attachment on an excavator. The spoils behind the roadheader conveyor belt are dumped on the invert and mucked out using a rubber-tired skid loader or a load-haul-dump (LHD) mining machine. Initially, the excavation advance is likely to be limited to 2 ft (0.6 m) without initial ground support. Once turned under, and depending on ground conditions, the unsupported advance may be increased to 4 ft (1.2 m), 6 ft (1.8 m), and longer increments. The maximum advance without initial ground support may reach 20 ft (6 m) or more in stable volcanic ash tuff. In sheared serpentinite, deeply weathered lava rock or wet clayey ground, however, unstable ground conditions may limit the unsupported advance to less than 2 ft (0.6 m). Shotcrete reinforcement and ground support is utilized at the tunnel portals and in the interior of the wine caves. At the portals, soil nail and shotcrete walls are typically used for permanent support and are constructed from the top down in lifts. Soil nails are installed 4 to 6 ft (1.2 to 1.8 m) apart in the horizontal and vertical directions. The shotcrete is typically a minimum of 6 inches (15 cm) thick and reinforced with welded wire fabric. The typical 4,000 psi (28 MPa) design strength mix is applied using the wet process. Within the caves, the initial ground support is usually fiber-reinforced shotcrete. A minimum of 2 inches (5 cm) thickness of wet mix shotcrete is applied around the exposed ground perimeter following each day’s advance. As cave dimensions and ground conditions require, additional layers of shotcrete and welded wire fabric follow on subsequent days. The shotcrete mix is a 4,000 psi (28 MPa) compressive strength design. In some cases, pattern or spot rock bolts are also installed. Where wider and taller halls are used, modeling is employed to assist with the liner design. Interior finishing of the caves is an integral part of the construction process. Waterproofing details are important for the interiors of wine caves. Wet spots and water seeps are unsightly, and can cause maintenance and safety problems. Moisture vapor migration through the cave liner, however, is desirable to maintain humidity. After the cave complex has been completely excavated, waterproofed, and initially supported, a 2 inches (5 cm) thickness of final shotcrete or plain/colored gunite is applied to the walls and arch. Utility conduits and piping are encased within the final layer of shotcrete in the walls and arch and placed under the concrete floor slab. Reinforced concrete slabs are usually 6 in. (15 cm) thick and are underlain by subdrain. To support their varied uses, wine cave complexes may contain as many as 13 different utility systems. These include systems for hot and cold domestic water and processing water, electric power, lighting, sound and water features, battery emergency power, compressed gas systems, communications and radio relays, automatic ventilation, and computerized sensors and climate controls.

He was a two-time AFL All-Star. Bramlett served as a minister before his death. Bramlett was an All-State and All-American at Humes High School in Memphis and played college football at Memphis State University (now the University of Memphis), where he was named an honorable mention All-American his senior year. Bramlett signed a professional baseball contract with the St. Louis Cardinals, but was kicked out of baseball after a few years after getting into trouble. Bramlett then signed a contract with the Denver Broncos and was named runner-up AFL Rookie of the year behind Joe Namath in 1965. Bramlett only lasted two seasons with the Broncos, making one appearance in the Pro Bowl before being traded to the Miami Dolphins for a fourth-round pick in the 1968 NFL Draft. He played two seasons with Miami, making another Pro Bowl appearance, before being traded to the Patriots along with quarterback Kim Hammond in exchange for Nick Buoniconti in 1969. With the Patriots, Bramlett was named the Most Valuable Player for the team in 1970, but also got in more trouble and was nicknamed the \\"Meanest Man in Football.\\" . Bramlett was then traded to the Green Bay Packers for Rich Moore.Milwaukee Journal, \\"Packers Trade Moore for Linebacker\\", July 31, 1971, page 12. However, he balked at reporting to Green BayBud Lea, \\"New Packer Bramlett Refuses To Report\\", Milwaukee Sentinel, August 2, 1971, p. 8. and was released by the Packers before the 1971 season.Terry Bledsoe, \\"Packer Releases Reflect Second Thoughts By Coaches\\", Milwaukee Journal, September 14, 1971, p. 11.

Post- football career In 1973, Bramlett became a Christian and abandoned his wild lifestyle. He was active in Christian ministry for many years. He resided in Memphis with his wife, Nancy, until his death. He had two sons, Don and Andy. His ministry was John Bramlett Ministries. Larry Csonka and Jim Kiick, who were rookies on the Dolphins in 1968, tell several amusing stories about Bramlett in their book Always on the Run.Larry Csonka and Jim Kiick, with Dave Anderson, Always on the Run, pp.147-154.

Biography Horowitz was born to Jewish immigrant, working-class parents in The Bronx, New York. She was orphaned in 1962 at the age of 15. Believing that the only hope she might have for a decent life was education, thanks to the lucky combination of a free higher education offered to academically-qualified New York City residents and her father's Social Security payments, she was able to earn a bachelor's degree in political science from Hunter College in 1967. [She went on to earn a master's degree from Rutgers University in 1993.] In 1968 she moved to Washington, D.C. and worked in a series of low-level jobs on Capitol Hill, including staff assistant to an education subcommittee in the House of Representatives. Frustrated by lack of job advancement and the overt acceptance of discrimination against women, she helped organize other women on Capitol Hill and helped to launch the first survey comparing employment practices and salary differentials between male and female employees. Asked to become an original member of the Legislative Core of the then-fledgling National Women's Political Caucus, she gave a workshop on legislative process at the NWPC's initial organizing conference in Wichita, Kansas in 1973. In Backlash Susan Faludi explains, \\"[t]he woman who first proposed WEEA wasn't even one of those 'radical feminists' from NOW; Arlene Horowitz was a clerical worker in a congressional office, a working woman who understood from personal experience —trying to live off her skimpy paycheck— that unequal schooling could have painful and long-term consequences.\\" Horowitz was threatened by dismissal for her activism in the women's movement. Using a $70 portable typewriter and her legislative knowledge gained in Congress, she worked nights and weekends to draft what was to become the Women's Educational Equity Act. She authored the Women's Educational Equity Act (WEEA) enacted as part of P.L. 93-380. She was cited in the July 30, 1974 Congressional Record by Congresswoman Patsy T. Mink for \\"diligent and able work.\\" and listed on the National Women's History Project Path of the Women's Rights Movement for 1974. First documented in National Politics and Sex Discrimination in Education by Andrew Fishel and Janice Pottker in 1977, the WEEA has been funded by Congress to the present day.

It was the first LGBT rights organization in history.. Revised edition published 1995, . History The WhK was founded on 15 May 1897 (four days before Oscar Wilde's release from prison) by Magnus Hirschfeld, a Jewish-German physician, sexologist and outspoken advocate for gender and sexual minorities. Original members of the WhK included physician Magnus Hirschfeld, publisher Max Spohr, lawyer Eduard Oberg and writer Franz Joseph von Bülow. Adolf Brand, Benedict Friedländer, and Kurt Hiller also joined the organisation. A split happened in 1903. In 1929, Hiller took over as chairman of the group from Hirschfeld. At its peak, the WhK had about 500 members, and branches in approximately 25 cities in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. Vita homosexualis, a 1902 collection of August Fleischmann's popular pamphlets on third gender and against §175 - a Wissenschaftlich- humanitäres Komitee library copy, confiscated on 6 May 1933, annotated on the endpaper: By Reichspräsident's decree of 28.02.1933 destined for destruction! and hidden from the publique (label \\"Secr.\\") as Nazi plunder by the Prussian State Library. This book, and other that may have survived the destruction of the Wissenschaftlich-humanitäres Komitee and the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft, are sought after by the Magnus-Hirschfeld-Gesellschaft in Berlin. The committee was based in the Institute for Sexual Sciences in Berlin, until 1933 when it was destroyed by the Nazis, from which it took a great deal of scientific theories on human sexuality – such as the idea of a third sex between a man and a woman. The initial focus of the committee was to repeal Paragraph 175, an anti-gay piece of legislation of the Imperial Penal Code, which criminalized \\"coitus-like\\" acts between males, and the goal of this categorization of human sexuality was to demonstrate the innateness of homosexuality and thus make the criminal law against male-male gay sex in Germany at the time inapplicable. The committee also assisted defendants in criminal trials, conducted public lectures, and gathered signatures on a petition for the repeal of the law. Signatories included Albert Einstein, Hermann Hesse, Thomas Mann, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Leo Tolstoy. Petitions were submitted to parliament, in 1898, 1922 and 1925, but failed to gain the support of the parliament, and the law continued to criminalise all male-male sexual acts until 1969 and wasn't entirely removed in West Germany until four years after East and West Germany became one country, in 1994. Although it never had more than 500 members, it is considered an important milestone in the homosexual emancipation movement. Publications It produced the Jahrbuch für sexuelle Zwischenstufen (Yearbook for Intermediate Sexual Types). This, as well as reporting the committee's activities, carried articles of scientific, polemical and literary natures. It was published regularly from 1899 to 1923 (sometimes quarterly) and more sporadically until 1933. This publication was the world's first scientific journal dealing with sexual variants. It was published until 1923. The studies published by the Yearbook range from articles about homosexuality among \\"primitive\\" people to literary analyses and case studies. Reformation attempts In October 1949, Hans Giese joined with Hermann Weber (1882–1955), head of the Frankfurt local group from 1921 to 1933, to re-establish the group in Kronberg. Kurt Hiller worked with them briefly, but stopped due to personal differences after a few months. The group was dissolved in late 1949 or early 1950 and instead formed the Committee for Reform of the Sexual Criminal Laws (Gesellschaft für Reform des Sexualstrafrechts e.

They will go over their side of the argument without considering the alternative arguments. Introduction Self- propaganda is a form of propaganda and indoctrination performed by an individual or a group on oneself. It functions at individual and social levels: political, economic, and religious. It hides behind partial truths and ignores questions of critical thought. The psychological process of utilizing self-propaganda can negatively influence values and beliefs,Paul M. Salkovskis (1997) Frontiers of cognitive therapy pp 101. Guilford Press Retrieved 2010 May 17 and subsequent perceptions and judgments, thus becoming a self- fulfilling prophecy. Self-propaganda can also be a form of self-deception. Those whose values match the self deceptions are even further impacted. Confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance can cause people to further perpetuate the propaganda, reaffirming or reinforcing their beliefs despite contradicting evidence.[https://books.google.com/books?id=FNuxnFq76WMC&pg;=PA335&lpg;=PA335&dq;=%22Self- propaganda%22+-wikipedia&source;=bl&ots;=RCLHsg0X45&sig;=ACfU3U0tMVacHWP- HZyIFO4OHNtQb7lcQQ&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiU_eKVjaTlAhXP854KHUblCgwQ6AEwCXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q;=%22Self- propaganda%22%20-wikipedia&f;=false  Historical Context  Propaganda is most successful when self- propaganda is also involved. Self-propaganda makes it easier for individuals to justify their own actions as well as the actions of others. This can be due in part to the fact that belief in actions can greatly reduce cognitive dissonance. Historically propaganda is widely associated with wartime measures and justifications. One of the most well- known examples of Propaganda's ability to allow individuals to convince themselves is During World-War 2. At this time Nazi Germany had large propaganda campaigns against the Jews. While self propaganda does make such government efforts of propaganda more effective, self-propaganda can also refer to any lie that individuals tell themselves or becomes convinced of. Examples Social Media Filter Bubble or \\"Algorithmic Editing\\" • These Methods work by joining a group that limits what information can be seen within a certain group. In 2016 Facebook came under criticismKartik Hosanagar (2016) \\"Blame the Echo Chamber on Facebook. But Blame Yourself, Too\\" for doing this, showing users posts that reflect with what they already believe and agree with. Speculation arose that Facebook was polarizing users for the 2016 United States presidential election, and was further developing their bias towards their preconceived beliefs. Confirmation Bias • Most importantly found through Self-verification and self-enhancement. People are less likely to remember information that conflicts their beliefs or appears negative to what they expect. Communal Reinforcement • Repeated assertion within a group about a belief that the group takes for truth. Often this is done without fully researching the subject or gathering supporting evidence. A beneficial use for this form could be self/group motivation. A group of Alcoholic's Anonymous reaffirming one another that they are strong and can conquer their addiction is a positive form of communal reinforcement. Echo Chamber • The members within a group who obtain information only from within their group. While a filter bubble is created by algorithms online, echo chambers are created by purposely choosing who you associate with and from whom you receive your information. American psychology professor Nicholas DiFonzo found that when Republicans and Democrats were separated and asked to discuss rumors about the other party, they would polarize. However, as the groups were mixed, polarization was significantly decreased.Nicholas DiFonzo (2011) \\"The Echo- Chamber Effect\\" • Online forum Reddit has often been associated with echo chambers. A group known as \\"incels\\" has received much media attention. This group of \\"involuntarily celibate\\" individuals would post often about how they felt they were being wronged by society for what they viewed as bad genetics. Some were pushed into extremism thoughts, and a few committed mass murders.Zack Beauchamp (2018) \\"Incel, the misogynist ideology that inspired the deadly Toronto attack, explained\\"  Application to Cognitive Psychology  Self-propaganda is closely related to Self-deception and Cognitive dissonance.

Two new species of Calyptranthes (Myrtaceae) from Ecuador.SIDA, 1955-1960. They are evergreen shrubs or small trees, growing to 5 meters tall. They have simple, opposite, evergreen leaves and clusters of small flowers lacking petals. The sepals are capped in bud by a lidlike cover, which is shed later. The fruit is a dry, berry-like, reddish brown. The bark is smooth to scaly and pale-white in color. The genus is widely distributed across the warmer parts of the Western Hemisphere, from Florida, Mexico and the Bahamas south to Uruguay.

An explosively formed penetrator (EFP), also known as an explosively formed projectile, a self-forging warhead, or a self-forging fragment, is a special type of shaped charge designed to penetrate armor effectively. As the name suggests, the effect of the explosive charge is to deform a metal plate into a slug or rod shape and accelerate it toward a target. They were first developed as oil well perforators by American oil companies in the 1930s, and were deployed as weapons in World War II. Difference from conventional shaped charges Formation of an EFP MPB mine showing the face of its explosively formed penetrator A conventional shaped charge generally has a conical metal liner that projects a hypervelocity jet of metal able to penetrate steel armour to great depths; in travel over some distance the jet breaks up along its length into particles that drift out of alignment, greatly diminishing its effectiveness in that cases. An EFP, on the other hand, has a liner face in the shape of a shallow dish. The force of the blast moulds the liner into any of a number of shapes, depending on the shape of the plate and how the explosive is detonated. Some sophisticated EFP warheads have multiple detonators that can be fired in different arrangements causing different types of waveform in the explosive, resulting in either a long-rod penetrator, an aerodynamic slug projectile, or multiple high-velocity fragments. A less sophisticated approach for changing the formation of an EFP is the use of wire-mesh in front of the liner. The mesh causes the liner to fragment into multiple penetrators.U.S. Patent 5540156: Selectable effects EFP warhead In addition to single-penetrator EFPs (also called single EFPs or SEFPs), there are EFP warheads whose liners are designed to produce more than one penetrator; these are known as multiple EFPs, or MEFPs. The liner of an MEFP generally comprises a number of dimples that intersect each other at sharp angles. Upon detonation, the liner fragments along these intersections to form up to dozens of small, generally spheroidal projectiles, producing an effect similar to that of a shotgun. The pattern of impacts on a target can be finely controlled based on the design of the liner and the manner in which the explosive charge is detonated. A nuclear-driven MEFP was apparently proposed by a member of the JASON group in 1966 for terminal ballistic missile defense.Explosively Produced Flechettes; JASON report 66-121, Institute for Defense Analysis, 1966Interview with Dr. Richard Blankenbecler http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/5196.html A related device was the proposed nuclear pulse propulsion unit for Project Orion. The (single) EFP generally remains intact and is therefore able to penetrate armour at a long range, delivering a wide spray of fragments of liner material and vehicle armour backspall into the vehicle's interior, injuring its crew and damaging other systems.DoD Directive 2000.19E, \\"Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO)\\", February 14, 2006 As a rule of thumb, an EFP can perforate a thickness of armour steel equal to half the diameter of its charge for a copper or iron liner,ng.pdf, on the web, US military testing of SOFDK and armour steel equal to the diameter of its charge for a tantalum liner, whereas a typical shaped charge will go through six or more diameters. The penetration is proportional to the density of the liner metal; tantalum 16.654 g/cm3, copper 8.960 g/cm3, iron 7.874 g/cm3. Tantalum is preferable in delivery systems that have limitations in size, like the SADARM, which is delivered by a howitzer. For other weapon systems where the size does not matter, a copper liner of double the calibre is used. Extensive research is going on in the zone between jetting charges and EFPs, which combines the advantages of both types, resulting in very long stretched-rod EFPs for short- to-medium distances (because of the lack of aerostability) with improved penetration capability. EFPs have been adopted as warheads in a number of weapon systems, including the CBU-97 and BLU-108 air bombs (with the Skeet submunition), the M303 Special Operations Forces demolition kit, the M2/M4 Selectable Lightweight Attack Munition (SLAM), the SADARM submunition, the Low Cost Autonomous Attack System, and the TOW-2B anti-tank missile.  Use in improvised explosive devices  Improvised Explosive Device in Iraq. When activated the concave copper shape on top becomes an explosively formed penetrator. EFPs have been used in improvised explosive devices against armoured cars, for exampleStratfor, \\"The Imminent Spread of EFPs\\", April 11, 2007 in the 1989 assassination of the German banker Alfred Herrhausen (attributed to the Red Army Faction), and by Hezbollah in the 1990s. A recent development is their widespread use in IEDs by insurgents in Iraq against coalition vehicles.Salon, \\"Surge of danger for US troops\\", January 22, 2007 http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/01/22/ieds/print.html The charges are generally cylindrical, fabricated from commonly available metal pipe, with the forward end closed by a concave copper or steel disk-shaped liner to create a shaped charge. Explosive is loaded behind the metal liner to fill the pipe. Upon detonation, the explosive projects the liner to form a projectile. The effects of traditional explosions like blast-forces and metal fragments seldom disable armored vehicles, but the explosively formed solid copper penetrator is quite lethal—even to the new generation of mine-resistant vehicles (which are made to withstand an anti-tank mine), and many tanks. Often mounted on crash barriers at window level, they are placed along roadsides at choke points where vehicles must slow down, such as intersections and junctions. This gives the operator time to judge the moment to fire, when the vehicle is moving more slowly. Detonation is controlled by cable, radio control, TV or IR remote controls, or remote arming with a passive infrared sensor, or via a pair of ordinary cell phones. EFPs can be deployed singly, in pairs, or in arrays, depending on the tactical situation. = Non-circular explosively formed penetrators = Non-circular explosively formed penetrators can be formed based on modifications to the liner construction. For instance, U.S. patents 6606951 and 4649828 are non-circular in design. US6606951B1 is designed to launch multiple asymmetric explosively forged penetrators horizontally in 360 degrees. US4649828A is designed to form several clothespin shaped EFPs, increasing hit probability. In addition, a simplified EFP (SIM- EFP) can be made using a rectangular liner, similar to a linear shaped charge or modified platter charge. This design can be further modified to be similar to US4649828A with multiple cut and bent steel bars lined side by side instead of a singular liner. Other terrorist uses In Northern Ireland similar devices have been discovered that were developed by dissident Republican groups for intended use against the police.Derry bomb was 'Iraq style mortar' – UTV Live News = Use in Hayabusa 2 = The spacecraft Hayabusa 2 carried a small carry-on impactor (SCI). It was dropped off Hayabusa 2 on to an asteroid and detonated. The explosion created a copper explosively formed penetrator, which hit the asteroid with a velocity of 2 km/s. The crater created by the impact was a target for further observations by the onboard instruments. The shaped charge consisted of 4.5 kg of plasticized HMX and a 2.5 kg copper liner.

Irish Dalriada. The Glynns: Journal of The Glens of Antrim Historical Society. Volume 76 (1978). was a Cruthin kingdom, or possibly a confederation of Cruthin tribes, in north-eastern Ireland during the Middle Ages. It was part of the over-kingdom of Ulaid, and its kings often contended with the Dál Fiatach for the over- kingship of the province. At its greatest extent, the borders of Dál nAraidi roughly match those of County Antrim, and they seem to occupy the same area as the earlier Robogdii of Ptolemy's Geography, a region shared with Dál Riata. Their capital was Ráth Mór outside Antrim, and their eponymous ancestor is claimed as being Fiachu Araide. Territory Dál nAraidi was centered on the northern shores of Lough Neagh in southern County Antrim. Dál nAraidi was one of the more prominent sub-kingdoms of Ulaid, with its kings contending with the Dál Fiatach for the over-kingship of the province for some centuries. To the north of Dál nAraidi in County Antrim lay the Dál Riata, the boundary between which was marked out by the River Bush to Dál Riata's west, and the southern boundary running from Ravel Water to just north of Glynn on the east Antrim coast. Branches =In Tuaiscirt= In the mid-7th century the Dál nAraidi of Magh Line, ruled by the Uí Chóelbad dynasty, conquered Eilne (alias Mag Eilne) to their north-west and a branch of their dynasty seems to have settled there. This branch of the Uí Chóelbad descended from Fiachra Cáech (d. 608), brother of Fiachnae Lurgan, king of Dál nAraidi and over-king of Ulaid. Dungal Eilni, great-grandson of Fiachra Cáech and king of Dál nAraidi, was possibly the first of this branch to be based in Eilne, however in 681 was killed at Dún Ceithern (modern-day Giant's Sconce in parish of Dunboe, west of River Bann). This branch of the Magh Line Dál nAraidi eventually became known as the Dál nAraidi in Tuaiscirt (Dál nAraidi of the North) and . The first reference to Dál nAraidi in Tuaiscirt can be found in the Annals of Ulster under the year 824. Between 646 and 792, the Dál nAraidi in Tuaiscirt held the overkingship of Dál nAraidi seven times, with two of that number becoming overkings of Ulaid. Cathussach mac Ailello, king of Eilne and Dál nAraidi, and claimed as having ruled the over-kingdom of Ulaid for sixteen years, was killed at Ráith Beithech (Rathveagh, County Antrim) in 749. Eochaid mac Bressal, who died in 832, was the last known king of the Dál nAraidi in Tuaiscirt to hold the over-kingship of the Dál nAraidi. The last known king of Dál nAraidi in Tuaiscirt is recorded in 883. The church (or monastery) of Cuil Raithin on the shore of the River Bann lay in Eilne and was said to have been founded by Cairbre, who subsequently became its bishop. According to the Tripartite Life of St. Patrick, written in the 9th century, the Dál nAraidi had granted this church to Saint Patrick. The Airgíallan dynasty of Uí Tuirtrí that lay west of the River Bann had been active east of it from as early as 776, and by the 10th century had taken control of Eilne. Dál nAraidi in Tuaiscirt is said to have corresponded to the later baronies of Dunluce Lower and North East Liberties of Coleraine, and appears to correspond to the trícha cét of An Tuaiscert. It also became an Anglo-Norman cantred called Twescard, which later would absorb the cantred of Dalrede (based on Dál Riata), with these two combined cantreds forming the basis for the rural deanery of Twescard. A sub-division of in Tuaiscirt called Cuil an Tuaiscirt, meaning the \\"nook/corner\\" of Dál nAraidi in Tuaiscirt, was located in the north-west of the petty-kingdom near Coleraine. Its territory would form the basis of the later barony of North East Liberties of Coleraine. =Magh Line= The Dál nAraidi Magh Line, or the Dál nAraidi of Moylinny (modern-Irish Maigh Line, meaning \\"plain of Line\\") was the predominant dynasty of the Dál nAraidi. It was centered in southern County Antrim, with Ráith Mór its royal seat. In the 10th century they are counted as one of twelve tuatha of Ulaid. Line may represent the name of an original population grouping. It was also known as Mocu Aridi. Their territory at its height spanned southern County Antrim and northern County Down containing the tuatha of Magh Line, Dál mBuinne, and Dál Sailni. It was later known as Trian Congaill, meaning the \\"third of Congal Claen\\" (Caech), and became an alias for the territory of Clandeboye, named as such after the Clandeboye O'Neill's who conquered the area in the late 14th century. By the 10th century Dál mBuinne was counted amongst the twelve tuatha of Ulaid. After the Viking era, Dál Sailni and its church at Connor, the principal church of Dál nAraidi was lost to the encroaching Uí Tuirtri. The royal seat of the Dál nAraidi Magh Line was Ráith Mór (meaning \\"great fort\\", Anglicised as Rathmore), located near Lough Neagh in the civil parish of Donegore. It is first recorded in the Annals of the Four Masters under the date 680 as Ratha moiré Maighe Line. Neighbouring Ráith Mór was Ráith Beag (meaning \\"little fort\\", Anglicised as Rathbeg), and is attested location where Áed Dub mac Suibni, king of Dál nAraidi and Ulaid, killed High King Diarmait mac Cerbaill in 565. By the 16th century Ráith Mór became known as Ráth Mór Mag Ullin, meaning \\"great fort of the MacQuillans\\", and was burnt to the ground by Art mac Hugh O'Neill in 1513 after which it was never restored. Cráeb Telcha, usually linked to modern-day Crew Hill near Glenavy, was the inauguration site of the Dál Fiatach kings of Ulaid, however it appears to have also been the same for the Dál nAraidi prior to the 9th-century contraction of their territory. =Magh Cobo (Uí Echach Cobo)= By the late 8th century, Dál Fiatach expansion had cut off the County Antrim and Down branches of the Cruthin from each other. As a result, the County Down branch consolidated into the kingdom of the Uí Echach Cobo, based at Magh Cobo, \\"the plain of Cobo\\". They were styled as kings of Cuib. According to the medieval genealogies they are descended from the Dál nAraidi, though this link is tenuous. By the 10th century Uí Echach Cobo was counted amongst the twelve tuatha of Ulaid. Uí Echach Cobo's territory formed the basis of the medieval deanery and Norman cantred of Oveh, as well as the diocese of Dromore. Their territory was later Anglicised as Iveagh. Their 14th-century expansion formed the basis for the later barony of Iveagh. =Uí Erca Céin= Also spelt as Uí Dercco Céin and Uí Dearca Chein, the Uí Erca Céin where a branch of the Dál nAraidi, and according to the 10th-century Lebor na Cert, one of the twelve minor principalities under the king of Ulaid. They appear to have been based near Semne in Latharna, with their base possibly being Carrickfergus, and a list of Uí Erca Céin kings are given as having ruled Latharna until the mid-7th century, though there are records of kings down to around 900 AD. A branch of the Uí Erca Céin line of kings, the Síl Fingín, also twice held the overkingship of Dál nAraidi. After 750, the Uí Erca Céin became associated with the church of Bangor. At some point they disappear from Latharna and by the 14th century are found in the territory of Leath Cathail in central County Down. The Uí Erca Céin had five vassal tribes all of different origins: the Cenél Talain and Dál Fhocha nUchtar, both of whom appear to also have been of the Cruthin, and possibly refugees driven from their home that went to \\"Dercco Chen\\". A tradition of the Cenél Talain mentions that they had an ancestor who fought alongside Fiacha Araide, the eponymous ancestor of the Dál nAraidi; the Crothraidi, who according to tradition descended from Connacht, however migrated to Ulaid and after 600AD had joined the Uí Erca Céin; Crothraidi Buaingine, who are said to descend from Munster; and the Dál Coirb Fobair, a portion of whom where located in the south Antrim territory of Dál mBuinne, and are claimed to have descended from a Leinster prince called Cú Corb. History By the start of the historic period in Ireland in the 6th century, the over-kingdom of Ulaid was largely confined to east of the River Bann in north-eastern Ireland. The Cruthin however still held territory west of the Bann in County Londonderry, and their emergence may have concealed the dominance of earlier tribal groupings. In 563, according to the Annals of Ulster, an apparent internal struggle amongst the Cruthin resulted in Báetán mac Cinn making a deal with the Northern Uí Néill, promising them the territories of Ard Eólairg (Magilligan peninsula) and the Lee, both west of the River Bann. As a result, the battle of Móin Daire Lothair (modern-day Moneymore) took place between them and an alliance of Cruthin kings, in which the Cruthin suffered a devastating defeat. Afterwards the Northern Uí Néill settled their Airgíalla allies in the Cruthin territory of Eilne, which lay between the River Bann and the River Bush. The defeated Cruthin alliance meanwhile consolidated itself within the Dál nAraidi dynasty. In 565, Áed Dub mac Suibni, king of Dál nAraidi and Ulaid, killed High King Diarmait mac Cerbaill at Raith Bec (Rathbeg, County Antrim). The Dál nAraidi king Congal Cáech took possession of the over-kingship of Ulaid in 626, and in 628 killed the High King of Ireland, Suibne Menn of the Northern Uí Néill in battle. In 629, Congal led the Dál nAraidi to defeat against the same foes. In an attempt to have himself installed as High King of Ireland, Congal made alliances with Dál Riata and Strathclyde, which resulted in the disastrous Battle of Moira in 637, in modern-day County Antrim, which saw Congal slain by High King Domnall mac Áedo of the Northern Uí Néill and severely weakened both Dál nAraidi and Dál Riata. The Annals of Ulster record that in 668, the battle of Bellum Fertsi (modern-day Belfast) took place between the Ulaid and Cruthin, both terms which then referred to the Dál Fiatach and Dál nAraide respectively. Meanwhile, the Dál nAraidi where still resisting the encroaching Northern Uí Néill. In 681, the Dál nAraidi led by Dúngal Eilni of the In Tuasicirt branch, along with their allies, the Cianachta Glenn Geimin of northern County Londonderry led by Cenn Fáelad, were killed at Dún Cethirinn by Máel Dúin mac Máele Fithrich of the Cenél Meic Ercae of Cenél nEógain. Some form of combination of the Dál nAraidi, the Cianachta Glenn Geimin and the Cenél Feradaig was suspected of involvement in the death of Eochaid mac Domangairt, king of the Cenél nGabráin of Scottish Dál Riata in 697. Throughout the 7th century, the Cruthin had gradually lost their lands west of the River Bann, allowing Dál nAraidi to become the sole Cruthin dynastic grouping in County Antrim. After 776, the annals no longer refer to the Dál nAraidi as being of Cruthin stock, but to be of the Ulaid population-grouping instead, being called the fir-Ulaid, the \\"men of Ulster\\". In the 8th century the kingdom of Dál Riata was overrun by the Dál nAraidi. Concurrently the Dál Fiatach extended their territory cutting off the Dál nAraidi from the Uí Echach Cobo. By the end of the 9th century the Dál nAraidi had taken control of Ulaid from the Dál Fiatach. This however only lasted until 972, when Eochaid mac Ardgail restored Dál Fiatach's dominance. In 1005, Brian Boru, marched north to accept submissions from the Ulaid, which including marching upon the Dál nAraidi capital Ráith Mór where he received only the submissions of their king. By the beginning of the 12th century the Dál nAraidi, ruled by the Ó Loingsigh (O'Lynch), had lost control of most of Antrim to the Uí Fhloinn (O'Lynn) and became restricted to the territory of Magh Line. The Uí Fhloinn were the ruling sept of the Airgíallan Uí Tuirtri as well as rulers of Fir Lí, and in a process of gradual infiltration by marital and military alliances as well as growing pressure from the encroaching Cenél nEógain, they moved their power east of the Bann. Once they had come to prominence in Antrim the Ua Flainn styled themselves as king of Dál nAraidi (in Tuaiscirt), Dál Riata, and Fir Lí, alongside their own Uí Tuirtri.

It was first described by Antonin Fritsch (also spelt Frič), a Czech palaeontologist, in 1893, but the remains are sparse. The validity of the species cannot be proven based on the fossil remains, and it is usually marked as a nomen dubium. It lived during the Turonian-Santonian stages of the Cretaceous period (about 90 - 84 million years ago). The generic name Albisaurus is derived from the Latin albus (albi-); after the River Albis, as it was known in Roman times, now the Bílé Labe (or \\"White Elbe\\"), a part of the Elbe River system, which flows through the eastern Czech Republic, near a site where the type fossils were found (Srnojedy by Pardubice);https://dinosaurusblog.com/2015/07/28/druhohorni-plazi-v-cechach- iv/ plus the Greek sauros meaning \\"lizard\\". Fritsch originally published the name as Iguanodon albinus in 1893. After re-evaluating the fossils, however, he decided they were distinct from Iguanodon. In 1905, he published a new name for this material, calling it Albisaurus scutifer. However, I. albinus has priority and is therefore the correct name for the material as it was based on the same type specimen as A. scutifer.A. Fritsch. 1905.

The A4086 runs along their northern banks. Strictly speaking this is one lake, originally called Llyn Mymbyr, with a maximum depth of 30 feet. About 3/4 mile long in total, a delta has built up midway along the north shore, and this has to all purposes cut the lake in two - hence the plural name. The river feeding the lakes is the Nantygwryd (or Nant-y-gwryd), which has its source at Llyn Cwm-y-ffynnon, also marked on maps as the Nant Gwryd, which is a tributary of the Afon Llugwy. The two rivers join at Capel Curig. The lake was used for fly-fishing and sub-aqua courses in the 1960s and is still used today as a canoe training resource by Plas y Brenin and other local education authorities. Geographical and Geological Context The lakes lie in a depression formed by a ring of sandstone called the Capel Curig Volcanic Formation which can be vaguely seen in the panorama below which was taken from the north side. The igneous rocks of Moel Siabod can be seen behind the lakes which are linear but in the panorama appear to bend at the delta between the two.

The name is closely associated with early Christian movements in these regions. Over time the spelling and pronunciation of the name started to reflect the different cultural influences. The variations of the name include Riemensberger, Remsberger, Riemensperger, Ringenberg, Rhingenberg, and Ringenburg to mention a few. During the 13th century and up to the early 17th century the name can be linked to various family branches spread across Westphalia, Silesia, Bavaria and Swabia occupying various estates and serving at various Royal Courts. During the Thirty Years' War a branch strongly linked to the Roman Catholic Church fled to parts of Switzerland seeking protection under the Abbey of St. Gallen (Kloster St. Gallen) and in the Appenzell region. Remains of a castle named Rimensberg and also small hamlets and hills with that name link the Northeast region of Switzerland with the family. Today, there are regional villages like Lütisburg and Kirchberg with a large constituency of Rimensbergers. Another section settled in Bern, Argovia and central Switzerland. During the whole period of Europe's industrialisation, many members of the Rimensberger family emigrated to the United States and Canada as well as to South America. Some notable recent and current representatives are Emil Friedrich Rimensberger, Swiss Social Attaché in Washington, book author, instigator of the Swiss Foreign Information Service; Prof. Peter Rimensberger, eminent international paediatric and neonatal specialist, executive board member of ESPNIC; Georg Rimensberger, artist and art historian; Joseph Rimensberger, Swiss master pastry chef and founder of Fendall Ice cream business in Utah; Wilfried F. Rimensberger, Founding Publisher of Metal Hammer magazine, co-producer and director of the rock music based multi-media project Phenomena and Audiotex pioneer. He is also credited as sourcing producer of Barry Manilow's musical and movie project HARMONY, founder of The Children Arts Academy and Europa - The Woman, the charity arts project in support of a wider European Baccalaureate teaching and the Culham European Academy. In 2014, he launched Millbank Creative Works, a local community based societal enterprise using creativity and sustainability based projects to address social fragmentation in cooperation with ChelseaUAL and Tate Britain. Furthermore, he is also involved in a number of international cultural projects, Malcolm Bruce's first Opera King You's Folly and the multi- media concept EuropeanIcons amongst them. His interested in cross-cultural developments has taken a further dimension with the publication of The Ecyclopedic Paraphrases of Painted Chinese Characters () at the end of 2018 where he joined distinguished Chinese historian and artist Zhiyuan Shi and Precursor to Punk Frankie Stein comparing ancient Chinese leadership thinking, artistic expressions with modern Western cultural movements such as Punk and its expressions.

The history of the city of Portland, Oregon, began in 1843 when business partners William Overton and Asa Lovejoy filed to claim land on the west bank of the Willamette River in Oregon Country. In 1845 the name of Portland was chosen for this community by coin toss. February 8, 1851, the city was incorporated. Portland has continued to grow in size and population, with the 2010 Census showing 583,776 residents in the city. Early history The land today occupied by Multnomah County, Oregon, was inhabited for centuries by two bands of Upper Chinook Indians. The Multnomah people settled on and around Sauvie Island and the Cascades Indians settled along the Columbia Gorge. These groups fished and traded along the river and gathered berries, wapato and other root vegetables. The nearby Tualatin Plains provided prime hunting grounds. Eventually, contact with Europeans resulted in the decimation of native tribes by smallpox and malaria.http://quatr.us/northamerica/after1500/history/chinook.htm Founding Lovejoy and Pettygrove built Portland's first house, a log cabin near the present intersection of Washington Street and Naito Parkway, in 1844.Centennial History of Oregon vol. I Plat of Portland, 1850s Portland in 1853. The site of the future city of Portland, Oregon, was known to American, Canadian, and British traders, trappers and settlers of the 1830s and early 1840s as \\"The Clearing,\\" a small stopping place along the west bank of the Willamette River used by travelers en route between Oregon City and Fort Vancouver. As early as 1840, Massachusetts sea captain John Couch logged an encouraging assessment of the river’s depth adjacent to The Clearing, noting its promise of accommodating large ocean-going vessels, which could not ordinarily travel up-river as far as Oregon City, the largest Oregon settlement at the time. In 1843, Tennessee pioneer William Overton and Boston, Massachusetts lawyer Asa Lovejoy filed a land claim with Oregon's provisional government that encompassed The Clearing and nearby waterfront and timber land. Legend has it that Overton had prior rights to the land but lacked funds, so he agreed to split the claim with Lovejoy, who paid the 25-cent filing fee. Bored with clearing trees and building roads, Overton sold his half of the claim to Francis W. Pettygrove of Portland, Maine, in 1845. When it came time to name their new town, Pettygrove and Lovejoy both had the same idea: to name it after his home town. They flipped a coin to decide, and Pettygrove won. On November 1, 1846, Lovejoy sold his half of the land claim to Benjamin Stark, as well as his half-interest in a herd of cattle for $1,215. Three years later, Pettygrove had lost interest in Portland and become enamored with the California Gold Rush. On September 22, 1848, he sold the entire townsite, save only for 64 sold lots and two blocks each for himself and Stark, to Daniel H. Lownsdale, a tanner. Although Stark owned fully half of the townsite, Pettygrove \\"largely ignor[ed] Stark's interest\\", in part because Stark was on the east coast with no immediate plans to return to Oregon. Lownsdale paid for the site with $5,000 in leather, which Pettygrove presumably resold in San Francisco for a large profit. Minutes of the first meeting of the city council, 1851 On March 30, 1849, Lownsdale split the Portland claim with Stephen Coffin, who paid $6,000 for his half. By August 1849, Captain John Couch and Stark were pressuring Lownsdale and Coffin for Stark's half of the claim; Stark had been absent, but was using the claim as equity in an East Coast-California shipping business with the Sherman Brothers of New York. In December 1849, William W. Chapman bought what he believed was a third of the overall claim for $26,666, plus his provision of free legal services for the partnership. In January 1850, Lownsdale had to travel to San Francisco to negotiate on the land claim with Stark, leaving Chapman with power of attorney. Stark and Lownsdale came to an agreement on March 1, 1850, which gave to Stark the land north of Stark Street and about $3,000 from land already sold in this area. This settlement reduced the size of Chapman's claim by approximately 10%. Lownsdale returned to Portland in April 1850, where the terms were presented to an unwilling Chapman and Coffin, but who agreed after negotiations with Couch. While Lownsdale was gone, Chapman had given himself block 81 on the waterfront and sold all of the lots on it, and this block was included in the Stark settlement area. Couch's negotiations excluded this property from Stark's claim, allowing Chapman to retain the profits on the lot. Portland existed in the shadow of Oregon City, the territorial capital upstream at Willamette Falls. However, Portland's location at the Willamette's confluence with the Columbia River, accessible to deep-draft vessels, gave it a key advantage over the older peer. It also triumphed over early rivals such as Milwaukie and Linnton. In its first census in 1850, the city's population was 821 and, like many frontier towns, was predominantly male, with 653 male whites, 164 female whites and four \\"free colored\\" individuals. It was already the largest settlement in the Pacific Northwest, and while it could boast about its trading houses, hotels and even a newspaper—the Weekly Oregonian--it was still very much a frontier village, derided by outsiders as \\"Stumptown\\" and \\"Mudtown.\\" It was a place where \\"stumps from fallen firs lay scattered dangerously about Front and First Streets … humans and animals, carts and wagons slogged through a sludge of mud and water … sidewalks often disappeared during spring floods.\\" The first firefighting service was established in the early 1850s, with the volunteer Pioneer Fire Engine Company. In 1854, the city council voted to form the Portland Fire Department, and following an 1857 reorganization it encompassed three engine companies and 157 volunteer firemen. Late 19th century Map of Portland in 1890. Portland as depicted in Frances Fuller Victor's Atlantis Arisen (1891). Portland's waterfront in 1898. A major fire swept through downtown in August 1873, destroying 20 blocks along the west side of the Willamette between Yamhill and Morrison. The fire caused $1.3 million in damage. In 1889, The Oregonian called Portland \\"the most filthy city in the Northern States\\", due to the unsanitary sewers and gutters. The West Shore reported \\"The new sidewalks put down this year are a disgrace to a Russian village.\\" The first Morrison Street Bridge opened in 1887 and was the first bridge across the Willamette River in Portland. Portland was the major port in the Pacific Northwest for much of the 19th century, until the 1890s, when direct railroad access between the deepwater harbor in Seattle and points east, by way of Stampede Pass, was built. Goods could then be transported from the northwest coast to inland cities without the need to navigate the dangerous bar at the mouth of the Columbia River. The city merged with Albina and East Portland in 1891.Portland Timeline: 1843 to 1901, City of Portland Auditor's Office Early 20th century Portland in 1910 Front Street in 1910 In 1905, Portland was the host city of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition, a world's fair.

This declaration was intended to stop public speeches by the Industrial Workers of the World in support of the strikers. Panoramic view of Portland, 1923. On June 9, 1934, approximately 1,400 members of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) participated in the West Coast waterfront strike, which shut down shipping in every port along the West Coast.Dock Strike: History of the 1934 Waterfront Strike in Portland, Oregon by Roger Buchanan (1975) The demands of the ILA were: recognition of the union; wage increases from 85 cents to $1.00 per hour straight time and from $1.25 to $1.50 per hour overtime; a six-hour workday and 30-hour work week; and a closed shop with the union in control of hiring. They were also frustrated that shipping subsidies from the government, in place since industry distress in the 1920s, were leading to larger profits for the shipping companies that weren't passed down to the workers. There were numerous incidents of violence between strikers and police, including strikers storming the Admiral Evans, which was being used as a hotel for strikebreakers; police shooting four strikers at Terminal 4 in St. Johns; and special police shooting at Senator Robert Wagner of New York as he inspected the site of the previous shooting. The longshoremen resumed work on July 31, 1934, after voting to arbitrate. The arbitration decision was handed down on October 12, 1934, awarding the strikers with recognition of the ILA; higher pay of 95 cents per hour straight time and $1.40 per hour overtime, retroactive to the return to work on July 31; six-hour workdays and 30-hour workweeks, and a union hiring hall managed jointly by the union and management – though the union selected the dispatcher – in every port along the entire West Coast. The Portland Public Market, in downtown, operated from 1933 to 1942. This view is looking east on Yamhill Street at Front St. (now Naito Parkway). World War II In 1940, Portland was on the brink of an economic and population boom, fueledby over $2 billion spent by the U.S. Congress on expanding the Bonneville Power Administration, the need to produce materiel for Great Britain's increased preparations for war, as well as to meet the needs of the U.S. home front and the rapidly expanding American Navy. The growth was led by Henry J. Kaiser, whose company had been the prime contractor in the construction of two Columbia River dams. In 1941, Kaiser Shipyards received federal contracts to build Liberty ships and aircraft carrier escorts; he chose Portland as one of the sites, and built two shipyards along the Willamette River, and a third in nearby Vancouver; the 150,000 workers he recruited to staff these shipyards play a major role in the growth of Portland, which added 160,000 residents during World War II. By war's end, Portland had a population of 359,000, and an additional 100,000 people lived and/or worked in nearby cities such as Vanport, Oregon City, and Troutdale. The war jobs attracted large numbers of African-Americans into the small existing community--the numbers quadrupled. The newcomers became permanent residents, building up black political influence, strengthening civil rights organizations such as the NAACP calling for antidiscrimination legislation. On the negative side, racial tensions increased, both black and white residential areas deteriorated from overcrowding, and inside the black community there were angry words between \\"old settlers\\" and recent arrivals vying for leadership in the black communities.Quintard Taylor, \\"The great migration: The Afro-American communities of Seattle and Portland during the 1940s.\\" Arizona and the West 23.2 (1981): 109-126. Online Postwar The 1940s and 1950s also saw an extensive network of organized crime, largely dominated by Jim Elkins. The McClellan Commission determined in the late 1950s that Portland not only had a local crime problem, but also a situation that had serious national ramifications.In 1956 Oregonian reporters determined that corrupt Teamsters officials were plotting to take over the city's vice rackets.Robert C. Donnelly, \\"Organizing Portland: Organized Crime, Municipal Corruption, and the Teamsters Union,\\" Oregon Historical Quarterly (2003) 104#3 pp. 334-365 in JSTOR Public transportation in Portland transitioned from private to public ownership in 1969–70, as the private companies found it increasingly difficult to make a profit and were on the verge of bankruptcy. A new regional government agency, the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District (Tri- Met), replaced Rose City Transit in 1969 and the \\"Blue Bus\\" lines—connecting Portland with its suburbs—in 1970. Late 20th century During the dot-com boom of the mid-to-late 1990s, Portland saw an influx of people in their 20s and 30s, drawn by the promise of a city with abundant nature, urban growth boundaries, cheaper rents, and opportunities to work in the graphic design and Internet industries, as well as for companies like Doc Martens, Nike, Adidas, and Wieden+Kennedy. When this economic bubble burst, the city was left with a large creative population. Also, when the bubble burst in Seattle and San Francisco, even more artists streamed into Portland, drawn in part by its relatively low cost of living, for a West Coast city. In 2000, the U.S. census indicated there were over 10,000 artists in Portland. Cultural history While visual arts had always been important in the Pacific Northwest, the mid-1990s saw a dramatic rise in the number of artists, independent galleries, site-specific shows and public discourse about the arts.Ann Markusen and Amanda Johnson, \\"Artists’ Centers: Evolution and Impact on Careers, Neighborhoods and Economies,\\" (Project on Regional and Industrial Economics, Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs, University of Minnesota, 2006). abstract Several arts publications were founded.

From left to right: Minor C. Keith, James Bishop Ford, George Gustav Heye, Frederic Kimber Seward, Frederick Kingsbury Curtis, Samuel Riber, Jr., Archer Milton Huntington, and Harmon Washington Hendricks Minor Cooper Keith (19 January 1848 – 14 June 1929) was an American businessman whose railroad, commercial agriculture, and shipping enterprises much influenced the national economies of the Central American countries, and that of Colombia. His pioneering banana interests were absorbed by the then powerful United Fruit Company, today industry dominating giant Chiquita Brands International. As a businessman, Minor C. Keith is notable for being a pioneer in the establishment and administration of a multi-national company and the exportation and importation of goods among the United States and the countries of the Caribbean Sea.  Early life  Keith was born in Brooklyn, New York, to the lumber merchant Minor Hubbell Keith and Emily Meiggs, sister of Henry Meiggs, a railroad businessman. After private schooling, the sixteen-year-old adolescent was employed as a store clerk on Broadway; months later, he quit clerking, and became a lumber surveyor. Having saved $3,000 in a year, Keith bought a cattle ranch located on a river island near the mouth of the Rio Grande, in southern Texas, which he administered until 1871, when he accepted a work invitation, from his uncle to help manage the building of a railroad in Costa Rica, in Central America.Obituary in the New York Herald Tribune, 15 Jun. 1929, p. 13  Costa Rican railroad  In 1871, Keith's uncle Henry Meiggs had signed a contract with the government of Costa Rican president Tomás Guardia Gutiérrez for the construction of a railroad from the capital city of San José to what became the Caribbean port of Limón. Minor Keith was involved in the project from the start and took it over after Meiggs's death in 1877. At the time, Costa Rica's economy was based primarily on the export of coffee, which was grown in the country's central valley and transported by oxcart to the Pacific port of Puntarenas. Since the main market for Costa Rican coffee was in Europe and no canal connecting the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans existed, creating a reliable transportation route to the Caribbean was a high priority for the Costa Rican government. The construction of the railroad, however, proved extraordinarily challenging due to inadequate financing compounded by the rugged terrain, thick jungle, torrential rains, and prevalence of malaria, yellow fever, dysentery, and other tropical diseases. As many as four thousand people, including Keith's three brothers, died during the construction of the first 25 miles of track.Faces of Costa Rica Having subsequent trouble recruiting Costa Rican laborers, Keith eventually brought in blacks from the Caribbean islands (mainly Jamaica), Chinese, and even Italians, to complete the project.What Happen: A Folk History of Costa Rica's Talamanca Coast By 1882, the Costa Rican government had defaulted on its payments to Keith and could no longer meet its obligations to the London banks from which it had borrowed to pay for the railroad. Keith managed to raise £1.2 million himself from the banks and from private investors, and negotiated a reduction of the interest on the money previously lent to Costa Rica, from 7% to 2.5%. In exchange, the government of President Próspero Fernández Oreamuno gave Keith 800,000 acres (3,200 km²) of tax-free land along the railroad, plus a 99-year lease on the operation of the train route. These terms were made official in a document signed by Keith and cabinet minister Bernardo Soto Alfaro on April 21, 1884 (known to Costa Rican historians as the \\"Soto-Keith contract\\"). He was de facto the land owner of at least 5% of the total territory of Costa Rica. The two most powerful cabinet ministers in the government of President Fernández were his son-in-law Soto (who succeeded him after his death) and his brother-in-law Dr. José María Castro Madriz, who had previously served twice as President of Costa Rica. In 1883 Minor Keith married Cristina Castro Fernández, daughter of Dr. José María Castro Madriz, niece of President Fernández, and cousin-in-law of Soto. His nephew-in-law Rafael Iglesias Castro served twice as President of Costa Rica (1894-1898, 1898-1902)  Banana trade  The railroad was completed in 1890, but the flow of passengers and cargo proved insufficient to finance Keith's debt. As early as 1873, however, Keith had begun experimenting with the production of bananas grown from roots he had obtained from the French. To market the bananas, Keith began running a steamboat line from Limón to New Orleans, in the United States. The resulting banana trade proved extremely lucrative, so that he soon established the Tropical Trading and Transport Company to increase banana movement to foreign destinations. Keith then partnered with M.T. Snyder who established banana plantations in Panama and in the Colombian Magdalena Department. He eventually came to dominate the banana trade in Central America and Colombia. In 1899, he was forced by a financial setback to combine his venture with Andrew W. Preston's Boston Fruit Company, which dominated the banana trade in the West Indies. The result of the merger was the powerful United Fruit Company, of which Keith became vice-president.United Fruit Co. Historical Society In 1904, Keith signed a contract with the President of Guatemala, Manuel Estrada Cabrera, that gave the company tax-exemptions, land grants, and control of all railroads on the Atlantic side of the country.Chapman, Peter. Bananas: How the United Fruit Company Shaped the World. NY: Canongate, 2007.  Other activities  Keith also invested in gold mining in Abangares, in the Costa Rican province of Guanacaste. In 1912 he returned to railroad building, organizing the International Railways of Central America and eventually completing an 800-mi (1,287-km) railway system, but died before realizing his dream of a line from Guatemala to the Panama Canal. His work profoundly altered the economic life of Central American countries. United Fruit Company was involved in the overthrow of the Arbenz government in Guatemala but this occurred some 25 years after Keith's death. Keith also founded a chain of general stores and owned one of the largest poultry farms in the United States. In 1917, Keith acquired huge amounts of the assets of St. Andrews Bay Development Company, which was founded by his brother-in-law, W. H. Lynn. He also acquired huge tracts of land around the area of Panama City, Florida, formerly owned by R. L. McKenzie and A. J. Gay. Keith and his millions are credited with \\"putting Bay County on the map\\" as he also purchased the railroad, the area's mills, over two hundred thousand acres of land, built both the Lynn Haven Hotel and the Pines Hotel in Panama City and developed and constructed a new golf course on North Bay. Death He died on 14 June 1929 of bronchial pneumonia at his home in West Islip, New York.

Lake hailed from Cornwallis Township, Kings County, Nova Scotia. His professional debut came with the Boston Beaneaters in 1891, but he was in and out of the Major Leagues, amassing a total of 125 at-bats in five seasons. He was hired as manager of the Boston Red Sox in 1908, though he was replaced after the 1909 season despite leading the Sox to a third-place finish. Shortly after, he was hired by the crosstown Boston Doves, but in his only season for them, he finished 53–100, 50½ games behind the pennant-winning Chicago Cubs. In addition, he played or managed in the Minor leagues in part of 11 seasons spanning 1896–1926.Baseball Reference – Fred Lake minor league statistics Lake was a long time resident of Boston, where he died at the age of 65. Early life Lake was the fourth child of Nova Scotians Wesley and Julia Lake. Before having Fred in 1866, the couple had given birth to their first child, Edgar James, their second son, Rupert, and daughter Alice. The family moved to Boston in 1868, when Fred was 2, and had three more children, Walter, Nellie, and Charles. Wesley died sometime between 1872 and 1879, leaving Julia to raise her seven children alone in East Boston. As a young teenager, Fred was dependent on his mother as well as his two older brothers who had jobs in a local pottery factory. He attended the local elementary and high school where he learned to play baseball. Professional career =Early career= Aptly nicknamed the \\"baseball tourist\\", Fred Lake spent his baseball career frequently changing both leagues and teams. He began his career at the age of 20 after joining the Salem (Massachusetts) Baseball Club. He did not stay for long, though, and moved on to teams in Dover, New Hampshire, and Hingham, Massachusetts. According to the Hingham Journal, his season with the team was the best one they had had up to that time. In 1890 he joined the New Brunswick Provincial League back in Canada and was hired as the captain and manager of the Moncton team. After a successful season, he was recruited for the National League Boston Beaneaters and joined the team as a back-up player for the 1891 season. After his first season in the major league with the Beaneaters, he went back to the minor league for two seasons with Milwaukee and Wilkes-Barre. He then rejoined the National League in 1894 with the Louisville Colonels, again as a back-up. In 1895 he went back to the minor leagues with Toronto, followed by a season with Kansas City in 1896. In 1897 he rejoined the Beaneaters and played with them for one season before joining the Pittsburgh Pirates for the 1898 season. In 1899, he left the major league again and played semi-pro for Lowell, Massachusetts, and led the team to the New England League championship. He stayed with the Lowell team until 1905, and then joined New Bedford, then Lawrence, and was back with Lowell by 1906. In 1907 he played for Little Rock, Arkansas, and became a scout for the Boston Red Sox. Lake was credited for discovering some great players such as Tris Speaker, Smokey Joe Wood, Harry Hooper and Bill Carrigan. =Boston Red Sox= In 1908, at the age of 41, Lake's career took a dramatic turn when he was hired to replace Red Sox manager Deacon McGuire, under whom the team was floundering. Lake took over in late August and led the team to a 22–17 record through the end of the season; the Red Sox finished in fifth place, as their overall record for the season was 75–79. Two well-known players on the 1908 Red Sox were Cy Young and Smoky Joe Wood. Lake continued as manager of the 1909 Red Sox and advanced the team to third place, with a record of 88–63. That season, Lake had added rookie and future Hall of Famer Harry Hooper to the team as well as moving Tris Speaker to full-time in center field. After the season, Lake asked team owner John I. Taylor for a raise, but his request was denied by Taylor, who claimed that the team's success had nothing to do with Lake's managing. Due to their stubbornness on the issue, Lake was replaced as manager before the 1910 season. =Boston Doves= After leaving the Red Sox, Lake took over the Boston Beaneaters, nicknamed the Doves, which are now the Atlanta Braves. However, he struggled to bring the same success to the Doves that he had achieved with the Red Sox because the players were not as talented. In 1909 the team finished 45-108, and in 1910 they finished 53-100 in 8th place. Despite the unsuccessful season, an interesting story was published about Lake in the Mansfield (Ohio) News on October 4. > In New York the other day, several hundred orphans were guests at the Polo > Grounds. The Giants were facing the Doves and the score was close. Lake > became upset with an umpire's call and told the umpire how wrong he was. He > was ejected from the game.

The jeers turned to cheers and the > children turned their insulting comments towards the umpire. =St. Louis Browns= After 1910 Lake resigned from the Doves and a new manager was hired, there was talk of Lake taking over to manage the St. Louis Browns. However, the Doves would not release him from his contract, so he was hired as Chief Scout for the Browns. However, Lake was frustrated by the lack of skilled minor league players that year and the Browns only ended up hiring three of the players he had scouted. In the October 18, 1911 Colorado Springs Gazette, Lake summarizes his frustration: > The low quality of minor league players is a result of the early picking of > players a year ago. The promising players of 1910 were taken too early and > the result is this year's crop is way below the big league standard. My idea > of scouting is to stay off men who you know will not prosper in the big > leagues and buy up only the players who you feel will make good when tried > out. I have worked with that idea in view. There are many players who are > hitting and fielding well in the minors but they lack the qualifications > necessary for a major league player. For that reason there is little reason > for lining up a player of that stripe. Lake unsurprisingly left the Browns after the 1911 season. =Late career= Lake moved on to the International League in 1912 as manager of the Providence team. In 1913 he managed the New Bedford club of the New England League, and moved the team to Fitchburg in 1914 due to poor attendance. However, within days of opening, Lake moved the team to Manchester, New Hampshire, again due to poor attendance. The club finished the season in last place, causing Lake to sell the club to former Dartmouth athlete and coach of the Lehigh University squad, Tom Keady, in 1915. Lake began coaching in 1916 for Colby College in Maine, and for Tufts University in Boston a few years later. In 1925 he was hired to coach the Harvard University Seconds. At 61 years old in 1926, Lake returned to managing with the Nashua franchise of the New England League. However, he soon stepped down and gave the team to Walter Keating, instead choosing to stay on as vice-president and scout for the team. Family life and death By 1900, Lake had married his wife Lydia Griffin and the couple had had four daughters. Shortly after 1900 Griffin gave birth to their first son and final child, Fred Jr. In November 1931, after an extremely unstable life and career, Lake was admitted to New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston where he died due to heart problems on November 24, 1931. He is buried in Oak Grove Cemetery in Medford, Massachusetts. His wife, Lydia survived him for another 13 years, passing away on September 25, 1944. In the 1930 U.S. Census, his son, Fred Lake Jr. was listed as living with his wife Myrtle and son Fred Lake III in Quincy, Massachusetts.

He played for the Los Angeles Dodgers (1996–1998), Montreal Expos (1998–2000, 2002), Cincinnati Reds (2001–2002), and Kansas City Royals (2004). He is the older brother of Vladimir Guerrero and cousin of Cristian Guerrero. According to MLB official records, Wilton Guerrero was born on October 24, 1974. However, this date is believed to be incorrect given the fact that his brother Vladimir was born less than four months later on February 9, 1975. Vladimir's birth date was originally listed as February 9, 1976, but was revealed to be a year older in 2009. At this time, Wilton no longer played in the Major Leagues, making it likely that nobody noticed or nobody cared about correcting Wilton's birth date. He was a utility player and played strong defense at any position he played. Although he had the ability to hit for average, he had limited power. A switch hitter, most of his power came while batting right handed. He hit only 3 of his 11 career home runs while batting left handed despite many more career at bats from that side. Career =Los Angeles Dodgers (1996-1998)= On October 8, 1991, Guerrero was signed out of the Dominican Republic by the Los Angeles Dodgers. After several seasons in the minor leagues, punctuated by hitting a combined .346 at Double A and Triple-A in 1995, and .344 in Triple-A in 1996, Guerrero was called up to the Dodgers at 21 years old late in the 1996 seasons. He made his major league debut on September 3, 1996, against the New York Mets. He recorded his first hit on Opening Day 1997 (April 1) against the Philadelphia Phillies, with a first inning single off Curt Schilling. His first home run came two weeks later, on April 16, against the Mets' Rick Reed. However, on June 1, 1997, the Dodgers rookie led off against the St. Louis Cardinals by breaking his bat on a grounder to second. Rather than try to run it out, Guerrero scrambled to pick up the pieces of his shattered bat, making the umpires suspicious. Plate umpire Steve Rippley noticed cork in one of the shattered pieces, and showed it to crew chief and third-base umpire Bruce Froemming, who immediately ejected Guerrero. He was suspended eight games and fined $1,000. Additionally, his tenure in Los Angeles was plagued by numerous mental mistakes that kept him from becoming a regular starter.Reid, Jason. Guerrero Is Causing the Dodgers to Go Mental. Los Angeles Times, 1998-04-07. Despite these issues, however, Guerrero proved a solid contact hitter with an ability to hit for average, posting a .291 average in 1997. However, he did not hit for power, with only 4 home runs, and despite being known as a speedy runner, he only stole 6 bases in 1997 while being caught 5 times. =Montreal Expos (1998-2000)= Guerrero began the 1998 season with the Dodgers, but was traded at the deadline to the Montreal Expos with minor league first baseman Jonny Tucker, outfield prospect Peter Bergeron, and pitching prospect Ted Lilly for outfield prospect Hiram Bocachica, second baseman Mark Grudzielanek, and starting pitcher Carlos Perez.AP. Dodgers Swing Another Big Trade. Seattle Times, 1998-08-01. The deal also united Guerrero with his younger brother Vladimir in Montreal. Despite having fallen out of favor in Los Angeles, Guerrero again became a starting second baseman in Montreal. He played in all 52 of the Expos' final games during 1998, and for the season his combined totals were a .284 batting average, 2 home runs, and 27 RBI. He also stole 8 bases, and was only thrown out twice. On August 15, 1998, he hit his first home run as an Expo in the 8th inning of a game against the Cincinnati Reds. One inning later, his brother homered, making the brothers the 12th pair of siblings to homer in the same game, and only the sixth to do so as teammates. In 1999, Guerrero hit .292, again with 2 home runs, and 31 RBI in 132 games. He stole 7 bases and was caught 6 times. On October 2, he launched his first grand slam in the second inning of a 13-3 rout of the Phillies. Since Vladimir had homered earlier in the game, it was the second time the brothers had homered in the same game. During the 2000 season, Guerrero began seeing more time in the outfield due to the emergence of Jose Vidro. His batting average fell to .267, but he once again hit 2 home runs, this time driving in 23 runs. He stole 8 bases and was caught once. His two home runs, the first May 18 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, and the second September 18 against the Florida Marlins, came in games where Vladimir had already homered, the third and fourth times the brothers had both homered in the same game. The four games was a new Major League record at the time, surpassing the three games in which Lloyd and Paul Waner, and Tommie and Hank Aaron had achieved the feat. In 2001, Jeremy and Jason Giambi tied the Guerreros by homering in their fourth game together, and the record has since been surpassed by Melvin Upton Jr. and Justin Upton who both homered in a 5th game together in 2014. The Uptons hold the current record at 6 games.Brothers Homering in the Same Game. Retrosheet =Later Years (2001-2005)= Following the 2000 season, Guerrero elected to sign as a free agent with the Cincinnati Reds. In Cincinnati, Guerrero was used exclusively as a pinch hitter before being sent down to Triple-A Louisville. After being called back up in July, Guerrero steadily boosted his batting average to a career best .338 in 60 games. He added a home run, 8 RBI, and 5 steals (caught twice). He finished the year playing mostly shortstop in the wake of an injury to Barry Larkin. In 2002, he returned to a pinch hitting and backup role once more with the Reds. After hitting just .244, Guerrero was part of a massive three team deal that landed him back with the Expos alongside his brother Vladimir. In the deal, the Florida Marlins received Juan Encarnación, Graeme Lloyd, Mike Mordecai, Carl Pavano, Justin Wayne, Ryan Snare, minor leaguer Don Levinski, and a player to be named later. The Reds received Ryan Dempster. The Expos received Guerrero, Cliff Floyd, Claudio Vargas, and cash.Chass, Murray. The Marlins Give Up Two Stars but Not Hope, They Say. New York Times, 2002-07-12. Guerrero remained a backup and pinch hitter following the trade, and had his worst offensive season to date, batting only a combined .221 for the season with 5 RBI (no home runs), though he did steal 7 bases (caught only once). The Expos released Guerrero following the 2002 season. A free agent once again, he opted to sign once more with the Reds. Guerrero did not make the Reds out of spring training, however, and spent the entire 2003 season with Triple-A Louisville. A free agent again for 2004, Guerrero signed with the Kansas City Royals. He spent most of 2004 with the Triple-A Omaha Royals, but did appear in 24 games with the Major League club, mostly as a backup, batting .219 with 1 RBI and a stolen base. He was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals to a minor league contract in January 2005 with an invitation to spring training, but was let go at the end of spring training. However, the Cardinals signed Guerrero on April 26 to add depth. He started the season with the Memphis Redbirds, the Cardinals' Triple-A affiliate. The Cardinals traded his contract to the Chicago White Sox in June, but after two more months with the White Sox' top affiliate, the Charlotte Knights, he was released in August. He then played several years in the Dominican Republic. As of the 2009 season, Guerrero is serving as an international scout in the Dominican Republic for the Dodgers. Playing style Guerrero as a hitter was known as a slap-hitter who frequently choked up on the bat to try and hit singles rather than try to hit home runs. He was also a free swinger, never walking more than 19 times in a single season. This contributed to a low on-base percentage throughout his career. However, because he did hit for a high batting average, Guerrero was valuable as a pinch hitter since he could come through in a clutch situation with a necessary hit. A switch hitter, Guerrero hit most of his home runs batting right-handed (8 of 11), however, throughout his MLB career, he hit for a higher batting average while batting left-handed (.286 vs .273 right-handed). Guerrero's utility also made him valuable in that he could play multiple positions. Despite being primarily a second baseman throughout his career, Guerrero was used at times as a left fielder, center fielder, right fielder, third baseman, shortstop, and first baseman. The only positions he never played at the Major League level were catcher and pitcher. Personal life Guerrero is the older brother of Vladimir Guerrero and uncle of Vladimir Guerrero Jr. His cousin, Gabriel Guerrero, is also a baseball player.https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2016/02/11/vladimir-guerrero- eyes-hall-fame-his-family-tree-strengthens-dominican/80218052/ See also * List of Major League Baseball players from the Dominican Republic References External links 1974 births Albuquerque Dukes players Charlotte Knights players Cincinnati Reds players Dominican Republic expatriate baseball players in Canada Dominican Republic expatriate baseball players in the United States Great Falls Dodgers players Kansas City Royals players Living people Los Angeles Dodgers players Louisville Bats players Louisville RiverBats players Major League Baseball infielders Major League Baseball outfielders Major League Baseball players from the Dominican Republic Major League Baseball second basemen Memphis Redbirds players Montreal Expos players Omaha Royals players San Antonio Missions players Vero Beach Dodgers players ","title":"Wilton Guerrero"},{"id":"4302234","text":"EFP may refer to:  Politics  * Economic Freedom Party, in Kenya * England First Party, in England * European Federalist Party, a pan-European political party  Professional bodies  * École Freudienne de Paris, a former French psychoanalytic body * European Federation for Primatology * European Federation of Parasitologists * European Federation of Periodontology  Other uses  * École Franco-Polonaise, a defunct Franco-Polish School in Poznań, Poland * Effective Fragment Potential Method * Electronic field production * Electronic fuel pump * Eleven Football Pro, a Lebanese association football academy ** Eleven Football Pro WFC, a women's association football club in Beirut, Lebanon * Elongation factor P, a prokaryotic protein translation factor * Equestrian Federation of Pakistan * European Film Promotion, a network of European film promotion organisations * European Firearms Pass * Exchange for Physicals, an off-market trading mechanism * Explosively formed penetrator * NATO Enhanced Forward Presence * TRIM25, encoding the tripartite motif-containing protein 25 ","title":"EFP"},{"id":"4302235","text":"Lillias Anna Hamilton (7 February 1858 – 6 January 1925) was a British pioneer female doctor and author. She was born at Tomabil Station, New South Wales to Hugh Hamilton (1822-1900) and his wife Margaret Clunes (née Innes). After attending school in Ayr and then Cheltenham Ladies' College, she trained first as a nurse, in Liverpool, before going on to study medicine in Scotland, qualifying as a Doctor of Medicine in 1890. She was a court physician to Amir Abdur Rahman Khan in Afghanistan in the 1890s, and wrote a fictionalized account of her experiences in her book A Vizier's Daughter: A Tale of the Hazara War, published in 1900.A Vizier's Daughter: A tale of the Hazara War. London: Murray, 1900. After a spell in private practice in London, she became Warden of Studley Horticultural College in the years before World War I, taking leave from the College in 1915 to serve in a typhoid hospital in Montenegro under the auspices of the Wounded Allies Relief Committee. Her published works include A Nurse's Bequest, 1907.Lillias Hamilton, A Nurse's Bequest. London: Murray, 1907.  Early life and education  Lillias Anna Hamilton was born on 7 February 1858 at Tomabil station, New South Wales, Australia. She was the eldest of four daughters and the third of the eight children of Hugh Hamilton (1822-1900) and Margaret Clunes (1829–1909). Her father was a farmer from Ayrshire, Scotland, and her mother was the daughter of George Innes of Yarrow from New South Wales. Little is known about Lillias's childhood except that she was two when the family left Australia and settled, nominally, in Ayr, Scotland. The Hamilton's continued to travel until they moved to Cheltenham in 1874. Lillias attended the Ladies' College of Cheltenham for four years. Hamilton began to travel and even worked as a teacher, but in 1883, she began training as a nurse at the Liverpool workhouse infirmary. In 1886, Hamilton decided to become a doctor, and enrolled at the London School of Medicine for Women. She obtained her LRCP (Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians) and LRCS (Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons) at Edinburgh in 1890. Hamilton was part of the first European generation of female physicians. Therefore, most of these women faced challenges in establishing private practice in most cities, and it was seemingly impossible through universities. Therefore, many of these female physicians (such as Dorothée Chellier and Françoise Legey) chose to practise overseas to places like Morocco and Algeria (respectively). Overseas, these women were able to take more initiative and demonstrate their talent as in times of war. Despite much prejudice against female physicians practising in Europe, there was a substantial need for female doctors in India, as religious custom and practice deprived many women of proper medical care. Hamilton had met Colonel Joubert of the Indian Medical Service, and he introduced her to the opportunity of working abroad. Hamilton acquired her medical degree in Brussels and promptly left for Calcutta. Career Most other foreign women doctors in the country received help from government appointment or support of any missionary or philanthropic society, but Hamilton established a successful private medical practice with help only from Colonel Joubert. She held the post of medical officer at the Lady Dufferin Zenana [Women's] Hospital in Calcutta. Her career changed drastically in the spring of 1894 when she moved to Kabul, Afghanistan. =Afghanistan= Hamilton was invited by the Amir, Abdur Rahman, to spend six months in Kabul. He paid for all of her expenses. After she successfully treated the Amir in October 1894, Hamilton became his personal physician for three years to follow. Afghanistan was an inhospitable place for a European, especially a woman, to live. Hamilton was a prolific journalist and the author of two fiction books. She had an unpublished work titled, The power that walks in darkness, in which she expressed her serious reservations about the Amir's often muddled reforms and his ‘iron rule’. Even with the Amir's protection, her work still posed a threat to her own life, and she knew that a loss of the Amir's protection could result in her execution. Her work, A Vizier's Daughter was a fictional account of her time in Afghanistan in which she challenged “Islamic Stipulations,” with sarcasm and perspectives on the Amir, male and female roles in this culture of Afghanistan. In terms of her medical work, Hamilton made a significant impact on the health of the Afghan population. Not only did she establish a hospital in Kabul, but she was also responsible for introducing vaccination into the country. She expanded on techniques of treatment including maintenance of the four humors of the body based on traditional beliefs and treatments in the Qaran. = Return to England = By late 1896, Hamilton fled Afghanistan due to the threat and danger of her controversial writing and work. Once home in England, she redirected her attention to the predicament of homeless women's treatment, and in 1897, she co-founded the Victoria Women's Settlement in Liverpool. Soon after, she returned to private practice, setting up a nursing home in London. Studley College students in 1910 Hamilton and one of her brothers established a farm in the Transvaal Province. After two trips there, Lillias stopped practising to return to travelling. In 1908, she applied and was accepted as warden of Studley College in Warwick. This college was established in 1898 to train women for careers in agriculture and horticulture. At this time, Hamilton was an active member of the Women's Freedom League, which was founded in 1907, to obtain votes for women under thirty. After the outbreak of was she volunteered her medical services to the Wounded Allies Relief Committee in 1915, and ran a hospital in Podgoritza, Montenegro. After the war she maintained tenure until she retired due to ill health in 1924. She was succeeded by Helen Ekins, an ex-student, who Hamilton had lauded as the \\"most highly qualified... in horticulture in England\\" just four years before when she gained a BSc.  Personal life and death  Hamilton was claimed to be a highly accomplished and talented photographer and needlewoman, and also enjoyed music, painting, and the theatre. Hamilton never married. She died on 6 January 1925 at the Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital, Nice, France, and was buried in the English cemetery on the Saturday after her death.

She is best known for her long- running role as Kathy Glover in ITV soap opera Emmerdale. Early life Burrows' first name, Malandra, is a portmanteau of her parents' names, Malcolm and Sandra. Her mother encouraged her at an early age to begin dancing; she initially trained under Billy Pearce's mother Jean. She appeared on Yorkshire Television’s Junior Showtime at the age of six. In 1974 Malandra Newman became the youngest-ever winner of New Faces, appearing on the same \\"all-winners\\" show with Les Dennis and Victoria Wood. Her interest in music continued throughout her early adolescence, and at age 13 she won the 1978 BBC Merseyside Songwriter of the Year award. She attended King David High School in Childwall. After deciding that she wanted to be a performer, she joined the Everyman Youth Theatre in Liverpool, did classes at Liverpool Theatre School and also did productions with a local amateur dramatics company at St Peter's, in Woolton, whilst continuing to perform musically. After leaving school with eleven O-levels, she enrolled in a Liverpool drama school, where she remained for two years learning her future trade of acting — changing her surname to Burrows for registration with Equity, the British actors' union. Career Even before leaving drama school, Burrows played several roles on television, appearing in The Practice and Fell Tiger, as well as taking two parts in the Channel 4 soap opera Brookside - firstly Lucy Collins' schoolfriend, Sue, and then Lisa Morrissey, the girlfriend of Pat Hancock. =Emmerdale= Three months after leaving drama school, she auditioned for the role of Kathy Bates in the popular ITV soap opera Emmerdale (then known as Emmerdale Farm) and got the part. The role has been her most prominent to date. She became one of the programme's longest-running characters, remaining in the show from 1985 to 2001 and returning briefly in 2005. Kathy is remembered for being one of the most-often married characters in the soap and had a reputation for having \\"the kiss of death\\" on her men. First husband Jackie Merrick accidentally shot himself in 1989; her second marriage to Chris Tate, who uses a wheelchair, ended in 1995 when he admitted to an affair; in 1996 Kathy’s third husband Dave Glover died saving a baby he thought to be his own from a house fire as he was about to elope with his mistress Kim Tate. Kathy was even dumped at the altar by her fourth fiancé Biff in 1999. During her 16-year stint, Kathy was kidnapped by a diamond-thieving lord, knocked down by a horse-stealing conman, targeted by a double wife murderer who tried to drive her over a cliff, trapped in the wreckage of a bus hit by a lorry, and imprisoned for protesting against the local haulage company. Reportedly one of the soap's highest-paid stars of the time on a reputed £80,000pa, she paid the price of celebrity when a fanatical mental patient escaped from custody threatening to kill her; she had police protection for two months. She was axed from the soap as part of ITV's revamp of the programme. Burrows returned for three episodes for Seth Armstrong's funeral in 2005. In 2009, Burrows was asked to return to Emmerdale for Jack Sugden's funeral episodes in February, but was unable due to working in pantomime during Christmas 2008 and January 2009, which prevented her from making a return. Burrows attended Clive Hornby's funeral in July 2008 in Leeds. =Pop career= Burrows has had some success in the UK Singles Chart, reaching number 11 with the song \\"Just This Side of Love\\" in 1990. She released a self-penned single \\"Summernight Love\\" (1996) on AATW/DKAM Records (No. 185 UK). This resulted in a recording contract with Warner Bros., and two more singles (\\"Carnival in Heaven\\" and \\"Don't Leave Me\\") also hit the UK charts (albeit the lower reaches: No. 49 and No. 54, respectively). =Other work= Burrows played many parts in theatre including in 1989 she starred as Nancy in Oliver Twist at the Civic Theatre, Halifax. In 2002 Burrows was a contestant on Celebrity Weakest Link and in 2004 she took part in the ITV game show Simply the Best, where she represented Leeds in a head-to-head tournament with other British cities. She then spent a year presenting a show called Soap Addicts on satellite, and then a year in the stage comedy Just Desserts touring the United Kingdom. In 2006 she appeared on Channel 5's The All Star Talent Show, coming fifth as a Fire Eater. She starred as the Fairy during Christmas 2007, in \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" at the Pavilion Theatre, Bournemouth. Burrows entered late into the 2006 series of I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! on day seven. She was found hanging from a tight rope and had to be rescued as part of the trial by Matt Willis and Lauren Booth. On her first night she had to sleep in a hammock, and fell out of it. She took part in several \\"Bushtrucker trials\\" most notably one dubbed \\"Skyscrape\\". Burrows and fellow contestant Myleene Klass were required to clamber onto a seesaw platform 200 ft above the jungle floor and take turns to collect corresponding flags hanging off the edges of the platform. Each pair of flags, collected in numerical order, equalled a much needed meal for camp. She was the sixth celebrity to be evicted in a head-to-head with Dean Gaffney.

It is contrasted with a standard barge, which is used to transport freight. Many places where canals or rivers play a prominent role have developed pleasure barges for conducting religious ceremonies, holding waterborne festivities, or viewing scenery. History Shallop for ceremonial use on the River Thames at Kingston upon Thames Barges of all kinds were commonly used on the Nile in ancient Egypt. When the Pharaoh Akhenaten revolutionized Egyptian religion, he renamed his pleasure barge \\"Splendor of Aten\\", his dominant god. A miniature of a royal barge was amongst the booty of the tomb of Tutankhamun. The most famous Egyptian barge, the Thalamegos, is that used by Cleopatra VII of Ptolemaic Egypt when she arrived in luxurious state to seduce Mark Antony and also allegedly when she sailed up the Nile with Julius Caesar. 11th-century Chinese writer Ouyang Xiu mentions a pleasure barge in his poetry with oars the color of orchids (or magnolias, depending on the translation). An ivory model of a Qing Dynasty imperial pleasure barge exists at the Vancouver Maritime Museum. In 1357, King Boromtrailokanat of Ayudhaya, in what would later become Thailand, decreed a yearly barge race. His barge would compete against the barge of his consort. If the consort's barge won, then the year would bring abundance. If the King's barge won then it would signify hardship. The consort's barge was usually allowed to win. A later Thai king included a royal barge bearing Buddhist relics in his war party against Burma. By the 17th century, royal Thai barge processions included more than 100 barges, and oarsmen wore matching red garments and gold jewelry. Wealthy states which relied on water trade sometimes developed barges specifically linked to the ruling class. A painting by Jan van de Cappelle from 1650 depicts the state barge of the Netherlands being saluted by gun blasts from battle ships. The doges of Venice also traveled by a state barge, the Bucentaur, especially to perform the yearly held Marriage of the Sea. The Grand Canal de Versailles at Versailles served as a setting for elaborate play barges in the 17th and 18th centuries. The gilded goddess figurehead from Marie Antoinette's barge survives, and Napoleon commissioned a ceremonial barge for his official visit to the port of Brest in 1810. The latter is at the French Musée national de la Marine. Until the middle of the 19th century, pleasure barges were common sights on the River Thames in London and beyond. These included shallops, luxury transport for the upper class, rowed by up to eight liveried servants, and sometimes decorated with gilded carvings and ornate draperies. Handel's famous Water Music was composed to be played with its audiences listening from pleasure barges. The City livery companies competed as to the luxury of their state barges. Up the river at Oxford, where a stretch of the Thames is known as the Isis, many college Boat Clubs permanently moored large two-decker barges in their college colors to use as clubhouses. These proved too expensive to maintain in the 20th century, and they were gradually sold off. Some college barges are still to be seen on the river, used as reception facilities by riverfront hotels, such as The Swan at Streatley, Berkshire, which has the former Wadham College barge. Today Ceremonial barges are sometimes used in historical reenactments and wedding ceremonies in Polynesia. Religious ceremonies are still conducted aboard barges in the Royal Barge Procession of Thailand. The royal barge is rowed by fifty oarsmen, steered by two steersmen, and commanded by two officers. The crew is rounded out by a flagman, a chantman, and a signalman. Bangkok has a museum devoted entirely to royal barges. Barges built to provide people with scenic trips down rivers developed along with the growing middle class in Europe and the United States. Modern pleasure barges, such as those that travel the wine regions of France, can include such amenities as DVD players, exercise equipment, onboard kitchens and water closets, skylit passenger cabins, spa pools and stereo systems. The luxury hotel barges of Europe are even crewed by a master chef and house keepers, and piloted by an experienced captain all of which live on board to care for the guests who are staying with them.http://www.gobarging.com/ Most of these barges were originally built to be commercial barges carrying grain and coal along the rivers and canals. It is only in more recent times that they are being renovated to become today's modern pleasure barges. Art The Romantic period of art in Europe was fascinated with mundane objects elevated to luxurious heights, making the pleasure barge an attractive subject. Paul Delaroche chose a state barge as his setting to depict the historical figure Cardinal Richelieu in an 1892 painting. About the same time, Ludwig II of Bavaria had a sketch drawn up for an elaborate gilded barge with the sea god Neptune at its prow and a carved, elevated canopy, reached by a wrought iron staircase and topped by an angel holding aloft the royal crown.

The two colleges had existed side-by-side for a number of years prior to the amalgamation. ATC was formed in 1920 as a merger of two Anglican seminaries. The evangelical Latimer Hall was founded in 1910, while the more liberal and high church St Mark's Hall followed two years later at a nearby location. The merged ATC moved into the Chancellor Building at UBC in 1927. Westminster Hall (formerly Presbyterian) was the first formal theological college in Vancouver, and classes started in 1908, first at McGill University Vancouver (1907–1915) Campus, then in their own building at 1600 Barclay Street from the fall of 1908 until 1927, when the first part of UCBC (west wing of the Iona Building at UBC) was ready for use. Ryerson College formerly Methodist, and named after educator Egerton Ryerson, was meeting in Westminster Hall since classes began in 1923. It was an extension of the Columbian College started in New Westminster in 1892. There is little available data on the Congregational College of British Columbia, as according to the United Church of Canada's First General Council's Minutes, in 1925, the College was incorporated, but never held any classes. The tower section of the Iona Building was completed during the 1930s. From initial discussions with Anglican and the then separate Methodist and Presbyterian groups in 1922, there has been open discussion on joint studies, and was a reason Ryerson Hall never constructed a separate building. Throughout the 1960s, the two colleges cooperated in offering courses and access to materials, and discussions started regarding the creation of a new theological school to serve the area. The current-day Vancouver School of Theology was formed in 1971. The creation of VST occurred in a climate in which full communion between the Anglican Church of Canada and United Church was under serious consideration, although this union did not take place. Saint Andrew's Hall, a residence established by the Presbyterian Church in Canada during the 1950s, officially became affiliated with the VST. The school has also been recognized by the Presbyterian Church (USA) and the United Methodist Church, both of the United States, as a training institution for their clergy.About  Vancouver School of Theology The Institute for stained glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at Vancouver School of Theology.stained glass at Vancouver School of Theology http://stainedglasscanada.ca/site.php?site=262 Academics = Degrees awarded = Vancouver School of Theology currently offers the following degrees and certifications:http://www.ats.edu/member_schools/vancouve.asphttp://www.vst.edu/programs/programs.php * Certificate in Theological Studies (also offered via continuing education) * Diploma in Theological Studies * Diploma in Denominational Studies * Graduate Diploma in Theological Studies * Master of Divinity * Master of Divinity by extension through the Native Ministry Program * Master of Arts in Theological Studies * Master of Arts in Indigenous and Inter-Religious Studies * Master of Theology in Indigenous and Inter-Religious Studies * Master of Theology * Master of Public and Pastoral Leadership = Academic awards and scholarships = Vancouver Theological Seminary awards annual prizes for Excellence in Writing and Excellence in Preaching named in honor of American theologian and author, Frederick Buechner.

Move from Iona Drive On January 8, 2014, the Vancouver Sun reported that UBC had purchased the 85-year-old Vancouver School of Theology building on Iona Drive for $28 million and will convert it to the new home of UBC's Vancouver School of Economics (VSE) since the building was too large and costly for VST's 115 full- and part-time students to maintain. The Christian graduate school will move—in the summer of 2014—to a smaller building \\"on the north side of the UBC campus, called Somerville House. The school will retain its A-frame Chapel of Epiphany\\". While the 1927 Iona building is the longtime home of the Vancouver School of Theology, it needs only about a \\"quarter of the space\\" and it is finding it difficult to keep up with operating costs. VST will use a portion of the sale proceeds to relocate their operations to more suitable space in the UBC theological neighbourhood and place the balance of the funds in an endowment to support its educational mission and operations.Vancouver School of Theology sells Iona building to UBC, January 7, 2014, University of British Columbia Media Release Gallery File:Chancellor place.jpgChancellor Place and the Iona Building, previously home to the Vancouver School of Theology File:Vst-iona.jpgThe Iona Building, previously home to VST History * William S.

It was a small bipedal herbivore, around long.  Discovery  Argentine paleontologists Rodolfo Coria and Jorge Orlando Calvo named Anabisetia in 2002. The generic name honors the late Ana Maria Biset, an influential archeologist from Neuquén Province in Argentina, where the remains of this animal were found. The one named species is called A. saldiviai, after Roberto Saldivia Blanco, a local farmer who had discovered the fossils in 1985 and brought them to the attention of science in 1993.Coria, R.A. & Calvo, J.O. 2002.

Ameghiniana 33: 462 Artist's impression of Anabisetia There are four specimens known, all listed in the original 2002 description. The holotype, MCF-PVPH 74, is the most complete of the four. It consists of fragmentary skull material, including a partial braincase and both dentary (lower jaw) bones, as well as a complete forelimb from shoulder to hand, a complete hindlimb and foot, and representative vertebrae from all sections of the spinal column. The other three specimens are less complete, but include elements not seen in the holotype, including more vertebrae, a complete pelvis and a nearly complete, articulated tail. Two specimens are the paratypes, MCF-PVPH-75 and MCF-PVPH-76. The fourth, MCF- PVPH-77, is referred to the species. When all four specimens are considered, the skeleton is more or less completely known except for the skull. These specimens are housed at the Museo Carmen Funes in Plaza Huincul, Argentina. All four specimens were discovered at a locality called Cerro Bayo Mesa, thirty kilometers south of Plaza Huincul in the Neuquén province of Argentina. This locality is part of the Cerro Lisandro Formation, which is a geologic formation within the Rio Limay subgroup of the Neuquén Group. The sediments in this formation preserve a swamp which existed from the late Cenomanian through early Turonian stages of the Late Cretaceous Period, or about 95 to 92 million years ago.Leanza, H.A., Apesteguia, S., Novas, F.E., & de la Fuente, M.S. 2004. Cretaceous terrestrial beds from the Neuquén Basin (Argentina) and their tetrapod assemblages. Cretaceous Research 25(1): 61-87  Description  Anabisetia was a small bipedal herbivore. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul estimated its length at two meters, its weight at twenty kilograms.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 277 The describers established several unique traits of the species. At the back of the head, the connection with the neck, the occipital condyle, pointed rather downwards. The shoulder blade had an extension on its upper lower rim, the acromial process, that relatively was the largest ever found in the Euornithopoda. In the hand the fifth metatarsal was flattened with straight edges, instead of rounded in cross-section. In the pelvis, the ilium had a front blade that accounted for more than half of the total ilium length and extended in front of the prepubis. The ischium had a shaft that in the upper part was triangular in cross-section and in the lower part quadrangular. In the ankle the fibula touched the astragalus.  Classification  This dinosaur is thought to be closely related to another Patagonian ornithopod, Gasparinisaura, although the lack of skull material makes it difficult to place with precision. When originally described, Gasparinisaura and Anabisetia were thought to be basal iguanodontians, more derived than Tenontosaurus and members of the clade Euiguanodontia, and seen as endemic remnants of an early dispersion of basal iguanodontians on Pangea. Relatively recent cladistic analyses performed by Coria and others indicated that Gasparinisaura lies just outside of Iguanodontia, closer to North American ornithopods like Thescelosaurus and Parksosaurus.Norman, D.B., Sues, H-D., Witmer, L.M., & Coria, R.A. 2004. Basal Ornithopoda. In: Weishampel, D.A., Dodson, P., & Osmolska, H. (Eds.). The Dinosauria (2nd Edition). Berkeley: University of California Press. pp. 393–412 Anabisetia may fall in a similar position. However, in 2015, both taxa were found to be part of the clade Elasmaria along with other Antarctic and Patagonian ornithopods.Rozadilla, Sebastián, et al. \\"A new ornithopod (Dinosauria, Ornithischia) from the Upper Cretaceous of Antarctica and its palaeobiogeographical implications.\\" Cretaceous Research 57 (2016): 311-324.

Holmes (November 13, 1804 – June 21, 1880) was a senior officer of the Confederate States Army who commanded infantry in the Eastern and Trans-Mississippi theaters of the American Civil War. He had previously served with distinction as an officer of the United States Army in the Seminole and Mexican–American wars. A friend and protégé of Confederate States President Jefferson Davis, he was appointed commander of the Trans-Mississippi Department, but failed in his key task, which was to defend the Confederacy's hold on the Mississippi.  Early life and education  Theophilus Hunter Holmes was born in Sampson County, North Carolina, in 1804.Welsh, p. 104. His father, Gabriel Holmes, was a former Governor of North Carolina and U.S. Congressman.Hoig, p. 306.McCrady, pp. 608–609. After a failed attempt at plantation managing, Holmes asked his father for an appointment to the United States Military Academy, from which he graduated in 1829. He was ranked 44 out of 46, in his class.Williams, pp. 989–990. Holmes was apparently quite deaf, and was almost never aware of loud gunfire.  United States Army  After graduating, Holmes was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 7th U.S. Infantry. In 1838, Holmes attained the rank of captain. During his early services, Holmes served in Florida, the Indian Territory, and Texas. Holmes also served in the Second Seminole War, with distinction. In 1841, he married Laura Whetmore, with whom he would have eight children. During the Mexican–American War, he was brevetted to major for the Battle of Monterrey in September 1846. This promotion was due to Jefferson Davis witnessing his courageous actions there. He received a full promotion to major of the 8th U.S. Infantry in 1855.  Confederate States Army  = Early service = Almost immediately after the firing on Fort Sumter, Holmes resigned his commission in the U.S. Army and his command of Fort Columbus, Governors Island in New York City on (April 22, 1861), having accepted a commission as a colonel in the Confederate States Army in March. He commanded the coastal defenses of the Department of North Carolina and then served as a brigadier- general in the North Carolina Militia. He was appointed brigadier-general on June 5, 1861, commanding the Department of Fredericksburg. Holmes was assigned to P.G.T. Beauregard, for the First Battle of Manassas. Beauregard sent Holmes orders to attack the Union left, but by the time the orders reached him the Confederacy was already victorious. He was promoted to major general on October 7, 1861. He subsequently commanded the Aquia District Johnston, p. 81. before being assigned to the Department of North Carolina. = Peninsula Campaign = During the Peninsula Campaign in the spring of 1862, Holmes was moved to the Richmond area to defend it from the Union assault on the Confederate capital; thus he became temporarily attached to the Army of Northern Virginia.Dougherty, pp. 22-23. His division consisted of the brigades of Brigadier-Generals Junius Daniel, John G. Walker, Henry A. Wise, and the cavalry brigade of Brig. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart. On June 30, 1862, while the battle of Glendale was fought to the north, Holmes was ordered to cannonade retreating Federals near Malvern Hill. His force was repulsed at Turkey Bridge by artillery fire from Malvern Hill and by the Federal gunboats Galena and Aroostook on the James. During the battle of Malvern Hill on July 1, 1862, his force was in reserve. After the Seven Days Battles, Robert E. Lee expressed displeasure at Holmes's mediocre performance. The two also had fundamental disagreements on strategy and Lee appears to have not been alone in his belief that the nearly 60-year-old Holmes was too old, sluggish, and passive (better as an administrator than a field commander) to wage the aggressive war of movement that Lee planned. In truth, the entire Confederate counterattack in the Seven Days Battles had been handled defectively and many generals were to blame, including Lee himself. Jefferson Davis in particular did not think Holmes was any more at fault than the rest of the Army of Northern Virginia's command structure. Nonetheless, his age and unremarkable record in the war up to this point were factors against him and Lee quickly made it clear that Holmes would not make the cut during the post-Seven Days restructuring of the army. General D.H. Hill, who was known for his sarcastic temperament, also widely spread the story of Holmes saying \\"I thought I heard firing.\\" at Malvern Hill. = Trans-Mississippi Department = Holmes was then reassigned to commander of the Trans-Mississippi Department. He was promoted to lieutenant-general, on October 10, 1862, by Jefferson Davis, but declined on the grounds that he had not done anything to deserve this promotion. However, Davis urged him and eventually he accepted. During his time as commander of the Trans-Mississippi Department, Holmes failed to perform his most important duty: defend the Confederacy's hold on the Mississippi River. He refused to send troops to relieve Vicksburg, during the Vicksburg Campaign, leading to the Union's victory. Holmes, operating from Arkansas, protested that the troops in that state were nearly useless and there was no realistic possibility of using them to relieve Vicksburg. For the most part, the Confederate forces in this remote area were little more than a disorganized mob of militia scattered across all corners of the state. There were few weapons available and even fewer modern ones. The soldiers for the most part had no shoes, no uniforms, no munitions, no training, organization, or discipline, a situation worsened by the fact that many communities in Arkansas had no government above the village level. People did not pay taxes or have any written laws and strongly resisted any attempt to impose an outside government or military discipline on them. Soldiers in the Arkansas militia did not understand the organization of a proper army or obeying orders from above. Even worse, many of them were in poor physical condition and unable to handle the rigors of a lengthy military campaign. Holmes for his part believed that he could muster an army of about 15,000 men in Arkansas, but there would be almost no competent officers to lead it anyway. Further compounding his difficulties were multiple Union armies converging on the state from all sides. In this situation, Holmes wrote to Richmond that if by some miracle, he could organize the Arkansas militia into an army and get them across the Mississippi River, they would simply desert as soon as they got to the east bank. As one other serious difficulty, the remote Trans-Mississippi region had considerably lower levels of support for the Confederate cause than the states of the east. The decision to secede from the Union in 1861 had largely that of the state legislature of Arkansas, and was not well received among much of the population. Attempts to enforce conscription into the Confederate army met with resistance and many locals dodged the draft, became guerrillas, or even joined the Union army, resulting in harsh penalties being imposed by state governments against draft dodgers.Hilderman After numerous complaints were sent to Davis, who had little understanding of events in a region almost 900 miles from Richmond, Holmes was relieved as head of the Trans-Mississippi Department, in March 1863. = District of Arkansas = After Holmes was relieved as head of the Trans-Mississippi Department, General Kirby Smith appointed him head of the District of Arkansas and in June, ordered Holmes to make a desperation attack to take some pressure off the beleaguered Vicksburg garrison. On July 4, the day Vicksburg fell to Ulysses Grant's army, Holmes attacked the Union garrison at Helena, Arkansas with 8,000 men. He planned a coordinated attack in conjunction with Sterling Price, John S. Marmaduke, James Fleming Fagan, and, Governor of Arkansas, Harris Flanagin. Despite miscommunication, the Confederates had some success. After hours of fighting, a general retreat was called, and the Confederates pulled back to Little Rock, Arkansas. On July 23, Holmes became ill and temporarily relinquished command in Arkansas to Sterling Price. Price evacuated Little Rock on September 10, and two weeks later Holmes resumed command. In a letter sent to Jefferson Davis on January 29, 1864, Kirby Smith reported that Holmes's age was catching up to him and that he was deficient in energy and apparently also suffering memory problems, thus he needed to be replaced by a younger man. The soldiers he commanded in Arkansas had already taken to sarcastically calling him \\"Granny\\". Upon learning of this, an insulted Holmes resigned his post on February 28. = Later service and life = In April 1864, Holmes commanded the Reserve Forces of North Carolina. Holmes saw little action after being appointed to this new position. He held this position until the end of the Civil War. Holmes, along with General Joseph E. Johnston, surrendered to William Tecumseh Sherman on April 26, 1865.Eicher pg. 875 He returned to North Carolina, where he spent the rest of his life as a farmer. Holmes died in Fayetteville, North Carolina, and is buried there in MacPherson Presbyterian Church Cemetery.

Early years Tinkham was born October 29, 1870, in Boston, Massachusetts, to Frances Ann Holden and George Henry Tinkham, a produce dealer. He graduated from Harvard College in 1894. Career Tinkham served as a member of the Boston Common Council in 1897 and 1898. After this first venture into politics he resumed his education at Harvard Law School. He was admitted to the bar in 1899 and commenced practice in Boston. Tinkham returned to public office, serving as a member of the Boston Board of Aldermen from 1900 to 1902.The Boston Common Council and the Boston Board of Aldermen were later combined into the Boston City Council, following a rewrite of Boston's city charter. Tinkham spent the next several years working as a lawyer. In 1910 he returned to public service, being elected as a member of the Massachusetts State Senate, where he served from 1910 to 1912. During World War I he served in the military; Tinkham would later tell Life magazine that while touring the front as a Congressman he fired the first American shot against the Austrians. Tinkham was elected as a Republican to the Sixty-fourth Congress and to the thirteen succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1915 – January 3, 1943). During that time Tinkham was nicknamed \\"the conscience of the House\\" for his efforts to protect voting rights for African Americans, in part by highlighting of the South's disproportionate representation in the House related to that region's voting population. Tinkham did not stand for renomination in 1942. He continued to practice law in Boston until his retirement; died in Cramerton, North Carolina, August 28, 1956; interment in Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston.

It was first published in 1961. The book relates Hawkins' experiences as a prisoner of war in Japanese prison camps after the American surrender in the Philippines. Long, careful and very secret planning was involved for this hazardous venture. Here is a list of some articles which had to be procured, taken out the gate, and stashed away in a safe place in the jungle, to be available at the appointed time: compass, sextant, chronometer, navigation tables, protractor, dividers, chart of the Southwest Pacific, pencils. Some of these items had to be hand-made. Each man had to have a change of clothing, blanket, shelter tent, mosquito net, canteen, mess kit, and food for five days. Medical supplies had to include quinine, sulfa drugs, first-aid kit, water purifier, and any other medicines they could get their hands on. Other equipment included bolo knives, field glasses, file, hammer, pliers, matches, cooking-can with handle. This indicates the kind of meticulous planning required for prisoners to effect an escape that had a chance to result in survival. ... Among other things, each man was chosen for certain basic qualities, such as character, physical fitness, desire and courage. Also, they were chosen for certain knowledge and/or technical skills required to do the job, and each man was assigned specific responsibilities. They were able to enlist a couple of Filipino ex- convicts still living in the area as advisors and guides, who were invaluable. When he and others finally escape from a camp, they join the American-Filipino guerrillas under the command of Lt. Col Wendell Fertig. Hawkins serves with Fertig for several months and is involved in numerous actions. For these actions he was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Also, an important point is that he persevered throughout the story. An important example is when his group of soldiers and him escape from the POW camp, and trek through the swamp, they are met by a gang of guerilla soldiers. After they prove to be friendly, one of the soldiers tells them that he was trying to shoot them but the cartridge was bad. This shows that those who persevere through hard times will be eventually rewarded. Then, with the help of the guerilla soldiers, they go up north to get communications with an American submarine to come and take them to Australia where they could be safe and then rejoin the fighting. Also, before escaping from a camp in Manila, Hawkins is held in a camp in Corregidor where the conditions are horrible and people lose all sense of discipline and do horrible things. People are dying left and right and they are all falling of disease. Then they are taken and sent to a camp in Manila., along with people in other camps. Before being sent to the Corregidor, Hawkins and other soldiers had to march from their points of surrender to the camp. This march was nicknamed the March of Death because of how many died of disease, exhaustion. And those who could not continue were killed. The march to Manila (after a trip by sea) was less brutal, but still took lives. (In the camp in Manila, only the strong were sent to Manila to work. This helped soldiers improve conditions by secretly eating the food they harvested). Also the conditions were better because this was the lenient Major Maeda who was running the place, not strict lieutenant Hozumki. Eventually evacuated to Australia by an American submarine, Hawkins later was involved in planning for the invasions of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. He stayed in the USMC after World War II and eventually retired as a full colonel. References Further reading * Hawkins, J. 1961. Never say Die. Dorrance & Company, Inc.

Plot summary The story is written from the first-person view of Homer Van Meter, a member of John Dillinger's gang, who says he wants to tell the story of how Dillinger got the scar on his upper lip. Following a gun battle with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) at Little Bohemia Lodge, Van Meter, Dillinger and Jack Hamilton escape in a vehicle, though exchange gunfire with police from their vehicle some time later. The three men escape again, though Hamilton is shot. After ditching their damaged vehicle and stealing another from a passing motorist, the men take refuge in a rented room behind a bar, where they stay for the next five days. Hamilton's condition deteriorates, with it becoming apparent the bullet is lodged in his lung and the wound is turning gangrenous. Hamilton goes through periods of delirium. In a period of lucidity, he asks Dillinger and Van Meter to entertain him, by walking on his hands and doing \\"the trick with the flies\\" respectively, though Dillinger says he will do it later and Van Meter points out there are no flies around. Dillinger attempts to get Dr. Joseph Moran to treat Hamilton, though returns insisting to Van Meter that Moran \\"was a crybaby\\" and he doesn't want such a man to treat Hamilton. He tells Van Meter he threatened Moran into giving him the contact details of someone else, and Moran contacted Volney Davis, a member of Ma Barker's gang. Dillinger and Van Meter take Hamilton to stay with Davis, his girlfriend \\"Rabbits\\" and Ma's son Dock, in Aurora, Illinois. Rabbits performs surgery on Hamilton and removes the bullet, though as expected the surgery is too late and his condition worsens. News that Moran has been arrested leads both Dillinger and Barker's gangs to believe he will inform the FBI of their whereabouts, though they all elect to not abandon the dying Hamilton. They agree to instead make a final stand, though the authorities never arrive. When Hamilton's death appears imminent, Van Meter goes and catches flies with strands of thread, a skill he developed to pass the time when he was in prison. He catches several and shows them to an impressed Hamilton. Dillinger then entertains Hamilton by walking on his hands. While Hamilton is laughing at his antics, Dillinger's revolver falls out of his pants, discharging and injuring himself. The occupants realize Dillinger has only grazed his upper lip, shortly before noticing that Hamilton has died. Dillinger and Van Meter bury their friend, and Dillinger says he thinks his notorious run of good luck has ended and that he will be caught soon. Film adaptation Stephen King allowed an adaptation of the story to be made in 2012 as part of his \\"Dollar Baby\\" deal. An official teaser trailer for the short film was released in September 2012, though the film itself was never released.

Like other members of the genus Campylobacter (with the exception of C. gracilis.) C. fetus is oxidase-positive. C. fetus resides in the small intestine.  Morphology and identification  On cytology, C. fetus appears as a gram-negative rod. A distinguishing feature of C. fetus is the unique \\"S-shape\\" of the rod that may resemble thin, helical spirochetes. C. fetus are flagellated and motile, non-spore forming and anaerobic organisms. C. fetus is also both catalase and oxidase-positive, but nonfermentative. Pathogenesis C. fetus has been discovered to cause some cases of spontaneous abortion in cattle and sheep and has become an important bacterial species in the livestock industry. C. fetus is also an opportunistic human pathogen and can cause bacteremia and thrombophlebitis. Though rare, C. fetus can lead to fatal sepsis in newborns and immunocompromised individuals. C. fetus, along with C. coli, has been shown to cause sepsis. Bacteremia can lead to localized infections of the meninges in the brain, the respiratory pleural spaces or lungs, joints, the pericardial sac around the heart, or the peritoneum. In cattle, C. fetus infection is a common cause of pregnancy failure. Intestinal infection in the pregnant female can become septicemic and spread to the reproductive tract, including placenta and fetus, causing placental and/or fetal infections. = Campylobacter fetus var. fetus = Similar to C. fetus var. jejuni, C. fetus var. fetus can be acquired via fecal-oral route and resides mostly in the intestines. Other means of transmission include the ingestion of infected fluid or placentas. Infections appear to be more detrimental in ewes than in cows, spreading readily through a flock resulting in abortion storms. = Campylobacter fetus var. venerealis = In cattle, C. fetus var. venerealis causes venereal campylobacteriosis during mating, when the bacteria, residing within the preputial area of the bull, are transmitted to the cow's vaginal tissue.

He batted and threw right-handed. During his career, he established himself as a good hitting catcher. His best year came in 2000 when he played 40 games with the White Sox and 53 games for the Orioles. In that year, he hit .301, 14 home runs, and 49 RBI. Early life Born in New London, Connecticut, Fordyce is a graduate of Saint Bernard High School in Uncasville, Connecticut. He played high school football and baseball until he injured a nerve in his neck at the age of 16. After recovering from the injury, he focused on baseball. Career Fordyce was a third-round draft selection of the New York Mets in 1989. He spent the next several years in the minor leagues. Through 1996, he had played in only eight MLB games for the Mets and Cincinnati Reds. He spent parts of the next two seasons in the major leagues with the Reds, until a trade took him to the Chicago White Sox. He played his most complete season for the 1999 White Sox, batting .297 in 105 games. After being traded from the White Sox to the Orioles in the middle of the 2000 season, Fordyce batted .322 in 53 games with Baltimore. He was the primary starting catcher for the first half of the 2001 season, but he struggled offensively. It took him 21 games to drive in a run, and his batting average never got within 100 points of his performance with the team the previous year. Fordyce did not see as much playing time late in the season, and he finished the 2001 season with a .209 batting average in 95 games. He also had the worst fielding percentage among the league's catchers. In January 2002, Fordyce was hospitalized with severe bleeding from his gastrointestinal tract, and he spent several days in intensive care. He was able to report to spring training on time the next month. Orioles manager Mike Hargrove indicated that he was not declaring a number one catcher, and he said that Fordyce would compete for the job with young prospects Fernando Lunar and Geronimo Gil. In 2003, Fordyce battled Gil for the starting catching job on the Orioles. Gil had the upper hand leading into the season, but Fordyce played well initially and earned more playing time than expected. In 108 games that year, Fordyce batted .273. He concluded his career with the Tampa Bay Rays in 2004, hitting .205 in 54 games.

He wrote books such as The High Priests of War, in which he criticized the neoconservatives in the Bush administration, and Final Judgment, where he claimed that Israel's Mossad, the CIA and organized crime was responsible for the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. He had been criticized by many organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, and the Middle East Media Research Institute, which have described Piper as a promoter of antisemitic conspiracy theories and Holocaust denial.\\"College Axes JFK Course\\", The Guardian (London), August 23, 1997.

Kennedy and King assassination theories According to Piper in Final Judgment: The Missing Link in the JFK Assassination Controversy, Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion orchestrated the assassination after learning that Kennedy planned to keep Israel from obtaining nuclear weapons. Piper claimed the assassination \\"was a joint enterprise conducted on the highest levels of the CIA, in collaboration with organized crime — and most specifically, with direct and profound involvement by the Israeli intelligence service, the Mossad.\\" Piper also alleged that Jewish mobster Meyer Lansky and the Anti- Defamation League (ADL) were linked to the murder.

Piper responded to increasing ADL criticism through his 2006 book The Judas Goat, accusing the ADL of using unethical infiltration and information gathering techniques, such as the use of 'agents provocateurs'.

Crimes Edmunds was convicted of the murder of 18-year-old panel beater Garry Heywood and rape and murder of 16-year-old Abina Madill on 10 February 1966 at Murchison East, near Shepparton, Victoria after they disappeared from a rock 'n' roll dance. Heywood was shot through the head with a .22-calibre Mossberg self-loading rifle and Madill was raped and then bludgeoned to death. Edmunds had allegedly previously raped and beaten his first wife and sexually abused his three-year-old daughter. Edmunds was also convicted of a series of rapes in the 1970s and early '80s that led the police to dub the then-unknown offender \\"The Donvale Rapist\\". Edmunds was dubbed \\"Mr Stinky\\" by a sub-editor from Melbourne's Sunday Press newspaper due to his offensive body odour, which was believed to have been caused by a mixture of milk, manure and chemicals from his work as a sharecropping farmer on dairy properties. Sergeant Andrew Wall, a Victoria Police fingerprint expert, matched two fingerprints found on the top of the Holden FJ owned by Heywood. This occurred before computerised processing of fingerprints was developed and fingerprint matching had to be done manually. The fingerprint evidence was deliberately kept quiet so as not to panic the offender or help him become more adept at hiding his prints. These fingerprints connected the Shepparton murders with one fingerprint found at the Donvale crime scene. On 16 March 1985, Edmunds was arrested on unrelated charges of indecent exposure while parked in his station wagon in Albury, New South Wales. After his arrest Edmunds was fingerprinted and the prints were matched with those found at the Shepparton crime scene. At the time, NSW had mandatory fingerprinting, whereas in Victoria this was yet to become law. He was convicted and is now serving two life sentences with no minimum term for the murders and a total of 30 years for five rape convictions in Greensborough and Donvale. It has been alleged that Edmunds committed other murders and more than 32 rapes, although he has maintained his innocence. Police are seeking to utilise new legislation that allows them to compel convicted prisoners to provide a blood sample for DNA testing.http://www.mako.org.au/ausnews186.html He was at one point a suspect in the case of missing Beaumaris girl, Eloise Worledge.

He played with the Philadelphia Eagles for most of his career. As an assistant coach he won two Grey Cups in the Canadian Football League (CFL). He was also the defensive backs coach of the San Antonio Commanders of the Alliance of American Football. Early years A native of Palestine, Texas, Bradley was a quarterback at Palestine High School. With Bradley as quarterback, Palestine won the 1964 Texas 3A State Championship, the only one in the school's history. His running and passing skills gained him selection as a high school All-American. His football talents, including the reputed ability to pass with either hand, earned him the nickname \\"Super Bill.\\" He also participated in the Big 33 football game for the Texas All-Stars in 1966. His father was a baseball coach and Bradley dreamed of playing professional baseball. He was a talented shortstop who was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 7th Round of the 1965 Major League Baseball draft. He was offered $20,000 to sign, but turned it down because he wanted to go to college. Instead, he played semi-pro ball with the Palestine Pals. College career Bradley entered the University of Texas at Austin in 1965 and became the starting quarterback and punter in 1966 as a sophomore. In 1966, he led the Longhorns to a 7-4 record and a victory over Mississippi in the Bluebonnet Bowl. Injured during a win over Indiana, he sat out the Oklahoma game in favor of back-up Andy White, and Oklahoma notched its first win in the rivalry since 1957. Bradley came back the following week and finished the season as the Southwest Conference's leader for rushing touchdowns with 6. In the Bluebonnet Bowl, Bradley and running back Chris Gilbert each ran for over 100 yards, marking the first time that two Longhorns had run for over 100 yards in the same bowl game. Bradley was starting quarterback again the next season. Texas started the season ranked #5, but back-to-back losses to #4 USC and Texas Tech knocked them from the rankings. They then ran off 6 straight wins before ending the season with another pair of back-to-back losses, this time to TCU and Texas A&M; to finish 6-4 and missing out on a bowl game. Despite the down year, Bradley led the Southwest Conference in total touchdowns with 14. In 1968, Texas started the season ranked #5 and introduced the wishbone formation on offense, with co-captain Bradley at quarterback. Struggling with the new offense, Texas with Bradley under center tied #11 Houston and lost to Texas Tech. James Street replaced Bradley during the 3rd quarter of the Texas Tech game and never relinquished the position, leading the Longhorns to 9 consecutive wins, a Southwest Conference Championship and victory in the Cotton Bowl. Bradley was moved to wide receiver for two weeks, and then to defensive back and kick-off returner. As a defensive back he set the Texas and Southwest Conference records for most interceptions in a game when he picked off Texas A&M; four times at the end of the regular season. His final game as a Longhorn was the 36-13 win over Tennessee in the Cotton Bowl. He then played in the 1969 Hula Bowl, the Coaches All-America Game and the College All-Star Game. =Records= * UT – Most passing yards, game (220 yards), broke his own record set earlier that year, surpassed by Rick McIvor in 1979 * UT – Longest Punt, bowl game (74 yards) * UT – Most Offensive Yards, season (1,624), surpassed by Earl Campbell in 1977 * Southwest Conference and UT – Most interceptions caught, game (4) Bold means still active NFL career Bradley was drafted in the third round of the 1969 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles as a punter/defensive back. His first season he punted and returned kick-offs and punts. The next season, he was just the punter. In 1971, he finally moved to defense, became the back-up punter and was a returner again. It was on defense that he stood out. He went on to earn three All-Pro selections (1971–73) at free safety, including first team All-Pro in 1971 and 1972. He also played in three Pro Bowls from 1971–73. His last full season of punting was 1972. He continued returning kick-offs and punts off and on for the rest of his career. Bradley led the NFL in interceptions in both 1971 (11) and 1972 (9), the first player ever to lead the league in interceptions in consecutive seasons, a feat matched only once since. In 1971, he also led the NFL in yards after an interception with 248. These achievements did not draw widespread attention, though, as the Eagles' record for those 2 years was 6–7–1 and 2–11–1; and the Eagles never made the playoffs during Bradley's tenure. He played his final year as the Eagle free safety in 1976, replaced by John Sanders. Bradley would later recount that during his years with the Eagles, he would spend nights out on dates with members of the Philadelphia Phillies usherettes. In 1977, Philadelphia traded Bradley to the Minnesota Vikings for a 7th round draft pick, but the Vikings cut him in training camp in favor of Paul Krause. Bradley went into retirement, working in his family's restaurant in Palestine, but in November of that year he was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals when Mike Sensibaugh broke his leg. He had been asked to come back by other teams – including Houston, Oakland and Pittsburgh, but only accepted with St. Louis because they looked to be playoff-bound. But they lost all their remaining games that season and stayed home. Bradley played four games as a defensive back with the Cardinals and then retired for good. Bradley is a member of the Texas High School, University of Texas, Philadelphia Eagles and Texas Sports Halls of Fame. =Records= * Eagles – Interceptions, season (11) * Eagles – Interceptions, career (34), tied by Brian Dawkins and Eric Allen * Eagles – Interception return yards, season (249) * Eagles – Interception return yards, career (536) Coaching career After retiring from the NFL, Bradley worked an assortment of jobs. He had invested in a sports management company based in Philadelphia, but sold his shares in 1980 and went back to Palestine where he bought a farm and ran a gas station he owned. He also worked as a host on Norwegian Cruise lines in the 1980s and '90s. Bradley's first coaching assignment was as defensive backs coach for the San Antonio Gunslingers of the fledgling USFL in 1983–1984. From there he moved on to the Memphis Showboats with head coach Pepper Rodgers in 1985. When the USFL folded, Bradley went back to The University of Texas as a voluntary assistant coach in 1987 for new head coach David McWilliams. He was then hired by head coach Wally Buono as the defensive back coach and defensive coordinator for the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League from 1988 to 1990. Coach Mike Riley asked Bradley to coach the secondary for him in the World League of American Football (WLAF) as his defensive back coach from 1991 to 1993. Bradley then went back to the CFL and coached with Kay Stephenson for the Sacramento Gold Miners/San Antonio Texans in 1994–1995 as defensive coordinator before moving back to Canada with the Toronto Argonauts. There he helped win two Grey Cups in 1996 and 1997. Success in Canada gave Bradley his first chance to coach in the NFL. From 1998 to 2000, he served as defensive backs coach for Wade Phillips, Ted Cottrell and the Buffalo Bills before moving to the same position with the New York Jets from 2001 to 2003. Bradley returned to college coaching when his former Eagle teammate Guy Morriss hired him to be defensive coordinator for 2004–2006 at Baylor University. He then returned to the NFL to reunite with Defensive Coordinator Ted Cottrell as the San Diego Chargers secondary coach from 2006 to 2008. In early 2009, Bradley and three other assistants were fired. During 2009 and 2010, he was the secondary coach for the Florida Tuskers of the United Football League. Bradley was hired to be the secondary coach of the Hartford Colonials in the UFL but the league pulled the plug on the team for lack of funds before he could coach a game. In 2012, Bradley was hired by Ray Woodard as the defensive coordinator of the Lamar Cardinals football team. He retired from Lamar, and from coaching, in 2014, in part to help take care of his stepson who had suffered brain trauma as the result of a violent attack. In 2018, Bradley was named the defensive backs coach of the San Antonio Commanders of the AAF.

The remains of the fort are now within Arlington County's Fort Ethan Allen Park. and Accompanying two photos History Map of Civil War fortifications near Chain Bridge, including Fort Ethan Allen (September 1861) The Union Army built Fort Ethan Allen in September 1861, shortly after the Army's rout at the First Battle of Bull Run (Manassas) in late July of that year. The fortification was a large bastion-style fort that was located in the County's highlands near the Potomac River. Before the Army constructed the fort, farmland and forests filled the area. To allow for clear lines of sight toward other fortifications and approaches to Washington, D.C., the Army removed trees and other vegetation that were near the site. Built like other northern Virginia defenses, the fort was constructed following the directives of General John G. Barnard of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The walls of the fort were made stronger than most other such forts because it protected Chain Bridge, one of the most important approaches to Washington from the south. The Chain Bridge forts in Virginia (Fort Marcy and Fort Ethan Allen) considerably strengthened the web of fortifications that defended the northern flank of the Arlington Line. Because of its size and location, Fort Ethan Allen was a critical element of this comer of the Washington defenses. A line of trenches and roads, which were used to transport troops and supplies, connected the fortifications of the Arlington Line. In addition, the fort was connected by a long series of trenches and earthworks to the nearby Fort Marcy and Potomac River. The fort consisted of four main faces, with additional angles built into the north and east faces. It maintained a perimeter of with emplacements for 34 guns. Interior structures included two bomb-proofs, ammunition magazines, and other supporting structures.Cooling, pp. 128–136 .

Perhaps the most memorable wartime occurrence at Fort Ethan Allen was a visit by President Abraham Lincoln during the fort's construction. In 1965, the Arlington County government erected a historic marker near the site of the fort. The Arlington County Board designated the fort to be a local historic district on October 3, 1978. The National Park Service listed the fort on the National Register of Historic Places on February 11, 2004.

In 1935, Selkirk succeeded Babe Ruth as the right fielder of the New York Yankees—and also inherited Ruth's fabled No. 3 uniform (which was not retired until 1948, the year of Ruth's death). Over the next eight seasons, Selkirk batted over .300 five times, twice drove home more than 100 RBIs, played in five World Championships (1936, 1937, 1938, 1939 and 1941), and made the American League All-Star team in 1936 and 1939. George Selkirk was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1983, its initial year, and was later inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.Ontario Sports Hall of Fame Biography A native of Huntsville, Ontario, Selkirk batted left-handed and threw right-handed, standing tall and weighing (13 stone). His family moved to Rochester, New York, where Selkirk attended Rochester Technical School.Wancho, Joseph, George Selkirk. Society for American Baseball Research Biography Project His professional career began in 1927. During his nine years of Major League Baseball service, all with the Yankees, Selkirk appeared in 846 games, batting .290 (.265 in 21 World Series games), with 108 regular-season home runs, 131 doubles, 41 triples, 810 hits, and 576 runs batted in (RBI). He recorded an on-base percentage of .400 and a slugging percentage of .483. Selkirk earned the nickname \\"Twinkletoes\\" for his distinctive way of running on the balls of his feet. Selkirk twice in his career recorded 8 RBI in one game, both against the Philadelphia A's at Yankee Stadium, on August 10, 1935 and August 12, 1938. After military service in World War II in the United States Navy, Selkirk managed at the Class A and Triple-A levels for the Yankees, and at Triple-A in the farm system of the Milwaukee Braves. Selkirk then worked as the player personnel director for the Kansas City Athletics (1957–59) and field coordinator of player development of the Baltimore Orioles (1960–62) before becoming the second general manager in the history of the expansion Washington Senators of 1961–71 (now the Texas Rangers) in the autumn of 1962. The Senators were chronically short of funds and never developed a strong farm system, forcing Selkirk to acquire players (such as the great slugger Frank Howard) through trades and fill out the roster with waiver-price acquisitions. Nonetheless, Washington improved every year from 1963 through 1967, but when the team's field manager, Gil Hodges, departed for the New York Mets after the campaign, the Senators regressed and fell back into the American League basement. The death of one of the club's owners forced the sale of the team in the autumn of , and Selkirk was fired during the transition. He then returned to the Yankees as a scout. Selkirk died at age 79 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. His successful career as a player, and the respect he earned as a general manager, earned Selkirk a place in the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. Selkirk was, arguably, the greatest Canadian-born baseball player of the first half of the 20th century.

He served as the head football coach the University of Kentucky from 1962 to 1968 and at Troy State University, now Troy University, from 1976 to 1982, compiling a career college football record of 66–68–6. Coaching career Bradshaw was an assistant coach at the University of Alabama under Bear Bryant and was on the staff that won the 1961 national championship.InfoPlease page on Bradshaw At Kentucky Bradshaw inherited a program that had won a championship in 1950 under Bear Bryant and done well under Blanton Collier but posted a record of 25–41–4 (.386). Bradshaw's 1964 team was ranked #5 in the AP Poll after defeating #1 ranked Ole Miss on the road, 27–21, and beating Auburn, 20–0, for a 3–0 start, but the squad finished 5–5 after defeating the Tennessee in its final game. Bradshaw's 1965 team defeated #10 Georgia, 28–10, and appeared bound for a bowl game, being ranked in the AP top ten for four weeks in September and November of that season. Bradshaw's wins in 1965 included games at Missouri, which capped the season with a Sugar Bowl victory and #6 national ranking in the final AP Poll, an upset of another bowl-bound team from Ole Miss, and another win over the Georgia. The 1965 team was then set back when star quarterback Rick Norton suffered a broken leg. The Wildcats finished 6–4 and out of bowl contention. The remainder of Bradshaw's tenure at Kentucky was disappointing, although his final team did defeat a Missouri team that ended up winning the Gator Bowl and earning a #9 national ranking in the final AP Poll. The 1968 Kentucky team also defeated a ranked Oregon State team. Tackle Herschel Turner, tackle Sam Ball, halfback Rodger Bird, and quarterback Rick Norton were named first-team All Americans under Bradshaw at Kentucky. Bradshaw was the coach in 1962 of the infamous Thin Thirty at Kentucky, the team going from 88 players when Bradshaw arrived in January of that year to just 30 by the end of the year. That season was profiled in Sports Illustrated and in a book published in August 2007, The Thin Thirty, by Shannon Ragland. Bradshaw also helped recruit Nate Northington, who would become the first African-American athlete to play in an SEC game when Kentucky faced Ole Miss on September 30, 1967. Bradshaw was the last Kentucky coach to defeat a #1 ranked team until Rich Brooks led the Wildcats to a victory over #1 ranked LSU in 2007. He was also the last Kentucky head coach to defeat the University of Tennessee twice in Knoxville, and the last Kentucky coach to post two wins against Auburn University.

The original Swedish title is Den kristna försoningstanken (\\"The Christian Idea of the Atonement\\") published in 1930. Aulén reinterpreted the classic ransom theory of atonement, which says that Christ's death is a ransom to the powers of evil, which had held humankind in their dominion.Leon Morris, 'Theories of the Atonement' in Elwell Evangelical Dictionary. It is a model of the atonement that is dated to the Church Fathers,H. N. Oxenham, The Catholic doctrine of the atonement (London: Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts, and Green, 1865), p. xliv,114 and it was the dominant theory of atonement for a thousand years, until Anselm of Canterbury supplanted it in the West with his satisfaction theory of atonement. Aulén interpreted the ransom theory as a \\"victory over the powers which hold mankind in bondage: sin, death, and the devil.\\" According to Pugh, \\"Ever since [Aulén's] time, we call these patristic ideas the Christus Victor way of seeing the cross.\\" Aulen's book, Christus Victor =Atonement theories= In his book, Aulén identifies three main types of atonement theories: * The earliest was what Aulén called the \\"classic\\" view of the atonement, more commonly known as the ransom theory, or since Aulén's work, it is known sometimes as the \\"Christus Victor\\" theory: this is the theory that Adam and Eve made humanity subject to the Devil during the fall, and that God, in order to redeem humanity, sent Christ as a \\"ransom\\" or \\"bait\\" so that the Devil, not knowing Christ couldn't die permanently, would kill him, and thus lose all right to humanity following the resurrection. * A second theory is the \\"Latin\\" or \\"objective\\" view, more commonly known as satisfaction theory, beginning with Anselmian satisfaction (that Christ suffered as a substitute on behalf of humankind, satisfying the demands of God's honor) and later developed by Protestants as penal substitution (that Christ is punished instead of humanity, thus satisfying the demands of justice so that God can justly forgive). * A third is the \\"subjective\\" theory, commonly known as the moral influence view, that Christ's passion was an act of exemplary obedience which affects the intentions of those who come to know about it. This view was put forward in opposition to Anselm's view by Peter Abelard. Aulén argues that the \\"classic view\\" was the predominant view of the early church for the first thousand years of church history, and was supported by nearly every Church Father including Irenaeus, Origen of Alexandria, and Augustine of Hippo, to name a few. A major shift occurred, Aulén says, when Anselm of Canterbury published his Cur Deus Homo around 1097 AD which marked the point where the predominant understanding of the atonement shifted from the classic view to the satisfaction view in the Roman Catholic Church, and later within Protestantism. The Orthodox Church still holds to the atonement view, based upon their understanding of the atonement put forward by Irenaeus, called \\"recapitulation\\", Jesus became what we are so that we could become what he is. =Christus Victor= Aulén argues that theologians have incorrectly concluded that the early Church Fathers held a ransom theory of atonement. Aulén argues that the Church Fathers' theory was not that the crucifixion was the payment of a ransom to the devil, but rather that it represented the liberation of humanity from the bondage of sin, death, and the devil. As the term Christus Victor (Christ the Victor) indicates, the idea of “ransom” should not be seen in terms (as Anselm did) of a business transaction, but more in the terms of a rescue or liberation of humanity from the slavery, and sickness, of sin. Role of the Trinity Aulén states that the chief distinction between Christus Victor and the satisfaction view is the contrary emphasis given to the Trinity and the Law. The satisfaction view, Aulén claims, contains a 'divine discontinuity' and a 'legal continuity' while Christus Victor emphasizes a 'divine continuity' and a 'legal discontinuity'. He points to the emerging theology of penance in the Latin Church as the root of Anselm's ideas, particularly in the writings of St. Cyprian. In Anselm's logical but revolutionary extension of penance theology, God is unable or unwilling to pardon humanity without having his Kingship honored by a payment of blood, later this would take the form of \\"penal substitution\\", the Reformation idea that God's justice, not his honor, is at stake in the atonement. Since only a man can fulfill mankind's obligations to the Law and to God, Christ must become a man in order to offer perfect penance to God. He does this by satisfying the demands of the Law for a sinless life and by suffering the wrath of the Father for past sins. Aulén takes exception to this model, arguing that the incarnation (and also the resurrection) becomes a legal exercise, a piece of a theological equation based on law theories. Aulén goes on to argue that Christus Victor reverses this view by uniting Jesus and His Father during the Crucifixion in a subversive condemnation of the unjust powers of darkness. This is followed by the natural emphasis of Christus Victor: the Father's vindication of Jesus in his victorious and bodily resurrection. Advocates of the satisfaction view do not agree with Aulén's characterization, arguing that the satisfaction model does not, in fact, create opposition between the Father and the Son (there has been less disagreement on the \\"legal continuity\\" or emphasis of satisfaction atonement, although J.I. Packer has notably argued for a version of satisfaction theory with less legal emphasis). In their view, the \\"divine opposition\\" is only apparent since the Father desires reconciliation with mankind and Jesus willingly offers himself as a penal substitute. By contrast, Christus Victor depicts Christ's sacrifice, not as a legal offering to God in order to placate his justice, but as the decisive moment in a war against the powers of darkness; the law included. Writings of the Church Fathers Aulén points to the writings of Paul and the Church Fathers as examples of early Christianity's view of the Law as an enemy which must be defeated in order for mankind's salvation to be secured. He seeks to demonstrate that the penance systems of satisfaction theory and penal substitution place an undue emphasis on man's obligation to offer payment to God and on God's obligation to Law. Instead by suffering a death that, before the Law, meant an accursed status, Christ, instead of satisfying an obligation, overthrew the power of the Law, since its condemnation of a perfect man was unjust. Furthermore, death, sin, and the Devil (personalized forces in Christus Victor), are overthrown since Jesus' subsequent resurrection breaks the dominion they once held over human life. Since the resurrection is a mark of the Father's favor despite the Law's curse on crucified men, the atonement, far from reinforcing the Law, deprives and subverts the Law of its ability to condemn. Thus God the Father and God the Son are not set at odds by the cross with the first in the role of Judge and the second in the role of sinner, but are united in seeking the downfall of the Devil's system of sin, death, and Law that enslaves humanity. This view, Aulén maintains, keeps from the errors of penance systems emphasizing Law and man, and reveals the unity within the Trinity's redemptive plan and the freedom of the forgiveness shown to us by God through Christ. The Incarnation Unlike the satisfaction doctrine view of the atonement (the “Latin” view) which is rooted in the idea of Christ paying the penalty of sin to satisfy the demands of justice, the classic view of the Early church (Christus Victor) is rooted in the incarnation and how Christ entered into human misery and wickedness and thus redeemed it. Aulén argues that the Christus Victor view of the atonement is not so much a rational systematic theory as it is a drama, a passion story of God triumphing over the Powers and liberating humanity from the bondage of sin. As Gustav Aulén writes: \\"The work of Christ is first and foremost a victory over the powers which hold mankind in bondage: sin, death, and the devil. Development of the Christus Victor view after Aulén The Christus Victor theory is becoming increasingly popular with both paleo-orthodox evangelicals because of its connection to the early Church fathers, and with liberal Christians and peace churches such as the Anabaptist Mennonites because of its subversive nature, seeing the death of Jesus as an exposure of the cruelty and evil present in the worldly powers that rejected and killed him, and the resurrection as a triumph over these powers. As Marcus Borg writes, The Mennonite theologian J. Denny Weaver, in his book The Nonviolent Atonement and again recently in his essay \\"The Nonviolent Atonement: Human Violence, Discipleship and God\\", traces the further development of the Christus Victor theory (or as he calls it \\"Narrative Christus Victor\\") into the liberation theology of South America, as well as feminist and black theologies of liberation.

Career =Rise of 98 Degrees= Timmons was the founding member of 98 Degrees. While studying Psychology at Kent State, Timmons decided to move to Los Angeles to pursue a career in entertainment. Although he received several acting jobs (including a commercial for the U.S. Navy), his passion belonged to music and he formed a singing group subsequently. Timmons (along with Justin Jeffre, and brothers Drew and Nick Lachey) formed independently and were later signed to the Motown label in the mid-1990s. In 1997, they released their first single \\"Invisible Man\\" which peaking at number-twelve in the Billboard Hot 100. After building popularity with their appearance in the movie Mulan, singing \\"True to Your Heart\\" which had them collaborate with Stevie Wonder, their success broke out in late 1998 with their album 98 Degrees and Rising, which included the hit singles \\"The Hardest Thing\\", \\"I Do (Cherish You)\\" and \\"Because of You\\". In 2000, the group released their fourth album Revelation which became their highest charting album in the Billboard 200. The group took a hiatus in 2002 though they reunited briefly to sing on Nick and Jessica's Christmas Special, a Christmas TV special which featured member Nick Lachey and his then-wife, singer-actress Jessica Simpson. =Solo ventures= Timmons and the other members of 98 Degrees decided to take a break in 2002 after their world tour. Timmons launched his solo career by touring with Jim Brickman. After positive reviews, he wrote and arranged his first solo album, Whisper That Way, which was released in August 2004 and included the singles Whisper That Way, Better Days and Favorite Star. The album reached #20 on the Adult Contemporary chart. In September 2005, Timmons rejoined his band to perform at Club Purgatory in the neighborhood of Cincinnati to support bandmate Justin Jeffre in his candidacy for mayor of Cincinnati. In October 2006, Timmons participated in the VH1 reality TV series, Mission: Man Band. This TV show grouped four former pop singers, Timmons, Bryan Abrams of Color Me Badd, Rich Cronin of LFO and Chris Kirkpatrick of *NSYNC to form a new band called Sureshot. In December 2009, Timmons offered his second album, Emotional High to fans for free via his website. The album contained the single \\"Emotional High\\". In 2012, Timmons joined boy bands A1 and Blue in a Southeast Asian world tour and performed both his solo songs and 98 Degrees singles. In 2016, Timmons joined the team on the Discovery Science television series \\"Droned\\" as a Co-Executive Producer. The series was picked up for distribution in 94 countries worldwide. In October 2018, Timmons enjoyed one of the most successful ventures of his career, teaming up with CBS Big Brother Legend and IMPACT Wrestling Superstar Mr. PEC-Tacular Jessie Godderz to record the single The Girl Is With Me. The song (and accompanying music video) garnered rave reviews and went viral, with prominent features in Entertainment Tonight, People Magazine, Sports Illustrated, Entertainment Weekly, Yahoo, and many more worldwide media outlets, spurring talks of a follow-up single. The song is also scheduled to appear in an upcoming episode of the Amazon Prime series New Dogs, Old Tricks by Gemelli Films. =Men of the Strip= In 2011, Timmons joined the Chippendales male stripper revue as a singer / performer and MC for a limited run. He was initially skeptical about taking up the offer, but was encouraged by his wife Amanda, and his decision launched a new phase in his career. The success of mixing his performance with the male revue inspired Timmons to propose a more mainstream version with the men performing more than a strip show, but this idea was not supported by Chippendales management. Together with Emmy-nominated choreographer Glenn Douglas Packard and entrepreneur \\"Money Mike\\" Foland, Timmons created the \\"Men of the Strip\\" revue, a process documented in a 2014 docusoap film of the same name, produced for the E! network. Timmons describes the film as \\"like Magic Mike with elements of Sex and the City: the guys' personal lives, they're fighting to be the best at what they can do, but at the end of the day, they're family.\\" He also said that the film covers the audition process, \\"how they navigate being on stage\\" and that while \\"[p]eople are going to think they know what male strippers are all about, each of these guys are unique and interesting.\\" The Men of the Strip troupe earned a contract and regular performances at the Tropicana Las Vegas from 2017, as well as touring in the United States and Canada. The Men of the Strip performers are required to sing and dance in shows, at times performing with Timmons who also sometimes acts as MC. Personal life Timmons was born April 30, 1973 in Canton, Ohio. He graduated from Massillon Washington High School in Massillon, Ohio, and attended Bluffton University, Bluffton, Ohio where he played football for a year. Timmons met his second wife, Amanda, while co-hosting a New Kids on the Block event for Jordan Knight. Having had \\"such a bad previous marriage I had no intention of ever having a serious relationship again,\\" Timmons was not looking for love but found Amanda intriguing and fascinating as she did not know him despite his previous fame with 98 degrees. Timmons describes her as the \\"brainchild behind the rebirth of my career,\\" referring to the Men of the Strip project, and states \\"[a]nything that happens forward, if it's a successful endeavor, you can be assured that she's behind it.\\" Timmons has children by his first wife and he has spoken about the challenge of explaining the Men of the Strip show to them.
