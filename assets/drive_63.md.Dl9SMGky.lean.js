Norway and Belgium. France was the next to fall, leaving Britain, seemingly alone and \\"at bay\\" with only the English Channel holding back German forces.

Priestley wrote and narrated the film with the intended message that Britain is responsible for \\"... the future of the civilised world ...\\" and faces a \\"dark\\" evil. The film opens with images of rural and urban Britain, including iconic images of Big Ben and the White Cliffs of Dover, then depicts the rise of Nazi Germany through newsreel footage, including the recent fall of France.

Written by Abi Morgan, and based on the book of the same name by Claire Tomalin, the film is about the secret love affair between Charles Dickens and Nelly Ternan, which lasted for thirteen years until his death in 1870. The film premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on 31 August 2013, and was released in the United Kingdom on 7 February 2014. The film received a Best Costume Design nomination (Michael O'Connor) at the 86th Academy Awards. Plot In 1857, eighteen-year-old English actress Ellen \\"Nelly\\" Ternan (Felicity Jones) is noticed by forty-five-year-old writer Charles Dickens (Ralph Fiennes) while she is performing at London's Haymarket Theatre. Soon after, he casts her, along with her mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) and sister Maria (Perdita Weeks), in a performance of The Frozen Deep by Wilkie Collins at Dickens's Free Trade Hall in Manchester. At a party following the performance, the famous author and the actress share a brief moment alone. Sometime later, Nelly and her family attend one of Dickens's readings at the Harrow Speech Room in London. Afterwards, Dickens is delighted to see Nelly again. Soon after, Dickens takes the Ternan family to Doncaster Racecourse and begins to spend more time with them. Having become disillusioned with his wife, who does not share his energy and passion for literature and ideas, Dickens cherishes his time with the young actress who shares his interests and passions. Nelly in turn loves spending time with the famous novelist. One day, Dickens walks from his Gads Hill Place country home to East London to see Nelly perform in a play. Afterwards her mother invites him back to their modest cottage for a visit. Noticing the shared looks between Dickens and her daughter, Mrs. Ternan later cautions him that she cannot afford to put her daughter's reputation at risk. Dickens assures her that he has no intention of compromising her good name. After organizing a reading and fundraiser to benefit London's \\"fallen women\\" and their children, Dickens invites the Ternan family to his home, where Nelly examines with fascination the author's books, manuscripts, and writing instruments. When they are alone, they share details and secrets about their lives and upbringings, and the two grow closer. Later, Mrs. Ternan confides to her daughter Maria her feelings about the growing bond between Nelly and Dickens, and that their relationship may offer Nelly the kind of stable future she would not find in the theatre, knowing that Nelly is not as talented as her sisters. Nelly overhears the conversation and is angered and confused by her mother's plans for her to become the mistress of a married man. Soon after, Dickens's wife Catherine (Joanna Scanlan) visits Nelly at her home to deliver a jewelled bracelet birthday gift from her husband, which was delivered to her by mistake. After the birthday party, Dickens and Collins arrive and take her to the house that Collins shares with his mistress Caroline Graves (Michelle Fairley) and her daughter. There, Nelly sees the kind of arrangement Dickens may have in mind for her. Later in the carriage outside her cottage, she confronts Dickens about the suggested arrangement and objects to the idea of being his \\"whore\\". After apologizing and confessing that he no longer loves his wife, Dickens accompanies Nelly inside where he comforts her. Soon after, Dickens announces in The Times his \\"amicable\\" separation from his wife while boldly denying the rumours of an affair with Nelly. Dickens's wife and children are devastated by the news. In the coming days, Nelly's mother assures her that he is an \\"honourable man\\", while Collins reminds her that he is a \\"great man\\" and urges her to break with old conventions. When she visits Dickens at his home, he assures her that he has broken with the past and shows her the manuscript of a new novel that he's just completed, Great Expectations. After reading it, she expresses her approval of the ending which does not bring Estella and Pip together. Dickens reads to her from the novel as if speaking directly to her: '' Dickens and Nelly become lovers and she finds happiness as his mistress and companion. They spend time in France and soon she becomes pregnant, but the child dies during childbirth. After saving a lock of the child's hair, Dickens signs the death certificate \\"M. Charles Tringham\\". Shortly after returning to England from France in the spring of 1865, Dickens and Nelly board a train at Folkestone headed for London. Near Staplehurst in Kent, the train derails killing ten passengers. Dickens rescues Nelly, and then, with her encouragement, pretends that he was travelling alone, to avoid the scandal of it being known they were travelling together. Dickens leaves Nelly in the care of others, and tends to the injured and dying along the train. Nelly observes him retrieve a manuscript page of an episode of Our Mutual Friend on which he had been working. In the coming years, Nelly remains his secret mistress until his death in 1870. In 1876, she marries Oxford graduate George Wharton Robinson, twelve years her junior. The couple have a son and run a boys' school at Margate. While knowing that she knew Charles Dickens as a child, George does not suspect that she was his mistress. Only the Reverend Benham knows her secret. As she watches her son perform in a school play, she remembers the epilogue lines she spoke on stage in The Frozen Deep for Dickens: Cast * Ralph Fiennes as Charles Dickens * Felicity Jones as Nelly Ternan * Kristin Scott Thomas as Mrs. Ternan * Tom Hollander as Wilkie Collins * Joanna Scanlan as Catherine Dickens * Michelle Fairley as Caroline Graves * Jonathan Harden as Mr. Arnott * Tom Burke as Mr. George Wharton Robinson * Perdita Weeks as Maria Ternan * Michael Marcus as Charley Dickens * John Kavanagh as Reverend Benham * Amanda Hale as Fanny Ternan Production Headline Pictures' Stewart Mackinnon first acquired the film rights to Claire Tomalin's biography and commissioned Abi Morgan to write the screenplay with development funding from BBC Films and the British Film Institute. The screenplay was written and Mackinnon then approached a number of co-producers and directors before contracting Gabrielle Tana, who had worked with Fiennes on Coriolanus, his directorial debut. She proposed the project to Fiennes in 2010, after he finished Coriolanus. Headline then contracted Fiennes and Tana. Fiennes' participation as director was announced in July 2011. He did not know much about Dickens before taking on the project: \\"I was ignorant. I had only read Little Dorrit. I knew his obvious ones‚ÄîNicholas Nickleby, Oliver Twist, Great Expectations‚Äîthrough adaptations. And Christmas Carol. I didn't know much about the man.\\" Fiennes initially approached another actor to play the role of Dickens but it did not work out and he eventually played the part. He worked closely with Abi Morgan on the script and little by little he warmed to the idea of playing Dickens. Fiennes and Morgan often met with Tomalin who provided guidance, but she wished to remain outside the actual screenwriting. The screenplay is structured around a series of \\"small tragedies and moments of catalyst\\" described in Tomalin's book, which defined their affair according to her. The actresses considered for the role of Nelly Ternan included Carey Mulligan, Abbie Cornish and Felicity Jones. Jones was officially cast in December 2011. Her casting occurred before Fiennes agreed to portray Dickens. Principal photography began in April 2012 with a planned filming schedule of ten weeks in Kent and London. Exteriors were shot near Margate, where the story is set, on Camber Sands. Filming also took place for two days at Leavesden Film Studios in Hertfordshire. The film had an operating budget of ¬£12 million. Release The Invisible Woman premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on 31 August 2013. The first trailer was launched on 4 October 2013. The film had a limited release in the United States on 25 December 2013 and opened in the United Kingdom on 7 February 2014. Reception =Box office= The Invisible Woman earned $1,229,853 at the box office in the United States and $1,373,682 in the United Kingdom. The total worldwide gross was $3,184,853. =Critical response= Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes calculated a 75% approval rating, with an average score of 6.73/10, based on 158 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Its deliberate pace will frustrate some viewers, but for fans of handsomely mounted period drama, The Invisible Woman offers visual as well as emotional cinematic nourishment.\\" On another review aggregator, Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on 41 reviews from mainstream critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". In his review on the Roger Ebert website, Godfrey Cheshire gave the film three and a half out of four stars, calling it \\"a formidable achievement for Fiennes as both actor and director\\". Cheshire wrote that the story is told with \\"extraordinary delicacy and cinematic intelligence\\" and with a \\"finely calibrated poetic obliqueness that draws the viewer into the relationship's gradual unfolding\\". Cheshire continued: Cheshire also praised the performances of the leading actors, including Fiennes who \\"creates an exuberant portrait of Dickens that encompasses his vanity and selfishness as well as his bounteousness and thirst for life\\", Jones who is \\"luminous\\" and \\"conveys the young woman's mix of awe, intoxication and anxiety as she is drawn inexorably into the orbit of a powerful older man\\", and Scanlan who shows Catherine Dickens' \\"dignity and grace in heart-rending circumstances\\". Cheshire concluded: In his review for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw gave the film four out of five stars, calling the film \\"piercingly intimate and intelligent\\" and praises Fiennes for his \\"strength as a director\\" and for his \\"richly sanguine\\" portrayal of Charles Dickens. Bradshaw also praises Scanlan for her \\"shrewd and sensitive performance as Dickens's neglected wife\\". Bradshaw concluded, \\"This is an engrossing drama, with excellent performances and tremendous design by Maria Djurkovic.\\" In his review for The Telegraph, Tim Robey gave the film four out of five stars.

Many rug and carpet experts see Varamins as being among those Persian carpets most authentic in terms of traditional style and motif.  Technique and knot  The foundation is mostly made of cotton, the Persian Senneh knot is used for these rugs as opposed to the more widespread Turkish knot. Varamin is considered being among the elite of Persian carpets. Veramins are made by tribal people who either live in or pass by Veramin. The principal colours used in Varamin carpets are usually dark brown and dark red on khaki or dark blue backgrounds. The village and workshop weavers mainly use the asymmetrical (Persian) knot, while the nomads, depending on their ethnicity, use either the asymmetrical or the symmetrical (Turkish) knot.  Pattern and motifs  The most common design among Varamin rugs is the \\"Mina Khani\\" which is a motif composed of four round daisy-like flowers in the shape of a diamond and attached to each other by a smaller flower, repeated all over the field. Mina Khani's etymology is unknown but Mina is a feminine name. Mina Khani seems to be also related to Herati motif which is more common in eastern Iran.

Byzantine Jewry in the Mediterranean Economy 2009, p. 174 and the earliest known Hebrew medical writer, he is however a rather uncertain figure who some have suggested is identifiable with the legendary mystical vizier Asif ibn Barkhiya of Arabian folklore, associated with King Solomon (and hence of dubious historicity). Scholars in favor of Asaph‚Äôs historicity suggest that he might have lived somewhere between the 3rd and 7th Centuries CE, possibly in Byzantine Palaestina or Mesopotamia. However, the text itself from which Asaph is known seems to place him between Hippocrates and Pedanius Dioscorides, which if chronological would imply that he might have been thought to have been between the 5th Century BCE and 1st Century CE, though this is very uncertain. The Sefer Refuot, the only known historical Jewish text to mention Asaph (and which he may have written or contributed to), is the earliest known Hebrew medical work, and thus of great historical significance. The \\"Oath of Asaph\\" found in the text resembles the Hippocratic Oath and was taken by medical students at their graduation.

The Synergy is the first aircraft that was designed to use the DeltaHawk V-4 engine. An electric- powered 1/4 scale version of the aircraft has been built and flown via radio control. The Synergy design was unveiled at the 2011 CAFE Foundation electric aircraft symposium. The aircraft was intended to compete in the 2011 NASA/CAFE Green Flight Challenge, but its funding and engine were delayed, forcing the team to withdraw from the competition. After receiving the DeltaHawk engine in December 2011 work resumed and a funding drive was launched to complete the prototype. Intended as a Kickstarter crowdfunding project, the initial project application and appeal were rejected on the basis of not fitting in with Kickstarter's creative arts focus. On 13 May 2012, however, Kickstarter informed McGinnis that they had reconsidered and that the project was approved. The project raised US$95,627 gross funds. By mid-December 2012 McGinnis indicated that the Kickstarter campaign had raised US$80,000 and that he was intending to have a flying proof-of-concept aircraft at AirVenture 2013.

In his day and age, he was the richest Mulatto trader on the Gold Coast. Furthermore, Niezer was an important political figure during the Ashanti wars of the early 19th century. His most important trade interest was the Atlantic slave trade, until it was abolished by the Netherlands in 1814.  Biography  The house of Jan Niezer in Elmina, 1792 Niezer was born in Akwida as the son of a German doctor's assistant in the service of the Dutch West India Company, and an African woman named Manzang. He first travelled with his father to Europe in January 1764, where he attended school. Around 1770, Jan Niezer returned to the Gold Coast alone, joining the Dutch West India Company, like his father. After having worked for the company for 16 years, first as a soldier and later as an assistant of the civil administration, Niezer again went to Europe in 1785, presumably to employ himself as a merchant with a European company. He signed himself up with Louyssen & Son, one of the largest Dutch trading houses of the age, which among others occupied itself with the slave trade. Back in the Gold Coast, Niezer encountered difficulty establishing himself as a private trader, as he was not an official trader of the Dutch West India Company, and was thus hindered by the latter's trade monopoly. Nevertheless, he became one of the most influential traders in Elmina. When the Dutch East India Company was dissolved in 1791, Niezer took his chance to become the biggest private trader on the coast. =Move to Accra= In 1793, Niezer moved to Accra, since the slave trade in Elmina had become unprofitable due to Fante-Ashanti wars. Because of the conflict, Fante had blocked the so-called western trade route between Elmina and the Ashanti Empire. Accra was the endpoint of the so-called eastern trade route, which was safe from Fante and Akim disruptions. Furthermore, Accra was a trading point not only for the Dutch at Fort Cr√™vecoeur, but also for the British at Fort James, and the Danish at Fort Christiansborg, making Accra a safe place to establish oneself. In September 1794 Niezer wrote Louyssen that he was well-acquainted in the interior and that he was able to supply 500 slaves per year, as well as gold and ivory. 1794 was also the beginning of a twenty-year episode in the history of the Dutch Gold Coast, in which the colony was increasingly severed from its home country due to wars in Europe. The diminishing supply of goods from Europe did not bother Niezer too much, as he had no problems with trading with other European nations on the coast. This invited other problems, however, among others with the commander of the British Fort James, who ordered the bombardment of Niezer's property if Niezer once again tried to load slaves on a non-British ship. In 1806, war arose between the people of Accra and other inhabitants of the coast on one side, and the Akuapem on the other. An Accra man named Apho allegedly betrayed his people in this war by signalling by drums where his people's army was. Apho then sought refuge with Jan Niezer, for whom he had worked earlier. Niezer gave the man refuge, which invited a mob of angry Accrans to burn and plunder his property. The Dutch and Danish commander tried to intervene in the conflict, as they had no interest in warring parties just outside their forts. Negotiations between the parties failed, however, leaving Niezer with no option but to release Apho to the mob, which subsequently killed him. =Back to Elmina= In the same year, the Ashanti‚ÄìFante War started as well. As the Ashanti had won the Battle of Abora, Niezer was confident that the western trade route would soon be open again, and left for Elmina. He left one of his sons behind to serve as his trade agent. In 1809, a battle ensued between coastal people and the Elminese. Jan Niezer supplied the Elminese with weapons and munition worth 11,000 Dutch guilders, and led a battle group of around 200 men against the aggressors. Elmina withstood the attack and was eventually liberated by an Ashanti army. =Arrest and journey to the Netherlands= In March 1818, Niezer was arrested by Herman Willem Daendels on the charge that he tried to incite the king of Elmina to kill Daendels. In May of the same year, Daendels died, however, bringing the Dutch administration on the Gold Coast in a difficult situation. The new administration did not feel much for continuing Niezer's trial, but could not let Niezer go without losing face. Niezer was then given the opportunity to defend himself in the Netherlands, which Niezer gladly took up. Via Suriname he arrived in the Netherlands, where he was acquitted of all wrongdoing. =Last years on the Gold Coast= Little is known about Niezer's last years, but certain is that he returned to the Gold Coast on 18 February 1819. His sons had in the meantime sold much of his property and spent most of his wealth, so that Niezer in 1821 was unable to pay the debt he owed in Cape Coast. In the same year, he also tried to set up a cotton plantation just outside Elmina, although this was not very successful. In 1822, Niezer died in Elmina, 66 years of age.

After the events of May 1968, he joined the Maoist Gauche prol√©tarienne (GP). Teaching philosophy at a Bruay-en-Artois lyc√©e in the early 1970s, he was at the centre of the political drama which unfolded when a middle-class lawyer was arrested for the mutilation and murder of a local miner's daughter: La Cause du Peuple, the GP's paper, publicized the case with the headline 'Bruay: And Now They Are Massacring Our Children!'La Cause de Peuple, 1 May 1972.

The first book of the series, Priscilla the Great won the Strongest Start Novel competition, and was named a Flamingnet Top Choice Book. It was also Booklopedia's 2010 Most Hilarious Read. In all, there are five books in the series by Nelson (who also writes young adult novels under the pen name Leslie DuBois): * Priscilla the Great (Create Space 2011, ) * Priscilla the Great: The Kiss of Life (Create Space 2011, ) * Priscilla the Great Too Little Too Late (Create Space 2011, ) * Priscilla the Great: Bring the Pain (Create Space 2012, ) * Priscilla the Great: The Time Traveling Bullet (Create Space 2012, ) Nelson says that the inspiration for the novels comes from her experiences as a math teacher at Ashley Hall, a private girls day-school in Charleston, South Carolina.  Plot  The story revolves around a girl named Priscilla Maxine Sumner, and her family and friends. Her family is made up of her father, Greg Sumner, her mother, Quindolyn, and her three brothers, Josh, Chester, and Charlie. Priscilla learns that she has powers, but is doubtful of them at first. It is learned that her older brother, Josh, also has powers, but keeps them a secret. Their mother, who at first claimed to be a pharmacist, is actually a superhero, and passed down her powers to her children, which helps them later in the books save their family and friends. This article is about the first book in the series. At the beginning of the book, Priscilla is captured by an unknown, but familiar, source, and tied up to a chair. It is soon learned by her that her kidnappers are going to attempt to kill her, so she is forced to come up with her own plan to escape. The story then goes to what happens leading up to the kidnapping. Priscilla is at a party at the most popular girl in her grade, Cali Crawford's, house. She claims the only reason she is there is because her brother, Josh, is dating Cali's sister. Priscilla is then complaining about her \\"not cool\\" one-piece swimsuit, when her long- time crush, Spencer Callahan goes up to talk to her. Priscilla gets so nervous she says she eats \\"bad salsa\\" and rushes to the bathroom. Flushed, she wipes her face with a towel, but it mysteriously turns on fire. She runs to the kitchen, where her oldest brother, Josh, finds her, and takes her home. Priscilla then phones her best friend, also a genius, Tai, and tells her about the party, and in tears. Tai can't find any reasonable explanation for what happened. When it almost happens again, Priscilla gets into a weird position, with all limbs outstretched, where her dad walks in. He thinks that Priscilla is performing a weird dance, and tries to do it himself. Priscilla laughs, and Tai, who is under her bed (the phone is, actually), is talking very loudly. Greg, her father, then says to come downstairs in a half-hour, because they are going to video-chat with their mom, a supposed pharmacist. Priscilla asks where she is, and her dad says, \\"Dubai, Brazil\\". Tai then tells her Dubai is nowhere near Brazil. In the next chapter, Priscilla goes downstairs to video- chat with her mom. When her mom asks a couple \\"motherly\\" questions, such as \\"How is school\\"?, Priscilla responds every time with \\"Why would you care?\\". Her father eventually has enough of it, and sends her up to her room.

It set some French gliding records but was unsuccessful at the international level. Only six production aircraft were built. Design and development Despite its long history of aircraft design and production, Br√©guet Aviation had not built a glider before the 900. After World War II they found themselves with many craftsmen who had skills in building with wood, so light aviation and unpowered aircraft offered a market opportunity. George Ricard designed a wooden, single-seat, mid-wing cantilever monoplane which, though intended for competition, had the comparatively short span of 14.35 m (47 ft 1 in). The wings of the Br√©guet 900 were straight- tapered, with squared off tips with small tip fences. They had marked dihedral. Forward of the single box spar the wing was plywood covered, with fabric aft. Narrow ailerons occupied the outer halves of the wing trailing edge, with flaps of the same chord inboard. From the second prototype onwards the Br√©guet 900 had spoilers at about mid-chord just inboard of the ailerons. On the earliest aircraft these were of the DFS type but were later replaced by Schempp-Hirth parallel ruler action brakes. The fuselage of the Br√©guet 900 was plywood-covered and of oval cross-section, nearly circular aft of the wing and deepening markedly to accommodate the cockpit. The fin and rudder were also ply-covered, bearing fabric-covered control surfaces. The horn balanced rudder was broad and reached between the elevators to the bottom of the fuselage. Some production aircraft had taller vertical surfaces than those of earlier 900s. The straight-tapered horizontal surfaces folded upwards for ease of transport. Early models used an angular, multi-piece canopy, later supplanted by a smooth single piece Plexiglas one. The rear of the canopy joined the high upper fuselage line continuously. The Br√©guet 900 landed on a fixed monowheel undercarriage with a protective ash noseskid ahead of it. Unusually, the tow-release involved two hooks, one on either side of the fuselage just under the wing leading edge. The first prototype flew on 17 June 1948, the second in the following March. Operational history Soon after its first flight in March 1949 the second prototype, equipped with DFS airbrakes and flaps and flown by Paul Lepanse, set a new French distance record of 470 km (292 mi). This was later broken by Roger Biagi in the second production aircraft (900S-2) with a distance of 525 km (326 mi). 900S-4, piloted by Robert Delhoume, set a record speed around a 100 km (62 mi) triangle. The 900 competed in two World Gliding Championships without success: in 1950 the second prototype was wrecked after an airbrake failure and in 1952 900S-5 was placed 21st out of 39, limited by its short span. One restored Br√©guet 900S, the first production machine, remained on the French civil register in 2010. Variants ;900: Two prototypes. 1st had spoilers and no flaps, 2nd DFS airbrakes and flaps. ;900S: Six production aircraft, all slightly different: Schempp-Hirth airbrakes, a single piece canopy and a taller fin introduced piecemeal.

The first use of a building at this location can be traced to Walter of Schliengen in 821. By 1000 a tower house might have been in use. In the 13th century, Rudolf von √úsenberg (1207-1231) was the owner of the castle. The name of the castle derives from the German words \\"Ente\\" and \\"Stein\\", which means duck and stone. By 1525, Entenstein belonged to the nobles of Nagel von der Alten Sch√∂nstein and was thus transformed to a more representative manor house. In 1725 Johann Conrad of Reinach-Hirtzbach, then Prince Bishop of Basel, bought Entenstein castle and used it as the seat of the Upper Bailiwick of Schliengen. In 1805, Entenstein Castle became a district site of the Grand Duchy of Baden. After 1857 Entenstein Castle which was then in the possession of the counts of Andlau, an old German noble house, was reconstructed. In 1970 Entenstein Castle was purchased by the Community of Schliengen and renovated thereafter. Since 1975 it has functioned as city hall of the community of Schliengen.

The Bloudan Conference of 1937 (Arabic transliteration: al-Mu'tamar al-'Arabi al- Qawmi fi Bludan) was the first pan-Arab summit held in Bloudan, Syria on 8 September 1937. The second Bloudan conference was held nine years later in 1946. It was called by the Arab Higher Committee in response to the Peel Commission which recommended the partition of Palestine, then under British control, into Arab and Jewish states.Mattar, p.104. The Peel Commission's recommendations were rejected by the participating delegates while the 1936‚Äì39 Arab revolt in Palestine against the British authorities and increased Jewish immigration in Palestine was widely supported. The Bloudan Conference held historical significance for being an early display of collective Arab concern regarding the Zionist movement.Commins, p.72. Goals and participation The Arab Higher Committee originally petitioned the British Mandate administration to hold the conference in Jerusalem, but the request was rejected and the small town of Bloudan was chosen instead. The conference, which gathered hundreds of delegates from the Arab world (mostly the eastern half), was orchestrated \\"in order to study the duties of the Arabs in their respective countries and to agree on effective measures to resist the dangers posed by the Zionists.\\"Sulh, p.67. Several resolutions adopted during the conference rejected both the plan to partition Palestine and the establishment of a Jewish state there. Furthermore, it affirmed that Palestine was an integral part of the Arab world. A number of committees were created to research ways to resist partition. The significance of the Bloudan Conference was the demonstration of pan-Arab support for the anti-Zionist movement in Palestine. It was chaired by Naji al-Suwaidi, the former prime minister of Iraq, and vice-chaired by intellectual Shakib Arslan of Lebanon, former education minister Mohammed Alluba Pasha of Egypt and the Greek Orthodox bishop of Homs, Ali Hurayki. Although the government of Syria did not participate at an official level due to Anglo-French pressure, it was the most represented in the conference with 115 delegates. Palestine was represented by 97 delegates, Lebanon by 59 and led by Riad al-Solh, Transjordan by 29, Iraq by 9, Egypt by 2 and Tripolitania by 1. In a sign of further pan-Arab support for the conference, solidarity messages and telegrams were sent by Ahmad al-Sabah, the Emir of Kuwait and by Islamic-oriented groups from several Egyptian cities and towns, as well as from Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. After the official conference in Bloudan, a largely secret meeting was held in Damascus by more activist delegates called the Conference of Nationalist Youth. The meeting called for stronger action to unite Arab youth and preparatory committee was established to organize a second, larger conference to be held in Europe. Participants included Yunus al-Sab'awi, Kazem al-Solh, Taqi al-Din Solh, Farid Zayn al-Din, Wasfi Kamal, Munir al-Rayyes, Uthman al-Hawrani, Farhan Shubaylat, Akram Zuaiter and Sabri al-Asali.Sulh, p.68. A pamphlet distributed at the conference, entitled \\"Islam and Jewry,\\" has been described as history's \\"first text that propagated sheer Jew-hatred in an Islamic context by mixing selected anti-Jewish episodes of Mohammed‚Äôs life with the so-called wickedness of Jews in the 20th century.\\"http://www.matthiaskuentzel.de/contents/islamic- antisemitism-how-it-originated-and-spread. Reactions The French Mandate government of Lebanon opposed Lebanese participation in the conference, with the pro-government newspaper stating it was in the country's interests not to antagonize the Jews or the Arabs alike. Lebanese delegates at the conference favored a resolution condemning Lebanese neutrality in the conflict in Palestine, but the resolution was rejected because of opposition from many Syrian delegates and al-Suwaidi who feared a rift with the Lebanese government.Sulh, p.82. The British Consulate in Damascus released a statement reflecting British alarm over the summit, saying there was \\"little doubt that the long drawn-out deliberations over Palestine are reviving from the ashes of local jealousies: the pan-Arab phoenix.\\"Sulh, pp.69-70. The consul described \\"Islam and Jewry,\\" which was distributed at the conference, as \\"a startlingly inflammatory pamphlet\\" which he said gave \\"an indication of the passions that the organizers of the congress hoped to arouse. The consul's informant at the conference described the text as \\"a violently anti-Jewish pamphlet\\" which was given to each of the persons attending the Bludan Congress. Fu'ad Mufarrij, a leading delegate at the meeting, believed the Bloudan Conference was an expression of the aspirations and goals of the Arabs as well as a major step to further develop programs to achieve those aims. However, Lebanese historian Raghid al-Solh believed the Bloudan Conference and other pan-Arab conferences held after it during the late 1930s, focused specifically on the Palestine issue and only sought to consolidate the political status quo in the region in which Iraq and Transjordan leaned towards the Hashemite vision of a limited federal Arab union, an idea the British sympathized with, while Syria, Lebanon and Egypt each held their own initiatives. According to al-Solh, pan-Arab unity and liberation from European colonialism were largely ignored.

Its aim is social learning and development of the person. Since the nineteen fifties, TCI has been developed in the United States by the psychoanalyst and psychologist Ruth Cohn, by the therapists Norman Liberman, Isaac Zieman and by other representatives of humanistic psychology. Under the deep impression of the Nazi regime from which Cohn had to flee as a Jew, her overall aim was to assist in creating humane environments which enable personal growth and living learning as a key to improving society. Later, TCI was developed further in Europe and in India. TCI arose from the theoretical background of psychoanalysis, of group therapy and of humanistic psychology; it takes experiences from Gestalt therapy and from group dynamics into account. Ruth Cohn's original purpose was to \\"enable a healthy person to remain healthy\\". Here \\"health\\" not only refers to individual well-being, but also to political responsibility in the world. In the first years after the development of TCI, its use grew rapidly in the United States. Today, however, TCI is virtually unknown in the United States, but it continues to be well- known and an important concept for educators, therapists, supervisors and managers in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, and India.  The concept of TCI  = The basis of TCI = The concept of TCI develops on the basis of three axioms which describe certain problems in dialectical form.Helmut Reiser, Walter Lotz: Themenzentrierte Interaktion als P√§dagogik. Matthias- Gr√ºnewald-Verlag, Mainz 1995, . ; Autonomy : ‚ÄúThe human being is a psycho- biological entity. He/she is also part of the universe, and therefore at once autonomous and interdependent. The person's autonomy increases to the extent that she/he becomes conscious of being interdependent (being part of the universe)‚Äù.Cohn: Von der Psychoanalyse zur Themenzentrierten Interaktion. 1975, p. 120. ; Appreciation : ‚ÄúRespect is due to all living entities and to their growth. Respecting growth requires decisions based on values. The humane is valuable, the inhumane is threatening‚Äù. ; Expanding one's limits : ‚ÄúA free decision happens within conditioning internal and external limits. It is possible to expand these limits‚Äù. = Postulates of TCI = The axioms lead to the following methodical postulates: * Be your own chair person, the chair person of yourself. This means the challenge to see yourself, other persons and the environment in their possibilities and limits, and to accept every situation as a proposition for your own decision. * Disturbances and passionate involvements take precedence. \\"The postulate that disruptions and violent feelings have priority means that we respect the reality of man; and this reality contains the fact that our lively, emotional bodies and souls carry our thoughts and deeds.\\" Cohn: Von der Psychoanalyse zur Themenzentrierten Interaktion. 1975, p. 122. * Be responsible for what you do and do not do - in your personal life and in society.Cohn: Verantworte Dein Tun und dein Lassen ‚Äì pers√∂nlich und gesellschaftlich. In: Themenzentrierte Interaktion. Vol. 8 no. 2, autumn 1994. The postulates should not be seen as rules, but rather as descriptions of fact. Hence: disturbances do take their precedence - whether we let them or not. (If there is a tree lying across the street, the cyclist will have to give it the right of way if he wants to avoid a collision). And similarly for the postulate concerning the chair person: de facto, the human being is responsible for the partial power which he/she has been given. De facto, he/she is responsible for deeds and omissions. But since these postulates are now formulated as imperatives, they want to teach us to act in this way. The first two postulates are known widely by now and have been adopted by many group methods. The first one calls upon the individual to be aware of his/her own feelings and to decide responsibly for himself/herself and others. The second one highlights the fact that hidden disturbances interfere with group processes. They have to be noticed, voiced, and - if necessary - cured to make focused and productive group work possible.http://www.ehornecker.de/Papers/TZI.pdf = The four factor model, and dynamical balance = right The next level of (interaction) methods is most important for group moderation. It says that in group processes, interests of the individual subjects (I), the developing relational pattern of the group (WE) and the problem at hand, the theme (IT) must be in dynamical balance. This is symbolised by a triangle where individual, group and theme form the corners. Whenever one corner dominates, there are negative side effects. E.g. when the theme dominates, this may be a sign that people hide problems, no group feeling and no personal relationships develop. In WE- centered groups, individual views and needs are suppressed and group dynamics may get so overwhelming that no work is done. The theme gives communication a productive focus, but it must be balanced with the other needs. The ‚ÄûWE‚Äú of the group develops from centering on a theme, that is why TCI is termed ‚Äûtheme-centered‚Äú. The triangle itself is placed in a circle, symbolising the GLOBE, that is the organisational, physical, structural, social, political, ecological surroundings, in a narrow and wider sense, which condition and influence the teamwork of the group, and which in turn are influenced by the work of the group. The globe can create disturbances and it can upset dynamical balance, shifting weight to one corner of the triangle. Thus one must always be conscious of the globe and the constraints it produces and take it into account. In earlier times, \\"IT\\" was considered to be the \\"theme\\". In present TCI literature there is a differentiation: the theme on which the group is working is influenced by all four factors, not only by \\"IT\\". This point is specific to TCI. = Auxiliary rules of TCI = The auxiliary rulesCohn: Von der Psychoanalyse zur Themenzentrierten Interaktion 1975. p. 123ff. may have a positive influence on the interactions within a group. \\"It is important that auxiliary rules are used in a diplomatic and not in a dictatorial manner. Every rule can be reduced to absurdity.\\" # Represent yourself in your statements, saying \\"I\\", not \\"we\\" or \\"one\\". The latter forms would mean that you \\"hide\\" behind the group or behind some public opinion. In addition, such a way of communicating would make it easy to represent a hypothesis as a fact which it is not. # If you ask a question, say why you ask and what this question means to you. Reveal yourself as a person and avoid an interview \\"A true question requires informations that are necessary for understanding and for continuing a process. An authentic request for information becomes clearer and more personal if you state the reasons for this request.‚ÄúCohn: Von der Psychoanalyse zur Themenzentrierten Interaktion. 1975, p. 124. # Be authentic and selective in your communications. Be aware of what you think and feel, and choose what you want to say and do. # Restrain yourself as long as possible in interpreting others. Speak of your personal reactions instead. # Hold off from generalisations. Generalisations disrupt the group process. They only serve the discussion if they are used to finalize one subject and introduce a new subject. # If you make a statement concerning behavior or characteristics of another participant, then say also what it means to you that they are the way they are. (i. e. how you see them). # Side discussions take precedence. They are annoying and usually important. They would not happen if they were not important. Even if side discussions are ostensibly disturbing, they are usually important for the deeper levels of communication. They may bring new stimuli, emphasize ambiguities and misunderstandings or expose a disturbed interaction (relation). # Only one person speaks at a time. Nobody can listen to more than one statement at a time. And listening shows the concentrated mutual interest that holds a group together. # If more persons want to speak at the same time, tell each other in keywords what you intend to talk about. So all the subjects are highlighted shortly before group action continues. # Watch body language! Watch your own body language and that of others.  Practical use  Theme- centered interaction is being used in diverse applications: in management, in the university, in psychological guidance and therapy, in supervision, in education, in social and special pedagogy, in adult education, in pastoral care, in care of patients, etc. It is the explicit goal of TCI not only to support the leader, but also to enable a group to lead itself (chair person postulate). In his Ph.D. thesis, Friedrich Ewert Ewert: Themenzentrierte Interaktion (TZI) und p√§dagogische Professionalit√§t von Lehrerinnen und Lehrern, Erfahrungen und Reflexionen. VS Research, Wiesbaden 2008, . has investigated the influence of TCI training upon the professional ability of teachers active in various types of schools and in teacher training. He found a lasting effect of TCI training upon the teaching skills, and a strengthening of their personalities.  Learning TCI  TCI is being taught by members of the Ruth Cohn Institute (RCI) for TCI international.http://www.ruth-cohn- institute.com/index.php?module=010400&dbpage;=35&cmsargs;=en This is an association located in Basel, Switzerland, with sections in all German speaking countries, in the Netherlands, Hungary, Poland, and India. The training consists of two sections: basic training and diploma training. The basic training consists of formation of the personality and of methods, it lasts 6 1/2 weeks and is terminated by a certificate. The diploma training lasts about ten weeks and contains elements like supervision, working in peer groups, more workshops for formation of the personality, and methods. Normally, basic and diploma training take several years. Teaching TCI requires a third level of training which is completed by graduation. Since 1987, RCI international has been publishing a biannual journal \\"Theme-centered interaction\\" through Psychosozial-Verlag, Giessen, Germany. The articles are in German, but for some, there is also an English abstract. Every two years, an International Congress and Exchange Workshop is held on behalf of RCI international. In April, 2012, this was held in Lindau, Germany, celebrating Ruth Cohn's 100th birthday.

Miho Bay has traditionally been one point of connection to the Oki Islands. One ferry to the Oki Islands, name, has a terminus on Nakaumi in Sakaiminato, travels through the Sakai Channel, crosses Miho Bay, and the connects to the Oki Islands across the Sea of Japan. Mihonoseki Incident In 1927, 4 nautical miles from Cape Jiz≈ç, the light cruiser Jintsuu and the Momi-class destroyer Warabi, both ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, collided at the mouth of Miho Bay. There were 92 naval personnel who were killed when the Warabi sunk, and 28 were killed aboard the Jintsuu. The event became known as the . Captain Keiji Mizushiro (1883-1927) was questioned, but committed suicide before the beginning of the trial.

It is the northernmost quoit in the Penwith peninsula and a Scheduled Monument. Etymology The word \\"Sperris\\" is believed to have been derived from the identical Cornish word \\"sperris\\", which means hobgoblin, ghost, or sprite, whereas the word \\"Quoit\\" is believed to derive from the Old French word \\"coite\\", and means \\"a large flat stone atop a cromlech\\", or tomb. History Sperris Quoit is over 4000 years old, and may be older, possibly as old as 7000 years, as it has been dated variously at late- or post- neolithic, and late mesolithic or neolithic.Thomas, Charles & Wailes, Bernard 1967 \`Sperris Quoit [Cornwall]: the excavation of a new Penwith chamber tomb' Cornish Archaeol 6, 1967 9-23, figs, refs.

The site was rediscovered in 1954 by Thomas and Wakes, who excavated it in part. Description The quoit is situated in rough moorland on the side of Zennor Hill, at about 230 metres above sea level, and is close to several rocky outcrops. About 12 metres in diameter, five stones were found during the excavations, two standing, and three fallen, of which one has eroded to a stump, although due to heavy vegetation and dense gorse, only one upright of the chamber is visible, which is over 1.5 metres tall. It is surrounded on all sides by bracken, gorse, and thick vegetation. The capstone is missing entirely. A cremation pit was discovered during the excavations, and the antechamber faces south.

The new Prime Minister was Thanom Kittikachorn, whose son married Praphas' daughter. From 1963 to 1973, he was additionally deputy prime minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Army. During this time, Praphas was the strong man in the background who pulled the strings in the Thanom government. He was known for obscure financial transactions and political intrigues, while sitting on the boards of 44 companies. In 1973, he was replaced as army commander by General Krit Srivara, which signaled his loss of influence. In October 1973 protests against the rigid military rule grew into a massive popular uprising that was answered by a bloody crackdown on the protesting students and democracy activists. The many dead civilians prompted King Bhumibol Adulyadej to intervene. Praphas, Thanom and his son Colonel Narong Kittikachorn went into exile. Praphas returned to Thailand in January 1977, after the military had ended the democratic interlude in October 1976. However, he was not able to exercise political influence again. Died Praphas Charusathien died on 18 August 1997 in Bangkok.

The district was established in 1954 after the consolidation of several township schools. Based on a 381-acre campus south of Cedar Rapids, the district encompasses 137 square miles including the communities of Walford, Fairfax, Swisher, Shueyville, Ely, Southwest Cedar Rapids, and surrounding areas. History =Establishment= The Iowa State Legislature started a series of laws beginning in 1947 to have the Iowa educational system reorganized. At this point in time, there were individual township school districts in existence. In the geographical area that later became the College Community School District, there were three townships involved in the discussion leading to reorganization: Fairfax, College and Putnam Townships. The Fairfax School housed primary through tenth grades, with eleventh and twelfth grades paying tuition to go to Cedar Rapids schools. College Township had 14 one-room school houses that housed primary through tenth grades. Those schools were going to consolidate into one College Township Elementary. Putnam Township had several schools, most notably Ely School. In the early 1950s, the Cedar Rapids School District sent a notification to the school boards of the three townships and indicated that they would no longer accept students from its neighboring school districts for high school. They would be willing, however, to merge those township schools into the Cedar Rapids School District. An election was held in the spring of 1953 to create a new school district instead of merging into the Cedar Rapids District. Thus, in 1954, the College Community School District was established with 3 schools: Ely School in Putnam Township, College Township Elementary in College Township, and Fairfax School in Fairfax. =1954‚Äì1979= In 1954, the School Board along with the advice of several citizen committees, decided to purchase 40 acres of farmland and build a high school across the road from the current College Township Elementary and a few hundred yards west. This remains the site of the current Prairie High School. The elementary schools hosted grades K-7, the high school hosted grades 8-10 (later 8-12). In 1958, 7th through 12th grade students from the Swisher Independent School District attended the College Community Schools for the first time on a tuition basis. Swisher and Jefferson Township (Present-day Shueyville) consolidated into College Community in 1960. Elementary students were taught Swisher and Shueyville schools for the time being. In 1960, a bond issue passed to build a junior high school next to Prairie High School. Prairie Junior High School opened in 1961, housing grades seven through nine. Junior High Schools attended the first Outdoor Education Program at Camp Wapsie in 1962. This program continues in 2011, however, students now attend Outdoor Education week at Camp Io-dis-e-ca south of the district. A bond issue was passed in the spring of 1961 and 25 acres of land east of the high school was purchased for the construction of a new elementary which opened as Prairie Intermediate in 1962. College Township Elementary is renamed Prairie Elementary. Students from Walford started attending College Community Schools in the fall of 1966. On November 18, 1969, a bond issue is passed, authorizing the construction of a new elementary next to Prairie Intermediate. Prairie View opened in 1972, and schools in Swisher, Shueyville, Ely, and Farifax closed, making all schools in the district based on a central campus. In August 1977, the District gave the old College Township Hall to Usher‚Äôs Ferry. That building, as well as the old Fairfax Township Cherry Valley country school building, exists at Ushers Ferry today. In 1975, elementary grades were reconfigured, making Prairie Elementary and Prairie View K-3 schools, and Prairie Intermediate a 4-6 school. The Junior High remained 7-9, and Prairie High School remained 10-12. =1980‚Äì1999= In February 1981, the College Community Schools Foundation was established. It was the first foundation established in Iowa to support a public school district. The name was later changed to ‚ÄúPrairie School Foundation‚Äù. In 1989, freshman leave the Junior High for Prairie High School, and the junior high is renamed Prairie Middle School. In 1993, grade levels are reconfigured again. Prairie Elementary, Prairie Intermediate, and Prairie View house grades K-5, and Prairie Middle School houses grades 6-8. Prairie Elementary is renamed Prairie Heights, and Prairie Intermediate is renamed Prairie Crest. Prairie Oaks, is added at Four Oaks campus on Kirkwood Blvd. in 1996. The name was later changed to Prairie Edge. =2000‚Äìpresent= A bond issue was passed on March 13, 2001, to build a new elementary and for additions to be made at Prairie Heights and Prairie View elementary buildings. In the fall of 2003, Prairie Ridge opened. The largest grade reorganization in district history occurs before the 2009-10 school year. All four elementary schools now house grades PK-4, Prairie Middle School becomes Prairie Creek Intermediate and houses grades five and six, the new Prairie Point Middle School & Ninth Grade Academy houses grades 7-9, and the High School houses grades 10-12. Staggered school start times were initiated to accommodate transportation needs with Prairie Creek Intermediate and Prairie Point Middle School & 9th Grade Academy starting classes at 8:00 am and Prairie Crest, Heights, Ridge and View Elementary buildings and Prairie High School starting classes at 9:00 am. John Wall Field was heavily renovated in the summer of 2011 in preparation for the 2011-12 school year. Improvements include a new storage building and ticket booth behind the north end zone, a new entrance area for the home stands, expanded seating on the home bleachers, brand new bleachers for visiting team fans, and a new Field Turf playing surface, designed for both football and soccer. On April 3, 2012, a bond issue passed, authorizing the building of a fifth elementary to be placed on the old youth baseball complex. A new baseball complex is being built on the far south edge of campus. In late January, the School Board approved the proposed design of the new elementary by OPN Architects. The design is similar to that of Prairie Ridge Elementary. Shortly thereafter, a contest to name the school began. On March 11, 2013, the school board approved naming the new building Prairie Hill Elementary. It was announced on April 11, 2012, that students will be issued a district-owned computer, starting the 2012-13 school year. All students in grades 9-12 are provided with 11-inch MacBook Air laptops, to use at school and at home. On January 31, 2013, district superintendent John Speer told media that Prairie High School Principal Mark Gronemeyer was going to resign from his position, effective immediately. Gronemeyer was subsequently reassigned to a newly created job in the district office for the remainder of the year, given the title of Secondary Curriculum Specialist. Both resignations and the reassignment were approved on February 1. Many in the community began to wonder why the district would unexpectedly reassign the principal in the middle of the term to a newly created position, knowing he would resign at the end of the year, and rumors began that an incident occurred that forced the school board to remove him from Prairie High School. Speer said he could not directly comment on the suspicious nature of the situation. Associate Principal Erik Anderson was named Principal on an interim basis on February 1. =Future= In 2004, a Citizen's Advisory Committee on School Facilities was formed to determine the district's future. Phase 1 of the plan was to open the new Concert Hall at College community, and to reorganize grade levels with the opening of Prairie Point. Phase 2 is to build Prairie Hill Elementary and open the new baseball complex. Phase 3 of the plan was to expand Prairie High School by building more classrooms and lockers, demolishing the music 'Circle' and building new rehearsal rooms, building new office space where the circle was, and converting the old office into classroom space. However, a new Advisory committee will be established in the fall to determine a new long-term plan, putting the 2004 committee's phase 3 in jeopardy. Schools =Prairie High School= Prairie High School opened in 1956. Originally holding grades 8-10, it has gone from being a 10-12 school to a 9-12 school to currently being a 10-12 school again. The high school is home to the Concert Hall at College Community and the College Community Theatre, as well as offices for the school board. Construction has occurred in 1957, 1963, 1989, 1990, 2000, 2001, and 2006. =Prairie Point Middle School & Ninth Grade Academy= Prairie Point opened in 2009, housing grades 7-9. Many traditions from the old middle school (7th grade outdoor education week, 8th grade Washington, D.C. trip) have been continued on to the new building =Prairie Creek Intermediate= Prairie Creek opened in 1961 as Prairie Junior High, housing grades 7-9. In 1989, the building became Prairie Middle School, housing grades seven and eight until sixth graders joined in 1993. In 2009, the building became Prairie Creek Intermediate, hosting grades five and six. Construction has occurred in this building in 1962, 1987, and 1998. =Prairie Heights Elementary= Opening in 1954 as College Township Elementary, Prairie Heights is the oldest active building in the district. College Township Elementary was renamed Prairie Elementary in 1962, then Prairie Heights Elementary in 1993. A famous wooden playground was built in four days in 1988 by volunteers, students and parents. This playground was worn out and replaced in the summer of 2010, much to the chagrin of students and alumni. Construction occurred here in 1961, 1995, and 2002. =Prairie Crest Elementary= Opening as Prairie Intermediate in 1962, the school hosted grades 4-6 until 1993, when it held grades K-5 and was renamed Prairie Crest. The school currently hosts grades PK-4. Construction occurred here in 1965, 1969, and 1997. =Prairie View Elementary= Opening in 1972, Prairie View originally hosted grades K-3. From 1993 to 2009, the school hosted grades K-5. The school currently hosts grades PK-4. Construction occurred in 1995 and 2002. =Prairie Ridge Elementary= Opening in 2003, Ridge housed grades K-5 until 2009, when the school became a PK-4 school. =Prairie Hill Elementary= On April 3, 2012, a bond issue passed, authorizing the building of a fifth elementary to be placed on the old youth baseball complex. In late January, the School Board approved the proposed design of the new elementary by OPN Architects. The design is similar to that of Prairie Ridge Elementary. Shortly thereafter, a contest to name the school began. On March 11, 2013, the school board approved the new school to be named Prairie Hill Elementary, after it overwhelmingly won a student vote, earning 737 votes compared to the 388 votes garnered by the second most popular name, Prairie Peak. Other finalists included Summit, Grove, and Fields. Prairie Hill will house grades PK-4, and is set to be open for the 2014-2015 school year.

However women's football is not included in the country's FIFA coordinated Goals! project. By 2011, inside the Saudi Arabia Football Federation, there has been an effort to create women's football programs at universities. Input had been sought on how to do this from other national federations including ones from the United States, Germany, Brazil and the United Kingdom. On the men's side of the game, the national federation has funded efforts to improve the quality of the Saudi Arabia men's national football team. History Founded in 2006, King's United women football club was the first women's football club in the country. In 2009, they trained in Jeddah. The team was initially sponsored by Prince Alwaleed bin Talal but facing scrutiny in the face of intense media coverage, he withdrew his support in 2009. In 2012, the team trained three times a week outside the sight of men, with players wearing traditional football kit of short sleeved shirts and shorts. The team is coached by Reema Abdullah who also is the team's striker. It has 35 players who range in age from 13 to 35. Other women's teams have been created in the country in cities like Riyadh and Dammam and a tournament was held in 2008, with seven teams competing and the event being won by King's United. The first match between two female teams in the country occurred in January 2008 when the Prince Mohammad bin Fahd University team beat Al-Yamamah College in a match played at Dammam's 35,000-spectator capacity Prince Mohamed bin Fahd Stadium in a shootout victory before an all-women audience. The player of the match was Al-Yamamah College's goalkeeper. In March 2009, a women's charity football match was held between a team called \\"University\\" and a team called \\"Barcelona\\" that was attended by 400 female fans and no men. The game was won 2‚Äì1 by University and earned SR81,000 ($21,598) to go towards people with disabilities in the eastern part of the kingdom. , no data was available for the number of women's football players in the country. In 2006, there was international uproar when Saudi authorities sought to prevent women from attending a game between the Saudi Arabia national football team and the Sweden national football team. In 2008, the situation for women's football in the Middle East was said by author Gary Brecher to be up there in popularity of freedom and democracy in the region. An all-women's school sporting competition was held at Effat University in 2010. The tournament was investigated by Saudi authorities because, according to Ahmed al-Zahrani, director of the Girls Education Department in Jeddah, the country does not have \\"any regulations that say that it's okay for girl schools to hold sports classes or training\\". In 2011, women's football was seen as a way to combat a growing problem of obesity in the country. Football is the most popular sport for Saudi women. However, there is no official football academies, clubs or school leagues. The Saudi women succeeded in creating more than 10 recreational teams across the country, most of the teams are based in the big cities: Riyadh, Jeddah and Khobar. National team and Football league The Saudi Arabia women's national football team would be the national team representing the kingdom in international football. However, the team does not yet exist because of influence of misogynistic religious leaders in Saudi Arabia, systematic discrimination against women's sport, and active opposition of political leaders and sport administrators. International pressure has come to bear on the country to field a women's team, and FIFA now allows the hijab to be worn in competition. A meeting at the College of Business Administration in Jeddah was seen as a possible first step in a team eventually being created. In 2008, due to the influence of conservative religious leaders in the country, the creation of a FIFA recognised women's national team was banned by law. Growing the game and having an opportunity to have a women's national team has been hindered by the systematic discrimination that all women's sport is subject to in the country. Saudi Arabia's Olympic Committee head Nawaf bin Faisal is quoted as saying that the committee should \\"not be endorsing any female participation at the moment\\". In November 2011, Ahmad Eid Al-Harbi, vice president of the Player Status Committee for the Saudi Arabian Football Federation, said of the creation of a women's national team: \\"Saudi society is a very conservative one, even when it comes to men‚Äôs clubs. No one can imagine his daughter playing in front of thousands of people wearing shorts, such as in soccer.\\" Leaders in Saudi Arabian sport held a meeting in mid-2011 at the College of Business Administration in Jeddah where they discussed women's sport and possible participation of women as part of the Saudi Arabian national team at the Olympic Games. They were inspired by the example of seven other Arab nations having successfully created women's national football teams. During 2012 opposition to women's participation in sport softened with the national Olympic Committee and the Saudi Embassy in London announcing that women's participation at the 2012 Summer Olympics would be permitted if they were invited. No Saudi women's national football team competed at the 2012 London Olympics, despite extensive pressure from the International Olympic Committee. Still, in 2012, the national federation was quietly arguing with the International Football Association Board not to allow women's participation if they were wearing the hijab while playing. The logic they followed was that if FIFA allowed women to wear the hijab in recognised matches, it would be much more difficult for the federation to prevent a national team from being created. There is a lot of pressure being put on the sporting community to allow national representation of women as the kingdom would likely be the only nation in the world to prohibit women from competing at the Olympics. A female football player in the country in 2012 said of the situation as it pertains to the national team: \\"Our generation started the game, the leagues, the structure. The next generation will have it on a silver platter. We may not get to play for a national team but we're laying the groundwork.\\" These issues persisted in 2016. Women were prohibited from participating in regional and national championships in football. The climate is still hostile, with Saudi clerics in 2015 saying, women participating were \\"steps of the devil‚Äù. Team creation and development was also hampered by the Saudi Arabia national Olympic committee lacking a section for the development of women's sport. Some obstacles for the creation of a national team were removed with women being allowed to represent the country at the Youth Olympics. Female players in the country were optimistic in October 2017 about a team being created in the near future as a result of the Vision 30 plan, which is supported by the King with the goal of increasing women's participation in all parts of Saudi culture including in sports. 2014 was also seen as a year with forward progress as women were allowed to enter stadiums in the country to watch men's football for the first time. However, women entered stadiums for the first time in January 2018. The team still did not officially exist as of June 2019. In December 2019, Jeddah Eagles won Jeddah Women's Football League, the first women competition organized by the Saudi Arabia Football Federation. In February 2020, Saudi Arabia decided to launch a football league for women in the whole country.

C. readae is one of the oldest occurrences of the winter-hazel genus Corylopsis, which includes between seven and thirty species, all found in Asia. Fossils from two other occurrences are of similar age to C. readae, with Paleocene specimens from Greenland being placed in the form taxon Corylopsiphyllum and an Eocene Alaskan fossil being included in Corylopsis without species placement. History and classification Corylopsis reedae is represented by a single counterpart compression fossil specimen from the Ypresian-aged Klondike Mountain Formation that outcrops in Republic, Ferry County, Washington. The age of the formation is based on Argon‚Äìargon dating, which has returned a date of 49.4 ¬±0.5 million years old. The fossil was recovered from the \\"Corner lot\\", University of Washington site UWBM A0307, located within the city limits of Republic. The holotype specimen for Corylopsis reedae is numbered UWBM 71085 and currently preserved in the paleobotanical collections of University of Washington in Seattle, Washington. The specimen was studied by paleobotanists Meghan G. Radtke and Kathleen B. Pigg of the School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University, and Wesley C. Wehr of the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture in Seattle. Radtke, Pigg and Wehr published their 2005 type description for C. readae in the International Journal of Plant Sciences. The etymology of the specific name readae was derived from Katherine (\\"Kitty\\") M. Reed in honor of her contributions to the Tertiary stratigraphy and paleontology of the Pacific northwest. Description The specimen used for the description of C. readae is an incomplete simple, elliptical leaf. The preserved section of leaf is long with the overall length estimated to have been approximately and is at the widest point. The base of the specimen is slightly asymmetric with a 102¬∞ angle, also slightly obtuse. The pinnate secondary veins diverge from the primary vein at an angles ranging from 18¬∞ near the base to 13¬∞-14¬∞ nearing the center area of the leaf. They form a craspedodromous pattern with the secondaries alternating along the primary vein. The basal most secondary veins produce numerous compound agrophic veins. The preserved teeth on the fossil show simple teeth with straight bases and concave apexes, though due to the lack of full teeth the overall length of the teeth is not known.

It is distributed widely across northern Africa, including Morocco, Mauritania, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria, Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti, as well as the Middle East, including Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, and possibly Saudi Arabia and southern Turkey. Its European range includes the Iberian Peninsula, southern France, and Cyprus. Taxonomy The genus was introduced by W.E. Leach (1815: 391). It was only the second genus of scorpion as all species known to this date were included in the sole genus Scorpio Linn√©, 1758. Leach found Scorpio occitanus Amoreux, 1789 to differ from the other species of Scorpio known to him by having eight eyes (two median eyes and six lateral eyes) instead of six (two median eyes and four lateral eyes). C.L. Koch (1837) expanded this concept and subdivided the scorpions in four families according to the number of their eyes. He named his second family, the \\"eight-eyed scorpions\\", Buthides. The use of the number of eyes in the classification of scorpions has been discarded since, however the name Buthidae is still in use for the most diverse family of scorpions. =Diversity= The content of this genus may vary, depending on the authority. The best known species, B. occitanus, was once thought to be widespread from southern France, throughout Spain and Morocco, along the southern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, and eastwards as far as Israel. However, recent research has shown that it forms a highly diverse cluster of closely related but separate species. A number of taxa formerly considered as subspecies or \\"varieties\\" have been granted full species status, others have been described as entirely new. The Moroccan Atlas region is a hot-spot of diversity with at least 14 species (40% of all known species). This diversity is explained by the topography which led to a high degree of speciation in populations which are separated from others by mountain ranges. Four species are considered to occur in Europe: B. occitanus (southern France, eastern and southern Spain), B. montanus (mountain ranges of southeastern Spain), B. ibericus (western Spain and Portugal), and B. kunti (Cyprus). At least 35 species are known, many of which are quite similar in appearance: *Buthus adrianae Rossi, 2013 *Buthus albengai Louren√ßo, 2003 *Buthus amri Louren√ßo, Yaƒümur & Duhem, 2010 *Buthus atlantis Pocock, 1889 *Buthus awashensis Kova≈ô√≠k, 2011 *Buthus barcaeus Birula, 1909 *Buthus barbouri Werner, 1932 *Buthus berberensis Pocock, 1900 *Buthus bonito Louren√ßo & Geniez, 2005 *Buthus boumalenii Touloun & Boumezzough, 2011 *Buthus brignolii Louren√ßo, 2003 *Buthus chambiensis Kova≈ô√≠k, 2006 *Buthus confluens Louren√ßo, Touloun & Boumezzough, 2012 *Buthus draa Louren√ßo & Slimani, 2004 *Buthus dunlopi Kova≈ô√≠k, 2006 *Buthus egyptiensis Louren√ßo, 2012 *Buthus elhennawyi Louren√ßo, 2005 *Buthus elizabethae Louren√ßo, 2005 *Buthus elmoutakoualiki Louren√ßo & Qi, 2006 *Buthus elongatus Rossi, 2012 *Buthus hassanini Louren√ßo, Duhem & Cloudsley-Thompson, 2012 *Buthus ibericus Louren√ßo & Vachon, 2004 *Buthus insolitus Borelli, 1925 *Buthus intumescens (Hemprich in Hemprich & Ehrenberg, 1828) *Buthus israelis Shulov & Amitai, 1959 *Buthus jianxinae Louren√ßo, 2005 *Buthus kunti Yaƒümur, Ko√ß & Louren√ßo, 2011 *Buthus lienhardi Louren√ßo, 2003 *Buthus Louren√ßoi Rossi, Tropea & Yaƒümur, 2013 *Buthus malhommei Vachon, 1949 *Buthus mardochei Simon, 1878 *Buthus mariaefrancae Louren√ßo, 2003 *Buthus maroccanus Birula, 1903 *Buthus montanus Louren√ßo & Vachon, 2004 *Buthus occidentalis Louren√ßo, Sun & Zhou, 2009 *Buthus occitanus (Amoreux, 1789) type species *Buthus orientalis (Louren√ßo, Simon 2012) *Buthus paris (C.L.

Coloration is generally yellow, with different tones of brown to red-brown. Darker patterns may occur on various parts of the body. The pedipalps (pincers) are relatively gracile with slender digits and a globose base. The cephalothorax bears strong ornamentation with small granules arranged to form carinae (ridges). The most prominent carinae form a lyra- shaped pattern behind the median eyes in many species. The mesosoma is also often granulated and commonly bears three ridges on the tergites. The metasoma is slender but not thin with well developed carinae of granules, and some short spines in some species. A large vesicle terminates in a sharp and long aculeus (stinger). =Toxicity= Though generally not considered lethal, the venom of Buthus species is considered of medical importance. They form a considerable part of scorpion envenomation cases, especially in northern Africa. According to a study by Touloun et al. (2001) scorpions of the B. occitanus complex caused 26% of all recorded cases in southwestern Morocco, but none of them resulted in death. Habitat Species of Buthus live in semi-arid to arid climate in various terrains, from mountain valleys to coastal plains mostly with sparse vegetation, even in deserts. As most scorpions they are predominantly nocturnal and hide in shallow burrows, most commonly below stones. External links * Images of various species of Buthus. The Scorpion Fauna.

It was located on a high bank on the west side of modern Fort Frances, Ontario across from International Falls, Minnesota on the Rainy River downstream (west) of some rapids (Chaudi√®re portage) where the river flows out of Rainy Lake. Upstream at the outlet of the lake was the old French post of Fort Saint Pierre (1731-1758). The site is marked by a granite boulder. MortonArthur S Morton, \\"A History of Western Canada\\",page 427 describes some runable rapids, Fort Saint Pierre and a fall that had to be portaged before reaching the fort, which implies that the river level may have changed. The place was a depot rather than a trading post and served two purposes. By this time the trade had reached the rich Lake Athabasca country which was too far to reach from Montreal in one season. Each May, when the ice broke up, boats with trade goods would head west from Montreal and winterers with canoe-loads of fur would head east. They would meet at Grand Portage on Lake Superior, exchange goods and head back before the freezup. To further save time goods and furs would be shuttled between Grand Portage and Lac la Pluie. Second, it was a source of food. The voyageurs had no time to hunt and it was difficult to haul food from Montreal. Rainy Lake produced wild rice and fish. The fort also built kegs and canoes. With the growth of pemmican production around Lake Winnipeg its importance as a food source diminished. It declined further when the two companies merged and trade shifted from Montreal to Hudson Bay. In 1792 two men were killed while out fishing. Around 1795 John McKay (fur trader) of the Hudson's Bay Company had a rival post nearby. With the merger of the two firms in 1821 it was taken over by the Hudson's Bay Company. In 1830 it was named Fort Frances in honor of Governor Simpson's new wife. Its date of closure is uncertain. For the trade route in general see Winnipeg River.

CHED was previously subclassified into two subtypes: CHED1 and CHED2. However in 2015, the International Classification of Corneal Dystrophies (IC3D) renamed the condition \\"CHED1\\" to become posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy, and renamed the condition \\"CHED2\\" to become, simply, CHED. Consequently, the scope of this article is restricted to the condition currently referred to as CHED  Signs and symptoms  CHED presents congenitally, but has a stationary course. The cornea exhibits a variable degree of clouding: from a diffuse haze, to a \\"ground glass\\" appearance, with occasional focal gray spots. The cornea thickens to between two and three times is normal thickness. Rarely, sub-epithelial band keratopathy and elevated intraocular pressure occur. Patients have blurred vision and nystagmus, however it is rare for the condition to be associated with either epiphora or photophobia with this.  Genetics  CHED exhibits autosomal recessive inheritance, with 80% of cases linked to mutations in SLC4A11 gene. The SLC4A11 gene encodes solute carrier family 4, sodium borate transporter, member 11.  Pathology  Histologically, the Descemet's membrane in CHED becomes diffusely thickened and laminated. Multiple layers of basement membrane-like material appear to form on the posterior part of Descemet's membrane. The endothelial cells are sparse - they become atrophic and degenerated, with many vacuoles. The corneal stroma becomes severely disorganised; the lamellar arrangement of the fibrils becomes disrupted. Management Management of CHED primarily involves corneal transplantation. The age that corneal transplantation is required is variable, however, it is usually necessary fairly early in life.

Whiteford, Published: November 5, 2013 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001547 Among the 10 countries studied, the number of people who would suffer from depression during their lives falls within an 8‚Äì12% range in most of them. In North America, the probability of having a major depressive episode within any year-long period is 3‚Äì5% for males and 8‚Äì10% for females.  Demographic dynamics  Population studies have consistently shown major depression to be about twice as common in women as in men, although it is as of yet unclear why this is so. The relative increase in occurrence is related to pubertal development rather than chronological age, reaches adult ratios between the ages of 15 and 18, and appears associated with psychosocial more than hormonal factors. People are most likely to suffer their first depressive episode between the ages of 30 and 40, and there is a second, smaller peak of incidence between ages 50 and 60. The risk of major depression is increased with neurological conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, or multiple sclerosis and during the first year after childbirth. The risk of major depression has also been related to environmental stressors faced by population groups such as war combatants or physicians in training. It is also more common after cardiovascular illnesses, Studies conflict on the prevalence of depression in the elderly, but most data suggest there is a reduction in this age group. Depressive disorders are most common in urban than in rural population and, in general, the prevalence is higher in groups with adverse socio-economic factors (for example in homeless people)Psychiatry, 4th edition - Oxford University Press, 2012 by By John Geddes, Jonathan Price, Rebecca McKnight page 222 Data on the relative prevalence of major depression among different ethnic groups have reached no clear consensus. However, the only known study to have covered dysthymia specifically found it to be more common in African and Mexican Americans than in European Americans. Projections indicate that depression may be the second leading cause of life lost after heart disease by 2020. In 2016, a study found an association between hormonal contraception and depression.

She has been described as an \\"entrepreneur and critic\\", and pioneered the artistamp, a postage-stamp-sized medium. She has been prominent in the mail art movement since the early 1970s, acting as a bridge between the movement's early history and its second generation. As a publisher, Banana launched Vile magazine and the \\"Banana Rag\\" newsletter; the latter became Artistamp News in 1996. Banana lives in British Columbia and operates Banana Productions, calling herself the \\"Top Banana\\". The International Art Post is the sole publication of Banana Productions, with 700 copies produced for each edition. Career Banana attended the University of British Columbia from 1958 to 1963, graduating with an elementary academic teaching certificate. She taught for five years: two in public schools and three in Vancouver's New School.Radical School Reform, Simon & Schuster, 1969. She began her career in Victoria as a fabric artist, where dissatisfaction with the marketing of her work led toward more-public expressions. In 1971, she declared herself the Town Fool of Victoria and organized a series of interactive events, eventually creating a newsletter, the Banana Rag, to reach a broader audience.Victor Brand, In Numbers; Serial Publications by Artists Since 1955, 2009 by PPP Editions in association with Andrew Roth Inc. She sent a copy to Vancouver artist Gary Lee Nova, who replied with an image-bank request list providing names, addresses and image requests of contemporary mail artists. This began a forty-year relationship with a worldwide, egalitarian art-communication network. Like many mail artists, she embraced an alter ego, Anna Banana, eventually her legal name which she incorporated into correspondence with Ray Johnson, General Idea and the network. BananaPost '89 artistamps by Anna Banana, 1989In 1973 Banana moved to San Francisco to join mail-art friends known as the Bay Area Dadaists, who produced Neo-Dadaist performances, mail art and publications. She worked as a typesetter at a print shop, where the first issue of her magazine Vile magazine was printed in 1974. The shop‚ÄîSpeedprint‚Äîwas a place she told writer Gretchen Wagner, \\"where it became apparent to me that anyone could be a publisher\\".Gretchen L. Wagner, \\"Riot on the Page; Thirty Years of Zines by Women\\", in Modern Women; Women Artists at the Museum of Modern Art, 2010 Originally envisioned as a place to document and acknowledge network activity, Vile was a combination of art, poetry, fiction, letters, photos and manipulated advertisements from Life magazine. It was predominantly a visual publication, examining the flood of images emerging from mass communication. It was also a response to File magazine's shift towards mainstream art coverage. Gwen Allen wrote, \\"FILE would continue to publish the Image Bank image request lists until its Fall 1975 issue, but it would gradually distance itself from the mail art scene, prompting a string of takeoffs, including VILE‚Äîstarted, according to editor Anna Banana, in response to FILE's growing disdain for mail art'‚Äîand later, BILE and SMILE.\\"Gwen Allen, Artists' Magazines; an Alternate Space for Art, MIT Press, 2011 Between 1974 and 1981, Banana published seven issues of VILE; editions four, six and seven were edited by her partner, Bill Gaglione. During its run, Vile explored a wide range of formats and media defining the mail-art genre. Banana cited as influences Dada humor, therapeutic madness and the Bohemianism of the Bay Area during the 1960s and early 1970s. Viles nihilism fit the punk attitude on the rise in Britain and the United States at the time. After returning to Canada in 1981, Banana published About Vile, a history of the magazine with a mail-art backlog and an account of a 1978 European tour by her and Gaglione (a documented conclusion of the pair's working relationship). That year Banana also organized a \\"Banana Art\\" event for the Global Television Network, held at Bridges Restaurant on Granville Island, Vancouver. From 1983 to 1985, Banana worked in the production department of Intermedia Press, where she learned full-color printing (a skill used in her 1988 publication, International Art Post). IAP featured dry- gummed, pin-hole perforated sheets consisting of full-color stamps designed by artists. The works were financed cooperatively, with participating artists receiving 500 copies of their stamp and Banana Productions retaining the remainder for sales and promotion. IAP has become an annual publication; the 24th edition was released in October 2011. In 1990, Banana created the Artistamp Collector's Album, a cloth bound limited edition of forty-nine silk- screened ring binders to house the IAP and the Artistamp News (letter) (ASN) (begun by Banana in 1991). Eight issues of ASN were published. Artist profiles, stamp news, new editions and several \\"tipped-in\\" (inserted and affixed as individual sheets, as opposed to being bound together in folded signatures) color stamps were featured in each issue. Banana then returned to general mail-art topics in the Banana Rag; edition 41 was published in September 2011. In 1991, Banana created a miniature book and stamp sheet, 20 Years of Fooling Around with A. Banana, as the catalog for her twenty-year retrospective at the grunt gallery in Vancouver. Deluxe editions of the book feature stamps tipped-in over the black-and-white illustrations. She has received a number of grants from the Canada Council between 1975 and 2009. = Writing = In addition to the account of her years at the New School and editorials in Vile, Banana Rag and Artistamp News, Banana contributed two articles (\\"Mail Art Canada\\" and \\"Women in Mail Art\\") to the 1984 book Correspondence Art; Source Book for the Network of International Postal Art Activity published by La Mamelle. These articles were reprinted in 1984 in FFFlue, volume 4, numbers 3 and 4. Other print appearances include \\"The Transformation of Anne Long\\" in the March 1972 Maclean's magazine and \\"Banana Olympics: Sporty Art or Arty Sport\\" in the September 1980 Recreation Reporter. The magazine Rubberstampmadness published a series of her articles on mail artists: \\"Jeanie Eberhardt; the EberPlex Stamp Works\\" (September‚ÄìOctober 2002); \\"Brain Waves at High Tide\\" (May‚ÄìJune 2001); \\"Mail Art Book Reviews: Umbrella Anthology & Mail Stones\\" (January‚ÄìFebruary 2001); \\"The Danish Mail Art Bug/Frank & Witta Jensen\\", Mar./Apr. 2000; \\"The Italian Connection/Vittore Baroni\\", Nov./Dec., 1999; \\"The Personal Touch/Peter & Angela Netmail\\", (May‚ÄìJune 1998) and \\"Artistamps in the Evolving Mail-Art Network\\" (May‚ÄìJune 1997). Banana's review, \\"Big is Beautiful at Venice Biennale\\", appeared in the August 1, 1999 Coast Independent and \\"Size does matter at Venice Biennale\\" in the August 26‚ÄìSeptember 2, 1999, free Vancouver weekly, The Georgia Straight. \\"Strategies of Audience Engagement\\" appeared in the 2005 book, DIY Survival. = Interactive events = In 1974, Banana accepted a job at the San Francisco Bay Guardian pasting up advertising pages. She filled the one-inch-by-one- column ad holes with invitations to her events; the first entry was for the 1974 Columbus Day Parade, offering \\"degrees of Bananology\\" to those who participated or sent banana news. In 1975, the Guardian ran a full-page ad for her Banana Olympics. It attracted over 100 contestants, who dressed up to compete in the overhand banana throw, the water-balance race and the four- legged race. Winners were those who crossed the finish line with the most \\"appeal\\", based on costume and style. It took place in the Embarcadero Plaza (with help from volunteers and the New Games Foundation), and was covered in the San Francisco Chronicle and the San Francisco Examiner. In 1980, Banana was invited by art curator Rosa Ho to present the Banana Olympics at the Surrey, British Columbia Art Gallery. The event was funded by the Canada Council, the British Columbia Arts Council and the municipality of Surrey. Originally scheduled for April Fool's Day, the event was delayed for three months while Ho defended it to a Surrey councillor who believed the event was not art; this inspired Banana to create the Bureaucrat's Marathon: three steps forward, two backwards and one to each side. The event took place on 13 July on the athletic field bordering the gallery, with over 100 participants. Banana and Gaglione finished the year with a Canadian tour (Toward the Future, a program of futurist theatre works) in fifteen cities across Canada from Victoria to Halifax. = Performances = Throughout the 1970s, Banana continued with parade entries, April Fool's Day events, and collaborations with Bay-area Dadaists on Dada sound poetry and Italian Futurist syntheses presented at the San Francisco Book Fair, San Jose State University and the Saturday Afternoon Club in Ukiah. In 1978, Banana and Gaglione presented their \\"Futurist Sound\\" performance in A Literal Exchange at A Space in Toronto. That fall they began a European tour arranged through Banana's mail-art network, presenting \\"Futurist Sound\\" and her Banana Olympics film in 29 cities in 11 countries. In 1979 they presented the works again at the Living Art Performance Festival in Vancouver, and in 1980 at San Francisco State University, the San Francisco Art Institute, San Jose State University, the Inter-Dada 80 Festival in Ukiah, San Diego State University, University of California, Irvine and Long Beach, and the LA Dada festival in Los Angeles. In 1981 Banana moved back to Vancouver and received funding for a new solo work, \\"Why Banana?\\". Beginning in the fall of 1982, she began presenting \\"Why Banana?\\" in nine cities across Canada, at the University of South Carolina and Modern Realism in Dallas, Texas. That year her Going Bananas Fashion Contest was also hosted live on CKVU's Vancouver Show, attracting 25 participants. Banana's performances and tours continued through the 1980s. During the San Francisco InterDADA 84 Festival she performed her In the Red, was Greeter at the Headquarters and lectured at the Goethe Institute.Lloyd, Ginny (January 2015) InterDADA 84: True DADA Confessions. TropiChaCha Press. In the 1990s she continued with an installation and performance in Copenhagen and performances of \\"Why Banana?\\" in Ume√•, Sweden and at In the Red/In the Black in Den Haag, Netherlands. In 1993 she presented herself as Dr. Anna Freud Banana of the Specific Research Institute, who discovered the psychology behind the \\"New German Banana Consciousness\\". In each of 12 venues Banana installed 105 blow- ups of newspaper and magazine articles about bananas from the German press (supporting her claim that Germany had gone bananas) and asking visitors to take her Roar Shack Banana Peel Test and Personality Inventory for Banana Syndrome (based on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory). Banana's most recent interactive research, \\"But is it Art?...\\", asks her audience to record their yes-or-no responses to 30 images of artworks (many banana-themed) on her Specific Research response form. Participants then complete the reverse side with name, contact information, age, education, answer questions about art, draw a self-portrait and complete a \\"turn these lines into something recognizable\\" exercise. As with all her interactive works, Banana is more interested in ascertaining how much her audience will engage in her research than whether the images she projects are considered art. In 2009 she presented this work in Rome, Cararra, Gent, Minden, Berlin, Annaberg, Budapest, Bremen and Aarlborg, in 2010 in Victoria, BC and in 2011 in Charleroi, Belgium, Maastricht, Netherlands, Bergish-Gladbach and Berlin, Germany. = Curating = In 1983, Banana organized a mail-art show (\\"Show Your Colors\\") for the Arts, Sciences and Technology Center in Vancouver, producing a catalog for the 246 artists (from 32 countries) who participated. In 1987 she curated the performance series for the Artropolis Show in Vancouver, producing a new work with Ron Brunette (The World Series) presented at the Western Front. In 1998, Banana curated \\"Artistamps\\", an exhibit from the International Mail-Art Network of her collection of mail art, for the Sechelt Art Center in Sechelt, British Columbia. With minor changes, it was remounted in 1999 as the \\"Popular Art of Postal Parody\\" at the Richmond, B.C. Art Gallery and in 2000 at the Open Space Gallery in Victoria. = Exhibitions = Some of Banana's work has been part of larger exhibitions: * Anna Banana: 45 Years of Fooling Around with A.

Her departure is mark by chaotic and sometimes violent confrontations. In a caf√©, she meets a mysterious stranger who works in a nearby psychiatric clinic. There, she is introduced by a nurse and made to answer a questionnaire which she views on a cinema screen, the words printed on a purple background. Meanwhile, a civil conflict seems to be raging, with checkpoints, sounds of shooting and the reappearance of Nicholas in chains. He is allowed to visit Paulina at the clinic but is carted off the next day as a deserter, having told Paulina that Oliver has left for the forest to join a rebel group. Paulina is then sold by the clinic to a brothel, which is the only functioning institution and extant building in the town and which is presided over by Hortense, a former opera singer, and the old uncle.

As executive director of the Atlanta Urban League from 1943 to 1960, Hamilton was involved in issues of housing, health care, schools and voter registration within the black community. She was 1964 co-founder of the bi-racial Partners for Progress to help government and the private sector effect compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In 1973, Hamilton became a principal architect for the revision of the Atlanta City Charter. She was advisor to the United States Civil Rights Commission from 1985 to 1987. Early life and background Grace Towns was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on February 10, 1907, to community activist parents George Alexander Towns Sr. and Nellie McNair Towns. She was the second of five children. Her sister Helen had died in 1905. Grace was followed by siblings George Jr. in 1909, Myron in 1910 and Harriet in 1920. The Towns family lived at University Place at Atlanta University, where the children's playmates were racially mixed. Atlanta University had been integrated since the 19th century. The family belonged to the First Congregational Church, where the members were active in civic affairs. Nellie Towns was involved in many outreach endeavors of the church. Grace joined the church's Atlanta Interracial Student Forum, and also became an active member of the YWCA. = Father's background= George Alexander Towns Sr. was an educator, poet and playwright who received degrees from both Atlanta University and Harvard University. At Atlanta University he taught English, Pedagogy and debate skills until his 1929 retirement. His professional colleagues included James Weldon Johnson and W. E. B. Du Bois. Towns was active in civic affairs, an officer of the NAACP, and an advocate for voter registration drives in the black community. He was born one of six children on March 5, 1870, in Albany, Georgia, to freed slave Luke Towns Jr. and Mary Colt, said to be of Indian blood. Luke Towns Sr. was a slave fathered by a white man named John Towns, who was also the father of George Washington Towns. Luke Towns Sr. wed a Cherokee woman named Maria. George Alexander Towns Sr. died December 20, 1960. =Mother's background= Harriet Eleanor \\"Nellie\\" McNair had been a student of George Alexander Towns Sr., and later entered the teaching profession. She was born in 1879 to parents Felix and Hattie Cherry McNair, but at some point her father had left, and Hattie was the sole parent in the family. The McNair family were all members of the First Congregational Church in Atlanta. After marrying George Towns in 1902, she engaged in community outreach programs sponsored by her church. She also helped found the Gate City Free Kindergarten Association for the children of working black parents. She was the first black woman to serve on the board of Atlanta's YWCA. Her mother Hattie McNair lived with the family until her death. Nellie McNair Towns died on May 11, 1967. =Marriage= In Ware Memorial Chapel on the grounds of Atlanta University, 23-year-old Grace Towns married 31-year-old Henry Cooke \\"Cookie\\" Hamilton on June 7, 1930. Both the Towns and Hamilton families had backgrounds with the university, as well as with Atlanta's First Congregational Church. Cookie's father and grandfather were prominent African- American building contractors in Atlanta. The couple's only child, Eleanor, was born in 1931. Cookie died on January 2, 1987. =Education= Oglethorpe Practice School was established on Atlanta University's campus in 1905. It offered grades K‚Äì7, with the senior class gaining experience in the teaching profession. After several years of having a private tutor in her parents' home, Grace Towns transferred to Oglethorpe for her last two years at that level. Her high-school education was the preparatory school at the university, the era's only city high school available to black students. She earned a Bachelor of Arts from Atlanta University in 1927. In 1929, she was awarded her master's degree in psychology from Ohio State University. Her brief sojourn as a student in Ohio was her initial experience with segregation. While she was aware of the effect of segregation on the African-American community, Atlanta University's integrated campus had sheltered her from being a part of it. Living in Columbus, Ohio, and working as a secretary at the YWCA brought her face-to-face with the effects of segregation and tokenism. After she and her husband Cookie Hamilton returned to live in Atlanta in 1941, she took two graduate courses at Atlanta University, one taught by family friend W. E. B. Dubois, and the other taught by former Director for Research at the National Urban League, Ira De Augustine Reid. Early career (1930‚Äì1942) Prior to her marriage, Grace Towns had taught at both Clark College and the Atlanta School of Social Work. At the time of the marriage, Cookie Hamilton served in the capacity of both professor and dean at LeMoyne‚ÄìOwen College in Memphis, Tennessee. The new Mrs. Hamilton joined the faculty at LeMoyne as a professor of psychology. In 1934, she became a statistic of the Great Depression when she was one of several employees laid off. Until 1941, she associated herself with the Memphis branch of the YWCA where she helped to establish the first Negro YWCA in the city. In 1935, she was hired to supervise a survey for the WPA on the black labor force in Shelby County. The result was published by the United States Government Printing Office in 1938 as The Urban Negro Worker in the United States, 1925‚Äì1936. In 1941, Cookie Hamilton accepted a position at Atlanta University, and the couple returned to their home city where Grace took advantage of her career downtime to enhance her education. Atlanta Urban League (1943‚Äì1960) An affiliate of the National Urban League, the Atlanta Urban League (AUL) had been established in 1919 by Jesse O. Thomas. When the organization's executive director William Y. Bell left for other opportunities in 1943, civil rights attorney A.T. Walden suggested his friend Hamilton be named to fill the position. She held this position until 1960, and under her guidance the organization's board of directors became integrated to include influential whites among the members. =Housing= Hamilton and AUL housing secretary Robert A. Thompson made housing the organization's top priority. The goal was better housing in black communities, preferably on newly purchased land. Hamilton wished to move families out of ghettos into improved conditions in better neighborhoods. In 1947, they organized the Temporary Coordinating Committee on Housing to scout out potential development areas for the black community. Hamilton and Thompson, sometimes accompanied by others, made repeated trips to Washington D.C. to convince the Federal Housing Administration to provide insured mortgages to the black community. In July 1950, the federally insured 452-unit High Point apartment rental complex opened as a result of the AUL's efforts. Successes also included the detached single-family home development of Fairhaven, as well as Carver Public Housing and Perry Homes. =Education= In 1944, Hamilton directed a study be conducted by experts to assess the condition of black education in Atlanta. The Citizens Committee on Public Education was organized in 1945 to disseminate the study to the Atlanta Board of Education in particular, and to the public in general. The education board responded slowly by opening four kindergartens for black children between 1945 and 1948. =Voter registration= In 1944, the United States Supreme Court ruled against the exclusive white primary in Texas in the Smith v. Allwright case. In 1946, the Supreme Court ruled in King v. Chapman that Georgia's white primary violated the rights guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Hamilton and Thompson organized a voter registration drive in 1946 that registered 24,137 new black voters in Atlanta. =Health care= In December 1947, Hamilton and the AUL issued A Report on Hospital Care of the Negro Population of Atlanta, Georgia. The report detailed the lack of black physicians in Atlanta, and the limited health care available to Atlanta's black community. Although indigent black patients had been treated in Atlanta, no facility administered care to members of the black community who were able to pay for their care. The AUL's recommendation was the designation of a city hospital specific to the training and administering of health care to meet the needs of Atlanta's black citizens. Highlighting the tragedy of insufficient care available to blacks was the 1931 death of Juliette Derricotte, Dean of Women at Fisk University, following an automobile crash near Dalton, Georgia. Denied emergency care in Georgia, she was transported to a hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where she died. The Citizens Committee for Negro Hospital Care that included Hamilton and R. Hughs Wood of Emory University School of Medicine, as well as Benjamin Mays and Rufus Early Clement, was charged with finding a remedy for medical care for paying black patients. Atlanta was under served by black physicians, who trained and served elsewhere. Most trained at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. The Committee wanted to make inroads specifically at the segregated institution of Emory. The Hill-Burton Act of 1946, otherwise known as the National Hospital Survey and Construction Act, provided federal funding for new construction of facilities, and for expansion of medical services. Amended in 1949, it included a provision allowing segregated facilities on a \\"separate but equal\\" basis. Towards this end, Hamilton added to the Committee local attorney Hughes Spalding, chairman of the Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority, which owned and operated Grady Memorial Hospital. Hamilton and Spalding proposed the separate but equal black facility, in spite of leaders in the black community pressing for full integration in society. Hamilton saw it as a beginning, but black leaders saw it as being out of touch with the reality of the times. The Hospital Authority donated the land for the hospital site, adjacent to Grady. Spalding won endorsements from county commissioners of Fulton and DeKalb, as well as the Fulton County Medical Society and area newspapers, which helped promote the concept. By 1949, $1.725 million in funds had been raised, with the remaining funding to come from the state and the Hospital Authority. Ground was broken on February 1, 1950. Named the Hughes Spalding Pavilion, it was dedicated May 29, 1952. Hamilton was named as secretary to the advisory board of trustees. In 1955, Hamilton and black members of Atlanta's legal and medical community organized Foundation for the Advancement of Medical and Nursing Education, with Hamilton as secretary. The foundation raised $10,000. No one applied for the money. Black interns could not serve at Grady. The United States Public Health Service provided $40,000 in surgery grants. By 1960, Hamilton had decided to move forward with her life and career, and tendered her resignation to AUL. It was not until 1962 that Asa G. Yancey, Sr. became the first African-American physician at Emory. Post urban league (1961‚Äì1966) She operated Hamilton and Associates consulting firm from 1961 through 1967. Her most notable client was Eli Ginzberg from Columbia University. He hired her to interview black college students in Atlanta as part of a study on career expectations of middle-class black youth. The report was published by Columbia University Press in 1967 under the title The Middle-Class Negro in the White Man's World. In 1964, Hamilton and Mrs. Edward M. Vinson founded the bi-racial Partners for Progress. Hamilton became vice-chair of the organization. The organization's mission was to help effect equal opportunity compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Affiliated with the National Women's Committee on Civil Rights, the organization worked through personal visitations, correspondence and telephone calls, monitoring and encouraging compliance with the law in all sectors of government, private enterprise and society. She also received multiple local, state and national appointments during these years. When Lyndon B. Johnson signed an executive order in 1966 to create the President's Council on Recreation and Natural Beauty, Hamilton was one of the council appointees. On July 8, 1964, armed police officers arrested and jailed Hamilton on an outstanding traffic court summons. When she appeared before court, she was fined $25. Georgia House of Representatives (1966‚Äì1984) Hamilton holds the distinction of being the first African-American woman elected to the Georgia General Assembly. In 1965, the General Assembly reapportioned the Georgia House of Representatives, adding twenty-one seats in Fulton County. A special election was held in 1965, and in 1966 Hamilton became one of eight African Americans elected to join Leroy Johnson, who had been serving in the lower house since 1963. The others were Horace T. Ward, Benjamin D. Brown, John Hood, Julian C. Daugherty, Albert W. Thompson, J. D. Grier Jr., William H. Alexander and Julian Bond. All but Bond were sworn in January 1966. The legislature refused to seat Bond because of his endorsement of the SNCC statement criticizing United States policy during the Vietnam War. Bond filed suit, and the Supreme Court agreed with Bond in December 1966, ordering the legislature to seat him. The office holders elected in the 1965 special election were required to run for office in the 1966 election. Hamilton was re-elected, defeating opponent Helen Howard. Hamilton's district bore three different numbers, due to redistricting. She was originally elected to District 137. In 1969, that area became District 112. In 1973, it was changed to District 31 and remained so for the rest of her government service. Hamilton began her legislative career on the committees for appropriations, education and health. One of her first bills was aimed at providing for the Georgia Highway Department to apply for federal matching funds to assist relocation of any resident displaced by new road construction. She also co- sponsored bill with Janet Merritt authorizing Georgia Arts Commission to extend its authority to encompass additional artistic genres. She was able to get legislation passed to revamp the electoral process in Fulton County by creating the County Board of Registration and Elections. In 1965, the Public Service Administration of Chicago recommended restructuring the Atlanta City Council. Based upon that recommendation, Hamilton introduced a bill to establish Atlanta Charter Commission. Her goal was to bring city representation into compliance with the 1965 Voting Rights Act and apportion the council seats relative to the demographics of the city. This would give blacks fair representation in the city government. Commission chair Emmet J. Bondurant and vice-chair Hamilton began work July 1, 1971. Governor Jimmy Carter signed the new charter into law on March 16, 1973. The new charter separated the city's legislative and executive branches, but shrunk the size of the City Council. Protests were raised by those with a vested interest in the number of city council seats, and a compromise was worked out. What eventually led to Hamilton being defeated for re-election in 1984, was a 1980 reapportionment battle against the Black Caucus, who wanted the reapportionment figured to their advantage. Hamilton felt so strongly they were wrong, that she ended up testifying before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in 1982. The Black Caucus were so angered by what they believed to be a betrayal by Hamilton, that they put Mable Thomas against her in the primary. Hamilton lost to Thomas in the run-off election and never held elected office again. Final years Following her election defeat, Hamilton served as advisor to the United States Civil Rights Commission (1985‚Äì87). She died on June 17, 1992, and was buried at South-View Cemetery in Atlanta.

The series premiered online on March 24, 2012 and on Nickelodeon on April 14, 2012, as a sequel to the original series, Avatar: The Last Airbender. The setting of the second series has changed dramatically from the first series. Most events take place in a city known as Republic City, which is a \\"steampunk\\" style city. Most notably, the access to electricity in the new series substantiates the passing of time between the two series. Plot Set 70 years after the events of the original series, a girl named Korra is born in the Southern Water Tribe and, as the reincarnation of Aang, is the next Avatar. Three members of the White Lotus respond to claims in the South Pole of a child as the Avatar. They meet Korra, already capable of bending Water, Earth, and Fire. Years later, a now seventeen-year-old Korra has conquered the art and skill of earthbending, firebending, and waterbending in the Fortress- meant to teach the Avatar the elements away from harm-, but has yet to learn airbending. Her waterbending master, Katara, who is now an old woman (with three grown children fathered by the deceased Avatar Aang), lets Korra go to Republic City after Katara's youngest son Tenzin is not able to teach Korra airbending. Korra travels with her Polar bear dog, Naga, to Republic City. Once there, Korra gets into a fight with a group of men who were going to rob an old man in the city. After being arrested for the damage she has done, she meets Chief Lin Beifong, the daughter of Toph from the original series who is unhappy at Korra's arrival seeing it as a danger to the city. However, Tenzin bails her out of jail and takes her home, preparing to send her back to the South Pole. However, he realizes that the Avatar is a vital part of the idea of Republic City, and allows her to stay and train in airbending. Meanwhile, Amon, leader of an anti-bender equalist group, learns of Korra's arrival, and tells his followers that he will have to accelerate his plans. Reception The Legend of Korra received positive critical reviews. The premiere averaged 4.5 million viewers ranking it as basic cable's number-one kids‚Äô show and top animated program for the week with total viewers. The Legend of Korra also ranks as the network's most-watched animated series premiere in three years.

Following the Brownsville Raid, on September 28, and a few skirmishes with the Texas Rangers, rebel leader Juan Cortina led his small army into the hills outside of town and dug in near a series of cattle ranches. The United States Army responded by sending an expedition into the area, under the command of Major Samuel P. Heintzelman, with orders to pacify all resistance. A minor battle began on December 13, at a ranch called La Ebonal, and continued for a few hours as the Americans routed and then pursued the retreating Cortinistas.Pierce, pg. 36Thompson, pg. 86-92 Background The First Cortina War began on September 28, 1859 when Juan Cortina led about seventy-five men into Brownsville to punish the town marshal for past grievances. After killing between four and six people, releasing the prisoners from the town jail, and taking whatever arms and ammunition, the Cortinistas fled northwest to Rancho del Carmen, which was owned by Cortina's mother and used as his base for operations north of the river border. On October 12, the sheriff of Cameron County, James Browne, led a posse to the ranch and succeeded in arresting the sixty-year-old Tomas Cabrera, who was not only a close friend of Cortina but one of his chief lieutenants that had participated in the Brownsville raid. When Cortina found out what had happened to his friend, he issued an ultimatum to the people of Brownsville, threatening that he would \\"lay the town in ashes\\" if Cabrera was not released and if his enemies did not surrender to him. The situation quickly escalated from there. The citizens of Brownsville began constructing defenses, including a barricade to block the main road through town. They also formed a twenty-man militia, called the \\"Brownsville Tigers,\\" which was sent to Rancho del Carmen and was hastily defeated by 300 rebels, who captured both of the Tigers' small artillery pieces. Cortina had his men build a forward base for his artillery outside of town and he formed a frontline close enough to Brownsville so that it could be seen by the Americans at the barricade. However, other than a shot from the cannon every morning at 6:00 am, there was no battle at the town itself. Over the next weeks, volunteers flocked to Cortina's camps from both sides of the border. Among his new recruits were some sixty Mexican criminals, who had broken out of the prison at Ciudad Victoria, and a band of Tampacaus native Americans from near Reynosa.United States Congress, pg. 63Pierce, pg. 36Baum, pg. 88-89Ivey, pg. 83 With Cortina's army growing stronger every day, the Americans sent for help and a force of Texas Rangers, under Captain William G. Tobin, was soon ordered to begin assembling in Brownsville. Cortina was well informed by his network of spies and sympathizers who lived in South Texas so he planned to ambush the rangers as they arrived in the area. On November 11, the morning after the arrival of the first rangers, Cortina was spotted coming down the road towards Brownsville, leading a body of an estimated 200 men. The American defenders quickly manned the barricades but Cortina decided not to attack and quietly withdrew back to base. The people of Brownsville panicked and, with the help of the rangers, an angry mob removed Cabrera from his cell and lynched him in Market Square. Cortina then hung three of his American prisoners before ambushing a small troop of rangers in the Palo Alto chaparral, near the Palo Alto Battlefield. In a fight that lasted less than one hour, three Americans were killed and four others were wounded. Their bodies were later found to have been \\"stripped and mutilated.\\" In retaliation, Captain Tobin rode to the village of Santa Rita and burned it to the ground without any resistance. Later he moved up the river to attack Rancho del Carmen but again Cortina was victorious and the rangers were driven back to Brownsville by a \\"galling fire of round shot, grape and canister.\\" Outgunned, about 100 Texas Rangers deserted and headed back north for home while those that remained waited for reinforcements.United States Congress, pg. 63Baum, pg. 89-91Thompson, pg. 88 At this point the United States Army became involved. On November 13, General David E. Twiggs ordered Major Samuel P. Heintzelman to lead an expedition of several hundred men to Brownsville. Though the major would be starting out from Old Camp Verde, in central Texas, many of the units placed under his command would be coming from distant states or territories, such as Kansas and Virginia. Because of this, Heinztelman issued orders for the majority of his men to rendezvous with him at Fort Merrill, on the Nueces River, and the remainder to assemble at Fort McIntosh, in Laredo, before beginning the final march to Brownsville. The major left Camp Verde on November 14 and arrived in Brownsville just before midnight on December 6, a journey of 332 miles. At that time, Heintzelman had with him two batteries from the 1st Artillery, under Lieutenants Douglas Ramsay and William Montrose Graham, Jr., a company from the 2nd Cavalry, under Captain George Stoneman, and two companies from the 8th Infantry, under Captains Arthur Tracy Lee and Charles Downer Jordan. Another battery of artillery, one company of cavalry, and a few more companies of infantry was still at Laredo. During all this time, Cortina's army grew to at least 400 men and a few artillery pieces but they were not well armed individually and had little or no military training. With information collected by Mayor Stephen Powers, District Judge Edmund J. Davis, and the filibuster Jos√© Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Carbajal in Matamoros, Heintzelman concluded that Cortina probably had no more than 300 to 350 men, only 100 of whom were mounted. The Texas Rangers insisted that the number was at least 600.Baum, pg. 89-91Thompson, pg. 86-90Ivey, pg. 83 Battle Immediately after arriving in Brownsville, Major Heintzelman reoccupied Fort Brown, rested his troops for a few days, and organized the rangers and the militia into one unit under his command. He also waited for some artillery pieces to arrive from the army stores in Brazos Santiago. On the morning of December 13, when he was ready, Heintzelman began marching 165 men west, up the Rio Grande road, to Rancho del Carmen. The weather was cold and slightly rainy. Two miles outside of town, the soldiers were joined by a force of 125 Texas Rangers. Heintzelman wanted to use the rangers for reconnaissance but they refused to move through the dense chaparral along the road in fear of being ambushed. As they approached Rancho del Carmen, the rangers again hesitated to continue further but Judge Davis, who accompanied the expedition, was able to convince some of them to keep moving. When the expedition reached Rancho del Carmen, they found that the \\"ten-foot thick mesquite (wood) parapets\\" had only recently been abandoned. The rangers then fanned out as they were supposed to by taking positions on the flanks in front of the column. After advancing down the river road two miles further, Heintzelman spotted one of Cortina's men waving a Mexican flag in the distance. Seconds later, the Cortinistas started the engagement by firing a \\"four pound ball\\" down the road from their positions at the nearby Rancho la Ebonal. Heintzelman had his artillery return the fire immediately but the American gunners were inexperienced, having never fired live ammunition before. At first, the American artillery went flying well over the Cortinista fortifications but after a spotter was deployed to the top of a mesquite tree the fire became more accurate. A gunnery duel continued for some time but casualties remained light on both sides. A piece of canister hit the pommel of Judge Davis' saddle and another piece wounded a man in the thigh. A third piece killed a mule before striking an ammunition wagon and setting it on fire.Thompson, pg. 90‚Äì91Ivey, pg. 83 After softening up the rebel positions, Heintzelman took the initiative by dismounting the rangers and sending them forward to attack one of the enemy's flanks while the infantry and cavalry attacked the other. In the meantime, the artillery would hold the road along the river, in the center of the battlefield. Neither of the movements made very much progress though. Not just because of incoming fire but because of how thick the prairie was. As the advance slowed, the Cortinistas launched an attack of their own, hoping to capture the American artillery. However, the Americans repulsed the attack with musketry and afterwards found eight dead rebels on the field. One Texas Ranger was killed during the engagement while two others were wounded. Two soldiers also received wounds. When the fighting ceased, Major Heintzelman ordered his men to regroup and rest for two hours before continuing further down the road. The rebels made another stand a short distance away from La Ebonal and yet another four miles up the road that leads to Edinburg and Rio Grande City, at the ranch of Jesus de Leon. During the latter engagement, both the rangers and the soldiers routed the Cortinistas, most of whom fled further up the river while others crossed over to Mexico. One more ranger was mortally wounded while a second was badly wounded in the shoulder due to an accidental discharge. Heintzelman reported that he counted eight more dead Mexicans as he rode up to the De Leon Ranch but overall casualties were difficult to determine because many of the rebels were literally \\"blown to pieces\\" by artillery fire. After another halt, the expedition continued on. At a fork in the road near Cortina's Rancho San Jose, fifteen miles from Brownsville, the Americans found a path leading through the chaparral where the rebels had dragged one of their cannons. The rain was starting to get heavier though so Heintzelmen decided to make camp for the night and follow the path on the next morning.Thompson, pg. 91‚Äì92 It was after 8:00 am by the time the march started again, mostly because the rangers took their time breaking camp. Not long after, the Americans heard the sound of Mexican bugles in the distance, sounding the retreat. Heintzelman ordered his men to make haste but no more Cortinistas were found. The major assumed correctly that he had successfully dispersed Cortina's army so he turned the column around and went back to Fort Brown, arriving later that evening. The Texas Rangers burned down several abandoned homes during the return march. According to Heintzelman; \\"The Texas Rangers were burning all - friends and foes.... We would undoubtedly have done better without the Rangers.\\" Heintzelman later found that Cortina himself was not in charge of the rebels during the battle. He had gone north with 200 of his men, to conduct an ambush, and left his lieutenant, Teodoro Zamora, in command. However, when he heard the sound of cannon fire, Cortina rushed to the scene but apparently arrived too late to engage.Thompson, pg. 92‚Äì93 Aftermath After arriving back in Brownsville and the fort, Heintzelman allowed his men to celebrate the victory with a barrel of beer that was captured during the skirmish at Rancho de Leon. On the next morning, Heintzelman was \\"besieged by visitors congratulating him on his success.\\" There were rumors, however, that Cortina was preparing to take up the offensive again by attacking Point Isabel and destroying the fleet of steamships there. Furthermore, the Texas Rangers were feuding over who they wanted to be led by. One half preferred Captain Tobin but the others preferred the recently arrived John Salmon Ford. Heintzelman preferred the latter, being that Salmon had discipline while Tobin let his men run wild. A war council later decided to send one company of rangers to Point Isabel, to protect the port, while the remaining rangers were sent north to scout Los Fresnos and Las Norias. Captain George Stoneman would also take a company of the 2nd Cavalry on a patrol up the Rio Grande. Meanwhile, Heintzelman was communicating with the Mexican authorities across the river in Matamoros. After speaking with the Mexican consul, Manuel Trevino, about Cortina and Mexican-American affairs in general, Heintzelman reviewed seven hundred Mexican Army troops before returning to Texas. At about the same time, a prominent local rancher, named Henry Clay Davis, entered Brownsville and told Heintzelman that Cortina was still retreating west, \\"burning and plundering as he went.\\" This was further substantiated by Captain Stoneman and the Texas Rangers, who reported the same thing. For this, Heintzelman began preparing for a second march up the river. Leaving on December 21, the expedition headed west and eventually encountered the Cortinistas on December 27 in the Battle of Rio Grande City, the decisive engagement of the war. During the fighting, the rebels were surprised and routed from the city. They lost much of their arms and equipment, as well as about sixty men. The First Cortina War ended soon after.Thompson, pg. 92-93 See also *Garza Revolution *Yaqui Uprising *Bandit War *Mexican Revolution Notes References  Category:19th-century military history of the United States Category:History of Mexico Category:History of Texas Category:American frontier Category:Texas Ranger Division Category:December 1859 events Category:1859 in Texas ","title":"Battle of La Ebonal"},{"id":"35501188","text":"Old-style shutters on a Shmuel HaNavi Street house. Shmuel HaNavi Street (, lit. Samuel the Prophet Street) is a main road in north-central Jerusalem. It starts at the intersection of St. George and Shivtei Israel Streets near Highway 60, and merges into Golda Meir Boulevard (Route 436) just past the intersection of Bar-Ilan and Hativat Harel Streets. The continuation of the street winds up to the tomb of Samuel the prophet, after whom the street is named. Shmuel HaNavi Street borders the Beit Yisrael, Bukharim, Arzei HaBira, Shmuel HaNavi, Sanhedria and Gush 80 neighborhoods. With a largely Haredi population, the street houses major synagogues for two Hasidic dynasties and many Haredi schools, yeshivas, and girls' seminaries. Name The street is named after Samuel the prophet (11th century BC), the last Biblical judge, who anointed both Saul (I Samuel 15:1) and David (I Samuel 16:12-13) as kings of Israel. The Tomb of Samuel, which rests atop the tallest mountain outside the Jerusalem city limits, can be reached by following the continuation of Shmuel HaNavi Street northward. History Area separating Jewish Jerusalem from Arab Jerusalem before the erection of the Mandelbaum Gate, May 1949. Before 1948, Shmuel HaNavi Street lay at the northern edge of Jewish Jerusalem, with the Arab neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah to the northeast. Its location beyond populated areas such as Mea Shearim and Beit Yisrael was the reason why Simcha Mandelbaum, a Jewish merchant who had raised his family in the Old City, decided to build a new home at the eastern end of the street in 1927.Rossoff (2001), p. 554. While Mandelbaum wished to set an example for other Jews to build in the area and expand the borders of Jerusalem, the Waqf, which owned large tracts all around, forbade Arabs from selling any more land to Jews, so the three-story house stood on its own.Bird (2010), pp. 20-21. During the riots of 1929 and 1936, the Haganah took up positions in the Mandelbaum House to drive back the rioting Arabs leaving Damascus Gate toward Mea Shearim and Beit Yisrael. Arab Legionnaires blew up the house during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.Regev, Chaya. \\"The Mandelbaum Gate: Home of the Mandelbaum Family\\". Yated Ne'eman (Israel-English edition), 5 November 2004, pp. 16-18. During the 1947 civil war, residents on Shmuel HaNavi Street were subject to frequent shooting from snipers in Sheikh Jarrah. When war broke out in 1948, the street was thrust onto the frontlines, becoming a strategic gateway for Arab Legionnaires seeking to enter Jewish Jerusalem. The Mandelbaum Gate in operation, 1955. A sundial marks the former site of the Mandelbaum Gate crossing. The 1949 Armistice Agreements put Shmuel HaNavi Street parallel to the Jordanian border, with a no man's land of barbed wire and minefields separating it from Ammunition Hill to the north. From 1949 to 1967 the official crossing point between Israeli- and Jordanian-held territory stood at the eastern end of Shmuel HaNavi Street at a checkpoint called the Mandelbaum Gate. This checkpoint was named after the destroyed Mandelbaum House, whose ruins lay nearby. Clergy, diplomats and United Nations personnel used the Israeli (2002), pp. 95-97. gateway to pass through the concrete and barbed wire barrier between the sectors, but Jordanian officials allowed only one-way passage for non-official traffic. Anyone with an Israeli stamp in his or her passport was denied passage.Bird (2010), p. 26. After the Six-Day War and the reunification of Jerusalem, the Israelis dismantled the Mandelbaum Gate. Today a sundial standing in the middle of the Jerusalem Light Rail tracks near the beginning of Shmuel HaNavi Street marks the site where the Gate once stood. =Shmuel HaNavi neighborhood= To reinforce its claim on the territory on its side of the 1949 armistice line, in the early 1960s the Jerusalem municipality erected a complex of \\"long train\\" tenement buildings built in the manner of fortresses. The Israel Housing Ministry mandated that the external concrete walls of the buildings be three times the normal thickness to withstand shelling. The roofs of the buildings had raised parapets fitted with gun slots. The buildings themselves were arranged in a \\"confusing zig-zag pattern\\" to slow down Arab armies that might charge the complex, and the courtyards between the buildings were designed to accommodate mass mobilization of Israeli troops in the event of an attack. The renovated facade of the Shmuel HaNavi apartment buildings. This housing project, known as Shikun Shmuel HaNavi (Shmuel HaNavi neighborhood), was largely populated by Sephardi Jewish immigrants from North Africa.Hasson (1993), p. 12. The overcrowded conditions and lack of infrastructure quickly turned it into a slum.Israeli (2002), p. 123. In the late 1970s an urban protest movement called Ohalim established a branch here, initiating cultural and productive activities for disadvantaged youth and elderly.Hasson (1993), p. 80. In the 1980s the neighborhood was significantly upgraded as part of Project Renewal, a national urban renewal program that upgraded housing, infrastructure and utilities in 84 Israeli neighborhoods between 1977 and 1984. A new facade was added to each building in the complex and apartments were enlarged or combined to create larger living quarters. As the first generation of immigrant children matured and left the neighborhood, their parents followed, and Haredi families from Mea Shearim, Bukharim and Geula took their place. In the 1990s the corner of Shmuel HaNavi and Bar-Ilan Streets was the site of frequent protests to close both streets to traffic on the Jewish Sabbath, a law that was eventually enforced. According to a 1997 appeal by the Ministry of Transportation to the Supreme Court of Israel on the closure, \\"almost 100% of the residents living in the vicinity of the Shmuel HaNavi and Jeremiah Streets, as far as Shamgar Street, are all religious or Ultra-Orthodox\\". =Shmuel HaNavi bus bombing= In 2004 a suicide bomber dressed as a Haredi Jew boarded a crowded #2 bus on its return route from the Western Wall and detonated himself as it turned the corner to Shmuel HaNavi Street. The bus was filled with Haredi families with small children; 23 were killed and more than 130 wounded. =2014 Jerusalem tractor attack= In 2014 an Arab workman took a tractor from a work site and went on a terror rampage, overturning a bus with the Arab driver inside, killing one person and wounding several.

Archeological discoveries Evidence for the presence of the Third Wall of the New City from the time of King Agrippa I has been found on Shmuel HaNavi Street. Reinforcing this connection, Simcha Mandelbaum found coins from the Bar Kokhba era on the site of his new house at the beginning of the street.Rossoff (2001), p. 555. The Talmud (Zevachin 107a) and the author of Kaftor VeFerach cite a location near or on the street as the site where the deshen (ashes) from sacrifices on the Temple Altar were deposited.Rossoff (2001), pp. 332. Roman tombs and ossuaries have also been found on Shmuel HaNavi Street. A few hundred meters north of the western end of the street lies the Second Temple-era Tombs of the Sanhedrin in a large park. In July 2009 archaeologists discovered an ancient quarry on Shmuel HaNavi Street, near the intersection with Yehezkel Street, during new residential construction. The quarter-acre (one-dunam) area was thought to be part of a larger network of quarries extending from Musrara to Sanhedria, from which the giant stones used by King Herod in the construction of the Second Temple (first century BC) were hewn.

The goal of the curators of The West as America was to reveal how artists during this period visually revised the conquest of the West in an effort to correspond with a prevailing national ideology that favored Western expansion. By mixing New West historiographical interpretation with Old West art, the curators sought not only to show how these frontier images have defined American ideas of the national past but also to dispel the traditional beliefs behind the images. Many who visited the exhibition missed the curators' point and instead became incensed with what they saw as the curators' dismantling of the history and legacy of the American frontier, which caused an unforeseen controversy that, according to art critics, \\"engaged the public in the debate over western revisionism on an unprecedented scale.\\" Controversial reviews generated widespread media coverage, both negative and positive, in leading newspapers, magazines, and art journals. Television crews from Austria, Italy, and the United States Information Agency vied to videotape the show before its 164 paintings, drawings, photographs, sculptures, and prints, along with the 55 text panels accompanying the artworks, were taken down. Republican members of the Senate Appropriations Committee were angered by what they termed the show's \\"political agenda\\" and threatened to cut funds to the Smithsonian Institution. National Portrait Gallery, G Street, NW, Washington, D.C. The paintings at the Smithsonian American Art Museum represent the United States government's oldest art collection; in its 160-year history, the museum had not received much detrimental publicity before this exhibition. Several key factors, including a prominent venue, skillful promotion, widespread publicity, an elaborate catalog, and the importance of the artworks themselves, all contributed to the impact of the exhibition. Timing also played a part in fostering public response both pro and con, as the show's run coincided with events such as the collapse of the Soviet Union, the allied victory in the Gulf War, the resurgence of multiculturalism, and the revival of public interest in western themes in fashion, advertising, music, literature, and film. Background The history of the United States' westward expansion is viewed by some as a vital component in interpreting the structure of American culture and the modern national identity. There are competing visions of the western past that assume different western significances; it was the newer versions of western history that were emphasized at the 1991 exhibition. NMAA director Elizabeth Broun stated, \\"The museum took a major step toward redefining western history, western art and national culture.\\" The conclusions set forth in The West as America were rooted in revisionist studies such as Henry Nash Smith's Virgin Land: The American West as Symbol and Myth, Richard Slotkin's Regeneration Through Violence: The Mythology of the American Frontier, 1600‚Äì1860 (1973), and William H. and William N. Goetzmann's book and 1986 PBS television series, The West of the Imagination. Layout The West as America included 164 works of visual art, including paintings, drawings, prints, engravings, photographs, sculptures, and others, created by 86 well- known artists of varying nationality during the period between 1820 and 1920. It was curated by William H. Truettner and a team of seven scholars of American art, including Nancy K. Anderson, Patricia Hills, Elizabeth Johns, Joni Louise Kinsey, Howard R. Lamar, Alex Nemerov, and Julie Schimmel. A text panel in the last section of the show reads: > The art of Frederic Remington, Charles Schreyvogel, Charles Russell, Henry > Farny, and other turn-of-the-century artists has been called a \\"permanent > record\\" of nineteenth century frontier America. Yet, as the accompanying > photographs of Schreyvogel attests, these artists often created their work > in circumstances vastly removed from frontier America itself. Artist Frederic Remington's painting Fight for the Water Hole (1903), which was displayed in the last section of the show's thematic exhibit, was accompanied by a wall text with a quote from the artist that read: > I sometimes feel that I am trying to do the impossible with my pictures in > not having a chance to work direct but as there are no people such as I > paint it's \\"studio\\" or nothing. Truettner's intention was not to criticize western art but to acknowledge the way the art of the West imaginatively invented its subjects. Truettner sought to demonstrate the deep ties between the art and the artists' participation in the American Art-Union during the antebellum period, and to show that many artists' works were influenced by patronage from capitalists and industrialists of the Gilded Age. Another wall text read: > Although they reveal isolated facts about the West, the paintings in this > section reveal far more about the urban, industrial culture in which they > were made and sold. For it was according to this culture's attitudes ‚Äì > attitudes about race, class, and history ‚Äì that artists such as Schreyvogel > and Remington created that place we know as the \\"Old West.\\"\\" The National Museum of American Art produced a 390-page book with more than 300 illustrations for the exhibit, which was edited by Truettner and included a foreword by the NMAA director, Elizabeth Broun. In addition, the NMAA produced a handbook entitled \\"A Guide for Teachers\\", intended for grades 10‚Äì12, to help students develop the ability to interpret works of art and to see how and why works of art create meaning. The handbook states, \\"‚Ä¶the exhibition at the NMAA argues that this art is not an objective account of history and that art is not necessarily history; seeing is not necessarily believing.\\" Both the curator and the director stated they presented an exhibition on American art that described how images have been misconstrued as truthful representations of history, \\"But,\\" director Broun stated, \\"the public changed the terms of the debate.\\" Truettner added, \\"We thought we were doing a show on images in history, but the public was more concerned that we had challenged a sacred premise.\\" In an effort to create a show that would effectively question past interpretations of familiar works by these artists, the curator divided the artworks into six thematic categories that were accompanied by 55 written text labels. The text labels commented on the artwork and introduced popular and/or dissenting material. Through the use of the 55 text labels, the exhibition curator explicitly asked the audience to \\"see through\\" the images to the historical conditions that produced them. This technique raised what critics called \\"uncomfortable questions about basic American myths and their relationship to art.\\" =\\"Prelude to Expansion: Repainting the Past\\"= Christopher Columbus on Santa Maria in 1492 (1855) by Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze The exhibition began with historical paintings that introduced the concept of national expansion and included representations of colonial and pre-colonial events such as white male Europeans encountering the unknown North American continent for the first time. One of the first text labels read: > The paintings in this gallery and those that follow should not be seen as a > record of time and place. More often than not they are contrived views, > meant to answer the hopes and desires of people facing a seemingly unlimited > and mostly unsettled portion of the nation. Embarkation of the Pilgrims at Delft Haven, Holland, July 22, 1620 (1844) by Robert Walter Weir Truettner writes \\"...images from Christopher Columbus to Kit Carson show the discovery and settlement of the West as a heroic undertaking. Many nineteenth-century artists and the public believed that these images represented a faithful account of civilization moving westward. A more recent approach argues that these images are carefully staged fiction and that their role was to justify the hardship and conflict of nation building. Western scenes extolled progress but rarely noted damaging social and environmental change.\\" Another text label read: > This exhibition assumes that all history is unconsciously edited by those > who make it. Looking beneath the surface of these images gives us a better > understanding of why national problems created during the era of western > expansion still affect us today. Works in this section included Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze's Christopher Columbus on Santa Maria in 1492 (1855), which shows Christopher Columbus gesturing toward the New World, and The Storming of Teocalli by Cortez and his Troops (1848); Peter F. Rothermel's Columbus before the Queen (1852) and Landing of the Pilgrims (1854); Thomas Moran's Ponce de Le√≥n in Florida, 1514 (1878); Joshua Shaw's The Coming of the White Man (1850); and Robert Walter Weir's Embarkation of the Pilgrims at Delft Haven, Holland, July 22, 1620 (1857). Colonial paintings included Weir's The Landing of Henry Hudson (1838) and Leutze's Founding of Maryland (1860). =\\"Picturing Progress in the Era of Western Expansion\\"= The second section of the exhibition focused on portraits of prominent settlers and images of scouts, pioneers, and European immigrants moving west across an unpopulated landscape. William S. Jewett's The Promised Land ‚Äì The Grayson Family (1850), portrays a prosperous-looking man with his wife and son, all gazing west, posed against a golden landscape. The text labels called it \\"more rhetorical than factual\\", an image that \\"ignores the controversy that attended national expansion by equating the westward trek of the Grayson Family with white people's belief in the idea of progress.\\" John Gast John Gast's American Progress (1872) depicts the ideal of \\"Manifest Destiny\\", a notion popular in the 1840s and 1850s which expounded that the United States was impelled by providence to expand its territory. Called the \\"Spirit of the Frontier\\", the scene was widely distributed as an engraving that portrayed settlers moving west, guided and protected by a goddess-like national personification known as Columbia, aided by technology (such as railways and telegraphs), and driving Native Americans and bison into obscurity. The painting shows the angel-like Columbia symbolically \\"enlightening\\" the darkened west as light from the eastern side of the painting follows her. Westward Ho! (1850) by James Henry Beard Emigrants Crossing the Plains (1867) by Albert Bierstadt Albert Bierstadt's Emigrants Crossing the Plains (1867) portrays a picturesque party of Germans traveling to Oregon. The canvas shows the warmth of the setting sun and spectacular hues streaking across the sky, which illuminate the sheer cliffs to the right. According to Truettner, paintings constructed this way brought to life for nineteenth-century viewers the western pioneer experience. Daniel Boone Escorting Settlers through the Cumberland Gap (1851‚Äì1852) by George Caleb Bingham Other images of western migration included George Caleb Bingham's Daniel Boone Escorting Settlers through the Cumberland Gap (1851‚Äì1852). Truettner describes Daniel Boone as the quintessential pioneer, whose energy and resourcefulness helped him to build a generous livelihood from a succession of wilderness homesteads. His image had become a national symbol exemplifying the spirit of adventure and accomplishment. But Boone's initial visit to Kentucky, Truettner explains, was prompted by real-estate speculation. He writes, \\"‚Ä¶in fact [these men] were no more than commercial vanguards. They were trespassers on foreign territory who began the process of separating Indians from their land. These images communicated that opportunities on the frontier awaited everyone and perpetuated the myth that the settling of the west was peaceful, when in reality it was bitterly contested every step of the way.\\" =\\"Inventing 'The Indian'\\"= The exhibition's third section used several rooms to group three different and conflicting stereotypes of Native Americans, which were thematically subtitled as the Noble Savage, the Threatening Savage, and the Vanishing Race. Young Omahaw, War Eagle, Little Missouri and Pawneess (1821) by Charles Bird King Combined sample portraits with revisionist text informed by Richard Slotkin's book Regeneration Through Violence: The Mythology of the American Frontier, 1600‚Äì1860 (1973) and Richard Drinnon's Facing West: The Metaphysics of Indian- Hating and Empire building (1980) generated so much antagonism that Truettner voluntarily revised about ten of the fifty-five labels in an effort to tone down the message and to please anthropologists. A Death Struggle (1845) by Charles Deas Truettner's original label read, \\"This predominance of negative and violent views was a manifestation of Indian hatred, a largely manufactured, calculated reversal of the basic facts of white encroachment and deceit.\\" Truettner eliminated this sentence from the revised text. Another label stated, \\"These images give visual expression to white attitudes toward Native peoples who were considered racially and culturally inferior.\\" The edited version of this label read, \\"These images give visual expression to white attitudes toward Native peoples.\\" Truettner explained in an oral interview with Andrew Gulliford that he made changes to the text because he \\"wanted to catch visitors, not alienate them\\" and because he believes \\"in communicating with the larger museum audience.\\" Charles Bird King painted noble images of Indians as seen in Young Omahaw, War Eagle, Little Missouri and Pawnees (1822). The accompanying text labels read: > Artistic representations of Indians developed simultaneously with white > interest in taking their land. At first, Indians were seen as possessing > nobility and innocence. This assessment gave way gradually to a far more > violent view that stressed hostile savagery‚Ä¶apparent in contrasting works‚Ä¶ Charles Deas' The Death Struggle (1845) depicts a white man and a Native American locked in mortal combat and tumbling over a cliff. The text labels read: > Indians were inevitably represented as hostile aggressors at the very moment > settlers and the army were invading their land. Such a patent change of > image tells us that white artists were presenting a stereotype rather than a > balanced view of Indian life. In T.H. Matteson's The Last of the Race (1847), Truettner writes, \\"Violent encounters were not the only means of \\"solving the Indian problem.\\"\\" Truettner adds that both Matteson's The Last of the Race and John Mix Stanley's Last of Their Race (1857) \\"suggested Indians would eventually be buried under the waves of the Pacific.\\" Sacramento Indian with Dogs (1857) by Charles Christian Nahl Another series of paintings represented acculturation themes that predicted Indians would be peacefully absorbed into white society, thereby neutralizing \\"aggressive\\" racial characteristics. Charles Nahl's Sacramento Indian with Dogs (1867) was among this group of paintings. Truettner concludes, \\"The myth in this case denies the Indian problem by solving it two ways: those who could not accept Anglo-Saxon standards of progress were doomed to extinction.\\" =\\"Settlement and Development: Claiming the West\\"= Stump Speaking (1853‚Äì1854) by George Caleb Bingham The fourth section included paintings that portrayed the successful lives of miners and settlers and depicted the give-and-take of American frontier democracy; also included were popular culture and advertising images. Works in this section included George Caleb Bingham's Stump Speaking (1853‚Äì1854) and Canvassing for a Vote (1851‚Äì52), John Mix Stanley's Oregon City on the Willamette River (1850‚Äì1852), Charles Nahl and Frederick August Wenderoth's Miners in the Sierras (1851‚Äì1852), Mrs. Jonas W. Brown's Mining in the Boise Basin in the Early Seventies (c. 1870‚Äì80), and George W. Hoag's Record Wheat Harvest (1876). Miners in the Sierras (1851‚Äì1852) by Frederick August Wenderoth Oregon City on the Willamette River (1850‚Äì52) by John Mix Stanley Truettner writes that these works \\".... support the myth that there was enough for everyone. Cities were models of organization and industry, exploitation of land and natural resources is featured with engaging naivet√©, and industrial pollution is offered as a picturesque accessory to the landscape. These paintings convert frontier life to a national idiom of prosperity and promise.\\" =\\"'The Kiss of Enterprise': The Western Landscape as Symbol and Resource\\"= The fifth section focused on a series of landscapes that represented, in succession, the Green River Bluffs of Wyoming, the Colorado River, the Grand Canyon, Donner Pass, and the Sequoia and Redwood trees of California, which portrayed the west as both Edenic wonders and emblems of national pride. Temporary and Permanent Bridges and Citadel Rock, Green River (1868) by Andrew J. Russell According to Truettner, the market for scenes of commerce and industry coexisted with a \\"taste for heroic landscape\\" and included photographs and paintings of the western landscape as both symbol and exploitable resource. The images of the vast west meant to serve as a promotion to inspire further migration. Photographs chronicle the building of railroads and depict black steam engines traveling through the Rocky Mountains. Works in this section included Oscar E. Berninghaus' A Showery Day, Grand Canyon (1915), Andrew Joseph Russell's Temporary and Permanent Bridges and Citadel Rock, Green River (1868), Thomas Moran's The Chasm of the Colorado (1873‚Äì1874), and Albert Bierstadt's Donner Lake from the Summit (1873), as well as commercial landscapes and advertising images by unidentified artists, entitled Splendid (1935) and Desert Bloom (1938). =\\"Doing the 'Old American': The Image of the American West, 1880‚Äì1920\\"= With the first five sections serving as metaphors of progress, the sixth and last section took the exhibit in a different direction and was deemed by many critics as the most controversial phase of the exhibition. For Supremacy (1895) by Charles Marion Russell Truettner explained that the ideology used to justify expansion had suddenly achieved permanent status, and without more frontier left to conquer, artists and their images were now called on to relay the ideology of the past to future generations. Truettner claims the images in this section \\"speak not to the actual events but to the memory of those events and its impact to future audiences.\\" Critics saw this as the curator's attempt to deny that the art of Frederic Remington, Charles Schreyvogel, Charles Russell, and Henry Farny had any basis in western realism and that their images were merely products of composite sketches based on photographs. Attempting to place these artists of western frontier images in an eastern urban context, the exhibit label states, \\"Although they reveal isolated facts about the West, the paintings in this section reveal far more about the urban, industrial culture in which they were made and sold.\\" Truettner writes in the show's catalog that when artist Charles Russell was asked in 1919 who purchased his paintings, the Montana artist explained that his paintings were purchased by \\"Pittsburghers most of all. They may not be so strong on art but they are real men and they like real life.\\" Other works included Russell's Caught in the Circle (1903) and For Supremacy (1895), Charles Schreyvogel's Defending the Stockade (c. 1905), and Henry Farny's The Captive (1885). Another painting entitled The Captive (1892), by Irving Couse, generated a lot of critical reviews. Roger B. Stein writes, \\"The much disputed critical reading of Irving Couse's The Captive (1892), an image of an old chief with his young white \\"victim,\\" raised explicit questions about the intersection of gender and race and the function of the gaze in constructing meaning in this troubled emotional and cultural territory in a way that shocked viewers because it had not been prepared for earlier.\\" Stein adds: > The curatorial experiment failed not because what the textblock said was > untrue (though it was partial, inadequate and rhetorically over-insistent) > but because the significant verbal comment on gender had been withheld until > the last room of the exhibit. Visually, The West As America was a > fascinating study of gender issues from the first Leutze images forward. One > may legitimately reply that gender was not the intellectual territory which > this exhibition staked out in its verbal script, but my argument here is > based upon the premise that a museum exhibition is ‚Äì or ought to be ‚Äì first > and last a visual experience (the book or catalog is another and different > mode of communication). The Captive (1892) by Irving Couse The label read: The label also went on to suggest that an open teepee flap implied sexual encounter and that arrow shafts become phallic objects. Reactions Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way [Westward Ho!] (1862) by Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze A writer for The Journal of American History, Andrew Gulliford, stated in a 1992 article (also titled \\"The West as America: Reinterpreting Images of the Frontier, 1820‚Äì1920\\") that \\"The West as America gave no praise or tribute to the grandeur and majesty of the western landscape or to the nation-building ethos of the pioneering experience. Instead, exhibition labels presented the truth of conquest and exploitation in US history, an approach that struck many visitors and reviewers as heretical.\\" Coming of the White Man (1850) by Joshua Shaw According to The Western Historical Quarterly writer B. Byron Price, the traditions and myths at the core of western art, in addition to the expense of exhibit installations and practical constraints such as time, space, format, patronage, and availability of collections, contribute to the resistance of museums to attempt shows of historical revision and why conventional monolithic views of the West as a romantic and triumphant adventure remain the mode in many art exhibits today. Roger B. Stein, in an article for The Public Historian entitled \\"Visualizing Conflict in 'The West As America'\\", took the view that the show effectively communicated its revisionist claims by insisting upon a non-literal way of reading images through its use of textblocks. He writes, \\"Visually the exhibition made its subject not just \\"images of the West,\\" but the process of seeing and the process of making images ‚Äì the images are social and aesthetic constructions, choices we make about a subject matter.\\" Other critics accused the NMAA curator of \\"redefining western artists as apologists for Manifest Destiny who were culturally blind to the displacement of indigenous people and ignored the environmental degradation that accompanied the settling of the West.\\" Previous exhibitions and programs that had focused on the history of the American West include \\"The American Frontier: Images & Myths\\" at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1973; \\"Frontier America: The Far West\\" at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston in 1975; \\"Treasures of the Old West\\" at the Thomas Gilcrease Institute in 1984; \\"American Frontier Life\\" at the Amon Carter Museum of Western Art in 1987; and \\"Frontier America\\" at the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in 1988. Revisionist themes appear more often in the story lines of high-profile temporary and traveling shows like The American Cowboy, organized by the Library of Congress in 1983, The Myth of the West, a 1990 show offering from the Henry Gallery of the University of Washington, and Discovered Lands, Invented Pasts, a cooperative effort of the Gilcrease Museum, the Yale University Art Gallery, and the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library in 1992. These shows did not generate the level of controversy seen at the NMAA's The West As America exhibit. According to art reviews, what set apart past shows on the west and The West as America was the show's \\"strident rhetoric\\". Andrew Gulliford writes, \\"Few Americans were prepared for the blunt and incisive exhibit labels, which sought to reshape the opinions of museum visitors and to jar them out of their traditional assumptions about western art as authentic.\\" According to B. Byron Price, \\"Several people appreciated the serious, critical attention accorded to artwork and found merit in the complexity of analysis and the curator's interpretation of western art.\\" =Political issues= The opening of The West as America coincided with the final phase of the Gulf War in 1991. According to reviewers in the media, for those who understood the war as a triumph of American values, the exhibition's critical stance toward western expansion seemed like a full-blown attack on the nation's founding principles. The language of the show, while not the curator's goal, \\"played into the hands of those who would equate cultural criticism with national betrayal.\\" In a book for comments by visitors, historian and former Librarian of Congress Daniel Boorstin wrote that the exhibition was \\"...a perverse, historically inaccurate, destructive exhibit‚Ä¶ and no credit to the Smithsonian.\\" Boorstin's comment prompted Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska and Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, two senior members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, to express outrage over the exhibit and to threaten to cut funding to the Smithsonian Institution. By appealing to patriotism, the Senators used funding of the Smithsonian as an opportunity to criticize the \\"dangers of liberalism.\\" Stevens argued that the institutional guardians of culture ‚Äì the federally funded Smithsonian and other related federally funded arts programs in general ‚Äì had become \\"enemies of freedom.\\" According to the Senators, the problem with The West As America as well as with other curatorial controversies produced by the Smithsonian and the National Endowment for the Arts such as the Mapplethorpe and Andre Serrano photographs, was that it \\"breeds division within our country.\\" Citing two other Smithsonian projects, a documentary about the Exxon Valdez oil spill and a television series about the founding of America that reportedly accused the United States of genocide against Native Americans, Stevens warned Robert McAdams, the head of the Smithsonian, that he was \\"in for a battle.\\" In a reference to the funding of the Smithsonian, which in part is regulated by the Senate Appropriations Committee, Stevens added, \\"I'm going to get other people to help me make you make sense.\\" To many in the national press and the museum community, the Senators' attack on the Smithsonian and the exhibition at the National Museum of American Art was one movement in a larger effort to transform culture into a \\"wedge issue\\". The term, often used interchangeably with \\"hot button issue\\", is used by politicians to exploit issues using highly contentious loaded language to divide the opposing voter base and to galvanize a large electorate around the issue. \\"Political correctness\\" became another expression used frequently in the debate. The use of words and phrases such as \\"race\\", \\"class\\", and \\"sexual stereotype\\" in the exhibit's text labels allowed critics of so-called \\"multicultural education\\" to condemn the show as \\"politically correct\\". In the minds of the critics, the exhibition served as proof that multicultural education had spread from the campuses to the Smithsonian. The Wall Street Journal, in an editorial entitled \\"Pilgrims and Other Imperialists\\", labeled the exhibition \\"an entirely hostile ideological assault on the nation's founding and history.\\" Syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer condemned the exhibition as \\"tendentious, dishonest, and finally, puerile\\" and called it \\"the most politically correct museum exhibit in American history.\\" In a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee on May 15, 1991, Stevens criticized the Smithsonian for demonstrating a \\"leftist slant\\" and accused The West As America of having a \\"political agenda\\", citing the exhibition's 55 text cards accompanying the artworks as a direct rejection of the traditional view of United States history as a triumphant, inevitable march westward. The head of the Smithsonian, Robert McAdams, responded to the attack by saying he welcomed an inquiry, which he hoped would allay concerns and added, \\"I don't think the Smithsonian has any business, or ever had any business, developing a political agenda.\\" Stevens called the show \\"perverted\\" but later conceded to Newsweek magazine he had not actually seen the exhibit on the West but had \\"merely been alerted by the comment posted by Daniel Boorstin in the museum's guestbook.\\" =Public commentary= There were more than 700 visitor comments recorded in the museum's guestbook in Washington, D.C., generating three large volumes of commentary. Viewers passed judgment on the works, the curator's competence, and the tone of the explanatory texts, previous comments in the comment book, and local reviews of the exhibition. Praise dominated the criticism ‚Äì 510 of the 735 comments were generally positive. One hundred and ninety-nine people signaled out the wall texts for praise, while 177 felt negatively about them.[\\"Showdown at \\"The West As America Exhibition.\\" American Art 5, no 3 (Summer 1991): 2‚Äì11 https://www.jstor.org/stable/3109055 (accessed March 5, 2012) Comments in the guestbook show that for many of the exhibition's younger supporters, asking questions about western images seemed not only correct but even the obvious thing to do. Those disagreeing with the text generally thought the images should be allowed to speak for themselves and felt that even without the text explanations the images would reveal a truthful account of westward expansion. The opposing group, some of whom still objected to the texts, agreed the images misrepresented history in that they cast the westward movement as too much of a heroic odyssey. One commentary typical of those disagreeing with the texts read: Another viewer offered: Those defending the exhibit wrote: Some viewers had mixed feelings: Some commented on others' comments: =Attendance and cancellations= The West as America was scheduled to run from March 15 ‚Äì July 7, 1991, but was extended an additional 13 days to accommodate a growing audience. Attendance to the National Museum of American Art increased by 60% over the same period in the previous year. While praise dominated the comments in the guestbook in Washington, D.C., show promoters were denied the opportunity to measure the variety and intensity of reaction in other parts of the country, notably in the Western United States itself, because of the cancellation of two proposed exhibit tours at the St. Louis Art Museum and the Denver Art Museum. The cancellations were not due to the controversy, but rather a result of the continuing recession and the $90,000 participation fee, which was only part of a total estimated cost of $150,000 per site. Legacy The debate surrounding The West as America raised questions about the U.S. government's involvement in and funding of the arts, and whether public museums were able or unable to express ideas that are critical of the United States without the risk of being censored by the government. The Smithsonian Institution receives funding from the United States government through the House and Senate Interior, Environmental and Related Agencies Appropriation subcommittees. The Smithsonian is approximately 65% federally funded. In addition, the Smithsonian generates revenue from trust funds and contributions from corporate, foundation, and individual sources, as well as from Smithsonian Enterprises, which include stores, restaurants, IMAX theaters, gifts, and catalogs. The West as America cost $500,000 and was covered with private money. At the time of the exhibition in 1991, the Smithsonian received about $300 million per year in federal funds. Federal funding to the Smithsonian has increased by 170.5% over the last 21 years, with funding for 2012 totaling $811.5 million. Total funding of arts-related federal programs in 2011 totaled just over $2.5 billion. The Smithsonian Institution continues to receive the biggest federal arts allocation, receiving $761 million in 2011. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting received $455 million in 2011 (of which about $90 million goes to radio stations). With the total federal budget for fiscal year 2011 being $3.82 trillion, federal arts funding in that year accounted for approximately 0.066% (sixty-six one-thousandths of one percent) of the total federal budget. The Smithsonian's federal appropriation for 2012 of $811.5 million represents an increase of $52 million above its 2011 appropriation. The requested budget for fiscal year 2013 is $857 million, a $45.5 million increase over 2012 funding. With a fiscal year 2013 total federal budget of $3.803 trillion, Smithsonian funding represents 0.00023% (twenty-three hundred-thousandths of one percent) of the total 2013 federal budget.

The trail begins at junction on Death Canyon Trail near the Death Canyon Barn and climbs steeply to Static Peak Divide. From the divide the trail soon splits, with a western branch descending into Alaska Basin and the eastern trail (also known as the Alaska Basin Shelf Trail) continuing north to junction with the Teton Crest Trail. This trail is considered very strenuous. *Amphitheater Lake Trail ascends from Lupine Meadows to Amphitheater Lake. The trail is considered strenuous with of total elevation gain in just over . *Berry Creek Trail is long and located in the far northern region of the park. The trail begins at the National Park Service patrol cabin north of Wilcox Point on Jackson Lake and extends to Jackass Pass at the border between the park and Caribou-Targhee National Forest. Located in the remote northern backcountry of Grand Teton National Park, the trail is not connected to maintained trails in the southern part of the park and must be accessed from the Glade Creek trailhead in the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. The trails in this region may require dangerous stream crossings. *Bradley Lake Trail is a moderate trail which connects the Taggart Lake trailhead to Bradley Lake. *Cascade Canyon Trail extends from Jenny Lake to the north and south forks of Cascade Canyon. The trail is long ( round trip) and is considered moderate to strenuous. To get to Cascade Canyon there is about a mile hike up the mountain that is strenuous. A boat shuttle across Jenny Lake at the beginning and end of the hike shaves off the round trip. This is one of the most popular trails in the park and provides the only access to the popular Hidden Falls cascade. *Colter Bay Lakeshore Trail is an easy round-trip nature trail forming two interconnected loops along Jackson Lake and Colter Bay. *Death Canyon Trail is long and begins at the White Grass Ranger Station Historic District and ends at Fox Creek Pass where it intercepts the Teton Crest Trail.

Footbridge across String Lake *Garnet Canyon Trail begins at Lupine Meadows and ascends into Garnet Canyon. The trail becomes unmaintained after however from that point many climbers continue to the Lower Saddle between Middle and Grand Teton, from which most climbs to the summits of either peak is commenced. *Granite Canyon Trail is long and begins at the Granite Canyon trailhead on the Moose-Wilson Road, about north of Teton Village and ends at the junction with the Teton Crest Trail near Marion Lake. The trail follows the length of Granite Canyon. Some hikers will use the aerial tram located at the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort and hike mostly downhill along the Rendezvous Mountain Trail and then the Granite Canyon Trail back to the resort, a total distance of . *Hermitage Point Trail is commenced from Colter Bay Village and involves a moderate hike of round trip to Hermitage Point on Jackson Lake. *Heron Pond Swan Lake Trail is started from Colter Bay Village and is an easy nature hike to Heron Pond and Swan Lake. *Jenny Lake Trail is a trail which circles Jenny Lake. This easy trail begins at the Jenny Lake campground or can be accessed at several other trailheads. *Lake Solitude Trail extends from the forks of Cascade Canyon north to Lake Solitude and to Paintbrush Divide where it intercepts the PaintBrush Divide Trail. One of the most popular trails in the park and part of the loop hike which commences and terminates at the String Lake Trailhead. *Leigh Lake Trail extends from the Leigh Lake Trailhead to Trapper Lake. *Middle Fork Cut Off Trail is long and connects the Rendezvous Mountain Trail with the Teton Crest Trail. *Open Canyon Trail is long and runs from the Valley Trail over Mount Hunt Divide and then descends into Granite Canyon. The trail traverses the entire length of Open Canyon. Paintbrush Divide Trail and the steep uphill climb to the divide *Owl Creek Trail is long and located in the far northern region of the park. The trail begins at a junction on the Berry Creek Trail and traverses west then south to Moose Basin Divide where it meets the Webb Canyon Trail. Access to this trail is from the Glade Creek trailhead in the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. The trails in this region may require dangerous stream crossings. *Paintbrush Canyon Trail is commenced from the String Lake Trailhead and climbs over to Paintbrush Divide. There it intercepts the North Fork Cascade Canyon Trail. *Rendezvous Mountain Trail is long.

From the forks, the distance is to Hurricane Pass. A short connection trail leads to Schoolroom Glacier just before the top of the pass. *String Lake Trail is a popular and easy round-trip trail which circles String Lake. The Paintbrush Canyon Trailhead also offers a non-motorized boat launch. Taking a short trip north with a 400M portage walk allows you to access Leigh Lake via a non-motorized boat. *Taggart Lake Trail is an easy round-trip hike which provides access to Taggart Lake. The trail begins at the Taggert Lake Trailhead, located roughly 2.3 miles north of the Moose Entrance Station. The trail also allows you to connect to Bradley Lake.

The Senufo inhabit the savannas and tropical rain forests of northern C√¥te d'Ivoire and the nearby land in Mali and Burkina Faso. The Sandogo is responsible for sustaining positive relationships with the spirit world through divination and for protecting the purity of each kinship group. The word Sandobele originates from the Senufo language. The Sandobele constitute only a small portion of the members of the Sandogo society. Membership in the Sandogo society is almost exclusively hereditary as only one female from each matrilineal group is initiated into the Sandogo society. All new Sandogo initiates learn the process of divination called tyeli (or tyele), but only a small number are able to perfect the complicated method and become practicing diviners. Diviners have great responsibility and are highly respected within the community because of their skills. The Sando (singular of Sandobele) divination process constitutes one of the most important and common rituals in Senufo culture. Leaders of the community must confer with a Sando diviner before making significant choices or performing sacred ceremonies that affect the community because the action must be communicated to the spirits. People in the village consult the diviner on an everyday basis to discover what spirits or other forces are causing them grief. Often villagers feel pressure to have regular sessions with the diviners to avoid neighbors and relatives claiming that misfortunes are caused by the villager not following the diviner's directions or not speaking with enough diviners. The Sandobele hold the authority to communicate with the spirit world which helps maintain a sense of balance with the male leaders of the society. Initiation While the most common route to becoming a Sando is to be initiated through the society, other diviners are said to be ‚Äúpursued‚Äù by a specific spirit. The person will fall ill due to a severe indiscretion committed against the spirit, and must then agree to work with that spirit as a diviner to become well again. In most areas, this must happen for a male to be allowed to practice divination; he will not be initiated into the Sandogo society although he is taught the divination process.Veirman, Anja. ‚ÄúArt and Conflict Management: Bush Spirits as Mediators and Source of Inspiration in the Art of the Senufo.‚Äù The Object as Mediator: On the Transcendental Meaning of Art in Traditional Cultures, edited by Mireille Holsbeke, Antwerp: Ethnographic Museum, 1996.p. 145 Conflict The underlying theme in Senufo daily activities and ritual practices is based on the conflict between the village and the bush. The village represents culture that is well-regulated and related to order and control, while the bush remains unpredictable, haphazard, and full of wild animals and mysterious creatures. The bush begins somewhere past the tobacco fields on the village edge, yet the boundary is always in flux, coming closer at night when bush spirits can cross the threshold of the village. The Senufo do not believe that they are automatically entitled to be able manipulate the land; they must first make gifts and sacrifices to the bush spirits to obtain the authorization to disturb their realm. Ancestors, diviners and other mediators are able to communicate with these spirits who dwell in the bush called madebele (or tugubele). The madebele are the most accessible spirits because of their proximity and relationship with humans.Veirman, Anja. ‚ÄúArt and Conflict Management: Bush Spirits as Mediators and Source of Inspiration in the Art of the Senufo.‚Äù The Object as Mediator: On the Transcendental Meaning of Art in Traditional Cultures, edited by Mireille Holsbeke, Antwerp: Ethnographic Museum, 1996. p. 147-148 Madebele: the bush spirits These spirits residing in the bush are constantly involved in human activities because they are able to move among the village at night and villagers sometimes must travel through the bush. The madebele remain dominant over their particular domains including sources of water such as springs, rivers and creeks as well as rocks and mountains. The bush spirits resemble small humans, but with feet pointing backwards, a disproportionately large head, stunted legs, big feet and oversized genitalia. They resemble humans in that they have male and female forms who marry, have children, form initiation societies, appear in pairs and live in similar groupings. They are invisible and speak a language unintelligible to humans. Their invisibility makes them easy to agitate because women need to obtain water, men must hunt wild animals and farmers must clear fields to plant crops. Like humans the madebele enjoy music and dancing and other beautiful objects such as sculpture and ornament. These spirits once held a place similar to humans in the world but were displaced to the bush.Veirman, Anja. ‚ÄúArt and Conflict Management: Bush Spirits as Mediators and Source of Inspiration in the Art of the Senufo.‚Äù The Object as Mediator: On the Transcendental Meaning of Art in Traditional Cultures, edited by Mireille Holsbeke, Antwerp: Ethnographic Museum, 1996. p. 148 =Origin myth= The creator god Kolocolo created madebele and animals as the first residents of the earth; they enjoyed a peaceful existence and spoke the same language. At some point the madebele decided that they should be equal to Kolocolo and allowed to create new worlds, which made the creator god extremely angry. After this offense, the madebele were forced to remain on earth after their death, unseen by the new inhabitants created to rule over them as well as the animals. These new creatures were humans who looked very similar to the madebele except that their feet pointed forward. Humans appropriated the farming methods, social structures and initiation rites of the madebele. According to the Senufo historian Quattara, the humans proceeded to push the madebele and the animals into the bush which is why a hostile relationship exists between them. The bush spirits and animals are constantly struggling with mankind for supremacy. Once they enlisted the aid of sorcerers to give humans disease, war and misery, but humans called on the creator god for help and gained protection. The madebele can be very wily and often mislead humans, but they also gave them secret languages and initiation groups. Now the madebele will sometimes help humans, perhaps because they fear the creator god intervening. In this way people are able to negotiate with the bush spirits to influence their behavior.Veirman, Anja. ‚ÄúArt and Conflict Management: Bush Spirits as Mediators and Source of Inspiration in the Art of the Senufo.‚Äù The Object as Mediator: On the Transcendental Meaning of Art in Traditional Cultures, edited by Mireille Holsbeke, Antwerp: Ethnographic Museum, 1996. p. 149 =As messengers= The madebele constitute the most important spiritual messengers because they are more accessible than the other deities. Unlike some as such as deebele, or evil spirits, the madebele are impartial; they are not inherently positive or negative and they can be persuaded to aid humans.Glaze, Anita J. Art and Death in a Senufo Village. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1981. p. 62 These creatures can be exceedingly rash and become incensed quickly by humans, upon whom they can bestow hardship, sickness or even fatality. This situation, known as yawige, is feared dreadfully by the Senufo and requires the diviner to resolve the problem. Offerings must be made to the madebele with whom people come into contact or they will suffer retribution by the drying up wells and fires, among other disasters. Because madebele prefer to be around trees, offerings for them are often placed at the foot of trees. Anita Glaze's research maintains that bush spirits actually possess the means to give fecundity, vigor, riches, and authority to those who please them. On the other hand, Till F√∂rster insists that madebele can only act as mediators between humans and other more powerful spirits who can bestow these gifts. Either way these creatures play a crucial role in the habitual routines of villagers and also in divination practices.Veirman, Anja. ‚ÄúArt and Conflict Management: Bush Spirits as Mediators and Source of Inspiration in the Art of the Senufo.‚Äù The Object as Mediator: On the Transcendental Meaning of Art in Traditional Cultures, edited by Mireille Holsbeke, Antwerp: Ethnographic Museum, 1996. p. 148-150 Fo bracelet The Sandobele are easily identified by the assortment of Fo bracelets they wear. These signify them as diviners and further appease the python deity. The python represents the most important motif in divination practices and the Fo bracelet is the first object purchased by a new Sando. The three designs on the bracelet relate to the basic life forces which in turn may illustrate that \\"Sando divination is the only route to health, vitality and life.‚Äù Fo is the principal conveyor of messages from the spirit world, and is thus a symbol for Sando divination as the mediator between humans and deities.Glaze, Anita J. Art and Death in a Senufo Village. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1981. p. 76-78 Known as the ‚Äúmulticolored‚Äù one of ‚Äúconvertible elements‚Äù the python is the one who is able to answer the diviner's inquiries through the madebele.Veirman, Anja. ‚ÄúArt and Conflict Management: Bush Spirits as Mediators and Source of Inspiration in the Art of the Senufo.‚Äù The Object as Mediator: On the Transcendental Meaning of Art in Traditional Cultures, edited by Mireille Holsbeke, Antwerp: Ethnographic Museum, 1996. p. 150 The diviner therefore must try to please him by wearing a beautifully crafted rendition of him on her person and on display in her chamber. =Mythology= An ancient story relates that once Fo changed himself into an attractive young man and was almost successful in misleading a young woman into a false marriage; an older woman, an elder, rescued her and the honor of the matrilineage was safeguarded. Through this tale, Fo is associated with sexual imagery, male and female relations, and the defensive function of the Sandogo.Glaze, Anita J. Art and Death in a Senufo Village. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1981. p. 78 =Styles= The Fo bracelet takes several forms of which some are more finely decorated or have extra additions with the same basic structure. The bracelets are curved tubular forms that make an open cuff that are often divided into three sections. The most common includes a stylized representation of a python visible across all three sections of the form. This consists of two round circles representing eyes in the first section, a cylindrical bar on the second and a braided or smooth cord which wraps along the length of the bracelet. The tubular bar represents either the lungs or the male sex organ, while the braided cord represents arteries that lead to the heart that may or may not be represented on all bracelets.Glaze, Anita J. ‚ÄúSenufo Ornamentation and Decorative Arts.‚Äù African Arts 12, no. 3 (November 1978) p. 66 Other geometric patterns may also run along the entire piece. Sometimes a simple wavy line flows along the length of the bracelet similar to the way a snake appears as it slithers, instead of specific features. The objects are cast using brass alloy in the lost wax process and are therefore unique not reproducible. They are relatively small as they are either solid, thin tubes made to fit the wrist, somewhat larger props used as signifiers of power, or smaller replicas used as divination objects. Tyeli divination process When a member of the village becomes aware of a specific problem or event in her life she will decide to consult one of the diviners to determine the origin of her discord by Sando divinationVeirman, Anja. ‚ÄúArt and Conflict Management: Bush Spirits as Mediators and Source of Inspiration in the Art of the Senufo.‚Äù The Object as Mediator: On the Transcendental Meaning of Art in Traditional Cultures, edited by Mireille Holsbeke, Antwerp: Ethnographic Museum, 1996. p. 152 She will go to the small chamber called the sandokpanagi in which the Sando conducts her business on certain days of the week.Glaze, Anita J. Art and Death in a Senufo Village. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1981. p. 64 Various python motifs in bas-relief decorate the exterior of the house used only for this purpose. Upon entering the chamber the she will be inundated with a wide array of aesthetically pleasing objects including paintings of Fo on the walls, carved wooden sculptures, cast brass objects and substances from nature. The Sando diviner sits on the floor with her legs out and the client sits down facing her with her right leg next to the left leg of the diviner, thus forming a close mental and physical bond. The diviner wears many different python bracelets along with other pieces of jewelry. She holds a rattle made from a calabash, string and a white cowrie shell. Between her legs sits a pair of male and female sculptural figures, while a pile of various objects sits near her. =Calling the spirits= Now the client waits for the session to begin with a plea to the madebele. ‚ÄúAnswer to the invocation, you well-doers! When someone comes to you, do all to help him. The client has not come for me, but for you. I do not know what lies heavy on his heart. Say what problem oppresses him and show What offering he must make to rid him of this.‚ÄùVeirman, Anja. ‚ÄúArt and Conflict Management: Bush Spirits as Mediators and Source of Inspiration in the Art of the Senufo.‚Äù The Object as Mediator: On the Transcendental Meaning of Art in Traditional Cultures, edited by Mireille Holsbeke, Antwerp: Ethnographic Museum, 1996. p. 146 The whole divination chamber is designed to help call the bush spirits to the Sando; the invocation and music constitute the catalyst to call them forth. The spirits hear the music in the bush and feel compelled to come to the chamber to hear it as well as praise. The music makes them friendly and cooperative so the Sando can communicate with them as they possess the sculptures in front of her.Veirman, Anja. ‚ÄúArt and Conflict Management: Bush Spirits as Mediators and Source of Inspiration in the Art of the Senufo.‚Äù The Object as Mediator: On the Transcendental Meaning of Art in Traditional Cultures, edited by Mireille Holsbeke, Antwerp: Ethnographic Museum, 1996. p. 154 =Establishing the problem= The diviner sets the objects for this process between her legs and gathers a haphazard group in the cup of her hands and sometimes one of the client's hands as well. The objects consist of small-scale brass jewelry (including a miniature python bracelet), miniature iron sculptures, cowrie shells, dried kola nuts, and other miscellaneous organic materials. The Sando mediator shakes the grouping of objects and tosses them before the figures between her legs.Veirman, Anja. ‚ÄúArt and Conflict Management: Bush Spirits as Mediators and Source of Inspiration in the Art of the Senufo.‚Äù The Object as Mediator: On the Transcendental Meaning of Art in Traditional Cultures, edited by Mireille Holsbeke, Antwerp: Ethnographic Museum, 1996. p. 154 and Glaze, Anita J. Art and Death in a Senufo Village. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1981. p. 64 The relationship of how the objects land determines the message conveyed by the spirits; for example, when a cowrie shell with a smaller cowrie shell set inside it falls inside a python bracelet, it relates to pregnancy.Glaze, Anita J. Art and Death in a Senufo Village. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1981. p. 64, 66 Once the general category of the problem is determined, the spirits can be further questioned. The diviner must continue to try to narrow down the specific conflict that is distressing the client. While taking the client's right hand in hers she will inquire about the situation aloud to the bush spirits who have taken residence within the figures. The Sando moves her hands in response to the spirits‚Äô replies to her questions. Her hand will make a short horizontal gesture similar to pushing something aside to indicate ‚Äúno‚Äù or a searching movement to indicate uncertainty. When the answer is ‚Äúyes‚Äù, she slaps her upper thigh with her hand or the client's hand once or several times depending on how definite the response. No single answer is ever definite; the resolution comes from continually asking questions and getting related responses. During this time the patron listens silently until the Sando is able to determine the reason for her visit, to ensure that the spirits are cooperating. If she is able to determine the client's conflict, she will continue to use this method to access more information pertaining to the problem and its cause. If she fails, the client may ask to end the consultation. Once the source of discord is discovered, the diviner asks the spirits to explain what the client must do to correct the situation. The spirits guide the Sando's hand to one or more of the objects in the divination set that designates the course the client should follow. Depending on the situation this process may be very complicated and involve a series of questions before a conclusion can be reached. The client will now need to heed the advice of the Sando to resolve her problem. Yawige One of the most common solutions to a client's difficulties involves having a specific type of ornamentation made for her to wear. These ornaments also called yawige (also yawiige, yawigii) are ‚Äúanything worn as a protective, magical device prescribed for a client by a Sando‚Äù including cast- brass jewelry, painted textile clothing and masquerade costumes.Glaze, Anita J. Art and Death in a Senufo Village. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1981. p. 63 The woman would need to go to the person in her village or the neighboring village who works as a brasscaster and solicit him to create the object stipulated by the diviner, such as a v√∂r√∂g√∂ anklet worn only by women who have a special relationship with water spirits. The brass worker will cast the object and the client will wear this along with any other objects created to appease the spirits and resolve the issue.Veirman, Anja. ‚ÄúArt and Conflict Management: Bush Spirits as Mediators and Source of Inspiration in the Art of the Senufo.‚Äù The Object as Mediator: On the Transcendental Meaning of Art in Traditional Cultures, edited by Mireille Holsbeke, Antwerp: Ethnographic Museum, 1996. p. 155 These objects are accumulated by the client and contribute to remembering the personal conflicts as well as a means of protection and ornamentation. Some of these objects are similar to those which the Sando keeps on her person or in her chamber. Divination kit Although the objects utilized in tyeli divination can vary to some degree they always include a miniature python bracelet and other standard pieces. These objects can be divided into four major categories based on what they represent. The first group consists of different types of miniature forged-iron implements that are essential to the village's survival, including a farming hoe, a shovel for burials, a blade and an assortment of blacksmithing tools. The Fo bracelet falls into the second classification of objects which involves tiny representations of equipment related to the Sando divination process. For example, miniature Sandobele gourd rattles, twin cult baskets, stylized figurative forged-iron pairs and other items created in basketry, brass, iron, or wood are part of this grouping. Objects in the third group consist of nonrepresentational symbols typically constructed in fiber, metal and wood. A short iron bar bent on one end is interpreted as signifier of death and makes up part of this category. The fourth classification contains many organic materials that have a specific connotation such as large, shiny red and purple seeds and marked shells. All of these objects are essential to the tyeli process and make up part of the diviner's basic kit.Glaze, Anita J. Art and Death in a Senufo Village. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1981. p. 64-66 Not all Sandobele use the same objects, but rather try to make their own kit unique to the spirits with whom they communicate. Diviners who are just beginning and those with few clients often only have the bare essentials, but successful diviners may acquire many objects as well as decorations for their chamber. As they gain clientele, Sandobele are able to designate permanent meanings to a fixed number of new objects they obtain. On occasion the Sandobele may tell their client that the madebele insists that the client purchase a specific, ‚Äúshiny‚Äù brass object before they can speak with him of his problems.Glaze, Anita J. Art and Death in a Senufo Village. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1981. p. 66 These new more personal objects derive from communications with the helping madebele associated with that specific diviner. In addition, diviners add other unimportant objects to the kit in order to obscure the actual set from the client and confuse them. The Sandobele will add anything that draws their eye to the kit because of the item's color, texture or form. Using merely aesthetic objects in conjunction with the actual set, the diviners try to thwart the clients in any attempt to understand the tyeli method. The meaning of the objects comes from the position in which they fall and how this correlates with the other objects around them. Only the Sandobele are skilled in the art of reading the meaning of the connections between the objects. Currently diviners incorporate things such as ball point pens, bolts, nail polish and medicine flasks into their divination kits as objects of importance and visual worth. The divination sets are constantly reconfigured due to the plastic nature of the craft of tyele divination. Madebele: sculptures The pair of carved wooden figures represents another essential component of the Sando divination process. A practicing diviner must have two or more of these figures called madebele like the spirits they represent, although the Senufo make a definite distinction between the two. These sculptures‚Äô appearance must be similar to that of the individual spirits because they are used to attract the spirits to the diviner's chamber for consultation.Glaze, Anita J. Art and Death in a Senufo Village. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1981. p. 67, 69 Also, once the unseen spirits have been lured to the place, they reside inside the figures and ‚Äúspeak‚Äù to the diviner through the divination objects during the ritual. As with the other objects within the chamber, they are meant to be aesthetically pleasing to the spirits as well as functional. More successful diviners may have many sets of figures including more exquisitely carved figures that better relate to their particular madebele. The scale of the objects is similar to the divination objects reflecting an intimate relationship between the diviner and client.LaGamma, Alisa, and John Pemberton III. Art and Oracle: African Art and Rituals of Divination.

(from Rory Gallagher's collection, exhibited at Harrods in 2007)  History  = Early history = One of the earliest guitar manufacturers in Japan, Guyatone began production in 1933. (also PDF version is available) According to Mr. Hiroyuki Noguchi, editor of Japan's Guitar Magazine, \\"Matsuki Seisakujo\\" () was founded cabinet maker's apprentice Mr. Mitsuo Matsuki and friend Mr. Atsuo Kaneko, who later became a famous player of Hawaiian and Spanish style guitars as well as help with the formation of the great Teisco in 1946., (Note: \\"Atswo Kaneko\\" referred to in this section seems to be another notation of \\"Atsuo Kaneko\\") Matsuki had been enrolled in electronics classes, studying nights after his cabinetry apprentice job. Hawaiian music becoming increasingly popular at the time led Mr. Kaneko to inquire to his friend Matsuki about building an electric Hawaiian guitar using his wood working and electronics skills. In the late 1930s the \\"Matsuki Joiner\\" company (\\"Matsuki Seisakujo\\" in Japanese) was formed producing and selling mostly American style (Rickenbacker style) guitars under the Guya name. In 1940 Matsuki was drafted into the war between China and Japan and production halted for several years. After returning home, Matsuki formed his own company, \\"Matsuki Denki Onkyo Kenkyujo\\" (), translated means: \\"Matsuki Electric Sound Laboratory.\\" = Guyatone name = In 1951 Matsuki began to use the Guyatone name on his instruments. They also began to make amplifiers and cartridges for record players. These cartridges found a large market after being routinely used by NHK, a government-owned broadcasting station. In 1952 (or 1956) the name of the corporation was again changed to Tokyo Sound Company (). Eventually it was changed Guya Co., Ltd. ( and then back to Tokyo Sound Co. once again. According to correspondence with Toshihiko Torri, R&D; at Guyatone, the Tokyo Sound factory began large-scale production in 1956. Guyatone's own records indicate them as being founded on July 16, 1956. By the late 1950s or early 1960s, they made up to 1,500 slide guitars, 1,600 electric guitars and basses, 2,000 guitar amplifiers, and 5,000 microphones a month. During the late-1950s to 1960s, Guyatone guitars were distributed under various brands by other manufacturers/distributors: * In Japan, Hoshino Gakki had exported Guyatone under the Star and Ibanez brands, Guyatone made Star model 1570, 1580, 1590, EG-1800, EG-1810 (late 1950s), Guyatone made Ibanez model 1850 (c.1961), and Hoshino's Tama factory made Burn influenced model 2103, 3904, ... before Tama factory was opened in 1962. Their model 1830 (c.1960, LG-70) or model 1860 \\"Rhythm Maker\\" (1960) is said to be a model for which Jimi Hendrix had traded in his Danelectro, in 1962. Then, this model was roughly copied by Kawai as model \\"S-180\\" (1964), and some lots were also manufactured by FujiGen. [In English: In the same period, Mr. Yokouchi [co-founder of FujiGen] contacted the Nanyo Boeki [NBK Corporation], a musical instrument export trading company in Japan, for promoting his prototype products. Then, they indicated him a Kawai electric guitar and said that \\"Please manufacture as same as this\\", and the business had proceeded (the brand was Tele-Star [by Gar-Zim]). Also we can see that FujiGen's OEM manufacturing based on Teisco models was a similar case. [Generally, ] FujiGen's OEM manufacturing based on the other domestic manufacturer models were not initiated by the direct transaction between manufacturers, but by the proposal of trading company.] Kawai's copied model was played by Hound Dog Taylor, as seen on his first album Hound Dog Taylor and the HouseRockers in 1971. And in the 21st century, Ibanez reissued the Rhythm Maker as Jet King 2 (2004‚Äì2007). * In the United Kingdom, James T. Coppock (Leeds) Ltd. had introduced Guyatone under Antoria brand in the late 1950s, and these were played by Hank Marvin, Marty Wilde, Rory Gallagher, Johny Guitar, and Ringo Starr from the Hurricanes, and even possibly young Jeff Beck. * In the United States, Buegeleisen and Jacobson (B&J;) in New York City had introduced Guyatone under the \\"Kent\\" brand, along with re-badged brands such as Saturn, Marathon, Starlight, Royalist, etc. (Note that Kent guitars, established in 1960, were initially manufactured by Hagstr√∂m, then also manufactured by Guyatone, Kawai, FujiGen, Teisco, Matsumoku) Gallery of Kent branded guitars manufactured by Guyatone, along with FujiGen, Matsumoku, Teisco, and Kawai. = Demise and rebirth = In 2013 \\"Tokyo Sound Co. Ltd.\\" closed their doors to business and transferred ownership of the \\"Guyatone\\" name to Hiroshi Matsuki (), son of the founder of Tokyo Sound Co., and brother to the president of the company, re-opening and re-organizing a short time later that same year. Guyatone now continues in its US office in Oswego, IL, USA with partner company DeMont MFG LLC, where the new Guyatone WR6 pedal & Excelsior 5 guitar are produced. Later, DeMont MFG LLC was purchased and absorbed into \\"DeMont Guitars\\" along with all assets. The Guyatone company is now owned by former R&D; Guyatone engineer, Toshihiko Torii (DeMont Japan), and Nate DeMont (DeMont Guitars / Guyatone) Latest products In 2017 the WR6 AutoWah was launched as an all USA-Made pedal, limited to 100 units. The DeMont / Guyatone Manufacturing facility sustained a fire in December 2017 resulting in a slow release of the product. 2018 also introduced a limited run of 10 hand-made, USA Guyatone Zoom Box re-issue pedals. In 2020, designer Toshihiko Torii finished and released the Guyatone CBu1 (Cooler Booster) and ODu1 (Principal Overdrive) were released in limited numbers and to great accolades in the Japanese market. The new micro case was designed similarly to the M2 series case, although this time made from cast aluminum. Likewise, in Japan, Guyatone began development of a patented injection-molded guitar pick which uses small differences in contours and thickness, as well as material types, to change the feel of the pick instead of the traditional thickness of the plastic. Vintage Documentation In late 2018, Guyatone launched the GuyatoneGuitars.com site to document and collect information about vintage products and instruments as an on-going project, but has since been re-vamping all of the catalogs to be re-released online in the near future (2021)  References  ;Bibliography  *  External links  * Official website * Japan-DeMont-Guitars ‚Äì partner in Japan * ‚Äì major domestic models in the 1950s‚Äì1960s.

Austin: University of Texas Press, The march there \\"brought to light many acts of vandalism. Houses had been robbed and fired, fences burned, property destroyed or carried into Mexico.

Cortina had committed these outrages upon citizens of the United States...\\".Ford, J.S., 1963, Rip Ford's Texas. Austin: University of Texas Press, On 26 December, Cortina was camped in the main street of Rio Grande City.Ford, J.S., 1963, Rip Ford's Texas. Austin: University of Texas Press,  Battle  Major Ford's Texas Rangers were to turn the left flank of Cortina (on a little hill overlooking the town) while Major Heintzelman approached with his artillery at dawn on the 27th. Cortina's right flank was on the Rio Grande. At daylight, Major Ford drove in Cortina's picket, forced back a reconnoitering party, fired into Ringgold Barracks, forced it back, gained the crest of the hill and found the town empty. Cortina's artillery was on the Roma road and under a heavy fog, but Lt. Fry's detachment silenced it. Cortina's cavalry charged but Ford's troops left \\"Cortina's bold riders...on the ground.\\" The Mexicans started to retreat at which time Heintzleman's troops arrived and helped Ford pursue the Mexicans to the river, killing many, and forcing them to abandon their guns.  Aftermath  Cortina's forces retreated into Mexico near Guerrero and Mier. Major Heintzelman moved up the Rio Grande to Roma while Ford marched to Brownsville forming a new company of eighty-three Texas Rangers. On 2 February 1860, Ford and his Texas Rangers were placed under the command of Major Heintzelman and was responsible for clearing \\"the country of robbing bands\\" and defending the steamer Ranchero's passage from Rio Grande City to Brownsville from Cortina. On 4 February, Ford and forty-eight Rangers crossed into Mexico, confronted Cortina's forces around La Bolsa and forced them to flee. Ford stayed on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande until 6 February when he received assurances the Ranchero would not be attacked. The Ranchero reached Brownsville safely on 8 February. Lt. Col. Robert E. Lee relieved Major Heintzelman and the Mexican authorities offered to restrain \\"their citizens from making predatory descents upon the territory and people of Texas...this was the last active operation of the Cortina War\\".

The moniker alluded to Ivan IV, also known as Ivan the Terrible, the infamous Tsar of Russia. \\"Ivan the Terrible\\" gained international recognition following the 1986 John Demjanjuk case. Already in 1944 a cruel guard named \\"Ivan\\", sharing the distinct duties and the extremely violent behavior with a guard named \\"Nicholas\\", is mentioned in survivor literature (Rok w Treblince by Jankiel Wiernik, translated into English as A Year in Treblinka in 1945). John Demjanjuk was first accused of being Ivan the Terrible at the Treblinka concentration camp. He was found guilty of war crimes and was sentenced to death by hanging. This decision was later overruled by the Supreme Court of Israel. In 2011 Demjanjuk was convicted of war crimes for having served at Sobibor extermination camp. Background Treblinka was managed by 20 to 25 SS overseers (Germans) and 80 to 120 Hiwi guards of various Soviet ethnicities, including Russian and Ukrainian Red army prisoners of war. They were assisted by a cadre of Jewish inmates known as Kapos, who were prisoner functionaries. The name Ivan was not an uncommon name in the camp. Ivan is a common Ukrainian,Unsolved History: Investigating Mysteries of the Past by Joe Nickell, The University Press of Kentucky, 2005, (page 38) Russian and Belarusian given name. Volksdeutsche were known to have Slavic given names.Hitler's Last Courier by Armin D. Lehmann, Xlibris, 2001, An example would be Ivan Klatt, or a Volksdeutscher who served in the Sobibor extermination camp, as the Ukrainian guard leader.Holocaust Education & Archive Research Team. Aktion Reinhard Trawniki Staff Page. According to Rajchman six men called Ivan worked at Treblinka. The vast majority of Hiwi guards who were trained at the Trawniki concentration camp facility had to contend with the language barrier. However, there were a number of Volksdeutsche among them,Gregory Procknow, Recruiting and Training Genocidal Soldiers, Francis & Bernard Publishing, 2011, (page 35). Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: The Operation Reinhard Death Camps by Yitzhak Arad, Indiana University Press, 1987, (page 21) valued because they spoke German, Ukrainian, Russian and other languages. They could also understand basic Yiddish. The German and Austrian SS command, local Poles, and Jewish inmates often referred to guards as Ukrainians not only because of their ethnicity, or because they originated from Ukraine,Mirchuk, Petro. My meetings and discussions in Israel. A MEETING WITH THE 'DVAZHDI GEROY' (TWICE-OVER HERO) OF ISRAEL. but because they spoke Ukrainian between themselves. Most of the squad commanders however were Volksdeutsche.Gregory Procknow, Recruiting and Training Genocidal Soldiers, Francis & Bernard Publishing, 2011, (page 35) Duties Although there were more guards known as Ivan at Treblinka, Ivan the Terrible was also referred to as Ukrainian.Bill Ong Hing, Defining America: Through Immigration Policy, Temple University Press, 2003, (page 223) His function at the camp was to operate the two tank engines that fed the gas chambers. The motors had been installed and fine-tuned by SS-Scharf√ºhrer Erich Fuchs. Holocaust survivor Chil Rajchman testified that Ivan was about 25 years old at the time he worked in the camp. He was also known for his extreme cruelty. Ivan the Terrible used to cut off the ears of workers as they walked by, and these people were forced to continue working as they bled. Shortly after, he would proceed to killing them outright. He tortured victims with pipes, a sword, and whips before they entered the gas chambers. Identity The true identity of the guard referred to as Ivan the Terrible has not been conclusively determined. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, John Demjanjuk, a retired suburban Cleveland autoworker of Ukrainian descent, was accused of being Ivan. He was tried in Israel in 1988 and sentenced to death but the conviction was overturned.In memory of John Demjanjuk, Kyiv Post (March 21, 2012) One remarkable event during the trial in Israel involved a star witness for the prosecution, Eliyahu Rosenberg. Asked by the prosecution if he recognised Demjanjuk, Rosenberg asked Demjanjuk to remove his glasses \\"so I can see his eyes.\\" Rosenberg approached and peered closely at Demjanjuk's face. When Demjanjuk smiled and offered his hand, Rosenberg recoiled and shouted, \\"Grozny!\\" meaning, \\"terrible\\" in Russian. \\"Ivan,\\" Rosenberg said. \\"I say it unhesitatingly, without the slightest shadow of a doubt. It is Ivan from Treblinka, from the gas chambers, the man I am looking at now.\\" \\"I saw his eyes, I saw those murderous eyes,\\" Rosenberg told the court, glaring at Demjanjuk. Rosenberg then exclaimed directly to Demjanjuk: \\"How dare you put out your hand, murderer that you are!\\" It was later revealed that Eliyahu Rosenberg had previously testified in a 1947 deposition that \\"Ivan the Terrible\\" had been killed during a prisoner uprising.Pyle, Christopher H. (2001). Extradition, Politics, and Human Rights. Temple University Press. ; Chapter 19. Ivan Who? Getting the Wrong Man On July 29, 1993, the Israeli Supreme Court overturned the guilty verdict on appeal. The ruling was based on new evidence, the written statements of 37 former guards at Treblinka (some of whom had been executed by the Soviet Union, others died of old age, and could therefore not be cross-examined) that identified Ivan the Terrible as another man named Ivan Marchenko (possibly Marshenko, or Marczenko).Nickel, Joe (2010). Unsolved History: Investigating Mysteries of the Past. University of Kentucky Press.

Shelayev and Marchenko were transferred from Treblinka to Trieste in July 1943 where Marchenko guarded German warehouses and a local prison. In 1944, as Allied forces approached, Marchenko and a driver named Gregory \\"fled in an armored car to the partisans in Yugoslavia.\\" Shelayev last saw Marchenko in the spring of 1945, in Fiume, where he saw him coming out of a brothel.

Some of the exculpatory evidence that led to Demjanjuk's release in 1993 had come to light years before and was deliberately withheld from the Israelis by the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) of the US Department of Justice, which had urged Israel to charge him with being Ivan the Terrible.Raab, Scott. \\"John Demjanjuk: The Last Nazi.\\" Article in Esquire Magazine dated August 11, 2010. Gilbert S.

Even then they knew without a doubt that Demjanjuk was not Ivan the Terrible, but they hid the information from us. I am sorry that I did not have the information at the time. If I did, we would never have ruled in favor of his extradition to Israel.\\" Merritt claimed that what happened in his courtroom was \\"nothing short of a witch hunt. In retrospect, it reminds me of the witch trials in Salem, Massachusetts 300 years ago. The prosecution, counseled by the OSI, presented documents and witnesses whose testimony was based on emotions and hysteria, but not hard evidence. To my regret, we believed them. This instance is a prime example of how justice can be distorted.\\"Melman, Yossi.

During the trial, the problem of identity again became a key issue. Demjanjuk claimed he was not the Ivan Demjanjuk alleged to be a guard at Sobibor, and that the Trawniki identification card supplied by the OSI to Germany, and on which the prosecution based its case, was a Soviet KGB forgery.The Local. \\"Demjanjuk's SS identity card was forged, his lawyer says.\\" News article dated April 13, 2012. On May 12, 2011, Demjanjuk was convicted pending appeal by a German criminal court of being a guard at Sobibor extermination camp. Demjanjuk's appeal had not yet been heard by the German Appellate Court when he died in March 2012. As a consequence, the German Munich District Court declared him \\"presumed innocent.\\" The court also confirmed that Demjanjuk's previous interim conviction was invalidated, and that Demjanjuk was cleared of any criminal record.Convicted Nazi criminal Demjanjuk deemed innocent in Germany over technicality, at HAARETZ.com, retrieved March 23, 2012, viz. statement by Munich state court spokeswoman Margarete Noetzel. Ivan Marchenko is not on the Most Wanted Nazis list. Marchenko, if he is still alive and were to be caught, would be 109 years old as of 2020, and therefore unlikely to be brought to trial.

He is known for his cartoon designs of urban African-Americans on Miles Davis album covers. Work for Miles Davis Information on McCoy's life before meeting Miles Davis is scarce. He was working as an artist when he met Davis. The two became close friends, and Davis and McCoy shared an apartment in New York City on West 77th Street. McCoy created the cover art for Davis' albums On the Corner (1972), In Concert: Live at Philharmonic Hall (1973), Big Fun (1974), and Water Babies (1976). The artwork for the cover of On the Corner was produced at Davis' instigation. He was concerned that his music was not reaching an African-American audience, and wanted McCoy to create something that they would relate to. The reaction from Columbia Records when they saw the result was not positive. Davis insisted on using McCoy's cover art. Davis recalled in his typical blunt interview style: According to Davis, McCoy was reluctant at first, but Davis was enthusiastic about the art that McCoy produced: McCoy's cover art for On the Corner depicts a group of cartoon characters, a scene of \\"ghettodelic\\" street life among the younger generation of African Americans. The post-1960s, funk-style fashions are similar to the spirit of the blaxploitation film images of the same era. In Concert: Live at Philharmonic Hall included illustrations inside the album by McCoy satirizing mainstream rock and roll music, with a cartoon music label \\"Slickophonics\\" and a long-haired white band with the name \\"Foot Fooler\\" on the front of the drum kit. In a 1974 review of the album, music magazine Coda characterized McCoy's illustrations for this album, and On the Corner, as \\"tastelessness\\". Davis tried commissioning two different European cartoonists to create cover art for his album Rubberband during the 1980s. He was dissatisfied with the results, and the album was ultimately never released. In 2007, Columbia released the 6-CD box set The Complete On the Corner Sessions that included new illustrations by Corky McCoy. Other illustration works McCoy created the cover art for the album Fresh Mode, released by hip-hop group Ugly Duckling, in 1999, as well as both singles released in promotion of the LP. McCoy created illustrations for comedian Tim Meadows's 2000 book The Ladies Man: Sexin' and Lovin' Leon Phelps Style, co-written with Andrew Steele and Dennis McNicholas. The book was released in connection with the Tim Meadows comedy film The Ladies Man that featured a character with the same 1970s street-funk aesthetic associated with McCoy's album covers for Davis.

Originally published as a serial in the newspaper Sinar Hindia, it was republished in book form in 1919 by Masman & Stroink. Written while Kartodikromo was in prison, Student Hidjo tells the story of Hidjo, a Javanese student sent to the Netherlands to study but eventually falls for a Dutchwoman. An intersecting plotline, which unfolds parallel to the main story, follows Dutch administrator Willem Walter in his romantic life. Written in Malay, the novel was one of several by Javanese authors which helped popularise the word \\"saya\\" as a first-person personal pronoun. Described by Kartodikromo as an extended simile, Student Hidjo has been noted as depicting a new Indonesian youth culture which has adopted Western cultural and lingual facets. Traditional Javanese and Dutch cultural values are contrasted; from this contrast, Kartodikromo advocates a view that the two are incompatible. This includes love, which is described in the novel as something only those with a Dutch education would attempt to find; the traditional view being that marriage is to be used for social mobility. Background Student Hidjo was written by Marco Kartodikromo, a journalist from Blora who began his career in Bandung and was strongly opposed to the policies of the Dutch East Indies government. For several years he worked as an editor at the Surakarta-based newspaper Doenia Bergerak; the city later served as the novel's setting. He spent five months in the Netherlands, from late 1916 to early 1917; upon his return, he was arrested by the Dutch governmental authorities for \\"sowing hatred\\" and sentenced to a year in prison in Weltevreden, Batavia (now Sawah Besar, Jakarta). It was while in prison that Kartodikromo wrote Student Hidjo. In the early 20th century, the introduction of Western technology and culture was leading to the fragmentation of the traditional Javanese lifestyle. Meanwhile, the Dutch Ethical Policy, which guaranteed certain rights and freedoms ‚Äì such as the right to education and some press freedoms ‚Äì was leading to social unrest. The tighter controls put on the press after 1906 led to Student Hidjo being published with the text \\"not to be quoted\\" (\\"\\") on the cover. Plot Hidjo is a young man from Surakarta, Central Java, who is engaged to Biroe, in accordance with his father's wishes. His father, a merchant named Raden Potronojo, orders Hidjo to go to the Netherlands and attend university; this is hoped to give the family greater status, as generally only priyayi (noble) families send their children abroad for schooling. Meanwhile, Dutch administrator Willem Walter, who views the Javanese positively, is engaged to a Dutch woman named Jet Roos; Roos is pregnant with his child. In the Netherlands, Hidjo stays with a local family and enjoys the beauty of the Netherlands. The family's daughter, Betje, finds him intriguing because of his ethnicity. Although Hidjo initially receives her coldly, the two later become romantically and sexually involved. In Surakarta, Walter becomes attracted to Biroe and breaks off his engagement with Roos, who in turn aborts their child. This, and Biroe's rejection, leads him to return to the Netherlands, where he and Hidjo meet. Hidjo, who has become increasingly distracted from his studies by his relationship with Betje, is recalled to the Indies by his family. He ends his relationship with the Dutchwoman, paying her his savings to make amends for doing so. When Hidjo returns to Surakarta, he marries Woengoe ‚Äì who originates from a higher-class family than Biroe. Two years later, Hidjo has become district attorney of Djarak. Meanwhile, Walter has married Betje and returned to Surakarta to become assistant resident. Biroe marries Woengoe's brother Wardojo, who has become regent of the area. Roos marries the area's administrator, Boeren. Style Student Hidjo was written in Malay. When the novel was written, and indeed for numerous years afterwards, the Dutch colonial government was attempting to standardise Malay; the standardised form has been described by Hendrik Maier, a lecturer at Leiden University, as stilted. However, Kartodikromo did not attempt to follow these standards. According to Meier, unlike writers who used standardised Malay such as Armijn Pane and Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah in a \\"sad\\" manner, the language in Student Hidjo showed only \\"the enjoyment, the excitement, the thrill\\" of the writer, who \\"bubbled with anger\\". Tsuyoshi Kato, a Japanese scholar of Indonesian literature, notes that Kartodikromo, like other Javanese authors, preferred to use the term \\"saya\\" when writing in the first-person, as opposed to Minangkabau writers who preferred \\"hamba\\". He writes that \\"saya\\" was preferred over a Javanese word due to first person pronouns having highly different levels of politeness in that language. He writes that through works such as Student Hidjo and Rasa Merdika (A Sense of Freedom; 1924; by Soemantri), Javanese writers popularised the term; he describes \\"saya\\" as more active than \\"hamba\\" but more \\"contemplative and self-reflective\\" than the Javanese ngoko (crude) pronoun \\"aku\\". Themes Maier writes that the names of the main characters imply Student Hidjo should be read allegorically, with the names Hidjo (green), Woengoe (violet), and Biroe (blue) showing an interconnection between the characters. Kartodikromo described it as an extended simile. The novel depicts a younger generation of Indonesians () as being \\"those who understand Dutch\\". Maier writes that this understanding is not limited to the language used, but also actions; this includes holding hands in public and drinking lemonade, activities which traditional Indonesian society does not involve. Student Hidjo also contrasts Dutch and Javanese peoples. Maier finds that, through its alternating events, the novel shows that the Dutch and Javanese are incompatible; Maeir sums it up as \\"Javanese do not feel at ease in Holland, [and] Dutch do not feel at ease in Java.\\" According to Maier, the novel views the gap between the two cultures as \\"unbridgeable\\". Maier writes that the novel includes themes of love, with Hidjo's love for Woengoe, Betje, and Biroe paralleling that of Walter's love for Roos, Woengoe, and Betje. He also notes that there is a theme of social mobility, where Hidjo's relationships with noble women are fostered by his merchant father to grant the family a greater social position; bride prices also feature prominently, showing that one can become a noble through marriage if one has enough money. He notes that, towards the end of the novel, love is described as something only those with a Dutch education would attempt to find, as the social-financial meaning of marriage remains predominant among the traditional Javanese. The characters, despite not all marrying for love, are happy with their eventual partners and have a comfortable life. Release and reception Student Hidjo was first published in 1918 as a serial in the Semarang-based daily Sinar Hindia, which Kartodikromo edited. The story was then collected in a book format and published by Masman & Stroink, a Semarang- based company, in 1919. When it was published, politically themed works were limited to smaller publishers. Works published by Balai Pustaka, the state- owned publisher of the Dutch East Indies, tended to be apolitical. Kato writes that the novel is \\"unremarkable in terms of radical activism\\", but unrivaled in its imagination when compared to Sitti Nurbaya (1922; Marah Rusli), Salah Asuhan (Wrong Upbringing; 1927; Abdoel Moeis), and Rasa Merdika.

Quis ut Deus is inscribed on his shield. Archangel Michael may be depicted in Christian art alone or with other angels such as Gabriel or saints. Some depictions with Gabriel date back to the 8th century, e.g. the stone casket at Notre Dame de Mortain church in France. He is very often present in scenes of the Last Judgement, but few other specific scenes, so most images including him are devotional rather than narrative. The angel who rescues Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego from the \\"fiery furnace\\" in the Book of is usually regarded in Christian tradition as Michael; this is sometimes represented in Early Christian art and Eastern Orthodox icons, but rarely in later art of the Western church. In most depictions Michael is represented as an angelic warrior, fully armed with helmet, sword, and shield, in the style of a Byzantine officer, which is typically found even in Western depictions, though some late-medieval ones have him in contemporary knightly armour. Like other angels, in late-medieval Western art he may have what are known as feather tights, with large feathers over most of his body, as on the Holy Thorn Reliquary. He may be standing over a serpent, a dragon, or the defeated figure of Satan, whom he sometimes pierces with a lance. The iconography of Michael slaying a serpent goes back to the early 4th century, when Emperor Constantine defeated Licinius at the Battle of Adrianople in 324 AD, not far from the Michaelion, a church dedicated to Archangel Michael.Saint Michael the Archangel in medieval English legend by Richard Freeman Johnson 2005 pages 33-34 Constantine felt that Licinius was an agent of Satan, and associated him with the serpent described in the Book of Revelation (12:9).Constantine and the Christian empire by Charles Matson Odahl 2004 page 315 After the victory, Constantine commissioned a depiction of himself and his sons slaying Licinius represented as a serpent - a symbolism borrowed from the Christian teachings on the Archangel to whom he attributed the victory. A similar painting, this time with the Archangel Michael himself slaying a serpent then became a major art piece at the Michaelion and eventually lead to the standard iconography of Archangel Michael as a warrior saint. In other depictions Michael may be holding a pair of scales in which he weighs the souls of the departed and may hold the book of Life (as in the Book of Revelation), to show that he takes part in the judgment. However this form of depiction is less common than the slaying of the dragon.Saint Michael the Archangel in medieval English legend by Richard Freeman Johnson 2005 pages 141-147 Michelangelo depicted this scene on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel. The shield may bears the Latin inscription Quis ut Deus.Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices page 520 In Byzantine art Michael was often shown wearing the formal court robes and loros that were worn by the Emperor and his bodyguard on special occasions, rather than as a normal warrior who battled Satan or with scales for weighing souls on the Day of Judgement.Saints in art by Rosa Giorgi, Stefano Zuffi 2003 pages 274-276 The widely reproduced image of Our Mother of Perpetual Help, an icon of the Cretan school, depicts Michael on the left carrying the lance and sponge of the crucifixion of Jesus, with Gabriel on the right side of Mary and Jesus.Icons and saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church by Alfredo Tradigo 2006 page 188 In Eastern Orthodox depictions, there are three icons of the Archangel Michael in whose composition he is said to have personally intervened: Archangel Michael of Mantamados in Mytilene, Archangel Michael of Panormitis and Archangel Michael of Nenita.

Rowling, see Inferi (Harry Potter). The di inferi or dii inferi (Latin, \\"the gods below\\")Varro, De lingua latina 6.13. were a shadowy collective of ancient Roman deities associated with death and the underworld.Entry on \\"Death,\\" in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 366. The epithet inferi is also given to the mysterious Manes,Tacitus, Annales 13.14: inferos Silanorum manes. a collective of ancestral spirits. The most likely origin of the word Manes is from manus or manis (more often in Latin as its antonym immanis), meaning \\"good\\" or \\"kindly,\\" which was a euphemistic way to speak of the inferi so as to avert their potential to harm or cause fear.Robert Schilling, \\"The Manes,\\" Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 133. Sacrifices Varro (1st century BC)Varro, Divine Antiquities, book 5, frg. 65. distinguishes among the di superi (\\"gods above\\"), whose sites for offerings are called altaria; the di terrestres (\\"terrestrial gods\\"), whose altars are arae; and di inferi, to whom offerings are made by means of foci, \\"hearths,\\" on the ground or in a pit. In general, animal sacrifice to gods of the upper world usually resulted in communal meals, with the cooked victim apportioned to divine and human recipients. Infernal gods, by contrast, received burnt offerings (holocausts), in which the sacrificial victims were burnt to ash, because the living were prohibited from sharing a meal with the dead. This prohibition is reflected also in funeral rites, where the deceased's passage into the realm of the dead is marked with a holocaust to his Manes at his tomb, while his family returns home to share a sacrificial meal at which his exclusion from the feast was ritually pronounced. Thereafter, he was considered part of the collective Manes, sharing in the sacrifices made to them.John Scheid, \\"Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 271. Thus victims for public sacrifices were most often domesticated animals that were a normal part of the Roman diet, while offerings of victims the Romans considered inedible, such as horses and puppies, mark a chthonic aspect of the deity propitiated, whether or not the divinity belonged to the underworld entirely. Secret ritual practices characterized as \\"magic\\" were often holocausts directed at underworld gods, and puppies were a not uncommon offering, especially to Hecate.Scheid, \\"Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors,\\" pp. 263‚Äì264, 269; Robert Parker, Miasma: Pollution and Purification in Early Greek Religion (Oxford University Press, 1996), pp. 357‚Äì358; Fritz Graf, \\"What Is New about Greek Sacrifice?\\" in Kykeon: Studies in Honour of H.S. Versnel (Brill, 2002), p. 118. Di inferi were often invoked in binding spells (defixiones), which offer personal enemies to them.Auguste Audollent, Defixionum Tabellae (A. Fontemoing, 1904), pp. lxii, xcvi, with examples p. 253; Francisco Marco Simon, \\"Formae Mortis: El Tr√°nsito de la Muerte en las Sociedades Antiguas (University of Barcelona, 2009), p. 170; Scheid, \\"Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors,\\" p. 269. The infernal gods were also the recipients on the rare occasions when human sacrifice was carried out in Rome.Scheid, \\"Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors,\\" p. 269. The ritual of devotio, when a general pledged his own life as an offering along with the enemy, was directed at the gods of the underworld under the name Di Manes.Frances Hickson Hahn, \\"Performing the Sacred: Prayers and Hymns,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion, p. 239. Festivals and topography Religious sites and rituals for the di inferi were properly outside the pomerium, Rome's sacred boundary, as were tombs.A.L. Frothingham, \\"Vediovis, the Volcanic God,\\" American Journal of Philology 38 (1917), p. 377. Horse racing along with the propitiation of underworld gods was characteristic of \\"old and obscure\\" Roman festivals such as the Consualia, the October Horse, the Taurian Games, and sites in the Campus Martius such as the Tarentum and the Trigarium. The Taurian Games were celebrated specifically to propitiate the di inferi.John H. Humphrey, Roman Circuses: Arenas for Chariot Racing (University of California Press, 1986), pp. 544, 558; Auguste Bouch√©-Leclercq, Manuel des Institutions Romaines (Hachette, 1886), p. 549; \\"Purificazione,\\" in Thesaurus Cultus et Rituum Antiquorum (LIMC, 2004), p. 83. See also the Lusus Troiae. The rarely raced three-horse chariot (triga, from which the trigarium, as a generic term for \\"field for equestrian exercise\\", took its name) was sacred to the di inferi. According to Isidore of Seville, the three horses represented the three stages of a human life: childhood, youth, and old age.Isidore of Seville, Etymologies 18.36. Arbores infelices In the Etruscan tradition of tree divination, the di inferi were the tutelaries of certain trees and shrubs, on one list the buckthorn, red cornel, fern, black fig, \\"those that bear a black berry and black fruit,\\" holly, woodland pear, butcher's broom, briar, and brambles.\\"Macrobius, Saturnalia 3.20, citing the lost work De Ostentario Arborario by Tarquitius Priscus: Arbores quae inferum deorum avertentiumque in tutela sunt, eas infelices nominant: alternum sanguinem filicem, ficum atram, quaeque bacam nigram nigrosque fructus ferunt, itemque acrifolium, pirum silvaticum, pruscum rubum sentesque quibus portenta prodigiaque mala comburi iubere oportet. Modern English identifications by Robert A. Kaster in his translation of the Saturnalia for the Loeb Classical Library. The wood of these trees, called arbores infelices (\\"inauspicious trees\\"), had apotropaic powers and was used for burning objects regarded as ill omens.Robert A. Kaster, Studies on the Text of Macrobius' Saturnalia (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 48. Christian reception The early Christian poet Prudentius regarded the di inferi as integral to the ancestral religion of Rome, and criticized the gladiatorial games held for them as representative of the underworld gods' inhumane and horrifying nature. To Prudentius, the other Roman gods were merely false, easily explained as euhemerized mortals, but an act of devotion to the di inferi constituted devil worship, because Christians assimilated the di inferi to their beliefs pertaining to Hell and the figure variously known as the Devil, Satan, or Lucifer.Prudentius, Contra Symmachum I.379‚Äì399, II.1086‚Äì1132, and V.354; Friedrich Solmsen, \\"The Powers of Darkness in Prudentius' Contra Symmachum: A Study of His Poetic Imagination,\\" Vigiliae Christianae 19.4 (1965), pp. 238, 240‚Äì248. List of underworld or chthonic deities The following list includes deities who were thought to dwell in the underworld, or whose functions mark them as primarily or significantly chthonic or concerned with death. They typically receive nocturnal sacrifices, or dark-colored animals as offerings. Other deities may have had a secondary or disputed chthonic aspect. Rituals pertaining to Mars, particularly in a form influenced by Etruscan tradition, suggest a role in the cycle of birth and death. Mercury moves between the realms of upper- and underworld as a psychopomp. The agricultural god Consus had an altar that was underground, like that of Dis and Proserpina. Deities concerned with birth are often cultivated like death deities, with nocturnal offerings that suggest a theological view of birth and death as a cycle. The deities listed below are not to be regarded as collectively forming the di inferi, whose individual identities are obscure.

These were crude stabbing spikes made by adding a point to a steel stake which had its rearmost section heated and bent into a crude handle. A more elegant form of the weapon was the introduction of the Poignard-Ba√Øonnette Lebel M1886/14. Approved as a standard military infantry weapon after its development by Lt. Col. CoutrotRoquier, Roger, and Lecoeur, G√©rard, Les couteaux de nos soldats, Paris: Editions Cr√©pin-Leblond, (2001): In 1915, Lt. Col. Coutrot, an artillery officer, was serving as the officer-in-charge of the military acceptance board for machine guns made by MAC (Manufacture d'armes de Ch√¢tellerault) located in the French commune of Ch√¢tellerault, which also happened to be a center of the French cutlery industry. of the French Army, the Poignard-Ba√Øonnette Lebel consisted of a long, needle-pointed, stiletto-profile blade with wood handle and an integrated knuckle guard made of steel. Originally a conversion of the French √âp√©e-Ba√Øonnette Mod√®le 1886 (bayonet), and designed strictly as an offensive weapon, the Poignard-Ba√Øonnette Lebel used a section of the M1886 Lebel' long, narrow stiletto-type cruciform blade, designed to quickly kill a surprised enemy soldier with a single deep thrust. Up to three trench knives could be constructed from a single M1886 Lebel bayonet. Because French industry was working under wartime conditions with numerous material shortages, often using subcontracted labor, even officially sanctioned French Army trench knives tend to vary significantly from knife to knife. The need for knives was so great that already-understrength French Army formations were forced to demobilize hundreds of former cutlery workers so that they could return to their former jobs and begin quantity production of trench knives for the armed forces. As the war went on, newer and more versatile blade-type trench knife patterns such as the double-edged dagger Couteau Poignard Mle 1916 (often called Le Vengeur) began to replace the French Nail and earlier stiletto-style trench knives. The French lead in trench knife development was closely followed by the United States, which introduced three successive trench knife models - the M1917, M1918, and Mark I (1918) - all based directly or indirectly upon previous French designs.

He is currently the co-host of Fox & Friends Weekend on Fox News. He was the host of The Will Cain Show on ESPN Radio, which ran from January 2, 2018, to June 26, 2020. He has been a contributor for ESPN since March 2015, working with the features unit and E:60 and appearing on First Take. He has been a contributor for The Blaze and CNN, appearing frequently on Soledad O'Brien's morning program Starting Point. Early life and education Cain was born and raised in Sherman, Texas, near Dallas.https://twitter.com/willcain/status/903970063895670784 Attending Pepperdine University, Cain played one year on the water polo team and graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in telecommunications in 1997. On the Pepperdine water polo team, Cain was a walk-on who scored his only goal in 1996, in a game against UC Santa Barbara. Cain said of the experience in 2010, \\"Pepperdine water polo was extremely accommodating in its development of a walk-on such as me, and that's something positively unique about this program. I almost went to USC, and I'm sure that if I did have a water polo career there it would have been much shorter.\\" In 2000, Cain completed his J.D. degree at the University of Texas School of Law. After law school, Cain moved to a ranch in Montana, where he worked as a ranch hand while trying to write a book. Media career Following the death of his father in 2001, Cain returned to the Dallas area to help care for his younger brother. While in Texas, Cain bought two community newspapers and started others before selling them to Stephens Media, publisher of the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Around 2006, Cain founded Quince Media, which published a magazine, website, and expos about quincea√±eras. Cain previously worked as a fill-in host for CNN's In the Arena, where he co-hosted the program with E.D. Hill from February 28, 2011, to August 5, 2011. Cain began working at ESPN in 2015 as a radio personality as a fill in for ESPN Radio anchors. He was a frequent contributor to Outside the Lines and eventually became a fill-in host and frequent guest on First Take. Cain then was named co-host of The Ryen Russillo Show but Russillo soon left the show. Cain began hosting his own radio show on ESPN Radio in 2018. The Washington Post observed about Cain's ESPN presence in 2018: \\"Cain's growing profile comes amid consistent charges of liberal bias at ESPN for its coverage of social and political issues in sports.\\" On April 29, 2020, The Washington Post reported that Cain would be leaving ESPN to move to Fox News, where he'd return to covering politics. Cain confirmed the news on June 29, 2020, with his first appearance on Fox & Friends Weekend set for August 15. His last appearance on First Take came June 24, and his final episode of The Will Cain Show aired on June 26. Viewpoints In 2018, The Washington Post labeled Cain as one of ESPN's most conservative voices. Cain told the paper, \\"Has being conservative helped me since I've been here? Of course. ESPN doesn't have a voice like mine.\\" The Washington Post also wrote that Cain \\"has no place in the current political debate ‚Äî he does not support [Donald] Trump ‚Äî and although his show sticks mostly to sports, politics still animate him.\\" Cain had been critical of Trump as early as 2011 while he was with CNN, and revealed on a January 2017 episode of First Take that he did not vote for him in the 2016 election. Cain embraces debate and hearing multiple perspectives on issues, telling Sporting News in 2018, \\"I want The Will Cain Show to be a place where nothing goes unchecked, nothing goes unchallenged. Too much of our media, and not just sports media, but media in general, is one where the people with the voices live in glass houses. They feel like their opinions are either above challenge or that they're incapable of withstanding challenge.\\" Despite frequently clashing with the viewpoints of other ESPN analysts, Cain was generally well-respected by his ESPN colleagues. Bomani Jones said of Cain, \\"Will is willing to have an exchange of ideas back-and- forth. I appreciate that and I respect that.... I think Will does deserve a little bit more credit.\\" Domonique Foxworth also applauded Cain for being willing to discuss differing viewpoints, saying, \\"So many people who are on the air have similar feelings but are afraid to say them. I appreciate that Will is not afraid to say them and is willing to engage with them.\\" =Controversies= On March 11, 2019, Cain likened Antonio Brown's contract requests during Brown's trade to the Oakland Raiders as being \\"like a suicide bomber\\" while discussing the trade on First Take, causing some media backlash on multiple outlets.

Written by Marceau, Gianguido Spinelli, and Jacques Deschamps, the film is about a police inspector, struggling with depression following his wife's death, who investigates a suspicious missing person's case at the request of a mysterious woman. Filmed on location in Normandy, France, Trivial is the second feature- length motion picture directed by actress Sophie Marceau. Plot Lt. Jacques Renard (Christopher Lambert) is struggling with depression following the untimely death of his beloved wife, Chlo√©. After six months in a mental hospital following a suicide attempt, the disheveled and lonely Le Havre police lieutenant is still haunted by visions of his wife. One day, Renard finds a mysterious woman (Sophie Marceau) waiting for him in his car. She implores him to visit the manager of the Hotel Normandy, Antoine B√©rang√®re (Robert Hossein), in nearby Deauville in Room 401. She insists that only Renard can help her, and then leaves. Renard drives to Deauville to the luxury hotel where he meets B√©rang√®re's thirty-nine-year-old son, Camille (Nicolas Briancon), and learns that B√©rang√®re, who worked as manager of the Hotel Normandy for nearly four decades, vanished forty-eight hours earlier under suspicious circumstances. Without identification or money, he took his Mercedes, which he hadn't driven in years, and simply vanished, leaving everything behind except his hunting rifle. When Renard asks about Room 401, Camille insists there is no such room at the hotel. While searching B√©rang√®re's room, Renard discovers a key to Room 401. After a quick search, he finds the room which is decorated with old framed photographs, portraits, and mementos of B√©rang√®re's deceased first wife‚Äîa film actress who looks like the mysterious woman he met in his car. Old newspaper clippings reveal that the actress, Victoria Benutti (Sophie Marceau), died in a car accident in 1970, exactly 36 years ago to the day of B√©rang√®re's disappearance. Camille is annoyed by Renard's presence and inquiry, and Renard's partner Pierre (Simon Abkarian) is convinced that this is a simple suicide case. Renard, however, believes that something far more sinister is happening, and the suspicious actions of Antoine's wheelchair-bound second wife, M√©lanie (Marie-Christine Barrault), convinces Renard that foul play has occurred. At the hotel, Renard meets a Duchess (Judith Magre) who tells him how the \\"ghost of Victoria\\" still haunts the hotel after all these years. Soon after, he sees the mysterious woman and chases her through the hotel and onto the roof, but she eludes him. Shortly after the police discover B√©rang√®re's car abandoned on the cliffs at Deauville, a body presumed to be that of Antoine B√©rang√®re turns up in the city morgue, the skull and face obliterated by a gunshot blast from B√©rang√®re's rifle. While investigating the crime scene at the foot of the cliffs, Renard spots the mysterious woman watching from a distance, and chases after her following her Volvo. After losing her trail, he stops at a gas station inquiring about her car, and by chance learns that shortly after Victoria's car accident in 1970, a man in a Mercedes stopped at the station and called for an ambulance. Renard suspects it was B√©rang√®re. Renard drives to the cemetery where Victoria (and his wife) are buried and finds the mysterious woman's Volvo with a DVD inside labeled \\"Lucie 1982\\". Later he watches the DVD of home movies of a teenager‚Äîscenes of her undressing and being molested‚Äîtaken by B√©rang√®re. In search of Lucie's identity, Renard goes back to the mental hospital where he is still being treated and the head nurse confirms that Lucie was indeed treated at the hospital while he was there following her own attempted suicide. Initially Renard has no memory of her, but later he remembers her and understands that the mysterious woman he's been pursuing is Lucie, the daughter of Victoria. Looking for Lucie's address, Renard steals the hospital computer containing patient records and goes out searching for her, with his partner Pierre in hot pursuit. Renard is eventually captured and taken to jail. Pierre and his colleagues believe he is mentally unstable. Camille visits Renard in jail and tells him about his nanny, Evelyne (Brigitte Damiens), who disappeared after the crash. Camille remembers being in the car with his mother Victoria and her new lover, Albert, when B√©rang√®re ran them off the road in 1970. Later at the hotel, Camille confronts his stepmother, M√©lanie, who reveals that Victoria and her new lover were taking Camille away from B√©rang√®re. Camille then remembers that at the crash site, B√©rang√®re left Camille in the car while taking the baby Lucie with him. B√©rang√®re later entrusted the baby's care and upbringing to Camille's former nanny, Evelyne. Camille eventually finds Evelyne's apartment where he discovers a DVD of home movies showing her being molested by B√©rang√®re. Meanwhile, Lucie visits B√©rang√®re who was wounded by the tramp he killed‚Äîthe same tramp his family was planning to cremate. Obsessed with the memory of Victoria, and after years of molesting Lucie, B√©rang√®re staged his own death so that he and Lucie could run away together. Traumatized by years of abuse, Lucie tried but was unable to kill B√©rang√®re. After Pierre bails him out of jail, Renard goes back to the morgue convinced that the body belongs to some tramp, not B√©rang√®re whom he now knows has been molesting Lucie and controlling her for years. Renard learns from M√©lanie that B√©rang√®re might be hiding on the family yacht, Victoria. At the yacht, Renard discovers B√©rang√®re preparing to escape with a bag full of money. As Renard is about to arrest him, Lucie steps forward with a gun and ties up the surprised lieutenant. Once out to sea, B√©rang√®re prepares to kill Renard, but Lucie lets go of the mast which knocks B√©rang√®re into the ocean where he perishes. She unties Renard and they return to Deauville. Sometime later, Lucie meets Renard on the cliffs at Deauville, and they embrace and kiss.

It is one of just two formally described species in the genus Climacostomum. Description Climacostomum virens, from Alfred Kahl, 1932 Climacostomum virens has a flexible but non-contractile body, long, roughly ovoid or harp- shaped, and flattened from back to front. It has a large posterior contractile vacuole, and a characteristic posterior indentation, or dimple, that is more pronounced in underfed individuals. The posterior vacuole surrounds the cytoproct (anus), through which food waste is eliminated. The macronucleus of Climacostomum virens is normally long and wormlike (vermiform). The cell's most prominent feature is its large oral apparatus, which occupies most of the anterior region. This structure features an adoral zone of membranelles (AZM) partly encircling a wide buccal cavity (mouth), which opens into the cytopharyngeal pouch where digestive vacuoles are formed before they travel down a distinctive long, bent tube into the body of the cell. Members of the species are normally green, because of symbiotic algae (zoochlorellae) that live in the cytoplasm. When individuals are grown in the dark, these algal endosymbionts are reduced in number and the cytoplasm may appear colorless. Climacostomum, from Friedrich Stein, 1859 Classification The species Climacostomum virens was first described in 1833 by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, under the name Spirostomum virens. In 1859, Samuel Friedrich von Stein moved Spirostomum virens to a new genus, which he named Climacostomum. In his Manual of Infusoria (1880), William Saville-Kent rejected Stein's genus, assigning the species instead to Leucophrys patula, which he described as synonymous with Ehrenberg's Spirostomum virens and Leucophrys patula, as well as the Trichoda patula of O.F. Muller. However, the genus was retained by later researchers, including Alfred Kahl.Kahl, Alfred. Urtiere oder Protozoa.

McNally is Professor and Director of Clinical Training in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University. A clinical psychologist and experimental psychopathologist, he studies anxiety disorders (e.g., phobias, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder) and related syndromes (e.g., post- traumatic stress disorder [PTSD], obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD], complicated grief).  Biography  A native of Detroit, Michigan, McNally graduated from Edsel Ford high school in 1972. He attended Henry Ford Community College in Dearborn, Michigan, for two years, studying journalism. He transferred to Wayne State University in Detroit, to study psychology. McNally received his B.S. in psychology from Wayne State University in 1976, and his Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1982, mentored by Steven Reiss. He did his clinical internship and postdoctoral fellowship at the Behavior Therapy Unit, Department of Psychiatry, Temple University School of Medicine. His clinical and research mentor was Edna B. Foa, and he also received clinical supervision from Joseph Wolpe. In 1984 he was appointed Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Health Sciences/The Chicago Medical School where he established the Anxiety Disorders Clinic and directed the university counseling center. He moved to the Department of Psychology at Harvard University in 1991, where he currently serves as Professor and Director of Clinical Training. McNally is a licensed clinical psychologist, a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science and the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies, winner of the 2005 Distinguished Scientist Award from the Society for the Science of Clinical Psychology, and the winner of the 2010 Outstanding Mentor Award from the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies. McNally has been an associate editor for the journal Behavior Therapy, and has served on the editorial boards of Clinical Psychology Review, Journal of Anxiety Disorders, Behaviour Research and Therapy, Journal of Abnormal Psychology, and Psychological Science. He also served on the specific phobia and posttraumatic stress disorder committees of the DSM-IV task force. McNally is on the Institute for Scientific Information's ‚ÄúHighly Cited‚Äù list for psychology and psychiatry (top 0.5% of authors worldwide in terms of citation impact). He has over 430 publications, most concerning anxiety disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder), including the books: including the books: Panic Disorder: A Critical Analysis(1994), Remembering Trauma(2003), and What is Mental Illness?(2011). He has also conducted laboratory studies concerning cognitive functioning in adults reporting histories of childhood sexual abuse (including those reporting recovered memories of abuse). Based upon his research on the controversial topic of adulthood recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse, he concluded that there is no scientifically convincing evidence that people can repress[1][2] (or dissociate) memories of truly traumatic events that they have experienced.. A recent research emphasis is the application of network analysis to the understanding of psychopathology. Research McNally's early research concerned psychophysiological experiments involving Pavlovian fear conditioning tests of the preparedness theory of phobias [e.g., 1: see list below]. This work fostered the reformulation of central ideas concerning the evolutionary background of specific phobias [2, 3]. A second early emphasis concerned conceptual, empirical, and psychometric work on the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), a dispositional measure of the fear of anxiety-related symptoms [4, 5, 6]. Anxiety sensitivity is a risk factor for panic disorder and related syndromes [7]. McNally was among the first investigators to apply information- processing paradigms to elucidate biases in attention, memory, and interpretation in patients with panic disorder [e.g., 8], obsessive-compulsive disorder [e.g., 9], and posttraumatic stress disorder [e.g., 10]. More recent work concerns social anxiety disorder [e.g., 11] and complicated grief [e.g., 12], including experiments designed to attenuate cognitive biases in people with social anxiety [13, 14]. Other publications on various controversies concern the epidemiology of posttraumatic stress disorder [e.g., 15, 16, 17), psychological debriefing following trauma [18] recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse [e.g., 19, 20], cognitive [21] and psychophysiology studies [22] on people reporting having been abducted by space aliens or claiming to have memories from their ‚Äúpast lives‚Äù [e.g., 23], and research on the emotional impact of ‚Äútrigger warnings‚Äù akin to those increasingly common in academia [e.g., 24, 25]. Current research includes network analytic studies on psychopathology [26], including posttraumatic stress disorder [e.g., 27], obsessive-compulsive disorder [e.g., 28], social anxiety disorder [29], complicated grief [30], rumination [31], and posttraumatic growth [32].

It was built by the Canadian Northern Railway along the east-west Canadian Northern Railway line (running from Humboldt to North Battleford) at the intersection with the Canadian Pacific Railway north-south line (running from Regina to Prince Albert). The -storey, stucco-clad, wood-frame train station, was originally located at the intersection of two railway lines. The station building was moved to its current location in 1942 when its use as a station was discontinued; the building is now used as a seniors drop in centre. The building was designated a Municipal Heritage Property in 2004. The original name of the town was Diamond, because the crossing of the two railway lines created a diamond shape. Soon the name of the town site was changed to Warman, named after Cy Warman (1855‚Äì1914), a journalist who followed and recorded the construction of the Canadian National Railway.

Life and background Chimanlal was born in July 1864 at Bharuch, Bharuch district, then in the Bombay Presidency of British India and now part of the state of Gujarat. The eldest of four brothers, he was born into an aristocratic Brahmakshatriya family which had achieved distinction in the law for the preceding two generations. The surname Setalvad derives from the family's origins in the Punjab, where their surname was Talvad. Some Talvads who were leaders of their community became known as Seth ‚Äì Talvads (\\"Chiefs of the Talvads\\") which over time become \\"Setalvad\\". In the 18th century, some Setalvads migrated to present-day Gujarat and settled around Surat, serving as paymasters in the imperial Mughal armies. Chimanlal's grandfather, Ambashankar Brijrai Setalvad (1782‚Äì1853) worked for the East India Company in the early 19th century, initially as a sreshtadar (registrar) in the Sadr Diwani Adalat, the Supreme Civil Claims Court. He was subsequently appointed Sadr Amin, or subordinate judge, for Ahmedabad district. Soon becoming renowned for his legal acumen, he eventually rose to Principal Sadr Amin, the highest judicial post then open to non-Europeans, and held the post at the time of his death. Chimanlal's father, Rao Sahib Harilal Ambashankar Setalvad (1821‚Äì1899), also served as Sadr Amin of Ahmedabad and was awarded the title of Rao Sahib by the British government upon his retirement in 1877. He subsequently served as dewan of the salute state of Limbdi. Career An alumnus of Elphinstone College, Mumbai, he served as one of the members of the Hunter Commission of Inquiry following the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre in 1919, and also served as Vice-Chancellor of Bombay University and as a member of the Governor of Bombay's Executive Council. He also was founding President of Bahishkrit Hitakarini Sabha, established by B.R. Ambedkar in 1924. Chimanlal was recognized by Gandhi as an impartial advocate of great integrity. While in favour of independence from Britain, Chimanlal was opposed to Partition; sadly, he lived to see Partition and its accompanying horrors become a reality before his death on 10 December 1947, aged 83.[Who's Who, 1948] Honours Setalvad was knighted in the 1919 New Year Honours List. He was further appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE) in the 1924 Birthday Honours list. Family He was the father of M.C. Setalvad, later Attorney General of India from 1950 to 1963. His great-granddaughter is Teesta Setalvad, a noted journalist and civil rights activist. Works * Recollections & reflections, an autobiography, Padma Publications, 1946.

Merrie Melodies animated short film directed by Bob Clampett. The short was released on March 29, 1941. Bearing a similar premise to earlier WB shorts Speaking of the Weather and Have You Got Any Castles? but having a cast inspired by food products instead of magazines or books, the cartoon was written by Melvin Millar and produced by Leon Schlesinger. The animators included Vive Risto, Izzy Ellis, John Carey, and Rod Scribner.  Synopsis  The cartoon takes place one winter night, in a grocery store whose owner has just closed the shop. The mascots on the labels of the food products come to life and perform various song and dance numbers. First, a cow for \\"Contented Milk\\" sings to a \\"Fulla Bull Tobacco\\" bull \\"If I Could Be with You,\\" while two other cows on cans reading \\"Discontented Milk\\" ogle and whistle at the bull. Meanwhile, a crab imitating Ned Sparks states \\"This love stuff makes me sick!\\", after which a rabbit named Jack Bunny (a parody of Jack Benny and also a same name from I Love to Singa) tells the music maestro (a dish mop caricaturing Leopold Stokowski) to start up, and a label for \\"Big Top Popcorn\\" comes to life while a dog barker for \\"Barker's Dog Food\\" addresses the crowd and introduces each of the circus's attractions including \\"Little Egypt Wiggly Gum,\\" \\"Billy Posie's Aquackade\\" swimmers (a parody of Footlight Parade's \\"By a Waterfall\\"), and the \\"Tomato Can Can Dancers\\". Meanwhile, an \\"Animal Crackers\\" gorilla (intended to parody King Kong) hears the noise and starts growling, at one point stating to the audience, \\"Gosh, ain't I repulsive?\\" This gorilla stares at the female performers and smiles, he then begins his attack attempting to abduct one of the \\"Can Can Dancers\\"; Jack Bunny sees this and rides a bottle of \\"Horse Radish\\" while an army of \\"Navy Beans\\" and \\"Turtle Soup Turtles\\" shoots at the gorilla, who defends himself with a Roman candle while at one point destroying the bottle of Horse Radish that Jack is riding. Jack sees a box of \\"Chocolate- Covered A1 Cherries\\" and snatches the axe on the label amid cheering from an army of chicks, at which point the gorilla shoots the axe with the candle causing it to shrink. As Jack Bunny dons a sheepish grin and backs into a corner, the image of Superman on a box of \\"Superguy Soap Chips\\" comes to life at the sight of the gorilla lighting a stick of dynamite with Bunny's cigar. Superman flies up to the gorilla and shouts at him, \\"Hey, you big ape!\\" and the gorilla replies \\"Yeah?\\" which scares Superman so much that he turns into a helpless, whining baby. Then, as the gorilla is about to destroy Jack Bunny with the dynamite in his hand, a voice calls out \\"Henry!\\" (in reference to the opening of The Aldrich Family), causing him to pause and run towards the direction of the voice, saying in a frightened voice \\"Coming mother!\\" (another reference to the opening) while his apparent \\"mother\\" drags him away by his ear, chastising him for his naughty behaviors. Jack Bunny breathes a sigh of relief only to realize he's still holding the dynamite, which explodes leaving him in blackface. After being exploded on, he then concludes the cartoon with an Eddie Rochester impression: \\"My oh my, tattletale grey!\\"  Availability  The cartoon is available restored, uncut, and uncensored on Disc 2 of the 2005 DVD Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3. It was also released on The Golden Age Of Looney Tunes Volume 2 laserdisc.

Angola: Foreign Minister Considers Country's Investment Market Attractive allAfrica He is, since 1 March 2020, the Secretary General of the Organization of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (OACPS). He served as Angola's Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2010 to 2017.President swears in Government officials Angola Press Early life and education Georges Rebelo Pinto Chikoti was born at Dondi in Huambo Province, Angola. Chikoti spent a great part of his childhood in Zambia, returning to Angola in 1975. In the early 1980s he was one of the first high-ranking officials of UNITA and their leader Jonas Savimbi subsequently sent him to Ivory Coast for an education program in 1978. He began studies at the University of Abidjan in 1979. He received a master¬ís degree in Economic Geography in 1985. He then pursued doctoral studies at the University of Paris, receiving a diploma of higher studies (with thesis) in 1986. Career Chikoti emigrated to Canada in 1987 and worked at the Imperial Bank of Canada in Toronto for several years before enrolling in the Institute of International Relations and Cooperation at the University of Ottawa in 1989. There he received a diploma in international relations and was also accredited as an assistant professor. At the same time he served as a consultant to the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). In 1990, while still living in Canada, he founded the Angolan Democratic Forum, a political party based on his views and philosophy. In 1992, President Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos invited Chikoti to return to Angola and serve in the Angolan Government as Deputy Minister of External Relations. In 1994, he was formally appointed ambassador in the Angolan diplomatic corps. He has represented the Angolan government at a number of international conferences and summits. He also headed the Angolan delegation to several sessions of the U.S.-Angola Bilateral Consultative Commission in Luanda and Washington in 1999-2000. A decade after entering the government, he is one of the longest serving senior officials. Chikoti was one of the first members of UNITA who traveled to Luanda before the Bicesse agreements, implying that the MPLA government could find a 'modus vivendi' with members of UNITA who did not agree with Jonas Savimbi. The Angolan Democratic Forum participated in the first elections and obtained a seat in the National Assembly. Chikoti later left his party and joined the MPLA, eventually ascending to its Central Committee. George Chikoti has many critics within UNITA, who considered his approach to the MPLA as a betrayal.Quem √© George Chikoty, o novo ministro das Rela√ß√µes Exteriores, angonoticias.com, 21 November 2010 Chikoti opposed the 2011 military intervention in Libya. He said on 29 March 2011 in Luanda, that the Angolan Government defends dialogue for the resolution of the Libyan deadlock instead of a military intervention. Speaking to the press about the current international matters, Chikoti said that any military intervention may contribute to the worsening of the problem.(Republic of Angola (Xyami) blogspot, 29 March 2011) See also *List of current foreign ministers *List of foreign ministers in 2017 *List of current Angolan ministers *Foreign relations of Angola References External links * Category:Living people Category:Ambassadors of Angola to the European Union Category:Foreign ministers of Angola Category:1955 births Category:Ambassadors of Angola to Belgium Category:Ambassadors of Angola to Luxembourg ","title":"Georges Rebelo Chikoti"},{"id":"35502161","text":"SportsChannel Cincinnati is a defunct American regional sports network that was owned by the Rainbow Media division of Cablevision, and operated as an affiliate of SportsChannel.

History The network launched in 1990, with coverage of Major League Baseball games involving the Cincinnati Reds as its flagship programming. In 1996, the network's Reds broadcasts were fed to Tennessee and western North Carolina via Fox Sports South; much of that area is part of the Reds' home territory as defined by the league. On June 30, 1997, Fox/Liberty Networks (owned as a joint venture between News Corporation and Liberty Media) purchased a 40% interest in Cablevision's sports properties (including the SportsChannel networks, Madison Square Garden, and the New York Knicks and New York Rangers) for $850 million. In January 1998, SportsChannel was integrated into Fox Sports Net, a group of regional sports networks created by Fox/Liberty in November 1996. At that time, SportsChannel Cincinnati was folded into Fox Sports Ohio (the former SportsChannel Ohio), serving as a regional subfeed of that network.

It initially operated two escort agencies - one in the capital city Wellington and a second in the nations largest city Auckland. It now operates in Queenstown. Bon Ton is a French term which means \\"good taste\\". The luxury escort agency is owned by Jennifer Souness, a former model who modeled for various European fashion labels. In a feature story on prostitution in New Zealand, the BBC News Online described Bon Ton as \\"an ideal showcase for New Zealand-style liberalisation\\". The escort agency is characterized by quality rooms resembling luxury suites and a professionally maintained office. Louise Jolliffe writing in The Wellington Guide asserted that Bon Ton looks closer to \\"a luxury lodge than a brothel\\". All the women working at Bon Ton have other occupations and work as prostitutes on a part-time basis. During employment testing, applicants are asked whether they like sex. Escort agency owner Souness asserted these women like their work. According to the BBC News Online, the escorts working at Bon Ton say they find the work environment respectful. Bon Ton bills itself as \\"a boutique agency for a select clientele\\" and states that it intends \\"to provide a tasteful and discreet haven for gentlemen to enjoy the attentions of elegant, beautifully groomed, intelligent women\\". The website of the escort agency makes invitation calls to potential clients to come into what is described as a \\"safe and secret oasis where the outside world melts away\\". The Bon Ton website publishes biographies of their prostitutes ‚Äì whom they refer to as \\"courtesans\\" ‚Äì which include their age and brassiere measurement. As per the requirement by the Prostitution Reform Act 2003, Bon Ton has a safe sex policy that requires customers to wear condoms.

In some instances, government authorities work with private developers to seize land from villagers, with compensation below the market price. In many cases, they are also offered alternative housing instead of or on top of monetary compensation. Forced evictions are particularly common in rural areas, and are a major source of unrest and public protest.The Economist, ‚ÄúProtest in China: The Cauldron Boils‚Äù, 29 September 2005. By some estimates, up to 65 percent of the 180,000 annual mass conflicts in China stem from grievances over forced evictions.Elizabeth C. Economy, A Land Grab Epidemic: China‚Äôs Wonderful World of Wukans , Council on Foreign Relations, 7 February 2012. Some citizens who resist or protest the evictions have reportedly been subjected to harassment, beatings, or detention. The rate of forced evictions has grown significantly since the 1990s, as city and county-level governments have increasingly come to rely on land sales as an important source of revenue. In 2011, the Financial Times reported that 40 percent of local government revenue comes from land sales.Rahul Jacob, Drop in China's land sales poses threat to growth, Financial Times, 7 December 2011. Guan Qingyou, a professor at Tsinghua University, estimated that land sales accounted for 74 percent of local government income in 2010.Simon Rabinovitch, Worries grow as China land sales slump, Financial Times, 5 January 2012. Legal framework The practice of land requisitions and forced evictions is widespread in China as local governments make way for private real estate developers. Under Chinese property law, there is no privately held land; ‚Äúurban land‚Äù is owned by the state, which grants land rights for a set number of years. Rural, or ‚Äúcollectively owned land,‚Äù is leased by the state for periods of 30 years, and is theoretically reserved for agricultural purposes, housing and services for farmers. The underlying assumptions of property law are radically different in Chinese law than in most Western countries, and specifically the \\"Common Law\\" of English-speaking countries. In Common Law there is often a degree of ambiguity as to who should benefit from public investment. Governments can legally expropriate land for the public benefit. The State may forcibly evict occupants and extinguish the rights of owners and tenants upon payment of compensation. In many Common Law jurisdictions, this includes expropriation of land for on-sale to a private individual or company. To this extent Chinese and Common Law are the same. The difference is that in Common Law there is a presumption that any increase in the value of the land due to changed conditions which give rise to the opportunity for redevelopment for a higher usage should accrue to the land-owner; while in China it is considered just that the economic benefits of public investment should accrue to the people in general. In China, therefore, when the state invests in public infrastructure ‚Äì roads, trains, water, electricity distribution, etc. ‚Äì there will simultaneously be a reconsideration of land use in the areas affected. If a planning decision is taken to re-zone land for a higher use, the state will generally expropriate the land, consolidate it into parcels consistent with the proposed new usage, and then offer it on the market on a new 40‚Äì70 year lease (the term depending on the usage). This operation also allows for civic improvements including road widening and the creation of public open space. Forced evictions are forbidden under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (which China has ratified) but this does not clearly define the term ‚Äúforced eviction‚Äù as distinct from the action of expropriation or resumption which is normal and common in Common Law jurisdictions. Under China's constitution and other property laws, resumption of urban land by the state is permitted only for the purpose of supporting the ‚Äúpublic interest,‚Äù and those being evicted are supposed to receive compensation, resettlement, and protection of living conditions. This is exactly the same as in most other legal systems in the world. Again, in China as in other countries, the ‚Äúpublic interest‚Äù is, however, not defined. Abuses are common in the expropriation process, with many citizens complaining of receiving little or no compensation.Congressional Executive Commission on China, 2010 Annual Report. 10 October 2010, pp 41‚Äì42 Collectively owned rural land may be \\"reallocated\\" at the discretion of authorities. By reclassifying rural land as urban land, it can then be sold at a profit. At the same time, in many other instances very liberal compensation is paid by local governments eager to avoid delays to development projects. In 2011, China's legislative body implemented a new law limiting the use of violence in forced evictions, as well as outlawing the clearing of property at night and during holidays. Under the 2011 regulation, violent law enforcement measures are to be used only in \\"emergencies,\\" though the term is not defined. Chinese authorities declared that the law‚Äîwhich took twelve years to draft‚Äîwould help protect human rights.Chris Hogg, China law to limit home demolitions and evictions, BBC News, 1 July 2011. Here again, Chinese law differs from Common Law and other jurisdictions around the world, which have no legal restrictions on the use of force by law officers in evicting former land occupants who refuse to depart peacefully. Prevalence Forty three percent of villages surveyed across China report the occurrence of expropriations and from the mid-1990s to mid-2000s, an estimated 40 million Chinese farmers were affected by land requisitions.Eva Pils, 'Asking the Tiger for His Skin: Rights Activism in China', Fordham International Law Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4 (2006). Since 2005, surveys have indicated a steady increase in the number of forced evictions in China, with local government appropriating the land of approximately 4 million rural Chinese citizens annually. Forced evictions with inadequate compensation occur frequently in both urban and rural contexts, with even fewer legal protections for rural citizens. In most instances, the land is then sold to private developers at an average cost of 40 times higher per acre than the government paid to the villagers., reflecting the fundamental assumption in Chinese law discussed above that the land belongs to the people as a whole and that increases in value should flow to the people. Notable examples An estimated 1.4 million people were displaced as part of the Three Gorges Dam project. Although forced evictions occur throughout China in both rural and urban environments, there are several notable examples in which hundreds of thousands of people were evicted. From 1993 to 2003, 2.5 million people were evicted in the city of Shanghai. In preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, many of Beijing's densely populated neighborhoods were torn down in order to make way for new developments and infrastructure projects. The Center on Housing Rights and Evictions estimated that 1.5 million people in and around Beijing were forced from their homes, often with inadequate compensation. Chinese authorities maintained only 6,000 families were relocated, and that all received proper compensation.Ben Blanchard, Forced evictions dull Games spirit for some in Beijing, Reuters, 6 August 2008. From 1995 to 2005, an average of 86,754 people were evicted annually in connection to the Three Gorges Dam,United Nations Human Settlements Programme (2007), Forced Evictions‚ÄîTowards Solutions?, . totaling an estimated 1.4 million people.Peter Ford, Controversial Three Gorges dam has problems, admits China, Christian Science Monitor, 19 May 2011. Recalcitrant residents in the city of Chongqing had their water and electricity turned off in order to force them to move; the residents said they had not yet left because proper resettlement hadn't been arranged.Shi Jiangtao, Chinese Advisor Confirms Forced Eviction for Three Gorges Project, South China Morning Post, 7 March 2008. Protest and opposition Forced evictions are a common catalyst for organized protests and demonstrations. According to some estimates, as much as 65 percent of the estimated 180,000 annual \\"mass incidents\\" (protests) in China stem from grievances over forced evictions. Notable examples of large-scale demonstrations against forced evictions include the December 2011 protests in the Southern village of Wukan, which resulted in the temporary expulsion of Communist Party authorities,Andrew Jacobs, Village Revolts Over Inequities of Chinese Life, New York Times, 14 December 2011. and the 2005 Dongzhou protests, which ended with the shooting deaths of several protesting villagers by riot squad police who, unlike regular police, are armed.BBC, Chinese police 'shoot protesters', 7 December 2005. A number of individual protests have also made international headlines: on 26 May 2011, Qian Mingqi, a farmer from Fuzhou whose home had been demolished to make room for a highway, complained of losing 2 million yuan in the forced eviction. After numerous failed attempts to petition authorities for redress, on 26 May 2011, Qian detonated three bombs at government buildings.Henry Sanderson and Michael Forsythe, Chinese See Communist Land Sales Hurting Mao‚Äôs Poor to Pay Rich, Bloomberg, 23 October 2011. He was hailed as a hero by many Chinese internet users, who viewed the attacks not as a form of terrorism, but as \\"righteous vengeance.\\"Peter Ford, ' Chinese bomber receives outpouring of sympathy online', The Christian Science Monitor, 27 May 2011 In August 2008, two elderly women in their 70s were sentenced to a year of reeducation-through- labor when they applied for a permit to protest in the government's approved \\"protest zone\\" during the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Wu Dianyuan, 79, and Wang Xiuying, 77, were evicted from their Beijing homes in 2001. They were promised compensation and resettlement, but it was never delivered.Andrew Jacobs, Too Old and Frail to Re-educate? Not in China, New York Times, 20 August 2008. Citizens have also resorted to a variety of semi-institutionalized forms of resistance, including petitioning actions and the use of legal channels to challenge forced land requisitions or demand compensation. In the first half of 2004, for instance, China's construction ministry reported receiving petitions from more than 18,600 individuals and 4,000 groups over forced evictions and unlawful transfers of land.Edward Cody, China's Land Grabs Raise Specter of Popular Unrest, Washington Post, 5 October 2004.

Biography Janatin was born in Jatisobo, Banyumas, on 18 March 1943. He graduated from middle school in 1962. On 1 June 1962, he entered the Indonesian Marine Corps, and was appointed as one of three volunteers to serve in the military operation Komando Siaga (later renamed Komando Mandala Siaga), led by Air Force Vice Admiral Omar Dhani, during the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation. Janatin was later stationed at Sambu Island, Riau. Bombing of MacDonald House On 8 March 1965, Janatin, Harun Thohir, and Gani bin Arup were assigned to conduct sabotage in Singapore: equipped with a rubber boat and of explosives, they were told to bomb an important building of their own choice. On 10 March 1965, they targeted a civilian building, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank building (now the MacDonald House), killing three and wounding at least thirty-three, all civilians. Capture and Conviction Janatin and Thahir subsequently escaped to a beach, while Gani disappeared and presumably returned back to Indonesia. After seizing a motorboat, which broke down at sea, they were rescued by another boat and subsequently handed over to the Singapore Marine Police on 13 March 1965. Initially claiming to be engaged in fishing, they were however arrested and interrogated by the local police. Janatin and Thahir were convicted of murder as they had been wearing civilian clothes at the time and had targeted a civilian building; both men were sentenced to death by a Singapore court. The two were hanged in Changi Prison on 17 October 1968. Janatin's remains were taken back to Indonesia and buried in Kalibata Heroes Cemetery, Jakarta. National Heroes They were awarded the status of Indonesian national heroes on 17 October 1968 (the same day they were hanged) and were posthumously promoted to one rank higher than those they held prior to their last operation. KRI Usman-Harun (359) In 2014, one of three ships of the Bung Tomo-class corvette of the Indonesian Navy (initially built for Brunei but later sold to Indonesia) was named after him and Thahir as the KRI Usman-Harun (bearing the pennant number 359). The ship's name caused controversy between Indonesia and Singapore due to the bombing attack of 1963 and its immediate after-effects. Indonesia has not reversed its naming decision; in response, the Singapore government has banned the ship from entering its waters or docking in the country.

It shows the view from his studio window on the outer reaches of The Hague at the Schenkweg, then undergoing a period of urban development. The view is across the Schenkweg ditch towards the newly constructed Rijnspoor railway station, built for the Utrecht-Gouda-The Hague railway, and now the Den Haag Centraal railway station. Rijswijk was then a small rural community to the south, bordering Delft but stretching all the way to The Hague. The land on which the Rijnspoor was built was ceded to The Hague by Rijswijk. It is now a suburb of The Hague. The painting is amongst the very first paintings by van Gogh. Although he had been drawing for many years and occasionally applied watercolor washes, he did not take up painting proper until his study visit to his cousin-in-law and mentor Anton Mauve at The Hague in December 1881.  Background  At the end of August 1881, van Gogh visited his cousin-in-law Anton Mauve, a noted and successful painter and a leading member of the Hague School, and showed him some studies and drawings he had made. Mauve encouraged him and suggested that he now start painting. At the end of the following November, van Gogh returned to the Hague for a month to take painting lessons from Mauve, during which time he saw him almost daily. He returned to his family home in Etten at Christmas with the intention of setting up a studio there, but quarreled disastrously with his father, a pastor, over his refusal to attend church on Christmas Day. This, in turn, was a consequence of his bitterness over his spurned love for his widowed cousin Kee Vos Stricker that had led to so much family tension that year. He left home that same Christmas Day and returned to The Hague, resolved to set up his studio there.Naifeh and Smith (2011) pp. 249-52  At Schenkweg  80th birthday celebration of van Gogh's great-uncle Johannes Andricus Stricker, c.

At that time it was open countryside, a polder reclaimed in medieval times, but the land was increasingly being sold for development. These new developments were cheaply constructed, and they attracted a less affluent class of people.Naifeh and Smith (2011) p.272-73 Today the urban conurbation extends a further three miles east, although there remains an extensive park and woodlands just north of the Schenkweg called the Haagse Bos, one of the last remaining stretches of ancient forest in the Netherlands, where van Gogh painted some early studies in August 1882.

An aunt of his cousin Kee Vos Stricker lived at the Huis te Hoorn in Rijswijk, and van Gogh was a frequent guest of the family when he was working at the art dealership Goupil & Co., whose Hague branch his uncle Cent, Vincent van Gogh (a namesake), had helped found. On one such occasion he walked into Rijswijk with his brother Theo, probably to attend the 80th birthday party of his great-uncle Johannes Andricus Stricker. The walk seems to have cemented his relationship with his younger brother as he often subsequently referred to it in his letters. Evidently they discussed the possibility of becoming painters together. The family photo taken at the time (right) is said to include both Vincent and Theo, as well as their cousin Kee Vos Stricker and the Haanebeek sisters, Caroline and Annet, for which Vincent and Theo harboured unrequited youthful loves respectively.Cassee, Elly. \\"In Love: Vincent van Gogh's First True Love.\\" Van Gogh Museum Journal, 1996, pp. 108-17. = Studio = Woman Knitting Near a Window, watercolor, January 1882, location unknown (F910a, JH90). Note the view from the window and the pots of flowers on the window sill. The painting belonged to Tersteeg, whose support for van Gogh at this time was so equivocal and eventually outrightly hostile. Sketch of the view from his studio window in letter 200 (F-, JH930). below) in letter 251 (F-, JH157). below) in letter 252 (F-, JH165). Van Gogh rented his studio at 136 Schenkweg, about 10 minutes walk from Mauve's studio at Uilebomen 198 (now the Boomsluiterskade). The studio was actually on a side street, called the Schenkstraat, off the Schenkweg. The Rijnspoor station lay about a quarter mile to the north-west. Today there are railway tracks coming up from the south into the station from Amsterdam, but these were laid much later in the 1970s when the Centraal station was constructed. In van Gogh's time the only tracks came into the station from the east from Utrecht, and he would have had an uninterrupted walk to Mauve. Van Gogh wrote that the studio faced \\"more or less\\" south. It follows that the view in Meadows near Rijswijk and the Schenkweg was from the back window facing north, which would indeed have been where van Gogh would have posed his models for preference, as artists prefer the light from the north because it is more constant. The studio cost 7 guilders a month to rent, and Mauve lent van Gogh 100 guilders to furnish it, insisting he had to have a bed. Van Gogh decorated the studio with his own studies, with prints from a complete set of The Graphic between 1870 and 1880 that he had acquired at a bargain price, and with flowers and a couple of boxes of bulbs. He declared himself happy and content with the result. Nevertheless, the accommodation was of the simplest kind. Arnold Pomerans remarked that it was the beginning of a long series of plainly furnished rooms, of which the Bedroom in Arles would eventually become a world-famous symbol.Pomerans (2003) p. 128 Van Gogh used his studio to draw from models, either directly at the studio or for finishing sketches he called \\"scratches\\" that he made on the street and in other locations, including especially the Geest, a working-class district in The Hague. In these expeditions he often accompanied his contemporary George Hendrik Breitner, although Breitner's subject was the city itself rather than the figure.Naifeh and Smith (2011) pp. 262-63 Mauve had introduced van Gogh to the Pulchri Studio, The Hague's leading art society. As an associate member van Gogh had the right to draw from the figure two evenings a week, but he appears to have made scant use of this facility. Instead he relied on a stream of models he found in such places as soup kitchens and almshouses, spending on them a significant part of the allowance Theo sent him.Naifeh and Smith (2011) p. 274 Amongst these models were his mistress Sien Hoornik, model for Sorrow, and Adrianus Jacobus Zuyderland, model for At Eternity's Gate. His obsessive insistence on drawing from models brought him into conflict with both Mauve and his influential patron Hermanus Tersteeg, head of The Hague's branch of Goupil he had once worked for.Naifeh and Smith (2011) p. 272 ff.Pomerans (2003) pp. 138-43 Mauve visited the studio at the end of January, and his subsequent coolness towards van Gogh appears to have stemmed from that visit, made awkward by the unexpected arrival of one of van Gogh's models.Naifeh and Smith (2011) p. 257-58 Later that year, in July, in anticipation of marrying Sien, as well as wanting a bigger studio so that he could position himself further away from his models, he moved into more spacious accommodation next door at a rent of 12.50 guilders a month. That winter, Sien's mother moved in and van Gogh's relationship with Sien, never easy, sharply deteriorated. In September 1883, at his brother's urging, he left Sien for Drenthe, putting an end to what was to prove the only domestic relationship he ever enjoyed and for which he had yearned. Both his studios at Schenkweg can be seen in Houses at Schenkweg (below) in the block of houses extending to the right side of the drawing: \\"His first studio was in the somewhat higher building with the four doors and was on the left-hand side of the upper floor. His second apartment, into which he moved in July 1882, was on the upper floor to the left of the first one.\\" Hulsker (1980) p. 40 The whole area has since been extensively redeveloped. There is a commemorative plaque in the Hendrick Hamelstraat at : a children's playground lies directly opposite and further back the Hoftoren can be seen.  Perspective Frame  A 1525 woodcut by Albrecht D√ºrer demonstrating the use of a perspective frame (in Unterweisung der Messung mit dem Zirkel und Richtscheit. Das Lehrbuch der Malerei). A sketch in Letter 253 showing how van Gogh proposed to use his new perspective frame in the dunes at Scheveningen. Bridge at Arles, oil on canvas, March 1888 (F397, JH1368). Van Gogh used a perspective frame to help him with his drawing. This is a device that had been used for centuries by such artists as Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht D√ºrer, and is still used today by artists and students in the form of simple cardboard cut-outs threaded with cotton. Many of his drawings show traces of squaring as a result of using this technique. The versions used by van Gogh were elaborate affairs, however. The final version he had made for him at The Hague by a carpenter living next door had adjustable legs so that he could use it in rough terrain. He also used his perspective frame indoors to study his models, and one reason he moved to a larger studio next door was to make better use of his perspective frame. Van Gogh called his perspective frame his \\"little window\\". Writing about Roofs Seen from the Artist's Attic Window (below), he wrote: Van Gogh took his perspective frame with him to Arles, using it notably in Bridge at Arles.Naifeh and Smith (2011) p. 576 He dispensed with at Auvers, however. Naifeh and Smith suggest that windows played an important role in van Gogh's life, as a way of gazing at the world without distraction, unobserved.Naifeh and Smith (2011) pp. 290-3  Gallery  The very fine study Tree Roots in a Sandy Ground ('Les racines') was renamed Les Racines by the Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum, Otterlo, identifying it with a drawing mentioned in a letter to Theo of 1 May 1882. In that letter, van Gogh said he wanted to express something of life's struggle, as also in a larger version (now lost) of Sorrow, his iconic nude study of Sien completed at the same time. Sorrow is cited by Jan Hulsker as an example of the technical proficiency van Gogh had attained in the six months since his first clumsy attempts at figure drawing in Etten the year before, and the same degree of mastery is evident in Tree Roots. Tree roots were also the subject of one of the last paintings (if not actually the last) van Gogh made before his death, presumed a suicide, in 1890. This was Tree Roots, although there is no evidence that he was similarly preoccupied with the theme of life's struggle at the time of its painting. The 1882 drawing Tree Roots was purchased by the Dordrecht art collector J. Hidde Nijland before 1895. Nijland's entire collection of 116 van Gogh drawings that he built up was purchased in 1928 by the Dutch shipping magnate Anton Kr√∂ller, husband of Helene Kr√∂ller-M√ºller, for 100,000 guilders, and became the nucleus of the collection at the Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum.Hulsker (1980) p. 42Eva Rovers - Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art Vol. 33, No. 4 (2007/2008), pp. 258-272 File:Vincent van Gogh - Houses on Schenkweg (F915).jpgalt= A somewhat sombre drawing of a group of isolated buildings under a heavy sky.

This is another of van Gogh's very earliest watercolors. Landscape with a Carriage and a Train, oil on canvas, June 1890, Pushkin Museum, Moscow (F760, JH2019). The Rijnspoor railway station was built in 1870. The railway line from Utrecht passed within a few hundred yards of van Gogh's front door and he must have been constantly aware of the trains passing to and fro. However, he seemed not to have sketched or painted them at this time, as he was to later in such works as Landscape with a Carriage and a Train (right). Nevertheless, his artist's eye was not offended by modernity, and van Gogh regularly incorporated images of modernity into his drawings and paintings. He liked to sketch in the third-class waiting room at Rijnspoor as well as in the railway yards. In a letter to Theo written that October, he describes the scene at the yards: He was equally lyrical describing Landscape with a Carriage and a Train in a letter to his sister Wil:  Gallery  The drawings Rijnspoor Station, Factory and Gasworks may have been part of a series of twelve studies of the Hague commissioned by van Gogh's Uncle Cor, Cornelis Marinus van Gogh, who owned a book store in Amsterdam where he also sold prints. Cor visited van Gogh in his studio in early March 1882 and had looked through van Gogh's portfolio, mostly without comment. But when he alighted on van Gogh's drawing Old Street (below) in the Jewish quarter in the Paddemoes area, which van Gogh had made on a sketching trip with Breitner, he was sufficiently impressed by it to commission twelve drawings from van Gogh at a price of a rijkdaalder (two and a half guilders) each. Van Gogh declared it a miracle in a letter to Theo. Cor ordered a further six in April, but payment was slow in arriving for this second commission and when it finally came it was less than expected and apparently accompanied by a reprimand, real or imagined, reproaching him for imagining \\"such drawings had the least commercial value\\". There were no further orders.Hulsker (1980) p.84Naifeh and Smith (2011) pp. 263-6 The Iron Mill at the Hague was the Enthoven factory at The Hague situated on the Zieke, a street running parallel to the Schenkweg. The Pollard Willow (above) lay on the path towards it, the Rijnspoor yards visible on the horizon. The owner, Lodewijk Cornelis Enthoven, an industrialist and art collector, acquired a considerable collection of van Gogh's work from the Hague, including a second version (F944) of Carpenter's Yard and Laundry (above), and later from van Gogh's Nuenen and Paris periods. His art collection was sold in 1920 at his death. Some twenty of his van Gogh works were purchased by Helene Kr√∂ller- M√ºller, and eventually passed into the collection of the Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum. Family tradition had it that Enthoven supported van Gogh financially at The Hague and later received an 'endless stream of laments, ... all of them accompanied by small sketches and scratches' from Nuenen and Antwerp. Later still, it is said van Gogh sent him rolls of painting and sketches from France. Supposedly, these were found unopened in Enthoven's attic by his children and burned.W.J.A. Visser, ‚ÄòVincent van Gogh en 's-Gravenhage‚Äô, Geschiedkundige Vereniging Die Haghe. Jaarboek 1973. The Hague 1973, pp. 1-125. However, there is no evidence to support this tradition and Lodewijk Enthoven is not mentioned directly in van Gogh's surviving letters.

Today's Draw, sketch in letter 270, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam,(F-, JH223). \\"... a splendid bald head, big ears and white sidewhiskers (n.b. deaf).\\" Van Gogh made many drawings he called \\"scratches\\", taken directly from life on the spot outdoors. Although these have a fresh spontaneous character, they were nevertheless carefully reworked in his studio with the aid of his models and perspective frame. He sought his subjects in the working-class district of the Geest and its adjoining markets. The Geest was a tightly packed district of narrow streets and courtyards on the west side of The Hague. At the Papestraat, on its eastern flank, it lay scarcely two hundred yards from Goupil's prestigious address at Plaats 20 in the center of the city. It was the district his mistress Sien Hoornik had come from. But the kind of courtyards, called hofjes, that Sien's mother lived in were nothing like the elegant little hofjes seen in Dutch cities today. They were little more than slums created by building warrens of tiny houses between and behind existing town houses to accommodate a rapidly expanding population, and they have long since disappeared. Van Gogh described the area as the 'Whitechapel' of The Hague in a letter to his friend and mentor Anthon van Rappard. Breitner had his studio on its northern flank at no. 16 Juffrouw Idastraat at : the house still stands. The State Lottery office was situated in the Spuistraat a little to the south of the Geest district, the oldest and busiest shopping street in The Hague. This was where van Gogh's uncle Cent had originally opened his art store that eventually merged with Goupil. In October 1882, Van Gogh made a watercolor of a group of people queuing in front of the lottery (right) as part of his plan to produce a 'saleable' work before the end of the year. To this end he had elected to make studies of groups of people 'doing something or other', studies that had something 'nice and sociable about them'.Hulsker (1980) p. 58Naifeh and Smith (2011) p. 313 He wrote of this painting: In the same letter he also mentioned that he was working on a painting of a church pew that he had seen in a small church in the Geest where the almsmen went. This was probably the Bethlehemskerk, since demolished, in the Breedstraat, the 'church of the poor' behind Slijkeinde in the Geest where Sien's mother had her house. Attendance at the church was compulsory. The painting was Church Pew with Worshippers (above right), and several of his models of the time can be recognised in it. Hulsker remarks that the huddling of figures in State Lottery was certainly more successful than that in Church Pew, a subject apparently beyond him.Hulsker (1980) p. 62 Van Gogh went on to say that almsmen in that district were known as 'orphan men', and said he had taken on a bald, deaf, old orphan man with white sideboards as a model, providing a little scratch (left) of his bald head in his letter. This was Zuyderland (above left), who went on to feature in dozens of subsequent studies over the following winter months. He is the figure in a top hat to the right in the letter sketch for State Lottery (above left), and appears in profile, recognisable by his trademark whiskers, in the watercolor itself. Naifeh and Smith characterise the Geest as the red-light district of The Hague, and suggest that van Gogh was already using prostitutes during his time at Goupil's. Certainly by 1882 he was frank about using prostitutes, even recommending them to Theo in his letters. Sien Hoornik herself was a prostitute. Both van Gogh and Breitner were hospitalised in 1882 for gonorrhea.Naifeh and Smith (2011) pp. 77-9, 250, 277-9, 294-5  Van Gogh and Breitner  George Hendrik Breitner ‚Äì Street View in The Hague (?), Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam (SK-A-3547). George Hendrik Breitner ‚Äì Sketch of people on the street, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. George Hendrik Breitner ‚Äì Distribution of Soup, watercolor, 1882, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam. George Hendrik Breitner came to enjoy considerable success as a painter and photographer. In his student days he associated with painters of the Hague School such as Jozef Isra√´ls, Jacob Maris and Anton Mauve, and he was a member of the Pulchri Society. Later he distanced himself from the movement and he is now generally regarded as an Amsterdam Impressionist, although he retained the muted color palette of the Hague School. Van Gogh appears to have been introduced to him by Theo, and the pair sketched together in the working-class districts of The Hague in the early months of 1882. Breitner was motivated to do so because he regarded himself as a painter of the common folk. Van Gogh, initially at any rate, was more intent on recruiting models. It is likely that Breitner introduced van Gogh to the novels of √âmile Zola and the cause of social realism. Breitner was hospitalised in April. Van Gogh visited him in hospital, but Breitner did not return the visits when van Gogh himself was hospitalised two months later, and they did not meet again until the following July when van Gogh was on the verge of leaving The Hague and Breitner spending more time in Rotterdam than the Hague. At that time van Gogh gave Theo a less than flattering account of Breitner's paintings as resembling mouldy wallpaper, although he did say he thought he would be all right in the end. For his part, there is no evidence that Breitner saw anything notable in van Gogh's work. He later reminisced that sketching with van Gogh was problematic because, whereas Breitner sketched discreetly in a notebook, van Gogh came laden with apparatus and attracted hostile attention.Naifeh and Smith (2011) p. 307 In a letter to Theo of 11 September 1882, van Gogh recounted how a fellow suddenly spat a wad of tobacco onto his drawing while sketching at the potato market. Two years after van Gogh's death, Breitner wrote that he did not like van Gogh's paintings:\\"‚ÄòI can‚Äôt help it, but to me it seems like art for Eskimos, I cannot enjoy it. I honestly find it coarse and distasteful, without any distinction, and what's more, he has stolen it all from Millet and others.\\" Letter to Johanna van der Weele (wife of Herman), 25 December 1892, cited by P.H. Hefting, ‚ÄòBrieven van G.H. Breitner aan H.J. van der Weele‚Äô, in 19de eeuwse Nederlandse schilderkunst.

Sorrow, pencil and wash, signed lower left, April 1882, Private collection, The Hague (F929, JH129). Charles Bargue ‚Äì Man seated upon the ground, his head on his knees, plate III-24 of the Cours de Dessin Van Gogh drew his famous nude study of Sien, Sorrow, in April 1882. There were originally three versions, two being imprints, of which two survive. F929 (right) is the signed pencil version he gave to van Rappard. The other surviving version, F929a, worked up in chalk and decorated with flowers and a quotation from Michelet, \\"How is it possible that a woman can be left alone on earth ‚Äì abandoned?\\", comes from the estate of Jo Bonger, Theo's wife, but is not thought to be the one he sent to Theo, which was a pencil version and is now lost (that is to say, van Gogh kept the surviving chalk version with the Michelet quotation for himself). Regarding Sien's situation, it is noteworthy that in those days for a woman to be abandoned by her husband was considered grounds for withholding charity, as she was supposed to have necessarily brought her downfall on herself. Van Gogh no doubt wanted to portray downfall in his original version of the drawing, but in a letter describing a later larger version he made soon after (also lost) he makes it clear that his program, in that version at any rate, was to depict something of life's struggle, a rare commentary on his intentions.Zemel (1997) pp. 27-30 Naifeh and Smith point out that van Gogh's final break with Mauve occurred less than a week later following that letter, implying that he was preparing the ground in his letter for the inevitable exposure of his affair with Sien.Naifeh and Smith (2011) p. 281 According to van Gogh himself, the inspiration for the strong contour line was a woodcut after Millet, La grande berg√®re assise (left). Later, at Arles, he made a painting, The Shepherdess, F699, of the same subject. However, Hulsker thought the strongest influence was Bargue's Exercices au Fusain (Exercises in Charcoal Drawing), part of his celebrated Cours de Dessin (Drawing Course) published by Goupil (left), which Tersteeg had lent van Gogh in September 1880 and which van Gogh had said in a letter immediately preceding he had completed 'several times'. The course itself was not returned to Tersteeg until June 1883 at a meeting where Tersteeg again repeated his advice that van Gogh should concentrate on making watercolors rather than drawings. Van Rappard was given the drawing in return for a gift of 2.50 guilders he had given van Gogh to get a tear in one of his drawings repaired: On 7 February 2005, the drawing was sold at Christie's in London for ¬£680,000. On 20 June 2012, the drawing fetched ¬£1,329,250 at the same auction house.

The model was Zuyderland.Naifeh and Smith (2011) pp. 318-9 Hubert von Herkomer ‚Äì Gipsy Woman with Child, 1870 (Herkomer's first work for The Graphic). Van Gogh was influenced especially by the social realism of the English illustrators, such as Hubert von Herkomer, Samuel Luke Fildes, and Frank Holl, working for The Graphic, a British weekly illustrated newspaper founded by the social reformer William Luson Thomas. Van Gogh frequently referred to them in his letters, and he had obtained a complete set of back numbers of The Graphic between 1870 and 1880, decorating his studio with his favourite prints. By August 1882, he had taken up painting in oils in earnest but, despite a promising start, he abruptly abandoned it after a month, not to resume again until the following summer. Part of the reason was undoubtedly the expense of painting in oils, but Naifeh and Smith suggest the real reason was that at that time his heart lay in drawing: in his moving letter of 16 May 1882, describing his final humiliation from the family of Kee Vos and how he had come to meet Sien and his relationship with her, he wrote: By September, Sien had recovered from her difficult confinement and was ready to pose again. At the same time, van Gogh had discovered his orphan man, Zuyderland, who became his favourite and most patient model. With the winter drawing in and working outdoors increasingly difficult, van Gogh retreated to his studio and returned to drawing figures. He used the remaining canvas from his work in oils to shutter his windows and adjust the light falling on his models.Naifeh and Smith (2011) pp. 306-13 In early November, Theo told him about a new development in lithography, a new kind of transfer paper which did away with the need to draw directly onto stone. Van Gogh was enthusiastic about the process and for a while entertained plans to prepare a series of prints.Naifeh and Smith (2011) pp. 320-2  Gallery  Private Collection, The Netherlands (F1020b, JH331). Old Woman Seen from Behind, pencil, pen, brown ink (originally black), opaque light green watercolor, March 1882, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F913, JH109). Sketch in letter 324 (F-, JH332). Sketch in letter 323 (F1020, JH333). The Paddemoes (F918 below) lay in the Jewish quarter of the Buurt (the Court) near the Nieuwe Kerk (New Church). It was The Hague's poorest district in medieval times, but was demolished in 1649 when the Nieuwe Kerk was built. The Jewish community subsequently settled in the area from 1675 onwards. Van Gogh said he had made the drawing on a midnight jaunt with Breitner, seen from the Turfmarkt (the area has been extensively redeveloped since). This was the drawing that impressed his Uncle Cor sufficiently to commission a series of 12 similar studies from van Gogh. The bakery in the Noordstraat (F914 below) lay in the Geest district, opposite Sien's mother's house at no. 16 and next to the newly built Zuid-Hollandsche Bierbrouwerij (South Holland Brewery). This brewery's brand of beer \\"ZHB\\", evidently not appreciated by all, was famously nicknamed Zieken Huis Bier (i.e. hospital beer). The area was extensively redeveloped in the 1930s and 1970s. A plaque for the brewery can be seen at . The figure of the old woman in F914 appears as a sketch in a letter to Theo of 3 March 1882, as a very fine signed drawing Old Woman Seen from Behind (right), as well as reappearing in Diggers in Torn-Up Street (below). The drawing of the bakery has been identified as one of the series of twelve that Uncle Cor commissioned. Naifeh and Smith believe it had been made, along with a number of others in the series, before receiving the commission and not actually in response to the commission. The torn-up street (F930a below) was at 15-17 Noordstraat, next to the bakery. There is a sketch of some figures enclosed with a letter to Theo of 23 April 1882 that are incorporated in the drawing and for this reason the drawing is dated as April 1882 in the catalogue raisonn√©s. But Naifeh and Smith believe the drawing was made earlier, pointing to the clumsiness of execution, the disassociation of the figures and their lack of proportion. Hulsker suggests the letter sketch was sent in response to criticism from Tersteeg: Hulsker called the signed drawing The Public Soup Kitchen (F1020a below) important and attractive.Hulsker (1980) pp.76-8 Van Gogh and Breitner had sketched together at a soup kitchen in the Geest (it is not known which of several possibilities it was). After going to the trouble and expense of installing shutters in his windows to adjust the light and to recreate the scene itself in his studio, van Gogh was able to study his models at leisure.Naifeh and Smith pp. 328-9 In this way he was able to introduce more chiaroscuro (light and dark) in his drawing, which he executed with natural ('mountain') chalk that Theo had sent him and whose properties he lauds in his letters. All the models are from Sien's family: her mother and baby are on the left; her sister, back turned to us, and her daughter, hair cropped as a precaution against lice, in the center; and Sien herself, superbly executed in profile, on the right.Zemel (1997), p. 46 The watercolor F1020b (top left) is much less successful as van Gogh himself acknowledged, blaming the paper in part for not being right for the job.

Van Gogh abandoned his initial efforts at oil painting (left) in January 1882 because he did not feel confident enough in his drawing technique. However Theo was anxious van Gogh should start producing saleable work, and following a visit from Theo in August 1882, encouraging him and giving him the money to buy paints and equipment, van Gogh took it up again. He chose his initial subjects from the woods near him, the Haagse Bos, and from the dunes and beaches at Scheveningen, The Hague. These initial studies were all on made on paper pinned to a drawing board because stretching a canvas was too expensive, although some were subsequently mounted on canvas.Hulsker (1980) pp. 54-6 = Scheveningen =  Works   Letters  References Bibliography * de la Faille, Jacob-Baart.

Neurosci 15, 157-169 (2014) Although multiple neurons can receive a stimulus, only a subset of the neurons will induce the necessary plasticity for memory encoding. The selection of this subset of neurons is termed neuronal allocation. Similarly, multiple synapses can be activated by a given set of inputs, but specific mechanisms determine which synapses actually go on to encode the memory, and this process is referred to as synaptic allocation. Memory allocation was first discovered in the lateral amygdala by Sheena Josselyn and colleagues in Alcino J. Silva's laboratory. At the neuronal level, cells with higher levels of excitability (for example lower slow afterhyperpolarizationZhou, Y., Won, J., Karlsson, M. G., Zhou, M., Rogerson, T., Balaji, J., ... & Silva, A. J. (2009). CREB regulates excitability and the allocation of memory to subsets of neurons in the amygdala. Nature neuroscience, 12(11), 1438-1443.) are more likely to be recruited into a memory trace, and substantial evidence exists implicating the cellular transcription factor CREB (cyclic AMP responsive element-binding protein) in this process.Yiu, A. P. et al. Neurons Are Recruited to a Memory Trace Based on Relative Neuronal Excitability Immediately before Training. Neuron 83, 722-735 (2014) Certain synapses on recruited neurons are more likely to undergo an enhancement of synaptic strength (known as Long-term potentiation (LTP))Bliss, T. V., & Collingridge, G. L. (1993). A synaptic model of memory: long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. Nature, 361(6407), 31-39. and proposed mechanisms that might contribute to allocation at the synaptic level include synaptic tagging, capture, and synaptic clustering. Neuronal allocation Neuronal allocation is a phenomenon that accounts for how specific neurons in a network, and not others that receive similar input, are committed to storing a specific memory. =The role of CREB in neuronal allocation= Multiple intracellular signaling pathways activate CREB, promoting transcription and translation of target proteins that support long- term neuronal plasticity and allocation. The transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is a well-studied mechanism of neuronal memory allocation. Most studies to date use the amygdala as a model circuit, and fear-related memory traces in the amygdala are mediated by CREB expression in the individual neurons allocated to those memories.Han, J. H., Kushner, S. A., Yiu, A. P., Cole, C. J., Matynia, A., Brown, R. A., ... & Josselyn, S. A. (2007). Neuronal competition and selection during memory formation. science, 316(5823), 457-460.Han, J.

CREB modulates cellular processes that lead to neuronal allocation, particularly with regards to dendritic spine density and morphology.Sargin, D., Mercaldo, V., Yiu, A. P., Higgs, G., Han, J. H., Frankland, P. W., & Josselyn, S. A. (2013). CREB regulates spine density of lateral amygdala neurons: implications for memory allocation. Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience, 7. Many of the memory mechanisms studied to date are conserved across different brain regions, and it is likely that the mechanisms of fear-based memory allocation found in the amygdala will also be similarly present for other types of memories throughout different brain regions. Indeed, Sano and colleagues in the Silva lab showed that CREB also regulates neuronal memory allocation in the amygdala.Sano, Y, Shobe, JL, Zhou, M, Huang, S, Cai, DJ, Roth, BL, Kamata, M, and Silva, AJ. CREB regulates memory allocation in the insular cortex. Curr Biol. 2014 Nov 13;24(23):2833-283 (2014) CREB may be activated by multiple pathways. For example, the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA) pathways appear to participate in neuronal allocation. When activated by the second messengers such as cAMP and calcium ions, enzymes such as PKA and MAP kinase can translocate to the nucleus and phosphorylate CREB to initiate transcription of target genes.Adams, J. P., & Sweatt, J. D. (2002). Molecular psychology: roles for the ERK MAP kinase cascade in memory. Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology, 42(1), 135-163.Treisman, R. (1996). Regulation of transcription by MAP kinase cascades. Current Opinion in Cell Biology, 8(2), 205-215. PKA inhibitors can block the development of long- lasting LTP, and this is accompanied by a reduction in the transcription of genes modulated by the CREB protein.Nguyen, P. V., & Woo, N. H. (2003). Regulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases. Progress in Neurobiology,71(6), 401-437. =Metaplasticity in neuronal allocation= Metaplasticity is a term describing the likelihood that a given stimulus will induce neuronal plasticity, based on the previous activity experienced by that neuron. Several studies provide evidence that neurons receiving ‚Äúpriming activity‚Äù (such as neurotransmitters, paracrine signals, or hormones) minutes to days prior will show a lower threshold for induction of long term potentiation (LTP).Goussakov, I. V., Fink, K., Elger, C. E., & Beck, H. (2000). Metaplasticity of mossy fiber synaptic transmission involves altered release probability. The Journal of Neuroscience, 20(9), 3434-3441.Abraham, W.

Other studies find that activation of NMDARs can also raise the stimulation threshold for induction of LTP. Thus, similar inputs on groups of neurons may induce LTP in some but not others based on prior activity of those neurons.Rudy, J. (2014). Specific mechanisms: Targeting plasticity products.

Synaptic allocation Synaptic allocation pertains to mechanisms that influence how synapses come to store a given memory. Intrinsic to the idea of synaptic allocation is the concept that multiple synapses can be activated by a given set of inputs, but specific mechanisms determine which synapses actually go on the encode the memory. Allocation of memories to specific synapses are key to determining where memories are stored. =Synaptic tagging and capture= A strong stimulus may produce both a tag on the synapse being stimulated and a genomic signaling cascade leading to the formation of plasticity products. The tag will then serve to capture these plasticity products. A weak signal on a nearby synapse may produce a tag but not a genomic signal. This tag can also serve to, capture plasticity products and strengthen the weakly-stimulated synapse. Synaptic activity can generate a synaptic tag, which is a marker that allows the stimulated spine to subsequently capture newly transcribed plasticity molecules such as Arc. Synaptic activity can also engage the translation and transcription machinery. Weak stimulation can create synaptic tags but will not engage the translation and transcription machinery, whereas strong stimulation will create synaptic tags and also engage the translation and transcription machinery. Newly generated plasticity-related proteins (PRPs) can be captured by any tagged synapses, but untagged synapses are not eligible to receive new PPs. After a certain time period, synapses will lose their tag and return to their initial state. Furthermore, the supply of new PRPs will deplete. The tags and new PRPs must overlap in time to capture the PRPs.Frey, U. & Morris, R. G. Synaptic tagging: implications for late maintenance of hippocampal long-term potentiation. Trends Neurosci. 21, 181‚Äì188 (1998)Govindarajan, A. et al. The dendritic branch is the preferred integrative unit for protein synthesis- dependent LTP. Neuron 69, 132‚Äì146 (2011). The synaptic tag is inversely related to time between inducing stimuli, and is said to be temporarily asymmetrical. Furthermore, the tagging is also inversely related to the distance between spines, an important spatial properties of tagging. Conversely confirming the temporal and spatial properties of the synaptic tagging, subsequent imaging studies revealed that there are not only temporal constraints but also structural constraints that limit synaptic tagging and capture mechanisms. Overall, these studies demonstrate the complexity of synaptic tagging and capture, and give further insight into how exactly this mechanism occurs. =Spine clustering= Synaptic clustering refers to the addition of new spines to a dendritic area where other spines have been added by previous learning. Spine clustering may result in the amplification of synaptic inputs via diffusible molecular crosstalk that occurs near activated spines.1 For example, studies have shown that signaling molecules synthesized at one spine, (e.g. activated RAS and/or RHOA), may diffuse out and influence spine growth at nearby sites.Harvey, C. D. et al. The spread of Ras activity triggered by activation of a single dendritic spine. Science 321, 136‚Äì140 (2008). The Rho GTPase CDC42 may also contribute to spine clustering by driving long-term spine volume increases. Recent studies also suggest that this process may be regulated by NMDA receptor activation and nitric oxide stimulation.Murakoshi, H., Wang, H. & Yasuda, R. Local, persistent activation of Rho GTPases during plasticity of single dendritic spines. Nature 472, 100‚Äì104 (2011) Spine clustering in the motor cortex reflects a morphological mechanism for synaptic storage of specific motor memories. These clustered spines are more stable than non-clustered new spines. This type of addition of spines occurs in a specific pattern, meaning that spines added after one task will not cluster with spines after an alternative task.Fu, M. et al. Repetitive motor learning induces coordinated formation of clustered dendritic spines in vivo. Nature 483, 92‚Äì95 (2012). Loss of spine clustering is also a possibility as shown in some fear conditioning experiments, leading to the net loss of spines in the frontal association cortex, a region strongly associated in fear conditioning, which strongly correlates with memory on recall. Once spines were added after fear extinction had a similar orientation to the spines lost during the original fear conditioning.Lai, C. S. et al. Opposite effects of fear conditioning and extinction on dendritic spine remodelling. Nature 483, 87‚Äì91 (2012). Mechanisms that link memories across time  Denise Cai in Alcino J. Silva's laboratory found that memory allocation mechanisms are used to connect or link memories across time.Cai DJ, Aharoni D, Shuman T, Shobe J, Biane J, Song W, Wei B, Veshkini M, La-Vu M, Lou J, Flores S, Kim I, Sano Y, Zhou M, Baumgaertel K, Lavi A, Kamata M, Tuszynski M, Mayford M, Golshani P, Silva AJ. A shared neural ensemble links distinct contextual memories encoded close in time. Nature 2016 May 23;534(7605):115-8 In their studies they demonstrated that one contextual memory triggers the activation of CREB and subsequent enhancements in excitability in a subset of hippocampal CA1 neurons, such that a subsequent contextual memory, occurring within 5 hours, can be allocated to some of the same CA1 neurons that stored the first contextual memory. As a consequence of this overlap between the CA1 memory engrams for the two contextual memories, recall of one contextual memory activates the retrieval of the second memory. These studies also showed that contextual memory linking mechanisms are disrupted in the aging brain, and that increasing excitability in a subset of CA1 neurons reverses these memory linking deficits. It is very likely that impairments in CREB and neuronal excitability in aging brains could account for abnormalities in memory linking and possibly related source memory problems (source amnesia) associated with aging. In July 2018, in a special issue about \\"13 Discoveries that Could Change Everything\\", Scientific American highlighted the Silva laboratory's discovery of Memory Allocation and Linking Silva, AJ How one memory attaches to another. In Revolutions in Science: Discoveries that could change everything. Scientific American; July 2018, Volume 27, Issue 3s Current and future research =Integrating synaptic and neuronal allocation= Experiments have yet to investigate the interaction of allocative mechanisms between the neuronal and synaptic levels. The two classes of processes are very likely to be interconnected considering the relationship between neurons and synapses in a neuronal network. For example, the synaptic tagging and capture involved in synaptic allocation requires the allocation of the neurons to which the synapses belong to. Moreover, increases in neuronal excitability in a given neuronal ensemble may affect some dendrites more than others, thus biasing memory storage to synapses in dendrites with higher excitability.Larkum, M. E. & Nevian, T. Synaptic clustering by dendritic signalling mechanisms. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 18, 321‚Äì331 (2008)Losonczy, A., Makara, J. K. & Magee, J. C. Compartmentalized dendritic plasticity and input feature storage in neurons. Nature 452, 436‚Äì441 (2008) Similarly, on the recruited neurons displaying increased excitability, specific synapses need to be selected for in order to store the information in the form of synaptic plasticity. One aspect of integration involves metaplasticity and how acquisition and storage of one memory changes the neural circuit to affect the storage and properties of a subsequent memory. Cellular excitability has been proposed as one of the mechanisms responsible for heterosynaptic metaplasticity, the modulation of subsequent plasticity at different synapses.Frick, A. & Johnston, D. Plasticity of dendritic excitability. J. Neurobiol. 64, 100‚Äì115 (2005) CREB functions through elevating cell excitability as described above, thus it is also possibly involved in hetrerosynaptic metaplasticity. Synaptic tagging and capture, as introduced in sections above, can result in a weak memory (capable of triggering only E-LTP), which would otherwise be forgotten, but it can be strengthened and stabilized by a strong memory (capable of triggering L-LTP), which is a form of heterosynaptic plasticity. =Future research= Despite extensive research into the individual mechanisms of memory allocation, there are few studies investigating the integration of these mechanisms. It has been proposed that understanding the implications of the molecular, cellular and systemic mechanisms of these processes may elucidate how they are coordinated and integrated during memory formation. For example, identifying the plasticity-related proteins (PRPs) involved in synaptic tagging and capture as well as the upstream and downstream molecules of CREB can help reveal potential interactions. Investigating the functional significance of these mechanisms will require tools that can directly manipulate and image the processes involved in the proposed mechanisms in vivo. For instance, it is possible that the behavioral interactions ascribed to synaptic tagging and capture are caused by protein synthesis-dependent increases in neuromodulators such as dopamine rather than by synaptic tagging mechanisms. Examining the behavioral effects under direct manipulation can help rule out these other possible causes.

The project was popular enough that they extended it for five more years. During this time they shared stage with such famous artists as Donna Summer, Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Barry White, Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra, Jerry Lewis, Whitney Houston, and Kool and the Gang. The group toured internationally in Japan, Mexico, Argentina, Peru and the United States.

Duarte recorded original, highly syncopated timba tumbaos (piano guajeos) with tinges of Classical music. Moore recalls testing Duarte‚Äôs ability to spontaneously create a tumbao based on a Classical piece: ‚ÄúI asked him to play a classical piano piece. He played part of Chopin's ‚ÄúFantasie Impromptu in C#mi.‚Äù I then asked him to improvise on it in a timba style. Within ten minutes he had worked it into a piano tumbao and added a bassline.Moore, Kevin (2013: web). \\" The Piano Style of Tirso Duarte\\" Timba.com On \\"Charanguero mayor,\\" Duarte references classical piano music, and employs extreme harmonic displacement. The following ten elements are found in Durate's variants of the \\"Charanguero mayor\\" piano tumbao, identifying it as timba: 1. song-specific hook 2. increased length 3. contrasting gestures 4. busy left hand 5. consecutively repeated notes 6. contrary and oblique motion 7. grace note rolls 8. notes clusters and jazz voicings 9. harmonic anticipation and displacement 10. cross-rhythm. Moore: \\"This tumbao is not only drastically different from the salsa formula‚Äîit‚Äôs also very different from other timba tumbaos, from other timba tumbaos by Tirso, and even from other timba tumbaos in this same song.\\"Moore, Kevin (2013: 33) Beyond Salsa Piano v.14; The Cuban Timba Revolution. Tirso Duarte Part 1. Charanga Habanera Piano Tumbaos.. The next piano tumbao uses cluster chords. it is also unusual in that Duarte leaves out the F natural from the previous variant. Duarte displays a preference for this type of harmonic tension. He changes chords earlier than anticipated or extends them further. His tumbaos eventually return to a familiar opening phrase and reestablish the harmonic equilibrium. Yuli√©n Oviedo, a 15-year-old prodigy and son of Calixto Oviedo of NG La Banda, took over on timbales. The Mengual brothers, Orlandito and L√°zaro (from Pacho Alonso) took over conga and bongo duties. The young jazz pianist Helder Rojas took over the synthesizer chair. Randolf Chac√≥n (formerly with Bamboleo) became the new bassist. The new horn section consists of Osmani Collado, Yunior Romero (also from Bamboleo), Juan Manuel Jim√©nez (from Rojitas), and Carmelo \\"El abuelo\\" Andr√©s. Carmelo is the consummate professional trumpeter and had already had a long and successful career with Paulito y su √âlite and Rojitas. Michel Maza was joined by Aned Mota and Noel D√≠az on vocals. This new incarnation of the group consisted of some of the best young musical talent in Cuba.Moore (2011: web) Timba.com.

Groff was a highly decorated veteran of World War I, earning the Navy Cross, Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star, and Purple Heart medals. He also participated in the Banana Wars (in Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Nicaragua), and World War II. At the time of his death in 1990 at age 100, BG Groff was the oldest surviving general officer in the Marine Corps.  Early life  Groff was born February 14, 1890 in Syracuse, New York. He attended public school in Syracuse from 1897 to 1904 and in West Chester, Pennsylvania from 1905 to 1908. Prior to enlisting in the Marine Corps, he worked as a sailmaker in Wilmington, Delaware.  Early career: Mexico and Haiti  Groff enlisted in the Marine Corps on October 9, 1912 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Following initial training and a brief two-month stint at Camp Meyer, Cuba in 1913, Groff was assigned to the 46th Company, Special Service Squadron, which sailed for Mexico in April 1914 on board the USS New York (BB-34). While the New York arrived too late to take part in the actual Battle of Veracruz, Groff participated in the United States occupation of Veracruz from May‚ÄìJune 1914. He spent most of the remainder of the year as a gun striker with the 46th Co., 5th Marine Regiment on board the USS Hancock (AP-3) near Santo Domingo City, Dominican Republic. In 1915, Haiti was rocked by revolutions, which had begun the previous year. By then, Groff was a member of the Marine Detachment on board the USS Washington (ACR-11). He participated in the initial landing force engagement at Port-au-Prince on July 28, 1915. For the remainder of the year, Groff was temporarily assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment for garrison and occupation duty in the city. Groff, then a Corporal, returned to the United States in early 1916, where he became a plankowner on the USS Oklahoma (BB-37).  World War I  At the outbreak of World War I, Groff's experience in the Banana Wars led to his rapid promotion from Corporal to Sergeant and then Gunnery Sergeant. He sailed for France as a member of the 83rd Company, 6th Marine Regiment, which was part of the 2nd Division, American Expeditionary Force. Groff was wounded in action (minor gunshot) and was cited for gallantry on multiple occasions during the Battle of Belleau Wood in June 1918. For his actions, he was awarded the Navy Cross, Distinguished Service Cross, and Silver Star citation. As the result of his heroics, Groff also received a battlefield promotion to 2nd Lieutenant in July 1918. After being commissioned as an officer, he was subsequently assigned to the 97th Company, 6th Marines, where he remained until the end of the war. His official World War I Victory Medal campaign credits include Aisne, Aisne-Marne, Meuse-Argonne, and Defensive Sector. Following the cessation of hostilities in November 1918, Groff stayed in Germany until April 1919 as part of the United States Third Army's occupation forces. = Navy Cross citation = \\"The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Gunnery Sergeant John Groff (MCSN: 99252), United States Marine Corps, for extraordinary heroism while serving with the 83d Company, 6th Regiment (Marines), 2d Division, A.E.F. in action in the Bois-de-Belleau, France, on 6 June 1918.

He rejoined the Marine Corps in April 1921 and accepted a permanent commission as a first lieutenant. Shortly thereafter, he was promoted to captain on July 25, 1921 and assigned to Headquarters Company, 10th Marine Regiment, where he served as the signal officer and HQ company commander. In March 1924, Groff returned to Haiti as the commanding officer of the 148th Company, 8th Marine Regiment, 1st Brigade. He remained in and around Port-au-Prince until February 1926, serving in various units, including Post Headquarters and 36th Company, 1st Brigade, and Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Marine Regiment. Upon returning to the United States in March 1926, Captain Groff was assigned to Headquarters Company, 5th Marine Regiment in Quantico, Virginia. When the 5th Marines deployed to Nicaragua in January 1927, Groff served as battalion executive officer until July 1927. For his service in Nicaragua, Groff received an official commendation from the commanding general of 2nd Brigade, USMC. Groff served at the Marine Barracks, Lakehurst Naval Air Station, New Jersey from August 1927 to May 1929. In July 1929, he returned to Port-au-Prince, Haiti as the Officer-in-Charge Naval Radio Station and Signal Officer of the Brigade Signal Company, 1st Brigade, a duty he retained until May 1931. After serving several months at the Marine Corps Headquarters in Washington, D.C. and at the Army Quartermaster Subsistence School in Chicago, Illinois, Groff was assigned as the post communications officer, 1st Signal Company, Marine Barracks, at Quantico, Virginia in October 1932. He served in that capacity until August 1936. In July 1937, Groff, then a major, was transferred to Headquarters Company, Fleet Marine Force, Marine Barracks, San Diego, California, where he served as the fleet communication officer until May 1939.  World War II  Despite requesting overseas duty, Groff remained in the United States for the duration of World War II. In June 1939, he took command of the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego, California. Additional duties included being the Officer- in-Charge of Drills and Instructions. While the commanding officer of the Recruit Depot, Groff innovated new techniques for improving the efficiency and morale of his new recruits. In October 1939, Groff originated an \\"Honor Man\\" plan to promote competition among recruits. Each platoon had one squad leader selected as demonstrating leadership and cooperation. The most competent recruit in each platoon was awarded a special badge. Likewise, in 1941, he experimented with organizing platoons based on recruits' blood types to potentially facilitate blood transfusions at advanced dressing stations. From December 1944 to November 1945, Groff served as chief of staff assigned to Headquarters Company, Base Headquarters Battalion, Marine Corps Base, San Diego. Colonel Groff was promoted to the rank of brigadier general on March 1, 1946, and retired shortly thereafter. = Navy Commendation citation = For his service during World War II, Groff was awarded the Navy Commendation Ribbon (later Navy Commendation Medal). \\"The Secretary of the Navy takes pleasure in commending COLONEL JOHN GROFF, UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS for service as set forth in the following CITATION: For meritorious service while attached to Marine Corps Base, San Diego, California, as Commanding Officer, Recruit Depot, from June to December 1944, and as Chief of Staff to the Commanding General from December 1944 to November 1945. Colonel Groff, by his tireless efforts, contributed greatly to the war effort by his supervision of the highly important task of training thousands of recruits. As Chief of Staff, by his superior knowledge of administrative affairs and devotion to duty, he successfully coordinated training and numerous other important activities on this large base. His initiative and outstanding performance of duty throughout this period have been in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\\"  Later life and death  Following his retirement from the Marine Corps in 1946, General Groff worked as a civilian for the Hughes Aircraft Company and the Douglas Aircraft Company before finally retiring in 1953. Groff died of a heart attack in Oceanside, California on October 2, 1990 at the age of 100. He is interred at Riverside National Cemetery.

This episode originally aired on ABC on April 18, 2012. It was written by Dan O'Shannon, Paul Corrigan & Brad Walsh and directed by Michael Spiller. Plot Claire (Julie Bowen) and Phil (Ty Burrell) do not know how to tell Luke (Nolan Gould) that their elder neighbor Walt, who Luke became close friends with, died. When they finally do, Claire is worried about Luke because he does not show any emotional reaction to the news while Phil worries about Claire's reaction; every time she said that Walt died, she smiled. When Phil mentions that to her she changes the subject to Luke's reaction for which both get more worried when they see Luke stealing Walt's TV from his house. Claire tries to talk to Luke using the TV as a way to get emotion from Luke over Walt's passing but she fails and she asks him to take it back. Whilst returning the television she sees Luke looking sadly across the lawn at his room and he somberly tells his mom that he would see the TV light on at the house and confirm that Walt was OK. Claire then lets him keep the TV and calls Phil to say Luke is doing just fine. Haley (Sarah Hyland) wants to throw a party in Jay (Ed O'Neill) and Gloria's (Sof√≠a Vergara) house without permission so she tells Gloria that a responsible relative will be the chaperone and to Claire that her \\"uncle\\" will be a chaperone. Claire believes she talks about Mitch (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) but she talks about Manny (Rico Rodriguez). Manny is aghast at the activities that Haley's friends are getting up to. When Gloria comes home, she is equally angry at Haley for throwing the party and Manny for not having any fun; she then punishes Haley by making her continue with the party as Manny sets out to have immature fun as his mom wanted. Phil realizes that Walt never fixed his estrangement from his daughter and he decides that he does not want the same thing to happen with himself and Alex (Ariel Winter), so he sets out with her for some great stories to replace the empty gallery of Phil-Alex moments. All his attempts to create something special (he even tries to get a woman in labor so they can help her deliver since no one else is around to do it) fail and when Alex asks him why he is acting so weird, he tells her that he just wants to create a special memory for her. Alex tells him she will always remember how her dad spent the entire day trying to create a memory for her. Meanwhile, Cam's father Merle (Barry Corbin) visits and Mitch and Cam (Eric Stonestreet) invite Jay for dinner, as the two never really bonded. Jay tries to avoid the dinner pretending to be sick but Mitch forces him to come along and make an effort. At the same time, Cam is forced to tell his father to do the same with Jay, as he does not like him either. Over dinner, the two men clash, with Jay hating the fact that Merle treats Mitchell like the woman in the relationship. Jay and Merle eventually talk and realize that they both try and treat their son's partner as the woman in a relationship because it makes them feel better. They finally come together and agree that they just have to accept the fact that their sons are gay and happy together.

Merle is the complete opposite of Cam, which makes the character so much more enjoyable to watch. However, there is a part of the 2 men that is very similar; perhaps it‚Äôs their farming background? Who knows? Either way, Merle and his gruffness was a great addition to the show this week.\\" Jules of Two Cents TV gave a good review to the episode saying: \\"I really enjoyed Phil‚Äôs story of trying to have that special day with Alex. Claire smiling as a coping mechanism was strange, but if anyone were to have something strange like that, it would be Claire. And Mr. Corbin as Cam‚Äôs dad was great!\\" Leigh Raines of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 3.5/5. She liked the moments of most characters, one being Manny's small but rather memorable role. She stated \\"Manny had a minor storyline but it happened to be my favorite of the night.\\" One of the moments she didn't enjoy was with Merle Tucker, Cam's father. \\"'The Last Walt' was an episode with a couple of different storylines running, unfortunately the dinner with Cam's dad was probably my least favorite.\\" Christine N. Ziemba of Paste Magazine gave the episode 6.8/10. She praised the storyline between Jay and Cameron's father and hailed Mitchell's line regarding cities and farms as the best of the night, remarking that it \\"was the funniest line of the night‚Äîbut unfortunately, it didn't have much competition in 'The Last Walt'.\\" Donna Bowman from The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+ rate saying that the episode was \\"overstuffed\\". \\"Too bad it has to elbow for room with so many other ideas and characters in far-flung storylines. Sometimes when you overstuff an episode, you end up with less than the sum of the parts. That‚Äôs a shame when some of the parts are really good, and others could have been, with more time and a bigger spotlight.\\" References External links  *\\"The Last Walt\\" at ABC.com Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Modern Family (season 3) episodes ","title":"The Last Walt"},{"id":"35502428","text":"This is a list of current festivals held within the Canadian province of Ontario, Canada.

Both of these lines are considered to be highly collectible. The company actively produced pottery from 1937 to 1961 from its location in Zanesville, Ohio. Predecessors The predecessor company to Shawnee Pottery was the American Encaustic Tiling Company. The main product produced by American Encaustic was the manufacture of tiles which required a two-step process. The process involves firing of the clay and then the glaze. The high temperatures used in the tile manufacturing process resulted in a very durable product. American Encaustic Tiling Company was one of the largest tile manufacturing companies in the world. The building housing the American Encaustic Tiling Company was located at 2200 Linden Avenue in Zanesville, Ohio. It was built in 1891 and cost approximately a million dollars. Governor William McKinley dedicated the new building on April 19, 1892. Also Shane Macdonald was part owner of Shawnee Pottery in 1893. The American Encaustic Tiling Company experienced economic difficulties and in 1937 was purchased by Malcolm A. Schweiker and his brother Roy W. Schweiker. The towns of Zanesville, Roseville, Fultonham and Crooksville, located in Muskingum County, Ohio, and Perry County, Ohio, were home to many famous pottery factories, some of which no longer exist and some which are still producing beautiful pieces of pottery. Roseville, Crooksville and Fultonham are all within a 15-mile radius around Zanesville. The Zanesville area was known as the largest pottery-producing region in the country. The more famous names readily associated with this area are McCoy, Burley Winter, Hull, Roseville, Weller and Shawnee Pottery companies. Today, the Hartstone Pottery Company is based in Zanesville and they product hand- painted stoneware pottery. History In 1937 Shawnee Pottery began operations in the former American Encaustic facility in Zanesville, Ohio. Arrowheads found in the area, in conjunction with the heritage of local Shawnee Native Americans, inspired Louise Bauer, who was an in-house designer for this new company, to develop a logo with an arrowhead and profile of a Shawnee Indian Head. The Shawnee Pottery company operated from 1937 through 1961. After the new logo was finalized, the company then became known as Shawnee Pottery. Production under this new company name began in August 1937. The first products were primarily decorative items like figurines, cookie jars and vases which could be found in \\"five and dime\\" stores, such as F.W. Woolworth Company, S.S. Kresge and McCrory Stores. Shortly after production began in 1937, Sears Roebuck and Company asked the Shawnee Pottery Company to design a line of dinnerware known as Valencia, and a line of kitchenware exclusively for their stores. World War II had its effect on Shawnee Pottery. The Army Air Force had contracts with Shawnee Pottery company from 1942 to 1946 which provided Shawnee with 90% of its production. During this period, ceramic designer Robert Heckman joined the company. Products The decorative items produced by Shawnee Pottery from 1937 to 1942 were manufactured in a two-step process, or two-fire process. The greenware (unfired clay) received its first firing. A china underglaze was applied to the pottery. After that paint was applied. This application of paint over the glaze is referred to as cold paint. Due to the age of the pottery, it is not uncommon to notice that the paint has deteriorated greatly over time. Two of the most popular lines ever produced by Shawnee Pottery are the Pennsylvania Dutch line and the Corn King line. These two lines of pottery were produced by the two-fire method which resulted in a very durable product. Shawnee's products are still popular with pottery collectors. Their best known product lines include \\"pig\\" cookie jars and the Corn King line of dinnerware.

It has changed location several times during its history, but has been based at Killermont in Bearsden since 21 May 1904. The Club is unusual in also having a links course, at Gailes, near Irvine, on the Ayrshire coast, some 35 miles away. History Georgian neoclassical style club house of Glasgow Golf Club, built 1805. The club was founded in May 1787, the first golf club in the west of Scotland, and now the ninth oldest golf club in the world. It was first established at Glasgow Green by 22 men, wealthy merchants and army officers, who would have obtained a permit for the playing of golf in this public space from the town council. The club met here between 1787 and 1794, at which point, active military service in the Napoleonic Wars reduced the number of available players below practical levels. Golf playing recommenced in 1809 and remained at Glasgow Green until 1835 despite some municipal drainage works making the location somewhat unpleasant for leisure activities. In 1870, the club started to expand, initially at Queen's Park, but moving just four years later to Alexandra Park. There was one further move to Blackhill (in 1895) before the current course at Killermont was secured for private play. It was during this phase of the club's history that the Gailes Links, Irvine, Ayrshire were opened (19 May 1892). The Killermont course is based in the grounds of the B-listed Georgian neoclassical style Killermont House, built in 1805 by the Campbell-Colquhoun family. It was leased for a 20-year period by Glasgow Golf Club in the autumn of 1903, and a permanent tenancy was agreed in 1922. A similar arrangement with the Colquhoun family is in place with Loch Lomond Golf Club, which has occupied Rossdhu Mansion and the accompanying grounds at Luss since 1993. In 1924 the land on which the Gailes Links course lies was bought from the Duke of Portland. The Killermont course doesn‚Äôt encourage visitors (except for member's guests), but it is possible to play as a visitor on the Gailes course. Course details Glasgow Gailes golf course.

Other customs also were seen.Mito[1972:228-230] This was reported in a paper by Masao Kawai and this phenomenon was reported at a congress in USSR, but Russian investigators thought that humans must have trained the monkeys.Mito[1984:49]  Influence  Crown Prince Naruhito read one of the books of Mito and she was called to their house and chatted about the monkeys with the family of Akihito, on two occasions.Shiraishi[1994:192-194] Masaru Ibuka was also interested in monkeys and lead a group of presidents who were born in 1908, or the year of the Monkey, to K≈çjima.Shiraishi[1994:240-242]  References   Bibliography  *Satsue Mito, Monkeys and I, with their family in Koshima, 1972, Kodansha, Tokyo *Satsue Mito, Monkeys in Koshima1984, Popura sha, *Satsue Mito, My grandchildren are Koshima's 100 monkeys 1989, Gakushu Kenkyusha *Katsuaki Shiraishi, Kind and strong, What Satsue Mito told me 1994, Honda Kikaku, Takaokacho, Miyazaki Prefecture. *Keizo Shibusawa, Inumo Arukeba Boni Ataru(Good luck may come unexpectedly) 1961, Kadokawa Shoten Category:Miyazaki Prefecture Category:Japanese zoologists Category:1914 births Category:2012 deaths ","title":"Satsue Mito"},{"id":"35502546","text":"Glyphipterix circumscriptella is a species of sedge moth in the genus Glyphipterix.

Kinesthesis is the learning of movements that an individual commonly performs. The individual must repeat the motions that they are trying to learn and perfect many times for this to happen. Many people say that kinesthesis is muscle memory but it is not true because your muscles can't actually remember anything, it is the proprioceptors giving the information from your muscles to your brain. To do this, the individual must have a sense of the position of their body and how that changes throughout the motor skill they are trying to perform. While performing the motion the body will use receptors in the muscles to transfer information to the brain to tell the brain about what the body is doing. Then after completing the same motor skill numerous times, the brain will begin to remember the motion based on the position of the body at a given time. Then after learning the motion the body will be able perform the motor skill even when usual senses are inhibited, such as the person closing their eyes. The body will perform the motion based on the information that is stored in the brain from previous attempts at the same movement. This is possible because the brain has formed connections between the location of body parts in space (the body uses perception to learn where their body is in space) and the subsequent movements that commonly follow these positions. It becomes almost an instinct. The person does not need to even think about what they are doing to perfect the skill, they have done it so many times that it feels natural and requires little to no thought. When the kinesthetic system has learned a motor skill proficiently, it will be able to work even when ones vision is limited. The perception of continuous movement (kinesthesia) is largely unconscious. A conscious proprioception is achieved through increased awareness. Kinaesthetics involves the teaching and personal development of such awareness. Therapeutic applications Occupational therapy and physical therapy based on movement-associated awareness has been applied in the Western world since the mid-1980s, especially in Central European care facilities. It makes use of the psychophysiological finding that greater muscle tone reduces proprioceptive sensitivity. Kinaesthetics may benefit patients who need: *Assistance in activities of daily living (ADL) *Somatic feedback *To reduce the physical effort required to move Daily Life applications The kinesthetic system is important with performing many motor skills, one being driving a car. If the body could not instantly remember what to do, driving would be very dangerous. When first starting to drive, all new drivers lack this ability to quickly respond because they have never been in situations like this before. The more they drive and are faced with similar situations, the more they get used to how to react and the more it becomes an instinct. By everyone knowing what they are doing when it comes to turning and stopping, it makes driving on the road safer. People can focus on what is in front of them in case their environment suddenly changes instead of focusing on how to turn the wheel or press on the brakes. History Kinaesthetics-founders Lenny Maietta and Frank Hatch (2011)Kinaesthetics was developed in the early 1970s by Frank White Hatch, who was a choreographer and dancer. Hatch studied behavioral cybernetics at Madison/Wisconsin and developed academic programs for movement and dance called Kinaesthetics in three American universities.Hatch, F. W. (1973): A behavioral cybernetic interpretation of dance and dance culture. Madison, University of Wisconsin, Thesis. He then turned to working with disabled children as well as the field of rehabilitation. Psychologist Lenny Maietta (1950-2018) developed a handling training program for young parents that was also based on behavioral cybernetics.Maietta, L. (1986): The effects of handling training on parent-infant interaction and infant development. Santa Barbara, The fielding institute, Thesis. Hatch and Maietta taught and worked together in German-speaking countries beginning in 1974. With the dancer John Graham, they held workshops under the name of Gentle Dance. Maietta and Hatch used Kinaesthetics seminars the first time as therapy in the Ernest-Holmes Fachklinik in Germany 1974-77. Together with registered nurse Suzanne Bernard Schmidt, Maietta and Hatch developed a job-specific program \\"Kinaesthetics in Nursing.\\" They were in dialogue and exchange with Gregory Bateson, Moshe Feldenkrais, Berta and Karel Bobath, Liliane Juchli, and Nancy Roper. In addition to behavioral cybernetics and dance, movement therapy and humanistic psychology were named as key sources of kinaesthetics. Maietta and Hatch are still actively involved in the development of Kinaesthetics. In the last years, programs for caregivers, for workplace health and for older people especially were developed. Currently there are four organizations in which Kinaesthetics programs are developed. Literature   * Films * Asmussen-Clausen, M. / Knobel, S.

He has been artist in residence at Cit√© International Des Arts, Paris, France, at Chateau de La Napoule, La Napoule, France and at Eklisia, G√ºm√ºsl√ºk, Turkey (1994). Background At the University of California, Irvine (UCI), Hill studied with Ed Moses, Billy Al Bengston, and Vija Celmins, with classmates Chris Burden, Alexis Smith, Ned Evans, and Richard Newton. He earned an MFA degree from UCI in 1973.Kook- Anderson, Grace: Best Kept Secret, UCI and the Development of Contemporary Art in Southern California 1964-1971, a Pacific Standard Time exhibition, Laguna Museum of Art, Laguna, California. Early work For Connie by Charles Christopher Hill, 1974, Honolulu Museum of Art Hill had his first solo exhibitions in 1972 at Newspace Gallery and at Jack Glenn Gallery, both in Newport Beach, California, and has since established himself as a Southern California painter. Hill has had solo exhibitions worldwide including exhibitions at the Galerie Krebs and the Galerie Maurer in Switzerland, at the Richard Demarco Gallery in Scotland; at the Galleria Del Cavalinoi in Italy; at the Galerie Baudoin Lebon in Paris; at the Rocket Gallery in London, and throughout the United States. Describing Hill's early works from the 1970s in the Los Angeles Times, critic Sharon Mizota writes that the works are \\"large, torn paper collages shot through with stitching. With their vibrant hues, and rough, distressed surfaces, they are at once sublime and down-home, flickering somewhere between Color Field painting and well-loved, homemade quilts.\\"Mizota, Sharon, \\"Charles Christopher Hill's new stripe paintings intrigue,\\" Los Angeles Times, August 16, 2012 Susan C. Larsen, writing about Hill's earlier newspaper-based work in ARTnews describes:\\"work [that] presents crumbling, brightly colored, sensuous layers of weathered paper and canvas, which have been pasted and sewn together and then weathered, buried in the ground, soaked and otherwise endangered and enriched by processes of decay.\\"Larsen, Susan C: \\"Inside Jobs\\", Art News, vol. 77 no.1, January, 1978, pp 110-114. Colin Gardner writes in February 1987, of Hill's transition to more formal painting: \\"the artist has dabbled in paint and introduced a trademark vocabulary of crosses, X-shapes, fragmented checkerboards and grid patterns alluding to mathematical systems, patchwork quilts and modernist formalism.\\"Gardner, Colin: \\"Downtown,\\" Los Angeles Times, February 6, 1987. For Connie, from 1974, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art is an example of Hill's early collages. It is made from paper, pigment, thread, dirt and gold leaf.

Hill paints bands across the canvas with perhaps fifty layers. He uses a full color palette with a final application of red or black; between each layer of paint he applies an acrylic varnish. > The built-up layers of the two acrylic materials (the varnish and the paint) > create a saturated, lustrous, glossy surface.

The episode was directed by Jay Sandrich and written by Earl Pomerantz. \\"Goodbye Mr. Fish\\" originally aired in the United States on NBC on Thursday September 27, 1984, at 8:00 PM Eastern time. The episode focuses on the death of Rudy's pet goldfish, which was difficult to explain to her and difficult for her to deal with. The episode was a critical and commercial success, achieving both high ratings and positive critical feedback. Its viewer ratings placed it third for the opening week of the 1984‚Äì85 United States network television season and it earned Primetime Emmy Award and Writers Guild Award nominations for its writing. Several critics either describe this as the most memorable episode of the series or mention it first when describing the series' memorable episodes. Other critics as well as Bill Cosby include it on short lists of series highlights. Clips of this episode are included in the season 4 two-part \\"Looking Back\\" episode. Plot Cliff (Bill Cosby) comes home from a long day at work and tries to take a nap. Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe) disturbs him to say that Rudy's (Keshia Knight Pulliam) goldfish, Lamont, has died, but she does not realize it yet. They have a hard time explaining to Rudy what has happened. Once they do, Rudy becomes depressed. Later that day, the older kids start making fun of Lamont's death, Theo saying they should hold a memorial service for the fish around the family toilet. When Cliff feels that the rest of the family is insensitive to Rudy's loss, he requires the entire family to participate in a memorial service for Lamont in the bathroom in proper funeral attire. Rudy loses interest in the funeral and leaves to watch television, ending the ceremony abruptly. She later returns to the bathroom and asks for privacy, not because she wants to say goodbye to Lamont as Cliff thinks, but because she needs to use the toilet. Cast *Bill Cosby as Cliff Huxtable *Phylicia Ayers-Allen as Clair Huxtable *Malcolm-Jamal Warner as Theo Huxtable *Keshia Knight Pulliam as Rudy Huxtable *Tempestt Bledsoe as Vanessa Huxtable *Lisa Bonet as Denise Huxtable Production This was first episode taped and produced for the show, on August 1, 1984, following the \\"Pilot\\" taped much earlier in May 1984. The show originated at the NBC studio in Brooklyn before a live studio audience with six different sets: a living room, a master bedroom, a kitchen, a child's bedroom, a hallway, and a bathroom. The taping endured so many retakes that it took three times as long as was scheduled. The set used was notably different from the one used during the pilot. In the first episode, the first floor has extra rooms that it does not have in the rest of the series, beginning with this episode. As of 1987, this was one of the few sitcom episodes that showed the bathroom, according to Patricia Leigh Brown of The New York Times. Reception In 2009, TV Guide created TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time, with this episode ranked number 15. Earl Pomerantz was nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay - Episodic Comedy and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for this episode. The episode was also nominated for an Emmy in the category of Outstanding Live and Tape Sound Mixing and Sound Effects for a Series. The episode finished third in the Nielsen Media Research ratings for the week with a 19.1 million person viewership and a 22.5 share for the week ending September 30 behind Dallas (22.4 million) and Falcon Crest (19.8 million). This followed a first-place ranking for the \\"Pilot\\" the week before. This was the first episode of the series to air after the September 24 date that marked the official beginning of the 1984‚Äì85 United States network television season. David Hinckley of the Daily News describes Rudy as \\"impossibly cute\\" in this episode. Producer Marcy Carsey considered the episode to be an example of how the series dealt with the \\"reactions to small-scale events\\". According to Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly, this is considered by many to be the most memorable episode of the series. Other critics consider it to be among the highlights of the series including Allison Samuels of Newsweek who remembered Cosby for two performances in the series in which he \\"hid his potato-chip habit from his wife and delivered a deadpan eulogy as he flushed his daughter's goldfish down the toilet\\". William Raspberry of The Washington Post and Graham Jefferson of USA Today considered the episode to be a highlight of the series. Cosby was quoted in Ebony as counting the episode on the short list of highlights from the series. This was the first episode mentioned by several writers discussing the series, including Renee Graham of the Boston Globe, Matt Roush of USA Today (in 1987 after the first 81 episodes), and Candace Murphy of the Oakland Tribune. In the fourth season two-part November 12, 1987 \\"Looking Back\\" episode, the family tries to help the newlywed Sondra Huxtable and Elvin reconcile after their first fight. The episode recounts highlights of the first 81 episodes to help Elvin understand Sondra and her family and this episode is highlighted. According to TBS, the following lines in the funeral part of the script were among the most memorable in the entire series: :Cliff: \\"We're here to say goodbye to a cherished friend: Lamont, the goldfish.\\" :Vanessa: \\"I always felt safe with him around.\\" Notes External links \\"Goodbye Mr. Fish\\" at TV.com Category:The Cosby Show Category:1984 American television episodes Category:Fish in popular culture Category:Television episodes about funerals ","title":"Goodbye Mr. Fish"},{"id":"35502868","text":"Springerichthys bapturus, known commonly as the Japanese blacktail triplefin, is a species of triplefin blenny in the genus Springerichthys.

The Nehalem River flows through the town. Settled in 1876 by William Johnston, a man who would be responsible for the town's first post office and church, Vesper borders Jewell and the Columbia County line. Johnston also served as the town's first postmaster. Before 1901, Vesper was completely isolated from the rest of the county on land; for one to reach the community, it would have been necessary to travel via ferry on the Nehalem River. The county expanded wagon roads to the community, eventually leading to automobile roads being built in 1908. Nowadays, Oregon Route 202 passes through Vesper. History =Founding and name= Vesper was settled by William Johnston in 1876 with his family, who were from Ireland. The name Vesper is commonly applied to Hesperus, Greek mythology's personification for the planet Venus. The reason Johnston selected the name is unknown. Johnston established the first post office in Vesper during the Winter of 1879. He also served as the town's first postmaster. By 1895, E. A. Carl had taken over the reins as postmaster. Another contribution to the Vesper community by Johnston was the town's first church, which he built with his family. Lumber for the church was supplied by the local Douglas-fir trees. The congregation at Emmanuel Episcopal Church was still meeting at the church until the late-1980s. The church stands to this day. =Roads= The first wagon road connecting Astoria, Oregon with the Nehalem Valley, ending at Vesper was built in 1901. The road was 42 miles long. Those roads were restored often after that, including 1908, 1911, and 1914. The 1914 reconstruction was the most expensive highway project in the history of Clatsop County at the time with an estimated cost of $542,875. Vesper was host to an early automobile run from Portland, Oregon on July 15, 1915. The 129 mile tour took the duo on the run, Frank L. Parker and C. S. Brown, 13 hours. The first bridge in Vesper, which spanned the Nehalem River, was built in 1914. Clatsop County approved the building of two additional bridges connecting Vesper and Jewell, Oregon three years later. The two steel bridges consisted of a single truss. Presently, Oregon Route 202 goes through the town of Vesper. Another notable road in the town is Old 77 Vesper Lane, which is a gravel road built alongside the Nehalem River. =Natural history and agriculture= Much of Vesper is forested timberland and agriculture. During the 1920s, a Vesper resident by the name of H. A. Scullen operated an apiary.

The park contains a waterpark, batting cages and a miniature golf course. The batting cages include nine baseball and softball cages. It is owned and operated by the NOVA Parks agency of Northern Virginia. Upton's Hill played a locally important role during the Civil War, as the Union Army command used the site as its headquarters. A large masonry fort was constructed opposite the road, at the hill's topmost point. This fort was originally called Fort Upton but was later renamed Fort Ramsay. By the end of the war, the Union Army built a tall wooden observation tower atop Congressman Upton's home, affording it line-of-sight communications with the Washington Monument and other observation and signal stations in the region.  History  For much of the 1960s, this was the headquarters for the American Nazi Party. During that time, some called it ‚Äúhatemongers hill.‚Äù The American Nazi Party was run by George Lincoln Rockwell and Matthias Koehl. Where park facilities are today, Stormtroopers Barracks once stood, complete with the swastika symbol on the building. Armed guards would keep out all but the Nazis and their guests. A year later, in 1967, Rockwell was shot and killed by a rival Nazi in front of a laundromat on Wilson Boulevard. Within months of Rockwell's assassination, the Nazis lost their lease, and the property was put up for sale. The land passed first to a development company, and then to The Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority in 1973. The former barracks were demolished and park facilities were built. Features Upton Hill Regional Park features picnic areas, a water park, batting cages, and a miniature golf course. The miniature golf course includes what was once the world's longest miniature golf hole, at . The course was designed by minigolf designer Jim Bryant. As of 2017, this is no longer the case, as several other miniature golf courses have been constructed since with longer holes, with the current Guinness World Records holder in Cortlandville, New York having a hole 18 with a measured length of .

Well known in Tauranga, her best-known volume The Elms and Other Verses ran into several editions or reprints covering historical pioneer subjects. Hawkins was specially interested in the first missionaries who came to Tauranga, and in the Land Wars with their loss of life on both sides.  Life  Hawkins (an only child) was born in Tewkesbury, England, in 1883. The River Avon flowed through the bottom of her garden.Morrison. She grew up and was educated in England, and later married a tea and rubber plantation manager in Ceylon: George Hawkins. The two corresponded after George read one of Kathleen‚Äôs poems and their correspondence soon blossomed into romance.Morrison. Hawkins left England to live with George in Ceylon, where they were married two years after their correspondence began. She lived on the plantation for 20 years and mixed with the Ceylonese. She later recalled this time as a happy and colourful period in her life.Morrison. She had few problems communicating despite only knowing English and said relations between Europeans and Ceylonese were friendly.Morrison. The couple had two children: George Hawkins and Mary Gilmer (n√©e Hawkins). In 1938, the couple retired to Tauranga in New Zealand. George made the lifestyle change away from the heat to a colder climate for health reasons.Morrison. She lived in Tauranga for the remainder of her life, some 43 years. George died in 1953 at the age of 79. In Tauranga she established herself as a well known personality with interests in the theatre, writing and the arts. She was a member of The Elms Society. Kathleen died in 1981 at the age of 97. A note on her appeared in the Bay of Plenty Times. The NZ Biographies Index at the National Library of New Zealand also notes Hawkins.  Literary output  Hawkins wrote verse from an early age. With her cousins, she produced private magazines and illustrated and published her early poetry in them.Morrison As a young woman, she continued publishing poems. During her life, Hawkins never used her poetry for personal gain. Each publication of her work was for a particular charity such as the New Zealand Crippled Children‚Äôs Society or (during World War II) the airplane fund and the prisoners‚Äô parcels fund.Morrison. The full list of her publications is not known, and New Zealand libraries hold only 4 titles by her. Published between 1939 and 1974, they are: The Elms and Other Verses (1939, 1940, 1943, 1943 4th edition); The Pup and other Poems for Parcels (c.1942); The Little Blue Horse and Other Verses (1950); and The Elms & Other Poems: A Selection of Writings by Tauranga‚Äôs Pioneer Poet (1974). Bagnall describes The Pup as ‚ÄòPatriotic verses based on wartime incidents‚Äô. In the 1974 edition of The Elms & Other Poems, the list of ‚ÄòOther Publications‚Äô shows a further three titles by Hawkins: The Wind in the Rafters, Songs to Buy Wines and Three Flowers for Christmas. Her children printed The Elms & Other Poems as Hawkins‚Äôs 91st birthday present.Morrison. Its centerpiece was believed to be the first illustrated poem of the author at 15 years. New Zealand poet William E. Morris (Founder Fellow of the International Poetry Society) wrote the foreword to the 1974 edition of The Elms. Morris praised ‚Äòher tremendous ability as a poet‚Äô and noted further that: ‚ÄòTauranga, and New Zealand, can now savour the best of her work. . . Her poems will have carved a niche for themselves in the literature of this country for in her lifetime she has written the poetry of today, simple, direct, but always saying something worthwhile.‚ÄôForeword, William E Morris, The Elms & Other Poems: A Selection of Writings by Tauranga‚Äôs Pioneer Poet (Tauranga: Bay of Plenty Times, 1974).

Kerala Samajam Hindi School(KSHS) Back in 1991, some stray incidents of stone-pelting and hurling abuse by some slum kids in the vicinity upset the serenity of Kerala Samajam Model School (KSMS), one of the premier English- medium schools in Jamshedpur. These children hailed from the lowest rung of society and their parents neither had the means nor the awareness to send their children to school. A Total Literacy Mission survey by KSMS revealed that the dimension of such underprivileged and Out-of-School Children is much wider and urgency was felt to bring them within the ambit of School Education. But the question was how do we do it? We decided to experiment with the idea of using the ‚Äúidle hours‚Äù of the school to bring these kids into the mainstream. KSMS Project School has been running uninterruptedly since, and its student strength has gone up from 50 to 1472. After experimenting with this concept for six years and inspired by this success story, four more such Afternoon Schools were started in the campus of the English-Medium Schools run under the banner of Kerala Public School Trust. Thus, today, five Afternoon Schools are run in the premises of Kerala Samajam Model School and Kerala Public Schools in Jamshedpur catering to around 4,100 students. Following our success, four additional local English-medium schools have started this program, taking the number of schools promoting this program today to nine and the total number of students to 7560. Additionally, we have been able to garner the support of local merchants, the parents of our students, and local authorities and industries in this program.

They were named after Dani√®le Guinot, a professor at the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle in France, and were first treated as a separate species in a tribute volume to Guinot. Description Mictyris guinotae has a well-defined subglobular body, slightly less wide than long, a relatively smooth carapace, and long thin legs. They range in color from pale to dark blue, with occasional pale pink variants; they tend to be darker when they are younger and lighter when they are older. The adult male specimens observed had carapaces between 8 and 16 mm long; adult female carapace lengths ranged from 6 to 14 mm. Behavior These crabs live in colonies of hundreds to hundreds of thousands of individuals, in flat lagoon areas of the islands they inhabit. In times of low tide, they form large swarms or \\"armies\\" that cross the lagoons en masse, while at high tide they remain under the sand. Their main natural predators are shore birds, and they are sensitive to bird shadows, moving quickly away from them. Crab computing The predictable behavior of these crabs has led them to be used to replace the billiard balls in billiard-ball computers. In these experiments, swarms of up to 40 crabs were herded down corridors by images of predatory bird shadows. When the configuration of the corridors caused two swarms to meet, they interacted in predictable ways, simulating the behavior of a reversible logic gate.. Related species Mictyris guinotae crabs resemble another species of the same genus, Mictyris brevidactylus, identified by William Stimpson in 1858 and established as a separate species of Mictyris by Takeda in 1978, and both species were formerly thought to be of the same species. However, M. guinotae is smaller, with slightly different coloring; both types of crabs have light blue carapaces, but M. brevidactylus has red banding on its legs, whereas M. guinotae does not. Additionally, they differ genetically and in the shapes of the gonopods of the males.

(1574‚Äì1620) lord of the manor of Affeton in Devon, was Vice-Admiral of Devonshire. He was guardian of Thomas Rolfe, and a main opponent of Sir Walter Raleigh in his last days. Stukley's reputation is equivocal; popular opinion at the time idealised Ralegh, and to the public he was Sir \\"Judas\\" Stukley. Origins He was the eldest son of John Stucley (1551-1611) lord of the manor of Affeton in Devon, by his wife Frances St Leger, daughter of Sir John St Leger, (d.1596) of Annery, Monkleigh, Devon, through whom he was related to leading families of the west of England. His grandfather Lewis Stucley (c.1530‚Äì1581) of Affeton was the eldest brother of Thomas Stucley (1520‚Äì1578) The Lusty Stucley, a mercenary leader who was killed fighting against the Moors at the Battle of Alcazar.Vivian, Lt.Col. J.L., (Ed.) The Visitations of the County of Devon: Comprising the Heralds' Visitations of 1531, 1564 & 1620, Exeter, 1895, p.721, Stucley pedigree Career The younger Lewis was knighted by King James I when on his way to London in 1603. On 21 March 1617 he was appointed guardian of Thomas Rolfe, the two-year-old son of John Rolfe and Rebecca (Pocahontas). He later transferred Thomas's wardship to John's brother, Henry Rolfe in Heacham. The Raleigh arrest Stukley purchased the office of vice-admiral in 1618, and very soon became embroiled in high politics. In June 1618 he left London with verbal orders from the king to deal with the imminent difficulty with Sir Walter Raleigh, when he arrived at Plymouth on his return from the 1617 Orinoco expedition. As had been recognised by a royal proclamation of 9 June, Raleigh had broken the peace treaty between England and Spain. There was intense diplomatic embarrassment for King James in the situation; Stukley may have understood the king's intention to be that Raleigh should flee the country, but in any case his approach was relaxed for a number of weeks. Stukley had a public notary board Raleigh's ship the Destiny in port. Then on the basis of a letter from the Lord High Admiral, Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, dated 12 June, Stukley had the written authority to arrest Raleigh. He met Raleigh at Ashburton, and accompanied him back to Plymouth. While Stukley was waiting for further orders, Raleigh attempted to escape to France; but returned to his arrest. Stukley sold off the Destiny's cargo of tobacco. Stukley had been told to make the journey easy for Raleigh, and show respect for his poor health. Setting off in earnest from the Plymouth area, from John Drake's house some way to the east and joining the Fosse Way near Musbury, on 25 July, Stukley's party escorted Raleigh. The events that followed were later much discussed. Raleigh traveled with his wife and son. One of Stukley's entourage was a French physician, Guillaume Manoury. They went via Sherborne, met Sir John Digby, and stayed with Edward Parham at Poyntington. They reached Salisbury on the 27th, haste now prompted by an official reproach. At Salisbury the journey halted for a time. Manoury connived at a sickness Raleigh alleged, and Raleigh used the break in the journey to prepare some defense.Robert Lacey, Sir Walter Ralegh (1973), p. 364. The king was there, on a summer progress, and Raleigh used several devices to play for time, composing a state paper in justification of his expedition.A. L. Rowse, Ralegh and the Throckmortons (1962), p. 313. At this point Stukley refused a bribe which Raleigh offered him. On 1 August they moved on. With Raleigh in London By the time the party reached Andover, Stukley was aware that Raleigh intended to escape, and kept a better guard on him. He also countered Raleigh's attempts to corrupt him with duplicity, pretending to be swayed. In London on 7 August, Raleigh was for a short time a prisoner at large, lodging at his wife's house in Broad Street; he used the excuse of illness to argue for this lenient treatment, and was granted five days to regain his health. A chance contact in a Brentford inn with a French official gave him hope. Raleigh attempted an escape down the River Thames, on 9 August; it was with the help of Stukley, who intended to betray him. The plot to ensnare Raleigh involved William Herbert, who had accompanied the Raleigh expedition, and others, as well as Stukley. Raleigh with a party including Stukley took a wherry at night from Towers Stairs; they got past Woolwich, but around Gallions Reach were overhauled by a larger wherry, carrying Herbert. They returned to Greenwich, and Stukley arrested Raleigh once more in the name of the king. Raleigh's end and Stukley's disgrace After the attempt, Raleigh was placed in the Tower of London. He was executed on 29 October, on the old high treason charged related to the 1603 Main Plot; more recent testimony was not legally employed. On the scaffold Raleigh made his last speech, making a point of naming Stukley (to say he was forgiven).Rowse, p. 317. Stukley had given hostile, but not necessarily false, evidence against Raleigh. A public furore arose. It appeared that Stukley, wrongly said to be Raleigh's cousin, was appointed his warden not only as the vice-admiral of Devonshire, but as having an old grudge against Raleigh dating from 1584, when Raleigh deceived his father, John, then a volunteer in Sir Richard Grenville's Virginia voyage. It was alleged, and officially denied, that Stukley wished to let Raleigh escape in order to gain credit for rearresting him. The Earl of Nottingham threatened to cudgel Stukley. The king said \\"On my soul, if I should hang all that speak ill of thee, all the trees in the country would not suffice\\". Pamphlets Raleigh had an effective posthumous advocate in Robert Tounson, who had attended his last days. While saying on the scaffold that he forgave everyone, having taken the sacrament for the last time, Raleigh still called Stukley perfidious. Stukley put together a defence of his own actions, for which Leonell Sharpe may have been the writer.Lisa Jardine and Alan Stewart, Hostage to Fortune: The troubled life of Francis Bacon 1561‚Äì1626 (1998), p. 424. First page of Lewis Stukley's Petition (1618). There were in fact two published documents in which Stukley put his side of the argument, an Apology, and the Petition of 26 November. There was also an official defence of the king's proceedings, the Declaration, written by Francis Bacon, possibly with Henry Yelverton and Robert Naunton. The Apology having failed, Stukley issued the Petition in effect asking for official backing; which was published in the Declaration of 27 November, the printers having been up all night.Thomas Nadauld Brushfield, Raleghana pt. VII, in Report and Transactions - The Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science, Literature and Art vol. 37 (1905) p. 285; archive.org.Rowse, p. 320. Aftermath and death John Chamberlain wrote to Sir Dudley Carleton at the end of 1618, reporting Stukley's reputation as a betrayer, and reporting the \\"Judas\\" epithet. In January 1619 Stukley and his son were charged with clipping coin, on slender evidence from a servant who had formerly been employed as a spy on Raleigh. The coins were ¬£500 in gold, a payment for his expenses in dealing with Raleigh, and regarded as blood money as reported by Thomas Lorkyn writing to Sir Thomas Puckering in early 1619 (N.S.). It has been suggested by Baldwin Maxwell that the character of Septimius in The False One was a contemporary reference to Stukley; though this hypothesis has been regarded as unprovable. The king pardoned him; but popular hatred pursued him to Affeton, and he fled to the island of Lundy, where he died in the course of 1620, raving mad it was rumoured. Family Stukley married Frances, eldest daughter of Anthony Monck of Potheridge in Devon, and sister of Sir Thomas, the father of George Monck. By her he had issue. From the point of view of Stukley's reputation, it mattered whether Raleigh was part of his extended family: this was widely accepted, but it has been pointed out that it may depend on Sir Richard Grenville's use of \\"cousin\\" to Raleigh, when they were not related.

Henry IV of France, after the surprise of the capture, immediately and quickly built up an army which included a large English force and besieged Amiens on 13 May. An attempted relief force sent under the command of Ernst von Mansfeld and the Archduke of Austria repeatedly failed to dislodge the besiegers and afterwards the Spanish relief force retreated. Amiens ultimately fell back into Henry's hands with the surrender of the entire Spanish force. This event was decisiveLevin p 74 As result of the victory, Henry was in a strong position to enact the Edict of Nantes and to negotiate the peace of Vervins which was signed with Spain the following spring.Knecht p 310Fissel p 237 The siege was the last major military event in the Franco-Spanish War as well as the French Wars of Religion.Tucker p 547  Background  Spain under King Philip II of Spain had intervened regularly in the Wars of Religion in favour of the Catholic League against the Protestant Huguenots, most notably in the Siege of Paris (1590), the Siege of Rouen (1591), and the Battle of Craon in 1592.Knecht p 80-81 However, only in 1595 was war officially declared between the two countries by the new King Henry IV of France, who had converted to Catholicism and been received into Paris the year before to be crowned with popular support. From then on, the civil war began to turn against the hardliners of the Spanish-supported Catholic League, including two major royal French victories over the Spanish at Fonatain- Francais and Ham in 1595. The Spanish responded to the faltering of the League and their own defeats with a great campaign that year and the next, capturing Le Catelet, Doullens, Cambrai, Calais and Ardres. In 1597, Hernando Tello Porto Carrero, the Spanish governor of the town of Doullens, proposed a plan to Archduke Albert, sovereign of the Habsburg Netherlands, to take Amiens the capital of Picardy by surprise.Finley-Croswhite pp 81-83 The Archduke agreed and saw the acquisition of Amiens as compensation for the recent defeat at Turnhout in Brabant by Anglo-Dutch forces led by Maurice of Nassau earlier in the year. He assigned 7,000 men infantry and 700 cavalry to Governor Porto Carrero. The plan was to hide 500 infantry and horsemen in small groups close to the city. The Governor sent sixteen men dressed as peasants into the city and divided them into three groups. =Spanish capture Amiens= On the morning of 11 March, these men entered the Gate of Montrescu; the first group carried sacks of walnuts and apples, which \\"accidentally\\" capsized at the city gate. When French guards grabbed the nuts, the \\"peasants\\" produced pistols and overpowered the guards. One guard dropped the gates but it could not close because the \\"peasants\\" had unhitched a wagon filled with wood under it. The 500 hidden Spanish infantry and cavalry timed it perfectly to storm into the city.Pitts pp. 200-01 With barely any resistance the city was soon under Spanish control. The people of Amiens still have the nickname Walnut eaters after this incident. =Henry's reaction= Henry, who had spent the winter in Paris, was awakened that night at the Louvre and by morning had donned his armour. The situation was now serious as the road now lay open to Paris across the Somme valley. At the time a peace proposal was being made between France and Spain. Taking back Amiens would afford Henry a major bargaining position and ensure that peace was his ultimate objective. In effect the siege of Amiens would decide the war between France and Spain.Wernham pg 194-96Duerloo p 46 However, money was short in the French war chest and much dissent was caused amongst Henry's old Huguenot allies, many of whom refused to join and wanted concessions now that he had become a Catholic. Henry relied heavily on outside resources; money and troops especially from the English. Queen Elizabeth I after much dithering reluctantly agreed to the release of her troops after considering bargaining for Boulogne or an indemnity in money, the latter of which was agreed.  Siege  Archduke Albert of Austria by Juan Pantoja de la Cruz On 13 May Henry quickly brought an army of 4,000 French and Swiss infantry and 700 French cavalry under Charles de Gontaut, duc de Biron, to Amiens. In a form of high diplomacy Henry gave the Huguenots hopes of substantial rights and he made sure to stick to that guarantee once the siege was over. This army soon began to expand from all over the kingdom but the main reinforcement was from the English - via the Triple alliance, Elizabeth had sent 2,000 English troops to France under the command of Sir Thomas Baskerville with another 1,500 English raised in Rouen. Most were veterans from the fighting in Flanders and most of whom had fought at Turnhout earlier in the year.Fissel p 237 This army cut off the provision lines from Doullens and began to lay siege to the city. The Spanish were surprised by the speed of the French reaction, many civilians were chased from the city and Amiens prepared for a long siege. The French camp grew in size while still well provisioned; two hospitals were established and the army were financed at the expense of the Duke of Sully.Haller p. 59 The French dug parallel and quasi- parallel trenches, one of the first in siege warfare, preceding Vauban's designs.Duffy p 143 The Spanish launched many attempts against the siege works but these were mainly unsuccessful.Pitts pp. 202-03 On 22 May 1597, Porto Carrero made a furious sally with 500 cavalry on the headquarters of General Biron, seizing a fort which the French had built to defend the headquarters. After two hours of fighting, the Spaniards were driven out and were soon pursued by the French troops who almost made entry into the city. The Spaniards were saved by the arrival of 400 infantry who repulsed the French, which allowed them to close the gates. In mid-June Elizabeth sent more reinforcements from England with another 700 troops under Sir Arthur Savage having landed at St Valery. Savage would then replace the ill and dying Baskerville as commander of English forces in France. With this addition the English force totalled nearly 4,200 men. On 4 September, a French raiding party took a bastion on the south side of the city and in the assault Porto Carrero was killed just before the French withdrew. He was succeeded by Girolamo Caraffa, Marquis of Montenegro. Four days later Fran√ßois d'Espinay de Saint-Luc grand master of artillery was killed by an arquebuse and Henry mourned him greatly; this being a great blow to morale.Wolfe pp 73-75 The situation inside Amiens however was grim as the siege took its toll - many troops suffered from disease and the lack of food. Caraffa in desperation sent out messengers to the Archduke Albert two of which managed to get through. =Attempted relief= Siege of Amiens 1597 showing the English positions (left) & French positions by Frans Hogenberg On September 10 Caraffa was informed that two Spanish relief armies were under way: one under Archduke Albert and the other under Peter Ernst I von Mansfeld-Vorderort consisting of over 25,000 men which included veteran Tercios. Charles, Duke of Mayenne, was able to convince Henry IV and Biron not to confront the huge relief army, but to remain in the entrenchments knowing they were outnumbered nearly two-to-one if in open battle. This strategy would be successful, and Mansfeld's force appeared six miles below Amiens on 18 September upon the banks of the Somme. Von Mansfeld was the first to arrive, on 20 September, and he launched an immediate attack on the entrenched French camps and then the English camp but all were repelled, inflicting huge losses. In the latter attack Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Chichester, was wounded in the shoulder but was Knighted by the French king for his valour. The Archduke Albert had arrived the following day bringing in all troops he could muster, hoping to break the encirclement. On hearing of Mansfeld's difficulty he immediately ordered a discharge of his whole artillery in order to make it known to the besieged that succour was at hand. After passing the abbey of Bettancourt Albert attempted to throw a bridge over the river Somme below the village of Longpre but due to poor weather and rising waters he resolved to find another way. Eventually the southern bank was reached but soon after the Spanish were driven back after having been battered by French artillery fire and were forced to withdraw to the other bank. Peter Ernst I von Mansfeld, by Antonis Mor Another attack was planned for the next day but on observing the French and English force in the strengthened trenches Albert decided not to risk further heavy losses. Although the relief army under Von Mansfeld and Albert had more numbers than the Anglo-French, their morale was low. After being consistently repelled with heavy losses and with rumours of mutiny and dissent in the ranks, the Archduke decided the situation was hopeless. He ordered the attack cancelled and decided to withdrew in good order. The king immediately followed with the greater part of his army so that the Spaniards were constantly harassed but the Archduke avoided battle and withdrew quickly under the cover of darkness. The king then turned his attention back to the citadel of Amiens. =Surrender= Henry could now see the Spanish position was hopeless, and not long after the Archduke's retreat he summoned Caraffa to surrender. Caraffa reluctantly agreed - negotiations for the surrender of the city began soon after; it was signed on 25 September. Henry granted the garrison an honourable capitulation and reviewed the surrender of the Spanish forces.  Aftermath  The cost for the Spanish was high with over 5,000 being captured at Amiens which included many wounded and sick. The relief force had suffered nearly 2,000 casualties - again many to disease. As the surrendered troops marched past they pulled with them hundreds of carts loaded with dead and wounded while the Spanish officers saluted Henry. Amiens was then strongly garrisoned and given much stronger defences under the supervision of French mathematician and military engineer Jean Errard. With the help of the two field hospitals, Henry's forces had suffered moderate losses which came to just over 600, as a result the Siege of Amiens became known as the Velvet Siege. This was one of the first sieges or battles known where field hospitals were established. The siege had strategic consequences - Albert's concentration on Amiens meant that the Spanish forces guarding the border with the Dutch Republic were left on their own, enabling Maurice of Orange to capture several cities in his celebrated campaign of 1597.t'Hart p. 22 With the Picardy capital cleared of Spanish, Henry was now in a good position to negotiate but in order to be in a stronger position he had to subdue the rest of France. The following year Henry thus launched a major campaign in Brittany, the last of the League holdouts; however this was as much diplomatic as it was military.Chaurasia p 141 The aim was to win over the Protestants as well as the remaining rebel Catholics including the Duke of Merc≈ìur. The King set off with an army 14,000 strong and the campaign that followed was a great success and he kept his promise of substantial rights that he had made during the Amiens siege. The rest of the war was almost a formality. While peace negotiations were being held with Philip, towns threw out the last League stalwarts and any supporting Spanish garrisons, who offered minimal resistance. Finally Merc≈ìur gave in; his submission to Henry at Angers was completed on 20 March 1598.Black p 106 Henry then triumphantly marched into Nantes and issued the Edict of Nantes on 13 April 1598 which effectively brought an end to the French Wars of Religion. =Peace of Vervins= The victory at Amiens was celebrated as a huge victory; not only did it mark a definitive turn in the road to Franco-Spanish peace but Spain had to sacrifice the war against France. In conjunction with Spanish financial distress, her insolvency caused by her bankrupt nature after the Capture of Cadiz, two costly failed armadas (in 1596 and 1597) against England and the war against the Dutch meant that Spain had too much to deal with. Mutinies in the garrisons of Doullens, Cambrai, Ardres, and Le Catalet added to Spain's problems. With this advantage Henry made sure the Peace of Vervins was signed which would end the war between Spain and France. The treaty was highly beneficial to France - an ill and dying Philip recognized the formerly Protestant Henry as King of France. In addition Spanish-ruled towns were handed over to the French king under terms of the peace.Sutherland p. 46 Vervins was the final defeat of Philip II, and a sign of the long downfall of Habsburg Spain and the gradual rise in European hegemony of France during the ensuing Grand Si√®cle.Noted by Michael Wolfe, reviewing Vidal and Pilleboue 1998, in The Sixteenth-Century Journal, 30.3 (Autumn 1999), pp. 839-840.Stewart p 49 Notable participants * Thomas Dudley, an English colonial magistrate who became governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and founder of Cambridge, Massachusetts.Richardson et al, p. 280  References  ;Citations Bibliography        External links * Amiens Amiens Amiens Amiens Amiens Category:Conflicts in 1597 Category:1597 in France Category:Amiens Category:History of Somme (department) ","title":"Siege of Amiens (1597)"},{"id":"35503907","text":"Apsey may refer to: ;People: *Len Apsey (1910‚Äì1967), Welsh professional association football player *Apsey, a variant of the Russian male first name Avsey ;Places: *Apsey Beach, fishing settlement in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador *Apsey Brook, settlement on Random Island in Trinity Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador *Apsey Cove, formerly Apsey Cove Point, Newfoundland and Labrador *Apsey Green, village in Suffolk, England *Apsey Point, farming and fishing settlement in the Trinity District, Newfoundland and Labrador See also *Haapse, village in Estonia ","title":"Apsey"},{"id":"35503912","text":"The Russian steam locomotive class Izhitsa (—¥) was a steam locomotive produced in Russia and the Soviet Union between 1908 and 1918, and between 1927 and 1931.

He is known for his genre scenes, portraits as well as his historical, religious and mythological paintings.Jozef Geirnaert at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He was first influenced by the Neoclassical style of Jacques-Louis David and later by the version of Romanticism that was in vogue in Belgium from the 1830s.Joseph Louis Geirnaert, The Finding of Moses at Lempertz Life Jozef Geirnaert was born in Eeklo. He studied at the Ghent Fine Arts Academy. After the school year 1813-1814, Geirnaert became a student of Willem Jacob Herreyns in Antwerp. After his studies in Antwerp, he returned to Ghent and worked there in the workshop of Joseph Paelinck. Interior with tutor advising a young girl, parents looking on Geirnaert started exhibiting religious and genre works in the prestigious Salons from 1817. He got to know the work of the Neoclassical French painter Jacques-Louis David, was then living and working as an exile in Brussels. Geirnaert submitted in 1818 a work for a competition organised by the fine arts academy of Brussels. His genre scene won him the First Prize. The same year‚Äôs submission to the Salon 1818 of Brussels entitled ‚Äô‚ÄôBelgian Officer introducing to his family a comrade in arms who saved his life was also distinguished by a prize. The young artist's success was celebrated in Eeklo and Ghent. There was a triumphal procession from Ghent to Eeklo. In 1820 Geirnaert obtained a medal at the Salon of Ghent for his portraits.Adolphe Siret, Joseph-Louis Geirnaert, Biographie Nationale de Belgique, Volume 7, p. 557-559 He was also in demand in Paris and obtained a gold medal at the Paris salon of 1835 with his Wedding proposal. Geirnaert was for a while a painter who was very much in demand. However, artistic preferences were changing in Belgium with the advent of the historical Romantic school represented by figures of the Academy of Antwerp such as Gustaf Wappers. After the Belgian Revolution of 1830 when Belgium became independent from The Netherlands, the artist moved to The Hague as he was a supporter of Dutch rule over Belgium. In some of his paintings from that time he provided a clear commentary on the events: in Election in Ghent in 1830 he showed a priest agitating on the street against the Dutch regime. After a self-imposed exile of six years, the artist returned to Belgium in 1836. He remained faithful to his themes but also occasionally carried out religious commissions including for the Saint Salvator church in Eeklo and the Saint Nicholas church in Ghent.N. Hostyn, Th√©odore-Joseph-Louis Geirnaert, in: Nationaal Biografisch Woordenboek, 17, Brussel, 2005 Finding of Moses In November 1856 he was appointed as a teacher of painting at the Ghent Academy. He dedicated also much time to his educational role. He received official recognition from the Belgian government when he was made a knight in the Order of Leopold. Geirnaert was married to Theresia Pinnoy. He was the teacher of, amongst others, Joseph Pinnoy (his brother in law), Edouard Auguste Wallays, Theodore-Bernard De Heuvel, Henri De Nobele, Serafien De Vliegher, Antoon Depoorter and Jacques Louis Godineau. Work Geirnaert is known for his genre scenes, portraits as well as historical, religious and mythological paintings. His style was initially influenced by the Neoclassical style of Jacques-Louis David. This style was characterised by its limited palette and strict composition. Examples of work in this style are the Phaedra and Hippolytus (Bowes Museum) and the Finding of Moses (At Lempertz auction in Cologne of 25 May 2017, lot 1502), both dated 1819. The figures in these compositions are wearing garments from Classical antiquity. In the Finding of Moses the drapery is depicted in lively colours and the figures are set in an Italianate landscape offering in the background a view on an ancient city. The scene is bathed in a subtle light. The faces of the women are softly modelled and two of the faces appear in profile, as in Renaissance medallions. He later painted historical scenes such as Godmaert in prison. This reflected the rise of the historical-Romanticism that was in vogue in Belgium from the 1830s which attempted to depict key episodes of Belgian history in a heroic manner. Geirnaert never embraced the flamboyant, Baroque expression this movement took in the works of Gustaf Wappers.

The ship has 14 passenger decks and 1,751 staterooms. 80% of the rooms have an ocean view with 95% of the ocean view staterooms having a veranda. The cabins range from balcony cabins, ocean view cabins, inside cabins, and cabins for people with disabilities. All rooms are furnished with a double bed with easy conversion into two single beds. Standard amenities include interactive television, mini-bar, safe, and air conditioning. Public facilities include seven restaurants, 20 bars and lounges, four swimming pools, a bowling alley, and a gymnasium. A spa is located on deck 14. The theatre accommodates 1,600 guests. The sports arena offers sports like basketball, volleyball, tennis, and a 235m jogging track. A Smurf-themed play area is located on deck 15 in a dedicated children's area. Preziosa and her identical sister ship Divina have more powerful and efficient electric propulsion motors, more efficient alternators and more advanced heating, ventilation & air conditioning controls, and chillers than their predecessors in the class. Rolls-Royce folding fin stabilizers were fitted to reduce roll while cruising. The ship's drivetrain is the more efficient diesel/electric, powered by five W√§rtsil√§ diesel engines. The engines produce low nitrus oxide emissions, using low- sulphur fuel. The engines turn alternators producing electricity. Propulsion is by two GE Energy Power Conversion electric motors with each giving 21,850 kW at 138 rpm. Redundancy is provided, with the two fully independent electric motors each turning a fixed propeller on conventional propeller shafts. The two propellers are fully independent ensuring propulsion if one fails. The same approach was applied to the two fully independent steering systems. A further advantage of using electric motors to turn the propellers is in small sunshine ports. Each propeller is controlled individually, and quickly, for ease of ship maneuverability along with the four bow thrusters. The need for tugs while in the many ports of call is greatly reduced. Two of the five engines have 16 cylinders each with an output of 16,800 kW and the remaining three engines have 12 cylinders each producing 12,600 kW. Total power generated is 71,400 kW at 514 rpm. Incinerators are used for burning waste. The ashes are stored onboard and removed when in port. The waste heat from the incineration is reclaimed. Solid waste is not discharged into the sea. An advanced wastewater treatment plant treats all solid waste. The hull is treated with an anti-fouling coating system preventing hull fouling reducing drag and improving fuel consumption. Energy savings from innovative technology was introduced significantly reducing greenhouse gas production. Energy-saving LED lighting is used throughout the ship. In the cabins, an average energy saving of 25% is achieved. A simple system automatically switches all energy- using devices off in the cabins, such as the main light, bathroom light, socket-outlets, and hair dryers whenever the cabin is empty. A Cabin Monitoring System regulates air conditioning in all cabins allowing guests to set their own cabin temperature. Centralized air-conditioning control is replaced with local cabin control significantly reducing energy waste. The control extends to when the balcony door is open or the cabin card is not in place the cooling system is switched off. A seawater distillation plant produces all the freshwater needed onboard using two evaporators and two reverse osmosis plants. The ship does not pump onboard water from shore water stations. The highly efficient evaporators are completely pollution-free using a system of free heat recovery as the power source. Service history =Construction= MSC Preziosa at Hook of Holland on April 30, 2019 MSC Preziosa construction began in 2010 and was completed in March 2013. On June 4, 2010 a letter of intent was signed between STX France and Libyan state- owned company General National Maritime Transport Corporation (GNMTC), to build one cruise ship similar to MSC Fantasia and MSC Splendida. During construction, the Libyan Civil War broke out in February 2011. In June 2011, STX France canceled the contract, and began looking for a new buyer of the hull. On March 13, 2012, MSC announced it had reached an agreement to buy the ship for 550 million euros with specification to be identical to MSC Divina, naming the vessel Preziosa. A year later, the Preziosa was delivered to MSC Cruises. She was christened by her godmother, Sophia Loren, also godmother of the vessel's sister ship .http://www.tipsfortravellers.com/sphia-loren-msc- preziosa-godmother/ Loren She set sail on her maiden voyage from the western France port of Saint Nazaire. In March 2016, the company partnered technogym for a wellness program including MSC Preziosa, where the passengers in the pool. As of February 2017, she was the first ship to be retrofitted with exhaust gas cleaning systems alongside , and has received an EU marine equipment directive certificate from Bureau Veritas after passing the MARPOL test. In April 2019, the dining area of the ship was enhanced, while in October, De Jorio Designed with Italian interior designs on the ship. In February 2019, the ship was planned for deployment in the United Kingdom in 2021 for refurbishment. MSC Preziosa on the Elbe in June 2017 =Destinations= The pre-inaugural voyage started in St. Nazaire and ended in Genoa. She called in Lisbon (Portugal), Cadiz (Spain), Casablanca (Morocco), Valencia (Spain), and Marseille (France), before arriving in the port of Genoa on March 22. Between winter 2013 and spring 2014, MSC Preziosa was operating on South America cruises from Santos. Its destination calls in March 2015 in Tunisia were cancelled due to the terrorist attack in Sousse. In April 2014, it navigated in the Canale della Giudecca, in Venice, Italy. Between March and October, MSC Preziosa was scheduled to operate on Mediterranean cruises from Genoa. In March 2014, the police in Brazil arrested a crew member on the ship for smuggling cocaine. In January 2018, a 69-year- old Dutch passenger went missing after the ship's overboard detection failed, the passenger was not found despite the navy and helicopters searching for them. In summer 2015, MSC Preziosa called on Marseille, Genoa, Civitavecchia (Italy), Palermo (Italy), Cagliari (Italy), previously Tunis, Palma (Spain) and Valencia. In spring 2017, MSC Preziosa cruised around the British Isles, visiting Invergordon (Scotland) in the Cromarty Firth on May 9. It was the ship's first visit to Invergordon. In May 2018, it began sailing in Northern Europe with the MSC Orchestra. It started sailing around Trinidad during December 2018 for months during the cruise season. On March 6, 2019, three passengers were hospitalized after a flight reserved for passengers on MSC Preziosa, which was traveling from Barbados. The Airbus A330 flight was carrying 448 passengers, and experienced emergency following its eight-hour flight. Passengers and crew members had become ill, possibly with chest infections. In May 2019, the ship still continued to sail on Guadeloupe and Martinique. In summer 2019, MSC Preziosa cruised the Arctic and north Atlantic oceans. The 12-day voyage started in Hamburg, calling in various Norwegian ports including Spitsbergen in Svalbard. In January 2020, five thousand passengers arrived in Trinidad since the coronavirus pandemic has been discovered. = Coronavirus pandemic = On 1 May 2020, CrewCenter reported that two crew members aboard MSC Preziosa had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The first positive result had been announced to the crew on 30 April, and the second on 1 May. The positive results came as a surprise for many of the crew, as no one had boarded the ship since 23 March, and all crew members had been isolating themselves in guest cabins since 11 April, nearly three weeks prior. A small 25-cabin cruise yacht helped repatriate 19 crew members to Cuba. MSC Cruises announced the suspension of all North American itineraries until June 30, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It was written for solo performance by the author but can be performed by an ensemble and was made into an award- winning feature film directed by Ian Mune in 1991. It was workshopped in 1959 and first performed for the public in 1960. The script was published in 1962 and again in 1970 after Mason had performed it more than 500 times.Mason, Bruce The End of the Golden Weather A voyage into a New Zealand childhood, New Zealand University Press and Price Milburn, Wellington, 1962, 95pp, SBN 7055 0010 1 In 1963 he performed it at the Edinburgh Festival. Set in the fictitious beachfront township of Te Parenga on Auckland's North Shore in the 1930s, the main character is a nameless boy of about 12 (called Geoff in the film), based on the young Mason and a man from his childhood. The play is in four parts: :Sunday at Te Parenga :The night of the riots :Christmas at Te Parenga :The made man In the first half the boy spies on an abortive riot by his unemployed neighbours, and sees them and the local policeman in a new light. In the second, he befriends and tries to help a mentally challenged young man who has taken the name of a famous boxer, Firpo. Firpo wants to run in the Olympic Games and challenges local youths to a race on the beach, which he loses disastrously. Firpo is institutionalised, and the boy's greater understanding of the world's injustices is symbolized by the decay of the broom flowers at the site of Firpo's demolished bach at the end of summer. Mason took the play's title from that of a novel the narrator in Thomas Wolfe's The Web and the Rock had wanted to write ( p 12). It has become a cliche in New Zealand for the end of summer.  The End of the Golden Weather (1991 film)  The 1991 film was directed and co-produced by Ian Mune, who also wrote the screenplay with the cooperation of Bruce Mason, although the film was finally made after Mason‚Äôs death. The film, 104 minutes long, was made with a budget of $NZ3 million, and shot on Te Muri Beach, Takapuna beach and Takapuna Grammar School. Helen Martin says that the film keeps to the spirit of the play, although Mune chose to leave out the Depression aspects (e.g. the 1932 Queen Street riots) and concentrate on the Geoff and Firpo story.New Zealand Film 1912-1996 by Helen Martin & Sam Edwards p156 (1997, Oxford University Press, Auckland) External links The End of the Golden Weather at NZonScreen (with video extracts) References Category:New Zealand plays Category:New Zealand films Category:New Zealand drama films Category:1991 films Category:1991 drama films Category:1960 plays ","title":"The End of the Golden Weather"},{"id":"35504136","text":"Ada is an unincorporated community located in the town of Herman, Sheboygan County, Wisconsin, United States.

For example, the average monthly residential water and sewer bill in Italy is 20 Euro compared to 31 Euro in France. According to the OECD, water in Italy has been underpriced for a long time. With about 240 liter per day, per capita water use for residential uses in Italy is higher than in Spain or in France, where it is about 160 liter per day. Water resources in Italy are distributed unevenly, with more abundant resources in the North and scarcer resources in the South. Most water withdrawals are for agriculture and industry, with only 18 percent of water withdrawals made for drinking water supply. About one third of the water withdrawn for municipal supply is not billed to the customers because of leakage, malfunctioning water meters and water theft. The relatively low water tariffs had been made possible by government subsidies for investments. However, because of high debt levels the government has been unable to sustain these subsidies, and investments thus have declined to a level that may make it hard to sustain service quality with an ageing infrastructure. It also makes it hard to improve service quality where necessary, such as in parts of Southern Italy where water supply is intermittent, or in areas where drinking water is naturally contaminated, such as in parts of Latium. The Italian government has embarked on a bold reform process of the Italian water sector by passing the Galli Law in 1993. The law aimed at consolidating municipal service providers into regional utilities, separating service provision from regulation, achieving cost recovery from tariffs, and improving efficiency. More than twenty years after the passing of the Galli Law, regional utilities have been created and regulation is in the hands of regional governments that are separate from the utilities. However, investment levels and efficiency still remain low, putting service quality at risk. Modern history =Before 1994: A challenging situation= Liunforti (Sicily) shown here. Before 1994, the Italian water and sanitation sector was highly fragmented with about 13,000 local water and sanitation service providers, often providing water and sewer services separately in the same locality. Municipalities were both service providers and regulators, creating a conflict of interest. Investments were typically financed through government subsidies, while recurrent costs of service provision were covered by tariff revenues. Tariffs were accordingly much lower than for example in France or in Germany. Furthermore, Italian utilities often provided and still do provide water at public fountains for free. However, because of high debt levels the government was less and less able to provide the subsidies to maintain the existing infrastructure and to improve service quality. The latter was particularly poor in Southern Italy where water supply was often intermittent. Furthermore, wastewater was often being discharged without treatment or with insufficient treatment. In order to comply with the EU Wastewater Directive of 1991, new expensive investments in wastewater treatment were necessary in addition to investments needed to maintain the ageing infrastructure. These investments were to be financed by the water service providers using their own resources instead of government subsidies. In order to make this possible, on the one hand tariffs were to be increased. On the other hand, service providers were to become more efficient, reducing recurrent costs and non-revenue water so that a higher share of their revenues would become available for investments to maintain and improve service quality. Investments in wastewater treatment and bulk water supply were to be planned in a more rational way within the boundaries of river basins. Furthermore, fragmented service provision by municipalities was to be consolidated in regional utilities that were expected to be more efficient. Each local government on its own would not give up the responsibility for water supply, and mayors were reluctant to increase water tariffs for fear of losing votes. Therefore, the national government prepared a law that would force municipalities to regroup themselves and form regional utilities, as well as to achieve cost recovery from tariff revenues. Under the planned law, regional governments would have an important role in setting the geographic boundaries of the new regional utilities. Very few European countries have passed a water and sanitation services law at the national level. The planned law thus had only one precedent in Europe, and that precedent happened two decades earlier: In England and Wales municipal water and sanitation services were regrouped into ten Regional Water Authorities established along river basin boundaries through the Water Act of 1973. In the Netherlands the number of water service providers had been consolidated over a period of four decades into ten regional water companies, but this evolution was gradual and was not triggered by a law. In other European countries such as in Spain, France, Germany or Austria the water sector remained highly fragmented without any intervention by the national government into how water and sanitation services were organized at the local level. Therefore, the Italian approach to reorganize and modernize a local service such as water supply and sanitation through a law at the national level was quite bold and almost unprecedented. =The Galli Law of 1994: An attempt to modernize the water sector= Palazzo Montecitorio, seat of the Chamber of Deputies that passed the Galli Law in 1994. The law set the basis for a fundamental restructuring and the modernization of the Italian water sector. After ten years of producing and discussing various bills, in December 1993, under the government of Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi (April 1993-May 1994), the Italian Parliament passed the Galli Law (L.36/94) named after the Parliamentarian who spearheaded the law. The short-lived Ciampi government that passed the law was a coalition government consisting of technocrats. At a time of rapidly changing governments, corruption scandals, political fragmentation and high levels of government debt, the Galli Law was one of several laws passed as part of important economic and political reforms in Italy at the time. The aim of the law was to modernize water supply and sanitation in Italy. The law had three specific aims: * it set full cost recovery from tariff revenues as a goal, something that was already the norm at that time in advanced EU countries such as France, Germany and England. It also included a controversial obligation that the remuneration of capital, including of public capital, should be included in the calculation of tariffs. * it aimed at creating regional utilities, overcoming the fragmentation of the sector into thousands of service providers. Somewhat oddly, the new utilities were to be regulated by one newly established regional water authority for each new regional utility. * it allowed the privatization of regional utilities through concesions as an option. * it separated regulatory functions from service provision. * it aimed at integrating water supply and sanitation utilities that had often been functionally separated, into single utilities. To implement the law Italy's 20 regional governments were required to define ‚ÄúOptimal Service Areas‚Äù (Ambiti territoriali ottimali, ATO) that would be covered by the new regional utilities. Each ATO would comprise a group of municipalities. In each one, an authority called AATO was to be created that would set tariffs, establish an investment plan as well as a business plan, and award a concession to one public or private service provider. The AATO would monitor and regulate a single service provider in its area. The Galli Law thus, for the first time, introduced clear policies for water supply and sanitation in Italy at the national level. However, it was based on a technocratic vision that was in many respects at odds with the Italian reality. =Implementing the Law: Delays and regional differences= Only four months after the Galli Law had been passed, the government changed and Silvio Berlusconi was elected Prime Minister for the first time for a short period. The rapid succession of governments thereafter led to a first delay in the implementation of the law. Only when during the 1996-2001 period three centre-left governments from the Olive Tree Coalition ruled Italy, implementation of the law picked up. For example, during this time a method to calculate water tariffs, the Metodo Tariffario Normalizzato (MTN), was specified through a decree in 1996. It fixed a standard of 7% for capital remuneration, a level that may have been appropriate at that time before the introduction of the Euro and falling interest rates. However, that rate was never updated after the introduction of the Euro in 1999, and its high level contributed to make the capital remuneration clause of the law unpopular among those that were primarily concerned with keeping tariffs affordable. Until 1999 all but one of the regional governments had passed legislation to create ATOs, in compliance with the Galli Law. However, only about half the ATOs had actually been created by then. The AATOs then were supposed to award concessions. This could be done through tenders, but also directly to private companies or even to the existing or newly created public utilities. Some also sold parts of the shares in their local utilities. Ultimately none of the regional utilities was fully privatized. While many of the 91 regional utilities remained entirely public, many were partially privatized. For example, in Rome the regional company Acea, the largest in Italy, was partially privatized in 1999. The companies that entered the market were mostly foreign, such as Suez Environnement, Veolia Environnement and Saur from France as well as Thames Water from Britain. The implementation of the law varied from one area of Italy to another. In the North, there are strong municipal utilities and a tradition of local government. The creation of regional authorities thus faced resistance there. In some Northern regions, the law was not implemented for a long time, keeping municipal utilities in place. In the Centre and the South, the Galli Law was implemented faster than in the North. Furthermore, the implementation of the Galli Law diverged from the original plan. For example, the boundaries of ATOs were supposed to be drawn based on various criteria including river basin boundaries, in line with the principles of integrated water resources management. However, in reality most boundaries of utilities were drawn along administrative boundaries. =The 2000s: More privatization attempts= The second government of Silvio Berlusconi (2001-2006) tried to give a second push to private sector participation. In 2001, it introduced norms that forced municipalities to award concessions to private companies, abolishing the direct award of concessions to public companies. However, faced with opposition, the norms were revised to allow direct ‚Äúin-house‚Äù awards if it could be demonstrated that in-house provision was more efficient than a concession, or if utilities sold a majority share in their existing utilities. In the meantime, the foreign private companies that had entered the Italian water market in the late 1990s faced difficulties: \\"Foreign players including Thames Water and Saur attempted to enter the Italian market only to become embroiled in never-ending political, regulatory and legal wrangles\\".Global Water Intelligence: A brighter future for Italian water utilities, February 2015 For example, in Arezzo, three years after the contract had been awarded in 1999, the local government asked a subsidiary of the French water company Suez to reduce its management fee because the planned financing had not been mobilized. After lengthy confrontations, the local government and the company agreed to postpone needed investments. In 2006, when the government of Romano Prodi (2006-2008) took office, trade unions, NGOs and civic associations established the Italian Forum of Water Movements, which collected 406,000 signatures in favor of a law on water remunicipalisation. Nevertheless, the third government of Berlusconi (2008-2011) initiated a third push for privatization, this time through the Ronchi decree of November 2009. This led opponents of privatization to push for a national referendum instead of a remunicipalization law. However, paradoxically, investors also saw the Ronchi decree as an element of uncertainty that unintentionally froze private investment. Fifteen years after the passing of the Galli law, it had become clear that the regional water authorities had not been effective. Mayors sat both on the Board of the Authorities and on the Board of regional utilities which they were supposed to regulate, creating a conflict of interest. Utilities, which have a strong information advantage over the Authorities, remained the more powerful players. The technical competence of the authorities remained weak, and investment plans were of ‚Äúvery poor quality (‚Ä¶), structured as patchwork collections of local demands rather than as strategic documents of water-basin planning.‚Äù =The 2010s: A successful referendum against privatization= In July 2010 1.4 million signatures, almost three times the legal minimum, had been collected in favor of a referendum on water privatization. In parallel to the run-up for the referendum, the government passed significant laws that changed the conditions in the water sector. Law no. 191/2009 (the Annual Public Finance Law) and Law no. 42/2010 abolished the ATO authorities, a core element of the Galli law of 1994. At the time, there were 91 authorities, of which 69 had awarded concessions. Regional governments now had to play the role of the sector regulator, but many of them failed to play that role adequately. Still under the Berlusconi government and just one month before the referendum, the ‚ÄúDecreto Sviluppo‚Äù established a National Water Agency in May 2011. The Agency took over some important regulatory functions related to tariffs. Other regulatory powers remained with the regional governments. In the June 2011 referendum Italians voted against water privatization. In June 2011, a double referendum abrogated compulsive competitive tendering and the requirement to remunerate the capital of utilities when setting tariffs. More than 27.6 million Italians voted, 95% of them against water privatisation. The referenda thus moved the legal framework back to the original Galli Law. The Berlusconi government, in office until November 2011, then tried to reintroduce norms abolished by the referendum through the back door, but was prevented from doing so through a 2012 Supreme Court decision. In December 2011 the government integrated the new National Water Agency into the existing Italian Regulatory Authority for Electricity Gas, now renamed Italian Regulatory Authority for Electricity Gas and Water through Law 214/11. The Italian political scientist Andrea Lippi argues that \\"most of the essential prerequisites (for the Galli reforms to succeed) were missing\\", in particular \\"a cultural background for regulation, as in planning expertise, as well in control approach\\" and \\"an emergent market for water and sanitation service including private players\\". According to him, the Galli law had \\"offered Italian politicians a solution to escape away from a persistent legitimacy problem\\" by \\"adopting an innovative and fashionable legal framework\\" that was ultimately unable to fulfill the strong expectations for improvement that it had created. Water resources While most Italian cities receive water from wells and springs, some cities depend for their water supply on rivers such as the Arno River that supplies Florence. Available water resources are estimated to be 58 billion cubic meters/year, 72% of which from surface water and 28% from groundwater. Almost 53% of the utilizable surface resources are in northern Italy, 19% in central Italy, 21% in southern Italy, and 7% in the two largest islands. About 70% of the underground resources is in the large flood plains of northern Italy, while groundwater in southern Italy is confined in the short stretches of coastal plains and in a few inner areas. Water is particularly scarce in Apulia, Basilicata, Sicily and Sardinia, a fact that could be aggravated by the effects of climate change. Many Italian cities receive their drinking water from groundwater and springs. For example, Rome receives 97% of its drinking water from springs and 3% from wells. Milan receives its drinking water from 433 wells in the vicinity of the city. However, other Italian cities get most of their drinking water from rivers. For example, Florence gets most of its drinking water from the Arno River, and the Naples region receives its drinking water through the Western Campania Aqueduct from the Gari River. Water use and service quality The volume of water withdrawn for municipal water supply was 9.5 billion cubic meters in 2012, accounting for about 18 percent of total water withdrawals. After deducting losses during water treatment, 8.4 billion of cubic meters of water enter the municipal distribution networks. After taking into account water losses (or, more precisely, non-revenue water), 5.2 billion cubic meters of water were delivered to the users, corresponding to 241 liters per capita per day. This is higher than in France and almost twice as high as in Germany. Italians are among the greatest consumers of bottled water in the world. Bottled water. Italians are among the greatest consumers of bottled water in the world, drinking 194 liters (51 gallons) per capita a year, according to Giorgio Temporelli, research director of the environmental foundation AGMA. Wastewater treatment. Several Italian cities are in breach of EU wastewater treatment standards. Therefore, the European Commission sued the Italian government at the European Court of Justice in 2010 and again in 2012. As of 2010, 178 towns and cities in Italy with more than 15,000 inhabitants are in breach of wastewater standards. These included Reggio Calabria, Lamezia Terme, Caserta, Capri, Ischia, Messina, Palermo, San Remo, Albenga and Vicenza. Furthermore, 143 towns with less than 15,000 inhabitants across the country were still not connected to a suitable sewage system and/or lacked secondary treatment facilities, or had insufficient treatment capacity. Natural contamination. In 37 supply zones in Latium the level of arsenic and fluoride in drinking water is higher than the allowable limits due to natural contamination. In order to comply with the EU Drinking Water Directive, the Italian government had to provide treatment facilities to reduce the contamination below allowable limits. Despite a derogation, the government did not do this. In this case as well, the European Commission sued the Italian government at the European Court of Justice in 2014. Supply disruptions. Drinking water supply disruptions were experienced by about 15 per cent of families in 2004, with the highest figures being registered in southern Italy, where almost a quarter of users complained of supply problems. Infrastructure Main water tower in the Emilia region. The length of the water network was 337,459 km and the length of the sewer network is 164,473 km in 2008. As of 2012, there were 18,786 wastewater treatment plants in Italy, of which 18,162 (97%) were in operation. 542 municipalities with 2.3 million people (4% of the population) had no sewerage. Responsibilities in the sector =Policy and regulation= The Ministry of Environment in Rome is in charge of defining water and sanitation policy in Italy. Within the executive branch of the Italian government the Ministry of Environment and Protection of Land and Sea (Ministero dell'Ambiente e della Tutela del Territorio e del Mare, also known as MATTM) is in charge of water and sanitation policy. It is being advised by a committee called COVIRI (Comitato di Vigilanza sull‚Äôuso delle Risorse Idriche). The Italian Regulatory Authority for Electricity Gas and Water (L'Autorit√† per l'energia elettrica il gas ed il Sistema Idrico, AeegSI), an autonomous entity created by law, is tasked with defining uniform criteria for the setting of water tariffs. Water tariffs should be set in such a way that they provide incentives for higher investments while keeping water affordable for ‚Äúvulnerable customers‚Äù. The 20 regional governments also have important regulatory powers. They are supposed to define investment plans as well as business plans of utilities and to monitor their implementation. =Service provision= In 2012, the management of urban water services was entrusted to 3,161 service providers operating in 8,067 municipalities, according to Istat. However, only a few large service providers serve the majority of the population. Thus most Italians are served by one of the 91 regional water and sewer utilities, each covering an optimal service area (ATO) and operating under a concession from the regional government. Here are some examples: * AQP serves 338 municipalities in the Apulia and Basilicata regions, * SMAT serves 286 in the Turin area of the Piedmont region, * Italgas serves 283 in the Naples area in the Campania region, * CAP serves 194 in the Milan area in the Lombardy region, and * ACEA serves 66 in the Rome area in the Lazio region. The number for Turin is from 2015 and includes the inclusion to new municipalities. The sizes of the ATOs differ significantly. For example, Tuscany with a population of almost four million has only one ATO, while Abruzzo with a population of 1.2 million has six. A full list of ATOs can be found in the article Ambito territoriale ottimale on the Italian Wikipedia. Many utilities in Italy are multi-utilities that provide energy, water and sanitation, with most of their revenues coming from the energy side (electricity and gas). Utilities can be publicly owned, privately owned or under mixed ownership. An example of a mixed-ownership multi-utility is ACEA, which serves - among others - Rome. It is owned by the municipality (51%), the Italian investor Caltagirone (16%), the French multinational company Suez Environnement (12.5%) and by other shareholders. Its stocks are traded on the stock market. Other examples are the Hera Group and A2A, both of which are owned by Northern Italian municipalities as well as institutional investors and small shareholders. Both companies are listed on the stock market. The world's two largest water companies, both based in France, have a strong presence in Italy. Veolia Environnement has several subsidiaries. These include Sagidep which operates mainly in the Northwest, SAP which operates mainly in the Liguria area around Genova, and Sicea which operates in Piemont and in the region around Rome (Lazio). Veolia also holds a minority share in the municipal water provider in the Tuscan city of Lucca. Furthermore, it owns shares in two bulk water providers, Sorical in Calabria and Sicilacque in Sicily. Suez Environnement holds 12.5% of Acea, the water and power utility in charge of the Rome area serving 9 million customers. FederUtility, a trade association, represents the interests of energy and water utilities. Financial aspects =Tariffs and cost recovery= According to the 2015 global water tariff survey by the magazine Global Water Intelligence, the average residential water tariff in Italy for a consumption of 15 cubic meters per month (including wastewater and sales tax) was \\"among the lowest in Western Europe\\" at US$1.71 per cubic meter, with large differences between cities. The survey includes five Italian cities: Genova (US$2.59), Milan (US$0.80), Naples (US$1.48), Palermo (US$2.13) and Rome (US$1.85). In Rome, tariffs had increased by 14% compared to 2014, while tariffs in Palermo remained unchanged and tariffs in the other three cities increased by between 3 and 6%. The estimated annual turnover of the Italian water service industry was about 6.5 billion Euro in 2009. For about 5.5 billion cubic meters of water distributed this corresponds to revenues of almost 1.20 Euro per cubic meter, much lower than the estimate from the global water tariff survey. The degree of cost recovery in water supply and sanitation is low. The OECD, in its Economic Survey on Italy of 2011, wrote that ¬´water has been underpriced for a long time and both price controls and the organisational structure have prevented a rational use of resources¬ª. =Investment and financing= Investments in the Italian water sector are required particularly in wastewater treatment plants, such as the one shown here in Turin. Investments fell by more than 70 per cent over the course of the 1990s, dropping from approximately ‚Ç¨2.0 billion to around ‚Ç¨0.6 billion a year: A study commissioned by the government and published in 2006 noted: \\"The fall in investment occurred precisely at a time when applicable European environmental directives required, on the contrary, an increase in investment. (...) The challenge for the sector is (...) to more than triple the current level of investment, without being able to rely any longer on the contribution of public funds at a level comparable with the past.\\" Most investments were historically financed by local taxes or by cross-subsidies from local energy utilities. In line with government policy, between 2004 and 2014 water tariffs in some cities increased, for example from 1.20 to 1.60 Euro per cubic meter in Florence. However, many local politicians are reluctant to raise water tariffs, even if such increases are foreseen in the business plans of regional utilities. Water tariffs thus remain much lower than in the UK, France, Germany or Austria. The average water bill of a household using 100 cubic meters per year was only 11 Euro per month in 2011, according to the Blue Book of the Italian water sector published by the research group Utilitatis. The Blue Book estimated the need for investments in the sector for the next 30 years at 64 billion Euro (about 2.1 billion Euro/year). Half of the investment is for maintenance. Expected public funding will cover only 11% of the total. The remainder is expected to come from private funding. However, ATO business plans do not provide room for more debt. Only a small share of investments can be financed by EU grants that are only available for some regions like Sardinia and Sicily. Efficiency The efficiency of water and sewer service provision in Italy is low. According to one estimate, the total inefficiencies cost 5 billion Euros per year. They include operational inefficiencies of 2 billion Euros/year, which consist of poor energy efficiency and high water losses. In 2012 the level of non-revenue water, consisting of leakage, metering and billing mistakes as well as water theft, was estimated at 38%, much higher than the 32% estimate for 2008. According to one study, \\"operational efficiency is higher in those ATOs where the water service supply concession contracts that fit the schemes of the new legislative framework prevail or where the service is mostly provided by a private equity owned or by mixed public-private companies\\". The study covered 38 ATOs all over Italy. It measured operational efficiency by the number of employees, network length and operational costs to provide a given output.

It is a full contact competition using metal weapons and a standardized list of rules. National teams compete in several standard events, with all being full contact - no stage reenactment battles are included. Teams from up to 25 countries have entered the tournaments. Main provisions National teams of different countries compete at ‚ÄúBattle of the Nations‚Äù. Under the rules of BN, a national team has to consist of at least 8 and a maximum of 50 fighters. Any representative of any of the historical medieval battles (HMB) clubs, as well as an individual fighter, provided he has gone through a selection process conventional for a country, can become a member of a national team. Qualifying tournaments are competitions, where battles are held in accordance with the unified international rules for the historical medieval battle. National teams organize qualifying tournaments to find the best HMB fighters of a country. The unified international rules, according to which battles are held, have been written especially for \\"Battle of the Nations‚Äù. Before the unified rules were written, the countries had different HMB rules. The tradition for this combat/competition has largely come from Russia, where enthusiasts have held previous events where full contact \\"battles\\" of large numbers of armoured combatants, are held, often in historical sites. The emphasis is put on the combatants wearing historically accurate equipment and heraldry, and the use of appropriate weapons for the combat. The heraldry, however, reflects the modern competition teams, rather than necessarily historically correct heraldic device that may have been worn by combatants in the medieval period.

Its participants, captains of the first national teams, came to a consensus concerning how to hold the event. Since the rules could vary in different countries and even in different regions of one country, they also agreed of a set of unified international rules for the conduct of battles. The first \\"Battle of the Nations\\" event was held in 2010 in Khotyn (Ukraine).\\"Inside The Violent, Geeky World Of Hardcore International Medieval Combat\\", Mar 1, 2014, Tim Chester, Buzzfeed.com It was attended by the national teams of four countries: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland. Russia won most of the first places. The program included three categories: a duel (1 vs 1), group battles (5 vs 5) and mass battles (21 vs 21). For those who were not members of the national teams, but came to support the comrades, there were non-security buhurts. The second event, in 2011, was also held at the Khotyn Fortress. seven national teams participated; the previous four and three novice teams: Italy, Germany, Quebec. Two more categories were added to the three classic ones, namely the ‚Äúprofessional fight‚Äù and ‚Äúall vs all‚Äù. The latter category allows participants who are not members of the national teams to fight for their countries. The first places were won by Russia. The festival was attended by about 30,000 spectators and a documentary about the life of the participants was shot. The 2012 event was held in Warsaw, Poland, and included representatives of twelve countries. A feature of the festival were battles of mounted knights, that were included in the program of the traditionally foot world championship in HMB for the first time. The top four teams were Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and USA. The 2013 event was held in Aigues-Mortes, France. Twenty-two teams from Europe, the Americas, and the Pacific Rim took part. With the increase of teams, there were no \\"pro rules\\" fights or mounted jousting in the main arena. The top four teams were Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and USA.

Mass battle 2017 21 vs. 21 at La Monumental, in Barcelona, Spain . Valid battle categories Valid battle categories of the competitions held among national teams on the HMB and a brief explanation of them: * \\"Duel Sword and Shield\\", fights 1 vs 1; Sword and Shield with an arming sword and a shield. The round lasts 90 seconds, with an optional 30 seconds added in case of a draw. The fighter to score the most points by striking the opponent with the sharp edge of the sword, wins the duel. The duellists that place 1st, 2nd or 3rd in this category, are invited to take part in the Triathlon Duel category. * \\"Duel Sword and Buckler\\", fights 1 vs 1; Sword and Buckler with an arming sword and a buckler (a small shield, of maximum 35 cm in diameter). The round lasts up to 60 seconds or five points. The first duellist to win two rounds, wins the duel. The duellists that place 1st, 2nd or 3rd in this category, are invited to take part in the Triathlon Duel category. * \\"Duel Longsword\\", fights 1 vs 1; Longsword with a two-handed sword. The round lasts 90 seconds, with an optional 30 seconds added in case of a draw. The fighter to score the most points by striking the opponent with the sharp edge of the sword, wins the duel. The duellists that place 1st, 2nd or 3rd in this category, are invited to take part in the Triathlon Duel category. * \\"Duel Poleaxe\\", fights 1 vs 1, using a poleaxe, halberd, bardiche or similar pole-mounted weapon. The round lasts 90 seconds, with an optional 30 seconds added in case of a draw. The fighter to score the most points by striking the opponent with the sharp edge of the sword, wins the duel. * \\"Triathlon Duel\\", fights 1 vs 1. The category consists of three rounds with the use of different weapons. The first round lasts one and a half minutes, longswords are used, the second round is held with the use of usual swords and buckler shields, three bouts up to three hits, and the third round lasts a minute and a half with the use of the standard shield and sword. Points are awarded for effective (a clear, stout) blow delivered with the weapon edge to the allowed zone. Since 2017, the Triathlon duel category is offered only to the medalists of the three duel categories that make up the triathlon; Sword and shield, Sword and buckler, Longsword. * \\"Professional fight\\", fights 1 vs 1. The category consists of three rounds of three minutes each, pre-selected weapons are used. Points are awarded for effective (a clear, stout) blow delivered with a sword, shield edge, fist, leg, knee, and a good throw with the final blow. * \\"Five vs five\\" the group battles \\"5 vs 5\\" are the most active kind of buhurt combat. A team fights against a team on a hard bordered list field. One five-member unit includes from five to eight fighters (five fighting in the lists, and three reserve fighters). A fighter who falls down (touches the ground with the third point of support) is out of the battle. There are 3 bouts in a battle until a team wins twice. * ‚ÄúThirty vs thirty‚Äù, a mass battle \\"30 vs 30\\", when up to thirty fighters representing a country fight on the field at the same time. A fighter who falls down is out of battle. A battle continues until the fighters of only one team remain standing on the lists, so their team wins. This category allows alliances between countries for the formation of teams. * ‚ÄúTwelve vs twelve‚Äù, a mass battle \\"12 vs 12\\", when up to twelve fighters representing a country fight on the field at the same time. There are nine reserve fighters. A fighter who falls down is out of battle. A battle continues until the fighters of only one team remain standing on the lists, so their team wins. * \\"All vs all\\" are the largest mass battles. All fighters (including those not included in a national team) of all participating countries come to the lists. The participants are divided into equal groups, but in such a way that the representatives of one country are in the same group. A fighter is out of battle if he falls down. Since the win can not be accredited to one nation, no points are awarded. In 2019, this category will be offered as a women's category only. For the 10th anniversary in 2019, the HMBIA announced the 150 vs 150 category, a unique mass-battle event where alliances of teams from the 30vs30 category fight in the largest mass battle category ever offered. Old categories: * ‚ÄúRoyal category‚Äù, a mass battle \\"21 vs 21\\", when up to twenty-one fighters representing a country fight on the field at the same time. There are six reserve fighters. A fighter who falls down is out of battle. A battle continues until the fighters of only one team remain standing on the lists, so their team wins. This category was last offered in 2018. At the 2018 summit in Serbia it was replaced with both the 12vs12 and the 30vs30 categories. * \\"Archery tournament\\" (bow and crossbow). The tournament is held at a specially equipped place and it takes place for about 2 days. Categories and regulations may vary depending on the festival. Valid non-battle categories * \\"Contest for the best set of armor and weapons\\" is held among fighters of the national teams, who can demonstrate only those sets that were used in battles.

He was born in Hull and grew up in nearby Market Weighton where, in the early 1870s, he set up his first photographic studio. Examples of his work from that period have survived and are collected. In 1881 Kirk moved his family and his business to Cowes, Isle of Wight. Cowes at that time was the international centre of yachting, the sport of royalty, the rich and the privileged. At Cowes yachts were raced, bought, sold and shown off. The rich and the titled came to Cowes to meet each other, to play and to be seen. Kirk photographed the boats and their owners afloat and ashore. He specialised in marine photographs, in portraiture e.g a copy of Kirk's photograph of The Marquis of Ormonde is held in the British National Archives at Kew.\\"The National Archives, Kew, London. Ref COPY 1/419/270 He photographed groups at house parties, tutor groups and sports teams of Naval Cadets at Osborne Naval College. His photographs of the sumptuous interiors of large yachts remain to record that era. Kirk's reputation grew when he photographed Queen Victoria's yacht HMY Alberta at a speed of 10 knots entering Cowes Harbour; this is said to be one of the first British photographs of a vessel in motion. and to have earned him the Royal Warrant. Photographs by Kirk of the yachts Bona and Ailsa, for example, were sold by auction at Christie's, New York and his work is sought by collectors.

The mummy is a member of the group known as Tarim mummies. His naturally-mummified remains were discovered in Tomb 2 at the Zaghunluq cemetery, near the town of Qiemo (Ch√§rch√§n) in the Taklamakan Desert of north-west China. Like the rest of the Tarim Mummies, he is famous for European-like facial features and clothing. It is believed that the Cherchen man like the other Tarim mummies are evidence of the Afanasievo culture's descent from the Indo-European language speakers who migrated into the Russian steppes around 3300 BCE. Other such remains have also been recovered at sites throughout the Tarim basin, including Q√§wrighul, Yanghai, Shengjindian, Shanpula (Sampul), and Qizilchoqa. Description The mummy is an adult male who is believed to have died around 1000 BCE and is likely to have been aged around fifty years at the time of his death. His height is estimated at 176‚Äì178 cm. His hair was \\"reddish brown flecked with grey, framing high cheekbones\\", he had an \\"aquiline\\" \\"long nose, full lips and a ginger beard\\", and was wearing \\"a red twill tunic\\" and leggings with a pattern resembling \\"tartan\\". Yellow and purple spiral and sun patterns on the mummies face have been misidentified as tattoos in some sources; they are actually an ochre paint. The name Cherchen Man was popularized by a musician from the same region. Tahir Burhan is a world-music performer originally from Cherchen. Mummification Like other mummies from the Tarim, Cherchen Man was buried in a tomb made of mud bricks topped with reeds and brush. The Cherchen man and the other female mummy were placed on multiple branches, with small mats underneath them that reduced the moisture in the tomb, adding to their preservation. The Cherchen man also appears to have a had a piece of wood holding his legs up in the bent position which would have increased the amount of air circulation, slowing the rate of decomposition. The Cherchen man and his companions were natural mummies meaning that unlike the well known Egyptian mummies, they became mummies from exposure to their ambient environment, as opposed to intentional human practices.

Research His work has focused on Kant, Aristotelianism, Renaissance philosophy and intellectual history. In his \\"Kant and Aristotle\\", Sgarbi follows Giorgio Tonelli's investigations and he examines the intellectual situation of K√∂nigsberg in the years of the formation of the Kantian philosophy, assuming that K√∂nigsberg with its university are the framework from which Kant actually took fundamental ideas and problems. In particular he focuses on the Aristotelian tradition, on Schulphilosophie, and on the Eclectic movement, which dominated K√∂nigsberg up to the advent of Kant's critical philosophy.Riccardo Pozzo, Kant: ¬´Bentornato Aristotele!¬ª, Il Sole-24 Ore, 11-7-2010, 35 In \\"Kant e l'irrazionale\\", which is also translated in Spanish, Sgarbi shows that the third Critique is neither a book on aesthetics nor on teleology, but on an hermeneutical not-conceptual logic.Jocelyn Benoist, Che cos'√® un'esperienza kantiana, Il Sole-24 Ore, 28-11-2010, 50 \\"Kant on Spontaneity\\" is the first full-length study of the problem of spontaneity in Kant. He demonstrates that spontaneity is a crucial concept in relation to every aspect of Kant's thought. He begins by reconstructing the history of the concept of spontaneity in the German Enlightenment prior to Kant and goes on to define knowing, thinking, acting and feeling as spontaneous activities of the mind that in turn determine Kant's logic, ethics and aesthetics. He shows that the notion of spontaneity is key to understanding both Kant's theoretical and practical philosophy. In intellectual history, he proposes an original methodology based on the history of problems, in competition with the methodology of the history of ideas and Begriffsgeschichte. In his view, history of problem is 1) based on original elements of human experience; 2) always new, because the experience of problems and their solutions are always new; 3) rich, because to one problem refers to multiple ideas and conceptualities; 4) infinite, because the solutions and approaches to the problems are infinite; 5) interdisciplinary, because different sciences can solve the same problem from different points of view; 6) intercultural, because problems are common elements of the various civilizations; 7) able to open new ways to find new solutions.\\"Theory of the History of Problems. A Re-contextualization,\\" in G√ºrcan Ko√ßan (ed.), Transnational Concepts, Transfers and the Challenge of Peripheries (Istanbul Teknik Universitesi Press: Istanbul 2008), 125. In March 2014 at the Renaissance Society of America Annual Meeting in New York, Sgarbi presented his conception of Renaissance, called \\"Liquid Renaissance\\" and based on reflexive historiography. He employs ‚Äúliquid‚Äù in the same way of contemporary historians and sociologist to characterize \\"liquid democracy\\" or \\"liquid society\\", that is when one or more parts of the whole constitute dynamically, voluntarily or involuntarily, the whole itself that circularly and continuously redefines the parts. He emphasizes that we cannot help seeing the past from the point of view of the present, but we should do it in a correct way, otherwise, certain aspects of the past may be overlooked or misunderstood. Renaissance should be carefully historically qualified according to time and place and should be constantly redefined according to the progress of scholarship, since what the Renaissance was or is shifts almost kaleidoscopically, establishing the existence of many Renaissances. In his ERC project Sgarbi explored the role of logic and epistemology in Renaissance Italy, focusing Antonio Tridapale, Alessandro Piccolomini, Niccol√≤ Massa, Sebastiano Erizzo, Sperone Speroni, Benedetto Varchi and Francesco Robortello.https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/704863 His research shed light on the emergence of a new conception of knowledge, on in which knowledge is above all else power. With the idea that knowledge is not only power, but a power that must be available to all, this knowledge represented a radical shift compared to previous conceptions in which knowledge was held exclusively by the universities and the clergy. It constituted an impulse towards the democratization of knowledge. Within this framework, Sgarbi argues, that logic, especially logic in the vernacular took on an entirely new role within the encyclopedia of sciences, becoming a general instrument for discovering new knowledge. His research focused on Francesco Robortello's theory of the popularization of knowledge and claims that popularization, vulgarization and translation are means for educating people, not reducing high culture to lower level.https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/V/bo56699778.html His study on Renaissance epistemology led to a new understanding of the audience of the vernacular works, the rise of the vernacular language and Aristotelianism, the definition of what was meant by vulgarizing in the Italian Renaissance. His research shows that vernacular renderings of Aristotle's works were aims at the people, including men lacking culture or knowledge of Latin as well as princes, men of letters, women and children. Vulgarization was not just a simple matter of simplifying and trivializing knowledge, but a way to learn common people.https://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/renref/article/view/27721 His research examined all the treatises that deal explicitly with the theory of vulgarization and translation in Renaissance Italy and led to the conclusion that it is impossible to state unequivocally that to vulgarize does not always mean to transpose into the vernacular, namely to translate, but can sometimes also have the broader meaning of popularizing. Hence not every translation is a vulgarization. As regards both translations and other forms of vulgarizations, it meant rendering in the vernacular for the purpose of making content more accessible. Content is never at the expense of rhetoric or the eloquence. Sgarbi calls this process \\"philologism of the content\\".https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17496977.2018.1521628?af=R&journalCode;=rihr20 He studied the epistemology and the new conception of knowledge in the context of vernacular mechanics, physics and meteorology. At the Renaissance Society of America Annual meeting in Berlin in 2015 he showed how besides the Latin production, various Italian vernacular commentaries, expositions and translations of the Pseudo-Aristotelian Mechanical Problems were produced for very practical purposes. Works such as those of Oreste Biringucci, Antonio Guarino, Giuseppe Moletti, and Nicol√≤ Tartaglia were addressed to engineers, architects and bombardiers.https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.rsa.org/resource/resmgr/2015_Berlin/pdf_of_final_program.pdf He researched on Trifon Gabriele's philosophical works on meteorology, by showing how the eclectic perspective was peculiar of the cultural contexts outside the university, as the academies, which were more open to the contamination of various philosophical traditions. Sgarbi investigated the philosophy in Renaissance academies (Accademia degli Infiammati, Accademia fiorentina, Accademia dei Vivi), by examining authors like Nicol√≤ Vito di Gozze, Francesco Barozzi, Alessandro Piccolomini, Benedetto Varchi, Ludovico Dolce and Sperone Speroni. In his monograph on the immortality of the soul in Renaissance Italy, he shows how this topic usually matter of scholastic debate among university professors became common currency in vernacular writings too. These works show high eclecticism of Aristotelianism with Platonism and Hermeticism in order to save the idea of the individual immortality of the soul.https://st.ilsole24ore.com/art/cultura/2016-02-18/l-evangelica-farfalla- torna-volare-112520.shtml?uuid=ACZIpBXC&refresh;_ce=1 His latest research is on the epistemologies of medicinehttp://www.masterfilosofiadelahistoria.com/agenda-master/137-why- medicine-matters-for-understanding-early-modern-philosophy-towards-a-new- history-of-knowledge.html and its impact on early modern philosophy. During the conference (De)Constructing authority in early modern cosmologyhttps://www.uibk.ac.at/projects/noscemus/pdf- dokumente/programmheft_workshop_cosmology.pdf Sgarbi showed how the anatomical epistemological model influenced Galileo's notion of sensate esperienze.

Concept and creation Naoto was created for Persona 4. She is a young detective who moves to Inaba, the setting of Persona 4, to solve a serial-murder case. Due to the gendered stereotypes of detectives and institutional misogyny in law enforcement, Naoto presents as a man in order to hide her gender. In the Japanese version, Naoto uses 'boku', a typically male pronoun, while interchangeably using he and she in the English version. Naoto's design in Persona 4 Arena was inspired by the character Raidou Kuzunoha. When designing Naoto for Persona 4: Dancing All Night, designer Kazuhisa Wada depicted her dancing style as more feminine to show Naoto embracing her feminine side more. Her dancing style comes from house music, with Wada noting that this dance style had a certain degree of sex appeal. Naoto is voiced by Romi Park in Japanese, Anna Graves in the English version of Persona 4 and by Valerie Arem in the English version of Persona 4 Arena Ultimax. Appearances Naoto appears in Persona 4 and is a detective trying to solve the murders in the game. Naoto uses herself as bait by appearing on TV and allowing herself to be kidnapped by the culprit. The group follows Naoto to the TV world, where Naoto is confronted by her Shadow, who expresses their frustration with her birth sex and at being treated like a child by the police. Naoto explains after Shadow Naoto has been defeated due to the male-oriented nature of the police department, which is why she had been presenting as male. Once Naoto comes to understand her feelings, her Shadow turns into the Persona , a robotic humanoid wearing a blue suit jacket that has an insect-like head and butterfly-like wings. Following Naoto's recovery from her time in the TV world, she joins the protagonists in finding the culprit, having gained clues about his method thanks to her kidnapping. Throughout Yu's interactions with Naoto, she regains her passion for being a detective. Depending on the player's actions, Naoto can become intimate with Yu. Naoto also decides that she isn't a detective just to uphold her family tradition, but because she wants to be and thoroughly enjoy it no matter her gender or age. Her Persona then evolves into , a humanoid in a white and blue traditional armed forces dress uniform with a more bird-like appearance. In the game's ending, Naoto decides to stay in Inaba, unsure what to do now that the case is closed. In Persona 4 Golden, Naoto gets the new Persona , whose outfit is red and blue, and has long, flowing blonde hair. Naoto appears as a playable character in Persona 4 Arena, where she is pursuing the character Mitsuru Kirijo from Persona 3. She later appears in Persona 4: Dancing All Night. A novel that takes place one year after Persona 4 was released starring Naoto called Persona 4 x Detective Naoto, where she is investigating the disappearance of her old friend Touko Aoi. This novel was made by Dengeki Bunko. Reception Naoto has received mixed reception. Kimberley Wallace of Game Informer ranked her as one of the best Persona characters. Geoff Thew of Hardcore Gamer found Naoto to be attractive due in part to her detective work. Andrew Clouther of GameZone expressed skepticism with how Naoto was being designed for Persona 4: Dancing All Night, feeling that Naoto depicted in a sexual light felt unlike her and expressed concern that it would be used to justify \\"fan-service.\\" A swimsuit costume that Naoto wears in Dancing All Night was described as \\"conservative\\" by Matt Sainsbury of Digitally Downloaded, who felt it fit her character. Mike Cosimano regarded her as a great character due to her pragmatism and quality detective work. Janine Hawkins of Paste Magazine praised her for her outfit, feeling that few could pull it off as well. Naoto's gender identity and status as a queer character has been the subject of discussion from critics. She has been identified as both a cross-dressing woman and a trans man. Vrai Kaiser of The Mary Sue was initially hoping to find a \\"kindred spirit\\" with Naoto, but grew upset when they discovered that this was not the case. Michael Higham of GameSpot felt that certain choices players could make regarding her gender identity were insensitive. Carolyn Petit of GameSpot considered Naoto to be a trans man, but expressed disappointment that Persona 4 seemed to reject this idea. She criticized the reasoning for Naoto presenting male, feeling it \\"rang false\\" due to finding it unbelievable for someone to live as a different gender due to an attachment to fictional characters. She also took issue with characters changing their behavior towards Naoto, citing Yosuke flirting with her and characters explaining certain behaviors as being due to her gender as examples. Writer Mattie Brice found the depiction of Naoto to be transphobic, suggesting that the transgender character Erica Anderson from Catherine was indicative that the motives behind her depiction was questionable. Brice interpreted the scene between Naoto and her shadow as rejecting the need for sexual reassignment surgery in order to be a man. They criticized Naoto's Social Link, feeling it to be a wasted opportunity and that the choices you can make regarding her gender identity. Despite their issues with the character, they found her character enjoyable and appreciated being able to explore the idea of dating a trans man. Carol Grant of Vice criticized Naoto, suggesting that the romance scenes were demeaning to Naoto's identity and while expressing disappointment in how Naoto's gender identity is handled. Authors of the book Queerness in Play discuss how Naoto's gender expression and struggles with gender is used to teach players about the transgender experience.

The Abu Dhabi campus was planned by New York University, and the funding mainly came from the UAE government. The school was first opened in 2008 on a site in downtown Abu Dhabi, where it held various public events such as academic conferences, workshops, and performances. Alfred Bloom, former president of Swarthmore College, was appointed to lead NYU Abu Dhabi as vice chancellor in September 2008. NYU Abu Dhabi accepted its first class of 150 students in September 2010. As of 2010 the college offered liberal arts and science subjects, including engineering. It welcomed Mari√´t Westermann, former Vice President at The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, former provost of NYU Abu Dhabi, former director of NYU's Institute of Fine Arts, and art historian, as a second Vice Chancellor in August, 2019 New York University moved the Abu Dhabi campus to a new site in 2014 in the Marina district of Saadiyat Island. It was designed by Rafael Vi√±oly, an Uruguayan architect, and built by Al-Futtaim Carillion. NYU eventually plans to have 2,000 students at the campus. The university plans to open a graduate school and to make the school a center for research. President Bill Clinton, the 42nd President of the United States and founder of Clinton Foundation, was the keynote speaker at NYU Abu Dhabi‚Äôs inaugural commencement ceremony for 140 graduates held on May 25, 2014.

Global Network Seminars link students in New York and Abu Dhabi for a shared educational experience. A classroom equipped with videoconference equipment is connected to a similar classroom in Abu Dhabi and enables joint seminars based on exchange and cooperation between NYU students on both campuses. 19 WSN has a media center, conference rooms, classrooms, gallery space, a lounge and office space for NYUAD Staff and Faculty. =Saadiyat Island campus= NYU Abu Dhabi Saadiyat Campus A permanent campus is on Saadiyat Island within a cultural district for the city that houses Louvre Abu Dhabi and is also planned to house Guggenheim Abu Dhabi museum. Architect Rafael Vi√±oly was named master planner for the campus, designing it to combine elements of NYU‚Äôs Greenwich Village environment and traditional Islamic villages. The pedestrian campus consists of state-of-the- art classrooms, library, and information technology facilities; laboratories; academic buildings; student dormitories; faculty and residential housing; and athletic and performance facilities. The campus covers nearly 40 acres and also offers a number of public spaces, including theater and performance halls, an art gallery, conference center, and various retail offerings. The construction costs of the NYUAD Saadiyat Campus were entirely funded by the Abu Dhabi government, as will be the operating costs and any future expansions.https://web.archive.org/web/20100917064857/http://nyunews.com/news/2010/09/13/13abudhabi/ Public space on the NYUAD Highline with views of the Persian Gulf Reports have been made since the beginning of the project of abuse of foreign construction workers at the site, including the arbitrary withholding of wages, unsafe working conditions and failure of the construction companies to pay recruitment fees to laborers.

Faculty and Research NYU Abu Dhabi faculty and researchers come from universities all over the world to work in its multidisciplinary labs and collaborative research centers. An article in Nature Asia states that NYU Abu Dhabi chemists developed thin films of ‚Äòsmart‚Äô polymers that respond to heat and light, a breakthrough in research that could revolutionize how energy is generated and consumed. The smart materials project is led by award-winning NYU Abu Dhabi Associate Chemistry Professor Pance Naumov, a recipient of the Humboldt Research Award. NYU Abu Dhabi‚Äôs Library of Arabic Literature (LAL) offers Arabic editions and English translations of significant works of Arabic literature, with an emphasis on the seventh to nineteenth centuries. In its first three years, LAL published nine volumes ‚Äî on literature, law, religion, biography, and mysticism ‚Äî and more are in production. LAL won high praise in an article by Times Literary Supplement that said, ‚Äú‚Ä¶the study and teaching of medieval Arabic thought and literary creativity will be revolutionized‚Äù by the library's work. Akkasah Center for Photography at NYU Abu Dhabi collects antique photos from around the Middle East to capture the region‚Äôs societal transformation over the last century. In its first year, more than 10,000 photos were curated NYU Abu Dhabi is an international partner in the XENON100 and XENON1T dark matter experiments taking place at the Gran Sasso Laboratory in Italy. Scientists recorded results that challenge several dark matter models and a longstanding claim of dark matter detection. Papers detailing the results were published in the journals Science and Physical Review Letters. NYU Abu Dhabi Associate Professor of Physics Francesco Arneodo is a collaborating author and leads NYU Abu Dhabi‚Äôs XENON research group of graduate students, postdoctoral associates, and student interns. Collaborating researchers, including scientists from the Center for Global Sea-level Change (CSLC) at NYU Abu Dhabi, published a 2014 paper in the journal Nature that found one of the most sensitive and critical areas of the Earth‚Äôs ice in West Antarctica is being affected by sea-level changes in the north and tropical Atlantic, which has been warming for over 30 years.

SMSP is intended for undergraduate students at institutes of higher education in the United Arab Emirates other than New York University Abu Dhabi. The other community program is the NYUAD Summer Academy Program which is open to Abu Dhabi-based high school students entering their 11th year. Recipients take academic courses and receive English training and leadership training. They also travel to the United States to see the university's New York campus. Controversies An article appeared in the New York Times regarding labor violations during construction, with workers complaining of their passports being confiscated and of being charged a year's wages in advance to work for little money in poor conditions. Such criticisms have been described as \\"one of the factors at play in a faculty vote of no-confidence in President John Sexton‚Äôs leadership in 2013 [and] Sexton retiring as president in 2016.\\" In March 2015, NYU professor Andrew Ross was prevented from boarding a plane to NYU Abu Dhabi, prompting him to decry what he felt was an attack on his academic freedom. As he told Slate Magazine, \\"If someone with my kind of profile and especially my official position ... can be treated this way, what is the value of the protections that are promised for less high-profile faculty in Abu Dhabi? ... My passage to and from the UAE is supposed to be protected, and we‚Äôve been told by our administration that they have agreements with our Abu Dhabi partners about protecting academic freedoms, and now it turns out that they really don‚Äôt have that kind of influence.‚Äù See also * Americans in the United Arab Emirates  References   External links  * Category:2010 establishments in the United Arab Emirates Category:Universities and colleges in Abu Dhabi (emirate) Category:Educational institutions established in 2010 ","title":"New York University Abu Dhabi"},{"id":"35504477","text":"Thein Htaik () is the Union Auditor General of Myanmar, appointed to the post on 7 September 2012.

In a more strict definition, it is the superficial barycenter of the mass distribution produced by treating each continent or island as a region of a thin shell of uniform density and approximating the geoid with a sphere. The centre is inside Earth but can be projected to the closest point on the surface.  History of the concept  In 1864, Charles Piazzi Smyth, Astronomer Royal for Scotland, gave in his book Our Inheritance in the Great Pyramid the coordinates with , the location of the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. He stated that this had been calculated by \\"carefully summing up all the dry land habitable by man all the wide world over\\". In October of that year, Smyth proposed to position the prime meridian at the longitude of the Great Pyramid because there it would \\"pass over more land than [at] any other [location]\\". He also argued the cultural significance of the location and its vicinity to Jerusalem. The expert committee deciding the issue, however, voted for Greenwich because \\"so many ships used the port of London\\". Referring to Smyth's book, Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard wrote in his 1884 book, The Imaginary Metrological System of the Great pyramid of Gizeh , that the perfect location of the Great Pyramid along the longitudinal line could only have been purposefully done by its builders. In the September 1919 issue of Trestle Board Magazine, Mason William Galliher stated that knowledge of the Great Pyramid being the geographical center was \\"determined by many years of scientific investigation\\" and that the Great Pyramid was likely to be the \\"last of the present land surface of the earth\\" to survive a cataclysmic event, due to its positioning. In 1973, Andrew J. Woods, a physicist with Gulf Energy and Environmental Systems in San Diego, California, used a digital global map and calculated the coordinates on a mainframe system as , in modern-day Turkey, near the district of Kƒ±r≈üehir, Kƒ±r≈üehir Province, approx. 1,800 km north of Giza.

But now, the most important historians and museologists of Lithuania like Almantas ≈†livinskas, Leopoldas Rozga or Leonas Peleckis-Kaktaviƒçius, consider him one of the most important writers and publishers of Lithuania.

In 1891, he settled in Riga (Latvia), where he started working as judge and administrator of the railway company. In 1904, he opened his own printing house (AB Lietuvos Knygynas) and his own bookstore in Riga (Latvia). In 1909, he founded the newspaper Rygos naujienos which maintained its activities until 1915.\\"Rygos Naujienos,\\" in Zurnalistikos Enciklopedija (Encyclopedia of Journalism). Vilnius: Pradai, 1997; pg. 427. He also collaborated with other newspapers and journalists like his friend Antanas Smetona (writer, journalist and the first president of the Republic of Lithuania). It should be mentioned that Antanas Smetona wrote about Liudvikas Jakaviƒçius in his memories, written in Cleveland, Ohio, US, in 1960.\\"Liudvikas Jakaviƒçius ‚Äì Lietuvanis\\" in Kult≈´ros barai (2011 ‚Äì No. 4 ‚Äì ISSN 0134-3106). Vilnius: Almantas ≈†livinskas, pg. 77. In 1910, Jakaviƒçius founded The Society of Lithuanian Theatre of Riga. In 1914, he financed the construction of the Lithuanian Theater of Riga. That same year he founded the Lithuanian‚ÄìLatvian Savings Bank. His bank grew up rapidly, but it was expropriated in 1915 by the State Bank of the Russian Empire, as a result of the beginning of the First World War. In 1916, all his business was paralyzed and confiscated by the outbreak of the First World War and he changed his residence to Saint Petersburg (Russia). He bought 15,000 USD (equivalent to US$500,000 in 2014) in printing equipment and moved the machinery in secret to Saint Petersburg, where he continued with his printing house spreading Lithuanian language. Jakaviƒçius was a book smuggler ‚Äì transported Lithuanian language books printed in the Latin alphabet into Lithuanian-speaking areas of the Russian Empire where Lithuanian press was banned. In 1919, Jakaviƒçius returned to Lithuania and re-opened his printing house (AB Lietuvos Knygynas) and inaugurated five bookstores in the major cities of Lithuania, establishing itself as the largest publisher of Lithuania. In 1924, he founded the Society for Ethical Culture. In 1938, he was awarded by President, Antanas Smetona, with the Great Grand Cross of the Order of Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas. In 1940, sick and depressed by the Soviet occupation of his country, Jakaviƒçius moved to Anyk≈°ƒçiai (Lithuania), where his father-in-law, Juozas Grimalauskas, bought a little village with a private lake, a mansion and nine houses (one for each of his children). Grimalauskas bought this little village because of his bankruptcy in Poland by the Great Depression in 1929. Jakaviƒçius died in 1941 in the lands of his wife Honorata Grimalauskaitƒó-Jakaviƒçienƒó. In 2011, his great-grandson Liudvikas Jakaviƒçius‚ÄìGrimalauskas announced to the press that he will open in the near future the \\"Liudvikas Jakaviƒçius ‚Äì Lietuvanis Museum\\" in honor to his great-grandfather Jakaviƒçius. The museum will be about the Second World War and about the Soviet Holocaust that caused more victims than Nazism. Currently, there is a permanent exhibition of the life and work of Liudvikas Jakaviƒçius in the Siauliai Ausros Museum (≈†iauliai, Lithuania). Also, there is about 400 works (books, newspapers, postcards, etc.) written and printed by Liudvikas Jakaviƒçius in the Martynas Ma≈ævydas National Library of Lithuania (Vilnius, Lithuania).

Honorata's father, Juozas Grimalauskas, was a wealthy Lithuanian ‚Äì Polish Duke and Count close to the Drucki ‚Äì Lubecki Dynasty, Royal Family of the old Princedom of Druckiai (Belarus), political family of the Lithuanian Royal Family (House of Gediminas), political family of the Polish-Lithuanian Royal Family (House of Jagiellon) and founders of the National Bank of Poland. Liudvikas and Honorata had five children (Gra≈æina; Liudas; Donatas Bronislovas, Juozas and Art≈´ras) all of which were artists devoted to music and theatre. His eldest son was Liudas Jakavicius-Grimalauskas, President of the Siauliai Drama Theatre, composer of the first Lithuanian tango (Sutemos tango) and a famous pianist, disciple of the Russian musician Dmitry Kabalevsky.

There are 144 species in 17 genera found in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. Anchovies are usually classified as an oily fish. They are small, green fish with blue reflections due to a silver longitudinal stripe that runs from the base of the caudal fin. They range from to in adult length, and the body shape is variable, with slenderer fish in northern populations. A traditional method of processing and preserving anchovies is to gut and salt them in brine, allow them to mature, and then pack them in oil or salt. This results in the characteristic strong flavor associated with anchovies, and their flesh turns deep grey. Anchovies pickled in vinegar, as with Spanish boquerones en vinagre, are milder, and the flesh retains a white color. For domestic use, anchovy fillets are sometimes packed in oil or salt in small tins or jars, sometimes rolled around capers. Anchovy paste is also available, as is anchovy essence. Anchovy mash is also sold in the UK under the label of Gentleman's Relish as per the Two Fat Ladies cooking show. They are used in small quantities to flavor many dishes. Because of the strong flavor of anchovies, they are also an ingredient in several sauces, including Worcestershire sauce, remoulade and many fish sauces, and in some versions of Caf√© de Paris butter. Anchovies are a popular pizza topping in some places. In Roman times, anchovies were the base for the fermented fish sauce garum. Garum had a sufficiently long shelf life for long-distance commerce, and was produced in industrial quantities. Anchovies were also eaten raw as an aphrodisiac. Additionally, fishermen use anchovies as fish bait for larger fish, such as tuna and sea bass. Preparation and marketing The strong taste people associate with anchovies is due to the curing process. Fresh anchovies, known in Italy as ', have a much milder flavor. The rare alici (anchovies - in the local dialect: \\"Sardoni barcolani\\") from the Gulf of Trieste near Barcola, which are only caught at Sirocco, are particularly sought after because of their white meat and special taste and fetch high prices for fishermen.Georges Desrues \\"Eine Lange Nacht am Meer\\", In: Triest - Servus Magazin (2020), p 73. In Sweden and Finland, the name anchovies is related strongly to a traditional seasoning. Hence, the product \\"anchovies\\" is normally made of sprats, while fish such as herring can be sold as \\"anchovy- spiced\\", leading to confusion when translating recipes. The European anchovy, Engraulis encrasicolus, is the main commercial anchovy, with Morocco being the largest supplier of canned anchovies. The anchovy industry along the coast of Cantabria, initiated in Cantabria by Sicilian salters in the mid-19th century, now dwarfs the traditional Catalan salters.

The white fillets (a little like marinated herrings) are sold in heavy salt, or the more popular garlic or tomato oil and vinegar marinade packs. In Southeast Asian countries, anchovies are known as ikan teri in Indonesia, ikan bilis or setipinna taty in Malaysia (ikan being the Malay word for fish); and dilis, gurayan, monamon, guno or bolinaw in the Philippines. They are usually sold dried, but are also popularly used in fermented condiments like the Philippine bagoong and Malaysian budu. Ikan bilis is normally used in a similar way to dried shrimp in Malaysian cuisine. In Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore anchovies are commonly used to make fish stock or are deep fried. Anchovies are also popular ingredients for the traditional Javanese sambal. In Vietnam, anchovy is the main ingredient in the fish sauce - n∆∞·ªõc m·∫Øm - the unofficial national sauce of Vietnam. In Thai cuisine, dried anchovies are called pla katak haeng. They are used in a variety of dishes and especially popular deep-fried as a snack. Similarly to Vietnamese fish sauce, Thai fish sauce (nam pla) is also often made from anchovies. In other parts of Asia, such as Korea and Japan, sun-dried anchovies are used to produce a rich soup similar to setipinna taty. These anchovy stocks are usually used as a base for noodle soups or traditional Korean soups. There are many other variations on how anchovy is used, especially in Korea. Fresh and dried anchovies are a popular part of the cuisine in Kerala and other south Indian states, where they are referred to as netholi/chooda (and nethili in Tamil Nadu) and provide a cheap source of protein in the diet. Fresh anchovies are eaten fried or as in a spicy curry. In Turkey, anchovies are known as hamsi and are eaten between November and March (their name being derived from hamsin, an Arabic term for the winter period). They are generally consumed fried, grilled, steamed, as a meatball, and as D√∂ner, and pilav.

Many saw much promise in the area and remained on as farmers or agricultural labourers. =The modern period= Up until the early 1900s the area was predominantly used for sheep grazing as it was considered too costly to clear the open forest for the sowing of crops. Although considered good farming land it was not until much later that agriculture diversified to include wheat and other arable crops. In 1914 the Navarre railway line was established to connect Crowlands and other nearby towns to the main line to the south which ran between Ararat and Avoca. The line closed in 1954. Late in 2013 Pacific Hydro commenced construction of the Crowlands Wind Farm in the area. After many years of negotiation with the local community it was decided that 39 wind turbines would be erected, each having a generating capacity of 2 megawatts. Facilities The towns facilities include a large recreation reserve, Community Hall, Country Fire Authority shed, Church and a Bed and Breakfast facility. An historic walking trail was established in 2012 and the town has an active film appreciation group known as the Crowlands Film Society.

The history of this craft extends to the pre-Columbian period, which much preserved, as many Amuzgos, especially in Xochistlahuaca, still wear traditional clothing. However, the introduction of cheap commercial cloth has put the craft in danger as hand woven cloth with elaborate designs cannot compete as material for regular clothing. Since the 20th century, the Amuzgo weavers have mostly made cloth for family use, but they have also been developing specialty markets, such as to collectors and tourists for their product. One major player in this development is the Liaa‚Äô Ljaa‚Äô cooperative, which seeks to not only commercialize Amuzgo weaving but also preserve designs and traditional techniques, partnering with organizations such as the Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana (UAM) in Azcapotzalco. Most weavings are still done with traditional designs and techniques and with natural fibers, principally cotton, and dyes. The Amuzgos Amuzgo women dressed in huipils preparing thread for weaving The Amuzgos live in the border region of southeastern Guerrero and southwestern Oaxaca, with about eighty percent in Guerrero. Most live in the municipalities of San Pedro Amuzgos, Putla and Santa Mar√≠a Ipalapa in Oaxaca and Xochistlahuaca and Ometepec in Guerrero. The region is hot with rugged terrain with tropical forest whose leaves drop during the dry season. It has various small rivers and streams. The Amuzgo practice subsistence agriculture based on corn, beans and chili peppers with some other cash crops such as sesame seed and tropical fruits. The region is not purely Amuzgo as Triquis, Tlapanecs, Mixtecs, Chatinos and Nahuas. One name the Amuzgo have for themselves is Tzjon non, especially in San Pedro Amuzgos, which means ‚Äúpeople of the textiles.‚Äù There are about 35,000 speakers of the Amuzgo language. The religion is Catholicism with indigenous elements such as a belief in good and evil spirits which can cause or cure disease, rain or drought and more. The largest community of Amuzgos is in the municipality of Xochistlahuaca in Guerrero. Many houses are of adobe on narrow streets on steep hills. The Amuzgos here have maintained most of their culture in its food, family structure, language and religious beliefs. Since 1996, Xochistlahuaca has hosted a regional gathering of Amuzgos to promote regional social, political and economic development. The town also has a community museum which has a number of pre Hispanic pieces. The children receive primary school education in both Spanish and Amuzgo. Textiles are an important part of Amuzgo culture and economy, although other handcrafts such as ceramics. Although weaving is painstaking and time-consuming, most Amuzgo women do it along with farming and household chores because it brings in money to the household, and the labors of men in the fields growing corn, beans, squash and cotton is not enough. Cotton is highly valued by the Amuzgos, not only for its economic value but also because it is considered to be in harmony with the human body and soft to the touch. Most of Xochistlahuaca inhabitants, especially the women, still wear traditional garb. The most notable of these is the huipil, a kind of long tunic, which is called ‚Äúcheyno‚Äù in Amuzgo. This word means a cloth that covers a woman, and is considered to be an expression of the wearer. There are two types of huipils: everyday and those for special occasions, and both can be elaborately decorated.  Preservation and marketing Juana Santa Ana Guerrero of the Liaa' Ljaa' at the Museo de Arte Popular. Most textiles made in Amuzgo homes is still for family use, especially huipils. However, the craft is in danger because machine made cloth is much cheaper, and as everyday clothing, traditional hand woven cloth cannot compete in the market outside the home. Starting in the latter 20th century, huipils and other traditional clothing for sale has been targeted to specialty markets such as to scholars like anthropologists, rich Mexican woman who wear them for civic holidays and to tourists from various parts of the world including those who travel to Xochistlahuaca to buy. Amuzgo textile production and efforts at preservation are strongest in Xochistlahuaca, with the oldest and most complex designs mostly known only to the oldest weavers in this municipality. The weavers of this town have made efforts to preserve these designs and pass them onto the younger generations. One major development in the preservation and promotion of Amuzgo textiles was the formation of the Liaa‚Äô Ljaa‚Äô cooperative in 1996. The name is from Amuzgo and means \\"materials of flowers\\". The cooperative today have fifty nine members representing fifty nine families, which totals about 160 people, only forty of which are men. This cooperative exists to avoid middlemen, selling more directly to the market for higher prices as well as promote efforts to preserve traditional designs and techniques using natural fibers and dyes. The group weaves elaborate huipils, blouses, skirts, rebozos, bedcovers, tablecloths and napkins, and works together to commercialize them. However, the most important item remains the huipil both for use by the Amuzgo women and by collectors. The Amuzgo have taken steps to have their weavings received a ‚Äúdenomination of origin‚Äù so that this style of weaving is only authentically produced in Amuzgo territory, similar to the denomination of origin afforded to Talavera pottery. They have also worked to create new designs and new items, such as pants and rugs for commercialization purposes with support from government and other sources. One of these is the cooperation between Liaa‚Äô Ljaa‚Äô and the Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana- Azcapotzalco, which aims to preserve Amuzgo textiles and other aspects of Amuzgo culture. The UAM library has a collection of original textiles, along with a catalog of 244 traditional designs used on clothing and other textiles, with photographs in the possession of the Xochistlahuaca Community Museum. The collaboration works to preserve traditional designs which are not often done because they are complex, time-consuming and/or costly to make. Weavers from Xochistlahuaca have received support and awards for their work. Sources of support include Programa Nacional de Arte Popular of the DGCP, Comisi√≥n Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Ind√≠genas, and the Programa de Fondos Culturales. The last has a program called \\"Fortalecimiento Cultural\\" which aims to recompile and register traditional designs to keep the oldest and most complicated from being forgotten. A number of weavers from the community have received prizes for their work including the 2004 Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes awarded to the cooperative as a whole. The work has been exhibited in museums such as the Museo Regional de Guerrero. Estela Pineda participated in the XVI Muestra Iberoamericana de Artesan√≠a in Spain with a huipil made of coyochi cotton colored with vegetable dyes which was recognized as best textile. Plants used included indigo, marigold flowers, roses and others. Florentina Lopez de Jesus won second place at the UNESCO handcraft prize in 2001 for Latin American and the Caribbean. Designs The embroidery and weaving designs of Amuzgo textiles have significance and are passed down from generation to generation. The designs found on the cloth made in Xochistlahuaca is some of the most traditional. The patterns identify various Amuzgo communities as well as Amuzgo identity, with the designs considered to be a kind of ‚Äúalphabet‚Äù by Amuzgo weavers. This use of design is part of this people‚Äôs cultural heritage along with the weaving process itself. Some of the designs can be traced back to images found on codices and pre Hispanic cultures. Most of the designs are based on the flora and fauna of the Costa Chica region of Guerrero, especially those near Xochistlahuaca. These include petate mat patterns, fretwork, suns, stars, mountains, rivers, dogs, horses, donkeys, turtles, water bugs, birds, double headed eagles and various flowers. There are mathematical formulas that create patterns such as ‚Äúpata de perro‚Äù (a kind of leaf that grows along the Santa Catarina River), ‚Äúflores de piedra‚Äù (stone flowers), curvas de cola de tortuga (turtle tail curls), ‚Äúflores de pina‚Äù (pineapple flowers) and ‚Äúpatas de gato‚Äù (cats‚Äô feet). These patterns can be found on huipils, blouses, skirts, napkins, rebozos and dresses. An S pattern represents the feminine and indirectly, the earth. Another common motif is the double headed eagle, which is based on a number of myths of the region. There are also newer designs which were created with the help of Beatriz Jimenez, a designer at UAM. Process Amuzgo woman weaving a rebozo on a backstrap loom Like many other indigenous communities, people learn to create handcrafts as young children, with most boys learning to weave hammocks and nets, but it is the girls that learn to make cloth on a backstrap loom, learning from their mothers and grandmothers. Most of the thread, the dyes and the tools used for weaving fabric are natural and include cotton, wood and even bird bones which function much like needles. White cotton is increasingly used but the most traditional variety is called ‚Äúcoyuche‚Äù which is naturally brown. The name comes from ‚Äúcoyote‚Äù as the color is similar to that to the animal. This variety of cotton is not used anywhere else in the world, but its use is less than the past and not used at all in many works. This cotton is grown by the Amuzgo themselves, along with other crops. Cotton fiber is also often mixed with the fiber of a local plant called cacaloxuchitl. Dyes are made from cochineal, branches from the nanche (Byrsonima crassifolia) and almond tree and hay. Generally, huipils made from cloth 45 cm wide take about four months to complete, working four hours a day. It sells for about 2,500 pesos. All pieces are unique with no two exactly the same. The process of converting cotton into cloth is nearly the same as it was in the pre Hispanic period. The process starts with cleaning and beating the raw cotton fibers, then spinning them into thread using a supported spindle called a malacate (large whorl-less spindle which spins in a small cup). The thread is wound into skeins of yarn and dyed. The warp threads are wound, which determines the length of the cloth to be made as well as some of the colors that will be used. The weaving is done on a backstrap loom. One end of the warp threads are fastened to a wooden rod and the other end is held by a wood stick or rod which is then fastened to the weaver by a belt that goes around her back. The weaving is done by raising half the warp threads to create a space or shed through which the shuttle passes. To create two different sheds, the weaver uses a wood pole called a shed rod that half the warp passes over and string heddles tied to another wooden rod, that the other half of the warp passes through. Some designs are woven into the fabric by introducing an extra weft thread that may be brightly colored. There are four main weaving techniques. Simple huipils are made in brocade with extra or supplementary weft threads seen on both sides of the cloth. Napkins and tablecloths have one side completely smooth. A second type of huipil has areas of gauze weave (gauze is an open cloth stabilized with leno twists). The fourth is an all over gauze weave called concha de armadillos with the design in the form of a diamond. Cloth destined for huipils is joined together by complicated and decorative hand stitching. In addition to designs woven into the cloth, clothing, napkins and more are further embellished with embroidery with designs depicting geometric figures, animals. Most embroidery is done using commercial thread as it is cheaper. Florentina L√≥pez de Jes√∫s The best known Amuzgo weaver from Xochistlahuaca is Florentina L√≥pez de Jes√∫s. Like most other girls in her area, she watched her mother weave as she sat by her side playing with skeins of cotton yarn. When she was an adult her weaving skills came to include techniques such as taffeta, simple weave, talet√≥n (a variation of taffeta)and variations of gauze. Her specialty is gauze brocade in which various colored brocading weft threads are introduced to form designs. At first, her production was generally sold among her friends or done by special order as she had no permanent shop. After winning awards for her work starting in 1980, she began selling her pieces in Ometepec. Major awards include ‚ÄúPor siempre el rebozo‚Äù in 1991 and Las Manos de M√©xico in 1994 in the category of brocade.

The South Port Clubhouse is situated in the sand dunes at the mouth of the Onkaparinga River Estuary. Due to its location at the mouth of a major South Australian river and its position in Gulf St Vincent, South Port is an excellent surfing beach both for board riders and body surfers.  History  = The club's beginning = In 1958, following a meeting on the beach after a carnival between officials of Surf Life Saving and Geoff Price, Frank Harris and Geoff Cornwell, approval was given to form a Surf Life Saving Club at South Port. There was an obvious need for a rescue facility at South Port as this was the area where the most rescues occurred and the members from Port Noarlunga S.L.S.C. had to run down to South Port with the gear to perform the rescues and then to carry the stretcher up the cliffs for first aid cases. Many of the members of Port Noarlunga also spent much of their spare time at South Port surfing or body surfing and it was a very popular beach for the growing sport of surfing. At this time there was also a dispute between the above members and the Port Noarlunga Club at this time due to a minor disciplinary matter and consequently the desire to set up a new club was due to both life-saving reasons and personal reasons. The Port Noarlunga Club argued against the formation of the new club and accused the breakaway group of being \\"rats deserting a sinking ship\\". Geoff Cornwell argued the case for the formation of the club and the Surf Life Saving Association under the presidency Don Newlands approved the new club. The original name of the club was South Port Noarlunga but the Noarlunga was dropped as part of the name. The South Port Club came into being when seven members of the Port Noarlunga Club applied for permission to form a club to patrol the beach in the vicinity of the mouth of the Onkaparinga River. Good luck chaps and congratulations on your initiative\\" =S.L.S.A. of S.A. 7th Annual Report= The fledgling club began patrols in season 1958/1959 from February onwards with the following members who are named on the first registration form that was lodged at SA State Centre on 22 December 1958:- The original club colours were to be navy blue and white but Henley Beach complained and the colours were registered in 1958 as navy blue, white, and red. These colours were subsequently changed in that first season to the current navy white, and green. In those first two seasons with such a small membership it became very difficult to maintain the patrols and set up a new club and clubhouse and it was clear new members were needed to ensure the permanent establishment of the South Port Club. In season 1960/1961 Don Alexander and Graham Ellery who were discontented at Glenelg S.L.S.C. joined the South Port Club and this new injection of experienced senior members enable the South Port Club to become firmly established and start to grow. The ten members involved in the permanent establishment of the South Port Surf Life Saving Club are the foundation members of the club and all members past, present and future are greatly indebted to their foresight and hard work. In 1960/61, a clubhouse was purchased for $194 and erected on a section of land that in 1958/1959 had been leased from the department lands and the Port Noarlunga District Council. Training Surf lifesavers must be competent swimmers as well as experience in rescue, resuscitation and first aid. This experience is gained in a minimum of 20 hours training and followed by a written and practical examination. Volunteers must be at least 15 years old for their initial training and at 16 years of age volunteers are encouraged to become proficient in oxygen administration. Upon completion, members are awarded the nationally accredited Certificate 2 in Public Safety (Aquatic Rescue) Bronze Medallion and become qualified them to patrol a beach. Yearly proficiency must be shown to maintain their ability to patrol. South Port also has junior members, or Nippers as they are more commonly known. Nippers are aged between 5‚Äì13 years and learn beach safety and awareness skills, in a fun and healthy environment.

It is one of a group known as the azure damselflies. It is found in Queensland and north-eastern New South Wales in eastern Australia, where it is found in fast-flowing streams and rivers. English-born entomologist, Robin Tillyard described the sapphire rockmaster as a subspecies of the tropical rockmaster, Diphlebia euphaeoides in 1913, before reassessing it as a separate species on the basis of the distinct shape of the male anal appendage, as well as differences in size and colour of the adults. The male sapphire rockmaster has a mostly bright blue and black body with dark wings. It can be distinguished from the tropical rockmaster by the larger size of two prominent blue markings at the base (front end) and underside of terga 4 to 6. Its upperside abdomen of its otherwise black abdomen often has blue markings to the front ends of the terga. The wings are narrower than the tropical rockmaster, but wider than the other members of the genus, and are a smoky brown rather than black. The legs are mostly brownish black, but have some blue on the upper mid and hind femurs. The female sapphire rockmaster is predominantly brown and olive-green, and also has smoky-coloured wings. Its legs are dark brown with light brown upper segments of mid and hind femurs. The upperside of its abdomen is a dark olive-green, with a darker dorsal line prominently running down the midline, which widens into a roughly triangular pattern at the rear end of each segment (tergum).

During the second half of the 15th century, and up to 1521, it had a significant role in the anti-Ottoman defensive system of the Kingdom of Hungary. History Gravestone of Lawrence of Ilok, Ban of Belgrade (1511-1513) Prior to 1427, Belgrade had been the capital of the Serbian Despotate. After Serbian despot Stefan Lazareviƒá died in the summer of 1427, his successor ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá was forced to transfer Belgrade to the Kingdom of Hungary and to move his capital to Smederevo. At first, Hungarian kings created the Captaincy of Belgrade, headed by a military commander (captain) in charge of the frontier region (lat. capitaneus belgradensis, or capitaneus nandoralbensis). In 1440, Belgrade was besieged by Ottomans, but the city was successfully defended. In 1456, the Ottoman army tried to conquer Belgrade for the second time, but failed again. After the annexation of the Serbian Despotate by the Ottomans in 1459, further Ottoman expansion was directed towards Captaincy of Belgrade and neighboring Banate of Maƒçva. By the end of the 15th century, captains of Belgrade were replaced by bans (lat. banus belgradensis, or banus nandoralbensis), and thus the Banate of Belgrade was created. Ban of Belgrade also had a deputy, titled viceban of Belgrade. Finally, in 1521, the Ottoman army conquered Belgrade, which also marked the end of the Banate of Belgrade, and the region was subsequently incorporated into the Ottoman Sanjak of Smederevo. Among more notable captains and bans of Belgrade were: Matko Talovac, Jovan Talovac, Michael Szil√°gyi, Peter D√≥czy, Lawrence of Ilok.

The Cineston controller allows smooth operation of the vehicle, avoids the application of brake and throttle at the same time, and provides a clear visual indication of the current power setting. However, it is only suitable for vehicles that do not require steering control, as it is hand operated and thus interferes with the presence of any sort of steering wheel. The Cineston evolved from the rotary controllers used to control the power delivered to the electric traction motors in early mass transit systems. In early systems, notably those found in trams, the motor control was operated by the left hand, and the brakes by the right hand. Typically the brake lever also included a dead man's switch that released air pressure to activate the air brakes in an emergency. In the Cineston, motor control and brake controls are combined in a single lever's rotary motion, and the dead man's switch is implemented in a vertical motion. The lever extends to the right from a vertical control shaft. The lever has a neutral position with the lever extended directly to the left of the pivot. Braking is applied by progressively rotating the lever counter-clockwise, which, due to the position of the level relative to the pivot, is actuated by the operator moving their hand away to the body - to the \\"front\\". Forward traction is added by rotating the lever clockwise, or \\"backward\\". As the lever translates linear motion by the operator into rotary motion of the lever, the level is normally topped with a rotating knob at the right end. This allows the operator to slide the lever without twisting their wrist. The controller often also incorporates a fail-safe device (or dead man's switch) that requires constant downward pressure once the lever is rotated forward from the neutral position. Releasing the lever causes it to pop up on a spring, activating emergency braking. The Cineston controller is known to have design flaws. If the operator suffers from a debilitating attack, they may fall forward onto the control, allowing their body weight to keep the dead-man's switch in its safe position. Additionally, because the lever typically moves forward for traction, in the event of a sudden stop the operator's inertia can cause the lever to be forced forward, increasing traction. This was mentioned as a possibility in the 1977 Chicago Loop derailment, where the operator continued accelerating after a minor collision for unknown reasons. The Cineston's general operation is similar to the slide-controllers found in many modern mass transit systems. These controllers can be considered to be a re- implementation of the Cineston, as its fore-aft motion for acceleration and braking is the same. The change in layout is due to the introduction of new electronic controls, which do not require any mechanical connection between the operating lever and the electrical control systems.

History The arcade of the cloister fronting the internal patio The construction of this complex resulted from a religious pledge of piety formulated during the middle of the 17th century, by a native of S√£o Roque do Pico, Sebasti√£o Ferreira Pimentel. In transit to Lisbon, the boat he was travelling on was attacked by pirates or privateers. In their panic, the crew and passengers saw their carrack enveloped by a dense cloud, and when Ferreira Pimentel affirmed that he saw in the rigging of the main mast a figure of a radiant female figure, of rare beauty, which protected them from harm. After the event, the parents of Ferreira Pimentel, Mr. Sebasti√£o Ferreira de Melo and Mrs. Margarida Vieira, ordered the construction in 1658, a small hermitage to the invocation of Nossa Senhora do Livramento (Our Lady of Freedom/Release) in Cais do Pico. Within a century, with the construction of the Convent of the Order of Friars Minor, or Franciscans under the authority of friar In√°cio do Desterro absorbed the primitive structure.Idalmiro Ferreira (1992), p. 24 Eventually, the convent needed to shelter Franciscan friars from Lajes do Pico following the volcanic eruption of 1 February 1718, that occurred in the civil parish of Santa Luzia, and whose population fled to S√£o Roque for assistance. Silveira Macedo indicated that on 19 October 1721, the convent and later the church (Christmas 1724) were consumed by fire. Remodelling and reconstruction was only completed in 1726. The writings of friar Bartolomeu Ribeiro, around 1740, indicate that the population around S√£o Roque had hardily grown in the intermediary. After the forced extinction of religious orders, during the Liberal government, the monks left the convent, and the building began to serve the state in various forms, including prison, courts, finance offices, theatre and cinema, as well as cultural and sports associations and the municipal office buildings. Over time, it began to fall into ruin, with many of the internal spaces vandalized, windows and doors damaged, water infiltration through the roofPSD (15 April 2002) and most of its artifacts transferred to expositions. It was finally classified as a Property of Public Interest under Decree 129/77, on 29 September 1977, but continued for several years to wait a budget to recuperate and restore its dependencies.A√ßoreano Oriental (12 May 2001), p. 17Direc√ß√£o Regional da Cultura (2012) By 2010, the building was converted into living spaces, as a Youth Hostel (), falling into the network of Pousadas da Juventude dos A√ßores. Architecture The interior of the remodelled Pousada da Juventude re-utilizing the ruined spaces of the monastic complex The cloister of the convent, with the multi-step cross-pillory Over time, the convent and church has become embedded within the urban-rural landscape of the municipality of S√£o Roque do Pico, accessible by Rua S√£o Jo√£o Bento de Lima. Within the grounds of the convent there are still vestiges of the original courtyard: to the front of the complex is a wall, cistern and access staircase to the former estate, situated on a lower elevation; to the rear of the convent there is still a worked, rectangular po√ßo de mar√©, of great depths;Today the well is actually part of another property-owner's land, and does not pertain to the current Convent grounds and the grounds are landscaped by various trees (including Metrosideros and an Araucaria). Still on the grounds, is a more recent monument from the people of Pico dedicated to Jo√£o Bento do Lima. The monastic structure consists of a long two-story horizontal facade with a three-story church abutting its western wall, and adjacent bodies characteristic of its role as convent. Behind and hidden by the facade are the convents dependencies and cloister; in the building are still remnants of the ancient refectory, monks' cells and other installations. The kitchen, of grande dimensions, was completely destroyed. The main floor of the church consists of three Roman Arches and doors (two to the interior of the church and one to the belfry) surmounted by four windows on the second register. The church structure is topped off by a bell-tower and triangular pediment with niche holding the image of Saint Francis of Assisi, and surmounted by a cross. The three storeys are separated by horizontal bands of stone, with the corners, frames, lateral limits, cornices, pilasters and pedestals finished in stone, while the walls are plastered and whitewashed. =Cloister= In the centre of its rectangular cloister is a Christian pillory, consisting of a pillar, pedestal and base with four steps in concentric circles. On either side of the cloister are five Roman arches, with the middle arch representing the passage to the cloister's patio. The arches and pilars are in worked stone, as is the pavement. =Church= The church has one nave with high choir and stacidia (choir stall), a pulpit, two lateral altars and presbytery all designed and completed in carved woods. The pulpit sits on a stone base and is carved in wood, with an overhanging wood decoration completed in gilded wood. Under the pulpit, are low relief carvings in stone with convent's heraldry. On the same wall as this pulpit are three confessionals with entrance from the cloister. The two lateral altars and presbytery are decorated in Baroque-era gilded wood, while the roofs consist of painted wood in vegetal designs. The walls of the prebystery present two grand panels of polychromatic azulejo tile, while a stone-worked baptismal fountain completes the utilitarian aspects of the church. Although the church and convent are dedicated to S√£o Pedro de Alc√¢ntara, the main altar displays an image of the Assumption of the Virgin, surrounded by a gilded wood decorations comparable to the Matriz Church of Horta, on which this was likely based. In the sacristy is a grande armorie constructed of Jacaranda wood imported from Brazil.

The library did not survive and was forced to close within the year. In the 1930s local communists advocated for a Municipal Library - as well as Home-Help - but the Council was very anti-communist at the time and due to their perception of the group who advocated the library, in addition to the expense, they rejected the idea of a library.St Kilda The Show Goes On, The History of St Kilda Volume III, By Anne Longmire, 1989 The Free Library Board proposed the creation of a library in 1947 but again it was dismissed. In April 1953 the St Kilda Library Promotion Committee was formed with R.S. Veale as President, and Mrs Elizabeth Hogg, a teacher living in Carlisle Street, as Secretary. However, the Council once again rejected the arguments for a library, with the Town Clerk even re-iterating the reasons against it in the centenary booklet: \\"it would cost thousands of pounds per year to operate and, generally speaking, would provide mostly books of fiction and thus come into active competition with a large number of Lending Library businesses established in St Kilda.\\" The Council even later introduced new arguments against the community's wishes for a library, stating that a library would encourage the reading of fiction which, in turn, would encourage juvenile delinquency. Parents at the Nelson Street kindergarten got together and formed the St Kilda Library Establishment Committee with TAA pilot Ivan Scown as President, former librarian Jenny Love as Secretary and Angela Pedicini as Treasurer. The Committee persuaded the Council to request that the Free Library Services Board conduct a Library Survey in St Kilda. The report, presented in 1961, recommended the creation of a library but similar to the past, the St Kilda Council refused. The Council's opposition to the library was broken when Ivan Trayling was elected as Councillor in 1967. Trayling had campaigned very vocally on the need for a library and after winning the election the Council realised the amount of community dissatisfaction on its stance against the library and decided to go ahead with its creation. The Council set aside $50,000 in 1967 and asked Barrett Reid, the Executive Officer of the Library Services Division of the Library Council of Victoria, to revise the 1961 survey. A library sub-committee was formed in mid 1969, which was the first St Kilda council committee to include community representatives as advisory members. Ivan Trayling headed it as Chairman, with other committee members being Cr. Hall-Kenny, Cr. Manning, Cr. Clark, Jenny Love, Reverend Brother F.I. McCarthy, Bernard Rechter and Deputy Town Clerk Bill Sisson. Enrico Taglietti was appointed as the architect and in December 1971 he accepted a tender on behalf of the Council from the M. Notkin Construction Company of Caulfield South, for the amount of $417,000 to build the library at 150 Carlisle Street. The library's foundation stone was laid in August 1972 by the now mayor Ivan Trayling and on 14 May 1973 Sir Rohan Delacombe, Governor of Victoria, officially opened the library, in what has since become a local landmark. Commander R.S. Veale, the original Chairman of the Library Promotion Committee, was invited on 15 May 1973 to borrow the first book and chose a biography of Wilfrid Kent-Hughes. Between 1992 and 1994, an extension was added by Melbourne architecture firm Ashton Raggatt McDougall (ARM) which provided a new entrance wing as well as seeking to redefine the public plaza and fa√ßade of the library facing onto Carlisle Street.Ashton Raggatt McDougall Pty Ltd. 1995, St Kilda Public Library extension, Transition, (47), pp. 32-35, ISSN number 0157-7344 Significance Taglietti's design is described by architect and author Richard Peterson as having an ‚Äúunconstrained‚Äù and ‚Äústylised‚Äù character that is ‚Äúcomfortably settled‚Äù in its context. In 2007, Taglietti who was born in Milan, was awarded the prestigious Gold Medal by The Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA). The jury cited his ‚ÄúAustralian architectural vision as seen through Italian eyes‚Äù making him ‚Äúan outstanding architect of national significance‚Äù.Favaro, P, Tanner, H, Taylor, J and Tadi, M 2007 Enrico Taglietti: building the invisible city, Architecture Australia, 96(2), pp. 90-105, ISSN number 0003-8725 As a testament to the community's engagement, in the 2012/2013 financial year over 365,000 visitors used the St Kilda Library services. Physical description and function Front Elevation of St Kilda Library Taglietti's building houses the library, a meeting room and additional community facilities. ARM's extension provided what the firm describe as an ‚Äúupgrade of existing facilities, providing additional book stacks, main desk, entry and public face‚Äù. Wedged between the busy public Carlisle Street to the South and the residential Duke Street in the North the building takes up nearly 50 square metres. The ground floor of the library is raised above street level one metre high and is accessed via a ramp through the entry wing of the ARM extension. The building also contains parking and a plant room underground, with entry via Duke Street.Taglietti, E & Tadi, E 1979, Enrico Taglietti : architect in Australia, Lodigraf, Milano, Italy The library is constructed from a minimal selection of materials-concrete construction with timber detailing. The concrete is left in an exposed unfinished state, ‚Äúeither bush-hammered or revealing the lines of its timber board formwork‚Äù. ‚ÄúUntreated softwood‚Äù timber boards are used for the roof, eaves, ceiling, window frames and an internal ‚Äúpyramidal roof‚Äù. Taglietti's design makes use of horizontal planes in the thick continuous ground slab and cantilevered roof above, which extend out beyond the inclined walls. Taglietti has employed light, scale and screens to differentiate between areas of varying program in library. This is evident in the children's section where the bookshelves are reduced versions of those throughout the library and colourful lights are hung about 1.8 metres above the floor. The building is widely considered to be of Brutalist design. Richard Peterson identifies characteristics of the building pertaining to this style as its use of unfinished timber and concrete revealing the lines of its formwork as well as the overemphasis of particular components of the building, specifically in the ‚Äúdeep fascias and spandrels‚Äù. ARM describe their extension as the image of a ‚Äúbluestone clad book‚Äù invoking the role of books in libraries through the symbolism of its curving bluestone form. The inclusion of an s-profiled window is the architects‚Äô reference to the emergence of electronic technology in the place of the hard copy book with its screen-like appearance.Ashton Raggatt McDougall [St Kilda Library and Town Hall, accessed 2012-04-15, ] Key influences and design approach Similarities are noted between the Brutalist architectural style of the St Kilda library and the work of architect Le Corbusier, particularly in the expression of unfinished concrete and ‚Äúoversized elements‚Äù. Peterson draws further links to architect Carlo Scarpa who shares Taglietti's Italian tradition and whose influences can be seen in ‚Äúthe use of natural materials and the layered platforms, which stratify the meeting of the building and its site‚Äù. The RAIA jury panel cited the use of ‚Äúlong, horizontal flat roofs and balconies, sloping fascias and balustrades, and battered walls‚Äù as overriding motifs in Taglietti's work. ARM describe their intention with the extension to be ‚Äúthe development of a civic space linking the Town Hall and its strong 19th Century fa√ßade with the Taglietti library across the street‚Äù. Awards Taglietti was awarded the 2007 Gold Medal by The Royal Australian Institute of Architects and the jury cited St Kilda Library in its list of Taglietti's ‚ÄúNotable public buildings‚Äù. Ashton Raggatt McDougall received two awards for their extension from The Royal Australian Institute of Architects in 1995. They were a Commendation for Institutional Alterations and Extensions and a Commendation for Interior Architecture.

This Hindu temple is one of the Shakti Peethas. The main festival is Shiva-Chaturdashi (on the 14th moon of March). The Temple as a Shakti Peeth Sati Devi The mythology of Daksha yaga and Sati's self immolation had immense significance in shaping the ancient Sanskrit literature and even had impact on the culture of India. It led to the development of the concept of Shakti Peethas and there by strengthening Shaktism. Enormous mythological stories in puranas took the Daksha yaga as the reason for its origin. It is an important incident in Shaivism resulting in the emergence of Shree Parvati in the place of Sati Devi and making Shiva a grihastashrami (house holder) leading to the origin of Ganapathy and Subrahmanya. Shakti Peethas are shrines or divine places of the Mother Goddess. These are places that are believes to have enshrined with the presence of Shakti due to the falling of body parts of the corpse of Sati Devi, when Lord Shiva carried it and wandered throughout Aryavartha in sorrow. There are 51 Shakti Peeth linking to the 51 alphabets in Sanskrit. Each temple have shrines for Shakti and Kalabhairava and mostly the each temple associates different names to Shakti and Kalabhairava in that temple. Legend Sati, was the first wife of Shiva as the first incarnation of Parvati. She was the daughter of King Daksha and Queen (the daughter of Brahma). She committed self-immolation at the sacrificial fire of a yagna performed by her father Daksha as she felt seriously distraught by her father's insult of her husband and also to her by not inviting both of them for the yagna. Shiva was so grieved after hearing of the death of his wife that he danced around the world in a Tandav Nritya (‚Äúdevastating penance‚Äù or dance of destruction) carrying Sati's dead body over his shoulders. Perturbed by this situation and in order to bring Shiv to a state of normalcy, it was then Vishnu who decided to use his Sudarshan Chakra (the rotating knife s carried on his finger tip). He dismembered Sati's body with the chakra into several pieces and wherever her body fell on the earth, the place was consecrated as a divine shrine oo Shakthi Peeth with deities of Sati (Parvati) and Shiva. These locations have become famous pilgrimage places as Pithas or Shakthi Pithas, and are found scattered all over the subcontinent including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal, apart from India. Sati is also known as Devi or Shakthi, and with blessings of Vishnu she was reborn as the daughter of Himavat or Himalayas and hence named as Parvati (daughter of mountains). She was born on the 14th day of the bright half of the month of Mrigashƒ´rsha, which marks the Shivarathri (Shiva's night) festival.

It was later refurbished and renamed to Here East. History =London Olympics Media Centre= The London Olympics Media Centre (incorporating the International Broadcast Centre and Main Press Centre) in June 2011 At the time of the Olympic bid it was intended that the complex would be privately financed on the basis that the building would have residual value from alternative uses after the games. As of December 2009, the Olympic Delivery Authority had allocated ¬£702 million of Programme and Funders‚Äô contingency, largely to cover the decisions to publicly fund the Village and Media Centre after it became clear private funding could not be secured on acceptable terms during the 2008 to 2010 economic crisis. The complex was a 24-hour media hub that catered for over 20,000 broadcasters, photographers and print journalists facilitating broadcasts to 4 billion people worldwide. It contained an International Broadcast Centre (IBC) and a Main Press Centre (MPC). The design of the complex, which was long, was by Allies and Morrison. It had a catering village and a multi-storey car park to link the two main venues (the IBC and the MPC) together. The construction cost was ¬£355 million and the main contractor was Carillion. It was completed in July 2011. =Legacy= Following the games, the property firm Delancey formed a joint venture with Infinity SDC to convert the Olympic broadcast and press centre into a tech hub for corporations. The joint venture was called iCity, with Laing O'Rourke being appointed to carry out the ¬£150 million redevelopment of the Broadcasting Centre. Consultants Buro Happold provided the engineering design, working in collaboration with architects Hawkins\\\\Brown. The complex was designed to create some of business space as part of the legacy of the games. BT Sport started broadcasting from the centre in August 2013, and has three studios there. In February 2014 the site was renamed Here East. It went on to accommodate campuses for Staffordshire University, Loughborough University and University College London as well as Plexal, a co-working location for start-up businesses.

Arabic Programs Description Programs Types Ali Baba International Center offers two types of programs: regular programs and special programs. A short description of each program is given in what follows. I . Regular programs are offered throughout the year. Two types of regular programs are offered; 1-month group programs, and private programs. A 1-month group program is a package consisting of the followings: a 1-month long intensive Arabic language course, a comfortable accommodation, airport pickup, and an optional tour to a touristic site in Jordan. In the a 1-month group program a student takes 80 hours of Arabic language instruction; 5 times a week, 4-hours each time, for a period of 4 weeks. The 80-hour program is equal to a 4-credit course in most universities. Students wishing to study for longer periods can cover consecutive levels of Arabic. Private regular programs are offered anytime of the year. These programs are more flexible since students can take as many hours as they wish and for the duration they need. For both types of regular programs students may request the type of Arabic language they wish to learn; MSA (Modern Standard Arabic), Media Arabic, or Colloquial Arabic. Elementary, intermediate and advanced classes are opened in each month to meet the demands of people having different backgrounds in Arabic. A placement test will be given to the registered students before the start of the course to determine the level and accordingly the appropriate class they should enroll in. II. Special Programs: a special program is a package consisting of a specialized course in Arabic or a middle eastern or Islamic field, accommodation, and tours around Jordan if desired. The specialized courses are tailored to meet the needs of individuals or groups working in fields like diplomacy, business, culture and others, and therefore may vary in their contents, durations, time of offering, and cost. The following possible special courses can be offered: Special Arabic Courses : individuals or groups may request specialized Arabic courses in certain fields such diplomacy and political science, economics and business, sports or other professional fields. Academic Courses: university students may request undergraduate level courses in Archaeology, Islamic Culture, Arabic Culture or Middle Eastern Studies.

It contains a single species, Gasparinisuchus peirosauroides. Discovery Gasparinisuchus is known only from two individuals. The holotype MOZ 1750 PV represented by partial skull and lower jaws with teeth and various associated postcranial skeleton including vertebrae and dermal plates which are currently missing. It was originally described by Gasparini (1982) and Gasparini et al. (1991) and referred to Peirosaurus torminni. MOZ 1750 PV was found in the Loma de la Lata locality of the Neuqu√©n Province, Patagonia. It was originally reported as collected from sediments of the Rio Colorado Subgroup, Neuqu√©n Group. Later, Hugo and Leanza (2001) noted that this specimen was actually collected from the underlying Portezuelo Formation of the Rio Neuqu√©n Subgroup, Neuqu√©n Group. More recent stratigraphic work on this area identified that horizon as belonging to the younger, Coniacian-age, Plottier Formation of the Rio Neuqu√©n Subgroup. This horizon is currently considered to pertain to the Santonian-age Bajo de la Carpa Formation of the Rio Colorado Subgroup. The referred specimen, PV-CRIDC-12, represented by right premaxilla and maxilla, isolated teeth, and part of the postcranial skeleton. It was originally tentatively referred to P. torminni by Praderio et al. (2009). It was found in the √Årea de Ca√±ad√≥n Amarrillo locality, of the Mendoza Province, Patagonia. It was collected from the slightly younger early Campanian-age Anacleto Formation, also part of the Neuqu√©n Group. Description The type species G. peirosauroides was described and named in 2012 on the basis of MOZ 1750 PV, which was originally referred to Peirosaurus torminni. PV-CRIDC-12 was also excluded from P. torminni and referred to Gasparinisuchus on the basis of similarities to the holotype. The maxilla of PV-CRIDC-12 shares a number of derived features with Gasparinisucus, indicating a tall, broad snout, maxillary teeth implanted in discrete alveoli, a convex alveolar maxillary edge at the level of the third tooth and similar position and relative size of the maxillary teeth. Comprarisons with the holotype of P. torminni are uninformative because the premaxilla of PV-CRIDC-12 is poorly preserved. Gasparinisuchus differs from other peirosaurids in having a broad snout and in lacking an antorbital fenestra. Although overlapping materials between the Gasparinisuchus and P. torminni limited to the premaxilla and the dentition, Gasparinisuchus can be differentiate from Peirosaurus on the basis of its broad, rounded rostrum, anteroposteriorly short premaxilla, reduced perinareal fossa, and short premaxillary interdental spaces. Peirosaurus is known from the late Maastrichtian (latest Cretaceous) of Brazil, and the presence of MOZ 1750 PV in Argentina was originally taken as evidence for a link between Brazilian and Argentinian Late Cretaceous faunas. The removal of MOZ 1750 PV from the genus Peirosaurus suggests that the older Argentinian and younger Brazilian faunas were mostly distinct. The phylogenetic position of MOZ 1750 PV was previously tested in several recent analyses under the taxon name P. torminni. The following cladogram simplified after a comprehensive analysis of notosuchians presented by Alan H. Turner and Joseph J. W. Sertich in 2010. Etymology Gasparinisuchus was first described and named by Agust√≠n G. Martinelli, Joseph J.W. Sertich, Alberto C. Garrido and √Ångel M. Praderio in 2012 and the type species is Gasparinisuchus peirosauroides. The generic name honors the vertebrate paleontologist Zulma Brandoni de Gasparini for her work on South American crocodyliforms, and suchus from the Greek Souchos, which refers to the Egyptian crocodile-headed god Sobek. The specific name is derived from Peirosaurus, the type genus of the Peirosauridae to which specimens of Gasparinisuchus were initially assigned, and from Greek oid meaning form. It refers to the importance of the holotype specimen as the basis for the designation of the Family Peirosauridae by Gasparini (1982).
