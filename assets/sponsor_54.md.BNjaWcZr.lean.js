He is considered one of the most important Mormon playwrights, and has been called a Mormon Charles Dickens or Henrik Ibsen. He won the Association for Mormon Letters (AML) drama award in 1994, 1997, and 1999, and was AML president from 2007 to 2009. In 2012 he received the Smith‚ÄìPettit Foundation Award for Outstanding Contribution to Mormon Letters. Biography Eric Samuelsen was born in Provo, Utah, but spent most of his early life in Bloomington, Indiana. His father Roy was an opera singer, which introduced young Samuelsen to a love for theater productions. As a young man he served in Norway as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He received a bachelor's degree in theatre from BYU in 1983 and returned to Bloomington and earned a Ph.D. from Indiana University in 1991. He taught at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio before joining the faculty at BYU in 1992. From 1999-2011 Samuelsen ran BYU's playwrighting program. Throughout his career, at least 24 of Samuelsen's plays were produced professionally throughout the United States, including California, Indiana, Louisiana, New York, and Utah. Most of Samuelsen's early plays were produced at BYU, but around 2003 he began a relationship with Plan-B Theatre Company. Since 2006, Plan-B premiered a Samuelsen play every year. He became its playwright in residence in 2012, and many of his newer plays were produced there. This may be due to a more controversial bent in later plays; Borderlands has a character who is an openly gay Mormon youth. Following illness and a diagnosis of polymyositis, a degenerative muscular disease, Samuelsen retired from BYU in 2012, where he had taught for 20 years. The next year, Plan-B Theatre Company dedicated 2013 as the \\"Season of Eric\\", presenting four of Samuelsen's plays. Works = 1970s = * Letter From a Prophet, co-written by Charles Metten.

Financed and operated by the Taff Vale Railway, on amalgamation it became part of the Great Western Railway in 1923. Designed and mainly operated as a coal mining freight railway, its creation and demise was wholly defined by the South Wales Coalfield. Design The branch was wholly designed, being developed from integrating a series of private industrial track railways with the extension of the Taff Vale Railway from the south at . In 1840, the TVR bought the private Ferndale to Maerdy colliery track, and then extended to it from from 1849. Operations Passenger operations began in 1875, serving interim stations from Porth at (opened 1876), Pontygwaith, Tylorstown, and Ferndale. Though the line had opened up to Maerdy the same year (with the sinking & commissioning of Mardy Colliery), it was not until 1889 that the passenger service was extended there from Ferndale. Passenger traffic was neither heavy nor a major contribution to line finances, and so in 1900 the GWR introduced steam rail motors. Ten or eleven return trips each weekday was the standard service frequency for the branch for most of its life. Closure The last passenger train ran on 13 June 1964 as a result of the Beeching cuts, leaving only the freight service to Mardy Colliery.\\"Dr Beeching's Axe: 50 Years on : Illustrated Memories of Britain's Lost Railways\\"; Holland, Julian; David & Charles (21 February 2013), , p.122 As a result, the line was reduced to single track working. The line was placed into maintenance only upkeep from June 1986 and subsequently closed completely in August that year, after the coal mined at Mardy was raised at Tower Colliery. Present day The track was lifted in 1996, with the trackbed and most of the bridges left in situ. This formed the canal section of the Taff Trail cycle route. In 2004, Rhondda Cynon Taff council came to an arrange with Network Rail to buy the trackbed from just north of Maerdy Junction to Margaret Street, Pontygwaith and convert it into a relief road for Ynyshir. Construction work started in May 2005, removing the remains of Ynyshir station, the bridges at Llanwonno road and Station street, and the replacement of the Rhondda Fach bridge at Ynyshir and the Ynyshir road bridge. Today the A4233 Porth and Lower Rhondda Fach Relief Road (Porth Bypass), has meant a significant decrease in traffic flows through the main street, Ynyshir Road.http://demos.constructingexcellence.org.uk/userimages/Image322.pdf In April 2019, a local group of enthusiasts looking to improve the local economic outlook by bringing tourists to the area, proposed reinstating the 3 miles of track north of Tylorstown to Meardy. The proposal includes reinstatement of some stations and former industrial buildings.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- wales-48068676 References Taff Vale Railway Mining railways Railway lines in Wales Railway lines opened in 1875 Railway lines closed in 1964 ","title":"Maerdy Branch"},{"id":"30173485","title":"Ferndale Colliery"},{"id":"30173519","text":"This sets forth a timeline of the War in Somalia during 2008. ; 5 February * Bosaso bombings. 25 Ethiopian civilians killed ; 2 March * Missile attack on Dobley. 6 Somali civilians killed ; 19‚Äì20 April * Battle of Mogadishu. 11 Ethiopian soldiers, 7 Somali soldiers, 10 insurgents, and 98 civilians killed * Hidaya Mosque massacre. 11 Somali civilians killed ; 1 May * Dhusamareb airstrike. 2 Somali soldiers, 6 insurgents, 5 civilians killed ; 1‚Äì26 July * Battle of Beledweyne. 50 Ethiopian soldiers, 39-75 insurgents, 22 civilians killed ; 20‚Äì22 August * Battle of Kismayo. 89 people killed  Incumbents  * President: Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed (until 29 December), Adan Mohamed Nuur Madobe (starting 29 December) * Prime Minister: Nur Hassan Hussein  See also  *Somalia War (2006‚Äì2009) *Somali Civil War (2009‚Äìpresent) *2006 timeline of the War in Somalia *2007 timeline of the War in Somalia *2009 timeline of the War in Somalia References Years of the 21st century in Somalia 2000s in Somalia Somalia Somalia ","title":"2008 in Somalia"},{"id":"30173576","text":"Marshall McDiarmid Williams (February 21, 1893 ‚Äì February 22, 1935) nicknamed \\"Cap\\", was a pitcher in Major League Baseball.

He played college football for the Washington Huskies. Despite being considered a top running back prospect for the 2012 NFL Draft, he went undrafted due to concerns over a potentially degenerative shoulder condition. He signed with the Philadelphia Eagles as an undrafted free agent in 2012. High school career Polk played at Redlands East Valley High School in Redlands, California. Rated the #4 all-purpose back in the nation, Polk led his team to a 12-1 record and to the Inland Division semifinals in 2007. During his senior season Polk had a game in which he rushed for 214 yards on only 5 carries. Polk earned first-team All-CIF Southern Section Inland Division honors as well as being named a SuperPrep All-American his senior season. College career Polk enrolled early at the University of Washington in January 2008. He played in the first two games of the season before being injured and missing the rest of the season. Although he qualified for a medical redshirt for the 2008 season, he never applied and sat out the remainder of the season. Polk became the starting running back in 2009 and also worked as a kick returner. He rushed for 1,113 yards on 226 attempts and five touchdowns after playing in all 12 games of the season. He had four consecutive 100-yard games, which is third in school history. He earned honorable mention All-Pac-10 honors and freshman All-Pac-10 first-team honors. Polk played in all 13 games at running back in 2010, and recorded 1,415 yards and nine touchdowns on 260 attempts. In a game against Washington State, he rushed for a career-high 284 yards and two touchdowns on 29 attempts.

Professional career =Pre-draft= =Philadelphia Eagles= Polk signed as an undrafted free agent with the Philadelphia Eagles on April 28, 2012. The Sporting News called Polk the top undrafted player of the 2012 NFL Draft. It is believed that injury concerns led to Polk's not being drafted. He made the team and was the 4th string running back all season. In his second season, after third string running back Dion Lewis was traded to the Browns, Polk made more of an impact for the Eagles, rushing for 98 yards on the season, including three touchdowns. He ran for a career-high 50 yards on four carries in a week 14 win over the Detroit Lions. He finished fifth on the team in rushing yards (98), behind LeSean McCoy, Bryce Brown, Michael Vick and Nick Foles.

His best game rushing was against the Cowboys in Philadelphia, where he scored two touchdowns on two carries in a 27-38 loss. He finished with 172 yards rushing and 340 returning on only 11 returns, with 5 all-purpose touchdowns. Despite only having 46 carries, Polk finished third in both rushing yards (172) and rushing touchdowns (4), behind Lesean McCoy (1,319, 5) and newly acquired Darren Sproles (329, 6). Polk was given a restricted free agent tender after the 2014 season, but on April 24, 2015, the team rescinded the tender, making him an unrestricted free agent. =Houston Texans= Polk signed a one-year deal with the Houston Texans on April 28, 2015. With injuries holding starter Arian Foster to only 4 games, Polk was given more opportunities on the Texans as their backup running back. Polk played in 15 games and started 2, recording 99 carries for 334 yards and a touchdown, as well as 16 catches for 109 yards and his first career receiving touchdown.

Thomas Thomson, a portrait by Robert Scott Lauder Life Thomas Thomson was born in Dailly manse on 10 November 1768, the eldest son of Rev Thomas Thomson, minister of Dailly in Ayrshire, and his second wife, Mary, daughter of Francis Hay. John Thomson was a younger brother. After attending the parish school of Dailly, he entered the University of Glasgow at age 13, where he graduated with an MA on 27 April 1789. He attended classes in theology and law at the University of Edinburghfrom 1789 to 1791. He passed the Scottish bar as an advocate on 10 December 1793. His early Edinburgh address was 19 North Castle Street.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1805 Here he was a neighbour and close friend to Walter Scott, at that time also a fellow advocate. Thomson acquired a practice at the bar, particularly in cases demanding legal learning. Legal and historical antiquities later absorbed his attention. His main role was deputy clerk-register of Scotland, a new post to which he was appointed on 30 June 1806. His work mainly consisted of reforming the system of public registries and the method of the custody of records, in rendering these records accessible to research, in rescuing and repairing old records, and in editing the acts of the Scottish parliament and other governmental records under the authority of the Record Commission. In 1807 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were John Playfair, Sir James Hall and Thomas Allan. He served as Secretary to the Society from 1812 to 1820. In February 1828 Thomson was chosen one of the principal clerks of the court of session. On the institution of the Bannatyne Club in 1823 he had been chosen vice-president, and on the death of Scott in 1832 he succeeded as president. Thomson, however, was lax on finance. After an inquiry into the accounts of the register office in 1839 he was removed from the office of deputy clerk-register. At this time he was living at 127 George Street in Edinburgh. Medallion head of Thomas Thomson in Dean Cemetery Thomson died at Shrub Hill House, Leith Walk, Edinburgh, on 2 October 1852. He is buried in Dean Cemetery in the section known as \\"Lord's Row\\".

He is notable for his compositions and for his role in publishing the complete works of his younger brother Franz Schubert. He received training in piano and violin from his father, Franz Theodor Schubert, and his older brother Ignaz, later from Michael Wood, and finally from the public teacher of the choir of St. Anna, Joseph Drechsler.Ernst Hilmar: Ferdinand Schuberts Skizze zu einer Autobiographie. In: Schubert-Studien, Vienna 1978, S. 86‚Äì117 As a boy, Ferdinand played violin in the Schubert family string quartet, with his brothers Franz and Ignaz on viola and violin and his father on cello. Franz Schubert composed many of his early string quartets for this ensemble. Career In 1810, Schubert became organist at the Lichtentaler Parish and was also assistant teacher at an orphanage in Vienna. Four years later, in 1816, he was promoted to full-time teacher at the orphanage. In that year, Schubert married one of his students, Anna. In 1818, Franz Schubert composed the German Requiem D621 for Ferdinand, which Ferdinand would later publish and for which he would take credit as his own composition.The life of Schubert By Christopher Howard Gibbs, Pg 54, Cambridge University Press In 1820, Schubert became a teacher and choirmaster in Altlerchenfeld.

His two marriages produced a total of 29 children, of whom 12 survived to adulthood. In 1838, he became an honorary professor of organ at the Conservatory. Since he was admired in professional circles for his outstanding work as a school administrator, he received the post of director of the normal primary school at St. Anna in 1851. Ferdinand kept a considerable part of the musical estate of Franz Schubert. With the exception of certain operas, masses, and symphonies, he sold the bulk of Franz Schubert's compositions to Anton Diabelli after Franz's death in 1828. Diabelli's firm published the catalog over the course of the next 30 years, even after Diabelli's death.AllMusic.com Ferdinand also wrote numerous educational journals and a number of sacred compositions and smaller pieces for school use.

In a comedy of errors, she is mistaken for a famous dancer, which results in her heading the cast of a star-studded musical. The plot acts as a backdrop for this musical revue film, which includes many German film, sports, and entertainment stars of the 1930s. Background Es leuchten die Sterne was a remake of the 1930 Tobis film Die Gro√üe Sehnsucht (The Great Yearning), directed by Stefan Szekely, a Hungarian Jew. The remake was created as a Busby Berkeley-style musical set inside a movie studio, and featured appearances by numerous stage personalities, athletes, and Tobis Films stars. Joseph Goebbels was Propaganda Minister and considered entertainment films to be the best type of media with which to convey the political message of the Nazi regime. Es leuchten die Sterne was created, as were many German films of the period, to act as a propaganda piece promoting the Third Reich as a cultural entity. =Release= The film was first released in Germany on 17 March 1938. This was followed by a release in the Netherlands on 29 April, and then in the United States on 20 May as The Stars Shine. It was released in various countries under different titles: in Belgium as Als de sterren schitteren (Flemish) and as Quand les √©toiles brillent (French); in Italy as Brillano le stelle; in Denmark as Funklende stjerner; in Greece as Lampoun t' asteria; in France as Les √©toiles brillent and as Vedettes follies; and in the Netherlands as Parade der sterren and Sterrenparade. The film was released on DVD in its original German version on 21 July 2008 by Warner Home Video. Excerpts from the film were shown on German television in 1938, with La Jana present in the studio.

The feminine form of the surname is NicMhuirich. The masculine form translates into English as \\"son of Muireach\\", and the feminine name translates as \\"daughter of MacMhuirich\\". The personal name Muireach means \\"mariner\\". The surname has been borne by a noted Hebridean family of bards, who claimed descent from an early 13th- century Irish bard. Etymology The Scottish Gaelic MacMhuirich is a masculine surname. It originated as a patronym, meaning \\"son of Muireach\\", although the surname no longer refers to the father of the bearer. The personal name Muireach is a form of the Irish Muireadhach. These names are derived from the element muir, meaning \\"sea\\"., which cited: , for the surname \\"Murdoch\\". The names have been generally translated into English as \\"mariner\\"; for example, George Fraser Black translated the names as \\"belonging to the sea\\". According to Black, these personal names are much confused with the name Murchadh, which has been translated into English as \\"sea warrior\\" and \\"sea battler\\". Feminine form The feminine form of MacMhuirich is NicMhuirich. This feminine name is composed of the prefix Nic-, which is an abbreviated form of the Scottish Gaelic nighean mhic or n√¨ mhic, which translates into English as \\"daughter of the son\\"; thus NicMhuirich translates as \\"daughter of MacMhuirich\\" Anglicised forms The Scottish Gaelic MacMhuirich has been Anglicised as MacVurich. The phonetics on the Isle of Arran are such that MacMhuirich was pronounced \\"Ac Uiri\\" and \\"Ac Fuiri\\" due to elision; thus the Scottish Gaelic surname has also been Anglicised as Currie. The surname MacMhuirich has also been Anglicised as Macpherson, due to a confusion of clan-names borne by separate families (see below). Families The surname was borne by the noted family of bards, Clann MacMhuirich or Clann Mhuirich, who claimed descent from Muireadhach Albanach, an early 13th-century Irishman who settled in Scotland and was himself employed as a bard. According to Black, who wrote in the mid 20th century, some relations of this family currently bear the surname Macpherson. The confusion arose from the fact that the Macphersons from Badenoch, commonly known in English as \\"Clan Macpherson\\", are also traditionally known in Scottish Gaelic as Clann Mhuirich.

Established in 1816 and initially completed on the Georgia bank of the Savannah River in 1819, it was moved to the former Belle Vue estate in the Summerville neighborhood of Augusta in 1827 due to health concerns after several fever epidemics. Early history The Belle Vue estate was established by George and Eliza Talbot Walker. It was the birthplace of their granddaughter, Octavia Walton Le Vert in 1811. George later sold Belle Vue to his brother, Freeman Walker, for use as a summer estate. Freeman Walker sold the property, with the exception of one acre that contained the Walker Family Cemetery, to the United States government for $6,000 in 1826. The arsenal was moved to the new location the following year, with four large brick buildings connected by a twenty-two inch thick wall completed in 1829. Troops from the arsenal took part in various campaigns involving the Cherokee, Muscogee, and Seminole tribes and took part in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Civil War The expanded Augusta Arsenal in the first decade of the 20th century. Following the secession of Georgia from the Union, then governor, Joseph E. Brown, visited the arsenal on January 23, 1861 and demanded that the commander, Arnold Elzey surrender the facility to the state. Elzey initially refused. 600 citizens of Augusta then volunteered for militia duty based on rumors that the state was going to take the arsenal from Elzey and his small contingent of 82 soldiers. Brown gave Elzey a second chance to surrender the facility, demanding an answer by 9 o'clock the next morning. After notifying his superiors of the situation via telegraph, Elzey turned the arsenal over to the state the next day. By summer 1861, the Confederate Chief of Ordnance, Josiah Gorgas, determined to greatly expand the arsenal around the original nucleus. His plans included building a \\"great arsenal of construction where ammunition, field and siege artillery projectiles and ordnance stores in general [would] be made in large quantities.\\" April 1862 saw the arsenal placed under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Washington Rains. He was also put in charge of erecting the enormous Confederate Powderworks, which he placed at the 1816 arsenal site. The arsenal produced large quantities of war materiel from 1863 to 1865. The arsenal was under threat in November 1864 during Sherman's March to the Sea, with equipment prepared for evacuation until the Union Army turned toward Savannah. In the end, the arsenal was surrendered back to Federal control when Union troops entered Augusta on May 3, 1865. The Augusta Arsenal is still the home to three Confederate \\"12-pounder Napoleon\\" cannons. Two of the cannons are displayed at the front and rear of Payne Hall, which is the original arsenal headquarters building, and a third is displayed outside the original arsenal guardhouse. The arsenal guardhouse was erected in 1866 to guard the entrance to the arsenal. In 2004 it was converted to a small museum that displays dozens of artifacts, photographs, and various items uncovered during archeological excavations of the area. The arsenal military cemetery, adjacent to the Walker Family cemetery, houses the graves of forty- eight soldiers, twelve women, and ten children, along with a few unidentified graves, dating back to 1841. Later history The Stephen Vincent Ben√©t House in 2008. The arsenal was a valuable asset for the war effort during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. It manufactured various types of equipment and served as a supply and repair point. During World War I the arsenal served as a center for the repair of small arms. Following minimum staffing after close of World War I, World War II saw activity at the site increase enormously, with the construction of roughly fifty new buildings. Primary activities were directed at maintenance and supply of weapons and ammunition, with over 1000 people working at the arsenal. The arsenal remained in operation until 1955, at which point the decision was made to close it. Most of the property was given to the Georgia Board of Education. It was converted into the Junior College of Augusta in 1957. The name was changed to Augusta College in 1958, and later as Augusta State University. In 2012, Augusta State University merged with Georgia Health Sciences University to become Georgia Regents University. After much public and alumni discontent, the school was renamed Augusta University in 2015. The arsenal commandant's house, one of the original four arsenal buildings, is now known as the Stephen Vincent Ben√©t House. It was designated as a National Historic Landmark on November 11, 1971. Noted poet and novelist Stephen Vincent Ben√©t lived here when his father, Colonel James Walker Ben√©t commanded the Augusta Arsenal from 1911 to 1919. The house later served as the President's House of Augusta College.

After graduating from the Northwestern University School of Law, Terrin worked briefly as a prosecutor, then served in various positions with the American administration in the Philippines, most notably working as primary staff aide and legal advisor to Governor-General of the Philippines Dwight F. Davis. During the 1930s, he worked in the US Department of War and taught at the Army War College, then moved to Kenya. After American entry into World War II, he moved to Australia, where he worked with the American Embassy to coordinate operations and from 1945‚Äì1948, he held a position with the US administration in Japan. After leaving Japan, he practiced law in Chicago until his retirement in 1954. He died at his home on June 3, 1958 of natural causes. Early life Terrin was born January 8, 1890 in Joliet, Illinois. His father, John Terrin, was a lawyer who served as a major in the US Army during the American Civil War. Terrin's father encouraged him to pursue a military career and encouraged him to read the classics of military history, but Terrin was most interested in becoming a lawyer. He studied at Northwestern University, graduating with a law degree in 1914. He worked for approximately a year as a prosecutor in Cook County, Illinois then, at the recommendation of one of his former law professors, decided to take a job with the American administration in the Philippines. Service in the Philippines Terrin arrived in the Philippines in November 1915, working as a criminal prosecutor in Cebu until 1917. With American entry into World War I, Terrin considered joining the military, but decided to remain in the Philippines. He was then asked to serve as the legal advisor for an American delegation to Siam, aimed at convincing the country to enter the war on the American side. The delegation helped secure Siamese entry, and Terrin remained in the country to help settle issues related to the disposition of seized German property. Terrin left Siam in October 1918 to become chief counsel to the Senate of the Philippines. He held the job until 1921 when he took two years to travel in French Indochina. While in Indochina, Terrin learned to speak Vietnamese and researched the Vietnamese revolt against China under Le Loi in the 14th Century, intending to write a book on the subject. He never finished the book, but published a series of articles analyzing it. In October 1923, Terrin returned to the United States for the first time in almost 8 years. He practiced law in Chicago and married Alice Young in May 1924, before returning to the Philippines as a senior official in the Justice Ministry in Manila. In 1927, he returned to the southern part of the country, training lawyers and serving as a senior prosecutor in Mindanao. In July 1929, the incoming Governor-General, Dwight F. Davis asked Terrin to become his senior staff aide and legal advisor. Terrin held the job until Davis's departure in January 1932. Life in 1930s After Davis's departure, Terrin again visited Vietnam, spending six months trying to complete his book, but he remained unsatisfied with his efforts. In October 1932, he moved to Washington, D.C. to take a position within the Department of War. He left the job in 1934 to take a teaching position at the Army War College, where he lectured on Asia. After three years at the Army War College, Terrin accepted an invitation from the Japanese government to visit the country as part of a Japanese effort to promote good relations with the United States. During his time in Japan, he met Richard Harper, a wealthy Australian businessman with substantial concerns in Kenya. At Harper's urging, Terrin moved to Kenya, initially managing Harper's enterprises, then working for British banking interests in the country. World War II After the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Terrin adopted an active anti-Axis stance and worked with British officials in Kenya on defense plans while also writing to his friends and former colleagues in the American military to urge preparation for what he saw as inevitable American entry into the conflict. Some of his proposals, including the possibility of cooperation with Japan, were profoundly misguided, but a number of Terrin's military ideas would later prove useful to American commanders, many of whom had studied under him at the War College. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Terrin looked for ways to be of service to the US military and in early 1942 he moved from Kenya to Australia. In Australia, Terrin held no formal position, but he used his personal connections to serve as an informal link between the United States and Australia, cooperating closely with the American Embassy. He also wrote a series of dispatches on the war in the Pacific for the Chicago Sun and became known in Australian circles as a clever military theorist and strategist. During 1943, he was approached by agents of the Office of Strategic Services about the possibility of helping coordinate insurgent actions in Southeast Asia, given his significant local knowledge, but declined citing his advanced age and important informal diplomatic role. Japan and later life After the end of the war, Terrin took a senior position in the American occupation of Japan, assisting in legal reform efforts. His work laid the foundation for several areas of Japanese law, but was largely finished by 1948, when he left the country for the United States. From 1948 until 1954, Terrin practiced law in Chicago and wrote a long monograph on World War II in Southeast Asia. A thorough perfectionist, Terrin was never sufficiently satisfied with the manuscript to publish it, but he shared it with several historians and his work remains highly regarded among historians of the region. Terrin retired from legal practice in 1954 and continued to perfect his manuscripts on Le Loi and World War Two, but never considered either one finished. In 1956, he accepted an invitation from the government of the Philippines to deliver several lectures and visited Asia for the final time, stopping in several other countries during the course of his trip. Terrin died June 3, 1958 at his home in Chicago. References *\\"Obituary: Richard Terrin\\". The Chicago Sun-Times.

It was released in Japanese theaters on May 1, 2010 and later released on Blu-ray Disc and DVD on August 27, 2010 by Pony Canyon. Plot Shortly after entering high school, Konoha Inoue (Miyu Irino) is recruited into the literature club by Tohko Amano (Kana Hanazawa), the president and sole member of the club, after he witnesses her ripping out a page of a book and eating it. Instead of eating actual food, Tohko can only eat stories by consuming the paper they are printed on. Konoha spends his days after school writing short stories for Tohko as \\"snacks\\". Tohko had previously set up a birdhouse on the school grounds so anyone could ask the literature club to help them in matters of love by submitting letters. Tohko and Konoha find a piece of paper in the birdhouse one day, but there is only a childish illustration on it. Tohko recognizes the drawing to be from the original manuscript of Kenji Miyazawa's poem \\"Songs of a Defeated Young Man\\". When Tohko finds the same image in the birdhouse five days in a row, they decide to stake out the scene at night, and they find Chia Takeda (Aki Toyosaki), a friend of Konoha's classmate Nanase Kotobuki (Nana Mizuki). She tells Konoha that the pictures are from Miu Asakura (Aya Hirano). After New Years, Konoha goes to see Nanase in the hospital, who had fallen down the stairs. There, he finds Nanase confronting Miu, who had previously attempted to kill herself when she and Konoha were in junior high school. This was due in part to Konoha winning a new author's contest with his novel Similar to the Sky, which he wrote under the pen name Miu Inoue. Miu had wanted to enter and win, though in the end she only sent in blank sheets to make Konoha believe she had participated. Miu eventually tells Konoha that she hates him. Later, she escapes from the hospital, and Konoha goes to find her at the roof of their junior high school, where she had tried to kill herself. After explaining her reasons for doing so(that she wants Konoha to herself since she has no one but him and he has left her alone). She influences Konoha to jump from the roof with her to which he agrees. Just as they are about to fall, Tohko arrives and Konoha manages to prevent Miu from jumping. However, back on street level, Miu jumps in front of a truck and gets hit. Afterward, Miu seemingly believes to be a third grader and has lost most mobility in her arms and legs. Konoha had dropped school in order to take care of Miu always and also resignes from the literature club, to which Tohko replies she'll be waiting for his stories(as he decides never to write again).In the hospital, it is out screened that Miu has been acting as a mentally affected person for Konoha(by Nanase). Tohko takes them to a planetarium and draws parallels between Konoha and Miu and the main characters in Similar to the Sky. Miu had always wanted to make people happy because her parents were always fighting as she grew up. Konoha tells Miu that he wrote the novel to tell her how much he loved her. Realizing that someone had loved her, Miu apologizes for everything she did to Konoha. When he realizes Tohko has disappeared, Konoha races to the train station and finds her there. She tells him that she got accepted to the university in Hokkaid≈ç and that she can no longer eat his stories anymore. On the train, Tohko explains that she wants him to become everyone's author instead of keeping him all to herself. After Konoha departs the train, they have a final goodbye kiss and Tohko departs on the train.

Cloud products using OpenNebula include ClassCat, HexaGrid, NodeWeaver, Impetus, and ZeroNines. Development OpenNebula follows a rapid release cycle to improve user satisfaction by rapidly delivering features and innovations based on user requirements and feedback. In other words, giving customers what they want more quickly, in smaller increments, while additionally increasing technical quality. Major upgrades generally occur every 3-5 years and each upgrade generally has 3-5 updates. The OpenNebula project is mainly open-source and possible thanks to the active community of developers and translators supporting the project. Since version 5.12 the upgrade scripts are under a closed source license, which makes upgrading between versions impossible without a subscription unless you can prove you are operating a non-profit cloud or made a significant contribution to the project. =Release History= *Version TP and TP2, technology previews, offered host and VM management features, based on Xen hypervisor. *Version 1.0 was the first stable release, introduced KVM and EC2 drivers, enabling hybrid clouds. *Version 1.2 added new structure for the documentation and more hybrid functionality. *Version 1.4 added public cloud APIs on top of oned to build public cloud and virtual network management. *Version 2.0 added mysql backend, LDAP authentication, management of images and virtual networks. *Version 2.2 added integration guides, ganglia monitoring and OCCI (converted as add-ons in later releases), Java bindings for the API and the Sunstone GUI. *Version 3.0 added a migration path from previous versions, VLAN, ebtables and OVS integration for virtual networks, ACLs and accounting subsystem, VMware driver, Virtual Data Centers and federation across data centers. *Version 3.2 added firewalling for VMs (deprecated later on by security groups). *Version 3.4 introduced iSCSI datastore, cluster as a first class citizen and quotas. *Version 3.6 added Virtual Routers, LVM datastores and the public OpenNebula marketplace integration. *Version 3.8 added the OneFlow components for service management and OneGate for application insight. *Version 4.0 added support for Ceph and Files datastore and the onedb tool. *Version 4.2 added a new self service portal (Cloud View) and VMFS datastore. *Version 4.4 released in 2014, brought a number of innovations in Open Cloud, improved cloud bursting, and implemented the use of multiple system datastores for storage load policies. * Version 4.6 allowed users to have different instances of OpenNebula in geographically dispersed and different data centers, this was known as the Federation of OpenNebula.

Internal architecture =Basic components= OpenNebula Internal Architecture * Host: Physical machine running a supported hypervisor. * Cluster: Pool of hosts that share datastores and virtual networks. * Template: Virtual Machine definition. * Image: Virtual Machine disk image. * Virtual Machine: Instantiated Template. A Virtual Machine represents one life-cycle, and several Virtual Machines can be created from a single Template. * Virtual Network: A group of IP leases that VMs can use to automatically obtain IP addresses. It allows the creation of Virtual Networks by mapping over the physical ones. They will be available to the VMs through the corresponding bridges on hosts. Virtual network can be defined in three different parts: # Underlying of physical network infrastructure. # The logical address space available (IPv4, IPv6, dual stack). # Context attributes (e.g. net mask, DNS, gateway). OpenNebula also comes with a Virtual Router appliance to provide networking services like DHCP, DNS etc. Components and Deployment Model OpenNebula Deployment Model The OpenNebula Project's deployment model resembles classic cluster architecture which utilizes * A front-end (master node) * Hypervisor enabled hosts (worker nodes) * Datastores * A physical network =Front-end machine= The master node, sometimes referred to as the front-end machine, executes all the OpenNebula services. This is the actual machine where OpenNebula is installed. OpenNebula services on the front-end machine include the management daemon (oned), scheduler (sched), the web interface server (Sunstone server), and other advanced components. These services are responsible for queuing, scheduling, and submitting jobs to other machines in the cluster. The master node also provides the mechanisms to manage the entire system. This includes adding virtual machines, monitoring the status of virtual machines, hosting the repository, and transferring virtual machines when necessary. Much of this is possible due to a monitoring subsystem which gathers information such as host status, performance, and capacity use. The system is highly scalable and is only limited by the performance of the actual server. =Hypervisor enabled-hosts= The worker nodes, or hypervisor enabled-hosts, provide the actual computing resources needed for processing all jobs submitted by the master node. OpenNebula hypervisor enabled-hosts use a virtualization hypervisor such as Vmware, Xen, or KVM. The KVM hypervisor is natively supported and used by default. Virtualization hosts are the physical machines that run the virtual machines and various platforms can be used with OpenNebula. A Virtualization Subsystem interacts with these hosts to take the actions needed by the master node. =Storage= OpenNebula Storage The datastores simply hold the base images of the Virtual Machines. The datastores must be accessible to the front-end; this can be accomplished by using one of a variety of available technologies such as NAS, SAN, or direct attached storage. Three different datastore classes are included with OpenNebula, including system datastores, image datastores, and file datastores. System datastores hold the images used for running the virtual machines. The images can be complete copies of an original image, deltas, or symbolic links depending on the storage technology used. The image datastores are used to store the disk image repository. Images from the image datastores are moved to or from the system datastore when virtual machines are deployed or manipulated. The file datastore is used for regular files and is often used for kernels, ram disks, or context files. =Physical networks= Physical networks are required to support the interconnection of storage servers and virtual machines in remote locations. It is also essential that the front-end machine can connect to all the worker nodes or hosts. At the very least two physical networks are required as OpenNebula requires a service network and an instance network. The front-end machine uses the service network to access hosts, manage and monitor hypervisors, and to move image files. The instance network allows the virtual machines to connect across different hosts. The network subsystem of OpenNebula is easily customizable to allow easy adaptation to existing data centers.

The MacMhuirich bardic family, known in Scottish Gaelic as Clann MacMhuirich and Clann Mhuirich, was a prominent family of bards and other professionals in 15th to 18th centuries. The family was centred in the Hebrides, and claimed descent from a 13th-century Irish bard who, according to legend, was exiled to Scotland. The family was at first chiefly employed by the Lords of the Isles as poets, lawyers, and physicians. With the fall of the Lordship of the Isles in the 15th century, the family was chiefly employed by the chiefs of the MacDonalds of Clanranald. Members of the family were also recorded as musicians in the early 16th century, and as clergymen possibly as early as the early 15th century. History =Supposed origins= The family claimed descent from Muireadhach Albanach √ì D√°laigh (fl.1200‚Äì1230). Muireadhach Albanach was a member of the eminent √ì D√°laigh bardic dynasty. This family is sometimes traced back to either of two men named D√°lach: one is the legendary student of Abbot Colm√°n mac L√©n√©ni of Cloyne; the other is another legendary figure, who was a descendant of the 8th-century Irish king Fergal mac Ma√≠le D√∫in, son of Ma√≠le Fithraig. Muireadhach Albanach gained the nickname Albanach (\\"the Scot\\") in reference to the time he spent in Scotland. He supposedly spent 15 years in there, after being exiled for killing a steward of Domhnall M√≥r √ì Domhnaill (1207‚Äì1241), Lord of Tyrconell. While in Scotland, Muireadhach Albanach was employed as a bard by the Earls of Lennox, and it appears as if members of his family also settled in the Lennox, as a \\"Kathil Macmurchy\\" is recorded in the Lennox in the mid 13th century. In a lament that Muireadhach Albanach composed on the death of his wife, Maol Mheadha, he stated that she bore him 11 children. =A professional family= The Red Book of Clanranald, on display in the National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh An early member of the MacMhuirich family was Lachlann M√≥r MacMhuirich, who authored the battle-incitement poem of Clan Donald (Clann Domhnaill) sometime before the Battle of Harlaw, which took place in 1411. A possible descendant of Lachlann's was one \\"Lacclannus mcmuredhaich archipoeta\\", who witnessed a charter of Aonghas of Islay, son of the last member of Clann Domhnaill to be recognised as Lord of the Isles. Other members of the MacMhuirich family, possibly one or two, composed poems of Aonghas's murder that are preserved in the Book of the Dean of Lismore. From about the 1490s and onwards, members of the family are also recorded as clergymen (and possibly as early as 1432, if the \\"John Muaritti\\" recorded in the Apostolic Camera is indeed a MacMhuirich). Following the collapse of the Lordship of the Isles, the MacMhuirich family appears to have been chiefly employed by the chiefs of the MacDonalds of Clanranald (Clann Raghnaill). The earliest poet of the MacMhuirich family on record is Niall M√≥r MacMhuirich (c.1550-c.1613). A member of the family was the seanchaidh (story-teller and genealogist) who authored much of the Books of Clanranald, which date to the 17th and early 18th centuries. One of these books, the so-called Red Book, is best known for its account of the history of Clann Domhnaill, which was composed by Niall. The other book, the so-called Black Book, is more of a miscellaneous compilation, although it contains a version of Niall's history composed by a member of the Beaton family, another learned family of professionals that was once centred in the Hebrides. Other noted members of the family were Cathal MacMhuirich (fl.1625) and Niall MacMhuirich (c.1637‚Äì1726), the last fully competent practitioner of the family and who was still working in the first quarter of the 18th century. In the first part of the 16th century members of the family are also recorded as Harpers, and one \\"John oig Mc murcquhie leiche in Ilay\\", a physician, is recorded in 1615. The last of the family to practice Classical Gaelic poetry was Domhnall MacMhuirich, who lived on South Uist, as a tenant of Macdonald of Clanranald, in the 18th century.

The park opened in 1957 and closed in 2004. After standing empty and disused for almost 12 years, the buildings at the site were demolished in summer 2016. History Greyhound racing in the Portland metropolitan area began in 1933, organized by the Multnomah Kennel Club (MKC) and held at Multnomah Stadium (now Providence Park). In 1956, dog racing moved to Portland Meadows, after the stadium's owners notified MKC that the club would have to find a new venue, to make room at the stadium for the Portland Beavers baseball team, which was set to relocate from Vaughn Street Park. Greyhound races were only held at Portland Meadows ‚Äì which was primarily a horse racing track ‚Äì for one season, the 1956 season (Aug. 13‚ÄìOct. 17, 1956). In January 1956, MKC purchased a site in Wood Village, Oregon, with plans to build a new dog track and stadium there. The new dedicated greyhound racing track opened in 1957 and was originally named Fairview Park, but in 1978 it was renamed Murray Kemp Greyhound Park in honor of MKC's founder and longtime president. In 1991, the name was changed to Multnomah Greyhound Park. 1987 would mark the track's record season for attendance with 611,430; after the 1987 season the Multnomah Kennel Club would claim that greyhound racing was \\"the number one spectator sport in the state.\\" Throughout the 1990s, the track's attendance would continue on a steady decline. In December 2004, the track's owner, Magna Entertainment, refused to renew their lease on the building. This would mark the end of use for Multnomah Greyhound Park and the end of greyhound racing in Oregon. The track would go to great lengths to try to ensure that all remaining greyhounds were adopted and sold for an average of $175 each to avoid greyhound homelessness. Within months of the park's closure, two businessmen from Lake Oswego proposed a $490-million casino and entertainment complex to be built on the site. A ballot measure to authorize the plan was defeated in 2010 with 68 percent of voters opposed. Two ballot measures (Measures 82 and 83) which would have allowed building of a casino at the park were both soundly defeated in November 2012. In October 2015, \\"the Grand Ronde tribal confederation announced it was purchasing the defunct greyhound racetrack in Wood Village, sparking new speculation about whether a casino could end up on the site.\\" The purchase by the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon was completed in December 2015. What type of redevelopment will take place on the property has not been decided, but demolition of the then-existing buildings began at the end of June 2016. The track The track's max capacity was 18,760 people with a seating capacity of 6,064. The track's length was 1,382.5 feet and was made of sand from the Columbia River. The kennel area had a maximum capacity of 840 greyhounds. Other uses Team Oregon conducts motorcycle safety training in a portion of the parking lot and the former kennels.

Based in Las Vegas, Nevada; it entered agreements from its partner newspapers after finding that their content had been copied to online sites without permission, in order to engage in litigation against the site owners for copyright infringement. The lawsuits were much criticized by commentators, who describe the activity as copyright trolling and the company as a \\"lawsuit factory\\". Righthaven LLC's CEO, Steven Gibson, who is currently a partner at Las Vegas law firm Gibson & True LLP, regularly spoke to the media about Righthaven. Although its strategy was successful at first, it was undone in 2011 when several judges held that, since Righthaven didn't actually own the copyrights, it had no standing to sue for infringement. The company was forced into receivership in November 2011 due to outstanding legal fees to a successful defendant. In January 2012, its domain name, righthaven.com, was sold at auction to help satisfy its debts. In March 2013, Stephens Media bought back what copyrights they had transferred to Righthaven, allowing the Righthaven Receivership Estate to pay off legal fees. Lawsuits Righthaven initially entered agreements concerning old news articles from Stephens Media, publisher of the Las Vegas Review-Journal, based on a business model of suing bloggers, other Internet authors, and Internet site operators for statutory damages for having reproduced the articles on their sites without permission. An affiliate of Stephens Media owned half of Righthaven. By March 24, 2011, 255 cases had been filed. Typically, Righthaven has demanded $75,000 and surrender of the domain name from each alleged infringer, but accepted out of court settlements of several thousand dollars per defendant. approximately 70 cases had settled. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) soon took up the case on behalf of several defendants. Kurt Opsahl, an EFF attorney, said, \\"Despite what Righthaven claims, it's hard to interpret these lawsuits as anything else besides a way to bully Internet users into paying unnecessary settlements.\\" In August 2010, the company entered an agreement with WEHCO Media in Arkansas to pursue similar actions. Later, it made a similar arrangement with Media News Group, publisher of the San Jose Mercury News. In December 2010, Righthaven began to sue website operators over republished graphics and photographs, and also expanded its scope to material originally published by the Denver Post and other newspapers. That month it filed more than a dozen lawsuits over a graphic illustration of the \\"Vdara death ray\\" that had gone viral. In April 2011, a federal judge unsealed the agreement between Righthaven and Stephens Media, revealing that Stephens media receives 50% of the proceeds of lawsuits (after deducting costs). In addition, an attorney for one of the defendants claims that the agreement provides only limited rights to the copyrights of Stephens Media, specifically, only the right to sue. Some defense attorneys argue that one must have complete ownership in order to have standing to sue, which may undermine the lawsuits related to the Review-Journal material. On June 14, 2011, Federal District Court Judge Roger L. Hunt ruled that Righthaven had no standing to sue for copyright infringement, on the grounds that the original parties retain the actual copyrights. Hunt also dressed down Righthaven for misrepresenting its financial connections to Stephens Media. Among other sanctions imposed by Hunt, Righthaven was fined US$5,000 for the misrepresentation. On August 15, 2011, after losing a case handled by Marc Randazza Righthaven was ordered to pay $34,045.50 in attorney's fees and court costs in its unsuccessful lawsuit against Wayne Hoehn. Righthaven had sued Hoehn for copying a Review-Journal editorial to a blog. Federal judge Philip Pro found that Righthaven had no standing to sue, and in any case Hoehn's posting was protected by fair use. The matter was then brought to an appeal at the 9th Circuit court of appeals in California, which upheld the dismissal and the attorneys fees judgment. =Insolvency= On September 7, 2011, Legal Wings Inc., a process server used by Righthaven between May and October 2010, filed a lawsuit against Righthaven in Las Vegas Township Justice Court for unpaid bills valued at $5,670. On September 8, 2011, the MediaNews Group announced it was terminating its deal with Righthaven at the end of the month. The new CEO of the company, John Paton, called the Righthaven deal \\"a dumb idea from the start\\" and further said that had he been CEO at the time of the decision, he would have never signed it. On October 26, 2011, Righthaven was ordered to pay $119,488 in attorney's fees and court costs in its lawsuit against former federal prosecutor Thomas DiBiase. Righthaven had sued DiBiase for posting a Review- Journal story about a murder case without permission. Hunt, who had also presided over the Democratic Underground case, threw out Righthaven's suit that summer after finding Righthaven lacked standing. On October 29, 2011, Wayne Hoehn asked Pro to seize Righthaven's assets, including its bank accounts and property, to provide for the payment of Hoehn's legal fees from the August 2011 ruling. The company had previously delayed the payment to avoid bankruptcy. On November 1, 2011, Pro authorized the US Marshals Service to use reasonable force to seize $63,000 in cash and assets from Righthaven in order to pay Hoehn's legal fees. The amount included additional costs and fees from three months of delays. When it was discovered that the company bank account held less than $1,000, the court issued an order for Righthaven to turn over its intellectual property to a court-appointed receiver to be sold at auction. Righthaven did not comply by the December 19, 2011 deadline, and filed an emergency appeal with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to stop the auction from going forward, a motion which was rejected on January 10, 2012. On December 21, 2011, the righthaven.com domain name was transferred to the receiver for auction. On January 6, 2012, the righthaven.com domain name sold for $3,300 to a Switzerland-based hosting service with the stated goal of protecting clients against \\"frivolous or overly aggressive take-down tactics\\". On March 13, 2013, what copyrights Righthaven held regarding Stephens Media assets were sold off in order to satisfy financial obligations. Proceeds from the sale were divided between the receivers of the Righthaven Receivership Estate, the litigant Wayne Hoehn, and Hoehn's lawyer, Marc Randazza. As stated by the receiver, \\"‚Ä¶Righthaven‚Äôs rights acquired from Stephens Media were sold back to their original source in a commercially reasonable manner, as no other market existed for them.\\" Commentary The cases were covered by many newspapers and blogs. The Las Vegas Review-Journal and its main competitor, the Las Vegas Sun, published a series of editorials criticizing each other over the incident. Wired magazine and others described the lawsuits as copyright trolling and likened the activity to that of patent trolls. Most critics (and several federal judges) agreed that Righthaven had been suing over usage of news items allowed under the \\"fair use\\" doctrine. See also * Righthaven LLC v.

History Most of the area between the Damodar and the Ajay, largely covering the later day Shergarh, Selimpur and Senpahari parganas, was broadly known as Gopbhum, where the Sadgop kings ruled for a long time, prior to the advent of the Muslims. They ruled from Amrargar and branched out to Bharatpur (on the bank of the Damodar) and Kanksa. The Sura kings occupy a somewhat mythical position in the region. It is estimated that they ruled between the late 4th century to around 11th century. They were believed to be based in Singheswar (in the northern Rarh region) and Gar Mandaran. One branch of the family was based in what is now Purba Bardhaman district.

It is known from the eastern half of Canada and the United States westward to Minnesota in the north and eastern Texas in the south. Larva Damage The wingspan is 18‚Äì25 mm. Adults are black with a metallic sheen and whitish yellowish markings on the head and thorax and a narrow band on the abdomen. The wings are transparent. Males and females are similar, but males are more slender and have a finely tufted antenna. Adults emerge over the entire growing season, but peaking in spring and early summer. Spring generations emerge from early April to late July, while summer generations emerge from early July to November. There are two generations per year in the south and one (although sometimes a partial second) generation occurs in the north. The larvae feed on peach, plum, cherry, beach plum and black cherry. Peach is the major cultivated plant host and the principal native wild plants attacked are cherry and plum. The larvae usually establish in bark cavities around wound margins and may infest old uninjured trees that have rough bark. Cytospora species cankers are particularly favorable for invasion.

The MV Ilala a steamboat, which connects the main settlements on Lake Malawi, has Chilumba as its northernmost stop. Once it has reached Chilumba, it starts its travel back to its base in Lusumbwe in the Southern Region of Malawi. Heterogeneity in landscape gives Chilumba a unique environment for diversification of recreation and production activities. From the lake side, it is one of the unique places with Chirwa Island and Chitende Island, that host several species of plants, birds and fishes. The Islands are used by fishermen as temporary docking points. The peninsula facing Chirwa is a typical feature with rocky shore with deep waters potentially suitable for rock diving. The bay facing the jetty has shallow waters for docking boats and potential for shallow water walking to 50m then swim into deep waters facing the Chitende Peninsula and Mphiri hills. West of the peninsula lies a stretch of pure sand beach. The sand extends upland a distance of about and magnificently looks like a desert of dark sand separated by two swamps. The upper land away from the lake is prime agricultural land used during the 1980s to early 1990s as a maize seed production diversification scheme.

Garayev used a soft, melodic music, which turns lyrical and passionate in the love scene, while the conflict with the girl's father and the other whites is accompanied by harsh, dissonant music. The lovers die in the course of conflict, but the people rise up against the racial prejudices towards them, leading themselves to the Path of Thunder, the way of liberation.

Sold to the Chandris group in 1962, she was adapted for cruising and operated as Carina and, from 1964 Fiesta until scrapped in Greece in 1981. History Mona's Queen is launched at Birkenhead Mona‚Äôs Queen was built by Cammell Laird at Birkenhead at a cost of ¬£411,241. She was the second of six vessels - the six sisters - ordered by the Company between 1946 and 1955. She was the fourth vessel to be named as such in the Company's history. Her maiden voyage was on 26 June 1946 from Douglas to Liverpool. Dimensions Mona's Queen was virtually identical to her older sister, King Orry. The only difference was that the main mast crosstrees on Mona‚Äôs Queen were higher than those on King Orry. During a major refit in 1954 she was fitted with radar. She had an original tonnage of ; length 325'; beam 47'; depth 18'; speed 21 knots; i.h.p. 8,500. During refit in 1964, her tonnage was increased to 3,158, a swimming pool was installed together with accommodation for 340 passengers. Service life Mona's Queen in Steam Packet service. Mona‚Äôs Queen mainly operated between Liverpool or Fleetwood to Douglas, giving reliable service for 16 years until her register was closed on 22 October 1962.Shipping world & shipbuilder: Volume 165. 1972 Her end came quickly as the Fleetwood berth was declared unsafe and no reconstruction was in sight. Mona's Queen made the company's final sailing from Fleetwood on 11 September 1961 with 1193 passengers on board. With the introduction of the Company's new car ferry Manx Maid scheduled for 1962, coupled with the closing of the Port of Fleetwood, the decision was taken by the Steam Packet Board to dispose of one of the passenger steamers.Ramsey Courier. Friday, 13.10.1961 Whilst the slightly older King Orry may have been the obvious vessel to be disposed of, she had been fitted out for winter service, and so the decision was taken that the Mona's Queen would be put up for sale as a consequence, reducing the number of passenger steamers from 8 to 7. Made redundant, she was laid up at Barrow-in-Furness until sold in October 1962 to the Chandris group of companies leaving Barrow on 14 November, to start a new life as a cruise ship with the Chandris Line. After purchase, she was renamed four times. For the voyage to Greece she was renamed the Barrow Queen, then in turn Carissima, Carina and finally, Fiesta. She was adapted for cruising and operated as Carina in 1963, carrying 220 passengers and 60 cars. Also during 1963, Carina operated the 19-hour route between Piraeus and Brindisi through the Corinth Canal. She was rebuilt again at the end of the 1964 season as a full cruise ship, emerging as Fiesta carrying 378 passengers. As part of her 1964 programme, Fiesta cruised from Nice to Bastia, Palermo, Tunis, Palma, Majorca and Port-Vendres. Fiesta and five other early Chandris ships were offered for sale in January 1972 while laid up at Eleusis Bay (Piraeus). She was scrapped in Perama in September 1981. Following rebuild, in 1965 and subsequent years Fiesta operated 14-day Mediterranean cruises from Venice. Incidents In March 1952, Mona's Queen collided with Battery Pier at Douglas Harbour. In August 1959, she collided with Prince's Landing Stage at Liverpool, starting her winter lay up early.

It encompasses typical amenities for day users, 110 serviced campsites, five cabins, and five guest rooms. The club is situated on of privately owned, forested land at the edge of the Oak Ridges Moraine, within the Ontario Greenbelt. Harrison Creek borders the northern boundary while the Black River bisects the property. There are also two ponds and a small lake. Background Aerial view looking east The park was founded as the Toronto Helios Society in 1972. The first year was spent dredging the lake fed by a creek and natural springs. (Now known as Jarvis Pond) and a well for drinking water. 1973 was the park's first year as an official nudist club. In May 1984, the American Sunbathing Association (ASA) (now known as the American Association for Nude Recreation AANR) was notified by original owners Eric and June Jarvis that they could no longer operate Toronto Helios as a club for nudists only and were changing it to a trailer park open to the general public. According to Eric, it was a sad decision that was based on a variety of factors (increased taxes on the property of an additional $1200, loss of job for Eric, etc.) From 1984 until 2001 the land hosted a variety of non-naturist businesses including an attempt to open a KOA campground.Interview with Eric Jarvis On February 12, 2001, Carol and Larry Bean purchased the assets of Town & Country Resorts Inc. out of bankruptcy with the plan to return it to its former status as a naturist club. They renamed it The New Forest Family Naturist Resort. Unfortunately, the property had not been well maintained in and much of the infrastructure needed significant work. The next several years were spent upgrading and repairing the facilities. 2006 Interview with Carol Bean On December 22, 2006, Carol and Larry sold the property to Linda and St√©phane Desch√™nes. It was more of transition than a sale since Carol and Larry ensured that the property was sold to someone who would continue to develop the park as a naturist club. The park was renamed Bare Oaks Family Naturist Park for a variety of marketing reasons and as a wordplay on their last name. (Desch√™nes is French for ‚Äòof the oaks‚Äô.)

Early life and family Ratnam was born on 10 March 1914 in Velanai on the island of Kayts in northern Ceylon. He was educated at Velanai Anglo-Vernacular School and Union College, Tellippalai. He excelled in Tamil language and Tamil literature at school. He became a pundit in 1933 and vidvan in 1942. Ratnam was awarded BA (Hons) degree from the University of London in 1945. He later received a Bachelor of Oriental Languages degree and MA (1952) degree from the University of Madras. Ratnam married Sinthamany, daughter of P. Vaitilingam. They had a son - S. Nimalan. Career Ratnam joined the teaching profession and served as headmaster of the Moolai Senior Secondary School between 1934 and 1940. He became assistant master at Kopay Teacher Training College in 1941. In 1942 he was appointed Inspector of Schools. Between 1943 and 1956 he was a lecturer in Tamil at Maharagama Training College. Later he spent eight years as a research officer in the Official Languages Department in Colombo. He was a visiting lecturer at Navalar Hall, Colombo from 1958 to 1963. He then joined the University of Malaya in 1964 as lecturer in Indian Studies. After retirement Ratnam entered politics. He stood as the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (Federal Party)'s candidate in Kilinochchi at the 1965 parliamentary election. He won the election and entered Parliament. He stood ITAK's candidate in Kayts at the 1970 parliamentary election. He won the election and re-entered Parliament. On 14 May 1972 the ITAK, All Ceylon Tamil Congress, Ceylon Workers' Congress, Eelath Thamilar Otrumai Munnani and All Ceylon Tamil Conference formed the Tamil United Front, later renamed Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF). On 21 May 1976 Ratnam was delivering leaflets along with other leading Tamil politicians (A. Amirthalingam, V. N. Navaratnam, M. Sivasithamparam and K. Thurairatnam) when they were all arrested on government orders. Sivasithamparam was released but the others were taken to Colombo and tried for sedition. All the defendants were acquitted on 10 February 1977 after a famous trial at bar case in which around 70 leading Tamil lawyers, including S. J. V. Chelvanayakam and G. G. Ponnambalam, acted for the defence. Ratnam was the TULF's candidate in Kayts at the 1977 parliamentary election and was re-elected. Ratnam and all other TULF MPs boycotted Parliament from the middle of 1983 for a number of reasons: they were under pressure from Sri Lankan Tamil militants not to stay in Parliament beyond their normal six-year term; the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka required them to swear an oath unconditionally renouncing support for a separate state; and the Black July riots in which up to 3,000 Tamils were killed by Sinhalese mobs. After three months of absence, Ratnam forfeited his seat in Parliament on 22 October 1983. Later life Ratnam was president of Colombo Tamil Sangam (1958‚Äì61), Ulaka Tamil Marai Kallakam and editor of the Tamil World (1965). He was also a vice-president of the TULF. He represented the All Ceylon Tamil Writers‚Äô Association at the Asian Writers‚Äô Conference held in 1957 in New Delhi; attended the 25th International Congress of Orientalists held in Moscow in 1960; and the 26th Congress of Orientalists held in New Delhi in 1964. He has written more than 12 books and contributed numerous articles on literary and cultural topics. Ratnam moved to India in 1985. He returned to Sri Lanka in 2003 and lived with his children in Wellawatte, Colombo. He died on 20 December 2010 at his home in Colonbo.

Six were ordered but only two completed; they have both been sold on to other users. The class takes its name from the River Thames which flows through London and into the North Sea. History In the 1960s the RNLI's fleet consisted of motor lifeboats of limited speed due to the shape of their hull. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) had developed a faster 44-foot motor lifeboat which planed across the water with a reduced contact area and therefore could move much faster. The RNLI obtained one in 1964. This led to the introduction of the Waveney-class into service in 1967. The RNLI's architects designed a larger version with a longer hull and a bow of different shape. Six boats were ordered, four from Brooke Marine in Lowestoft and two from Richard Dunston in Hessle, but a cash-flow problem saw the project cancelled after just two of the Brooke Marine order had been built. Cancellation charges were paid as the builders had already ordered the necessary materials. Instead the alternative Arun-class lifeboat, which had first launched in 1971, went into full production. Description The Thames class had steel hulls. They were powered by a pair of General Motors diesel engines. Fleet =RNLB Rotary Service (ON 1031)= This prototype Thames- class, RNLI Official Number (ON 1031) and Operational Number 50-001 was launched in 1973 and was named Rotary Service as its ¬£200,000 price was funded by Rotary International. It entered service at in December 1974 and was in service there until August 1978. During this time it was used for 45 service calls and saved 17 lives. Its most meritorious service in this time was on 28 November 1977 when Coxswain Arthur West was awarded an RNLI Bronze Medal for his outstanding seamanship and tremendous courage in saving six men from a storm-lashed barge. In 1979 it was reallocated to where it was well liked. It was replaced in 1997 by brand new . After a few months in the relief fleet Rotary Service was withdrawn from service. The following year it was sold and was reported in 2008 working as pilot boat Treffry at Castletownbere. As of 2015, The Thames Class Lifeboat trust purchased the boat through a generous donation and has now been moved back to her build port of Lowestoft in Suffolk where it is being refitted for use as a training vessel, teaching young & disadvantaged individuals seamanship skills and giving the confidence to suit jobs in the maritime sector.http://www.50001.org.uk/latest/ =RNLB Helmut Schroder of Dunlossit (ON 1032)= The second Thames-class vessel was launched in 1976 and received the name Helmut Schroder of Dunlossit. Until 1979 it was used for further trials but then took up station at . It too was withdrawn in 1997 but the following year was sold for further use as a lifeboat. It was shipped to New Zealand where it was renamed P&O; Nedlloyd Rescue and put into service with Sumner Lifeboat Institution Inc. It was sold to Lyttelton Port Company Ltd when replaced in 2010 by a new locally built Sumner-class lifeboat. It now serves as a LPC work boat and relief pilot boat named LPC Rescue.

The metre gauge line runs from Garmisch in the centre of Garmisch-Partenkirchen to the Zugspitzplatt, approximately 300 metres below Zugspitze, the highest mountain in Germany. The line culminates at 2,650 metres above sea level, which makes it the highest railway in Germany and the third highest in Europe. It is also the railway in Europe with the biggest height difference: 1,945 metres, the lower half being open-air and the upper half being underground. The line is operated by the Bayerischen Zugspitzbahn Bergbahn AG (BZB), whose majority owner is the Garmisch- Partenkirchen Municipal Works. In 2007 the Zugspitze Railway was nominated for a Historic landmarks of civil engineering in Germany award. The Zugspitze is accessible via the Seilbahn Zugspitze from Eibsee Lake or Tyrolean Zugspitze Cable Car.  History  = Opening of the line = The railway was built between 1928 and 1930 and opened in three stages. The first was the long centre section between Grainau and the Eibsee which went into operation on 19 February 1929. On 19 December 1929 it was followed by the long section between Garmisch and Grainau, including the important tourist connexion to the main railway network of the Deutsche Reichsbahn. On 8 July 1930 the last long section between the Eibsee and the ‚Äì now closed ‚Äì summit station of Schneefernerhaus was opened, including the final long Zugspitze Tunnel. = New summit section since 1987 = In 1987 the route of the railway in the summit area was changed and the long \\"Rosi Tunnel\\" opened. The tunnel was named after the skier, Rosi Mittermaier, who was the tunnel patroness (Tunnelpatin) at the time. The tunnel branches from the 1930-built Zugspitze Tunnel about three-quarters of the way along it, and runs to the somewhat lower Zugspitzplatt plateau at . Here, below the Sonn-Alpin Restaurant is the new Glacier Station (Gletscher-Bahnhof) in the middle of the ski area. The overall length of the Zugspitze Railway was extended from to its current . For five years, both termini were worked in parallel, but since November 1992 the old route to the Schneefernerhausis is no longer routinely worked.  Route  The Zugspitze Railway starts in the quarter of Garmisch at a height of . Here the BZB runs its own terminal station which is operationally entirely separate from the adjacent standard gauge station of the Deutsche Bahn AG. Moreover, it is still just called Garmisch, whereas the DB station bears the double- barrelled name of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, reflecting the contentious merger, formally in 1935, of the two municipalities. For the first , as far as Grainau, the Zugspitze Railway runs as an adhesion line. Of this section, the first run parallel to the Ausserfern Railway, built in 1913. The mountain section begins in Grainau station, is equipped with a Riggenbach rack system, and is long. The railway climbs steeply uphill from Grainau, passes Eibsee station and finally arrives at the halt of Riffelriss. Immediately after the halt is the entrance to the Zugspitze Tunnel, which together with the Rosi Tunnel takes trains to the current terminus at Zugspitzplatt. Technical The Zugspitzbahn runs from Garmisch-Partenkirchen to Zugspitzplatt, a distance of 19.0 km. The track gauge is 1,000 mm and the electrification system is 1,500 V D.C. overhead line. The lower section from Garmisch to Eibsee is operated as an adhesion railway with rack assistance from Grainau to Eibsee. The section above Eibsee is operated as rack only using the Riggenbach system.

Color of words are ordered according to the visible spectrum of light. The Ten suchnesses (Chinese: ÂçÅÂ¶ÇÊòØ sh√≠ r√∫sh√¨; Japanese: ÂçÅÂ¶ÇÊòØ j≈´ nyoze; sometimes transliterated in English as junyoze or ju-nyoze) are a Mahayana doctrine which is important, as well as unique, to that of the Tiantai (Tendai) and Nichiren Buddhist schools of thought. The doctrine is derived from a passage found within the second chapter of Kumarajiva's Chinese translation of the Lotus Sutra, that \\"characterizes the ultimate reality (literally, ‚Äúreal mark‚Äù) of all dharmas in terms of ten suchnesses.\\" This concept is also known as the ten reality aspects, ten factors of life, or the Reality of all Existence. Origin The list of ten suchnesses is neither found in Dharmaraksha's Chinese translation nor in the Tibetan edition or any of the extant Sanskrit manuscripts. The Sanskrit editions of the Lotus Sutra list only five elements: Kumarajiva translates the passage in Chapter Two as: The discrepancy between Kumarajivas translation and the Sanskrit editions might be due to Kumarajiva's use of a manuscript variant but Groner and Stone suggest that \\"the expansion of this list to ten is probably Kumarajiva's invention and may well be presaged in a passage in the Dazhidulun that includes nine aspects.\\" Kumarajiva‚Äôs translations differed from his contemporaries as he was trying to convey the true meaning of the sutras rather than literal meaning. Thus, this can often explain small discrepancies from the original text.  Definitions  The following definitions are given by the Soka Gakkai English Buddhist Dictionary Committee and describe what each suchness means in more detail: * Appearance (form): the attributes of everything that is discernible, such as color, shape, or behavior. * Nature (nature): the inherent disposition or quality of a person or thing that cannot be discerned from the outward appearance. * Entity (embodiment): the substance of life that permeates as well as integrates both appearance and nature. The above three suchnesses describe the reality of life itself. The next six suchnesses, from the fourth through the ninth, explain the functions and workings of life. * Power (potency): life's potential energy. * Influence (function): the activity produced when life's inherent power or potential energy is activated. * Internal cause (primary cause): the potential cause in life that produces an effect of the same quality as itself, i.e., good, evil, or neutral. * Relation (secondary Cause): the relationship of secondary, indirect causes to the internal cause. Secondary causes are various conditions, both internal and external, that help the internal cause produce an effect. * Latent effect (effect): the dormant effect produced in life when an internal cause is activated through its related conditions. * Manifest effect (recompense): the tangible, perceivable effect that emerges in time as an expression of a dormant effect and therefore of a potential cause, again through its related conditions. * Consistency from beginning to end (complete fundamental whole): the unifying factor among the ten suchnesses. It indicates that all of the other nine suchnesses from Appearance to Manifest Effect are consistently interrelated. All nine suchnesses thus harmoniously express the same condition of existence at any given moment. Interpretation The ten suchnesses, or categories, are what led the sixth century Chinese Buddhist philosopher Zhiyi to establish the doctrine of the \\"three thousand [worlds] in one thought.\\" The Tiantai school describes ten dharma realms (ch. shi fajie) of sentient beings: the realms of hell dwellers, hungry ghosts, beasts, asuras, humans, gods (devas), sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas and Buddhas. According to Zhiyi, each of these ten dharma realms mutually includes all of the other realms, resulting in 100 \\"states of existence\\" that share the characteristics of the ten suchnesses. The one thousand suchnesses are active in each of the three spheres (the five skandhas, sentient beings, and their environment) forming three thousand worlds in one thought moment. Nichiren regarded the doctrine of \\"three thousand [worlds] in one thought\\" (ichinen-sanzen) as the fundamental principle of the Lotus Sutra and the very essence of the Buddha's teachings. He wrote in his work Kaimoku-sh≈ç (Essay on the Eye-opener) concerning ichinen- sanzen: \\"The very doctrine of the Three Thousand Realms in One Mind of the Tendai sect appears to be the way to lead man to buddhahood.\\" Nikkyo Niwano states that the principle of the Reality of All Existence not only analyzes what modern science would analyze in physical substances to the extent of subatomic particles, but also extends to mental state. Accordingly, everyone's mind has existing within it the ten realms of existence which are said to be found within one another. The suchnesses reveal the deepest reality inherent within all things, and, consequently, innumerable embodied substances existing in the universe are interrelated with all things. The suchnesses, one through nine, operate according to the law of the universal truth, namely from the \\"complete fundamental whole\\" under which no one, no thing, and no function can depart. All things, including man, along with their relations with everything else are formed from the Reality of All Existence that is the Ten Suchnesses.

The listing is for a area with just the one contributing building and no other structures. According to the National Register's database, the building was built in 1831. According to the historical park, the building was built in 1835. The Heritage Park states that the building was constructed by Samuel Beall, in 1835, \\"at the corner of Main and Monroe Streets\\", in Green Bay and \\"used as a land office and Beall's residence.\\" It was moved several times, in fact, before being moved to Heritage Hill, in Allouez, in 1975.

It was launched by former UNDP Administrator James Speth.Murphy, C.N., 2006a, The United Nations Development Programme: A Better Way?, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press p.290 The UNDAP builds on the current joint programming processes for developing an UNDAF and UNDAF Action Plan. Methodology The UNDAP methodology was first used in Tanzania. The methodology was designed based on experiences from the previous UNDAF cycle, the Delivering as One (DaO) experience, and JAST participation. It was also a response to the recommendations from the DaO country-led evaluations. UNDAP aims to reduce duplication in planning requirements for UN agencies and national partners and for some agencies to replace the current requirements of the UNDAF and agency-specific country programme planning documents. UNDAP aims to bring together agency-specific planning requirements in a consistent and seamless manner and ensure a \\"necessary and sufficient\\" programme logic in the results chain and resource requirements. The plan outlines linkages to regional and global initiatives at the sectoral level, forging greater synergy between UN plans, and support of larger multilateral and bilateral programmes.

Near the Gwalior Fort and dedicated to Vishnu in his Padmanabha form, like most Hindu and Jain temples in this region, it is mostly in ruins and was badly damaged from numerous invasions and Hindu-Muslim wars in the region. It was built in 1093 by King Mahipala of the Kachchhapaghata dynasty, according to an inscription found in the larger of the twin temple. The twin temples are situated in the Gwalior Fort. The temple's tower and sanctum has been destroyed, but its architecture and damaged carvings can still be appreciated from the ruins. The jagati platform is long and wide, on a square plan. The temple was three-storeyed, which was one of its distinguishing features and sophistication. It followed a central cluster concept, states Adam Hardy.Adam Hardy (2002), ≈öekharƒ´ Temples, Artibus Asiae, Vol. 62, No. 1 (2002), pp. 81-137 The surviving elements of the temple are the entrance porch and the mandapa. According to James Harle, though the prasada (tower, spire) no longer exists, the triple storey plan with a cruciform foundation and balconies suggests that it had a North Indian Bhumija style architecture. This style, states Harle, is marked by a well proportioned superstructure, its \\"regularly arranged little subordinate sikharas strung out like gigantic beaded garlands\\". Saasbahu temples plan, a sketch made in 1871. This temple mainly has three entrances from three different directions. In the fourth direction, there is a room which is currently closed. The entire temple is covered with carvings, notably 4 idols of Brahma, Vishnu and Saraswati above its entrance door. The pillar carvings show Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism related carvings. The larger temple ornamentation covers all the exterior walls and all surviving interior surfaces. The twin temple, like elsewhere in India, has locally been called Sasbahu temple. The word Sasbahu means \\"mother-in-law, bride\\" or \\"a mother with her daughter-in-law\\", an association that implies their being together and interdependent. The Sas temple is typically the larger older temple of the twin. The Gwalior Sasbahu temple follows this style, but both temples are dedicated to Vishnu. Only the Sas temple has survived in some form, the Bahu temple is a shell structure of the original one storey with a highly ornate door frame and its defaced wall reliefs surviving. The remnants of the Bahu temple at Gwalior suggest that it may have been a smaller version of the Saas temple. The Sas temple has a square sanctum attached to a rectangular two storey antarala and a closed three storey mandapa with three entrances. The temple main entrance porch has four carved Ruchaka ghatapallava-style pillars that are load-bearing. The walls and lintels are intricately carved, though much defaced. On the lintel of the entrances, friezes of Krishna-leela scenes are carved inside, while the outer side narrate legends from other Hindu texts. Above the lintel is Garuda, the vahana of Vishnu.Gwalior Fort: Gwalior, ASI Bhopal Circle, Government of India The Bahu temple also has a square sanctum with side, with four central pillars. Its maha-mandapa is also a square with side, with twelve pillars. The temple, like most Malwa and Rajputana historic temples, provides multiple entrances to the devotee. The roof consists of two rotated squares that intersect to form an octagon capped by successive overlapping circles. The pillars have octagonal bases as well, with girls carved but these have been defaced and mutilated. The sanctum has an image of damaged Vishnu, next to whom stands Brahma holding the Vedas on one side and Shiva holding the trident on the other side.Sas-bahu Mandir, A Cunningham, pages 361-362 Gallery ;Saas temple (bigger) File:11th century Saas Bahu mandir, Vishnu Hindu temple Gwalior fort.jpgThe larger of the twin temple File:Saas-Bahu temple (16134920660).jpgAdhisthana and stambha designs in the Sas temple File:Saas- Bahu temple (15702423083).jpgWall reliefs on the outer wall of Saas temple (defaced) File:Saas-Bahu temple (16134913670).jpgDamaged friezes ;Bahu temple (smaller) File:Sas Bahu Ka Mandir Fort Gwalior - panoramio - Gyanendrasinghchauha‚Ä¶ (1).jpgThe smaller of the twin temple File:The Bahu temple in the Gwalior Fort.JPGThe lower level sculptures are defaced, some upper level survive File:Small Sas Bahu temple, Gwalior Fort..jpgThe temple in 1885 File:Saas-Bahu temple (16321376002).jpgThe mandapa entrance pillar carvings of women (defaced) See also *Siddhachal Caves *Telika Mandir References =Bibliography=  Dehejia, V.

Edward, Duke of York, had taken the throne as Edward IV in 1461. Henry had fled with some Lancastrian supporters and spent much of the next few years in hiding in the north of England or in Scotland, where there was still some Lancastrian support. Henry was captured in 1465 and was held as a prisoner in the Tower of London. Following dissent with his former key supporter, Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, Edward was forced to flee in 1470. Henry was then restored to the throne.  Nomenclature  The period known as the Readeption was so named because of the formula at the start of Henry VI's issuants, viz. \\"the forty-ninth year of the reign of King Henry VI and the first year of the readeption of his Royal power\\".  Background  King Henry VI had been king of England nearly all his life: his father Henry V had died in 1422 on campaign in France when Henry VI was only a few months old. Henry VI was never a strong king like his father; he was unable to keep a firm hand on either government or the nobility, and by the mid-1450s civil war had broken out.Ross, J., Henry VI: A Good, Simple and Innocent Man (St Ives, 2016), 6‚Äì7. The main protagonists were supporters of Henry and his Queen‚ÄîLancastrians‚Äîand those of the recalcitrant Richard, Duke of York, or Yorkists. These civil wars‚Äîknown today as the Wars of the Roses‚Äîbroke out in 1455 when Henry's army was defeated by a Yorkist one at the First Battle of St Albans, and there were further bloody encounters between the two sides until, eventually, in March 1461, the Yorkist army led by Edward, Duke of York, beat the royal army at Towton. This decisive engagement has been described as the biggest battle ever fought on English soil: it resulted in Edward taking the throne for himself as King Edward IV, and King Henry and Queen Margaret escaping into Scottish exile. Edward reigned for the next ten years, supported by his close allies the Neville family‚Äîpre-eminent amongst them, Richard, Earl of Warwick. It was not particularly peaceful; until 1464, there were continuous sieges, clashes and encounters in the North of England, until these were eventually crushed by Warwick's brother John.Wolffe, B., Henry VI (London, 1981), 336. John was rewarded with the earldom of Northumberland,Scofield, C. L., The Life and Reign of Edward IV (2 vols, London, 1923), 334. a title that had traditionally been held by the Nevilles' bitter territorial rivals in the north, the Percy family. = Warwick's discontent with Yorkist rule = Warwick, however, was increasingly discontented with his former prot√©g√©, King Edward. Not only did he disagree with the pro-Burgundian and anti-French foreign policy Edward was pursuing, but the king had made an unpopular marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, whom Warwick appears to have considered of parvenu stock.Ross, C.D., Edward IV (London, 1975), 152. Edward's younger brother George of Clarence was also, for his own reasons, turning against Edward, and by the late 1460s, he and Warwick were in political alliance against the King. In late 1467, Warwick withdrew from the court to the north and his Yorkshire estates. George was equally dissatisfied with his lot under his brother's regime, particularly as Edward had recently forbidden a marriage between George and Warwick's eldest daughter, Isabel Neville.Hicks, M. A., False, Fleeting, Perjur'd Clarence: George, Duke of Clarence 1449‚Äì78 (Gloucester, 1980), 86. The king had also recently dismissed Warwick and John's brother George from the chancellorship‚Äîin (says historian Charles Ross) a \\"pointed\\" manner. According to Jean de Wavrin, the earliest indication that Warwick had turned to treason was in July 1467: Wavrin relates that Warwick was even at that time promising to make the young Duke of Clarence king in place of his brother. Certainly, though, by 1468 relations between Warwick and the King had deteriorated to such an extent that the earl was actively plotting against Edward. A captured Lancastrian messenger at the siege of Harlech Castle alleged that Warwick was not only conspiring against the King, but was even by now negotiating with Margaret of Anjou. As a result, Edward summoned the Earl to appear before the Royal council; Warwick refused to do so. A second royal demand for Warwick to attend upon Edward early in 1468 also met with a similar response. England at that time was less peaceful than the King would have wished, and there appears to have been a popular undercurrent of discontent; for example, a mob attacked and pillaged Earl Rivers' estates in Kent, with complaints about heavy levels of taxation being common. In the north, a group of malcontents gathered in arms and offered to fight with the Earl of Warwick. Whilst relations between the king and the Earl of Warwick appear to have improved slightly in 1468‚Äîfor instance, both Warwick and John Neville regularly attended the Royal council, and the former also took part in the ceremonial departure of the king's sister, Margaret, who was to marry the duke of Burgundy that summer. Ross suggests that this was at least in part due to a failure of \\"political judgement\\" on the king's part. = Warwick's first uprising = Popular politics was not irrelevant in the 15th century: historian K. B. McFarlane noted that \\"with little to lose and grievances that were real enough\\" the common people were \\"easily incited to rebellion by magnates they admired\\",McFarlane, K. B., England in the Fifteenth Century: Collected Essays (London, 1981), 254. and Ross has suggested that the Earl of Warwick was both willing to exploit and capable of exploiting these feelings. In late April 1469 a large body of dissidents gathered under the leadership of one Robin of Redesdale in Yorkshire; however, Warwick's brother, John Neville, appears to have dispersed them with little trouble. Almost immediately, however, there was another, separate but larger gathering in the East Riding of Yorkshire, this time led by one Robin of Holderness. This rebellion may have been in support of the Percy family's traditional claim to the earldom of Northumberland; this group, too, was scattered by John Neville, and its leader beheaded in York. In the meantime, the remnants of Robin of Redesdale's original force had regrouped and re-emerged in Lancashire; this rising, at least, is generally considered by historians to have almost certainly been a Warwick construct. In any case, it gathered a large army around it, and included many retainers and men otherwise connected to the Neville family in Yorkshire, including Sir John Conyers, the son of Lord FitzHugh, and the Nevilles' own cousin, Sir Henry Neville; indeed it contained three Neville brothers-in-law.Gillingham, J., The Wars of the Roses (London (repr.) 1980), 192. King Edward was, however, slow in responding to these multiple threats (\\"and slower still to link them with Neville treason\\", says Ross). Warwick himself appears to have been pre-occupied with a naval command. In mid-June the King deemed it necessary to travel to the north in order to suppress Redesdale's rebellion; yet his actions have been described as \\"lacking urgency\\". Worse, by the time Edward reached Newark, his intelligence reported to him that the rebel force may have been five times the size of the king's own. He had also by now heard rumours of Warwick's involvement in the uprising, as he wrote to Warwick, Clarence and the Archbishop asking them for help and saying that they were not doing the things \\"as the rumour here runneth\\". But instead they set sail for Calais, where on 11 July George Neville, Archbishop of York, married George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, to Isabelle Neville, in defiance of the King's expressed wishes. Soon afterwards, they wrote to the rebels in the north of England. The rebel army grew larger and reached as far south as Oxfordshire. This alarmed the King, and the rebels defeated the Royal army at the Battle of Edgecote Moor, six miles north-east of Banbury, on 26 July. Unaware of this disaster, Edward was captured by Warwick on 29 July and imprisoned in Warwick Castle. Earl Rivers and his son John Woodville were beheaded shortly afterwards. Warwick summoned a Parliament, which he probably hoped would depose Edward in Clarence's favour. But widespread rioting forced him to release the King by mid- September. Surprisingly, Edward forgave both Warwick and Clarence. = Warwick's allegiance to Lancaster = After another, failed, rebellion thwarted by Edward at the Battle of Losecoat Field in March 1470, Warwick and Clarence fled to France, and in July they there encountered Margaret of Anjou, the wife of Henry VI. Warwick had played a huge role in deposing Henry from the throne in 1461. However, after tense negotiations Warwick, Clarence and Margaret came to a deal whereby in return for French aid in an invasion, Warwick and Clarence would help restore Henry VI to the throne. Henry VI's son, Edward of Westminster, would be his heir as Prince of Wales, but if Westminster died then Clarence would become heir to the throne. This alliance was sealed by the marriage of Warwick's youngest daughter Anne Neville to Prince Edward. On 27 March 1470, Edward IV restored Henry Percy to the earldom of Northumberland, and John Neville was promoted to Marquess of Montague, although he had not taken part in his brother's uprisings.Hicks, M. A., The Wars of the Roses (Totton, 2012), 195. Between the restoration of Henry Percy (who was released from the Tower on 27 October 1469)Hicks, M. A., Warwick the Kingmaker (Padstowe (repr.) 2002), 280. and the return of Warwick, the King was \\"walking a tightrope\\" as to whether Montagu would accept his Marquisate as compensation.Pollard, A. J., North Eastern England During the Wars of the Roses: Lay Society, War, and Politics 1450‚Äì1500 (Oxford, 1990), 311. Warwick and Clarence docked in Dartmouth, Devon and the earl of Pembroke in Plymouth on 13 September. Warwick entered London in triumph and freed Henry VI from the Tower on 6 October.  Readeption  The Readeption of Henry VI took place on 3 October 1470. However, by this point Henry was mentally too feeble to rule unaided; for example, he had to be led by the hand when he paraded through London. Following his return to the throne, all official documents began to refer to his regnal year as \\"the 49th year of the reign of Henry VI and the first of his readeption to royal power\\". Although the Lancastrian regime was reinstated, it has been described as \\"Lancastrian... in a Neville costume\\".Kendall, P. M., Warwick the Kingmaker (London (rep.) 1972), 284.  Edward IV's return  Henry's return to the throne did not last long. After gaining Burgundian support, Edward IV landed at Ravenspurn on 14 March 1471. Local militias were raised in the north; one, led by Sir John Westerdale, may even have numbered a substantial \\"several thousand men\\", and others \\"to the number of 6,000‚Äì7,000 milled menacingly\\".Goodman, A., The Wars of the Roses (New York, 1981), 75. The royal propagandist of the Historie of the arrivall of Edward IV suggests the royal army was, \\"though small, well-armed and determined\\" and that Edward claimed he had returned solely for his duchy of York. However, the King could not start raising a force of any numbers until well to the south, in Lord Hastings's estates in the Midlands (about 3,000 men in Nottingham, where he was joined by William Parr and James Harrington, with their personal forces of sixty men-at-arms). Whereas, in the north, came \\"not so many as supposed would have come\\", reported the Arrivalist.Giles, J.A. (ed.), 'The Arrivall of Edward IV in England,' Chronicles of the White Rose of York (Lampeter (repr.), 2004), 45. Edward defeated Warwick in the Battle of Barnet on 14 April, in which both Warwick and his brother John Neville were killed, and the Lancastrians in the Battle of Tewkesbury. Edward of Westminster was killed there, the Beaufort family almost extinguished entirely, and Queen Margaret captured. Edward IV entered London on 21 May. Henry VI died that night, or soon afterwards, perhaps on Edward's orders.

While looking for a shelter in ruins of an old castle, he met a hermit, who shows him images of seven beauties from different countries. It seems to Bahram that the beauties are revived and are going round with amazing dances. At daybreak the beauties disappear. Bahram leaves the palace and goes home. On the road he sees a stately youngster Manzar and his sister Aysha competing in a bow. Bahram calls Manzar to compete. Then they exchange gifts according to custom. Bahram gives Manzar a belt, and he gives him a sword. After Manzar goes away, Bahram makes Aysha a declaration of love. Aysha also confesses to the hunter. And when servants and a vizier come for lost Bahram, Aysha and Manzar know that this young hunter is none other than the Shah. Vizier informs him about the Khazars‚Äô invasion. Bahram gives authority to the vizier and takes the field. But the vizier, who has a plan about seizure of power, charges two of his closes to disguise themselves in Khazars‚Äô costume, to catch up and kill the Shah. A gloomy demonstration is observed on the square and population begs for mercy. Captivated girls follow the defaulters. Fierce servants of the Shah pounce on goods on stores, plunder and demolish everything which fall into their hands, after which the population terribly runs away. At that time the vizier enjoys the power, goes down to underground treasury, where he wears splendid clothes. He dreams of that day, when he‚Äôll be a Shah. At that time a killer comes and says that they couldn‚Äôt attempt on the Shah‚Äôs life. Then voices of horn are heard. Returning to the capital Bahram, who knows about the conspiracy, wants a reprisal. But he can‚Äôt leave the palace because of the vizier‚Äôs guards. Then Manzar calls armed craftsmen for help. At that time, a solemn demonstration led by the vizier goes out from the palace. He gives Bahram symbols of power. Manzar knows about the vizier‚Äôs perfidy, but the vizier kills close before the Shah‚Äôs eyes, to show his loyalty to the Shah and that allegedly he was the organizer of the conspiracy. Guards disarm the population, tie up craftsmen and Manzar and imprison them. Knowing about Manzar‚Äôs and craftsmen‚Äôs imprisonment, Aysha runs to the palace and begs the Shah, who feasts at that time, to set them free. The Shah releases only Manzar in memory of their former friendship. Disturbed by Bahram‚Äôs act that didn‚Äôt punish the vizier and release the craftsmen, Manzar drop the belt, presented by the Shah, on the ground. This act outrages the Shah and he ordered to execute Manzar. But he runs away. The vizier wants to distract the Shah. He shows him silk textile, on which seven beauties are portrayed. Shah remembers that night spent in ruins of the palace and seven beauties seem to him again. The Shah forgets about vital problems, what the vizier tries to obtain to seize the power. He goes to a village with his guards where Manzar takes cover. Knowing that peasants don‚Äôt want to give up Manzar, the vizier orders to trample down the peasants‚Äô crops. The peasants appeal to the Shah. But the Shah‚Äôs thinks only about Aysha, whom he cannot forget. But Aysha refuses Bahram‚Äôs love, who dooms the population to starvation. Bahram orders the vizier to burn the village. Suddenly seven young peasants and craftsmen appear while the vizier looks at the fire. They commit revenge and the vizier dies. Bahram wants to forget Aysha. That is why he returns to the palace, seeking oblivion in seven beauties. But at that time a thunderclap is heard and walls of the palace are parted. Seven messengers of the population appear and give the Shah a crook and cloak showing him that he has to abdicate and leave the country. Suddenly Aysha appears, saying the Shah that she loves not him, but a hunter and is ready to go with him if he abdicates. Wrathful Bahram strikes a girl with a fatal blow of the sword. The population bids farewell to Aysha and drive Bahram away.

As soon as the project, headed by Bulatoviƒá, was chosen, both professional and public opinion were already against it. Nevertheless, city government pushed the project and the new square was officially opened on 16 December 2015. The small square which gave a feel of being cosy and tucked in, was completely buried under the white concrete. It was soon nicknamed the ‚ÄúConcrete square‚Äù, and seen as a sickly white, empty, sterile and resembling a great tomb. It was soon evident that, apart from being completely botched, it was poorly done and that it may need new reconstruction soon. As the public discontent didn‚Äôt stop, Bulatoviƒá authored a text in Politika, titled Emptiness is an event, trying to explain her work and saying that the \\"basic quality of an urban area is reaction of the human senses\\" and that it is important \\"whether some area is pleasant or desirable to spend time in it\\". Preachy and philosophical text only provoked the public opinion even more, and she got a harsh public response from composer Ivana Stefanoviƒá titled Great white emptiness replying that the \\"event\\" actually makes you feel negative and unpleasant spending time in it and that the spirit of Cvetni Trg, that of the small city garden, was killed and replaced by the graveyard silence. Dramaturge and university professor Predrag Peri≈°iƒá said that someone \\"ripped out the flowers and planted concrete\\" and that \\"it is a rare case that one urban complex, after the reconstruction and lots of resources spent on it, looks worse than before\\". Architect Zdravko Zdravkoviƒá criticized the city government in general for hiring only the architects of the same mind, ignoring all the other professions which participate in the urban development. He added that after the reconstruction Cvetni Trg completely lost its function and was transformed into the \\"barren, empty space\\", but that \\"failures, luckily, can be repaired\\". Despite the public outcry, mayor Mali said that the new square is ‚Äúprobably the most beautiful in Belgrade‚Äù. = Gardo≈° = In March 2018 it was announced that the top plateau of the Gardo≈° hill and the area surrounding the Gardo≈° Tower will be revitalized. Without public architectural design competition, the job was directly entrusted to Bulatoviƒá by Milutin Foliƒá, Belgrade's city architect, and Dejan Matiƒá, president of Belgrade's Zemun municipality to which Gardo≈° belongs.

In 1937 he became SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer. from left to right: Italian Police officer Arturo Bocchini, Wolf-Heinrich von Helldorf, Kurt Daluege, Dollmann (as Himmler's representative in Rome), General Palma. Diplomatic career In 1939 Dollmann was appointed German Ambassador to the Holy See. He helped Virginia Agnelli escape from detention and was with her help able to arrange a meeting between SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Karl Wolff and Pope Pius XII to negotiate the peaceful German evacuation of Rome. Later, as Befehlshaber der Polizei, he was Adjutant of Karl Wolff in a villa on the Lake Garda. On 20 July 1944 Dollmann was official interpreter at the meeting of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, at the Wolfsschanze, immediately after the 20 July plot. Around 8 May 1945, Dollmann was protected from criminal prosecution of his involvement in war crimes by Cardinal Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster, Archbishop of Milan, with whom he had discussed the possibility for a separate peace between Nazi Germany and the Western Allies (Operation Sunrise). He hid Dollmann in a mental institution in Laveno-Mombello. In 1946, Dollmann returned to Rome, was detected in a movie theater and arrested. He was liberated after an intervention by James Jesus Angleton of the CIA who accompanied him to Bern to see Allen Welsh Dulles. He lived in Switzerland under a false identity. In 1952, Dollmann was expelled from Switzerland to Italy on the grounds of having had a homosexual relationship with a Swiss official. Padre Parini helped him transfer to Spain, where he was employed by Otto Skorzeny in Donostia in the arms trade. The Italian Intelligence Service issued false travel documents for Dollmann through Carlo Rocchi, a confidence man of the CIA in Milan. With these, Dollmann traveled into the Federal Republic of Germany. Dollmann was held in custody for one month for passport fraud. Upon his release he lived in Munich in Das Blaue Haus, a boarding house at the back of the Munich Kammerspiele. He continued working as translator and made the translation for the German synchronization of La Dolce Vita by Federico Fellini. He died in 1985. The Italian historian Gianfranco Bianchi was executor of his will. Dollmann formed the basis for the character of Major Bergmann in the film, Rome, Open City (1945) by Roberto Rossellini.

This characteristic is similar to that found in lilies (\\"lily-like\\"). Petaloid monocots refers to the flowers having tepals which all resemble petals (petaloid). The taxonomic terms Lilianae or Liliiflorae have also been applied to this assemblage at various times. From the early nineteenth century many of the species in this group of plants were put into a very broadly defined family, Liliaceae sensu lato or s.l. (lily family). These classification systems are still found in many books and other sources. Within the monocots the Liliaceae s.l. were distinguished from the Glumaceae. The development of molecular phylogenetics, cladistic theory and phylogenetic methods in the 1990s resulted in a dismemberment of the Liliaceae and its subsequent redistribution across three lilioid orders (Liliales, Asparagales and Dioscoreales). Subsequent work has shown that two other more recently recognized orders, Petrosaviales and Pandanales also segregate with this group, resulting in the modern concept of five constituent orders within the lilioid monocot assemblage. This has resulted in treating monocots as three informal groups, alismatid, lilioid and commelinid monocots. The lilioids are paraphyletic in the sense that commelinids form a sister group to Asparagales.  Description  = True lilioids = The descriptive term \\"petaloid lilioid monocot\\" relates to the conspicuous petal-like (petaloid) tepals which superficially resemble true lilies (Lilium). Morphologically, the petaloid or lilioid monocots can be considered to possess five groups (pentacyclic) of three-fold (trimerous) whorls. Lilioid monocots all have flowers which can be considered to have been derived from a lily-like flower with six relatively similar tepals, and six stamens. The typical lilioid gynoecium has three carpels fused into a superior trilocular (three- chambered) superior ovary, axile placentation, a single hollow style, and several ovules with anatropous orientation in one or two rows per locule and nectaries at the base. However, floral synapomorphy (shared characteristics) is rare since most conform to the general monocot pattern. This pattern is ancestral (plesiomorphic) for the lilioid monocots. Structural monosymmetry is rare, except for Orchidaceae. Various trends are apparent among the lilioids, notably a change to an inferior ovary and a reduction of the number of stamens to three. In some groups (such as the genus Trillium in the Liliaceae), the tepals have become clearly differentiated so that the flower has three coloured petals and three smaller green sepals. Almost all lilioid monocots retain at least three petal-like tepals. Since some commelinids (e.g., Palisota in the Commelinaceae, Haemodoraceae, Philydraceae, and Pontederiaceae) have petaloid flowers, the term 'lilioid' is a more accurate one for the group which excludes them, since the term petaloid monocot is still occasionally used in describing commelinids. The morphological concept of petaloid monocots has been equated with \\"animal-attracting\\" (that is, for pollination) as opposed to wind-pollinating plants (such as grasses) that have evolved very different floral structures. Pollen structure shows that of the two main tapetum types, secretory and plasmodial, the lilioid monocots are nearly all secretory. = Comparison with other monocot orders = In the orders that branched off before the lilioid monocots, the Acorales and Alismatales, flowers differ in several ways. In some cases, like Acorus (Acorales), they have become insignificant. In others, like Butomus (Alismatales), they have six coloured tepals, and so could be called 'petaloid', but stamens and carpels are more numerous than in the lilioid monocots. The later evolved commelinids have various kinds of flower, few of which are 'lily-like'. In the order Poales, comprising grasses, rushes and sedges, flowers are either petal-less or have small, unshowy petals. Many Zingiberales species have brightly coloured and showy flowers. However, their apparent structure is misleading. For example, the six tepals of cannas are small and hidden under expanded and brightly coloured stamens or staminodes which resemble petals and may be mistaken for them.  Taxonomy  = Early history = Xanthorrhaea hastilis, John Lindley: Vegetable Kingdom, 1846 In one of the earliest monocot taxonomies, that of John Lindley (1830), the grouping corresponding to the lilioid monocots was the \\"tribe\\" Petaloideae. In Lindley's system the monocots consisted of two tribes, the Petaloideae, and the Glumaceae (the grasses and sedges). Lindley divided the Petaloideae into 32 \\"orders\\" (roughly corresponding to families) and the Glumaceae into two further orders. Various successive taxonomies of the monocots also emphasized the grouping of species with petaloid (undifferentiated) perianths, such as Bentham and Hooker's Coronarie√¶ and Hutchinson's Corolliferae (\\"Corolla bearing\\") (1936). Hence the concept that there was a natural grouping of monocots whose flowers were predominantly petaloid, gave notion to the term \\"petaloid monocots\\". The core group of petaloids were the Liliaceae, hence \\"lilioid monocots\\". The term \\"lilioid monocot\\" or lilioid\\" has had widely varying interpretations. One of the narrower applications is \\"lily-like\\" monocots, meaning the two orders Asparagales and Liliales, but the term has also been applied to Takhtajan's superorder Lilianae, the whole of Liliales, or restricted to Cronquist's broadly defined Liliaceae. Although \\"petaloid\\" and \\"lilioid\\" have often been used interchangeably, as Heywood points out, some usages of \\"petaloid monocot\\", particularly in horticulture, are so broad as to be almost meaningless in that it had been used to refer to all species with conspicuous petals or perianth segments (tepals), which would cover a broad swathe of families (he estimated three dozen across many orders). Other authors have defined it equally broadly as \\"having two whorls of tepals (sepals and petals) that are petal-like\\". As Kron and Chase stated in 1995, this taxonomic unit had been in a considerable state of flux, with significant variation between the systems of Cronquist (1981), Thorne (1983, 1992), and Dahlgren (1985). When classification systems were based on morphological characters alone, lilioid species which clearly departed from the \\"lily\\" pattern were easily placed into separate families. For example, the Amaryllidaceae contained species whose flowers had six stamens and an inferior ovary. The Iridaceae contained those with three stamens and an inferior ovary. The remaining taxa were put together in a very broadly defined Liliaceae, usually referred to as Liliaceae sensu lato (s.l.). The Cronquist system's definition, for example, is the broadest of all. Rolf Dahlgren and colleagues were responsible for one of the most radical reorganisation of families, and in their 1985 monocot monograph defined the two orders (Asparagales and Liliales) which contain the bulk of monocot geophytes, as constituting the lilioid monocots. The development of DNA sequencing and the use of genetic data in determining relationships between species of monocots confirmed what many taxonomists had long suspected: Liliaceae s.l. was highly polyphyletic. The family was demonstrated to include a significant number of unrelated groups, which belonged to quite separate families and even orders. For instance some genera such as Hyacinthus, previously placed in Liliaceae s.l., were reclassified in families within Asparagales (in this case Asparagaceae). In 1995 Chase et al. reviewed the understanding of the lilioids and equated them to Dahlgreen's Liliiflorae, which they designated as superorder Lilianae. They pointed out that the understanding of the phylogenetics of this group was critical for the establishment of a monocot classification. They also noted that while many authors treated this group as monophyletic (having a common ancestor), a closer reading of their texts revealed evidence of paraphyly (excluding some descendants of a common ancestor). For instance, Dahlgren had based monophyly on a single synapomorphy, that of a petaloid perianth, yet in discussing his Lilliflorae admitted it was undoubtedly paraphyletic. Dahlgren treated the monocots as split between ten superorders and placed five orders (Dioscoreales, Asparagales, Liliales, Melanthiales, Burmanniales and Orchidales) in his Liliiflorae. = Phylogenetic era = In the 1995 study by Chase et al. referred to above, which was the largest yet to use purely molecular data, the results demonstrated paraphyly of the lilioids. However, because their data contradicted purely morphological phylogenies they were reluctant to draw definite conclusions as to the monophyly of this group. They identified four major clades of monocots. They named these alismatids, aroids, stemonoids and dioscoreoids, in addition to Acorus, and a core group of Asparagales, Liliales and commelinoids. They based the names of these groups on the closest corresponding superorders and orders of Dahlgren, with the exception of stemonoids (based on Stemonaceae for which there was no obvious equivalent). There was no clear clade corresponding to Dahlgren's Liliiflorae, whose families were distributed amongst the aroids and dioscoreoids. Of Dahlgren's Liliiflorae, the Dioscoreales largely grouped into dioscoreoids, with the exception of Stemonaceae. The Asparagales formed two major groupings, which they labelled \\"higher\\" and \\"lower asparagoids\\", and included both the Iridaceae and Orchidaceae from Dahlgren's Liliales. On the other hand, a number of families from three other orders (Asparagales, Dioscoreales, Melanthiales) segregated together with the remaining Liliales families. Genera from Dahlgren's Melanthiales were found in both dioscoreoids and the redefined Liliales. Finally Dahlgren's Burmanniales were found to belong with the dioscoreoids. Some Asparagales taxa were also found amongst the commelinoids. The stemonoids were formed from Stemonaceae and other families from a variety of orders, including Pandanaceae (which alone formed Dahlgren's Pandaniflorae). In an attempt to resolve the apparent differences between morphological and molecularly defined trees, a combined analysis was undertaken which confirmed superorder Liliiflorae as monophyletic, provided that a few modifications were undertaken. These included the removal of two tribes of Melanthiaceae (Melanthiales) and the inclusion of three additional families (Cyclanthaceae, Pandanaceae and Velloziaceae) from other superorders. This newly and more narrowly redefined Lilianae/Liliiflorae contained three orders, Aparagales, Liliales and Dioscoreales (which now included the stemonoids). This analysis also allowed for the establishment of a single synapomorphy, although this time by the presence of an inferior ovary. Significantly, the authors noted that it was no wonder the authors of angiosperm classifications had been exasperated by the Lilianae. = Angiosperm Phylogeny Group = These findings, presented at the first Monocot Conference in 1993, with the addition of several studies that had become available in the interim, formed the basis of the 1998 consensus Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) ordinal scheme. Among other things, the Alismatales were expanded and new orders such as Acorales (a placement for Acorus) and Pandanales (which now represented the stemonoids as well as new families) added. While not formally assigning any supraordinal ranks, the classification did recognize an informal grouping of monocot orders as the commelinoids. Otherwise the APG recognized only six monocot orders (Acorales, Alismatales, Asparagales, Dioscoreales, Liliales and Pandanales). The last four were however grouped together in the resulting cladogram and most closely represent the concept of lilioids, although this left some unplaced monocot families, including Corsiaceae and Petrosaviaceae. Simultaneous with the release of the 1998 APG classification were two events: the publication of Kubitzki's major monograph on the monocots and the Second Monocot Conference. Kubitzki defined superorder Lilianae as all monocots except superorders Commelinae, Alismatanae and the Acoraceae, that is the four orders Asparagales, Liliales, Dioscoreales and Pandanales. The Monocot Conference devoted an entire section to Systematics of the Lilioids and included an update of their previous research by Chase and colleagues. On this occasion the latter felt that there was now enough data to put forward a definitive classification, defining the Lilioids as comprising the four orders placed in Lilianae by Kubitzki. Rudall and colleagues (2002) followed Chase (2000), in using the term \\"lilioid monocots\\" and again noting unresolved polytomy between these four orders and the remaining monocot clades (commelinids and Petrosaviaceae), although at that time the Petrosaviaceae were still unplaced. There was now enough new data to justify revising the APG system, and a new classification was issued in 2003. Although this resulted in changes within the orders, it did not affect the relationship between them. Lilioid monocots were discussed but not formally recognized (commelinids, renamed from commelinoids, being the only supraordinal grouping in the monocots to be named) and Petrosaviaceae remained unplaced. The second version of the APG coincided with the third Monocot Conference (2003), the findings from which, using additional molecular markers, helped to resolve some of the remaining questions regarding relationships within this assemblage. Petrosaviaceae was shown to be included in what Chase refers to as \\"liliids\\" and placed in order Petrosaviales, while Dioscoreales and Pandanales were demonstrated to be sister clades. Rapid advances in understanding monocot relationships necessitated the release of another revision of the APG classification (2009), which incorporated these advances. Further definition of the relationships between lineages using multiple markers is continuing. Textbooks and other sources produced in the last century are inevitably based on older classifications. Publications using versions of the APG system are now appearing and the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew now uses the APG III system, as does the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website and hence the classification of the lilioid monocots shown in the cladogram below. The Kew botanists treat the monocots as falling into three major groupings: alismatid monocots (Acorales, Alismatales), lilioid monocots (the five other non- commelinid monocots) and commelinid monocots. They also organize their monocot research into two teams I: Alismatids and Lilioids and II: Commelinids. A similar approach is taken by Judd in his Plant systematics. = Phylogeny and evolution = The cladogram shown below displays the orders of Lilianae sensu Chase & Reveal (monocots) based on molecular phylogenetic evidence. Lilioid monocot orders are bracketed, namely Petrosaviales, Dioscoreales, Pandanales, Liliales and Asparagales. These constitute a paraphyletic assemblage, that is groups with a common ancestor that do not include all direct descendants (in this case commelinids which are a sister group to Asparagales); to form a clade, all the groups joined by thick lines would need to be included. While Acorales and Alismatales have been collectively referred to as \\"alismatid monocots\\", the remaining clades (lilioid and commelinid monocots) have been referred to as the \\"core monocots\\". The relationship between the orders (with the exception of the two sister orders) is pectinate, that is diverging in succession from the line that leads to the commelinids. Numbers indicate crown group (most recent common ancestor of the sampled species of the clade of interest) divergence times in mya (million years ago). While this is the most commonly understood relationship, Davis et al. (2013) using a combination of plastid genomes have suggested that if Asparagales is treated sensu stricto by excluding its largest and most atypical family, Orchidaceae then Aparagales sensu APG may not be monophyletic and that Orchidaceae and Liliales may be sister groups, and in turn are the sister of Asparagales. However, their data produced conflicting models. Zeng et al. (2014) using nuclear genes also found evidence for a sister relationship between Asparagales and Liliales. Although divergence time estimates within the lilioids have varied considerably, they were also able to obtain molecular clock estimates for the origin of the lilioids at approximately 125 mya (Cretaceous period). On the other hand, a large data set using a combined analysis of nuclear, mitochondrial and plastid genes together with nuclear phytochrome C was in agreement with the earlier APG relationships. = Subdivision = Five orders make up the lilioid monocots. * Petrosaviales Takht.

He became a great authority on kidney diseases and published a comprehensive paper on urinary deposits in 1844. He was also notable for his work in related sciences, especially the medical uses of electricity and electrochemistry. From 1836, he lectured at Guy's Hospital, a well-known teaching hospital in London and now part of King's College London, and published a popular textbook on science for medical students called Elements of Natural Philosophy. Having developed an interest in chemistry while still a child, largely through self- study, Bird was far enough advanced to deliver lectures to his fellow pupils at school. He later applied this knowledge to medicine and did much research on the chemistry of urine and of kidney stones. In 1842, he was the first to describe oxaluria, a condition which leads to the formation of a particular kind of stone. Bird, who was a member of the London Electrical Society, was innovative in the field of the medical use of electricity, designing much of his own equipment. In his time, electrical treatment had acquired a bad name in the medical profession through its widespread use by quack practitioners. Bird made efforts to oppose this quackery, and was instrumental in bringing medical electrotherapy into the mainstream. He was quick to adopt new instruments of all kinds; he invented a new variant of the Daniell cell in 1837 and made important discoveries in electrometallurgy with it. He was not only innovative in the electrical field, but he also designed a flexible stethoscope, and in 1840 published the first description of such an instrument. A devout Christian, Bird believed Bible study and prayer were just as important to medical students as their academic studies. He endeavoured to promote Christianity among medical students and encouraged other professionals to do likewise. To this end, Bird was responsible for the founding of the Christian Medical Association, although it did not become active until after his death. Bird had lifelong poor health and died at the age of 39. Life and career Bird was born in Downham, Norfolk, England, on 9 December 1814. His father (also named Golding Bird) had been an officer in the Inland Revenue in Ireland, and his mother, Marrianne, was Irish. He was precocious and ambitious,Balfour, p. 19 Coley, p. 366 Foregger, p. 20 but childhood rheumatic fever and endocarditis left him with poor posture and lifelong frail health. He received a classical education when he was sent with his brother Frederic to stay with a clergyman in Wallingford, where he developed a lifelong habit of self-study. From the age of 12, he was educated in London, at a private school that did not promote science and provided only a classical education. Bird, who seems to have been far ahead of his teachers in science, gave lectures in chemistry and botany to his fellow pupils. He had four younger siblings, of whom his brother Frederic also became a physician and published on botany.Frederic Bird, \\"On the artificial arrangement of some of the more extensive orders of British plants\\", The Magazine of Natural History, vol. 2, pp. 604‚Äì609, November 1838.Balfour, pp. 13‚Äì14 Coley, p. 364 Payne and McConnell Steel, p. 207 In 1829, when he was 14, Bird left school to serve an apprenticeship with the apothecary William Pretty in Burton Crescent, London. He completed it in 1833 and was licensed to practise by the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries at Apothecaries' Hall in 1836. He received this licence without examination because of the reputation he had gained as a student at Guy's, the London teaching hospital where he had become a medical student in 1832 while still working at his apprenticeship. At Guy's he was influenced by Thomas Addison, who recognised his talents early on. Bird was an ambitious and very capable student. Early in his career he became a Fellow of the Senior Physical Society, for which a thesis was required. He received prizes for medicine, obstetrics, and ophthalmic surgery at Guy's and the silver medal for botany at Apothecaries' Hall. Around 1839 to 1840, he worked on breast disease at Guy's as an assistant to Sir Astley Cooper.Balfour, p. 14 Coley, p. 366 Payne and McConnell Steel, p. 207 Bird graduated from the University of St Andrews with an MD in 1838 and an MA in 1840 while continuing to work in London. St Andrews required no residence or examination for the MD. Bird obtained his degree by submitting testimonials from qualified colleagues, which was common practice at the time. Once qualified in 1838, at the age of 23, he entered general practice with a surgery at 44 Seymour Street, Euston Square, London, but was unsuccessful at first because of his youth. In the same year, however, he became physician to the Finsbury Dispensary, a post he held for five years. By 1842, he had an income of ¬£1000 a year from his private practice. Adjusted for inflation, this amounts to a spending power of about ¬£ now. At the end of his career, his income was just under ¬£6000. He became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1840, and a fellow in 1845.Balfour, pp. 15‚Äì16 Coley, p. 366 Rosenfeld, 1999, pp. 50‚Äì51 Steel, p. 207 Wilks and Bettany, p. 249 Bird lectured on natural philosophy, medical botany and urinary pathology from 1836 to 1853 at Guy's. He lectured on materia medica at Guy's from 1843 to 1853 and at the Royal College of Physicians from 1847 to 1849. He also lectured at the Aldersgate School of Medicine. Throughout his career, he published extensively, not only on medical matters, but also on electrical science and chemistry.Balfour, pp. 16‚Äì17 Payne and McConnell Bird became the first head of the electricity and galvanism department at Guy's in 1836, under the supervision of Addison, since Bird did not graduate until 1838. In 1843, he was appointed assistant physician at Guy's, a position for which he had lobbied hard, and in October that year he was put in charge of the children's outpatients ward. Like his electrotherapy patients, the children were largely poor relief cases who could not afford to pay for medical treatment and were much used for the training of medical students. It was generally accepted at this time that poor relief cases could be used for experimental treatment, and their permission was not required. Bird published in the hospital journal a series of reports on childhood diseases, based on case studies from this work.Balfour, pp. 16‚Äì17 Coley, p. 366 Payne and McConnell Morus, pp. 236‚Äì237 Steel, p. 207Golding Bird \\"Diseases of children\\", Guy's Hospital Reports, series 2, vol. 3, pp. 108‚Äì109, 1845. Marrying Mary Ann Brett in 1842, Bird moved from his family home at Wilmington Square, Clerkenwell, to 19 Myddleton Square. They had two daughters and three sons, the second of whom, Cuthbert Hilton Golding-Bird (1848‚Äì1939), became a notable surgeon.Payne and McConnell \\"Golding-Bird, Cuthbert Hilton (1848‚Äì1939)\\", Plarr's Lives of the Fellows Online, retrieved and archived 10 March 2012.

He joined the Pathological Society of London (which eventually merged into the Royal Society of Medicine) when it was formed in 1846.H. R. Dean, \\"The Pathological Societey of London\\", Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine, vol. 39, pp. 823‚Äì827, 2 July 1946. He also belonged to the London Electrical Society founded by William Sturgeon and others. This body was very unlike the elite scholarly institutions; it was more like a craft guild with a penchant for spectacular demonstrations. Nevertheless, it had some notable members, and new machines and apparatus were regularly discussed and demonstrated.Morus, pp. 99‚Äì124, 235 Bird was also a Freemason from 1841 and was the Worshipful Master of the St Paul's lodge in 1850. He left the Freemasons in 1853.Balfour, p. 17 Payne and McConnellFreemasons' Quarterly Magazine and Review, vol. 1, pp. 84‚Äì85, London: Richard Spencer March 1850. Bird was vain, with a tendency to self-promotion, and his driving ambition occasionally led him into conflict with others. He was involved in a number of very public disputes in contemporary medical journals, including the dispute with the Pulvermacher Company and a dispute over the development of the stethoscope. However, he was said to give his patients his undivided attention and a complete commitment to their welfare. He was a fine speaker, a good lecturer and an eloquent debater.Balfour, pp. 19, 21‚Äì22, 41, 43‚Äì44 Coley, p. 366 Foregger, p. 20 Wilks and Bettany, pp. 247, 249 Winslow, pp. 367‚Äì372 The Golding Bird Gold Medal for sanitary science Diagnosed with heart disease by his brother in 1848 or 1849, Bird was forced to stop work. By 1850, however, he was again working as hard as ever and had extended his practice so much that he needed to move to a larger house in Russell Square. But in 1851, acute rheumatism led Bird to take an extended holiday with his wife in Tenby, where he pursued investigations in botany, marine fauna and cave life as pastimes. These long summer breaks were repeated in 1852 and 1853 at Torquay and Tenby. Even on holiday, his fame caused him to receive many requests for consultations. In 1853, he purchased an estate, St Cuthbert, for his retirement in Tunbridge Wells, but it needed some work, and he could not leave London until June 1854. Meanwhile, he continued to see patients, but only in his house, despite seriously deteriorating health. He died on 27 October 1854 at St Cuthbert from a urinary tract infection and suffering from kidney stones. His early death at 39 may have been due to a combination of lifelong frail health and overwork, which Bird himself knew to be destroying him.Balfour, pp. 17‚Äì18, 62‚Äì63 Coley, p. 364 \\"Obituary\\", The Medical Examiner, vol. 11, p. 46, Philadelphia: Lindsay & Blakiston 1850. He is buried in Woodbury Park Cemetery, Tunbridge Wells.Balfour, pp. 20, 25‚Äì26, 43, 59‚Äì63 Payne and McConnell Steel, pp. 211‚Äì212 After his death, Mary instituted the Golding Bird Gold Medal and Scholarship for sanitary science, later named the Golding Bird Gold Medal and Scholarship for bacteriology, which was awarded annually at Guy's teaching hospital. The prize was instituted in 1887 and was still being awarded in 1983, although it is no longer a current prize. From 1934 onwards, a Golding Bird Gold Medal and Scholarship was also awarded for obstetrics and gynaecology. Among the notable recipients of the medal were Nathaniel Ham (1896), Alfred Salter (1897), Russell Brock (1926), John Beale (1945), and D.

Collateral sciences The collateral sciences are those sciences that have an important role in medicine but do not form part of medicine themselves, especially physics, chemistry, and botany (because botany is a rich source of drugs and poisons). Until the end of the first half of the 19th century, chemical analysis was rarely used in medical diagnosis ‚Äì there was even hostility to the idea in some quarters. Most of the work in this area at that time was carried out by researchers associated with Guy's.Rosenfeld, 2001 By the time Golding Bird was a medical student at Guy's, the hospital already had a tradition of studying physics and chemistry as they related to medicine. Bird followed this tradition and was particularly influenced by the work of William Prout, an expert in chemical physiology. Bird became well known for his knowledge of chemistry. An early example dates from 1832, when he commented on a paper on the copper sulphate test for arsenic poisoning, delivered by his future brother-in-law R. H. Brett to the Pupils' Physical Society. Bird criticised the test's positive result when a green precipitate is formed,Katherine D. Watson, Poisoned Lives: English Poisoners and Their Victims, p. 15, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006 . claiming the test was inconclusive because precipitates other than copper arsenite can produce the same green colour.Coley, pp. 363‚Äì365 Morus, p. 239 Bird did not limit himself to challenging his future brother-in- law. In 1834, Bird and Brett published a paper on the analysis of blood serum and urine, in which they argued against some work by Prout. Prout had said (in 1819) that the pink sediment in urine was due to the presence of ammonium purpurate, but Bird's tests failed to verify this. Though Bird was still only a student and Prout held great authority, Prout felt it necessary to reply to the challenge. In 1843, Bird tried to identify the pink compound; he failed, but was convinced it was a new chemical and gave it the name purpurine.Coley, p. 365 This name did not stick, however, and the compound became known as uroerythrin from the work of Franz Simon.Archibald E. Garrod, \\"A contribution to the study of uroerythrin\\", Journal of Physiology, vol. 17, p. 439, 1895. Its structure was finally identified only in 1975.Josef Ber√ºter, Jean-Pierre Colombo, Urs Peter Schlunegger, \\"Isolation and identification of the urinary pigment uroerythrin\\", European Journal of Biochemistry, vol. 56, iss. 1, pp. 239‚Äì244, August 1975 Around 1839, recognising Bird's abilities in chemistry, Astley Cooper asked him to contribute to his book on breast disease. Bird wrote a piece on the chemistry of milk, and the book was published in 1840.Cooper, Astley, \\"On the anatomy of the breast\\", London: Orme, Green, Brown, and Longmans 1840. Although the book is primarily about human anatomy, it includes a chapter on comparative anatomy covering several species, for which Bird carried out an analysis of dog and porpoise milk.Coley, pp. 365‚Äì366 Also in 1839, Bird published his own Elements of Natural Philosophy, a textbook on physics for medical students. Taking the view that existing texts were too mathematical for medical students, Bird avoided such material in favour of clear explanations. The book proved popular and remained in print for 30 years, although some of its mathematical shortcomings were made good in the fourth edition by Charles Brooke.Coley, p. 367 Morus, p. 239 =Electricity= In 1836, Bird was put in charge of the newly formed department of electricity and galvanism under the supervision of Addison. While this was not the first hospital to employ electrotherapy, it was still considered very experimental. Previous hospital uses had either been short-lived or based on the whim of a single surgeon, such as John Birch at St Thomas' Hospital. At Guy's, the treatment was part of the hospital system and became well known to the public, so much so that Guy's was parodied for its use of electricity in the New Frankenstein satirical magazine.Coley, p. 366 Morus, p. 235 In his electrotherapy, Bird used both electrochemical and electrostatic machines (and later also electromagnetic induction machines) to treat a very wide range of conditions, such as some forms of chorea. Treatments included peripheral nerve stimulation, electrical muscle stimulation and electric shock therapy. Bird also used his invention, the electric moxa, to heal skin ulcers. Electrical equipment Friction electrostatic generators: cylinder (left) and disc (right) designs. According to Bird, the disc design has a greater power output, while the simpler construction of the cylinder makes it easier to operate.Bird, Lectures on Electricity, pp. 104‚Äì105 It was already clear from the work of Michael Faraday that electricity and galvanism were essentially the same. Bird realised this, but continued to divide his apparatus into electrical machines, which (according to him) delivered a high voltage at low current, and galvanic apparatus, which delivered a high current at low voltage. The galvanic equipment available to Bird included electrochemical cells such as the voltaic pile and the Daniell cell, a variant of which Bird devised himself. Also part of the standard equipment were induction coils which, together with an interrupter circuit, were used with one of the electrochemical cells to deliver an electric shock. The electrical (as opposed to galvanic) machines then available were friction-operated electrostatic generators consisting of a rotating glass disc or cylinder on which silk flaps were allowed to drag as the glass rotated. These machines had to be hand-turned during treatment, but it was possible to store small amounts of static electricity in Leyden jars for later use.Coley, pp. 366‚Äì368 Payne and McConnell Simpson, pp. 7‚Äì8 Morus, pp. 179 By 1849, generators based on Faraday's law of induction had become advanced enough to replace both types of machines, and Bird was recommending them in his lectures. Galvanic cells suffered from the inconvenience of having to deal with the electrolyte acids in the surgery and the possibility of spillages; electrostatic generators required a great deal of skill and attention to keep them working successfully. Electromagnetic machines, on the other hand, have neither of these drawbacks; the only criticism levelled by Bird was that the cheaper machines could only deliver an alternating current. For medical use, particularly when treating a problem with nerves, a unidirectional current of a particular polarity was often needed, requiring the machine to have split rings or similar mechanisms. However, Bird considered alternating current machines suitable for cases of amenorrh≈ìa.\\"On the therapeutic employment of electricity\\", British and Foreign Medico-chirurgical Review, vol. 3, no. 6, pp. 373‚Äì387, April 1849.Simpson, pp. 7‚Äì8 The required direction of current depended on the direction in which electric current was thought to flow in nerves in the human or animal body. For motor functions, for instance, the flow was taken to be from the centre towards the muscles at the extremities, so artificial electrical stimulation needed to be in the same direction. For sensory nerves, the opposite applied: flow was from the extremity to the centre, and the positive electrode would be applied to the extremity. This principle was demonstrated by Bird in an experiment with a living frog. A supply of frogs was usually on hand, as they were used in the frog galvanoscope. The electromagnetic galvanometer was available at the time, but frogs' legs were still used by Bird because of their much greater sensitivity to small currents. In the experiment, the frog's leg was almost completely severed from its body, leaving only the sciatic nerve connected, and electric current was then applied from the body to the leg. Convulsions of the leg were seen when the muscle was stimulated. Reversing the current, however, produced no movement of the muscle, merely croaks of pain from the frog. In his lectures, Bird describes many experiments with a similar aim on human sensory organs. In one experiment by Grapengiesser,Grapengiesser was a Berlin doctor who pioneered the treatment of deafness by electricity. See, for instance, Pfeiffer, p. 38 for instance, electric current is passed through the subject's head from ear to ear, causing a sound to be hallucinated. The ear connected to the positive terminal hears a louder sound than that connected to the negative.Bird, Lectures on Electricity, pp. 98‚Äì99 Bird designed his own interrupter circuit for delivering shocks to patients from a voltaic cell through an induction coil. Previously, the interrupter had been a mechanical device requiring the physician to turn a cog wheel or employ an assistant to do so. Bird wished to free his hands to apply the electricity more exactly to the required part of the patient. His interrupter worked automatically by magnetic induction at a reasonably fast rate.Golding Bird, \\"Observations on induced electric currents, with a description of a magnetic contact-breaker\\", Philosophical Magazine, vol. 12, no. 71, pp. 18‚Äì22, January 1838. The faster the interrupter switches, the more frequently an electric shock is delivered to the patient; the aim is to make the frequency as high as possible.Coley, p. 368 Morus, pp. 250‚Äì251 Bird's interrupter had the medically disadvantageous feature that current was supplied in opposite directions during the make and break operations. Treatment often required the current to be supplied in one specified direction only. Bird produced a unidirectional interrupter using a mechanism now called split rings. This design suffered from the disadvantage that automatic operation was lost and the interrupter had once again to be hand-cranked. Nevertheless, this arrangement remained a cheaper option than electromagnetic generators for some time.Morus, pp. 250‚Äì251 Bird, Lectures on Electricity, pp. 119‚Äì122 Treatments Electrotherapeutic treatment to stimulate facial muscles, Duchenne de Boulogne 1862 Three classes of electrotherapy were in use. One was the electric bath, which consisted of sitting the patient on an insulated stool with glass legs and connecting the patient to one electrode, usually the positive one, of an electrostatic machine. The patient's skin became charged as if he or she were in a \\"bath of electricity\\". The second class of treatment could be performed while the patient was in the electric bath. This consisted of bringing a negative electrode close to the patient, usually near the spine, causing sparks to be produced between the electrode and the patient. Electrodes of various shapes were available for different medical purposes and places of application on the body. Treatment was applied in several sessions of around five minutes, often blistering the skin. The third class of treatment was electric shock therapy, in which an electric shock was delivered from a galvanic battery (later electromagnetic generators) via an induction coil to greatly increase the voltage. It was also possible to deliver electric shocks from the charge stored in a Leyden jar, but this was a much weaker shock.Coley, pp. 367‚Äì368 Simpson, pp. 7‚Äì8 Morus, pp. 235‚Äì236 Electric stimulation treatment was used to treat nervous disorders where the nervous system was unable to stimulate a required glandular secretion or muscle activity. It had previously been successfully used to treat some forms of asthma. Bird used his apparatus to treat Sydenham's chorea (St Vitus's dance) and other forms of spasm, some forms of paralysis (although the treatment was of no use where nerves had been physically damaged), opiate overdose (since it kept the patient awake), bringing on menstruation where this had failed (amenorrhoea), and hysteria, a supposed disease of women. Paralysed bladder function in young girls was attributed to the now archaic condition of hysteria. It was treated with the application of a strong electric current between the sacrum and the pubis. Although the treatment worked, in that it caused the bladder to empty, Bird suspected in many cases it did so more through fear and pain than any therapeutic property of electricity.Coley, pp. 368‚Äì369 Smellie, p. 30 (opiates) Smellie, p. 47 (menstruation) Smellie, p. 75 (muscle paralysis) Smellie, pp. 91‚Äì92 (spasm and hysteria) Morus, pp. 146, 240‚Äì241 Electric shock treatment had become fashionable among the public, but often was not favoured by physicians except as a last resort. Its popularity led to many inappropriate treatments, and fraudulent practitioners were widespread. Quack practitioners claimed the treatment as a cure for almost anything, regardless of its effectiveness, and made large sums of money from it. Bird, however, continued to stand by the treatment when properly administered. He convinced an initially sceptical Addison of its merits, and the first publication (in 1837) describing the work of the electrifying unit was authored by Addison, not Bird, although Bird is clearly, and rightly, credited by Addison. Having the paper authored by Addison did a great deal to gain acceptability in a still suspicious medical fraternity. Addison held great authority, whereas Bird at this stage was unknown. Bird's 1841 paper in Guy's Hospital Reports contained an impressively long list of successful case studies. In 1847 he brought the subject fully into the realm of materia medica when he delivered the annual lecture to the Royal College of Physicians on this subject. He spoke out tirelessly against the numerous quack practitioners, in one case exposing railway telegraph operators who were claiming to be medical electricians, although they had no medical training at all. In this way, Bird was largely responsible for the rehabilitation of electrical treatment among medical practitioners. His work, with Addison's support, together with the increasing ease of using the machines as the technology progressed, brought the treatment into wider use in the medical profession.Coley, pp. 368‚Äì369 Payne and McConnell Morus, pp. 146, 236‚Äì237, 292 Thomas Addison, \\"On the influence of electricity, as a remedy in certain convulsive and spasmodic diseases\\", Guy's Hospital Reports, vol. 2, pp. 493‚Äì507, 1837. Electric moxa Bird invented the electric moxa in 1843. The name is a reference to the acupuncture technique of moxibustion and was probably influenced by the introduction of electroacupuncture, in which the needles are augmented by an electric current, two decades earlier in France. The electric moxa, however, was not intended for acupuncture. It was used to produce a suppurating sore on the skin of the patient to treat some conditions of inflammation and congestion by the technique of counter-irritation. The sore had previously been created by much more painful means, such as cautery or even burning charcoal. Bird's design was based on a modification of an existing instrument for the local electrical treatment of hemiplegia, and consisted of a silver electrode and a zinc electrode connected by copper wire. Two small blisters were produced on the skin, to which the two electrodes were then connected and held in place for a few days. Electricity was generated by electrolytic action with body fluids. The blister under the silver electrode healed, but the one under the zinc electrode produced the required suppurating sore.Coley, p. 370 Simpson, p. 8 The healing of the blister under the silver electrode was of no importance for a counter-irritation procedure, but it suggested to Bird that the electric moxa might be used for treating obstinate leg ulcers. This was a common complaint among the working classes in Bird's time, and hospitals could not admit the majority of cases for treatment. The moxa improved the situation by enabling sufferers to be treated as outpatients. The silver electrode of the moxa was applied to the ulcer to be healed, while the zinc electrode was applied a few inches away to a place where the upper layer of skin had been cut away. The whole apparatus was then bandaged in place as before. The technique was successfully applied by others on Bird's recommendation. Thomas Wells later discovered that it was unnecessary to damage the skin under the zinc plate. He merely moistened the skin with vinegar before applying the zinc electrode.Chapman, pp. 1‚Äì2, 90‚Äì92 Pulvermacher controversy Pulvermacher's chain There was some controversy over Bird's endorsement of a machine invented by one I. L. Pulvermacher that became known as Pulvermacher's chain.Isaac Lewis Pulvermacher, \\"Improvement in voltaic batteries and apparatus for medical and other purposes\\", , issued 1 February 1853. The main market for this device was the very quack practitioners that Bird so detested, but it did actually work as a generator. Bird was given a sample of this machine in 1851 and was impressed enough to give Pulvermacher a testimonial stating that the machine was a useful source of electricity. Bird thought that it could be used by physicians as a portable device. Electrically, the machine worked like a voltaic pile, but was constructed differently. It consisted of a number of wooden dowels, each with a bifilar winding of copper and zinc coils. Each winding was connected to the next dowel by means of metal hooks and eyes, which also provided the electrical connection. The electrolyte was provided by soaking the dowels in vinegar.Coley, pp. 369‚Äì370 Lardner, pp. 288‚Äì289 Naively, Bird appears to have expected Pulvermacher not to use this testimonial in his advertising. When Pulvermacher's company did so, Bird suffered some criticism for unprofessional behaviour, although it was never suggested that Bird benefited financially, and Bird stated in his defence that the testimonial was only ever intended as a letter of introduction to physicians in Edinburgh. Bird was particularly upset that Pulvermacher's company had used quotations from Bird's publications about the benefits of electrical treatment and misrepresented them as describing benefits of Pulvermacher's product. Bird also criticised Pulvermacher's claim that the chain could be wrapped around an affected limb for medical treatment. Although the flexible nature of its design lent itself to wrapping, Bird said that it would be next to useless in this configuration. According to Bird, the patient's body would provide a conductive path across each cell, thus preventing the device from building up a medically useful voltage at its terminals.Coley, pp. 369‚Äì370 Golding Bird, \\"Remarks on the hydro-electric chain of Dr. Pulvermacher\\", The Lancet, vol. 2, pp. 388‚Äì389, 1851. John McIntyre, Golding Bird, C. Meinig, \\"Dr. Golding Bird and Pulvermacher's electric chain\\", Association Medical Journal, pp. 316‚Äì317, 1853. =Electrochemistry= Bird used his position as head of the department of electricity and galvanism to further his research efforts and to aid him in teaching his students. He was interested in electrolysis and repeated the experiments of Antoine C√©sar Becquerel, Edmund Davy and others to extract metals in this way. He was particularly interested in the possibility of detecting low levels of heavy metal poisons with this technique, pioneered by Davy.Coley, p. 367 Bird also studied the properties of albumen under electrolysis, finding that the albumen coagulated at the anode because hydrochloric acid was produced there. He corrected an earlier erroneous conclusion by W. T. Brande that high electric current caused coagulation at the cathode also, showing that this was entirely due to fluid flows caused by the strong electric field.Coley, pp. 370‚Äì371 The formation of copper plates on the cathode was noticed in the Daniell cell shortly after its invention in 1836. Bird began a thorough investigation of this phenomenon in the following year. Using solutions of sodium chloride, potassium chloride and ammonium chloride, He succeeded in coating a mercury cathode with sodium, potassium and ammonium respectively, producing amalgams of each of these. Not only chlorides were used; beryllium, aluminium and silicon were obtained from the salts and oxides of these elements.Coley, p. 367 Watt and Philip, pp. 79‚Äì80 In 1837, Bird constructed his own version of the Daniell cell. The novel feature of Bird's cell was that the two solutions of copper sulphate and zinc sulphate were in the same vessel, but kept separate by a barrier of Plaster of Paris, a common material used in hospitals for setting bone fractures. Being porous, Plaster of Paris allows ions to cross the barrier, while preventing the solutions from mixing. This arrangement is an example of a single-cell Daniell cell, and Bird's invention was the first of this kind. Bird's cell was the basis for the later development of the porous pot cell, invented in 1839 by John Dancer.Coley, p. 367 Morus, pp. 177‚Äì183 Watt and Philip, pp. 90‚Äì92 Bird's experiments with his cell were important for the new discipline of electrometallurgy. An unforeseen result was the deposition of copper on and within the plaster, without any contact with the metal electrodes. On breaking apart the plaster it was found that veins of copper were formed running right through it. So surprising was this result that it was at first disbelieved by electrochemical researchers, including Faraday. Deposition of copper and other metals had previously been noted, but only on metal electrodes. Bird's experiments sometimes get him credit for being the founder of the industrial field of electrometallurgy. In particular, Bird's discovery is the principle behind electrotyping. However, Bird himself never made practical use of this discovery, nor did he carry out any work in metallurgy as such. Some of Bird's contemporaries with interests in electrometallurgy wished to bestow the credit on Bird in order to discredit the commercial claims of their rivals.Golding Bird, Report of the Seventh Meeting of the British Society for the Advancement of Science, vol. 6 (1837), p. 45, London: J. Murray, 1838. Bird thought there was a connection between the functioning of the nervous system and the processes seen in electrolysis at very low, steady currents. He knew that the currents in both were of the same order. To Bird, if such a connection existed, it made electrochemistry an important subject to study for biological reasons.Coley, p. 367 Bird, Lectures on Electricity, pp. 33‚Äì62 =Chemistry= Arsenic poisoning In 1837 Bird took part in an investigation of the dangers posed by the arsenic content of cheap candles. These were stearin candles with white arsenic added, which made them burn more brightly than ordinary candles. The combination of cheapness and brightness made them popular. The investigation was conducted by the Westminster Medical Society, a student society of Westminster Hospital, and was led by John Snow, later to become famous for his public health investigations. Snow had previously investigated arsenic poisoning when he and several fellow students were taken badly ill after he introduced a new process for preserving cadavers at the suggestion of lecturer Hunter Lane. The new process involved injecting arsenic into the blood vessels of the corpse. Snow found that the arsenic became airborne as a result of chemical reactions with the decomposing corpse, and this was how it was ingested. Bird's part in the candle investigation was to analyse the arsenic content of the candles, which he found to have recently been greatly increased by the manufacturers. Bird also confirmed by experiment that the arsenic became airborne when the candles were burnt. The investigators exposed various species of animal and bird to the candles in controlled conditions. The animals all survived, but the birds died. Bird investigated the bird deaths and analysed the bodies, finding small amounts of arsenic. No arsenic was found on the feathers, however, indicating that poisoning was not caused by breathing airborne arsenic, since arsenic in the air would be expected to adhere to the feathers. However, Bird found that large amounts of arsenic were in the birds' drinking water, indicating that this was the route taken by the poison.Vinten-Johansen, pp. 69‚Äì72 Carbon monoxide poisoning Although it had been known how to prepare carbon monoxide since 1776, it was not at first recognised that carbon monoxide poisoning was the mechanism of death and injury from stoves burning carbonaceous fuels. A coroner's inquest into the death in 1838 of James Trickey, a nightwatchman who had spent all night by a new type of charcoal burning stove in St Michael, Cornhill, concluded that the poison involved was carbonic acid (that is, carbon dioxide) rather than carbon monoxide. Both Bird and Snow gave evidence to the inquest supporting poisoning by carbonic acid. Bird himself started to suffer ill effects while collecting air samples from the floor near the stove. However, the makers of the stove, Harper and Joyce, produced a string of their own expert witnesses, who convinced the jury to decide that death was caused by apoplexy, and that \\"impure air\\" was only a contributing factor. Among the unscientific claims made at the inquest by Harper and Joyce were that carbonic gas would rise to the ceiling (in fact it is heavier than air and, according to Bird, would lie in a layer close to the floor, just where the sleeping Trickey's head would rest) and that \\"deleterious vapour\\" from the coffins in the vaults had risen into the church. After the inquest Joyce threatened to sue a journal which continued to criticise the stove for its lack of ventilation. In a subsequent clarification, Bird made it clear that any stove burning carbonaceous fuel was dangerous if it did not have a chimney or other means of ventilation. In fact, Trickey had only been placed in the church in the first place at the suggestion of Harper, who was expecting him to give favourable reports of the new stove's performance.Foregger, p. 20 Steventon and Mitchell, p. 38\\"Alleged death from the use of Harper and Joyce' stove\\", Mechanics' Magazine, vol. 30, no. 799, pp. 146‚Äì148, 1 December 1838. Bird read a paper to the Senior Physical Society in 1839, reporting on tests he conducted of the effects on sparrows of poisoning by carbonaceous fumes. This paper was of some importance and resulted in Bird giving his views to the British Association in the same year. (He acted as a secretary to the chemical section of the British Association in Birmingham.) Bird also presented the paper at the Westminster Medical School, where Snow took a special interest in it. Until then, Snow and many others had believed that carbonic acid acted merely by excluding oxygen. The experiments of Bird and others convinced him that it was harmful in its own right, but he still did not subscribe to Bird's view that it was an active poison. Also in 1839, Bird published a comprehensive paper in Guy's Hospital Reports, complete with many case histories, in which he documents the state of knowledge. He realised that at least some cases of poisoning from stoves were due not to carbonic acid, but to some other agent, although he still had not identified it as carbon monoxide.Golding Bird, \\"Observations on poisoning, by the vapours of burning of charcoal and coal\\", The Western Journal of Medicine and Surgery, vol. 2, iss. 9, pp. 215‚Äì219, September 1840.Balfour, p. 16 Coley, p. 366 Vinten-Johansen, p. 90 Urology Uric acid crystals drawn by Bird. On the left are crystals formed in normal urine; on the right, crystals from a patient suffering from kidney stones. Bird did a great deal of research in urology, including the chemistry of both urine and kidney stones, and soon became a recognised expert. This work occupied a large proportion of his effort, and his writings on urinary sediments and kidney stones were the most advanced at the time. His work followed on from, and was much influenced by, that of Alexander Marcet and William Prout. Marcet was also a physician at Guy's; Prout held no position at Guy's, but was connected with the hospital and well known there. For instance, when Marcet discovered a new constituent of kidney stones, xanthic oxide, he sent it to Prout for analysis. Prout discovered a new substance himself in 1822, a constituent of urine which he named melanic acid, because it turned black on contact with air.Rosenfeld, 1999, pp. 49‚Äì50 Coley, p. 363 Bird studied and categorised the collection of stones at Guy's, concentrating particularly on the crystal structures of the nuclei, since stone formation followed once there was a nucleus on which to form. He considered the chemistry of the nuclei to be the most important aspect of stone formation. Bird identified many species of stone, classified by the chemistry of the nucleus, but decided that they all fell within two overall groups: organic stones caused by a malfunctioning bodily process, and excessive inorganic salts causing sediment on which the stone could nucleate.Coley, pp. 371‚Äì373 In 1842, Bird became the first to describe oxaluria, sometimes called Bird's disease, which is sometimes caused by an excess of oxalate of lime in the urine.Carleton, p. 306 Lee, p. 27 Talbott, p. 599 Schmidt, p. 342 This is the most common type of kidney stone. The most common cause of kidney stones is now known to be an excess of calcium in the urine, not oxalate, though Calcium oxalate stones are the most common type, it is the excess of calcium that is the most common cause of their formation. Some people do however have an excess of oxalate in their urine and form Calcium oxalate stones because of that; this can be related to diet, hereditary factors or intestinal diseases. Today we know the most common type of kidney stones are Calcium oxalate (about 74%), Calcium Phosphate, (about 20%), and uric acid (about 4% overall but more common in obese people and those with gout).Johnson, CM et al, Renal Stone Epidemiology: A 25 year study in Rochester Minnesota, Kidney International, 16:624‚Äì631, (1979) In his great work Urinary Deposits, Bird devotes much space to the identification of chemicals in urine by microscopic examination of the appearance of crystals in it. He shows how the appearance of crystals of the same chemical can vary greatly under differing conditions, and especially how the appearance changes with disease. Urinary Deposits became a standard text on the subject; there were five editions between 1844 and 1857. In the fourth edition Bird added a recommendation to wash out the bladder in cases of alkaline urine, after an experiment by Snow showed that stale urine became alkaline when fresh urine was slowly dripped into it. Bird knew that alkaline urine encouraged phosphate precipitation and the consequent encrustation and stone formation. The last edition of Urinary Deposits was updated after Bird's death by Edmund Lloyd Birkett.Balfour, p. 15 Coley, pp. 371‚Äì372 Payne and McConnell Rosenfeld, 1999, p. 50 Vinten-Johansen, p. 109 Bird was the first to recognise that certain forms of urinary casts are an indication of Bright's disease. Casts were first discovered by Henry Bence Jones. They are microscopic cylinders of Tamm- Horsfall protein that have been precipitated in the kidneys and then released into the urine; we know now these casts are normal findings unless they contain cells within them; these cellular casts indicating an abnormality in the kidneys.Taal, MW et al: Brenner and Rector's The Kidney 9th ed. pp 891‚Äì2, 2012Rosenfeld, 1999, p. 50 Vitalism A prevalent idea in the 18th and early 19th centuries was that illness was a result of the condition of the whole body. The environment and the activity of the patient thus played a large part in any treatment. The epitome of this kind of thinking was the concept of the vital force, which was supposed to govern the chemical processes within the body. This theory held that organic compounds could only be formed within living organisms, where the vital force could come into play. This belief had been known to be false ever since Friedrich W√∂hler succeeded in synthesising urea from inorganic precursors in 1828. Nevertheless, the vital force continued to be invoked to explain organic chemistry in Bird's time. Sometime in the middle of the 19th century, a new way of thinking started to take shape, especially among younger physicians, fuelled by rapid advances in the understanding of chemistry. For the first time, it became possible to identify specific chemical reactions with specific organs of the body, and to trace their effects through the various functional relations of the organs and the exchanges between them.Coley, pp. 371‚Äì375 Vinten-Johansen, pp. 85‚Äì86 Among these younger radicals were Bird and Snow; among the old school was William Addison (a different person from Bird's superior at Guy's). Addison disliked the modern reliance on laboratory and theoretical results favoured by the new generation, and challenged Richard Bright (who gave his name to Bright's disease) when Bright suggested that the source of the problem in oedema was the kidneys. Addison preferred to believe that the condition was caused by intemperance or some other external factor, and that since the whole body had been disrupted, it could not be localised to a specific organ. Addison further challenged Bright's student, Snow, when in 1839 Snow suggested from case studies and laboratory analysis that oedema was associated with an increase in albumin in the blood. Addison dismissed this as a mere epiphenomenon. Bird disagreed with Snow's proposed treatment, but his arguments clearly show him to be on the radical side of the debate, and he completely avoided whole-body arguments. Snow had found that the proportion of urea in the urine of his patients was low and concluded from this that urea was accumulating in the blood, and therefore proposed bloodletting to counter this. Bird disputed that increased urea in the blood was the cause of kidney disease and doubted the effectiveness of this treatment, citing the results of Fran√ßois Magendie, who had injected urea into the blood, apparently with no ill effects. It is not clear whether Bird accepted Snow's reasoning that urea must be accumulating, or whether he merely adopted it for the sake of argument; while a student in 1833, he had disputed this very point with another of Bright's students, George Rees.Vinten-Johansen, pp. 85‚Äì86, 105John Snow, \\"The anasarca which follows scarlatina\\", The Lancet, vol. 1, pp. 441‚Äì442, 14 December 1839. Justus von Liebig is another important figure in the development of the new thinking, although his position is ambiguous. He explained chemical processes in the body in terms of addition and subtraction of simple molecules from a larger organic molecule, a concept that Bird followed in his own work. But even the materialistic Liebig continued to invoke the vital force for processes inside living animal bodies. This seems to have been based on a belief that the entire living animal is required for these chemical processes to take place. Bird helped to dispel this kind of thinking by showing that specific chemistry is related to specific organs in the body rather than to the whole animal. He challenged some of Liebig's conclusions concerning animal chemistry. For example, Liebig had predicted that the ratio of uric acid to urea would depend on the level of activity of a species or individual; Bird showed this to be false. Bird also felt that it was not enough simply to count atoms as Liebig did, but that an explanation was also required as to why the atoms recombined in one particular way rather than any other. He made some attempts to provide this explanation by invoking the electric force, rather than the vital force, based on his own experiments in electrolysis.Coley, pp. 371‚Äì375 Brock, p. 310 Rosenfeld, 2003, p. 1701 Wermuth, p. 5 Rosenfeld, 1999, p. 50 Flexible stethoscope Bird's flexible stethoscope Bird designed and used a flexible tube stethoscope in June 1840, and in the same year he published the first description of such an instrument. In his paper he mentions an instrument already in use by other physicians (Drs. Clendinning and Stroud), which he describes as the \\"snake ear trumpet\\". He thought this instrument had some severe technical faults; in particular, its great length led to poor performance. The form of Bird's invention is similar to the modern stethoscope, except that it has only one earpiece. An ill- tempered exchange of letters occurred in the London Medical Gazette between another physician, John Burne, and Bird. Burne claimed that he also used the same instrument as Clendinning and Stroud and was offended that Bird had not mentioned him in his paper. Burne, who worked at the Westminster Hospital, pointed with suspicion to the fact that Bird's brother Frederic also worked there. In a reply full of anger and sarcasm, Bird pointed out that in his original paper he had already made clear that he claimed no credit for the earlier instrument.London Medical Gazette, vol. 2; Burne, criticism of Bird in a footnote, p. 471, 11 June 1841 Bird, \\"Reply to Dr. Burne\\", pp. 510‚Äì511, 18 June 1841 Burne, \\"The flexible stethoscope\\" p. 590, 2 July 1841 Bird found the flexible stethoscope convenient as it avoided uncomfortably leaning over patients (as would be required by a rigid stethoscope) and the earpiece could be passed to other doctors and students to listen. It was particularly useful for Bird, with his severe rheumatism, as he could apply the stethoscope to the patient from a seated position.Golding Bird, \\"Advantages presented by the employment of a stethoscope with a flexible tube\\", London Medical Gazette, vol. 1, pp. 440‚Äì442, 11 December 1840. Wilks, p. 490 Wilks and Bettany, pp. 246‚Äì247 Elements of Natural Philosophy When Bird took up lecturing on science at Guy's, he could not find a textbook suitable for his medical students. He needed a book that went into some detail of physics and chemistry, but which medical students would not find overwhelmingly mathematical. Bird reluctantly undertook to write such a book himself, based on his 1837‚Äì1838 lectures, and the result was Elements of Natural Philosophy, first published in 1839. It proved to be spectacularly popular, even beyond its intended audience of medical students, and went through six editions. Reprints were still being produced more than 30 years later in 1868. The fourth edition was edited by Charles Brooke, a friend of Bird's, after the latter's death. Brooke made good many of Bird's mathematical omissions. Brooke edited further editions and, in the sixth edition of 1867, thoroughly updated it.Brooke and Bird, Elements Balfour, p. 15 Coley, p. 367 Payne and McConnell The book was well received and was praised by reviewers for its clarity. The Literary Gazette, for instance, thought that it \\"teaches us the elements of the entire circle of natural philosophy in the clearest and most perspicuous manner\\". The reviewer recommended it as suitable not just for students and not just for the young, saying that it \\"ought to be in the hands of every individual who desires to taste the pleasures of divine philosophy, and obtain a competent knowledge of that creation in which they live\\".\\"Review: Elements of natural philosophy\\", The Literary Gazette, vol. 23, no. 1194, p. 777, 7 December 1839. Medical journals, on the other hand, were more restrained in their praise. The Provincial Medical and Surgical, for instance, in its review of the second edition, thought that it was \\"a good and concise elementary treatise ... presenting in a readable and intelligible form, a great mass of information not to be found in any other single treatise\\". But the Provincial had a few technical quibbles, among which was the complaint that there was no description of the construction of a stethoscope. The Provincial reviewer thought that the book was particularly suitable for students who had no previous instruction in physics. The sections on magnetism, electricity and light were particularly recommended.\\"Review: Elements of natural philosophy, second edition\\", Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal, p. 64. 1 May 1844. In their review of the 6th edition, Popular Science Review noted that the author was now named as Brooke and observed that he had now made the book his own. The reviewers looked back with nostalgia to the book they knew as \\"the Golding Bird\\" when they were students. They note with approval the many newly included descriptions of the latest technology, such as the dynamos of Henry Wilde and Werner von Siemens, and the spectroscope of Browning.\\"Golding Bird's natural philosophy\\", The Popular Science Review, vol. 6, no. 25, pp. 434‚Äì435, 1867. The scope of the book was wide-ranging, covering much of the physics then known. The 1839 first edition included statics, dynamics, gravitation, mechanics, hydrostatics, pneumatics, hydrodynamics, acoustics, magnetism, electricity, atmospheric electricity, electrodynamics, thermoelectricity, bioelectricity, light, optics, and polarised light. In the 1843 second edition Bird expanded the material on electrolysis into its own chapter, reworked the polarised light material, added two chapters on \\"thermotics\\" (thermodynamics ‚Äì a major omission from the first edition), and a chapter on the new technology of photography. Later editions also included a chapter on electric telegraphy. Brooke was still expanding the book for the sixth and final edition. New material included the magnetic properties of iron in ships and spectrum analysis.Bird, Elements, pp. xi‚Äìxxiv 1839 Bird, Elements, pp. xi‚Äìxxxvii 1848 Brooke, Elements, pp. v‚Äìxix 1867 Coley, p. 367 Morus, p. 239 Christian works Bird was a committed Christian throughout his life. Despite his extremely busy professional life, he meticulously observed the Sabbath and saw to the Christian education of his children. He showed generosity to the poor, offering them treatment at his house every morning before going about his professional schedule. After it became clear that the remainder of his life was going to be very limited, he devoted much time to his religion. He wanted to promote Christian teachings and Bible reading among medical students. From 1853 Bird organised a series of religious meetings of medical professionals in London, aiming to encourage physicians and surgeons to exert a religious influence over their students.Balfour pp. 17‚Äì22, 45 Steel, pp. 207‚Äì210 For several years prior to 1853, student prayer meetings had been held in some of the London hospitals, particularly St Thomas'. Bird aimed to mould this movement into a formal association, an ambition which was to crystallise as the Christian Medical Association. He was heavily influenced in this by the Medical Missionary Society of John Hutton Balfour at Edinburgh University. Bird aimed to form a national body with a chapter in each teaching hospital; a prototype student group was already in existence at Guy's. He was strongly opposed by some sections of the medical profession, who felt that students should concentrate on their studies. Among the insults levelled at Bird were \\"saponaceous piety\\" and being a Mawworm. This opposition continued after the formation of the Association. The constitution of the new Christian Medical Association was agreed at Bird's home on 17 December 1853 in a meeting of medical and surgical teachers and others. It was based on a draft prepared by the Guy's student group. Bird died before the inaugural public meeting of the Association in November 1854 at Exeter Hall.Balfour pp. 46, 48‚Äì49, 50‚Äì53, 55 Coley, pp. 375‚Äì376 Steel, p. 209 Francis Davies, \\"Editor's letter box: Medical students\\", Association Medical Journal, vol. 1 (new series), no. 49, p. 1090, 9 December 1853. \\"News and topics of the day: Christian Medical Association\\", Association Medical Journal, vol. 2 (new series), no. 98, p. 1047, 17 November 1854. Bird was quick to defend the virtuousness of students. In November 1853, in a reply to a letter from a student in the Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal complaining of a lack of moral care from his superiors, Bird attacked the prevalent public view that students were \\"guilty of every kind of open vice and moral depravity\\". Bird laid much of the blame for this public opinion on the caricatures of students in the writings of Charles Dickens. He went on to say that the behaviour and character of students had greatly improved over the preceding ten years. He attributed this improvement in part to the greatly increased study requirements imposed on students, but also in part to Christian influences acting on them. He also commented that pious students had once been ridiculed, but were now respected.Golding Bird, \\"Editor's letter box: Medical students\\", Association Medical Journal, vol. 1 (new series), no. 47, pp. 1042‚Äì1043, 25 November 1853.Balfour, 47‚Äì48 Works * Elements of Natural Philosophy; being an experimental introduction to the study of the physical sciences, London: John Churchill, 1839 . * Lectures on Electricity and Galvanism, in their physiological and therapeutical relations, delivered at the Royal College of Physicians, in March 1847, London: Wilson & Ogilvy, 1847 . * Lectures on the Influence of Researches in Organic Chemistry on Therapeutics, especially in relation to the depuration of the blood, delivered at the Royal College of Physicians, London: Wilson & Ogilvy, 1848 . * Urinary Deposits, their diagnosis, pathology and therapeutical indications, London: John Churchill, 1844 .

LGBT rights in the state have been a recent occurrence, with most improvements occurring from the 2010s onward. Same-sex sexual activity has been legal since 1998, and same-sex marriage has been legal since 2015. In addition, Atlanta has a vibrant LGBT community, and holds one of the biggest Pride parades in the Southeast. The state's hate crime laws, effective since June 26th, 2020, explicitly include sexual orientation.https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Georgia-s-Kemp-signs-hate- crimes-law-after-outcry-15369340.php Laws against homosexuality Homosexuality was previously criminalized based on the sodomy laws (which applied to both homosexuals and heterosexuals) which was struck down in 1998 by Powell v. Georgia (years before the 2003 federal-level strikedown by Lawrence v. Texas). Recognition of same-sex relationships Atlanta Pride, 2007 =Same-sex marriage= On November 2, 2004, Georgia voters approved Constitutional Amendment 1, which made it unconstitutional for the state to recognize or perform same-sex marriages or civil unions. On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that the fundamental right to marry must be guaranteed to same-sex couples. As a result, same-sex marriages became legal in the state of Georgia, along with all other U.S. states where such marriages were banned. Following the Supreme Court ruling, all Georgia counties began immediately (or were either willing) to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. =Domestic partnership= Prior to the nationwide legalization of same-sex marriages, some cities and counties in Georgia offered domestic partnership benefits to same-sex couples, which granted some of the marriage rights. Domestic partnerships were recognized by the cities of Athens, Atlanta, Avondale Estates, Clarkston, Decatur, Doraville, East Point, Pine Lake and Savannah, as well as DeKalb County and Fulton County. Adoption and parental rights On February 23, 2018, the Georgia State Senate passed the Keep Faith in Adoption and Foster Care Act (or SB 375), that called for allowing private adoption agencies receiving state funds to deny adoptions for certain couples or individual parents based on religious beliefs. Opponents claimed the bill targeted same- sex couples and LGBT individuals seeking to adopt. The Georgia House of Representatives did not eventually vote on the bill, effectively killing it. The bill was reintroduced by Senator Marty Harbin on February 5, 2020, under the name SB 368, and is soon to be referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. On March 5, 2018, Governor Nathan Deal signed into law bill HB 159, which includes no restrictions against same-sex couples seeking to adopt. There are no restrictions on either IVF or surrogacy. Discrimination protections thumbright300pxMap of Georgia counties and cities that enacted sexual orientation and/or gender identity anti‚Äìemployment discrimination ordinances prior to Bostock v. Clayton County: Since June 26, 2020, Georgia protects its citizens from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Prior to Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, state law did not protect against employee discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. However, some cities and counties in the state have enacted local ordinances banning such discrimination in varying degrees. The cities of Atlanta, Clarkston and Doraville have ordinances prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in both public and private employment. Gwinnett County has a Human Relations Commission that ensures fair and equal treatment and opportunity for all persons, with protections including gender identity and sexual orientation. In 2020, County Commissioner Ku stated that internal Gwinnett County policies were updated to provide protection that includes protections with gender identity and sexual orientation for public employmenthttps://www.instagram.com/p/CA8YXvehEqY/?igshid=1d4ycy28zy7ht Additional cities have enacted more limited protections, prohibiting discrimination against public municipal employees only. The cities of Athens, Augusta, Avondale Estates, Columbus, Decatur, Macon, Pine Lake and Savannah have ordinances banning discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in public employment, while the cities of East Point, Sandy Springs, and Tybee Island, as well as the counties of DeKalb and Fulton have similar anti‚Äìdiscrimination ordinances in public employment covering only sexual orientation. =Glenn v. Brumby= Note that statutory law does not provide protections based on gender identity, but on December 6, 2011, in Glenn v. Brumby, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower-court ruling that firing someone based on gender-nonconformity violates the Constitution‚Äôs prohibition on sex discrimination. The Court of Appeals found the Georgia General Assembly had discriminated against Vandy Beth Glenn, a transgender woman who was fired from her job as legislative editor after telling her supervisor that she planned to transition from male to female. This effectively provides legal protections to transgender and gender non- conforming employees in the states of Alabama, Florida and Georgia. =Anti‚Äìbullying laws= Georgia law bans bullying at schools, though it does not list individual protected groups. Nonetheless, DeKalb County and Fulton County have regulations for teachers that address bullying and harassment based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Gwinnett County Public schools prohibits discrimination by sexual orientation and gender identity in their Student Conduct Behavior Code. Hate crime law Both sexual orientation and gender identity are explicitly covered under the U.S. federal hate crime law since Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act was signed into law in October 2009 by Barack Obama - right after being passed (as an attachment to a military funding authorisation bill) by US Congress. In June 2020, the Georgia General Assembly overwhelmingly passed (47-6 vote in the Senate and 127-38 vote in the House) a hate crimes bill that explicitly includes sexual orientation. The bill was signed into law by Governor of Georgia Brian P. Kemp on June 26th, 2020. Gender reassignment Georgia permits post-operative transgender people to amend their sex on their birth certificates.Human Rights Campaign: Georgia Birth Certificate Law: Gender Identity Issues , accessed July 6, 2011 US citizenship court case In August 2020, a Georgia federal judge within Atlanta granted a daughter of two American married same-sex father's US citizenship - despite being born in England to a surrogate.

It is located northwest of Cut Bank, Montana. It was closed in 1965. History The facility was hosted by the 681st Aircraft Control and Warning (AC&W;) Squadron, Air Defense Command between April 1952 and June 1965. Cut Bank AFS replaced an earlier radar site at Del Bonita, Montana (LP-24) which had opened in March 1951. The 681st AC&W; Squadron started operating AN/FPS-3 and AN/FPS-4 radars in April 1952, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. In 1958 an AN/FPS-20 search radar replaced the AN/FPS-3 at this site. In the following year two AN/FPS-6B height-finder radars superseded the AN/FPS-4. In 1961 this site was integrated into the SAGE system, the squadron being re-designated as the 681st Radar Squadron (SAGE). The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. In 1962 the AN/FPS-20A was further upgraded and redesignated as an AN/FPS-66. In 1963 one AN/FPS-6B was removed and on 31 July, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-24. In 1964 the other AN/FPS-6B was upgraded to an AN/FPS-90, and an AN/FPS-26A height-finder radar was installed. In addition to the main facility, Cut Bank operated an AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler site: * Browning, MT (P-24A) * Sweetgrass, MT (P-24C) The station was closed on 1 March 1965 as part of a general reduction of ADC.

It was opened in 1940, but before the end of the 1950s‚Äîless than 20 years later‚Äîbusiness operations were already moving to another new office at Mutual Park in Pinelands (north east of the city centre); since then Old Mutual has become an international business and their present head office is in London. The building is a fine example of art deco architecture and design, and it has many interesting internal features such as the banking hall, assembly room, directors' board room; external features include a dramatic ziggurat structure, prismoid (triangular) windows, and one of the longest carved stone friezes in the world. It has been said that it provides evidence of the colonial attitudes of the time, and the \\"ideals of colonial government promulgated by Rhodes in the late nineteenth century\\". The Mutual Building is now converted to residential use, although some parts of the building are used commercially. For example, the Banking Hall (which is now an events venue) and the retail shops that operate outside on the ground level. History =The business= The Old Mutual business has a long history. In 1845 John Fairbairn (a Scot) founded \\"The Mutual Life Assurance Society of the Cape of Good Hope\\" in Cape Town. Over the next 100 years the business was to evolve significantly, changing its name in 1885 to the \\"South Africa Mutual Life Assurance Society\\", but becoming familiarly known simply as \\"The Old Mutual\\", so as to distinguish it from newer businesses of the same kind. The company employed women as early as 1901, expanded into Namibia in 1920 and into Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia) in 1927. Old Mutual is now an international business with offices all over the world, and its portfolio of financial services continues to evolve to meet market needs. It is now some years since the business \\"de-mutualised\\" in order to issue shares and fund its operations using conventional investment markets. =The \\"new\\" (1940) Head Office in Darling Street= The name of the building in English and in Afrikaans (\\"Mutual Gebou\\"): The interesting frieze shown here is described in the text In the 1930s it became clear that a new headquarters building was needed and very ambitious targets were set for the building: it was to be the tallest building in South Africa (possibly in the whole continent of Africa, with the exception of the pyramids in Egypt), it was to have the fastest lifts, it was to have the largest windows. At the same time it was to epitomise the values of the business: \\"Strength, Security and Confidence in the Future\\"; this demanded a combination of traditional and contemporary design. Although it is clearly identified on the exterior as the \\"Mutual Building\\" (or \\"Mutual Gebou\\" in Afrikaans) it is often familiarly referred to as \\"The Old Mutual Building\\". Here, in the body of this article, it will be referred to as the \\"Mutual Building\\", thereby acknowledging the nomenclature on the exterior of the building itself. =Search for inspiration= Some comparisons with earlier inspirational buildings The figure here (adapted from www.skycrapers.com) compares the building with some of the other contemporaneous tall buildings in the world. Those involved in the design of the building travelled widely to study inspirational examples of corporate buildings elsewhere in the world. They learnt about the latest approaches to lighting, ventilation and fire protection in the USA, South America, England and Sweden. In the USA, the Eastern Columbia Building in Los Angeles is one example of the genre of building design that captured their attention: this building was completed in 1930 and has also since been converted to residential occupation. The art deco style was chosen. However, the building is embellished with features in other styles (such as neo- classicist in the case of the banking hall) intended to reinforce the long- standing and traditional values of the Old Mutual business. =Completion= The building was completed in 1939 and opened early in 1940 with a great fanfare. The local paper provided a 16 page supplement,Cape Times (1940). \\"Old Mutual in New Home\\", The Cape Times (special supplement) (30 January) and South African architects and dignitaries enthused about it. In his definitive examination of the design of the building, Federico Freschi summarises the status of the building thus: :\\"Ultimately, the consensus suggests that the Old Mutual Building is at once a worthy monument to modern design principles and the consolidation of an important corporate and public image.\\" The building is listed elsewhere as a notable building, and it is regarded as an important example of the social values of the time and of the economic state of the nation, but all as seen from a European or \\"colonial\\" perspective, as explained by Freschi. =Vacating and conversion= Within 20 years (in the late 1950s) the Old Mutual began to vacate the building, moving in stages to new offices at Mutual Park in Pinelands, Cape Town. By the 1990s, only assorted tenants remained, the last of which departed in May 2003. At this time, conversion to residential occupation began under the direction of Robert Silke at Louis Karol Architects. The name of the building was changed by the developers to Mutual Heights, a decision that did not find favour with all owners and residents involved in the new community.Minutes of the Annual General Meeting of the Body Corporate, Mutual Heights, 2008 Despite scepticism about the name, it is generally agreed that the conversion was the first in a series of projects that re-invigorated the central business district of Cape Town. The conversion has been the subject of a number of architecture and design awards. In February 2012, the large \\"Old Mutual\\" sign on the east side of the building was removed, leaving little external evidence of the commercial origins of the building; in 2015 Old Mutual Properties finally disposed of the remaining portions of the interior that had not been sold previously, including the banking hall, the directors suite and the fresco room. Structure of the building The building is constructed using reinforced concrete, filled in internally with bricks and plaster, and clad on the outside with granite. At first sight, the building is a striking example of the Art Deco style and many of its features epitomize this genre - however, some interior features deviate from true Art Deco and probably reflect the desire of the company to demonstrate solidity and traditional values at the same time as contemporaneous, forward-looking values. It is high, as measured from the ground floor to the top of the tower, but the building is often listed as being more than 90 metres high (even as high as 96.8 metres on the Old Mutual web site); this probably takes account of the \\"spire\\" at the top. Having only 10 levels (\\"storeys\\") above ground level in the main part of this tall building (excluding the three levels of basement car parking, and the additional levels in the tower), it is evident that the spacing between floors is generous -- generally each floor is about above (or below) the next. In one of the meeting rooms on the eighth level (the Assembly Hall - see below), the curtains alone are more than six metres long. This generous spacing between floors was intended to achieve the greatest possible overall height for the building without exceeding the city planning limitation of 10 storeys, and it was allowed only in view of the \\"set back\\" design of the exterior structure. Design elements The original design of the building is attributed to Louw & Louw (Cape Town architects), working with Fred Glennie (best known at the time as a mentor to architectural students) - Mr Glennie is personally credited with most of the detailed work but Ivan Mitford-Barberton was also involved with some internal details as well as with the external granite decorations. It is pleasing that the principal areas of the building have been so little changed over the years, especially the entrance, the banking hall, the assembly room, the directors' room, the atrium, and the windows. Even the original door handles (including the Old Mutual \\"logo\\") and the original banisters (on the staircases) are all still intact, and the atrium is largely unchanged although it is now protected from the weather by a translucent roof. The original light fittings in the \\"public\\" areas are largely still intact, and in most parts of the building there are beautiful block-wood (parquet) floors. Here is a selection of interior design details that exemplify the quality and attention to detail that was applied to this project by the architects, artists and designers.

Features of the building The building incorporates a range of significant features. =The Entrance Hall= The entrance lobby Black, gold-veined onyx is used in the Darling Street foyer, the ceiling of which is over 15 metres high and finished with gold leaf, laid by Italian workmen. The view of the glass window over the door to the banking hall (above) shows the iconic ziggurat shape of the building etched into the glass. Visitors must climb 17 steps to gain access to the banking hall, and towards the top they are met by the original \\"pill box\\" where security staff can observe who (and what) is entering and leaving the building. On either side of the pill box are the entrances to the main lifts - two on the left and two on the right (there are two \\"staff\\" lifts and one \\"service\\" lift elsewhere in the building). Characteristic stainless steel trim and light fittings, such as can be seen here, are used extensively throughout the building. =The Banking Hall= Given its tall marble-clad colonnades, the magnificent banking hall would be more properly described as an example of \\"neo-classicism\\" although the light fittings echo the art deco theme that prevails elsewhere in the building, and again we see that the glass over the doors (at the far end in the photograph below) are etched with the iconic ziggurat form that is taken by the whole building. The two service counters that can be seen in the banking hall look identical, but only the one on the right is original‚Äîthe one on the left is a later, somewhat inferior, copy. The banking hall Between the columns of the banking hall the coats of arms are presented for each of the many provinces and countries within Southern Africa in which the South African Mutual Life Assurance Society had a presence.

Each door has an etched representation of an indigenous bird or animal from South Africa, with significant plants as additional decoration, or in some cases the corporate logo of the time. There are seven lifts in the building, four of them \\"principal\\" lifts (as here) The individual etchings in detail (click on the images to see the full-size version): Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 021.jpgSpringbok (Antidorcas marsupialis), with a king protea (Protea cynaroides), the national flower Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 022.jpgKudu (Tragelaphus), with veltheimia (Veltheimia bracteata) at the lower right Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 023.jpgGiraffe, with a succulent (Crassula) Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 024.jpgZebra (Equus quagga), with a prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica) Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 025.jpgOstrich (Struthio camelus australus), with prickly pear (lower left) and \\"century plant\\" (Agave americana) Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 026.jpgCrane (Balearica regulorm) with reeds behind (Phragmites australis) Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 027.jpgSecretary bird (Sagittarius serpentarius), with unidentifiable tree Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 028.jpgVulture Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 030.jpgLeopard (Panthera pardus pardus), with spekboom (Portulacaria afra) at the lower right and candelabra lily (Brunsvigia josephinae) at the lower left Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 031.jpgLion, with lion's tail (or wild dagga - Leonotis leonuris) at lower left, violet painted petals (Freesia laxa) lower right and coral tree (Erythrina lysistemon) at the top Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 020.jpgThe corporate \\"logo\\" (three entwined anchors), with Strelitzia reginae (bottom right), Disa uniflora (bottom left) and proteas (Protea repens) at the top These designs are attributed to Ivan Mitford-Barberton. =The Assembly Room= The Assembly RoomPerhaps the best known feature of the building (in artistic circles at least) is the Assembly Room, sometimes referred to as the \\"Fresco Room\\"; Freschi indicates that this was originally intended as a facility for policy holders. Here there are striking frescoes depicting some of the history of the nation of South Africa, undertaken by Le Roux Smith Le Roux two years after the completion of the building. Le Roux was supported in his early career by the famous British architect Herbert Baker, who provided bursaries so that Le Roux could spend time in London and elsewhere. In London he undertook a mural in South Africa House with Eleanor Esmonde-White. An acquaintance (still living) of Le Roux and Esmonde-White recalls that Baker insisted that Eleanor Esmonde-White be awarded a bursary, despite gender- related objections from elsewhere; in the event she got to go to London with Le Roux, with the bursary. Following their years in London, Le Roux was awarded this commission to work on the Mutual Building and he therefore returned to Cape Town, but only after the main building work was done - it was not sensible to undertake this meticulous work while building operations were still in progress. These frescoes are considered elsewhere as good examples of the genre‚Äîsee for example \\"Decopix - the Art Deco Architecture Site\\" where the Mutual Building itself is well represented. The five frescoes on the end walls and over the entrance depict more than 100 years of the history of the nation, including industrial development, the Great Trek, mining following the discovery of gold, the growth of industry and agriculture, and a hint of international travel and trade. Freschi considers that \\".. in contemporary terms, Le Roux's work was seen to be distinctly progressive and very much in keeping with the ostensibly liberal party line of Jan Smuts' coalition government\\". The panels are reproduced below, and selected portions from them are provided in the images that follow. The five panels are presented left to right, in a clockwise direction when standing in the Assembly Room, back to the windows. The first and fifth are on the side walls, the second, third and fourth are on the long wall that includes the main entrance.

This did not remain true for long, it was only one year later that the General Post Office was built on the other (seaward side) of Darling Street, and a large number of larger more modern buildings have been built since (see the views from and of the building, shown further down this page). Some details from the panels: Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 093.jpgMixing concrete, working with the plans Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 094.jpgWind-powered water pumps provide irrigation Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 095.jpgThe Great Trek - ladies in their bonnets, men on horses Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 096.jpgFarm produce at last - a smile on his face Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 097.jpgA detail - laying railway track Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 098.jpgThe image of the Mutual Building under Table Mountain In 2016 the Assembly room was purchased for private use, and with the adjoining sections of the building it is being re-finished as private accommodation. =The Directors' Rooms= On the fourth level, at the front of the building, is the Directors' Board Room. As well as the board room there are two side rooms, one of which was a sitting room for Directors. The Directors' Board Room In the board room there is a continuous carved stinkwood frieze above the dado rail that incorporates animal and floral motifs (14 different species of birds and animals are represented). Ivan Mitford-Barberton is credited with this carving and it is probably the last work that he did in the building. Above the carved frieze is a mural designed and executed by Joyce Ord-Brown using stain on pale sycamore panelling. It represents Cape Town as the \\"Tavern of the Seas\\" in a light hearted way.. The curtains are notable, being hand woven in a workshop in Eswatini (also known as Swaziland), by Coral Stephens Handweaving, a company established in the 1940s.Email to Andy Bytheway from Murrae Stephens, Wed 2014/10/01 11:53 AM The selections below show some portions of the mural and the frieze, followed by some other details of the directors' rooms. The sea plane (second picture) is probably a Martin M-130, which is not recorded as having serviced South Africa (it worked the pacific routes). This is probably \\"artistic licence\\" on the part of Ord-Browne.

The Directors' suite has great heritage value but in 2015 it was re-finished and it is now used as offices for a heritage-related project management business. =The atrium= On entering the residential area of the building, one is struck by this extraordinary \\"top to bottom\\" atrium The atrium extends from the roof of the banking hall to the very top of the main building. It was originally open to the weather, but it is now protected by a translucent roof, through which the tower can be seen extending even higher. The circular windows visible here are incorporated into the apartments that now occupy the front of the building. =The windows= The rising nature of the ziggurat mass of the exterior of the building is reinforced by the prismoid (triangular) windows, which extend up and down the height of the building. These windows are of note because they set the Mutual Building apart from some of the buildings that inspired it, for example the Eastern Columbia Building in Los Angeles. They are also functional, because they allow light to enter the building more effectively than would otherwise be the case (using the reflective properties of the inside face of the glass), and by opening and closing blinds on the one side or the other it is possible on sunny days to manage the heat entering the building as the sun traverses the sky. Water- cooled air conditioning was another innovative feature of the original building, that avoided the need for extensive natural ventilation and allowed more freedom for the design of the windows and granite spaces between; the same water-cooled air conditioning design is in use today. As Freschi notes in his paper, the prismoid windows make for much more visual interest than the conventional windows in the General Post Office building. Here the image juxtaposes the Mutual building (foreground) with the General Post Office built the following year (behind). The windows compared =Granite cladding= The granite cladding of the building was hewn from a single boulder on the Paarl Mountain, north east of the city of Cape Town. The cladding incorporates decorative baboon, elephant and tribal heads that project from the upper facades of the Darling Street elevation (the front of the building). Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 114.jpgThe decorations Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 108.jpgElephant (6th level) Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 109.jpgBaboon (8th level) Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 110.jpgTribal head (tower) Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 111.jpgTower with tribal head =The Tribal Figures= On the Parliament Street facade there are carved granite figures representing nine ethnic African groups (not just South African) labelled thus: \\"Xosa\\", \\"Pedi\\", \\"Maasai\\", \\"Matabele\\", \\"Basuto\\", \\"Barotse\\", \\"Kikuyu\\", \\"Zulu\\", and \\"Bushman\\". Note that the identification of the tribes does not necessarily follow current practice. The nine tribal figures looking over Parliament Street. The individual figures in detail (remember you can click on the images to see the full-size version): Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 001.jpg\\"Xosa\\" Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 002.jpg\\"Pedi\\" Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 003.jpg\\"Masai\\" Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 004.jpg\\"Matabele\\" Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 005.jpg\\"Basuto\\" Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 006.jpg\\"Barotse\\" Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 007.jpg\\"Kikuyu\\" Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 008.jpg\\"Zulu\\" Image:Mutual Building Cape Town 009.jpg\\"Bushman\\" Recently Sanford S. Shaman has written a critique of these figures, and other features of the building partly based on interviews with pedestrians walking around the building. =The frieze= Around the three sides of the building facing Darling Street, Parliament Street and Longmarket Street there is a 386 feet (118 metre) frieze depicting scenes from the colonial history of South Africa, reported at its completion to be the longest such frieze in the world. A portion of the 386 feet frieze that traverses three sides of the building, showing the 1820 settlers landing It is of interest that, at the time, it was proclaimed that the building was built by South Africans, using South African materials; while the frieze was itself designed by South African, Ivan Mitford Barberton (born in Somerset East, Eastern Cape, in 1896), the work was executed by a team of Italian immigrants led by Adolfo Lorenzi. It has recently come to light that, in the course of the work, Lorenzi's team of masons were incarcerated when the Second World War broke out in 1939, being Italian and therefore regarded as \\"the enemy\\" at that time. They were obliged to finish their work under an armed guard.Correspondence by email, Giovanni Adolfo Camerada to Andy Bytheway, 2008 A composite showing almost all of the frieze in its 15 sections - some portions are missing in this version - click to see a readable version and then choose the \\"Full resolution\\" option under the image (but be patient, this is a large file - 1Mb)A composite view of the frieze can be seen at the right; unfortunately in this version some portions are missing or obscured by trees in leaf.

The Mutual Building can claim that its restoration and conversion to residential use brought new life to the city centre, and started a five year programme of re- invigoration and rapid improvement. The large green \\"Old Mutual\\" sign and logo were removed from the building in February 2012. The skyline of the city of Cape Town has changed significantly since the Mutual Building was constructed. Even from its highest point of easy access, the Mutual Building View is now dwarfed by the more modern buildings in the Cape Town central business district. In the modern skyline the Mutual Building is lost in a maze of tall buildings. Here the sea mist swirls around the central business district and the small coloured arrow picks out the Mutual Building, at the left.

Click to see the full size version of this photograph, when the outline of the building can be more easily discerned. The view of the harbour from the middle levels of the Mutual Building in Darling Street in Cape Town, once uninterrupted, is now obscured by the General Post Office constructed shortly afterwards (seen here at the extreme left).

Haros' conversion table  One of the primary tasks of the Bureau du Cadastre was the accurate mapping of France for the purpose of taxation but from time to time the bureau also provided computational services to other parts of the government. One of the changes instituted by the French revolution was to convert France to the metric system and this necessitated changing from a fractional to a decimal representation of rational numbers. While Haros was involved many computation projects at the Bureau du Cadastre including the computation of de Prony‚Äôs tables of logarithms and the preparation of the French ephemeris, Connaissance des Temps, he is best known for a small table he prepared to convert fractions to their decimal equivalents. Haros‚Äô conversion table appeared in a tract, Instruction Abr√©g√©e sur les nouvelles Mesures qui dovient √©tre introduites dans toute r√©publique, au vend√©miaire an 10; avec tables de rapports et reductions, that was presented to the Mathematics Section of the Institut de France and subsequently abstracted in Journal de l'√âcole Polytechnique under the title \\"Tables pour √©valuer une fraction ordinaire avec autant de decimals qu‚Äôon voudra; et pour trouver la fraction ordinaire la plus simple, et qui approche sensiblement d‚Äôune fraction d√©cimale.\\" In preparing his table Haros needed to create the list of all 3,003 irreducible (vulgar) fractions with denominators less than 100. In order to make sure he got them all he harnessed an algorithm elucidated by Nicolas Chuquet some one-hundred and fifty years earlier. Chuquet called it his \\"r√®gle des nombres moyens\\". Today we call it the mediant. The mediant is the fraction between two fractions a/c and b/d whose numerator is the sum of the numerators, a+b, and whose denominator is the sum of the denominators, c+d. That is, the mediant of the fractions a/c and b/d is the fraction (a+b)/(c+d). In his paper Haros demonstrated that the mediant is always irreducible and, more importantly for this purposes, if one starts with the sequence of fractions :1/99, 1/98, 1/97, ..., 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 5/6, ..., 96/97, 97/98, 98/99 and just keeps applying the rule, only keeping the result if the denominator is less than one-hundred, then they generate all 3,003.  A curious property  Roughly fifteen years later in England, Henry Goodwyn set out to create a much more ambitious version of Haros‚Äô table. In particular, Goodwyn wanted to tabulate the decimal values for all irreducible fractions with denominators less than or equal to 1,024. There are 318,963 such fractions. As a warm up and a test of the commercial market for such a table in 1816 he published for private circulation The First Centenary of a Series of Concise and Useful Tables of all the Complete Decimal Quotients, which can arise from dividing a unit, or any whole Number less than each Divisor by all Integers from 1 to 1024. John Farey observed the mediant property in this table and mused in a letter to The Philosophical Magazine and Journal as follows: :\\"I am not acquainted, whether this curious property of vulgar fractions has been before pointed out?; or whether it may admit of any easy or general demonstration ?; which are points on which I should be glad to learn the sentiments of some of your mathematical readers; ...\\"  (Mis)naming of the Farey sequence  Augustin Cauchy read Farey‚Äôs letter and published a paper \\"D√©monstration d‚Äôun Th√©or√®me Curieux sur les Nombres\\" reproving Haros‚Äô results without acknowledgement. In his paper Cauchy referred to the mediant as \\"a remarkable property of ordinary fractions observed by M. J. Farey.\\" Thus, an ordered sequence of all vulgar fractions with denominators less than a given value became known as a Farey sequence rather than perhaps more rightfully as either a Chuquet sequence or a Haros sequence.

Adults are yellow-black, with orange brown forewings with somewhat darker veins. The hindwings are transparent with a conspicuous deep yellow discal mark and fringed with dark brown scales. Adults emerge mostly from March to August, depending on location. In central California, most emerge by mid June, in eastern Washington as late as mid September and in the extreme southern range in California, specimens have been taken from February to May and again in November. The larvae feed on poplar, willow and birch. Poplars are generally favoured, although willows seem preferred in some areas of California and Oregon. Black cottonwood, balsam poplar, and white poplar, as well as several hybrids poplars, are also recorded as hosts. Newly hatched larvae crawl over the bark for a few hours before selecting suitable sites to begin feeding. The larvae initially excavate cavities in the phloem and cambium and later galleries into the wood. The larvae feed during two successive summer and fall seasons. The first winter in the galleries, which are loosely packed with frass and the second winter in pupal chambers near the distal ends of the galleries. These distal ends are capped with silk, but no cocoons are formed. Pupation lasts two to three weeks. A generation requires two years over most of its range but may be of shorter duration in its southern range.

Accessed September 20, 2011. After leaving DuPont, Baldino co-founded Cephalon in 1987 at the age of 33. Its best known product has been modafinil, which the firm markets under the brand name Provigil, which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in treating narcolepsy, shift work sleep disorder, and excessive daytime sleepiness resulting from sleep apnea, though the FDA has held off on approving its use for treating jet lag. In marketing Provigil, Baldino emphasized that \\"there are no warts on this drug\\" and the product became a best seller for its off-label use by individuals seeking to maintain alertness and combat fatigue without the side effects of caffeine and amphetamines, with off-label uses accounting for 90% of sales by 2004.

Cephalon settled a lawsuit for $17 million in which it faced claims that Baldino and other company executives had overstated the potential for a drug aimed at treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (known informally as Lou Gehrig's disease). The Federal Trade Commission claimed that Cephalon had made improper deals to postpone the availability of generic versions of modafinil and the firm paid over $400 million in 2007 in response to allegations that the firm had improperly marketed its pharmaceutical products. A resident of West Chester, Pennsylvania, Baldino had been on leave from his duties at Cephalon starting in August 2010 as he sought medical treatment and his responsibilities were overseen by Chief Operating Officer J.

Construction and early civilian career Wissahickon was laid down in 1899 by George Lawley & Son at Neponset, Massachusetts, as the private single-screw steam yacht Valda, with a composite hull made of an iron frame with wood planking. Valda was completed in 1900 and renamed Wissahickon in late 1901 or early 1902. She was the property of Mrs. Charles W. Henry of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, when the United States entered World War I on 6 April 1917 and may have served in the Maine Naval Militia prior to her acquisition by the U.S. Navy. Acquisition and commissioning In 1917, the U.S. Navy acquired Wissahickon from Mrs. Henry for use as a section patrol vessel during World War I. Records concerning Wissahickons acquisition and commissioning are vague, somewhat contradictory, and incomplete. It appears that U.S. Navy personnel reported aboard Wissahickon as early as April 1917, although one record source states that the Navy did not acquire her from Mrs. Henry until 13 July 1917. No primary source states her commissioning date; her ship's log starts on 20 August 1917 - stating that she was under the command of Lieutenant, junior grade, E. W. Haskell, USNRF on that date - but one secondary sourceThe 1918 edition of Ship's Data, cited in the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships. states that she was not commissioned until 3 October 1917.See the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships for a discussion of these dates and sources for Wissahickons acquisition and commissioning. At any rate, Wissahickon was commissioned sometime between April and early October 1917. Sources differ as to whether she was commissioned without her name as USS SP-852Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships. or as USS Wissahickon (SP-852), with her name being changed in 1918 to USS SP-852.SP-852 Wissahickon at Department of the Navy Naval History and Heritage Command Online Library of Selected Images: U.S. Navy Ships -- Listed by Hull Number: \\"SP\\" #s and \\"ID\\" #s -- World War I Era Patrol Vessels and other Acquired Ships and Craft numbered from SP-800 through SP-899.

Initially based at Rockland, Maine, she began patrols in the vicinity of that port. She spent most of the winter of 1917-1918 moored to a pier there; in January 1918, all of her officers and enlisted men became ill with common colds and sore throats, and the ship was quarantined until the diseases ran their course. When her crew had returned to good health, she returned to patrol duty off Rockland. In mid-summer 1918, she was reassigned to duty at Boston, Massachusetts, where she arrived on 20 August 1918. She operated from the section base at East Boston, Massachusetts, for the rest of World War I and into January 1919. Apparently sometime between September and November 1918, and definitely by 1 January 1919,See the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships for a discussion of the vagueness of sources on the exact date of the name change. her name was changed from USS SP-852 to USS Wissahickon (SP-852).

Early life and education Beaglehole was born to David Ernest Beaglehole and his wife Jane Butler in Wellington as the youngest of four children. He attended Mount Cook until he left for Wellington College. He continued to Victoria University College, where his abilities first began to receive some notice. There he completed his master's degree in 1928. He studied in London for his PhD work on acquisitiveness and the psychological basis of property. While in London, Beaglehole met Pearl Malsin, an American student from Wisconsin. After completing his PhD, he received the Commonwealth Fund Fellowship. This supported his traveling to Yale University in Connecticut to conduct post- doctoral research. Pearl later joined him in New Haven, and they were married on 24 May 1933. At Yale, Beaglehole met Peter Buck, a professor who \\"arranged for the Beagleholes to go to Pukapuka, a remote northern Cook Islands atoll, as part of his comprehensive Pacific island ethnographic survey\\". Research and achievements From his studies of Pacific Island cultures, Beaglehole wrote many books. Following his research in Pukapuka, he published Ethnology of Pukapuka (1938). He and his wife continued this research, and a year later he published Some Modern Hawaiians (1939). Beaglehole returned to Victoria University College as a senior lecturer, where his brother John Cawte Beaglehole was a noted researcher in his own right. Ernest Beaglehole was awarded a Doctorate in Letters in 1940, and in 1948 he was appointed chair of psychology and philosophy. His next book was Some Modern Maoris. He completed his scholarship in the field with his work Social Change in the South Pacific (1957). Throughout his works he placed a great deal of emphasis on the facts of native cultures and the fading of these cultures over time. During the 1950s, Beaglehole was frequently consulted for his expertise. Most notably, he was one of the primary authors of UNESCO's The Race Question, an international statement by sociologists about the unscientific and immoral nature of racism and race theories. He was later called upon by the ILO in various capacities, initially as a field adviser and leader, and later as chairman of the ILO Committee of Experts on Indigenous Labor. Personal life Beaglehole died at the age of 59 in Wellington, New Zealand, on 23 October 1965. He was survived by his wife Pearl and their four children. Two followed their parents into academia: their daughter Jane Beaglehole Ritchie became a full professor at the University of Waikato as an expert in child-raising.

Category, class and supergroup name endings are used as layout tools in the list as well. ;Abbreviations: * \\"*\\" ‚Äì Mineral not IMA-approved. * \\"?\\" ‚Äì IMA discredited mineral name. * \\"REE\\" ‚Äì Rare-earth element (Sc, Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu) * \\"PGE\\" ‚Äì Platinum-group element (Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Pt) = Category 01 = * Elements: Metals and Alloys, Carbides, Silicides, Nitrides, Phosphides ** :Diamond ** :Gold  Class: Native elements  * :Carbide minerals ** Osbornite group carbides and nitrides *** Osbornite TiN, Khamrabaevite (Ti,V,Fe)C, Niobocarbide (Nb,Ta)C, Tantalcarbide TaC * :Phosphide minerals ** Barringerite group phosphides *** Barringerite (Fe,Ni)2P, Schreibersite (Fe,Ni)3P, Nickelphosphide (Ni,Fe)3P, Allabogdanite (Fe,Ni)2P, Melliniite (Ni,Fe)4P, Monipite MoNiP * Copper group/ Gold group ** Gold Au, Silver Ag, Copper Cu, Lead Pb, Aluminium Al, Maldonite Au2Bi * Silver Amalgam Alloys ** Amalgam* Ag2Hg3, Moschellandsbergite Ag2Hg3, Schachnerite Ag1.1Hg0.9, Paraschachnerite Ag3Hg2, Luanheite Ag3Hg, Eugenite Ag9Hg2, Weishanite (Au,Ag)3Hg2 * Iron-Nickel group ** Iron Fe, Kamacite? alpha-(Fe,Ni), Taenite gamma-(Fe,Ni), Tetrataenite FeNi, Awaruite Ni2Fe to Ni3Fe, Nickel Ni, Wairauite CoFe * Suessite group silicides ** Suessite (Fe,Ni)3Si, Gupeiite Fe3Si, Xifengite Fe5Si3, Hapkeite Fe2Si, Luobusaite Fe0.83Si2, Mavlyanovite Mn5Si3, Brownleeite MnSi * Platinum group (Space group Fm3m) ** Platinum Pt, Iridium (Ir,Os,Ru,Pt), Rhodium (Rh,Pt), Palladium Pd,Pt * Osmium group (Space group P63/mmc) ** Osmium (Os,Ir), Ruthenium (Ru,Ir,Os), Rutheniridosmine (Ir,Os,Ru), Hexaferrum (Fe,Os,Ru,Ir), Hexamolybdenum (Mo,Ru,Fe,Ir,Os), IMA2008-055 (Ni,Fe,Ir) * Tetraferroplatinum group (Space group P4/mmm) ** Tetraferroplatinum PtFe, Tulameenite Pt2FeCu, Ferronickelplatinum Pt2FeNi, Potarite PdHg * Isoferroplatinum group (Space group Pm3m) ** Isoferroplatinum (Pt,Pd)3(Fe,Cu), Rustenburgite (Pt,Pd)3Sn, Atokite (Pd,Pt)3Sn, Zvyagintsevite Pd3Pb, Chengdeite Ir3Fe, Yixunite Pt3In * Arsenic group ** Arsenic As, Antimony Sb, Stibarsen SbAs, Bismuth Bi, Stistaite SnSb * Carbon polymorph group (IMA-CNMNC discourages a grouping of diamond and graphite, Mills et al.

In 2008 she falsely claimed to a Scottish court that puppies she was selling were Kennel Club-registered, but the court found her guilty and issued her with a ¬£2,000 fine. She had previously been found guilty of animal cruelty and banned from keeping dogs, and the local council had banned her from selling puppies or dogs which were not fit, healthy and conforming to breed. East Ayrshire Council had had concerns about Mrs Baird‚Äôs trading activities since August 2005. The court heard that over the previous three and a half years, 49 complaints had been made about Baird - with just eight about all other breeders. Her husband, Thomas Baird, is a pastor at Assemblies of God Pentecostal Church at Johnstone, Renfrewshire, who in 2013 along with Elizabeth, was charged with illegally advertising Bichon Frise, Jack Russell, Malteschion and other puppies for sale and selling them at Ayr bus station, Sainsburys car park in Strathaven, and at their own cottage, as well as other locations, and A warrant was issued for his arrest in 2013 after Sheriff John Montgomery agreed to a motion from Jim Kelman, the prosecutor.

When started on December 25, 1946, it became the first nuclear reactor in Europe to achieve a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. It was still in operation in the beginning of the 2010s, with a power level of 24 kW, making it, at that time, the world's oldest operating reactor. The fuel in F-1 is metallic uranium with the natural content of the 235 U isotope (0.72%), graphite as a moderator, cadmium rods to control the neutron flux. Structurally, it is a spherical structure with a diameter of about 6 meters, made of loose graphite bricks. The graphite stack has holes in which fuel and control rods are placed, as well as research and control equipment. The weight of graphite is 400 tons, uranium is 50 tons. Thermal power of the reactor is from 100 W to 1 MW. Air cooling, if necessary, forced air cooling was provided by fans. Long-term operation at high power was not possible, but the large mass of the core allowed a short-term increase in power to peak values. In November 2016 it was in permanent shutdown state.

In 1992, Ram Awatar Agnihotri wrote that it was in the films Alag Alag and Adhikar, both opposite Rajesh Khanna that Tina Munim showed the \\"first sparks\\" of the dedicated actress she would become. Tina regards her performance in this film as her best performance in her career. This was the last film which featured Rajesh Khanna and Tina Munim onscreen together, thus ending their popular pairing.  Plot  Vishal (Rajesh Khanna) is a former champion jockey. Due to failing health, his doctor has advised him to give up racing, which he does. He lives in a small house with his young son, Lucky. Both of them lead a humble lifestyle, yet they love each other dearly. Lucky grows up to believe that his mother has died, and when he asks Vishal about his mother, it is revealed that Vishal fell in love with a wealthy girl called Jyoti (Tina Munim) during his days as a champion jockey. Jyoti and Vishal marry and live together. Jyoti is an excellent singer and some music directors offer her the chance to sing in their films. However, Vishal is adamant that Jyoti will remain a housewife, and look after their son. When Jyoti sneaks off to the recording studio when Lucky is ill, Vishal furiously drags her home and hits her. He firmly tells her that she shall have to choose between singing and being a wife. This causes Jyoti to leave her house and move in with her selfish mother (Bindu). Although she takes Lucky with her, Vishal kidnaps him and it's also revealed that Jyoti and her family informed the police, causing Vishal to move far away with Lucky to a smaller house. Jyoti, now a very successful singer, re-enters Lucky's life as his 'aunty'. Vishal works as a servant in a wealthy man's house. His boss's spoilt sister, Rita (Zarina Wahab) takes an interest in Vishal and is determined to marry him. When Rita visits Vishal's house, Lucky does not like her and he misbehaves with her, causing Rita to run away. When his boss demands that Lucky beg Rita for forgiveness, Vishal quits his job. Lucky, unaware that Jyoti is his mother, plans to introduce her to Vishal. This leads to Jyoti realising that Lucky is her son, but Vishal firmly tells her to stay away. Jyoti takes Vishal to court for a custody hearing. In order to pay for a good lawyer (Danny Denzongpa), Vishal is forced to sell Lucky's horse, Hira to his former boss. However, Vishal meets with an accident and misses the first day in court. The court orders that Jyoti be permitted to meet Lucky once a week. When Vishal finds Lucky at Jyoti's house, he takes him away, telling him that Jyoti plans to separate them, leading Lucky to sever ties with Jyoti, shattering her. During the custody hearing, Vishal's lawyer tears Jyoti apart on the stand. Unable to tolerate his wife's insult, Vishal emotionally agrees to hand Lucky over to Jyoti. This makes Jyoti fall in love with Vishal again and she quits singing, and decides to return to Vishal. One day, Lucky sees Vishal's boss abuse Hira, and as he begs him to stop, Vishal arrives and beats his boss up, which leads to his arrest. Lucky is sent to live with Jyoti, who reveals to him that she is his mother, but he doesn't believe her. When Vishal is released from jail, Lucky asks him to participate in a horse race, atop Hira, whom Jyoti has brought back. Vishal reluctantly agrees and wins the race. However, this makes Vishal unconscious. In his last moments, Vishal tells Lucky that their journey together was only meant to last until this point. Vishal loses consciousness again. However, Lucky's prayers bring him back. Vishal confirms that Jyoti, who is also there, is indeed Lucky's mother. Vishal shares an emotional embrace with Lucky and Jyoti. The film ends with Jyoti, Vishal and Lucky leading a happy family life together.

A Daughters of the Utah Pioneers monument (no. 172), located in City Park in Fountain Green, UT, memorializes the Fountain Green Massacre. Event In the early morning hours of October 1, 1853, Utes of Sanpitch attacked and killed four men‚ÄîWilliam Reed, James Nelson, William Luke, and Thomas Clark‚Äîwho were encamped at Uinta Springs, near the head of Salt Creek Canyon. The men were driving two ox-drawn wagons filled with wheat to Salt Lake City, as the advance party of a larger group headed by local Manti, UT Mormon leader Isaac Morley. William Luke, an immigrant from Manchester, England, was anxious to go see his three sons, who had recently arrived from England, and may have encouraged the group to hasten its journey. The four men camped at Uinta Springs against Morley's instructions, which had been for the group to make camp on the San Pitch River and await the arrival of the main group. When Morley's group arrived at the camp, they found William Reed stripped, scalped, and disemboweled a short distance from the wagons. Luke and Nelson's throats were cut; they were also disemboweled. The Morley party emptied the wagons of their grain and then loaded three of the bodies for transport to Nephi, Utah (Clark's body later being found by a relative) and as the party readied to move on, numerous Utes appeared on the hillside. Oral tradition holds that Morley, angry over disobedience to his orders, denied the dead men burial in the town cemetery. Their gravesites are unknown, despite efforts to locate the remains of the four men. Revenge Soon after the massacre, eight Utes were murdered in Nephi, in an act of revenge. According to a prominent local woman: In 2006 the remains of the slain Utes were discovered in an area of Nephi called Old Hallow. Subsequent violence A little less than five years later, four Danish immigrants‚ÄîJens Jorgensen, his wife Hedevig Jorgensen Jens Terklesen, and Christian I. Kjerulf‚Äîwere slain by natives in Salt Creek Canyon, while they were en route to settle with other Scandinavian immigrants in the Sanpete Valley. This tragedy, known as the Salt Creek Canyon Massacre, was marked by the brutality with which Jorgensen's wife and unborn child were butchered with a tomahawk.

Originally released in French as Le monde selon Monsanto, the film is based on Robin's three-year-long investigation into the corporate practices around the world of the United States multinational corporation, Monsanto. The World According to Monsanto is also the title of a book written by Robin.  Synopsis  The film reports many controversies surrounding the use and promotion of genetically modified seeds, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), Agent Orange, and bovine growth hormone. Cases in the United States (including Anniston, Alabama), Canada, India, Mexico, Paraguay, the United Kingdom (Scotland) and France, are explored, claiming that the Monsanto corporation's collusion with governments, pressure tactics, suppression and manipulation of scientific data, and extra-legal practices aided the company's attempts at dominating global agriculture. Scientists, representatives of the United States Food and Drug Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, civil society representatives, victims of the company's activities, lawyers, and politicians are interviewed.The World According to Monsanto National Film Board of Canada In March 2008, French journalist Marie- Monique Robin released the results of her three years of worldwide research into Monsanto. A book was published by La D√©couverte, a French editor, and a video documentary, Le Monde selon Monsanto (The World According to Monsanto), was released on DVD and shown on Arte, the Franco-German culture TV channel.Le monde selon Monsanto from Arte TVThe World according to Monsanto from Google Video Robin travels to India, Mexico, Argentina, and Paraguay to see how Monsanto's genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have affected local farmers using it for their crops. The film claims that GMO use has increased suicide rates of farmers in India. Participants The original version of ‚ÄúThe World According to Monsanto‚Äù was not only focused on GMOs but Monsanto‚Äôs bad behavior in general. Much of this material was contributed to and used by Marie-Monique Robin to by retired U.S. Environmental Protection Agency policy analyst William Sanjour. Sanjour, while working for EPA, had written a 21 page report titled ‚ÄúThe Monsanto Investigation.‚Äù The report and it‚Äôs 62 end notes and other supporting material was loaned to Robin for her documentary. The report was ‚Äúan analysis of the failure of EPA to investigate allegations that the Monsanto Company had falsified scientific studies on the carcinogenicity of dioxin.‚Äù Film participants include David Baker, Ken Cook, Professor David Carpenter, Dan Glickman, James Maryanski, Jeffrey Smith, Michael Hansen, Jeremy Rifkin, Michael Taylor, Dr. Samuel Epstein, Shiv Chopra, Prof. Arpad Pusztai, Peter Melchett, Vandana Shiva, Prof. Ignacio Chapela, Prof. Stanley Ewen, Segundino, Elena Alvares Buyll, Aldo Gonz√°lez Morales, Jonathan Matthews, Roberto Franco, Prof. Robert Bell√©, Richard Burroughs, Pete Hardin, Ray Mowling, Lisa Watson, Margaret Haydon, Steven Druker, William Sanjour, Gerson Smoger, Prof. Ian Pryme, Troy Roush, David Runyon, Kiran Sakhari, Abdul Gayum, Kishor Tiwari, Tarak Kate, and Jorge Galeano. Reception The book has been reviewed by Les Inrockuptibles, L'Express, AFP, Bakchich, L'Humanit√©, T√©l√©rama, Le Point, Politis, La Marseillaise among others. A review compares the book's impact to Rachel Carson's Silent Spring in raising awareness of the issues of Monsanto.Eric Duchemin, ¬´ Marie-Monique Robin, Le monde selon Monsanto ¬ª, VertigO - la revue √©lectronique en sciences de l'environnement [En ligne], Lectures, mis en ligne le 07 juillet 2008, consult√© le 16 ao√ªt 2015. URL : http://vertigo.revues.org/5315 La Recherche criticised the lack of a thorough examination of biotechnology in the book, but praised it as captivating and saying that it had a thriller style. The Toronto Star described the film as taking a \\"scattershot approach\\", criticised its use of boring footage showing the creator Googling for information, and notes that even though the documentary is available in English and available to the American public, Monsanto will probably not be constrained by them. The Globe and Mail described the film as \\"a well researched but stylistically flawed film\\", and criticised the use of footage showing Robin Googling. Le Monde described the film as an edifying documentary, and praised the diversity in testimonies presented in the film. A later review feels that the film was one- sided until the phone conversation where Monsanto declined to appear was shown. The film was projected in the National Assembly before a debate on GMOs by the initiative of the Greens party and was described by Le Figaro as \\"a long and meticulous indictment against GMOs\\" (\\"s'agit d'un long et minutieux r√©quisitoire contre les OGM\\"). Rue89 described the film as \\"paced like a thriller on public health\\", and compared it to the film Erin Brockovich but without the satisfying conclusion of that film. La Presse describes the film as being not in the vein of Michael Moore's documentaries, but instead relying on the facts to make its point. In its showing on March 11, 2008, it had 1 569 000 viewers.La R√©v√©lation Monsanto, L'Humanit√©, 2008-08-19 Biologist Marcel Kuntz denounced the film in an article published on the website of the French Association for Scientific Information (AFIS), describing the film as \\"replete with pseudoscientific claims\\" (\\"truff√© d'all√©gations pseudo-scientifiques\\"). A review in Lib√©ration states that the film amalgamates the issues of GMO and Monsanto, and, citing the review by Marcel Kuntz, states that the film lacks scientific rigor.

It is part of the Grand Saline Independent School District located in northeast Van Zandt County. In 2015, the school was rated \\"Met Standard\\" by the Texas Education Agency. History Grand Saline's first high school was built in 1925 approximately 2 miles from its present location. It was originally part of an original school building that housed over 300 total students. In the 1940s Grand Saline ISD had fully consolidated with the rural communities and built a school to house grades 1‚Äì6 and ease the crowded school. Shortly thereafter, Person's Stadium, the district's first football stadium, was built. In 1963 Grand Saline's Board of Education and the citizens approved the construction of a new high school, a new gymnasium and renovations to Person's Stadium. The new high school was finished in 1964 along with Stadium Drive, which was built for access to the new high school and Person's Stadium. Renovations would not come again until 1992, when GSISD voters approved a bond issue that built a cafetorium, a new parking lot, and additional classroom buildings to ease crowding. The bond issue also added a student commons area which would connect the gymnasium and the classroom wings and create one building. Additionally, voters approved the construction of Indian Memorial Stadium, a new football stadium with an olympic quality track and field set-up and a seating capacity of 4,500 fans, replacing the aging Person's Stadium, which became a practice field. In late 1999, due to a steady growth in the district, school district officials sought out community and district opinion regarding building a new high school building on open pasture land next to the current high school at the time. In the Spring of 2000, voters approved the bond issue to build a new high school at the price of 7 million dollars. Construction began in Summer of 2002 and was opened for classes in Fall of 2004, with the capacity to house 550 students. The old high school became the district's middle school and a new baseball facility was constructed behind the new school and was finished a full year before the new school was. In addition to much bigger classrooms, the new school houses a gymnasium with 3 basketball courts and seating for 1,200 fans, the capacity to host basketball play-off games, a new fine arts auditorium and a library. Academics GSHS has an agreement with nearby Tyler Junior College for college bound Juniors and Seniors to earn both high school and college credit while taking classes. Also, students who plan to major in Nursing or Pharmacy/Pharmacy Tech. programs also have pre-college classes available to them. GSHS has had higher than above average SAT and ACT scores and above average rate of college bound graduating Seniors. Fine Arts GSHS offers students programs in Drama, Marching Band, Choir, Art and Painting Classes. Grand Saline's Drama program has a strong program in East Texas competing in numerous One Act play performances. The Indian Marching Band has achieved both Regional and State Wide honors earning UIL \\"Sweepstakes\\" awards for its Marching Band performances. Other activities GSHS also offers various other clubs for all of its students including a State-ranked Speech and Debate Team, Jazz Band, National Honor Society, Future Farmers of America, IMPACT, A Christian Student Club, as well as Fellowship of Christian Athletes for Christian Student Athletes, Yearbook Club, and the school newspaper, The Tomahawk Express. Athletics The Grand Saline Indians compete in the following sports -The Athletics Department Cross Country, Volleyball, Football, Basketball, Powerlifting, Golf, Tennis, Track, Softball & Baseball Grand Saline Indian Football Grand Saline Football has a rich tradition in East Texas. The Indians have been competing since 1923, and have won numerous district, Bi-District and Area titles. The best teams in school history were the 1982 team, which allowed opponents only 4 points per game while averaging 37 a game, the 1990 team which lost to state power and eventual champion Groveton after posting a 12‚Äì1 record and finishing ranked 4th in the state, and the 1999 team, which lost to state power and eventual champion Celina after posting a 12‚Äì1 record. The most successful eras for Indian football were the 1940s, 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. From 1982‚Äì2003, the Indian Football program amassed a Win-Loss-Tie record of 180-75-2 (.700 winning percentage), with 18 Texas State Playoff appearances, 10 district championships, and 9 seasons of 10 wins or more. Carter Elliott is the most successful coach in the history of the program, leading the Indians to 5 regional finals berths. He was the head coach from 1978 to 1991 and from 1997 to 2000. The Indians started to downturn in 2004 by going 3‚Äì7 that season and missing the playoffs. From 2004‚Äì2014, Grand Saline had 4 head coaches and went 25‚Äì86. In 2013, GSHS alumnus and former All-State Indian Football player Mike Ridge was named athletic director and head football coach. Ridge had back to back winless seasons due to injuries, lower participation, and being the smallest school in their district.

Rivals are: Van High School Vandals - Highway 110 Rivalry. Grand Saline and Van have the third longest streak in Texas High School Football history of playing each other every year, currently at 85 straight games. The Football rivalry went defunct in 2012 due to mutual desires to play schools of similar sizes, however both still enjoy the rivalry in Basketball, Baseball, Softball, and Tennis. Quitman High School (Texas) Bulldogs - Rivalry developed in the 1980s mainly around football, rivalry heated back up in 2002 when QHS dropped from UIL conference AAA and back to AA and has been in GSHS's conference ever since. This is currently the most heated rivalry. Edgewood High School Bulldogs - Highway 80 rivalry. Traditionally dominated in Football by Grand Saline and in Basketball by Edgewood, the rivalry continues to thrive as the two schools compete well against each other in all sports and in academic UIL. Mineola High School (Texas) Yellowjackets - Sabine River Rivalry. Mineola is located just across the Sabine River down US Highway 80 from Grand Saline. The two schools also have a 50-year-old rivalry in football. Notable alumni *Chris Tomlin - Grammy Award Winning Christian Music Artist and Songwriter.

Background The film's subjects had been long-time friends and business associates with Rezolution Pictures co-founders Catherine Bainbridge and Ernest Webb, who thought that their personal story would help to illustrate the growing phenomenon of same-sex couple adoption in Quebec, the first Canadian province to legalize the practice. The film represented a creative departure for Rezolution, which had previously focused on Canadian Aboriginal film and television productions. Story The couple's efforts began in 2001, with one of them hoping to conceive from a sperm donor. After a year of trying unsuccessfully to become pregnant, they sought help from the fertility clinic at the Royal Victoria Hospital, only to find that treatment was refused to lesbians. After a complaint was filed with the Quebec Human Rights Commission by another couple, the hospital changed its policy. However, despite access to fertility drugs and continued efforts at artificial insemination, they were unable to conceive and their doctor suggested they adopt. They put themselves on a local list for adoption, where the wait could be as long as 10 years, and also explored international adoption, only to be told that no country in the world accepted same sex couples as parents. Then they heard about a lesbian couple in Ontario who had successfully adopted two children from the United States. However, Quebec's provincial body that controls international adoption had only approved one U.S. adoption agency: a Tennessee-based Christian agency that refused to place babies with anything other than married heterosexual couples. In spring 2006, Bainbridge and Webb noticed an advertisement in the Cree newsweekly The Nation, which they also co-own, from Batshaw Youth and Family Centres, an agency for abused and neglected children. The agency was looking for someone to adopt a Canadian Aboriginal child. The couple learn that there is a 7-month-old boy who also has a sister on the way, both in need of a home. At the end of the film, after a long and Byzantine process, the couple have two children of their own. Release Mommy Mommy was screened at Reel Pride in Winnipeg and Image + Nation in Montreal, and had its television premiere on CBC Newsworld on December 4, 2007. It was then screened at the Women in Film Festival in Vancouver in March 2008 and rebroadcast on CBC for Mother's Day.

Some sources use the title to refer to Fort James Jackson (also known as Fort Oglethorpe) or Fort Wayne (Georgia), both near Savannah. A hotel constructed in the 1880s now sits on the site of the old barracks. Origin In 1823, City of Savannah, Georgia petitioned Secretary of War John C. Calhoun to build a military barracks within the city and agreed to purchase the necessary land. The War Department agreed to the endeavor and furnished the materials to build the barracks. Troops arrived in the mid to late 1820s to construct the facility. The barracks took the name of James Oglethorpe, founder of Georgia colony and of the settlement of Savannah. Antebellum period The post surgeon took meteorological observations probably as early as 1827. Construction of Oglethorpe Barracks finished circa 1834. The weather station began using a rain gauge in 1836. Meteorological observations continued through December 1850; American soldiers probably left the post at the end of the year. In 1852, City of Savannah proposed to purchase the site from the War Department, and the War Department sold the parcel to the City in 1853. Civil War Local Confederate volunteer companies occupied Oglethorpe Barracks throughout American Civil War until Union General William Tecumseh Sherman captured the city in 1864. Reconstruction era United States Army troops continued to occupy Fort Oglethorpe after the end of the Civil War. Meteorological observations resumed in or before September 1866. In 1875, a brick wall high enclosed the barracks and connected the buildings that abutted city streets. The buildings on the post surrounded a courtyard that functioned as its parade ground. Army surgeons took weather observations at the barracks hospital, a frame building abutting Harris Street with an -tall brick foundation long and wide. The frame hospital building measured above its foundation and extended beyond its foundation on each end, where square brick pillars supported the building. A two-story frame guard house building lay east of the hospital along Harris Street and measured long, wide, and high. A two-story brick building abutted Harris Street west of the hospital. During the long summer of 1876, the troops transferred to Camp Oglethorpe near Oliver, Georgia. Decommissioning The Army left Oglethorpe Barracks after March 1879, when meteorological observations ceased. The Signal Service office in Savannah continued the record of meteorological observations for the city at another location. The War Department later in 1879 sold the parcel to Savannah Hotel Corporation for $75,000. Congress in 1883 directed Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln to sell Oglethorpe Barracks. The new owner then tore down the barracks. Construction of Desoto Hotel on the site of the former barracks began in 1888 and completed in 1890. The hotel featured five stories, 206 rooms, a solarium, a barber shop, a drug store, and a restaurant; a swimming pool (outdoor) was added later. A fountain featuring the head of a lion with water flowing out its mouth was a feature of the hotel, which remain today. For a number of years, a local radio station WCCP, later WBYG, had studios in the hotel. Hilton now operates the hotel. The Army closed Fort James Jackson in 1902. The parcel on which Oglethorpe Barracks once stood now lies just northeast of Madison Square in historic old Savannah.

Taxonomy The genus was circumscribed in 1985 to contain the species originally described as Agaricus lignatilis by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1801. This was considered the sole species in the genus until 2007, when Marco Contu validly published a description of O. lachnopus from collections in Italy. Recent analysis (2013) confirms that O. lachnopus and O. lignatilis should be considered distinct species. Molecular genetics analysis suggests that Ossicaulis is most closely related to the genera Asterophora, Hypsizygus, Lyophyllum, and Tricholomella. Description Ossicaulis species have gills that are adnexed, adnate or somewhat decurrent and a stipe that is centrally or laterally attached to the cap. The hyphal system is monomitic (meaning only generative hyphae are present), the trama is regular, and there are clamp connections in the hyphae. Spores are small and ellipsoidal in shape. The cap cuticle features coral-shaped (coralloid) hyphae, and there are additionally coralloid to narrowly club-shaped cheilocystidia in the hymenium. The two species are similar in most macroscopic characteristics, but they can be reliably differentiated by differences in spore width: O. lachnopus is 2.8‚Äì4.0 by 2.0‚Äì2.4 ¬µm, while the dimensions of O. lignatilis spores are 4.0‚Äì5.6 by 2.4‚Äì3.2 ¬µm. Habitat and distribution Both species are widespread throughout Europe; O. lignatilis is also found in North America. O. lachnopus tends to grow in natural forested habitats, while O. lignatilis prefers habitats that are man-made or have been influenced by man, like towns, villages, parks, and avenues. Both species grow on dead and decaying wood of deciduous (rarely coniferous) trees.

Distribution This species occurs in Europe, North Africa and Asia.[orthoptera.speciesfile.org/Common/basic/Taxa.aspx?TaxonNameID=1103489 Orthoptera Species File (Version 5.0/5.0)] It was recently rediscovered in the Maltese islands.Sciberras A (2010) Notes on two Orthoptera (Acridoidea) species of the Maltese Islands. Central Mediterranean Naturalist 5(2):73-76. Nature Trust Malta publications. Morphological description Oedipoda caerulescens is a medium-sized grasshopper, between 15 and 21 mm for males and between 22 and 28 mm for females. The body coloration varies greatly depending on the substrate on which the animals have developed: reddish brown, gray, yellowish, or even completely dark or bright. The forewings are crossed most often by two or three pale bands, but the most striking characteristic, very visible when the insect flies away, is the bright coloration of the hind wings, a beautiful turquoise highlighted with a black marginal stripe. Furthermore, the posterior femora have a notch on their upper surface. At rest, confusion is possible with other Oedipoda species such as O. germanica. Ecology Oedipoda caerulescens frequents dry areas with low and open vegetation: dunes, heathlands, grasslands on sand and sunlit limestone rocks. Many stations correspond to land recently used for human activities, such as coal spoil heaps, quarries and pits, the ballast of railway tracks, etc. It is exclusively a terrestrial insect, and its cryptic coloration often matches its substrate. It presses itself to the ground and remains motionless, and jumps only at the very close approach of danger. A remarkable behavior is the \\"hook\\" landing which serves to confuse potential attackers. Thus, the grasshopper lands and swings round to face the direction it has come from. The sudden disappearance of the blue hind wings of the adult makes it difficult for predators to shift quickly enough to a different kind of search to relocate the prey.Kral, K. (2010) Escape behaviour in blue-winged grasshoppers, Oedipoda caerulescens. Physiological Entomology 35:240-248. The female lays her eggs in bare, dry soil. In this species, acoustic emissions are virtually nonexistent. The diet consists mainly of grasses.

Reception  The History of Soviet Russia volumes met with a mixed reception. In 1970, the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica described the History of Soviet Russia series as simply \\"magisterial\\".Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Book of the Year 1970, Chicago; University of Chicago Press, 1970 p. 476 British historian Chimen Abramsky praised Carr as the world's foremost historian of the Soviet Union who displayed an astonishing knowledge of the subject.Abramsky, Chimen \\"Tribute to E.H. Carr\\" pp. vii‚Äìviii from Essays in Honour of E.H. Carr ed. C. Abramsky and Beryl Williams, London: Macmillan Press, 1974 The Canadian historian John Keep called the series \\"[a] towering scholarly monument; in its shadow the rest of us are but pygmies\\".Laqueur, pp. 234‚Äì235 Deutscher called A History of Soviet Russia \\"a truly outstanding achievement\\".Deutscher, Isaac \\"Mr E.H. Carr as a Historian of the Bolshevik R√©gime\\" pp. 91‚Äì110 from Heretics and Renegades, Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1969 p. 94 A. J. P. Taylor called A History of Soviet Russia the most fair and best series of books ever written on Soviet history.Hughes-Warrington, p. 25 Taylor was later to call Carr \\"an Olympian among historians, a Goethe in range and spirit\\".Davies, \\"Edward Hallett Carr\\", p. 473 American journalist Harrison Salisbury called Carr \\"one of the half dozen greatest specialists in Soviet affairs and in Soviet-German relations\\".Haslam, The Vices of Integrity, p. 177 British academic Michael Cox praised the History of Soviet Russia series as \\"an amazing construction: almost pyramid-like [...] in its architectural audacity\\"Cox, Michael \\"Introduction\\" pp. 1‚Äì20 from E.H.

Michael Cox, London: Pargrave, 2000 p. 3 British historian John Barber argued that History of Soviet Russia series through a scrupulous and detailed survey of the evidence \\"transformed\\" the study of Soviet history in the West.Barber, John \\"Carr, Edward Hallett\\" pp. 191‚Äì192 from Great Historians of the Modern Age ed. Lucian Boia, New York: Greenwood Press, 1991 p. 192 British historian Hugh Seton-Watson called Carr \\"an object of admiration and gratitude\\" for his work in Soviet studies.Haslam, The Vices of Integrity, p. xi The British Marxist historian Hillel Ticktin praised Carr as an honest historian of the Soviet Union and accused critics like Norman Stone, Richard Pipes and Leopold Labedz as \\"Cold Warriors\\" who were \\"not unconnected with serving the needs of official British and American foreign policy\\".Ticktin, Hillel \\"Carr, the Cold War, and the Soviet Union\\" pp. 145‚Äì161 from E.H. Carr A Critical Appraisal ed. Michael Cox, London: Palgrave, 2000 pp. 148‚Äì151 In 1983, four American historians, namely Geoff Eley, W. Rosenberg, Moshe Lewin and Ronald Suny, wrote in a joint article in the London Review of Books of the \\"grandeur\\" of Carr's work and his \\"extraordinary pioneering quality\\".Davies, R.W. \\"Edward Hallett Carr\\" pg. 503 They claimed that the scope of Carr's history was such that he \\"went where no one had gone before and where only a few have really gone since\\", thus providing \\"an agenda of questions which will be pursued for the rest of the 20th century\\". British historian Jonathan Haslam called Carr a victim of British \\"McCarthyism\\" who was unjustly punished for his willingness to defend and praise the Soviet Union.Haslam, \\"E.H. Carr's Search for Meaning, 1892‚Äì1982\\" pp. 21‚Äì35 from E.H. Carr A Critical Appraisal ed. Michael Cox, London: Palgrave, 2000 p. 32 Eric Hobsbawm wrote that Carr's History of Soviet Russia \\"constitutes, with Joseph Needham's Science and Civilisation in China, the most remarkable effort of single-handed historical scholarship undertaken in Britain within living memory\\". American historian Peter Wiles called the History of Soviet Russia \\"one of the great historiographical enterprises of our day\\" and wrote of Carr's \\"immensely impressive\\" work American historian Arno J. Mayer wrote that \\"the History of Soviet Russia [...] established E.H. Carr not only as the towering giant among Western specialists of recent Russian history, but certainly also as the leading British historian of his generation\\".Carr, The Twilight of the Comintern, back-jacket Unusually for a book by a Western historian, A History of Soviet Russia met with warily favourable reviews by Soviet historians. Normally, any works by Western historians met with hostile reviews in the Soviet Union no matter how favourable and there was even a brand of polemical literature by Soviet historians attacking so-called \\"bourgeois historians\\" under the xenophobic grounds that only Soviet historians were capable of understanding the Soviet past\\".Laqueur, pp. 200‚Äì204 The History of Soviet Russia series were not translated into Russian and published in the Soviet Union until 1990.White, p. 109 A Soviet journal commented in 1991 that Carr was \\"almost unknown to a broad Soviet readership\\", although all Soviet historians were aware of his work and most of them had considerable respect for Carr, but they had been unable to say so until Perestroika. Those Soviet historians who specialised in rebutting the \\"bourgeois falsifiers\\" as Western historians were so labelled in the Soviet Union attacked Carr for writing that Soviet countryside was in chaos after 1917, but they praised him as one of the \\"few bourgeois authors\\" who told the \\"truth\\" about Soviet economic achievements.White, pp. 109‚Äì110 Through right up until glasnost period, Carr was considered a \\"bourgeois falsifier\\" in the Soviet Union, but he was praised as a British historian who taken \\"certain steps\\" towards Marxism and whose History of Soviet Russia was described as \\"fairly objective\\" and \\"one of the most fundamental works in bourgeois Sovietology\\".White, p. 110 In a preface to the Soviet edition of The History of Soviet Russia in 1990, the Soviet historian Albert Nenarokov wrote that in his lifetime Carr had been \\"automatically been ranked with the falsifiers\\", but in fact The History of Soviet Russia was a \\"scrupulous, professionally conscientious work\\".White, p. 119 Nenarokov called Carr a \\"honest, objective scholar, espousing liberal principles and attempting on the basis of an enormous documentary base to create a satisfactory picture of the epoch he was considering and those involved in it, to assist a sober and realistic perception of the USSR and a better understanding of the great social processes of the twentieth century\\". However, Nenarokov expressed some concern about Carr's use of Stalinism language such as calling Nikolai Bukharin part of the \\"right deviation\\" in the Bolshevik Party without the use of the quotation marks. Nenarokov took the view that Carr had too narrowly reduced Soviet history after 1924 down to a choice of either Joseph Stalin or Leon Trotsky, arguing that Bukharin was a better, more humane alternative to both Stalin and Trotsky. The pro-Soviet slant in Carr's The History of Soviet Russia attracted some controversy.Laqueur, pp. 124‚Äì133 In a 1955 review in Commentary, Bertram Wolfe accused Carr of systemically taking on Vladimir Lenin's point of view in History of Soviet Russia volumes and of being unwilling to consider other perspectives on Russian history.Wolfe, Bertram \\"Professor Carr's \\"Wave of the Future\\" Western Academics and Soviet Realities\\", Commentary, Volume XIX, Issue # 3, March 1955, p. 288 In 1962, British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper argued that Carr's identification with the \\"victors\\" of history meant that Carr saw Stalin as historically important and that he had neither time nor sympathy for the millions of Stalin's victims.Trevor-Roper, pp. 75‚Äì76 Anglo-American historian Robert Conquest argued that Carr took the official reasons for the launching of the first five-year plan too seriously.Conquest, Robert \\"Agit-Prof\\" pp. 32‚Äì38 from The New Republic, Volume 424, Issue # 4, 1 November 1999 p. 35 Furthermore, Conquest maintained that Carr's opponents such as Leonard Schapiro, Adam Ulam, Bertram Wolfe and Robert C. Tucker had a far better understanding of Soviet history than did Carr.Conquest, Robert \\"Agit-Prof\\" pp. 32‚Äì38 from The New Republic, Volume 424, Issue # 4, 1 November 1999 p. 34 Pipes wrote that the essential questions of Soviet history were \\"Who were the Bolsheviks, what did they want, why did some follow them and others resist? What was the intellectual and moral atmosphere in which all these events occurred?\\" and went on to note that Carr failed to pose these questions, let alone answer them.Laqueur, p. 119 Pipes was later to compare Carr's single paragraph dismissal in the History of Soviet Russia of the 1921 famine as unimportant with Holocaust denial.Pipes, Richard Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime, New York: Alfred Knopf, 1993 p. 410 Kronstadt mutiny, to which Carr gave only a few lines Polish Kremlinologist Leopold Labedz criticised Carr for taking the claims of the Soviet government too seriously.Laqueur, p. 235 Labedz went on to argue that Carr's decision to end the History of Soviet Russia series at 1929 reflected an inability and unwillingness to criticize Stalin's Soviet Union.Labedz, p. 107 Labedz was very critical of Carr's handling of sources, arguing that Carr was too inclined to accept official Soviet documents at face value and unwilling to admit to systematic falsification of the historical record under Stalin.Labedz, p. 103 Finally, Labedz took Carr to task over what he regarded as Carr's tendency to white-wash Soviet crimes \\"behind an abstract formula which often combines \\"progressive\\" stereotypes with the lexicon of Soviet terminology\\".Labedz, p. 95 Norman Stone argued that Carr was guilty of writing in a bland style meant to hide his pro-Soviet sympathies. Walter Laqueur argued that the History of Soviet Russia volumes were a dubious historical source that for the most part excluded the unpleasant aspects of Soviet life, reflecting Carr's pro-Soviet tendencies.Laqueur, pp. 235‚Äì236 A major source of criticism of a History of Soviet Russia was Carr's decision to ignore the Russian Civil War under the grounds it was unimportant and likewise to his devoting only a few lines to the Kronstadt mutiny of 1921 since Carr considered it only a minor event.Laqueur, pp. 118‚Äì119 Laqueur commented that Carr's ignoring the Russian Civil War while paying an inordinate amount of attention to such subjects as the relations between the Bolshevik and Swedish Communist parties and Soviet diplomatic relations with Outer Mongolia in the 1920s left the History of Soviet Russia very unbalanced.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=395163 on 2010-12-24 A study, released in September 2010, showed that the subfamily Muricopsinae is polyphyletic Characteristics This subfamily has been delineated based on the characteristics of the operculum and the radula. The shell is wide in the middle and tapers at both ends, making it fusiform to biconic. The size of the shell varies in length between 5 mm and 85 mm. Its color is white or brown, covered with subdued shades of brown, orange, red or purple markings. The aperture is broadly oval to almost round and is of variable size. Contrary to the other Muricidae, the siphonal canal, the semi-tubular extension of the aperture, is of moderate length. Like the other murex shells, each convex whorl shows a variable number (four or more) of more or less prominent varices (a thickened axial ridge in the shell), which, in turn, show foliaceous or spinose projections.George E. Radwin and Anthony D'Attilio, Murex Shells of the World, Stanford University Press, 1976 The operculum is the same as in the subfamily Muricinae. It is unguiculate, thickened at the margin and depressed and annulate in the middle. The rachiglossan radula has in each row a three-dimensional rachidian tooth with a raised central cusp and two lateral teeth, as in the subfamily Ocenebrinae.

The St√•lhandske and Ihre families built their own grave chapels at the southern wall; the Ihre chapel is still preserved today, while the St√•lhandske chapel was torn down and the coffins were moved to the family grave in the surrounding churchyard.  History  The bell tower and the churchyard The church was probably build in the late 14th century. Its Romanesque baptismal font, however, comes from an older wooden church that had existed in the same place and whose remains were not discovered until the early 20th century. Since the mid-17th century, when the bell tower next to the building was erected, the church has been renovated many times. For example, until the 19th century it had no windows. Following the erection of a new church in the neighborhood in 1886, the Lundby Old Church was supposed to be torn down. It was saved thanks to protests by dean Peter Rydholm. The church was equipped with electricity in 1934 and with a modern ventilation system in 1998, which has been the latest major renovation up to this time. Churchyard The church is surrounded by a small churchyard, called Lundby Old Churchyard (Swedish: Lundby gamla kyrkog√•rd). It has an area of 1.7 hectares and houses around 1700 graves. The first records of it come from 1788, and the oldest existing map from 1856. The oldest tombstones, however, bear dates from the late 17th century. The area has probably been used as a burial ground since the 13th century, as long as the church has existed.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It stands about to the southeast of the village in the grounds of Stansted Hall. The church has been listed because of its \\"historical value and internal features\\". History The church was built between 1120 and 1124 by William Mountfitchet and still retains some features from that time. In the 13th century the chancel was extended towards the east, and a chapel was added to the north side of the church. The west tower was added in 1692. The church was extensively restored in 1888 by Francis T. Dollman, at which time the nave and the aisle were rebuilt. A chapel of ease dedicated to Saint John the Evangelist was built in 1889 nearer the centre of the village. This church is now the parish church of Stansted Mountfitchet. St Mary's remains consecrated and is used for occasional services and other events. Architecture St Mary's is constructed in flint and stone, and the tower is in brick. The chancel arch and the north and south doorways survive from the original building, and are in Norman style. The chancel arch is decorated with zigzag and ball flower carving. The doorways are similar and each has three orders of columns with scalloped capitals and saltire decoration. The tympanum in each doorway is decorated with diapering. The font dates from the 13th century, and its ogee- shaped cover from the 17th century. The communion rail is from the 18th century. The monuments include the stone effigy of a knight in armour lying in a recess with his legs crossed. It is said to be a memorial to Roger de Lancaster who died in 1310. The other significant monuments date from the 17th century. The monument to Sir Thomas Middleton consists of a recumbent effigy lying on a sarcophagus under a coffered arch carried on black marble Corinthian columns. The other is an altar tomb to Hester Middleton who died in 1614, again with a recumbent figure on a sarcophagus. Hester was either the wife, or the daughter of Sir Thomas. External features The churchyard contains the war graves of five service personnel of World War I, and four of World War II. Tower & Bells The brick tower contains a ring of eight bells, cast by wide mix of different founders. The way these bells are hung/rung is especially rare, as they are organised in an anti-clockwise fashion, unlike in most other bell-towers where ringing circle is organised in a clockwise configuration. The largest of the eight bells weighs 13 Hundred- weight.http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=Stansted&Submit;=+Go+&DoveID;=STANSTED+M Despite the church being redundant these bells continue to be regularly rung, and a monthly practice is organised by the North-Western district of the \\"Essex Association of Change Ringers\\" which is held, (Starting from 7:45pm) usually on the second Friday of every month - apart from April & August due to the regional ringing school & summer holidays respectively.

Arcadia was built as a private wooden motorboat of the same name in 1915 by Frank S. Terry at Brooklyn, New York. In 1917, the U.S. Navy chartered her from her owner for use as a section patrol boat during World War I and took delivery of her on 8 October 1918. No logbooks exist to confirm that she was commissioned as USS Arcadia (SP-856) or to describe the extent and nature of her U.S. Navy service. Given the short period the Navy controlled her and the ending of the war just under five weeks after her acquisition, it is possible that she never was commissioned. Arcadias final disposition also is murky.

In Albania a complete name usually consists of a given name (); the given name of the individual's father (), which is seldom included except in official documents; and a (most commonly patrilineal) family name or surname (). They are invariably given in the Western name order, or given name followed by family name. Albanian given names are traditionally original Albanian-meaning names, or religious names (Islamic or Christian). During the Communist regime, based on the theory of the Illyrian origin of Albanians, supposedly Illyrian names were constructed as appropriate names instead of religious ones. The government issued a decree ordering people to change their religious names to \\"pure Albanian names\\", while newborns had to receive non-religious names. Albanian names have changed dramatically with more opting for foreign, English or Romance names in recent times than traditional Balkan names. In addition Albanians from Albania tend to focus on names that are Greek, Italian, Western European as opposed to those in Kosovo, North Macedonia and elsewhere that are either religious, local, geographic or related to traditionalism.  Given names  While in Kosovo, Montenegro and North Macedonia, Albanian (\\"Illyrian\\") and religious names are quite common, in Albania proper, Albanian or Muslim names are rarely given. This is partly a result of the high net emigration rate of Albania and the desire of most Albanian emigrants to assimilate internationally. Another factor is the secularisation that took place during Socialist rule, which discouraged explicitly Christian or Muslim given names. In 2014, among the 20 most commonly used given names for newborn children in Albania, there was not a single Albanian name. Instead, \\"international\\" (Christian or English) names were most popular. Traditionally, given names in Albania did not have Albanian origins because they were religious names, either Christian or Islamic. In Communist Albania, an Illyrian origin of the Albanians (without denying \\"Pelasgian roots\\",Stephanie Schwandner-Sievers, Bernd J√ºrgen Fischer, Albanian Identities: Myth and History, Indiana University Press, 2002, , page 96, \\"but when Enver Hoxha declared that their origin was Illyrian (without denying their Pelasgian roots), no one dared participate in further discussion of the question\\". a theory which has been revitalized todayAnthropological Journal of European Cultures, 2009, Gilles de Rapper.) continued to play a significant role in Albanian nationalism, resulting in a revival of given names supposedly of Illyrian origin, at the expense of given names associated with Christianity or Islam. This trend originated with the 19th century Rilindja, but became more common after 1944, when it became the Socialist government‚Äôs policy to heavily discourage religious given names. Ideologically acceptable names were listed in the Fjalor me emra njer√´zish (1982). These could be native Albanian words like Flutur (\\"butterfly\\"), ideologically communist ones like Marenglen (Marx-Engels-Lenin), or \\"Illyrian\\" ones compiled from epigraphy, e.g. from the necropolis at Dyrrhachion excavated in 1958-60. Miranda Vickers, The Albanians Chapter 9. \\"Albania Isolates itself\\" page 196, \\"From time to time the state gave out lists with pagan, supposed Illyrian or newly constructed names that would be proper for the new generation of revolutionaries.\\"  Surnames  Many surnames in Albania have Islamic and Christian roots. The long mutual influence of the population resulted in a large number of Albanian surnames ending in iƒá, oviƒá or ovit even under Ottoman rule. Common last name endings include -aj, as well as common definite Albanian nominative singular endings: hence -i for originally masculine last names except for those previously ending in k, g, h or i, which have -u added; or -a/-ja for feminine names. Many last names were originally surnames, many of these being either Muslim (Ahmeti, Rexhepi, etc.), Bektashi (Bektashi itself as a surname, Dervishi, Shehu, etc.) or Christian (Kristo(ja), Evangjeli, etc.), but a large number are neither and are simply from old Albanian secular names (Zogolli, Dushku, Shkoza etc.). Albanians frequently have surnames that don't match their actual religious identity, often because of recent secularization, religious intermarriage, relatively recent conversion in late Ottoman times (many Muslims have Christian names for this reason, while after the fall of communism some with Muslim ancestry have become practicing Christians and vice versa) or the practice of Ottoman Christians taking Muslim names due to Muslim dominance of society during those times. Names starting with Papa- usually indicate Christian origin but there are cases where it is followed by a Muslim element (i.e. Papazisi, a name held by Albanians of both Christian and Muslim heritage). Another major source of Albanian last names are place names- Albanians sometimes took their hometowns as surnames, \\"the custom of taking their native village names as surnames was and is still common among Albanians...\\" and especially when a family moved to another place, they often took their former residence as a surname, leading to somewhat well known last names such as Frash√´ri, P√´rmeti, Shkodra, Kelmendi, Shkreli, Delvina, Prishtina, etc.). In the North and in Kosovo, clan names are also very prominent, most notably the names of widespread clans such as Krasniqi, Berisha and Gashi. The surnames Gega, Gegprifti, Gegaj etc. probably indicate Northern (Gheg) origins, as Tosku and Toskaj do for Southerners. In addition, many names, even if not explicitly, are strongly identified with certain regions and Albanians can often tell another Albanian's regional origin from their last name. Surnames based on occupation are less common than in other countries but nevertheless the surnames Hoxha (mullah, either Bektashi or Sunni) and Prifti (priest, used by both Catholics and Orthodox) remain very common. Arvanite and pre- modern Albanian surnames are also common. Many Arvanite surnames are found in Albania, in the modern Albanian form. For example, the word in Arvanitika (Arb√´risht) for \\"brave\\" or \\"pallikari\\" (in Greek) being \\"√ßanavar\\" (Turkish canavar meaning \\"monster\\") or its shortened form \\"√ßavar\\" was pronounced \\"tzanavar\\" or \\"tzavar\\" giving birth to Arvanitic family names like \\"Tzanavaras\\" and/or \\"Tzavaras\\". This is a link between Albanian and Greek names. The Arvanite surname \\"ŒöœÅŒπŒµŒ∂ŒÆœÇ\\" (Kriezis) is a very common Albanian surname. \\"Kryezi\\" means \\"Blackhead\\" in Albanian (hence same meaning in Arb√´risht/Arvanitika). Orthodox Christian names tend to be heavily Greek, including last names which have counterparts in the Greek language.  History  = Communist-era Albania = According to a decree issued in 1966, Muslims in Albania had to change their names to Albanian names while newborn Albanians had to receive non-religious names. In a decree of November 1975, all the citizens of Albania whose names were considered objectionable by the Albanian Communist Party were ordered to change their names to \\"pure Albanian names\\" by the end of the year. = Situation in the present = Albanians form the largest migrant group in Greece and second largest migrant group in Italy. Many modern names are thus Greek or Italian. In Greece, and likewise in Italy, many Albanian newcomers change their Albanian names to Greek or Italian ones and their religion, if they are not Christian, from Islam to Christianity: Even before emigration, more and more people in the south of Albania are pretending to be Greeks, and even are changing their Muslim names to Greek ones in order to not being discriminated against in Greece. By this way, they hope to get a visa for Greece.

Life Klenkok was born in the County of Hoya, part of what is now Lower Saxony, son of a castellan in Thedinghausen. He studied philosophy and theology in Germany with the Augustinians, then took a bachelor's degree at the University of Paris. He was in Bologna from 1342 to 1346. At the University of Oxford for about four years, from the first half of 1357, Klenkok transmitted the views of Gregory of Rimini. His intention was to oppose the positions of Uthred of Bolton. He was incepted in theology there, in 1359. Views and background Klenkok is now known as a critic of aspects of the feudal law and common law traditions. He opposed the Sachsenspiegel, a civil law code applied in parts of Germany in his time. He debated it with Rudolf Block. His work the Decadicon from 1368‚Äì9 was an attack on it.s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Hermits of St. Augustine Later Klenkok looked for support from the French canonist Pierre de la Vergne, who became a cardinal in 1371. In 1374 Pope Gregory XI issued a bull and condemned 14 articles of the Sachsenspiegel. Others like Klenkok who put forth a revised version of the views of Gregory of Rimini included Hugolin of Orvieto, Johann Hiltalinger, Angelinus Dobelinus, and Johannes Zacharie. Of these, Dobelinus considered Klenkok his personal teacher. As a commentator at Paris he was in the company of John of Ripa, Facinus de Ast, Michael Aiguani and Andrew of Neufchateau. These writers stood rather apart from the trend of the moderni. Editions As of 1999, a modern scholarly edition of his works was lacking.

It is a rural county of rolling hills, such as the Mendip Hills, Quantock Hills and Exmoor National Park, and large flat expanses of land including the Somerset Levels. Modern man came to what is now known as Somerset during the Early Upper Palaeolithic era. In the Neolithic era, from about 3500 BC, there is evidence of farming when people started to manage animals and grow crops on farms cleared from the woodland, rather than act purely as hunter gatherers. It is also likely that extraction and smelting of mineral ores to make tools, weapons, containers and ornaments in bronze and then iron started in the late Neolithic and into the Bronze and Iron Ages. The construction of Hill forts began in Britain in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the first millennium BC. The reason for their emergence, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were separated from the sources of tin and copper necessary to make bronze, and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase played a role and has stated \\"the forts provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress of an increasing population burst out into open warfare. But I would not see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction\\". There are numerous Iron Age hill forts and ancient settlement sites in the county, some of which were later reused in the Dark Ages, such as Cadbury Castle, Worlebury Camp and Ham Hill. Other hill forts, such as Small Down Knoll, Solsbury Hill, Dolebury Warren and Burledge Hill, may have had a domestic purpose as well as a defensive role. The Iron Age tribes of the Somerset area were the Dobunni in north Somerset, Durotriges in south Somerset and Dumnonii in west Somerset. Iron Age sites on the Quantock Hills, include major hill forts at Dowsborough and Ruborough, as well as smaller earthwork enclosures, such as Trendle Ring, Elworthy Barrows and Plainsfield Camp. In addition to the hill forts, several sites have been identified as settlements during the pre Roman period including Cambria Farm and the \\"Lake Villages\\" at Meare and Glastonbury which were built on a morass, on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, bracken, rubble and clay. Most of the sites fell out of use with the coming of the Romans and therefore this list covers those sites occupied until that time. Almost all of the sites in the list are Scheduled Monuments. In the United Kingdom, a Scheduled Monument is a \\"nationally important\\" archaeological site or historic building, given protection against unauthorised change. Scheduled Monuments are specified in the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, which defines a monument as: :Any building, structure or work above or below the surface of the land, any cave or excavation; any site comprising the remains of any such building, structure or work or any cave or excavation; and any site comprising or comprising the remains of any vehicle, vessel or aircraft or other movable structure or part thereof... (Section 61 (7)). Damage to a scheduled monument is a criminal offence and any work taking place at one of these sites requires Scheduled Monument Consent from the Secretary of State. In England, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport keeps the register, or schedule, of nationally important sites which receive state protection, which now includes over 31,000 sites.

A Great Depression-era public works bond was provided to fund the creation of a new auto-centric four-lane highway bridge. After the city renamed Jerome Street which approached the bridge after incumbent Republican Mayor George Lysle, they proposed that the Youghiogheny crossing receive the same moniker. However, the Franklin Roosevelt administration contended that public works dollars could not be used to memorialize living officeholders. As a result, the Jerome Street designation was chosen, and it remains in place today, although it is sometimes referred to as the Lysle Boulevard Bridge.

History HydroPoint was founded by Chris Spain, Chris Manchuck and Peter Carlson. For 20 years before this, Spain sold emerging growth technology startups as a way to combine his interest in environmental sustainability with his expertise in technology. He founded the company when he noticed that water would eventually become a big issue and that lack of data further complicated it. The company's core solutions address smart water management which is needed because of the increasing price of water often due to drought, loss of water due to evaporation, social concerns, and over watering. In order to counter this, the company has engineered a sophisticated weather based irrigation system which is connected to its climate monitoring center. The system incorporates site-specific data such as elevation, types of plants, soil and relative exposure to sunshine along with external real-time data. In all, HydroPoint smart irrigation solutions, under the brand name WeatherTRAK, collect more than 8 million data points daily, from more than 40,000 sensors. It then uses a process called the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model developed by a number of government agencies as the basis for its weather- modeling software. The WeatherTRAK brand of irrigation controllers provides precise scheduling based on the system's algorithms that evaluate the collected data. The company offers site evaluations, irrigation system efficiency audits, leak detection, weather analytics, installation or upgrade of current systems and ongoing support and training.

Diplomats note that he has played the game of high-stakes, partisan politics well, although his reputation for decisiveness and shrewdness has been tarnished by a sometimes vindictive pettiness. Another cable refers to Harper's controlling ways within the Conservatives. * Michael Ignatieff, former Leader of the Official Opposition, was described as an \\"urbane, articulate, bilingual and with an impressive Rolodex of contacts around the world ‚Äì including in the new Obama administration\\". Another cable cites a conversation between the Liberal Party national director Rocco Rossi and American embassy officials that Ignatieff did not typically listen to advisers and seemed unable to absorb helpful critiques on his speech delivery. * Laureen Harper, Spouse of the Prime Minister, was described by an embassy official as extroverted and friendly. The cables note that she was \\"personable, free-spirited and with considerable personal charm, a pro at working a room, and many observers believe her to be more at ease in front of cameras and strangers than her husband\\".

China *Hu Jintao, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, was described by Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso as \\"confident and relaxed\\" during their meetings in April 2009. This is in contrast to Wen Jiabao, Premier of the People's Republic of China, who was \\"very tired and seemed under a lot of pressure\\", attributed to the ongoing financial crisis. *Xi Jinping, a senior leader in the Communist Party and its presumed future CCP General Secretary (a presumption proved correct in 2012), is portrayed as an \\"extremely ambitious\\" person who is incorruptible and has chosen to survive by becoming \\"redder than reds\\". A source close to Xi has revealed that he is neither corrupt nor a fan of democracy. He appears uninterested in leisure pursuits preferred by many high-ranking officials.

Eritrea Isaias Afwerki, President of Eritrea, was described by the U.S. Ambassador to Eritrea as a cruel \\"unhinged dictator\\" whose regime was \\"one bullet away from implosion\\". \\"This man is a lunatic\\", described the Djiboutian foreign minister, Mahmoud Ali Youssouf. A defected bodyguard remarked that Isaias was a recluse who spent his days painting and tinkering with gadgets and carpentry work. He appeared to make decisions in isolation with no discussion with his advisers. It was difficult to tell how Isaias would react each day and his moods changed constantly. Ethiopia Meles Zenawi, Prime Minister of Ethiopia, is described by Donald Yamamoto, United States Ambassador to Ethiopia, as a man thirsty for power who will cling on to power till his last breath. His ideas are based on \\"it's my way or the highway\\" best described by David Shinn, former Ambassador to Ethiopia. He has been portrayed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel an \\"economic illiterate\\". He is known to dislike his critics even in their constructive criticism of his policies and does not even listen to his advisers.

Preval is described as fearful of exile, passive, indifferent to his advisors, and at the same time prone to micro-management.

They claim that he is a virtual unknown to most young Iranians who \\"feel and think nothing\\" when they hear his name. At the same time, he is hated by most of the older population who regard him as a former radical follower of Khomeini, and is more remembered for all the killings that went on during his tenure as prime minister and being one of the architects of Hezbollah in Lebanon, which is described as the single most hated group by Iranians, more so than the Revolutionary Guards itself. For that, they doubted that he would have garnered enough votes to be considered a serious threat by the conservative establishment. He was also described as being a member of the \\"flower power\\" in his college years, and was a recreational user of marijuana. *Previously unreleased documents actually showed strong disapproval with the methods of the former Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi in the years leading up to the 1979 Iranian Revolution, who is labeled as a \\"sensitive totalitarian\\" who \\"lacks understanding\\" and \\"how he plans to achieve his goals remain unclear\\" (in regards to establishing the Rastakhiz Party under a one-party system), which strongly contrasts with the official American position on him at the time. He was said to have \\"extreme sensitivity to criticism and strong desire to receive overt evidence of public support\\". The former Prime Minister Amir Abbas Hoveida is labeled as the Shah's \\"Chief Dancer\\" whose \\"court is merely a facade\\", while the security apparatus SAVAK is called \\"poorly organized\\" (despite being aided in its establishment by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency) and \\"going as far as Isfahan to round up the innocent with the guilty\\".

Gene Cretz, U.S. Ambassador to Libya, noted that Gaddafi never travels without his \\"voluptuous blonde\\" Ukrainian nurse, with whom some claim he is romantically linked.

John agreed with the Chinese officials that \\"President Arroyo has stabilized Philippine leadership and enacted strong fiscal and economic policy, but stressed that Beijing and Washington must encourage Manila to continue working hard to promote transparency and good governance.\\" *A leaked diplomatic cable also claimed that Arroyo's administration was corrupt, even worse than that of Ferdinand Marcos, and that Arroyo's husband, Jose Miguel Arroyo, is one of the most corrupt. Russia *Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister of Russia, wields less power than his \\"alpha dog\\" image in the media portrays. He is alleged to bribe Kremlin figures, or else many of his edicts are not implemented. American diplomats have raised concerns over personal corruption, calling Putin's Russia a \\"mafia state\\".

Diplomats have also discussed Putin's very close relationship with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, and \\"the pair enjoyed such a close relationship that they shared a 'direct line. It is suspected that Berlusconi's personal relationship with Putin influenced the sale of part of Russian state-owned Gazprom's oil subsidiary Gazpromneft to Italian Eni.

Yemen President of Yemen Ali Abdullah Saleh was described as a bizarre and extremely poor negotiator, wearing a buttoned-down khaki during a counter-terrorism meeting with US National Security Advisor John O. Brennan, and was described as disdainful and dismissive throughout the meeting. While at times he was conciliatory and congenial in matters such as terrorism and security, he was seemingly uninterested in the fundamental socio-economic issues the country is facing. Despite Brennan being there on the issues of Guantanamo detainees, he summons him on \\"important intelligence matters\\" only to claim that he has evidence that pro-Saddam Baathists are reorganizing to overthrow the government in Iraq, much to Brennan's annoyance. He reportedly does not trust his own country and prefers to force the Saudis and Americans to do the dirty work for him, such as infrastructure development and dealing with Islamists, while he prefers to take out his anger against separatists and has claimed on occasion that he is keeping the lid on top of a country that is \\"worse than Somalia\\". It is also noted that Saleh is overwhelmed, exhausted by the war, and more and more intolerant of internal criticism. Zimbabwe *Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, was described as the devil.

Playing career Slovak played as a youth in the developmental program of hometown club, HC Ko≈°ice, from 1997 to 2001. He made his Slovak Extraliga debut with Ko≈°ice in the 1999‚Äì00 season, appearing in a pair of games. After impressing on the international junior stage for the Slovak junior team, Slovak was selected by the Nashville Predators in the second round, 42nd overall, in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft. With intention to pursue an NHL career, Slovak opted to play major junior hockey in North America after he was drafted 4th overall in the 2001 CHL Import Draft by the Kelowna Rockets of the Western Hockey League (WHL). Slovak enjoyed a standout second season with the Rockets in 2002‚Äì03, contributing with 71 points in 65 games to lead the league amongst defensemen. Having concluded his junior career, Slovak's was expected to compete for a roster position on the Predators defense corps. However, with the Predators going heavy in 2003 NHL Entry Draft on blue chip defenseman Ryan Suter and Shea Weber, his rights were traded by the Nashville Predators to the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for Sergei Soin on June 21, 2003. On July 15, 2003, Slovak agreed to a three-year, entry-level contract with the Avalanche. After attending the Avalanche's training camp, Slovak was assigned to begin his rookie season with affiliate, Hershey Bears, of the American Hockey League. In the 2003‚Äì04 season, Slovak split time between the Bears and the Reading Royals of the ECHL. He contributed with 11 points in 43 AHL games. In the following 2004‚Äì05 season, with his role affected with the Bears by the 2004‚Äì05 NHL Lockout, Slovak returned to Slovakia after just one game with the Bears and played out the season with HC Ko≈°ice. Slovak returned to North America for the final year of his entry-level contract with the Avalanche in the 2005‚Äì06 season. He was familiarly assigned by Colorado to the AHL, playing with new partner the Lowell Lock Monsters. In 59 games, Slovak produced just 8 assists from the blueline, signalling the end of his tenure within the Avalanche organization. On the opening day of free agency, Slovak was unable to gain NHL interest and opted to sign a contract with Swedish club, Mora IK of the then Elitserien on July 1, 2006. He played just 6 games with Mora in the 2006‚Äì07 season, before embarking on a tumultuous year by playing in four separate European teams in three different leagues.

History A collection of nine waltzes and one ballad, many of the songs were written by Ostroushko for family and friends that he didn't expect to record. The title song was one he had written and played once on A Prairie Home Companion, and never played again.  Reception  In his Allmusic review, music critic Jeff Tamarkin wrote :There's a quiet elegance and an undeniable timelessness embedded in the ten songs that comprise When the Last Morning Glory Blooms, as if Peter Ostroushko didn't so much write them as discover them, lying around undisturbed for a hundred years, on yellowed sheet music atop a forgotten parlor piano in some dusty attic... Ostroushko avoids flourish and the ostentatious; his technique on both mandolin and fiddle is the definition of virtuosity, but that's never what it's about for him. Ostroushko's purpose in brandishing an instrument isn't to dazzle with flash and style but to communicate as directly as possible, both with his fellow players and his listeners, and he accomplishes that easily here... Ostroushko displays, not for the first time and surely not for the last, why the praises never stop coming his way.

A typical outcrop of the formation is exposed at Bronte Creek just south of the Queen Elizabeth Way. The formation is a part of the Queenston Delta clastic wedge, formed as an erosional response to the Taconic Orogeny. Lithologically, the formation is dominated by red and grey shales with thin siltstone, limestone and sandstone interlayers. As materials, comprising the clastic wedge, become coarser in close proximity to the Taconic source rocks, siltstone and sandstone layers are predominant in New York.  Structure and stratigraphy  The formation is wedge-shaped, thick (up to below Lake Erie), and laterally extensive, outcropping from Western New York to Cabot Head. It thins from southeast to northwest at around 0.6 metres per kilometre and has a dip of 3¬∞ to the south-southwest. The formation is the topmost Ordovician layer in Southern Ontario and is unconformably overlain by the Lower Silurian rocks of the Cataract Group. At its base it has a conformable gradational contact with underlying beds of the Georgian Bay Formation in Southern Ontario, the Carlsbad Formation near Ottawa, and the Oswego Formation in New York.  Lithology  The formation is composed primarily of red and grey hematitic, sandy, calcareous and argillaceous shales with localized greenish banding. Colouration is connected to post-depositional processes: red portions are the result of oxidation of iron-bearing minerals and green comes from reduction, possibly by acidic groundwater. The formation also contains thin layers of calcareous sandstone, bioclastic, argillaceous and silty limestone, as well as calcareous sandstone. Coarser layers become much thicker in New York. Minor amounts of gypsum, in nodules and laminae, are found throughout. On the Manitoulin Island, the formation is dominated by limestone and dolomite. = Fossils = The formation is devoid of fossils in the uppermost shaly layers and is poorly fossiliferous throughout other parts, particularly, the bioclastic beds, where brachiopods, bryozoans, ostracodes, pelecypods, gastropods, tabulate corals and trilobites (Acernaspis) are found. Ichnofossils are more common, represented by Diplocraterion, Skolithos and Chondrites.  Facies and depositional environments  Most of the sediments was deposited in the near-coastal semiarid setting with shallow, wide, muddy, prograding shore, affected by tides, frequent storms and fluctuating sea level of tectonic or, possibly, eustatic origin (Andean-Saharan glaciation). Prior to lithification, the mud deposits had been frequently exposed subaerially and desiccated, as evidenced by the numerous mudcracks, while evaporites (mostly, gypsum) were deposited in isolated pools. The formation is composed of 14 facies, grouped into 4 facies associations, named A through D, corresponding to the specific depositional environments. Facies association A, composed mostly of dark grey shales, was deposited on a shelf, shallow enough to be affected by storms, that resulted in sandstone and bioclastic limestone layers. Facies association B was deposited under highly variable conditions, ranging from subtidal to intertidal to supratidal. It is defined by red and dark grey shales. Facies association C was deposited in the paralic setting and consists primarily of red shales. Facies association D, only found in New York, was deposited under fluvial conditions. It is dominated by sand, carried by braided rivers. Similar depositional environments are currently found at the Gulf of California and the northwest shore of Australia.  Economic significance  In New York, the formation's sandstone beds are commercially producing reservoir rocks for natural gas; the West Auburn Field has been productive since the 1940s. These beds are also currently considered for geological storage. In Ontario, shales of the formation have long been used by the ceramic industry, mainly for brick and tile production.

The yeast may be a dangerous pathogen and resistant to treatment in human hosts. Research on the fungi has therapeutic, medical and industrial implications. Taxonomy Candida blankii was discovered in the 1960s, after the analysis of the organs of infected mink in Canada by F. Blank. These mink were infected with the unknown yeast, and all died from mycosis. It was described in 1968 by H. R. Buckley and N. van Uden, who named it in honour of Blank.Page image list, Index of Fungi 3: 506 (1961‚Äì1970) Libri fungorum The description was published in the journal Mycopathologia et Mycologia Applicata, along with descriptions of four other new species. Identification On Sabouraud dextrose agar, C. blankii isolates present as typical yeast, i.e., cream-colored colonies, which then tend toward pink and later dark blue. Blood sample DNA sequencing of the 26S ribosomal subunit can definitively identify C. blankii. Ecology In nature, Candida blankii forms symbiotic relationships with other organisms. An Indian study of seven bee species and 9 plant species found 45 yeast species from 16 genera colonise the nectaries of flowers and honey stomachs of bees. Most were members of the genus Candida; the most common species in honey bee stomachs was Dekkera intermedia, while the most common species colonising flower nectaries was C. blankii. Although the mechanics are not fully understood, it was found that Azadirachta indica flowers more if C. blankii are present. =Human pathology= A few human infections of Candida blankii have been found. Their existence suggests that the condition may have been under-reported. In 2015, the yeast was found in the airways of a patient with cystic fibrosis; this was the first recorded case of C. blankii infection in humans. A second case was reported in 2018. The fungus proved resistant to treatment with antifungals. The yeast was characterized as \\"an opportunist pathogen for lung transplant and/or CF patients\\". Because of its resistance, it was said to warrant further study. Different strains, it was suggested, should also be studied \\"to increase knowledge of genetic diversity and antifungal susceptibility profile\\". Fungal blood-stream infections (fungaemia) have been newly associated with C blankii. Polyene antifungals have been identified as a possible treatment. The species has been detected in meat intended for human consumption, including Iberian ham. Biotechnology Like many yeasts, Candida blankii has been the subject of various biotechnological studies, including for use as a BOD biosensor. The metabolic process of C. blankii is aerobic. Consequently, it oxidizes many forms of alcohol, amino acid, carbohydrates, and other organic compounds. As a BOD biosensor, practical applications may be limited due to short term effectiveness. A diploid isolate of C. blankii had an observed \\"potential for use in single cell protein production from hemicellulose hydrolysates\\", which is related to Cellulosic ethanol (i.e., ethanol production). This yeast is one of several studied extensively for use in xylose fermentation. C. blankii has been tested as an aid for the degradation of hemicellulose hydrolycates. C. blankii \\"cultivated on a mixture of n-paraffins (6% vol/vol) has been shown to produce fumaric acid\\", which could be important in ethanol production, once the process is worked out.

Average rainfall/46.26in/yr/ average snowfall/5.7in/yr/. The name Sawnee Mountain actually refers to the entire ridge of approximately five miles (8 km) in length. At its summit, the elevation is above mean sea level, and is roughly above the surrounding terrain.http://www.mountainzone.com/mountains/detail.asp?fid=6427556 The Sawnee Mountain range runs southwest to northeast, and consists of five knolls and three gaps (Chamblee, Sawnee, and Bettes).http://www.mytopo.com/maps/index.cfm?search_string=sawnee+mountain Located only a few miles north of Cumming, Georgia (the county seat), the mountain is easily the highest point in Forsyth county. One of the highest peaks of metro Atlanta, it nudges out its prominently known neighbors Stone Mountain and Kennesaw Mountain by a hundred or so feet each. However, Sawnee is in the far northern exurbs, putting it in third place behind Bear Mountain and Pine Log Mountain to the west. Sawnee Mountain Preserve Sawnee Mountain view The Sawnee Mountain Preserve protects 963 acres of the mountain and is managed by the Natural Resource Management Division of Forsyth County Parks and Recreation. The Visitor Center features interactive exhibits about the natural and cultural histories of Sawnee Mountain, and a resource library and lounge. Environmental education programs are offered for school, scout and other groups, and a summer camp program is operated by the County. History It is believed that Native Americans may have used a natural clearing atop the mountain called the Indian Seats for ceremonial purposes.http://www.sawneemountain.org/ As white settlers migrated to the area, now known as Cumming, a local Cherokee named Sawnee helped them adjust to the native land. As a well skilled carpenter and farmer he was known throughout the land, and the range was named in his honor. In 1829 gold was discovered in Georgia in Auraria at the site of America's first gold rush. There are also mines in the ridges of Sawnee which is downstream the Chattahoochee from the major strike.http://ngeorgia.com/history/goldrush.html Current uses of the mountain are as a nature preserve park and a Radio station, WWEV-FM 91.5, which transmits from a radio tower at the top of the mountain. Originally, the station staff actually drove recorded programming to the top where it played from broadcast automation equipment, but it now uses a live studio/transmitter link.http://sites.google.com/site/sawneemtnorg/ The Sawnee Mountain Visitor Center is located at 4075 Spot Road and is one of the trailheads.

Construction, acquisition, and commissioning Arcadia was built as the German commercial steamer SS Arcadia in 1896 by Harland and Wolff at Belfast, Ireland. Upon the outbreak of World War I in Europe in early August 1914, Arcadia sought refuge from Allied forces in the United States, where she remained inactive through the period of American neutrality in the war. After the United States entered the war on the side of the Allies on 6 April 1917, the United States Customs Service seized her as enemy property and turned her over to the United States Shipping Board. Armed with two 3-inch (76.2-mm) guns manned by a United States Navy Armed Guard detachment, SS Arcadia operated under Shipping Board auspices for the remainder of World War I. After the war ended, Arcadias guns were removed at Baltimore, Maryland, on 4 December 1918, and her naval armed guard detachment was transferred off of the ship. On 20 January 1919, Arcadia was transferred to the U.S. Navy for service with the Cruiser and Transport Force. Assigned the naval registry identification number 1605, she was commissioned the same day as USS Arcadia (ID-1605) with Lieutenant Commander Peter F. Johnsen, USNRF, in command. U.S. Navy service Arcadia was fitted out for naval service and filled with cargo before departing the United States for France on 2 February 1919. Reaching French waters on 17 February 1919, Arcadia put into St. Nazaire on 19 February 1919 and discharged her cargo over the days that followed. Taking on ballast and embarking United States Army soldiers returning from World War I service in France, she left St. Nazaire on 1 March 1919 and, after a rough passage, reached Newport News, Virginia, on 17 March 1919. After disembarking her passengers, Arcadia put into the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company at Newport News for voyage repairs and alterations. After their completion, she departed Newport News on 1 April 1919 for another voyage to France. She reached Bordeaux, France, on 20 April 1919, where she embarked more troops and a return cargo of \\"aeroplane and gun parts\\" before getting underway on 26 April 1919. She arrived at the Bush Terminal at Brooklyn, New York, on 11 May 1919. She made one more voyage to Bordeaux during late May and early June 1919, returning troops to Newport News for the second time. Later that summer she made a voyage to St. Nazaire and return trip to Hampton Roads, Virginia, followed by a voyage to Brest, France, and return trip to Hoboken, New Jersey. In all, she brought more than 4,700 men home to the United States from Europe on her five westbound U.S. Navy transatlantic voyages. After completing her fifth and final U.S. Navy transatlantic voyage at Hoboken on 11 September 1919, Arcadia headed south on 12 September 1919, proceeding down the United States East Coast to Hampton Roads, where she moored alongside SS West Loquassuck - formerly the U.S. Navy cargo ship - at the U.S. Army base at Bush Bluff, later that day. A brief trip to the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company then followed. She soon returned to Bush Bluff. Disposal and later career Arcadia was decommissioned on 29 September 1919. She was stricken from the Navy List the same day and returned to the U.S. Shipping Board, once again becoming SS Arcadia. In 1923, the California Steamship Company acquired Arcadia. Nothing further is known of her career.

A duet for soprano and mezzo-soprano, it is considered the most famous barcarolle ever written and described in the Grove Book of Operas as \\"one of the world's most popular melodies.\\" The text, concerning the beauty of the night and of love, is by Jules Barbier. The piece The piece opens the opera's \\"Giulietta\\" act, set in Venice. It is sung by the characters Giulietta ‚Äì the protagonist Hoffmann's love, a Venetian courtesan ‚Äì and Nicklausse ‚Äì Hoffmann's poetic muse, in disguise as his faithful male companion. In addition to the Venetian location it sets the seductive and sinister tone of the Venice act in general and of Giulietta's character specifically. The music reappears later in the act in a septet, \\"H√©las! Mon c≈ìur s'√©gare encore,\\" which was constructed by editors of the opera. \\"Belle nuit\\" is in the 6/8 time signature characteristic of barcarolles, allegretto moderato. Approximately a minute of musical introduction occurs before the melody appears, although a flute accompaniment figure which suggests the melody, \\"suspend[ing] time\\" and creating anticipation for the melody before it begins, is played throughout the piece. Although it is sung by a juvenile male character, Nicklausse, in a \\"breeches role\\", and a female character, Giulietta, the fact of its being fundamentally a piece for two women's voices, intertwining in the same octave, means that in productions where Nicklausse has been played by a male baritone instead of a female mezzo-soprano, his part has been reassigned to a chorus soprano. Carl Dahlhaus cites the piece as an example of the duplicity of musical banality: in the period of Wagner, when serious opera was marked by chromaticism, Offenbach used the Barcarolle's very consonance to give a sinister feel to the act throughout which it recurs. Dahlhaus attributes this effect to the contrast between the \\"physical\\" presence of the vocal line and the ethereal feel of the instrumental introduction, creating a \\"mirage.\\" \\"Beneath the music we hear, there seems to be a second musical level descending into the abyss.\\" History The Barcarolle does not originate in The Tales of Hoffmann; it was written in 1864 for Offenbach's Die Rheinnixen, where it is sung as \\"Komm' zu uns\\" by the chorus of elves in the third act. In Hoffmann, it appeared in the version of 1881; although the third act was cut at the premiere, the location of the second act (Antonia) was changed from Munich to Venice in order to retain the duet, which was sung by offstage chorus and soloists rather than characters. The Barcarolle inspired the English composer Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji to write his Passeggiata veneziana sopra la Barcarola di Offenbach (1955‚Äì56). Moritz Moszkowski also wrote a virtuoso transcription of it for piano. Many subsequent films have made use of Offenbach's music for the Barcarolle, most famously Life Is Beautiful (1997). The piece, which in this film represents European culture as contrasted with Fascist oppression, is used diegetically, first in a scene where Guido sees Dora, the woman he loves, at the opera, and later when Guido plays the piece through the concentration camp on a record player and Dora, now his wife, hears it. Other uses include the Walt Disney Silly Symphony \\"Birds of a Feather\\" (1931); G.I. Blues (1960), where a jazzed-up version becomes the tune for Elvis Presley's \\"Tonight is so Right for Love\\"; Dad's Army (\\"Time on my Hands\\", 1972), where it is identified as a \\"German\\" classical song with a swing rhythm; Margaret (2011), and Midnight in Paris (2011). It is also the tune of \\"Adrift on a Star\\" from the musical The Happiest Girl in the World, of Ophelia's song in the Gilligan's Island episode \\"The Producer\\", and is used by Sherlock Holmes to set a trap for the criminals in The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone. Bob Dylan's song \\"I've Made Up My Mind To Give Myself To You\\" from his album Rough and Rowdy Ways (2020) quotes from the Barcarolle in the guitar accompaniment.Pareles, Jon (18 June 2020). \\"Bob Dylan Still Bristles on ‚ÄòRough and Rowdy Ways‚Äô\\".

The melody from \\"Belle nuit, √¥ nuit d'amour\\" was also adapted for the 1968 song \\"Please Don't Go\\", which was given English lyrics by Les Reed and Jackie Rae.

Baker was apprenticed to gunsmith Henry Nock and opened a gunshop of his own at 24 Whitechapel Road, London in 1775. He later wrote a book on his experiences when making and using rifles. The Baker rifle The British Army had been experimenting with rifles since the American Revolutionary War, but had found all available rifle designs either too fragile, cumbersome or slow firing to be able to use in a generalised war. On 4 February 1800, a number of leading gun makers were invited to Woolwich to trial their rifle designs by the Board of Ordnance, who were responsible for the procurement of weaponry for the army. Baker's design was chosen, and he was given an initial order for 800 rifles. In the same year, an \\"Experimental Corps of Riflemen\\" was raised by Colonel Coote Manningham and Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. William Stewart. The corps was manned by volunteer officers and soldiers from a variety of British regiments and militias, and would soon be renamed and normalised into the army under the name the 95th Rifles Regiment of Foot. By 1810, five British battalions, three of the 95th and two of the 60th Regiments, as well as several light companies of the King's German Legion were equipped with the Baker rifle. The rifle was renowned for its accuracy and range. It was used throughout the Napoleonic Wars and continued in service until the 1830s.

It is part of the Keuper Uplands, and within it, it is continued to the north-northeast and right of the River Main, by the Ha√überge, and to the south-southwest by the Franconian Heights. Part of the region is a designated as the Steigerwald Nature Park.  Geography  = Location = The Steigerwald lies at the junction of the Bavarian provinces of Lower, Middle, and Upper Franconia, the tripoint being marked by the Dreifrankenstein. It is located between the cities of Bamberg, Schweinfurt, W√ºrzburg, and Nuremberg. In the north, it is bounded by the course of the River Main, and in the east by the River Regnitz. Its southern boundary is formed by the River Aisch, and in the west by the Main again and a line from Marktbreit via Uffenheim to Bad Windsheim. The Steigerwald covers the territories of six counties: Bamberg, Erlangen- H√∂chstadt, Ha√überge, Kitzingen, Neustadt an der Aisch-Bad Windsheim, and Schweinfurt. = Natural regions = The Steigerwald is divided into these natural regions:Emil Meynen, Josef Schmith√ºsen: Handbook of the Natural Region Divisions of Germany.

They do not usually flow directly into the River Main in the northeast, but empty either into the Regnitz in the east or its tributary, the Aisch, which flanks the Steigerwald in the southeast and forms a natural dividing line with the heights of the Franconian Heights. These rivers and streams rise in the Steigerwald and flow in an easterly direction (arranged north to south): * Aurach (into the Regnitz) * Rauhe Ebrach (into the Regnitz) * Mittelebrach (into the Rauhen Ebrach) * Reiche Ebrach (into the Regnitz) * Kleine Weisach (into the Aisch) * Weisach (into the Aisch) * Steinach (into the Aisch) * Laimbach (into the Ehebach) ** Scheine (left-hand headstream) ** Bibart (right-hand headstream) * Ehebach (into the Aisch)  Transport  The main transport arteries passing by the Steigerwald are the A 70 in the north, the A 7 in the west, and the A 73 in the east. Crossing the hills and nature park is the A 3, the main road link between Frankfurt, Wurzburg, and Nuremberg, and the federal roads of the B 22, B 286, and B 8. A tourist route, the Steigerwald High Road (Steigerwald-H√∂henstra√üe), crosses the Steigerwald in a north-south direction.  Viticulture  Wine connoisseurs know the Steigerwald from its Franconian wines, which are grown in the west of the region. Well-known names include Abtswinder Altenberg, Casteller Bausch, Handthaler Stollberg, Ippesheimer Herrschaftsberg, Bullenheimer Paradies, Wiesenbronner Wachh√ºgel, and Ziegelangerer √ñlschnabel.  Nature conservation  = Nature park and nature reserves = The Naturwaldreservat Brunnstube Nature Reserve within the Nature Park, in the unincorporated area of Ebracher Forst Large parts of the Steigerwald have been designated since 1988 as the Steigerwald Nature Park.

Since 2008, controversy has existed over whether certain areas should become a national park or not. Proponents see this contributing to conservation and increasing tourism. Opponents fear that the designated areas would no longer be used for forestry. Since 15 January 2015, the Steigerwald clearly can no longer be a UNESCO World Heritage Site because the UNESCO nomination process has finished. At a meeting in the Bavarian Parliament with Prime Minister Horst Seehofer, the Bavarian Environment Minister Ulrike Scharf, Forestry Minister Helmut Brunner, and the three county councillors of the Schweinfurt (Florian T√∂pper), Ha√überge (Wilhelm Schneider), and Bamberg (Johann Kalb), this was not yet known. The result then was that a working group of representatives of the two ministries and the three county councils would establish the foundations for an application for World Heritage status by the end of January 2015. According to T√∂pper, a prerequisite was unity between the parties that no national park should be in the Steigerwald. Seehofer was to ensure that, by the end of January 2014, a measure adopted by the Bamberg council for a controversial, 775-hectare forest reserve in the Ebrach Forest was withdrawn. Authority for the disputed protected area was withdrawn in September 2015 because it was determined to be illegal. This 'illegality' was confirmed by the government of Upper Franconia. As a result, on 1 September 2015, the regulation was lifted. According to the legal view of the Government of Upper Franconia, the \\"regulation by the Bamberg Council for the protected landscape of 'the high beech woods in the Ebrach Forest' dated 16 April 2014 was illegal because the regulation was not covered by the enabling provision of ¬ß 29 BNatSchG.\\" The Upper Franconian government also recorded, \\" the High Beech Wood is not a suitable object of protection for a protected landscape area\\". It is, according to the government \\"not an object that stands out from the landscape, as the law requires it to be. Therefore, the regulation is to be rescinded for legal reasons and also in the interests of legal clarity and legal certainly.\\"  References  Height based on unknown or unverified source  External links  *Tourist-Information Steigerwald Regions of Bavaria Forests and woodlands of Bavaria Bamberg (district) Neustadt (Aisch)-Bad Windsheim Erlangen-H√∂chstadt Ha√überge (district) Kitzingen (district) Schweinfurt (district) Natural regions of the South German Scarplands Franconia ","title":"Steigerwald"},{"id":"30178910","title":"1989 Orange Bowl"},{"id":"30178933","text":"The Strauss Family is a 1972 English Associated Television series of eight episodes,Acorn DVD sleeve notes about the family of composers of that name, including Johann Strauss I and his sons Johann Strauss II, Eduard Strauss and Josef Strauss.

A ferry tank allows the range or endurance of the vehicle or aircraft to be extended. Ferry tanks are typically used in both civil and military aviation; civil aviation and transport aircraft tend to use internal tanks while combat aircraft will use external tanks. In aviation, ferry tanks allow aircraft additional range to reach destinations beyond the aircraft's specified range when there are no available re-fueling stopover locations. For example, for an aircraft with only 1,000 miles range to be delivered from North America to Hawaii, which is over 2,000 miles away, that aircraft will require a ferry tank to supply it with enough fuel to travel the excess miles.  History  The first Ferry Tanks were drop tanks that fit externally on the aircraft and were used primarily by the military, allowing combat aircraft to both travel longer distances and remain in combat longer, giving advantages to air forces that utilized them on their planes. But they also made the planes vulnerable to small arms fire. Ferry tanks for civilian uses were developed and companies like Aluminum Tank Industries and Sky aviation began offering tanks that were aluminum based and had to be fit and installed into the aircraft.  Design  Aluminum ferry tanks not only took up valuable cargo space and damaged the aircraft but made the aircraft susceptible to fire due to fume build-up within the tank. = Collapsible Ferry Tank = Turtle-Pac collapsible ferry tank In 1991 Turtle-Pac came up with a solution to this problem with the development of a collapsible Ferry Tank. Unlike aluminum tanks, the collapsible tank is made of a soft structure that can alter shape under high ‚ÄúG‚Äù loads, which increases its puncture and burn resistance. Furthermore, the tanks self-wedge into the fuselage and is gripped by friction. This reduces the load on the tie point considerably. = External tanks = Military forces often utilize external ferry tanks, allowing aircraft to travel greater distance or remain in combat longer. For example, external ferry tanks made possible the Israeli Air Force raid on the Osirak nuclear reactor known as Operation Opera. The external tanks refill the main tank as it is depleted. Empty external tanks may be dumped in flight, known as drop tanks, or may be retained. = Internal tanks = Most civilian aircraft utilize internal tanks. Depending on the design or specification of the tanks they might replace room intended for passenger seating or cargo and the fuel might either drain or be attached to the main tank by a transfer pump.

Military career Later that year he received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, which he entered in July 1943 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army Air Corps and received a bachelor of science degree in military engineering in June 1946. He next entered fighter transition training at Williams Field and gunnery school at Ajo, Arizona. His first tactical assignment was with the 20th Fighter Group at Shaw Field, South Carolina in November 1946. In June 1948, he was transferred to the 475th Tactical Fighter Group at Itazuke Air Base, Japan. At the start of the Korean War in June 1950, he flew P-51 Mustang aircraft with the 35th Fighter-Interceptor Group from Tsuiki Air Field, and Taegu Air Base. Later that year, he was transferred to Headquarters Fifth Air Force at Taegu, where he continued to fly intelligence missions for the headquarters. Before returning to the United States in 1951, he completed approximately 130 combat missions in the P-51, P-80 Shooting Star, T-6 Texan and L-5 Sentinel aircraft. From September 1951 to March 1952, he was assigned to the Air Research and Development Command, Baltimore, Maryland. In April 1952, he was transferred to the 479th Tactical Fighter Wing at George Air Force Base, California, where he commanded the 434th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, equipped with F-51 Mustang and later F-86 Sabre aircraft. In April 1954, he returned to the Far East as executive officer to the commander, Far East Air Forces. In July 1955, he was assigned to Headquarters Air Defense Command, and in July 1956 he returned to George Air Force Base to command the 436th Fighter-Day Squadron, equipped with F-100 Super Sabre aircraft. In 1958, he became director of operations for the 479th Tactical Fighter Wing and was responsible for the conversion of the wing to F-104 Starfighter aircraft. In August 1959, he entered the Army War College in Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania., and after graduation in June 1960 was assigned to the Armed Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Virginia, where he served on the faculty until June 1964. General Evans next was transferred to Wheelus Air Base, Libya, and served as deputy for operations and later as vice commander of the 7272d Flying Training Wing, the weapons training center for the United States Air Forces in Europe. He volunteered for Southeast Asia duty in 1966 and was transferred to the Republic of Vietnam in May 1967 as vice commander, and later was commander of the 31st Tactical Fighter Wing at Tuy Hoa Air Base. Before returning to the United States in May 1968, he completed 278 combat missions in the F-100 Super Sabre aircraft. In June 1968, Evans was assigned as assistant deputy director for concepts and operational readiness, Defense Communications Planning Group, Washington, D.C., and in June 1969 he assumed duties as the deputy director. In February 1970, General Evans was assigned to Headquarters United States Air Force, Washington D.C., as special assistant for sensor exploitation, a newly created office. He was transferred in April 1971 to the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, Research and Development, as director of operational requirements and development plans, and in September 1971 he became director of development and acquisitions. In April 1972, Evans became assistant deputy chief of staff, research and development, and in August 1973 he was appointed deputy chief of staff, research and development. General Evans became commander of the Air Force Systems Command, Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, in August 1975. He assumed his present duties as commander, Allied Air Forces Central Europe and commander in chief, United States Air Forces in Europe on July 29, 1977. He is a command pilot with more than 6,200 flying hours to his credit, the majority of which are in fighter aircraft, including the P-51 Mustang, P-82 Twin Mustang, P-80 Shooting Star, F-84 Thunderjet, F-86 Sabre, F-100 Super Sabre, F-102 Delta Dagger, F-104 Starfighter, F-4 Phantom, F-5 Freedom Fighter, F-111 Aardvark, A-7 Corsair II, F-14 Tomcat, and F-15 Eagle, CF-100 Canuck, Harrier Jump Jet, de Havilland Vampire, Gloster Meteor, Dassault Mirage F1, Saab 37 Viggen. He has also flown the B-1 Lancer, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, the T-43 Bobcat, the YC-14 and the YC-15. He was promoted to the grade of general September 1, 1975, with date of rank August 30, 1975.

It has evolved over the two thousand years of the Christian religion, partly by innovation and partly by imitating other architectural styles as well as responding to changing beliefs, practices and local traditions. Christian architecture encompasses a wide range of both secular and religious styles from the foundation of Christianity to the present day, influencing the design and construction of buildings and structures in Christian culture. From the birth of Christianity to the present, the most significant period of transformation for Christian architecture and design was the Gothic cathedral. The Saxon and Norman periods Roof and Towers of Durham Cathedral (1093-1135) In England, Saxon churches still survive in some places, the oldest example being the Church of St Peter-on-the-Wall, Bradwell-on-Sea. But with the Norman conquest, increasingly the new Romanesque churches, often called Norman in England, became the rule. These were massive in relation to the space they enclosed, their walls pierced by windows with semi-circular arches. Internal vaulting used the same shaped arch. Unsupported roofs were never very wide. Yet some of these buildings were huge and of extraordinary beauty. The Abbey church of St. Mary Madgalene at V√©zelay in Burgundy and Durham Cathedral in England are two very different examples of this form. The Middle Ages The next development was due to the mobility of the master masons whose work this was. They followed the Crusades and built their own churches in the Holy Land, most notably the Church of St. Anne in Jerusalem. However, they also noticed that the local Muslim architecture deployed the much more flexible two-point or Gothic arch. The semi-circular arch was heavy and, in spite of this, resulted in weaknesses when two barrel vaults intersected. The 'gothic arch' on the other hand was stronger and could be used to make for wider unsupported spaces. Salisbury Cathedral completed 1265 Thus there came to Europe, first the narrow, lancet window, often found in pairs or triplets, called in England the Early English style (here seen at Salisbury cathedral). Examples of parish churches include Eaton Bray in Bedfordshire and West Walton in Norfolk; it is most commonly found in the south eastern counties. The style was spare, simple and monastic in character with little carving The period is reckoned by Pevsner to run from about 1190 to 1250. In spite of its name the style was at one time called the French style and it is to be found all over the British Isles. By the late thirteenth century, more daringly ornate styles of tracery were tried ‚Äì the so-called Decorated, dating from 1290‚Äì1350. Initially geometric, using circles as well as the two point arch, it derived from the French Rayonnant style. However, it slowly became more daring and flowing; the name curvilinear has been ascribed to it. Windows became larger, increasing the number of mullions (the vertical bars dividing the main part of the window) between the lights; above them, within the arch of the window, the tracery was formed using shapes styled 'daggers' and 'mouchettes', trefoils and quadrifoils; completely circular rose windows were made, incorporating all manner of shapes. More formal reticulated (netlike) tracery can also be found, as in Wells Cathedral. Exotic forms included the ogee arch, in which the curves of the arch are reversed in the upper part thus meeting at an acute angle at the apex; others included so-called Kentish tracery with its insertion of spikey points between the rounded lobes of trefoils and quatrefoils. Larger windows inevitably weakened the walls which were now supported by large exterior buttresses which came to be a feature. Columns forming the arcades within churches of this period became more slender and elegant, the foliage of the capitals more flowing. Examples of the earlier form include the choir and chapter house of Westminster Abbey and the north transept of Hereford Cathedral; later forms include the nave of York Minster. The octagon at Ely, a timber framed lantern tower over the crossing, demonstrates the adventurousness of the developed style. But it can be seen in parish churches from Snettisham and Aylsham in Norfolk to Beverly in Yorkshire and Madley in Herefordshire. There were undoubtedly many more examples but many were replaced by later developments. Ornate two-storey \\"Perpendicular\\"-style south porch of 1480 at Northleach, Gloucestershire Finally, the Perpendicular style (so-called because the mullions and transoms were vertical and horizontal) allowed huge windows, often filled with stained glass. The style, so described runs from about 1330, initially in parallel with the Decorated style, until 1530. Sometimes criticised as over formal, the spaces allowing for glass were huge. Another feature was that doorways were often enclosed by squared mouldings and the spaces between the moulding and the door arch ‚Äì called spandrels were decorated with quadrifoils etc. Ornate stone ceilings, using so-called fan vaulting, made for huge unsupported spaces. King's College Chapel, Cambridge has magnificent specimens of these. Meanwhile, the Lady Chapel of Ely Cathedral has an unsupported stone ceiling approximately 30 feet by 80 feet, using a star formation of lierne vaults and bosses. Fan Vaulting (1512-1515), King's College Chapel, Cambridge The late mediaeval period saw an unequalled development in church architecture in England. Walls became thinner; solid buttresses became more elegant flying buttresses surmounted by pinnacles; towers, often surmounted by stone spires became taller, and more decorated, often castellated; internal pillars became more slender; unsupported spaces between them wider; roofs, formerly safely steeply pitched became flatter, often decorated with carved wooden angels and a bestiary, where they were steep they were supported by carved hammer beams; windows occupied more and more of the wall space; decorative carving more freely flowing; figures multiplied, particularly on the west fronts of cathedrals and abbeys. Finally with the cessation of the wars with the French and the apparent ending of the Wars of the Roses with the return of Edward IV in 1471, there was more money around so that new buildings could be put up and existing buildings enlarged. \\"Hardly had such towers risen on all sides; never had such timber roofs and screens been hewn and carved...\\" (Harvey) This is the period of the building of wool Churches like Long Melford and Lavenham and of King's College Chapel in Cambridge. The interiors of mediaeval churches, apart from their many altars and stained glass (which, of course can only be properly seen from inside) had their purpose made visually plain by the almost universal presence of roods, huge figures of the crucified Christ, high above the congregation, mounted on a rood loft at the chancel arch -with steps to enable the priest to climb up; something which no one could miss. A wooden rood screen beneath might have painted on it figures of the apostles and angels. The Protestant Reformation With the reign of Henry VIII all of this was to be first put in question and then to come to a shuddering halt. On his death, and the accession of Edward VI almost all of the internal decoration was to be destroyed. The chantries and guilds which supported them became illegal or their functions taken from them. Images were removed, Saints' days massively reduced. The Churches echoed to the sound of hammer blows as stone altars and images were smashed, glass broken, font covers and roods and their screens torn down and burnt. Those who had formerly been benefactors were more wary, given the changes of direction of governmental policy which was to last more than 150 years. They spent their money on great houses instead. The auditory church Interior of Wren Church: St Mary-Le- Bow (1671-1673), London In the seventeenth century, across Western Europe, a return was seen towards the single room church in which everything could be seen. In Protestant countries these were somewhat simple and, among the finest examples, from an architectural point of view were the churches of Sir Christopher Wren. This was a one-room design in which altar and pulpit were both visible. Churches were to be sufficiently small, including galleries, so that all could see what was taking place. Chancels were suppressed, screens were deemed unnecessary obstructions. Buildings had three defined centres: the font ‚Äì by the door, the pulpit and reading desk, and the altar. Within Lutheranism similar principles obtained. The Prinzipalst√ºck ideal was of an oblong building without a chancel with a single space at the east end combining all liturgical acts: baptism, service of the word and communion. These ideas, with variations, were to affect the building of nonconformist chapels in seventeenth century England. Galleries increased the capacity without increasing the distance between worshipper and preacher. The Royal Arms ‚Äì a distinctive feature in English churches Two notable heraldic features started appearing in English churches during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. One of these was the funerary hatchment, which was basically a coat of arms displayed on either a black or a black and white lozenge, and commemorated a notable local person. Retrieved 20 November 2015. The other was a representation of the Royal Arms, a feature of Anglican churches, representing the monarch's role as head of the Church of England. The arms has been made in several different forms. It has been done as a painting, as an embroidery, or as a relief made out of wood, stone or iron. Retrieved 9 January 2016. The usage of the Royal Arms in English churches originated in the mediaeval period, in places associated with the English monarchy. A classic surviving example is the arms of Henry VI in King's College Chapel, Cambridge. After the Reformation, it became customary to display the Royal Arms as a symbol of the sovereign's role as Head of the Church. The arms was traditionally positioned above the altar, as a replacement for the rood screen. Over time, however, churches would have the arms located wherever the parishioners would deem appropriate ‚Äì over the chancel arch, on a side wall, or over the west door. Mary I, as a Roman Catholic, ordered the Royal Arms to be removed from churches and kept hidden away, but the features were brought back and improved under her successor, Elizabeth I. Oliver Cromwell was the only other ruler who discouraged the use of the Royal Arms. The usage of the Royal Arms in English churches started to decline in the 1830s, owing to the Victorian fashion for \\"Christianisation\\", and as a consequence, few English churches built from Victorian times onwards use the arms.

Gothic revival styles became popular and as urban populations grew, major neo-Gothic churches were built to accommodate them. The passing of the Catholic Relief Act allowed the construction of new churches for England's Roman Catholics, and these were also done in the neo-Gothic style. Finally, this style, in a modified form, was also used for the design of Methodist and other Nonconformist churches, which were also increasing in number during this time. The usage of tracery, buttresses with carved pinnacles, tiled roofs and glazing formed one feature of church architecture in the Victorian era, while a deep chancel, with an arch and crucifix, formed another. Although this was not unusual for Roman Catholic churches, it seemed alien to the Church of England, but was nevertheless adopted. Retrieved 14 January 2016. All Saints Margaret Street, London During this time, individual architects began to make their influence felt on the churches they built in England. One of the earliest was Augustus Pugin, who designed Roman Catholic churches; however, few of his works are appreciated today except for St Giles' Church at Cheadle in Staffordshire. Architects of the mid-Victorian era who brought the Gothic style to perfection, both in church interiors and church exteriors, included William Butterfield and George Gilbert Scott. Two notable churches by the respective architects are the church of All Saints, Margaret Street in London and All Souls Church in Halifax, West Yorkshire. The later Victorian era saw the influence of the Arts and Crafts movement, and the churches of this period returned to the less flamboyant styles of the early nineteenth century. The finest churches were often funded by private individuals. Notable architects of this time included George Frederick Bodley, whose most distinguished design is St Mary's Church at Eccleston in Cheshire, and Richard Norman Shaw, whose masterpiece is the Church of St Michael and All Angels in Bedford Park, London. Retrieved 15 January 2016. 20th Century New cathedrals were built in the second half of the 20th century including Liverpool Metropolitan (pictured), Coventry and Clifton. New churches continued to be built in the 20th century in the modernist and later Brutalist styles. Two main drivers were the reconstruction or replacement of churches bombed in World War II, and the New Towns movement. Notable C20 church architects include Giles Gilbert Scott, Basil Spence, Nugent Cachemaille-Day, Robert Maguire & Keith Murray and Brett, Boyd and Bosanquet.

The region of shared similarity, known as the Runt domain, is responsible for DNA-binding and protein-protein interaction. In addition to the highly conserved Runt domain, the AML-1 gene product carries a putative ATP-binding site (GRSGRGKS), and has a C-terminal region rich in proline and serine residues.
