Location The power station would be located across the Nyagak River, in Rateng Village, Paidha Sub County, Okoro County, Zombo District, West Nile Sub-Region, Northern Region of Uganda. This location is near the town of Paidha, close to the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), approximately downstream of the existing Nyagak I Power Station. Overview During the construction of the Nyagak I Power Station (2006 - 2012), it became clear that its 3.5 megawatt output was inadequate to meet the electricity needs of the West Nile sub-region. In addition, the towns of Aruu and Mahagi in the DRC had expressed the desire to be supplied with electricity from neighboring Uganda. To meet those needs while awaiting the construction of the 600 megawatt Karuma Power Station, the government of Uganda authorized construction of the Nyagak II Power Station as a bridge measure. The available literature suggests that the government will fund this development independently. It appears that this power station is separate from the Nyagak III Power Station, which will be developed through a Public Private Partnership. Construction costs While the exact construction costs of the Nyagak II Power Station have not been disclosed, the Nyagak I Power Station cost US$18 million (€14 million) to complete in 2012. The power generated will be evacuated via the existing 33 kilovolt transmission power lines linking the towns of Paidha, Nebbi, Bondo, Okollo, and Arua, constructed at an estimated cost of US$15 million between 2006 and 2012 during the development of Nyagak I. The power lines will also be extended to Pakwach on the banks of the Albert Nile, with funding from a US$18 million (€13 million) grant from KfW.

It claimed to have 2,000 members across Scotland in June 2014. The organisation has been described as an \\"SNP front\\" and, following the September 2014 independence referendum, its founder Allan Grogan joined the Scottish Socialist Party.  Ideology  Labour for Independence adheres to Labour's \\"founding principles [...] of fairness, equality and justice\\" and seeks to offer a vision of an independent Scotland for Labour supporters, in lieu of Scottish Labour doing so. An opinion poll in March 2014, suggested that almost a quarter of Labour voters were planning to vote \\"Yes\\" in the referendumReferendum: New poll puts support for independence at highest level this year.. but Alex Salmond still facing huge task to win vote www.dailyrecord.co.uk, accessed 30 March 2014 The appeal of Labour for Independence has been attributed to frustration and disappointment felt by Labour voters in Scotland during the New Labour era of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. The decision of the Labour Party to abstain from the vote on the Jobseekers (Back to Work Schemes) Act 2013 on 19 March 2013 also aroused anger from many mainstream Labour supporters. Polling has also suggested that up to 20% of Scottish Labour supporters were dissatisfied with the party's Holyrood leader, Johann Lamont. Former Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer and MP Alistair Darling, who led the pro-Union Better Together campaign, also had a dissatisfaction rate of 27%.http://www.ipsos- mori.com/Assets/Docs/Scotland/SPOMFeb13/Scotland_SPOMFeb13_charts_130213.pdf  Organisation  Labour for Independence is now organised in 6 regional units:Join the campaign and become a volunteer! www.labourforindy.com, 1 August 2013 *Aberdeenshire & Highlands (incl. Western and Northern Isles) *Dundee & East *Edinburgh, Lothians & Central *Glasgow & West *Southern Scotland *Fife  History  = Formation = Labour for Independence was established in 2012 by Allan Grogan, a dissatisfied Scottish Labour member from Angus. It initially consisted of a website and a Facebook group. Grogan wrote on his website: \\"We need to show the Labour Party, the rest of the political parties and the media watching, that there is a genuine demand from Labour voters for independence\\". While the head of the Yes Scotland campaign welcomed the creation of a pro-independence group within the Labour Party, it was reported that Labour chiefs believed there was little support within party ranks for independence. The group held its first public conference at Glasgow Caledonian University on 12 November 2012, in a meeting attended by around 100 party members, activists and supporters and was subject to mass media coverage in the printed press all over Scotland over the following days. Speakers at the event included former Labour MP, Dennis Canavan, Yes Scotland Chief Executive Blair Jenkins, Jeane Freeman from Women for Independence, Ravenscraig trade union leader Tommy Brennan, and Ricky Ross from Deacon Blue. The shift from being an e-campaign group to being an active \\"feet-on-the- ground\\" movement was widely seen as the next step forward and warmly received. = 2013 policy conference = The group hosted a two-day policy conference in July 2013, which sought to suggest possible policies for a post-independence Scottish Labour Party. The conference was open to paid members only, who must be either existing members of the Labour Party or members of no party whatsoever. It is expected to have hosted 100 people. Policies adopted at the conference include complete opposition to the Trident nuclear weapons programme. = Later activity = Allan Grogan spoke at the March and Rally for Scottish Independence in September 2013, at which a contingent of Labour for Independence supporters reportedly waved \\"red flags with a thistle in the upper hoist quarter\\". After the referendum results were announced, Grogan left the Labour Party and stood down as LFI's co-convenor.  Controversy  In July 2013, Labour for Independence was branded as an \\"SNP front\\" by Anas Sarwar, deputy leader of Scottish Labour, who said that SNP politicians and supporters were \\"masquerading\\" as Labour supporters and giving a false impression about the campaign, though LFI founder Allan Grogan responded by stating: \\"There are many instances in which non-LFI volunteers were pictured around our banner. At no time have we ever claimed these people to be volunteers of LFI.\\" In August 2013, the Sunday Herald reported that Celia Fitzgerald, an office-bearer within the group, had been an SNP activist since leaving Labour over the Iraq War. She rejoined Labour in 2012 with the aim of changing the party's stance towards the referendum. LFI leader Allan Grogan said he knew of examples of SNP members handing out LFI leaflets. He admitted only 40% of his group's 80 or so members are actually in the Labour Party. Grogan also said LFI had received initial financial support from Yes Scotland, regarding the £245 accommodation bill for the LFI's first conference. Later in the month, the group's founder accused Better Together of running a \\"dirty tricks\\" campaign and \\"witch hunt\\" to discredit his group, the executive of which is made up entirely of card-carrying Labour members. An editorial by the International Socialist Group likened Scottish Labour's criticism of the group to \\"a popular child's tantrum\\" while describing Labour for Independence as \\"novel, creative, and engaging [...] proponents of a new Scotland\\". In September 2015 the group was fined £1500 by the Electoral Commission after the group failed to submit a spending report for activity during the Scottish Referendum. The Commission considered this a serious breach of the rules for campaigners and warned that the fine would rise by 50% if Labour for Independence failed to pay it within 56 days, and then possible court action could follow. A previous breach of commission rules were cited for the action where the group failed to put an imprint on campaign leaflets. The organisation was the only referendum campaigner that had failed to do submit accounts.

A large-scale conceptual project and social sculpture, the world scent comprises the most culturally significant scents of 225 countries combined proportionally according to the statistical population data of the year 2000. World Sensorium has been recognized by UNESCO and the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities as a global peace project and has been internationally exhibited in large public events, museums and galleries since its creation in 1999. The research for the creation of World Sensorium established smells from natural flora that triggered olfactory memory for the majority of people of each nation, with the goal of interpreting the relationship between world flora and human numbers on earth, and to bring new awareness of the living world and its influence on the human spirit and psyche. Through this work, Nalls has sought to foster an understanding of the larger evolutionary social construct of knowledge we share with others via the senses. The project of World Sensorium can be categorized as a contribution to the genres of Olfactory Art and Aesthetics, Participatory art, and environmental art and functions along the trajectories of avant-garde and political or activist art. Creative Inspiration =Berlin Wall= Nalls envisioned this concept for a “world scent” in 1989, eleven years prior to its completion and debut release. She describes the moment of inspiration for the formula as having occurred on December 28 of that year at the Brandenberg Gate, as the crowd pulled her on top of the Berlin Wall. As the connectivity passed through the bodies gathered, she envisioned a formula for World Sensorium where everyone would be counted. =Relationship to Permutatude Theory= World Sensorium was created for the aesthetic of mass anatomy to evoke global memory and to evolve a metabolic collective. Permutatude Theory and science form a significant background to the ongoing project, as do the processes of cultural transformation and globalization. As a theoretical construct, conceived to be an embodied consciousness of “one world” the olfactory sculpture critically engages individuals with their sense of smell, often in performative settings. Methodology =Determination of ingredients= Historical scents of all the countries of the world, culturally significant in medicine, mythology, the arts, anthropology, spiritual practices, diet and memory were identified based on survey research to obtain quantitative information that supplied the raw data for the creation of the scent, establishing the constituent natural plant oils “from tree, flower, grass or herb”.G. Nalls, inscription on Times Square World Sensorium Papperworks, 1999. Many of the plants were identified in local vernacular and required additional research to verify the Latin or English names. In some instances an English name did not exist. “Nalls located botanical taxonomy scholars from the New York Botanical Garden and ethno-botanists from the National Tropical Botanical Garden in Hawaii to assist in properly identifying the botanical names”Kyle, Lorraine, World Sensorium: A Global Bouquet Attuning the Unity of All Cultures through Scent,” NAHA Quarterly JJournal, Winter (2000)\\" materials which had been referred to in colloquial terms such as, Senegal: Gowe (Cyperus articulatus), no English name, and American Samoa: Mos’oi (Cananga odorata), English name Ylang-ylang. “The goal was to have to have each flora’s complex molecular compositions represented in its entirety so as to be perceived by humans as closely as it would if it were experienced in its habitat, in order to evoke the same psychological ad emotional responses, and neurological and immune functions as in the traditions of the culture.”(G. Nalls, \\"World Sensorium: Theory Practice and Significance of The World Social Olfactory Sculpture, (dissertation), SmartLab, UEL, (September 2007) p.30) To this end all raw materials were derived straight from botanical sources by means of distillation or extraction. =Formula= The composition of these ingredients was based on projected population percentages for each individual country for the year 2000. Everyone was counted. Impact as World Peace Project =Global communications= In her quantitative research, Nalls crossed political boundaries in dialog with “countries the United States doesn’t get along with, such as Iran (rose), Iraq (date palm) Libya (orange blossom) and Cuba (tobacco).”Rita Giordano, “Artist to Unleash Global Scent of Peace Over Times Square,” The Denver Post, Denver, CO, December 29, 1999. In some cases, communications spanned several months, but an especially “poignant moment in the creation of World Sensorium was the day the representative from the Israeli Embassy in Washington and the Palestinian representative from the united Nations called Nalls by phone within minutes of each other to report that their national choices were both the Olive tree because of its long revered association with peace.”Kyle, Lorraine, World Sensorium: A Global Bouquet Attuning the Unity of All Cultures through Scent,” NAHA Quarterly JJournal, Winter (2000)\\" =Recognition and Honors= In 1998, in recognition of Nalls’ outstanding creative achievement, World Sensorium was endorsed by the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities and was granted sponsorship by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as an original cultural initiative building goodwill and peace in conjunction with the United Nation's International Year for Culture of Peace. In his letter to Nalls, Director-General, Dr. Federico Mayor, a brain biochemist, said that World Sensorium is a “highly original cultural initiative” that “will certainly contribute to creating a climate of goodwill and peace at this memorable moment in time” leading to “understanding and collaboration among nations”.As stated in letter to Nalls, September 5, 1998. Cultural Significance =Olfactory Art and Aesthetics= With World Sensorium and more recent works, Nalls has advanced concepts of aesthetics to consider the olfactory sense over the historically privileged sense of vision. While the visual remains dominant, artists have and are now increasingly working with the sense of smell to produce emotionally and phenomenologically resonant works in the emergent genre of Olfactory Art. Nalls “like many other olfactory artists, uses only natural fragrances and essential oils. “I call it ‘rewilding the mind,’” she says. =Participatory Art= For Nalls, the connection between olfaction and social or participatory art is rooted in the evolutionary biology of the sense of smell. As the oldest sense, olfaction has the uncanny ability to trigger memory (individual and collective), and its significant role in chemosensory communication is critical to the collective action that is necessary for participatory social and art processes. World Sensorium is a participatory project in its all-inclusive ethos, Nalls’ intention for its en masse experience, and in its very creation which at times required to assistance of volunteers to gather the phytogenic materials. “Randia aculeata an ingredient from the Netherlands Antilles, could only be found locally in Florida. A team was rushed to the site before Hurricane Lenny came in and swept through the area.” to harvest the leaves.Laura Klepacki, “Times Square Revelers To Ring in New Fragrance,” Women’s Wear Daily, December 23, 1999. =Avant-gardism and Political Art= In its use of extant culturally significant plant materials, Nalls advances the advant-garde notion that art should be brought closer to the praxis of life. World Sensorium is all-inclusive in its conception–a reflection of actual human-plant relations, making every experience of World Sensorium a connection to the world's collective ecology and human consciousness. When experienced en masse as in Times Square, Nalls initiated a collective metabolic experience, and introduced a universal language for cross-cultural efforts toward peace, by evoking our co-evolution with nature. Ken Johnson called World Sensorium a \\"utopian project\\" and \\"an olfactory metaphor for world unity\\" by an \\"earnest and rather grandiose conceptualist\\".Johnson, Ken, Art in Review, New York Times, January 21, 2000.

The triple-coupled engines were classified as T 7 locomotives in 1910. In 1911 they were transferred to the Neubukow Beet Railway.  History  The Class XVIII locomotives were soon unable to cope with the increase in traffic. As a result, a triple-coupled engine was ordered from Krauss in Munich. The locomotive was given the number 1003 by the Mecklenburg State Railway and was incorporated into Class XIX. In 1898 another locomotive, number 1004, followed. In 1910 the line was extended as far as Arendsee. To handle the higher levels of traffic, three similar engines were ordered from Henschel. With the introduction into service of these locomotives, that were grouped into Class T 7, the two Krauss locomotives were given to the Neubukow Beet Railway. The engines were still listed in the first Deutsche Reichsbahn renumbering plan in 1923, but they were retired by 1924.  Design features  The locomotives had an inside frame which was built as a water tank. The boiler comprised two shell rings. The steam dome with its safety valve sat on the forward shell ring. The smokebox was very short. The smokestack has a Kobel spark arrestor. Later a Prüsmann chimney was used. The horizontally arranged two-cylinder, wet steam drive acted on the rearmost coupled axle. The Stephenson valve gear with crossed eccentric rods was also on the outside. The two front coupled axles had leaf spring blocks at the height of the running plate. These were linked by equalising beams. The rear axle was sprung with a transverse leaf spring stack. The hand brake acted on the two outside wheel sets from the outside. Later the locomotives were given Knorr air brakes. The sanding gear sat on the middle of the boiler and sanded the outer sets of wheels from the outside. To begin with the running gear was covered. The locomotives also had steam heating, a steam bell and a De Limon centralized lubricating system.

These took place in Christopher Street, Greenwich Village (New York, USA.) The first CSD in Berlin took place on June 30, 1979 and since then has taken place every year. In 2012 around 700.000 people attended the CSD Parade, and 500.000 people were present at the Finale at the Brandenburg Gate, making it into one of the largest events in Berlin as well as one of the largest Pride Events in the world.  CSD Berlin Events  CSD Berlin comprises several events, taking place within the framework of the month-long Pride Festival, usually starting at the end of May. Pride Week is the final week of the festival, ending with the CSD Parade. The CSD Gala has been taking place since 2011, and is organised in co- operation with the Friedrichstadt Show Palace. In the same month both Kreuzberg Pride and Gay Night at the Zoo are held. More gay festivals in Berlin are Folsom Europe and Easter in Berlin.  Organization  All CSD events are organised by the Berliner CSD e.V. (Berlin LGBT Pride Association). The organization was formed at the end of 1999. The association was meant to relieve the three previous coordinators: the “Sonntags-Club”, “LSVD” and “Mann-o-Meter”, who had been organizing the “CSD Berlin” from 1994 to 1999. Each year, the theme, motto and political demands of the CSD Parade are determined in so-called Pride Forums. These are open meetings that can be attended by anyone.

His family moved to South Bend, Indiana, in 1928, where he attended public schools. He graduated with honors from the University of Notre Dame in 1938, receiving his degree in English. He was briefly a teacher and a school administrator prior to World War II. While at Notre Dame Scott joined the Marine Corps Reserve, and received a commission as a second lieutenant. He was called to active duty prior to the outbreak of the war. He served with the 3rd Marine Division and saw action during the Bougainville and Guam campaigns. He received the Silver Star, Bronze Star with valor clasp, and the Purple Heart. Scott was called to active duty during the Korean War, serving in Washington, D.C., as a public relations officer. He retired from the Marine Reserves with the rank of brigadier general in 1959. Following his service in the Korean War, Scott was elected mayor of South Bend. He served from 1952 to 1956. Scott began his journalism career with the South Bend Tribune. He joined Federated Publications and published their newspapers in Lafayette, Indiana; Boise, Idaho; and Olympia and Bellingham, Washington. When Federated Publications merged with the Gannett Company, Scott was named publisher of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin and president of Gannett Pacific. After four years Scott was named president of the Gannett Foundation (now known as The Freedom Forum), which at the time was ranked one of the largest foundations in the country. Scott was a prolific speaker, delivering lectures on more than fifty campuses and 100 cities nationwide. He also wrote extensively for papers and magazines. In 1983 he was inducted into the Indiana Journalism Hall of Fame. Scott died on October 1, 1986, at his home in Cocoa Beach, Florida.

Specific types of kleptons are zygokleptons, which reproduce by zygogenesis; gynokleptons which reproduce by gynogenesis, and tychokleptons, which reproduce by a combination of both systems. The term is derived from the Greek, kleptein, \\"to steal\\". Kleptogenic reproduction results in three potential outcomes. A unisexual female may simply activate cell division in the egg through the presence of a male's sperm without incorporating any of his genetic material—this results in the production of clonal offspring. The female may also incorporate the male's sperm into her egg, but can do so without excising any of her genetic material. This results in increased ploidy levels that range from triploid to pentaploid in wild individuals. Finally, the female also has the option of replacing some of her genetic material with that of the male's, resulting in a \\"hybrid\\" of sorts without increasing ploidy. Example In the wild, five species of Ambystoma salamanders contribute to a unisexual complex that reproduces via a combination of gynogenesis and kleptogenesis: A. tigrinum, A. barbouri, A. texanum, A. jeffersonium, and A. laterale. Over twenty genomic combinations have been found in nature, ranging from \\"LLJ\\" individuals (two A. laterale and an A. jeffersonium genome) to \\"LJTi\\" individuals (an A. laterale, A. jeffersonium, and an A. tigrinum genome). Every combination, however, contains the genetic information from the A. laterale species, and analysis of mitochondrial DNA has indicated that these unisexual species most likely diverged from an A. barbouri individual some 5 million years ago, making them the oldest unisexual vertebrate species on Earth The fact that these salamanders have persisted for so long is remarkable, as it contradicts the notion that a majority of asexual lineages arise when the conditions are right and quickly disappear. It has been argued that this persistence is very much due to the aforementioned \\"genome replacement\\" strategy that accompanies kleptogenic reproduction—replacing a portion of the maternal genome with paternal DNA in offspring has allowed unisexual individuals to \\"refresh\\" their genetic material through time. This facet of kleptogenesis was recently ascertained from genetic research that indicates there is no ancestral A. laterale genome that is maintained from one unisexual to the next, and that there is not a specific \\"L\\" genome that is found more often than others. \\"L\\" genetic material found in these salamanders has also not evolved to be substantially unique from sexual genomes. Examples species exhibiting the property include the water frogs in Europe in the genus Pelophylax.

It was established in 1848 by the first bishop of the Diocese of Cleveland, Louis Amadeus Rappe.Saint Mary Seminary and Graduate School of Theology : Welcome! History Bishop Louis Amadeus Rappe established the seminary in Cleveland in 1848 as St. Francis de Sales Seminary, a name it used for only a short time before becoming Saint Mary Seminary. In its first years, the seminary was housed in a former stable, but in 1859 it was moved to a new purpose-built structure at the corner of Lake and Hamilton Streets in Cleveland. During the 1920s, the institution moved again, to a new building at Superior and Ansel Roads in Cleveland. In 1922, the institutional focus was changed to a college undergraduate program, meaning that seminarians from Cleveland studied theology at Mount St. Mary's Seminary in Cincinnati. However, the Cleveland seminary program resumed in 1929, and from 1929 to 1954, the Cleveland institution offered both undergraduate education and graduate theology training. In 1954, a separate undergraduate college program, known as Borromeo College (or Borromeo College Seminary), was started in Wickliffe on a campus formerly occupied by Marycrest School. Borromeo offered a liberal arts program and awarded bachelor's degrees to male students considering the possibility of entering the priesthood. In 1990 the St. Mary Seminary programs were moved to the Wickliffe location, while the Borromeo undergraduate program continues at John Carroll University. Programs The seminary's main mission is to prepare students for Roman Catholic priesthood. It awards master's degrees in theology and divinity, as well as a Doctor of Ministry. As of 2009, about 130 students were enrolled. Accreditation It has regional accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and is an accredited member of the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada.

Early years Castor Osendé Afana was born in 1930 in Ngoksa near Sa'a, in the Centre Region of Cameroon. In 1948 he was admitted to the seminary at Mvolyé, where he became a strong friend of Albert Ndongmo, the future Bishop of Nkongsamba. He left the seminary in 1950 and became a militant nationalist. At that time Eastern Cameroon was under French colonial rule, and would not gain independence until 1960. Afana joined the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon (UPC), a left-wing movement agitating for independence and led by Ruben Um Nyobé. Osendé Afana went to Toulouse, France to study Economic Science, and by 1956 was a vice-president of the Black African Students Federation in France (Fédération des étudiants d'Afrique noire en France – FEANF), and was managing director of the FEANF organ L'Etudiant d'Afrique noire. As a UPC militant he ensured that the issues of Cameroon were well-covered. While he was managing director, the moderate viewpoint of the magazine shifted to a harder and more incisive tone. In 1958 Osendé Afana was General Treasurer of FEANF, as well as being responsible for the UPC in France. In 1958, after Ruben Um Nyobé died, Osendé Afana decided to abandon his thesis and rejoin the leadership of the UPC, proposing himself as a candidate for the new Secretary General. Nyobé's successor, Félix-Roland Moumié, told him \\"There is no longer a Secretary General. There was one, he is dead, that is it.\\" However, Osendé Afana was designated UPC representative at the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference in Cairo in December 1957 – January 1958. The conference was dominated by supporters of the Chinese version of communism, and later Osendé's Maoism was to arouse suspicions with the UPC leadership in Accra. Osendé Afana completed his studies in Paris in September 1962 and travelled to Accra. UPC leadership in exile In April and May 1955 the UPC held a series of angry meetings, circulated pamphlets and organised strikes. On 13 July 1955 the French government dissolved the UPC by decree. Most of the UPC leaders moved to Kumba in the British-administered Southern Cameroons to avoid being jailed by the colonial power. In July 1957, under pressure from the French, the British authorities in western Cameroon deported the leaders of the UPC to Khartoum, Sudan. They moved in turn to Cairo, Egypt, to Conakry, Guinea and finally to Accra, Ghana. After Cameroon gained independence in 1960, UPC rebels who had been fighting the French colonial government continued to fight the government of President Ahmadou Ahidjo, whom they considered to be a puppet of the French. On 6 September 1962 the UPC leadership in exile met in Accra at Ndeh Ntumazah's house, and decided to exclude the \\"criminal clique of Woungly\\" from the administrative secretariat. At ten that evening, when the attendees were about to leave, a bomb exploded without causing any injury. The Ghana authorities were not amused and threw the entire UPC leadership in jail. In October they freed Massaga, Tchaptchet and Ntumazah, but kept Abel Kingué in prison. On 13 September 1962 the UPC organised its first Assemblée populaire sous maquis in Mungo, where the Revolutionary Committee was named. The committee was presided over by Ernest Ouandié. Other members were Abel Kingué, Michel Ndoh, Ndongo Diyé, Osendé Afana, Nicanor Njiawe and Woungly-Massaga. A two-headed leadership was theoretically in place, with Abel Kingué leading the exiles from Ghana and Ernest Ouandié in the maquis. The organisation functioned poorly due to communication problems and also to the Sino-Soviet split. The next year it split, with Abel Kingué and Osendé Afana allied with Ntumazah and opposed to the other leaders. Guerilla Baka people of Eastern Cameroon In 1963 Osendé Afana left Cairo, Egypt, where he had taken refuge. He travelled to Conakry, Guinea, and then to Accra, Ghana, where he met the core of the leadership in exile. He spent the following months in Brazzaville before secretly entering Cameroon with the intent of establishing a new maquis, a second front in the Moloundou region, a corner of Cameroon that borders the Republic of the Congo. In August 1963 there had been a popular revolution in Congo Brazzaville in which the neo-colonial regime of Fulbert Youlou was replaced by a government led by Alphonse Massemba-Débat. This government was relatively friendly to the UPC rebels, opening the possibility of supply from the Congo. Details of his activity in the period that followed are sketchy, but Osendé Afana seems to have made several visits to the extremely poor Moloundou region, where he made contact with the local people, mostly Bakas. On 1 September 1965 a small party led by Asana entered Moloundou, mainly aiming to educate the people rather than start an uprising, but was forced to leave quickly. He intended to establish a politico- administrative organisation on Maoist lines, but the population of this very backward part of Cameroon was not receptive to these ideas. A few months later Osendé Afana's small group returned to Moloundou. By 5 March 1966 they had been detected and encircled by troops that were far more at home in the forest than they were. Osendé, a myopic intellectual, lost his spectacles and his sandals. On 15 March 1966 his party was ambushed by a Cameroon army unit. He did not take flight, as did most of his companions. Taken prisoner, he was killed and decapitated, and his head was flown by helicopter to Yaoundé so that President Ahmadou Ahidjo could look into the eyes of the dead man. Publications and views Osendé Afana's article Justice pour le Cameroun (Justice for Cameroon) appeared in the first issue of L'Etudiant d'Afrique noire (The Black African Student) in 1956. It included a short but complete overview of the French and British colonial rule in Cameroon, including the annexation of various parts of the territory to Nigeria. In issue 8, January 1857, he published an important article Pour ou contre L'Etudian d'Afrique Noire? In February 1957 Afana gave his study Le Kamerun en lutte to the fourth United Nations commission, and in July 1957 published L'Etat sous tutelle de Cameroun (The Trust State of Cameroon). Osendé Afana was the author of a thesis on economics that was published in the year of his death. In the 1950s and 1960s there was rivalry between the Chinese and Soviet communist parties. Osendé Afana aligned himself with the Chinese, who seemed more revolutionary in their views than the Soviets. He theorised on the existence of a \\"primitive communism\\" in the pre-colonial era, but noted the existence of contradictions in the social and inter-tribal structures, and the relations between the sexes and the generations. In a brochure published after his death, Osendé Afana gave the standard Marxist viewpoint: \\"The proletariat is the most revolutionary class... Some say that in Africa it is the peasantry that is the most exploited... but anyway, it is the proletariat that is most conscious of their exploitation.\\" References Citations Sources    1930 births 1966 deaths Cameroonian rebels History of Cameroon Union of the Peoples of Cameroon politicians People from Centre Region (Cameroon) Deaths by decapitation Cameroonian expatriates in France Cameroonian expatriates in Egypt ","title":"Osendé Afana"},{"id":"36587507","text":"Samuel Roberts FRS (15 December 1827, Horncastle, Lincolnshire – 18 September 1913, London) was a British mathematician.

Biography János Radványi was born in Budapest in 1922. He fought the Germans in the partisan underground until the Second World War ended. He entered diplomatic service in 1947 and was posted in Turkey, France, Switzerland, and Syria. He was appointed to head the Hungarian Embassy in Washington, D.C. in 1962. Five years later for political reasons, Ambassador Radványi cut his ties with the Hungarian government and issued a statement that said in part: \\"I have always tried to work for peace and better understanding in this troubled world. However, in recent months I came to realize that it was impossible for me to act in good conscience and continue to be the representative of the Hungarian Government to the American Government.\\" For his defection, Radványi was convicted and sentenced to death in absentia by a Hungarian court. Dean Rusk, the US Secretary of State, reported that Hungarian Foreign Minister János Péter had attempted to defraud the United States by pretending to be in contact with the government of North Vietnam. Rusk engaged in what he at the time believed to be serious negotiations to end the war in Vietnam. However, Radványi, after his defection, later informed Rusk \\"that Péter was not in an effective contact with Hanoi, and that they had had no encouragement from Hanoi about the things that Péter was saying to me.\\" Rusk came to believe that the Péter overture \\"was an instance that was just a plain fraud.\\"D. Rusk, LBJ Oral History Collection, Interview II, p. 14 After being granted political asylum, he and his family moved to California. He earned a doctorate in History at Stanford University in 1971. Shortly thereafter, he joined the faculty of the History Department at Mississippi State University. In 1982, he founded and directed the Center for International Security and Strategic Studies. In June 1996, Radványi became the first chair holder of the newly established Endowed Chair for International Security and Strategic Studies at Mississippi State University. In 1978, Radványi and his family were granted American citizenship. He died on 11 January 2016.Legendary MSU professor dies Books * Radványi, János: Hungary and the Superpowers.

Independent Collectors is said to be the largest online resource of privately owned art and also offers a forum to discuss topics on collecting.. Independent Collectors is based in Berlin, Germany. Die Zeit has described the site as a \\"Facebook for aesthetics\\".  History  Christian Kaspar Schwarm originally came up with the idea based upon his own experiences of collecting contemporary artwork, noting that he was able to get to know gallery owners but not fellow collectors. He then teamed up with Ulrich Grothe and Uwe Thomas to found the website in 2008, to allow for easier communication between collectors. In 2009, the site entered into a partnership with automobile manufacturer BMW, as well as starting a content-based partnership with insurance company Allianz in 2014.  Website  The Independent Collectors website offers a platform to showcase, share and discover contemporary art collections online. In December 2016, the website's collectors community counts more than 5,000 registered members in 97 countries. Members are required to adhere to the ethical code of Independent Collectors stating that they will not use the website for business related purposes. Each member application is individually verified, yet approved users can select to keep their identity anonymous.

Registered community members benefit from special offers such as VIP tickets, private tours and selected publications. After a relaunch in early 2015, Independent Collectors complemented its closed community area with an open, publicly accessible editorial program on collecting. The website now incorporates a diverse program focused on online exhibitions and interviews, offering an insight into the culture of contemporary collecting.

He was created by artist Mike Sekowsky and writer Gardner Fox. He first appeared in Brave and the Bold #29. Fictional character biography =Pre-Crisis= Xotar was one of the first villains ever faced by the Justice League of America. He was a highly intelligent supervillain from the year A.D. 11,960. After obtaining the diary of Snapper Carr, he learned that he successfully destroyed the Justice League after travelling to the past using one of his four most powerful weapons. The diary was damaged, however, so he had to fight the Justice League in small groups until he could determine which weapon defeated them. His first battle was against the Flash at a missile base. Xotar used a shrinking ray which he called a microscopitor. Flash used his size to sneak inside the giant robot body Xotar used, destroyed the microscopitor and returned to normal size. Xotar then attacked the Panama Canal and battled Aquaman and the Martian Manhunter. Xotar used his de- evolutionizer and appeared to destroy the Martian Manhunter, though he actually turned invisible and destroyed the de-evolutionizer as Aquaman distracted him. He then battled Wonder Woman, Batman, and Green Lantern at Mount Rushmore. Xotar used his magneto-bubble weapon, which traps people in magnetic bubbles that are pulled towards the sun. Green Lantern managed to break the bubbles with his power ring, and Wonder Woman snatched the machine with her lasso. He then battled all the Justice Leaguers with his illusion- maker weapon that would trick them into destroying each other. Superman's special vision allowed him to see past it and to destroy the fourth weapon. Xotar was then taken back to the future and turned over to law enforcement. As it turned out, the diary Xotar read actually told of his defeat, but it was so damaged that it looked like it said that he had won the fight.Brave and the Bold #29 (May 1960) Later Superman, Green Lantern and Wonder Woman are visiting a carnival when they stumble upon a plot by Xotar, whose race plans to conquer the Earth; however, they set up their cosmic carnival in order to stop the Justice League. Taking the three heroes prisoner, and using their advanced technology to make two of their members look like Green Lantern and Flash, the aliens hope to trap the rest of the Justice League. However, while trying to trick Aquaman in the same trap, the captured League members manage to break free, and although their physical forms are distorted by a cosmic funhouse mirror, they manage to stop the impostors and their plot to take over the Earth.Justice League of America (vol. 1) #7 (November 1961) =Post- Crisis= When Guy Gardner, Booster Gold and Blue Beetle decide to restart the Justice League, their first meeting is attacked by the Weapons Master. With a veritable arsenal of futuristic weaponry at his command, he quickly takes down all combatants and even Superman and Maxima's intervention was useless. With the League defeated, the Weapons Master claims his price – Guy Gardner's power ring. As he turns to leave, he finds a new hero ready to face him – Bloodwynd. Bloodwynd channels the spirits of the dead to fight the Weapons Master. Unable to counter Bloodwynd's magic, the Weapons Master abducts the five fallen heroes and disappears,Justice League America (vol. 1) #60 (April 1992) but the League eventually defeats him.Justice League America (vol. 1) #61 (April 1992) The character also had set his target towards Superman but was again arrested.Action Comics (vol. 1) #818 He also battled the Legionnaries and the Creature Commandos.Legionnaires (vol. 1) #68 =The New 52= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity.

Inmate Cotar survives the attack, only to be captured by Green Lantern and Flash before being interrogated by Wonder Woman. Cotar reveals the attacker to be David Graves, who has been viciously attacking a number of the Justice League's enemies, wanting to know how to hurt the Justice League.Justice League (vol. 2) #9 (May 2012) Powers and abilities Xotar is super-intelligent and capable of building incredible weapons, though he actually steals most of the weapons that he uses.

In a racing career lasting from summer 1973 until October 1974 she ran eight times and won three races. Highclere won one minor race as a two-year-old but improved to win the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse and Prix de Diane at Chantilly. She later finished second to Dahlia in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. She retired at the end of the season to become a highly successful and influential broodmare. Background Highclere was a bay filly, bred in England by her owner, Queen Elizabeth II. She was sired by the Sussex Stakes winner Queen's Hussar, whose reputation as a stallion had previously rested almost entirely on the fact that he was the sire of Brigadier Gerard. Her dam Highlight won two minor races and was a daughter of Hypericum, who won the 1000 Guineas for King George VI in 1946. As a descendant of the broodmare Feola, Highclere came from the same branch of Thoroughbred family 2-f which produced Round Table, Pebbles and Aureole. The filly was named after Highclere Castle, the home of the Queen's racing manager, Lord Carnarnvon. Highclere was sent into training with Dick Hern at his stables in West Ilsley in Berkshire. Her regular jockey was Joe Mercer. Racing career =1973: two-year-old season= Highclere ran three times as a two-year-old in 1973. After finishing second in a maiden race at Newmarket behind Polygamy, she was moved up in class for the Princess Margaret Stakes at Ascot Racecourse, and finished second again, though this time beating Polygamy. On her final start, she won the Donnington Stakes at Newbury, but was not particularly impressive. At the end of the season she was allotted a weight of 109 pounds in the Free Handicap, a rating of the best two-year-olds to have raced in Britain. The rating placed her twenty-two pounds below the top-rated Apalachee, and nine pounds below Bitty Girl, Gentle Thoughts and Melchbourne who tied for the position of best filly. =1974: three-year-old season= On Highclere's first appearance of 1974 she contested the Classic 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. Wearing blinkers for the first time she started at odds of 12/1 in a field of fifteen fillies. The closing stages of the race saw a struggle between Highclere and the Peter Walwyn- trained favourite Polygamy. with the Queen's filly prevailing by a short head. The win gave the British monarch her second fillies' Classic win, seventeen years after Carrozza won The Oaks. It was believed that the course and distance of the Oaks would not suit Highclere, and so the filly was rerouted to the French equivalent, the Prix de Diane over 2100m at Chantilly. With her owner in attendance, Highclere won by two lengths from Comtesse de Loir. On their return from France Dick Hern and Joe Mercer were invited to dine with the Royal Family at Windsor Castle. In July, Highclere raced against colts and older horses in Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes at Ascot. Highclere finished second, beaten two lengths by the French four-year-old filly Dahlia, who was winning the race for the second year. Highclere failed to reproduce her best form in her two remaining races. She finished unplaced behind Dahlia in the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup and was also unplaced in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe a race in which Allez France beat Comtesse de Loir by a head. Highclere was then retired to stud. Retirement Highclere produced several winners, the best of whom were the colt Milford and the filly Height of Fashion, both of whom won the Princess of Wales's Stakes. Height of Fashion went on to produce the 2000 Guineas and Epsom Derby winner Nashwan as well as the multiple Group winners Nayef and Unfuwain. Another of Highclere's daughters, Burghclere, produced Wind In Her Hair, the dam of Deep Impact. Highclere died in 1992. Her named foals include: *1976/04/29 =Milford (GB), ch colt by Mill Reef – 3 wins from 8 starts, including Princess of Wales's Stakes *1977/04/26 =Burghclere (GB), b filly by =Busted (GB) – 1 win from 6 starts. second dam of Deep Impact. *1978/04/30 =Beacon Hill (GB), ch filly by =Bustino (GB) – winless in 3 starts. *1979/04/14 Height of Fashion (FR), b filly by =Bustino (GB) – champion, multiple stakes winner. dam of Nashwan, Nayef and Unfuwain. second dam of Ghanaati *1982/04/14 =Bright Sun (GB), b filly by Mill Reef – unraced *1985/04/14 Highbrow (GB), bay filly, by Shirley Heights (GB) - 1 win and 6 placings, including 2nd Ribblesdale Stakes.

For example, Talismanic, winner of the 2017 Breeders' Cup Turf, descends from Highclere through Burghclere. Assessment and honours Highclere was given a rating of 129 by Timeform. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Highclere a \\"superior\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas and the forty-sixth best filly or mare trained in Britain or Ireland in the 20th century.  Pedigree  Highclere was inbred 3x4 to Hyperion, meaning that the stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of her pedigree. She was also inbred 4x4 to Fair Trial.

A former Anglican parish church, it is now redundant and, following fire damage, has been converted into residential use. The former church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The church was built in 1838–42, and designed by John Harper of York. The land for the church was given by the 13th Earl of Derby. In 1898 the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley carried out work on the church, including removing the galleries, repairing the roof, and installing new choir stalls and a font. On 1 November 1995 the church was declared redundant. It was damaged by fire in 2004, and has since been converted for residential use. Architecture St Paul's is constructed in sandstone in 13th-century Gothic Revival style. Its plan consists of a nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a chancel and a west tower. The windows along the sides of the church, and in the tower, are lancets. In the Buildings of England series, the authors describe the pinnacles on the tower as \\"like apologetic eyebrows\\". External features The churchyard contains the war graves of thirteen soldiers of World War I and an airman of World War II.

History Bronx site plan for the Museum of the Peaceful Arts The project was originally envisioned as a complex of twenty museums to be located on the west side of Manhattan in Riverside Park, or, according to later plans, near the Jerome Park Reservoir in the Bronx. The original charter shows the scope of the museum system: Accession form for the Museum of the Peaceful Arts Dr. George Frederick Kunz proposed the organization of an entirely new museum, the “Museum of the Peaceful Arts” or the \\"Museums of the Peaceful Arts.\\" As there are museums dedicated to science, war and industry, this would be one devoted to the study and exhibition of the peaceful arts. “…Mr. Julius Rosenwald’s industrial museum gift paralleled the $2,500,000.00 bequest of the late Henry R. Towne, lock and hardware man, to New York for a Museum of Peaceful Arts. Mr. Towne had been interested in such a museum by Dr. George F. Kunz, mineralogist and gem expert, an honorary fellow of the American Museum of Natural History, who has visited every world’s fair since the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876. Announcement of the Towne bequest sent experts in agriculture, animal industry, mining and metallurgy, transportation, engineering, aeronautics, etc., etc., flocking to Europe to study exhibits in such places as the German Museum in Munich, which contains replicas or originals of epochal contrivances, including James Watt’s first steam engine, Diesel’s oil-compression engine, Dunlop’s original tires. The findings of these experts will assist Chicago’s industrialists as well as New York’s, in assembling a record of material ascendancy of mankind, a record that is to be made practical rather than theoretical, with many working models of machinery, to afford inventors an industrial laboratory.”“Chicago’s Luck.” 1926. Time. August 30, 1926. Album of plans to accompany the report of George F. Kunz, president, Museums of the Peaceful Arts, 1927 The museum proved to be successful. The New Yorker had a discussion about it in 1929: \\"They have unusual machines: Under a microscope you can see how much you can bend a steel rail with the pressure of your finger, a movie shows air currents moving, etc. The collection was started in 1913 by a group of business men. For the last two years it has been in the present museum which is supported, largely, by a bequest of two and a half million dollars from the late Henry F. Towne.\\" Theodore Pratt and James Thurber. \\"The Talk of the Town: 'Amiable machines'\\". New Yorker Magazine. July 20, 1929.

Orville Wright wrote to Dr. Kunz in May, 1925, about giving one of the original Wright airplanes to the museum, and his experiences with other museums: In a book on the history of science, George Sarton says: “This museum is quoted here only pro memoria. The idea was originated by George F. Kunz (1856-1932): The projected Museum of the Peaceful Arts (paper read before the American Association of Museums’s Meeting, New York, 1912, 12 pages). Great efforts were made to obtain sufficient capital but failed. It was more or less replaced by the New York Museum of Science and Industry. G.

Her first sortie proper started with her departure from Bergen on 7 March 1945. It finished in the same port on 16 March. While sailing on another non- classifiable voyage, she shot a Mosquito of No. 235 Squadron RAF down. The pilot was captured. =2nd patrol and surrender= She left Bergen on 3 April 1945 and arrived at Portland, UK, flying the black flag of surrender on 10 May. She was then briefly used by the British as the research ship N 86 before being transferred to Loch Ryan in Scotland for Operation Deadlight. She was sunk on 13 December 1945.

The church is located in the upper quarter of the old city, and dates to the Palaiologan period, but its original dedication is unknown. In Ottoman times, it was known as the Saraylı Mosque (Palace Mosque or Court Mosque), and through a misinterpretation of this name came about its modern dedication to the Prophet Elijah. It has been traditionally identified as the katholikon of the Nea Moni monastery, built ca. 1360–1370 on the site of a former palace destroyed in 1342 by the Zealot uprising.Kourkoutidou-Nikolaidou & Tourta (1997), pp. 111–112 Modern research, however, has cast doubt on this, since the Nea Moni continued to operate well into the Ottoman period, while the church of Prophet Elijah was converted into a mosque by Badrah Mustafa Pasha immediately after the city's capture in 1430. On the basis of its internal decoration, it has been suggested that the church was the katholikon of the important Akapniou Monastery.Kourkoutidou-Nikolaidou & Tourta (1997), pp. 112–113 Its architectural style, a variant of cross-in-square church known as the \\"Athonite type\\", is unique in the city, and was always reserved for katholika of monasteries. The careful masonry, of alternating courses of bricks and white ashlar, is also unusual for Thessaloniki and its region; it is copied from Constantinopolitan architecture.Kourkoutidou-Nikolaidou & Tourta (1997), pp. 113–114 Several of its architectural features have also been interpreted as set to create an ambient atmosphere directly connected with the type of worship, through the way natural light is distributed. Fragments of the church's original decoration survive in the form of wall paintings, fine examples of late Palaiologan art, which influenced later paintings in Serbia.Kourkoutidou-Nikolaidou & Tourta (1997), pp. 115–116 References Sources * *Iliadis, I.

Chicago (Marquis Academic Media) 1980, p.645. According to Peter Alexis Gourevitch, Diamant was both “on the Executive Committee of the Council for European Studies (based in New York) and the Interuniversity Center for European Studies in Montreal.”See: Peter Alexis Gourevitch, “The State of West European Studies,” Washington Quarterly , Vol. 2, issue 4 , 1979, pp. 119ff. - The Council for European Studies provided grants to young academics focused on European Studies. The money came from the German Marshall Fund, the Friedrich Ebert Foundation etc. Alfred Diamant was published by Princeton University Press and by top ranking journals like Administrative Science Quarterly, Comparative Political Studies, and PS. Political Science and Politics. (See List of publications) Diamant's “areas of expertise” were “Comparative Western European Politics and Social Policy.”Editorial note, in: PS. Political Science and Politics, Vol. 23, No. 4 (Dec. 1990), p. 600. Together with his colleague, James Christoph, he “established Indiana University as a major site of the study of European culture, society and politics.”Jeffrey C.Isaac, Norman Furniss: Professor of Political Science, Bloomington, Ind.

John D.Martz called the “works of Maurice Duvergier, Sigmund Neumann and Alfred Diamant” that focus on the study of political parties “Western European-oriented classics.”Cf. John D.Martz, “Party Elites and Leadership in Colombia and Venezuela”, in: Journal of Latin America Studies, Vol. 24, No.1, Feb. 1992, p.87.

( (Indiana University) 1948. M.A. thesis. By that time, it was already clear to him that he wanted to teach and do research at a university. His focus on the anti- democratic developments in pre-WWII Europe is apparent in a number of large studies and minor contributions that he wrote since the 1950s. Diamant analyzed the role of Conservative political catholicism in Austria and its contribution to the rise of the clerical fascist Dollfuss regime.C.J. Wrigley is one of the many authors writing about this phase of Austrian history who quote Diamant. Wrigley says that “it was the Catholic Centre Party under Dollfuss that replaced parliamentary democracy with the corporate state. (…) (A)s Diamant has written, ‘Catholic politicians simply picked out whatever seemed the most effective anti-republican and anti-democratic argument (…)’. Dollfuss himself loathed ‘Red Vienna’ and could draw on Austrian Catholic political traditions. In 1933 he made his aim explicit, “(…) We demand a social, Christian, German Austria on a corporate basis and under strong authoritarian leadership.’ (…)” – C.J.

Such works were motivated by a desire to enlighten people concerning the root causes and to prevent a return of what had occurred, no matter whether it might reappear in the form of a tragedy or as a farce. He was convinced that the repeat of mistakes, the return of the same was not inevitable. Instead of pessimism (which would have been understandable), a democratic optimism prevailed.See: “Comparative Politics: The Myth of the Eternal Return”, in: PS: Political Science and Politics, , vol. 23, no. 4, Dec. 1990, pp. 598-600 At the same time, Diamant also took a stand back home in the U.S., with regard to U.S. affairs. Like other open- minded, nonconformist intellectuals, he was opposed to witchhunts of the type practiced by Senator Joseph McCarthy. As early as 1950 he took a stand when he reviewed the book ‘Character Assassination’ by Jerome Davis that had just appeared.At a time when the witchhunt of McCarthy was under way, Diamant wrote that the book by Davis was “clearly a ‘tract for the times’ (…) In this book, Davis has set himself the task of recording the methods by which, since the seventeenth century, the ‘powers that be’ (…) have attempted to subdue racial, social, religious, economic, or other ‘undesirable’ groups (…) by impugning their motives and by assassinating their character.” See: Alfred Diamant.“[Review of] Character Assassination” [by Jerome Davis, Introd. by Robert Maynard Hutchins. New York (Philosophical Library) 1950] in The Western Political Quarterly, vol. 4, no. 1, March 1951, pp. 172f. – At the time, the HUAC “published names of organizations it deemed subversive (…)”. See Howard D. Mehlinger. The Best That I Can Recall. Bloomington (authors house) 2009. Diamant found the “partisan attacks” in “recent years” especially objectionable when they had been “given scientific trappings.” Another article published in the 1950s in The Western Political Quarterly also reflects his democratic commitment. It argued in favor of improved local government.William C. Havard; Alfred Diamant, “The Need for Local Government Reform in the United States”, in: The Western Political Quarterly, vol. 9, no. 4, Dec. 1956, pp. 967-995. Similarly, he defended the right of Vietnam war opponents to dissent in an article jointly written with two colleagues and published in the New York Times in 1965.See: Wallace T. MacCaffrey / Alfred Diamant / Marcel M. Gutwirth, “Right of Dissent,” in: The New York Times, Nov. 17, 1965. Rethinking Max Weber In the 1960s, Diamant focused increasingly on the critical study of institutional frameworks and thus, above all, on bureaucracy. Max Weber, the conservative he initially looked at without much sympathy, was now critically received and his important insights were adapted to fit the needs of a democratic societal project. (In similar fashion, progressives have been open to the reception of Clausewitz since the 1960s.) A key essay by Alfred Diamant, titled The Bureaucratic Model: Max Weber Rejected, Rediscovered, Reformed, that appeared in Papers in Comparative Public Administrative Sciences (No. 1 1962,pp. 59–96), reveals this critical yet decisive reception of Max Weber. The author of ‘The American Bureaucracy,’ Richard J. Stillman, calls it an “insightful piece.”Richard Joseph Stillman II, Public Administration: Concepts and Cases. Boston (Wadsworth) 2010, p76. Dwight Waldo thinks it is important to “direct” the reader's “attention” to it. As D.Waldo notes, it is in this essay that Diamant “reviews the vast array” of scholarly publications on bureaucracy respectively bureaucracies while at the same time “carefully and penetratingly examin[ing] what Weber wrote on, and relating to, bureaucracy. Diamant “evaluates, relates, and classifies; and ends up by setting forth proposals ‘for the comparative analysis of bureaucracies; using the Weberian ideal-type’[...]” – as he had “modified it.”Dwight Waldo, “Comparative Public Administration: Prologue, Performance, Problems, and Promise”, in: Eric E. Otenyo and Nancy S. Lind (eds.), Corporate Public Administration: The Essential Readings. Amsterdam; Oxford; San Diego (Elsevier) 2006, pp.129-170. The quotation is from p.148. Diamant emphasized the fact that “Weber associated bureaucracy with a legal- rational authority system.”See: Ralph Braibanti (ed.), Political and Administrative Development. Durham NC (Duke University Press) 1969, p.171. This was what made it modern and what constituted its essence. Ideally, a ‘bureaucratic’ (or administrative) apparatus (or ‘institution’) had to be rational in order to function well. It also was tied to the rule of law (as opposed to absolutist or dictatorial arbitrary suspension of such rule of law). Ideally, this made its functioning dependable and foreseeable. Both qualities, ‘rationality’ and ‘rule of law,’ made bureaucracy a modern phenomenon. And its “authority” – in other words, the fact that it was accepted by the population – depended on both traits. There was nothing specifically Prussian about either ‘rationality’ or ‘rule of law.’ If the specific Prussian way of applying ‘rationality’ and ‘rule of law’ was deficient (or if, somewhat later, the bureaucratic ‘rationality’ of the fascists who organized the holocaust was horrible, just like the Nuremberg laws ( Nuernberger Gesetze) were horrible), this did not mean that the ideals had to be discarded as meaningful guideposts. Instead, they had to be filled, again and again, in given historical situations, with a material content that reflected both humane values and the concrete needs of the citizens. Diamant was not necessarily a Weberian scholar. Referring to Weber's ‘ideal-tye’ of bureaucracy, E. N. Suleiman observes, “Some saw in his model a rigid, Prussian-inspired influence that had but a tangential relationship to reality.” Suleiman points specifically to Diamant.Ezra N. Suleiman, Dismantling Democratic States. Princeton NJ (Princeton University Press) 2005, p.19. Diamant knew indeed that Weber was a functional academic, whose profound insights into the workings of bureaucracies served the interests of the Wilhelminian authoritarian nation-state.Accordingly he could only comprehend administrative institutions as basically undemocratic. As Julien Freund summed up Max Weber’s concept of bureaucracy, it is “the most typical example of legal domination” (of the people by the government). See: Raymond Aron, Main Currents of Sociological Thought, Vol. 2: Durkheim, Pareto, Weber. New York (Transaction Publishers) 1999, 3rd printing 2009, p.341.- See also: Julien Freund, The Sociology of Max Weber, trans. Mary Ilford (New York: Pantheon Books, Inc., 1968 Insofar Weber's model was “a Prussian inspired model” just like Weber himself was a nationalist and per se anti-democratic. He represented and aided the status quo. But regardless of one's social and political position regarding this status quo, how could one ignore his penetrating insights in the way bureaucracies function and regarding the (positive and negative) purposes they can serve? What mattered was to reflect his insights in the light of new, added knowledge and in the interest not of a ‘Leviathan’ of the Prusso-German type, but in the interest of a democratically constituted society. As far as the charge is concerned that Weber's ‘ideal- type’ was ‘abstract’ and thus meaningless, Diamant knew full-well that science operates with abstractions. This certainly could not be held against the German scholar. Therefore, it is not surprising that “Diamant makes a valiant effort to defend and ‘resurrect’ Weber from the telling criticisms of scholars like Presthus, Beck and Berger. Weber, he notes, was not so naïve as to believe that his ideal-constructs had unqualified correspondence” in what we like to refer to as the real world.Alan Arian, “Empathy and Ideology: Aspects of Administrative Innovation,” in: Charles Press and Alan Arian (eds.), Empathy and Ideology: Aspects of Administrative Innovation. Chicago (Rand McNally) 1966, p.92. - See also Ramesh Kumar Arora who notes that “Weber was not unmindful of the limitations of bureaucratic rationality in practice. This became evident in his analysis of the dysfunctions of Prussian bureaucracy under Bismarck (…)”Ramesh Kumar Arora, Administrative Theory. (Indian Institute of Public Administration) 1984, p.XVIII. What mattered, according to Diamant, was to ‘modify,’ adapt, or surpass Weber's constructs. It is well known that in the 20th century, several sociologists and political scientists “have sought to construct typologies that are closer approximations of the mixes or dualities existing in the real world. The Comparative Administration Group (…) was prominent in this field.”Alan Arian, ibidem, p.89. As a member of this group, Diamant shared its basic orientation but did not see the necessity to discard Weber's bureaucracy model entirely. There was too much in it that was still pertinent. A pioneer in the field of Comparative Politics and Comparative Administration Robert H. Jackson states that “(s)ince World War II a new approach to the study of public administration (...) developed.” Comparative strategies of research were developed and this meant that “administrative behavior and practices (were) analyzed in widely different societies and cultures.” Robert H. Jackson, “An Analysis of the Comparative Public Administration Movement,” in: Canadian Public Administration, Vol.9, No.1, March 1966, p.108. – Cf. also: Dwight Waldo, “Thirtieth Anniversary Symposium: Political Science Advance of the Discipline: Public Administration,” in: The Journal of Politics, Vol. 30, Issue 2 (May 1968), pp. 443-479. Alfred Diamant, a key member of the Comparative Administration Group (CAG), was part of this innovation of the discipline. “Among scholars who have contribute to the comparative studies of comparative bureaucratic systems (..., ) Monroe Berger, Alfred Diamant, Ferrel Heady, Robert Presthus and Michael Crozier” are singled out as particularly noteworthy by Pardeep Sahni and Etakula Vayunandan.Pardeep Sahni and Etakula Vayunandan, Administrative Theory Administrative Theory New Delhi, India (PHI Learning), 2010, p.62 Diamant's grasp of European political cultures and his knowledge of American paradigms made a comparative orientation plausible. Dwight Waldo called his discussion of “The Relevance of Comparative Politics to the Study of Comparative Administration” an excellent methodological contribution.Cf. Alfred Diamant, \\"The Relevance of Comparative Politics to the Study of Comparative Administration,\\" Administrative Science Quarterly, 5 (June, 1960), pp. 87-112. - The article “is an excellent discussion of various methodological questions”, according to Dwight Waldo. “Centrally, it is a comparison of ‘General Systems’ and ‘Political Cultures’ models.” (Dwight Waldo, “Comparative Public Administration: Prologue, Performance, Problems, and Promise”, in: Eric E. Otenyo and Nancy S. Lind (eds.), Corporate Public Administration: The Essential Readings. Amsterdam; Oxford; San Diego (Elsevier) 2006, p. 166) – Other articles that emphasize a comparative approach are: A. Diamant, “Bureaucracy and Administration in Western Europe: A Case of Not So Benign Neglect”, in: Policy Studies Journal, vol.1, no.3, March 1973, pp. 133-138; A. Diamant, European Bureaucratic Elites: Rising or Declining? in: History of European Ideas, vol. 11 no.1, Jan. 1989, pp. 545-558. Empirical comparative studies are a thorough approach if one wants to understand the specific traits of Fascist or Stalinist bureaucracy.Alfred Diamant. “[Review of] Bolshevism. An Introduction to Soviet Communism. By Waldemar Gurian”, in: Political Research Quarterly, vol. 6, no. 2, 1953, pp. 368-369. They could also serve to elucidate the positive and negative traits of French public administration, as a state bureaucracy subjected to dual political control.Alfred Diamant, “The Department: The Prefect, and Dual Supervision in French Administration: A Comparative Study”, in: The Journal of Politics, vol. 16, no. 3, Aug. 1954, pp. 472-490. How did it work, in comparison to U.S. public administration? The focus on France mattered, for another reason, as well. France was practically a sister republic of the U.S., with a long republican and progressive tradition. It was another “common law country.” In his critique of Austrian conservatism, Diamant had “defined … European political Catholicism as a reaction of both clerics and laymen to the challenges of the French Revolution respectively the modern (liberal) state of the 19th century that was based on it. This ‘anti-modernist’ attitude manifests itself on different levels – on the level of ideas, by way of the formation of a distinct ‘Catholic philosophy’ and ‘culture,’ on the socio- economic level by way of the development of a ‘Catholic social doctrine,’ on the political level by way of the organization of Catholic movements and parties.” This is how G. Stimmer sums it up.Gernot Stimmer, Eliten in Oesterreich 1848-1970. Vienna (Boehlau) 1997, p.746. France was in many ways an antipode of Austria. It was more modern, having been at the forefront of the industrial revolution, on the European continent, together with Belgium. Although Catholic, it was anti-clerical. Conservative forces were not almost constantly overwhelming Republicans. On top of it, it had a long administrative tradition anchored in Republicanism, though older roots of its ‘droit administratif’ (or legal framework pertaining to public administration), in the Royal Council of the ancien régime, existed. Diamant was especially interest in French developments that took place in the course of the first term of President Mitterrand.See: Alfred Diamant. “French Field Administration Revisited: The Beginnings of the Mitterrand Reforms”, in: Robert T. Golembiewski, Aaron Wildavsky (eds.), The Costs of Federalism: in honor of James W. Fesler, New Brunswick, N. J. (Transaction Books) 1984; pp. 143-164. It is noteworthy, however, that Diamant did not idealize the situation in France. It is true that it was more liberal than Austria had been. It had a strong administrative tradition, and the French republic regulated the civil service by way of a body of laws pertaining to the country's administration. If we would suppose, however, that in France, administrators can provide some “impetus for major reform,” we are mistaken, as Aberbach et al. have not failed to point out.Joel D.Aberbach, Robert D.Putnam, Bert A. Rockman, Bureaucrats and Politicians in Western Democracies. Cambridge MA (Harvard University Press) 1981, p.16. They quote Diamant who stated flatly, “The French experience would indicate that, in fact, during periods of political indecision, the grand corps do not really govern the country, they simply continue routine operations, maintain the status quo, and protect their own interest.” Diamant obviously regrets that these administrators “could not carry through radical innovations.”Alfred Diamant, quoted by Joel D. Aberbach et al., ibidem, p.16. Civil servants of the people should after all act efficiently and determinedly, in the interest of the people. Focus on the ‘Third World’ As far as “administrative science research” was “focused on developing countries,” it became increasingly comparative in orientation, as H.G. Steiffert noted.Hans-Georg Steiffert, “Forschungsansätze zu ‘Verwaltung und politische Entwicklung’ (Research Approaches concerning Administration and Political Development)”, in: Dieter Oberdoerfer (ed.), Verwaltung und Politik in der Dritten Welt. Problemskizzen, Fallstudien, Bibliographie. Berlin (Duncker & Humblot) 1981, pp.30f. Steiffert singles out Alfred Diamant (1962) as well as Robert H. Presthus (1961), K. Henderson (1964), Amitai Etzioni (1967), and Berton H. Kaplan (1968) as the noteworthy theoretical contributors to the debate in the 1960s, while mentioning also the contribution of Edward W. Weidner (in 1970).Steiffert, ibidem, p.29f. In the 1960s, it was above all the Comparative Administration Group (CAG) that was focused on Development Studies, especially after it had received a substantial grant from the Ford Foundation in 1962 that was to facilitate research on “methods for improving public administration in developing countries.” Howard E. McCurdy, “Fred W. Riggs: Contributions to the Study of Comparative Public Administration” . Among the noteworthy members of the CAG, Fred Riggs stands out. He had joined the faculty of the Government Department at Indiana University in 1956.In 1957-58, Riggs did field work in Thailand. He taught in the Philippines in 1958-59. See: Howard E. McCurdy, ibidem. In 1960, “his colleagues elected him chair of the comparative Public Group” (the CAG), a position he held until 1971.Howard E. McCurdy, ibidem. This was the period when “the CAG became a forum for intellectuals attempting to understand in a systematic [way] why administrative practices in non- Western countries diverged so widely from what were thought to be good and universal principles.” Howard E. McCurdy, ibidem. As a member of the Comparative Administration Group, based at Indiana University like Riggs, Diamant applied his insights into the importance of institutional frameworks of social change (frameworks that in themselves were not seen as static but as changeable and subject to change) to Third World Studies. He chose a ‘bureaucratic systems approach’ which Rodman describes as “(l)ess abstract and more obviously relevant” to its chosen purpose than the “input-output system approach” was as a “conceptual framework”.Peter W . Rodman, “Development Administration: Obstacles, Theories and Implications for Planning.(II EP; occasional papers no.2), Paris (Unesco : International Institute for Educational Planning) n.d., p.21. Also online: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000755/075535eo.pdf. Several publications of Diamant that tackled methodological questions appeared in the 1960s.See Alfred Diamant, Buraucracy in Developmental Movement Regimes: A Bureaucratic Model for Developing Societies. Bloomington, Ind. (CAG Occasional papers; American Society for Public Administration / International Development Research Center, Indiana University) 1964. Other contributions touching on this topic include: A. Diamant, “Is There A Non-Western Political Process? Comments on Lucian W. Pye’s ‘The Non-Western Political Process’”, in: The Journal of Politics, vol. 21, no. 1, Feb., 1959, pp. 123-127 and A. Diamant, Modellbetrachtung der Entwicklungsverwaltung. (Transl by Hans Jecht). Baden- Baden (Nomos) 1967. Schrader called Diamant's Models of Bureaucracy and Development (Modellbetrachtung der Entwicklungsverwaltung.translated by Hans Jecht and published in German in 1967) “an important, relevant work.”In German: “eine wichtige einschlägige Arbeit.” Reinhard Schrader, “Vergleich der Gesamtsysteme von Wirtschafts- und Staatsordnung,” in: Jahrbuch fuer Sozialwissenschaft, Vol. 19, No. 3 (1998). At least one of Diamant's studies focused on racism in South Africa at the time. The apartheid regime was confronted by a liberation movement (Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC)) that was branded as terrorist by various governments. Change was necessary. Racism was unacceptable to Diamant who had suffered fascist racism. The study was supported by a subdivision of the European Commission.See: Alfred Diamant, Race Attitudes in South Africa. Historical, experimental and psychological studies. Brussels (Commission of the European Communities) 1965. Political science research tied to democratic values: The quest for democratic control In their ‘Introduction’ to Chapt.1 of their book on Public Administration, Sahni and Etakula Vayunandan stated, “The rise of the modern welfare state has expanded the scope of public administration. It has widened to the extent that now very few aspects of an individual’s life remain unaffected by public administration. This stands true for all societies, socialist, capitalist, and so on.” They also quote W.B.Donham who said, “If our civilization fails, it will be mainly because of a breakdown of administration.See: Pardeep Sahni and Etakula Vayunandan, ibidem.– Both authors are professors at Indira Gandhi National Open University, Faculty of Public Administration in New Delhi. The recognition of the objective necessity of administrating ‘public things’ (in Latin: res publica) does not imply indifference to the question, ‘What sort of administration befits a democratic society?’ And therefore to such related questions as, ‘How can we, the people, make sure that administrative institutions serve us and respond to our needs, rather than vice versa?’ And furthermore, ‘How can we, the people, make sure that administrative institutions adapt to changing needs and arising challenges that society must deal with?’ - Diamant was convinced that if bureaucracies were unavoidable, at least they should not work against us or limit civil rights and the freedom of citizens unnecessarily; on the contrary, they should better our lot. And above all, they should be democratically controlled. How they could be controlled in the best way by the people and its elected servants was a problem that could be handled in a more rational way if empirical evidence of the pros and cons of actually employed models of political oversight was scrutinized in a comparative manner.See: Alfred Diamant, “The French Council of State: Comparative Observations on the Problem of Controlling the Bureaucracy of the Modern State”, in: The Journal of Politics, vol. 13, no. 4, Nov. 1951, pp. 562ff. (passim). Apparently, speaking of public institutions, efficiency, coordination, responsibility, oversight and (democratic) political control matter in democratic contexts. Industrial democracy Alfred Diamant also turned to the question of industrial democracy.An analytical contribution to the debate that he made in 1982, Industrial Democracy in Western Europe, n.p.( American Political Science Association) 1982, did not appear in book form,though, but only as microfiche. As always, his observations tended to be cool and objective, when he was discussing it. And yet, his study revealed a critical impetus. The analytic stance and the detachment may have made his critical observations even more effective. Discussing the German model which allowed trade-union representatives to sit on the board of corporations in the name of ‘joint decision-making’ or co-determination (‘Mitbestimmung’), P. Barach and A. Botwinick observed that Diamant provided a “thorough and perceptive study.” Diamant “concluded that the achievements of codetermination «so far are more nearly system-maintaining than system-transforming in character» [...].”Peter Bachrach and Aryeh Botwinick, Power and Empowerment. A Radical Theory of Participatory Democracy. Philadelphia (Temple University Press) 1992,p.78. The words quoted, though carefully phrased and seemingly detached and objective, reveal a certain disappointment. Diamant’s theoretical emphasis on “political development” Diamant hoped for ‘achievements’ or improvements, a ‘bettering’ of that which existed. In his view, change that corresponded to the felt needs of the population was inherently positive. This progressive bend of mind was basically inscribed in his theory of political development. Omar Guerrero sums up Alfred Diamant's position by pointing out the specific quality that characterizes a process that the latter would describe as ‘political development’: political development is above all “creating conditions, within an institutional framework, that are suitable to the solution of a wide field of social problems.”Guerrero, El Estado en la era de la modernización. Ciudad México (Plaza y Valdes Editores) 1992, p.40 - Guerrero refers above all to: Diamant, Alfred. Political Development: Approaches to Theory and Strategy. Washington,D.C.; Bloomington, Ind. (American Society for Public Administration / International Development Research Center, Indiana University) 1963. Guerrero further describes Diamant's position in this way: “A political system is engaged in a process of development if it can increase its capacity to attain successfully and continually new social goals and the creation of new types of organization.“Una sistema política está en proceso de desarrollo cuando puede incrementar su capacidad para lograr exitosa y continuamente nuevos tipos de metas sociales y la creacción de nuevos tipos de organización.” - Omar Guerrero, ibidem, p.42. Such political development that leads to new institutional frameworks which allow the population to address social grievances in a new way is currently characteristic of a number of societies in South America. Keith R. Legg termed Diamant’s approach that “view(ed) political development (…) as ‘a generic process of successfully sustaining new demands, goals and organizations in a flexible manner’(...)” “most useful.”Keith R. Legg, Politics in Modern Greece. Stanford CA (Stanford University Press) 1969, p.2. Tradition and innovation Diamant's insight that political institutions, despite their relative inertia, are not static but caught between the force of their ‘traditions’ and pressures for ‘innovation,’ and that for this very reason they reveal both their quality as ‘historical result’ (Resultatcharakter) and as a ‘historical process’ (Prozesscharakter) is perhaps the most significant feature of his critical approach that “modified” Max Weber's comprehension of bureaucracies in contemporary society.The distinction between ‘Resultatcharakter’ and ‘Prozesscharakter’ can of course be traced back to the Grundrisse of Marx (to whom even his critic Weber was indebted). This insight is at the root of his careful arguments in favor of improvement, innovation and development. A strong belief in social justice Easily applied labels are not helpful in describing the human (rather than narrowly political) stand that Alfred Diamant was taking, both as citizen and as political scientist. Norman Furniss, a retired professor at Indiana University and a person who knew Alfred Diamant well, writes, that what was characteristic of him was “a belief that our country and our world can be more just and more decent” than they actually are.Norm Furniss, quoted in: World’s Apart, World’s United. A European-American Story. The Memoirs of Ann & Alfred Diamant, ed. by Alice Diamant. Bloomington, Ind. (Authorhouse) 2010, back cover. In this respect, he was very much like his wife, Ann, a feminist who had “a strong belief in social justice.”Iris Kiesling, quoted in: Alice Diamant (ed.), ibidem, back cover.

It operated within the Cheyenne Mountain Complex's Air Warning, Missile Correlation, Command Center, Space Control, and Operations Intelligence Watch Centers. The division assisted with establishing the integrated NORAD and USNORTHCOM Command Center at Peterson Air Force Base. Operational functions—such as monitoring for threats in the ocean, skies, and space—were moved to Peterson AFB from the Cheyenne Mountain Complex to reduce operating costs.

Learning experiences are recorded in a Learning Record Store (LRS). LRSs can exist within traditional learning management systems (LMSs) or on their own. Summary The Experience API (Tin Can API) is meant to succeed SCORM, the Sharable Content Object Reference Model, which has been the de facto e-learning standard for packaging e-learning content. There are several drawbacks to SCORM. The new Experience API allows trainers to deploy several new capabilities that were not supported with SCORM, such as: *Taking e-learning outside of the web browser *E-learning in native mobile applications *More control over learning content *Solid security using OAuth *Platform transition; e.g. start e-learning on a mobile device, finish it on a computer *The ability to track games and simulations *The ability to track real-world performance *Team-based e-learning *Tracking learning plans and goals The Experience API (Tin Can API) is an open source API. It is a Representational state transfer web service that uses JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) for its data format. The web service allows software clients to read and write experiential data in the form of “statement” objects. In their simplest form, statements are in the form of “I did this”, or more generally “actor verb object”. More complex statement forms can be used. There is also a built in query API to help filter recorded statements, and a state API that allows for a sort of “scratch space” for consuming applications. History In 2011 Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL), the United States Department of Defense-sponsored stewards of SCORM, recognized the need for a newer and more capable software specification than the original SCORM specification, which was then more than ten years old. To address the need, ADL issued a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) asking for assistance in improving SCORM, and the BAA was awarded to Rustici Software, a Nashville- based software company experienced with SCORM. Rustici Software conducted numerous interviews with the e-learning community to determine where to make improvements and then developed the research version of the Experience API specification. This process was called Project Tin Can. The moniker \\"Tin Can API\\" was derived from Project Tin Can, and is still used interchangeably with the name \\"Experience API\\".https://www.trainingindustry.com/wiki/entries/experience-api-%28tin-can- api%29.aspx The Experience API was developed by a community working group and released as version 1.0 in April 2013. There are currently over 160 adopters (19 January 2016). Current Status The current version of the specification is 1.0.3. Released early October 2016.https://www.adlnet.gov/newest-version- of-xapi-version-1-0-3/https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec There are no plans for any minor updates to the specification. https://www.adlnet.gov/interviewing-xapi-spec-group-organizer/ Previous versions include: 1.0.2., 1.0.1., 1.0.0. version 0.8 (official output of the BAA) and version 0.9 (research version specification) 0.95 (second research version specification).

All three of these species are characterised by having plentiful erect hair on the face and propodum. Distribution P. susterai is widespread in central and southern Europe but is difficult to distinguish from the more common P. perturbator. In Great Britain, it is widely distributed in southern and central England as far north as north-east Yorkshire and westwards to Wales and Cornwall. Habitat This species can be found in open woodland with dry soils, and avoids waterlogged areas. Biology In Great Britain the flight period is April to August, and the species overwinters as an adult. Due to confusion with P. perturbator, prey records of the two species (formerly considered a single species P. fuscus) are not reliable. However, it is probable that P. susterai preys on larger spiders of the families Lycosidae and Gnaphosidae. Although little is known about the nesting biology of P. susterai, like other Priocnemis wasps it probably excavates cells in pre-existing cavities. Like P. coriacea, the only flower it has been recorded nectaring at is wood spurge but it probably nectars at similar flowers with open corollas.

He was the great-great-grandfather, through his son Henry Hyde, of two British monarchs, Queen Mary II and Queen Anne. Origins He was the son of Robert Hyde of Norbury, Cheshire by his 2nd or 3rd wife Katherine Boydell, daughter of a certain Boydell of Pulcroft, Cheshire. Career During the reign of King Henry VIII he was a clerk in the auditor’s office of the Exchequer. He was first employed in Wiltshire by the influential Sir John Thynne of Longleat. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries he served as a commissioner for the surveying and suppression of chantries in Wiltshire and Salisbury in 1548. At some time before 1552 he was appointed auditor to Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford, uncle of King Edward VI. He served as surveyor of crown lands in Somerset after 1575. He was a JP for Dorset and/or Wiltshire in about 1589. He was elected MP for Malmesbury in 1559, Heytesbury in 1584 and possibly for Chippenham in 1586, which tenure may be confused with that of his son Lawrence II. Lands acquired His various positions enabled him to acquire much land, much due to the Dissolution of the Monasteries. In 1549 for about £1,250 He purchased lands in Bymerton, Milton, a house in Salisbury and elsewhere in Wiltshire, and small properties in Somerset, Derbyshire and Kent. His principal acquisitions included: *Dinton, Wiltshire, the rectory and advowson of which he acquired in 1585 from Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (1534–1601). His eldest son Robert I Hyde sold them in 1594 to his brother Sir Lawrence II Hyde (1562–1641), attorney-general to Anne of Denmark, wife of King James I. *West Hatch, acquired circa 1570 *Tisbury, acquired circa 1570 *Gussage St. Michael, purchased during the reign of King Edward VI (1547–1553) *Wardour Castle, Wiltshire, the lease of which he held for a short time before 1569 in right of his wife. Marriages Hyde married twice: *Firstly to Mary Hartgill, daughter of William Hartgill of Kilmington, Wiltshire (formerly in Somerset), by whom he had one son who predeceased him. *Secondly in about 1559 to Anne Sibell, daughter of Nicholas Sibell of Farningham, Kent, and widow of Matthew Colthurst (c.1517-1559), MP, of Wardour Castle, Wiltshire and Claverton, Somerset. She brought with her \\"a fair fortune\\", in the form of an inheritance from her former husband, consisting mainly of lands in Wiltshire. By Anne he had at least two daughters, one Joanna married Edward Younge of Durnford in Wiltshire in Tisbury in 1585, and the following sons: **Robert Hyde, eldest son and heir **Henry Hyde (c.1563-1634), MP, father of Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon (1609–1674). **Sir Lawrence Hyde (1562–1641), Attorney-general to Anne of Denmark, wife of King James I. **Sir Nicholas Hyde (c.1572–1631), Lord Chief Justice of England.

Interior The church lies in the eastern part of the old city, near the Tomb of Galerius (the \\"Rotunda\\"), at the junction of Iasonidou and Arrianou streets. Its current dedication to Saint Panteleimon was given to the church after the end of Ottoman rule in 1912, and its original dedication is therefore disputed. In Ottoman times, it was converted into a mosque in 1548 and became known as Ishakiye Camii (\\"Mosque of Ishak [Isaac]\\"), which in the prevailing scholarly interpretation points to an identification with the late Byzantine Monastery of the Virgin Peribleptos, also known as the Monastery of Kyr Isaac after its founder Jacob, who was the city's metropolitan bishop in 1295–1315 and became a monk with the monastic name of Isaac. A counter-argument however supports the theory that the present church is unrelated to the Peribleptos Monastery, and that it was converted into a mosque ca. 1500, when the city's kadı (judge), was Ishak Çelebi, whom the mosque was named after. However, the church's architecture and decoration, which date to the late 13th/early 14th centuries, appear to support the former view. The church is of the tetrastyle cross-in-square type, with a narthex and a (now destroyed) ambulatory that is connected to two chapels (still extant). Very few of the building's original wall paintings survive. Ottoman remains include the base of the demolished minaret and a marble fountain.

He was a son of King Faisal and was one of the pioneers in the establishment of Islamic banking. Early life and education Mohammed bin Faisal was born in Taif in 1937. He was the second child and eldest son of the Saudi Arabian King Faisal and Iffat Al Thunayan. His full siblings were Sara bint Faisal, Latifa bint Faisal, Saud bin Faisal, Abdul Rahman bin Faisal, Bandar bin Faisal, Turki bin Faisal, Luluwah bint Faisal and Haifa bint Faisal. Mohammed also had half-siblings from his fathers other marriages, including Abdullah and Khalid. Mohammed bin Faisal was the first of his siblings to study abroad. He attended both Lawrenceville School and Hun School. Then, he graduated from Swarthmore College in 1961. In 1963 he earned his bachelor of science degree in business administration at Menlo College in California. Early career Mohammed bin Faisal began his career in 1963 at the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA). In 1964, he was transferred to the ministry of water and agriculture. Next he was appointed director of saline water conversion department at the ministry in 1970. He was instrumental in the establishment of the water desalination program. He was later named deputy minister of water and agriculture responsible for saline water affairs in 1974. He was also named as the governor of the newly founded saline water conversion corporation in November 1974. He resigned from office in July 1977. Business activities Mohammed bin Faisal began to deal with business after his resignation. During this period he financially supported a study about the feasibility of bringing Antarctic icebergs to Mecca. He established a firm for this objective, Iceberg Transport International. On 17 October 1977, he presented his proposal at a conference in London. His plan was the most promising scheme discussed at the conference. However, the findings of the study indicated that it was not feasible, since no iceberg could survive if it passes the equator. His most significant investments were in the fields of banking and finance, making him one of the pioneers in Islamic banking. Being one of the Saudi nationals, who invested in Egypt, he was the founder of the Faisal Islamic Bank of Egypt that was established in Cairo in 1977. The bank was officially launched in 1979. The Sudan branch of the bank was also opened in 1977. He founded Dar Al Maal Al Islami Trust (the DMI group) in 1981. It was established in Geneva that is the international Islamic finance organisation and a parent institution for 55 Islamic banks. The DMI group is a Bahamas-incorporated holding company with a portfolio of Islamic banks in Bahrain, Niger, Egypt and Pakistan. In Pakistan it was named the Islamic Investment Company of Pakistan. Then he founded Faisal Private Bank in 1990 that is the pioneer banking institution in Islamic finance industry. Prince Mohammed was the chairman of its board of directors and of the Islamic Finance Group. Faisal Private Bank has several branches in different countries, including Switzerland. Its Switzerland branch was granted full banking license by the Swiss Federal Banking Commission (FINMA) in August 2006. Prince Mohammed was also the former president of Jeddah-based Islamic Development Bank, which was founded in 1975. In addition to banking sector, Prince Mohammed had other business enterprises. He was a shareholder of Saudi and Gulf Enterprise Ltd. based in Jeddah. =Other positions= Mohammed bin Faisal established Al Manarat International Schools which have branches in Saudi Arabia and in other countries. He was the chairman of the board of trustees of the King Faisal Foundation. He was also a member of Effat University's board of founders and of trustees. Controversy Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the families of the victims launched a lawsuit against Prince Mohammed along with two other members of the House Saud, namely late Prince Sultan and Prince Turki, in addition to other people whom they accused of financing Al Qaeda. In 2009, further evidence was gathered by the families. A Washington lawyer, Michael Kellogg, represented Prince Mohammed in the lawsuit. Personal life and death Mohammed bin Faisal was married to Muna bint Abdul Rahman bin Azzam Pasha, daughter of Azzam Pasha. He had three children: Amr, Maha and Reem. His son Prince Amr is also a businessman dealing with finance. His daughter Reem is a well-known photographer. Mohammed bin Faisal was the winner of the 2007 IDB Prize in Islamic Banking and Finance which is awarded by Islamic Research and Training Institute of the Islamic Development Bank.

Constructed in 1819 among 26 Seaman's hospitals chartered by an Act of Congress in 1791, the building is the oldest hospital in the state of Georgia, and was used as such until 1980. The building served as both a Confederate and Union hospital during the Civil War. Several tenants occupied the building sporadically from 1980 until 2009. In 2012, the Historic Preservation Board approved Savannah Law School's comprehensive restoration of the 110,000 square foot facility. The renovations met federal historic preservation standards and were completed in 2014. The project represents one of the largest efforts to restore an historic property in the United States. In 2015, The Victorian Society in America and the Savannah Historic Preservation Board honored Savannah Law School with Preservation Awards for the renovation. The building was sold to Savannah College of Art and Design in 2018 and precipitated the shutdown of the law school.http://www.savannahnow.com/news/20180321/savannah-law-school- to-close-after-spring-semester The Candler Oak Tree is located on the campus.

Biography Uberto Gambara was born in Brescia on January 23, 1489, the son of Gianfrancesco Gambara and Alda Pio di Carpi. Veronica Gambara was his sister. When he was 10 years old, he was destined for a career in the church. He was named provost of Verolanuova and chaplain of San Giacomo in 1502. He briefly left the ecclesiastical state, fighting alongside his brother Brunoro in the French army of Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours then invading Brescia. He then reentered the ecclesiastical estate, traveling to Rome during the pontificate of Pope Leo X. The pope named him nuncio to the Kingdom of Portugal, a post he would continue to occupy during the papacies of Pope Adrian VI and Pope Clement VII. The latter pope then named him nuncio to the court of Francis I of France. In 1527, he became nuncio to the Kingdom of England. There, he coordinated with the papal legate to England, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, Archbishop of York. On December 15, 1527, he carried Cardinal Wolsey's letter to Pope Clement VII in which Wolsey secretly expressed his wish to be granted special powers allowing him to annul the marriage of Henry VIII of England and Catherine of Aragon, thus allowing the king to marry Anne Boleyn. Pope Clement VII was imprisoned by imperial troops following the Sack of Rome (1527). During this period, Gambara traveled to Paris to attempt to raise military assistance to free the pontiff. On May 8, 1528, he was elected bishop of Tortona, coinciding with the pope naming him governor of Bologna, holding this post until 1533. He was present at the imperial coronation of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in Bologna on February 24, 1530. At the end of his governorship, he was finally consecrated as a bishop in February 1533 in Bologna by Gian Matteo Giberti, Bishop of Verona. Coat of arms of Cardinal Uberto Gambara In 1539, Pope Paul III made him vicar of Rome. He then made him a cardinal priest in the consistory of December 19, 1539. He received the red hat and the titular church of San Silvestro in Capite on January 28, 1540. He opted for the titular church of San Martino ai Monti on March 23, 1541. On January 9, 1542, he was named administrator of the see of Policastro, resigning that administration on June 7, 1543. He was the papal legate in Parma and Piacenza from January 27, 1542 until March 5, 1544. He opted for the titular church of Sant'Apollinare alle Terme Neroniane-Alessandrine on February 15, 1542 and then for San Crisogono on October 17, 1544. He was the Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals, January 9, 1545 to January 8, 1546. He was then sent to France, returning to Rome on December 16, 1547. On March 22, 1548, he resigned the government of the see of Tortona in favor of his nephew, Cesare Gambara. He then traveled to Genoa, returning to Rome on January 5, 1549. He died in Rome on February 14, 1549. His remains were returned to Brescia and he was buried in Santa Maria delle Grazie.

Born in Eastbourne, East Sussex, Hobden was educated at Millfield School and Eastbourne College. A police investigation into his death concluded in May 2016 with no further action or arrests.  Career  As a youngster, Hobden played for Glynde & Beddingham Cricket Club; in 2009, he was part of the team that won the National Village Cricket Knockout Final at Lord's. In 2012, Hobden started playing for Preston Nomads Cricket Team, and was part of the team that won the 2012 Sussex Premier League. Hobden's last match for the Nomads was in August 2015, where he returned figures of 1/6 from 7 overs. While studying for a degree in Business Economics at Cardiff Metropolitan University, Hobden made his debut in first-class cricket for Cardiff MCCU against Somerset at Taunton Vale Sports Club Ground in 2012. He made a second first-class appearance that season against Warwickshire at Edgbaston, taking five wickets with figures of 5/62 in Warwickshire's first-innings. He also played club cricket for Ynysygerwn. Hobden also played Second XI cricket for Sussex, and a day after signing a junior professional contract, he made his List A debut in a YB40 match against Nottinghamshire, with figures of 1/39 off 8 overs. In July 2013, he sustained a shin injury which ruled him out of the rest of the 2013 season. In May 2014, Hobden signed a professional contract with Sussex. He made his County Championship debut on 1 June 2014, with match figures of 4/136. After the match, Hobden praised James Anyon, Jon Lewis and Steve Magoffin for encouraging him. Hobden was sidelined for a long spell of the 2014 season. In April 2015, Hobden scored 65* in a Sussex record tenth- wicket partnership of 164 with Ollie Robinson. In May 2015, Hobden was criticised after bowling 14 no-balls in a County Championship match against Middlesex, with 11 no-balls in the opening 16 overs. The then Sussex captain Ed Joyce defended him, saying \\"I think Matt will be a fantastic cricketer for Sussex in the future but he is still young and learning his trade at the moment\\", and then coach Mark Robinson said that: \\"This is Matt’s first full year as a professional and we rate him highly\\", and \\"in terms of his long-term future what happened in the Middlesex game could turn out to be brilliant for him as it helps mould who you are.\\" In the 2015 season, he took 21 wickets at an average of 47.30, and his last appearance was in a List A match against Essex in August 2015. In total, Hobden played 18 first-class matches, three List A matches and one Twenty20 match, and was selected as one of six fast bowlers selected for the Potential England Performance Programme (PEPP) in the winters of 2014/15 and 2015/16, working with the senior team. Death and tributes Hobden died suddenly on 2 January 2016, aged 22, in Forres, Scotland. Initially the local police treated his death as unexplained, stating \\"Enquiries are at a very early stage but there are not thought to be any suspicious circumstances.\\" In May 2016 the investigation concluded, finding, according to newspaper reports, that \\"he was asleep on the roof of a mansion in Forres before tragically falling to his death. It is understood that with friends they had gone up on to the roof the previous evening to look at the stars.\\" His death was announced by Sussex County Cricket Club, who said that \\"Matthew was an exciting young cricketer with a big future ahead of him in the game.\\" Speaking after Hobden's death, England fast bowling coach Kevin Shine said, \\"his potential was huge. He was improving rapidly and I'm certain that he would have played for England\\", and about his performance on the PEPP that, \\"he was the strongest, most powerful cricketer I've ever seen on that programme\\". The England Cricket Team official Facebook page posted, \\"we are shocked and saddened to hear of the death of Matthew Hobden. Our thoughts are with his family, friends and team-mates.\\" Out of respect for Hobden, England players wore black armbands during the second day of the 2nd Test against South Africa on 3 January. Angus Porter, head of the Professional Cricketers' Association described Hobden as \\"a young seamer with immense potential.\\" Sussex County Cricket Club announced that Hobden's shirt number (19) would be retired, and a tree would be planted at the County Ground in memory of Hobden.

Common Language products combine numerics and mnemonics to establish naming conventions that telecommunication companies use to exchange critical information via Operations Support Systems and other interface mechanisms. Common Language codes help communications companies name, locate, inventory and manage all aspects of their networks. They identify items as large as a building, as small as a single board in a digital switching machine and as complex as a customer circuit. Telcordia manages the registry for all Common Language codes on behalf of the telecommunication service providers industry. Common Language code sets are recognized by industry standards bodies and organizations, including ATIS, ANSI, IETF, and ETSI.  Common Language Codes  Following are Common Language codes used by the telecommunications industry. = CLEI Codes = Common Language Equipment Identifier or CLEI code is an industry standard, globally unique identifier for telecommunications equipment with a uniform feature-oriented classification. CLEI codes must be acquired by telecommunications equipment manufacturers and assigned to devices before they are sold to a licensed service provider. = CLLI Codes = A Common Language Location Identification or CLLI code identifies buildings that contain telephony equipment, network facilities housed in those buildings and non-building sites such as poles and manholes. By labeling the equipment functionality, office number, city, and state in a CLLI code, a telecommunication company’s central office can keep this information on and immediately reference any particular item when necessary. This information can be used for making repairs, replacing old equipment, ordering phone service, recovering call detail records, and assisting in tracing calls. = CLCI S/S = Special Service Circuit or CLCI S/S codes provide a coded designation for a service that is dedicated and billed to a particular customer. = CLCI MSG = Message Trunk Circuit or CLCI MSG codes provide a naming scheme for message trunk circuits. These codes identify individual trunks and trunk groups by number, office class, traffic use, trunk type modifier, signaling, and the originating and terminating office locations. = CLFI = Common Language Facility Identification or CLFI Codes provide a standard, mnemonic naming scheme to uniquely identify cable and transmission facilities between two standardized equipment nodes (identified via CLEI codes) within a network. It comprises facility designation, facility type, channel/pair/time slot, location of facility terminal A and location of facility terminal Z. = NC/NCI = Network Channel/Network Channel Interface or NC/NCI codes are used to communicate technical attributes of services, facilities and their associated interfaces to support interconnections between telecommunications service providers through the use of the Access Service Request (ASR) process. =Service Order Process= The service order process utilizes the USOC, USO and Field Identifiers (FIDs), to provision, bill and maintain services and equipment. Universal Service Order or USO Codes are used by telecommunications service providers to collect and structure all the information needed for service activation, including ordering, provisioning, service assurance and billing. USOC codes, also known as rate elements, are used by telecommunications service providers to identify each billable element of a customer’s service. Field Identifiers or FIDs are used by telecommunications service providers to identify a billing preference or attribute of a customer’s account.

The dam impounds the White River and is used for flood control. The dam was finished in 1948 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, although the project had been authorized by an act of Congress in June 1936. Construction had begun in 1939 and was delayed by World War II. At 432 feet high, it was the highest rock- and earth-filled dam in the world at its completion. Mud Mountain Dam protects the lower White and Puyallup River valleys from flooding by holding back water from heavy rains or excessive snow melt and slowly releasing it downstream. From the 1870s local farmers of King and Pierce County competed for water from the White River, dealing not only with periodic flooding but with changes in its channel, notably in 1906 when the White permanently broke through to the shorter, southward channel of the Stuck River. Consultation with the engineer Hiram M. Chittenden eventually led to the decision to dam the river. The created reservoir, Mud Mountain Lake, is a riverine, marshy intermittent lake. The lake is usually dry except for the normal flow of the White River, but it fills with water during periods of high flow. The Corps of Engineers operates a day-use park at the dam site, the Mud Mountain Recreational Area, with picnic facilities, interpretive exhibits, and ten miles of hiking trails.

Early life and education Born in Chicago, Illinois, Subeck graduated from Rich Central High School in Olympia Fields, Illinois. She then earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1993.  Career  Prior to her election to the State Assembly, she worked as the Executive Director of United Wisconsin. Before that, she worked as the Executive Director of NARAL Pro-Choice Wisconsin; as a Program Coordinator for the YWCA's housing and homelessness programs; and as a Program Manager with the Head Start and Early Head Start program. =Politics= Subeck is a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 78th District on the far west side of Madison. She previously served on the Madison Common Council, representing the 1st district, which covers the southwest corner of the City. Madison Common Council Subeck was elected to her first term on the Madison Common Council on April 8, 2011, beating Brian Driscoll by 2573 votes to 1837 (58% to 41%). There was no incumbent in the race. She had previously run in 2005 for the same position and lost in the April general election to Jed Sanborn, 1033 votes to 714 (59% to 41%). In 2011, Subeck and fellow Alder Matthew Phair introduced a series of budget amendments to address crime, gang and drug violence in the Southwest section of Madison. The budget amendments included $30,000 for police overtime as part of a community safety initiative, $900,000 for the purchase and rehabilitation of a vacant restaurant building for a community center, funding for a spray park, and $60,000 for an additional building inspector to work in deteriorating neighborhoods. A majority of the items were passed in the 2012 budget. A spray park opened at Elver Park in 2014, and after two years of negotiations, the City of Madison purchased the former Griff's restaurant and is developing final plans for its use to focus on youth, job training, and employment. In January 2012, Subeck joined five other alders in calling for fellow Alder Solomon to resign over allegations he sexually harassed and assaulted an assistant city clerk in January 2012. After a lengthy investigation the city’s civil rights office found no proof that Solomon had sexually harassed the assistant city clerk and determined not to press charges. Solomon remained in office. In 2013, Subeck worked with the Mayor to lead an effort to pass new campaign finance disclosure rules that exceed what is required by state law, requiring corporations and other entities making independent expenditures to disclose not only their campaign spending but also their donors who contributed to expenditures for or against a candidate in a city election. Wisconsin State Assembly On November 4, 2014, Subeck was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly as a Democrat. She won a Democratic Primary against fellow City Council member Mark Clear before running uncontested in the general election. Subeck was reelected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 2016 and again in 2018.

The first model was introduced in 1960, and the final model was discontinued in the 1970s. It was targeted at the professional press photography market, and a wide array of accessories was offered. The maximum image size that can be captured is 6 cm × 9 cm, but images can be taken in a number of different formats, and using several types of film. All of the lenses have leaf shutters, which are released on the lens itself, not through the body as is typical with most cameras. The shutter is typically triggered from one of several models of removable grips, all of which have a built-in release cable. The lenses also have flash sync terminals.

He was one of the closest collaborators of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, both as Bishop of Parma and afterwards when he became Pope Paul III. He served the pope as Vicar of Rome, and Prefect of the Tribunal of the Signature of Justice, as well as a member of several ad hoc commissions of cardinals. He was Bishop of Teramo (1539–1542) and Bishop of Lucca (1546–1549). He was one of the organizers and leading officers of the Council of Trent. Biography Bartolomeo Guidiccioni was born in Lucca in 1470, the son of a patrician family.Salvador Miranda, The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, Guidiccioni, Bartolomeo; retrieved: 4 February 2019. At the age of nineteen, his father sent him to study at the University of Pisa and the University of Bologna, where he studied civil law for seven years. At the conclusion of his studies, he returned to Lucca, intending to practice law, but the town was oversupplied with lawyers and he could not establish a practice.Schweitzer, pp. 30, with p. 30 note 6: Anno etatis meae decimo nono...ad grave, vafrum, nodosum, enygmatibus plenum civile ius audiendum me contuli...septem annos partim Pisis partim Bononiae contrivi. He therefore went to Rome, where he was disappointed to discover that civil law meant little, in contrast to Canon Law and the rules of the Apostolic Chancery. His lack of funds made study difficult.Schweitzer, p. 31, with note 2: premebat patrimonii tenuitas..., nulla opis spes dabatur.... Finally, through the influence of Felinus Sandaeus, a jurisconsult and Auditor of the Rota, he obtained a position in the household of Cardinal Franciotto Galeotto della Rovere, the nephew of Pope Julius II. Guidiccioni also became the governor of Farfa Abbey between 1506 and 1508, but he was dismissed in 1508 a few months before the Cardinal's death. Schweitzer, pp. 33-34. He later wrote a treatise, De beneficiis ecclesiasticis, which has not been published. He studied the human sciences, theology, and law in Rome. He became a Protonotary Apostolic.Schweitzer, p. 155 note 2. =Vicar-General of Parma= At Rome, he entered the household of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, seniore, the future Pope Paul III. On 28 March 1509, Cardinal Farnese was named Bishop of Parma by Pope Julius II. On 8 November 1509 he appointed Guidiccioni to be his vicar general in the diocese.Schweitzer, p. 36. His most notable action as Vicar came as a result of the condemnation of a witch to be burned at the stake. When she was handed over to the civil government of Parma to carry out the sentence, the Podestà refused, even under threat of excommunication to burn the victim, the Inquisitor of Parma appealed to the Vicar General, who supported him. The Podestà appealed to the government in Milan, which supported the Vicar and Inquisitor, and the woman was burned.Schweitzer, pp. 38-39. Guidiccioni also supported the principle of the exemption of the clergy from the jurisdiction of the civil courts. He issued a vigorous decision in October 1513, which the city felt compelled to appeal to the Pope. Pope Leo X firmly supported Guidiccioni.Schweitzer, pp. 39-40. In 1516 Cardinal Farnese came to Parma, and conducted a formal visitation and issued a new set of constitutions. When he returned to Rome, the Vicar General Guidiccioni continued the visitations down through October 1516.Schweitzer, p. 41. He later wrote a treatise, De visitatione, in four handwritten folio volumes; it has not been published. Farnese returned in 1519, and held a diocesan synod in November. Guidiccioni held the post of Vicar General for a total of nineteen years. In 1528 he returned to Parma, and then retired to a villa in Carignano.Schweitzer, pp. 42-45. In 1529, Cardinal Farnese visited Lucca during a trip to Genoa, and stayed at the house of the Guidiccioni. He also visited the retreat at Carignano several times.Schweitzer, p. 49, with note 2. On the election of Cardinal Farnese as Pope Paul III on 13 October 1534, Guidiccioni was sent by the city of Lucca to Rome as one of the members of its congratulatory embassy.Schweitzer, p. 47. He returned to Lucca, but on 3 February 1535 Paul III wrote to him, summoning him to Rome. He was in Rome from March until May, consulting about Paul's plans for a general council of the Church.Schweitzer, pp. 50-51. He returned to Lucca, where he worked on his treatises De bonis et rebus donatis ecclesiae and De annatis, beneficiis ecclesiasticis, spoliis, taxis, compositionibus. This was an important reform work, intended to help the Pope in preparing the agenda for the council.Schweitzer, p. 143. But Pope Paul wanted him in Rome. Guidiccioni wrote to the Pope, Luca vale, revocat nos marcia curia, Paulus sic iubet, en iussus non rediturus.'Farewell, Lucca. Curial business summons us back. That's what Paul orders, and see, having been ordered I will not return.' Guidiccioni served as a datary from spring 1536 to 1539.Schweitzer, p. 146. On 23 July 1536, he was appointed, along with Cardinals Sadoleto, Cortese, Fregoso, Giberti and Carafa, to make preparations for the council. In August, however, he asked to resign, and on 17 August the Pope consented.Schweitzer, p. 142-143. It was perhaps at this time that he wrote Consilium quatuor delectorum cardinalium, though the earliest reference to it comes in 1538: Schweitzer, p. 152. =Bishop and Cardinal= In November 1539 Guidiccioni was named Papal Vicar, in place of the recently deceased Paolo Capizucchi, and took up the office on 28 November. He served as Papal Vicar of Rome from 1539 to 1542.Schweitzer, p. 153, with note 1: 22 Novembris [1539] Dominus Bartholoinaeus Guidiccionus Lucensis fuit factus vicarius Papae et adeptus est possessionem officii die 28 [Novembris]. Guidiccioni was elected bishop of Teramo on 12 December 1539. He was not consecrated a bishop until 1546, and was therefore termed Administrator of the diocese of Teramo.Palma, III, p. 15. Eubel, pp. 27, column 1; 112 with note 5. On 16 December 1539, he was granted the faculty of taking possession of the diocese. He did not visit the diocese during his episcopacy, but governed through a Vicar General, Msgr. Giubbileo Arca, Canon of Narni, assisted by economi and procurators. Arca was succeeded by Giovanni Francesco Corradi. Guidiccioni resigned on 22 March 1542.Palma, III, p. 15. Schweitzer, pp. 156-158. Eubel, p. 112. One week after he was named Bishop of Teramo, the pope made him a cardinal priest in the consistory of 19 December 1539.Eubel, p. 27 no. 34, with note 1. Schweitzer, p. 155, note 3: 17 Decembris [1539] fuit consistorium, quod productum est usque ad primam horam noctis, in quo fuit tractatum de creatione cardinalium cum magna patrum altercatione. — Die 19 Decembris [1539] fuit consistorium, quod productum est usque ad horam secundam noctis, in quo non sine patrum controversia Papa creavit XII cardinales et ex eis publicavit XI, qui fuere . . . Bartholomäus Guidiccionus, electus Aprutinus, vicarius urbis. He received the red hat and the titular church of San Cesareo in Palatio on 28 January 1540.Eubel, p. 61 column 2. In September 1539, he was appointed a member of a congregation of three cardinals to approve the establishment of the Society of Jesus. He was a dissenting voice on the congregation, questioning whether yet another religious order was needed or appropriate, and whether it might lead to strife rather than harmony.Schweitzer, p. 160 note 1, quoting from Guidiccini's De Concilio: Quam sacra est religio et quam laudabilis trium votorum professio profitentiumque multiplicatio, tam improbanda et reprehendenda videtur nimia diversitas et assidua contentio, rixatores magis quam religiosi videntur. Si apostolus, qui Corinthiorum aliquos audiens dicentes: ego sum Christi exclamabat indignus: numquid Paulus cruxifixus est pro vobis? Numquid in nomine Pauli baptizati estis? Quid diceret, si nunc scissuras contentiones, rixas, quo inter eos vigent, videret vel audiret? Deus autor pacis det omnibus idipsum sapere, ut non querant, que sua sunt, sed omnes glorifieent Deum Patrem, qui in celis est. But after the pope issued the papal bull Regimini militantis Ecclesiae approving the order, Cardinal Guidiccioni became a strong supporter. On 17 February 1540, Pope Paul III named Cardinal Guidiccioni to the office of Prefect of the Signature of Justice (a court of appeal in the Roman Curia).Schweitzer, p. 189, with note 1: die 17 Februarii [1540] Papa dcdit signaturam iustitiae, quam Cardinalis Campegius et Simonetta habuerant, Guidicciono. On 27 August 1540, he was named along with Cardinal Alessandro Cesarini and Cardinal Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte to a commission to study reform of the Roman Rota.Schweitzer, p. 189, with note 1. =Offices in the Roman Curia= On 22 March 1542, he resigned the government of Teramo because his duties in Rome made him unable to visit it. On 21 July 1542, following the issue of his Bull Licet ab initio, Pope Paul named six cardinals, Gian Pietro Carafa, Juan Alvarez de Toledo, Pier Paolo Parisio, Bartolommeo Guidiccioni, Dionisio Laurerio, and Tommaso Badia inquisitors general of the Roman Inquisition.Schweitzer, p. 196. On 5 January 1543, the pope named him to a commission to study church reform. On 17 March 1543, Cardinal Guidiccioni and twelve other cardinals accompanied the pope to Bologna. He was one of eight cardinals appointed on 11 May 1543 to a commission to manage the affairs of the upcoming Council of Trent. He opted for the titular church of Santa Prisca on 24 September 1543.Eubel, p. 69. column 1. He served as administrator of the see of Chiusi from 2 April 1544 until 20 February 1545.Schweitzer, p. 158. Eubel, p. 171. On 2 November 1544, the pope officially made him a member of the upcoming Council of Trent. The council officially began on 13 December 1545. Shortly after the start of the council, on 26 May 1546, Cardinal Guidiccioni was transferred to the see of Lucca.Eubel, p. 229. He finally received episcopal consecration from the hands of Cardinal Rodolfo Pio da Carpi in the Sistine Chapel on 28 August 1546, with Cristoforo Spiriti, Bishop of Cesena, and Giovanni Giacomo Barba, Bishop of Teramo, serving as co-consecrators. From 7 January 7, 1547 to 13 January 1548, he was Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals.Eubel, p. 85, column 1. The office, which managed the income of the cardinals as a group, was held for one year, and cardinals served in rotation as Chamberlain, according to the regulations of Pope Leo X: Eubel, p. 81, column 2. He also served as Major Penitentiary from 1547 to 1549.The authority for this statement is the memorial inscription set up in the cathedral of Lucca by Bishop Alessandro Guidiccioni, Cardinal Bartolomeo's nephew and successor. Guidiccioni succeeded Cardinal Roberto Pucci (1545-1547). Cardinal Guidiccioni died in Rome on 4 November 1549, six days before the death of his friend Paul III.Schweitzer, p. 201-202. His remains were transferred to Lucca and he was buried in Lucca Cathedral. He was the author of numerous treatises, which are preserved in manuscript in the Barberini collection. Twenty volumes of his work on civil law and canon law are kept in the Vatican Library.Cardella, p. 229. Schweitzer, passim in various notes.

A substrate is enriched with a heavier stable isotope that is consumed by the organisms to be studied. Biomarkers with the heavier isotopes incorporated into them can be separated from biomarkers containing the more naturally abundant lighter isotope by isopycnic centrifugation. For example, 13CO2 can be used to find out which organisms are actively photosynthesizing or consuming new photosynthate. As the biomarker, DNA with 13C is then separated from DNA with 12C by centrifugation. Sequencing the DNA identifies which organisms were consuming existing carbohydrates and which were using carbohydrates more recently produced from photosynthesis. When DNA is the biomarker, SIP can be performed using isotopically labeled C, H, O, or N, though 13C is used most often. A weaker DNA buoyant density shift is observed when 15N- versus 13C-labeled substrates were used in pure culture. Conversely, a very strong buoyant density shift was observed when both labels were used.

The 30 July 2012 blackout affected over 400 million people and was briefly the largest power outage in history by number of people affected, beating the January 2001 blackout in Northern India (230 million affected). The blackout on 31 July is the largest power outage in history. The outage affected more than 620 million people, about 9% of the world population, or half of India's population, spread across 22 states in Northern, Eastern, and Northeast India. An estimated 32 gigawatts of generating capacity was taken offline. Of the affected population, 320 million initially had power, while the rest lacked direct access. Electric service was restored in the affected locations between 31 July and 1 August 2012.  Background  India is the world's third largest producer and consumer of electricity after United States and China; however, the electrical infrastructure is generally considered unreliable. The northern electrical grid had previously collapsed in 2001. In 2012, an estimated 27% of energy generated was lost in transmission or stolen, while peak supply fell short of demand by an average of 9%. During that period, the nation suffered from frequent power outages that lasted as long as 10 hours and about 25% of the population, about 300 million people, had no electricity at all. Efforts are underway to reduce transmission and distribution losses and increase production.  Sequence of events  = 30 July = At 02:35 IST (21:05 UTC on 29 July), circuit breakers on the 400 kV Bina-Gwalior line tripped. As this line fed into the Agra-Bareilly transmission section, breakers at the station also tripped, and power failures cascaded through the grid. All major power stations were shut down in the affected states, causing an estimated shortage of 32 GW. Officials described the failure as \\"the worst in a decade\\". On the day of the collapse, Power Minister Sushilkumar Shinde stated that the exact cause of the failure was unknown, but that at the time of the failure, electricity use was \\"above normal\\". He speculated that some states had attempted to draw more power than permitted due to the higher consumption. Spokesperson for PowerGrid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) and the Northern Regional Load Dispatch Centre (NRLDC) stated that Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana were the states responsible for the overdraw. PGCIL's chairman also stated that electrical service was restored \\"at a record time\\". A senior director for an Indian power company described the outage as \\"a fairly large breakdown that exposed major technical faults in India's grid system. Something went terribly wrong which caused the backup safety systems to fail.\\" More than 300 million people, about 25% of India's population, were without power. Railways and some airports were shut down until 08:00. The busiest airport in South Asia, Delhi Airport, continued functioning because it switched to back-up power in 15 seconds. The outage caused \\"chaos\\" for Monday morning rush hour, as passenger trains were shut down and traffic signals were non-operational. Trains stalled for three to five hours. Several hospitals reported interruptions in health services, while others relied on back-up generators. Water treatment plants were shut down for several hours, and hundreds of thousands people were unable to draw water from wells powered by electric pumps. The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) stated that the blackout had \\"severely impacted\\" businesses, leaving many unable to operate. Oil refineries in Panipat, Mathura and Bathinda continued operating because they have their own captive power stations within the refineries and do not depend on the grid. It took 15 hours to restore 80% of service. = 31 July = The system failed again at 13:02 IST (07:32 UTC), due to a relay problem near the Taj Mahal. As a result, power stations across the affected parts of India again went offline. NTPC Ltd. stopped 38% of its generation capacity. Over 60 crore (600 million) people (nearly half of India's population), in 22 out of 28 states in India, were without power. More than 300 intercity passenger trains and commuter lines were shut down as a result of the power outage. The worst affected zones in the wake of the power grid's collapse were Northern, North Central, East Central, and East Coast railway zones, with parts of Eastern, South Eastern and West Central railway zones. The Delhi Metro suspended service on all six lines, and had to evacuate passengers from trains that stopped mid-journey, helped by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority. About 200 miners were trapped underground in eastern India due to lifts failing, but officials later said they had all been rescued. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), not normally mandated to investigate blackouts, began to do so because of the threat to basic infrastructure facilities like railways, metro rail system, lifts in multi-storey buildings, and movement of vehicular traffic. The following states were affected by the grid failure: * states on the northern grid: Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand * states on the eastern grid: Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Sikkim * states on the northeast grid: Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura The following regions were not directly affected by the power outage: * Narora, Renukoot and Simbhaoli in Uttar Pradesh * parts of Delhi such as Badarpur * areas served by Sterlite and Ib Thermal Power Station (most of western Odisha) * most of the Kolkata municipal area (CESC system) As of 2 August, Uttar Pradesh was being supplied about 7 GW power, while the demand was between 9 and 9.7 GW.  Prior disaster-proofing  Before the grid collapse, the private sector spent $29 billion to build their own independent power stations in order to provide reliable power to their factories. The five biggest consumers of electricity in India have private off-grid supplies. Indian companies have 35 GW of private off-grid generation capacity and plan to add another 33 GW to their off-grid capacity.  Reactions  On the day of the collapse, Power Minister Sushilkumar Shinde ordered a three-member panel to determine the reason for the failure and report on it in fifteen days. In response to criticism, he observed that India was not alone in suffering major power outages, as blackouts had also occurred in United States and Brazil within the previous few years. Washington Post described the failure as adding urgency to Indian Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh's plan for a US$400 billion overhaul of India's power grid. His plan calls for a further 76 gigawatts of generation by 2017, produced in part by nuclear power. Rajiv Kumar, secretary general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) said, \\"One of the major reasons for the collapse of the power grid is the major gap between demand and supply. There is an urgent need to reform the power sector and bring about infrastructural improvements to meet the new challenges of the growing economy.\\" On 1 August 2012, newly appointed Power Minister Veerappa Moily stated, \\"First thing is to stabilize the grid and it has to sustain. For that we will work out a proper strategy.\\" He declined to blame specific states, saying, \\"I don't want to start with the blame game.\\" Team Anna, the supporters of anti-corruption activist Anna Hazare, charged that this grid failure was a conspiracy to suppress the indefinite fast movement started on 25 July 2012 for the Jan Lokpal Bill and targeting Sharad Pawar. Some technology sources and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) proposed that another widespread outage could be prevented by integrated network of microgrids and distributed generation connected seamlessly with the main grid via a superior smart grid technology, which includes automated fault detection, islanding and self- healing of the network.  Investigation  The three-member investigation committee consisted of S. C. Shrivastava, A. Velayutham and A. S. Bakshi, and issued its report on 16 August 2012. It concluded that four factors were responsible for the two days of blackout: * Weak inter-regional power transmission corridors due to multiple existing outages (both scheduled and forced); * High loading on 400 kV Bina–Gwalior–Agra link; * Inadequate response by State Load Dispatch Centers (SLDCs) to the instructions of Regional Load Dispatch Centres (RLDCs) to reduce over-drawal by the Northern Region utilities and under-drawal/excess generation by the Western Region utilities; * Loss of 400 kV Bina–Gwalior link due to mis-operation of its protection system. The committee also offered a number of recommendations to prevent further failures, including an audit of the protection systems.

Rebecca was portrayed by actress Julie Gonzalo, and appeared on the show since its pilot episode, which first aired on June 13, 2012. A member of the Barnes family, the character originated in two episodes of the original series' season 12 (in which she was 4 years old), and also appeared in the TV reunion movie Dallas: J.R. Returns (which is not regarded as canon by the 2012 series). Pamela Rebecca was named after both her aunt, Pamela Barnes Ewing, and grandmother, Rebecca Barnes Wentworth. Storyline =Original Series= Pamela Rebecca is born off-screen in Dallas in 1985, as the daughter of Cliff Barnes and Afton Cooper. At the time of Rebecca's birth, Afton had left Dallas, and Cliff wasn't aware of her existence until 1989, when she appeared in the season 12 episodes \\"Yellow Brick Road\\" and \\"The Sound of Money\\". As Afton didn't want to acknowledge Cliff as the father of Pamela (at the time called \\"Pammie\\"), they soon leave Dallas again. =Dallas (2012 TV series)= Season 1 Pamela (using the alias \\"Rebecca Sutter\\") meets Christopher Ewing as part of a scheme along with her boyfriend Tommy to infiltrate the Ewing family. Tommy pretends he is \\"Rebecca's\\" brother and soon Christopher falls in love with Pamela and they get married. She becomes pregnant with twins. Christopher's ex-fiancée Elena Ramos begins dating John Ross Ewing III in the meantime. Soon, it is revealed that Pamela no longer wants to manipulate the Ewings, as she has fallen in love with Christopher, but Tommy threatens her. Later, in self-defense, Pamela shoots and kills Tommy, hiding the body. But the truth is revealed to everyone. Christopher files for divorce and lets Pamela know he will have her arrested and take her kids from her. He then gets engaged to Elena, who ended her engagement with John Ross because of his lies. It is revealed that Pamela is the daughter of Cliff Barnes and Afton Cooper in the season finale. She vows to her father that she will take down the Ewings and not let her heart get in the way this time. Season 2 Pamela schemes with John Ross to steal Ewing Energies from Christopher and Elena, but they eventually start sleeping together. However, their \\"relationship\\" ends when their fathers learn of this and disapprove. Their deal also ends when Christopher learns she got 10% of Ewing Energies and wants to make peace with Ewing family. Nevertheless, Christopher saves her from being set up by Frank, her co-worker. By now, John Ross has fallen in love with her. When John Ross attempts to make nice with her, he invites her to the rig to celebrate Christopher's success. However, Cliff Barnes and Harris Ryland arrange for the rig to be blown up, blackmailing Drew Ramos to do so. After the explosion, Pamela is rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery. Pamela suffers from an aortic aneurysm and she miscarries the twins. When J.R. informs her of Cliff's involvement in the explosion that killed their babies, Pamela refuses to believe it. She eventually discovers the truth when Cliff refers to her children as \\"collateral damage\\". She convinces her father to give her her Aunt Katherine's percentage in Barnes Global. Rebecca and John Ross marry in the episode \\"Love & Family\\" in order to ensure that John Ross has access to her shares in Cliff's company, but she makes it clear that she is marrying him for both love and revenge on Cliff. Season 3 Casting and creation (2012 series) In 2010, TNT (sister company to Warner Bros. Television, the current copyright owners of the series) announced they were producing a new updated Dallas series. It is a continuation of the original series and primarily centers around Sue Ellen and J.R.'s son John Ross Ewing III, and Bobby Ewing and Pam's adopted son Christopher Ewing, though various stars of the original series will be reprising their roles. Former cast members Larry Hagman, Linda Gray, and Patrick Duffy all agreed to return to the show and portray their original characters.

It is anchored by Boscov's, Dunham's Sports, Kohl's, and Michaels. History Development of the mall was delayed by earth moving operations and the discovery of coal. Fairlane Village was built on property owned by the Seitzinger Brothers, with its name coming from the Ford Fairlane car. The mall opened with anchors Boscov's, McCrory, and Woolco. Woolco later became Gee Bee, which was bought out by Value City in 1992. Boscov's outside tent collapsed due to inclement weather in July 1986, with only light injuries occurring. In 1995, the Boscov's store was heavily reconstructed. ERE Yarmouth Retail began running the mall in 1998. The Claverton Corp. sold the mall to Equity Investment Group in 2000. EigFairlane Village Mall LLC sold Fairlane Village Mall to A.M. Fairlane Village LLC in 2004. Levin Management took over running of the mall in 2006. Waldenbooks announced in late 2009 its store would be closing when it ran out of items, which it did in January 2010. The mall's movie theater (2 screens), after a series of owners including Carmike Cinemas, has been empty since 2010.

The Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository is a planned deep geological repository for the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel. It is near the Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant in the municipality of Eurajoki, on the west coast of Finland. It is being constructed by Posiva, and is based on the KBS-3 method of nuclear waste burial developed in Sweden by Svensk Kärnbränslehantering AB (SKB). The facility is expected to be operational in 2023.  History  After the Finnish Nuclear Energy Act was amended in 1994 to specify that all nuclear waste produced in Finland must be disposed of in Finland, Olkiluoto was selected in 2000 as the site for a (very) long-term underground storage facility for Finland's spent nuclear fuel. The facility, named \\"Onkalo\\" (meaning \\"small cave\\" or \\"cavity\\") is being built in the granite bedrock at the Olkiluoto site, about five kilometers from the power plants. The municipality of Eurajoki issued a building permit for the facility in August 2003 and excavation began in 2004. The site was selected after a long process, which started in 1983 with a screening of the whole Finnish territory. From 1993 until 2000, four prospective sites were examined: Romuvaara in Kuhmo, Kivetty in Äänekoski, Olkiluoto in Eurajoki and Hästholmen in Loviisa. Besides geological and environmental considerations, the opinions of local residents were also taken into account. Eurajoki and Loviisa were singled out for being the locations with the highest local support. The former also had more favorable geographic conditions, thus in 1999 Posiva proposed it to the Finnish government as the selected location. The municipality of Eurajoki confirmed its approval of the site, and the national government ratified the decision in May 2001. Posiva started construction of the site in 2004. The Finnish government issued the company a licence for constructing the final disposal facility on 12 November 2015. Posiva expects operations to begin in 2023.  Construction  Pilot cave at final depth. The facility was constructed by and will be operated by Posiva, a company owned by the two existing producers of nuclear power in Finland, Fortum and TVO. (Fennovoima, a company which is currently planning its first nuclear reactor, is not a stockholder of Posiva.) The facility's constructions plans are divided into four phases: * Phase 1 (2004–09) focused on excavation of the large access tunnel to the facility, spiraling downward to a depth of . * Phase 2 (2009–11) continued the excavation to a final depth of . The characteristics of the bedrock were studied in order to adapt the layout of the repository. ** In 2012, Posiva submitted an application for a license to construct the repository. The license was granted in November 2015. * Phase 3 (2015–17) construction of the repository * Phase 4, the encapsulation and burial of areas filled with spent fuel, is projected to begin around 2020. Once in operation, the disposal process will involve placing twelve fuel assemblies into a boron steel canister and enclosing it in a copper capsule. Each capsule will then be placed in its own hole in the repository and overpacked with bentonite clay. The estimated cost of this project is about €818 million, which includes construction, encapsulation, and operating costs. The State Nuclear Waste Management Fund has approximately €1.4 billion from charges for generated electricity. The Onkalo repository is expected to be large enough to accept canisters of spent fuel for around one hundred years, i.e. until around 2120. At this point, the final encapsulation and burial will take place, and the access tunnel will be backfilled and sealed.  Criticism  In 2012, a research group at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, published research that suggests that the copper capsules are not as corrosion-proof as the companies planning the repositories claim (see KBS-3). In 2019, another study concluded that radiation effects should not significantly damage the canisters after 100,000 years.  Treatment in media  Danish director Michael Madsen has co-written and directed a feature-length documentary Into Eternity where the initial phase of the excavation is featured and experts interviewed. The director's special emphasis is on the semantic difficulties in meaningfully marking the depository as dangerous for people in the distant future.

Funded by a three-year, $2 million grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the College Hill Alliance is a department of Mercer University and became operational in the fall of 2009 after a Senior Capstone project for a group of graduating Mercer students developed into a comprehensive College Hill Corridor Master Plan. Background In 2006, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation sponsored a group of Mercer University students on a trip to meet Richard Florida of the Creative Class Group in Washington, D.C., to learn how they could spur the revival of Downtown Macon, Georgia. These students discovered that Macon was well positioned to recruit and grow creative service industries such as graphic design, marketing, and the arts by retaining talented young people graduating from the city's academic institutions. Inspired by this visit, the group of students dreamed a plan, entitled, \\"College Hill Revisited,\\" to spur this growth by reconnecting Mercer University and Downtown Macon. In spring 2007, Mercer University President Bill Underwood and Mayor C. Jack Ellis formed the College Hill Corridor Commission to accomplish the primary goal of creating an attractive, safe and well-defined corridor between Mercer and downtown. By summer, the newly formed Commission began holding public meetings to gather input and momentum from the local community to create a shared vision for the Corridor. In March 2008, the Commission received a $250,000 planning grant from the Knight Foundation. With the community's input, Interface Studio, an urban planning and design firm based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was hired to produce the College Hill Corridor Master Plan. During the next year, over 1,000 members of the community met to add their own ideas for the Corridor and set priorities. In February 2009, the community- driven College Hill Corridor Master Plan was published and adopted by the Commission to begin putting into action. In June 2009, the Knight Foundation awarded a $5 million grant for revitalizing the College Hill Corridor. The grant issued $3 million to the Community Foundation of Central Georgia to fund the Knight Neighborhood Challenge grant program and $2 million to Mercer University to create the College Hill Alliance. In September 2012, the Knight Foundation awarded $2.3 million toward continuing the Alliance's work and expanding its influence to assist entrepreneurs in the area. =Alliance= The mission of the College Hill Alliance is to assist the community in creating positive change to the physical and social fabric of the College Hill Corridor, a two-square mile area between Mercer University and Macon, Georgia's downtown business district. Created by a three-year, $2 million grant from the Knight Foundation, the College Hill Alliance is a department of Mercer University and became operational in the fall of 2009. In September 2012, the Knight Foundation awarded $2.3 million toward continuing the Alliance's work and expanding its influence to assist entrepreneurs in the area. The full-time, corporate staff of the Alliance administers the implementation of the College Hill Corridor Master Plan and works specifically to foster neighborhood revitalization through business recruitment and retention, lifestyle enhancement, and by catalyzing commercial and residential real estate development that strengthens the historic character of College Hill. =Commission= The College Hill Corridor Commission is a diverse group of volunteers committed to promoting an improved physical, cultural and social connection between Downtown Macon and the historic neighborhoods surrounding Mercer University. Formed in 2007, the Commission shepherded a process that culminated in the College Hill Corridor Master Plan, which represents the best ideas of a talented design firm, local government officials, neighbors, students and even visitors. Having attracted substantial private funding to continue further the College Hill initiative in a more formalized way and with an executive staff, the Commission now supports the College Hill Alliance in an advisory and volunteer capacity. Commission members are named by virtue of their positions in stakeholder organizations within the Corridor and Downtown Macon and serve as advisors to the Knight Neighborhood Challenge as well as through task forces focused on priorities within the College Hill Corridor Master Plan. The co-chairs of the Commission, appointed by the Mayor of Macon and President of Mercer University, also sit on the College Hill Alliance Steering Committee. All Commission meetings are open to the public and posted to the College Hill Events Calendar. Community feedback is welcomed and appreciated. =Corridor= The College Hill Corridor is a two-square mile area between Mercer University and Macon, Georgia's downtown business district comprising several historic city neighborhoods. The cherished area of town is more than a location – it's a movement. What began as a Senior Capstone project for a group of graduating Mercer students developed into a comprehensive College Hill Corridor Master Plan, where public input was compiled to utilize the Corridor as a destination that improves the connection between Mercer University and Downtown Macon. Today, the College Hill Corridor is a master plan in daily action. The revitalization of the Corridor continues thanks to the efforts of local residents and organizations, including the volunteer-driven College Hill Corridor Commission as well as the Knight Neighborhood Challenge and College Hill Alliance, which are both funded by the Knight Foundation. =Master plan= Developed by Philadelphia-based Interface Studio after numerous public meetings to gather community input, the original College Hill Corridor Master Plan concentrates on five areas that makes living in the Corridor like no other community in Macon. With regular, cool events enhancing the area’s Vibe; greenspace and eco-conscious initiatives that improve the Environment; cycling and pedestrian efforts to cool the streets and meet the multi-modal goals of the Connection; residential and business developments targeting the College Hill's Look as Macon’s urban and historic center; and, initiatives and projects dedicated to the Basics of creating a place that is clean, safe and branded, College Hill is an ideal area to live, work, learn, dine, shop and play. New recommendations for the College Hill Corridor Master Plan, based on community input compiled over a series of public meetings in early 2014, were revealed at the Report to the Community 2014. Among the recommendations is the addition of two new themes: the Strong and the Biz. The Strong seeks to promote exercise, nutrition, access to healthy, affordable food and preventative care. The Biz is about job creation, fostering entrepreneurship and economic development. Other key recommendations were made to the original five parts of the Master Plan: the Basics, the Vibe, the Environment, the Connection and the Look. It was also recommended that the map of the College Hill Corridor extend to create a terminus at Riverside Cemetery and Rose Hill Cemetery. Projects =Neighborhood revitalization= The goal of the College Hill Corridor, located in these parameters, is to create a cultural and physical connection between Mercer University and downtown Macon. The Corridor tries to add economic value to the city's tax base, keep residential and commercial areas clean to attract and retain students and young professionals. The Corridor creates programs and events, such as Second Sunday, to bring the community together and promote local businesses, bands, fund raisers, and much more. Public input was compiled to utilize the Corridor as a destination that improves the connection between Mercer University and Downtown Macon. The Lights on Macon Tour and Sidewalk Stories are several of the initiatives taking place in The Corridor to boost the local economy and improve the quality of the town. College Hill Alliance works with the Historic Macon Foundation and Beall's Neighborhood Association to promote living in the Corridor. There are homes to fit every lifestyle and budget, from $60,000 rehabbed loft-style shotgun houses to fully restored $1 million mansions, all in the same block. =Knight neighborhood challenge= When the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation awarded $5 million to the revitalization of the College Hill Corridor, $3 million was set aside for the Knight Neighborhood Challenge. Administered by the Community Foundation of Central Georgia, the Knight Neighborhood Challenge is a five- year program that underwrites ideas to transform the city of Macon's first neighborhoods into the vision of the College Hill Corridor Master Plan. A broad-based, competitive grant program, the Challenge funds projects that spruce up parks and public spaces in The Corridor. It also funds enhancements of the arts and entertainment scene. The effort aims to get people involved in College Hill through an array of civic and cultural projects. The goal of the Knight Neighborhood Challenge is to invest in ideas to restore the land use and social fabric of the College Hill neighborhood, to give the city an opportunity to actively participate in a wide array of community arts, cultural and sports activities, and to connect through digital and traditional information gathering/sharing channels. =Second Sunday= Second Sunday Concerts are one of College Hill Corridor's signature events. Every second Sunday of the month, from April through October, the Corridor hosts the city's biggest monthly picnic in Macon, featuring live music in Washington Park from 6 - 8pm. The concerts are free to attend and features a cash bar, food vendors, and the Macon Makers. =Magnolia Street soapbox derby= For the past 6 years, the Magnolia Street Soapbox Derby is hosted by the Magnolia Street residents and takes place the Saturday before the Second Sunday concert in April. The timed racing event takes place on Magnolia Street’s hill and has teams compete for the title of fastest car and most creative structure. Local business sponsor this annual event. The event is free to attend but a registration fee is required for participants. =Sundown screen series= The College Hill Alliance's need for the creation of sustainable events is being met by different public and private entities. Big Screen on the Green was one of the original Corridor events. Now, the event has transformed into the Sundown Screen Series. The Series brings the silver screen to the great outdoors and is hosted by Macon-Bibb Parks & Recreation. These free, outdoor movie events take place in spring, summer and fall at various parks in the city and the Corridor. Picnic baskets and blankets are encouraged, concessions will be available at some sites and some events, but not all. In the event of rain, movies will be cancelled. For more information call (478) 751-9280. Funding for the Sundown Screen Series has been made possible by the Knight Foundation. =Reunion zero= The Alliance and Mercer University's Alumni Services department partnered together to celebrate the graduating seniors of Mercer University. The communities of Mercer and Macon come together during the week immediately following the last week of the academic calendar to throw a celebration. The week features concerts, downtown get-arounds, specials and discounts at businesses, tours, information about Macon, and career guidance from young alumni. During the week, connections form between the young alumni, Macon community, and recent graduates. =Campus Macon= Currently in the development stage, the College Hill Alliance is actively exploring ideas to connect local college students to internship and job opportunities in central Georgia. The project is scheduled for completion in late 2014. =The next big idea= The College Hill Alliance encourages the entrepreneurial spirit among residents of central Georgia. Following that mindset, a business plan competition was created. The Next Big Idea was designed to encourage students in the Central Georgia region to make their business dreams a reality, was created. All students at the following colleges were eligible to apply: Central Georgia Technical College, Fort Valley State University, Georgia College, Mercer University, Middle Georgia State College, & Wesleyan College. Teams submitted their ideas online and each school choose up to two semi- finalist teams. At the end, they competed by pitching their idea to a panel of judges. Teams were judged in the following areas: risk, strategy, capability, viability, and impact. $15,000 was given away as prize money to the top three teams. =Macon makers= The College Hill Alliance launched an open call for people to join the \\"Maker Movement\\" – a growing national network of artists, craftspeople, business owners, entrepreneurs and innovators building new, locally-driven economies. The Maker Movement is the approximately 135 million adults – 57 percent of the American population ages 18 and up – who employ their creative skills in craft activities, such as making clothing, jewelry, baked goods or art. Financial estimates show that these “makers” push $29 billion into the economy each year. Examples of makers range from computer programmers to wood workers and run the gamut of arts and crafts to engineering and technology. The College Hill Alliance is seeking Macon Makers as part of its expanded focus to boost entrepreneurship and attract homegrown businesses to Macon’s Downtown and College Hill Corridor.

It belongs to the family Lydekkerinidae, along with the closely related genus Lydekkerina. It is known from a single type species, Eolydekkerina magna, which was named in 1996 from a part of the Beaufort Group called the Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone. Description Eolydekkerina is known from two specimens: a skull lacking the lower jaws and a poorly lower jaw, not associated with the skull. At in length, the skull of Eolydekkerina is larger than that of any Lydekkerina specimen. The snout is proportionally much longer, and the eye sockets are placed farther apart than they are in Lydekkerina. The proportions of the skull in Eolydekkerina are similar to those of the Australian lydekkerinid genus Chomatobatrachus. However, Eolydekkerina shares more features in common with Lydekkerina, including the nearly identical shape of bones at the back of the skull. The skull is roughly triangular in shape when viewed from above, with straight side margins. The margins of the eye socket are raised and the middle of the snout is slightly indented. Shallow grooves run along the surface of the skull behind the eye sockets and below the nostril openings. The lengthened skull of Eolydekkerina, while different from that of Lydekkerina, is similar to those of the related rhinesuchids and capitosaurians. The short skull of Lydekkerina is thought to be a derived or advanced characteristic, suggesting that Lydekkerina evolved from a more typical longer-skulled temnospondyl. Since temnospondyl skulls tend to lengthen as individuals of a species age, the skull of Lydekkerina may represent a juvenile form, while the skull of Eolydekkerina represents a fully-grown adult form. If Lydekkerina is the descendant of Eolydekkerina, it likely evolved by retaining juvenile characteristics into adulthood in a condition known as paedomorphosis. Paleoenvironment Remains of Eolydekkerina were found in the lower part of the Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone, a deposit that preserves very few amphibians. Amphibians become more numerous in younger parts of the Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone with most specimens attributable to either Lydekkerina or to the dissorophoid Micropholis. Several species of the family Rhytidosteidae have also been identified from the upper part of the Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone. When fossils of Eolydekkerina were first found, they were thought to belong to a rhytidosteid, as a rhytidosteid called Pneumatostega had already been found in this part of the assemblage zone. The lower Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone is dominated by the synapsid Lystrosaurus, as well as reptiles such as Owenetta and Proterosuchus. Most small-bodied lydekkerinids such as Lydekkerina are found in this type of assemblage. Lydekkerinids of similar size to Eolydekkerina (such as Chomatobatrachus) are usually found in amphibian- dominated assemblages where Lystrosaurus is not present. Therefore, the presence of Eolydekkerina in a reptile-dominated environment is unusual.

Ashley and director Moises Kaufman both expressed an understanding and acknowledgement of the criticisms, and clarified their ongoing focus, through the play's series of workshops, to explore multiple ways of telling the story through a multi-cultural lens. Kaufman later told the Los Angeles Times that his intention was to combine elements of both Eastern and Western cultures and that he was open to a version of the show with an all-Asian cast. Speaking from the audience, book writer Steven Sater addressed the issue in depth. He stated that the play, based on the Danish fairy tale \\"The Nightingale\\" which is written by Hans Christian Andersen and set in ancient China, had gone through seven workshops \\"in a number of directions with a number of directors\\" over the course of its development, with each exploring his overall vision of the piece. He described his vision as comprising a blend of cultures with a focus on the mythical elements and heritage of the fable on which it was based, in lieu of traditional realism. In 2003, the show's first workshop took place at the O'Neill Conference and utilized a multi-cultural cast, including an African- American actress playing the Empress Dowager and an Indian-American actor playing the Young Emperor, which Sater described as \\"a beautiful casting choice at the time\\" and demonstrative of the play being \\"always a story about enlightenment.\\" In 2007, the play was workshopped at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco with director James Lapine, and utilized an all-Asian cast. Sater acknowledged the significant part in the show's development process that this particular workshop played, saying: > It was a beautiful workshop of the piece. But we all came out of it feeling > a number of things, one of which was that we felt, as white creators, we > would not presume to know, or to tell, the story of Asia. We felt that the > music which existed for the piece, and the storytelling, which more than > anything else is informed by Shakespeare, really, is my influence, and > coming from a Danish telling of the story. I wanted to tell a story that > reflected the world in which I live, which is multi-cultural, and multi- > ethnic. I still feel this. During the forum, Sater acknowledged the sociopolitical issues arising out of the \\"longstanding inequities of the system in American theater\\" and the need \\"as an artist of social consciousness to be mindful of those issues and to address them.\\" He stated, \\"When I began work on this show, it was in 2001. It was in the wake of 9/11 and what spoke to me in this story was the way The Song of the Human Heart could bring down the walls that divide us.\\" Sater also expanded on his influences in writing the play, saying: > I also have to address what's in my heart, and my artistic vision for this > piece. I think if art is anything, it exists to bring out the humanity in > all of us and that is what we're trying to tell in the song of this bird, > the nightingale, who brings out the humanity in a man whose heart has been > closed and turned cold. We did not set out to do an all-Asian cast, an all- > Asian version, and then give up on that idea. Rather, it's something we > explored, as this cast is something we're exploring, on a piece that remains > to be finished. I was writing for a vision that was in my mind, and that > vision always was, and remains to be, multi-cultural, and multi-ethnic; and > however imperfect its realization here may be, that's the vision I continue > to embrace for the piece. Composer Duncan Sheik stated in an interview after the panel that the discussion had \\"affected my thinking of the show. My head is spinning.\\" In 2011, the musical was workshopped at Vassar's Powerhouse Theater with a multi- ethnic cast (also directed by Kaufman).

Established in 1978 at the request of Maurice Cardinal Otunga, the monastery is currently home to 50 monks. Abbot John Baptist Oese Imai is the community's superior. History =From Peramiho to Kenya= From its foundation in 1898, the community of Missionary Benedictines at Peramiho, Tanzania, had sought to evangelize the surrounding population. During the monastery's period as an abbatia nullius, its monks successfully cultivated local vocations to the priesthood. In 1969, Diocese of Songea was created and a local priest ordained bishop. At this point, the monks of Peramiho found themselves at a crossroads. Their duty of primary evangelization had been largely accomplished; now it was time to focus mission efforts elsewhere. Bishop Emilio Njiru of Eldoret, Kenya, invited the monks of Peramiho Abbey to settle in the northern part of his diocese, in the Kerio Valley, an area that had seen little mission work. The Congregation's 11th General Chapter, meeting in 1971, gave their approval to this idea. The first Missionary Benedictines arrived in the Diocese of Eldoret on February 10, 1972. Soon, they began evangelizing the Pokot and Marakwet, residents of the Kerio Valley. Reflecting previous mission efforts of the Congregation, religious instruction was accompanied by social, educational, and medical services. The popularity of the Benedictines spread, and in 1977, Maurice Cardinal Otunga of Nairobi invited the monks to make a foundation in the capital city. The monks of Peramiho Abbey were to build a parish in the northern suburbs of Nairobi, including the slums of the Mathare Valley. It was also decided that local vocations would be recruited as soon as the facilities (which were to include a monastery, retreat center, and Christian education center) had been constructed. =Consolidating the Foundation= The foundation in Nairobi, St Benedict's Monastery, opened on April 6, 1978. In early 1979, construction of the monastery itself began, designed to house a community of 16 monks. At this time, the community began to accept candidates. To ensure that the monastic quality of the house was not overshadowed by the mission apostolate, the Congregation raised the foundation to the status of a simple priory on June 22, 1979. A retreat house and a church were completed in 1982. Local vocations arrived quickly. A formation house had been established in Nanyuki, 200 km north of Nairobi. By 1981, four local monks had pronounced their vows. By 1984, ten postulants were in formation. Neighboring Uganda proved to be a ready source of vocations. However, the existence of a separate formation house ended up being a disadvantage. Not only did its administration require extra personnel, it also made consolidation of the quickly growing monastic community a challenge. The goal of having a midsized monastery was not being realized either at the Nanyuki formation house or at the Nairobi monastery. In 1988, St Benedict's Monastery in Nairobi was raised to the status of a conventual priory, and Pius Mühlbacher became the community's first conventual prior. To solve this problem, Cardinal Otunga offered the Missionary Benedictines a large farm in Tigoni, 30 km northwest of Nairobi. In 1987, construction of a new monastery here began; the official day of Tigoni's founding is November 20, 1987. By 1990, quarters for 24 monks had been built. Cardinal Otunga consecrated the monastery's church in 1991. The monastery's properties in Nairobi and Nanyuki were converted to domus religiosa, and the monastic community transferred to Tigoni on June 30, 1992.

She is known for her advocacy for women's rights and her role in removing racist and sexist language from primary school readers in California.Union Tribune Obituary Early life and education Ewing was born Ann Drayton Heuser on November 19, 1930, in the upstairs bedroom of her family's home located in Wytheville, Virginia. As a student she wanted to study chemistry but was told that subject was only for men. She earned her undergraduate degree in biology from the College of William and Mary in Virginia, and a master's degree in botany from the University of Tennessee in the 1950s. Career =Researcher= Ewing worked as a research fellow for three years (1972-1975) at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, designing and conducting research to understand salt- tolerance in plants.Cliff Smith, \\"New Salt-Tolerant hybrids Could Avert World Famine\\", The San Diego Union, 12 January 1975, page B-1 Later, she worked in the Planning and Land Use Office of the County of San Diego (1975-1995). Ewing worked to protect numerous native plants and animals from losing their homes to development projects. She also was a lead planner for the Otay Ranch section of Chula Vista, California. Additionally, she was an active member of the Torrey Pines Association, a non-profit organization that encourages public interest in the preservation of the Torrey pine tree and its habitat. =Activist= Ewing began her activism as a college student and participated in the civil rights movement in the segregated south when she was 20 years old. After moving to San Diego in 1968, she became involved with women's rights issues. In the early 1970s, she joined the San Diego County Chapter of NOW, the National Organization for Women, and began working on the Education Task Force. As part of that organization, she worked hard in support of Title IX, an amendment to the 1965 Higher Education Act securing equal access to educational programs—including sports programs—regardless of sex, until its passage in 1972. Ewing then began to work for the elimination of sexist and racist readers in the primary schools. As a part of that effort, Ewing served as the chair of California NOW's Education Task Force. On June 7, 1974, she wrote a guest editorial in The San Diego Union entitled, \\"Are California's textbooks fair to Jane?: Stereotypes Remain In Latest Materials\\".Anne Radlow, \\"Stereotypes Remain In Latest Materials,\\" The San Diego Union, 7 June 1974, page B-11. Under Ewing's leadership, a coalition of women's and minority groups, including California NOW, presented a report to the California State Board of Education that clearly showed that the readers being used in the primary schools contained sexist and racist themes. The coalition requested that the Board remove these readers and replace them with more appropriate texts. When the Board refused, the coalition threatened to sue it over their reluctance to enact the requested change. Eventually, the Board yielded and banned texts that had obvious sexism and racism, using criteria developed by Ewing. The new readers removed racist and sexist language and included the contributions of both men and women in all types of roles, including professional, vocational, and executive. Publishers were also forced to change the books nationwide because California was the largest buyer of textbooks in the country. Personal life Ewing was also a strong supporter of women's rights to choose an abortion (pro-choice), and worked for passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. She also served as the President of the San Diego County Chapter of NOW from 1975–1976. In 1976, she founded the San Diego County Chapter of the National Women's Political Caucus, and served as its President from 1976–1978. Ewing died on April 11, 2011, of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder at the age of 80 in her home in San Diego, California.

Müller was married to Klara (née Hafner) with whom he had two children, son Alan and daughter Evelina. After his father death, Müller inherited \\"Balkan\\" cinema and part of a residential-commercial complex in Varšavska and Masarykova Street. In 1938, because of the political situation and antisemitism caused by Nazi propaganda, Müller and his family converted to Catholicism and change their surname to Miler. In 1939, Müller sold the residential-commercial complex in Varšavska and Masarykova Street to a Topić family from Zagreb. That same year Müller and his family moved to France. During World War II, Müller and his wife were arrested by Gestapo in France with the help from Vichy Regime, while their daughter managed to save herself by hiding at friends. Müller son joined the French Resistance. In August 1944, Müller was deported to Dachau concentration camp, where in January 1945 he was killed.

He was born in Târgu Mureș, but graduated from the Gheorghe Dima Music Academy in Cluj. Radu Țuculescu belongs to the so-called \\"1980s generation\\" from Romania.  Family  He is the nephew of painter Ion Țuculescu, and the father of writer Răzvan Țuculescu.  Career  His novels are translated and published in Austria, France, Czech Republic, Italy, Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary, Serbia and Israel. His theatrical plays are performed in languages as Italian, English, Czech, Hebrew and Hungarian. The “Grădina de vară sau Hai să-i batem” theatrical play was put in scene for the first time in Prague, at the Orfeus Theatre, on January 29 2008, and is still enjoying significant success, along with his recent comedy “O balegă în mijlocul drumului”. ”Mere-vieille racontait\\" (Povestirile mameibatrane, in Romanian) is Radu Tuculescu's novel published by \\"Cartea Romaneasca\\" in Bucharest in 2006. The novel has become an instant best seller in Romania and it surely added quite a lot of recognition to already famous novelist and playwright Radu Tuculescu. Although unavailable in English, the novel has been earmarked for an English translation. The setting of the novel is this Transylvanian time-frozen village, Petrinzel or Petra in the novel, where nothing happens and where time seems of no essence. The village and the nature surrounding it seem quite pristine, untouched, unharmed, but it can also be harmful at times. The villagers who are mostly old and few, are themselves looking like people descended from a totally unreal world. People like the local Hungarian priest Tothjanos has willingly or unwillingly become not only a soothing pastor but also a much appreciated playboy in his little community. Rosamunda, the woman who castrates the village hogs has turned into some Gorgonian figure whom all the men are fearful of. Margolili, the most beautiful and lustful woman in this village, the woman who has known almost all local men, suddenly and mysteriously disappears leaving behind her a heavy trail of suspense and guilt. But the most important, enigmatic and gifted character is the old mother who at seventy five decides to read any literature she can lay her hands upon. Therefore, she reads Shakespeare, Bulgakov, Tolstoy and others retelling and reinventing the stories by using her natural and extremely rich imagination, by interweaving the stories she read with the ones she invented and came up with, from her own life. It is certainly a community dominated by its women. Sometimes the reader has this deja-vu sensation of a Gogolian village or maybe the spiritual and mystic shtetls in Isaac Bashevis Singer, but one thing is certain - any open minded reader will get this unique opportunity to take a good glimpse into Transylvania's rich cultural, literary and dramatic heritage.

Basilea was the eldest and one of the most celebrated daughters of Uranus, who had forty-five children by various wives, including Rhea and Pandora. Basilea became known as the “Great Mother” due to the solicitous way in which she cared for her younger brothers. After her father’s death, she was elected Queen of Atlantis by popular vote. She married her brother Hyperion and had two children: Selene and Helios, the goddess of the moon and god of the sun, respectively. However, her other brothers murdered Hyperion, for fear that he might usurp the throne, and drowned Helios in the River Eridanus or Po in Italy. Out of love for her brother, Selene committed suicide by jumping from a rooftop. Upon learning of the death of her children, Basilea went mad and “wandered up and down, with hair disheveled and bedizened with ornaments, playing wildly on the timbrel and cymbal.” When the people of Atlantis tried to restrain her, she disappeared into a terrible lightning storm. In honor of Basilea and her children, divine rites were established. Basilea is often confused for Theia, the more accepted mother of Selene, Helios, and in addition, Eos, and wife to Hyperion. It is unsure whether or not they are the same figure. Basilea is also mentioned quite differently in other versions. She is listed as a daughter of Coelus and Terra, and is implied to be the mother of all gods. It is also implied that she is another version of Aphrodite (Roman, Venus).

Rayleigh-Bénard convection is a type of natural convection, occurring in a plane horizontal layer of fluid heated from below, in which the fluid develops a regular pattern of convection cells known as Bénard cells. Bénard–Rayleigh convection is one of the most commonly studied convection phenomena because of its analytical and experimental accessibility. The convection patterns are the most carefully examined example of self-organizing nonlinear systems. Buoyancy, and hence gravity, are responsible for the appearance of convection cells. The initial movement is the upwelling of lesser density fluid from the heated bottom layer. This upwelling spontaneously organizes into a regular pattern of cells. Physical processes The features of Bénard convection can be obtained by a simple experiment first conducted by Henri Bénard, a French physicist, in 1900. =Development of convection= Convection cells in a gravity field The experimental set-up uses a layer of liquid, e.g. water, between two parallel planes. The height of the layer is small compared to the horizontal dimension. At first, the temperature of the bottom plane is the same as the top plane. The liquid will then tend towards an equilibrium, where its temperature is the same as its surroundings. (Once there, the liquid is perfectly uniform: to an observer it would appear the same from any position. This equilibrium is also asymptotically stable: after a local, temporary perturbation of the outside temperature, it will go back to its uniform state, in line with the second law of thermodynamics). Then, the temperature of the bottom plane is increased slightly yielding a flow of thermal energy conducted through the liquid. The system will begin to have a structure of thermal conductivity: the temperature, and the density and pressure with it, will vary linearly between the bottom and top plane. A uniform linear gradient of temperature will be established. (This system may be modelled by statistical mechanics). Once conduction is established, the microscopic random movement spontaneously becomes ordered on a macroscopic level, forming Benard convection cells, with a characteristic correlation length. =Convection features= Simulation of Rayleigh–Bénard convection in 3D. The rotation of the cells is stable and will alternate from clock-wise to counter-clockwise horizontally; this is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Bénard cells are metastable. This means that a small perturbation will not be able to change the rotation of the cells, but a larger one could affect the rotation; they exhibit a form of hysteresis. Moreover, the deterministic law at the microscopic level produces a non-deterministic arrangement of the cells: if the experiment is repeated, a particular position in the experiment will be in a clockwise cell in some cases, and a counter-clockwise cell in others. Microscopic perturbations of the initial conditions are enough to produce a non-deterministic macroscopic effect. That is, in principle, there is no way to calculate the macroscopic effect of a microscopic perturbation. This inability to predict long-range conditions and sensitivity to initial-conditions are characteristics of chaotic or complex systems (i.e., the butterfly effect). turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection If the temperature of the bottom plane was to be further increased, the structure would become more complex in space and time; the turbulent flow would become chaotic. Convective Bénard cells tend to approximate regular right hexagonal prisms, particularly in the absence of turbulence,Rayleigh–Benard Convection Cells, with photos, from the Environmental Technology Laboratory at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States Department of Commerce.http://www.edata- center.com/proceedings/1bb331655c289a0a,088ce8ea747789cd,59d115f133a4fd07.htmlhttp://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt;=17287579 although certain experimental conditions can result in the formation of regular right square prismshttp://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid;=13973 or spirals.http://www.psc.edu/science/Gunton/gunton.html The convective Bénard cells are not unique and will usually appear only in the surface tension driven convection. In general the solutions to the Rayleigh and Pearson analysis (linear theory) assuming an infinite horizontal layer gives rise to degeneracy meaning that many patterns may be obtained by the system. Assuming uniform temperature at the top and bottom plates, when a realistic system is used (a layer with horizontal boundaries) the shape of the boundaries will mandate the pattern. More often than not the convection will appear as rolls or a superposition of them.  Rayleigh–Bénard instability  Since there is a density gradient between the top and the bottom plate, gravity acts trying to pull the cooler, denser liquid from the top to the bottom. This gravitational force is opposed by the viscous damping force in the fluid. The balance of these two forces is expressed by a non-dimensional parameter called the Rayleigh number. The Rayleigh number is defined as: :\\\\mathrm{Ra}_{L} = \\\\frac{g \\\\beta} { u \\\\alpha} (T_b - T_u) L^3 where :Tu is the temperature of the top plate :Tb is the temperature of the bottom plate :L is the height of the container :g is the acceleration due to gravity :ν is the kinematic viscosity :α is the Thermal diffusivity :β is the Thermal expansion coefficient. As the Rayleigh number increases, the gravitational forces become more dominant. At a critical Rayleigh number of 1708, instability sets in and convection cells appear. The critical Rayleigh number can be obtained analytically for a number of different boundary conditions by doing a perturbation analysis on the linearized equations in the stable state.http://home.iitk.ac.in/~sghorai/NOTES/benard/benard.html The simplest case is that of two free boundaries, which Lord Rayleigh solved in 1916, obtaining Ra = π4 ≈ 657.51.http://home.iitk.ac.in/~sghorai/NOTES/benard/node14.html In the case of a rigid boundary at the bottom and a free boundary at the top (as in the case of a kettle without a lid), the critical Rayleigh number comes out as Ra = 1,100.65.http://home.iitk.ac.in/~sghorai/NOTES/benard/node16.html  Effects of surface tension  In case of a free liquid surface in contact with air, buoyancy and surface tension effects will also play a role in how the convection patterns develop. Liquids flow from places of lower surface tension to places of higher surface tension. This is called the Marangoni effect. When applying heat from below, the temperature at the top layer will show temperature fluctuations. With increasing temperature, surface tension decreases. Thus a lateral flow of liquid at the surface will take place,Steady thermocapillary flows in two-dimensional slots Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Vol. 121 (1982), pp. 163-186, doi:10.1017/s0022112082001840 by Asok K. Sen, Stephen H. Davis from warmer areas to cooler areas. In order to preserve a horizontal (or nearly horizontal) liquid surface, cooler surface liquid will descend. This down-welling of cooler liquid contributes to the driving force of the convection cells. The specific case of temperature gradient-driven surface tension variations is known as thermo-capillary convection, or Bénard–Marangoni convection. History and nomenclature In 1870, the Irish- Scottish physicist and engineer James Thomson (1822–1892), elder brother of Lord Kelvin, observed water cooling in a tub; he noted that the soapy film on the water's surface was divided as if the surface had been tiled (tesselated). In 1882, he showed that the tesselation was due to the presence of convection cells. In 1900, the French physicist Henri Bénard (1874–1939) independently arrived at the same conclusion. This pattern of convection, whose effects are due solely to a temperature gradient, was first successfully analyzed in 1916 by Lord Rayleigh (1842–1919). Rayleigh assumed boundary conditions in which the vertical velocity component and temperature disturbance vanish at the top and bottom boundaries (perfect thermal conduction). Those assumptions resulted in the analysis losing any connection with Henri Bénard's experiment. This resulted in discrepancies between theoretical and experimental results until 1958, when John Pearson (1930– ) reworked the problem based on surface tension. This is what was originally observed by Bénard. Nonetheless in modern usage \\"Rayleigh–Bénard convection\\" refers to the effects due to temperature, whereas \\"Bénard–Marangoni convection\\" refers specifically to the effects of surface tension. Davis and Koschmieder have suggested that the convection should be rightfully called the \\"Pearson–Bénard convection\\". Rayleigh–Bénard convection is also sometimes known as \\"Bénard–Rayleigh convection\\", \\"Bénard convection\\", or \\"Rayleigh convection\\".

It is a follow-up to Guns of Icarus (now known as Flight of the Icarus), and was released on October 29, 2012. A cooperative, PvE companion game Guns of Icarus Alliance was released on March 31, 2017. On December 23, 2011, Muse Games launched a Kickstarter project to raise $10,000 to partially fund the development of Guns of Icarus Online, and the company subsequently received $35,237 at the close of the bidding on February 21, 2012. Following the completion of their fundraising campaign, Muse Games co- developer Eric Chung announced that Guns of Icarus Online would enter closed beta on April 10, 2012. Guns of Icarus Online Version 1.0 officially went online on October 29, 2012. The improved Version 1.1 was first available through Steam on November 20 and online on November 23. In early 2013, Linux support was added. A PlayStation 4 version launched May 1, 2018 with full cross-platform support. Gameplay Guns of Icarus Online is a steampunk/dieselpunk, multiplayer, first-person shooter that focuses on airship combat. Each airship is controlled by up to four players, with each member of the crew taking a specific role. Players can choose three different classes: gunner, engineer or pilot, which allow them access to different kinds of tools. The captain of each ship chooses which weapons to use in his/her ship. There are also several ships available: *Galleon: the Galleon is by far the biggest and more resilient ship, but also the slowest one. It focuses on high firepower and tank capabilities with high hull armor. *Squid: the Squid is the fastest ship in the game which allows its commander to outmaneuver enemy ships, but it is the least resilient ship and does not have a weapon slot for Heavy Weapons. *Goldfish: the Goldfish has a main gun on its prow, and two secondary guns on the port and starboard sides and another positioned at the rear. It relies on its moderate speed and high maneuverability. *Junker: the Junker has 5 small weapon mountings. It also has high maneuverability, but a low speed. *Pyramidion: the Pyramidion has two guns on the top deck and two on the low deck. With very high damage output, but low turning speed, this ship is very versatile. *Spire: the Spire has a very high turning speed, but a very low linear speed. It is a high dps ship with very low hull armor. *Mobula: the Mobula has 5 weapons on the front, but none on the sides nor the back. It has great vertical movement, but is difficult to repair in the heat of the battle. After being in development since late 2013, the Alliance add-on launched on March 31, 2017. This added several PvE game modes, a faction war gameplay system where players play matches to earn war effort so that their faction can take over or defend pieces of land on a map of the game world, and, at Alliance's launch, it contained four joinable factions and four new playable ships. Two new factions and their respective exclusive ships were progressively added in updates throughout spring and summer in 2017. These new ships include: *Magnate: A ship belonging to the Mercantile Guild faction, this decorated ship is slow-moving, but has three guns on each side; two light gun mountings and one heavy, allowing for the Magnate to have a high damage-per-second. *Corsair: A ship belonging to the Anglean Republic, the Corsair is the largest ship in the game. This ship is heavily armoured and slightly faster than a Galleon, and has two heavy guns and light guns on each side, as well as a heavy gun on the front and a light gun on the stern, allowing the Corsair to exhibit high damage within limited intervals due to its speed and amount of weapons. *Shrike: Specific to the Order of Chaladon, the Shrike is the second fastest ship in the game after the Squid. However, like the Squid, its hull is weak, and has only average turning speed. This ship has two heavy and light gun mounts on the port and starboard sides of the ship, making the Shrike preferable for \\"hit-and-run\\" tactics. *Crusader: Belonging to the Fjord Baronies, the Crusader is large and heavily armed, with two heavy guns on the front and two light guns on either side, allowing for a wide frontal attack range. It has good vertical speed, but low health and armor. The following two ships were added to Alliance after its launch: *Stormbreaker: A patchwork airship specific to the Arashi League, this aircraft has extremely fast acceleration and decent speed, as well as fast turning. Its main firepower is concentrated on the port side, with three light guns lined along this side of the ship and a lone heavy gun on the starboard side. It is nimble, but has low health and armor. *Judgement: Belonging to the Yesha Empire, the Judgement is versatile and has high armor, but indecent forward and turning speed, as well as low health. Its firepower is concentrated towards the front and the rear, with two forward facing light guns and a heavy gun, as well as a heavy gun and light gun facing to the rear.  Reception  Guns of Icarus Online received mixed to positive reviews. On Metacritic, it scored 64 out of 100 based on 7 reviews, and on GameRankings 70.60% based on 5 reviews. As of July 2018, the game's rating on Steam is 92% - \\"Very Positive\\".

Sac & Fox Nation, 508 U.S. 114 (1993), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that absent explicit congressional direction to the contrary, it must be presumed that a State does not have jurisdiction to tax tribal members who live and work in Indian country, whether the particular territory consists of a formal or informal reservation, allotted lands, or dependent Indian communities.Okla. Tax Comm'n v. Sac & Fox Nation, . The Sac and Fox Nation is an Indian (Native American) tribe that governs itself under the Indian Self-Determination Act and imposes taxes based on that authority. The State of Oklahoma sought to impose income and motor vehicle taxes on tribal members. The tribe brought suit to prevent the state from imposing those taxes. Both the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court held that Oklahoma, without a clear authorization from Congress, was prohibited from imposing taxes on tribal members in Indian country. This case, together with several other cases, are known as the \\"Oklahoma tax cases\\" in Native American case law. Background =History= Seal of Sac & Fox Nation The Sac and Fox Nation is an Indian tribe originally from the Great Lakes area. Following a series of treaties with the United States, in 1867Treaty with the Sauk and Foxes, 1867, .2 Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties 951-956 (Charles J. Kappler, ed. 1904) they moved to the Sac and Fox reservation of in Indian Territory (in what is now Pottawatomie County in the State of Oklahoma). In 1887, Congress passed the Dawes Act which broke up the reservation and allotted land to the tribal members.General Allotment Act of 1887, .1 Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties 33-36 (Charles J. Kappler, ed. 1904) In implementing this law, the United States entered into another treaty with the tribe in 1891,Treaty with the Sac and Fox Nation of Indians, 1890, .1 Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties 389–393 (Charles J. Kappler, ed. 1904) in which the tribe retained as a tribal headquarters and tribal members were allotted of land from the former reservation. The Sac and Fox Nation governs itself under the authority of the Indian Self-Determination ActIndian Self- Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, . and has its own tax commission. The tribe imposes a tax on earnings of any person working within tribal jurisdiction, regardless of whether that person is a tribal member. The tribe also provides for a motor vehicle tax and registration of any vehicle that are owned by a tribal member and garaged within tribal jurisdiction. The State of Oklahoma, through the Oklahoma Tax Commission, also administers incomeOkla. Stat., Tit. 68, § 2351 et seq. and motor vehicle taxes.Okla. Stat., Tit. 68, § 2101 et seq. The state considers that all income earned in the state is taxable, including on tribal land, and issues tax assessments against those who are delinquent. Oklahoma contends that anyone within the state had to register their vehicles with the state, while the Sac and Fox Nation required tribal members residing in tribal jurisdiction to register the vehicle with the tribe. The state viewed those members to be delinquent in their vehicle taxes, but made no effort to collect until the vehicle was sold to a new owner. At that time, Oklahoma would require that the delinquent taxes and penalties be paid in order to register the vehicle.Sac and Fox Nation v. Okla. Tax Comm'n, 967 F.2d 1425 (10th Cir. 1992).Alex Tallchief Skibine, Teaching Indian Law in an Anti-Tribal Era , 82 777 (2006). =Lower courts= Seal of Oklahoma The Sac and Fox Nation then filed a lawsuit against the Oklahoma Tax Commission in U.S. District Court seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting the state from taxing income earned within tribal jurisdiction or of those who reside within the tribe's jurisdiction, and from vehicle taxes on vehicles that were lawfully registered with the tribe. Both the Sac and Fox Nation and Oklahoma made motions for summary judgment and the district court, without determining reservation boundaries, held that while the state could collect income tax on non-tribal members, they could not collect income taxes from tribal members employed by the tribe on trust land. The district court also held that the state could not collect vehicle taxes for periods that the vehicle was properly registered with the tribe. Both sides appealed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Tenth Circuit Court affirmed the decision of the district court. First the court noted that the reservation boundaries were not relevant to the case, the issue instead being tribal immunity from state jurisdiction. The court noted the prior Supreme Court decision in Okla. Tax Comm'n v. Citizen Band, Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Okla.Okla. Tax Comm'n v. Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Okla., . and stated that \\"It appears as though the State of Oklahoma persists in fighting a battle it has already lost.\\" Since Oklahoma could provide no Congressional authority for collecting taxes from Sac and Fox tribal members it was clear that the state had exceeded its authority.Bradford D. Cooley, The Navajo Uranium Ban: Tribal Sovereignty v. National Energy Demands , 26 393 (2006). On the income tax for non-tribal employees, the Sac and Fox Nation asserted that the Commerce Clause and treaty language granted it exclusive taxing authority on tribal land. The appellate court was not persuaded and ruled that the state could impose an income tax on non-tribal members.Okla. Tax Comm'n v. Chickasaw Nation, . On the issue of tribal motor vehicle taxes and registration, the Tenth Circuit Court did not make a distinction between tribal and non-tribal members. The court held that the tribe could require the registration of vehicles on tribal land, regardless of whether the owner was a tribal member or not. The court noted that both Moe v. Salish and Kootenai TribesMoe v. Salish and Kootenai Tribes, . and Washington v. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian ReservationWashington v. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian Reservation, . prohibit such state taxation on tribal members. The state could enforce its vehicle tax on non-tribal members. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court, which, after noting a Wisconsin Supreme Court decision in the same area, granted certiorari and agreed to hear the case. Opinion of the court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, author of the unanimous opinion =Arguments= David Allen Miley argued the case for Oklahoma. Edwin Kneedler argued the case for the United States as amicus curiae on behalf of the tribe, with Solicitor General Ken Starr. G. William Rice argued the case for the Sac and Fox Nation. Amicus curiae briefs in support of Oklahoma were filed by Arizona, Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin. Briefs in support of the tribe were filed by Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma,, 307-308 (2004). Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma and Navajo Nation. The state argued that the case law cited by the Tenth Circuit only dealt with established Indian reservations and that the appellate court erred since the Sac and Fox reservation had been disestablished in the 1890s. The Tax Commission's position was that there were no more reservations in Oklahoma., 200-202 (2000). Oklahoma stated that without determining reservation boundaries, if any, the lower court would be unable to properly apply tribal immunity. The state also argued that the vehicle tax and registration fees were more akin to a sales tax and a use fee than an excise tax. =Opinion= Justice Sandra Day O'Connor delivered the opinion of a unanimous court. O'Connor stated that Oklahoma's argument that a tribal member must live on a reservation to be exempt from state taxes was incorrect. All that is required is that the member live in \\"Indian country\\",.Angelique A. EagleWoman, Re-establishing the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate's Reservation Boundaries: Building a Legal Rationale from Current International Law, 29 239 (2005). which Congress has defined to \\"include formal and informal reservations, dependent Indian communities, and Indian allotments, whether restricted or held in trust by the United States.\\" O'Connor noted that the Tenth Circuit should have determined the residence of the tribal members as inside or outside of Indian country, not if they were within the reservation.Skibine, supra, at 783 n.50.Joseph D. Matal, A Revisionist History of Indian Country, 14 283 (1997). She noted that in Potawatomi case, Oklahoma made exactly the same argument which was also rejected by the court. O'Connor also rejected the state's argument that the motor vehicle tax was not an excise tax and that the registration fee was a use fee. She stated that the tax strongly resembled the taxes prohibited by Colville and Moe, and noted that if the registration fee was a use fee, then non-residents of Oklahoma would not be exempt. The court upheld the decision of the Tenth Circuit Court.Skibine, supra, at 782., 11 (1996)., supra, at 307-308. Subsequent developments This case, together with two other involving the Oklahoma Tax Commission have defined tribal sovereignty in a clearer manner.Matal, supra, at 327, 333., supra, at 11. The case has been cited in numerous lower court opinions, as well as the Supreme Courts own opinions, as limiting the ability of state governments to act in Indian country. Sac and Fox, together with Potawatomi and Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Chickasaw Nation,Chickasaw Nation, supra, at 450. have become known as the \\"Oklahoma tax cases\\".Cooley, supra, at 414. The decision is also unique in that it uses a federal criminal jurisdiction statute as the basis for civil jurisdiction.Marc Slonim, Indian Country, Indian Reservations, and the Importance of History in Indian Law, 45 517, (2010).

It was slated to air on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) on September 26, 2012. The episode was written by Dan Fogelman, and directed by Chris Koch. The episode generally received negative reviews. The concept of The Neighbors was devised by Fogelman, who previously wrote the films Cars, Cars 2 and Tangled. Although it is a comedy series, its script was cited as potentially being too complex for mainstream American television. Fogelman conceived The Neighbors after a visit to the gated community where his mother lived. Production =Conception= Dan Fogelman devised the concept of the series, which was previously entitled Down to Earth. It was described as a sitcom about \\"a New Jersey family that moves into a gated community occupied exclusively by extraterrestrials.\\" Fogelman previously wrote the films Cars, Cars 2 and Tangled. The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) picked up the pilot episode of The Neighbors in October 2011, with a pilot commitment. Chris Koch signed on to direct the pilot episode. The show was originally produced for ABC Studios and Warner Bros. Television, but Warner Bros. Television was replaced by company Kaplan Entertainment. Dan Fogelman, Chris Koch, Jeff Morton and Aaron Kaplan executive produced the episode. In May 2012, the show renamed to The Neighbors, and production of the program was green-lit. \\"Pilot\\" was written by Fogelman. Fogelman conceived The Neighbors after visiting his mother, who lived in a gated townhouse community, and stated, \\"you could reach out of my mom's bathroom window and touch her neighbor's bathroom window\\", but they never spoke to or knew each other, and the idea was \\"who are these people that she's living between?\\", and what if they were all aliens? He claimed that family is the best part of humanity, and he kept \\"exploring stuff\\". Fogelman wants The Neighbors to be a show that \\"the whole family can watch together\\". He said: \\"It's high concept but I do want to ground it as a family sitcom\\". The show's premise has been described as \\"goofy\\", and has been considered as a \\"high-concept\\" show by Entertainment Weekly. At the semi-annual press tour in Beverly Hills, ABC Entertainment President Paul Lee stated that The Neighbors has \\"high-concept nature\\", but \\"love[d]\\" it. The Neighbors was originally stated to premiere at 9:30 p.m. on Wednesday, but ABC decided to air it in 8:30 time interval. In response to this, Lee claimed that \\"8:30 p.m. suited the show better\\" as \\"there's so much pressure [to perform] after Modern Family\\". The 9:30 p.m. slot was replaced with Suburgatory. Lee wants it to be on the air for a long time, and claimed that Suburgatory would better fit in the 9:30 slot. Lee praised Fogelman, calling him a \\"wondering writer\\"; he thinks he will give a \\"smart piece of storytelling\\". =Casting= Simon Templeman obtained the role of Wilt Chamberlain, the leader of the aliens. In December 2011, Jami Gertz, Simon Templeman, Toks Olagundoye and Tim Jo obtained roles in the series. It was announced that Gertz would play Debbie Weaver, the matriarch of the human family, Templeman would play Wilt Chamberlain, the leader of the aliens, Olagundoye was cast as Jackie Joyner Kersee, the matriarch of the lead alien family, and Jo would appear as Joe Montana, the son of the alien family. Wilt Chamberlain was originally the lead alien Larry Bird. In January 2012, Clara Mamet, Ian Patrick and Isabella Cramp garnered roles in the series. Mamet garnered the role of Gertz's teenage daughter, while Patrick and Cramp got kid roles. Later that month, Lenny Venito obtained the lead role as Marty Weaver, the father of the human family. Broadcast and reception =Ratings= \\"Pilot\\" is scheduled to air on ABC on September 26, 2012 after Modern Family. In Canada, it will air on Saturday at 10:00 p.m. on CTV network in the fall of 2012 after the Crimetime Saturday block. =Critical response= The Neighbors received negative treatment at the upfront for the program. Writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, David Wiegand thought that The Neighbors did not look \\"promising\\" as it has a high- concept show. Weigand compared it to the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) science fiction comedy series 3rd Rock from the Sun, claiming that the series' creator made it so different from Third Rock From the Sun, that it is \\"weird\\". He stated that if The Neighbors garnered low ratings, it could possibly be replaced with Family Tools, an ABC comedy that is scheduled to air in mid- season. He compared it to other comedies set to air on the same channel writing that those are better than The Neighbors. According to Weigand, The Neighbors seems like Outsourced, which aired for one season on NBC. Other reviews were more positive. Dave Walker from The Times-Picayune thought that The Neighbors was a \\"fish-out-of-water\\"; he called it a \\"potentially comedic\\" show. Rob Owen, a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette critic, claimed that he has \\"interest in high-concept shows\\"; he also \\"laughed a good bit at the pilot episode\\". His concern was \\"how long they can keep up the jokes. Seeing the unusual way aliens do the dishes in the pilot is hilarious. But that gag only works the first time.

The majority of revelations of Chinese doping have focused on swimmers. The doping programme has been explained as a by-product of the \\"open door\\" policy which saw the rapid expansion within China of modern cultural and technological exchanges with foreign countries. Bioethicist Maxwell J. Mehlman in his 2009 book The Price of Perfection, states that \\"In effect China has replaced East Germany as the target of Western condemnation of state-sponsored doping\\". Mehlman quotes an anthropologist as saying that \\"When China became a 'world sports power', American journalists found it all too easy to slip China into the slot of the 'Big Red Machine' formally occupied by Eastern bloc teams\\". Chinese swimming performances in the 1990s In 1992 the number of Chinese swimmers in the top 25 world rankings soared from a plateau of less than 30 to 98, with all but 4 of the 98 swimmers female. Their improvement rate was much better than could have been expected as a result of normal growth and development. China subsequently performed beyond expectations to win 12 gold medals at the 1994 World Aquatics Championships amid widespread suspicions of doping. Chinese swimmers won 12 of 16 gold medals at the 1994 championships and set five world records. Between 1990 and 1998, 28 Chinese swimmers tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs, almost half the world total of drug offenders in sport. Seven swimmers tested positive for steroids at the Asian Games in Hiroshima in late 1994, these positive tests badly affected the squad to the extent that it won only one swimming gold at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Following the revelations of doping among Chinese swimmers at the Hiroshima games IOC Medical Commission chairman Alexandre de Mérode discounted the possibility of officially sanctioned Chinese doping stating that the results were \\"accidents that could happen anywhere\\". Chinese leaders initially blamed racist sports officials in Japan for manufacturing test results. A report by a joint International Swimming Federation and Olympic Council of Asia delegation to Beijing in 1995 concluded that \\"there is no evidence that the Chinese are systematically doping athletes\\". The revelations led to Australian, American, Canadian and Japanese sports officials voting against Chinese participation at the 1995 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships. In 1995 the Chinese People's Daily newspaper published an anti-doping policy and proclaimed an official prohibition on performance-enhancing substances. China improved in swimming until 1998 when four more positive tests and the discovery of human growth hormone (HGH) in the swimmer Yuan Yuan's luggage at the 1998 World Aquatics Championships in Perth, Australia. In the routine customs check on the swimmer's bag, enough HGH was discovered to supply the entire women's swimming team for the duration of the championships. Only Yuan Yuan was sanctioned for the incident, with speculation that this was connected to the nomination of Juan Antonio Samaranch by China for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. Tests in Perth found the presence of the banned diuretic masking agent triamterine in the urine of four swimmers, Wang Luna, Yi Zhang, Huijue Cai and Wei Wang. The swimmers were suspended from competition for two years, with three coaches associated with the swimmers, Zhi Cheng, Hiuqin Xu and Zhi Cheng each suspended for three months. Zhao Jian, the deputy director-general of the China Anti-Doping Agency described the 1998 World Aquatic Championships as a \\"bad incident\\", and said that it had led to China adopting a tougher attitude towards drug testing, with drug testing removed from the main sports administration and placed in a separate agency. The Hiroshima games also saw a hurdler, a cyclist and two canoeists test positive for the steroid dihydrotestosterone. Chen Zhangho and Xue Yinxian revelations In a July 2012 interview published by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, Chen Zhangho, the lead doctor for the Chinese Olympic team at the Los Angeles, Seoul and Barcelona Olympics told of how he had tested hormones, blood doping and steroids on about fifty elite athletes. Chen also accused the United States, the Soviet Union and France of using performance-enhancing drugs at the same time as China. Chen also blamed foreign experts for \\"lying\\" to the Chinese about the effectiveness of doping, saying he and others \\"blindly believed them like fools\\". The Chinese officials eventually concluded that training was the key to performance and that taking drugs did not guarantee this. Chen said that half of the athletes found doping effective and half did not, adding that he had steered away from growth hormones to steroids because they were cheaper. Chen said he was governed by three principles, that the athlete took the substances voluntarily, that no harm was caused and that they were effective. Xue Yinxian, former chief doctor for the Chinese gymnastics team, had previously told the newspaper that official use of steroids and growth hormone was \\"rampant\\" in the 1980s. Xue claimed that steroids and human growth hormones were officially treated as part of \\"scientific training\\", and athletes often did not know what they were being injected with. Xue did not allege that all Chinese athletes used drugs and has refrained from naming individual athletes.

It is owned by the Port of Coos Bay and operated by Coos Bay Rail Link whose parent company is ARG Transportation. History Locomotive for the Coos Bay Rail Link, Oregon, USA. On September 21, 2007, Central Oregon and Pacific Railroad (CORP) elected to shut down most of its Coos Bay branch.Longshore Shipping News Website The track was closed between Vaughn, Oregon (west of Noti) and Coquille, Oregon (south of Coos Bay). This action was taken after it was revealed that the nine aging tunnels on the line required repairs that were internally estimated to cost up to $7 million. Some local opinion regarded this action unfavorably, as the railroad asked for state funds to repair their private rail line. On October 23, 2007, the Port of Coos Bay filed a $15 million lawsuit against CORP, in response to its closing of the Coos Bay Branch. The suit claims that CORP failed to provide the required 180 days' notice that it would shut down a leased spur to the bay's North Spit. Among the line's many bridges are three swing bridges: this one in Reedsport, and others in Cushman and Coos Bay. On November 21, 2008, the Surface Transportation Board ordered CORP to sell part of the branch to the Port of Coos Bay for $16.6 million. The segment links Danebo, Oregon, in northwest Eugene, and Cordes siding, just north of North Bend. The price was much less than what RailAmerica, CORP's corporate parent, had desired ($25 million), and much closer to what the port had initially offered ($15 million). The Port completed the purchase of the line in 2009 and repaired the tunnels that led to the line's closure. The Port reopened the line as Coos Bay Rail Link. Service from Eugene to North Bend (111 miles) began in October 2011. In 2012, the railroad is continuing with a $30 million rehabilitation of the line funded primarily by grants. Work is going forward in fixing the railroad bridge into North Bend and track infrastructure to Coquille as well as repairs to track, bridges, and crossings on the entire line. The Eugene Register-Guard reported in its October 14, 2012, edition that the first locomotive to enter North Bend/Coos Bay in 5 years did so on October 12, 2012. It did not mark official reopening of this stretch of track. The locomotive was part of a work train hauling materials into the area to do repairs on the line. On April 29, 2013, the railroad ran its first freight train out of Coquille, pulling the first rail cars of plywood from the Roseburg Forest Products mill in Coquille in five and a half years. This run marked the restoration of service in the entire CBR line. Also in that year, the CBR and the Port signed a ten year agreement permitting the railroad to be the regulator operator of the rail line. In early 2014, the publication Railway Age selected the railroad as the 2014 Short Line Railroad of the Year.

The Dragonfish Nebula gets its name from a giant toothy fish known as the deep-sea dragonfish. The giant stars in this nebula blow a bubble in the surrounding gas. This bubble is over 100 light years long and forms the mouth of the dragonfish. The two largest and luminous stars, which form its eyes, are said to be newly formed stars. The stars heat up the surrounding gas, giving off infrared light. The Dragonfish Nebula contains some of the most massive stars in the milky way galaxy. This nebula was first discovered in 2010 by Mubdi Rahman and Norman Murray from the University of Toronto. They discovered a cloud of ionized gas which led them to suspect that it was formed from the radiation of nearby stars. Since then more than four hundred stars have been found and there is reason to believe that many smaller stars are hiding in the cluster. The ionized gas around this cluster produces more microwaves than most clusters in our galaxy, making the Dragonfish Nebula the brightest and most massive cluster discovered so far.  Characteristics  Due to its distance and location, it is totally invisible in visible light because the interstellar dust absorbs and reddens its light, hiding it. So in order to study it, wavelengths that are not affected, like infrared, are required. Research done with the help of the Spitzer Space Telescope has shown this object has a size of 450 light years, having a large cavity with a diameter of 100 light years that was created by the strong stellar winds of the young and massive stars inside it. As of 2011, approximately 400 stars of spectral types O and B have been identified within the nebula.

The men are then left on their own to take on the responsibilities of the women, which includes childcare, house cleaning, and employment. Episodes Reception and criticisms Hit Fix criticized the show's premise of being a \\"social experiment\\", stating that it felt more like a sitcom, that it perpetuated stereotypes of both men and Southerners, and that \\"losing fifty percent of the adults in town is going to create a hardship, regardless of whether they're male or female\\". Other criticisms focused on the helplessness of the men in the show, with one person stating that \\"I get that it is supposed to be a fish out of water story ... but if you have a 9-year-old daughter and you cannot brush her hair, you aren't a fish out of water.

The company provides end-to-end revenue cycle management services as well as modular services targeted across the revenue cycle including pre-registration, financial clearance, charge capture, coding, billing and follow-up, underpayments, and denials management. History R1 RCM was founded as Accretive Health in 2003 by Mary Tolan and Michael Cline. Tolan served as the company's president, chief executive officer, and board director until 2013. Cline served as board chairman between 2009 and 2013. In July 2011, an Accretive Health employee's laptop containing unencrypted patient data was stolen from their personal vehicle. In 2012, responding to a Senate inquiry, the company stated that nine thefts of patient data-bearing company laptops had occurred in 2011, and that 30 company laptops had lacked encryption. As a consequence, in 2013, Accretive Health entered into a 20-year settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over its data security measures. In July 2012, Accretive Health entered into a $2.5 million settlement with the Minnesota Attorney General following an investigation into the company's debt collection practices. The company admitted no wrongdoing. In April 2013, Mary Tolan stepped down as CEO. Tolan was replaced by former Dell executive Stephen Schuckenbrock. In March 2014, as a result of missed financial restatements, Accretive Health was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. Over-the- counter trading continued. On July 21, 2014, Emad Rizk replaced Schuckenbrock as CEO. In December 2014, the company restated certain previously filed financial statements and, in June 2015, announced that they had completed their 2014 SEC filings The company filed its 2015 Q2 10-Q with the SEC in August 2015. In 2015, Ascension selected Accretive Health as its exclusive hospital revenue cycle partner. As part of the transaction, Ascension and TowerBrook Capital Partners invested $200M to support growth initiatives at Accretive Health. In 2017, Accretive Health was renamed as R1 RCM. In mid-2017, R1 RCM announced a further expansion of the agreement with Ascension to include an additional $1.5B in net patient revenue handled, which included physician group revenue cycle services. In February 2018, R1 RCM announced it had agreed to acquire Intermedix Corporation for approximately $460 Million. In August 2020 R1 RCM was hit with a ransomware attack. Layoffs In 2017, R1 RCM laid off 20% of total employee strength (globally) most of which included software developers as a part of company's annual performance review process. These are the pros and cons of merger and acquisition (Ascension). The Company's financial performance predicts whether a company would expand or cut off their employees.

The site is the only documented village of earth lodges in the watershed of the Red River, and the only one that has been unambiguously affiliated with the Cheyenne tribe. An independent group of Cheyennes is believed to have occupied it c. 1724-1780. In 1980, the site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its archaeological significance. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2016. Description The Biesterfeldt Site, in a wrong spelling named for its 1930s landowner Mr. Louis Biesterfeld, is located southeast of Lisbon, on a terrace overlooking a former channel of the Sheyenne River. The main area of the site is a rough oval bounded to the northwest by a 30 feet (10 meters) step bank down to the former riverbed and on the other three sides by a fortification trench enclosing a total area of . The distance between the eastern and the western part of the trench is nearly 190 yards (170 meters). The ditch was more than 10 feet (3 meters) wide and around 4 feet (1.2 meters) deep. It had sloping sides and a relatively wide and more or less flat bottom at the middle. Something like postholes near the trench indicates the possibility that the village was shielded by a sort of palisade, although clear evidence for one is missing. The village consisted of around 70 circular earth lodges of varying size with something like a plaza near its center. It resembled the villages of the Arikara and Mandan at the Upper Missouri. The diameter of the lodges ranged from roughly 18 feet (6 meters) to 45 feet (15 meters). The entrance of alle excavated houses pointed to the southeast, except for \\"House 16\\" with its opening to the southwest. This spacious earth lodge faced the open center area in the village and could have been a ceremonial lodge. The northern portion of the enclosure shows visible evidence of scattered lodge pits, while the area to the south, more intensively farmed in later historic times, has less visible signs of occupation. Bison scapula hoes, two tools of fishbone, shaft wrenches, mauls, pottery, and other cultural artifacts, including a small amount of trade goods, were unearthed in and near the lodges. Most of the artifacts differ little from those found in for instance Arikara villages. Information gathered from historical accounts support a Cheyenne settlement. It is known through archaeological test surveys that cultural artifacts extend outside the trench, but the extent of these has not been fully bounded. Historical references According to southern Cheyenne George Bent, the villagers planted corn. Having settled within the bison range, they became big game hunters. They hunted on foot in the beginning, since they had yet to acquire horses.Hyde, George E. (1987): Life Of George Bent. Written From His Letters. Norman. In winter, they would surround the buffalo, where the snow was deep, and then kill a whole herd. The village's first mention in the historical record appears to be in 1794 in a journal kept by John Hay. Explorer and fur trader David Thompson has retold how an unnamed Cheyenne village somewhere on Sheyenne River (now assumed Biesterfeldt) was wiped out and the lodges set ablaze in battle with the Ojibwe around 1790. The Sibley expedition stopped near the locality in 1863 and both Stephen R. Riggs and A. L. Van Osdel inspected it. United States Army Captain William H. Gardner described a visit to the site in 1868, including elements of its history from surrounding Native Americans, who claimed the Cheyenne were driven out by the Dakota. Assiniboines and Crees armed with fire weapons are other enemies said to have caused the village dwellers to abandon Biesterfieldt and start a new life near independent groups of Cheyennes already living west of the Missouri. The westward migration \\"... was motivated by settling an area advantageous for trade purposes, rich in bison, and temporarily removed from military pressure ...\\". Archaeology The first archaeologist to describe the site was the pioneering archaeologist Theodore H. Lewis, in 1890. The first formal excavations took place in 1938, under the auspices of William Duncan Strong. He and his team recovered a wide variety of artifacts, from glass beads to metal weapons (arrow points and a lance tip). They found remains of bison, elk and other animals, including some horse bones. Strong noted that many of the lodges showed evidence of destruction by fire in form of charred beams. The site was used as farmland for most of the 20th century, primarily as pastureland after about 1950. The property was acquired by the Archaeological Conservancy in 2004 for permanent preservation. The site continues to be periodically investigated.

Schmandel, Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, v. 1 (Springer, 2003), p. 543, col. 2. He was influenced by Lucien Rudaux.  Biography  Ludek Pesek was born in 1919 at Kladno, Czechoslovakia, and grew up in the mining town of Ostrava close to the Beskidy Mountains. His boyhood was marked by the longing for mountains, and distant lands, laying the ground for his later interest in geology and astronomy. His potential artistic and literary talents were recognized early, and encouraged by his art teacher at grammar school. It was also on that occasion, that he first had the opportunity to use an astronomical telescope. At the age of fifteen, Ludek acquired a painter's easel, and began to practice his hobby earnestly. Later, he attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. He produced his first art works around the age of 19. His first publications were The Moon and Planets (1963), and Our Planet Earth (1967). His work first reached US readers through the National Geographic Magazine, which commissioned him to do a series of works about Mars. Previous to the Mars article, he had painted 15 scenes for an article called Journey to the Planets in August 1970. In 1967, Ludek wrote his first science-fiction novel, Log of a Moon Expedition, which he illustrated in black and white. Another, The Earth Is Near, won Prize of Honour in Germany in 1971. It was published in the UK and United States in 1974. He illustrated Space Shuttles in 1976. He worked with writer Peter Ryan on several slim books for children: Journey to the Planets (1972), Planet Earth (1972), The Ocean World (1973), and UFOs and Other Worlds (1975); he later worked with the same author on the large-format Solar System (1978). He also illustrated the excellent Bildatlas des Sonnensystems (1974), with German text by Bruno Stanek. From 1981 to 1985, he produced a series of 35 paintings on The Planet Mars, and a series of 50 paintings, Virgin Forests in the USA, one of which can be seen on the Earth page. He produced several 360-degree panoramas for projection in the domes of the planetariums at Stuttgart, Winnipeg, and Lucerne, and exhibited in Washington, D.C., Boston, Nashville, Stuttgart, Berne, Lucerne, Zurich, and other venues. His work is in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution.

Frey. The novel follows three narrators as they recount the events surrounding major turning points in the life of Gwen Pierson, a languages specialist: Evvie Pierson, Gwen's mother a housewife in rural southern Ontario; Kalp, an alien refugee from a dead planet living in England and Gwen's lover; and Basil Grey, a Welsh computer engineer. It has been described as both science fiction and as literary fiction, and has been praised for blending both genres. It has also been praised for the distinctive voices of the narrators, and for its structure: the novel, rather than chapters, is segmented into three novella-length parts (each narrated by a different character – Evvie, Kalp, and Basil) which hinge together to tell the whole story. Frey deliberately chose this structure to mimic the artistic triptych technique. Triptych received a starred review from Publishers Weekly, and was named one of the best Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Horror books of 2011 by Publishers Weekly's Rose Fox. Triptych was also nominated for the CBC Bookie Award for Science Fiction, the Lambda Literary Award for Bisexual Fiction, and the Lambda Literary Award for Science Fiction. Triptych won best Science Fiction Book at the 2012 San Francisco Book Festival, and was given an honourable mention for Science Fiction Book at the 2012 London Book Festival. The book was the #2 ebook best seller on Amazon.com its debut weekend, behind George R.R. Martin's Game of Thrones. Plot summary Before The novel begins in a small Welsh town in 2013, where Basil Grey, a mechanical engineer and a member of the United Nation's run Institute, has just witnessed his lover, an alien named Kalp, being shot to death in their living room. Basil's coworkers, led by Agent Aitken, shot him for a traitor and a spy, and drag Basil out of the house and to the Institute's interrogation rooms. He is joined by his wife, Gwen Pierson, and as she tries to convince him that Kalp had betrayed them, Basil has a revelation about a small mechanical device he had seen in the Institutes workrooms, which he has nicknamed a \\"Flasher\\". Part I: Back Narrated by Evvie Pierson, the first part of the book opens on a fall day in 1983 on the Pierson Family farm. Evvie's gardening is interrupted when an alien spaceship crash lands in her raspberry patch and the pilot attempts to murder both her and her infant daughter, Gwennie. They are saved by Basil Grey and an adult Gwen Pierson, who didn't realize that the Flasher would make them travel backwards in time. Over the course of twenty four hours, Basil attempts to repair the Flasher so they can make a return trip to the 21st Century; Gwen, Basil, and her father Mark bury both the body of the alien pilot and the space ship; and Gwen reveals to Evvie that they have a tumultuous relationship in the future and that Gwen has stopped speaking to her mother. Evvie blames herself and resolves to do her best to repair the rift when Gwen has grown up. Gwen also reveals that she was married to both Kalp and Basil in a triad relationship called an Aglunate, a tradition of Kalp's people, but that Kalp was killed for selling secrets about the Institute to a group of assassins who are targeting Institute employees. With the help Evvie, Basil and Gwen realize that the assassins are time travelling to target Aglunated Institute Employees and as such, Kalp can't have been the traitor. Overwhelmed with relief and grieving their lost lover, Basil and Gwen return to 2013 to clear Kalp's name and to try to locate the actual traitor. Evvie writes a letter to Kalp, intending to warn him of his impending death in an effort to change the future. Part II: Middle Told from Kalp's POV, this section encompasses his first meeting with Basil and Gwen (who are already dating and living together) at the Institute through to his death. Kalp is assigned to a team with Gwen and Basil, who are working together to try to build a solar power generator based on shared alien technology. Over the course of the section, it is revealed that Kalp's home planet was destroyed in a natural disaster and a very small ship of refugees was able to escape and seek asylum on Earth. Kalp's family – his Agulnates Maru and Trus – were among the dead. Kalp had volunteered to work at the Institute, which was set up by the United Nations in an effort to aid the aliens in acclimatizing to human cultures. Overwhelmed by the kindness shown to him by Basil and Gwen, Kalp soon falls in love with the couple and moves in with them. He convinces them to become his lovers on Christmas Eve, several hours after Gwen has revealed that she has fallen pregnant with Basil's child. There is an extremely negative media backlash to their Aglunation, and as a result the Aglunate is attacked outside of a concert hall. Gwen loses the baby and Kalp is grievously injured. An unknown assassins group begins to target Institute Employees, and Kalp is suspected of selling Institute training secrets to the group and placed under house arrest. Kalp receives a vaguely threatening letter from an anonymous stranger and decides that he must attempt to escape the Institute and clear his name. He is, however, caught by Agent Aitken and shot. Part III: After Basil and Gwen have returned to 2013 twenty four hours after they left. At first they are taken into custody for being AWOL and theft, but they eventually convince the Institute of both Kalp's innocence and their own. They are allowed to join a secret ops mission to break the assassin's circle and capture the ring leaders. During the assault, Gwen and Basil stumble upon a warehouse where exactly the same alien ship that they shot down in 1983 is preparing to travel back in time. They are surprised by the pilot – not an alien after all, but Agent Aitken, who reveals that she is both the mastermind behind the assassins circle and the traitor. She is an extreme bigot and zealot and has vowed to purge the world of the disgusting, unnatural people who participate in Aglunates, and has figured out how to use the alien technology to travel in time to kill those who accept and love the aliens before they can grow up and pervert the Institute. Gwen is injured in the attempt to stop her, and Basil unsuccessful at destroying the ship. He is, however, able to sabotage it. He then realizes that Agent Aitken has travelled back to the Pierson Farm in 1983, where he and Gwen will shoot the ship down and kill Aitken before the rogue agent has the ability to murder infant Gwennie. Next Basil and Gwen travel to the Pierson Farm in 2013 to retrieve the buried space ship and Aitken's remains. They travel alone in order to maintain their privacy and to keep media speculation to a minimum before the trial of the remaining assassins. After they have unburied the space ship, Mark coerces Basil to join him in mucking out barn. They discuss Basil's intentions towards Gwen, and Mark reminds Basil that he owes him a favour for destroying their betamax. Mark then offers Basil a family heirloom ring with which he'd like Basil to propose marriage to Gwen. Basil decides that he will, both in memory of Kalp and in order to open a new chapter in their lives where the shadow of the tragedy can finally be left behind. As he approaches the farm house with the ring, Basil catches sight of Evvie and Gwen's tearful reconciliation through the kitchen window. Characters =Main characters= Gwen Pierson – a Canadian woman in her early thirties. She specializes in languages, and was recruited to the Institute to help translate alien documents and speeches. She is Basil's girlfriend at the beginning of the novel and eventually also falls in love with and marries both Kalp and Basil in a traditional alien triad arrangement called an Aglunate. Gwen is initially extremely reluctant to enter into the Aglunate, but does eventually come to love Kalp as deeply as she loves Basil. Gwen is taciturn, generally snarky, and an only child. Kalp – an alien refugee from a dead world. Kalp was a structural engineer/architect on his home planet, and was in an Aglunate with Maru and Trus, who both died with the natural disaster struck. Desperately lonely and suffering acute culture shock at the beginning of the novel, he learns to adjust to Earth and falls in love with Gwen and Basil, his coworkers at the Institute. They eventually form an Aglunate of their own. Basil Grey – a Welsh mechanical engineer and super- geek. He was recruited to the Institute to help recreate beneficial alien technologies and placed on a team with Gwen. He wooed her with dirty alien poetry, and later enters into an Aglunate with Gwen and Kalp. He has two older sisters and several nieces and nephews, whom he adores. Frey admits that the inspiration for Basil came from both actor David Hewlett and the character he portrayed in Stargate: Atlantis, Dr. Rodney McKay, screenwriter Martin Gero, and the character Rhys Williams in Torchwood. Frey wanted to create an amalgam that represented the Geek Everyman she sees at science fiction conventions, the sort of person who would revel in being dropped suddenly into a world where science fiction has become social fact. Evvie Pierson – A Canadian farmer's wife, and Gwen's mother. Evvie attempts to be open-minded about her daughter's relationships but doesn't approve of Basil, initially, and his horrified to learn that Gwen is sleeping with an alien. Eventually she comes to understand that Gwen is happy with her lovers, and to accept that her own perceptions of appropriate need to alter. Mark Pierson – a Canadian farmer, and Gwen's father. Agent Aitken – a zealot and bigot who works for the Institute and is disgusted by all humans who fall in love and enter into sexual relationships with the aliens. She is secretly the head of a ring of assassins who are killing Aglunates, and murders Kalp. She is killed attempting to murder Gwen. =Secondary Characters= Maru – Kalp's first Aglunated. Deceased. Trus – Kalp's first Aglunated. Deceased. Director Addison – the head of the Institute. Agent Shelley – a tactical specialist who leads the raid on the assassin's werehouse. Agent Barnowski – killed by the assassins. Agent Edgar – killed by the assassins. Agent Lalonde– killed by the assassins. Agent Ogilvey – killed by the assassins. Had a child. Gareth Grey – Gwen and Basil's child. Killed. Derx – an alien killed by the assassins. Pias – an alien killed by the assassins. Themes Triptych has been praised for \\"smoothly updating classic science fiction themes\\", such as racism, prejudice, and genocide. The novel also explores themes of Acceptance (parenting a queer child), Culture Clash and Culture Shock, Gender Performance, and Polyamory. Critical Reception =Reviews= Triptych has been compared to James Cameron's Avatar, Neil Blomkamp's District 9, Sophia Coppolla's Lost In Translation and Robert A. Hinlien's Stranger in a Strange Land. Select Reviews: \\"Debut author Frey knocks it out of the park with a remarkable tale of alien refugees, time travel, intrigue, the pervasive madness of grief, and love that transcends culture, gender, and species. Classic science fiction elements are smoothly updated for a modern audience.\\" – Publishers Weekly's Rose Fox \\"Time travel, aliens, and the politics of sexuality combine with tragic violence in Frey's deeply satisfying debut. Aliens seeking refuge from their broken planet find it on peaceful Earth. Gwen Pierson and Basil Grey work for the U.N., helping the aliens to integrate. When alien Kalp joins their team, they learn that Kalp's people mate in threes, and soon the trio become the first human–alien marriage. Violent protests and assassinations threaten to unravel the fragile trust between the refugees and their human hosts, so Gwen and Basil follow the assassins--back in time to the 1980s, where Gwen's parents are still adjusting to raising newborn Gwennie. The near paradox is appropriately disorienting, but the story is so well-grounded in the characters that it never once loses its course. Frey tells the story from varying points of view in distinct voices, imagining a world at once completely alien and utterly human.\\"—Publishers Weekly Starred Review \\"A stirring adventure, as well as a tender love story, from a first time author who truly embraces the limitless possibilities the future may bring. JM Frey's Triptych satisfies any sci-fi reader looking for a different take on the first contact motif, or anyone looking to explore the possible evolution of human sexuality and love.\\" –Lambda Literary. \\"I was afraid we'd be left with a lot of technical asides and scientific musings to explore the aliens. Fortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. Instead of being cold and clinical, the approach here is warm and human. I won't spoil any of what happens between them, but I will say I shed tears of joy and tears of sorrow for this unusual family, and that's an accomplishment few authors can claim. Not only is this a wonderful story, but it's a wonderfully told story.\\" –Sally Sapphire, The Bibrary Bookslut \\"I finished Triptych in one go last night, couldn't put it down even. It's a very impressive first novel and if Ms. Frey continues to do with science fiction what she's done in this book she might single-handedly be credited with reviving the entire genre. Bravo! Encore, encore!\\" –Todd McCaffrey, author of The Dragonriders of Pern series. Triptych has also been panned as an extended treatise on alien/human sex and for its lack of worldbuilding and depth of exploration of Kalp's homeworld and culture. However, other commentors have pointed out that Kalp's assimilation into Earth culture is what feeds the tragedy of his life. =Awards= SAN FRANCISCO BOOK FESTIVAL Science Fiction / Fantasy – winner LAMBDA LITERARY AWARDS (June 2012) Science Fiction / Fantasy / Spec Fic – nominated Bisexual Fiction – nominated CBC BOOKIE AWARDS (March 2012) Science Fiction / Fantasy / Spec.

It is part of the country's national public radio and television service, RTVE. RNE Ràdio 4 was launched in 1976 during the Spanish transition to democracy, and was integrated into a regional countrywide Radio 4 network in 1988 after the closure of the state-owned but commercially funded Radiocadena Española in that same year. The integrated regional countrywide Radio 4 network was shut down in 1991 due to poor ratings, and RNE Ràdio 4 once again became a standalone radio station. In 2006 however, RNE Ràdio 4 was itself threatened with the prospect of closure due to a very low audience share (only 8,500 listeners in Catalonia out of a population of 7.5 million people). This sparked a campaign against closure of the station, which eventually proved successful after Santiago Gonzalez, the then newly appointed director of RNE (Radio Nacional de España), decided against closing Ràdio 4.

Starring Nick Berry as protagonist Mike Nicholls, a former Royal Navy officer who returns to his childhood town of Bridehaven to take on the role of harbourmaster.http://www.wdlh.co.uk/tv- programmes/ The first series featured on storylines including a blossoming romance with local constable Melanie Rush (Tina Hobley), the ruthless business dealings of Tony Simpson (Gerard Horan), and the inter-family feuding of the Blades — Steve, George, Jason, Kelly and Rita.

For this reason, historians consider John Punch the \\"first official slave in the English colonies,\\" and his case as the \\"first legal sanctioning of lifelong slavery in the Chesapeake.\\" Historians also consider this to be one of the first legal distinctions between Europeans and Africans made in the colony, and a key milestone in the development of the institution of slavery in the United States.Paul Finkelman (1985). Slavery in the Courtroom: An Annotated Bibliography of American Cases (Library of Congress). p. 3 In July 2012, Ancestry.com published a paper suggesting that John Punch was a twelfth-generation grandfather of President Barack Obama on his mother's side, on the basis of historic and genealogical research and Y-DNA analysis.\\"Ancestry.com Discovers Ph Suggests\\" , The New York Times.

Punch is also believed to be one of the paternal ancestors of the 20th-century American diplomat Ralph Bunche, the first African American to win the Nobel Peace Prize.Paul Heinegg, \\"Bunch Family\\", Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware, 1995-2000. Note: Heinegg believes that Bunche was descended from Bunch ancestors established as free blacks in Virginia before the American Revolution. There were men of the Bunch surname in South Carolina by the end of the 18th century. Quote: \\"Others [of Bunch Family] in South Carolina i.

The 1900 and 1910 census for Detroit lists several members of the Bunch family who were born in South Carolina, but Fred Bunch was not among them.\\" Context Africans were first brought to Jamestown, Virginia, in 1619. However, their status as slaves or indentured servants remains unclear. Philip S. Foner pointed out the differing perceptions held by historians, saying: > Some historians believe that slavery may have existed from the very first > arrival of the Negro in 1619, but others are of the opinion that the > institution did not develop until the 1660s and that the status of the Negro > until then was that of an indentured servant. Still others believe that the > evidence is too sketchy to permit any definite conclusion either way. Historian Alden T. Vaughan also recognizes differing opinions over when the institution of slavery started, but he says that most scholars agree that both free black people and enslaved black people were found in the Virginia colony by 1640. He notes, \\"On the first point--the status of blacks before the passage of the slave laws--the issue is not whether some were free or some were slave. Almost everyone acknowledges the existence of both categories by the 1640s, if not from the beginning.\\"  Life  John Punch was a servant of Virginia planter Hugh Gwyn, a wealthy landowner, justice, and member of the House of Burgesses, representing Charles River County (which became York County in 1642).Descent of the Bunch Family in Virginia and the Carolinas, Ancestry.com, July 15, 2012 In 1640, Punch ran away to Maryland accompanied by two of Gwyn's European indentured servants. All three were caught and returned to Virginia. On 9 July, the Virginia Governor's Council, which served as the colony's highest court, sentenced both Europeans to have their terms of indenture extended by another four years each. However, they sentenced Punch to \\"serve his said master or his assigns for the time of his natural Life here or elsewhere.\\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1p262.html, Virginia recognizes slavery 1661 - 1663 In addition, the council sentenced the three men to thirty lashes each.

The Black American in United States History A. Leon Higginbotham Jr. said, \\"Thus, although he committed the same crime as the Dutchman and the Scotsman, John Punch, a black man, was sentenced to lifetime slavery.\\" Winthrop Jordan also described this court ruling as \\"the first definite indication of outright enslavement appears in Virginia ... the third being a negro named John Punch shall serve his said master or his assigns for the time of his natural life here or else where.\\" Theodore W. Allen notes that the court's \\"being a negro\\" justification made no explicit reference to precedent in English or Virginia common law, and suggests that the court members may have been aware of common law that held a Christian could not enslave a Christian (with Punch being presumed to be a non-Christian, unlike his accomplices), wary of the diplomatic friction that would come of enslaving non-English Europeans, and possibly hopeful of replicating the lifetime indentures of African slaves held in the Caribbean and South American colonies.Theodore W. Allen, \\"Summary of the Argument of The Invention of the White Race\\" , Cultural Logic Significance In his A Biographical History of Blacks in America since 1528 (1971), Toppin explains the importance of Punch's case in the legal history of Virginia: > Thus, the black man, John Punch, became a slave unlike the two white > indentured servants who merely had to serve a longer term.

John Donoghue said, \\"This can be interpreted as the first legal sanctioning of lifelong slavery in the Chesapeake.\\" Historians consider this difference in penalties to mark the case as one of the first to make a racial distinction between black and white indentured servants.\\"Slavery and Indentured Servants\\", Law Library of Congress Tom Costa in his article, \\"Runaway Slaves and Servants in Colonial Virginia\\" says, \\"Scholars have argued that this decision represents the first legal distinction between Europeans and Africans to be made by Virginia courts.\\" Indentured status Some historians have speculated that Punch may never have been an indentured servant. In his 1913 study of free negroes in Virginia, John Henderson Russell points out that the court decision was ambiguous. If Punch was not a servant with future prospects of freedom, his sentencing was less harsh than his white accomplices. If Punch was a servant, then his punishment was much more severe than that of his white accomplices. But Russell states that the \\"most reasonable explanation\\" was that the Dutchman and the Scot, being white, were given only four additional years on top of their remaining terms of indenture, while Punch, \\"being a negro, was reduced from his former condition of servitude for a limited time to a condition of slavery for life.\\"John Henderson Russell. The Free Negro In Virginia, 1619-1865, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1913, pp. 29-30, scanned text online Russell noted that the court did not refer to an indentured contract related to Punch, but notes that he was a \\"servant,\\" and it was most reasonable that he was a limited-term servant (of some sort) before he was sentenced to \\"slavery for life\\". In the same 2012 article referenced above, Perry says that the court ruling specifically refers to the indentured contracts of Victor and James Gregory and extends them, while the court decision refers to John Punch only as a servant. Perry adds, > \\"What is likely is that\\" Punch \\"was previously subjected to limited-term > chattel bond-servitude\\" and says \\"that in Virginia chattelization was > imposed on free laborers, tenants, and bond-servants increasingly after > 1622, that it was imposed on both European and African descended laborers, > that it was a qualitative break from English labor law, and that the > chattelization of plantation labor constituted an essential precondition of > the emergence of the subsequent lifetime chattel bond-servitude imposed on > African American laborers in continental Anglo-America under the system of > racial slavery and racial oppression.\\"Jeffrey B. Perry, \\"There's No Basis > for the Claims that John Punch was 'Indentured' -- Or That His Fellow > Escapees Were 'White'\\", History News Network, August 6, 2012 Descendants Drawing on a combination of historical documents and autosomal DNA analysis, Ancestry.com stated in July 2012 that it is a strong likelihood that United States President Barack Obama is an eleventh-great- grandson of Punch through his mother Stanley Ann Dunham.Hennessey, Kathleen. \\"Obama related to legendary Virginia slave, genealogists say\\", Los Angeles Times. July 30, 2012. Genealogical research indicates that some time in the 1630s, Punch married a white woman, likely also an indentured servant. By 1637 he had fathered a son called John Bunch (labelled by genealogists as \\"John Bunch I\\"). While researchers cannot definitively prove that Punch was the father of Bunch, he is the only known African man of that time and place who is a possible progenitor. Punch and his wife are known as the first black and white couple in the colonies who left traceable descendants. It remains possible that the father of Bunch was another African, of whom there is no record, but the similarity of the names would still need to be explained. Due to some challenges by racially mixed children of Englishmen to being enslaved, in 1662 the Virginia colony incorporated the principle of partus sequitur ventrem into slave law. This law held that children in the colonies were born into the status of their mothers; therefore, children of slave mothers were born into slavery, regardless of whether their fathers were free and English or European. In this way, slavery was made a racial caste associated with people of African ancestry. The law overturned the English common law applicable to the children of two English subjects in England, in which the father's social status determined that of the child.Taunya Lovell Banks, \\"Dangerous Woman: Elizabeth Key's Freedom Suit – Subjecthood and Racialized Identity in Seventeenth Century Colonial Virginia\\", 41 Akron Law Review 799 (2008), Digital Commons Law, University of Maryland Law School, accessed 21 Apr 2009 At the same time, this law meant that racially mixed children of white women were born into their mother's free status. Paul Heinegg, in his Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware found that most families of free black people in the 1790–1810 U.S. censuses could be traced to children of white women and black men, whether free, indentured servant, or slave, in colonial Virginia. Their children were born free and the families were established as free before the Revolution. Punch's male descendants probably became known by the surname Bunch, a very rare name among colonial families. Before 1640, there were fewer than 100 African men in Virginia, and John Punch was the only one with a surname similar to Bunch.Paul C. Reed, Natalie D. Cottrill, Joseph B. Shumway, and Anastasia Harman, \\"Descent of the Bunch Family in Virginia and the Carolinas\\", 15 July 2012, Ancestry.com, accessed 14 November 2012 The Bunch descendants were free black people who became successful land-owners in Virginia. Some lines eventually assimilated as white, after generations of marrying white. In September 1705 a man referred to by researchers as John Bunch III petitioned the General Court of Virginia for permission to publish banns for his marriage to Sarah Slayden, a white woman, but their minister had refused to publish the banns. (There had been a ban on marriages between Negroes and whites, but Bunch posed a challenge, as he was apparently the son of a white woman, with only a degree of African ancestry. The petition argued that mulatto meant a person of half Negro and half white ancestry.) This John Bunch appealed the denial to the General Court of Virginia. The Court's decision is unknown, but the following month the government of Virginia responded by issuing a statute expanding the use of the term mulatto. It held that anyone who was a child, grandchild or great-grandchild of an African or Native American was a mulatto. In the early nineteenth century, racially mixed people of less than one-eighth African or Native American ancestry (equivalent to one great-grandparent) were considered legally white. Many racially mixed people lived as white in frontier areas, where they were treated in accordance with their community and fulfillment of citizen obligations.Ariela Gross, \\"Of Portuguese Origin\\": Litigating Identity and Citizenship among the 'Little Races' in Nineteenth-Century America\\", Law and History Review, Vol.25 (3), The History Cooperative. Retrieved June 22, 2008. This was a looser definition than that established in 1924, when Virginia adopted the \\"one-drop rule\\" under its Racial Integrity Act, which defined as black anyone with any known black ancestry, no matter how limited. Records do not show a marriage for John Bunch III, but the mother of one of his children was later noted as being named Rebecca. He had moved to Louisa County as part of the colonial westward migration to the frontiers of Virginia. Through continued intermarriage with white families in Virginia, the line of Obama's maternal Bunch ancestors probably were identified as white as early as 1720. Members of this line eventually migrated into Tennessee and ultimately to Kansas, where descendants included Obama's maternal grandmother and his mother Stanley Ann Dunham. Another line of the Bunch family migrated to North Carolina, where they were classified in some records as mulatto. They intermarried with people of a variety of ethnic origins, including European. The Bunch (sometimes spelled Bunche) family was established as free before the American Revolution. The Bunch surname lines also became associated with the core racially mixed families later known as Melungeon in Tennessee. Bunch family members also lived in South Carolina by the end of the 18th and early 19th centuries. Several members of the Bunch family from South Carolina were living in Detroit, Michigan, by the 1900 and 1910 censuses, as a result of moving in the Great Migration. Researcher Paul Heinegg, known for his genealogy work on free African Americans of the colonial and early federal periods,\\"Descent of the Bunch Family in Virginia and the Carolinas\\", p. 6. Quote: \\"Heinegg has done an extraordinary job constructing the genealogies of free blacks and should be one of the first sources people check for African-American ancestry in the colonial period.\\" believes that Fred Bunche was among those Bunch descendants from South Carolina, as people often migrated in related groups. His son Ralph Bunche, born in Detroit, earned a doctorate in political science and taught at the university level. He helped plan the United Nations, mediated in Israel, and later served as U.S. Minister to the United Nations, eventually being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Y-DNA testing of direct male descendants of the Bunch family lines has revealed a common ancestry going back to a single male ancestor of African ethnicity. Genealogists believe this male ancestor to be John Punch the African. He was probably born in present-day Cameroon in West Africa, where his particular type of DNA is most common.

On April 2, 2012, Microsoft announced the development of Orcs Must Die! 2 at the Penny Arcade Expo in Boston (PAX East), with their emphasis on co-operative gameplay as the principal addition over the original. Gameplay Like its predecessor, Orcs Must Die! 2 is a variation on a tower defense game. As either the War Mage or Sorceress in the campaign mode, the player must attempt to defend one or more Rifts (Up To 3) from an onslaught of orc armies that emerge from one or more doors in a given level. The orc armies arrive in waves, between which the player is given time to recover and place additional traps; except for Nightmare difficulty, roughly every three waves includes a longer respite that lets the player determine when to release the next wave. To defeat the orcs, the player selects a number of traps, spells, and equipment from their Spellbook (up to ten in single player modes). Placing traps can be done at any time, but costs a certain amount of in-game currency to do so; this money is either given at the start of the level and as bonuses between level, for killing orcs, or as coins that can be picked up by the player. Traps can also be sold back but only during breaks between waves. Traps include those that are placed on ground, wall, or ceiling, which typically activate once and then require a short reset period before they are ready again; traps can also include Guardians, creatures that will act on their own like archers or knights, who can be injured and knocked down by the orcs until either the major respite between waves or by the player with special equipment. The player can also fight directly using weapons from their Spellbook, including magical abilities that consume mana. The player must watch their health; if they lose their health or fall off a level, they will respawn immediately but lose a number of Rift points. Players can heal by being near a Rift, collecting health or mana potions dropped by defeated orcs, or using special equipment. Every orc that makes it through the player's traps to a Rift will cost a number of Rift points. If the Rift points drop to zero, the level is considered lost and the player will have to start again. Otherwise, if the player successfully completes the level, they are awarded a number of skulls; up to five skulls are earned based on the number of Rift points remaining and the how long it took to complete the level, and additional skulls can be gained based on score or collected from fallen orcs. The first five skulls can only be earned once on any level, while the bonus skulls are earned every time the level is played. Skulls are used to improve traps and equipment that will permanently remain with that player, allowing players to return to earlier levels with improved traps and equipment as to improve their score. Within the sequel, each trap and equipment can now be boosted up by three levels and include one or more optional improvements, such as causing additional status effects on affected orcs when activated, but only one of these improvements can be activate at any time for that trap or equipment. Players are also rewarded with a new trap or equipment the first time they complete a level. The game includes a cooperative mode, where one player plays as the War Mage and the other as the Sorceress; within the campaign, the two characters gain traps and equipment in different order as rewards for completing levels; however, players can purchase new traps with skulls as well. In this mode, each player can be only 5 trap spells or equipment in addition to their main weapon. Within the game, players can interact with certain traps placed by the other player - such as triggering a ceiling rock fall - but otherwise cannot sell the other player's traps. Equipment can have benefits that apply to both players, such as an artifact that passively improves the speed of trap resets. In addition to campaign mode, the game includes an \\"Endless\\" mode for both single and cooperative mode, where the players must hold off forty waves of orcs from all the various types in the game. The game offers weekly challenges, typically restricting the players to one or two types of traps and equipment. Additional downloadable content provides new levels, traps, equipment and monster types. The players also gain the ability to buy new costumes for their characters. Plot The game takes place a few days after the events of Orcs Must Die!. The Sorceress is hiding from The Mob when mysteriously, a Rift opens next to her. She steps through, and finds herself in the Dwarven Mines, right in front of The War Mage, who now works at the mines. She enlists his help in fighting off the Orcs. The two discover that more and more rifts are opening in different locations. They decide to enter the rift and return to the Dead World. It is revealed that the War Mage's master had not died; he was still alive, and had opened a small, weak rift to allow the Sorceress to escape and battle the Mob together. After the War Mage and the Sorceress begin to communicate with their master, he explains that he started to open the Rifts again because the world beyond the Rifts could not cope without the magic the Rifts provided. After the two have defended the last Rift, the magic fully returned to the world. The War Mage's master disappeared and the War Mage states that he and the Sorceress will 'always be out there on the Fortress walls, guarding the Rifts and protecting the world, because they (the Orc Mob) will always be out there'. Reception Orcs Must Die! 2 received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The Digital Fix gave it nine out of ten and called it \\"one the biggest grin inducing PC titles on the market today.\\" The Escapist also gave it four-and-a-half stars out of five and said that the game \\"continues to build on its predecessor which cleverly matched together two different genres into a fun and quirky title, and the addition of co-op dials the enjoyment up a notch.\\" Metro UK gave the game a score of eight out of ten and called it \\"one of the best Tower Defense action hybrids so far, with considerably more depth than the original - even if it still looks like the same game.\\" Sequel On April 11, 2014, Robot Entertainment announced a third installment of the franchise called Orcs Must Die! Unchained. According to Robot Entertainment, the game is a multiplayer-only free-to-play game, able to support up to 5v5 battles between two factions (The Order and The Unchained), and released in 2016. On July 14, 2020, Robot Entertainment released a direct sequel to Orcs Must Die! 2, Orcs Must Die! 3, exclusive to Stadia.

It is a monument historique, a national heritage site of France. History =Early= The site is first mentioned during the twelfth century as Augerville, then a hamlet, in a charter from 1119. From 1207 onwards, Augerville was a stronghold for Philippe d'Augerville and his son Louis. There they built a château fort flanked by a pigeonnier. Louis d'Augerville died in 1248 without an heir, so the estate went to brothers Pierre and Dreux de Beaumont. During the Hundred Years War, the son of Pierre de Beaumont, Jean de Beaumont, sided with the English. He was sentenced to death by the provost of Paris and was executed on September 6, 1367. His property was confiscated but later returned to his widow, Jeanne de Courtenay. She died without any children, so a nearby branch of the family took Augerville in 1403, in the person of another Jean de Beaumont. At his death, his brother Pierre de Beaumont inherited the castle but had to flee an English occupation. His lands were redistributed by the occupying English to French supporters of Henry VI of England. The pigeonnier and other buildings on the grounds. The château fort was a ruin by the time it was purchased by Jacques Cœur, a merchant and major financier of King Charles VII, in 1452. Cœur had little time to enjoy the property, as he was put on trial for royal embezzlement and sentenced to exile, where he died in 1456. All of his property was confiscated by the crown. Catherine de' Medici and her son, King Charles IX, stayed at the château in September 1562. An asset inventory of the fiefdom of Augerville-la-Rivière, dated June 30, 1582, noted that the château fort was surrounded by walls and a moat, fed by the Essonne River. It had a garden, a courtyard, a barn, a theatre, and a pigeonnier. After another period of abandonment, the château was sold for taxes on October 22, 1637. It went through another owner, who began to restore it as a country house in 1644, but found it to be too large a task. It was bought in 1644 by Jean Perrault de Montevrault, who had the facades of the château and apartments restored and added two detached wings, a new pigeonnier, a new barn, and created a forecourt surrounded by estate buildings. =Later= One of the forecourt buildings of the château. A side gate and the exterior wall. The château was auctioned off in 1825. At that time it was described as being having forty-six rooms on three floors, with the south facade overlooking the park and including thirty-four windows and three doors. The northern facade at the time was noted to have thirty windows overlooking the main courtyard. The estate was purchased by Antoine Pierre Berryer, advocate and counselor to the French parliament. He spent much of his time restoring and expanding the property. His notable guests at the estate included François-René de Chateaubriand, Alexandre Dumas, fils, Franz Liszt, Gioachino Rossini, Alfred de Musset, and Eugène Delacroix. Following the death of Berryer in 1868, the estate went to his sister. She continued to make improvements. With her death, the property again passed to an absentee owner and was largely neglected. It was bought by Count de Pange in 1912. He restored facades, the gardens, and lands before reselling to industrialist Felix Mouton in 1919. In the summer of 1926 the estate was purchased by American socialite Alva Belmont, formerly Mrs. William Kissam Vanderbilt, who restored it as her primary residence. It had been one of several inspirations for her châteauesque-style Petit Château in Manhattan. Her daughter, Consuelo Vanderbilt (who had married Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough), wrote that she thought that Jacques Cœur's reported ownership had partially inspired her mother to buy the estate. Belmont did much restoration and renovation during her ownership. She had the river flowing through the estate widened because she said, as Consuelo later wrote, \\"This river is not wide enough.\\" She brought in paving stones from Versailles to cover the previously sand-paved great forecourt between the house and the village. She had a massive neo-Gothic portal gate erected on the northern entrance road, separating the château and village from the surrounding farmland. Changes inside the château included replacement of the wrought iron staircases and moving the kitchens to the basement. She also added a bowling alley in one of the buildings on the estate, one of the first in France. After her death in 1933, the chateau was left to Consuelo, who sold it to a Swiss company in the winter of 1937. From 1986 to 1989, the château and estate were resold twice. It is now a luxury hotel, complete with a golf course. The course, established in 1995, has 18 holes and was designed by Olivier Dongradi.

The company was active in the Unix, PC, Linux and Macintosh markets, and grew through both organic development and acquisitions. Its best known products were the Informix databases, of which there were several different families. Other well known products included a development environment called 4GL, a spreadsheet called Wingz, and a data warehouse oriented database system called Redbrick, and the Ascential information integration family of products. The Informix brand and database products were acquired by IBM in 2001, and several of the most popular products remain in market and are continuing to be enhanced by IBM. For information on the current Informix branded database software products see the article IBM Informix. At the time of the acquisition of Informix by IBM a smaller spin-off company was created, Ascential Software, focused on the information integration and ETL markets. Ascential Software was later acquired by IBM as well, in 2005. = Founding and early history = Founders Roger Sippl and Laura King worked at Cromemco, an early S-100/CP/M company, where they developed a small relational database based on ISAM techniques, as a part of a report-writer software package. Sippl and King left Cromemco to found Relational Database Systems (RDS) in 1980. Their first product, Marathon, was essentially a 16-bit version of their earlier ISAM work, made available first on the C8000 from Onyx Systems. At RDS, they turned their attention to the emerging RDBMS market and released their own product as Informix (INFORMation on unIX) in 1981. It included their own Informer language. It featured the ACE report writer, used to extract data from the database and present it to users for easy reading. It also featured the PERFORM screen form tool, which allowed a user to interactively query and edit the data in the database. The final release of this product was version 3.30 in early 1986. In 1985, they introduced a new SQL-based query engine as part of INFORMIX-SQL (or ISQL) version 1.10 (version 1.00 was never released). This product also included SQL variants of ACE and PERFORM. The most significant difference between ISQL and the previous Informix product was the separation of the database access code into an engine process (sqlexec), rather than embedding it directly in the client — thus setting the stage for client-server computing, with the database running on a separate machine from the user's machine. The underlying ISAM-based file storage engine was known as C-ISAM. Through the early 1980s Informix remained a small player, but as Unix and SQL grew in popularity during the mid-1980s, their fortunes changed. By 1986 they had become large enough to float a successful IPO, and changed the company name to Informix Software. The products included INFORMIX-SQL version 2.00 and INFORMIX-4GL 1.00, both of which included the database engine as well as development tools (I4GL for programmers, ISQL for non-programmers). A series of releases followed, including a new query engine, initially known as INFORMIX-Turbo. Turbo used the new Random Sequential Access Method (RSAM), with great multi-user performance benefits over C-ISAM. With the release of the version 4.00 products in 1989, Turbo was renamed INFORMIX-OnLine (in part because it permitted coherent database backups while the server was online and users were modifying the data), and the original server based on C-ISAM was separated from the tools (ISQL and I4GL) and named INFORMIX-SE (Standard Engine). Version 5.00 of Informix OnLine was released at the very end of 1990, and included full distributed transaction support with two-phase commit and stored procedures. Version 5.01 was released with support for triggers too. = Innovative Software acquisition = In 1988, Informix purchased Innovative Software, makers of a DOS and Unix-based office system called SmartWare and WingZ, a spreadsheet program for the Apple Macintosh. WingZ provided a graphical user interface, supported larger, 32768x32768 dimension spreadsheets, and offered programming in a HyperCard-like language known as HyperScript. The original release proved successful, becoming the number two spreadsheet, behind Microsoft Excel. In 1990, WingZ ports started appearing for a number of other platforms, mostly Unix variants. During this period, many financial institutions began investing in Unix workstations as a route to increasing the desktop \\"grunt\\" required to run large financial models. For a brief period[not specific enough to verify], Wingz was successfully marketed into this niche. However it suffered from a lack of development and marketing resources. By the early 1990s WingZ had become uncompetitive, and Informix eventually sold it in 1995. Informix also sold a license to Claris, who combined it with a rather updated GUI as Claris Resolve. = Dynamic Scalable Architecture = With its failure in office automation products, Informix refocused on the growing database server market. In 1994, as part of a collaboration with Sequent Computer Systems, Informix released its version 6.00 database server, which featured its new Dynamic Scalable Architecture, DSA. DSA involved a major rework of the core engine of the product, supporting both horizontal parallelism and vertical parallelism, and based on a multi- threaded core well suited towards the symmetric multiprocessing systems that Sequent pioneered and that major vendors like Sun Microsystems and Hewlett- Packard would eventually follow up on. The two forms of parallelism made the product capable of market-leading levels of scalability, both for OLTP and data warehousing. Now known as Informix Dynamic Server (after briefly entertaining the name Obsidian and then being named Informix OnLine Dynamic Server), Version 7 hit the market in 1994. Version 7 consistently won performance benchmarks. Building on the success of Version 7, Informix split its core database development investment into two efforts. One effort, first known as XMP (for eXtended Multi-Processing), became the Version 8 product line, also known as XPS (for eXtended Parallel Server). This effort focused on enhancements in data warehousing and parallelism in high-end platforms, including shared-nothing platforms such as IBM's RS-6000/SP. = Illustra acquisition = The second focus, which followed the late 1995 purchase of Illustra, concentrated on object-relational database (O-R) technology. Illustra, written by ex-Postgres team members and led by database pioneer Michael Stonebraker, included various features that allowed it to return fully formed objects directly from the database, a feature that can significantly reduce programming time in many projects. Illustra also included a feature known as DataBlades that allowed new data types and features to be included in the basic server as options. These included solutions to a number of thorny SQL problems, namely time series, spatial and multimedia data. Informix integrated Illustra's O-R mapping and DataBlades into the 7.x OnLine product, resulting in Informix Universal Server (IUS), or more generally, Version 9. Both new versions, V8 (XPS) and V9 (IUS), appeared on the market in 1996, making Informix the first of the \\"big three\\" database companies (the others being Oracle and Sybase) to offer built-in O-R support. Commentators paid particular attention to the DataBlades, which soon became very popular: dozens appeared within a year, ported to the new architecture after partnerships with Illustra. This left other vendors scrambling, with Oracle introducing a \\"grafted on\\" package for time-series support in 1997, and Sybase turning to a third party for an external package which remains an unconvincing solution. = Billboard taunting Oracle = In 1997 Informix purchased a billboard on the interstate across from Oracle's headquarters in Redwood City, CA. The billboard read \\"Dinosaur Crossing\\", a tongue-in-cheek jab at Oracle's supposed lagging state in the industry. = Internal problems = Although Informix took a technological lead in the database software market, product releases began to fall behind schedule by late 1996. Plagued with technical and marketing problems, a new application development product, Informix-NewEra, was soon overshadowed by the emerging Java programming language. Michael Stonebraker had promised that the Illustra technology would be integrated within a year after the late 1995 acquisition, but as Gartner Group had predicted, the integration required more than 2 years. Unhappy with the new direction of the company, XPS lead architect Gary Kelley suddenly resigned and joined arch-rival Oracle Corporation in early 1997, taking 11 of his developers with him.[1] Informix ultimately sued Oracle to prevent loss of trade secrets. As part of a formal settlement negotiated between the two companies, the lawsuit was withdrawn and Informix issued a statement retracting their accusations against the former employees. Other details of the settlement were not made public. = Misgovernance and executive wrongdoing = Corporate misgovernance overshadowed Informix's technical successes. On April 1, 1997, Informix announced that first quarter revenues fell short of expectations by $100 million. CEO Phillip White blamed the shortfall on a loss of focus on the core database business while devoting too many resources to object-relational technology. Huge operating losses and job cuts followed. Informix re-stated earnings from 1994 through 1996. A significant amount of revenue from the mid-1990s involved software license sales to partners who did not sell through to an end-user customer; this and other irregularities led to overstating revenue by over $200 million. Even after White's departure in July, 1997, the company continued to struggle with accounting practices, re-stating earnings again in early 1998. = New leaders and renewed success = The capabilities of Informix Dynamic Server (IDS) began to strengthen. New leadership began to emerge as well. An excerpt from the September 22, 1998 issue of PC Magazine's article on the top 100 companies that are changing the way you compute: :\\"Informix is battling rival Oracle in the object/relational arena by extending its flagship Informix Dynamic Server with a Universal Data Option. After a turbulent year that included a problematic audit, Robert Finnocchio was appointed as the new CEO of the Menlo Park, California company. With 1997 revenues of $662.3 million, Informix has begun to strengthen its position in the database market.\\" = Phil White indicted and pleads guilty = In November 2002, Phillip White, the former CEO of Informix ousted in 1997, was indicted by a federal grand jury and charged with eight counts of securities, wire, and mail fraud. In a plea bargain thirteen months later, he pleaded guilty to a single count of filing a false registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In May 2004, the Department of Justice announced that White was sentenced to two months in federal prison for securities fraud, with a fine of $10,000, two years of supervised release, and 300 hours of community service. The announcement noted that the loss to shareholders caused by the violation could not reasonably be estimated under the facts of the case. White's earlier plea agreement had limited prison time to no more than 12 months. Walter Königseder, the company's vice president in charge of European operations, was also indicted by a federal grand jury. However, he was a citizen and resident of Germany, and the United States was unable to secure his extradition. In November 2005, Steve W. Martin, a longtime Informix employee, published a book detailing the rise and fall of Informix Software and CEO Phil White, titled The Real Story of Informix Software and Phil White: Lessons in Business and Leadership for the Executive Team. = Informix acquires Ardent Software = In March 2000, Informix acquired Ardent Software, a company with a history of mergers and acquisitions. That acquisition gave Informix the legacy MultiValue database platforms UniVerse and UniData, known collectively as U2 (now Rocket U2), as well as a small but growing set of Extract Transform and Load (ETL) and other information integration products, the latter were the target of the acquisition being well positioned in a fast-growing market segment. In July 2000, the former CEO of Ardent, Peter Gyenes, became the CEO of Informix, and soon re-organized Informix to make it more attractive as an acquisition target. The major step was separating the database engine technologies from the recently acquired Ardent Software ETL and Information Integration products. = Informix divests: acquisition of the Informix Database business by IBM = In April 2001, IBM negotiated with Informix to buy the core database business. Prompted by a suggestion from Wal-Mart, one of Informix's largest customers, IBM bought from Informix the database technology, the brand, the plans for future development (an internal project codenamed \\"Arrowhead\\"), and the customer base (over 100,000 customers) associated with these items. The deal closed on July 1, 2001. Approximately 2,000 Informix employees moved to IBM as part of the deal. = Informix renames itself Ascential and moves into ETL business = Informix shareholders approved this deal, which delivered $1 billion in cash to the much smaller remaining company, which intended to focus on the high growth ETL and information integration space, dominated at the time by Informatica. The company renamed itself Ascential Software, and continued to be led by CEO Peter Geyenes and President Peter Fiore. Ascential Software made use of its large cash holdings from the Informix sale to buy a number of smaller companies with technology. Many were had at bargain prices as the software industry was caught up in the economic slump following the 9/11/2001 terrorist attacks. Despite these acquisitions Ascential was not able to ever come anywhere near matching the financial performance of Informix prior to the sale, and were eventually forced to perform a 4 for 1 reverse stock split to ensure that the stock was not delisted from NASDAQ for falling below the minimum share price. = IBM buys Ascential = In May 2005, IBM bought Ascential, reuniting all of Informix's assets under IBM's Information Management Software portfolio. The deal paid Ascential shareholders $1.1 billion, however IBM assumed control of $481 million in cash that Ascential had retained from the Informix sale. Shareholders received $18.50 a share, a 15% premium over the previous close of $15.70. Shareholders who had held on from the Informix era did not fare so well, after accounting for the reverse split the deal netted them only $4.62 a share, far less than the price before IBM's first acquisition, which had hovered a bit over $7.00 through March 2001. Prior to its purchase, Informix's product lineup included: * Informix C-ISAM - the latest version of the original Marathon database * Informix Standard Engine (SE) - offered as a low- end system for embedding into applications * Informix OnLine(Online 5)- a competent system for managing medium size databases * Informix Dynamic Server(IDS, V7)- the product from which V9, V10 and V11 directly descended.) * Informix Extended Parallel Server (XPS, V8) - a high-end version based on V7 code base for use on clusters and MPP machines. Focused on Data Warehouse workloads, but with full OLTP capability. * Informix Universal Server (V9) - a combination of the V7 OnLine engine with the O-R mapping and DataBlade support from Illustra. The basis for V10 and V11 * Informix-4GL - A fourth generation language for application programming * Red Brick Warehouse - a data warehouse product * Cloudscape - an RDBMS written entirely in Java that fits into mobile devices on the low-end and J2EE-based architectures on the high end. In 2004 Cloudscape was released by IBM as an Open Source database to be managed by the Apache Software Foundation under the name Derby. * U2 suite, UniVerse and UniData - MultiValue databases that offer networks, hierarchies, arrays and other data formats difficult to model in SQL  See also  * List of relational database management systems * Comparison of relational database management systems  References   External links  * \\"Oral History of Roger Sippl\\", Interviewed by Luanne Johnson, Recorded: December 13, 2005 and January 12, 2006, Mountain View, California, Computer History Museum, p. 14 * \\"Informix Corporation History\\", Funding Universe.com Defunct computer companies of the United States Companies established in 1980 IBM acquisitions ","title":"Informix Corporation"},{"id":"36589979","text":"Qaleh-ye Sorkh (, also Romanized as Qal‘eh-ye Sorkh and Qal‘eh Sorkh; also known as Qal‘a Surkh and Qal‘eh Surkh) is a village in Bala Jam Rural District, Nasrabad District, Torbat-e Jam County, Razavi Khorasan Province, Iran.

History The company's name was derived from the names of its two founders: the letters \\"NE\\" stood for the name of the entrepreneur Heinrich Nebenzahl, and the letters \\"RO\\" for the initials of director Richard Oswald. It was founded as Nero-Film GmbH, a limited liability company, and was converted into an Aktiengesellschaft, Nero-Film AG, in 1927. Under the influence of Nebenzahl's son Seymour Nebenzal, Nero-Film was one of the most artistically ambitious production companies in Germany, and with directors like G.W. Pabst and Fritz Lang it produced a number of major films of the Weimar era, such as Pandora's Box, Westfront 1918, The Threepenny Opera, M, Kameradschaft, L'Atlantide and The Testament of Dr. Mabuse. In the film industry, the bourgeois-democratic Nero-Film and the proletarian Prometheus Film were the last bulwark against the rise of artistic Nazism. After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Seymour Nebenzal was forced to emigrate, and Nero-Film AG was put out of business. The Testament of Dr. Mabuse became the first film censored by the Nazi government; Nebenzal and Director Fritz Lang appeared before Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels, who ordered Mabuse destroyed and banned it from the Reich. Nebenzal, using his American passport, fled that evening to Switzerland and then to France, where he re-established his company as Production Nero Film and, among other French productions, collaborated with the Director Anatole Litvak to produce Mayerling, a huge success for the star, Charles Boyer. Fleeing again to Los Angeles, as the Nazis invaded France, Nebenzal again re-established the company under the name of Nero Films Inc. Nebenzal's son, Harold, still manages the films in the Nero collection, including supervising a new print of his father's remake for Columbia Pictures in 1951 of M, directed by Joseph Losey that was featured at Cannes Film Festival in 2016.

Camp was born July 29, 1860 in Herrick Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania where he spent most of his early years. The sources of his architectural training have not been determined, but he had established a practice by 1890 advertising in an Athens, Pennsylvania newspaper as an architect, contractor and builder. However by 1898, Wilbur Camp reportedly moved to Geneva, New York where he remained until relocating to Jacksonville in October or November of 1901. Career Camp appeared to have a successful practice in Athens with many of his residential designs being featured in the American Homes magazine where he also advertised his business. In some of his ads, Wilbur Camp promoted his plan book available for purchase, which had twenty different plans for houses costing $600 to $10,000. One of his noted designs before coming to Jacksonville was the First Methodist Episcopal Church in Towanda, Pennsylvania, constructed in 1895. Continuing his business practice of selling stock plans, one of his contemporaries in Jacksonville criticized Camp for “coming to town like a patent medicine man, with a suitcase full of plans for sale”. This description was also reflected in a short ad placed by Camp in the 1902 city directory in which he stated, “I have over 600 sets of plans on file of nearly all classes of buildings that I shall be pleased to show anyone that is contemplating to build.” Camp went on to state that he had spent the last five months working with Jacksonville architect Henry John Klutho, in the design of the City Hall, the Dyal-Upchurch Building, the T.V. Porter residence, and the Congregational Church. Initially opening an office with John K. Bliven in 1902, Camp went on to design several landmark structures during his two decades in Jacksonville. Camp is also recognized as one of the first architects in Jacksonville outside of Henry John Klutho that was utilizing the avant-garde Prairie School style architecture for residential design. Two noted Prairie Style residential designs by Camp include the Thurston Roberts Residence at 1804 Elizabeth Place (c. 1913),Thurston Roberts Residence Jacksonville, Florida and the R.H. McMillan residence at 2317 Oak Street (1913).2317 Oak Street Jacksonville, Florida The source of his Prairie Style influence is not known, but may have resulted from national publications featuring the style or was exposed to it while working with Klutho. In addition to the Old Duval High School (1907-1908),Old Duval High School Jacksonville, FloridaDesignation Application for Old Duval High School at 605 North Ocean Street other more revival style buildings designed by Camp include the 1905 -06 addition to the Florida National Bank Building, Fire Station # 2 (1909),Fire Station #2 Jacksonville, Florida and the Springfield Methodist Church. He also designed the Jones Brothers Furniture Store (1913, demolished) which was a six story reinforced concrete building reflecting the Chicago Style of high rise architecture.Lost Treasures Jacksonville, Florida Jones Brothers Furniture Co. Building Jacksonville, Florida Residing in Springfield, Camp designed his own residence at 1824 North Pearl Street. During his time in Jacksonville from the fall of 1901 to his death in 1918, Camp designed a variety of houses, apartments, stores, warehouses, and schools in different parts of Florida and Georgia, as well as in other states. Some of these designs include the Bradford County Courthouse in Tawonda, Pennsylvania, St. Lucie High School in Fort Pierce, Florida,St Lucie High School St. Lucie, Florida Methodist Episcopal Churches in Millen and Bainbridge, Georgia, and schools in St. Mary's, Thomasville, and Waycross, Georgia. Although maintaining his residence and practice in Jacksonville, Wilbur B. Camp opened an office in Charlestown, West Virginia during the early part of 1918. At the time he was designing the five-story St. Albans Hotel and First National Bank in Charleston. While in West Virginia, Wilbur B. Camp died at the age of 57 on March 24, 1918, and was interned in Woodlawn Cemetery (Evergreen Cemetery) in Jacksonville.

He was awarded Junior and Senior Scholarships in Law, the AG Davis Scholarship and the Sir Alexander Johnston Scholarship. Chambers became a clerk to Judges of the Supreme Court (now High Court) before attending Oxford University having been awarded Commonwealth and New Zealand Law Society Scholarships. At Oxford he was Salvesen Fellow at New College, gained High Honours and was awarded his DPhil in 1978. Chambers returned to New Zealand and lectured in law at the University of Auckland and worked as a lawyer for the firm Wilson Henry Martin & Co. He commenced practice as a barrister sole in 1981 and was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1992 — one of the few to be appointed under the age of 40.\\"Queen's Counsel Regulations 1987\\" (20 August 1992) 130 New Zealand Gazette 2838. He was a founding member of the Arbitrators’ Institute of New Zealand in 1987, a member of the Law Commission’s Evidence Sub-Committee and a member of the Council of the Legal Research Foundation. He was a Council member of the Auckland District Law Society from 1992 to 1998, its Vice-President from 1995 to 1997 and President from 1997 to 1998.

Chambers created and contributed to guidelines and systems still applicable in the New Zealand courts today, such as flow charts for juries, the New Zealand system for assessing party and party costs (created with Fisher J), the Evidence Act and the New Zealand Law Style Guide. On 21 May 2013, Chambers unexpectedly died in his sleep in Wellington. Subsequently, the Governor-General Sir Jerry Mateparae announced that Chambers was to have been appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2013 Queen's Birthday Honours and that, as royal assent had been given to the appointment before Chambers' death, his knighthood took effect from 20 May 2013. His funeral was held at the Auckland Town Hall — the first since the passing of former New Zealand Prime Minister Sir Robert Muldoon.

At the end of the battle, FSA fighters successfully seized the checkpoint. Events Rebels gather during the battle At dusk on 29 July, First Lieutenant Rifaat Khali, commander of the Conquest Brigade in the area, mobilized 150 fighters to seize control of the Anadan checkpoint, a strategic location linking the city of Aleppo to the south with the Turkish border to the north, which the FSA used as a source for supplies. The battle took place concurrently with the first night and day of the Battle of Aleppo itself. FSA fighters surrounded the checkpoint as night fell and began an assault against the garrisoned troops and besieged them. A force of 50 fighters out of an initial 150 fighters took part at first, using RPGs, machine guns, and assault rifles. The besieged government soldiers called in artillery strikes from batteries based in Aleppo city, which pounded areas surrounding the checkpoint, striking nearby villages where FSA fighters were located, in a last-ditch effort to force the FSA to disengage, but failed to do so. Three hours after the attack began, a loyalist helicopter arrived and circled the area, but had little effect on the battle. The lack of reinforcements for the government soldiers during the whole ten hours led to speculation that the Syrian army was under significant military pressure in other areas of Aleppo. An FSA operated BMP-1 armoured personnel carrier supported the fighters, as they assaulted the base, firing at least 70 rounds into the checkpoint. After ten hours of fighting, some of the government soldiers were able to break out and flee. At least six of them were killed and 25 others captured. The FSA lost four fighters, and an unknown number were wounded. Aftermath After seizing the checkpoint, FSA fighters retrieved ammunition left behind by the defeated government forces. During the fighting, eight tanks were also captured, between four and seven of which were still operational; the operational ones were intended for use in the Battle of Aleppo. At least some of the captured tanks were deployed northwards to Azaz, where they were used to support an attack on a loyalist-held airbase. The rebels, however, pulled back from their attack on the airbase within a day after failing to capture it.

History  The museum, which opened in Devlin Hall in 1993, was officially named The Charles S. and Isabella V. McMullen Museum of Art in 1996 in honor of the parents of the Boston College benefactor, trustee and art collector John J. McMullen. In September 2016, the museum relocated to 2101 Commonwealth Avenue on Boston College's Brighton Campus. The new facility features nearly two times the exhibition space of its previous location in Devlin Hall, state-of-the art lighting, movable walls, humidity and climate control, and extensive storage for the museum's growing permanent collection. Despite being a university art museum residing on a college campus, the McMullen Museum of Art organizes multidisciplinary exhibitions that have received national and international recognition. Stephen Kinzer of the New York Times has written that it is in the vanguard of museums creating exhibitions that \\"reach far beyond traditional art history\\", providing political, historical, and cultural context for works on view. The Museum holds an extensive permanent collection that spans the history of art from Europe, Asia and the Americas, and has significant representation of Gothic and Baroque tapestries, Italian paintings of the 16th and 17th centuries, and American paintings of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Well-known artists represented in the museum include Amedeo Modigliani, Frank Stella, Françoise Gilot, Alexander Ney, and John La Farge.  Exhibitions  The Taking of Christ (1602) from the collections of the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin, was a major draw at the McMullen Museum's 1999 exhibition \\"Saints and Sinners\\". The McMullen Museum has hosted more than sixty exhibitions over two decades. They have been curated by both internal teams of scholars from the Boston College and international specialists. Being a university museum, the focus of the exhibitions is the generation of new knowledge in all disciplinary fields of art history. Recent significant exhibitions include: * \\"Beyond Words: Illuminated Manuscripts in Boston Collections\\" (2016); * \\"Paul Klee: Philosophical Vision; From Nature to Art\\", with which the McMullen Museum of Art reopen for its fall 2012 season; * \\"Pollock Matters\\" (2007) received much media attention, comprising over 150 paintings, drawings, photographs, and sculptures, exploring the personal and artistic relationship between famed American Abstract Expressionist painter Jackson Pollock and noted Swiss-born photographer and graphic designer Herbert Matter; * A retrospective of the work of Surrealist Roberto Matta (2004), organized by university faculty from the romance languages, art history, and theology departments, was also well received; * \\"Edvard Munch: Psyche, Symbol, and Expression\\" (2001) was the largest American exhibition of Munch's work since 1978; * \\"Saints and Sinners\\" (1999), featuring Caravaggio's The Taking of the Christ, which reportedly attracted the largest audience for any university museum exhibition up to that time. =Portugal, Jesuits, and Japan= \\"Portugal, Jesuits, and Japan: Spiritual Beliefs and Earthly Goods\\" opened in the McMullen Museum on February 16, 2013. It was curated by Victoria Weston and Alexandra Curvelo, and was underwritten by Boston College, the Patrons of the McMullen Museum, Leslie and Peter Ciampi, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Portugal, the Consulate General of Portugal in Boston, and the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation. The exhibit focuses on nearly a century of interaction, beginning in 1543, between the Japanese people and the Portuguese, namely traders and Jesuit missionaries. Tracing shifts in the dichotomy of this relationship through the exchange of earthly goods and beliefs, Portugal, Jesuits, And Japan paints a winsome, complex, and devastating portrait of a provincial fascination. = Cao Jun: Hymns to Nature = The exhibition \\"Cao Jun: Hymns to Nature\\" opened on February 5, 2018 in the Daley Family and Monan Galleries and was curated by the American philosopher John Sallis. It is the first exhibition of the Chinese artist in the United States. He previously traveled throughout Europe, New Zealand and the polar regions, where he drew inspiration from natural landscapes to create his calligraphic paintings. The exhibition examines Cao Jun's innovative way to depict nature between ancient Chinese sensibility and techniques and Western abstraction forms. Exhibits included both his early works depicting animals and later works of calligraphy, porcelain and paintings, where he employed the techniques of ink- and color-splashing to render mountain landscapes, water and flowers. The exhibition concluded with more recent abstract works exploring the various configurations in which spatial phenomena can appear. Being curated by a philosopher, the investigation of the philosophical and poetic dimensions of Cao Jun's work was also central in the conception of the exhibition.

Cao Mao, the nominal emperor of Wei, attempted to launch a coup to oust the regent Sima Zhao, who effectively controlled the Wei government. However, the coup concluded with Cao Mao's death and Sima Zhao retaining his status. Contrary to its intention, the coup actually increased the Sima clan's power and influence in Wei, thus providing a foundation for the eventual usurpation of the Wei throne in 266 by Sima Zhao's son Sima Yan, who founded the Western Jin Dynasty. The coup is also mentioned in the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong, which dramatises the history of the late Eastern Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period. The events of the coup described in the novel are largely similar to that described in historical sources. Background The state of Cao Wei was established in 220 by Cao Pi, which marked the start of the Three Kingdoms period in China. The authority of the Wei imperial family had been weakening since the death of the second Wei emperor, Cao Rui, and reached a nadir after the Incident at Gaoping Tombs in 249, when the Wei general Sima Yi seized power from the regent Cao Shuang. Sima Yi died in 251 and was succeeded by his sons Sima Shi and Sima Zhao, who effectively controlled the Wei government. In 254, Sima Shi deposed the third Wei ruler Cao Fang and installed a 13-year-old Cao Mao on the throne. From the start of his reign, Cao Mao acted in defiance of the Simas, refusing to accept the imperial seal directly from Sima Shi, and, after Sima Shi's death in 255, he attempted to order Sima Zhao to remain in Xuchang to keep watch over Shouchun (present-day Shou County, Anhui), where a rebellion led by Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin had just been suppressed. However, Sima Zhao ignored Cao Mao's edict and returned to the capital Luoyang. While Sima Zhao administered state affairs, Cao Mao attempted to gain the favour of the literati in the court through unremarkable meetings to discuss literature with some officials—Sima Zhao's cousin Sima Wang, Wang Shen (王沈), Pei Xiu, and Zhong Hui. Cao Mao also provided Sima Wang with a chariot and five imperial guardsmen as escorts because the latter lived further away from the palace than the others. In 258, Sima Zhao was offered and declined title as Duke of Jin and the nine bestowments over nine times. Discussion and debate over the matter allowed him to judge his level of support. In 259 a year later, Cao Mao received sightings of yellow dragons in two wells, and he wrote a poem identifying the dragons as being trapped inside wells and likened himself to the dragons. Sima Zhao saw the poem and was angry. In 260 Sima Zhao was again offered title as Duke of Jin and the nine bestowments and did not immediately decline. The coup On 2 June 260, a 19-year-old Cao Mao gathered his associates Wang Shen, Wang Jing and Wang Ye declaring his intention to make a last-ditch attempt to overthrow Sima Zhao, even at the cost of his life. Wang Jing advised the emperor against such action, but Cao Mao ignored Wang Jing's advice and informed Empress Dowager Guo of his plan. In his absence, Wang Shen and Wang Ye secretly deserted Cao Mao and notified Sima Zhao about the plot. Cao Mao then led his forces from the palace, personally wielding sword. Sima Zhao's younger brother Sima Zhou attempted to put up resistance at one of the gates, but was defeated and fled. Sima Zhao's aide Jia Chong led another defense at the South Watchtower. When Cheng Ji (成濟), a military officer under Jia Chong, asked Jia what to do, Jia told him to defend the Sima clan regardless of the consequences. Cheng Ji then approached Cao Mao and killed the emperor with his spear. Aftermath After Cao Mao's death, the public called for Jia Chong's execution on the grounds that he had committed regicide. Sima Zhao forced Empress Dowager Guo to posthumously demote Cao Mao to the status of a commoner, and then ordered Wang Jing and his clan to be executed. The following day, after pleas from his uncle Sima Fu, Sima Zhao asked Empress Dowager Guo to posthumously instate Cao Mao as the \\"Duke of Gaogui\\" (高貴鄉公) and bury Cao Mao with the ceremonies befitting that of a prince, though this was not actually done. Cao Huang (later renamed to Cao Huan), the Duke of Changdao (常道鄉公), was chosen to succeed Cao Mao and was installed on the throne. 19 days later, Sima Zhao had Cheng Ji and his family executed to appease public anger but Jia Chong was spared. Sima Zhao successfully retained his power during the coup and eliminated his opponents in the Wei court, leaving only the young Cao Huan as a puppet emperor under his control. He did not take the Wei throne, even until his death, but was granted the title of a vassal king—\\"King of Jin\\" (晉王)—and the nine bestowments by Cao Huan in 264. Sima Zhao died in September 265 and was succeeded by his son Sima Yan, who forced Cao Huan to abdicate in his favour in February 266 and established the Western Jin Dynasty. In popular culture In the seventh instalment of Koei's Dynasty Warriors video game series, a stage is dedicated to the initial coup d'état against Sima Zhao, where it is called \\"Wei's Emperor's Last Stand\\"; the other two are mentioned in the narration.

Early life Franciotti was born in 1592 in Lucca, Tuscany, the son of Curzio Franciotti. He was educated at the University of Bologna where he studied law. Thereafter, he went to Rome and became a papal prelate and was employed by Giambattista Spada. He was appointed Protonotary apostolic participantium in 1619. In 1622, Franciotti was made Governor of Faenza and then Fabriano and general auditor of the Apostolic Chamber the following year. He was promoted to cleric of the Apostolic Chamber in 1626 and was named Prefect of the Annona in 1627 (a honorific title maintained by the church in the same vein as that of Praefectus annonae in Ancient Rome). He was promoted again to Auditor General of the Apostolic Chamber and held the position for 8 years; between 1629 and 1637. Cardinalate Franciotti was actually elevated to cardinal by Pope Urban VIII in November 1633 but the elevation was reserved in pectore tacite and was only published in the consistory of 30 March 1637 when Franciotti was appointed Bishop of Lucca; his home city. Franciotti was consecrated a month later, on 19 April 1637 at the Quirinale Palace by Antonio Marcello Barberini, Cardinal-Priest of Sant'Onofrio, with Faustus Poli, Titular Archbishop of Amasea, and Antonio Severoli, Archbishop of Dubrovnik, serving as co- consecrators. Conflict in Lucca Contemporary, John Bargrave, provided further insight into Franciotti's activities as Cardinal-Bishop of Lucca and those of his brother, one of the governors of Lucca.Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals by John Bargrave, edited by James Craigie Robertson (reprint; 2009) According to Bargrave, Franciotti's brother had taken up arms against the other princes of Lucca; being armed inside city walls was expressly forbidden by city law. City officials searched the houses of those suspected of being involved and found large numbers of weapons and were, at the same time, made aware of plots against the city government led by Franciotti's brother. Franciotti's brother and a number of others were arrested and prosecuted. With his brother sentenced to death, Franciotti rushed to Rome and sought an audience with Pope Urban. Rather than give a proper account of the events leading to his brother's arrest, Franciotti told the Pope that city officials had taken issue with his conduct as Bishop and that the armed men had been employed for the protection of his own episcopal residence. Pope Urban believed his Cardinal and sent letters to Lucca demanding that Franciotti's brother be released. The city refused and the Pope excommunicated those he believed responsible for the slight and ordered that all the churches in the city be closed. City officials wrote numerous letters to church and secular officials alike but were not given permission to reopen their churches until they had come to a resolution with Cardinal Franciotti. It is unclear if Franciotti's brother was ever executed but Franciotti resigned as Bishop of Lucca in 1645. Later life and death Franciotti participated in the conclave of 1644 which elected Pope Innocent X. He was appointed Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals between 1650 and 1651 and participated in the conclave of 1655 which elected Pope Alexander VII.

It was a hit single that reached the Top 10 in several countries worldwide. The song's basic track, including \\"la-la\\" vocals, was recorded in early March 1970 in New York City. Later that month, producer Bob Johnston had brass instrument overdubs added to the track; these were recorded in Nashville, Tennessee at a session without Dylan present. Critical appraisal of \\"Wigwam\\" has been mostly positive, and reviewers have called it a highlight of Self Portrait. Several artists have covered the composition, including Drafi Deutscher, whose version of it was a Top 20 hit in Germany. Recording \\"Wigwam\\" was recorded during the sessions for Dylan's Self Portrait album, and produced by Bob Johnston. The basic track was put on tape on March 4, 1970, at Columbia Studio A in New York City, and was labelled \\"New Song 1\\" on the recording sheet. The musicians on the basic track were Dylan, vocals and guitar; David Bromberg, guitar; Al Kooper, piano. On April 20, 2013, this early version of \\"Wigwam\\" was released as a single for Record Store Day, and on August 27 of the same year, it appeared on The Bootleg Series Vol. 10 – Another Self Portrait (1969–1971). On March 17, 1970, at Columbia Recording Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, instrumental overdubs were recorded for \\"Wigwam\\" and several other songs. Dylan was not present for the overdubs, and they were overseen by Johnston. In the song, Dylan sings \\"la-la\\" vocals, accompanied by horns, in an arrangement that has been called \\"mariachi-like\\", and \\"Tex-Mex\\". The feeling of the song has also been described as \\"campfire music\\" and as having a \\"hazy glow\\". Release \\"Wigwam\\" was released on Self Portrait on June 8, 1970, and as a single in June or July. The single's B-side is \\"Copper Kettle\\". The single was a Top 10 hit in Belgium, Denmark (in 1972), France, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, and Switzerland, and was a Top 40 hit in Canada and Germany. In the US, the song reached No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100, and No. 13 on the Billboard Top 40 Easy Listening chart. Years later, in the early 2000s, \\"Wigwam\\" appeared on the \\"Limited Tour Edition\\" of The Essential Bob Dylan. The song was also included on the soundtrack to the film The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), as well as on the compilations One Hit Wonders and Hard to Find Classics (2003), Radio 2 - De Topcollectie '70 Vol. 2 (2010), Top 40 Hitarchief - 1970 (2011), and Remember the 70s Vol. 5. Appraisal Reactions to the song have been generally positive. A review in Billboard magazine describes the track as \\"winning\\". Biographer Rober Shelton includes \\"Wigwam\\" among the \\"quality\\" songs on Self Portrait, describing it as \\"hard to forget\\"; it is also one of the \\"AllMusic Picks\\" of the highlights of Self Portrait, and Michael Gray similarly rates it as one of the \\"best tracks\\" on the album. Greil Marcus is likewise positive about the track, calling it \\"a great job of arranging\\". PopMatters reviewer Tom Useted calls the song \\"more than worthy\\", while NME writer Paul Stokes qualifies it as \\"melodious\\" and as demonstrating Dylan's \\"versatility and impact\\". In a review of The Royal Tenenbaums soundtrack, critic Heather Phares writes that the \\"hazy glow\\" of the song \\"add[s] to the album's strangely timeless but emotionally direct atmosphere.\\" Critic Sean Egan writes that \\"Dylan la-las against a big brass arrangement in a not disagreeable way—but is 'not disagreeable' supposed to be what a Dylan track amounts to?\\" On a more negative note, writer Seth Rogovoy describes \\"Wigwam\\" as a \\"bizarre, wordless vocal tune\\". Critic Anthony Varesi considers the instrumentation on \\"Wigwam\\" to be an example of \\"horns misplaced\\", and \\"evidence of flaws\\" in Bob Johnston's production choices on Self Portrait. Pitchfork writer Rob Mitchum characterizes the song as \\"moaning along with the brass section\\" and \\"rather unpleasant\\". Covers Artists who have covered \\"Wigwam\\" include the New Christy Minstrels, Sounds Orchestral, and the French orchestra leaders Raymond Lefèvre and Caravelli. Drafi Deutscher released a version with German lyrics, entitled \\"Weil ich dich liebe\\" (\\"Because I Love You\\"), that was a Top 20 hit in Germany in 1970.
