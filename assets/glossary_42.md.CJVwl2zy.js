She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Brooklyn College, a Bachelor of Hebrew Literature from the Jewish Theological Seminary, and a master's degree in art history from the Institute of Fine Arts. She edited The First Ms. Reader (1973) and Free to Be ... You and Me (1974). Some of her books are Too Young to Die‚ÄîYouth and Suicide (1976), Married People: Staying Together in the Age of Divorce (1985), and Jewish Days: A Book of Jewish Life and Culture Around the Year (1996). There was a special commission appointed by the chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America to study the issue of ordaining women as rabbis, which met between 1977 and 1978, and consisted of 11 men and three women; the women were Francine Klagsbrun, Marian Siner Gordon, an attorney, and Rivkah Harris, an Assyriologist. After years of discussion, the JTS faculty voted to ordain women as rabbis and as cantors in 1983. In 1988, at the First International Jewish Feminist Conference in Jerusalem, a group of women organized a prayer service at the Western Wall and selected Klagsbrun to carry the Torah at the head of the group, making her the first woman to carry a Torah to the Western Wall. In 1989 she helped dedicate a Torah to the Women of the Wall. She has served as chairwoman of the Board of Overseers of the Jewish Theological Seminary Library and secretary of the board of trustees of the Jewish Museum and cochair of its exhibitions committee, as well as a member of the Publication Committee of the Jewish Publication Society of America, the Professional Advisory Board of the Petschek National Jewish Family Center of the American Jewish Committee, and the Artistic Advisory Committee of the National Foundation for Jewish Culture.

Between the early 1960s and late 1990s, LA 3052 was used as a temporary designation for the relocation of US 167 from Opelousas to Lafayette and US 90 from Lafayette to Raceland. In its final incarnation, LA 3052 began at an interchange with LA 311 at what is now Exit 200 on US 90. It proceeded east through an interchange with LA 24 in Gray and crossed from Terrebonne Parish into Lafourche Parish at an interchange with LA 316. LA 3052 ended at an interchange with US 90 and LA 3198 (now LA 182) south of Raceland. It was a four-lane controlled-access highway for its entire length. In the early 1960s, construction began on the first project that would eventually relocate US 90 and US 167 onto a new four- lane alignment between Opelousas and Raceland. The new route was built as LA 3052 and became part of US 90 and US 167 as various sections were completed. At the same time, LA 182 was extended to cover the old alignment. The first section between Opelousas and Sunset opened about 1962. Once the highway was extended to Lafayette three years later, it became part of US 167, now upgraded to a freeway as part of I-49. At the same time, the section from Lafayette to Broussard was opened and soon became part of US 90. Between the late 1960s and early 1980s, the relocation of US 90 was extended in stages from Broussard to Morgan City. In 1978, the Raceland bypass was completed. Its extension west to Gray around 1983 remained as LA 3052 for over twenty years until the final section east from Morgan City was opened about 1997. Louisiana Highway 3054 Louisiana Highway 3055 Louisiana Highway 3056 Louisiana Highway 3057 Louisiana Highway 3057 (LA 3057) ran in a general southeast to northwest direction along Commerce Street in a loop off of US 61 in St. Francisville. The route was deleted in 2018 as part of the La DOTD's Road Transfer program. Louisiana Highway 3059 Louisiana Highway 3060 Louisiana Highway 3060 (LA 3060) runs in a north-south direction along Barton Avenue from US 90 to LA 18 (River Road) in Luling, St. Charles Parish. The route serves as a connector between its termini, crossing several railroad tracks at grade and passing through a residential neighborhood. The posted speed limit is . It is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. Louisiana Highway 3061 Louisiana Highway 3062 Louisiana Highway 3063 Louisiana Highway 3064 Louisiana Highway 3064 (LA 3064) runs in a north-south direction along Essen Lane from LA 427 (Perkins Road) to LA 73 (Jefferson Highway) in Baton Rouge, East Baton Rouge Parish. Louisiana Highway 3066 Louisiana Highway 3067 Louisiana Highway 3068 Louisiana Highway 3069 Louisiana Highway 3070 Louisiana Highway 3071 Louisiana Highway 3072 Louisiana Highway 3073 Louisiana Highway 3073 (LA 3073) runs in a northwest to southeast direction along Ambassador Caffery Parkway from US 167 in Lafayette to US 90 in Broussard, Lafayette Parish. State maintenance continues a short distance east of US 90 onto Corne Road to the entrance to Zoosiana (the Zoo of Acadiana). The route is a western bypass of Lafayette that also serves as a primary commercial corridor for the growing suburbs southwest of the city. Along the way, LA 3073 crosses the Vermilion River and passes the Mall of Acadiana. The eastern portion of the route connecting with US 90 in Broussard was an extension opened in 2010. On the opposite end, Ambassador Caffery Parkway continues beyond US 167 as a local road. It then becomes part of LA 3184, connecting with US 90 and I-10 west of downtown Lafayette and terminating at LA 725 (Renaud Drive). Louisiana Highway 3074 Louisiana Highway 3075 Louisiana Highway 3075 (LA 3075) is the designation for the state-maintained approaches to the defunct White Castle Ferry across the Mississippi River in Iberville Parish. The service connected LA 405 east of White Castle with LA 141 in an area within the St. Gabriel city limits known as Carville. LA 405 and LA 141 travel alongside the west and east bank levees of the river, respectively. Louisiana Highway 3076 The route was deleted in 2018 as part of the La DOTD Road Transfer program. Louisiana Highway 3078 Louisiana Highway 3079 Louisiana Highway 3079 (LA 3079) runs in an east-west direction from LA 593 to LA 138 north of Collinston, Morehouse Parish. The short connector is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. Louisiana Highway 3081 Louisiana Highway 3082 Louisiana Highway 3083 Louisiana Highway 3086 Louisiana Highway 3087 Louisiana Highway 3087 (LA 3087) runs in a north-south direction from LA 24 in Houma, Terrebonne Parish to LA 182 in Savoie, Lafourche Parish. From the south, LA 3087 begins at an intersection with LA 24 at the northern limit of Houma. It heads north as an undivided four-lane highway and immediately crosses a vertical lift bridge over Bayou Terrebonne, intersecting LA 659 on the opposite bank. LA 3087 continues north along Prospect Boulevard, becoming a divided four-lane highway, and crosses a high-level fixed span bridge over the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. Shortly after an intersection with LA 660, the highway crosses from Terrebonne Parish into Lafourche Parish at LA 316. LA 3087 then turns northwest and reaches its northern terminus at LA 182 in an area known as Savoie. Louisiana Highway 3089 Louisiana Highway 3089 (LA 3089) runs in an east-west direction from the junction of LA 1 and LA 18 in Donaldsonville, Ascension Parish to LA 70 east of town. The route connects Donaldsonville with the Sunshine Bridge across the Mississippi River on LA 70. From the west, LA 3089 heads east on Albert Street from LA 1 and LA 18 as an undivided two-lane highway with a center turning lane. The route immediately crosses a bridge over Bayou Lafourche and intersects LA 308 on the opposite bank. After curving onto Marchand Drive, LA 3089 intersects LA 945 (St. Patrick Street). Continuing east along the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) tracks, the surroundings abruptly become rural, and the highway widens to a divided four-lane highway. Just after leaving the city limits, LA 3089 ends at a sprawling interchange with LA 70 where all movements are made at grade. LA 70 continues into St. James Parish and across the Sunshine Bridge. LA 3089 was originally the designation for the Sunshine Bridge and its approaches upon its opening to traffic in 1964. At this time, traffic heading east out of Donaldsonville reached the bridge by following LA 18 along the east bank levee of the Mississippi River, turning southeast onto what is now LA 3120, then east onto the present LA 70 across the bridge. Upon reaching the east bank, traffic exited immediately onto ramps leading to LA 44, the east bank River Road. Traffic bound for Sorrento would turn northeast onto a portion of LA 942 that is no longer part of the state highway system and continue straight ahead onto LA 22. The east bank approach was extended directly to LA 22 near Sorrento around 1969. By 1975, the west bank approach was re-routed and extended into the center of Donaldsonville. During the late 1970s, LA 70 was extended northeast to LA 3089 from its original terminus at LA 1 in Paincourtville. The LA 70 designation was then extended across the Sunshine Bridge to LA 22, shortening LA 3089 to its present length. Louisiana Highway 3090 Louisiana Highway 3090 (LA 3090) runs in a north-south direction along A. O. Rappelet Road from Port Fourchon, Lafourche Parish to a junction with LA 1. The route, located on the Gulf of Mexico, is vital to the area's oil/gas and seafood industries. The northern terminus is located opposite the south end of the Gateway to the Gulf Expressway on LA 1, the only link to the rest of the state highway system. LA 3090 is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. Louisiana Highway 3091 Louisiana Highway 3091 (LA 3091) runs in a general north-south direction from LA 620 to LA 413 north of Erwinville, West Baton Rouge Parish. The highway heads north from LA 620 then turns west, skirting the Pointe Coupee Parish line, to its terminus at LA 413. Louisiana Highway 3092 Louisiana Highway 3093 Louisiana Highway 3094 Louisiana Highway 3096 Louisiana Highway 3097 Louisiana Highway 3098 Louisiana Highway 3098 (LA 3098) runs in a southeast to northwest direction from US 165 in Georgetown, Grant Parish to LA 1230 on the Winn Parish line. The route initially heads north on a bypassed former alignment of US 165 through a forested area within the village of Georgetown. After , the highway intersects LA 1230. Less than later, LA 3098 turns off to the northwest and passes near an area known as Rochelle. It proceeds to a second junction with LA 1230 on the Grant-Winn parish line.

Frankie Pierce (c. 1864‚Äì1954), was an American educator and suffragist.The African-American history of Nashville, Tennessee, 1780-1930: elites and dilemmas, by Bobby L. Lovett, University of Arkansas Press, 1999, page 232 Pierce opened the Tennessee Vocational School for Colored Girls in 1923, and she served as its superintendent until 1939. The school continued to operate until 1979. The daughter of a slave, Pierce addressed white women at the inaugural convention of the Tennessee League of Women Voters, held in the Tennessee Capitol in May 1920.  Early life and education  Born Juno Frankie Seay in Nashville about 1864, her father was Frank Seay, a freedman, and her mother, Nellie Seay, was a house slave to Colonel Robert Allen, a member of the US House of Representatives from Smith County. Frankie Pierce attended John G. McKee Freedmen's School, established as a Presbyterian mission and located in Nashville Tennessee. She continued her education at Roger Williams University in Nashville. She taught at Bellview School, a public school for black children. She married Clement J. Pierce and moved with him to Paris, Texas. After his death, she returned to Nashville to live with her mother, Nellie Seay. With her mother, she was active in the First Colored Baptist Church, Capitol Hill.  Tennessee Vocational School for Colored Girls  In Nashville, black women organized church related and secular clubs in order to pursue their social justice goals, such as better schools, child care, and settlement houses. Frankie Pierce was a founder of the Negro Women‚Äôs Reconstruction League, which she served as president. She was a founder of the Nashville Federation of Colored Women‚Äôs Clubs and also served on the first Management Committee of the Blue Triangle League of the YWCA. Members of these clubs led by Frankie Pierce marched to the mayor‚Äôs office to demand public restrooms for black women in downtown Nashville. As a result, Montgomery Ward installed restrooms for black women in its store. One of Frankie Pierce‚Äôs goals was to establish a state-supported vocational school for delinquent black children. Because black children could not attend white schools, the only alternative was to take them to prison. Pierce worked with the clubs to lobby for the legislation to establish the school. After the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, giving women the right to vote throughout the nation, the Tennessee General Assembly passed a bill creating the Tennessee Vocational School for Colored Girls on April 7, 1921. The school opened at 2700 Heiman Street in Nashville on October 8, 1923. The school provided academic and vocational training to girls aged 12‚Äì15, through the ninth grade. Frankie Pierce served as its superintendent, a position she held until 1939. She implemented a program of personal development that emphasized health, recreation, physical needs, moral training, and religion. The school served 35 students from across Tennessee in its opening years but grew after that. The school was supported by the City Federation of Colored Women's Clubs, for which Pierce served as an organizer. Dr. Mattie E. Coleman followed Pierce as superintendent and served until her death in 1942.  Suffrage  Frankie Pierce and Mattie E. Coleman, an African American physician and leading feminist in the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church, were among Tennessee's most active black suffragists. They helped to get 2,500 black women to vote in the 1919 Nashville municipal elections, the city's first election in which black women were eligible to vote. By 1919, as people in Tennessee worked for or against becoming the 36th state to ratify the 19th Amendment, giving women the right to vote, the suffrage movement was mostly segregated, especially in the Jim Crow South. But the black women's clubs worked with white women‚Äôs clubs on various social issues, and these connections fostered an alliance in Nashville on suffrage. The black women‚Äôs clubs had worked with the white suffrage organizations to get out the vote in the 1919 municipal elections. Catherine Kenny, Chair of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage League, was impressed with Frankie Pierce‚Äôs organizational skills and invited her to address the first convention of the Tennessee League of Women Voters, held in the Tennessee Capitol in May 1920. This address of a black woman to several hundred white women in the Tennessee Capitol is called by Elaine Weiss \\"a taboo-breaking experiment in political cooperation\\". In her address, Frankie Pierce asked, \\"What will the Negro woman do with the vote?...Yes, we will stand by the white women. We are optimistic because we have faith in the best white women of the country, of Nashville. We are going to make you proud of us, because we are going to help you help us and yourselves.\\" She continued, \\"We are interested in the same moral uplift of the community in which we live as you are... We are asking only one thing‚Äîa square deal.\\" The platform she offered these white women was a state vocational school, a child welfare department of the state, and more room in state schools.‚Äù The League adopted the school as part of its legislative agenda and lobbied extensively for it. Anita Goodstein calls the black women‚Äôs offer of cooperation with white suffragists in return for specific benefits a ‚Äúrare alliance‚Äù and observes that it happened only in Nashville. She credits Frankie Pierce, Mattie E. Coleman, and Catherine Kenny for their boldness. Pierce's niece, Nellie Griswold Francis, was also a prominent suffragist, as well as an anti-lynching and civil rights activist.  Legacy  The Frankie J. Pierce lecture series was organized by Tennessee women including State Senator Thelma Harper and Representative Lettie Galloway to celebrate African American women's history. On August 26, 2016, as part of Women's Equality Day, a monument by Alan LeQuire was unveiled in Centennial Park in Nashville, featuring depictions of Pierce, Carrie Chapman Catt, Anne Dallas Dudley, Abby Crawford Milton, and Sue Shelton White.

Description  Cava del Rivettazzo consists of around a hundred rock-cut tombs dating to the Bronze Age, carved into a cliff face. When it was discovered at the beginning of the 20th century by Paolo Orsi, it was the only site with evidence of habitation in all three sub-periods of the Sicilian Bronze Age and it was thus a key site in the reconstruction of Sicilian prehistory. In fact, based on the different shapes of the burial chambers and the discovery of flint knives, white limestone beads, and Pantalican ware inside them Orsi concluded that the necropolis represented a stage of transition from the first to the second period, which he called \\"Siculi\\". However, the grave goods in tomb 10 belonged to the third period. Thus he was able to conclude that Rivettazzo was inhabited by a small group of people, was visited for several centuries before the second millennium BC, and that a permanent community was established somewhere in the vicinity in the following period. According to Orsi, the settlement consisted of two groups, not far from one another, one beyond the peak of the Cozzo Bernardo hill, which looms over the necropolis and the other on the opposite bank near the Cozzo Carrubbedda. Thanks to the Anapo River which flowed through the Cava and not only provided an ample water supply, but also enabled trade with other groups of people settled along the east coast of Sicily (Ortygia) and further upstream (Pantalica), these two settlements continued to be inhabited for a long time - through to the Byzantine period. The destruction of the site seems to date largely to this time. Only a prolonged period of habitation explains the different ways that individual tombs were developed, the variety of different types of tomb from different periods, and the presence of artefacts in tombs which appear much older than them - as was also seen in the excavations of Cozzo Collura. Near the Cava del Rivettazzo is the more extensive necropolis of Calancon del vento or Cava del Parroco, which is of the same date as Rivettazzo and was also abandoned in the Byzantine period. Its settlement was probably at Cugno Cardone. Strangely, this latter site was never studied by Orsi.

An initial release to the general public began on July 5, 2017, with the official launch on July 17. The program is managed by TriMet. The Hop card is a purple credit card-sized stored-value contactless smartcard that can hold a cash value or day or monthly passes for various systems. Because all terminals that read Hop cards can also accept NFC-based mobile payment, \\"virtual\\" Hop cards are available for use on any iOS or Android smartphone supporting Apple Pay or Google Pay respectively; these are functionally identical to physical cards. Day or month passes allowing unlimited rides within the given time frame can be \\"earned\\" by purchasing an amount in single fares equal to the cost of the pass; a year pass, which costs as much as 11 earned month passes, can also be purchased up-front. Passengers must tap on each time they enter the system by holding the card to an electronic reader to validate a pass or deduct funds. Cards can be reloaded using a credit or debit card online, using a mobile app, calling a toll-free number, or at local retailers and ticket offices. Cash can be used when reloading the card in person. Background A Hop card reader inside a TriMet bus Prior to the introduction of electronic payments on the network, paper tickets and passes were used by Portland-area transit agencies. The tickets needed to be validated at ticket validators on the Streetcar or at MAX and WES stations. They did not offer fare exchange or extension. Installation of Hop readers began in March 2015, and was completed by the end of 2016. A public beta began in February 2017. The system cost $35.9 million to install and test at the time of its public release. =Technology= The Hop Card uses ISO 14443-compliant RFID technology allowing the card to be read/written without direct contact. The card uses the NXP/Philips MIFARE DESFire EV1 256B. Hop Card readers can also read information from contactless bank cards and mobile wallets. =Brand= The card's initial design is an ISO 7810 standard-sized purple card, with the Hop logo, and the logos of the three participating transit agencies at the top, and a colored bar at the bottom. The colored bar indicates the type of card: purple for standard adult fares, green for \\"honored citizen\\" which includes seniors, low-income riders, and riders with disabilities, and orange for youth cards. Cards also have a hole punched in them for use with a lanyard. The Hop name was chosen in September 2015, beating out other candidates, including 1Pass, Indigo, Umbrella, Via and Lynx, that were proposed in 2014. Its name references both rabbits and the hops used in craft beers brewed in Portland. =Sales= Hop cards can be purchased at any participating transit agencies' ticket offices, as well as local grocery and convenience stores. Use \\"Vine\\" stations are mounted on freestanding posts. The card must be tapped each time the system is entered or a transfer is made. It can be tapped on boarding a bus or streetcar, or tapped before boarding the light rail, commuter rail, or BRT. On tapping the card a display shows the time remaining on the current ticket or pass. It also displays any relevant low-balance alerts with an audible sound. There is no penalty for tapping the card more than once within the duration of a ticket. Unlike some systems, there is no need to tap out when leaving the system since fare is the same regardless of the point of exit. =Ticketing/pricing= The network's fares are time-based rather than distance or segment-based. Tickets are available for unlimited travel over the course of 2.5 hours, one day, one month, or one year. Hop's fare capping system prevents riders from being charged more than the cost of a day pass during one day, or the cost of a monthly pass in the course of a month. This allows riders the benefits of a day or a monthly pass without the upfront cost, or the need to purchase one in advance. The card be reloaded online, over the phone, or with the Hop app using a credit or debit card. It can also be reloaded using a credit card or cash anywhere it can be purchased. Hop cards do not expire (except honored citizen cards, which must be renewed every two years). Once a loaded pass expires it can be reloaded with a new one. TriMet has said it projects a card will last 10 years. =Google Pay and Apple Pay= On May 21, 2019 TriMet announced that Hop could be added to Google Pay and Apple Pay by using the Hop Fastpass app on either Android or iOS. Hop was the first transit card in North America to launch availability in both Google Pay and Apple Wallet.\\"TriMet first with Android Pay virtual fare card\\" Retrieved Oct 11, 2019 Virtual Hop cards are functionally identical to their physical counterparts, allowing for the same fare capping rules, and allowing riders to purchase concession fares. Hop also allows riders to convert physical cards onto either mobile payment system. Future While paper tickets and passes are still in use, TriMet has stated that it plans to phase them out in favor of Hop.

Led by disabled people of color, Sins Invalid‚Äôs performance work explores the themes of sexuality, embodiment and the disabled body. In addition to multidisciplinary performances by people with disabilities, Sins Invalid organizes visual art exhibits, readings, and a bi-monthly educational video series. Sins Invalid collaborates with other movement-building projects and provides disability justice trainings.  Founding and Organizational History  Sins Invalid was founded in 2005 by Patricia Berne and Leroy F. Moore Jr. The organization, which Berne has described as \\"a hybrid between a community-based organization and a performance,\\" originated in the San Francisco Bay Area and tours nationally.Sins Invalid: An Unshamed Claim to Beauty in the Face of Invisibility. Dir. Patricia Berne. New Day Films, 2013. DVD. Berne and Moore, who are old friends, have both had disabilities since birth, and they started the project upon realizing the paucity of venues dedicated to celebration of their work and their bodies. Berne serves as Director of the organization, and she has been involved in work surrounding asylum claims, youth incarceration alternatives, the LGBTQIA community, and mental health support for survivors of violence, among other fields. Moore is Sins Invalid's Community Relations Director. His work extends to writing, poetry, lecture series, and hip-hop/music. He has worked, studied, and lectured internationally and is considered a \\"leading voice\\" regarding police brutality toward and wrongful incarceration of people with disabilities. According to a Huffington Post interview conducted by Cory Silverburg with Berne and Moore, Sins Invalid's (pronounced as in \\"not valid\\") name came from the idea that a disabled child is a manifestation of \\"the sins of the father being cast upon the son\\". As Berne articulates, there is a pervasive societal norm that validates bodies according to beauty, hygienic, health, and other sets of standards. The Sins Invalid framework asserts that humans have a wide variety of embodiments, and all bodies are valid and worthy of celebration. It is also a play on words, since people with disabilities have historically been referred to as \\"invalids\\". Since its creation, Sins Invalid has held annual major theater performances and an artist-in-residence performance, which have all received critical acclaim. In 2012, the project launched a Kickstarter campaign, culminating in the 2013 release of a 32-minute documentary titled Sins Invalid: An Unshamed Claim to Beauty in the Face of Invisibility, directed by Berne, which details its disability justice efforts and the value of artistic expression. The documentary also elucidates the need for inclusion of sex and sexuality in disability rights discourse. = Vision = A review by Terry Rowden states, \\"Moving decisively beyond any simple ‚Äòshock‚Äô or ‚Äòtransgressive‚Äô aesthetic‚Ä¶challenges the politics that systematically disables our ability to recognize beauty.\\" Berne has described the project as, \\"an erotic event featuring people with disabilities\\". Sins Invalid harnesses the power of the erotic, using it as a force in politicizing the disabled body. According to Audre Lorde, the erotic is a means to assert power for people who have historically been denied agency. She writes, \\"The erotic is a measure between our sense of self and the chaos of our strongest feelings.\\" Sins Invalid's invocation of the erotic is a means to empower those who have been denied a space for expression in the public sphere. Berne writes on the move from individual legal rights toward a collective human rights framework. Berne's writing speaks to both types of change. She uses herself as an example, discussing the fact that her wheelchair does not climb stairs and asking the reader if this is a problem with the wheelchair or a problem with the stairs. She encourages her audience to think critically about our surroundings and the barriers that exist for various members of society due to identity. Berne and Moore both view the oppression of the non-normative body as something to move beyond, toward opportunities for liberation and beauty and a new vision of embodiment.  Disability Justice  In the Cory Silverberg interview, Berne said, \\"I can experience my sexuality as a crip, as someone who fully occupies a non-normative physical space. And part of that movement to fully living in one's own experience is naming and resisting dehumanization.\\" Acknowledging the full history of disability in the United States requires a deconstruction of the dehumanizing practices that have plagued the community. All types of experiences are included in the show, and the denial of sexuality is part of that dehumanization. In the same interview, Moore said, \\"‚Ä¶we‚Äôre sharing these stories in a way that hopefully connects us to our past and also allows us to change our future.\\" The medicalized framing of disability has framed it as a problem to be cured, a pathology that decides, alongside doctors, the future of its host. People with disabilities are often told what their futures will look or feel like, and part of gaining agency involves the decision one makes when deciding one's future for oneself. Sins Invalid aims to reinforce this agency and choice in the futures of people with disabilities, including an audience in order to expand the message and so that people with and without disabilities might internalize it. Sins Invalid's celebration of the multiplicity and diversity of identities is an iteration of intersectionality in practice. The human body is not permanent and unchanging; rather, it is a non-static being that can change based on nature, the environment, or perception. Since disability does not discriminate, it is useful as a category of analysis in terms of its potential to create, as disability studies scholar Simi Linton puts it, \\"a prism through which one can gain a broader understanding of society and human experience\\". Since Sins Invalid includes performers with disabilities who are also people of color, queer, etc., intersectionality is woven into its performances and guiding ideology. In the documentary, Sins Invalid member Leah Lakshmi Piepzna- Samarasinha comments on the freedom that the space provides for various manifestations of difference, such as queerness. She says, \\"No one has to closet themselves,\\" and this applies to any identity. This ties into Berne's idea of being able to \\"orient the gaze,\\" or the position the audience occupies as consumers of the performance. Since the project is conscious of so many diverse lenses and does not limit the frame to disability, performers and audience members alike have the opportunity to feel empowered by the acknowledgement of identities. In order to understand the idea of embodiment, of occupying the body, Berne states, one must have an understanding of the body as situated within a historical, political, cultural, and social context. Feminist disability studies scholar Rosemarie Garland-Thomson argues that, \\"integrating disability as a category of analysis and a system of representation deepens, expands, and challenges feminist theory\\". For Garland- Thomson, the \\"shared human experience of embodiment\\" provides a framework in which all individuals should be able to understand the way systems affect or do not affect them based on their bodies.

The program trains people about sexual assault and domestic violence on college campuses, primary and secondary schools, and communities. It develops and offers training for sexual assault and domestic violence. The method teaches students to intervene by using the 3 D's: Direct, Delegating the responsibility to others, and creating a Distraction to defuse a potentially dangerous situation. As described by Green Dot an example of this is in a situation at a party, intervening could mean that instead of calling out an inebriated student, an individual can create a distraction by \\"accidentally\\" spilling their drink on a potential aggressor. Dr. Dorothy Edwards is the founder of the Green Dot Bystander Intervention program. Prior to creating the program Dorothy Edwards worked as the University of Kentucky's Violence Intervention and Prevention Director where she discovered that individuals were not sure how to respond when witnessing a potential sexual assault. In her first year of running the program she trained 10 individuals, but by the time she left the University of Kentucky she was training 3,500 students and volunteers. The initiative led by Dr. Edwards was supported by a new focus on bystanders in The White House. Green Dot, Bringing in the Bystander, and Coaching Boys Into Men are preventative bystander programs that have begun to make cultural changes. = Title IX = Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendment is a tool meant to combat campus violence.

A female or male who is incapacitated due to drugs and alcohol is legally incapable of giving consent and someone who has sex with an incapacitated person can be prosecuted for rape.

Personal characteristics may include being shy, fearful, or uncertain and not wanting to risk embarrassment. Relationship characteristics involve not wanting to upset friends or a party policer. General issues include the belief that someone else will intervene, the risk of embarrassment, or creating a scene. # Module four focuses on building skills and generating confidence in the performance of the program. #* There are two types of Green Dots: proactive and reactive. The goal of proactive Green Dots is to set the two norms that are communicated: violence will not be tolerated and everyone is expected to do his or her part to contribute to fostering a safe community. Reactive Green Dots are done in reaction to seeing concerning behavior or potential dangers, either to stop them from happening or decrease the likelihood they will get worse. The heart of the Green Dot Bystander Intervention program are the 3 D's: direct, distract, and delegate. Direct interaction with the potential perpetrator or victim can be used to address concern. Through Distraction a bystander can create a diversion to diffuse the potentially problematic situation. Lastly, through delegation a bystander can ask for someone else to help intervene in the situation. The 3 D's work in situations of high risk to act as reactive Green Dots. Examples of proactive Green Dots are creating social media campaigns, checking-in with friends, promoting awareness, and hosting green dot sports games. Examples of reactive Green Dots include: directly confronting a situation, distracting by changing the conversation and the energy of the interaction or by distracting the individuals, or delegating by finding someone who will be more successful in fixing the problem (bar tender, other friends, Police officer, etc.) = Case studies = Ann Coker at the University of Kentucky's Center for Research on Violence Against Women (CRVAW) led a study pertaining to the effectiveness at Green Dots' reduction of sexual violence. In the study, CRVAW found a greater than 50% reduction in the self-reported frequency of sexual violence perpetration by students at schools that received Green Dot training.Hautala, Keith. \\"'Green Dot' Effective at Reducing Sexual Violence.\\" University of Kentucky News: UKNOW.

Ann Coker, and the CRVAW team identify violence prevention as a public health priority. A recent study of 2,504 college undergraduate students between 18 and 24 looked at the impact of bystander intervention on college campuses. The study found that 46% of the students surveyed had heard a Green Dot speech on their college campus. Out of the sample size surveyed, only 14% had received active bystander training in the past two years. Students trained in Green Dot bystander intervention reported engaging in significantly more bystander behaviors and observing more self- reported active bystander behaviors compared to non-trained students. Those receiving bystander intervention training appeared to report more active bystander behaviors than those simply hearing a Green Dot speech, and both intervention groups reported more observed and active bystander behaviors than non-exposed students.Coker, A.

In an effort to create a large social media presence alongside existing racial justice campaigns, such as #BlackLivesMatter and #BlackGirlsMatter, the African American Policy Forum (AAPF) coined the hashtag #SayHerName in February 2015. In May 2015, the AAPF released a report entitled \\"Say Her Name: Resisting Police Brutality against Black Women\\", which outlined the goals and objectives of the #SayHerName movement. Following Sandra Bland's fatal encounter with police in July 2015, the AAPF, in conjunction with the Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies at Columbia Law School and Soros Justice Fellow, Andrea Ritchie, issued an updated version of the original report. The updated version includes a description of the circumstances surrounding Bland's death, as well as several accounts detailing recent incidents of police-instigated violence against Black women, including Tanisha Anderson and Rekia Boyd. In addition to these accounts, the report provides an analytical framework for understanding Black women's susceptibility to police brutality and state-sanctioned violence, as well as offers some suggestions on how to effectively mobilize various communities and empower them to advocate for racial justice. Drawing from the AAPF report, the #SayHerName movement strives to address the invisibilization of Black women within mainstream media and, more specifically, the #BlackLivesMatter movement #BLM. Of the movement's many agendas, one includes commemorating the women who have lost their lives due to police brutality and anti-Black violence. To advance this agenda, the AAPF, along with twenty local sponsors and the Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies at Columbia Law School, organized a vigil on May 20, 2015, in New York City, where dozens gathered to demand that the public no longer ignore Black women's struggles against gendered, racialized violence.  Origins of the movement  = Historical context = Women such as Hattie McCray and the girls of the Leesburg Stockade are mere examples of the police violence Black women face. Although the \\"SayHerName campaign began in 2015, police brutality has been an issue for Black women for much longer. = Creation of the campaign = The #SayHerName movement is a response to the Black Lives Matter movement and the mainstream media's tendency to sideline the experiences of Black women in the context of police brutality and anti-Black violence. In recent years, the killings of unarmed Black men like Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown have captured much more national attention and public outrage than the killings of Black women such as Rekia Boyd and Shelly Frey. According to Kimberl√© Crenshaw, one of the founders of the AAPF, Black women's continued exclusion from stories about police brutality, racism, and anti-Black violence contribute to an erroneous notion that Black men are the chief victims of racism and state-sanctioned violence which underplay issues such as rape and sexual assault by police. #SayHerName does not seek to replace Black Lives Matter or dilute its power, but aims to simply add perspectives and lived experiences to the conversation of racial injustice. The movement actively considers how multiple social identities (including gender, sexual orientation, and class) influence an individual's experiences with police brutality and anti-Black violence, a concept known as intersectionality. =Name of movement= The name of the movement seems to have two thrusts. It seems to advocate literally saying the names of Black women, both among individuals and in the media, who the movement perceives to have been the victims of police violence. And the concept of saying the name is also a symbol or shorthand for learning and telling the stories of these women, again both between individuals and in media. Crenshaw has said, \\"If you say the name, you‚Äôre prompted to learn the story, and if you know the story, then you have a broader sense of all the ways Black bodies are made vulnerable to police violence.‚Äù = Intersectionality = #SayHerName builds off texts and movements like Anannya Bhatacharjee's 2001 report Whose Safety? Women and the Violence of Law Enforcement in order to expand on systemic violence in a way that is committed to being intersectional. Works that have been published as results of intersectional approaches to victimization through violence include Beth Richie's Arrested Justice: Black Women, Violence, and America‚Äôs Prison Nation (2012) as well as a list from INCITE! Including The Color of Violence: The INCITE! Anthology, Law Enforcement Violence Against Women of Color and Trans People of Color: A Critical Intersection of Gender and State Violence, and Queer (In)Justice: The Criminalization of LGBT People in the United States. #SayHerName as a movement is largely based on the concept of intersectionality in order to bring attention to all victims of systemic violence. Intersectionality is a term that Kimberl√© Crenshaw was responsible for coining, its earliest usage being dated to 1989. Since then it has become a key element of many modern feminist practices. Brittany Cooper explains how intersectionality provides an analytical frame originally designed to address the unique positions of Women of Color within rights movements. Its relevance to #SayHerName is highlighted by Crenshaw's founding position in both the concept of 'intersectionality' and the movement itself. The focus on the victimization of Black women within the #SayHerName movement is dependent on the notion of intersectionality, which Kimberl√© Crenshaw describes as \\"like a lazy Susan ‚Äì you can subject race, sexuality, transgender identity or class to a feminist critique through intersectionality\\". Additional factors in an intersectional analysis within #SayHerName include cis or trans status, education, geographical location, and disability ‚Äì both on the parts of the victims being targeted and the officers responsible for the violence. Kimberl√© Crenshaw especially highlights the role of both physical and mental disability as a factor that puts victims more at risk of being targeted as threatening or otherwise violent by police. This is exacerbated by stereotypes of aggressiveness and poor emotional control attributed to Black women and men in the United States of America. Homa Kahleeli asserts that over seventy Black women have died as a result of either police violence or police misconduct within the past three years. In instances of police misconduct where firearms are discharged, both female and child victims of murder have been objectified with the label \\"collateral\\", which diminishes the violence of murder and erases responsibility of the officer. #SayHerName highlights collateral treatment as a unique form of violence that these victims face in contrast with the Black men addressed by the Black Lives Matter movement. Andrea J. Ritchie argues that in addition to/included within this group of seventy Black women is a larger category of people who have been targeted by police violence that #SayHerName addresses. This category includes the high rates of LGBT Women of Color, especially transgender Women of Color, who have been disproportionately targeted. These disparities emerge from gendered norms and stereotypes with roots in slavery and colonialism that have been further contextualized through the war on drugs and the legal debates surrounding LGBTQ rights.  Social media  The #SayHerName movement is one of many contemporary social justice campaigns that engage in hashtag activism and digital activism. Created by AAPF and CISPS in December 2014, the #SayHerName hashtag provides an online community for activists, scholars, news reporters, and other social media users to participate in the conversation on racial justice along with other social movements such as #BlackLivesMatter. The hashtag is mostly active on Twitter. Of its many uses, the #SayHerName hashtag has principally served to highlight recent incidents of Black women's fatal encounters with police and anti-Black violence as well as advertise upcoming events. An analysis of Twitter activity found that a third of Tweets using the hashtag were in conjunction with the name of a Black woman who was a victim of police violence. Other content using the hashtag included links to blogs written by Black women, such as The Huffington Post's Black Voices column, Blavity, and BlackGirlTragic.com. Second most frequent were academics, particularly Black feminist scholars, though the largest number of retweets came from a white male entertainer. By addressing recent incidents of police- instigated violence, the #SayHerName hashtag strives to advance one of the chief goals of the movement: to re-integrate Black women's lived experiences into mainstream racial justice narratives about police brutality and state- sanctioned violence. Through its engagement with hashtag activism, #SayHerName situates itself within a recent social historical development in which the media's tendency to disregard or heavily misrepresent events pertaining to racial justice incites activists to commit themselves to digital activism. In addition, with its increasing social media presence, #SayHerName provides an opportunity for a diversity of voices invested in racial justice to contribute to an ever-expanding discourse on Black women's susceptibility to police brutality and anti-Black violence. = Supporters = Some of the strongest original supporters of the #SayHerName movement include people who were directly impacted by the killings. Friends, family members, and individuals who shared similar social identities with the victims were and remain likely to participate in mobilization efforts. Mothers especially appear to have a strong emotional connection to the cause and are willing to speak out against police brutality and anti-Black violence. Given the accessibility of technology and today's 24-hour news cycle, many young people, (namely, those aged 18-34 years old) are often motivated to engage with one another and protest acts of racial injustice online. The movement has received support from several celebrities, which is integral to the spread of the movement and its social media reach. Through the use of the #SayHerName hashtag, influential figures can increase public awareness and shed light on instances of racial injustice, which can sometimes go unnoticed. Such high-profile support was seen immediately following the death of Sandra Bland: musical artist Janelle Mon√°e tweeted the #SayHerName hashtag, as did actress Taraji P. Henson. Nicki Minaj, Jessie J, and Zendaya Coleman all recognized Bland's death on Instagram. This kind of support further signifies the importance of intersectionality for both the general movement as well as its supporters. The American Civil Liberties Union has supported the movement, using the hashtag to promote activism particularly regarding violence against transgender Women of Color. The Human Rights Campaign likewise uses the hashtag in this manner. The 2017 Women's March also used the hashtag on their Twitter in recognizing transgender Women of Color killed in 2017.  Results  = Action = Since the movement began in late 2014, there have been two nationwide events (one that occurred in May of that year and another one twelve months later) to increase public awareness. The second #SayHerName Silent Protest: National Day of Action to End State Violence Against Women and Girls took place in major cities around the country and garnered significant attention on social media. In New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and elsewhere, men and women took to the streets with duct tape over their mouths to represent the silence and erasure of Black women and girls' narratives along with signs in their hands to remember those that have lost their lives to police brutality and anti-Black violence. = Criticism = Advocates claim that the #SayHerName hashtag has successfully created a safe online place for marginalized groups to come together and mourn their losses. However, as the hashtag spreads from Twitter to Facebook along with other social media platforms, the rhetoric does not change. Despite the diversity in background, with each woman sharing her story, the same underlying themes of vulnerability to physical police and aggressive sexual violence keep reappearing, making it appear that simply saying the names, remembering the faces and increasing awareness is not enough. Experts say that despite being only 7% of the population and outnumbered by white women at the ratio of 5:1, Black women and girls have accounted for 20% of the unarmed people killed by police since 1999. In other words, while the hashtag was able to bring awareness on a global platform and make a safe space to spark interest and conversation between different people, statistics are not showing a real change in the level of threat and violence towards Women of Color.  Relationship with #BlackLivesMatter  Although the movement makes an active effort to engage in discourse and conversation with the Black Lives Matter movement, #SayHerName is different in its construct, goals and methods. Feminist theorists such as Kimberle Crenshaw have pointed out that the #SayHerName movement addresses intersectionality of gender, class and disability that play out on Black women and girls' bodies. These are aspects that do not appear to be so readily addressed by the Black Lives Matter movement, which is specifically known as a movement that addresses racial inequality within the criminal justice system. Many supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement were largely sparked by outrage of the deaths of young, African-American males at the hands of police with excessive violence and no repercussion from the legal system. In contrast, when stories of African-American women meeting similar fates in just as harrowing circumstances were brought up, the number of supporters and advocates seemed to decrease; female victim's names and stories are generally less recognized than the male victims. #SayHerName aims to raise awareness of how sexism and racism simultaneously play out of colored female bodies, no matter their background, while still being a safe, inclusive space for all individuals to come together and create and participate in discourse.  Role of the African American Policy Forum  The #SayHerName movement represents one of three recent racial justice initiatives engendered by the AAPF. Since coining the #SayHerName hashtag in February 2015, the AAPF has assumed a central role in mobilizing the campaign ‚Äì an effort that has culminated into at least two significant events: the AAPF's release of the report \\"Say Her Name: Resisting Police Brutality against Black Women\\" and its sponsoring of \\"#SayHerName: A Vigil in Remembrance of Black Women and Girls Killed by the Police\\". Both events occurred in May 2015 and have served to disrupt mainstream racial justice narratives that attend exclusively to heterosexual, cisgender Black men's susceptibility to police brutality and anti-Black violence. = May 2015 report = In May 2015, the AAPF, in conjunction with the Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies at Columbia Law School and Soros Justice Fellow, Andrea Ritchie, issued a report entitled \\"Say Her Name: Resisting Police Brutality against Black Women\\". The report highlights the goals and objectives of the #SayHerName movement and presents several reasons as to why gender-inclusivity is a critical component of racial justice advocacy. In addition to these, the report includes several accounts detailing incidents from the last three decades of Black women's fatal encounters with police brutality and state-sanctioned violence. To supplement these accounts, the report incorporates an intersectional framework for understanding Black women's susceptibility to police brutality by addressing how the interactions between race, gender, sexual orientation, class, and ability inform the violent ways in which law enforcement officials treat Black women. After divulging recent incidents of police brutality against Black women, the report concludes with several recommendations as to how members of local communities, policy-makers, researchers, and activists can best incorporate a gender- inclusive framework into racial justice campaigns that specifically address police brutality and state-sanctioned violence. By contributing these recommendations, the AAPF, along with the Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies at Columbia Law School and Andrea Ritchie, hopes that the report could serve as a useful resource to which the media, community organizers, policy-makers, and other stakeholders invested in racial justice can refer. After Sandra Bland's fatal encounter with police in July 2015, the AAPF released an updated version of the original report. While the structure of the updated version is similar to that of the original report, the updated version contributes additional accounts of Black women's deadly encounters with police and includes a description of the circumstances surrounding Bland's death. By issuing the updated version, the AAPF strives to reinforce the critical, urgent need for policy-makers, the media, community organizers, and other stakeholders to tackle the structural inequalities that render Black women within the United States heavily susceptible to police-instigated, anti- Black violence.. The 2018 movie titled \\"Say Her Name: the Life and Death of Sandra Bland\\" incorrectly states at the end of the movie \\"The Sandra Bland Act is now law in Texas, mandating state-wide reforms to increase prison inmate safety. Police de-escalation training was removed from the bill.\\" However, this is false. The Senate version of the bill, by state Sen. John Whitmire of Houston, removed much of the language related to encounters with law enforcement (de-escalation training remained) and became a mostly mental health bill, which ultimately passed both chambers without opposition.

These policy recommendations can be implemented immediately, and they include: \\"find ways to support all families who have lost loved ones to police violence, create spaces to discuss how the intersections of patriarchy, homophobia, and transphobia impact Black communities as a whole, and continuously develop skills to talk about the multiplicity of ways in which state violence affects all Black women and girls, particularly those who are transgender, non-transgender and gender-nonconforming\\". = Events = The AAPF hosts events promoting the #SayHerName movement on a semi-regular basis. One example is an event taking place in March 2017 titled \\"Say Her Name: An Evening of Arts and Action Los Angeles\\". = Spread of the movement = Social justice activist, writer, and artist Piper Anderson speaking at \\"#SayHerName: A Vigil in Remembrance of Black Women and Girls Killed by the Police\\" In the evening of May 20, 2015, the AAPF, along with twenty local sponsors, including the Black Youth Project 100, and the Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies at Columbia Law School, organized an event called \\"#SayHerName: A Vigil in Remembrance of Black Women and Girls Killed by the Police\\". The purpose of the vigil, which transpired at Union Square in New York City, was to commemorate such women as Rekia Boyd, Tanisha Anderson, Miriam Carey, and Kayla Moore, among many others, who lost their lives due to police brutality and anti-Black violence. Of the vigil's many attendants, several included the relatives of Tanisha Anderson, Rekia Boyd, Shantel Davis, Shelly Fray, Alberta Spruill, Kyam Livingston, Kayla Moore, Miriam Carey, and Michelle Cusseaux. The vigil marks the first time that these family members gathered at the same location for the purpose of honoring the women who died as a result of police- instigated violence. In addition to commemorating the lives of such women as Shelly Fray and Kyam Livingston, the event featured speeches, singing, poetry, and art by scholars, artists, and activists, including Kimberl√© Crenshaw, Piper Anderson, Eve Ensler, LaChanze, and Aja Monet. Given how the vigil occurred one day prior to the National Day of Action on Black Women and Girls, one of its principal aims was to mobilize the New York City community into action against gendered and racialized forms of violence and police brutality. By demanding that the public no longer ignore Black women's struggles against gendered, racialized violence, the vigil's attendants strove to advance one of the chief goals of the #SayHerName movement: to re-integrate Black women leaders and victims of anti-Black violence into mainstream racial justice narratives about racism and police brutality. On the other side of the country in May 2015, Black women and girls also stood in the middle of San Francisco, holding signs and displaying painted messages on their bare chests. Some phrases included \\"I fight for those who have been murdered by the state\\", \\"with love for female masculinity\\" and \\"to end infant mortality\\". These women embodied a number of identities, some of which included queer and transgender individuals, all joining together to recognize state-sanctioned violence and sexual assaults targeting Women of Color. Onlookers were said to connect with the emotional stories protesters shared that day through conversation and the vulnerability of being naked, both in the moment and on a political level. Similar to how historically Black women were lynched and subject to physical abuse like Black men, today, Black women are raped, brutalized and killed by the police, vulnerable to violence and not empathized with or helped.

This collection, now considered a classic volume, of Lorde's most influential works of non-fiction prose has had a groundbreaking impact in the development of contemporary feminist theories. In fifteen essays and speeches dating from 1976 to 1984, Lorde explores the complexities of intersectional identity, while explicitly drawing from her personal experiences of oppression to include: sexism, heterosexism, racism, homophobia, classism, and ageism. The book examines a broad range of topics, including love, self-love, war, imperialism, police brutality, coalition building, violence against women, Black feminism, and movements towards equality that recognize and embrace differences as a vehicle for change. With meditative conscious reasoning, Lorde explores her misgivings for the widespread marginalization deeply-rooted in the United States‚Äô white patriarchal system, all the while, offering messages of hope. The essays in this landmark collection are extensively taught and have become a widespread area of academic analysis. Lorde's philosophical reasoning that recognizes oppressions as complex and interlocking designates her work as a significant contribution to critical social theory.  Themes  The paradoxical title of Sister Outsider expresses Lorde‚Äôs commitment to her identity and the multiplicities gathering together to assemble her unique identity ‚Äì multiplicities that often placed her ‚Äúon the line,‚Äù in a space that refused safety of an inside parameter, demonstrating Lorde's ability to embrace difficulty in the path to create change. Lorde informs readers through these essays that the histories of westernized culture have conditioned inhabitants to view ‚Äúhuman differences in simplistic opposition to each other‚Äù ‚Äì good/bad, superior/inferior ‚Äì and to always be suspicious of the latter, instead of as Lorde suggests, using differences as a catalyst for change . Throughout the collection, Lorde also emphasizes the use of poetry as a profound form of knowledge, a powerful tool for diagnosing and challenging power relations within a racist, patriarchal society. In this charged collection, Lorde challenges sexism, racism, ageism, homophobia, and classism with determination. She propounds the recognition of difference as an empowering vehicle for action and creative change and emphasizes the necessity for applying these concepts to the next generation of feminism - a response to the current lacking thereof between women in the mainstream feminist movement. Lorde also explores the fear and suspicion that arises among African American men and women, lesbians, feminists, and white women that ultimately creates an isolating experience for African American women \\\\- constructing a social institution that dehumanizes lives. Throughout these essays, Lorde confronts this problem of institutional dehumanization plaguing American culture during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and provides with philosophical reasoning, messages of hope. = The Erotic vs. The Pornographic = In Sister Outsider, Lorde tasks herself with discerning the difference and meaning of the erotic and the pornographic. This is all within the context of sexuality, power dynamics, and queerness. As Lorde says in her text \\"the erotic offers a well of replenishing and provocative force to the woman who does not fear its revelation, nor succumb to the belief that sensation is enough\\" . We see here that Lorde draws our attention to the emotional experience of sexuality, and defines the erotic in a way that disconnects the typical male dominated interpretation. She continues to separate the erotic and pornographic by conveying the effect of power between the two. \\"But pornography is a direct denial of the power of the erotic, for it represents the suppression of true feeling. Pornography emphasizes sensation without feeling\\". After defining these two terms she relates them to her own identity as a Black lesbian feminist. The erotic in her eyes is not simply a physical experience or drive, it is a show of resilience in the face of a racist, patriarchal, and homophobic society.  Publication  Lorde signed a contract with The Crossing Press on November 19, 1982 with a projected publication date of May 31, 1984. She was the first major lesbian author the press was to sign, despite the firm's policy of not taking books represented by agents. Lorde expressed to her agent that she felt rushed into signing the contract that provided an advance against royalties of a mere $100. The book was ultimately a huge financial success for the firm. It was republished in 2007 by The Crossing Press with a new forward provided by scholar and essayist, Cheryl Clarke.

Impact  Sister Outsider is a groundbreaking essential contribution to Black feminism, Postcolonial feminism, gay and lesbian studies, critical psychology, black queer studies, African American studies, and feminist thought at large. The canonical work has been cited by renowned scholars like Patricia Hill Collins, Donna Haraway, and Sara Ahmed. The publication was met with overall \\"resounding praise\\". A reviewer for Publisher's Weekly referred to the work as \\"an eye-opener.\\" American author, Barbara Christian, called the collection, \\"another indication of the depth of analysis that black women writers are contributing to feminist thought.\\" From this work, Lorde is said to have created a new critical social theory that understands oppressions as overlapping and interlocking, informed from her position as an outsider. She presented her arguments in an accessible manner that provides readers with the language to articulate difference and the complex nature of oppressions. American professor and theorist Roderick Ferguson cites Sister Outsider as a critical influence in his book, Aberrations in Black in which he coins the term Queer of Color Critique. Sister Outsider received critical reception, as well. The book challenges readers' unacknowledged privileges and complicity in oppression. Negative reviewers tended to focus on how Sister Outsider caused them discomfort with confronting their guilt as individuals whose identities occupy dominant positions within the United States, specifically through whiteness, maleness, youth, thinness, heterosexuality, Christianity, and financial security. While some reviewers claimed that the work is hard to identify with if they are not similar to Lorde, others refute this, claiming that Lorde uses a \\"flexible model of subject positioning\\" that allows readers of various backgrounds to determine points of similarity and difference, challenging their standard notions of selfhood and subjectivity. In The Man Question, Kathy Ferguson questions Lorde's employment of what she defines as \\"Cosmic Feminism\\", a feminism that relies on a feminine primitivism and values feelings that are more intense and seemingly deep-rooted.

Through their survivor-led model, My Life My Choice provides a continuum of services including survivor mentorship, prevention education, professional training, and advocacy and leadership development. Founded in 2002, My Life My Choice's mission is to harness the strength and power of survivors along with creating a network of allies to fight Commercial sexual exploitation of children My Life My Choice is nationally recognized for its prevention curriculum, which is used to empower and educate youth on recognizing the signs of perpetrators and the dangerous reality of the commercial sex industry. My Life My Choice mentoring services are available for girls ages 12‚Äì18 in Eastern Massachusetts and, since the launch of a pilot program in 2014, boys and transgender youth ages 12‚Äì18 in the Boston area. My Life My Choice has been featured in many different media campaigns, including Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn's documentary, A Path Appears, with Blake Lively. My Life My Choice works to influence legislature and government action, for example Associate Director Audrey Morrissey worked closely with the Attorney General of Massachusetts, Martha Coakley and the My Life My Choice leadership corps discussed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 with Congressman Joseph P. Kennedy III.  History  My Life My Choice was co-founded by Lisa Goldblatt Grace LICSW, MPH in 2002 after the death of a 17-year-old girl, Latasha Cannon. Before her death, Latasha was living at a Child Protective Services funded group home and unknown to adults in her life, was being commercially sexually exploited. After Latasha's brutal murder, Boston's leaders came together and discovered that this was not an isolated incident, it was just one of many similar cases My Life My Choice was born out of Latasha's death to combat the commercial sexual exploitation of children. My Life My Choice has grown into a nationally recognized organization in the fight against the commercial sexual exploitation of children. In 2006, My Life My Choice was recognized as a national model for sex trafficking prevention by the United States Department of Justice. The My Life My Choice curriculum is being used nationwide as a preventative model to combat the commercial sexual exploitation of children. Additionally, in 2009 My Life My Choice became a part of the Justice Resource Institute. The Justice Resource Institute (JRI) is a non-profit organization in Massachusetts that works in partnership with community members \\"to pursue the social justice inherent in opening doors to opportunity and independence\\". My Life My Choice is one of the twelve 'Community Based Behavioral Health Services' programs at the Justice Resource Institute. In 2010, My Life My Choice was recognized as one of Root Cause's Social Innovators of the year. The upward growth of My Life My Choice can also be seen in their 2011 and 2014 award of the highly competitive United States Department of Justice \\"Mentoring for Child Victims of Commercial Sexual Exploitation and Domestic Sex Trafficking Initiative\\" grant.  Mission  \\"The mission of My Life My Choice is to prevent the commercial sexual exploitation of adolescents through survivor-led programs that educate and empower youth to find their voice and create a positive life path while working to eliminate the violence and victimization of commercial sexual exploitation. We have a laser focus on strengthening the power, and amplifying the voices, of those who are most vulnerable and of those who have survived exploitation. We are building a network of allies to stand up to the force of the illegal sex industry and create long-lasting social change\\".  Structure  My Life My Choice uses four main methods to fight back against the commercial sexual exploitation of children: survivor mentorship, education, training and advocacy. = Survivor mentorship = The survivor mentorship program at My Life My Choice pairs exploited youth or youth that are at high- risk of being exploited with an adult female survivor. The survivor mentorship provides one-on-one support, guidance, tools to become a healthy and successful adult in society, a place of belonging, and a sense of hope for exploited or high risk youth. The survivor mentorship program maintains a long term focus of recovery ‚Äì always maintaining contact and support for the youth they serve. Anti -trafficking activist and creator of Girls Educational and Mentoring Services Rachel Lloyd has said \\"My Life My Choice is the gold standard in mentoring programs for commercially sexually exploited and trafficked girls\\". = Prevention education = My Life My Choice has a ten- session nationally acclaimed prevention curriculum that is used to educate and empower youth on recognizing the signs of perpetrators and the dangerous reality of the commercial sex industry. The prevention curriculum groups are offered all over the United States in schools, group homes, or other community settings. An example of the My Life My Choice curriculum in use is at the R.I.S.E. House (Residential Intervention for the Sexually Exploited) in Redwood City, California. The curriculum is delivered in ten sessions by trained staff, including at least one licensed clinician and one survivor of commercial sexual exploitation. The goal of the curriculum group sessions is to change the youths perceptions of the commercial sex industry, in addition to building self-esteem and personal empowerment in fighting against commercial sexual exploitation. = Professional training = My Life My Choice offers elementary and advanced training on the commercial sexual exploitation of children to law enforcement and service providers. Trainings focus on general education about commercial sexual exploitation of children, risk factors of exploitation, techniques for identification of exploitation, and how to support exploited youth and connect them to services. The purpose of training professionals is to increase the identification rate and improve the response of providers to exploited youth. = Advocacy and leadership = My Life My Choice brings the voices of survivors of sexual exploitation to the forefront in the fight against commercial sexual exploitation of children; collecting and harnessing the resilience of a collective group of survivors and allies to strengthen the message that this crime is unacceptable. My Life My Choice partners with other organizations who are also working to end the commercial sexual exploitation of children, for example the SEEN Coalition and the Massachusetts Attorney General's Anti Trafficking Taskforce. Additionally, My Life My Choice provides opportunities for the youth they mentor to participate in leadership and advocacy roles through the MLMC Leadership Corps. Leadership Corps members engage in a variety of activities including serving on an advisory committee to the SEEN Coalition and the Boston Police Department, meeting with Congressman Joseph P. Kennedy III to discuss the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, and creating materials for My Life My Choice to improve their work. = Board = My Life My Choice has a board of twelve members who possess knowledge about adolescent development, marketing, legal services, non-profit management, and government. With this knowledge, the board members provide guidance and support to the MLMC senior staff. Board members can be found here:  Media coverage  = A Path Appears = My Life My Choice was featured in Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn's three part PBS documentary, A Path Appears, and with Blake Lively. A Path Appears, Episode 1 sheds a light on the issue of sex trafficking in the United States as well as effective solutions that have been implemented. During Episode 1, Blake Lively and Nicholas Kristof visit My Life My Choice to learn about the work they do and to investigate the sexual exploitation of young girls and women. Blake Lively during this documentary stated, \\"The most powerful thing is for women not just to be the beneficiaries of the change, but to be agents of it ... My Life My Choice is such a powerful organization because it utilizes survivors\\".

The women's motocross league is separate from men's motocross because of the different rules, and also the different bike sizes. Women generally race bikes that are 125cc or 250cc because they are not big enough to ride a 450cc. These differences make it hard for men and women to compete together however it is done and is allowed. Women compete in the AMA races but rarely make it into the main event because their practice laps and heat laps are not fast enough. Women's professional motocross has the support of professional male riders also. Male riders think that growing the sport in any way possible is a positive and that the more people riding the better the sport will be. As well as having the support from male riders, females are starting to step up and support their colleagues as well, by helping each other train and practice, there is support from both males and females that is helping the sport to go exponentially.  Background and history  Motocross started in approximately 1924 over in Europe and spread very quickly to the United States due to immigration and the moving of families for job and freedom opportunities. Women's professional motocross is an organized sports league where females can compete for money and prizes at the highest level of motocross. Women's motocross began in Europe in the early 1950s and 1960s and moved to the United States in the middle of the 1960s. This was during the time that women's equality movements were strong, helping the sport to grow. In 1971 Kerry Kleid was the first woman to receive a professional motocross rider license, which was revoked after it was discovered that she was a woman. When processing her license paperwork, the registry did not know that she was a female because there was no box that indicated this information. When she showed up at the first race in Unadilla, she was told that she could not race because she was a woman. Kerry then went to court and eventually won her license back. However, this was the first time in history when women understood that they could be professionals in the world of motocross. In 1974 the first Powder Puff National Championship took place which marked the first time that a specifically women's National Championship was available for female motocross riders in the United States. The \\"Powder Puff\\" was a motocross event where women could race in heats in order to qualify for the main event, or the last race of the night with the chance to win the championship. In 1975 the event's name was changed from the Powder Puff National Championship to the Women's Motocross Nationals. The championship took place ever year consecutively from 1975 through today, although in 1982 and 1986 the races were not held. In 1996 the Women's Motocross League (WML) was founded after the first Women's Supercross Championships took place in 1995. Because of this the WML was allowed to petition to be a part of the AMA Pro Motocross Championship, which included the men's ranks and races. This led to the creation of the Women's Motocross Association, which was founded in 2004 and sold to MX Sports, a large motocross corporation, in 2009. The selling of this allows for women's motocross to remain a permanent part of men's motocross and the motocross industry. This also caused a change in the naming of WMA to WMX, so that it would fit in with the rest of the corporation. In order to keep women racing factory teams started to offer female riders contracts so that they could get the women to race their motorcycles. Factory teams are large corporations and the main companies that produce and distribute motorcycles. There are over 250 factory teams in the United States alone including the major ones Suzuki, Yamaha, Honda, KTM, and Kawasaki. Without these sponsorships and contracts it is nearly impossible for a person to support a professional race team on their own, the cost is too much. In order to receive a factory ride, the women had to prove that they were on top of the game and that they were willing to work hard and put the hours necessarily in to get better. The training that they endure goes beyond just riding their dirt bike, it happens in the gym and on pedal bikes as well. These riders worked for the best bikes that money could buy, because if they did not they would be out of a job and also unable to support their racing. It costs over $200,000.00 a year for an elite motocross rider to be ready for the season. This includes having the best bike, the best trainers, spare parts, a way to get the bikes to the track, fuel costs and many more expenses.  Culture  Women's motocross is full of people who have a no quit mentality and are often heard saying things like \\" I won't quit until I am physically unable to ride\\". These mentalities are what keeps the sport alive and well, without them it would have died long ago. Women's motocross is a sport that requires dedication and constant work, so the people who are involved in it, both the riders and the teams, have to be mentally strong. In order to make this sport a success women had to put in hard work and be mentally strong, they heard the word no more times than most but kept going. Having a strong mentality is what allows women's sports at the professional level to be a success. Much like the male counterpart, professional women's racing requires hours of training in order to be on top. This league is full of only the best riders and the most successful women, so without the mental aspect, these women would not be able to compete in the league. The biological level of mental toughness plays a large role in the success of this sport, women who have had parents who did not allow them to quit and who pushed them harder than they thought they could be pushed often came out on top because they were trained not to quit. There are physiological reasons that some athletes possess the ability to be best, the way that their mind functions and the hormonal excretions in their body allow them to push themselves hard and longer than the regular person. It was in their mind and heart to be the best, much like every other athlete, how a competitor does their job says a lot about who they are as a person, and how far they are willing to go in order to win.  Most influential female rider  There rider who stands out of the pack when talking about women's motocross is Ashley Fiolek, she has the ability to go above and beyond the normal realm of what is expected of the female rider. , She is the fastest female on the track and knows it, with a confidence that most women dream of having she takes each lap for what it is and has a level head that allows her to keep pushing and progressing. = Ashley Fiolek = Ashley Fiolek, a native of Dearborn Michigan, born on October 22, 1990 is the most accomplished rider of this generation. She has won more amateur and professional races than anyone else in her age group and has stayed on top for the longest period of time. She was born deaf which is one of the most important reasons for why she starting racing. Because Ashley was unable to hear and participate easily in team sports, she picked up riding due to the fact that she could do it by herself and not have to talk or hear anything other than the bike. Being deaf served as one of her greatest advantages while racing because she could not hear what was going on outside the track, she only had to focus on what she was doing which allowed her to dial in and focus at a level that most other riders are unable to do. She is able to get on the track and block everything else out other than the things that she is focusing on, such as jumping, cornering and passing competitors. Ashley started racing dirt bikes when she was just 7 years old and has been racing ever since. Fiolek is a factory rider for Team Honda, with whom she has been signed ever since she was young. They give her the support that she needs in order to run the cleanest and most successful bike on the track. Through their sponsorship, Ashely is able to ride one of the best bikes available. At the young age of 21 Fiolek walked away from racing in the pros due to the impossible contracts and because the sport that she loved was taking a turn that she did not want to continue on with. Ashley now trains younger riders to be the best racers that they can. Though there are other influential riders in women's motocross, none hold the same list of accomplishments that Ashley does.

This term has been described as an \\"invisible hand\\" that guides reality and perceived reality. Dominant narrative can refer to multiple aspects of life, such as history, politics, or different activist groups. Dominant culture is defined as the majority cultural practices of a society. Narrative can be defined as story telling, either true or imaginary. Pairing these two terms together create the notion of dominant narrative, that only the majority story is told and therefore heard. It is a common theme to hear or learn only about the dominant narrative as it comprises the perspective of the majority culture. Examples of dominant narrative can be seen throughout history. Dominant narrative can be defined and decided by the sociopolitical and socioeconomic setting someone lives his or her life in. Dominant narrative is similar in some ways to the ideas of metanarrative or grand narrative. These two terms refer to the notion that there is a common lived experience, or a totalizing narrative, experience, or account of history. Unlike the above terms, dominant narrative as a concept is used to explain not just only that there is one narrative told, but what makes it possible for that to be the narrative that is told. This term addresses what the reasons are that the dominant narrative is, in fact, dominant or the majority account. It is also important to look at who is not included in the dominant narrative and how this can affect society and people in those marginalized groups. Not everyone has access to being a part of the dominant narrative. Counter-narrative has been coined as the term regarding the stories and lived experiences of those not in the dominant narrative or not allowed to be a part of it. Counter-narrative are used as a way to share minorities stories excluded and combat the dominant narrative.  Who is the dominant narrative?  The dominant narrative can most often be seen as those that occupy scholar Judith Lorber's A-Categories. Lorber defines and describes A-category members as those that occupy the dominant group in different aspects of life. For example, that can be seen in the topic of race (human categorization) with white being the A-category and all minorities being the not-A; or in the topic of gender with man being the A-category while woman being the not-A. This notion includes all intersectionalities such as age, sexual orientation, CIS/Transgender, ableism, education, and citizenship. The dominant narrative are those that take part in and benefit from being associated with the dominant culture. Having forms of privilege and power that come from being in Lorber's A Categories, can directly relate to being in the dominant culture. The dominant narrative simply consists of whose voice can be recognized and represented when retelling stories, or whose voice/story is perceived as valid or real.  Critiques and concerns with dominant narrative.  There are a number of critiques and concerns with there being a dominant narrative in society. Many of the critiques of there being a dominant narrative come from the exclusion of counter-narratives. To fully understand what the dominant narrative is and understand examples of it is necessary to understand its limitations. Some limitations with there being a dominant narrative include the following: = Metanarrative among dominant group = Having a dominant narrative can create a notion that there is a metanarrative among the dominant group, meaning all apart of the dominant group are experiencing life the same way. In using the example of the caucasian dominant narrative, this would mean that all Caucasians of somewhat similar sociopolitical and socioeconomic standing are experiencing life and events the same, and that is not true. A dominant narrative can generalize the lived experiences of people within the dominant culture. The metanarrative among the dominant culture creates the notion that whiteness is the norm, and that the dominant culture is the normal culture to which other cultures need to adapt. The perceived sense of normalcy can be very problematic because it encourages people within the majority to not change and question what could be wrong with having such a strong dominant narrative. = Ignores the lived experiences of minorities = Having a dominant narrative based on the dominant culture, therefore means anyone not in the dominant culture cannot be a part of the dominant narrative. Since the dominant narrative is accepted as the norm this, therefore, means those not in the dominant narrative are abnormal. Someone's narrative and perceived narrative can greatly affect how someone views themselves and relates to themselves. If someone is not part of the dominant narrative and their story is not being told, that means their lived experiences are being ignored and in turn written out of history. Lived experiences, similar to counter-narratives, can be defined as everyday experiences people face and most often referring to those in the minority group. Lived experiences have also been called material realities, meaning that they are the real, tangible experiences and realities that people live on a daily basis, even if they are counter to the dominant narrative. Terry is cited for explaining how inequalities, can affect which narrative and tellings are able to be heard and which aren't. If the stories of people with inequalities are not heard, then this completely ignores them, and any agency they could have in society. = How does society ever know the truth? = Jeyn Roberts is quoted for saying \\"there are three sides to every story. Yours. Mine. What really happened: the truth.\\" Dominant narrative makes it so only one side of any story is told, this completely ignores any other sides or even the truth. By definition, a dominant narrative does not include every and all aspects of any event. By only learning about and studying the dominant narrative then people are only being educated partially about any historical or current events. This creates a false historical account of most of history. Winston Churchill has been associated with the saying \\"history is written by the victors.\\" This saying directly relates to the concept of dominant narrative and how the full truth of events as it relates to minorities is not being retold. This means that through mainstream education and media people are not being put forth the most accurate information and historical accounts.  Examples of dominant narrative  Dominant narrative can be seen in almost any aspect of life from media, history, advertising, and activism. The following are some examples of places dominant narrative can be present: = History = History is one of the most important fields to acknowledge that dominant narrative is present. It is important for people to have a full and accurate understanding of historical events, this is often muddled by the dominant narrative. A historical example of dominant narrative ignoring contributions of people of color can be seen in the military realm. A historical example of black men being ignored for their contributions to the US Military can be understood in the instance of the Tuskegee Airmen. The Tuskegee Airmen was a program based out of Tuskegee, AZ in 1941, in which African-American men were trained and educated in multiple aspects relating to war aircraft. Due to racist ideologies many opposed African-American men being trained to become US Military pilots. Although the Tuskegee Airman overcame great obstacles and contributed immensely to US Military acts in World War II, they have not been given considerable recognition until Bill Clinton commemorated Tuskegee as a national historic site. Even though the Tuskegee Airmen deserved recognition for all they were contributing to the war and in terms of overcoming racial prejudices, because of the WWII dominant narrative they were not given recognition until people fought for their behalf. There are many other historical contributions made by people not in the dominant culture, which are never retroactively recognized and acknowledged.  Indigenous Peoples in North America  A dominant historical narrative exists in U.S. portrayal of Indigenous peoples pre-European contact. Proponents of the counter narrative argue that, through education, cinema, and media, the American society portrays indigenous peoples as far less civilized than their European colonizers. Academia asserts that this notion is in fact a fallacy, perpetuated by a systemic type of xenophobia that labels indigenous cultures as ‚Äúuncivilized‚Äù or ‚Äúsavage.‚Äù In attempts to reshape this general misconception, a counter narrative regarding the perception of Indigenous peoples has come to light. For instance, contrary to popular belief, Indigenous peoples had complex, structured societies prior to European contact. Vast infrastructure, extensive trade networks, and governing bodies were already in place. The Muskogees even had a ruling structure strikingly similar to the three branches of government that exist today in the U.S. The Anasazi developed a circuit of roads, and the main commercial areas‚ÄîChaco Canyon and Cahokia, present-day New Mexico and Missouri, respectively‚Äîfacilitated the exchange of the three sisters crops of corn, squash, and beans, and tallow, a residue of mutton fat essential to the local pemmican diet. To supporters of this counter narrative, the widespread use of the three sisters crops and tallow across the entire continent demonstrates the efficiency of the Indigenous people's interconnected trade networks, and further challenges the dominant master narrative depicting the Indigenous peoples as uncivilized. = News Media = Like historical accounts, journalism and news media can also be framed in the dominant narrative lens. This historical dominant narrative can affect what news people are actually being exposed to. This is problematic because only news that the dominant narrative deems important receives the most media attention. An example of the dominant narrative at play in the media can be seen in the way the Rwandan genocide was almost completely ignored by Western media and news. This genocide consists of the ethnic majority group, the Hutu, attempting to extinguish the Tutsi ethnic group. Initially, the Rwandan genocide was not framed by the media as a genocide, in an attempt to ignore the severity of the event. The early developments of the Rwandan genocide were minimalized as a way to justify a lack of intervention by many countries. Since the events in Rwanda did not directly affect US citizens the genocide did not seem to be as big of a deal in media, especially because the genocide consisted of black non-Americans this genocide was hardly discussed, as it is a counter-narrative to the dominant narrative. But even when race is not a factor at play the mass media can shape the dominant narrative in a way to instil indifference and avoid intervention. This happened, for instance, during the early phases of the breakup of Yugoslavia, as many international authorities disputed and denied that a genocide was taking place in Bosnia. = Activism = People who do not fit into the dominant narrative can also be written out of activist movements, and in turn written out of history later on. There are some needs and intersections of privilege that are necessary to participate in some forms of activism. Not everyone is able to participate in activist work because of their socioeconomic status, their sociopolitical status, their job safety, their families or childcare needs. Limitations like those just mentioned can greatly affect who is active and participates in social activism. Because someone, most likely not in the dominant culture, may not have the means to participate that means their narrative may not be shared. An example of dominant narrative in activism can be seen in Women's rights movements. First- wave feminism has been critiqued for a lack of inclusion of black women and race in their movements. Feminist history is often explained in a framework of the contributions made by white affluent and educated American or British women. White women with higher socioeconomic standings were not the only women that took part in the first-wave feminist activism, but most often were the only ones that were given access to political gains and recognition.

Through the feminist concept known as intersectionality, it is recognized that sexism, racism, classism, and other forms of inter human oppression are all connected. Vegetarian ecofeminism aims to include the domination of not only the environment but also of nonhuman animals to the list.Gaard, Greta. \\"Vegetarian Ecofeminism: A Review Essay.\\" Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies. ( 2002): 117-146. Web. 2 October 2015 Vegetarian ecofeminism is part of the academic and philosophical field of ecofeminism, which states that the ways in which the privileged dominates the oppressed should include the way humans dominate nature. A major theme within ecofeminism is the belief that there is a strong connection between the domination of women and the domination of nature, and that both must be eradicated in order to end oppression. Vegetarian ecofeminism extends beyond ecofeminism because it believes that the way in which humans exploit and kill nonhuman animals should be distinctly recognized, and that the oppression of humans is linked to the oppression of nonhuman animals. The concept of speciesism is central to distinguishing between vegetarian ecofeminism and ecofeminism, and it strongly links the hierarchies created among nonhuman animals to the hierarchies created among humans. Distinguishing between ecofeminism and vegetarian ecofeminism is important because of vegetarian ecofeminism's focus on the oppression of nonhuman animals provides connections between the other linked forms of oppression, but specifically the oppression of women. Speciesism Speciesism is a form of oppression central to the ecofeminist concept, and the belief that speciesism is a valid form of oppression that must be eradicated is at the center of most vegetarian ecofeminist arguments. It is used to support the exploitation and killing of nonhuman animals. Much like any other form of oppression, speciesism is a social construction that benefits the dominant at the expense of the oppressed. =Humanism in opposition to vegetarian ecofeminism= Humanists believe that speciesism is not a \\"bad -ism\\" like racism or sexism, because while women, people of color, and any other group of oppressed humans are moral humans, nonhuman animals are not and therefore do not deserve the same rights. According to humanism, the domination of humans over animals is justified, and animals are indeed meant for human consumption. Human rights are inherently more important than animal rights because their biological differences from human makes them morally different as well. Vegetarian ecofeminists argue that there is an inherent bond between humans and nonhuman animals, and the human supremacy and degradation of animals that ensues is a social construction meant to undermine the human-animal bond. It is in fact not the characteristic of an abnormal few who care and empathize with nonhuman animals, but the normal state for most humans. This is exemplified by the cross-cultural practice of pet-keeping or the usage of animals in therapy, which demonstrate the strength of the bond between humans and animals. The act of expiation in which humans justify the act of killing nonhuman animals shows that humans are inclined not to harm animals, otherwise there would not need to be any mechanisms created cross- culturally to help deal with the guilt felt in killing animals. =Hierarchies= The hierarchy created among nonhuman animals validates the hierarchies created among humans. Humans identify more closely with nonhuman animals that have human characteristics, and this allows for humans to create a hierarchy that places nonhuman that humans are able to identify more closely with at the top, and those it shares less characteristics with at the bottom. Humans have evolved to sympathize with beings similar to themselves. This allows humans to justify the killing of certain animals over others, because due to the hierarchy humans have created, some animals are of lesser value and therefore have fewer rights. For example, Western cultures kill cows, chickens, and fish for consumption, but find it morally wrong to kill lions, dogs, and dolphins. That is because Western moral values find connections between humans and lions, dogs, and dolphins, but do not find connections between cows, chickens, and fish, and therefore value certain species' lives over others. Which species are valued over others differs depending on culture, country, religion, etc., as can be seen in the fact that it is socially acceptable to eat dogs in many Asian cultures, but is seen as morally corrupt in most Western cultures. The lack of a universal hierarchy for nonhuman animals shows that it is a social construction created to benefit humans. Vegetarian ecofeminism argues that the killing of any animal is part of a larger system of oppression, and that instead of choosing one animal over another, or a human over a nonhuman animal, humans should care about all oppressed subjects and should be invested in ending each subject's oppression, so as to end the oppression of all beings. The creation of hierarchies in nonhuman animals can also rapidly become the creation of hierarchies in humans, and thus one can once again observe how speciesism is linked to racism, classism, sexism, and other forms of oppression. Vegetarian ecofeminism asserts that as long as \\"humans are violent toward animals, they often are violent toward one another\\" and this \\"vicious circle of violence and destruction can end only if and when the human species learns to form harmonious relations ‚Äì non-hierarchical and non-exploitative ‚Äì with other animal species and the natural world.\\" Vegetarianism Vegetarian ecofeminism argues that the oppression of nonhuman animals and the oppression of women are closely linked, so vegetarian ecofeminism argues that eating meat makes one complicit in the exploitation of animals. It also makes one complicit in the violence towards animals and women, for \\"meat-eating is a form of patriarchal domination ... that suggests a link between male violence and a meat-based diet\\". The phrase \\"the personal is political\\" is deeply embedded in ecofeminism, because just as it is hypocritical for feminists to buy products created in sweatshops, it is hypocritical for feminists to buy products produced by factory farming. Feminists recognize that buying and consuming these products, whether they are clothes made by a woman denied her Human rights in Cambodia or meat from a cow whose rights as a nonhuman animal were violated until it was killed, is an act of support to sweatshops and factory farming, but also to the larger patriarchal system at play. It is also noted that vegetarianism can be a means to protest violence of all kinds because it believes that \\"animals and humans suffer and die alike. Violence causes the same pain, the same spilling of blood, the same stench of death, the same arrogant, cruel and brutal taking of life.\\" Vegetarianism is therefore a way that ecofeminists can embody their beliefs, because eating meat directly supports the domination of humans over nonhumans, speciesism, and the creation of hierarchies. Or in other words, \\"the fact that our meat- advocating culture has successfully separated the consequence of eating animals from the experience of eating animals\\".Barnard, Neal. 1990. The evolution of the human diet. In The power of your plate. Summertown TN: Book Publishing Co. Web. 11 November 2015. The dairy industry acquires revenue via artificial insemination and the consequential lactating of female bodies. When their calf is born, the newborn is immediately taken from their mother. If they are a male calf, they are destined to be sold to the veal or beef industry. If they are a female calf, they are destined to live the same dairy cow life as their mothers. Vegetarians are able to empathize with nonhuman animals and reject the notion of speciesism, and their diets reflect their beliefs. Vegetarian ecofeminists do the same but connect it to the larger picture of systematic oppression, and recognize that the only way that humans are able to justify their oppression of animals is to discredit the empathy and sympathy felt for nonhuman animals. Link between sexism and speciesism While the goal of vegetarian ecofeminism is to end all oppression, it does focus on the connections between the oppression of nonhuman animals and the oppression of women. Both are objectified by men within the dominate discourse of the patriarchy, though in different ways: women are seen as sex objects and nonhuman animals are seen as food. In both instances, both beings are considered to be less than men, and therefore are able to be used, abused, and consumed by those with more privilege. There are often essentialistic and empathetic connections made between human mothers and nonhuman mothers, and ecofeminist scholar Carol Adams exemplifies this when she states \\"As a lactating mother, I empathize with the sow whose reproductive freedoms have been denied and whose nursing experience seems so wretched.\\" Generalizing women as mothers is problematic because not all women identify as mothers, yet there often is a strong link made between women and nonhuman animals due to their shared experience and oppression as mothers. The egg, veal, and dairy industry directly profits from exploiting the reproductive system of female non-human animals. Similarly, many industries profit from objectifying, dominating, and consuming female human bodies. The advertising industry often objectifies women's bodies, as something to be dominated and consumed. Adams asserts that the culturally accepted belief that animal bodies are \\"disposable objects for fun or eating\\" emboldens the acceptance of \\"heterosexuality as normative and the idea that pleasuring men is women's work\\". =Linking sexism and speciesism through language= Women are often objectified by being compared to a piece of meat or dehumanized by being called a 'cow' or a 'bird'. There is indeed a history of dehumanization through equating humans to animals, which because of speciesism, means that they are devalued and considered to be less than other valued humans. This is often seen in cases of genocide, for in Rwanda the Tutsi were compared to cockroaches for many months leading up to the actual genocide.Adams, C. J. 2006. The War on Compassion. In J. Donovan and C. J. Adams (eds) The Feminist Care Tradition in Animal Ethics. New York: Columbia University Press, 2007, pp.21‚Äì38 Viewing humans as animals makes it easier to oppress them, and thus it is once again clear that in order to end the oppression of humans, one must also work to end the oppression of nonhuman animals, because so long as nonhuman animals are viewed as inherently inferior to humans, dehumanization will continue to be justified with comparisons to nonhuman animals. Morality and ethics Sympathy towards nonhuman animals and recognizing that the same dominant power is abusing all of the oppressed is essential to ending all oppression because \\"humans have an innate sense of sympathy and that this is the basis for moral awareness\\", and are therefore able to make the moral and sympathetic connections between human experiences and nonhuman experiences. These can include the connection mothers will feel to cows being exploited for their milk, or the understanding among \\"people of color, women, gays, and lesbians [who] all know the experience of being hunted-of being \\"prey\\" in Western culture.\\" Vegetarian ecofeminists argue that as feminists, those who recognize the domination of the patriarchal power, should also recognize the way in which it dominates and objectifies nonhuman animals, and should therefore feel a moral obligation to end not only women's oppression, but animals' oppression as well. =Need for justification when harming nonhuman animals= Harming animals goes against humans' natural instincts, and language is used to hide the harm humans cause nonhuman animals. In farming, the act of killing a nonhuman animal is not known as \\"slaughter\\" but as \\"termination\\" or \\"meat-packing\\" and the animals themselves are referred to as \\"livestock\\". This terminology prevents sympathy, through disconnecting the living animal from the product, and by masking the harm done to these nonhuman animals by humans. Another justification for exploiting and harming animals is that it is a necessary function in order for humans to survive. This is supported by the discourse that humans must consume meat and eggs in order to be healthy, or that animal testing must be used to advance medicine. So while humans are naturally empathetic and caring to nonhuman animals, there are a great deal of obstacles created by \\"the substantial power of institutionalized animal exploitation [that] sustain ignorance, promote fear, reward cruelty, and punish kindness.\\" These obstacles are deeply ingrained in many societies and thus social justice for nonhuman animals is often difficult to obtain. The feminist‚Äìvegetarian connection The feminist‚Äìvegetarian connection first appeared in Sheri Lucas' \\"A Defense of the Feminist-Vegetarian Connection\\", a response to Kathryn Paxton George's book Animal, Vegetable, or Woman? A Feminist Critique of Ethical Vegetarianism (2000). The feminist‚Äìvegetarian connection is a concept indicating that the oppression of animals in the form of being slaughtered and consumed is parallel to the oppression of women in a patriarchal society, which establishes a connection between feminism and vegetarianism. Carol. J. Adams first published on this topic in 1975. However, this topic was mentioned in 'few publications' for ten years afterwards. The lack of acknowledgment on this topic in the 1980s became a concern amongst feminists and, eventually, triggered the formation of an 'Ecofeminist Task Force' in 1990, raising awareness on the feminist‚Äìvegetarian connection. After 1990, this connection was extensively analysed in articles and journals by numerous scholars such as Josephine Donovan and Kathryn Paxton George. Criticism Kathryn Paxton George argues against the connection between vegetarianism and feminism, stating that vegetarian diets place \\"arbitrary burdens upon females that males do not have to bear.George, Kathryn Paxton (1994). \\"Should Feminists Be Vegetarians?\\". Signs. 19 (2): 405‚Äì434. George bases this claim on the belief that men to be more likely to succeed on a vegetarian diet than women, stating the potential health risks brought by a vegetarian or vegan diet are \\"rare for Western adult males, for whom the ideal is best suited\\". For example, she has cited pregnancy as a source of nutritional stress that poses a risk of harm to the fetus. She has also described socioeconomic disadvantages of women as a barrier to vegetarianism, especially in concern to the use of iron and B12 supplements. Additionally, George has cast doubt on the validity of research on plant-based nutrition, claiming that it was \\"done almost entirely on men.\\" Murphy, Meghan (18 December 2011). \\"PODCAST: Should Feminists be Vegetarians?\\". Feminist Current. Retrieved 26 October 2016. Voices in support of the feminist‚Äìvegetarian connection =Food choices and gender identification= Some scholars such as Carol J. Adams and Josephine Donovan support the feminist‚Äìvegetarian connection. In The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory, Adams establishes \\"the cross-mapping between feminism and vegetarianism\\" through an in-depth analysis of gender identification embedded in people's food choices. In a patriarchal society, \\"meat is constant for men, intermittent for women\\". For example, Ethiopian women and girls of all classes are obliged to prepare two meals, one for the males and a second, often containing no meat or other substantial protein, for the females. Also, women who prepare to be pregnant are told that \\"one should eat meat (or fish, vegetables, chocolate, and salt) at least six weeks before becoming pregnant if one wants a boy. But if a girl is desired, no meat please, rather milk, cheese, nuts, beans, and cereals\\". Additionally, there are cultural food taboos that concern meat consumption based on gender; women are commonly forbidden to have \\"chicken, duck, and pork\\" and also \\"fish, seafood, and eggs\\" in some Asian countries. Only \\"vegetables and other nonmeat foods are viewed as women's food\\". Thus, gender identification is heavily associated with the eating of animals; meat-eating links with masculinity while vegetable-eating suggests \\"emasculation or femininity\\". This gender- based reading of meat-eating is further accentuated by \\"Derrida's notion of carnophallogocentrism,\\" indicating that \\"masculinity and carnivorism work together to support the virility, power, and authority of one who argues, dialogues, and speaks reasonably\\". =Links between women and animals= Adams also argues that animals and women are linked through \\"fused oppressions\\" as \\"we oppress animals by associating them with women's lesser status\\". Examples include the use of different gender pronouns based on whether an animal poses as having \\"a major power (he) or a minor power (she)\\". In this case, a major power refers to an active power and a possible danger to the speaker while a minor power refers to the power as a potential prey, a power that has to be destroyed. Adams further explains that \\"'she' represents not only a 'minor power', but a vanished power, a soon-to-be-killed powerless animal\\". Through Adams' analysis, a female-gendered pronoun becomes an indicator of the oppressed, \\"representing the violated victim of male violence\\". Thus, women and animals are linked through \\"a shared and co-constitutive mechanism of oppression that manifests linguistically, particularly through metaphor\\". In addition, Adams indicates that people exploits animals' \\"femaleness\\" through the consumption of female animals such as hens and cows as well as their by- products such as eggs and dairy. In the meat industry, slaughters are told not to slaughter female animals \\"in the advanced stage of pregnancy\\" because \\"the physiological condition of the female is disturbed and the flesh is not normal\\". Conclusively, Adams states that \\"the text of the body upon whom we write the fate of being meat is symbolically if not predominantly female\\". Furthermore, Adams argues that the links between women and animals are reinforced \\"through a structure of the absent referent\\". For instance, animals whose flesh is called \\"meat\\" become \\"absent referent\\" through butchering; by renaming dead bodies as meat, people \\"do not conjured dead, butchered animals, but cuisine\\". On the other hand, Women also becomes absent in the language about sexual violence. For example, the term \\"rape\\" is used metaphorically to depict other devastating violent incidents, such as rape' of the earth in ecological writing of the early 1970s. In this case, the experiences of women are recalled \\"as a vehicle for explicating another being's oppression\\" yet women themselves are absent. According to Adams, violence against both women and animals in the form of \\"sexual violence and meat eating ... find a point of intersection in the absent referent; ... if animals are the absent referent in the phrase 'the butchering of women', women are the absent referent in the phrase 'the rape of animals. Vegetarian ecofeminism brings to light the interconnecting oppressions of women and animals within the patriarchal hierarchy. One primary issue that feminists address is autonomy over their bodies, independent and free from control from the church and the state. Vegan ecofeminist Marti Kheel contends that \\"the lack of control that women have over their reproductive capacity in patriarchal society is magnified on factory farms where female cows are kept in a continual state of lactation, and where rape racks are routinely used to impregnate female animals\\". =Alliance between feminism and vegetarianism= After acknowledging the connections amongst vegetable-eating, women, and animals, Adams proposes that \\"not only was vegetarianism a logical enacting of a moral viewpoint, but it also resonated with feminist theory and female experience\\". According to ethicist Beverly Harrison, feminists must be with their bodies and acknowledge that all their knowledge, including their moral one, is 'body-mediated knowledge'; disconnecting from their bodies would result in the destruction of 'possibility of moral relations' amongst feminists. Adams further asserts that \\"ethical vegetarianism is a theory people enact with their bodies\\" as \\"vegetarians identify a connection between a healthy body and a diet that honors the moral relations between us and other animals\\". From a biological point of view, Adams supports the arguments that humans have bodies of herbivores as opposed to those of carnivores due to the biological evidences from humans' \\"teeth, saliva, stomach acids, and length of the intestines\\". Thus, vegetarianism and feminism are connected through the predominant involvement of one's body. Veganism is a method of rejection to partaking in the oppression of animals in a patriarchal culture. =Other voices and evidences supporting the feminist‚Äìvegetarian connection= Through evidences from several nutritional studies that prove the health benefits of vegetarian and vegan diets, Donovan explicitly proclaims that \\"yes, feminists should be vegetarians\\" one year after the publication of George's article \\"Should Feminists be Vegetarians?\\" in 1994. Donovan quotes \\"Nutritional Consequences of Vegetarianism\\" that with appropriate attention to nutritional needs, the health consequences of vegetarianism itself are neutral and in some respects may even be positive. Based on nutritional studies done in 1994, she also quotes that \\"infant, children, adolescents, and pregnant women have ... special needs ... vegan diets can safely be used by these groups if foods, and in some instances, supplements, are selected which provide a healthful and nutritionally adequate diet ... In many cases, vegan diets offer health benefits\\". Donovan also claims that \\"most non-Western diets are largely vegetarian\\" and meat-eating, as a 'Western norm', is imposed on non-Western countries through 'Western cultural imperialism'. Moreover, according to Lucas, \\"in the West, nearly all of the available flesh, milk products, and eggs are the output of cruel, violent, and wasteful practices\\". By extension, purchasing and consuming any animal products directly supports cruelty. Such evidences disproving the potential biological and environmental harm caused by vegetarianism accentuates the necessity of adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet while being a feminist. According to Donovan, \\"feminism must take a stand against animal suffering and exploitation, including human consumption of meat\\". Praxis =Activism= While vegetarian ecofeminism is at its core an academic field, its main principles and ideas ‚Äì eradicating all oppression by including speciesism and emphasizing the link between speciesism and sexism ‚Äì can be transferred from theory into action through activism. Activism can take many forms, one of the most common and achievable being the power of boycotting products that support the exploitation and abuse of women and/or animals. For example, vegetarian ecofeminists might boycott products that were created in sweatshops and therefore exploited women, or products that were tested on animals or that were created by killing animals and therefore exploited nonhuman animals. The act of being a vegetarian or a vegan is itself a form of boycotting, for it choosing not to consume products that were created at the expense of killing or abusing nonhuman animals. Even at the Ecofeminist Task Force of the National Women's Studies Association suggested that no animal products should be served the 1990 NWSA meeting or at future conferences due to ecological and humane issues. Vegetarian ecofeminist might put their beliefs into practice by participating in demonstrations, as was seen at the 1990 March for the Animals in Washington, D.C., when ecofeminists carried a banner showing their support of recognizing how the domination of humans over nonhumans animals fits into ecofeminism, but also feminism in general. Key thinkers Since vegetarian ecofeminism is part of the larger academic field of ecofeminism, the most significant thinkers of vegetarian ecofeminism are part of both, but one of their focuses is connecting the domination of women to the domination of nonhuman animals, and understanding how animal liberation fits into ecofeminism. Greta Gaard is one of the main thinkers within ecofeminism in general, but especially within vegetarian ecofeminism. Aside from being an activist and a writer, she is also a professor at the University of Wisconsin, River Falls. Her essay entitled \\"Vegetarian Ecofeminism\\" speaks to many of the key concepts within the field, including the importance of including speciesism in ecofeminism. Carol J. Adams, both a vegetarian ecofeminist writer and activist, has spent over twenty years writing about ecofeminism, focusing on the importance of connecting speciesism to sexism. Her article entitled \\"Ecofeminism and the Eating of Animals\\" is an essential work to the field, and draws upon the importance of not consuming meat as an ecofeminist. Another one of her major works is \\"The Sexual Politics of Meat\\", which once again examines major themes in vegetarian ecofeminism.

We Belong Together is an initiative that is taking place all over the United States, which seeks to bring together women from across the nation to bring attention to immigration laws that impact women. The campaign also gathers women together to fight for immigration reform. This campaign was formed to address issues that are not taking into account the experiences of women, who make up the majority of the immigrant population in the United States. The campaign offers a gender-based analysis and focuses on the importance of maintaining nuclear families together.  History  The campaign was created on Mother's Day in 2010 after a group of women from the National Domestic Workers Alliance and the Asian Pacific American Women's Forum traveled to Arizona to investigate the ways in which anti-immigrant law SB1070 would impact women, children, and families. There, these women found that a large number of families were being separated and deported and that a large number of women were suffering from violence which their immigration status prevented them from seeking help in many of these cases. The immigration system in place did not address any of these women's issues. The co-chairs of the campaign are currently Andrea Mercado and Miriam Yeung. The campaign is designed to unify and empower women, despite their immigration status, and to mobilize them in efforts to demand a just and fair immigration process be established. They argue that women and children are the face of immigration and thus policies must be implemented that will focus on this population that has been very much ignored. We Belong Together mobilizes women to work towards a \\"common sense\\" immigration reform to keep families together. The campaign also focuses on issues that directly affect women that are currently not being addressed such as violence and domestic abuse.  Goals  * Advocates for legislation that provides a clear pathway to citizenship for immigrant women * Acknowledges the contributions that immigrant make to the U.S. economy * Ensures the safety of women who suffer from violence and domestic abuse * Offers health services to women that in need * Secures all families and their reunification  Campaign  We Belong Together fights against the exploitation, immobility, and violence against women, despite their documention status. Their main focuses on include creating a faster route for citizenship, stopping deportation and the separation of families and working to provide quality services for all women in the United States. Eligibility for citizenship: Eligibility criteria for women to obtain legal status on their own is close to not possible as most women come to the United States through family based admissions, rather than through employment admissions. This prevents women's independence. Work: Immigrant women have less opportunities to partake in formal employment. In addition domestic services are most of the times not acknowledged to have much significance on the economy. Exploitation: Women are more vulnerable to face exploitation in the workplace then their counterparts. Most of the time, women are paid significantly less, work extreme hours, are exposed to hazardous environments and also suffer from sexual abuse, harassment, and assault in the workplace. Deportation: Immigrant women who are detained, face the violation of their rights as human beings, such as the lack of due process and separation from families, including their children. Health: Most immigrant women do not have access to health care services and health insurance due to their undocumented status and/or low income status.  Programs  Some of the programs that they have initiated, include, the Women's Fast for Families, Wish for the holidays, 100 Women, 100 miles March, and the 100 women civil disobedience. During the ACT. FAST. Women's Fast for Families, over 1,000 women fasted for at least 24 hours throughout the United States. The fast ended with a protest on Capital Hill to \\"feed courage\\" to lawmakers who refuse to address women's needs within the current immigration system. Wish for the Holidays has taken place every year since 2010 during the holiday season. Wish for the Holidays is when children deliver cookies in the shapes of hearts and letters that were written by children and women who all shared the same wish: for fair immigration reform to be passed in order to keep families together. These letters provide personal narratives from children, women and allies to communicate with congress, lawmakers, and the president how deportation and lack of immigration reform affects them. The 100 Women, 100 Miles Pilgrimage took place on September 15 to 13, 2015 in which 100 women marched from Pennsylvania to Washington D.C.. The purpose of this march was to greet the Pope and give him the message of how the immigrant population was suffering from inhumane laws and criminalized by the United States government. The 100 Women Civil Disobedience took place on September 12, 2013, in which over 100 women participated in a civil disobedience act to demand \\"fair immigration reform.\\" 104 women were arrested for blocking the intersection outside of the Capital Building. 28 of the arrested women were undocumented. This was the largest civil disobedience act in which women came together to address the issue of immigration. In 2017, children and teens involved in the group used their spring break to protest the immigration policies of Donald Trump.

In 1866 first color photography is taken. With introduction of photography, a new form of art emerge.  Nineteenth century  = Daguerreotype = In spring 1839, the daguerreotype was introduced into the United States by an Englishman named D.W. Seager, who took the first photograph of a view of St. Paul‚Äôs Church and a corner of the Astor House in Lower Manhattan in New York City. Painter and inventor Samuel Finley Breese Morse had met Louis Daguerre in Paris in the spring of 1839, becoming the first American to see his photographic process and becoming enamored with it as a result. When he returned to the United States later that year, he enthusiastically promoted the daguerreotype while hailing Seager's prototypical image. Morse had painted The Gallery of the Louvre in 1833, and the appeal of the medium of the daguerreotype was an obvious one to him: it was a means of making faithful copies of artworks, in addition to anything else that would be still in front of the slow eye of the camera. = Portraiture = Given the long exposure time initially required to capture an image, the subject had to be immobilized, so buildings and other stationary objects proved to be the most cooperative to photograph. However, as the chemistry and techniques improved - American inventors were soon winning prizes for innovative techniques at world expositions, establishing the US as a leader in the developing art field - it became possible to make images of the human subject. At a time when the painted portrait was a luxury few could afford, the daguerreotype arrived with the promise of letting virtually everyone establish a visual self-image, even if it might be only slightly bigger than a large postage stamp. The working-class daguerreotype studios charged 50 cents an image, the equivalent of half a day's labor. It wasn't cheap, but it was far less expensive than a portrait. Not all of the portraits were successful ones, however. The subject was generally required the subject to sit without moving from between five or ten seconds (at best) and several minutes. The discomfort of having one's head fitted into the jaws of an iron positioning apparatus could produce startling results: stony stares, wild-eyed glares, and eyes frightened by the monstrous staring lens of the camera. Despite this unflattering image, however, photography was establishing a new standard for visual reputation. The portrait's most treasured quality was that it was an exactly corresponding record of what had existed in front of the lens. In addition to the private aspect of portraiture, there was a public one. Portrait galleries sprang up in urban centers around the country, and the aspiring middle class would go to view all the portraits on display. Daguerreotypes of various public figures - often enlarged and hand-colored - would line the walls of these galleries. Viewers would admire and study the images for the signs of the distinction, substance, and character that they felt the subjects of the portraits represented. = The Civil War = On April 15, 1861, Abraham Lincoln called up 75,000 militiamen to put down an insurrection of southern states after Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter on April 12‚Äì14, 1861. Mathew B. Brady, one of the preeminent photographers of the day, secured permission from President Lincoln to follow the troops, for what everyone thought would be a short and glorious war. He only saw the first major engagement, The First Battle of Bull Run, and lost his wagons and other equipment in the chaos of the Union defeat. Deciding to forgo any further action himself, Brady instead put together a corps of field photographers who, together with those employed by the Union Army and Alexander Gardner, made the first extended coverage of a war. The war photographers worked with collodion wet-plate photography, a photographic process invented by the Englishman Frederick Scott Archer. Unlike a Daguerreotype, the process produced a negative, which could be replicated. A major complication with it, however, was that the photographer had only ten minutes from the coating of the plate to the development of the photograph in which to take the picture, and one needed a portable darkroom to use it properly. Due to the chaotic and dangerous nature of the battlefield, the photographers could only depict such things as strategic sites, camp scenes, preparation for or retreat from action, and, on occasion, the grisly aftermath of battle. = The beginnings of the consumer camera = With the progression from the collodion process to the dry-plate process, amateur photography was already on the rise in the United States. However, there was the issue of the annoyance of changing the photographic plates between each shot. The lasting solution to this issue was a product introduced by George Eastman in 1884: a flexible, gelatin-coated paper, followed closely by a holder for a 24-frame roll. Soon after this, Eastman introduced Eastman American film, which featured a thin gelatin layer that was removed from the paper backing after development for additional clarity in making prints. In 1888, Eastman's company issued the first easy-to- use, lightweight Kodak camera. It was priced at $25, loaded with a hundred frames, and was almost instantly popular. When the user had used up all 100 exposures, he or she would simply mail the camera back to Kodak, where the used film was developed and the camera was reloaded with a fresh roll of frames and was then mailed back to the customer along with the previous batch of printed images. In 1889, Eastman's company began producing cellulose nitrate, or \\"celluloid\\", film, which didn't require the Eastman American film's paper backing. This last innovation paved the way for motion picture film stock. However, it was highly flammable and this material eventually gave way to cellulose acetate. = Notable nineteenth-century photographers = In the nineteenth century various photographers developed new methods and technics to capture and produce photographs, including: * Mathew Brady (1822‚Äì1896), photographer * Eadweard Muybridge (1830‚Äì1904), photographer * John Moran (1831-1902), photographer * Jacob Riis (1849‚Äì1914), photographer * Gertrude K√§sebier (1852‚Äì1934), photographer * Alfred Stieglitz (1864‚Äì1946), photographer * Edward S.

These women frequently have a long career and enjoy being single as a result of social changes that have made marriage later in life common and reduced gender discrimination in the work place. They are also interested in developing themselves and their skills. They frequently spend much money shopping and enjoying trips overseas. They do not prioritise love or marriage in their lives. In modern consumer- based society, this group often becomes influential. They are often criticised with the derogatory term \\"doenjang girls\\" ('soy bean paste girls').http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=371134&cid;=42028&categoryId;=42028 which characterizes them as obsessed with brand names and their appearance. They seek a luxurious life of consumerism and depend on their husbands' resources, even if this is not consistent with the amount of money they possess. Doenjang girl has similar negative connotations to the term gold digger in English-speaking countries. A gold miss, though, is not the same as a doenjang girl; gold misses are able to make social and economical progress, building up wealth for themselves and enjoying their lives using their own resources. A gold miss should not be confused with similar Japanese concept, the hanakosan. The difference between a hanakosan and a gold miss is that a hanakosan is a woman who has failed to find a marriage; by contrast, a gold miss normally chooses not to marry.  Characteristics of a gold miss  An unmarried woman with a high level of academic education, who receives a high income as professional workers, can be defined as a gold miss. In addition, the term refers to single woman aged in her mid-30s or above who has a job at a major company. Gold misses' often make over 40 million won per year, and can sometimes be worth over 80 million won (acquired through either investment or real estate).  Gold miss and marketing  The term gold miss (Í≥®ÎìúÎØ∏Ïä§) was originally used in Korean in a social and economic context, because gold misses were leading the new trend of consumption in the travel business, the fashion industry, the beauty industry, and the food service industry.  Old Miss  A similar term, old miss, refers to an elderly woman who has passed the suitable time for marriage, roughly equivalent to the words spinster and old maid in English-speaking countries. The suitable time for marriage can differ widely, depending on an individual's culture or era.  Gold miss vs silver miss  The term silver miss refers to a single working woman who is outperformed by a gold miss. This term most probably derives from the lower status silver has with gold. The single working women described as 'Silver Misses' normally satisfy three conditions: firstly, they have graduated from university; secondly, their annual income is about thirty million won; thirdly, they are between thirty and forty years old. Their interests and career plans tend to be similar to those of a gold miss. However, silver misses tend to be less wealthy than gold misses, so they must minimise their expenses.  Criticism of the term gold miss  The term gold miss might seem to be a friendly colloquial expression describing a woman's abilities. However, it has been criticised for concealing a concern with materialism and discrimination against women. In addition, it suggests that non-standard female workers are being problematised. Sang-soo Ahn, who works in Korean Women's Development Institute, said \\"Despite the appearance of 'Gold Miss', most women are pressured into following the traditional role of their gender.\\"  See also  * The variety show \\"Gold Miss is coming\\" involves six female entertainers (who are described as gold misses) participating in various activities, including blind dates. * The film \\"Queen of Reversals\\" is about a woman (Director Han Song-yi, played by Ha Yoo-mi) who corresponds to the characteristics of a gold miss. Director Han Song-yi is a female executive in charge of marketing in Queens Cosmetic company.

Inclination in the modern philosophy of ethics is viewed in the context of morality, or moral worth.  History  The definition of inclination has varying definitions in philosophy. Aristotle \\"holds it to be the mark of a good person to take pleasure in moral action,\\" or what one wants to do. Immanuel Kant made a study of whether inclination is of the highest moral worth, and objected to Aristotle's analysis, reasoning that \\"it is the person who acts from the motive of duty in the teeth of contrary inclination who shows an especially high degree of moral worth.\\" Immanuel Kant = The Shopkeeper = Kant posits the example of a shopkeeper who continually charges fair prices to customers in order to build good will and repeat business. If the shopkeeper continued that practice due to a mere inclination (to obtain repeat business) rather than sense of duty (higher principles of fairness and justice), though the shopkeeper's keeping the prices fair may conform with duty it has \\"no true moral worth.\\" If instead the shopkeeper kept the prices fair solely out a duty to justice then he is acting simply from that duty. And in that case, in so doing Kant argues that the act now has \\"genuine moral worth.\\" But changing the facts of the example might lead to an altogether different conclusion. If instead the shopkeeper is nearly bankrupt and desperately needs money to feed his family, and still the shopkeeper keeps the prices fair less out of a sense of duty but rather a sense of pride (an inclination), then some may argue that it is more impressive to stay fair under those circumstances.  Criticism  Kant argues that acting out of pure duty has the highest value, in that the visitor is doing the right thing for the right reason, because it is the right thing to do. It is not always clear whether inclination is morally more worthy than duty, or vice versa. For example, if following one's moral duty to always tell the truth has the highest value, then telling the truth (the location of a person) where it results in the murder of that person may show that following pure duty may not have the highest moral value. But many criticisms of Kant do not take into account that he did not preclude other acts from having moral worth, instead Kant is said to have only valued acting from pure duty as having \\"true\\" or \\"authentic\\" moral worth. Philosophers tend to disagree on whether operating solely out of duty is always the most morally worthy thing to do, rather than operating via inclination. = The Hospital Visitor = One famous example illustrates the difference between inclination and duty while illustrating a criticism of it, as given by Michael Stocker in his paper The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories (1976). The visitor could be seen as lacking in moral merit. In other words, which scenario has more moral worth: one in which the friend goes to the hospital out of a cold sense of duty (what one should do) instead of wanting to do it (inclination)? Kant might argue that the former has the \\"true\\" or \\"authentic\\" moral worthiness where Stocker argues acting purely out of duty in his example is morally inauthentic.

Private staff  The commission was established on 5 January 1977 on the initiative of Alexandr Podrabinek along with a 47-year-old self-educated worker Feliks Serebrov, a 30-year-old computer programmer Vyacheslav Bakhmin and Irina Kuplun and was composed of five open members and several anonymous ones, including a few psychiatrists who, at great danger to themselves, conducted their own independent examinations of cases of alleged psychiatric abuse. The leader of the commission was Alexandr Podrabinek who published a book Punitive Medicine containing a ‚Äòwhite list‚Äô of two hundred of prisoners of conscience in Soviet mental hospitals and a ‚Äòblack list‚Äô of over one hundred medical staff and doctors who took part in committing people to psychiatric facilities for political reasons. The psychiatric consultants to the Commission were Dr Alexander Voloshanovich and Dr Anatoly Koryagin.  Investigating activities  The task stated by the Commission was not primarily to diagnose persons or to declare people who sought help mentally ill or mentally healthy. However, in some instances individuals who came for help to the Commission were examined by a psychiatrist who provided help to the Commission and made a precise diagnosis of their mental condition. At first it was psychiatrist Aleksandr Voloshanovich from the Moscow suburb of Dolgoprudny, who made these diagnoses. But when he had been compelled to emigrate on 7 February 1980, his work was continued by the Kharkov psychiatrist Anatoly Koryagin. Koryagin's contribution was to examine former and potential victims of political abuse of psychiatry by writing psychiatric diagnoses in which he deduced that the individual was not suffering from any mental disease. Those reports were employed as a means of defense: if the individual was picked up again and committed to mental hospital, the Commission had vindication that the hospitalization served non-medical purposes. Also some foreign psychiatrists including the Swedish psychiatrist Harald Blomberg and British psychiatrist Gery Low-Beer helped in examining former or potential victims of psychiatric abuse. The Commission used those reports in its work and publicly referred to them when it was essential. The commission gathered as much information as possible of victims of psychiatric terror in the Soviet Union and published this information in their Information Bulletins. For the four years of its existence, the Commission published more than 1,500 pages of documentation including 22 Information Bulletins in which over 400 cases of the political abuse of psychiatry were documented in great detail. Summaries of the Information Bulletins were published in the key samizdat publication, A Chronicle of Current Events. The Information Bulletins were sent to the Soviet officials, with request to verify the data and notify the Commission if mistakes were found, and to the West, where human rights defenders used them in the course of their campaigns. The Information Bulletins were also used to provide the dissident movement with information about Western protests against the political abuse. The Working Commission also gathered information about relevant international events and published reports on the Honolulu Congress of the World Psychiatric Association, including the texts of the key resolutions, and printed translations of long letters by Professor Peter Berner about the course of establishing the Review Committee on abuse.  Foreign reactions  Over fifty victims examined by psychiatrists of the Moscow Working Commission between 1977 and 1981 and the files smuggled to the West by Vladimir Bukovsky in 1971 were the material which convinced most psychiatric associations that there was distinctly something wrong in the USSR. Peter Reddaway said that after he had studied official documents in the Soviet archives, including minutes from meetings of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, it became evident to him that Soviet officials at high levels paid close attention to foreign responses to these cases, and if someone was discharged, all dissidents felt the pressure had played a significant part and the more foreign pressure the better. In the autumn of 1978, the British Royal College of Psychiatrists carried a resolution in which it reiterated its concern over the abuse of psychiatry for the suppression of dissent in the USSR and applauded the Soviet citizens, who had taken an open stance against such abuse, by expressing its admiration and support especially for Semyon Gluzman, Alexander Podrabinek, Alexander Voloshanovich, and Vladimir Moskalkov.  Forcing shutdown  Members of the Working Commission have been stifled through exile and imprisonment. All of its members were arrested or forced to emigrate. The Working Commission ceased to exist on 21 July 1981 when its last member Feliks Serebrov was sentenced to 5 years of camps and 5 years of exile. Prior to that, members of the Working Commission were arrested and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment and exile: Alexander Podrabinek was sentenced to 3 years of imprisonment (convicted for the second time), Vyacheslav Bakhmin was sentenced to 3 years of imprisonment, Leonard Ternovsky was sentenced to 3 years of imprisonment, Irina Grivnina was sentenced to 5 years of exile, and Anatoly Koryagin was sentenced to particularly severe punishment under Part 1 of Article of 70 the RSFSR Criminal Code, 7 years in prison camps and 5 years of subsequent exile. The charge was anti-Soviet activities for having corresponded with the British medical journal The Lancet, which published an article by Koryagin critical of the Soviet government's use of involuntary psychiatric confinement for political reasons. On 5 April 1981, the Moscow Helsinki Group members Yelena Bonner, Sofiya Kalistratova, Ivan Kovalyov, Naum Meiman issued document No. 162 \\"The Arrest of Anatoly Koryagin\\" which stated,  References   Further reading  * Category:Organizations established in 1977 Category:1977 establishments in the Soviet Union Category:1977 establishments in Russia Category:1981 disestablishments in the Soviet Union Category:1981 disestablishments in Russia ","title":"Working Commission to Investigate the Use of Psychiatry for Political Purposes"},{"id":"47752208","text":"Celsinotum candango is a species of crustaceans. Its epithet comes from the name applied to people that built the city of Brasilia and was subsequently used for its inhabitants.

Description This species description is based on a parthenogenetic female. Its body is rounded and high, compressed laterally. Its maximum height is at the middle of the body, its height/length ratio being 0.75‚Äì0.8 in adults. Its dorsal margin is arched, the posterior margin being somewhat convex. Its posterodorsal angle is broadly rounded, with approximately 25 long setules. It also counts with a row of about 50 to 70 long and thin setules along the posterior margin on the inner side of its carapace. The carapace ornamentation is observed as lightly developed longitudinal lines. Its head is elongated and narrow, its rostrum is obliquely truncated. The ocellus is small, the eye being two times larger than the former. It possesses three major head pores of similar size with a narrow connection between them. The animal's thorax is three times longer than its abdomen. The postabdomen narrows distally, the length of which is equal to about 2.5 heights. It counts with setae natatoriae about 2.1‚Äì2.3 the length of the preanal portion of its postabdomen. Its antennule is long and narrow, nearly reaching the tip of the rostrum; the antennular seta is thin, of about half the length of the antennule. It exhibits nine terminal aesthetascs, the two longest being about 2/3 the length of the antennule itself. All the aesthetascs project beyond the anterior margin of the head shield. Seta arising from the basal segment of its endopodite are thin and shorter than the endopodite itself. It counts with 5 thoracic limbs. Distribution At present, C. candango was only reported from the type locality: Lagoa do Henrique (Bras√≠lia National Park), which is a small (diameter about 200m) shallow freshwater pond, with macrophytes almost all over its area, surrounded by typical \\"Cerrado\\" vegetation (tropical savanna). The sample was taken at the beginning of the dry season being the depth at sampling site of about 20‚Äì40 cm.

Use of land access to common facilities in the piece such as hallways, heating system, elevators, and exterior areas are executed under legal rights associated with the individual ownership. These rights are controlled by the association of owners that jointly represent ownership of the whole piece. The United States Census Bureau indexes information about condominiums and cooperative apartments, among other types of households, at its Survey of Market Absorption of Apartments. As of October 2015, this compilation includes 95 metropolitan areas of the United States. Some condominium buildings in the United States have been listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. In some cities in the United States, such as Lakewood, Ohio, city governments have attempted to invoke eminent domain upon residents to take over their property and enable private developers to build condominiums. This may be done in an effort to generate more revenue by increasing property tax bases. A housing cooperative, or co- op, is a legal entity, usually a corporation, which owns real estate, consisting of one or more residential buildings; it is one type of housing tenure. Housing cooperatives are a distinctive form of home ownership that have many characteristics that differ from other residential arrangements such as single family home ownership, condominiums and renting.

L√≥pez de Nelson (1879‚Äì1965) was an Argentine educator and women's rights activist who served as Argentina's representative to the Inter-American Commission of Women from its founding in 1928 into the 1940s. She was the first woman in Argentina to earn a doctorate of letters and was a founder of the Argentine Association of University Women. Biography Ernestina A. L√≥pez was born in January 1879 in Buenos Aires, Argentina to C√°ndido and Adriana W. L√≥pez. She began her teaching career and became Director of the Sarmiento Model School. In 1890, she founded the Liceo Nacional de Se√±oritas and thereafter served as its rector. In 1901, she earned the first doctorate degree issued to a woman in letters and philosophy from the University of Buenos Aires and in 1902 joined 31 other women including Petrona Eyle, Cecilia Grierson, , her sister Elvira L√≥pez, Anna Pintos, and Elvira Rawson de Dellepiane to form the Argentine Association of University Women ( (AMUA), as a means of addressing employment biases against women and female university graduates. The group actively worked to attain legal, civic and educational rights for women. In 1904 L√≥pez attended the St. Louis World's Fair exposition as Argentina's delegate for the National Council of Education. Beginning in 1908, the AMUA organized the First International Feminist Congress of Argentina (PCFIRA) () which ran from 18 to 23 May 1910. L√≥pez was not only an attendee, but she presented the opening lecture of the conference to the nearly 1,000 attendants. As outlined by L√≥pez, the goals of the Congress were to create a network women, beyond class and ideology, to support women's literacy and education, eliminate biases, work towards women's emancipation and free women from social and economic dependencies. In 1918, L√≥pez joined the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters of the University of Buenos Aires. Along with other prominent Socialists like Fenia Chertkoff and her sister Mariana Chertkoff, Alicia Moreau, Sara Justo, and Carolina Muzzilli, L√≥pez advocated for schools to encompass feminist issues in their curriculum. Specifically, she advocated for classes on hygiene, sex education, citizenship and the responsibilities of voting, as well as horticulture and gardening. She felt that craftswork, being done by large numbers of urban women was better produced in the provinces, as part of the labor force instead of domestic make-work. In addition to teaching, she designed course curricula and published textbooks which were widely used. By 1925, L√≥pez had married Ernesto Nelson, an educator and they later had one child, a daughter Alicia. In the 1930s, she helped Elina Gonz√°lez Acha de Correa Morales promote the Club de Madres, one of the most active Argentine women's organizations, and served as its president for many years. As President of the Club de Madres, L√≥pez became a member of the Argentine Government Commission of Child Welfare and worked with her husband on many social programs. When the governing body of the Pan American Union created the Inter-American Commission of Women at their meeting in Havana on 4 April 1928. The provision called for a commission composed of seven women from the countries of the Americas and that those women should review data and prepare information to allow the Seventh Pan American Conference to consider women's civil and political equality in the region. It also called for expansion of the commission to eventually have one delegate for each country in the Pan American Union. Doris Stevens, who had suggested the commission was appointed as chair and the other six countries were selected by lot. The chosen countries were Argentina, Colombia, El Salvador, Haiti, Panama, and Venezuela and the appointed delegates were Dr. Ernestina A. L√≥pez de Nelson from Argentina, Mar√≠a Elena de Hinestrosa from Colombia, Mar√≠a Alv√°rez de Guill√©n Rivas from El Salvador, Alice T√©ligny Mathon from Haiti, Clara Gonz√°lez from Panama and Lucila Luciani de P√©rez D√≠az from Venezuela.

The assassination played a major role in world events and moved things towards the breakout of World War I. As a historically-based work adapting the controversial period, moral conflicts and other character-driven issues are explored although many details have been changed. The stage play made its debut at the Schauspielhaus in Vienna in October 2013. It has received favorable reactions from crowds in a variety of different cities in which it has been performed, including Berlin and Belgrade. Srbljanoviƒá has remarked that she feels \\"not very much into history and utterly not interested in World War I\\" yet found Princip's story fascinating given the figure's challenging ethical and philosophical ideas. In October 2014, the play won two awards during the International Theatre Festival of Small and Experimental Stage (MESS) ceremony; one award went to Srbljanoviƒá herself and another went to Sarajevo-based actor Ermin Bravo, for best stage performance.

She was the subject of many of her father's photographs, particularly in her early years. They were exhibited and received praise for their wholesome sentiment. She graduated from Smith College before marrying Milton Sprague Stearns. After the birth of her son in 1923, she was institutionalized for depression and hallucinations and remained there until her death in 1971.  Early life  Alfred Stieglitz, Emmeline and Katherine, 1898 Katherine, or \\"Kitty\\", was born on September 27, 1898 to Emmeline and Alfred Stieglitz in Manhattan, New York. The family lived on Madison Avenue, between 83rd and 84th Streets, shortly after her birth. Using Emmy's inheritance, the couple hired a governess, cook and a chambermaid. Stieglitz worked at the same pace at The Camera Club of New York and on his own photography as before the birth of his daughter, and as a result, the couple predominantly lived separate lives under the same roof. Emmy, who hoped she would one day earn Stieglitz's love, continued giving him an allowance from her inheritance. Alfred captured a lot of photographs of his daughter when she was young, so much so that Emmy asked him to stop taking her photographs. He continued capturing her with different gestures and scenes, almost obsessively, until about 1902. Mother and daughter were also photographed by Clarence Hudson White and Gertrude K√§sebier. The family traveled to Europe in 1904, during which time Alfred was hospitalized in Berlin and Emmy and Kitty visited relatives in Stuttgart, Germany. The entire family was quite sick during their time in London, and before they were to depart for home. Their return was delayed three weeks until they recovered. In 1907, Alfred experimented with color photography and captured the well-dressed and long- haired girl in photographs with her holding on to flowers or plants, a common theme of Alfred's to see the female sex in one with nature. He exhibited the photographs of her in several exhibits, receiving praise from critics. Charles Henry Caffin said of his works, \\"When he sets his figures in a scene, they become part of it and one with it in spite. He puts them there because they belong to it. His sentiment, never degenerating into sentimentality, is always wholesome and sincere, and his pictures have the added charm of handsome arrangement and of simple and controlled impressiveness.\\" Her father took some pictures of her during her adolescence, but little after her teenage years. Katherine Stieglitz autochrome taken in 1910, when she was 12 years old Her mother and father were often parted, such as when Emmy traveled to Europe, and Kitty was left in her father's care. Alfred was quite formal with Kitty and spent little time with his wife and daughter, but they traveled as a family in 1911, with an active vacation through Europe. The Stieglitz family also spent summers at the family home at Lake George, which was visited often by family members. Education About 1917, Stieglitz began her studies at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. Early July 1918, her father drove her to camp and returned to the Stieglitz apartment in New York, where he took pictures of Georgia O'Keeffe, Emmy arrived home earlier than expected and found them together and threw Alfred out of the house. Kitty graduated from Smith College in 1921.  Marriage and pregnancy  Katherine married Milton Sprague Stearns, a Harvard University graduate, on June 22, 1922 in a Unitarian Church. The wedding was not attended by his parents and her father was not invited. Following the wedding, the Stearns lived in Allston, Massachusetts. One year after Sprague's marriage, their son Milton Sprague Stearns, Jr. was born on June 3, 1923. Postpartum depression and institutionalization  Katty, like her maternal grandmother, suffered from postpartum depression within days after the birth of her son, Milton Stearns, Jr. In 1923, Katty Stieglitz was treated for depression and hallucinations and was institutionalized at Craig House in Beacon, New York. Craig House was the first privately owned psychiatric hospital, a \\"stunning gothic mansion\\" with a gymnasium and a swimming pool that treated the wealthy. Led by Doctor Jonathan Slocum, it specialized in progressive treatment approaches, like \\"intense recreation\\" and talk therapy. In 1924, her parents divorced and within four months her father and O'Keeffe married in a small, private ceremony. Her husband died in 1957. In 1934 Zelda Fitzgerald was later also a patient at Craig House.  Death  After being institutionalized for 48 years, Katherine died in 1971. She was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Family  Milton Sprague Stearns, Jr. served in the United States Navy during World War II as a lieutenant and navigator. A graduate of Harvard University and Harvard Business School, he was a successful banker, leader in technology fields, and consultant over his career. He and his wife, Virginia had five children. He died in 2015 in Boynton Beach, Florida and was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The band originally hails from Birmingham, Alabama, but is currently based out of Nashville, Tennessee. Formed in 2010, Banditos toured the United States for four years before they signed to Bloodshot Records.  History  Banditos began in 2010 when singer/guitarist Corey Parsons and singer/banjo player Stephen Pierce starting playing acoustic music in Birmingham's local indie/rock scene. They busked around the city and were eventually invited to play a show at their favorite local saloon. They added Mary Beth Richardson on vocals and percussion, Randy Wade on drums, Danny Vines on bass, and Jeffery Salter playing lead guitar. Pierce's non-traditional banjo playing throughout their music adds to the honky-tonk and garage elements of their sound. Lead guitarist Salter, who grew up with Parsons and Vines in Hueytown, Alabama, is trained in jazz and classical guitar from University of Alabama at Birmingham and works as a luthier, building custom guitars as part of his company, Pyrose Wood Works. The band's name comes from the idea of a band of friends getting together. The band's name is not associated with the Bandidos Motorcycle Club, although Bandidos members have come to see the band play a few times. From their early days in Birmingham, the band lived together in the Crestwood neighborhood, writing songs together, and touring heavily. While on tour, the group found themselves constantly playing shows in Nashville, so after about two years in Birmingham, they decided to relocate to East Nashville. Over the next three years Banditos played over 600 shows, and in 2014, the group played South by Southwest, where they caught the eye of Bloodshot Records, and were signed to the label soon after. Marah Eakin of The A.V. Club says \\"The perfect soundtrack to a rowdy hang, the band blends traditional instruments like banjo and pedal steel with modern sensibilities, resulting in something that‚Äôs both uniquely now and uniquely American. In March 2015, Banditos played at Rachael Ray's 8th annual Feedback in Austin Banditos have played Scandinavia, winning a place in the competitive Sweden Rock Festival in S√∂lvesborg. = Banditos (2015) = On May 12, 2015, Banditos debuted their self-titled album that was produced by Andrija Tokic, whose work includes fellow southern rock artists Alabama Shakes and Hurray for the Riff Raff. The record was recorded almost all live, and was recorded at Tokic's the Bomb Shelter studio in Nashville. The initial record, made around 2013, was not officially released, was just sold on tour as merchandise, so the Banditos went back into the studio to rework much of the road-tested material, adding a bunch of new songs, which resulted in the official 2015 Bloodshot release. After the album was released, the band was featured in Taco Bell's Feed the Beat campaign, a program that helps feed touring musicians and allows fans to discover new bands. Banditos debuted their music video for \\"The Breeze\\" via Rolling Stone's website in the summer of 2015. Rolling Stone writer Andrew Leahey said the record is \\"Equal parts alt-country twang and garage rock bang, the album wears its influences proudly, recalling everything from ZZ Top's greasy boogie to the Alabama Shakes' coed soul.\\" NPR listed the song,\\"Waitin',\\" on its Favorite Songs of 2015. Banditos are working on their sophomore album follow-up, which will incorporate a psychedelic feel. It will be released in 2016.

From a Republican family ‚Äì her father was the chairman of the Amelia County Republican Party ‚Äì she attended Longwood College, graduating with a degree in English and Communications and a minor in business in 1947. She then attended the pharmacy school of the Medical College of Virginia before returning to Amelia and opening a pharmacy. She married local businessman Leander Scott, and had five children with him. Political career Scott first won election to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1971, running as an independent after her predecessor had suffered a stroke. She had six weeks to campaign, and won by 121 votes. She was reelected three times, serving a total of four two-year terms. Soon after her first victory redistricting based on the 1970 census happened. Scott and her family moved to Dinwiddie County, since her Amelia County residence was no longer within the district that had elected her. Scott once described herself as \\"a real conservative. Conservative first. Republican second.\\" She became noted during her time as a delegate for her belief in limited government and free enterprise, and expressed her opposition to abortion and the Equal Rights Amendment. Scott limited the amounts she would allow people to contribute to her campaigns, fearing that otherwise she might become indebted to those who gave her money and would compromise her beliefs. Over her three terms in the House, Scott served on a number of committees, including Militia and Police, Counties Cities and Towns, Labor and Commerce, and Roads and Internal Navigation.Legislative profile from the 1972 session of the Virginia House of DelegatesLegislative profile from the 1974 session of the Virginia House of DelegatesLegislative profile from the 1979 session of the Virginia House of Delegates Redistricted out of her House of Delegates district again, Scott chose to run for the Virginia State Senate in 1979.

Scott later stated that she was not aware of any discrimination while serving in the Senate, even if it was present. Following her retirement from elective office, Scott remained active in conservative causes and the local Republican Party. She also helped operate her family's lumber business. She stated that she felt obligated to continue her career in public service, as the electorate trusted her enough to elect her to office. She expressed support for the Tea Party movement. She was a Baptist. The Library of Virginia named Scott one of the Virginia Women in History in 2013. Death Scott died on March 28, 2019, aged 92.

Woody recorded six sides in the late 1950s with his song \\"Barking Up the Wrong Tree\\" receiving the largest amount of commercial success after being reissued 20 years following its initial distribution. Biography Woody was born in the small town of Tuscumbia, Missouri. He started a career as a disc jockey in junior high school, and had a comedy routine Woody performed at local clubs. Also during this time, Woody became an accomplished drummer in his high school band. After graduation, he attended Southwest Missouri State University where he took a position as a DJ for the campus's \\"Top 40\\" rock and roll radio station. While enrolled in college, Woody wrote a dozen songs with Paul Simmons which the two demoed. All the while, a producer for the television program Ozark Jubilee caught Woody's comedy routine at a night club, and invited him to present the warm-up session for the show. As a result of the show, Woody met Gary Walker, who became his manager, and showcased his demos to Decca Records. One song, \\"Bigelow 6-200\\", was recorded by Brenda Lee on September 16, 1956 for the B-side to her debut single. Record producer Paul Bradley enticed Woody to record his own sides at the Bradley Film and Recording Studio in Nashville, with session musician Grady Martin and the Slewfoot Five. He recorded four songs for Decca, but only \\"Bird Dog\\" and \\"Barking Up the Wrong Tree\\" were released in 1957 on a single. The release sold moderately well however Decca did not renew their recording contract with Woody, which left the other two songs unissued. With Walker producing, Woody established the independent record label, Arco Records, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania to release a followup in 1958. However, the label was too small to effectively promote the single and was a commercial failure. In 1961, Woody retired from the music industry, taking a job in retail management to financially support his wife and child. On April 9, 1976, MCA Records reissued \\"Barking Up the Wrong Tree\\" backed by \\"Peanuts\\" Wilson's \\"Cast Iron Arm\\". It received extensive airplay in the UK, especially on Capital Radio, and bubbled under the UK Singles Chart. Also in that year, the English band Matchbox covered Woody's unreleased track \\"Make Like Rock 'N' Roll\\" on their debut album Riders in the Sky. Woody's Decca recordings have been compiled on the compilation albums That'll Flat Git It! (volume two and six) as well as some European compilations. His Arco songs were released on the Eagles Records release The Chicken Are Rockin', Volume 2. In 2007 Woody returned to the stage for the first time in 45 years as a headliner at the \\"Viva Las Vegas\\" rockabilly festival in Las Vegas, Nevada. He has since then performed on several other occasions at that venue and at rockabilly festivals in Europe.

A lifelong resident of Radford, Virginia, she served in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1958 to 1961, becoming the first Republican woman elected to the House. Life and career Charlotte Milton Caldwell was born to Charles Minor Caldwell and his wife the former Ida Goodykoontz in Radford, Virginia. She graduated from Radford College, then known as the Women's Division of Virginia Polytechnic Institute, in 1925. On April 5, 1929 she married Arthur Rossa Giesen, and they would have a son and daughter who survived them. In 1954 Charlotte Giesen became the first woman elected to Radford's city council. Her husband, Arthur Giesen, was Radford's mayor and also served on the city council. Charlotte Giessen was for many years the women's page editor of the Radford News Journal and also edited the original Montgomery News Messenger. She served on the board of directors of both the Radford Child Care Center and the Radford chapter of the American Red Cross. She was also active in her Lutheran Church, the American Legion auxiliary and the local chapter of the American Farm Bureau. During the Massive Resistance crisis, voters elected Giesen in 1957 to the House of Delegates (a part-time position). She defeated incumbent Democrat John L. Whitehead, a member of the Byrd Organization who supported closing schools to prevent racial integration. Giesen represented Radford and the surrounding Montgomery County, and won re-election in 1959. Her platform, considered progressive for the day, included reinstating compulsory education, requiring polio vaccinations and the jailing of drunk drivers, and support for open government. Fellow delegate, Democrat Dorothy Shoemaker McDiarmid, characterized Giesen as \\"everyone's favorite aunt.\\"Cynthia A. Kierner and Sandra Gioia Treadway, Virginia Women: Their Lives and Times, vol. 2 (Athens, University of Georgia Press 2016), p. 341 Giesen served on four committees: Federal Relations, Immigration, Printing, and Public Property. In 1961 Giesen was defeated for reelection by Democrat Kenneth I. Devore, as schools had reopened, but many whites supported private segregated academies. Devore would likewise serve two terms, and receive more prestigious committee assignments (to General Laws, Roads, and House Expenses). Nonetheless, Charlotte Giesen continued her civic involvement. In 1962 she was reelected to the Radford City Council, on which she served until 1966. Giessen also served on the Board of Visitors of her alma mater from 1970 until 1978. Moreover, her son, Pete Giesen, who had become President of Augusta Steel Corporation, continued the family's Republican political tradition in 1963 by winning election to the Virginia House of Delegates from Augusta County and the cities of Staunton and Waynesboro. Although Augusta Steel closed, and he lost his initial campaign in 1961 and a re-election bid during the post-Watergate Democratic landslide, Pete Giesen would represent those cities and parts of Augusta County as well as all or parts of Bath, Highland and Rockingham Counties for more than three decades of elected public service (1964-1996). Theodore Roosevelt Dalton and his son, future governor John N. Dalton, were Giesen's next-door neighbors during her time as a delegate. Death and legacy Widowed, Giesen died at her home in Radford on January 28, 1995, survived by her son and daughter, and their families (which by then included thirteen grandchildren). She was buried in that city's West View Cemetery. During her lifetime, Giesen was voted Radford Woman of the Year by the Business and Professional Women's Association, and in 1960 the local chapter of the Veterans of Foreign Wars elected her Outstanding Woman of the Year.

It stars Danny Shayler, Abbie Salt, and Robert Curtis as three friends who become lost in the Rendlesham Forest and discover evidence of UFO activity, decades after the Rendlesham Forest incident. It premiered at the Colchester Film Festival on 22 October 2014 and was released in the UK on 9 February 2015. It is shot in the style of found footage.  Plot  A message indicates that the following amateur footage was recovered from a stolen laptop. Gus, a metal detector enthusiast, takes his girlfriend Sally and her videographer friend Jake with him to search for buried treasure in Suffolk, England. Gus discourages them from taking many supplies, as they will not be gone long. As Gus describes the various metal detector models and history behind the hobby, Jake expresses more interest in filming Sally. When they stop in a local pub, Jake flirts with Sally and asks if she is truly serious with Gus; she replies that she is. Jake points out a newspaper that describes the Rendlesham Forest incident and says that is why he is interested in exploring the area. As they drive to their first site, they see dead horses by the side of the road. Their initial searches come up empty, and the trio move on to a private property whose owner they had previously contacted. The owner is nowhere to be found when they arrive at his house. Undeterred, Gus insists they prospect on his land without permission. Jake agrees despite his misgivings, and the three wait until nightfall to begin. When Gus takes a nap, Sally and Jake discuss their history, and Jake teases her over a drunken kiss that she would rather forget. Gus later leaves a message for Jake on his camera in which he tells Jake that he is aware of Jake's crush on Sally. In the Rendlesham Forest, the three hear strange noises and encounter otherworldly lights. Gus, a skeptic, rejects paranormal explanations and suggests that it is local kids playing a prank. Sally and Jake counter that it could not have been controlled by humans. When Gus notices low-flying jets, he says that they saw experimental Ministry of Defence drones. When the others ask how he could know this, he admits that he has knowingly brought them onto MoD land illegally. Tensions are further heightened when their car disappears and they find a shack that contains surveillance pictures of them. Military aircraft continue to fly over them, and one helicopter crashes. Now concerned for their safety, the three begin panicking. Gus leads them via his GPS device, but they never encounter the road. Gus becomes sullen and quiet, and Jake takes them deeper into the forest, hoping to emerge from it after following a straight line. After another encounter with the strange lights, Jake and Sally lose Gus. Jake convinces her that they can best help Gus by bringing back a search party. Soon after, they encounter a road. Overjoyed, they follow it to a seemingly abandoned American Air Force base. As they explore it, they find evidence that it was involved in the 1980 UFO incident. In a hangar, Jake and Sally are surprised to see Gus on a surveillance camera and rush to find him. Following loud, unearthly noises from deeper within the hangar, they encounter a UFO as it prepares to lift off. As Jake yells incoherently at it, Sally explores an adjoining room, where she finds Gus' body amidst several others. Jake and Sally flee the base as the UFO rises, only to be confronted by several more UFOs outside the base, each of which is making the same unearthly noises. As Jake surveys the skies, Sally screams and collapses. Jake runs over to her as several helicopters fly around the UFOs. After checking her body, he tearfully apologises to her, climbs a hill, and raises his arms to the UFOs. He is bathed in a white light and disappears.  Cast  * Danny Shayler as Jake * Abbie Salt as Sally * Robert Curtis as Gus  Production  Production took place over three and a half years. Two years were spent filming on location in Rendlesham Forest.  Release  Hangar 10 premiered at the Colchester Film Festival on 22 October 2014. It was released in the US on 7 November 2014 and in the UK on 9 February 2015. It was released on DVD in the US on 1 September 2015.  Reception  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 14% based on 7 reviews, with an average rating of 3.69/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 28 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Kim Newman of Empire rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, \\"It has a few okay chills but treads a too familiar path.\\" Tom Huddleston of Time Out London rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, \\"But overall this is dull, derivative, murky stuff, full of running and shouting but never really going anywhere.\\" Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that it \\"misses nary a single clich√© in its visually disorienting and narratively confusing proceedings\\".

Alan Scherstuhl of The Village Voice wrote that the climax \\"is legitimately creepy and impressive once it finally comes\\", but criticised the film's use of the found footage gimmick, which he called ridiculous. Describing the film's similarity to The Blair Witch Project, Drew Hunt of Slant Magazine rated it 1.5/4 stars and wrote, \\"it's easy to see how Simpson's desire to return the found-footage genre to its roots resulted in cheap imitation\\". Matt Donato of We Got This Covered rated it 1.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"Hangar 10 is a horrifying endeavor for found footage fans and alien enthusiasts alike, but for all the wrong reasons.\\" Matt Boiselle of Dread Central rated it 1.5/5 stars and wrote that the UFO visuals were the only good part.

P.? messeliana is one of six Lutetian Pachycondyla species.  History and classification  When described Pachycondyla? messeliana was known from a single fossil insect which is a compression-impression fossil preserved in a layer of soft sedimentary rock. Along with other well preserved insect fossils, the P.? messeliana specimen was collected from layers of the Lutetian Messel pit World Heritage Site. The formation is composed of brown coals, oil shales, and bituminous shale, which preserved numerous insects, fish, birds, reptiles, and terrestrial mammals as a notable lagerst√§tten. The area is a preserved maar lake which initially formed approximately 47 million years ago as the result of volcanic explosions. At the time of description, the holotype specimen, number SMF MeI 4744, was preserved in the Senckenberg Research Station Messel fossil collections. The fossil was described by Gennady Dlussky and Sonja Wedmann in a 2012 paper on the poneromorph ants of Messel. The specific epithet \\"messeliana\\" was coined in recognition of the type locality for the species. Due to the nature of the fossil, many of the important features used to distinguish the genus placement of an ant are obscured or not preserved at all. This leave the placement of the species as uncertain until better fossils are described. The helcium, a small plate in between the petiole and gaster, is visible low on the first gastral segment, which removes Amblyoponinae or Ectatomminae for possible placement of the species. Based on the size of the head capsule, the genus Cyrtopone is not an option, and the petiole structure is different from that seen in Protopone, Cephalopone or Messelepone, leaving the species as part of Pachycondyla or an undescribed genus. Since the condition of the fossil does not show enough other detail, it was placed into Pachycondyla by Dlussky & Wedmann. The species is one of six Pachycondyla species which have been described from Messel Formation fossils. All six of the species were described by Dlussky and Wedmann in the same 2012 paper, the other five being P. eocenica, P. lutzi, P. parvula, P. petiolosa, and P. petrosa. Another eight fossil species have been described from fossils in North America, Europe, and Asia. Description The Pachycondyla? messeliana queen has a body length of approximately and the massive head is , while the alitrunk is . The antennae scape extends towards the rear margin of the head but does not extend past it. The front section of the mesonotum, the scutum, has an outline that is convex, and the petiole scale is tapered upwards. Both front and back sides of the scale are slightly convex, while top is a rounded point.

The second of his \\"humoristic\\" keyboard suites (1912-1915), it set the tone for the rest of the series by introducing elements of musical parody, and in the increasingly important role played by the verbal commentary.Rollo H. Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", Dover Publications, Inc., NY, 1968, p. 78. Originally published in 1948 by Denis Dobson Ltd., London. In performance it lasts about 4 minutes. Background Erik Satie On April 5, 1913, pianist Ricardo Vi√±es successfully premiered Satie's first humoristic suite, the Veritables Preludes flasques (pour un chien), at the Salle Pleyel in Paris. The composer used the occasion to publish an advertisement announcing his future creative plans in that day's issue of the periodical Le Guide du concert. Anticipating further attacks from his critics, he adopted a high-handed tone: :\\"The V√©ritables pr√©ludes flasques...opens a series of pianistic works: Descriptions :automatiques, Embryons dess√©ch√©s, Chapitres tourn√©s en tous sens and Vieux sequins et vieilles cuirasses.Satie did not entirely adhere to this scheme. The unannounced suite Croquis et agaceries d'un gros bonhomme en bois was begun in June 1913 and intermittently worked on throughout the summer. In them I devote myself to the sweet joys of fantasy. Those who will not understand are requested by me to observe the most respectful silence and to show an attitude of complete submission and inferiority. That is their true role.\\"Quoted in Ann-Marie Hanlon, \\"Satie and the Meaning of the Comic\\". Published as Chapter 2 in Dr Caroline Potter (ed.), \\"Erik Satie: Music, Art and Literature\\", Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2013, pp. 19-48. This sardonic blurb shows how Satie often invented the curious titles and texts of his compositions before the music was written,Robert Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 307. though these were subject to change depending on where his inspiration took him. The Descriptions automatiques had already gone through two working titles (Descriptions hypocrites and Vocations √©lectriques) before the April 5 announcement,Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 298. while the music would not be composed until April 21‚Äì26, 1913. Satie's sketches also show how the first piece (Sur un vaisseau) initially described a wolf and a tuna fish before evolving into a description of a ship.Olof H√∂jer, notes to Erik Satie: Complete Piano Music, Vol. 5, Swedish Society Discofil, 1996, p. 13. Ricardo Vi√±es gave the first performance of the Descriptions automatiques at the Salle √ârard in Paris on June 5, 1913. It was published by the firm E. Demets that same year. Satie enthused that Vi√±es played the suite \\"with an irresistibly droll air of secrecy\\",Erik Satie, autobiographical blurb for publisher E. Demets' Bulletin des Editions musicales, December 1913. Quoted in Nigel Wilkins, \\"The Writings of Erik Satie\\", Eulenburg Books, London, 1980, p. 79. a comment that may hold a key to the interpretation of his humoristic keyboard works.H√∂jer, \\"Erik Satie\\" notes, p. 13. Satie disciple (and Vi√±es' most famous student) Francis Poulenc believed as much, bluntly stating that to perform this music authentically \\"it is forbidden...to wink at the audience.\\"Francis Poulenc, \\"Erik Satie's Piano Music\\", La Revue Musicale, No. 214, June 1952, pp. 23-26. Reprinted in Nicolas Southon, \\"Francis Poulenc: Articles and Interviews: Notes from the Heart\\", Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2014, pp. 51-53. Satie and musical parody The Descriptions automatiques inaugurated Satie's use of evocative fragments of popular music as an important element of his mature compositional style. A possible trigger for this development was the 1912 publication of his Pi√®ces froides,http://imslp.org/wiki/Pi%C3%A8ces_froides_(Satie,_Erik) composed 15 years earlier, which would have reacquainted him with his first, isolated attempt at purely musical parody. In the intervening years he had eked out a living in part as an arranger and accompanist for cabaret star Vincent Hyspa (1865-1938), a sort of Parisian \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic of his time who wrote and sang satirical lyrics to well-known tunes. Biographer Steven Moore Whiting maintains that Hyspa had a decisive influence on Satie as a musical humorist.Steven Moore Whiting, \\"Erik Satie and Vincent Hyspa: Notes on a Collaboration\\", Music & Letters, Vol. 77, No. 1 (Feb. 1996), pp. 64-91. Satie professed to hate his cabaret work, claiming \\"it is more stupid and dirty than anything\\",Erik Satie, letter to Conrad Satie dated January 17, 1911. Cited in Mary E. Davis, \\"Erik Satie\\", Reaktion Books, 2007, p. 73. but beginning with the Descriptions automatiques he apparently found in it a means to move beyond the academic influences of his studies at the Schola Cantorum (1905-1912), which were still evident in the V√©ritables pr√©ludes flasques. The old Pi√®ces froides parody, a clever reworking of the 18th century Northumbrian folk tune The Keel Row, could have provided Satie with a template on how to achieve this in a concert hall setting, enabling him to indulge his eccentric wit while chuckling over the serious pretensions of classical music - \\"music to be listened to with one's head in one's hands,\\" as Satie's future propagandist Jean Cocteau would characterize it.Quoted in John Simon: \\"John Simon on Music: Criticism, 1979-2005\\", Hal Leonard Corporation, 2005, p. 392. Satie would borrow from popular sources for comic effect in a number of his compositions, though never more extensively than in the years 1913-1914, the most prolific of his career. Robert Orledge listed the practical reasons for this: \\"First, they helped him to sustain the unaccustomed bout of creativity that followed the sudden demand for novel groups of piano pieces from his publisher Demets. Second, they gave these humorous piano pieces greater popular appeal. Third, guessing their sources provided a sort of musical quiz that helped sustain public interest after their initial vogue had faded: the way Satie succeeded in this respect can be seen from the number of editions these pieces enjoyed in subsequent years. Lastly, popular sources helped Satie rediscover his path forward by taking some of the responsibility for inventing original material from his shoulders.\\"Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 204. A hindrance to the full appreciation of Satie's parodistic music lies in its ephemerality. In his Allmusic review of the Descriptions automatiques Alexander Carpenter noted that \\"although these little pieces stand on their own as charming examples of Satie the humorist, musicologists have rightly pointed out that Satie's works in this vein, like those of Ives, are self-limiting in terms of accessibility by the fact of their use of borrowed material. Street songs and children's rhymes that would have struck a chord and conveyed a multiplicity of meanings to a Parisian audience in 1913 say little to twenty-first century ears.\\"Alexander Carpenter Allmusic review at http://www.allmusic.com/composition/descriptions-automatiques-for-piano- mc0002358147 Music and texts The Descriptions automatiques consists of three pieces marked Assez lent (Rather Slow), Lent (Slow), and Pas acc√©l√©r√© (Do Not Accelerate). 1\\\\. Sur un vaisseau (On a Ship) :Dedicated to Madame Fernand DreyfusThe mother of Satie's first prot√©g√©, the young composer and critic Alexis Roland-Manuel. The first Description opens with a gentle tango- like ostinato that flows throughout the piece, above which float a succession of short motifs. It does not sound particularly \\"nautical\\", although Satie's playful directions to the pianist advise otherwise (\\"On the Seven Seas\\", \\"A little spray\\", \\"The Captain says have a very nice trip\\").All of Satie's extramusical texts quoted in this article are English translations from the original 1913 score available at http://imslp.org/wiki/Descriptions_automatiques_(Satie,_Erik) Thus it comes as a surprise to the knowledgeable listener when at the midpoint - where the annotation reads \\"The ship chuckles\\" - Satie quotes the music of a French children's song that begins with the lyric, \\"Maman, les p' tits bateaux qui vont sur l'eau ont-ils des jambes?\\" (\\"Mama, do the little boats on the water have legs?\\"). The joke seems to arise naturally from the preceding material, and just as discreetly slips away. 2\\\\. Sur une lanterne (On a Street Lamp) :For Madame Joseph RavelMarie Ravel, mother of composer Maurice Ravel. A nocturne in all but designation, this little night piece is built on the refrain of the French revolutionary song La Carmagnole (\\"Let's dance the Carmagnole\\"), which is transposed and fragmented over a tiptoeing pianissimo two-chord rhythm. Satie actually derived his title from another revolutionary tune, √áa Ira,Robert Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 202. with its call to hang the ruling classes from the street lamps (\\"Les aristocrats √† la lanterne!\\"); it was frequently sung in conjunction with La Carmagnole during the Reign of Terror.Belva Jean Hare, \\"The Uses and Aesthetics of Musical Borrowing in Erik Satie‚Äôs Humoristic Piano Suites, 1913-1917\\", University of Texas at Austin, December 2005, p. 113, at https://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2005/hareb78915/hareb78915.pdf The violence implied by these sources is barely hinted at in the music (to be played nocturnement), or in the extramusical texts for the pianist which suggest a child speaking to a lamplighter going about his duties.Steven Moore Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian: From Cabaret to Concert Hall\\", Clarendon Press, 1999, pp. 364-365. Biographer Pierre-Daniel Templier found in Sur une lanterne \\"a new form of mysticism in Satie - a kind of elusive mystery, subtly evoked in a musical atmosphere which is partly poetic, partly amused, but very moving.\\"Pierre-Daniel Templier, \\"Erik Satie\\", MIT Press, 1969, pp. 82-83. Translated from the original French edition published by Rieder, Paris, 1932. 3\\\\. Sur un casque (On a Helmet) :For Madame Paulette DartyDarty was the former cabaret star who introduced Satie's hit songs Je te veux (1903) and La Diva de l'Empire (1904). Their friendship lasted until Satie's death. The third Description is a straightforward spoof of martial music, imitating bugle calls and drum rolls in the deepest registers of the piano. Satie's annotations are excited observations of a military parade: \\"Here they come...How many people are there...Look, the drummers!...And here comes the handsome colonel, all alone.\\" He wraps up by commanding the pianist to play \\"As light as an egg\\", clearly a private joke for the performer, as the section it connotes is to be rendered fortissimo with a crescendo.Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", pp. 364-365. Given the piece's dedication to Paulette Darty, a former cabaret star and Satie's longtime friend, he probably had a music hall-style parody march in mind. Satie and Schoenberg Arnold Schoenberg helped introduce Satie's music to Vienna and Prague, including the Descriptions automatiques After World War I, some of the earliest performances of Satie's music in Central Europe were promoted by Arnold Schoenberg. On January 30, 1920, three Satie piano suites from 1913 - the Descriptions automatiques, Chapitres tourn√©s en tous sens and Vieux sequins et vieilles cuirasses - were programmed at an event sponsored by Schoenberg's Society for Private Musical Performances in Vienna.Albrecht D√ºmling, \\"Der junge Sch√∂nberg und die Arbeiters√§ngerbewegung\\", √ñsterreichische Musikzeitschrift, JG. 36/2, February 1981, pp. 88-90, 95-96. The pianist was Eduard Steuermann. They stirred enough interest to be repeated at four additional Society concerts through 1921, including one at the Mozarteum in Prague on March 8, 1920. Steuermann performed on all but one of these occasions (June 17, 1920), when the pianist was Ernst Bachrich.Schoenberg's Society gave the Satie suites on January 30, February 6, March 8, and June 17, 1920, and on June 6, 1921. See D√ºmling, \\"Der junge Sch√∂nberg und die Arbeiters√§ngerbewegung\\", pp. 88-90, 95-96. Schoenberg's advocacy reflected the altruistic aims he had for his short-lived Society, which folded in 1922. Most of his followers in the Second Viennese School regarded Satie as a trivial farceur.Austin Clarkson, \\"On the Music of Stefan Wolpe: Essays and Recollections\\", Pendragon Press, 2003 p. 141. For his part Satie ventured no public opinion about Schoenberg as a composer, but in 1921 - when anti-Germanic sentiment was still a factor in France's postwar music scene - he defended his Austrian colleague as a matter of principle: \\"We know that Art has no homeland...poor thing...its lack of fortune prevents it...So why not play Richard Strauss and Schoenberg?\\"Erik Satie, untitled item in Esprit Nouveau, 1921. Quoted in Nigel Wilkins, \\"The Writings of Erik Satie\\", Eulenburg Books, London, 1980, p. 68.

Roberts (born 1957) is an American pharmaceutical executive, philanthropist, and political activist. Biography Born in a secular Jewish family Philadelphia in 1957 and raised in Abington Township, Pennsylvania, the son of Albert Roberts. His father, a chemist, started URL Pharma in 1946 which manufactured steroidal hormones that treated pain by collecting pig pituitary glands from slaughterhouses. Roberts earned a M.D. and a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. After school, he took over his father‚Äôs money- losing pharmaceutical company. In 1997, he sold majority control of the firm to several venture capital firms which left him as the CEO of the company with a ~30% ownership interest. In 2009, the FDA approved colchicine as a monotherapy for the treatment of three different indications (familial Mediterranean fever, acute gout flares, and for the prophylaxis of gout flares) and gave URL Pharma a three-year marketing exclusivity agreement in exchange for URL Pharma doing 17 new studies and investing $100 million into the product (of which $45 million went to the FDA for the application fee). URL Pharma subsequently raised the price from $0.09 per tablet to $4.85; and in October 2010, the FDA removed the older unapproved colchicine (in both in oral and intravenous forms) from the market (although they allowed pharmacies the opportunity to buy up the older unapproved colchicine). Roberts indicated that the price increase mirrored other approved and branded drugs that were used to treat gout pain. URL Pharma returned to profitability with its gout treatment branded Colcrys consisting of 72% of the companies $600 million in sales in 2011. Roberts sold URL Pharma for $800 million in June 2012 to Takeda Pharmaceuticals of Japan.

Walker played football at Stephen F. Austin University; once his stint there concluded, he signed with the AFL's Charlotte Rage. Walker played for a succession of AFL teams over his ten- season career; these included the Orlando Predators, Arizona Rattlers, Indiana Firebirds, Chicago Rush, Austin Wranglers, and Las Vegas Gladiators. At the end of his AFL Career, Walker had amassed some 522 solo tackles (614 total); this was (at the time) the league's seventh-highest total. Walker also won one ArenaBowl as a player; this came with the Arizona Rattlers in 1997. Walker took up a career in coaching following his retirement as a player. He began as the defensive coordinator for the Bakersfield Blitz of the AF2 in 2006; following a successful stint there (the Blitz allowed the second-fewest points of any AF2 team that season), Walker became head coach of the AF2's Everett Hawks. In Walker's first season at the helm, the Hawks posted a pedestrian 8‚Äì8 record; they made the playoffs, however, behind the league's third-ranked defense. In 2008, Walker became head coach of the AF2's Tri-Cities Fever; his stint there, however, proved unsuccessful (the Fever went 4-12 in 2008). Walker was fired by the team at the end of the season. He was hired by the AF2's Green Bay Blizzard in 2009 as a defensive coordinator, to mixed results; while the Blizzard were average in most defensive categories, they lead the AF2 in sacks. Walker's coaching career received a huge boost in 2010. That year, he was hired by the Milwaukee Iron of the Arena Football League as a defensive coordinator. The Iron allowed 903 points in Walker's first year (the eleventh-highest mark in the 14-team league); despite this, the team's defense finished second in sacks (25.5) and fourth in interceptions (20). In 2011, Walker's second year as defensive coordinator, the team's defense made major strides; notably, it allowed the fewest yards (266.8 per game) and fourth- fewest points (872) of any AFL defense that season. Walker was hired to be the defensive coordinator of the AFL's San Jose SaberCats prior to the AFL's 2012 season. In San Jose, Walker inherited a defense that had allowed 1080 points the season before; this was the third-worst total in the 18-team league. Under Walker's guidance, the SaberCats' defense became the league's most dominant. In 2012, the SaberCats allowed 1027 points (a 53-point improvement over 2011). The defense was aided, in part, by the additions of Joe Sykes and Jason Stewart to the defensive line. Sykes recorded 16.0 sacks in 2012 (a record that stood until 2015, when Sykes himself broke it with 18.5); for this, he was named the league's Defensive Player of the Year. In 2013, Walker's second year, the SaberCats allowed only 877 points (a staggering 150-point improvement over 2012). In two years, Walker had turned the AFL's third-worst unit (by points allowed) into its second best. The unit was led by the return of defensive back Clevan Thomas, who had been elected to the AFL's Hall of Fame one year prior. Thomas led the league with fifteen interceptions (six of which were returned for touchdowns); he joined Sykes as the SaberCats' second consecutive Defensive Player of the Year. In 2014, the SaberCats' defense established itself as the league's best. The team allowed only 723 points all season (a 154-point improvement over 2013) while holding eleven of its eighteen opponents to fewer than 40 points. This was the league's lowest total by 55 points. For the third consecutive year, a SaberCats defender won the league's Defensive Player of the Year Award; this year's recipient was Jason Stewart, who led the Cats' vaunted defensive line with 12.5 sacks. In Walker's fourth year, the SaberCats' defense performed historically well. Despite injuries to the team's secondary (particularly the losses of Virgil Gray and Eric Crocker to injury), the SaberCats allowed a staggeringly-low 662 points (a 61-point improvement over 2014's league-best figure). This was the league's best total by 161 points. All told, the 2015 SaberCats allowed only 36.8 points per game; this represented the league's lowest per-game total in well over twenty years.

In the same year, she was also named as a WIRED #maketechhuman Agent of Change. Forbes included Hoke in its 2017 40 Women to Watch Over 40 list. In 2018, Hoke released her book A Second Chance: For You, For Me and For the Rest of Us (published by Seth Godin with a foreword written by Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook). In 2009, Hoke resigned as CEO from the Prison Entrepreneurship Program after admitting to sexual relationships with formerly incarcerated students. In 2018, she resigned as CEO from Defy Ventures, also launched by Hoke, after further allegations of sexual harassment.  Background  = Early life = Cat was born in Montreal, Canada. Her Hungarian-Yugoslavian father, immigrated there when he was 22, and he became a successful inventor. As young as age seven, Cat began inventing solutions and proposing business models to her father, an engineer hired by Stanford University. From a young age, she says that she was consistently thinking about ways to give back to the underserved. After graduating from the University of California, Hoke was hired by Summit Partners, a venture capital firm, and several years later became the Director of Investment Development at American Securities Capital Partners in New York City. Hoke found early success and grew in her role on an investment team as she mastered how to identify promising entrepreneurs. = Prison Entrepreneurship Program = In 2004, Catherine Hoke (previously Catherine Rohr) toured several Texas prisons and discovered that many of the incarcerated men she met possessed strong business acumen, sales skills, and entrepreneurial qualities. She also found that many gangs and drug rings are run similarly to corporations ‚Äîwith bylaws, bookkeeping functions, marketing strategies, and quality control programs. Following this realization, Hoke recruited executive volunteers and conducted a business 101 seminar. Four months later, Hoke ran her first-ever business pitch competition, which was covered by the Wall Street Journal. Hoke turned these efforts into the Prison Entrepreneurship Program (PEP), an organization that she grew statewide in Texas, teaching entrepreneurship and character development to incarcerated men. PEP was nationally recognized for the organization's positive impact under Hoke's leadership. In 2007, Hoke received the Texas Governor's Award for Criminal Justice Volunteer Service for Social Innovation. In 2007, Hoke also received the Manhattan Institute's Social Entrepreneurship Award. In 2008, Hoke was inducted into the Philanthropy World Hall of Fame, and PEP received the ‚ÄúRising Star‚Äù award from the Monitor Group/Fast Company Social Capitalist Awards. PEP also ranked as a finalist in contests for the Peter F. Drucker Award for Nonprofit Innovation and the Ashoka Changemakers award. In 2009, Hoke was banned from Texas prisons after she admitted to having sexual relationships with PEP participants after their release from prison. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice deemed those relationships inappropriate. = Defy Ventures = After being forced out from PEP in October 2010, Hoke founded Defy Ventures in New York City. Defy's vision is \\"To end mass incarceration and cycles of recidivism by using entrepreneurship as a tool to transform legacies and human potential.‚Äù Defy took on solving the issue of high recidivism rates through entrepreneurship programs that taught incarcerated participants a comprehensive business skill-set through comprehensive curriculum. Defy Ventures was featured in The New Yorker, The New York Times, Inc. Magazine, Harvard Business Review, The Wall Street Journal, The Huffington Post, The Christian Science Monitor, and Forbes.com. A Second Chance: For You, For Me, and For the Rest of Us Hoke released her book, A Second Chance: For You, For Me and For the Rest of Us in early 2018. The book follows Hoke's personal journey and tells the story about how she came to serve incarcerated people. The book was published by Hoke's mentor, Seth Godin. Sexual Harassment Allegations In January 2018, a number of allegations against Hoke and Defy Ventures were made by a former employee. The allegations included sexual harassment, having a sexual relationship with a formerly incarcerated participant, misleading donors, exaggerating the success of the program, and not accurately tracking outcomes of former program participants. https://www.thedailybeast.com/silicon-valleys-favorite-prison-reformer- accused-of-sexual-assault-and-harassment References External links * Ashoka Fellow Category:Living people Category:Social entrepreneurs Category:Women company founders Category:American company founders Category:Founders of charities Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:American women chief executives Category:American nonprofit chief executives ","title":"Catherine Hoke"},{"id":"47753353","text":"Elysia grandifolia is a species of sea slug, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Plakobranchidae native to the waters off southern India and Sri Lanka. It has colonised the waters of the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Taxonomy Edward Frederick Kelaart described the species in 1858 as Elysia grandifolia. He was unsure of its placement within the genus, and considered the new genus name Hydropsyche as an alternative. Kelaart was a military surgeon who became interested in marine life after seeing an aquarium in London, and set about describing nudibranchs off the waters of Ceylon (Sri Lanka), where he was stationed.Bouchet, P.

The head and neck are bare, apart from bearing two tentacles folded along the sides of the head. The body is wider at the front and tapers to a point at the rear, and lacks a distinct foot. The mouth lies underneath. Running along the length of the body on each side is a veiny green wing-like membrane‚Äîknown as a parapodium‚Äîwith black and gold margin. Laterally it can measure 6.35 cm (2.5 in) across with wings expanded.

Many publications refer to her as \\"Mrs F.C. Laskey.\\" Early life and education Laskey was born Amelia Rudolph to German immigrant parents, Susan and Frank Rudolph, in Bloomington, Indiana. She attended school in Chicago through high school. She then became a stenographer at the Oliver Typewriter Company before her marriage. She also taught girls at the Sunday school of the Ogden Park Methodist Church. She married Fredrick C. Laskey in 1911 and moved to Nashville where Fredrick was a manager at the Swift and Company. Amateur research Laskey's research career began when she moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1921. She began to participate in a gardening club, having an expansive garden at her home that she called Blossomdell, and a literary society. She began her studies in ornithology when she joined the Tennessee Ornithological Society in 1928. Her research began with the migratory behavior of chimney swifts, cowbirds, and mockingbirds, and discovered that chimney swifts wintered in Peru. Laskey also studied bluebird nesting behavior and was the first to note a Gambel's sparrow in Tennessee. She was particularly noted for her study of mockingbird behavior; Laskey noted the species' song development, mating behavior and number of mates, egg clutch sizes, and territory defense. She also discovered that brown-headed cowbirds were monogamous. She kept a mockingbird named Honey child at home for 15 years and she made careful studies of behaviour including song acquisition. Other birds she took care of included a crippled red-tailed hawk which lived with her for ten years and an albino great horned owl that she kept for 22 years. She began bird banding in 1931 and became a very careful and prolific bander. She also contributed to Lowery and Newman's study of nocturnal bird migration through the observation of flocks crossing the disc of the moon. She was also a pioneer researcher of migratory bird casualties at television towers. She was made a Fellow of the American Ornithologists' Union in 1966 although she was a member from 1933. She also collaborated with other ornithologists including Margaret Morse Nice and Josselyn Van Tyne. Her publications spanned 40 years, from 1933 to 1973, the year of her death, and included over 150 papers in ornithological journals. Laskey was also known for her rehabilitation of wounded birds.

Description Bidyanus welchi has an elongate, oblong to ovate, slender, slightly compressed body. The back and underparts have evenly arched profiles with the dorsal profile being straight from the snout to the back of the head and it then becomes convex from there tp the start of the dorsal fin. The profile of the lower edge of the body is evenly arched to pelvic fin and is the then straight as far as the anus. The dorsal fin is continuous with the spiny part arched and containing 12 spines, the first of which is the shortest and the 5th or 6th being the longest the they decrease in height until the last one which is still longer than the longest dorsal soft rays. There are 11‚Äì12 soft rays in the posterior part of the dorsal fin. The anal fin has three spines and eight to nine soft rays. The caudal fine is emarginate. The overall colour of the body is yellowish or brownish darkening dorsally. The colour on the body is dusky, with every scale having a spot of darker colour along its edge and on the caudal peduncle, these spots sometimes coalesce to create irregular, horizontal, fine bars. The fins on the body have a dusky membrane. The caudal fin is dusky at its base and the pelvic fins have a slight dusky colour while the pectoral fins are colourless. The maximum standard length is although the common standard length is . Distribution Bidyanus welchi is endemic to Australia where it occurs in some internal drainage basins in central Australia; these include the Barcoo River, Diamantina River and Georgina River in Queensland and in the Lake Eyre drainage system in South Australia. Habitat and biology Bidyanus welchi are found in turbid water in slow flowing rivers and waterholes. They can tolerate high salinities and high temperatures. It is a carnivorous species which preys on smaller fishes as well as crustacea and worms. Spawning takes place in the summer when the watercourses it inhabits flood. The eggs are pelagic and are laid upstream after the fish migrate there, they hatch after around 30 hours. The male guards and fans the eggs. They attain sexual maturity when they reach a length of about . A female of length may lay up to 100,000 eggs. Fisheries Bidyanus welchi is one of the few good species for angling found in the arid interior of the Australia. This makes it prone to illegal fishing. At least in Queensland there are bag limits in place. Taxonomy and etymology Bidyanus welchi was first formally described in 1917 as Therapon welchi by Allan Riverstone McCulloch and Edgar Ravenswood Waite. Gilbert Percy Whitley named the genus Bidyanus in 1943 and used a local aborignal word bidyan which means \\"fish\\". The specific name honours the explorer Edwin Welch (1838-1916).

Fraser was considered by many to be one of the best stock car racers in Canada. Racing career =Early career= Fraser made his racing debut in the street stock division at Onslow Speedway in Truro, Nova Scotia at the age of 16, setting the record for wins in a season. He ran off and on at Onslow for the next four seasons. In 1992 he moved on to the Open-Wheel Modified division at Scotia Speedworld in Enfield, Nova Scotia. In his rookie season he won the series championship. Between 1993 and 1994 Fraser ran three American Canadian Tour races, scoring top fives in all three races, including a win at Scotia Speedworld. =MASCAR= Fraser made his MASCAR debut at the 1991 Moosehead Grand Prix. Fraser was running up front in the event after starting third in the MASCAR Division before being forced out of the race with transmission issues. The next season, he entered the race for the second straight year, this time finishing 2nd. From 1994 to 1998 Fraser won five straight Riverside 250's at Riverside International Speedway, setting a race record for both most wins and for consecutive wins. In 1996 Fraser had what was arguably the best season in the history of Maritime racing, winning 12 of 15 races, including 9 straight, cruising to his first MASCAR championship. He led 58.9% of the total laps run in the 1996 season. The next season Fraser ran a limited MASCAR schedule, winning four of the six races he entered. Fraser returned to the series full-time in 1998, putting up an average finish of 2.7, while winning 6 of 13 races on his way to his second career MASCAR championship. =King Racing= At the end of the 1998 season Fraser decided to partner with Rollie MacDonald forming King Racing. Scott drove the car, while Rollie served as team owner and car chief. In February 1999 the team entered the World Series of Asphalt Stock Car Racing at New Smyrna Speedway in New Smyrna, Florida. The World Series of Asphalt Stock Car Racing consisted of ten straight nights of races. Fraser set the fast time in five and won two of the ten main events, finishing third in the overall points standings. The team also entered the 1999 New Hampshire 100 NASCAR Busch North Series race at New Hampshire International Speedway. Fraser finished the race 43rd after experience brake failure on lap 33. The pair returned to Nova Scotia to regroup, and decided to enter the upstart International Pro Stock Challenge (IPSC), winning the six- race championship. ASA National Tour In 1999 Fraser and MacDonald put together an American Speed Association (ASA) team in just six months, and had a car ready to run a partial schedule for the 2000 National Tour season. The team started out strong, starting on the outside pole at Chicago Motor Speedway. Fraser led for 19 laps on his way to an 8th-place finish. They recorded four top tens and two top fives in their first four starts in the series, including a career best 3rd-place finish at the Milwaukee Mile in August. They raced two more times in 2000, finishing 11th at Indianapolis Raceway Park and 33rd at Gateway Motorsports Park, where the team suffered their first DNF due to a faulty wheel bearing. With their initial success the team decided to go full-time in 2001. The season started out great, with three top five finishes in their first four starts. Unfortunately the wheels fell off the campaign after that. Starting at Concord Speedway a series of five straight DNF's, including three crashes damaged their only car beyond the point where it could be repaired on the road. The final nail in the coffin came in an accident at Chicago Motor Speedway, the track Fraser made his impressive debut. The team returned to Nova Scotia dejected and out of money. Soon after a friend of Fraser's started the \\"Fans of Fraser\\" campaign to raise money to get the team back onto the racetrack. In total they raised more than $40,000, selling lap sponsorships at $100 a piece. This included help from NASCAR legend Buddy Baker, who was a big fan of Fraser. They were able to compete in two more races under the \\"Fans of Fraser\\" sponsorship, finishing 32nd at Memphis Motorsports Park, and 37th at Indianapolis Raceway Park, exiting both races early with rear end problems. Maritime Pro Stock Tour Fraser and King Racing entered the Maritime Pro Stock Tour full-time in 2003 with the intention of racing for the championship. Fraser won two of the 11 races on the schedule, finishing third in the final point standings. Car ownership Before teaming with Rollie MacDonald following the 1998 season Fraser primarily raced cars coming out of his own shop. He learned how to build and work on race cars from Canadian racing legend Junior Hanley as well as his father Frank. In 1996 four of the top ten cars in the MASCAR championship standings came out of the Scott Fraser racing shop. Following his death in 2004, Scott Fraser Racing continued on with Frank now running the team.

ISSN 1542-0337 Contribution to medical imaging Sochurek left Life in 1970 after two decades to work as a freelancer. On assignment for Life, Sochurek had been told to investigate advances in medical imaging. Seeing an opportunity, he secured a computer from NASA that had been used to produce images from the transmissions of spy and weather satellites, becoming one of the first photographers to use computers to image, enhance and colourise X-ray and CT scans. His reputation among medical circles grew, and many doctors and pharmaceutical and other medical companies used his photographs in textbooks and advertisements.‚ÄòAt the same time that Life was publishing [Lennart] Nilsson, National Geographic was fostering the parallel career of the American photojournalist Howard Sochurek. A battlefield photographer in the Pacific during World War II, Sochurek developed an interest in medical photography and technical computer image processing in the 1980s. National Geographic‚Äôs January 1987 issue features Sochurek's photographic essay in which, using himself as a subject, he discovered that the CT scanner had revealed glitch in his own system. The picture was a false alarm, though, and Sochurek continued experiencing and photographing images in every imaging mode.

The song was written by members Amy Heidemann and Nick Noonan, and was produced by band member Nick Noonan. Background In an e-mail sent to their subscribers, Karmin announced that \\"Didn't Know You\\" was the first single from their debut album Leo Rising, although after the official track listing was released it was mentioned that there was a relisting of the album's songs to include \\"Along the Road\\", a single released previously to \\"Didn't Know You\\". \\"Didn't Know You\\" is the Gemini song from Leo Rising, each song from Leo Rising has a matching zodiac sign. In a statement to Billboard, Karmin said \\"The Gemini track is a story of betrayal, we wanted the listener to feel the passion and energy in the story, so we built it on a driving bass line with a syncopated drum groove which opens up to a full rhythm section of aggressive, pissed-off drummers.\\" Promotion Karmin released an acoustic version of \\"Didn't Know You\\" onto the Karmin app for free in early September, later posting a video of the performance on their Facebook page.

The official music video, directed by Stewart Yost of The Picture Council was released on July 16, 2015. The music video, set in an 1850s western style starts off with a bounty hunter picking up binoculars to reveal wanted signs of Amy and a mystery woman (Britni Sumida). There is then a duel between Amy and the mystery woman, it begins at the bell of 12 o'clock after it is seen that Nick (who is whistling), four dancers and the Man in Blue (seen in the Sugar, Yesterday and Along the Road videos) are in waiting for the bell of 12 o'clock. At the draw of their pistols it is revealed that Amy has no bullets in her gun, and after she is shot down by the mystery woman who starts walking away, the mystery woman is then shot by the bounty hunter on the top of a mountain. After the bounty hunter comes down to check if the two are dead, and starts walking away, it is revealed Amy is still alive and pulls out a tiny pistol unbeknownst to everyone else. She shoots the bounty hunter in the back, killing him before dying. It is revealed, in flashback, that Nick Noonan, who provided the guns for the duel, had taken the bullets out of Amy's gun, leaving the mystery woman with an advantage. In between scenes, there are clips of Amy and 4 other women dancing, as well as Amy lying dead on the ground, singing. In the end, Amy stands behind a white wall, shirtless with her hat in front of her chest with blood coming down her stomach. She then turns around to reveal a bullet wound in her lower back. Some footage of the landscape ends and starts the video.http://www.contactmusic.com/karmin/video/karmin-didn-t-know-you-now- official-video An alternate video is featured on the spring Journeys DVD which features Amy singing the song on a stage, under a single spotlight, in front of a curtain.

Her images and prints captured life at Black Mountain, and her art theory and teaching influenced major 20th-century artists and personalities. Life and work Archer was born Hazel Frieda Larsen on April 23, 1921 to Chris and Ella Larsen. She grew up with two brothers and a sister. Larsen contracted polio at age 10. She studied at home until high school, which she negotiated with braces and crutches. In the spring of 1944, while at the University of Wisconsin, she saw a notice that German artist Josef Albers was offering summer courses in design and painting at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. It was the beginning of her long association with the experimental liberal arts college. After getting her degree at Wisconsin, she returned to Black Mountain College, where she was a student, teacher and registrar for the next nine years. Archer matriculated into Black Mountain College in the summer of 1944 and returned in 1945 to study with Josef Albers. During her years at Black Mountain College she also studied with Buckminster Fuller, Robert Motherwell, Walter Gropius, and the photographers Beaumont Newhall and Nancy Newhall. After graduation, she joined the faculty, and became the school‚Äôs first full-time teacher of photography in 1949. The era during which Hazel Archer was at Black Mountain College is acknowledged by scholars as one of the college's peaks in terms of intellectual and artistic activity and synergistic, cross-disciplinary innovation. The college (born out of the Bauhaus tradition) was transitioning from a predominantly European sensibility to one that was distinctly American. These years at Black Mountain College were the genesis for much of American culture in the second half of the twentieth century. She taught many significant students at the college, including Robert Rauschenberg, Cy Twombly, and Stan VanDerBeek. Archer photographed life at the college and captured the everyday moments of the school's famous teachers and students. Archer left Black Mountain College in 1953, as its longstanding financial problems began to overwhelm it, and married Charles Archer, who was a student there. They continued to live for several years in the town of Black Mountain, where she opened a studio and took mostly family portraits. In 1956, the year the college closed, she and her husband moved to Tucson, Arizona, where she operated a free-lance photography studio. In 1963, she became director of adult education of the Tucson Art Center, an organization that would become the Tucson Museum of Art. She lived in Tucson until 1975, when she moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico. Though her work had been shown at the Museum of Modern Art and the Photo League in New York, she stopped exhibiting after 1957; she focused for the rest of her life on her work as an educator. Archer died in Tucson, Arizona on May 18, 2001. Her photographs are managed by the Hazel Larsen Archer Estate and Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center.

KSLU is a Student Media Organization at Saint Louis University (SLU) in Saint Louis, Missouri. The organization, which is affiliated with the College of Arts & Sciences' Department of Communication, provides \\"Saint Louis University and the St. Louis community with a student-run, tangible media outlet; providing new music, talk radio, written publication, as well as other student needs\\".\\"Busch Student Center\\", The University News, accessed January 23, 2016. Its studios and offices are located in the University's Busch Student Center building. KSLU traces its founding to the establishment of a carrier current radio station, that was set up at the University in 1949. As technologies for distributing audio programming have evolved, KSLU has employed, in turn, AM and FM radio broadcasting, transmission over cable TV channels, and, most recently, streaming audio and podcasts available over the internet.  Early History (KBIL)  Saint Louis University was a prominent pioneer in early radio development. The University began experimentation with spark transmitters in 1912, transmitted daily weather reports over station 9YK beginning on April 26, 1921, received a license for one of the first AM broadcasting stations in the United States, WEW, in March, 1922, and began operating one of the earliest FM stations, WEW-FM, in 1947. However, the FM station was shut down in late 1949, and, in the mid-1950s, WEW, which was a faculty-run, religious station, was sold to a commercial operator. Meanwhile, in 1949 the SLU communications department established a student-run carrier current radio station, operating on the AM band. (Information on the frequency used is scarce, but in 1970 the station was transmitting on 600 kilohertz.) Its description in the 1955 Saint Louis University Yearbook stated that the three main purposes of the station were to \\"provide a practical training ground for those who are training themselves for the radio profession\\", act as \\"an interesting and valuable extra-curricular activity\\", and provide \\"entertainment particularly designed to satisfy its student audience\\".\\"Station K.B.I.L.\\", Archive 1955 (Saint Louis University Yearbook), page 212. Because its signal was very low power, providing service only to the University campus and immediately adjoining areas, the station did not need a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license in order to operate. In addition, as an unlicensed station, it was never assigned official call letters by the FCC. However, for identification purposes, the moniker \\"KBIL\\"‚Äîreferring to the school's \\"Billiken\\" mascot‚Äîwas adopted for use on the air. Although KBIL rarely received attention beyond of the confines of the SLU campus, it did briefly gain national attention in February 1955, when Dave Lukefahr and Joseph Kessler played a Betty Clooney record, \\"So All Alone\\", 1,323 times over a 60-hour period, surpassing by one hour the old mark for repetitive airplay.\\"Disc Jockeys Break Record\\" (AP), Danville (Virginia) Bee, February 28, 1955, Second section, page 1. Six copies of the phonograph record were worn out in the process. This account also noted that KBIL's \\"range is limited to the mid-town area in the vicinity of the university\\".  Evolution (KSLU)  In 1983, a recently established FM station in San Angelo, Texas, that had been officially assigned KBIL (now KDCD) as its call letters by the FCC, complained about the duplicate use of its callsign by the SLU operation. As a result, the SLU station moniker was changed from \\"KBIL\\" to the still-used \\"KSLU\\". KSLU's AM band carrier current transmitter was eventually taken out of service, and a low-power FM transmitter operated until the mid -1990s. Its programming was later made available as background audio over cable TV channel 12, followed by the establishment of online streaming.KSLU History Between 1992 and 1998 KSLU expanded its activities, publishing Fiber, a college music magazine, and hosting concerts at the Reinert Pub, a student tavern on the ground floor of Reinert Hall. An attempt in 2000 to return to the airwaves as a low-power FM station was unsuccessful, however, the development of internet streaming means that over-the-air broadcasting is no longer needed for it to reach its audience. KSLU added a Sports department in 2007, with sports talk shows and live broadcasts of SLU Billikens sporting events.  Today  KSLU currently broadcasts 24 hours a day, over cable channel 18 on the SLU campus and online. In addition, it offers a mobile disc-jockey service for on-campus events, publishes Already Bored (a successor of Fiber and The Amp), and organizes music events.

Geography  View of Yat√© Lake The Blue River Provincial Park is part of the larger (15,900ha) Upper Yat√© fauna reserve. The Park covers the basins of the Blue, White, and Month of May Rivers, the latter two of which have drained into Yat√© Lake since the construction of the Yat√© Dam in 1958. Part of the banks and the length of the lake are in the park, including a large drowned forest. The altitude varies from 160 to 1,250 metres. The hydrography and the nature of the terrain lead to the presence of several waterfalls, water holes, and giant's kettle in the Blue River valley.  Biodiversity  A kagu in the park The park includes two biomes typical of New Caledonia: maquis shrubland overlying peridotite rock and tropical rainforest. There is a very high rate of biodiversity of New Caledonia. In particular, the park is known for being one of the last areas where the kagu, an endangered bird which has become a symbol of the country, can be seen in its natural habitat, with a population of about 700; this is the largest single population of the species in the wild. Other endemic and rare animals in the park include the crow honeyeater, notou, New Caledonian crow, and crested gecko. The park contains a thousand- year-old, forty-metre-tall giant Agathis lanceolata tree, one of the largest known in New Caledonia. There are also wild carnivorous plants (Drosera neocaledonica and Nepenths vieillardii) and orchids.  History  Human settlement in the park is prehistoric; petroglyphs can be found in the Blue River valley. At the beginning of the twentieth century, forestry and chrome mining led to the development of modern transport infrastructure, much of which is still in place; there are still 36km of railways for transporting logs and ore, a traction engine winch and the P√©rignon bridge, made of local wood, which crosses the branch of the lake created in the White River in 1958. The construction of the Yat√© Dam the same year made major changes to the terrain. The park was founded in 1980 and came under the responsibility of the South Province when the provinces of New Caledonia were created in 1989.  Recreation and tourist infrastructure  The South Province initiated the development of the park in 1998 in response to increasing visitor numbers with the goals of protecting nature, educating visitors about the environment and of further attracting tourists. A \\"Maison du Parc\\" was thus inaugurated in 2002 at the main entrance, with an exhibition hall (containing a permanent display about the park since June 2003), a library, a conference room, a shop, archives, and storage rooms. Areas set up for camping and picnics were set up along the rivers, as well as a network of walking and cycling trails.

A threat is made to assassinate the Vice President of the United States and the President of Venezuela at an upcoming forum in Caracas. Carter is sent to investigate. Posing as US embassy staff, Carter observes the security arrangements for the conference. He meets Ilse Hoffmann from the West German embassy in Caracas. Hoffmann is really a Russian scientist, Dr Tanya Savitch, working with the KGB who drugs and captures Carter. Carter is taken to a secret KGB laboratory in Caracas run by Oleg Dimitrov. There Carter is subjected to drug-induced mind control experiments by Savitch and her boss, Dr Anton Kalinin. Carter is brainwashed into believing he is Rafael Chavez, a Venezuelan revolutionary, whose mission is to assassinate the President of Venezuela and the Vice President of the United States during the conference. However, when Carter is released and goes about his normal duties before the conference he has troubling flashbacks of his real identity. His odd behavior arouses the suspicions of David Hawk and Clay Vincent, a fellow AXE agent. Carter stabs Vincent and ties up Hawk so that he can complete his mission. Carter is handed a water jug containing a concealed high-frequency transmitter that is capable of destroying central nervous tissue and places it in the conference room. The device will be remotely activated by another confederate. The low frequency roar of overhead jets brings Carter to his senses. He remembers who he is and what he has done. He forces his way into the conference room. The ultrasonic transmitter activates but causes only minor injuries before Carter destroys it. Carter searches Caracas for Tanya Savitch. He finds her and forces her to take him back to the secret KGB laboratory. The laboratory is being dismantled. Carter kills a technician and Kalinin. Tanya Savitch wounds Carter and he shoots and kills her. Oleg Dimitrov escapes and heads to the airport. Carter chases him and kills him in the airport washroom.

The main tasks are wastewater discharge and treatment, flood protection, groundwater management, settlement of claims caused by hard coal mining, river restoration and protection of ecosystems.  History  = Origins and early development = The river Lippe appears as a two-tier water course: Upstream, eastward of the city of Hamm/Lippborg, the catchment is more rural. Downstream of Hamm settlements and industrial impacts characterize the situation. Preconditions for the industrialization started with the construction of the Cologne-Minden trunk line in the 1840s that connected the river Rhine settlements like Cologne with harbours and trade at the river Weser and on this route with Lippe towns, too. Moreover, this railway supported the coal and steel industry development in the whole northern Ruhr region. The hard coal mining that started in the middle of the 19th century in the Emscher catchment area developed in the following decades direction north. In the Lippe catchment area from the 1860s on first problems from mining subsidence and drainage of polluted water appeared. Villages and towns located at the Lippe and its tributary Seseke (Werl, Unna, Hamm, B√∂nen, Kamen, Bergkamen, L√ºnen and Dortmund) expanded quickly with the establishing of hard coal mines between 1856 and World War I. The industrialization caused huge water quality problems in the Lippe, its tributaries and the settlements; therefore first in 1913 the Sesekegenossenschaft and later in 1926 the Lippeverband as public water boards (‚ÄúWasserwirtschaftsverb√§nde‚Äù) were established.Lippeverband(editor): ‚Äû50 Jahre Lippeverband‚Äú, Dortmund/Essen 1975 The Sesekegenossenschaft was from 1913 on responsible for the water management and the precursor of the Lippeverband from 1926 on. The Lippe tributary Seseke has a catchment area of 319,45 km¬≤ and drains the towns of Werl, Unna, B√∂nen, Kamen, Bergkamen, L√ºnen and the east of Dortmund. The Seseke catchment area suffered from ‚Äúsubsidence funnels‚Äù where waste water, surface run-off and water from the creeks gathered and digested; so interdisciplinary solutions were needed, comparable to the Emschergenossenschaft in the neighboring catchment area which hosted the Sesekegenossenschaft in the first years. The municipalities were responsible for the inner city drainage systems and interconnection points were jointly defined where the Sesekegenossenschaft took over responsibility. Those were normally the subcatchment parts where underground sewer systems were impossible as the mining subsidence would have caused damages continuously and waste water would have infiltrated in groundwater and soil. The Sesekegenossenschaft (and later the Lippeverband) then worked on the drainage capacity by cutting the meanders of the water courses, deepening the runways and lining them with concrete, constructing dykes and pumping stations and establishing waste water treatment plants. All discharge from industry, mines and households as well as rain, surface water and natural discharge were collected and drained in these new ‚Äúconcrete streams‚Äù. All costs were divided between the ‚Äúusers‚Äù of the Seseke system, depending on the volume and load of waste water or drainage capacity or causer (for example the mining companies). Governmental investigations showed that the measures that were taken in the Seseke system were expected to solve problems in the rest of the Lippe catchment area, too. Formally, the ‚ÄûLippegesetz‚Äú (Lippe act) was legislated on Januar 19th 1926 and the Sesekegenossenschaft merged into the new water board.Lippeverband act More and more measures had to be taken to compensate negative impacts of the mining that went in northern direction and caused damages in the Lippe catchment area between Hamm and the Lippe mouth at the river Rhine near Wesel. Dykes were built for flood prevention, waste water treatment facilities and pumping stations kept the systems running.Lippeverband: ‚ÄûAnsichten eines Flusses ‚Äì die Lippe‚Äú, Peter Pomp Verlag Bottrop/Essen 2001, = Later development = Until the 1970s water pollution played no important role in the public debate but environmental policy changed over the decades. Environmental standards on national level and especially from the EU have been leading to enormous efforts to improve the nature standards and today a couple of positive developments can be stated, like new FFH (Flora Fauna Habitat) sites EU LIFE project Lippeauen and governmental initiatives around the WFD (Water Framework Directive).Environment Ministry report on Lippe quality development Water Framework Directive in the Lippe catchment area Especially the sub catchment of the Seseke has experienced enormous efforts to restore the system. Since the 1960s, the coal crisis was leading to the shutdown of more and more mines and the Lippeverband with its administrative, political and industrial members decided to re-develop the Seseke system towards ‚Äûsecond hand nature‚Äú ‚Äì a real restoration compared to the times before industrialization is impossible. Between the 1980s and 2012 four waste water treatment plants were constructed in B√∂nen, Kamen, Dortmund-Scharnhorst and L√ºnen. A new 75 km underground sewer system was constructed and 73 km of former ‚Äúconcrete water courses‚Äù were restored to work as ecological green belts in the landscape now. Challenges for the Lippeverband are still the water quality demands. Though the Lippeverband is not a drinking water provider there are water bodies in the catchment area that are used by Gelsenwasser for drinking water supply and where Lippeverband waste water treatment plants are discharging to. The Lippeverband started operating first treatment facilities voluntarily with advanced technologies and initiated European network projects on the environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products and how to eliminate them from hospitals or domestic waste water.Waste water treatment info Further initiatives deal with the impacts of climate change. Moreover, artists and landscape architects are involved in projects to capitalize the newly developed ecological and leisure qualities, for example in the frame of the cultural events of Ruhr.2010 or ‚Äú√úber Wasser gehen‚Äù (‚Äúwalking on water‚Äù), a joint initiative of the cities L√ºnen, Bergkamen, Kamen, B√∂nen, Unna, Dortmund, the district Unna, the regional planning assembly Ruhr and the ‚ÄúUrbane K√ºnste Ruhr‚Äù.  Responsibilities  The Lippeverband is not ‚Äúowner‚Äù of the river Lippe which is in the German hierarchy a ‚Äúwater course first level‚Äù. These are historically often the rivers that (once) have been used for shipping and therefore are state-owned asset, in this case under protection of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The environment ministry is financing all nature related activities the Lippeverband is carrying out at the river Lippe directly.Seseke arts project The work related to tributaries, waste water management and man-made impact has to be financed by the municipalities, businesses, industry and mining companies etc., operationally carried out by the Lippeverband. Responsibilities and tasks of the Lippeverband are defined in the act ‚ÄûLippegesetz‚Äú, enacted January 16, 1926 and adapted later as ‚ÄûGesetz √ºber den Lippeverband‚Äú (LippeVG): * Management of runoff, flood prevention at open water courses and in the sub catchments; * Maintenance of open water courses and related facilities; * Ecological restoration of technically altered water courses; * Groundwater management; * Compensation of mining impacts on ecological or water management related changes; * Waste water disposal; * Disposal of waste from water management services; * Water quality management; * Scientific work related to water management challenges; * Support of drinking water supply, water for industrial use and use of hydropower Drinking water supply and Lippe river management is carried out in cooperation with the Wasserverband Westdeutsche Kan√§le. The Lippeverband is working in an administrative collectivity with the Emschergenossenschaft, the water board established in 1899 in a neighbouring river catchment area. Together, more than 1.500 employees work for both water boards, around 600 of them belong to the Lippeverband. Both water boards together are the biggest water management and service provider in Germany.  Governance  The North Rhine-Westphalian water boards are statutory bodies, working in public-private partnership as non-profit institutions. The Lippeverband, together with the Emschergenossenschaft, has an administration that is governed by a board of 3 managing directors, elected for 5 years each. The election happens on the level of associates that have representatives in an annual assembly, coming from * the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, * 45 municipalities, * 107 commercial and infrastructure companies and * 4 mining companies. The number of representatives per member depends on the number of citizens in the 45 municipalities and on the volume of waste water ‚Äúproduced‚Äù by the companies and mines. The supervisory authority is the Ministry for Climate Protection, Environment, Agriculture, Conservation and Consumer Protection of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia (MKULNV). German water boards are not formal authorities but have to receive permissions and approvals for construction works etc. They are independent in financial and internal management but depend on regulatory decrees regarding water acts.  Catchment Area  The river Lippe with a length of in total 220 km is only managed over a stretch of 147 km between Lippborg and Wesel (approx. 3.280 km¬≤ of 4.890 km¬≤ catchment area) by the Lippeverband. With an amendment of the Lippeverband act (LippeVG) in 1990 the responsibilities have been extended to smaller catchment areas of tributaries to the Rhine close to the Lippemouth (Mommbach, Stollbach, Langhorster Leitgraben, Lohberger Entw√§sserungsgraben, Bruckhauser M√ºhlenbach, Rotbach). Moreover, due to the migration of the hard coal mining to the north, responsibilities for potential impact and compensation were given to the Lippeverband in the mining reserve areas of the municipalities Ahlen, Ascheberg, Beckum, Drensteinfurt, Ennigerloh, Raesfeld and Sendenhorst.

The complex is bound by Via dei Malcontenti, Via delle Casine, Via Pietro Thouar and the Viale della Giovine Italia. The complex is located in the quartiere of Santa Croce, east of the city, north of the Arno river, and just within the 16th-century city walls. History Originally Montedomini referred to a suburb in the east of the city, next to the shores of the Mugnone stream, where the Clarissan nuns had a monastery. It was from this convent that Dante's Piccarda Donati was retrieved for marriage. Destroyed in the Siege of Florence (1529‚Äì30), the nuns were relocated by Duke Alessandro de' Medici to this site, inside the walls, where there previously had been a Lazzaretto or leper asylum (1478), called the Spedale degli Ammorbati (Hospital of the Sick).

In 1810 both monasteries were closed. In 1812, putatively to celebrate the birth of Napoleon's son, the King of Rome, The architect Giuseppe Del Rosso was commissioned to fuse the monasteries into a single complex, renamed initially the Deposito di Mendicit√†, later after restoration, Pia Casa di Lavoro. The poor house was housing, training, and employing over a thousand young men and women.Una gita a Firenze guida descrittiva e illustrativa della citt√†, page 118. By 1817 the population included 1054 males and 954 females. By 1840, the census had fallen to less than a thousand, only to increase when in 1840, laws against begging were enforced. By 1849, the population rose to about 1300.La Rassegna nazionale, Volume 145, article titled Pietro Thouar Direttore della Pia Casa di Lavoro, by A. Linaker, Florence, 1905 page 231-236. In 1868 the rules of the Pia Casa di Lavoro were revised and it became the largest charitable institution in Florence, offering shelter to over 1000 persons of all ages and both sexes. The boys were taught a trade, while girls learned to embroider and sew, or learn how to become house-maids. The shelter maintained a monastic-like cloistering, preventing outsiders from visiting without a special permission from the Director.Elvira Grifi, page 260-261. Among the trades taught to boys in 1848 were mechanic, carriage worker, varnisher/painter (verniciatore), blacksmith, cobbler, typographer, and engraver/wood carver. In 1848, a eulogy of the former director, Pietro Thouar, described the director of the institution as having a goal of to guide towards great works, the multitude of young girls and children strapped to the crossroads, the old beggars, the vagrants subtracted from idleness, crime, and misery. The director was described as heeding in his time the word of an apostle, that steeled him to loving hand that guided him and raised him out of degradation.A. Linaker, Florence 1905 page 231-236. Much of the architecture on Via dei Malcontenti dates to the second half of the 19th century under the engineer Ghelardo and Pietro Gaetano Gherardi. Other facades had been completed earlier by Giuseppe Del Rosso. Further expansion occurred along the Viale della Giovine Italia under Vincenzo Ricci. In the late 19th century, homes for the convalescence of wounded soldiers were erected. On via delle Cascine, the original structures of the convent of Monticelli, can be seen.Palazzo Spinelli, Repertorio delle Architettura Civili di Firenze, entry on the Pia Casa di Lavoro.

She helped found the Jobless Workers Union and pushed for labor reforms, including wage and hour laws, as well as the Women‚Äôs League, which fought for social, economic and political empowerment of women. Biography Elfreda Stanford was born in 1901 in British Honduras to Creole, Bajan immigrant, George Stanford and his wife Louisa. At the age of 10, she was selected for the 1910 ‚ÄúTenth‚Äù ceremonies, to give the loyalty address of the schoolchildren to the governor. By 1919 she was working as a domestic for one of the white British families as an unskilled laborer. In the 1920s, Stanford married Solomon Trapp. Between 1924 and 1925, Trapp became a \\"significant new political voice\\" on gender and class. She was what is known in Belize as a Bembe woman. The term refers to primarily working-class women, who are \\"not afraid to fight or curse‚Ä¶\\", but who refuse to be defined by moralists because they see themselves as engaged in a justifiable fight for their rights or nationhood. She spoke at the 1932 constitutional hearings, where she demanded that the authorities protect the interests of working women, but did not press for universal suffrage on the basis of lack of education. Around the same time, she was one of the founders of the Jobless Workers factory. On 15 November 1933, the Independent carried a notice of Solomon Trapp's death. On 1 October 1934, she was one of the women who led the takeover of the largest private employer in British Honduras, BEC Sawmill. Initially the group was led by Tony Soberanis, but when the men backed away, black women had led labor dispute and warded off white men by wielding sticks, while commenting on the cowardice of their own male leaders. By 1935, Trapp and her sisters Virginia and Ianthe Stanford were members of the Labourers and Unemployed Association (LUA). Her stance had been radicalized and Trapp was now in favor of full suffrage. When the LUA marked its first anniversary in March 1935 with new elections, the winners were Rosannah Branche, Sarah Johnson, Amybell Pratt (chair), Pearl Tennyson, Christobel Usher, and Trapp. LUA women organized the Women‚Äôs League in 1935 with the goals of creating a national democracy without hierarchies of class, sex, or race. The petition which they sent to the government asking for suffrage included blacks, Garifuna, mestizos and Mayans, the 98% of the populace which did not earn $25.00 per month, and all persons aged 21 and over. Around this same time, the Black Cross Nurses split with the LUA women over class lines, as the nurses were not in favor of enfranchising \\"the rowdy popular classes\\". In 1940, during the dry season, a group of women were appointed from the Mesopotamia neighborhood of Belize City to ask the Colonial Secretary for the city water pipes to remain open longer than the customary one hour. Getting no positive response, public meeting was held in which Trapp was the only woman speaker and she advocated hiring women to collect water tokens to better organize the waiting queues. Ultimately, her suggestion was rejected and the government barged in more water. During the 1940s, Trapp remarried, becoming Reyes. In the 1950s, when the People's United Party (PUP) began pushing for independence from Britain, poor women flocked to the party because the young nationalist leaders agreed to accept them as allies and no other parties would. Reyes was very active politically. In 1951, when the governor dissolved the predominantly PUP city council to thwart nationalist aims, Reyes led a protest to the Government House. During the general strike which occurred from October to December 1952, Reyes distributed supplies to strikers who had shut down work at the BEC sawmill, the Fort George Hotel, Public Works Department, the waterfront and extended to the road crews from Belize City to the Cayo District. At the end of the strike, Reyes led a meeting in which the domestic working women demanded, and ultimately won support for written contracts, a minimum wage and a 48-hour cap on hours worked per week. In early 1953, Reyes and her sister Virginia Stanford led a labor strike of domestic workers in which she led 400 workers demanding better pay. That same year, she was elected to the GWU‚Äôs General and Executive Council. The ten-person council elected four women: Reyes, Hazel Gentle, Enid Panting, and Elsa Vasquez. In 1956, a split in the party occurred with accusations of slander leveled at Nicholas Pollard. Reyes was among those who signed the declaration accusing Pollard and submitting her PUP resignation, which she later claimed was because she felt George Cadle Price's leadership of the PUP was becoming more conservative and elitist. She joined the British Honduras Federation of Women (BHFW), who were primarily middle-class reformers and typically were seen as aligned with non-nationalist ideals and its voice and action plans were typically implemented in the elitist, colonial model. In 1956, Reyes was organizing training policies for BHFW for domestics wishing to obtain employment in Canada. By 1958, Reyes was serving as treasurer of the organization. By 1962, Reyes had joined the National Independence Party (NIP) and was appointed to serve on Labour Department‚Äôs new Domestic Servants Committee. In the late 1960s Reyes was working to keep day-care centers for poor working women open. She remained active in politics through the gaining of Belize independence in 1981.Reynolds: WIN-Belize, p. 14 Reyes died in 1992 in Belize City, Belize.

It marks his directorial debut. The film had its world premiere on July 21, 2015 at the Fantasia International Film Festival and stars Ryan Simpkins as a young woman whose mental issues may be a result of the paranormal. Plot A teenage girl named Lucy (Amberley Gridley) and her mother Sarah (Karina Logue) are driving when Lucy asks her mother if she can go on a camping trip. When Sarah tells Lucy no, Lucy angrily gets out of the car only to be hit by an oncoming car. Tess (Ryan Simpkins), a teenage girl that has suffered for years from what appears to be mental instability, has moved into a new house with her mother Jessica (Annika Marks), hoping to have a new start. As Tess and her mother are settling in, Tess skateboards by the road where Lucy was hit-while observing the cross that has Lucy's picture on it, an unseen force pushes Tess down in the dirt and won't let her leave. Eventually Tess is able to get up and walk home but is now beginning to see phenomena that Tess attributes to her hallucinations. Tess eventually comes upon Sarah's bookstore and says something to Sarah that only Lucy would know, which leaves Sarah suspicious. Eventually, Tess is forced to confront her hallucinations and looks into a mirror and witnesses her eye color changing from blue to brown repeatedly. After having what seems like a mental breakdown, Tess eventually collapses by the front door just as Jessica returns from work. Tess is taken to the hospital where she is put on constant supervision, medication and therapy. A priest from Jessica's local church comes by to see Tess and suggests that possession may be involved. Tess is discharged and returns to her bedroom to see that Jessica boarded up Tess' bedroom window for Tess' protection. After still exhibiting paranormal phenomena and refusing to eat, Jessica is driving Tess into town when Tess suddenly lunges from the car and runs off into a neighborhood and eventually reaches Sarah and Lucy's house. Tess embraces Sarah while Jessica, who had followed Tess, looks on in confusion and fear. While 'Tess' explores Lucy's bedroom, Sarah explains to Jessica that Tess may have a gift where she can channel spirits and let them take possession of her own body so they can say goodbye to their loved ones and move on. Sarah believes that Lucy has taken possession of Tess and that by talking to Lucy through Tess' body, she can convince Lucy to move on. At first, Lucy says she does not want to leave and that Tess does not want to return because she is tired of the doctors and constant medicine but Sarah tells Lucy that moving on is the right thing to do and Lucy eventually agrees. Lucy leaves Tess' body, but another spirit has apparently entered Tess' body and lunges from the bed and tries to run away only to have Sarah and Jessica lock Tess in the basement. Jessica goes down to find Tess, promising that she'll do better as a parent, only to have 'Tess' run up and fight with her. After a struggle, Jessica is looking at Tess in fear when Lucy reenters Tess' body and wants to see her mother. Lucy asks for one more night with her mother and Jessica agrees. After the night is over, Sarah tells Lucy that it's time to move on and Lucy exits Tess' body, finding herself in a type of spirit world surrounded by other spirits. Lucy wanders until she finds Tess who reveals that she wants to go back and hugs Lucy. Suddenly, an invisible force attacks Lucy and a bright light appears to signify that Lucy has moved on. Tess returns to her body and life seems to go back to normal, her mother not sure if Tess has improved or not. Later, in the coffee shop, Tess is asked her name but doesn't reply. Back at home, Tess is playing and singing a song (the same one Lucy made up while swinging) on her guitar; she looks up and her eye color changes from blue to brown.

Leonardo's authorship would be demonstrated by Christopher Tyler, who stated \\"For those projections dated later than 1508,Mapa de Juan de la Cosa (p√°g.27) his drawings should be effectively considered the original precursors..\\". In fact, there is a sketch of it on a page in the Codex Atlanticus manuscripts, made from the very hand of Leonardo, being Leonardo's sketch, the first known description of the octant projection. The same page of the Codex contains sketches of eight other projections of the globe (those known in the late fifteenth century), being studied by Leonardo, ranging from the Ptolemy's conical planisphere projection to the one proposed by Rosselli, Description Development of Cahill-butterfly's quasi-octant projection circa 1915 The projection is neither conformal nor equal-area,[A conformal projection has the following properties: the scale at any point is the same in all directions.. and the angle between any two lines on the map must be the same as on the earth. An equal area projection preserves relationships between corresponding areas..] bound by circular arcs, with no meridians and no parallels, in which the spherical surface of the earth is divided into eight octants, each flattened into the shape of a Reuleaux triangle. If transferred to an elastic support, it would be possible to cover with them the surface of a model of the earth's globe.. The eight triangles are oriented in a similar way as per two four-leaf cloversProiezioni a ottanti side by side, being the earth poles in the center of each clove. One of the sides of the eight triangles, (the one opposite to the center of the pseudo clover), is one fourth of the equator, the remaining two (those that converge to the center of the pseudo clover), are part of the two meridians that with the equator dissect the globe in the eight octants.

So, bearing in mind the fact that Tyler was the first scholar to mention the sketch of this projection in Codex Atlanticus in 2017, the authorship of the map it is not universally accepted, with some authors being completely against any minimal contribution from Leonardo, such as Henry Harrisse (1892), or Eug√®ne M√ºntz (1899 ‚Äì citing Harrisse authority from 1892, although none of them talks about the projection's sketch in Codex Atlanticus).

The holotype of Bayomesasuchus is the most complete crocodyliform specimen recorded from the Cerro Lisandro Formation, and represents the fourth peirosaurid named from the Neuqu√©n Group of Argentina, together with Lomasuchus palpebrosus and Patagosuchus anielensis from the overlying late Turonian to the early Coniacian Portezuelo Formation, and Gasparinisuchus peirosauroides from the even younger Santonian to early Campanian Bajo de la Carpa and Anacleto Formations.  Phylogeny  A phylogenetic analysis of Crocodyliformes recovered Bayomesasuchus within Peirosauridae in a polytomy with the African peirosaurid Hamadasuchus rebouli and a clade formed by all other South American peirosaurids.

He was succeeded by Dattatray Padsalgikar. He is former Indian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Javed is the second former Mumbai police commissioner to get a prestigious diplomatic posting after J. F. Ribeiro who served as Indian ambassador to Romania between 1989‚Äì1993.  Career  A 1980 batch IPS officer, Ahmed Javed was appointed as the Commissioner of Mumbai Police on 8 September 2015 by the Maharashtra Government replacing Rakesh Maria. He served as Superintendent of Police in Buldhana and Nanded before being posted as Deputy Commissioner of Police, Intelligence, in Mumbai. He then served in various postings, including a stint with the Delhi Police between 1983 and 1985. He returned to Mumbai in the early 2000s, serving as Additional Commissioner of Police of the Central Region and then the South Region, before being promoted to Inspector General of Police, he was posted as Joint Commissioner of Police (Law and Order). He served in this key post from 2002 to 2005. After being promoted as Additional Director General of Police, Javed was posted with the state reserve police force and with the Maharashtra Police Headquarters as ADG Establishment, and then he took over as Commissioner of Police, Navi Mumbai in 2010. He currently is Ambassador of India in Saudi Arabia. He was earlier the Director General of Police (Home Guards). On 12 December 2015 Ahmad Javed was appointed India's Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, six months after last Ambassador Hamid Ali Rao had retired. Personal life Ahmad Javed comes from Lucknow. His father Mr. Qazi Mukhtar is a retired senior IAS officer. Ahmed Javed graduated in Bachelors in Arts from Delhi's St Stephen's College. Javed is married to Shabnam with whom he has two children, Amer and Zaara. He wears Khaki ‚ÄòKhadi‚Äô uniform daily. He is an avid billiards player.  Controversy  =Rakesh Maria‚Äôs appointment= There was a controversy over Maria's appointment as a commissioner though Ahmed Javed was the senior for the Commissioner of Police post. Ahmad Javed was surprised when his junior, Rakesh Maria, who is from the 1981 batch, had been appointed the CP instead of him. Many suspected political favouritism and questions were raised on how a junior-level officer had become the commissioner superseding the senior. In Feb 2014, Maria had taken charge as the Mumbai Police commissioner ‚Äì a prestigious post ‚Äì superseding his senior, Javed, who was then promoted by the Cong-NCP government as DG, Home Guards, a post that does not have much to offer to an officer. ‚ÄúMaria managed to get the post of Commissioner of Police as he was very close to some NCP leaders who helped him take the posting superseding seniors like IPS officer Vijay Kamble, who was made Thane Commissioner of Police and Ahmad Javed, who became DG, Home guards\\", said a police officer. Javed and Kamble had both protested at the time and some IPS officers, like Prem Krishna Jain, had even resigned, as they were upset with the government's system of appointing people. Javed could have never thought that he would become the Commissioner as he had already been promoted as Director General of Police and the post of Mumbai Police Commissioner is held by an officer of the rank of Additional DGP, which is a lower post. However the rank for the post for Commissioner was upgraded to that of Director General. After the announcement by the CM, Javed was appointed as Commissioner, which left Maria in confusion by the sudden announcement. The tables turned, with Maria proceeding on leave to protest against the government's decision. However most in the force felt that justice had finally been done and a deserving officer was finally, if not belatedly, appointed. After taking the reins of Commissioner, Javed had a very successful term. He introduced various new policing and citizen outreach schemes including the launch of the extremely popular Mumbai Police Twitter handle.

Personal life Rodahl was born in Br√∏nn√∏ysund to Anton Rodahl and Tora Oppsahl. He married British-born Joan Hunter in 1946. They first met after he landed by parachute in a pasture, close to where she was milking a cow. He died in Oslo in 2008. Career Rodahl studied medicine in Oslo. He took a break from his studies and spent the winter of 1939-1940 at Clavering Island in eastern Greenland, along with two hunters (one of whom was the renowned polar bear hunter Henry Rudi). During this winter he made glacier measurements for glaciologist Hans Wilhelmsson Ahlmann, and also collected livers from polar bears for later analysis. While he was isolated in Greenland, Europe saw the outbreak of World War II and the German invasion of Norway, and instead of returning to Norway, Rodahl ended up in Great Britain. The hypothesis that polar bear liver contains large amounts of vitamin A was verified, and Rodahl joined another expedition for scientific seal hunting off Newfoundland. After the sealing expedition, he was transferred for military training in the United Kingdom for the rest of the war years. Back in Oslo, he graduated as a physician in 1948. His doctoral thesis in 1950 examined animal reactions to excessive intake of vitamin A. During the following years he held research positions in Fairbanks, Alaska, and in Philadelphia.

Biography Quack, born in Zetten to a beer brewer and his wife, commenced studies at Utrecht in 1853, followed by law studies at the Amsterdam Athenaeum Illustre. In Amsterdam, he attended lectures by Jeronimo de Bosch Kemper and Martinus des Amorie van der Hoeven, both Christian critics of liberalism. Following the example of his professors, Quack became convinced that liberalism could not address the social problems of his day. He submitted a thesis about fourteenth-century statehood and earned a doctorate degree in July 1860 (from Utrecht University, because the Athenaeum Illustre lacked the right to confer such degrees). In the following year, Quack worked as a clerk at the provincial government of North Holland, then became a journalist, and also worked for some time at the Amsterdam Chamber of Commerce. From 1860 onward, he wrote for the literary journal De Gids, of which he became an editor in 1863. In September 1863, he secured a position as a secretary of the state railway company. Having been appointed professor of political economy at Utrecht University in 1868, Quack presented his students with socialist theories of economics besides teaching the common curriculum of the time. In 1875, he started writing his magnum opus on the history of the socialist movement, De socialisten: Personen en stelsels. The first volume of this book would appear in 1877; the last, twenty years later. Quack was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1877. Also in 1877, Quack left his academic position, to be succeeded by Johan d'Aulnis de Bourouill, and took a job at De Nederlandsche Bank. He proceeded with his historical work, and in fact one of the reasons for switching jobs was the increase in salary, which he needed to buy more books for his studies.Arthur Lehning's introduction to the centenary edition of Quack was to join the board of directors of De Nederlandsche Bank in 1885, also becoming professor extraordinaire of the history of political economy at the University of Amsterdam, which he remained until 1894. Although a critic of economic liberalism, Quack never joined any of the socialist currents, although he did attend the 1872 Congress of the International. Nor did he join any other political current: he felt related to liberals, in particular Cort van der Linden, but disliked their individualism; he admired socialists' ideals, but not what he considered their \\"breeding of mistrust and hate\\" as a means to realize them; his own ideals resembled social conservatism, but he was too much of a democrat to feel related to the conservatism practiced in the Netherlands. He has been described as a \\"cathedral socialist\\" with Saint- Simonist ideas. According to Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis, with whom Quack exchanged some letters, Quack lacked either courage or drive, and with these qualities, he might have become \\"our Lassalle\\". Theory and practice were in a state of tension in Quack's life: during the 1903 railroad strikes, he was president of the board of the state railroad company and supported the firing of 11% of the company's personnel. In his memoir, he recalled this episode as \\"the most cruel page of the book of my life\\", but still defended the decision. Works De socialisten. Personen en stelsels (three volumes, 1877‚Äì1897, Amsterdam; reprinted 1977) is considered Quack's main work. It is a compendium of biographies of early socialists, including many forgotten thinkers, based on Quack's study of primary sources.

He has been Chief of Staff of the PLAAF since August 2013, and previously served as Commander of the Beijing Military Region Air Force. Biography Ma was born in 1962 in Pingyu, Henan Province. He enlisted in the PLAAF and served in the Guangzhou Military Region Air Force for many years. Ma earned fast promotion after proving himself a top-grade fighter pilot, an outstanding fighter division commander, and a keen proponent of training. Instead of routine technical training, Ma emphasized tactical combat training. When he commanded the 2nd Fighter Division, it was rated as having displayed the most proficiency in training for three successive years. He also won three PLA science and technology awards. In 2007, Ma was promoted from commander of the 2nd Fighter Division to deputy chief of staff of the Guangzhou MR Air Force, when he was 43. Two years later, he was promoted to deputy commander of the Jinan Military Region Air Force (a full corps rank) and again within one year he was transferred to the Beijing Military Region Air Force as deputy commander and chief of staff. The frequent transfers reflect the air force leadership's confidence in Ma and their crafting a succession plan for him involving gaining intimate familiarity with various MRAFs and combat units. Ma attained the rank of major general in July 2008. He was probably the only major general at the full corps rank in the air force who was born in the 1960s. In March 2011, Ma was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff of the PLAAF. In August 2012, he became Commander of the Beijing MR Air Force and Deputy Commander of the Beijing MR. In August 2013, Ma was promoted to Chief of Staff of the PLAAF and the rank of lieutenant general.

Their album, Great Adventure Cigar, was highly rated by Foo Fighters and Die Toten Hosen (Vom Richie asked the band to support for the Die Toten Hosen Live tour 2000 and Campino would introduce and praise the band before each performance) and was a fusion of Punk rock, hard rock, heavy metal and alternative with influences from Helmet to The Ruts to The Beatles to The Clash. Formed by former English Dogs/UK Subs guitarist Gizz Butt, Janus Stark released their album Great Adventure Cigar in 1998 on Earache Records. Butt was also playing guitar for The Prodigy while they were touring on the back of Fat Of The Land.Hughes, Ben, (13 December 2019), \\"Janus Stark ‚Äì ‚ÄòAngel In The Flames‚Äô (Time & Matter Recordings)\\", Rpmonline.co.uk Their name comes from a character, Janus Stark, in the seventies comic books Smash and Valiant.Stewart, Allison, (23 November 1998), \\"Gizz Butt Splits Time Between Janus Stark and Prodigy\\", Rolling Stone They are also known for Butt's guitar playing. Ben Hughes commented on RPM online \\"The thing that sets Janus Stark apart from their contemporaries is the fact that Gizz is a shredder. While ‚ÄòAngel In The Flames‚Äô is littered with turn of the Century pop punk sensibilities, buzzsaw guitars and full band harmonies, there is a more technical and aggressive element in place thanks to Gizz‚Äôs guitar histrionics. Yet, while the lyrics are socially and politically aware, and the riffs crunchy, it‚Äôs the melodies that always shine through, they are pure sugar for the soul.\\" Their song \\"Every Little Thing Counts\\" was featured on the soundtracks to the 1998 films Disturbing Behavior and Varsity Blues.

In September 2018, they released a new song and video \\"Shuffling The Pack\\" , the first of four songs which was written for the upcoming new album with the working title of 'Angel In The Flames'.

Gillman Barracks housed the 1st Battalion, Middlesex Regiment a line infantry regiment of the British Army, and the 2nd Battalion, Loyal Regiment of the British Army. The plan was to accommodate the expansion of the British infantry in Singapore. The camp included married quarters for officers, barracks buildings, sports facilities, messes, regimental institutes and even a swimming pool. Gillman Barracks was one of the last British outposts to fall to the Japanese during the Second World War, where the Regiment fought the Japanese three days before Singapore fell in February 1942. After the Japanese surrender on 14 August 1945, command of the base transferred to the returning British forces. In August 1971, the British handed over Gillman Barracks to the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) for a token sum of $1, as part of their withdrawal from Singapore. For the next 13 years, it was the headquarters for the School of Combat Engineering and the 3rd Transport Battalion. In the early 1970s, some of the buildings were also used by the Singapore American School for classroom space. In 1984, a similar handover was done between the School of Combat Engineering and the SAF Transport Base, with $1 being the handover fee. Gillman Barracks was vacated in 1990 and used subsequently for commercial purposes. After the SAF vacated the camp in the 1990s, the buildings were used for commercial purposes and the site was renamed Gillman Village in 1996. The main colonial building was repainted and renovated to include commercial spaces such as caf√©s, restaurants, bars and furniture shops. The idea was to draw people to this slightly hidden enclave with the promise of colonial charm and delicious food and beverage options. However, Gillman Village was not very successful due to its isolated location and it had little human traffic. In 2002, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) declared Identity Plans for 15 areas in Singapore, with Gillman Village being one of that 15. Grouped under the Southern Ridges and Hillside Villages category, the plan was to \\"enhance (the) activities\\" within this area through the introduction of \\"new buildings\\" and the act of \\"bringing in more activities\\". The Identity Plans were met with strong public support, as shown by surveys done at the URA centre from 23 July to 23 October 2002. 72% of respondents agreed with the proposed enhancements. In 2010,Singapore Economic Development Board (2011), \\"Singapore Economic Development Board calls for Expressions of Interests (EOI) for galleries to set up in Gillman Barracks extended to 26 August 2011\\" (press release. Retrieved 25 October 2011. the Singapore government announced plans to redevelop Gillman Village, reverting to its original name, Gillman Barracks. Gillman Barracks was launched in September 2012 as a contemporary art centre with 13 art galleries, including well-established galleries such as Tomio Koyama Gallery and Sundaram Tagore Gallery.Poon, C. H. (19 June 2011), \\"Home for art galleries at Gillman Barracks\\", The Straits Times. Retrieved 25 October 2011 from Factiva. The area is now a site for arts-related activities, where various agencies like the Economic Development Board (Development and Promotion), JTC Corporation (Refurbishment and Construction) and National Arts Council (Promotion of Singapore Arts Scene) work together to develop the area. In April 2015, five galleries ‚Äî almost a third of the 17 galleries there ‚Äî did not renew their leases, citing low human traffic, poor sales and a slow start to the arts enclave. This came after \\"three years of persistently low footfall\\". In February 2016, Galerie Michael Janssen also left, citing how it \\"felt the project has not taken off as envisioned\\". The Singapore design label Supermama, the Creamier ice cream shop and the Australian gallery Sullivan+Strumpf moved in instead. In 2019, due to Singapore Art Museum undergoing renovations, the Singapore Biennale was held at several venues including the National Gallery Singapore and LASALLE College of the Arts, with Gillman Barracks hosting several spaces distributed among three different blocks as well.https://www.singaporebiennale.org/visit/venues  Buildings  = Block 9 = Corridors of Block 9 Known as the primary colonial building, it once housed some of the British Army‚Äôs most well-known warrant officers, such as General Sir Webb Gillman himself. This building served as the officers‚Äô married quarters, with recreational activities such as badminton carried out in the open spaces in front of the building. Today, the main colonial building has been named Block 9 in Gillman Barracks, the main and biggest block in the contemporary arts cluster. The similar colonial architecture has been preserved, and has survived various transformations in the Gillman area. Similar big windows, wide corridors and high arches are still present, allowing for good ventilation within the building. Block 9 was designed and built as a Warrant Officers and Sergeants Mess from the time it was constructed in 1935. It did not serve as officers quarters and most certainly did not accommodate General Webb Gillman - who died in office in 1933. Gillman only spent 3 months in Singapore during 1927. The building reverted back to its original use after the Japanese surrender in 1945, it remained as a mess for the Royal Engineers until the British withdrawal in 1971 = The Army Kinema Corporation (AKC) = Block 7 in Gillman Barracks After the Second World War, the British War Office in London established the Army Kinema Corporation (AKC) and set up the Regal Cinema at Gillman Barracks to entertain the British troops stationed there. Movies were screened twice nightly except Tuesday nights, including films such as Ben Hur (1959) and Jailhouse Rock (1957). During the time of Gillman Village, the same building was preserved, but served a different purpose. It was known as the Verve Bar & Bistro. The AKC logo remained on the side of the building and was repainted. After the redevelopment of Gillman Village into Gillman Barracks, the building houses commercial art galleries and exhibitions, while still preserving its famous AKC logo on the exterior. It is also known as Block 7 today, the only block with a pointed roof within Gillman Barracks. = Bourne School = Side steps to previous Bourne School now covered by art fixtures and dense vegetation From 1945 onwards, the British Forces Schools operated within the Army and Naval Bases in Singapore. Alexandra Grammar School was built on top of the hill at Gillman Barracks and renamed Bourne Secondary School in 1964. Students took the side steps up to Bourne School at the top of hill. The school has relocated to Preston Road, and is now known as the ISS International School ‚Äì not too far from where Gillman Barracks is. Today, the similar side steps which used to lead up to the school are covered by grown trees and vegetation, with art fixtures near Block 37.  Vision  In its conception, the Gillman Barracks aims to foster cultural exchange and creation, generating discourse and research and showcasing innovative art. The galleries, education and outreach efforts are to establish Singapore as an important centre for contemporary art in Asia. The art cluster is an effort to create vibrant arts scene in Singapore made up of public museums, commercial galleries, non-profit spaces, and major art events such as the Singapore Biennale and Art Stage Singapore. The vision promotes Gillman Barracks as a contemporary arts space ‚Äì to display and sell art ‚Äì while preserving part of the area‚Äôs colonial history. Today, various colonial barracks, including Block 9, are used as art galleries, shops and restaurants. Galleries NTU Centre for Contemporary Art Singapore The galleries have diverse exhibitions by internationally acclaimed artists from Southeast Asia and around the world. Artists include both the established and emerging such as Alfredo and Isabel Aquilizan, Heman Chong, Ai Weiwei, Yayoi Kusama, Yoshitomo Nara and Sebasti√£o Salgado. Tours are also provided by Friends of the Museums, giving the public an insight to the art located within the Barracks, as well as the Barracks' rich history and heritage. \\\\- A changing number of international and local galleries have inhabited the spaces since it was established as an arts precinct. Six of the original 13 galleries remain as of 2020. The current galleries are * Chan + Hori Contemporary * FOST Gallery * Mizuma Gallery * Ota Fine Arts * Partners & Mucciaccia * Richard Koh Fine Art * ShanghART Gallery * Sullivan+Strumpf * Sundaram Tagore Gallery * The Columns Gallery * Yavuz Gallery * Yeo Workshop  Education and outreach  Gillman Barracks houses several art institutions and charities, including: *Nanyang Technological University Centre for Contemporary Arts - devoted to advancing knowledge in contemporary art through its international artist residencies, research and exhibition programmes that will bolster the region‚Äôs visual arts landscape. * Art Outreach - a non-profit art education organisation that promotes art appreciation in Singapore started in 2003.

The evil moon was gone, but Landorin was not free. The Machine still ruled the surface of the planet. The Landorins retreated to the inner core of their world to await their inevitable death. The machines and mutants, however, went on to roam through the deserted ruins of a long-lost paradise in search of the entrance to the secret caves. Before the Landorins retreated, they managed to send a desperate cry for help: A last radio signal floats through the endless reaches of the tri-solar system and off to the farthest reaches of the universe. The cry was heard by a man with the courage to face the hordes and free the last survivors of Landorin, a man on his most dangerous adventure ever, Turrican.  Development and release  Super Turrican for the Nintendo Entertainment System was developed by series creator Manfred Trenz alone and it is based roughly on the first two Turrican games. In a 2006 interview with Retro Gamer, Trenz stated he felt unsatisfied with the final game due to the lack of gameplay elements from earlier entries and same difficulty level as a result from a short development cycle. The NES version of Super Turrican was also the only game in the series scored by Trenz. To compose the soundtrack, he used a sound driver programmed by David Whittaker, which he then edited to use with the game. The final boss originated from Aldynes. Super Turrican for the NES was published only in Europe by Imagineer in 1992 and was never released outside European territories.  Reception  Super Turrican for the Nintendo Entertainment System was met with positive reception from critics since its release.

It is usually expressed as work per unit volume, for example, joules/litre, or as a work rate (power), such as joules/min or equivalent units, as it is not particularly useful without a reference to volume or time. It can be calculated in terms of the pulmonary pressure multiplied by the change in pulmonary volume, or in terms of the oxygen consumption attributable to breathing. In a normal resting state the work of breathing constitutes about 5% of the total body oxygen consumption. It can increase considerably due to illness or constraints on gas flow imposed by breathing apparatus, ambient pressure, or breathing gas composition. Mechanism of breathing The normal relaxed state of the lung and chest is partially empty. Further exhalation requires muscular work. Inhalation is an active process requiring work. Some of this work is to overcome frictional resistance to flow, and part is used to deform elastic tissues, and is stored as potential energy, which is recovered during the passive process of exhalation, Tidal breathing does not require active muscle contraction during exhalation. The required energy is provided by the stored elastic energy. When there is increased gas flow resistance, the optimal respiratory rate decreases. =Work against elastic recoil= This work (generally during the inhalation phase) is stored as potential energy which is recovered during exhalation. =Work against non- elastic resistance= A pressure difference is required to overcome the frictional resistance to gas flow due to viscosity, and to provide non-elastic components of movement of the airway tissues to accommodate pulmonary volume change. Total work done against non elastic forces is 35% of total. Immersion effects The properties of the lung can vary if a pressure differential exists between the breathing gas supply and the ambient pressure on the chest. The relaxed internal pressure in the lungs is equal to the pressure at the mouth, and in the immersed diver, the pressure on the chest may vary from the pressure at the mouth depending on the attitude of the diver in the water. This pressure difference is the static lung load or hydrostatic imbalance. A negative static lung load occurs when the gas supply pressure is lower than the ambient pressure at the chest, and the diver needs to apply more effort to inhale. The small negative pressure differential inside the air passages induces blood engorgement of the distensible lung blood vessels, reducing the compliance of the lung tissue and making the lung stiffer than normal, therefore requiring more muscular effort to move a given volume of gas through the airways. This effect can occur in an upright open-circuit diver, where the chest is deeper than the regulator, and in a rebreather diver if the chest is deeper than the counterlung and will increase the work of breathing. Mechanics Work is defined as a force applied over a distance. The SI unit of work is the Joule, equivalent to a force of 1 Newton exerted along a distance of 1 metre. In gas flow across a constant section this equates to a volume flowing against a pressure:Force = Pressure x Area, and Distance = Volume / Area. When both refer to the same area, Force x Distance = (Pressure x Area) x (Volume/Area) = Pressure x Volume Work = Pressure x Volume and Power = Work / time with SI units for Power: Watts = Joules per second Work of breathing should more accurately be called power of breathing unless referring to the work associated with a specific number of breaths, or a given interval of time. Signs of Increased Work of Breathing Because measuring the work of breathing requires complex instrumentation, measuring it in patients with acute serious illness is difficult and risky. Instead, physicians determine if the work of breathing is increased by gestalt or by examining the patient looking for signs of increased breathing effort. These signs include nasal flaring, the contraction of sternomastoid, and thoraco-abdominal paradox. Underwater breathing apparatus Graph of the breathing resistance of an open-circuit demand regulator. The area of the graph (green) is proportional to the net mechanical work of breathing for a single breathing cycle In the diving industry the performance of breathing apparatus is often referred to as work of breathing. In this context it generally means the work of an average single breath taken through the specified apparatus for given conditions of ambient pressure, underwater environment, flow rate during the breathing cycle, and gas mixture - underwater divers may breathe oxygen-rich breathing gas to reduce the risk of decompression sickness, or gases containing helium to reduce narcotic effects. Helium also has the effect of reducing the work of breathing by reducing density of the mixture, though helium's viscosity is fractionally greater than nitrogen's. Standards for these conditions exist and to make useful comparisons between breathing apparatus they must be tested to the same standard. =Standards for testing underwater breathing apparatus= *EN 250:2014. Respiratory equipment ‚Äì Open-circuit self-contained compressed air diving apparatus ‚Äì Requirements, testing, marking. *EN 14143:2013. Respiratory equipment. Self-contained re-breathing diving apparatus *EN 15333 ‚Äì1: 2008 COR 2009 ‚Äì Respiratory Equipment ‚Äì Open-Circuit Umbilical Supplied Compressed Gas Diving Apparatus ‚Äì Part 1: Demand Apparatus. *BS 8547:2016 defines requirements for demand regulators to be used at depths exceeding 50 m. =Variations and management of work of breathing= Factors which influence the work of breathing of an underwater breathing apparatus include density and viscosity of the gas, flow rates, cracking pressure (the pressure differential required to open the demand valve), and back pressure over exhaust valves. Work of breathing of a diver has a physiological component as well as the equipment component. for a given breathing gas mixture, the density will increase with an increase in depth. A higher gas density requires more effort to accelerate the gas in the transition between inhalation and exhalation. To minimise the work of breathing the flow velocity can be reduced, but this will reduce RMV unless the depth of breathing is increased to compensate. Slow deep breathing improves efficiency of respiration by increasing gas turnover in the alveoli, and exertion must be limited to match the gas transfer possible from the RMV which can be comfortably maintained over long periods. Exceeding this maximum continuous exertion may lead to carbon dioxide buildup, which can cause accelerated breathing rate, with increased turbulence, leading to lower efficiency, reduced RMV and higher work of breathing in a positive feedback loop. At extreme depths this can occur even at relatively low levels of exertion, and it may be difficult or impossible to break the cycle. The resulting stress can be a cause of panic as the perception is of an insufficient gas supply due to carbon dioxide buildup though oxygenation may be adequate. Negative static lung load increases work of breathing and can vary depending on the relative depth of the regulator diaphragm to the lungs in open circuit equipment, and the relative depth of the counterlung to the lungs in a rebreather. Gas density at ambient pressure is a limiting factor on the ability of a diver to effectively eliminate carbon dioxide at depth for a given work of breathing. At increased ambient pressure the increased breathing gas density causes greater airway resistance. Maximum exercise ventilation and maximum voluntary ventilation are reduced as a function of density, which for a given gas mixture is proportional to pressure. Maximum voluntary ventilation is approximated by a square root function of gas density. Exhalation flow rate is limited by effort independent turbulent flow. Once this occurs further attempts to increase flow rate are actively counterproductive and contribute to further accumulation of carbon dioxide. The effects of negative static lung load are amplified by increased gas density. To reduce risk of hypercapnia, divers may adopt a breathing pattern that is slower and deeper than normal rather than fast and shallow, as this gives maximum gas exchange per unit effort by minimising turbulence and dead space effects. =Carbon dioxide retention and toxicity= Carbon dioxide is a product of cell metabolism which is eliminated by gas exchange in the lungs while breathing. The rate of production is variable with exertion, but there is a basic minimum. If the rate of elimination is less than the rate of production, the levels will increase, and produce symptoms of toxicity such as headache, shortness of breath and mental impairment, eventually loss of consciousness, which can lead to drowning. In diving there are factors which increase carbon dioxide production (exertion), and factors which can impair elimination, making divers particularly vulnerable to carbon dioxide toxicity. Oxygen is consumed and carbon dioxide produced in the same quantities underwater as at the surface for the same amount of work, but breathing requires work, and work of breathing can be much greater underwater, and work of breathing is similar to other forms of work in the production of carbon dioxide. The ability of a diver to respond to increases in work of breathing is limited. As work of breathing increases, the additional carbon dioxide produce in doing this work pushes up the need for higher elimination rate, which is proportional to ventilation, in the case of negligible carbon dioxide in the inspired air. Carbon dioxide production by the tissues is a simple function of tissue metabolism and oxygen consumption. The more work done in a tissue, the more oxygen will be consumed and the more carbon dioxide will be produced. Carbon dioxide removal in the alveoli depends on the partial pressure gradient for carbon dioxide diffusion between blood and the alveolar gas. This gradient is maintained by flushing carbon dioxide out of the alveoli during breathing, which depends on replacing air in the alveoli with more carbon dioxide by air with less carbon dioxide. The more air moved in and out of the alveoli during breathing, the more carbon dioxide is flushed out, and the greater the pressure gradient between the venous blood and alveolar gas that drives carbon dioxide diffusion from the blood. Maintenance of the correct carbon dioxide levels is critically dependent on adequate lung ventilation, and there are multiple aspects of diving that can interfere with adequate ventilation of the lungs. =Measurement of underwater breathing apparatus performance= The ANSTI machine is used for automated testing of underwater breathing apparatus.

Rounded ball-shaped succulent plant, that divides to form dense clumps. The resemblance to pebbles and the firmness of its flesh is what got it its name (\\"calculus\\" is Latin for \\"pebble\\"). It produces yellow or orange flowers in autumn, that open at night, and have the aroma of cloves. The ball shape is formed from the plant's leaf-pair having fused entirely, leaving only a tiny slit at the top, where the flower and the succeeding leaf pair pushes through. The new leaf-pair forms inside the ball. When it is ready, the ball of the old leaf-pair shrivels and dries out, before it is split open by the new leaf-pair ball. The epidermis (and therefore the dried leaf sheath too) is thick and strong. The plants are extremely long-lived, and have been kept in captivity for over 50 years. They offset slowly, forming clumps. =Subspecies= * C. calculus subsp. calculus. The type subspecies has round uniformly grey-green heads, smooth sheaths, and offsets to form mounds. * C. calculus subsp. vanzylii (Lavis) S.A.Hammer. This form has smaller, paler, less scented flowers, marked sheaths, a more variable colour, and a more depressed, flattish, globose shape. Distribution Conophytums are all indigenous to the winter rainfall regions of southern Africa. Conophytum calculus subsp. calculus is restricted to the \\"Knersvlakte\\" region, in the far north-west of the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Here it is confined to the area between Bitterfontein and Holsrivier. The subspecies vanzylii occurs over 100 km to the north, in the western part of Bushmanland. The \\"Knersvlakte\\" is a region of white, quartz pebble-fields. Therefore in spite of the semi-arid climate and desiccating sun, the soil is typically quite cool (due to the reflective white of the quartz pebble-fields). The clove-scented flowers are pollinated by moths at night. Cultivation This species is popular in cultivation. However it requires much bright light, very well-drained sand, and specific winter-watering conditions. They thrive in pots, in a mildly-acidic, coarse, extremely well-drained, soil-sand mix. In winter they can be lightly watered (from spring right through to autumn) and given bright morning light with afternoon shade. In summer they go dormant, and should be kept mostly dry and can even be partially shaded. The plant produces obvious wrinkles when it requires more water. It cracks and splits open when it receives too much water. It elongates and keeps multiple leaf pairs if it does not receive enough light. They can be propagated by cuttings, subdivision of clumps, or by seed.Conophytum calculus - Information page References Further reading  External links calculus Category:Endemic flora of South Africa Category:Flora of the Cape Provinces Category:Succulent plants Category:Taxa named by Alwin Berger Category:Taxa named by N.

The main sandy beach length of Monolithi from Mytikas to Kastrosykia is 22 km. The Ionian coast are wide historical creation that starts from the middle Pleistocene (600,000 years BC). The Pleistocene period has broad course of 10,000 BC to 2,000,000 BC Geologically, the Ionian coast from Preveza to Parga show upward movements, while the east area of Amvrakikos marked slow precipitation which is substituted by the silting of the rivers Arachthos and Louros. At Agios Georgios of Lygia there are tufts of coral at a depth of 1,5m from the sea on a cohesive conglomerates. The dating of samples from the corals of Lygia, the Jotl 1999, the method U / Th, gave age around 13,000 years BC. In place Rider Kastrosykia at an altitude of 40m identified small size marine sand beaches and age was determined by the method of thermoluminescence at about 124,000 years BC. Map Plan and Tourism Monolithi beach amenities The beach Monolithi is an open circular arc segment (sector) with a southwest-facing slope about 10-20 degrees. Starting from Komarus cape in Mytikas village in the municipality of Preveza. From there begins the so-called aesthetic Monolithi forest which is about 8 km and a width of 200m, nominated by the coastline and the National Road Preveza- Igoumenitsa. This zone is Archaeological Zone \\"Alpha\\" and no construction activity is allowed because of Ancient Nikopolis. It follows the stretch of beach in Kanali village in Preveza municipality. At the 10th kilometer of the route is the complex Nicopolis Club built by the decorator Leandros Spartiotis in 1992 as a copy of Ancient Nicopolis. Here are the beaches of Kanali Camping and Then hotels in Kanali beach(Kanali Hotel, Niko Hotel, Katerina Hotel, Theoxenia Hotel, etc.) and the newly constructed Kanali Beach.

Description A dense bed of individual Conophytum burgeri plants, propagated from seed. An onion- shaped, single-bodied, succulent plant, it is possibly the most unusual of all the species of the genus Conophytum. It has a tiny fissure at the top of its body. Its epidermis is smooth, shiny and translucent, and its colour is light green to purple. It is slow-growing and sometimes subdivides through a gradual process over several years, to form two or even three heads. It varies in size and can reach the size of a small onion. Unlike most other Conophytums, it grows in a region of spring and early summer rainfall. However its habitat is extremely arid, and the plant may rely mainly on the copious winter fogs and dew that condenses on the rocks where it grows. When dormant, its outer covering dries into a thin, white, persistent leaf-sheath. It produces a purple flower, in early autumn (April‚ÄìMay in South Africa), with the aroma of honey. The flowers open briefly in the late afternoon, has over 5 sepals and a long stigma (over 10mm). =Relatives and distinguishing features= Some of its closest relatives such as Conophytum ratum, Conophytum achabense, Conophytum hammeri and Conophytum subterraneum do have a similar cone shape. Conophytum burgeri can be distinguished from these by its long stigma (over 10mm) and by its epidermis becoming purple to red in direct sunlight. (Conophytum subterraneum for example, has a stigma under 7mm long, and remains a green colour). Conophytum ratum has a larger fissure (3-4mm) that is embedded or sunken in the body. Conophytum achabense has only 4 sepals, and Conophytum hammeri has an obscure translucent window at its apex. Distribution This species is endemic to Bushmanland in the Northern Cape Province, South Africa, where it is known from the mines of the Aggeneys valley (between Sprinbok and Pofadder). Here it grows on high, open, raised, exposed flats, in rocky clay soil, which is strewn with white quartz pebbles that keep the soil relatively cool. Aggeneys was the farm of the Burger family, and it was named after the farmer Willem Burger, who noticed the unusual plant and contacted the botanist H.C. Kennedy.Conophytum burgeri - distribution Cultivation =Water= The desert habitat of this species receives its sparse rainfall mainly in Spring and early Summer, with very little rainfall in the winter. The plants may receive water from dew or condensation in the winter, because in cultivation Conophytum burgeri can be treated as a winter-rainfall species, like most other Conophytum species. All Conophytums have an annual growing period when they receive some water, and a dry dormancy period. In their growing period the soil must always dry out completely between waterings. In their dormancy they can be left dry and only given water if they visibly start to shrivel. Alternatively, Conophytum burgeri can be given water occasionally throughout the year, at intervals of a week or two. It shrivels when it needs more water; and it splits open when it receives too much. Seeds can be sown in early Summer, and given light watering regularly for a year, before the seedlings begin their annual dormancy periods. =Soil= They grow well in shallow pots, and require extremely well-drained soil. A coarse or porous shale mixture, with little to no organic component, best approximates their natural soils in habitat. =Sunlight and temperatures= They require direct and plentiful sunlight. It can be given slight shelter at the peak of the hottest summer days. A cooler temperature at night and good ventilation is also beneficial for the plants.Conophytum burgeri - Information page References Further reading *Hammer,S.(2002) Dumpling and his wife: New views of the genus Conophytum EAE Creative Colour Ltd. . *Hammer,S.(1993) The genus Conophytum : A Conograph Succulent Plant Publications, Pretoria. . *National Botanical Institute of South Africa.(1993) List of Southern African Succulent Plants Umdaus Press.

Around 1823 the motet was published as a composition by Johann Christoph Bach, Johann Sebastian's father's cousin, after which its attribution became a matter of discussion among scholars. The motet consists of two movements: the oldest extant manuscript of its first movement was partly written by Johann Sebastian, in 1712, or early 1713 at the latest. Its second movement is without doubt a chorale harmonisation by Johann Sebastian composed before , when a version of this setting was copied in the Dietel manuscript, but it is uncertain when, and by whom, it was added to the first movement. Notwithstanding an 18th-century catalogue entry apparently describing the motet as a work for four voices with basso continuo, it is transmitted as an a cappella composition for eight voices without any form of instrumental accompaniment. The text of its first movement consists of a dictum, , and the third stanza of the Lutheran hymn \\"Warum betr√ºbst du dich, mein Herz\\". Such a mixture of scripture and chorale texts was common for motets of the generation before Johann Sebastian, as also its eight-part setting. The hymn tune of the chorale, Zahn No. 1689a, appears as a cantus firmus sung by the soprano. Over-all the complexity and style of this movement's setting appears closer to similar works by a young Johann Sebastian than to somewhat less comparable works by a mature Johann Christoph. The closing chorale, a four-part setting of the \\"Warum betr√ºbst du dich, mein Herz\\" hymn tune, has the two last stanzas of that hymn as text. Leipzig performances of Bach's motets usually closed on the last stanzas of a hymn, so it can not be excluded that the chorale was added to the motet by Bach, some time after his appointment as in that city in 1723. The lingering attribution issue complicated the motet's reception history. In Leipzig, the motet was performed as Johann Sebastian's from the 18th to well into the 19th century. In the second half of the 18th century, Johann Sebastian's son Carl Philipp Emanuel, apparently not assigning the composition to any specific member of the Bach family, joined the early manuscript of its first movement to the (old-Bachian archive, ABA), a collection of mostly 17th-century compositions by his ancestors. Both the 19th-century (BGA) and the 1954‚Äì2007 New Bach Edition (NBE) published the motet, while expressing reserves about its authenticity. Containing several motets by Johann Christoph, Max Schneider's 1935 edition of the ABA pieces did not include Ich lasse dich nicht. Complete recordings of Johann Sebastian's motets are issued with or without .  History and context  Bach wrote his motets in the tradition of the Evangelienmotetten (motets on gospel texts) of the 17th century by composers such as Melchior Franck, Melchior Vulpius and Heinrich Sch√ºtz. When he composed these works, music without an independent orchestra on texts limited to biblical words and a chorale without contemporary poetry, the genre was already out of fashion, but there was evidently a demand for such works at funerals, a ceremony for which at least some of Bach's motets were written. There is scholarly debate about the exact number of motets attributable to Bach, and, as in some cases the circumstances of the first performance are not known, nor their function.Wyant Morton. Questions of authenticity in three motets attributed to Johann Sebastian Bach. The University of Arizona, 1992. Johann Christoph Bach Ich lasse dich nicht, then known as only the first movement, was attributed in the 19th century to both Johann Sebastian Bach and Johann Christoph Bach, his father's cousin. In the Bach-Ausgabe, the editor Franz W√ºllner described the piece as \\"one of the most beautiful works of German church music\\" but not \\"authentic\\", therefore gave Johann Christoph Bach as the composer. When Wolfgang Schmieder created the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis in 1950, he followed W√ºllner, placing the motet in the appendix and assigning \\"presumably by Johann Christoph Bach\\". When Konrad Ameln edited Bach's motets for the Neue Bach-Ausgabe, he consequently omitted it, but it was printed in the appendix. Other authorities had doubted this attribution, for example Philipp Spitta, who in the first edition of his Bach biography mentioned Johann Christoph Bach as the composer, but in the second added that \\"the source evidence didn't permit a definite attribution\\". Ich lasse dich nicht in two movements was found, written partly in Bach's hand, in the Altbachisches Archiv, a collection of music of the Bach family which the Bach scholar Christoph Wolff rediscovered in Kiev in 1999. Bach scholars now assume that J. S. Bach composed the first movement, possibly during his Weimar period around 1712. The chorale is a transcription of one of his organ pieces and was possibly added in the 19th century. John Eliot Gardiner, who recorded Bach motets including this one in 2011, comments on the authorship: The closing chorale was not part of the score but appeared first in the first print of the motet in 1802 by Johann Gottfried Schicht, also a Thomaskantor. He found the setting in Bach's chorales collected by Carl Philip Emanuel Bach and Johann Philipp Kirnberger in 1787, transposed it from A minor to F minor and adjusted the time to the motet.  Text, scoring and structure  The text for the first movement of the motet is a verse taken from the Book of Genesis and the account of Jacob's return to Canaan, just before he is due to meet his brother Esau from whose anger he had fled many years before, after tricking his father Isaac into blessing him with the blessing belonging to the firstborn (). At night Jacob is approached by a mysterious figure who engages him in a wrestling match in which Jacob prevails, although an injury received during the fight results in a lifelong limp. Jacob insists on being blessed by the man, thought to be a theophany, before he lets go of him. The motet for double choir is followed by the third stanza of the hymn \\"\\" by Erasmus Alberus. Bach structured the movement in F minor in two sections and scored it for double chorus, SATB ‚Äì SATB and unspecified instruments playing colla parte. In the second section, the choir is no longer divided, the soprano sings the cantus firmus of the chorale, while the lower voices engage in imitative polyphony. The added chorale in the same key is the eighth stanza from \\"\\", \\", set for four parts. It is one of Bach's chorale settings, BWV 421, and was possibly added in the 19th century.

Ham was born on 23 August 1847 in Trent Port (modern Trenton, Ontario) in the Province of Canada to Eliza Anne Eleanor Clute and John Vandal Ham, a country doctor of Loyalist stock who later took up law. Ham rejected his father's wish that he become a lawyer to pursue journalism, first at the Whitby Chronicle in 1865. He became editor of the Whitby Gazette, where he capitalized on interest in the Franco-Prussian War by issuing it as a four-page daily in mid-1870. He commissioned a young John Wilson Bengough to provide a serialized novel for it, whose popular reception encouraged Bengough to devote himself to a journalism career. After numerous odd jobs and newspaper work in Guelph and Uxbridge Ham moved to Manitoba in 1875 and obtained work as a compositor at the Manitoba Free Press, where he began writing anonymous humour articles. The editor William Luxton soon promoted him to the editorial department where he later became city editor. In Shannonville on 24 December 1870 Ham married Martha Helen Blow, with whom he had two daughters and three sons. Ham launched the Winnipeg Daily Tribune in October 1879, and continued as managing editor when it merged with Daily Times a few months later. He found newspaper work hard on his health and took up a post as registrar of deeds for the town of Selkirk in 1882, which he held until the outbreak of the North-West Rebellion in 1885. His articles as a war correspondent were widely quoted and he was admitted to the Parliamentary Press Gallery in Ottawa in 1886. He became a friend of Wilfrid Laurier. Ham was active in Winnipeg society. He served as a school trustee in the 1880s, alderman for Ward 1 of the Winnipeg City Council as in 1883, 1884, and 1887, and commissioner for the federal McCarthy Act for liquor licensing. In July 1891 Ham met Canadian Pacific Railway president William Cornelius Van Horne, who immediately hired him as general passenger agent. The job took Ham to Montreal, and two years later he became a journalist for the Canadian Pacific Press Bureau. His work promoting the CPR and tourism made him well known throughout Canada. the Canadian Women's Press Club made him honorary president in 1904 after he secured free transportation for sixteen Canadian women journalists to cover the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. In 1913 he was appointed special assistant to the CPR president, a post in which he lobbied for the company. He continued with the CPR until his death in Montreal on 16 April 1926. He was buried in Whitby.

The venue primarily served the African-American population in the then heavily segregated Southern United States. History Frank G. Painia (1907-1972) established a barbershop on LaSalle Street in the late 1930s. He began selling refreshments to workers at the nearby Magnolia Housing Project, and then expanded his premises to include a bar and hotel, which opened as the Dew Drop Inn in April 1939. During World War II, Painia also started booking bands for concerts in the city, and frequently had the musicians staying at his hotel. He started putting on entertainment in the hotel lounge, before developing it further into a dancehall, which opened in 1945. Originally published as cover story in archived issue of defunct New Orleans music magazine as: Nicknamed \\"the Groove Room\\", the Dew Drop Inn was reported in October 1945 by the Louisiana Weekly to be \\"New Orleans' swankiest nightclub\\", and began featuring visiting musicians such as Joe Turner, the Sweethearts of Rhythm, Amos Milburn, Lollypop Jones, Clarence \\"Gatemouth\\" Brown, Ivory Joe Hunter, Chubby Newsom, The Ravens, Big Maybelle, and Cecil Gant. The resident bandleaders were local musicians Dave Bartholomew and Edgar Blanchard, and Painia discovered and helped establish local stars including Larry Darnell, Tommy Ridgley, Earl King, Huey \\"Piano\\" Smith, and Allen Toussaint. In November 1952, Frank Painia, together with Hollywood film actor Zachary Scott and his friends, were arrested and charged with disturbing the peace, following a complaint to the New Orleans Police Department that \\"Negroes and whites were being served together,\\" which was technically illegal at the time. The charges were later dismissed, and Painia continued to challenge the constitutionality of the law, filing suit against the city just before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forced its repeal. The club continued to attract star performers in the 1950s and 1960s, including Ray Charles, James Brown, Sam Cooke, Ike & Tina Turner, Otis Redding, Solomon Burke, and Little Richard, who wrote a song, \\"Dew Drop Inn\\", about the venue. The club's MCs included blues singer Joseph \\"Mr. Google Eyes\\" August, and drag queen Patsy Valdeler (born Irving Ale, 1921-1982), who organised and hosted the annual New Orleans Gay Ball, held at the club every Halloween. The club's popularity declined from the mid-1960s, after the repeal of segregation laws allowed other clubs to open, and Painia suffered from ill health. Though the hotel continued to function, the floor shows became irregular and eventually ceased. Frank Painia died from cancer in July 1972, and the restaurant and bar were leased to new occupants. The building fell into increasing disrepair, but remained in the ownership of the Painia family. It was flooded and further damaged as a result of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Current position In 2010, the building was named by the Louisiana Landmark Society as one of the city's most important endangered buildings, and \\"an iconic example of the importance of music venues to New Orleans culture.\\" Later in 2010 the site was designated a historic landmark by the New Orleans Historic District Landmarks Commission. A campaign to raise $3.5 million to restore the Dew Drop Inn as a nightclub-hotel-restaurant and training center was started by Painia's grandson Kenneth Jackson in 2015 with support from Harmony Neighborhood Development and the Tulane School of Architecture. After failing to gain financial support for development the property was listed for sale in 2018.

Main information The trains have been running between Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod since 1 June 2015 and between Moscow and Berlin since 17 December 2016. On the Moscow ‚Äì Nizhny Novgorod line, they make 1 to 3 stops, linking the two cities in 3 hours 35 minutes (when they only stop in Vladimir). The cars are pulled by an EP20 locomotive. In 2016, Russian Railways also connected Moscow and Berlin using the Strizh. The travel time between the two cities is a little over 20 hours. For 2018 FIFA World Cup, Russian Railways purchased wide-bodyshell Talgo trains for other services. The cars will be pulled by EP1 locomotives in east of Mariinsk, while EP20 in west of Mariinsk. In Kazakhstan, wide-bodyshell Talgo trains have operated since 2013, built by Tulpar-Talgo. In 2016, wide-bodyshell Talgo trains underwent trial runs in India. Lines The Strizh train currently operates on two lines: * Moscow ‚Äì Nizhny Novgorod (via Vladimir, Kovrov and Dzerzhinsk) * Moscow ‚Äì Berlin (via Smolensk, Minsk, Brest and Warsaw) = Moscow ‚Äì Nizhny Novgorod line = The Strizh trains run between Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod since 1 June 2015. They make 1 to 3 stops on the line: in Dzerzhinsk, Kovrov and Vladimir. The travel time between Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod is between 3 hours 35 minutes, when it stops only in Vladimir, and up to 3 hours 50 minutes with 3 stops. The cars are pulled by an EP20 locomotive. Another fast train, the Lastochka (\\"Swallow\\") operates on the same line but makes 6 stops: in Orekhovo-Zuyevo, Vladimir, Kovrov, Vyazniki, Gorokhovets and Dzerzhinsk, travelling between Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod in 4 hours 6 minutes. = Moscow ‚Äì Berlin line = The Strizh trains run between Moscow and Berlin since 17 December 2016. The length of the line is 1,896 km. The initial schedule was 2 trains per week, between Moscow Kurskaya and Berlin Ostbahnhof, linking both stations in 20 hours 14 minutes westbound (instead of 24h 49min previously) and 20 hours 35 minutes eastbound (compared with 25h 56min previously). The trains leave from Moscow on Saturdays and Sundays, and from Berlin on Sundays and Mondays. They make intermediate stops in Smolensk, Orsha, Minsk, Brest, Terespol, Warsaw, Poznan, Rzepin and Frankfurt (Oder). The Strizh trains to/from Berlin leave and arrive at the station Moscow Smolenskaya (also called Moscow Belorussky) instead of Moscow Kurskaya. Between June 2017 and June 2019, some modernization work on a 100 km railway section between Warsaw and Poznan will force the trains to take a detour which will make the trip longer. After this renovation the speed limit will be 160 km/h on all the length of this section. Moscow and Berlin are also connected once weekly by the non- Strizh trains from the Moscow‚ÄìParis line, which depart from Moscow on each Wednesday evening and from Berlin on each Saturday morning.

St. Nicholas Orphanage, established by Caritas in Novosibirsk, Russia. Caritas Internationalis is a confederation of 165 Catholic relief, development and social service organizations operating in over 200 countries and territories worldwide. Collectively and individually, their missions are to work to build a better world, especially for the poor and oppressed.Caritas Internationalis The first Caritas organization was established by Lorenz Werthmann on 9 November 1897 in Germany. Other national Caritas organizations were soon formed in Switzerland (1901) and the United States (Catholic Charities, 1910). History In July 1924, during the international Eucharistic Congress in Amsterdam, 60 delegates from 22 countries formed a conference, with headquarters at Caritas Switzerland in Luzern. In 1928, the conference became known as Caritas Catholica. The delegates met every two years until the outbreak of the Second World War when all activities came to a standstill. Work resumed in 1947, with the approval of the Secretariat of State, and two conferences were convened in Luzern to help coordinate efforts and collaboration. Caritas was given a further endorsement when the Secretariat of State entrusted it with the official representation of all welfare organizations at the international level, especially at the United Nations. The Holy Year in 1950 saw the beginning of a union of Caritas organizations. Following a suggestion by Monsignor Montini, then Substitute Secretary of State, and later Pope Paul VI, a study week, with participants from 22 countries, was held in Rome to examine the problems of Christian Caritas work. As a result, the decision was made to set up an international conference of Roman Catholic charities. In December 1951, upon approval of the statutes by the Holy See, the first constitutive General Assembly of Caritas Internationalis took place. Founding members came from Caritas organizations in 13 countries: Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. The Church describes Caritas as its official voice ‚Äúin relation to its teachings in the area of charity work‚Äù. In 1954, the Confederation changed its name to Caritas Internationalis to reflect the international presence of Caritas members on every continent. As of 2015, the Confederation has 164 members working in over 200 countries and territories. Its General Secretariat is located in the Palazzo San Callisto, Vatican City. The current president is Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle and the Secretary General is Michel Roy. After World War Two, Caritas was implicated in assisting Franz Stangl, a supervisor at the Hartheim Euthanasia Centre which was the early Nazi euthanasia programme responsible for the deaths of over 70,000 mentally ill or physically deformed people in Germany, in his escape to Syria. After Franz made his way to Rome from Linz, the Caritas relief agency provided him with a Red Cross passport and a boat ticket to Syria.Levy, Alan (2006) [1993].

The third son in a large family, he ultimately succeeded to the family estate of Wishaw. Hamilton was a reputed antiquarian and genealogist, praised by George Crawfurd, and an acknowledged supporter of Alexander Nisbet's System of Heraldry (1722). He died at an advanced age in 1724, having been born in the 1630s. Works Hamilton left in manuscript an Account of the Shyres of Renfrew and Lanark, which went to the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh. In 1832 it was published as one of the volumes of the Maitland Club, edited by William Motherwell, and consists of brief topographical descriptions of the principal castles and mansions in Renfrewshire and Lanarkshire, with genealogical information on local families. Family Hamilton married, first, in 1660, his first cousin, Anne, daughter of John Hamilton of Udston, with whom he had six sons and a daughter. Secondly, he married in 1676 Mary, eldest daughter of the Hon. Sir Charles Erskine, son of John, 7th Earl of Mar, by whom he had five sons and six daughters. Of those: *William Hamilton, the third son of the marriage, was the father of William Gerard Hamilton; and *Alexander, the fifth son, was grandfather to William Richard Hamilton. The Belhaven title and descent Robert, the second son of the first marriage, died during his father's life; his son William inherited Wishaw on the death of his grandfather. By an entail executed by John Hamilton, 2nd Lord Belhaven, Robert, son of this William Hamilton, should have succeeded to the title Lord Belhaven and Stenton. He did not assume the dignity, however, and his eldest son, who claimed the title, became seventh Lord Belhaven. His son Robert Montgomery Hamilton (1793‚Äì1868) was eighth Lord Belhaven and Stenton. The title was then adjudged to a distant relation, who became James Hamilton, 9th Lord Belhaven and Stenton, by the House of Lords in 1875.

He inherited a glass-making business from his father. He was elected as MP for Dudley in 1834, defeating the sitting candidate, Sir John Campbell. He thus became the second person to represent Dudley at the UK Parliament. He retained his Parliamentary seat in three subsequent elections, stepping down in 1844 after having financial problems. He served as Sheriff of Worcestershire in 1811 and he was appointed as captain of the Himley Troop of the Staffordshire Yeomanry in 1819, in which he served for more than twenty years. One of his daughters married the brother of Baron Ward, the Lord of Dudley Castle. He was declared bankrupt shortly before his death in 1858. Biography Stone Street Square, Dudley: the site of the glassworks built by Abiathar Hawkes and later owned and operated by Thomas Hawkes Thomas Hawkes was born in 1778, the son of Abiathar and Mary Hawkes. His father was involved in the glass industry and had founded the Dudley Flint Glassworks situated in King Street, Dudley. Abiathar Hawkes built a new glassworks on the corner of Stone Street and Priory Street in the early 1780s. A price list issued in 1794 indicates that Thomas was already active in his father's firm at this date. Abiathar Hawkes died on 17 January 1800, leaving his glass business to two of his sons, Thomas and George Wright. Thomas Hawkes became a large scale glass manufacturer in his own right in the town of Dudley trading as Thomas Hawkes and Co. On 26 February 1810, Hawkes was promoted from major to lieutenant-colonel in the Dudley Volunteer Infantry. In 1811, Hawkes served as Sheriff of Worcestershire. On 2 April 1812, Hawkes convened a public meeting in the town of Dudley in order to petition parliament requesting free trade with the East Indies. In 1814 he married Alice Anna Blackburne, daughter of John Blackburne of Hawford House, Worcester and of Wavertree Hall, Lancashire. John Blackburne had been Mayor of Liverpool in 1788 and owned land and had mining interests and a saltworks in Lancashire. As Alice was his only daughter, most of this property was inherited by Mr and Mrs Hawkes on Blackburne's death in 1826. The couple went on to have a large family including at least five daughters. On 25 October 1816, Thomas and George Wright presented a \\"beautiful glass vase\\" on the occasion of laying the foundation stone of St Thomas' Church, Dudley. Inside the vase were placed \\"several medals commemorative of remarkable recent public events\\" and the vase itself placed in a recess in a stone block and incorporated in the wall of the church. In 1816, Hawkes was listed as a magistrate for Staffordshire, residing at Himley. In a commercial directory published in 1818, Thomas Hawkes & Co. is listed as a cut-glass manufacturer based at Stone Street, Dudley. In the same year, Thomas Hawkes was listed as residing at Himley in Staffordshire. On 29 December 1819, Thomas Hawkes became a captain in the Himley Troop of the Queen's Own Royal Regiment of Staffordshire Yeomanry. In 1821, he attended the festivities at Dudley to celebrate the coronation of King George IV, when \\"Captain Hawkes, with the Himley and Enville Troop of Yeomanry, was met with a brass band of music by the principal gentlemen and escorted to the Town Hall.\\" Hawkes served as captain of this Troop until at least 1840, although in 1843 his position was taken by the Hon. Dudley Ward. George Wright Hawkes, Thomas's brother and business partner died in 1821 at Dudley, aged 40. By this time, a younger brother, Roger Wright Hawkes, had joined the business. In July 1826, the Himley Troop of the Staffordshire Yeomanry were called out when disturbances were expected due to the wages of Dudley and Tipton colliers being reduced. According to the records of the Staffordshire Yeomanry: \\"it was thought necessary to read the riot act, which was done amidst the shouts of the colliers, followed by a shower of stones, by one of which Captain Hawkes was struck on the face, and several of the Yeomen were also wounded\\". In the general elections of 1830 and 1831, Hawkes stood for Parliament for the constituency of Stafford, losing both times. after the 1830 election, Hawkes was given a dinner at the George Inn in Stafford with the mayor presiding to thank him for his gentlemanly conduct during the election period. He was presented with an inscribed tureen at the occasion. Thomas Hawkes was listed as being a magistrate of \\"Stourbridge and its vicinity\\" in 1830. In 1834, Hawkes helped establish the Dudley and West Bromwich Banking Company and became the Chairman of the company. In 1834 he challenged Sir John Campbell (one of his opponents at the Stafford elections of 1830 and 1831) at a by- election to become MP for Dudley. Campbell had succeeded in becoming the first member of parliament for Dudley in modern history when he won the seat at the general election in 1832. However, when subsequently appointed as Attorney General, a by-election was called (as was the practice then), which took place on 27 February 1834. Thomas Hawkes won the seat with a majority of 68. The result provoked considerable disorder in the town. According to a local chronicler: \\"towards the close of the poll, (4 o‚Äôclock) when it became evident that Sir John was beaten, a serious riot arose in the town and it was deemed expedient by the Justices to read the Riot Act, and send off to Birmingham for military assistance; the Dragoons arrived in hot haste, but not before much mischief and violence had been done to both property and persons\\". C.F.G Clarke quotes a rhyme by Dudley poet Ben Boucher on the subject of the election: > Hawkes to Cape‚Äîll gave a note, > And for five pounds bought his vote; > He therefore thus did change his coat > And to the Tories gave his vote. Thomas Hawkes subsequently stood and won the seat in 1835, 1837 and 1841. He represented the Conservative Party. In 1837, it was reported that he commanded a troop of yeomanry. In 1844, he left Parliament by accepting the Chiltern Hundreds. In 1835 a trade directory listed his glass business as being based in Stone Street, Dudley and at Queen Street, London. Thomas Hawkes entered into a copartnership with another glass-maker, William Greathead, in 1836. The agreement was for a term of 7 years with management in the hands of William Greathead. Trading was to be under the name Hawkes and Co. Now a hotel, Himley House was once the residence of Thomas Hawkes In 1838, Hawkes was stated to be living at Himley House, Himley. In 1841, in addition to his glass business, he was said to be \\"extensively engaged in mercantile and mining pursuits in Worcestershire and Lancashire\\" as well as being an honorary director of the Scottish Union Fire and Life Insurance Company and a director of the General Life and Invalid Assurance Association. He was also at this time a magistrate in Worcestershire and Staffordshire. On 24 June 1841 his eldest daughter, Mary, married Robert Rising of Worcester. In April 1842, it was announced that the workers at the Dudley glassmaking business had been given a month's notice to leave and that the Dudley premises would close. In May 1842, the partnership between Thomas Hawkes and William Greathead, which ran the glass business in Dudley, was dissolved. On 6 June 1842, an auction was held at Dudley of the stock and equipment of Messrs. Hawkes and Co. The announcement of the auction stated that Mr. Hawkes was retiring from the glass business. In May 1843, it was reported that it was expected that Hawkes would give up his parliamentary seat. Hawkes was stated to be residing in Nice at this time. In the same month he sold Wavertree Hall to the Liverpool Corporation for a sum of ¬£10,000. On 17 October 1843, Thomas's third daughter, Eleanor-Lucy, married the Hon. Humble-Dudley Ward, the younger brother of the Earl of Dudley. The marriage took place at the residence of the British Ambassador in Florence and Thomas Hawkes was stated to have given an elegant dejeuner on the occasion. In 1844 he gave up his business activities after a creditor sued him successfully for a sum of ¬£10,934. On 2 August of the same year, Hawkes gave up his parliamentary seat by accepting the Chiltern Hundreds. According to an article in the Daily News of December 1, 1849, \\"the pressure of pecuniary embarrassments obliged him, in 1844, to go abroad, with a view to repair his fortunes\\". Thomas's second daughter, Alice Anna Catherine, married Octavius Warre Malet on 24 June 1852 at the British Consulate, Cologne. Thomas's wife, Alice Anna, died at Trouville Sur Mer in France on 7 October 1853. On the marriage of his fourth daughter, Maria Elizabeth, to John Pollard Willoughby in 1854, Thomas Hawkes was stated to be residing at Barnes in Surrey. Hawkes's fifth daughter, Henrietta Dorothy, married Henry Blundell Leigh in 1855. In 1857, Hawkes was arrested over the ¬£10,000 unpaid debt and held in the Queen's Prison. Here he applied for an adjudication of bankruptcy against himself and on 23 June 1857, Thomas Hawkes was declared bankrupt. Thomas Hawkes died on 3 December 1858 at the age of 80 at Brighton and was buried at Himley On Wednesday 8 December 1858 shortly before the burial, the Mayor of Dudley, Mr E.Hollier, issued the following proclamation to the townspeople: Thomas Hawkes was buried at St Michael's Church, Himley > THE MAYOR begs to apprize his fellow-townsmen that the remains of their > formerly much respected Member, THOMAS HAWKES, Esq., will be conveyed > through the Town for INTERMENT AT HIMLEY, on FRIDAY Morning next, and, as he > thinks it may be desirable that some mark of respect should be shewn towards > his memory by the PARTIAL CLOSING of their respective Establishments on the > Morning of that day, he will be happy to meet those who accord with this > desire at the OLD TOWN HALL, on THURSDAY Evening next, at SEVEN o‚Äôclock, to > arrange accordingly. The Stone Street glassworks had not operated since the early 1840s but the buildings remained until demolition in 1886. An archeological excavation of the site was carried out in 2003.

Matsumoto Masanobu's (Bizen no Kami was a court title) birth date is uncertain, but is believed to have been around 1467. His family was one of four families, the Kashima Shiten'≈ç (litt. the 4 Deva Kings), whose hereditary duties included the upkeep of the Kashima Shrine in Kashima, Ibaraki. The three others were called Ogano, Gakuga and Yoshikawa. He remained in the Kashima area for his whole life, which may explain his lack of fame compared to that of his students Tsukahara Bokuden and Kamiizumi Nobutsuna, both of whom travelled extensively. According to one legend, Matsumoto received the secrets of swordsmanship in a dream from the Kashima Shrine's tutelary deity, Takemikazuchi-no-mikoto. Another legend tells that he learned his sword techniques from Iizasa Ienao, founder of the Tenshin Sh≈çden Katori Shint≈ç-ry≈´. He subsequently founded the Kashima Shin-ry≈´ (\\"Divinely- inspired Kashima School\\"). In this endeavour he was assisted by Kunii Kagetsugu from Shirakawa, a student of Nen-ry≈´ who had travelled to Kashima on a pilgrimage and had received his own revelation from Takemikazuchi. Matsumoto's most significant contribution to sword fighting was the hitotsu no tachi or technique, which was adopted by both Bokuden and Nobutsuna and became an important element of their respective schools. The technique involves moving within range of an opponent's sword and allowing him to attack, but delivering a counter-strike as soon as the attack is initiated. It requires extremely precise timing. Although he never engaged in any known one-on-one duel, Matsumoto took part in more than twenty battles. During his military career, he killed over 100 men. One source (quoted Legacies of the Sword: The Kashima-Shinry≈´ and Samurai Martial Culture) claims that Matsumoto Masanobu, in three different battles, took more than 70 heads. He is thought to have died in battle at around the age of 67, although sources vary on the exact date and manner of his death. Some sources indicate that he was killed in a spear fight at the Battle of Tamakagahara in 1524, others that he was fatally wounded by an arrow during a different battle in 1543. The Matsumoto family records indicate that he died in 1537.

It was built in the 1680s to a design by S√©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban, and it is now in good condition. History Fort Lupin was built on the southern bank of the Charente, and commanded the approach to Rochefort and its arsenal along with Fort Lapointe on the opposite bank of the river. The first proposal to build a fortification in the area was made in 1672 by the engineer La Favolliere, and it was eventually built between 1683 and 1686. The fort's initial design was made by Fran√ßois Ferry, but the plans were extensively modified by S√©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban, who reduced its size due to a lack of funds. The fort consists of a semi-circular gun battery ringed by a parapet with twenty-two embrasures. A tour-r√©duit and two blockhouses are located at the gorge. The fort is further protected by a ditch, a covertway and a glacis. Fort Lupin was never attacked, and it never fired its guns in anger. It was decommissioned in the late 19th century, and was subsequently abandoned and vandalized.

She had a long career as an architect in Illinois, especially around Evanston and Glencoe. Early life and education Bertha Louise Yerex was born in Newaygo, Michigan, in 1892, the middle of three daughters of Charles Napier Yerex and Emma Retta (Giles) Yerex. Her father was the town's train station master and telegrapher. She received a teaching certificate from Eastern Michigan University in 1911 and went on to teach at the local elementary school for two years. Prompted by an aunt who taught her to design quilts, as well as by her own mathematical inclinations, she took a correspondence course in mechanical drafting. This led her to decide on a career in architecture. She entered the University of Michigan College of Architecture and Design in 1914. She later recalled that the dean had initially told her she would not be welcome in the program, but she enrolled anyway. While at the university, she was a cofounder of the T-Square Society, a student club for women engineers and architects. When America entered World War I and most of her male classmates enlisted in the army, she took a leave from the college to support the war effort and so that she would be able to graduate with her classmates. During her two-year hiatus from school, she worked in Detroit, Michigan, as the Dodge Brothers Company's first woman draughtsperson. After the war, she returned to her studies and in 1920 became the college's first women architecture graduate. In 1919, she married Lloyd E. Whitman, with whom she went on to have two children, Suzanne and Charles. Career Whitman moved to the Chicago area in 1921. She initially had difficulty finding work in Chicago architecture offices, even as a draughtsperson. Eventually she joined the firm of Perkins, Fellows, and Hamilton, where her drafting skills were highly valued. She obtained her Illinois architectural license in 1926 and began taking on independent commissions for residences. She settled in Evanston, Illinois, and during a career spanning six decades designed more than 50 residences as well as apartment buildings, schools, and churches. She worked mostly around Evanston, Glencoe, and Chicago, but she also designed buildings in the states of Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The Depression years were difficult for Whitman after her husband's business failed and he left her in 1934. To better support her children, she got a job with the state of Illinois as a social worker, but within a few years had moved over to remodeling offices for government buildings. Whitman simultaneously kept her solo architectural practice going, working closely with Evanston-area builders. One of her designs won a local award as well as being showcased in the women‚Äôs architecture display at the 1933 World‚Äôs Fair. Whitman valued house plans that made efficient use of space and were oriented towards the needs of daily domestic life, and she took pride in the fact that they were sturdy and well engineered. In 1928, Whitman became one of the nine founders of the Women's Architectural Club of Chicago, along with Juliet Peddle. The club was active into the 1940s, when it merged with the American Institute of Architecture. Whitman liked to travel to study world architectural styles, and over the course of her lifetime visited countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia. In the 1960s she wrote a book about her travels, A Tyro Takes a Trip (1971). Whitman returned to Michigan later in life and lived in Ann Arbor. She died in Cass City, Michigan, in 1984. Her papers are held by the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan and include photographs of buildings she designed.

The field that studies synthetic genomes is called Synthetic Genomics.  Recombinant DNA Technology  Soon after the discovery of restriction endonucleases and ligases, the field of genetics began using these molecular tools to assemble artificial sequences from smaller fragments of synthetic or naturally occurring DNA. The advantage in using the recombinatory approach as opposed to continual DNA synthesis stems from the inverse relationship that exists between synthetic DNA length and percent purity of that synthetic length. In other words, as you synthesize longer sequences, the number of error-containing clones increases due to the inherent error rates of current technologies. Although recombinant DNA technology is more commonly used in the construction of fusion proteins and plasmids, several techniques with larger capacities have emerged, allowing for the construction of entire genomes. = Polymerase Cycling Assembly = Polymerase Cycling Assembly. Blue arrows represent oligonucleotides 40 to 60 bp with overlapping regions of about 20 bp. The cycle is repeated until the final genome is constructed. Polymerase cycling assembly (PCA) uses a series of oligonucleotides (or oligos), approximately 40 to 60 nucleotides long, that altogether constitute both strands of the DNA being synthesized. These oligos are designed such that a single oligo from one strand contains a length of approximately 20 nucleotides at each end that is complementary to sequences of two different oligos on the opposite strand, thereby creating regions of overlap. The entire set is processed through cycles of: (a) hybridization at 60 ¬∞C; (b) elongation via Taq polymerase and a standard ligase; and (c) denaturation at 95 ¬∞C, forming progressively longer contiguous strands and ultimately resulting in the final genome. PCA was used to generate the first synthetic genome in history, that of the Phi X 174 virus. = Gibson Assembly Method = Gibson Assembly Method. The blue arrows represent DNA cassettes, which could be any size, 6 kb each for example. The orange segments represent areas of identical DNA sequences. This process can be carried out with multiple initial cassettes. The Gibson Assembly Method, designed by Daniel Gibson during his time at the J. Craig Venter Institute, requires a set of double-stranded DNA cassettes that constitute the entire genome being synthesized. Note that cassettes differ from contigs by definition, in that these sequences contain regions of homology to other cassettes for the purposes of recombination. In contrast to Polymerase Cycling Assembly, Gibson Assembly is a single-step, isothermal reaction with larger sequence-length capacity; ergo, it is used in place of Polymerase Cycling Assembly for genomes larger than 6 kb. A T5 exonuclease performs a chew-back reaction at the terminal segments, working in the 5' to 3' direction, thereby producing complementary overhangs. The overhangs hybridize to each other, a Phusion DNA polymerase fills in any missing nucleotides and the nicks are sealed with a ligase. However, the genomes capable of being synthesized using this method alone is limited because as DNA cassettes increase in length, they require propagation in vitro in order to continue hybridizing; accordingly, Gibson assembly is often used in conjunction with Transformation-Associated Recombination (see below) to synthesize genomes several hundred kilobases in size. = Transformation-Associated Recombination = Gap Repair Cloning. The blue arrows represent DNA contigs. Segments of the same colour represent complementary or identical sequences. Specialized primers with extensions are used in a polymerase chain reaction to generate regions of homology at the terminal ends of the DNA contigs. The goal of Transformation-Associated Recombination (TAR) technology in synthetic genomics is to combine DNA contigs by means of homologous recombination performed by the Yeast Artificial Chromosome (YAC). Of importance is the CEN element within the YAC vector, which corresponds to the yeast centromere. This sequence gives the vector the ability to behave in a chromosomal manner, thereby allowing it to perform homologous recombination. Transformation-Associated Recombination. Cross over events occur between regions of homology across the cassettes and YAC vector, thereby connecting the smaller DNA sequences into one larger contig. First, Gap Repair Cloning is performed to generate regions of homology flanking the DNA contigs. Gap Repair Cloning is a particular form of the Polymerase Chain Reaction in which specialized primers with extensions beyond the sequence of the DNA target are utilized. Then, the DNA cassettes are exposed to the YAC vector, which drives the process of homologous recombination, thereby connecting the DNA cassettes. Polymerase Cycling Assembly and TAR technology were used together to construct the 600 kb Mycoplasma genitalium genome in 2008, the first synthetic organism ever created. Similar steps were taken in synthesizing the larger Mycoplasma mycoides genome a few years later.

Ungewitter was a pioneer in Germany of Gothic revival architecture. His work was particularly influential in respect of church architecture during the final decades of the nineteenth century and the early decades of the twentieth. Life Georg Gottlob Ungewitter was born in Wanfried, a small town east of Kassel. His father, Johann Martin Justus Ungewitter (1785-1837) was in business and the boy was initially destined for a business career, but his interest in buildings and construction manifested itself early on, and he commenced training to become an architect when aged 14: he attended the Building Academy there, and then relocated to Munich in 1837. He returned to Kassel in 1840 and embarked upon a traineeship, but left at his own request two years later to pursue his studies, briefly, in Berlin. During the middle 1840s he worked for six years in Hamburg where the Great Fire of 1842 had left plenty of work for architects, before moving to L√ºbeck. It was during his two years in this Hanseatic City, in 1848 and 1849, that he became attached to the then burgeoning interest in reviving architecture of the late Gothic period. He was influenced both by the Medieval architecture of old L√ºbeck and by the work of August Reichensperger, a politician whose own longstanding interest in architecture had already manifested itself with a book on church architecture and in his influential membership of the commission created to oversee the completion/rebuilding of Cologne Cathedral. Around 1850 Ungewitter set himself up as a freelance architect in Leipzig: here he found few commissions, and he devoted much of his time to honing his draftsmanship skills, sketching the city's old buildings. Grave of Georg Gottlob Ungewitter He then returned to Kassel where he was employed between 1852 and 1864 at the Business Academy (a forerunner of the city's current university). 1852 was also the year in which he married Albertine Elise Landr√©. At Kassel one of his pupils (who later became a colleague) was . Ungewitter's teaching, architectural designs and publications helped to develop high standards of craftsmanship and precision in the new wave of architects. His finely detailed Gothic columns, windows and balcony canopies would become mainstream only a generation later. The English origins of Germany's new tide of Gothic revival architecture are also apparent with Ungewitter, as in the work of many of his contemporaries. Relatively few of Ungewitter's designs were actually built. That stands in contrast with the experience of Conrad Wilhelm Hase whose career in many other respects closely mirrored Ungewitter's own. After he married and settled in back Kassel, Ungewitter's first career priority lay in the area of teaching. However, the increasing originality and complexity of his designs also played a part. His designs for standalone buildings are exceptionally disparate, with numerous annexes and bays, necessitating exceptionally complicated roof shapes, so that taken together the features of a single design can be barely compatible.

A man, \\"whose indomitable pluck in the face of endless discouragements deserves an honourable place in the history of journalistic enterprise,\\" he published Rhodesia's first newspaper, the Mashonaland Herald and Zambesian Times in 1891. He also served as the first Mayor of Salisbury in 1897. He subsequently became a leading publishing executive with the Argus group of Newspapers in South Africa.  Early life and career  William Ernest Fairbridge was the son of William Alexander Fairbridge of Port Elizabeth. He was born on 2 November 1863 and was educated at Bedford Modern School in England. In 1890 he was appointed by the Argus Group of newspapers as the company's representative in Rhodesia and duly set out on a six month journey on a scotch cart drawn by oxen from Mafeking to Fort Salisbury.H.E. Vipan,A Register of Old Boys of the Bedford Modern School (Bedford, no date), p. li Undeterred by the absence of even the most rudimentary printing equipment Fairbridge published the first issue of the Mashonaland Herald and Zambesian Times on 27 June 1891. The publication was a hand-written news sheet that was reproduced by a Cyclostyle, or early stenograph, process. Fairbridge had no ink and so had to make it himself. He also had to source paper for each edition as he had brought no supply of his own. He supported the venture by readers' subscriptions which could take the form of a pot of marmalade, a box of candles or an old spade. Although the Mashonaland Herald was inevitably of variable quality, its success demonstrated the demand for a Rhodesian newspaper. Fairbridge re-launched the Mashonaland Herald as the Rhodesia Herald in 1892. This was a printed newspaper, and he followed this by founding the Bulawayo Chronicle in 1894. Both publications remain as the two longest established newspapers in Zimbabwe  Municipal and political affairs  Fairbridge served as a JP for Rhodesia and in 1897-98 served as the first mayor of Salisbury upon it being granted municipal status, and incorporated the family motto of Discrimine Salus in the town's first coat of arms. From his arrival in Rhodesia in 1891 Fairbridge had been politically active. He was not shy of criticising the British administration and had been forced to tone down his views expressed in the Mashonaland Herald. In 1899 he stood in the first Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council election, but, despite having the inevitable editorial support of his own newspapers, he failed in his bid to be elected as a member of the Mashonaland District.  Later career and life  Fairbridge eventually returned to South Africa to become General Manager of the Argus Newspaper Company and Managing Director of the Cape Argus. He retired to Switzerland and died at Montreux on 5 October 1943.

It was completed in 2000 to replace the two- lane road portion of the adjoining 1927 Carlton Bridge, which remains in use as a rail bridge. It is and features the longest precast concrete segmental span in North America at . It is also notable for being the first design/build project undertaken by the Maine Department of Transportation. The bridge cost $46.6 million, and is the last downstream road crossing of the Kennebec. History The Longmont-based firm Flatiron Structures/Figg Engineering Group was chosen to build the bridge, and the company broke ground in October 1997. Construction proceeded faster than expected and was finished about a month early, on August 1, 2000. The final cost was $46.6 million. Funding to construct the Sagadahoc Bridge was available by 1997, but had to be committed by October of that year or the federal funds intended for it would expire. Beginning construction in the time required would not permit the traditional design, bid, and build process to be done, as it would have delayed construction by 18‚Äì24 months. MDOT decided to use a design/build process, which it had never done before. The quick construction schedule led to public concern over the aesthetics of the project. Due to that, MDOT created a Public Advisory Committee, hired a public relations firm, and held public hearings about the project to solicit public comment and input as to the aesthetics and the project contractor itself. Most aspects of the bridge were selected through public input, such as the bridge color, railings, lighting, and surrounding landscaping. The inclusion of a pedestrian underpass on the Woolwich side to access the bridge also came about due to public input. The adjoining Carlton Bridge remained after the Sagadahoc Bridge's opening to continue as a rail bridge only, with the upper road deck severed from land on both sides,preventing cars from driving on it. Continuing deterioration of that bridge will necessitate action in the future regarding its continued use, possibly including removal of the remaining road deck or the bridge's closure. = Name = Residents of both Bath and Woolwich, the two towns to be connected by the bridge, participated in the structure's naming process by submitting suggested names to their respective town clerk. A committee of five people from each town was created and together selected six names for further input. Large jars were then placed in public buildings through which residents selected their choice by placing a penny into the jar of their selected name. The name \\"Sagadahoc\\", meaning 'mouth of river', was selected and subsequently approved by the Maine Legislature.

It is taken by mouth in the form of capsules. Common side effects include diarrhea, constipation and low platelet count. Like the older bortezomib (which can only be given by injection), it acts as a proteasome inhibitor, has orphan drug status in the US and Europe, and is a boronic acid derivative. The drug was developed by Takeda. In the US, it is approved since November 2015, and in the EU since November 2016. Medical uses Ixazomib is used in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adults after at least one prior therapy. There are no experiences with children and youths under 18 years of age. The study relevant for approval included 722 people. In this study, ixazomib increased the median time of progression-free survival from 14.7 months (in the placebo+lenalidomide+dexamethasone study arm including 362 people) to 20.6 months (under ixazomib+lenalidomide+dexamethasone, 360 people), which was a statistically significant effect (p = 0.012). 11.7% of patients in the ixazomib group had a complete response to the treatment, versus 6.6% in the placebo group. Overall response rate (complete plus partial) was 78.3% versus 71.5%. A phase 3 study demonstrated a significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with ixazomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (IRd) compared with placebo. High-risk cytogenetic abnormalities were defined as del(17p), t(4;14), and/or t(14;16); additionally, patients were assessed for 1q21 amplification. Of 722 randomized patients, 552 had cytogenetic results; 137 (25%) had high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities and 172 (32%) had 1q21 amplification alone. PFS was improved with IRd versus placebo in both high-risk and standard-risk cytogenetics subgroups: in high-risk patients, with median PFS of 21.4 versus 9.7 months; in standard-risk patients, with median PFS of 20.6 versus 15.6 months. This PFS benefit was consistent across subgroups with individual high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, including patients with del(17p). PFS was also longer with IRd versus placebo- in patients with 1q21 amplification, and in the \\"expanded high-risk\\" group, defined as those with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities and/or 1q21 amplification. IRd demonstrated substantial benefit compared with placebo in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with high-risk and standard-risk cytogenetics, and improves the poor PFS associated with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities. =Pregnancy and breastfeeding= Ixazomib and lenalidomide are teratogenic in animal studies. The latter is contraindicated in pregnant women, making this therapy regimen unsuitable for this group. It is not known whether ixazomib or its metabolites pass into the breast milk. Side effects Common side effects of the ixazomib+lenalidomide+dexamethasone study therapy included diarrhoea (42% versus 36% under placebo+lenalidomide+dexamethasone), constipation (34% versus 25%), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count; 28% versus 14%), peripheral neuropathy (28% versus 21%), nausea (26% versus 21%), peripheral oedema (swelling; 25% versus 18%), vomiting (22% versus 11%), and back pain (21% versus 16%). Serious diarrhoea or thrombocytopenia occurred in 2% of patients, respectively. Side effects of ixazomib alone were only assessed in a small number of people. Diarrhoea grade 2 or higher was found in 24% of these patients, thrombocytopenia grade 3 or higher in 28%, and fatigue grade 2 or higher in 26%.  Interactions  The drug has a low potential for interactions via cytochrome P450 (CYP) liver enzymes and transporter proteins. The only relevant finding in studies was a reduction of ixazomib blood levels when combined with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin. The Cmax was reduced by 54% and the area under the curve by 74% in this study. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= At therapeutic concentrations, ixazomib selectively and reversibly inhibits the protein proteasome subunit beta type-5 (PSMB5) with a dissociation half-life of 18 minutes. This mechanism is the same as of bortezomib, which has a much longer dissociation half-life of 110 minutes; the related drug carfilzomib, by contrast, blocks PSMB5 irreversibly. Proteasome subunits beta type-1 and type-2 are only inhibited at high concentrations reached in cell culture models. PSMB5 is part of the 20S proteasome complex and has enzymatic activity similar to chymotrypsin. It induces apoptosis, a type of programmed cell death, in various cancer cell lines. A synergistic effect of ixazomib and lenalidomide has been found in a large number of myeloma cell lines.KEGG: Ixazomib =Pharmacokinetics= Ixazomib citrate (MLN9708), the prodrug for ixazomib The medication is taken orally as a prodrug, ixazomib citrate, which is a boronic ester; this ester rapidly hydrolyzes under physiological conditions to its biologically active form, ixazomib, a boronic acid. Absolute bioavailability is 58%, and highest blood plasma concentrations of ixazomib are reached after one hour. Plasma protein binding is 99%. The substance is metabolized by many CYP enzymes (percentages in vitro, at higher than clinical concentrations: CYP3A4 42.3%, CYP1A2 26.1%, CYP2B6 16.0%, CYP2C8 6.0%, CYP2D6 4.8%, CYP2C9 4.8%, CYP2C9 <1%) as well as non-CYP enzymes, which could explain the low interaction potential. Clearance is about 1.86 litres per hour with a wide variability of 44% between individuals, and plasma half-life is 9.5 days. 62% of ixazomib and its metabolites are excreted via the urine (of which less than 3.5% in unchanged form) and 22% via the faeces. Chemistry Ixazomib is a boronic acid and peptide analogue like the older bortezomib. It contains a derivative of the amino acid leucine with the carboxylic acid group being replaced by a boronic acid; and the remainder of the molecule has been likened to phenylalanine. The structure has been found through a large-scale screening of boron-containing molecules. History The drug was developed by Takeda. It got US and European orphan drug status for multiple myeloma in 2011, and for AL amyloidosis in 2012. Takeda submitted a US new drug application for multiple myeloma in July 2015. In September 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted ixazomib combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone a priority review designation for multiple myeloma. On 20 November 2015, the FDA approved this combination for second-line treatment. The request for marketing authorisation in Europe was initially refused by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in May 2016 due to insufficient data showing a benefit of treatment. After Takeda requested a re-examination, the EMA granted a marketing authorisation on 21 November 2016 on the condition that further efficacy studies be conducted. The approval indication is the same as in the US. Research , ixazomib is also in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of AL amyloidosis and plasmacytoma of the bones, and in Phase I/II trials for various other conditions.

Deep drawing is a widely used cold sheet metal forming process to draw the sheet metal in forming dye of desirable cross-section using mechanical force of the punch. DFM refers to design for manufacturability. DFA refers to design for assembly. DFMA stands for design for manufacture and assembly. It is a practice for designing the engineering components keeping manufacturing and assembly aspects in mind. DFMA tries to tackle the problems that may come during the manufacturing and assembly at the design stage itself. Changes in the parts design to remove these problems while keeping the functionality of the parts intact. This is done to reduce the cost of iterations thus making the manufacturing of components more efficient and economical. In the deep drawing process, a blank of sheet metal (usually circular) is placed on the die. The die is fixed to the base. The metal blank is held in position on the die using blank holder. Mechanical force is applied on the part of the metal blank above the die cavity through a punch. As the punch force increases the metal flows from the flange region in to the die cavity. Here is the Rule based DFM analysis for Deep drawing process. These rules can be incorporated at the design stage to improve the efficiency of the process:  Material of Sheet Metal  As the deep drawing is a cold forming operation, the germane properties of the sheet metal are formability, ductility and yield strength. The material should have good formability and ductility so that it can be drawn into the desired shape without any cracks. The yield strength of the material should be low facilitating initiation of the flow of metal without tearing near the punch radius.  Clearance between Punch and Die  Clearance between the punch and die guides the flow of the metal into the die. Clearance should be more than the metal thickness to avoid concentration of metal at the top of the die cavity. Clearance should not be as large so that the flow of metal into the die region becomes unrestricted leading to the wrinkling of wall.  Die corner radius  Radius of curvature at the die where the metal enters from the flange region into the die region is an important geometrical parameter. If the die corner radius is small than wrinkling near the flange region becomes more prominent. Too small die corner radius results in cracks due to sharp change in the direction of metal flow. Generally it should be 5-10 times the sheet thickness.  Punch corner radius  As the metal draws into the die the thickness of the sheet decreases near in the lower region of the punch. Maximum reduction happens near punch corner because the metal flow decreases significantly here. Too sharp corner results in cracks near the punch base. Corner radius of punch should be 4-10 times the sheet thickness.  Blank holding force  The friction in the flange region is mainly affected by blank holding force. Blank holding force is required for checking the amount of the metal flow in to the die. The low value of blank holding force results in wrinkling in the flange region and too high value of holding force results in increase in the drawing force due to the increase in the friction between the flange region. The blank holding force should be just enough to restrict the flow of the metal.  Drawing Ratio  Measurement of the amount of drawing performed on a sheet metal blank is quantified using drawing ratio. The higher the drawing ratio, the more extreme the amount of deep drawing. Due to the geometry, forces, metal flow and material properties of the work, there is a limit to the amount of deep drawing that can be performed on a sheet metal blank in a single operation. The drawing ratio is roughly calculated as, DR = Db/Dp. Db is the diameter of the blank and Dp is the diameter of the punch. For shapes that are noncircular the maximum diameter is sometimes used, or occasionally drawing ratio is calculated using surface areas. The limit to the drawing ratio for an operation is usually 2 or under .

D. Imman composed the music, while Venkatesh S. handled the cinematography. Shot in Ooty and Coimbatore within 54 days, the film derives its title from a hybrid of two words, Mirugam meaning animal and Manithan meaning man. The film depicts a zombie apocalypse in the state of Tamil Nadu that starts after a poisonous liquid spills from a container outside a chemical laboratory in Ooty. Karthik is a traffic police officer who learns of the outbreak when his sister goes missing and he finds himself attacked by some zombies. He teams up with some doctors and his girlfriend to escape from Ooty and find a cure for the outbreak, while zombies keep spreading from city to city. Prior to its release, the film faced issues when the Central Board of Film Certification granted it an A (adults only) rating. The makers approached the revising committee that passed the film with a U/A (parental guidance) rating. Along with a Telugu dubbed version titled Yamapasham, the film was released theatrically on 19 February 2016. Miruthan has also been screened at multiple film festivals such as the Neuch√¢tel International Fantastic Film Festival, the Fantasia International Film Festival (the second Tamil film after Enthiran to get selected for this festival), the MOTELx - Lisbon International Horror Film Festival, the Morbido Film Fest, the Sitges Film Festival, the Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival and the Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival. Later, Jayam Ravi introduced plans to make the sequel Miruthan 2 as a superhero film so as to cater to younger audiences as well. Plot The opening scene shows a container of poisonous liquid being spilled from a transport vehicle at a chemical laboratory in Ooty. A stray dog consumes it and turns violent, which then bites a security guard. The security guard turns into a zombie within hours and starts a chain of human infections via bites. Back to the present, Karthik (Jayam Ravi) is a traffic police sub-inspector in Ooty who avoids all kinds of dangers as he takes care of his younger sister Vidhya (Anikha Surendran), who is in her early teens. Both are orphans but live with Karthik's friend Chinnamalai (Kaali Venkat), a traffic police constable. Karthik is in love with a cardiology doctor named Renuka aka Renu (Lakshmi Menon), but never proposes in all their meetings. Renu is engaged and is about to marry an NRI named Naveen (Amit Bhargav), who is also a cardiologist. One day Karthick messes up with Minister Gurumoorthy (R. N. R. Manohar) by allowing an auto carrying pregnant women in Minister's way. Next day morning Karthick finds that his sister Vidhya goes missing, while looking for her he was suddenly attacked by Zombies. At the same time, the police of Ooty are informed of the outbreak and get orders to shoot anyone who has turned into a zombie. Karthik is looking for Vidhya by sticking posters of his missing sister on walls and killing some zombies in his way. He receives a call in which he is told to arrive at a place to find his sister. There, he finds Renu and her group of doctors, including the chief doctor Dharan (Jeeva Ravi), all working on finding a vaccine to cure all of the zombies. At Renu's house Karthick and Chinnamalai finds Minister Gurumoorthy who is the father of Renu and comes to know that the Minister has kidnapped Vidhya for vengeance, He finds Vidhya at a swimming pool surrounded by Minister Gurumoorthy's zombified henchman and finds that Zombies are allergic to water. Renu tells Karthick to save the doctors who are trapped inside the house, which is invaded by zombies. Escorted by Karthik, the team comprising Dharan, Renu, another doctor Kamal (Raghavan Durairaj), Renu's father Minister Gurumoorthy (R. N. R. Manohar), Chinnamalai, and Vidhya, the group heads to Kovai aka (Coimbatore), where they are to use medical equipment to find a cure to the tragedy. But Dharan was already scratched by a zombie, so he was not getting infected immediately. He doesn't reveal this to anyone, fearing for his safety. When they near Mettuplayam, they were shocked to see that the infection had already spread in Coimbatore. The zombies crowd around the police van, so Karthik is forced to rash-drive the van to kill the zombies one by one. Later, Gurumoorthy unknowingly disturbs some zombies and Karthik ended up having to shoot them which attracts many other zombies around. Then they all are forced to take shelter in a mall, opposite to the hospital. Meanwhile, Naveen is inside the hospital trying to find the vaccine. They get ahold of Shri (Sriman) a frightened security guard of the mall. After a few hours, Dharan turns into a zombie and bites Vidhya. Karthik kills Dharan with his gun, but Vidhya does not turn into a zombie despite the fact that she was attacked almost an hour ago. Kamal says that she will be able to help them in finding the vaccine as she has the required antibodies and immunity. Karthik had to escort them to the hospital, which faces the mall. For this, he uses pressurized water from the mall's fire truck, knowing that they are allergic to water. Despite the reduced time, Karthik manages to bring everyone safely to the hospital except Renu. He goes back to the mall to bring Renu, but he does that without any water source. So he leads Renu to the hospital but was bitten by the zombies while escorting her. He himself slowly turns into a zombie, but he safely escorts her to the hospital before his human feelings lose and also advises Renu to shoot him. But she is too adamant to know the reason why he had saved her, despite the uncaring Naveen's attempts and her selfish father, and realizes his love for her, but Karthik turns into a zombie, thus Renu shoots him. The doctors finds the required antidote and start dealing the virus. Later, Karthik, now completely a zombie, is seen on top of a bus which is going to Chennai, implying that Renu did not shoot Karthik properly and hence he has survived the attack. Cast * Jayam Ravi as Traffic Sub-Inspector Karthik, a police officer who loves Dr. Renuka and his sister Vidhya.

It is known nationally for being a very fertile region thanks to the depth of its loess soils that, it terms of yield are only exceeded in Germany by the Magdeburg B√∂rde. The term \\"b√∂rde\\" has a twin meaning here. Administratively it refers to a former juridical district and agriculturally to a fertile lowland. Historically-administratively the Soest B√∂rde comprised the former territorial lordship of the town of Soest in the present municipalities of Soest, Bad Sassendorf and Welver. From a natural regional perspective, it belongs to the Hellwegb√∂rden, whose eponymous centre it represents.The term Hellwegb√∂rden was first used in the Handbook of Natural Region Divisions of Germany in the 1950s and expanded the term b√∂rde also to the adjacent regions to the west and east. Within the natural region classification, however, the Soest B√∂rde, is not recognized as a unit. Instead the sub-regions of the Soest Upper and Lower B√∂rde are used, the boundaries of which are not the same as the borders of the historical Soest B√∂rde.

With colleagues, he has founded many different organisations in different fields of endeavour. He is currently President and CEO of Relational Peacebuilding Initiatives. Currently, In recognition of his public service, he was appointed CBE by the Queen in the New Year Honours List 2009.  A Post-Capitalist and Post-Socialist Approach to Public Policy  Schluter‚Äôs approach to public policy was first articulated at book length in The R Factor(1993), co-authored with the writer, David Lee. The central argument of the book is that social, economic and political problems in society arise from a lack of prioritization of relationships ‚Äì not only personal, but organisational, national and international. All legislation, government and corporate policies and organisational structures impact on the way people relate, but this impact is generally not considered by those making policy decisions. Improvement in the quality of relationships is not only necessary but also possible ‚Äì and if we can enable relational restoration to happen, the quality of life globally can be significantly enhanced. The overall approach can be considered as a critique of Capitalism as well as Socialism, or perhaps even as an alternative framework for public policy. It is sometimes called ‚ÄòRelationism‚Äô or, more commonly, Relational Thinking. The R Factor was received by many people as a call to action. Even though Schluter has co-authored other books and reports since then (e.g. The Jubilee Manifesto, The Relational Manager, Transforming Capitalism from Within, The Relational Lens, and Confederal Europe), few publications by any author in the last few decades have had its range of impact on individuals, on families, on organisations, and on structures. Relational Thinking Schluter has founded two organizations which research relationships, Relationships Foundation and Relational Research. A number of practical and more specific initiatives based on the relational approach have developed out of his work. These include Credit Action to help tackle the effects of consumer debt, which subsequently became part of the Money Charity; Allia which tackles unemployment and funding of social enterprise through encouraging the use of capital to achieve social outcomes; and Relational Schools which seeks to reform the culture and values in schools. Another initiative has been the Marriage Foundation, which promotes long-term committed relationship through the institution of marriage. The R Factor sets out the five essential dimensions of any and every relationship (personal, organisational or international). Those dimensions are collectively referred to as the Relational Proximity Framework. Schluter recognised that measurement of quality of relationships was crucial if relational assessment was to be used in public decision making. In an organisational context, any relationship measurement must be two-sided, because, to state the obvious, no relationship is one-sided. The measurement process and tools are referred to as ‚Äúrelational analytics‚Äù. Given the tens of thousands of measurements that have been carried out already across schools, companies, the health sector, prisons, elderly care, and the non-profit sector, it has been possible to have the relational analytics tools statistically validated. International Peace Work In 1987 Schluter with colleagues initiated a peace process under the name Newick Park Initiative (NPI) in South Africa, which held deliberately low-profile conferences between 1987 and 1997, bringing together the leaders of the African National Congress (ANC) and the White political leadership to discuss key issues so as to ease the path to a political settlement. NPI‚Äôs director facilitated Inkatha joining the South African election just three weeks before the first free elections in 1994. The work in South Africa led on to a peace initiative in Rwanda after the genocide there, followed by a peace process between North and South Sudan.Hauss, C. , The Continuum International Publishing Group Inc, 2010. International Conflict Resolution These initiatives were followed by the establishment in 2005 of Concordis International, for regional peace initiatives working primarily in Africa. In 2016, Schluter helped to establish Relational Peacebuilding Initiatives (RPI) based in Geneva to heal relationships in situations of national conflict; RPI is currently involved with a peacebuilding initiative in the Korean Peninsula.  Jubilee Centre and Keep Sunday Special Campaign  In 1983 Schluter helped to establish the Jubilee Centre to explore the shared heritage of Jewish and Christian understanding of the Torah as a part of the Hebrew/Old Testament Scriptures. Ten years later, this led to the publication of The 'R' Factor in 1993. The intellectual work initiated by The ‚ÄòR‚Äô Factor continues in research undertaken by the Jubilee Centre, and through the Cambridge Papers, over 120 of which have now been published. The Jubilee Centre connects what is now referred to as Relational Thinking to the life of churches; it can also be connected to synagogues, mosques, gurudwaras and temples, but that awaits initiative from concerned individuals and groups. In 1985, the Jubilee Centre brought together a coalition of retailers, trade unions and church-related organizations to fight Prime Minister Thatcher‚Äôs bill to deregulate Sunday trading. This was in recognition that the Sabbath in the Torah in one simple law protected community and family relationships because time is an essential precondition to build and maintain any relationship. The ‚ÄúKeep Sunday Special Campaign‚Äù overturned a large government majority. In 1994, the government passed a bill which allows large shops to open for six hours on Sunday while small shops can open when they like; this remains the law to this day. Schluter has continued to speak out against Sunday Trading, arguing that a new law needs to be brought in to give everyone a shared day off and to ensure parents are able to spend time with their children.Dr. Schluter argued that Sunday shopping in the United States was a fairly major contributing factor to damage to family life and stability there, and said he was fighting the battle against it here on grounds of Christian principle.

According to News Diary online, the New Deal Organization aims to change the mindset of young people and encourage morality. The New Deal combats violence, drug abuse and other societal vices by addressing parents and children and encouraging a synergy to foster beneficial relationships on the basis that good behavior starts in the home. To enforce this, the New Deal utilizes a two part plan, called Y.A.C.T. and P.A.C.T., respectively.  P.A.C.T.  P.A.C.T. (Parents Against Crime Together) is one of two parts of the New Deal, and calls for parents to bring back family moral values.

Hasmukh Gandhi is a happy go lucky man. But his stress-free life is interrupted when his daughter, Tanisha comes home with her boyfriend, Montu. Tanisha was a die hard fan of Superstar Sonia Kapoor, and Montu promised her that he knows Sonia Kapoor well and will once take her to meet Sonia. Montu went to Ahmedabad on a challenge that he can get any girl. He offered Gandhi a partnership in his upcoming project, which was rejected by Gandhi, as he knew Montu had malicious intentions. The Gandhi family, however, fell for Montu's charm. Not wanting his daughter to be entrapped, Hasmukh finds Bakul Booch as the perfect boy for Tanisha. Bakul is Hasmakh's manager in his office. He and Tanisha were childhood friends. When Hasmukh revealed his plan of getting Bakul married to Tanisha, Bakul denied and said he was not a perfect match and was very shy as against Tanisha. Hasmukh takes it upon himself to transform Bakul into a cool 'gujju'. He plans to create a fake relationship of Bakul with superstar Sonia Kapoor. Tanisha was a die hard fan of Sonia. In the interim, Hasmukh meets Laila in a meeting, who realises that Hasmukh was a rich man and thus she plans to trap Hasmukh by asking him to give money in order to get rid of her. Hasmukh's wife was unaware about Laila's blackmailing. Hasmukh and Bakul meet Sonia in a hotel after fooling her bodyguard and take pictures and videos with her and Bakul.

Tanisha requests Bakul to help her meet Sonia Kapoor, but he becomes hesitant. Montu plans to expose Bakul and takes the entire family to Sonia's shooting place. Sonia instantly recognises Bakul and greets him. When Montu tells Sonia that Bakul is a liar, she tells that she doesnt know Montu and never met her. Tanisha gets angry on Montu for lying her of knowing Sonia Kapoor. Meanwhile, the police suspect Hasmukh and Bakul to be wanted terrorists and follow their every move. However a mobster called Badebhai -who is the actress‚Äô real boyfriend- finds out about this relationship, and thinking it's real, visits the Gandhi residence to kill Bakul. However the police seize the house and capture Badebhai, but Bakul gets injured when Badebhai shoots from his gun. He gets fed up of the entire family and asks the police to arrest him.

Now a five-star establishment, its history goes back to the 14th century when there were warehouses on the site. The two houses forming today's structure were built in the mid-18th century. Location and description Schl√∂ssle Hotel is located on P√ºhavaimu street in the Old Town of Tallinn. It lies adjacent to Tallinn City Museum and diagonally opposite from the Church of the Holy Ghost. The hotel is a 5-star boutique hotel and is the only member of The Leading Hotels of the World consortium in Estonia. It belongs to the Marbella Club Hotels group. The hotel has 23 rooms, meeting facilities, a restaurant, a cigar lounge and a traditional Estonian sauna. The hotel was named Estonia's Leading Hotel in 2011. History The location of the present hotel was mentioned in written sources for the first time in 1363, when an adjacent building (today the City Museum) was referred to as a merchant's home. On the site of the hotel there were at that time already large stone warehouses, owned by a city alderman. The buildings were sold to the mayor Marquart Bretholt in 1470 (he had earlier acquired the premises of today's City Museum). At the time, only one entrance to the courtyard behind the warehouses existed, an entrance which has been preserved to this day. The buildings subsequently belonged to several distinguished Tallinn families, such as Viant, van Husen, Blanckenhagen, Hetling, Intelmann and Schlovin. Following the capitulation of Estonia during the Great Northern War and a subsequent outbreak of plague, the buildings were abandoned sometime around 1710. In 1739 the two warehouses were purchased by a merchant named Wilhelm Brinck. In 1758 he initiated a reconstruction of the buildings, whereby they were transformed from Gothic warehouses into residential houses, with several Baroque elements. The two houses that make up the present hotel still retain both medieval and Baroque features. One of the buildings is a registered national monument of Estonia.

Also within the canyon is a new-for-2016 Family Boomerang roller coaster called Raik. Klugheim replaced the former Silver City themed area of the park. Ride experience Upon departure from the station, the train makes a slow U-turn onto the launch track that is parallel with the station. Once clear, the train is launched to a speed of 49.7 mph (80kmh). The layout is woven between the surrounding buildings and structures of Klugheim, and through tunnels. The riders aboard the train narrowly miss walls of faux rock faces and waterfalls. During the course of the ride, the train crosses over or under its own track 116 times at 58 intersecting track points, more than any other launched roller coaster in the world.

His later studies were more optimistic, but less influential at the time. He served as chairman of the Sociology Department at the City College of New York, and then founded the Center for Knowledge in Criminal Justice Planning. Life and career Martinson was born on May 19, 1927 in Minneapolis, Minnesota to Magnus Constantine Martinson and Gwendolyn A. Gagnon.New York State death certificate issued August 11, 1979 in Manhattan, New York City via Michael S. MartinsonMagnus C. Martinson and Robert Martinson in the 1930 United States census living in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He received his degrees ‚Äì BA (1949), MA (1953), PhD (1968) ‚Äì from the University of California, Berkeley. In 1959 he ran for mayor of Berkeley, California as the Socialist Party candidate. Martinson was a participant in the 1961 Freedom Riders, spending over a month in two Mississippi jails, and wrote about his experience for The Nation. He also wrote a longer academic study of the group dynamics within his cohort of imprisoned Freedom Riders. His incarceration generated his interest in penology. He married Rita J. Carter on September 18, 1961 in San Francisco, California.California Marriage Index, 1960-1985 Martinson's investigation with Douglas Lipton and Judith Wilks regarding rehabilitation of inmates in prison had been commissioned in 1966 by the New York State Governor's Commission on Criminal Offenders. It covered 231 earlier studies, dated from 1945 to 1967. Their first draft had been completed in 1970, but because the results were considered unsuitable, the report was initially suppressed. It later became available after an unrelated court case. Something of a public figure at the time, Martinson was interviewed by People magazine and on 60 Minutes (August 24, 1975), asserting that \\"nothing works\\" in prison rehabilitation. His work was embraced by politicians, and inspired a wave of strong sentencing and cancellation of rehabilitation programs. Academics, however, strongly criticized his studies, for drawing conclusions from mostly untrained practitioners in underfunded programs, and he himself later reversed his stance. Martinson committed suicide on August 11, 1979 by leaping from his fifteenth floor Manhattan apartment.

It was completed in 1927. Until August 1, 2000, it also carried two lanes of U.S. Route 1 (US 1) on its upper deck, after which the highway was transferred to the adjoining Sagadahoc Bridge and the road connection severed. The majority of the road deck remains but may be removed in the future. It is the last downstream fixed crossing of the Kennebec. With the removal of US 1 from the bridge, its primary traffic is freight trains operated by the Maine Central and Quebec Railway that are bound for manufacturers in Thomaston, of which several pass over the bridge per week. It has also carried passenger excursion trains to Rockland, though the Maine Department of Transportation leased the line to another company that will means the end of passenger service after 2015. Inspections The 88-year-old bridge failed an inspection in the fall of 2013, resulting in its closure from February 23 to 25, 2014, for an in-depth inspection and load test. The in-depth inspection found that steel has been rusting away from the bridge and at least one beam needs repair. Despite the deficiencies found, MDOT has stated that the problems do not currently impair the running of trains across the bridge. No restrictions have been placed on the use of the bridge, though MDOT requests that the Maine Eastern Railroad notify it of the days trains pass over the bridge. No decisions have yet been made about how to address the deficiencies, though options include repainting the bridge, removing the remaining road deck, or even its closure.

History of the reforms The reforms were proposed by a group of experts in matrimonial jurisprudence. According to experts at the Vatican, they are the most expansive revision in matrimonial nullity jurisprudence in centuries. The reforms are a departure from the 18th-century matrimonial nullity reforms of the canonist Pope Benedict XIV. Reception Austen Ivereigh described the reforms as \\"revolutionary\\" and says that they are the broadest reforms in 300 years. Kurt Martens, a canon law professor, worries that the reduction in procedure will not guarantee a fair trial. He likened the reforms to the Catholic Church providing a means of no-fault divorce. In an article published by conservative religious journal First Things, Martens stated that many Italian jurists fear that there might be a spike in conflicts between the canonical, Italian, and European Union judicial systems, since the reforms abolish a number of \\"basic due process norms\\" which are neither respected nor acknowledged. In his view, this renders the canonical judicial system \\"incompatible\\" with modern judicial procedure.New Norms for Marriage Nullity, Kurt Martens, 4 December 2015; accessed 6 December 2015 Pope Francis reflected after the 2014 Synod on the Family that: \\"A great number of synod fathers emphasized the need to make the procedure in cases of nullity more accessible and less time-consuming, and, if possible, at no expense.\\" Between 1970 and 1983 the United States bishops had experimented with the possibility of one rather than two hearings and 90% of the cases were decided without the second tribunal. But the Code of Canon Law of 1983 eliminated this possibility, now restored through Pope Francis' revisions.

Japanophilia is the appreciation and love of Japanese culture, people and history. In Japanese, the term for Japanophile is , with \\"Ë¶™\\" equivalent to the English prefix 'pro-' and \\"Êó•\\", meaning \\"Japan\\" (as in the word for Japan ). The term was first used as early as the 18th century, switching in scope over time. History =Early usage= The term Japanophile traces back to the late 18th and early 19th centuries before Japan became more open to foreign trade. Carl Peter Thunberg and Philipp Franz von Siebold helped introduce Japanese flora, artworks, and other objects to Europe which spiked interest. Lafcadio Hearn, an Irish-Greek author who made his home in Japan in the 19th century, was described as \\"a confirmed Japanophile\\" by Charles E. Tuttle Company in their forewords to several of his books. Others may include Jules Brunet, a French Army officer who played a famous role in the Japanese Boshin War. =20th century= In the first decade of the 20th century, several British writers lauded Japan. In 1904, for example, Beatrice Webb wrote that Japan was a \\"rising star of human self-control and enlightenment\\", praising the \\"innovating collectivism\\" of the Japanese, and the \\"uncanny\\" purposefulness and open-mindedness of its \\"enlightened professional elite.\\" H. G. Wells similarly named the √©lite of his A Modern Utopia \\"samurai\\". In part this was a result of the decline of British industrial productivity, with Japan and Germany rising comparatively. Germany was seen as a threat and a rival power, but Japan was seen as a potential ally. The British sought efficiency as the solution to issues of productivity, and after the publication of Alfred Stead's 1906 book Great Japan: A Study of National Efficiency, pundits in Britain looked to Japan for lessons. This interest, however, ended after World War I. General Jos√© Mill√°n-Astray, the founder of the Spanish Legion, stated that the samurai warrior code Bushido exerted a great influence on him. Defining Bushido as \\"a perfect creed\\", Mill√°n-Astray said that \\"the Spanish legionnaire is also a samurai and practices the Bushido essentials: Honor, Valor, Loyalty, Generosity, and Sacrifice\\", and added that Spain would become a great power like Japan by adhering to the code's principles. He also made a Spanish translation of Inazo Nitobe's book Bushido: The Soul of Japan and a prologue to it. =21st century= In the early 2000s, derogatory slang terms were created to demean those who appreciated Japanese popular culture. The term \\"wapanese\\" (from \\"white Japanese\\", or possibly also \\"wannabe Japanese\\") first emerged in 2002 as a derogatory term for a white person who is obsessed with Japanese culture, which includes anime and manga. The term \\"weeaboo\\" (later shortened to weeb) came from the webcomic The Perry Bible Fellowship, in which the word had no meaning other than it was something unpleasant. According to an unpublished MA thesis, 4chan quickly picked up the word and applied it in an abusive way in place of the already existing wapanese term. Kim Morrissy of Crunchyroll wrote that the meaning of the word otaku is hindered by cultural appropriation, and that some westerners believe that it can only refer to a Japanese person, as the concept is not directly translatable and is a quintessentially Japanese phrase. In a blog post on Anime News Network, Justin Sevakis gives a difference between the two, saying that there is nothing wrong with loving Japanese culture. He points out that a person only becomes a weeaboo when they start to be obnoxious, immature, and ignorant about the culture they love. Matt Jardin from the Alaska Dispatch gave an opinion on the definition saying that weeaboos blindly prefer things from Japan while looking down on anything else despite obvious merit. The terms weeb and weeaboo also refer to non-Japanese people obsessed with using Japanese words in their sentences or people who are obsessed with Japanese pop-culture while not being of Japanese ancestry.

The Fool or The Jester is one of the 78 cards in a tarot deck. In tarot card reading, it is one of the 22 Major Arcana, sometimes numbered as 0 (the first) or XXII (the last). However, in decks designed for playing traditional tarot card games, it is typically unnumbered, as it is not one of the 21 trump cards and instead serves a unique purpose by itself. Iconography The Fool is titled Le Mat in the Tarot of Marseilles, and Il Matto in most Italian language tarot decks. These archaic words mean \\"the madman\\" or \\"the beggar\\", and may be related to the word for 'checkmate' in relation to the original use of tarot cards for gaming purposes.Talia Felix, \\"The Cartomancer's Key\\" In the earliest tarot decks, the Fool is usually depicted as a beggar or a vagabond. In the Visconti-Sforza tarot deck, the Fool wears ragged clothes and stockings without shoes, and carries a stick on his back. He has what appear to be feathers in his hair. His unruly beard and feathers may relate to the tradition of the woodwose or wild man. Another early Italian image that relates to the tradition is the first (and lowest) of the series of the so-called Tarocchi of Mantegna. This series of prints containing images of social roles, allegorical figures, and classical deities begins with Misero, a depiction of a beggar leaning on a staff.Images from the Tarocchi de Mantegna, accessed April 9, 2008. A similar image is contained in the German Hof√§mterspiel; there the fool (German: Narr) is depicted as a barefoot man in robes, apparently with bells on his hood, playing a bagpipe.Hof√§mterspiel images, accessed April 9, 2008. The Tarot of Marseilles and related decks similarly depict a bearded person wearing what may be a jester's hat; he always carries a bundle of his belongings on a stick (called a bindle) slung over his back. He appears to be getting chased away by an animal, either a dog or a cat. The animal has torn his pants.Bill Butler, Dictionary of the Tarot. (Schocken, 1975; ) In the Rider-Waite Tarot deck and other esoteric decks made for cartomancy, the Fool is shown as a young man, walking unknowingly toward the brink of a precipice. In the Rider-Waite deck, he is also portrayed as having with him a small dog. The Fool holds a white rose (a symbol of freedom from baser desires) in one hand, and in the other a small bundle of possessions, representing untapped collective knowledge.Gray, E. (1960). The tarot revealed: A modern guide to reading the tarot cards. New York, N.Y.: Bell Publishing Company. In French suited tarot decks that do not use the traditional emblematic images of Italian suited decks for the suit of trumps, the Fool is typically made up as a jester or bard, reminiscent of the Joker often included with the standard 52-card deck.  History  In the decks before Waite-Smith, the Fool is almost always unnumbered. There are a few exceptions: some old decks (including the 15th-century Sola Busca) labelled the card with a 0, and the 18th-century Belgian decks labelled the Fool as XXII.Belgian tarot The Fool is almost always completely apart from the sequence of trumps in the historic decks. Still, there is historic precedent for regarding it as the lowest trump and as the highest trump. Traditionally, the Major Arcana in tarot cards are numbered with Roman numerals. The Fool is numbered with the zero, one of the Arabic numerals. In tarot card games Sk√ºs (right) of the Industrie und Gl√ºck. In tarot card reading, the Fool is usually considered part of the Major Arcana. This is not true in tarot card games; the Fool's role in most games is independent of both the plain suit cards and the trump cards, and the card does not belong to either category. As such, most tarot decks originally made for game playing do not assign a number to the Fool indicating its rank in the suit of trumps; it has none. Waite gives the Fool the number 0, but in his book discusses the Fool between Judgment, no. 20, and The World, no. 21. The only traditional game deck that numbers the Fool 0 is the Tarocco Piemontese. Since the 1930s, Tarot Nouveau decks often use a black inverted mullet as the corner index for the Fool.Tarot Nouveau decks manufactured in FranceTarot Nouveau deck from Austria In almost all tarot games, the Fool is one of the most valuable cards. =As excuse= In most tarot games originating from Italy and France, the Fool has a unique role. In these games, the Fool is sometimes called \\"the Excuse\\". Tarot games are typically trick taking games; playing the Fool card excuses the player from either following suit or playing a trump. At the end of the trick, the player then takes back the Fool and adds it to their own trick pile and (in most games) gives the trick's winner the least valuable card from that same pile. If there are no cards to give in exchange, the Fool is worth one point less and an extra point is given to the trick-taker. Or, at the end of the hand, it can be awarded to a player or team that has won all the tricks. Usually the Fool can't be captured but in some games it can be won in the last trick which may yield a scoring bonus. In a minor variant option of French tarot, a player dealt trump 1 but with no other trumps or the Fool can make trump 1 behave the same as the Fool (petit imprenable).Petit imprenable rule However, in official tournament rules, a player in this situation must declare their hand and force a redeal (petit sec). =As lowest trump= The 18th- century Piedmontese game of Sedici and its variants treated the Fool as the lowest trump.A History of Games Played with the Tarot Pack, Dummet & McLeod, 2004. Edwin Mellen Press, Lampeter. Vol.1, page 169-170. Unlike most games, the Fool is worth only one point. This is similar to the role of the Miseria trump in Sicilian tarocchi. =As highest trump= In most Central European Tarock games, the Fool, or Sk√ºs, is simply played as the 22nd trump, making it the highest trump in such games.Tarot games In K√∂nigrufen, the Fool can be captured but only if it is played in the same trick with trumps 21 and 1 in which case trump 1 wins; this is called the Emperor's trick or Fairytale trick.Konigrufen rules In Hungarian Tarock, the player that loses trump 21 to the Fool traditionally has to wear a silly hat.Hungarian tarokk =As excuse and highest trump= In French tarot and Droggn, the Fool is an excuse but in a rare circumstance it will be the highest trump. If the player who holds the Fool has won all the previous tricks, in the last trick the Fool becomes the highest trump.French tarot In Troggu, the Fool is the highest trump but if it is the last trump in the player's possession, the player can elect to throw in another card instead of following suit. Once this occurs, the Fool is no longer a trump but an excuse that must be reserved for the last trick.Troggu rules =As excuse and wild card= Before and after trick-play of Tarocchini, the Fool and the Magician are called contatori (counters), a limited form of wild cards.Tarocco Bolognese deck They can be used separately or together to fill missing gaps in combinations or extend them but they can't fill in two consecutive gaps in sequential combinations.Tarocchino Bolognese They can't replace the highest trump or kings. Both cards can be used in every sequence but as the Fool can't be captured while the Magician is vulnerable, the player holding the Magician would want to use it only judiciously.Tarocchini sequences In Grosstarock games, of which Danish tarok is the last survivor, the Fool can take the place of a missing card during declarations before play. However, a meld completed using the Fool is worth only half the points compared to a natural meld. Also, when leading a trick the Fool can turn into the weakest card of any suit the player chooses but it will be sent to the player's trick pile just like an excuse. If, however, the opponents lack the suit named, then they may get the right to set the trick's suit.Danish tarok  Interpretations  A standard medieval allegory of Foolishness, painted by Giotto from Scrovegni Chapel in Padua. This depiction resembles the Fool in the earliest surviving painted decks. According to Robert M. Place, the Fool may have originally represented the everyman, subject to the neoplatonic triumphal sequence of the other Major Arcana. In many esoteric systems of interpretation, too, the Fool is usually interpreted as the protagonist of a story, and the Major Arcana is the path the Fool takes through the great mysteries of life and the main human archetypes. This path is known traditionally in cartomancy as the \\"Fool's Journey\\", and is frequently used to introduce the meaning of Major Arcana cards to beginners.See, e.g, Rachel Pollack, Seventy-Eight Degrees of Wisdom (Thorsons, 1980; ); Gareth Knight, The Magical World of the Tarot (Aquarian, 1991; ).

Because of this incident, the NFL issued a \\"clarification\\" two weeks after the Giants/Redskins game to remind the Giants that if their celebrations included two or more players, that they would be penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct. The song is also popular across North America; when played in the clubs, it is typical for everyone to take \\"jump shots\\" when Jim Jones says \\"ballin'\\". The dance in the video along with the jump shot has been named the \\"Fadeaway\\" by Jones. WWE's Montel Vontavious Porter, is known to do the \\"Fadeaway\\" jump shot before dropping an elbow on his opponent. The crowd often cheers \\"ballin'\\" before the elbow drop. Homicide celebrated with this song after defeating Bryan Danielson for the ROH World Championship in his hometown of New York City at the Manhattan Center. Combat Zone Wrestling group BLKOUT has also used the song as their entrance theme. The song has become Jim Jones' most successful single to date, peaking at number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming his first top ten single. The single also remains his most successful single on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and Hot Rap Tracks, peaking at number 4 and number 1, respectively, and also ranked at number 1 on the Hot RingMasters chart. It has been certified Platinum by the RIAA, as a digital single and as a \\"Master Tone\\" (a.k.a. Ringtone). Jones has also made a \\"We Fly High\\" remix for the New York Giants and a \\"We Fly High\\" reggaeton version remixed by the famous reggaeton producer; Nely 'El Arma Secreta', or 'The Secret Weapon', which features Jones, Tego Calder√≥n and Don Omar. On the BET show Rap City, The Game used the second verse from his new album Doctor's Advocate from the song \\"Too Much\\" while rapping on the \\"We Fly High\\" beat. It was also featured in the Electronic Arts game Def Jam Icon. Soulja Boy's song \\"Report Card\\" samples the Ballin ad-lib. Infamous YouTube satirist Anthony Pinto has prominently featured \\"We Fly High\\" during the introduction and conclusion of his videos in support of the PlayStation 3 video game console, under the pseudonym \\"Chad Warden\\". Because of the infamy of these videos and the popularity of his persona, the comments of the song's official YouTube upload consist mainly of people referencing and quoting him.

He joined the Communist Party following victory in the Second Sino-Japanese War in April 1946. After the founding of the People's Republic, Gao worked in Jilin province.

In March 1983, he was admitted to the Jilin provincial party committee; in May 1985 he was named party chief of Jilin province. In April 1988 he was transferred to the central party authorities to take on the office of Executive Vice President of the Central Party School. After the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the leadership of People's Daily was reshuffled in order to ensure \\"political loyalty\\" of the newspaper, with Gao Di taking on the post of head of the newspaper. However, he later fell out of favour due to not having sufficiently supported Deng Xiaoping's southern tour speeches, and was removed as chief officer.„ÄäÈ†òÂ∞é‰∏≠ÂúãÁöÑÊñ∞‰∫∫Áâ©„ÄãÔºå‰ΩúËÄÖ È´òÊñ∞Ôºå In March 1993, he became a standing committee member of the 8th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; he retired and left politics in 1998.È´òÁãÑÁÆÄÂéÜ He was a member of the 12th and 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
