Soaring high above the surrounding landscape the castle commands views befitting any castle Penllyn Castle is a Norman architecture castle, located in Cowbridge, south-east of Bridgend, South Wales. Built by Robert Fitzhamon in 1135, the sheriff Earl of Gloucester, it shares an oblong tower like contemporary Ogmore Castle. The high-location was chosen as it gave clear-view over both the River Thaw and Ewenny River valleys. Reportedly attacked by Owain Glynd≈µr, today the two surviving main walls of the original castle stand on the edge of a low cliff above the River Thaw. They include near the base six courses of \\"herringbone\\" masonry, a feature of early Norman construction. These add to the academic theory that the castle was one of the first Norman structures built during Fitzhamon's occupation of Glamorgan. In Tudor times, the Turbeville family built a manor house in the residual grounds, for which the former castle keep forms one corner. In the 1790s, a new manor house was built by Miss Gwinnett between 1780‚Äì1790, and the old house which now lies derelict converted into a stable block. In 1846, after his return from Boulogne, France, where his father, ironmaster Jeremiah Homfray, had been living in order to escape his creditors after his bankruptcy, the castle was bought by John Homfray. Using a \\"Tudorbethan\\"-style to match the previous works undertaken by the Turbeville family, he rebuilt the estate between 1846‚Äì60. This included the construction of a new entrance lodge, which today itself is a Grade I listed building as part of the estates group value. Homfray demolished most of Miss Gwinnett's manor house, and rebuilt it in a contemporary Victorian architecture style with stucco-plaster walls, which itself today is only Grade II listed. The castle was sold to the Cory family in 1961 in order to pay death duties. The castle is not accessible to the public. In 2005, the semi-derelict castle stable block and manor house were both used as the main shooting location for Tooth and Claw, the second episode of the second series of the resurrected BBC One television series Doctor Who. The castle was set as a Victorian-era Scottish castle, home to some monks who were playing host to Queen Victoria. The castle was sold in October 2018 to Terence and Judith Edgell with a view to restoring it to its former glory and using it as their family home.

Early life  Stephens was born in North Shields, Northumberland, the seventh child of Rev. John Stephens (1772‚Äì1841), a Wesleyan Methodist, and brother of Edward and Samuel, both to achieve prominence in South Australia. Other brothers remained in Europe and achieved notability in their own way: James was 'J. R. Stephens' - a Wesleyan minister imprisoned for 18 months on charges of sedition and unlawful assembly as a result of his association with the Chartist movement; George was a noted philologist, and for many years Professor of English Literature at Copenhagen University . Stephens was educated in Leeds at Woodhouse Grove Academy (a boarding school for the sons of Methodist ministers) and subsequently at Leeds Grammar School, but he failed to display any great academic aptitude.  Career in England  After a period assisting the Rev. Thomas Blanshard in the Book-Room of the Wesleyan Methodists, he set up as a bookseller and publisher at 16 City Road, London, publishing from January 1830 onwards the Christian Advocate, aiming to report the proceedings of all Christian societies, bestowing particular attention to \\"facts which relate more immediately to the interests of Wesleyan Methodism\\".Advertisement - An irreparable breach with the Old Connection Wesleyan Methodist Conference occurred after Lord Sandon, the Earl of Harrowby, became Member of Parliament for Liverpool with the support of Jabez Bunting, a prominent Methodist. Since Methodism deprecated political activity in general, but was strongly abolitionist, Bunting's support of a candidate not committed to abolition was strongly criticised by Liverpudlian Methodists. The Conference objected to the Christian Advocate airing this criticism and withdrew all co-operation. Matters worsened when the Christian Advocate campaigned for disestablishment of the Church of England, a policy opposed by the Wesleyan Conference; the ramifications of this included the resignation of Stephens' brother Joseph from the Wesleyan Ministry. The Advocate ceased publication in 1840, merging with the Champion, but Stephens remained active as a publisher; presumably with radical sympathies - The Book of the Bastilles was published in 1841 by \\"J Stephens, Warwick-Lane , London\\". Stephens was impressed with Wakefield's proposals for the colonisation of South Australia, which he eulogised in his Land of Promise, followed by An Exposure of the absurd, unfounded, and contradictory Statements in James's Six Months in Australia, a response to criticisms by T. Horton James in his 1838 book Six Months in South Australia (the second edition of Land of Promise included the rebuttal of James and had the more neutral title History of South Australia but: 'Mr Stephens writes not so much as a historian of South Australia as its encomiast'). He edited the short-lived South Australian Colonist for George Fife Angas and the South Australian News, a monthly first published in 1841. While running his bookshop, he married Sophia, the only daughter of William Fleming of the Methodist Missionary Committee, and had one daughter. His wife died in 1836 and he remarried (Fidelia Jenkins) a few years later (1839).  Career in South Australia  Following the emigration of his brothers to South Australia, he, his daughter and his wife followed on the Arab, arriving on 23 January 1843: he commenced working as editor of the South Australian Register almost immediately. In July 1843 he founded The Adelaide Observer and acquired the South Australian Register in June 1845. Stephens gave public lectures on comets (on the occasion of the Great Comet of 1843), Total Abstinence and hydropathy treatment, and \\"sanatory reform\\" He was a champion of free press, small business, and good writing, and although a teetotaller, was broadminded and generous in his views. His newspaper was vigorous in exposing hypocrisy and injustices. In 1848 his presses were seized for debt and a rival obligingly printed two issues. His eldest daughter died on 31 March 1850. His health deteriorated, perhaps under the strain of libel actions and criticisms from people of influence. A large number of colonists published a letter of support for him in a supplement to The South Australian Register on 7 March 1850. He died at \\"Seacombe\\", the Brighton residence of his brother Edward, manager of the Bank of South Australia, on 28 November 1850. Controversies *In April 1843, as joint editor of The Register, he was involved with its owner James Allen in a libel of Southern Australian (later The South Australian) editor Archibald Macdougall. (Allen had previously been editor of Macdougall's South Australian Magazine.) Citing absence from the business due to illness, Allen shifted the onus to Stephens, who was however able to produce a directive from Allen authorising the text complained of. Clearly the relationship was not to last and probably the impetus for Stephens to found The Observer. *A running feud with bookseller George Charles Eastland Platts started when he took over a lease in Waterloo House, Hindley Street, previously tenanted by Platts, and advertised himself as \\"successor to Charles Platts\\". Platts accused Stephens of deceptive conduct and Stephens stated he had been offered the lease by F. Bayne, the owner's agent, so had not acted in bad faith. This became the new print shop and office for The Observer and The Adelaide Register. Platt had a kind of revenge by not forwarding to Stephens a number of bales of Indian newspapers incorrectly addressed to one of Platts' shops on Hindley Street. *Dr Ferdinand Von Sommer was one of many who felt the lash of Stephens's editorials and sought redress in the libel laws. He had been staying at Charles Colton's Royal Admiral Hotel and attempted to procure Calton's daughter Sarah for the night. Nothing of the sort transpired, but Colton was furious at the unprofessional conduct of someone he considered his friend as well as his medical adviser, and mentioned the fact to Stephens. The jury found for Von Sommer, and the \\"lustful and dirty minded Doctor\\", as Stephens had called him, was awarded damages of one farthing. *George Stevenson, editor of the South Australian Gazette and Colonial Register sued Stephens for libel after the South Australian Register accused \\"honest George Stevenson\\" of dishonesty while exercising his power of attorney at the Glen Osmond Mines during the absence the proprietor, Lewis William Gilles, brother of Osmond Gilles. Again, the jury found for the plaintiff and awarded damages of ¬£20. *One Michael Cook, a saddler, after being charged with rape of his servant girl, was roundly attacked in the pages of the Register. When the charge was dismissed, partly on the basis of the girl's previous consent and her being twelve years of age (that being in 1847 the age of consent), the South Australian took the side of the saddler, accusing Stephens of ruining Cook's good name. Stephens demanded a retraction, and when one was not forthcoming, sued the editor Andrew Murray. In December 1848 a public meeting was held at the Old Queen's Theatre supporting Stephens and the Freedom of the Press. Speakers included Daniel Fisher. *Captain Ellis sued Stephens for libel after a letter was published in the Register critical of Ellis's sacking without pay of an employee Macguillan who had used his employer's horse. The jury found for Ellis and awarded damages of one farthing. *He published a story which the Leworthy family felt libelled: the story concerned a \\"Windworth\\" family which emigrated on the ship Jonathan and engaged in reprehensible behaviour. The Leworthys had emigrated on the John Munn. The parallels between the \\"fiction\\" and their own circumstances were too numerous to be mere coincidence. a better ref somewhere? *In an obituary for businessman Samuel Stocks jun., he was rather frank in describing how the deceased had fallen into intemperate habits and ruined his own health after making a fortune from the Burra Burra mines. A petition calling for Stephens' sacking gathered some 150 signatures. Significantly, Stocks sen. took the side of Stephens. *John Lazar, manager of the New Queen's Theatre, sued Stephens for libel after he published, on 16 January 1850, a critique of an actor's performance in the play \\"Susan Hopley\\", objecting to the actor's use of lewd gestures and indecent language intended to be humorous. Again the libel was found proved and again damages of one farthing were awarded. In most of these proceedings, Stephens was represented by barristers George Milner Stephen and Richard Davies Hanson, both of whom had illustrious later careers. In 1850 a number of influential people signed a petition calling for prosecution of Stephens and closing of his newspapers. A declaration of support was published in the Register and appended to in successive issues. A public meeting held at Mount Barker, chaired by John Dunn showed popular support among farmers for his independence and opposition to taxation without representation.

The lake is formed by Kanopolis Dam. Completed in 1948 as a flood control and water conservation project of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the dam impounds the Smoky Hill River. History The Flood Control Act of 1938 authorized the construction of Kanopolis Dam and Lake, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began work in June 1940. The outbreak of World War II, however, led to a suspension of the effort in 1942, delaying the project for 3 1/2 years. The Corps of Engineers finally completed construction in 1948 at a cost of $12.3 million. Storage of water in the reservoir began February 17, 1948. Kanopolis Lake was the first reservoir built in the Corps of Engineers' Kansas City District which continues to oversee it to the present day. Geography Kanopolis Lake is located at (38.6327013, -97.9980411) at an elevation of . It lies in central Kansas in the Smoky Hills region of the Great Plains. It is located entirely within Ellsworth County. The reservoir is impounded at its southeastern end by Kanopolis Dam. The dam is located at (38.6166747, -97.9683822) at an elevation of . The Smoky Hill River is both the reservoir's primary inflow from the northwest and outflow to the southeast. Smaller tributaries include Alum Creek, which flows south into the northern end of the reservoir, and Bluff Creek, which flows north-northeast into the southwest part of the reservoir. Kansas Highway 141 runs generally north-south along the reservoir's eastern shore and across the top of Kanopolis Dam. There are two settlements at Kanopolis Lake, both unincorporated: Yankee Run on the western shore and Venango on the eastern shore immediately north of the dam. Hydrography The surface area, surface elevation, and water volume of the reservoir fluctuate based on inflow and local climatic conditions. In terms of capacity, the Corps of Engineers vertically divides the reservoir into a set of pools based on volume and water level, and the reservoir is considered full when filled to the capacity of its multi-purpose pool. When full, Kanopolis Lake has a surface area of , a surface elevation of , and a volume of . When filled to maximum capacity, it has a surface area of , a surface elevation of , and a volume of . The streambed underlying the reservoir has an elevation of . Since the reservoir's initial flooding, sedimentation has gradually accumulated on the reservoir bottom thus raising its elevation. When full, the reservoir has of shoreline while, at the top of its flood control pool, it has of shoreline. Infrastructure Kanopolis Dam is a rolled earth-fill embankment dam with riprap on its upstream face. It stands tall and long. At its crest, the dam has an elevation of . Management The Kansas City District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages Kanopolis Dam and Kanopolis Lake for the purposes of flood damage reduction, recreation, fish and wildlife management, and water supply and quality management. The Corps also oversees of land around the reservoir, conducting prairie restoration, prescribed burning, and tree planting in order to conserve soil and benefit wildlife. The Corps also leases 41 units of land totaling roughly to area farmers to use with designated wildlife management requirements. Of the land around the reservoir, the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism (KDWP) manages over as the Smoky Hill Wildlife Area. It has designated a portion of the Area as a wildlife refuge. The KDWP also stocks fish for the reservoir seasonally. Parks and recreation The Corps of Engineers manages three parks at Kanopolis Lake: Venango Park, Outlet Park, and Riverside Park. The largest, Venango Park, is located on the reservoir's eastern shore just north of Kanopolis Dam. It hosts campgrounds, hiking trails, an ATV trail, a swimming beach, and a boat ramp. Outlet Park is a small park that lies immediately below the dam at the confluence of the Smoky Hill River with Sand Creek. Riverside Park is on the south bank of the river just east of Outlet Park and hosts camping facilities. The Corps of Engineers Information Center is also located below the dam, just south of Outlet Park. The Corps also operates the Boldt Bluff and Yankee Run access areas, located on the reservoir's western shore, for fishing and primitive camping. The KDWP oversees Kanopolis State Park which is divided into two areas: the Horsethief Area, located on the reservoir's eastern shore north of Venango Park, and the Langley Point Area, located on the southern shore immediately west of the dam. Both areas host amphitheaters, boat ramps, and camping facilities. The Horsethief Area also includes extensive hiking trails, several of which extend into the Smoky Hill Wildlife Area. The Langley Point Area also includes a baseball field, a marina, and a swimming beach. KDWP also manages Mushroom Rock State Park located approximately north of the reservoir. Kanopolis Lake is open to sport fishing. Almost of public land near the reservoir, most of it upstream along the Smoky Hill River, are open to hunting. =Points of interest= The Faris Caves are located in the Smoky Hill Wildlife Area northwest of the reservoir. Carved into the sandstone cliffs along the Smoky Hill River by early American settlers, they once served as a school house, living quarters, and a milk house. Wildlife Fish species resident in Kanopolis Lake include channel catfish, crappie, largemouth bass, saugeye, walleye, white bass, and wiper. Game animals living around the reservoir include coyotes, deer, pheasants, prairie chickens, rabbits, quail, squirrels, turkeys, and various waterfowl. Bald eagles and ospreys migrate through the area in winter.

Coat of arms of the Fregoso family Youth Giacomo's father, Domenico Fregoso, was elected doge of Genoa in 1370. Giacomo himself received an advanced education, became bachelor of law and joined the trading business of the Fregoso family. He also participated in the management of the Maona of Chios. Following some commercial successes, Giacoma participated in the wars led by the Republic, in particular during the conquest of Cyprus of 1373. Back in Genoa, his father gave him the charge of the defense of the Eastern Riviera. When Domenico was toppled in 1378, the whole Fregoso family was driven into exile. He stayed away from Genoa under the following two dogeships of Antoniotto Adorno and Nicol√≤ Guarco. He only returned in the city when the new doge Leonardo Montaldo promulgated a law of amnesty in 1383. After his return, Giacomo managed to be elected repeatedly to the Council of the Ancients that governed the Republic and the doge Adorno put him in charge of the reception of Pope Urban VI in the city. Later, he was also put in charge of diplomatic relations of the Republic with Amedeo VII, count of Savoy. In the meantime, he kept on pursuing his economic activity, specifically with the Maona. Dogeship In 1390, a long-lasting political crisis came to an acme and the doge Adorno had to escape Genoa and seek refuge in Savona. The population in arms gathered and chose Giacomo as the new doge on August 3. Giacomo seem to have enjoyed a reputation as a good manager due to his commercial successes, which may explain his nomination. In 1391, Antoniotto Adorno gathered an army of 800 men to reconquer his lost position. Fregoso refused to fight and begin a civil war, leading to the rebels entering the city unopposed and, on April 6, Adorno was reelected doge. Ambassador After his deposition, Giacomo was invited by doge Adorno to a great banquet in his honor and allowed to remain in the city. But rapidly, a riot in Savona drove a wedge between the two clans. As a consequence, Giacomo was sent to the castle-prison of Lerici until 1396. Two years later, he returned to the republic and was re-elected to the Council. He was also nominated as ambassador of the Republic to Florence and Pisa. After Genoa fell under French domination, he continued his diplomatic career in Milan, Rome and finally Venice. In 1411, at the age of 71, Giacomo received the charge of reorganizing the Genoese navy in order to defend the coasts of the Republic against the raids of North African pirates. No archival traces of him remain after this date and it is usually assumed that he died around 1420 and was buried with his family in the church of Santa Marta. 1340 births 1420 deaths Doges of Genoa 14th-century Genoese people 14th-century rulers in Europe Ambassadors of the Republic of Genoa Medieval Italian diplomats 15th-century Italian people 15th-century diplomats ","title":"Giacomo Fregoso"},{"id":"36494476","text":"Julie Fabre (born 27 June 1976) is a retired French synchronized swimmer who competed in the 1996 Summer Olympics.

The band calls their sound \\"Cowboy Swing & Hillbilly Blues\\" with Jagger on mandolin, guitar & vocals; and Harrell on guitar, piano, accordion & vocals. They are often joined by other musicians. The Border Blasters are noted for their easy-going on-stage camaraderie coupled with tight harmonies and raw, rootsy musicianship. The band takes their name from the high-powered radio stations along the US/Mexico border that broadcast an eclectic mix of country, folk, blues, gospel and quirky advertisements around the world beginning in the early 1930s through the mid-1960s.  History and discography  The group started in 1976 playing their first gig at Gruene Hall, and played consistently in and around Austin, Texas at popular venues such as the Armadillo World Headquarters, The Split Rail, The Broken Spoke, The Skyline Club, Saxon Pub, including a two-year standing show at Raven's Garage on Sixth Street (Austin, Texas). In 1988 The Border Blasters released a 16-song cassette tape titled \\"It's Too Much\\" produced by the legendary T.J. \\"Tiny\\" McFarland and engineered by the equally legendary Joe Gracey recorded at Lone Star Studios in Austin, Texas. In addition to the core band, now featuring Keith Carper on upright bass and drummer Phil Johnson, The Border Blasters were joined by special guests Kimmie Rhodes, Ponty Bone, Alvin Crow, Danny Levin, Freddie Krc, L.E. McCollough and Drew Castaneda. This tape was well received in Texas, getting airplay on most non-commercial stations in Texas including KUT and reached the Top-20 of KNON in that year. In 1990 Jagger augmented his performances with The Border Blasters by joining the Austin Lounge Lizards to replace mandolinist Paul \\"Tex\\" Sweeney who had recently left the band. During this time Jagger received two Austin Music Awards as part of that band. In 1991 Jagger left Austin to move to Fort Davis, Texas. Shortly thereafter Harrell moved to Fort Davis, too, and they continued playing in the area, returning to Austin occasionally for shows. In 2007 Jagger sent the 2\\" master tapes from the \\"It's Too Much\\" album to friend David Sinko in Nashville to have the aging tape digitized. Sinko, upon hearing the tracks, encouraged Jagger to let him remix and remaster the album. They released the album in 2008 under the title \\"Blast From The Past.\\" The album spent 3 months in the Top 10 of the Freeform American Roots music chart, and was voted by reporting radio hosts the #2 Best Album in its category for 2008. The album also reached #24 on the Euro- Americana Chart. The Border Blasters appeared on the Main Stage at Kerrville Folk Festival in 2009 and were featured artists at the International Folk Alliance conferences in 2009 and 2010 in Memphis, Tennessee. During one of these trips to Memphis the band recorded 8 tracks at Sun Studios, with Mark Rubin on upright bass & tuba, releasing the album in 2011 as \\"The Sun Session\\", which also spent 2 months in the Top-20 of the Freeform American Roots Chart.

Clear Springs was named for the natural springs water source for the settlement, which is now covered by Lake Dunlap. The location on which Clear Springs sits had been surveyed by James Bowie. In 1873 a cotton-gin and general store were built for the processing, storage, and sale of cotton and goods. Wagon loads of cotton were brought from the region to the gin be to be weighed, sold and processed. The community had a post office in 1874 and called the location Bernhardsville. In 1875, the name was officially changed to Clear Springs. In the 1890s, Clear Springs hosted the general store, cotton gin, and a population of 100. The post office was closed in 1906, however the residents stayed on to support the community. In later years the store was incorporated into a dance hall and saloon. The dance hall became a local favorite as it was the only establishment of the kind for several miles. Clear Springs had two businesses and a school in 1946. The school was consolidated with the New Braunfels school district in the 1950s. In 1990, several businesses as well as a church served a population of 60. The historical Clear Springs Hall and Store now houses Clear Springs Restaurant.

He was initially trained in Britain and as a three-year-old in 2011 he won the Great Voltigeur Stakes, was runner-up in the Breeders' Cup Turf and finished third in the St Leger. In 2012 he won the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot. In 2013 he was sold and sent to be trained in Australia where he won the Herbert Power Stakes. He returned to Europe for three races in 2015 before being retired to stud. Background Sea Moon is a bay horse with a white blaze and three white socks, bred by his owner, Khalid Abdullah's Juddmonte Farms. Sea Moon is the best horse to date sired by Beat Hollow whose wins included the Grand Prix de Paris and the Arlington Million. His dam, Eva Luna (USA), won the Park Hill Stakes and became a highly successful broodmare: her progeny include the St Leger winner Brian Boru and Soviet Moon, the dam of Workforce. Sea Moon was sent into training with Michael Stoute at Freemason Lodge stables at Newmarket, Suffolk. He has been ridden in most of his races by Ryan Moore. In January 2013 Sea Moon was sold to prominent Australian racehorse owner Lloyd Williams. Racing career =2010: two-year-old season= Sea Moon made his first appearance on 12 October when he finished second in a one-mile maiden race at Leicester Racecourse. Two weeks later, he started at odds of 1/5 in a similar event at Great Yarmouth Racecourse and recorded his first victory, winning by a length from Little Rocky. =2011: three-year-old season= Sea Moon did not appear as a three-year-old until 11 June when he appeared in a handicap race over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse. Carrying top weight of 133 pounds he took the lead inside the final furlong and won by one and three quarter lengths from Flag Officer. After a break of two months, Sea Moon returned to York and was moved up in class to contest the Group Two Great Voltigeur Stakes, a recognised trial for the St Leger Stakes. Ridden by Richard Hughes in place of the injured Moore, Sea Moon took the lead in the final quarter mile and quickly drew clear of the field. Despite being eased near the finish he won by eight lengths from Al Kazeem. Marcus Armytage, writing in the Daily Telegraph, called the performance \\"a stunning display\\". In the St Leger at Doncaster Racecourse on 10 September, Sea Moon, ridden by Olivier Peslier, was made 2/1 favourite ahead of the 1000 Guineas winner Blue Bunting. Peslier restrained the colt in the early stages before attempting to challenge in the straight. He was unable to obtain a clear run and was blocked twice before switching to the outside inside the final furlong. Sea Moon finished strongly but was beaten into third place behind Masked Marvel and Brown Panther. His performance divided press opinions: some considered him an unlucky loser, while others claimed that he never looked likely to win. On his final start of the year, Sea Moon was sent to the United States for the Breeders' Cup Turf at Churchill Downs. Moore held the colt towards the rear of the field before challenging for the lead in the straight. He finished second of the nine runners, beaten two and a quarter lengths by St Nicholas Abbey. =2012: four-year-old season= Sea Moon began his 2012 campaign in the Listed Southern Daily Echo Tapster Stakes on firm ground at Goodwood on 26 May.

The Royal Stables () is the mews (i.e., combined stables and carriage house) of the Danish Monarchy which provides the ceremonial transport for the Danish Royal Family during state events and festive occasions. The Royal Stables are located at Christiansborg Palace on the island of Slotsholmen in central Copenhagen, Denmark. In 1789, the number of horses reached a peak with 270 horses stabled. Nowadays, there are about 20 horses in the Royal Stables. The Royal Stables are regularly open to the public and include a small museum. The state coaches and other carriages are kept there, along with about 20 horses. History =Copenhagen Castle= The Crown Equerry Building by Frederiksholms Canal. Already in the 16th century, a large zigzag shaped stable complex was located on Slotsholmen behind the Copenhagen Castle which housed the king's horses and carriages. In 1590, a foreign traveller counted 52 horses in the stables.Gamrath, Helge: K√∏benhavns Slot. In: Hvidt et al, vol. 1, pp. 87‚Äì88. During the reign of the horse enthusiastic King Christian V at the end of the 17th century there were about 170 horses and 152 staff in the Royal Stables. There was direct access from the castle to the stables by means of a secret passage, and the king was seen there daily.Gamrath, Helge: K√∏benhavns Slot. In: Hvidt et al, vol. 1, pp. 136‚Äì138. After his accession to the throne in 1699, King Frederick IV carried out a large reconstruction of the stable complex, leading to a rectangular riding ground surrounded by new stables and carriage house.Gamrath, Helge: K√∏benhavns Slot. In: Hvidt et al, vol. 1, pp. 141‚Äì143. Furthermore, from 1703 to 1705 he had a new Baroque building constructed adjacent to Frederiksholms Canal to house the Crown Equerry and the staff at the Royal Stables. The Crown Equerry building still exists and today houses the Ministry of Education and the Ministry for Ecclesiastical Affairs. =Christiansborg Palace= The first Christiansborg Palace with the Riding Grounds surrounded by the Royal Stables Shortly after his accession to the throne in 1730, King Christian VI had the old and outdated Copenhagen Castle torn down to make way for a new Baroque palace: the first Christiansborg Palace. The old stable complex behind Copenhagen Castle was also torn down to make way for a new and larger stable complex. During the construction work, the many horses of the Royal Stables were temporarily stabled at Frederiksberg Palace, Charlottenborg Palace and Rosenborg Castle.Hauschildt og Nitschke, p. 28. The new and still existing stable complex was constructed from 1738 to 1745 by the architects Elias David H√§usser and Nicolai Eigtved. The new complex included an outdoor riding ground surrounded by buildings containing an indoor riding school as well as stables with room for a total of 87 riding horses and 165 carriage horses. Part of these stable buildings still remain unchanged since their inauguration in 1746 with an extravagant decoration of marble pillars. The number of horses reached a peak in 1789 when 270 horses were stabled at Christiansborg. In the course of the 20th century, the horses were gradually replaced by cars and today about 20 horses are stabled in the Royal Stables. Carriage horses The horses in the Royal Stables today are for the most part either Kladrubers from the Czech Republic or Danish Warmblood, though this has not always been the case. For centuries locally bred Frederiksborg horses took pride of place in the harness on major state occasions, until problems due to inbreeding led to their use being discontinued in the mid-19th century. The horses are regularly exercised on Christiansborg's riding ground and in the streets of Copenhagen.

In 2008, he was briefly arrested for protesting the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay. In the same year, he published a memoir entitled Facing Reality, My Path to Joining the Democratic Movement via the Internet. In it, he wrote: \\"The biggest loss for a human being is the loss of the right to be a human being; the biggest criminal is the one who robs others of human rights; the most pitiful person is the one who does not understand human rights; the one who deserves criticism most is the one who forgets human rights; the most cowardly person is the one who accepts the loss of human rights. I once deserved to be criticized and was once a coward.\\" In 2010, Hoi published a fictional version of the death of Nguyen Van Khuong, a young man reportedly beaten to death by police in Bac Giang province after a traffic stop. On 28 October of that year, he was arrested again, immediately ahead of an ASEAN summit. On 26 January 2011, he was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for \\"spreading anti-government propaganda\\" for posting copies of pro-democracy articles online. As is the norm in Vietnam, the trial was closed to media. On 26 April, Hoi's sentence was reduced by an appeals court to five years in prison, followed by three years' house arrest. Amnesty International designated Hoi a prisoner of conscience and called for his immediate release. The Committee to Protect Journalists also protested the sentence, calling on the government to release him. Front Line Defenders stated that the charges against Hoi were \\"a direct result of his legitimate and peaceful work as a democracy activist and in the defence of human rights\\". In 2011, Human Rights Watch awarded him its Hellman/Hammett award, \\"recognizing writers who demonstrate courage and conviction in the face of political persecution\\". Hoi is married to Hoang Thi Tuoi.

During the Byzantine times, it functioned as the katholikon of the Latomos Monastery (), and was adorned with rich mosaic and fresco decoration, which was renewed in the 12th‚Äì14th centuries. Today, the surviving examples are of high artistic quality. Under Ottoman rule, the building was converted into a mosque (probably in the 16th century), until it was reconsecrated as a Greek Orthodox church in 1921, thus receiving its present name. In 1988, this monument was included among the Paleochristian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki on the list of World Heritage Sites by UNESCO.  Architecture  The original architecture of the Church of Hosios David was constructed in a cross pattern with squares as the main shape of the floor plan. This pattern would later become more popular. The structure contained square bays in the corners. The bays all connected to the main cross room via hallways. The bays also connected to the outside. Interior Mosaic of Theophany Sometime during the middle Byzantine period the structure was damaged by earthquakes. Parts of the structure collapsed including the tribelon. The middle Byzantine period also saw the addition of marbling and a second round of fresco paintings.  Decoration  The marble decoration in the Church of Hosios David depicted crosses, vines and leaves in swirling detailing. The mosaic of the Theophany is a detailed mosaic in a naturalistic style depicting Christ holding a text saying in Greek, ‚ÄúBehold our God, in whom we hope and we rejoice in our salvation, that he may grand rest to this home.‚Äù The mosaic contains symbolism indicating the Evangelists. The mosaic representing the Theophany is complex, with a detailed border, and a lot of elements within the scene. The focus of the image is Christ as shown by his gaze, his position in the center and the halos surrounding Christ‚Äôs head and body. Byzantine murals were discovered under the plaster at the Church of Hosios David. These murals are what is left of extensive fresco paintings from the middle Byzantine period approximately 1160-70. The east part of the south and north barrel-vaults contains depictions of the nativity, the presentation in the temple, our lady of the passion, Christ on the mount of olives, entry into Jerusalem, theophany, and decorative panels meant to resemble marble slabs. The south barrel has the rest of the nativity and presentation in the temple. This area also depicts images of the baptism and transfiguration. The Church of Hosios David contains few borders between the different fresco scenes, which is an uncommon feature for this time. Most of the frescos were created during the middle Byzantine period. The frescos: our lady of the passion, the entry into Jerusalem, and Christ on the Mount of Olives are likely later, during the Palaeologan period, approximately c. 1300.. Many of the frescos today are damaged because of effects of time such as: earthquakes, cracking, water damage, and the plaster applied to cover them in the Turkish era.  After the Byzantine Era  The Church of Hosios David has a simple exterior and is more removed from the heart of Thessaloniki, closer to the mountains. This contributed to the theory that the Church of Hosios David was not converted to a mosque immediately after the Turks conquered the area, as the Turks converted all the best churches, and best locations first. The mosque was called Suluca or Murad Mosque. When the Church of Hosios David was converted to a mosque the walls and by extension the art was covered with plaster. In addition the Turkish period added a minaret at the south-west corner bay. Only the base remains today, together with the spiral staircase with in the remaining part of the minaret.

BBC News. 8 August 2016. against the Syrian government, supported by Hezbollah, Shia militias and Russia, and against the Kurdish-majority People's Protection Units (YPG). The battle began on 19 July 2012 and was part of the ongoing Syrian Civil War. A stalemate that had been in place for four years finally ended in July 2016, when Syrian government troops closed the rebels' last supply line into Aleppo with the support of Russian airstrikes. In response, rebel forces launched unsuccessful counteroffensives in September and October that failed to break the siege; in November, government forces embarked on a decisive campaign that resulted in the recapture of all of Aleppo by December 2016. The Syrian government victory is widely seen as a turning point in Syria's civil war. The large-scale devastation of the battle and its importance led combatants to name it the \\"mother of battles\\" or \\"Syria's Stalingrad\\". The battle was marked by widespread violence against civilians,BBC News, 28 April 2014 BBC witnesses devastation of Syrian air bombardment on Aleppo repeated targeting of hospitals and schools (mostly by pro-government air forces and to a lesser extent by the rebels), and indiscriminate aerial strikes and shelling against civilian areas. It was also marked by the inability of the international community to resolve the conflict peacefully. The UN special envoy to Syria proposed to end the battle by giving East Aleppo autonomy, but this was rejected by the Syrian government. Hundreds of thousands of residents were displaced by the fighting and efforts to provide aid to civilians or facilitate evacuation were routinely disrupted by continued combat and mistrust between the opposing sides. There were frequent incidences of war crimes during the battle, including the use of chemical weapons by both Syrian government forces and rebel forces, the use of barrel bombs by the Syrian Air Force, the dropping of cluster munitions on populated areas by Russian and Syrian forces, the carrying out of \\"double tap\\" airstrikes to target rescue workers responding to previous strikes, summary executions of civilians and captured soldiers by both sides,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/dec/20/iran-brutalizing- aleppo-executing-most-atrocious-w/ indiscriminate shelling and use of highly inaccurate improvised artillery by rebel forces. During the 2016 Syrian government offensive, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights warned that \\"crimes of historic proportions\\" were being committed in Aleppo. After four years of fighting, the battle represents one of the longest sieges in modern warfare and one of the bloodiest battles of the Syrian Civil War, leaving an estimated 31,000 people dead, almost a tenth of the estimated overall war casualties at that time. Fighting also caused severe destruction to the Old City of Aleppo, a UNESCO World Heritage site. An estimated 33,500 buildings have been either damaged or destroyed.  Background  In 2011, Aleppo was Syria's largest city, with a population of 2.5 million people. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it has been described by Time as Syria's commercial capital. Author Diana Darke has written that \\"The city has long been multi-cultural, a complex mix of Kurds, Iranians, Turkmen, Armenians and Circassians overlaid on an Arab base in which multi-denominational churches and mosques still share the space.\\"Diana Darke \\"Aleppo: Is besieged Syrian city facing last gasp?\\" BBC 22 July 2016 Nationwide protests against President Bashar al-Assad began on 15 March 2011, as part of the Arab Spring. Anti-government protests were held in several districts of Aleppo on 12 August 2011, including the city's Sakhour district. At least two protesters had been shot dead by security forces during a demonstration in Sakhour with tens of thousands attendees. Regular large protests started in Aleppo in May 2012.\\"Students Are Assailed at a Protest in Syria\\" The New York Times 17 May 2012 During this period, government-organized rallies in support of itself also occurred. Aleppo had remained undisturbed and largely supportive of the government by the 16-month-long conflict until 22 July 2012, when rebel fighters from the neighboring villages converged and penetrated into it, to which the government responded with heavy-handed, indiscriminate bombardments of the city. On 16 February 2012, the UN General Assembly issued a resolution with a vote of 137 in favour, 12 against, and 17 abstentions, and called on Syria \\"to immediately put an end to all human rights violations and attacks against civilians.\\"  Combatants  Major Yasser Abdul Rahim, commander of Fatah Halab and field commander of the Sham Legion in Aleppo, coordinates an attack on YPG positions in Aleppo, 2 October 2015. At the beginning of the Battle of Aleppo, rebels reportedly had between 6,000 and 7,000 fighters in 18 battalions. The largest rebel group was the al- Tawhid Brigade and the most prominent was the Free Syrian Army, largely composed of army defectors. Most of the rebels came from the Aleppo countryside and from towns including Al-Bab, Marea, Azaz, Tel Rifaat and Manbij. A resident of Aleppo reportedly accused the rebels of using civilian homes for shelter. On 19 November 2012, the rebel fighters‚Äîparticularly the al-Tawhid Brigade and the al-Nusra Front‚Äîinitially rejected the newly formed Syrian National Coalition. However, the next day the rebels withdrew their rejection. By December, rebel fighters were commonly looting for supplies; they switched their loyalties to groups that had more to share. This new approach led to the killing of at least one rebel commander following a dispute; fighters retreating with their loot caused the loss of a frontline position and the failure of an attack on a Kurdish neighborhood. The looting cost the rebel fighters much popular support. Islamic extremists and foreign fighters, many of whom were experienced and came from the ongoing insurgency in neighboring Iraq, joined the battle. Jihadists reportedly came from across the Muslim world. Jacques B√©r√®s, a French surgeon who treated wounded fighters, reported a significant number of foreign fighters, most of whom had Islamist goals and were not directly interested in Bashar al-Assad. They included Libyans, Chechens, and Frenchmen. B√©r√®s contrasted the situation in Aleppo with that in Idlib and Homs, where foreign forces were not common. Some FSA brigades cooperated with Mujahideen fighters. Four hundred Turkmen joined the battle under Sultan Abdulhamid Han. By 2016, the rebel factions still included internationally recognized terrorist groups such as Al-Nusra Front; they numbered 1,000 fighters in October 2016. A destroyed government tank on a road in Aleppo Hezbollah, which by 2013 joined the Syrian Civil War in support for President al-Assad, was also designated as a terrorist group by various organizations. The government retained some support in Aleppo; in 2012 a rebel commander said, \\"around 70% of Aleppo city is with the regime\\". During the course of the battle, Assad lost support from Aleppo's wealthy class. In 2012, CBS News reported that 48 elite businessmen who were the primary financiers for the government switched sides. For the first time, the government's Syrian Arab Army engaged in urban warfare. They divided their forces into groups of 40 soldiers each. These were armed mostly with automatic rifles and anti-tank rockets and artillery, tanks and helicopters were only used for support. In August 2012, the army deployed its elite units. and eventually, after the rebels executed Zeino al-Berri, tribal leader of the al-Berri tribe, the tribe joined the fight against the rebels. Initially, the Christian community tried to avoid taking sides in the conflict. However, many Christians supported the Army and some formed militias aligned with the government following the capture of their quarters by the Syrian Army. Many Christian Armenians also supported the Syrian Army. Some of Aleppo's Armenians claimed Turkey supported the FSA to attack Armenians and Arab Christians. In 2012, one Armenian militia had around 150 fighters. At the beginning of the battle, Aleppo's Kurds formed armed groups, most notably the Saladin Ayubi Brigade, which worked with the opposition. Units of the Kurdish Front, part of the FSA and allied with the Democratic Union Party (PYD), were formed later in 2013. The PYD had poor relations with both sides. Its People's Protection Units (YPG) stayed out of Arab areas and insisted the FSA stay out of the Kurdish area. They did not initially fight the Syrian Army unless attacked. The Kurdish areas in Aleppo mainly came under PYD control. At various points in the conflict, the Kurds joined the opposition against pro-government forces. However, the YPG- controlled neighborhood of Sheikh Maqsood came under a siege by both Syrian government forces and the rebels. In September 2015, the rebels accused the YPG of having a deal with the government, while the YPG accused the rebels of shelling the neighborhood. Between November and December 2015, the conflict between the rebels and US-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the rest of Aleppo province escalated. Truce attempts largely failed to stop the fighting. The situation escalated in February 2016, when the SDF followed up on advances by the Syrian Armed Forces, backed by Russian airstrikes, and they themselves took territory north of Aleppo city from the rebels. Starting in late September 2015, Russian warplanes had carried out their very first attacks in Syria. The Russian bombing campaign included strikes against rebel forces in Aleppo.  Course of the battle  = 2012: Initial rebel attack and capture of Eastern Aleppo = Gunfire between rebels and security forces broke out in and around Salaheddine, a district in the city's southwest, on the night of 19 July 2012. In late July and early August 2012, the FSA continued its offensive in Aleppo, with both sides suffering a high level of casualties. Rebel commanders said their main aim was to capture the city center. On 30 July, the rebels seized a strategic checkpoint in Anadan, a town north of Aleppo, gaining a direct route between the city and the Turkish border‚Äîan important rebel supply base. They also captured Al-Bab, an army base northeast of the city. Later, rebels attacked the air base at Minakh, northwest of Aleppo, with arms and tanks captured at the Anadan checkpoint. Opposition forces continued to gain territory in the city, controlling most of eastern and southwestern Aleppo, including Salaheddine and parts of Hamdaniyeh. They continued to target security centers and police stations as clashes erupted near the Air Force intelligence headquarters in Aleppo's northwestern district Zahraa. Rebels over-ran several police stations and posts in the central and southern districts of Bab al-Nerab, Al-Miersa and Salhain, seizing a significant quantity of arms and ammunition.

In December 2012, the al-Nusra Front unilaterally declared a no-fly zone and threatened to shoot down commercial aircraft, alleging that the government was using them to transport loyalist troops and military supplies. After multiple attacks on Aleppo International Airport, all flights were suspended on 1 January 2013. The following month, the rebels seized Umayyad Mosque; and during the battle, the mosque's museum caught fire and its ceiling collapsed. On 9 June, the Syrian Army announced the start of \\"Operation Northern Storm\\", an attempt to recapture territory in and around the city. Between 7 and 14 June, army troops, government militiamen and Hezbollah fighters launched the operation. Over a one-week period, government forces advanced in the city and the countryside, pushing back the rebels. However, according to an opposition activist, on 14 June the situation started reversing after rebels halted an armored reinforcement column from Aleppo that was heading for two Shiite villages northwest of the city. On 8 November, the Syrian Army started an offensive against the rebel-held Base 80, launching \\"the heaviest barrage in more than a year\\". Al Jazeera wrote that a government victory would cut the rebels' route between the city and al-Bab. Two days later, Reuters reported that the rebels had regrouped to fight the Syrian army. Fifteen rebels were killed and the army recaptured the base. The following month, the army partially besieged the city in Operation Canopus Star. During the offensive, Army helicopters attacked with barrel bombs, killing more than a thousand people, according to the Free Syrian Army's Abu Firas Al-Halabi. = 2014: Syrian government encirclement of the rebels = Government forces, having lifted the siege of Aleppo in October 2013, continued their offensive in 2014. This culminated in the capture of the Sheikh Najjar industrial district north of Aleppo and the lifting of the siege of Aleppo Central Prison on 22 May 2014, which contained a garrison of government soldiers that had resisted rebel forces since 2012. A ceasefire proposal was presented by a UN envoy in November; under the proposal humanitarian aid would be delivered to Aleppo following the cessation of hostilities. President Assad said the ceasefire plan was \\"worth studying\\", and according to the UN envoy the Syrian government was \\"seriously studying\\" the proposal. The FSA rejected the plan; its military commander Zaher al-Saket said they had \\"learned not to trust the [Bashar al-] Assad regime because they are cunning and only want to buy time\\". = 2015: War of attrition = Aleppo residents waiting in a bread line during the Syrian civil war In early January, the rebels recaptured the Majbal (sawmills) area of al-Brej and captured the southern entrance of the stone quarries known as al-Misat, forcing government troops to retreat to the north. Rebels also seized the Manasher al-Brej area. They tried to advance and take control of al-Brej Hill, with which they could seize the military supply road running between Aleppo Central Prison and the Handarat and al-Mallah areas. At the end of January, the rebels took control over some positions in al-Brej Hill. In mid-February, the Syrian Arab Army and its allies launched a major offensive in the northern Aleppo countryside, with the aim of cutting the last rebel supply routes into the city, and relieving the rebel siege of the Shi'a-majority towns Zahra'a and Nubl to the northwest of Aleppo. They quickly captured several villages, but bad weather conditions and an inability to call up reinforcements stalled the government offensive. A few days later, the rebels launched a counter- offensive, retaking two of four positions they had lost to Syrian government forces. On 9 March, opposition forces launched an assault on Handarat, north of Aleppo, after reportedly noticing confusion in the ranks of Syrian government troops after the February fighting. Opposition sources said the rebels had captured 40‚Äì50% of the village, or possibly even 75%, while the Army remained in control of the northern portion of Handarat. In contrast, a Syrian Army source stated they still controlled 80% of Handarat. On 18 March, after almost 10 days of fighting, the Syrian Army had fully expelled the rebels from Handarat, and re-established control of the village. Rebel forces use tunnel bombs under the Al-Hatab Square, in preparation for an assault on government troops in April 2015. On 13 April, Islamist opposition forces and al-Nusra Front renewed their assault on the Air Force Intelligence building, utilizing a tunnel bomb followed by an assault. Much of the Air Force Intelligence building was reportedly damaged as a result of the tunnel bomb. Between 27‚Äì29 April, the FSA and Ahrar ash-Sham launched an operation in the old city of Aleppo and Al-Hatab Square in the Al-Jdayde (Jdeideh) District, which included tunnel bombs and the shelling of buildings where soldiers were stationed. The rebels claimed to have killed 76 troops in these operations. Sahat Al Hatab square and the buildings around it were left devastated as a result of this operation. Sham Legion multiple rocket launcher mounted on a technical launch rockets at YPG positions in Aleppo, 2 October 2015. In preparation for a new offensive, the rebels heavily shelled government-held parts of Aleppo, leaving 43 civilians dead and 190 wounded on 15 June. On 17 June, rebel forces captured the western neighborhood of Rashideen from Syrian government forces. Throughout 19 and 20 June, a new round of rebel shelling killed 19 more civilians. In early July, two rebel coalitions launched an offensive against the government-held western half of the city. During five days of fighting, the rebels seized the Scientific Research Center on Aleppo's western outskirts, which was being used as a military barracks. Two rebel attacks on the Jamiyat al-Zahra area were repelled. Government forces launched an unsuccessful counter-attack against the Scientific Research Center. In mid- October, ISIL captured four rebel-held villages northeast of Aleppo, while the Army seized the Syria-Turkey Free Trade Zone, the al-Ahdath juvenile prison and cement plant. Meanwhile, the SAA and Hezbollah launched an offensive south of Aleppo, reporting they had captured of territory in one month. By late December, reporting that they were in control of 3/4 of the southern Aleppo countryside. By the end of 2015, only 80 doctors were left in eastern, rebel- held part of Aleppo, or only one for 7,000 residents, while only one bakery was left to serve 120,000 people. = 2016: Supply lines cut, surrender, and evacuation = Destroyed area in Aleppo The situation in Aleppo on 20 August 2016, when both the rebels and Syrian government forces besieged each other By 2016, it was estimated that the population of rebel-held Eastern Aleppo had been reduced to 300,000, while 1.5 million were living in government-held Western Aleppo. In early February 2016, Syrian government forces and their allies broke a three-year rebel siege of two Shi'ite towns of Nubl and Zahraa, cutting off a main insurgent route to nearby Turkey. On 4 February, the towns of Mayer and Kafr Naya were recaptured by government forces. On 5 February, the government captured the village of Ratyan, to the northwest of Aleppo. On 25 June, the Syrian Army and allied forces began their long-awaited North-west Aleppo offensive. The ultimate goal of the offensive was to cut off the Castello highway, which would cut off the last supply route for rebels inside the city, thus fully encircling remaining opposition forces. By late July, Syrian government forces had managed to sever the last rebel supply line coming from the north, and completely surrounded Aleppo. However, within days, the rebels launched a large-scale counterattack south of Aleppo, in an attempt to both open a new supply line into rebel-held parts of the city and cut-off the government-held side. The whole campaign, including both the Army's offensive and subsequent rebel counter-offensive, was seen by both sides as possibly deciding the fate of the entire war. After a week of heavy fighting, rebels both inside and outside Aleppo advanced into the Ramouseh neighborhood, linked up and captured it, while also seizing the Al-Ramousah Military Academy. With these advances, the rebels managed to cut the government's supply line into the government-held part of west AleppoFactions incur regime, the Russians, the Iranians and the Lebanese Hezbollah the biggest spiritual and military loss since 2013 and announced the Army's siege of rebel-held east Aleppo had been broken. However, the new rebel supply line was still under Army artillery fire and being hit by air-strikes, making both sides essentially under siege. Since the rebel offensive started, at least 130 civilians had been killed, most by rebel shelling of government-held districts. 500 fighters on both sides also died, mostly rebels. However, on 4 September, the Syrian Armed forces recaptured the Technical College, Armament college and artillery college, thus imposing the siege on Aleppo once again. Later that week they recaptured the Ramouseh district and reversed almost all rebel gains made since 30 July. The Syrian Government forces then started an offensive to capture eastern Aleppo on 22 September, taking 15‚Äì20% of the rebel-held part of Aleppo. Rebels started an attack on western Aleppo in late October, which failed, with government forces retaking areas in the south-west that they had lost to the rebel's late July offensive. The Syrian Army then launched an offensive, aimed at finishing rebel-held Aleppo once and for all, during which they captured the Hanano district, Sakhour district, Jabal Badro district, Bustan al-Basha district, Hellok district, Sheikh Kheder district, Sheikh Fares district Haydariyah district, Ayn al-Tal industrial district and reportedly the research housing south of Jabal Badro. They also captured the Ard' Al Hamra district, reportedly cutting rebel-held territory in Aleppo by 40‚Äì45%. By 13 December 2016, only 5% of the original territory of the city remained in rebel hands. A ceasefire was announced and the fighting stopped in order to allow the evacuation of civilians and rebels. The buses were prepared for the evacuation. However, the deal fell apart the next day, when the Syrian Government resumed their intense bombing of eastern Aleppo, with both sides blaming the other for the resumed fighting. The deal was revived on 15 December with first convoy of evacuees leaving. The evacuation was however suspended on the next day. Another deal was reached on 18 December and evacuation resumed later in the day. The evacuation again stalled on 20 December, but resumed on the following day. On 22 December, the evacuation was completed while the Syrian Army declared it had taken complete control of the city. Red Cross later confirmed that the evacuation of all civilians and rebels was complete. In the closing days of the battle for the city, the Times of Israel reported that \\"Testimonies emerging from the city since Monday detail brutal atrocities being committed by pro-government Syrian forces.  Aftermath  On 22 February 2018, it was reported that the YPG had agreed to hand over eastern districts of Aleppo city to the Syrian government. According to Syrian state television, this decision was made to reinforce positions around the region of Afrin, and to halt Turkey's offensive. This came days after pro-Syrian government fighters agreed to bolster the Kurdish forces in the northwest. SOHR and a witness later said that Syrian government forces had entered the areas controlled by the Kurdish fighters. YPG spokesman Nouri Mahmoud however denied this claim. A YPG commander later stated that Kurdish fighters had shifted to Afrin to help repel a Turkish assault. As a result, he said the pro-Syrian government forces had regained control of the districts previously controlled by them. Throughout the start of 2020, the SAA made advances in the Idlib and Aleppo countryside. On the 17th of February, they had regained control of the last rebel-held suburbs in Aleppo city, gaining full control for the first time since 2012.  Strategic analysis  The situation after the Battle of Aleppo Rebel forces expanded into the countryside south of Aleppo to control sections of the M4 and M5 highways, effectively blocking ground reinforcements for the Syrian Army. Before the end of 2012, the Syrian Army in Aleppo was receiving sporadic supplies and ammunition replenishment by air or via backroads. The fall of Base 46, a large complex that reinforced and supplied government troops, was seen by experts as \\"a tactical turning point that may lead to a strategic shift\\" in the battle for Aleppo. In a November 2012, intelligence report, American publisher Strategic Forecasting, Inc. described the strategic position of government forces in Aleppo as \\"dire\\", and said the Free Syrian Army had them \\"essentially surrounded\\". On 26 November 2012, rebels captured Tishrin Dam, further isolating government forces in Aleppo and leaving only one route into Aleppo. By late January 2013 Deputy Prime Minister Qadri Jamil said all supply routes to Aleppo had been cut off by opposition forces, comparing the situation to the Siege of Leningrad. By late February 2013, Aleppo International Airport was almost surrounded by rebel forces. Later, the Syrian Army regained control of the strategic town Tel Sheigeb, allowing them to approach the airport. In November 2013, the Syrian Army retook the town of al-Safira. This opened a road for the government to support the besieged Kuweires Military Airbase and Aleppo Power Plant. In February 2014, it was reported that the army planned to encircle Aleppo and impose blockades and truces. It would also try to recapture Sheikh Najjar Industrial City to rebuild the economy and provide jobs. By October 2014, the army had seized Sheikh Najjar, reinforced Aleppo Central Prison and captured Handaraat, almost besieging rebel-held Aleppo. Tensions peaked in early April 2014, when a Syrian Republican Guard officer allegedly killed a Hezbollah commander during an argument over the opposition advance in al-Rashadin, and other pro-government militia groups sent as reinforcements, such as the National Defence Force, proved to be unreliable in combat. Effectively cutting off access was more difficult in Aleppo because rebels controlled more terrain there than in other cities. Rebels also have a strong presence in the countryside and around the border crossings with Turkey. In April 2014 government commanders inside the city were saying that contrary to implementing such a strategy, \\"the best [they] can do in Aleppo is just secure ... positions\\". The attempted encirclement involved the SAA's attacks on Bustan Al-Pasha, Khalidiyyeh, the farms of Mazra'a Halabi, Al- Amariyya and Bustan Al-Qaseer. The rebels' strategic victory at the Siege of Wadi Deif resulted in threats to several main government supply lines. This cast doubt on government forces' ambitions to control the road from Hama to Aleppo and the Damascus-Aleppo international road, and has been seen as a personal defeat for Syrian Arab Army Col. Suheil Al Hassan. Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations and Arab League Envoy to Syria, proposed a pause in fighting, but opinions about implementation were divided. The European Union warned that \\"cases of forced surrender imposed by the Assad regime through starvation sieges were labelled fallaciously as local cease-fires in the past.\\" The Southern Front of the Free Syrian Army, which was gaining ground in Deraa province south of Damascus, warned that a freeze in fighting in Aleppo could hamper their advance, as pro-Assad forces could be redirected from Aleppo. The Syrian government's defeat at the Second Battle of Idlib in late March 2015, which helped expand the influence of the al-Nusra Front, forced the Islamic State (IS) to expand its attacks in central Syria after it failed to block the Raqqa highway that branches out to the Syrian army's main supply route to Aleppo along the Khanasir-Athriya road. IS's aim would potentially be to establish the necessary conditions to attack Idlib and al- Nusra. The March‚ÄìApril IS offensive in central Syria led some volunteers defending the Homs-Aleppo highway to consider deserting to defend their hometowns. According to Jane's Information Group, a possible offensive on Homs by both al-Nusra Front and IS working independently might force the government to move critical forces away from Aleppo to defend key supply routes. There were additional opposition gains during the 2015 Jisr al-Shughur offensive. Syrian government minister Faisal Mekdad stated in June 2015, \\"All our strategic planning now is to keep the way open to Aleppo to allow our forces to defend it\\". Media outlets have noted that powerful online campaigns are being conducted in a war of information regarding Aleppo. = The role of Turkey = Turkey had sponsored rebel forces in Aleppo to a degree that eastern Aleppo was called \\"a Turkish card guarded by jihadis.\\" However, Turkish policy changed in August 2016, moving thousands of rebel fighters away from the area west of Aleppo to counter the secular federalist Syrian Democratic Forces to the north (see Turkish military intervention in Syria). This reduced the forces available to try to lift the siege of Aleppo, ensuring its fall.  Casualties  Aleppo, Karm al Jabal neighborhood, 2013 With over four years of fighting, the battle of Aleppo represents one of the longest sieges in modern warfare, which left an estimated 31,183 people dead, almost a tenth of the overall Syrian war casualties. The Violations Documentation Center in Syria assessed the death toll. According to its records, between 19 July 2012 and 15 December 2016 there were 22,633 adult male deaths (73%), 2,849 adult female deaths (9.2%), 3,773 child male deaths (12.2%) and 1,775 child female deaths (5.7%). 23,604 or 76% of all fatalities were civilians, while only 7,406 or 24% were military deaths. Causes of death were explosions (910 deaths), shelling (6,384 deaths), field execution (1,549 deaths), shooting (9,438 deaths), warplane bombardment (11,233 deaths), chemical and toxic gas attacks (46 deaths) and others. The pro-opposition monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) gave a similar number: it registered that 1,612 days of fighting for Aleppo left 21,452 civilians dead. Among them were 5,261 children under the age of 18 and 2,777 women over the age of 18. The Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR), a pro-opposition non- governmental organization, reported that the Russian bombardments killed at least 1,640 civilians in the Aleppo area: 1,178 civilians died between 30 September 2015 and 1 August 2016, while additional 462 civilians were killed from 19 September 2016 until 30 November 2016. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has described the fighting as one of the most devastating conflicts in modern times. It appealed: \\"The human cost of the fighting in Aleppo is simply too high. We urge all parties to stop the destruction and indiscriminate attacks, and stop the killing\\". The ICRC also said that hundreds of civilians perished through the \\"indiscriminate shelling of residential areas across Aleppo\\". Several infectious diseases broke out in Aleppo and other areas in Syria during the civil war, including poliomyelitis, measles and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Food prices also grew astronomically during the war. A kilogram (two pounds) of sugar cost $21 at one point.  Allegations of war crimes  = Syrian government and allies = Aleppo suffered catastrophic damage during the four-year siege and battle. According to an Amnesty International report, government forces have been responsible for the majority of violations in the conflict in Syria. Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesperson for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, issued a statement in November 2016 which said that \\"strikes against hospitals, schools, marketplaces, water facilities and bakeries are now commonplace, and may amount to war crimes\\". During that phase of the offensive, about 250,000 civilians were left in the city. In November 2016, UNICEF estimated that nearly 100,000 children were living under siege in Aleppo. The 2016 offensive cut off the city from food supplies, and last time eastern Aleppo was reached with significant humanitarian supplies before the Syrian re-capture was the beginning of July in 2016. The Syrian government, aided by Russian army, used war planes to systematically bombard hospitals in the rebel-held areas of the city. By the end of November 2016, no functional hospitals were left, and over 20,000 people were displaced by the fighting. Human Rights Watch issued a statement reporting that the Syrian and Russian military campaign killed more than 440 civilians, including more than 90 children, between September and October 2016. It also deplored that airstrikes often appeared to be \\"recklessly indiscriminate\\". Between 29 January and 14 March 2013, opposition activists reported about 230 bodies were found on the banks and in the Queiq River in Aleppo. They accused government forces of being the ones who executed the men since the bodies came down the river from the direction of government-held areas of the city. Human Rights Watch was able to identify at least 147 victims, all male and aged between 11 and 64. Human Rights Watch reported that family members of many of the victims testified that they were last seen in a government-controlled area or after they set out to cross into the area through two checkpoints, one manned by opposition forces and the other by government forces. In May 2014, the UN Security Council voted for the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate war crimes in the Syrian Civil War, but the resolution was vetoed by Russia and China. In 2014, the United Nations adopted Resolution 2139 which ordered the end of using barrel bombs in the battle. The Syrian Observatory of Human Rights stated that the Syrian army dropped 7,000 barrel bombs in the first five months of 2015, claiming the lives of 3,000 people. Amnesty International reported that barrel bombs killed 3,000 people in 2014. Channel4 reported that videos have emerged online showing the Syrian army using barrel bombs. The Syrian government was accused of using the barrel bombs many times. Some of them were: * Middle East Monitor reported 14 deaths allegedly caused by the bombs in the Kallasa and Qasila neighbourhood of the city in June 2015. * CNN-IBN wrote about the government dropping barrel bombs in July in the neighbourhood of al-Bab causing the death of 35 and injuring 50 others. * BBC News alleged the government dropped the bombs in May, leading to the death of 72 civilians. * The Anadolu Agency of Turkey wrote that the bombs launched by the government forces in July killed 15 people. * According to the Violations Documentation Center, barrel bomb attacks peaked between April and July 2014, with an average of 107 attacks per month, and decreased to an average of around 17 per month from September 2014 to March 2015. The government denied using barrel bombs. In an interview to BBC, President Bashar al-Assad denied using \\"indiscriminate weapons\\" like barrel bombs in the rebel held territories. Assad said, \\"I know about the army. They use bullets, missiles and bombs. I haven't heard of the army using barrels, or maybe cooking pots.\\" Amnesty International issued a detailed report about Aleppo in 2015. It warned about the Syrian government use of imprecise explosive weapons on densely populated civilian areas, illustrating it with the example that eight barrel bomb attacks between January 2014 to March 2015 killed at least 188 civilians‚Äîwhile only one rebel was recorded among the fatalities. It concluded that the government forces in Aleppo deliberately targeted civilians and civilian objects, implemented \\"forced disappearances\\", used torture and other ill-treatment among the prisoners‚Äîand that this constitutes a crime against humanity. Chemical attacks by the Syrian government on opposition-held areas in Aleppo were reported on 10 August and 6 September 2016. After these attacks, the victims reported they were suffering from a shortage of breath, coughing, reddened skin and eyes, and excessive tearing, and sought medical treatment in hospitals. Five people, including three children, died as a result. A UN report found that the Syrian government used the prohibited chlorine bombs in Aleppo, causing \\"hundreds of civilian casualties\\". Human Rights Watch also condemned the Russian army for using incendiary weapons in Aleppo, in violation of international law. Cluster bombs were also used both by the Russian aviation and the Syrian government. Russia was directly accused of war crimes several times for its part in the battle at the UN Security Council by the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, the United States and France, due to its use of bunker buster and incendiary bombs on urban residential areas. On 19 September 2016, a UN/Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) aid convoy was attacked at night, as well as a SARC warehouse and health clinic in Urum al-Kubra, a rebel-held town 12 km west of Aleppo. 20 civilians and one SARC staff member were killed, while food and medical aid, intended to reach Aleppo, was destroyed. Some witnesses on the ground at the time of the attack said they had heard helicopters during the attack. The United States accused Russian or Syrian government warplanes of perpetrating the attack, while Russia rejected the accusation. The UN said it was not in a position to determine how the attacked unfolded. The UN Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNOSAT) said it believed the convoy was attack by airstrikes.Syria aid convoy attack: What we know, BBC United Nations investigators later concluded that the Syrian government was responsible for the attack in a \\"meticulously planned and ruthlessly carried out\\" air strike.UN: Both sides committed war crimes in Syria's Aleppo, Al Jazeera The investigators stated in a report that the Syrian Air Force used barrel bombs and rockets to attack the convoy and that, after the initial attack, Syrian government jets strafed the survivors. According to the investigators, since these actions were carried out deliberately they constituted a war crime. Following the re-capture of parts of Aleppo by the Syrian government, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that pro-government Iraqi Shi'ite paramilitary group\\"Aleppo battle: UN says civilians shot on the spot\\". BBC News. 13 December 2016. killed at least 82 civilians, including 11 women and 13 children, in the Bustan al-Qasr, al-Ferdous, al-Kallaseh, and al-Saleheen neighbourhoods on 12 and 13 December 2016. In January 2017, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) and the Violations Documentation Center (VDC) submitted evidence of alleged war crimes committed by militias backed by Russia and Iran to the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Syria. According to the head of the SNHR, \\"sometimes the Russians exceed the regime in some kinds of violations\\" and he noted the similarities between the kinds of war crimes and violations committed by Russian forces and those of the Assad regime. In February 2017, Breaking Aleppo, a report by the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, utilized open source and digital forensic research to reveal both the Syrian government's atrocities and those of its supporters in the final months of the siege of Aleppo. In March 2017, the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic documented violations including chemical attacks and civilian executions perpetrated between 21 July and 22 December 2016. File:Wounded civilians arrive at hospital Aleppo.jpgWounded civilians arrive at the Aleppo hospital in October 2012 file:Aleppo hospital.PNGDoctors and medical staff treating injured rebel fighters and civilians in Aleppo = Rebels = A UN envoy warned that rebels may have been committing war crimes due to their indiscriminate rocket warfare targeting civilians in Aleppo, while trying to lift the siege in October and November 2016. The Aleppo rebels used improvised artillery, including \\"hell cannons\\", makeshift mortar firing gas cylinders packed with explosives and shrapnel. UN High Commissioner For Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein stated that their use was \\"totally unacceptable\\" and constituted indiscriminate attacks as they were very difficult to aim correctly, frequently killing and maiming civilians in government-held areas. According to Zeid, their inaccuracy means they had no military purpose so he concluded their use was primarily to \\"terrorize the inhabitants of western Aleppo\\".\\"Aleppo demands ‚Äòbold action,‚Äô including limiting use of Security Council veto ‚Äì UN rights chief\\", UN News Centre, 10 April 2016. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported in December 2014 that between July and December 2014 the rebels killed 204 civilians using hell cannons.\\"Syrian rebel 'hell cannons' kill 300 civilians: monitoring group\\", Reuters, 12 December 2014. Professor of Law Mark A. Summers of Barry University School of Law, a legal expert previous assigned to the Office of the Prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, wrote that both the uses of barrel bombs and hell cannons is inaccurate and so randomly destructive that their use is illegal, and thus constitutes either the direct or indiscriminate targeting of civilians and civilian objects.Mark A. Summers, \\"Barrel bombs and hell canons fuel conflict in Aleppo\\". Jurist, 20 May 2015. There have been reports that rebels have on multiple occasions indiscriminately shelled the predominantly Kurdish Sheikh Maqsood neighborhood.Amnesty says Syrian rebels maybe guilty of war crimes in Aleppo, Reuters, 13 May 2016 In mid-June 2016 Russia accused the rebels of causing the death of over 40 civilians in the month. A spokesman for the US-supported SDF also accused the rebels of causing 1,000 civilian deaths and injuries, through shelling of Sheikh Maqsood. There were allegations that the Army of Islam group may have used chemical weapons in Sheikh Maqsood on 7 and 8 April 2016, based on reports of eight treated patients. In May 2016, Amnesty International's regional director suggested that the attacks on Sheikh Maqsood constitute war crimes. Rebel groups such as the al-Nusra Front, the Levant Front and the Ahrar al-Sham established Sharia law in areas they controlled, imposing torture or other ill-treatment as punishment. The al-Nusra Front maintained a prison at the \\"fetid, trash-strewn basement\\" of the Aleppo Eye Hospital where the group was headquartered. At this prison, some people were held for years and subjected to repeated torture. Human rights activists, lawyers and journalists have been subjected to kidnappings. In 2015, Amnesty International warned that \\"non-state armed groups have engaged in abductions and hostage-taking, as well as the arbitrary detention, torture, and other mistreatment of prisoners in Aleppo\\". According to a 2016 Amnesty International report, some of the rebel groups in the city engaged in summary executions, in some cases in public, on the basis of \\"quasi-judicial institutions\\". The victims were captured soldiers, government officials, rival group members, as well as civilians. Russian General Staff Lieutenant General Viktor Poznikhir claimed that the Syrian government discovered several prisons in East Aleppo on 15 December 2016 used by the opposition to detain, torture and in some cases murder their opponents, including civilians that refused to fight. At the conclusion of the battle, Syrian state media claimed the Army had found the bodies of 21 executed civilians in rebel prisons, citing the head of Aleppo's forensic unit. The Russian defence ministry also claimed the execution of dozens of people by the rebels, some showing signs of torture. The pro-opposition activist group the SOHR confirmed bodies had been found in the streets but could not verify how they were killed. Denial of water and sanitation is considered a war crime.OHCHR Deprival of food, water, shelter and medical care ‚Äì a method of war in Syria, and a crime against humanity, 6 February 2014 Water supplies in the city for tens of thousands of people were deliberately cut by the Jabhat al-Nusra group for several days in May 2014. Jaish al-Islam also reportedly prohibited civilians from receiving food and supplies in one neighbourhood they controlled in December 2016. The rebel groups also horded food during the siege, allowing civilians to starve while they remained well-fed.

The Al-Madina Souq, a major souq (market) in Aleppo, was affected by a fire in September 2012. The Irish Times reported that around 700 to 1000 shops were destroyed by the fire, which had been caused by firing and shelling. The following month, there were reports of the Great Mosque of Aleppo being damaged by rocket-propelled grenades. Fighting with mortars and machine guns caused damage to the main gate and the prayer hall. The attack continued in the mosque till it was repelled by the army. The Citadel of Aleppo was damaged during Syrian army shelling. On 2 October, Irena Bokova, the Director-General of UNESCO, expressed her \\"grave concern about possible damage to precious sites\\" and requested the combatants to \\"ensure the protection of the outstanding cultural legacy that Syria hosts on its soil\\". She cited the Hague Convention for protecting the heritage sites. A 2014 report by UNITAR found, using satellite images, that 22 out of the 210 examined key structures had been completely destroyed. 48 others had sustained severe damage, 33 moderate damage and 32 possible damage. The destroyed sites included the Carlton Citadel Hotel, destroyed to its foundations in a bombing in 2014, the madrasas of al-Sharafiyya and Khusruwiyah. Damage to the Great Mosque of Aleppo, whose minaret had been destroyed, was confirmed. According to official estimates, 1500 out of the 1600 shops in the souqs had been damaged or destroyed. The Washington Post wrote that the scale of devastation of Aleppo \\"evoked comparisons with cities like Grozny and Dresden\\". It noted, however, that the destruction was mostly concentrated in the rebel-held part of the city: about 70 to 80 percent of the destruction was in the east. UN satellite images determined more than 33,500 damaged residential buildings in the city, most of them multi-apartment blocks. The costs of reconstruction were estimated at between $35‚Äì40 billion. Al-Hakam Shaar and Robert Templer proposed that the deliberate destruction of Aleppo was a form of \\"urbicide\\". File:Citadel of Aleppo.jpgThe Citadel of Aleppo was damaged during the war. File:Syria- two years of tragedy (8556474985).jpgA destroyed factory in Aleppo, Karm al Jabl area, 4 March 2013  Reactions  = Media coverage = The coverage of the siege of Aleppo in the Western media emphasised the suffering of civilians and often contained graphic pictures of injured and dying children. As there were almost no international journalists there, the reporting was outsourced to local activists linked to the rebels who held the city. This was significantly different from the news coverage of the sieges of Raqqa and Mosul carried out by the Coalition forces, where the civilian losses were downplayed.London Review of Books, The War in Five Sieges, Vol. 40 No. 14 ¬∑ 19 July 2018 pages 9-10 = Domestic reaction = The Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad, said on the occasion of the 67th Anniversary of the Syrian Arab Army in August 2012, \\"the army is engaged in a crucial and heroic battle ... on which the destiny of the nation and its people rests ...\\" After gaining nearly complete control of eastern Aleppo, Assad referred to this success as an \\"important point in history of Syria\\". He also called upon remaining rebel factions to surrender in exchange for amnesty.  Aleppo victory celebrations  Several days after the Syrian government's victory, Christmas was celebrated in Aleppo in public for the first time in years. A series of victory celebrations were held in Aleppo following the government forces' victory, attended by government supporters, including Aleppo's Christian community which has increasingly sided with the government. Large-scale outdoor Christmas celebrations were held publicly for the first time in years, with a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in the Al-Aziziyah neighborhood. Participants waved Syrian and Russian flags and held portraits of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. A Mass was held in Saint Elias Cathedral by Aleppo's Christian community for the first time in four years. According to Syrian TV, the Christmas celebration, however, was disrupted with a bomb that exploded at the event. The celebration, however, resumed several minutes after the bomb was detonated. A May 2017 New York Times Magazine report from \\"Aleppo after the Fall\\" described the public experience in formerly rebel controlled East Aleppo as \\"a chaotic wasteland full of feuding militias‚Äîsome of them radical Islamists‚Äîwho hoarded food and weapons while the people starved\\" and quoted local sources as \\"no one is 100 percent with the regime, but mostly these people are unified by their resistance to the opposition\\" and people having experienced \\"a rebellion that is corrupt, brutal and compromised by foreign sponsors\\". = Foreign reactions = * In October and December 2016, the UN held a \\"Security Council Emergency Briefing on Syria\\" to discuss the situation in Aleppo. However, no agreement was reached. The United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power criticized the Syrian government, Russia and Iran, in a speech at the briefing, stating \\"to the Assad regime, Russia, and Iran‚Äîthree Member States behind the conquest of and carnage in Aleppo‚Äîyou bear responsibility for these atrocities.\\" Comparing the situation in Aleppo to the mass killings in Halabja, Rwanda and Srebrenica, she addressed the Syrian, Russian and Iranian governments, asking them \\"are you truly incapable of shame?\\" UN humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien appealed to the Security Council to stop the bombardment of eastern Aleppo, describing residents \\"scrabbling with their bare hands in the street above to reach under concrete rubble trying to reach their young child screaming unseen in the dust and dirt below their feet\\". The Russian ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, dismissed his speech, saying: \\"If I wanted to be preached at, I'd go to church\\". * At an EU summit in December 2016, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Russia and Iran were responsible \\"for crimes committed against the Syrian population\\" by the Assad government and that these should not go unpunished. The US secretary of State John Kerry also said that \\"there is absolutely no justification whatsoever for the indiscriminate and savage brutality against civilians shown by the regime and by its Russian and Iranian allies over the past few weeks, or indeed over the past five years.\\" * Armenia began sending humanitarian aid to Aleppo in mid- October 2012. The aid was distributed by Red Crescent, the Armenian National Prelacy in Aleppo, the Aleppo Emergency unit, the Embassy of the Republic of Armenia to Syria, and the Consulate General of Armenia in Aleppo. The Governor of the Aleppo Governorate, Mohammad Wahid Aqqad, said, \\"the Syrian people highly appreciate this humanitarian gesture of the Armenian people, underlining the strong Syrian-Armenian cooperation\\". * The French Foreign Ministry said, \\"With the build-up of heavy weapons around Aleppo, Assad is preparing to carry out a fresh slaughter of his own people\\". Italy and the UN peacekeeping chief also accused the Syrian government of preparing to massacre civilians. * As the Battle of Aleppo started, Saeed Jalili, the head of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, met with Assad in Damascus. Jalili said Iran would help Assad to confront \\"attempts at blatant foreign interference\\" in Syria's internal affairs, saying, \\"Iran will not allow the axis of resistance, of which it considers Syria to be an essential part, to be broken in any way\\". During the Tehran sermon on 16 December 2016, Ayatollah Mohammad Emami Kashani praised the \\"Aleppo triumph\\" as a \\"defeat of the infidels\\". In contrast, Iranian reformist and former director of Western Asian affairs in the Iranian Foreign Ministry, Mir-Hossein Mousavi, said that he cannot applaud at what happened in Aleppo, concluding it is \\"nothing but a two nights' joy and Tehran will be worrying for the next 30 years about it.\\" * The Russian Foreign Ministry issued an official statement condemning the bombing that occurred on 9 September 2012, in which more than 30 people were killed. The ministry stated, \\"We firmly condemn the terrorist acts which claim the lives of innocent people\\", on 11 September. The Foreign Ministry also called on foreign powers to pressure the armed opposition to stop launching \\"terrorist attacks\\". The Russian Consulate General in Aleppo suspended operations on 16 January 2013. * Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan urged international action, saying it was not possible \\"to remain a spectator\\" to the government offensive on Aleppo. Reuters reported that Turkey had set up a base with allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar to direct military and communications aid to the Free Syrian Army from the city of Adana. Reuters also quoted a Doha-based source, which stated that Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia were providing rebel fighters with weapons and training. * William Hague, the British Foreign Minister, said, \\"the world must speak out to avert a massacre in Aleppo\\". * The United States stated it feared \\"a new massacre\\" in Aleppo by the Syrian government; \\"This is the concern: that we will see a massacre in Aleppo and that's what the regime appears to be lining up for\\". The United States condemned \\"in the strongest possible terms\\" the government SCUD missile strikes on Aleppo in late February 2013, saying they were \\"the latest of the Syrian regime's ruthlessness and its lack of compassion for the Syrian people it claims to represent\\". Jan Egeland, Special Advisor to the UN Special Envoy for Syria, stated in November 2016: \\"I have not seen a place where there has been so much politicization, manipulation of aid, as we have seen in Syria in recent months. It has to stop!\\". He also called the bombardment and destruction of the city a \\"dark chapter\\" in modern history: In his last press conference as the United Nations Secretary-General on 16 December 2016, Ban Ki-moon declared: \\"Aleppo is now a synonym for hell\\". The UN High Commissioner for Refugees delivered a statement on 17 December 2016, calling for an immediate end to the war in Syria: \\"With the situation in Aleppo, Syria's war has reached an historic low... Aleppo has become a metaphor for the disastrous situation that Syria is in today, with half the population having been forced from their homes.\\" The Washington Post compared the destruction of Aleppo to the siege of Sarajevo in the 1990s. On 20 December 2016, the United Nations Security Council approved \\"adequate, neutral UN monitoring and direct observation on evacuations from the eastern districts\\" in Aleppo.

In Paris, the Eiffel Tower went dark on 14 December, as a symbol of solidarity, and thousands protested in Paris' Stravinsky Square against Russia's role in the destruction of the city. Qatar cancelled its national day of celebration on 18 December 2016, in solidarity with Aleppo. German government spokesperson Steffen Seibert said that \\"the cries for help of the people caught up in the fighting for the beleaguered city of Aleppo are a harrowing reminder to the world\\". He also urged: \\"There must be an end to the killing and dying in Aleppo.\\" Protests were also held in London, Sarajevo, Istanbul, Jerusalem, Gaza City, and Amman, with some protesters burning pictures of Vladimir Putin because of Russia's role in the siege.Aleppo Syria: Global shows of solidarity over Aleppo BBC News. 15 December 2016.Standing with Aleppo 14 December 2016.

Al-Qahtani stated that petitions calling for the activists to receive fair trials and better conditions of detention were ignored, and that freedom of speech and freedom of assembly were not respected in Saudi Arabia. = 2009 Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association= Al-Qahtani co-founded the Saudi Arabian human rights organisation Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) in October 2009 together with Mohammed Saleh al-Bejadi and nine others. , he continued to be active in ACPRA. = 2011 Prisoner Demonstration = On 5 Feb 2011, about 40 women demonstrated in front of the Interior Ministry in central Riyadh, calling for the release of prisoners. Mohammed al-Qahtani later told Reuters, \\"The women demand to free people imprisoned in the campaign against terrorism. Many people have been held up for a long time without trial, or have nothing to do with al Qaeda.\\" According to an ACPRA website, they were carrying signs that said, \\"free our prisoners or try them in a fair public court.\\" 2012 court case = Charges and trial = Al-Qahtani was charged in a Saudi court on 18 June 2012 on 11 charges related to his human rights activism, including: If convicted, penalties for al-Qahtani could include a 5-year prison term, a travel ban and a fine. Another founding member of ACPRA, Mohammed al-Bejadi received a four-year jail sentence in April 2012. One of the charges against al-Qahtani was \\"sending 'false information presented as facts to the official international mechanisms.'\\" The human rights organisation Alkarama interpreted this to refer to al-Qahtani's founding role in ACPRA and ACPRA's work with Alkarama in preparing documents to give to the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. Mohammad al-Qahtani's trial started on 1 September 2012 with nine charges, including \\"setting up an unlicensed organisation and breaking allegiance to the king\\". The trial of Abdullah al-Hamid, another ACPRA co-founder, started on the same day. Supporters of al-Qahtani and al- Hamid were initially present in the courtroom. Text and photo reports of the trial were published live on the social networking services Twitter and Facebook, which was described by the Sebastian Usher of the BBC as \\"a measure of transparency that is unusual in Saudi Arabia\\". The judge ordered some of the audience to leave the court room. According to Al Arabiya, those ordered to leave were mobile phone users, and according to the BBC, those ordered to leave were al-Qahtani's and al-Hamid's supporters and family. On 9 March 2013, he was found guilty of several charges and sentenced to ten years in prison followed by ten years of travel ban. = International reaction = On 29 June, the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies spoke on al-Qahtani's behalf at the 20th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, stating its \\"uttermost concern over the targeting of activists for their cooperation with international human rights protection mechanisms\\" and referring specifically to the charges against al-Qahtani. Amnesty International described the charges as \\"part of a series of recent trials aimed at silencing human rights activists\\" in Saudi Arabia. Later, it described the sentence as an evidence of \\"Saudi Arabian authorities‚Äô inability to deal with any opinion that contradicts their own.\\" Human Rights Watch described the sentence as being \\"outrageous.\\" Points of view = Low-end jobs for Saudi women = In 2009, Al-Qatani opposed the opening of housemaid jobs to Saudi women, saying that low-end jobs should be performed by migrant workers. The statement was made in response to a report that 30 Saudi women recruited through an employment agency had taken on jobs as domestic workers. Al-Qahtani criticized the ministry of labor for forcing Saudis into low-end jobs, saying they should instead start from the top, since high-end jobs were readily available, and there were plenty of expatriates to fill the menial jobs. = Women to Drive movement = On 17 June 2011, Al-Qatani tweeted, \\"My wife, Maha, and I have just come from a 45-minute drive, she was the driver through Riyadh streets,\\" a reference to the Women2Drive movement, a campaign for Saudi women's right to drive that called for Saudi women to start driving starting 17 June 2011. =Human rights= Al-Qahtani believes that all people, including those suspected of terrorist activities, have the right to a fair trial. =Arab Spring= In April 2011, al-Qahtani stated in relation to the Saudi-led Peninsula Shield Force intervention in the Bahraini uprising: In early 2011, al-Qahtani believed that \\"the only serious way to seek change is by slow and concentrated steps\\". He suggested that the families of political prisoners would be more motivated to carry out street protests, especially if women participated, compared to \\"liberals\\". During the Arab Spring events of early 2011, al-Qahtani received telephone calls from political prisoners' families, prior to a 5 February 2011 protest in front of the Ministry of Interior in Riyadh by 50 women. Al-Qahtani stated that \\"the small group spent the night in jail, but they got serious news coverage in the process.\\" In June 2012, after being charged in court for his human rights activities, al-Qahtani stated:  See also  * Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) References  External links  A scanned copy of the official charges in the Trial of al-Hamid and al-Qahtani. 1960s births Year of birth missing (living people) Living people Human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabian human rights activists Saudi Arabian academics Indiana University alumni Amnesty International prisoners of conscience held by Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabian prisoners and detainees People of the 2011‚Äì2012 Saudi Arabian protests Right Livelihood Award laureates ","title":"Mohammad Fahad al-Qahtani"},{"id":"36494909","text":"The molecular formula C21H25NO (molar mass: 307.429 g/mol) may refer to: * Benzatropine * Hepzidine * 2Œ≤-Propanoyl-3Œ≤-(2-naphthyl)-tropane Molecular formulas ","title":"C21H25NO"},{"id":"36494916","title":"Equestrian at the 1928 Summer Olympics ‚Äì Team eventing"},{"id":"36494921","text":"1997 in rugby league centered on the Super League II and Australasia's split season (between the competing Australian Rugby League and Super League organisations). * March 1 at Townsville, Queensland - Adelaide Rams play their first match, a 16-24 loss to the North Queensland Cowboys at Dairy Farmers Stadium before 17,738. * March 2 at Newcastle, Australia - Hunter Mariners play their first match: a 16-20 loss to the Canterbury Bulldogs at Topper Stadium before 6,579.

Version 1.0 of the standard was approved by the Kantara Initiative on March 23, 2015.https://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/LC/User+Managed+Access As described by the charter of the group that developed UMA,http://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/uma/Charter the purpose of the protocol specifications is to ‚Äúenable a resource owner to control the authorization of data sharing and other protected-resource access made between online services on the owner‚Äôs behalf or with the owner‚Äôs authorization by an autonomous requesting party‚Äù. This purpose has privacy and consent implications for web applications and the Internet of Things (IoT), as explored by the collection of case studies contributed by participants in the standards group.http://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/uma/Case+Studies  History and background  The Kantara Initiative's UMA Work Grouphttp://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/uma/Home UMA Work Group Wiki held its first meetinghttp://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/uma/Meetings+and+Minutes?src=contextnavchildmode UMA workgroup meeting minutes on August 6, 2009. UMA's design principles and technical design have been informed by previous work by Sun Microsystems employees, begun in March 2008, on a protocol called ProtectServe. In turn, ProtectServe was influenced by the goals of the Vendor Relationship Management movement and an offshoot effort called feeds-based VRM. ProtectServe and UMA's earliest versions leveraged the OAuth 1.0 protocol. As OAuth underwent significant change through the publication of the Web Resource Authorization Protocol (WRAP) specification and, subsequently, drafts of OAuth 2.0, the UMA specification has kept pace, and it now uses the OAuth 2.0 family of specifications for several key protocol flows. UMA does not use or depend on OpenID 2.0 as a means of user identification. However, it optionally uses the OAuth-based OpenID Connect protocol as a means of collecting identity claims from a requesting party in order to attempt to satisfy the authorizing user's access policy. UMA also does not use or depend on the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) as a means of encoding user policy or requesting policy decisions. UMA does not dictate policy format, as policy evaluation is performed internally to the authorization server (AS) from the UMA perspective. Typically XACML would be used to implement the policies inside the AS. Its implementation is out-of-scope of UMA. The UMA protocol flows for requesting access permission have some features in common with the XACML protocol.  Standardization status  The UMA group conducts its work in the Kantara Initiativehttp://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/uma/Home and has also contributed a series of Internet-Draft specifications to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as an eventual home for UMA standardization work. To this end, the WG has contributed several individual Internet-Drafts to the IETF for consideration. One of these, a specification for OAuth dynamic client registration,http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-dyn-reg Internet Draft: OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Core Protocol served as input for the more generalized mechanism ultimately developed for OAuth.https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591  Implementation and adoption status  The UMA core protocol has several implementations,http://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/uma/UMA+Implementations including several open source implementations.

The diagram (see right) highlights key additions that UMA makes to OAuth 2.0. In a typical OAuth flow, a human resource owner (RO) operating a client application is redirected to an authorization server (AS) to log in and consent to the issuance of an access token so that the client application can gain access to the resource server (RS) on the RO‚Äôs behalf in future, likely in a scoped (limited) fashion. The RS and AS are in all likelihood operating within the same security domain, and any communication between them is not standardized by the main OAuth specification. UMA adds three main concepts and corresponding structures and flows. First, it defines a standardized API at the AS, called the protection API, that the RS speaks to; this enables multiple RS‚Äôs to communicate with one AS and vice versa, and because the API is itself secured with OAuth, allows for formal trust establishment between each pair. This also allows an AS to present an RO with a centralized user interface. Second, UMA defines a formal notion of a requesting party (RqP) that is autonomous from an RO, enabling party-to-party sharing and delegation of access authorization. An RO need not consent to token issuance at run time but can set policy at an AS, allowing an RqP to attempt access asynchronously. Third, UMA enables access attempts to result in successful issuance of tokens associated with authorization data based on a process of trust elevation in the RqP, for example, gathering identity claims or other claims from them.  Applicable use cases  UMA's architecture can serve a variety of consumer-facing and enterprise-facing use cases. The UMA group collects case studies on its wiki. One example set of use cases is in healthcare IT and consumer health. In the OpenID Foundation organization, a working group called Health Relationship Trust (HEART)http://openid.net/wg/heart/ is working to \\"harmonize and develop a set of privacy and security specifications that enable an individual to control the authorization of access to RESTful health-related data sharing APIs\\", building upon, among other standards, UMA. Another example set of use cases, which originally influenced UMA's development, is in the area of \\"personal data stores\\" in the fashion of vendor relationship management. In this conception, an individual can choose an operator of an authorization service that accepts connections from a variety of consumer-facing digital resource hosts in order to offer a dashboard with resource sharing management capabilities.

The Anti-Duvalier protest movement was a series of demonstrations in Haiti from 23 May 1984 ‚Äì 7 February 1986, that led to the overthrow of President Jean-Claude ‚ÄúBaby Doc‚Äù Duvalier and the Duvalier dynasty regime. History Fran√ßois ‚ÄúPapa Doc‚Äù Duvalier was elected to presidency in the 1957 general election, and he declared himself ‚ÄúPresident for life‚Äù following the 1964 constitutional referendum. In the aftermath of the 1958 coup d'√©tat attempt, to keep the populace subservient, Papa Doc created a paramilitary force called the Tonton Macoutes (), notorious of its use of violence and intimidation. In 1970, the force was renamed the Militia of National Security Volunteers (). When Duvalier died in 1971, his son, Jean- Claude ‚ÄúBaby Doc‚Äù Duvalier took over (confirmed by the 1971 constitutional referendum) and the force continued throughout his regime and maintained the same violent presence. Widespread problems of starvation and unemployment soon grew rampant. On 23 May 1984, citizens in the city of Gona√Øves began protests against Duvalier‚Äôs government calling it \\"Operation D√©choukaj,\\" () which consequently led to police officers publicly beating a pregnant woman, who soon died. Activists‚Äô listed grievances under Duvalier‚Äôs regime, including general brutality against civilians and rising food costs, while some went to an aid warehouse to demand food. Law enforcement from the capital of Port-au- Prince came and quickly stopped the protests violently. The government imposed a curfew on the city. However, the protests soon spread to other cities. The protests came after the regime had loosened some of its restrictive laws. Duvalier said that state violence in prisons would no longer be allowed, and loosened press censorship. The United States, a big source of monetary aid for Haiti, said that Duvalier should be less brutal than his father had been, and granted a large annual aid package under the condition that Haiti improve its human rights situation. Haiti was dependent on foreign aid, primarily from the United States, for 70% of its budget. Leadership in the criticism of Duvalier included Sylvio Claude, head of one opposition party, and Gregoire Eugene, the head of the other opposition party, as well as some other opposition politicians. Bishops in the predominantly Catholic nation also denounced the regime. 2,000 people signed a petition saying that the regime was enslaving the masses. The protests continued in towns and villages nationwide through November 1984. Referendum and opposition The 1985 constitutional referendum increased Duvalier‚Äôs power, angering much of the populace. In November 1985, opposition held protests in cities around the country, which led to many protesters to be arrested and killed by law enforcement. In November 1985, protesters held a demonstration with popular slogans and signs. The troops shot at the protesters, killing at least three students. The protests continued through December in two main towns, but did not reach the capital. Students started to boycott classes. Church radio stations, the only independent news sources, stopped broadcasting, making it very difficult for much of the country to get any information about the strikes. It seemed that some news outlets closed voluntary, while the government closed the more outspoken ones down itself. In December 1985, increased state violence led the U.S. to threaten to cut off aid. On 7 January, when students of most age groups returned to school from break, there were a significant number of protests. The government responded by closing schools across the country. It also responded to protests by arresting people, and forcing businessmen, civil servants, and military officials to swear loyalty to Duvalier in the palace. Nevertheless, the army threatened to turn against the regime if Duvalier failed to resolve the political crisis. Duvalier declared a nationwide day of mourning for the students murdered in November, and swore to try the police officers that had killed them. He also drove around the capital throwing money from his car window, and fired some officials, but many people declared that the efforts to improve his image had not appeased them. On 13 January 1986, opposition called for a general strike and both Catholic and Protestant church officials in the predominantly Catholic nation denounced Duvalier‚Äôs rule, declaring their opposition to the injustice and oppression that the dictatorship exercised. In the capital city, protesters handed out leaflets calling for Operation D√©choukaj, to organize a general strike against the regime. Activists set up roadblocks separating Port-au-Prince from the rest of the country. Citizens continued expressing their unhappiness by painting slogans on walls, speaking more openly with international reporters, and occasional expressions of violence. The U.S. threatened to cut aid, and 4 senior officials stepped down from the government. By the end of January 1986, there had been demonstrations in over a dozen towns since the murder of the students in November. Administrators from 24 schools sent an open letter to the Education Minister demanding that the schools reopen, and 111 teachers signed a similar letter. The government did not respond, although armed soldiers often watched the political processions. Campaigners set fire to a court building and threw rocks at a Duvalier's home, although it is not known whether anyone was injured. Protesters also looted hospitals and aid deports. As the end of January, 1986 approached, protests increased in size, and became almost constant. Protesters took over and destroyed government offices in some outer towns, and blocked major roadways around the country. Rumors had circulated that said Duvalier had fled, but were found untrue. State violence increased, and Duvalier suspended certain civil liberties, declaring a state of siege. Stores closed and remained shut. Graffiti carrying certain popular slogans increased on walls around the capital in early February. Activists defaced a large statue of Duvalier in front of city hall. For several consecutive days in early February, Duvalier traveled around the capital as a symbol of his continuing control. Stores and businesses stayed closed, ignoring Duvalier‚Äôs demand that business should proceed as usual. Exile On 7 February 1986, Duvalier fled to France in a U.S. supplied plane. However, before leaving, he set up the 6-member National Council of Government (CNG), under the leadership of Army Commander Henri Namphy, to rule the country after his exile. The Duvaliers settled in France and although lived comfortably, was denied a request of political asylum by the French authorities. Jean-Claude soon lost most of his wealth in his 1993 divorce with his wife. A private citizen, Jacques Samyn, unsuccessfully sued to expel Duvalier as an illegal immigrant (the Duvaliers were never officially granted asylum in France). Then, in 1998, a Haitian-born photographer, G√©rald Bloncourt, formed a committee in Paris to bring Duvalier to trial. At the time, the French Ministry of the Interior said that it could not verify whether Duvalier still remained in the country due to the recently enacted Schengen Agreement which had abolished systematic border controls between the participating countries. However, Duvalier's lawyer Sauveur Vaisse said that his client was still in France and denied that the exiled leader had fallen on hard times. The 2004 Global Transparency Report listed Duvalier as one of the World's Most Corrupt Leaders. He was listed sixth, between Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and Alberto Fujimori, and was said to have amassed between $300 million to $800 million. Following the ousting of president Jean-Bertrand Aristide in February 2004, Duvalier announced his intention to return to Haiti to run for president in the 2006 elections for the National Unity Party. Duvalier still has had supporters in the country who founded the Fran√ßois Duvalier Foundation in 2006 to promote positive aspects of the Duvalier presidency, including the creation of most of Haiti's state institutions and improved access to education for the country's black majority. However, ultimately he did not become a presidential candidate. On 23 September 2007, an address by Duvalier to Haitians was broadcast by radio. Although he said exile had \\"broken\\" him, he also said that what he described as the improving fortunes of the National Unity Party had \\"reinvigorated\\" him, and he urged readiness among his supporters, without saying whether he intended to return to Haiti. President Ren√© Pr√©val rejected Duvalier's apology and, on September 28, he said that while Duvalier was constitutionally free to return to Haiti, he would face trial if he did so. Duvalier's radio broadcast address was given in French and not Haitian Creole, the language spoken by the majority of Haitians. In February 2010, a Swiss court agreed to release more than US$4 million to Jean-Claude Duvalier, although the Swiss Foreign Ministry said it would continue to block the release of the money. Duvalier lived in Paris with V√©ronique Roy, his longtime companion and chief public-relations representative, until his return to Haiti in late January 2011. Roy is the granddaughter of Paul Magloire, President of Haiti from 1950 to 1956.

A local TV journalist from News Live was accused of instigating the mob and was arrested on 20 July 2012. Investigations are ongoing. Incident On 9 July 2012, two women were exiting a bar and became involved in a physical struggle with a group of men standing outside. Gaurav Jyoti Neog, a journalist from News Live who was nearby, phoned his office asking for camera and crew to shoot the brawl. Although the girl tried breaking away and asking for help, she was dragged back twice into the mob and abused further.

Mamlouk is also head of the National Security Bureau of the Ba'ath Party. Early life Ali Mamluk was born in Damascus into a Circassian family on 19 February 1946. There is another report giving his birth year as 1945. His family is originally from ƒ∞skenderun (Hatay in Turkey). Career Mamlouk is said to be one of the founding officers of the Syrian Air Force Intelligence in the 1970s. He was deputy director there, when in June 2005 President Bashar Assad appointed him head of the General Security Directorate. Mamlouk is said to be on good terms with all of Syria's intelligence agencies; the heads of the Air Force Intelligence Directorate and the Political Security Directorate were once his assistants. In July 2012 following the Damascus security HQ bombing, it was reported that Mamlouk would become the head of the National Security Bureau with the rank of minister overseeing the entire security apparatus, and that former military intelligence chief Abdel-Fatah Qudsiyeh would become his assistant.New chief named in security reshuffle Oman Daily Observer, 25 July 2012 =Controversy= Mamlouk is one of many officials sanctioned by the European Union for their alleged actions against protesters participating in the Syrian revolution.Syria's Assad 'reshuffles security chiefs' UPI, 21 October 2010List of 13 Syrian officials blacklisted by the EU Youkal Retrieved 21 July 2012 (Arabic)State funeral for three Syrian officials as Assad‚Äôs inner circle shrinks The Daily Star 21 July 2012 His agency had \\"repressed internal dissent, monitored individual citizens, and had been involved in the Syrian government's Siege of Daraa, where protesters were killed by Syrian security services\\".

Swiss government also put him into sanction list in September 2011. On 23 April 2012, the US government imposed sanctions on him, saying he had been responsible for human rights abuses, including the use of violence against civilians. In May 2015, concern mounted regarding Mamlouk's whereabouts and health after not having been seen for some time, leading to comparisons with Rustum Ghazaleh who recently met a violent and unclear death. In July 2015, Mamlouk visited Jeddah in Saudi Arabia and Muscat in Oman and met with Saudi and GCC officials to discuss proposals for ending the Syrian Civil War. Criminal investigations On 11 August 2012, Lebanon indicted Ali Mamlouk in absentia and former Lebanese Information Minister Michel Samaha for their alleged plots to assassinate Lebanese political and religious figures. Lebanese judicial officials issued a warrant for Mamlouk's arrest on 4 February 2013. In November 2018, French prosecutors issued international arrest warrants for three senior Syrian intelligence and government officials: Ali Mamlouk, Abdel Salam Mahmoud and Jamil Hassan.

From the early 1970s, Kazan had a particularly bad reputation for juvenile delinquency, and a substantial portion of young males in the area of both Russian and Tatar background joined youth gangs, which fought amongst each other for territory, principally using improvised or melee weapons (at the time firearms were not widespread in Russia and were hard to come by). Between 1985 and 1999 the rate of crimes committed by sixteen- to twenty-nine-year-olds in Tatarstan (until 1992 the Tatar ASSR) increased 1.7 times. Struggles for domination of public space, where success in the appropriation of resources was often predicated on one‚Äôs aptitude and skills in violence, forced many young men unaffiliated with gangs to reconsider their options in the face of increasing insecurity. The crime wave caused a moral panic amongst the Soviet population, as not only was such criminality traditionally seen as a product of the capitalist West, but it also involved the children of local officials.NY Times ‚Äì Kazan Journal; Street Gangs Return, and Soviet City Is Chagrined During the rise of the Russian mafia in the late 1980s and 1990s, the street gangs grew into more sophisticated and organised criminal enterprises. Due to the lack of profitability in running protection rackets in Tatarstan, the Kazan gangs started to move to St Petersburg, where they got into conflict with the local Tambov gang. The Kazan mafia was known to be particularly cruel in their extortion tactics, and periodically brought in reinforcements from Tatarstan. The Slavic gangsters of the city banded together to fight this emerging threat, and eventually forced the Tatars out of St Petersburg.Volkov, Vadim; Violent Entrepreneurs; 2002 Emergence The breakdown of the key institutions of the Soviet state‚Äîthe command economy, the state and legal apparatus, and the enterprise-based social welfare system‚Äîwas accompanied by a violent division of assets and resources. State companies, now being privatized, began to operate in an unfamiliar market environment. Ordinary business functions such as raising capital, ensuring supplies, and making customers pay for goods and services could be extremely difficult to carry out and fraught with danger. Not only was the country in the grip of an economic crisis but the state legal apparatus was inefficient, and a functioning banking system was years away. In this chaotic environment, both public and private companies became besieged by predators who were keen to access their assets and who used threats, bribes, and offers of ‚Äúprotection‚Äù to lay their hands on a company‚Äôs money, products, and shares. In Tatarstan despite the economic crisis, many attractive assets remained. Although by the mid-1990s industrial output in the republic had decreased by 33.9% compared to the beginning of the decade, the economic crisis of the first half of the 1990s was less severe than in most Russian regions. The existence of a large economic base inherited from the Soviet times, together with the historical presence of gangs, helps to explain the particularly rapid development of organized crime in Tatarstan in the 1990s. These newly privatizing companies were exposed to extortion from bandit gangs, or indeed the state security services and police, which emerged as one of the key racketeering groups in post-Soviet Russia. Alongside the ailing ex-Soviet companies there emerged a vast street-level economy and nascent small businesses. The private economic sphere was initially launched during perestroika when Gorbachev‚Äôs 1987 Law on Cooperation allowed groups of citizens to establish cooperative businesses. These businesses immediately became targets for racketeers. The first case of racketeering in Kazan was registered in 1988 when the street group Dom Obuvi (literally ‚ÄúHouse of Shoes,‚Äù a shoe store) attempted to extort protection money from a builders‚Äô cooperative. Although at the beginning of the 1990s, most cooperatives disappeared under the pressures of state taxation and competition from new private companies, new small businesses soon began to emerge, mainly in the unregulated informal and semiformal service sector: outdoor markets, small stalls and kiosks, small currency exchange businesses etc. With hardly any protection from the state, and lacking the means to protect itself, the sector was easy prey for a variety of predators. All over Russia, street neighbourhood groups were at the forefront of the new processes of accumulation, although the specific dynamics of relationships between street groups and other violent actors still await investigation. In Kazan (and Tatarstan in general) the majority of organized crime groups rose out of street social organizations. The vast majority of these organizations started out as youth territorial groups of ‚Äúhooligans‚Äù. Contributions to these funds were systematically collected through extortion and other criminal means. In Kazan, most such groups, excluding specialized gangs such as drug gangs, emerged out of territorial youth groups. Currently, all such communities have youth gangs as part of their structure. The main Kazan gruppirovki‚ÄîKvartala, Mirnyi, Shatura, 56th Kvartal, Sots-gorod, Telestudiia, Khadi Taktash, Zhilka, Nizy, Boriskovo, Pervaki, Tukaevo‚Äî sought to divide the city among them. In order to retain and expand their control over territory, they needed to mobilize significant forces. They put serious pressure on local young people to join their gangs. Social composition At the end of the 1980s, Kazan gang membership was skewed toward working-class young people. In the 1990s this began to change with the massive collapse of livelihoods, these gangs began to draw their members from a wider range of social backgrounds, including young people from educated families. The gangs also began to attract university students. Further, even as street gangs remained a youth phenomenon, their membership was becoming older. Toward the middle of the 1990s, a significant proportion of members were over twenty-five, and many were in legitimate employment. The ethnic backgrounds of gang members tended to be representative of the local population, although gangs formed by communities of migrants (Georgians, Azerbaijani, Chechens, Dagestani) also appeared across Russia. The Tatarstan gangs were ethnically mixed, uniting Russians and Tatars and any other ethnicities living in their neighbourhoods.

Title and content While the title suggests the scope is limited to simple cooking instructions, Ekiho Miyazaki, an abbot of the S≈çt≈ç school's head temple Eihei-ji, summarizes the work's importance when he writes, \\"Instructions for the Cook are instructions for life\\".Warner et al., 10 The work was written in 1237, ten years after D≈çgen's return from his time in Song Dynasty China. At this time he was practicing at the monastery he had founded four years earlier, K≈çsh≈çh≈çrin-ji.Baroni, 344Warner et al., 14 During this period he wrote several of his best known works such as Bend≈çwa, Fukan Zazengi, and Genj≈çk≈çan. However, the language and style in the Instructions are regarded as more concrete and straightforward than these other popular works. Instructions for the Cook is included as the first part of the Eihei Shingi, or Rules of Purity for Eihei-ji. Renp≈ç Niwa, a former abbot of Eihei- ji, divides the texts into five parts. The first part is the preface in which D≈çgen emphasizes the importance of the work of the tenzo, or head cook. He asserts that the position is only suitable for experienced monks with a certain deep degree of understanding of zen practice. The next section describes the actual work the tenzo must carry out, as well as the attitude with which it should be undertaken. The third part includes instructions for serving, as well as an account of D≈çgen's famous encounters with two monks serving as tenzo while he was visiting China. He acknowledges that these meetings had a deep and lasting impact on his understanding of Buddhism, and they thus ultimately helped shape S≈çt≈ç Zen in Japan. Next, D≈çgen focuses on the need for the tenzo to act without any thought of discrimination or duality. In the last section, the discussion of the tenzo's attitude is concluded with a discussion of the Three Minds (Sanshin, ‰∏âÂøÉ), a set of three ideals for Zen practice.Warner et al., 41-42 Allusions to K≈çan D≈çgen's essay makes numerous allusions to other works, especially k≈çans. One such reference is to a k≈çan attributed to Dongshan Shouchu that appears in both the Gateless Gate and the Blue Cliff Record.Warner et al., 38 In it, Dongshan is asked, \\"What is Buddha\\"?, to which he replies, \\"Three pounds of hemp\\".Warner et al., 72 D≈çgen mentions the k≈çan in the opening of the essay while arguing how serious a position tenzo is, stating that Dongshan had this insight during his time serving as tenzo.Warner et al., 32 While hemp may seem unrelated to the kitchen, the Zen scholars Shohaku Okumura and Taigen Dan Leighton suggest 'hemp' (È∫ª) may be a mistranslation and that 'sesame' (ËÉ°È∫ª) was intended, which makes more sense in the context of cooking. D≈çgen mentions the k≈çan in order to suggest that the most simple activities, such as working with everyday ingredients, are no different from awakening when approached directly and with a clear mind. Another k≈çan quoted in the work involves an encounter with the abbot Dongshan Liangjie and a tenzo at his monastery named Xuefeng Yicun. In the story, which is taken from the Zen en Shingi (Pure Standards of the Zen Garden, Á¶ÖËãëÊ∏ÖË¶è),Warner et al., 35 Xuefeng is cleaning rice when Dongshan asks, \\"Are you sifting the sand and removing the rice, or sifting the rice and removing the sand\\"? Xuefeng responds that both are removed at the same time. Dongshan then says, \\"What will the great assembly eat?\\" In response to this, Xuefeng overturns the bowl. Dongshan says, \\"In the future you will go and be scrutinized by someone else\\". The final line references the fact that Xuefeng ultimately studied under Touzi Datong, Dongshan, and Deshan Xuanjian before finally receiving dharma transmission. According to K≈çry≈ç Shinno in an essay on the k≈çans of Tenzo Ky≈çkun, Xuefeng gives his answer in order to express the nondualism of his activity. However, Dongshan follows up by reminding him that while his answer demonstrates a grasp on the absolute meaning of his activity, he is forgetting the utility value (i.e. feeding the other practitioners) and thus his apparently absolute understanding is in fact limited. Xuefeng does not grasp this and turns over the rice washing bowl in frustration.Warner et al., 77-79 Translations The short text that comprises the Instructions for the Cook has been translated into English and other languages, often as a part of the Eihei Shingi, or Rules of Purity for Eiheiji.

The song was later featured in the end credits for the show Entourage, season 7, episode 3 on July 18, 2010. \\"Half Full Glass of Wine\\" came in at number 75 in the Triple J Hottest 100 in 2008. Composition \\"Half Full Glass of Wine\\" was written by Kevin Parker in the key of C Minor in a 4/4 time signature. It begins with hi-hats setting the tempo and rhythm, before an overdriven electric guitar riff comes in. The tempo is then gradually slowed down, rallentando. The main guitar riff then comes in, which is a C minor pentatonic blues riff, and the bass guitar doubles it. The first verse features a call and response effect where the vocals are backed only by a bass guitar rhythmically playing the C root note. After the vocal line, the full band come in and play the first half of the guitar riff. This happens two times, and then the next line has a variation of the main guitar riff, played higher on the fretboard after the vocal line is sung. The last vocal line of the verse is backed by loud strumming of an F5 power chord. The pre-chorus has the first part of the main riff played again, and then it goes quiet with the bass rhythmically playing the C root note and quiet drums keeping time with Parker's vocals over the top. The F5 power chord comes back again and the main riff is played twice. The chorus has an almost 12 bar blues structure, but put into a rock context, using G5, F5 and Bb5 power chords. The verse, pre-chorus, chorus format returns once again, with the pre-chorus extended with quiet guitar fills in the background. A bridge comes in with a C5, Eb5, Bb5, G5 power chord progression. After a few repeats, a simple guitar solo in the C minor pentatonic scale is played over the top, then the band stops and an extended drum solo is played in the outro before trailing off. Music video Frames from the music video for \\"Half Full Glass of Wine\\" The music video for \\"Half Full Glass of Wine\\" was made by New Zealand studio Special Problems. It features shots of the band that have been edited into various colourful and psychedelic animated sequences. Live performances \\"Half Full Glass of Wine\\" has been played since 2008, and has been a staple of their set, being featured in almost every concert that Tame Impala have played since. Live, Tame Impala extend the song to more than twice its original length (sometimes even going to over 12 minutes) and include extensive improvised jamming in the middle of the song between the second chorus and bridge, and recently have turned the jam into a space rock section with experimentation with effects pedal and guitar tones.

It was the band's first official single release. Its B-side was a cover of the Blue Boy song \\"Remember Me\\". The title \\"Sundown Syndrome\\" refers to a psychological phenomenon called Sundowning. Composition \\"Sundown Syndrome\\" was written by Kevin Parker in the key of E major in a mostly 6/8 time signature. It is based around the repeating chords of Fm7 and Gm7. The song begins in 4/4 with the two above mentioned chords, while the drums are loose and jazzy and have flange added to them. It then changes to 6/8 time with a looser strumming pattern. The verse comes soon after, with basic strums of the chords and occasional fills played on electric guitar. A kazoo then comes in, which some people mistook for a fuzz guitar, to play a solo in the E major scale over the same Fm7, Gm7 chord progression. Another verse featuring the same previous structure, and another kazoo solo in the same E major scale return again. This gives way to a chorus using the barre chord progression of D flat major, G flat major, E major, B major, G flat major and D flat major. The chorus is in 6/8 time, but switches to one bar of 4/4 at the end of every chord progression, and four bars of 4/4 at the end of every chorus. Parker's vocals are heavily reverbed and delayed to give it a spacy atmosphere. A bridge in 6/8 time comes next, with simple strums of the chords Fm7, Gm7, Fm7, A major and E major. A heavily phased, jazzy guitar solo using the E major scale comes in over the Fm7, Gm7 chord progression. The chorus comes back, and then a variation of the chorus barre chord progression on a phased guitar is played by itself, this time with just D flat major, G flat major and E major with occasional glissando slides between the chords. After a few bars of the guitar on its own, the chorus vocals come back over the top with occasional quiet bass fills. The chorus then comes back to its original form with the full band, and is extended longer than before. The song ends the way it started, in 4/4 with the strumming of the Fm7 and Gm7 chords. A barred C major chord with guitar feedback completely ends the song. Recording Both \\"Sundown Syndrome\\" and \\"Remember Me\\" were recorded at Toe Rag Studios in London, UK with Liam Watson in March 2009. Parker later recalled \\"There was no-one really doing any producing, we just played [Sundown Syndrome] how it was destined to be played and then Liam recorded it and just did his thing. We just wanted to do the Toerag thing basically and it was a really awesome experience, the sound he gets at Toerag are amazing its like no other studio in the world both visually and sonically.\\" Release \\"Sundown Syndrome\\" was later featured on the soundtrack for 2010 film The Kids Are All Right and was also included on the Ministry of Sound compilation album Chillout Sessions XII. \\"Sundown Syndrome\\" and \\"Remember Me\\" were later re-released on the deluxe edition of Innerspeaker. \\"Remember Me\\" came in at number 78 in the Triple J Hottest 100 in 2009. Live performances \\"Sundown Syndrome\\" was added to Tame Impala's set in 2009, and was played right through 2010. In 2011, it wasn't performed as regularly. It was performed for the first time in several years at the Panorama festival in 2017. A performance of \\"Sundown Syndrome\\" was filmed for the 2009 Summer Sonic Festival, and a live version was later released on their live album Live at the Corner. \\"Remember Me\\" has been performed as far back as 2008, and is still occasionally played, as of 2011. It was added to their set with the addition of Jay Watson on drums, because the song fit his drumming style. In 2010, Tame Impala incorporated a quiet outro where Parker loops his vocals and experiments with effects while Dominic Simper plays synth chords. Parker was an instant fan of the song when he saw a music video for it on Australian music television program Rage at the age of 11.

It was recorded during the sessions for the Innerspeaker album in 2009, and released as the first single from that album. The single features artwork from Australian artist Leif Podhajsky, who also created the artwork for Innerspeaker and the follow-up Lonerism. \\"Solitude Is Bliss\\" came in at number 33 in the Triple J Hottest 100 in 2010. Composition \\"Solitude Is Bliss\\" was written by Kevin Parker in the key of F major in a 4/4 time signature. It is based around the barre chords of D major, C major, Fadd11 and Gadd11. The song starts off with heavily phased strumming of the above-mentioned chords on an electric guitar. A drum fill comes crashing in to provide the rhythmic accompaniment along with the bass guitar. This gives way to the verses, which feature funky, heavily rhythmic picking of the root notes of D, E, G and A. The pre-chorus features the sustained chords of A major and B flat major, with Parker's vocals jumping between the two stereo channels, due to the wide automatic double tracking. The chorus then comes in featuring soaring vocals from Parker that have been heavily delayed and reverbed, featuring the same D major, C major, Fadd11, Gadd11 chord progression as the intro. The verse, pre- chorus, chorus format returns again, as well as the rhythmic root note picking, before giving way to a key change to E-flat major, with the chord progression C major, B-flat major, A-flat major. Over the top of this progression, a phased guitar solo plays in the E-flat major scale. After the solo, the bridge features a F major, B flat major, A flat major chord progression, with Parker's vocals over the top. Another key change occurs, to E major, and the intro, chorus chord progression and strumming pattern is then transposed to the E major key, turning into a D flat major, B major, Eadd11 progression. The chorus comes back in, and the key changes back to F major, featuring the chorus repeated until the end of the song. Release On 1 April 2010, \\"Solitude Is Bliss\\" was released as the first single from Tame Impala's 2010 debut album Innerspeaker. Parker explained the decision to release it as the lead single: \\"It was the most uplifting pop song. It‚Äôs the most sassy, confident sounding song. I like to think of it as coked up Tame Impala. It‚Äôs quite overconfident. You know, most of my lyrics aren‚Äôt as confident as that song. It‚Äôs almost arrogant I guess, but it is intended to be extremely confident because it‚Äôs about being alone and how confident you are when you‚Äôre alone.\\" The meaning of the song is \\"how awesome it can be to be inside your own head, how peaceful and enlightening it can be; good for the soul.\\" and \\"like bathing in the glory of being alone, like, 'How great is this? I'm alone!'\\" Music video Frames from the music video for \\"Solitude Is Bliss\\", which represents the themes of the song The music video for \\"Solitude Is Bliss\\" was directed by Megaforce in Kiev, Ukraine. It features a man dancing around the carnage in an almost post-apocalyptic world where there are flaming cars and dead bodies in the streets, which is meant to represent the man's mind, post-shock. During the choruses, the man is transported back to the \\"real world\\" hussle and bussle and finds himself having to push and shove through crowds of people in suits. The video took a bit of criticism for not fitting in with Tame Impala's psychedelic sound. Parker said \\"We really like how it's the opposite of what you expect... I kind of like to think of it as not the clip to the song, but if that scene was in a movie, then that song would be a really cool song to have over that scene.\\" Live performances \\"Solitude Is Bliss\\" has featured in almost every single Tame Impala set since the release of Innerspeaker. In 2011, Tame Impala started incorporating an interlude between \\"Solitude Is Bliss\\" and \\"It Is Not Meant to Be\\", which has been dubbed the \\"Solitude Interlude\\" by many fans, to seamlessly transition between the two songs.

It was recorded during the sessions for the Innerspeaker album in 2009, and released as the second single from that album. The single features artwork from Australian artist Leif Podhajsky, who also created the artwork for Innerspeaker and the follow-up Lonerism. \\"Lucidity\\" came in at number 74 in the Triple J Hottest 100 in 2010. Composition \\"Lucidity\\" was written by Kevin Parker in the key of A major in a 4/4 time signature. The verses feature heavily rhythmic strumming of the chords E7sus4add9 and E major. The pre- chorus features a variation of the verse vocal melody played on a fuzz guitar in the A major scale four times, before the verse rhythm plays one more time. The chorus then comes in with a key change to G major, and a B major, Dmaj7, A major, G major barre chord progression. After the chorus, it switches back to the key of A major and there is a short arpeggio from C major to D major chords to connect to the next verse. The second verse is half the length of the first one, and a short guitar solo in the A major scale comes in on the words \\"float away\\". The chorus, connecting guitar lick, pre-chorus, chorus format comes in at this point and then a bridge occurs. The bridge switches to the key of G major again and features the chords F major, G major, A major and B major played at a slower tempo. The bridge fizzles out, then it switches back to the A major key, and a scorching fuzz guitar solo over the verse chords and rhythm comes in, with heavy unison bends and whammy bar vibrato. The song then ends with fuzz pedal noise. Recording The instrumentals for \\"Lucidity\\" were recorded during the sessions for Innerspeaker in June to August 2009. The lyrics and vocals weren't recorded until the mixing stage of the album in December 2009, at Dave Fridmann's Tarbox Road Studio in Cassadaga, New York, which Parker later recalled: \\"I was thinking, 'We're going to be mixing this song in the next six hours'. I hadn't done any vocals and I didn't have any lyrics; I was literally losing my brain. I'd stop, sit outside in the snow and try to think of lyrics.\\" Music video Frames from the music video for \\"Lucidity\\", which shows its launching point, the height it reaches, the curvature of the Earth and the eagle inspecting the camera The music video for \\"Lucidity\\" was directed by Robert Hales. The video was filmed with a camera attached to a weather balloon outside of Mildura in Victoria, Australia. Parker starts the video by letting go of the camera attached to the weather balloon and letting it float away. The whole video is the same shot of the camera filming down below on a bird's-eye view as it floats up into the sky. The balloon eventually exits the Earth's atmosphere and into space, where you can see the curvature of the Earth and some shots of the Sun. The camera then comes crashing down back to Earth during the fuzz guitar solo section of the song. The video ends with an eagle coming to inspect the camera. Despite the fact that the band is only seen for a couple of seconds, the director got Tame Impala to mime the whole song. They had practiced the song for two days beforehand. Some shots of them miming the song can be seen in the behind the scenes video. Live performances Live, Tame Impala play \\"Lucidity\\" two semitones lower than the recorded version, switching to the keys of G major and F major, although in 2012 they have returned the song back to its originally recorded keys. \\"Lucidity\\" hasn't been a regular song in Tame Impala's set, but has been played throughout 2010 and 2011, with many experiments with the structure of the song, with it sometimes played in an uptempo danceable fashion and sometimes featuring an almost drone out ending during the bridge. Parker also experiments with different effects during the outro solo. In 2012 \\"Lucidity\\" was again added to Tame Impala's setlist.

It was recorded during the sessions for the Innerspeaker album in 2009, and released as the third single from that album. The single features artwork from Australian artist Leif Podhajsky, who also created the artwork for Innerspeaker and the follow-up Lonerism. Composition \\"Expectation\\" was written by Kevin Parker in the key of C major in a 6/4 time signature. It is based around the two repeating chords of Cmaj7 and Fmaj7. The song starts off in a polymeter rhythm, with 3/4 on the drums, and 6/8 on the guitar, bass and keyboard. The vocals have reverb and delay applied to them,, and the guitars are distorted through a flanger pedal. The verse features a slight call and response type effect where Parker's vocals come in over the top of the drums and bass, and then when the vocals stop they are replaced by the guitar over the top of the drums and bass. During the guitar sections in the verse, there is also a heavily flanged guitar low in the mix playing a melody in the F major scale. Another verse comes in over the top of the pre-verse instrumental section. The pre-chorus is short and features an F5 power chord played on guitar to punctuate the lyrics. There is also a short bass fill, as well as a synth fill. The chorus then comes in, featuring a chord progression of A minor, E minor, Fmaj7, Cmaj7, G major, Fmaj7. The oscillating, echoed vocals from the chorus filter into the next section, with the guitar from the intro played in 4/4. The song then returns to 3/4 with the regular strumming pattern returning again. A flanged backwards guitar overdub is also included. This gives way to the bridge, which has a key change to G minor, with the repetitive chords of G minor and C major. Additional reverb and delay on Parker's vocals are used to provide a hazy atmosphere. The key returns to C major in the next verse. It has the same Cmaj7 and Fmaj7 chord progression once again. The pre-chorus is extended for a few extra bars this time, and includes an Fmaj7 chord in addition to the F major of the previous pre-chorus. A synth fill transitions to the chorus, but this time it only has a synth playing the chorus chord progression behind Parker's delayed vocals, which have had the delay time shortened and the feedback amount extended. The full band then comes back in to play the chorus a couple of times more before the song completely fades out at 4:24. At 4:30, the song fades back in for a reprise of the bridge, with an extremely flanged guitar playing the G minor, C major chord progression in the key of G minor. The drums and bass soon follow the guitar, with the bass playing the vocal melody from the lyric \\"In all of the universe, there is nobody for me\\" using the G minor scale. The drums slowly start building and the song eventually comes to a crescendo with layered guitar overdubs and synths. The song then suddenly stops with a soft synth fading out a second after the band do. Music video Frames from the music video for \\"Expectation\\", displaying the use of the 360 degree camera The music video for \\"Expectation\\" was directed by Clemens Habicht. It was shot in autumn in a forest in Saint-Cloud, France, using a 360 degree camera. The video begins with Tame Impala walking into position and picking up their instruments. They perform the song in a circle around the camera, and then the image is flattened onto the frame, creating a panoramic effect, making it appear as if they are standing right next to each other. This creates a wobbly and distorted image around the corners of the frame. The camera then pans to the side and the image infinitely continues on the other side, √† la Pac-Man. There are also shots with different panning patterns, such as in a figure 8. After the first chorus, it cuts to a shot at night-time, with various members of the band walking around the camera and therefore continuing on the other side of the frame. There are also shots of them performing the song in the dimly lit forest, and other shots where they are letting off flares, creating a bright red haze in the dark forest as the band plays. This scene also features an almost hand-held camera effect with the camera zooming in up close and then crossing to other members of the band, bending the image in the process. The outro features heavy psychedelic panning effects, to create a dizzying and disorienting effect. The song finishes and the band put down their instruments and walk away. According to Parker, they spent the whole day filming it and did approximately 37 takes. The video only features the main portion of the song, and doesn't include the instrumental reprise. Live performances \\"Expectation\\" was added to Tame Impala's setlist in late 2010 and heavily featured in 2011. Live, Tame Impala play the entire song, including the reprise, and have a heavier use of effects in the reprise.

It was recorded during the sessions for the Innerspeaker album in 2009, and released as the fourth single from that album. The single features artwork from Australian artist Leif Podhajsky, who also created the artwork for Innerspeaker and the follow-up Lonerism. Composition \\"Why Won't You Make Up Your Mind?\\" was written by Kevin Parker in the key of F major in a 4/4 time signature. It is based around four repeating barre chords of A minor, B-flat major, E minor and F major, played on electric guitar, to create a trance-like, hypnotic and spacious atmosphere, while the bass is played rhythmically to fill in the guitar spaces. It starts with three hi-hat hits on the drums, which was included by Parker as a tribute to the Outkast song Hey Ya! which starts with an uncommon three upbeats, rather than the more common four upbeats. Before the verse starts, a pitch- shifted, delayed, fuzz guitar kicks in, which many mistook for a synth, to play a melody in the F major scale, featuring stereo panning effects to give it a sense of movement. The verse starts, featuring Parker's vocals, which are reverbed and delayed. The lyrics are minimal and only featured in the verses, while a heavily chorused, distorted guitar plays a riff in the choruses. Another verse comes in repeating the same lyrics, which gives way to a psychedelic outro, featuring many guitar overdubs with effects added to them coming to a crescendo. At only 3:19, \\"Why Won't You Make Up Your Mind?\\" is the shortest track on Innerspeaker. Music video Frames from the unofficial Pitchfork music video for \\"Why Won't You Make Up Your Mind?\\", which was filmed in 3D While an official music video was never made, Pitchfork Media created an unofficial video. It features the band playing a rendition of \\"Why Won't You Make Up Your Mind?\\" in a woodland. It was shot in 3D and features strong 3D effects and warbly images that make use of the extra dimension. Live performances \\"Why Won't You Make Up Your Mind?\\" has featured in almost every single Tame Impala set since the release of Innerspeaker, and was later added to the beginning of the set in 2011, transitioning into \\"Alter Ego\\". Live, Parker occasionally incorporates a heavily reverbed, improvised guitar solo in the outro, using the F major scale. It was performed on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on the 12 August 2011 episode to an American audience of 3.6 million viewers, on Tame Impala's live television debut. Former bassist Nick Allbrook wasn't present for the performance when there was a delay in the delivery of his visa and was slow to get through customs. Tame Impala's guitar technician, Matt Handley, filled in for Allbrook on bass.

Brewing companies vary widely in the volume and variety of beer produced, from small nanobreweries to microbreweries to massive multinational conglomerate macrobreweries. Iowa is a state located in the Midwestern United States, an area often referred to as the \\"American Heartland\\". In 2012 Iowa's 38 breweries and brewpubs employed 140 people directly, and more than 12,000 others in related jobs such as wholesaling and retailing. Including people directly employed in brewing, as well as those who supply Iowa's breweries with everything from ingredients to machinery, the total business and personal tax revenue generated by Iowa's breweries and related industries was more than $230 million. Consumer purchases of Iowa's brewery products generated more than $100 million additional tax revenue. In 2012, according to the Brewers Association, Iowa ranked 15th in the number of craft breweries per capita with 33. For context, at the end of 2013 there were 2,822 breweries in the United States, including 2,768 craft breweries subdivided into 1,237 brewpubs, 1,412 microbreweries and 119 regional craft breweries. In that same year, according to the Beer Institute, the brewing industry employed around 43,000 Americans in brewing and distribution and had a combined economic impact of more than $246 billion.

A 'kiss cam' camera scans the crowd, and selects a couple, their images being shown on the jumbotron screens in the arena. The kiss cam tradition originated in California in the early 1980s, as a way to fill in the gaps in play in professional baseball games, taking advantage of the possibilities of the then-new giant video screens. When the kiss cam is in action, the audience may be alerted by a known 'kiss-related' song being played, and/or an announcer warning the crowd. The crowd attending then pay attention to the marked 'kiss cam' video screen. Normally several consecutive couples are selected, and appear on the screen. As each pair appear onscreen, they are then expected to kiss. Additionally, sporting event staff may appear as couples who reject kisses or proposals in order to entertain or surprise the attending audience. A kiss is traditionally rewarded by applause, clapping, cheers and whistles, whereas a refusal to kiss is booed. It is intended as a light-hearted diversion to the main event during a timeout, television timeout, or similar downtime. Gay or lesbian couples may feel excluded from the Kiss Cam routine, or if included, may feel subject to homophobic expressions of disapproval from members of the watching crowd. Kissing under such public scrutiny can be severely embarrassing for either or both members of a couple, who may not be comfortable with public displays of affection to that level. When two people same sex were featured on the kiss cam, they used to be teammates or rivals. The first positive reaction by a gay couple caught on camera happened at AT&T; Park in San Francisco in August 2011. The men embraced \\"warmly\\" on the kiss cam On May 2, 2015, a gay couple was applauded after they kissed on the kiss cam at Dodger Stadium. The couple focused on by the camera may not be in a romantic relationship. They may in fact be brother and sister, friends, or not know each other at all. A platonic, perhaps awkward kiss often then results. Sometimes a refusal can generate a humorous twist for those watching. The kiss cam screen often appears on television if the event is televised. The couple focused on may not wish their attendance together at the event to be widely publicized. Some couples, although not wishing to kiss, feel intimidated by the crowd reaction, and feel forced to do so. Other instances may find the couple not noticing themselves on the screen, and the resulting inaction can be humorous or embarrassing. In popular culture On The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien, O'Brien parodied the Kiss Cam in comedy sketches, focusing on unlikely couples, such as a hunter and a bear. The Canadian group, the Arkells released a song titled \\"Kiss Cam\\". The Great Khali once hosted a weekly segment in his wrestling appearances called 'Khali Kiss Cam', in which he would kiss a female supposed audience member. He was preceded in this by the late wrestler Rick Rude, who would kiss a woman selected from the crowd after his victories. In Family Portrait, the finale of the first season of the US television comedy Modern Family, Phil is caught on a kiss cam, and feigning reluctance kisses Gloria, his step-mother-in-law.

He was one of the best-known Chinese wrestling (also known as Shuai jiao) practitioners and teachers. Biography Born in 1908 in Baoding, Hebei, Chang was remarkably strong among his peers from his early life. Chang's family roasted chickens, and their business provided sufficient income to allow him private lessons with Zhang Fenyen, a local businessman and Shuai Chiao master who practiced baoding shuai jiao as instructed by Ping Jinyi. Chang distinguished himself early among Zhang's pupils as a promising martial artist. This led to close personal attention and training in areas normally reserved for more senior students. Zhang taught Chang unorthodox training drills and methods to aid him in developing his shuai jiao skill, including using leg sweeps to drive grasshoppers into the air where the correctly positioned hand could easily catch them. At 20, after marrying master Fenyen's second daughter, Chang left Hopei and moved to Nankin to train at the Kuo Shu, where many Chinese martial artists trained and shared their knowledge. After five years, Tung Sheng competed in 1933 in the 5th National Kuo Shu Tournament (also called the \\"All China Full Contact Tournament\\") and won the heavyweight division over several hundred other practitioners,Ch'ang Tung Sheng - A Rare Treasure among them the renowned Liu Chiou-Sheng, who went to be his biggest rival. Chang com Now nicknamed the \\"Flying Butterfly,\\" Chang would go on to win numerous challenge matches before entering China's armed services - traveling across the Kuomintang controlled areas of China to seek out other shuai jiao practitioners in order to test his skills. He may also have first started learning xingyi in this period. In one of his most famous matches, Chang challenged the Mongolian wrestling champion, Hukli, who was supposedly 7 ft tall and weighed near 400 pounds. The contest was judged under wrestling, without strikes or locks. Chang was victorious, throwing down Hukli repeatedly, despite the size difference.Grand Master Chang Tung Sheng - Shuai Chiao Chang taught at the Nanjing Central Kuoshu Institute () and was the youngest faculty member at the time. There, he exchanged knowledge with other martial arts experts. He created his own variation of t'ai chi and xingyi, Chang t'ai chi, based on Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan, xing yi and his Shuai Jiao knowledge.Great Grandmaster Chang Fong-Yen & Grandmaster Ch'ang Tung- Sheng Chang traveled across all China and studied under around 70 masters, always introducing himself as a simple student in order to learn everything possible. Throughout the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II, of which China became a part, Chang instructed large numbers of Chinese Nationalist troops in Shuai Chiao (including the elite Red Wall paratroopers), while continuing to fend off numerous challenges. When not otherwise occupied, Chang visited several POW camps to test his Shuai Chiao against Japanese practitioners of judo, jujutsu and karate. It was specially important his performance in the Kuang-Si prison, where he defeated judo practitioners Haido Takayama, Kuma Hisa and Masao Hichi. Chang represented the Army in 1948 when he was victorious in a nationwide competition for shuai jiao, Chin Na, grappling and throwing all together. When Kuomintang troops under Chiang Kai- shek were driven from mainland China to Taiwan by the Communist rebels, Chang left for Taiwan. On the establishment of the National Police University, in Taipei in the Republic of China, Chang was given a position of Senior Instructor in unarmed training by Presidential edict. He taught there for over 30 years. There are several famous anecdotes about Chang's short temper. In one occasion, a man came to the Taipei National Police University and asked to train with him; instead of answering, Tung Sheng attacked the visitor and threw him down, forcing him to confess that he had actually come to challenge him after the training, something Chang had already figured out.Will the Real Ch'ang Tung Sheng Please Stand Up, Frank DeMaria, American Center for Chinese Studies Similarly, Robert W.

It is most commonly applied to object-oriented languages. Typestates define valid sequences of operations that can be performed upon an instance of a given type. Typestates, as the name suggests, associate state information with variables of that type. This state information is used to determine at compile-time which operations are valid to be invoked upon an instance of the type. Operations performed on an object that would usually only be executed at run-time are performed upon the type state information which is modified to be compatible with the new state of the object. Typestates are capable of representing behavioral type refinements such as \\"method A must be invoked before method B is invoked, and method C may not be invoked in between\\". Typestates are well-suited to representing resources that use open/close semantics by enforcing semantically valid sequences such as \\"open then close\\" as opposed to invalid sequences such as leaving a file in an open state. Such resources include filesystem elements, transactions, connections and protocols. For instance, developers may want to specify that files or sockets must be opened before they are read or written, and that they can no longer be read or written if they have been closed. The name \\"typestate\\" stems from the fact that this kind of analysis often models each type of object as a finite state machine. In this state machine, each state has a well-defined set of permitted methods/messages, and method invocations may cause state transitions. Petri nets have also been proposed as a possible behavioral model for use with refinement types. Typestate analysis was introduced by Rob Strom in 1983 in the Network Implementation Language (NIL) developed at IBM's Watson Lab. It was formalized by Strom and Yemini in a 1986 article that described how to use typestate to track the degree of initialisation of variables, guaranteeing that operations would never be applied on improperly initialised data, and further generalized in the Hermes programming language. In recent years, various studies have developed ways of applying the typestate concept to object-oriented languages. Approach \`struct{int x;int y;int z;}\`.}} The least element ‚ä• coincides with the state ‚àÖ of no struct components initialized. Strom and Yemini (1986) required the set of typestates for a given type to be partially ordered such that a lower typestate can be obtained from a higher one by discarding some information. For example, an \`int\` variable in C typically has the typestates \\"uninitialized\\" < \\"initialized\\", and a \`FILE*\` pointer may have the typestates \\"unallocated\\" < \\"allocated, but uninitialized\\" < \\"initialized, but file not opened\\" < \\"file opened\\". Moreover, Strom and Yemini require that each two typestates have a greatest lower bound, i.e. that the partial order is even a meet-semilattice; and that each order has a least element, always called \\"‚ä•\\". Their analysis is based on the simplification that each variable v is assigned only one typestate for each point in the program text; if a point p is reached by two different execution paths and v inherits different typestates via each path, then the typestate of v at p is taken to be the greatest lower bound of the inherited typestates. For example, in the following C snippet, the variable \`n\` inherits the typestate \\"initialized\\" and \\"uninitialized\\" from the \`then\` and the (empty) \`else\` part, respectively, hence it has typestate \\"uninitialized\\" after the whole conditional statement. int n; // here, n has typestate \\"uninitialized\\" if (...) { n = 5; // here, n has typestate \\"initialized\\" } else { /*do nothing*/ // here, n has typestate \\"uninitialized\\" } // here, n has typestate \\"uninitialized\\" = greatest_lower_bound(\\"initialized\\",\\"uninitialized\\") Every basic operationthese include language constructs, e.g. \`+=\` in C, and standard library routines, e.g.\`fopen()\` has to be equipped with a typestate transition, i.e. for each parameter the required and ensured typestate before and after the operation, respectively. For example, an operation \`fwrite(...,fd)\` requires \`fd\` to have typestate \\"file opened\\". More precisely, an operation may have several outcomes, each of which needs its own typestate transition. For example, the C code \`FILE *fd=fopen(\\"foo\\",\\"r\\")\` sets \`fd\`'s typestate to \\"file opened\\" and \\"unallocated\\" if opening succeeds and fails, respectively. For each two typestates t1 <¬∑ t2, a unique typestate coercion operation needs to be provided which, when applied to an object of typestate t2, reduces its typestate to t1, possibly by releasing some resources. For example, \`fclose(fd)\` coerces \`fd\`'s typestate from \\"file opened\\" to \\"initialized, but file not opened\\". A program execution is called typestate-correct if * before each basic operation, all parameters have exactly the typestate required by the operation's typestate transition, and * on program termination, all variables are in typestate ‚ä•.This aims at ensuring that e.g. all files have been closed, and all \`malloc\`ed memory has been \`free\`d. In most programming languages, a variable's lifetime may end before program termination; the notion of typestate-correctness has then to be sharpened accordingly. A program text is called typestate-consistent if it can be transformed, by adding appropriate typestate coercions, to a program whose points can be statically labelled with typestates such that any path allowed by the control flow is typestate-correct. Strom and Yemini give a linear-time algorithm that checks a given program text for typestate-consistency, and computes where to insert which coercion operation, if any. Challenges In order to achieve a precise and effective typestate analysis, it is necessary to address the problem of aliasing. Aliasing occurs when an object has more than one reference or pointer that points to it. For the analysis to be correct, state changes to a given object must be reflected in all references that point to that object, but in general it is a difficult problem to track all such references. This becomes especially hard if the analysis needs to be modular, that is, applicable to each part of a large program separately without taking the rest of the program into account. As another issue, for some programs, the method of taking the greatest lower bound at converging execution paths and adding corresponding down-coercion operations appears to be inadequate. For example, before the \`return 1\` in the following program,assuming that \`int parse_int_attr(const char *name,int *val)\` initializes \`*val\` whenever it succeeds all components \`x\`, \`y\`, and \`z\` of \`coord\` are initialized, but Strom's and Yemini's approach fails to recognize this, since each initialization of a struct component in the loop body has to be down-coerced at loop re-entry to meet the typestate of the very first loop entry, viz. ‚ä•. A related problem is that this example would require overloading of typestate transitions; for example, \`parse_int_attr(\\"x\\",&coord-;>x)\` changes a typestate \\"no component initialized\\" to \\"x component initialized\\", but also \\"y component initialized\\" to \\"x and y component initialized\\". int parse_coord(struct{int x;int y;int z;} *coord) { int seen = 0; /* remember which attributes have been parsed */ while (1) if (parse_int_attr(\\"x\\",&coord-;>x)) seen = 1; else if (parse_int_attr(\\"y\\",&coord-;>y)) seen = 2; else if (parse_int_attr(\\"z\\",&coord-;>z)) seen = 4; else break; if (seen != 7) /* some attribute missing, fail */ return 0; ... /* all attributes present, do some computations and succeed */ return 1; } Typestate Inference There are several approaches seeking to infer typestates out of programs (or even other artifacts such as contracts).

A performance lasts about fifteen minutes. The work is a portrait of Janitzio Island in Lake P√°tzcuaro, Mexico. History The score of Janitzio was completed on 31 July 1933 and was premiered under the composer's baton. According to some sources, this was by the Orquesta Sinf√≥nica de M√©xico in the Teatro Hidalgo in Mexico City on 8 December 1933 (; ). However, before it was unveiled to the audiences of the OSM, Revueltas had conducted it at the Palacio de Bellas Artes with the Orquesta del Conservatorio on 13 October 1933 in a program that also included Revueltas's own Ocho por radio, Daniel Ayala's Leyenda, and the first Mexican performance of Manuel Ponce's Canto y danza de los antiguos mexicanos (; ). According to one source, Revueltas originally composed the work for the film Janitzio, directed by Carlos Navarro and starring Emilio Fern√°ndez . However, this film, released in 1935, was produced after Revueltas's score had already been premiered, and the film's music is credited to Francisco Dom√≠nguez. Revueltas revised the score three years later, completing the new version on 30 December 1936 at the Sanitorio Ram√≠rez Moreno in Mexico City, where he was hospitalized for fatigue and rehabilitation from alcoholism (; ). The original version was dedicated to Carlos Ch√°vez and Armando Echevarr√≠a (librarian of the OSM), but the 1936 revised score bears no dedication . Programmatic content Lake P√°tzcuaro and cemetery on Janitzio Island Janitzio is a portrait of Janitzio Island in Lake P√°tzcuaro, and is one of only two of Revueltas's works that refers directly to a Mexican landscape (the other is Cuauhn√°huac) . The composer wrote a short programme note on the work (in at least two versions): This note has been cited as an example of the composer's self-deprecating sarcasm. However, considering his leftist political views, these remarks might better be understood \\"as a reflection of his disdain for bourgeois consumerism, or as an attack on artistic production within a capitalist system\\" . Instrumentation The work is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, E clarinet, B clarinet, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, two trombones, tuba, suspended cymbal, side drum, bass drum, tamtam, and strings. The original 1933 version had only two horns, one trombone, and no violas; the side drum was to be played with the snares off, and the word \\"gong\\" appears instead of \\"tam-tam\\" . Analysis Janitzio follows the three-part structure that Revueltas favoured in all his orchestral works, with a lyrical, slow middle section . This has also been described, somewhat differently, as a \\"fast‚Äìslow‚Äìradiant\\" structure . The three sections are marked \\"Con brio\\" (b. 1‚Äì177), Lento espressivo (molto sostenuto e cantabile) (b. 177‚Äì238), and Tempo I (b. 239‚Äì386) . The lively opening employs certain melodic turns native to the region, which may have been modelled on a Pur√©pecha son called \\"La Reina de los Huajiniguiles\\" (The Queen of the Huajiniguiles), from Uruaip√°n in the state of Michoac√°n . There are two main theme groups. The first is made up of three motivic cells, found in the first four bars and characterised principally by their rhythms, from which the entire work is generated: an ascending perfect fourth from E to A, a scale segment G‚ÄìA‚ÄìB‚Äì(C); and a descending major third from C‚ÄìA. These plainly establish the key of A major . The second theme group (b. 89‚Äì138) is more compact than the first, and is primarily lyrical rather than rhythmic. It is not clear that this is actually a secondary thematic group as found in a sonata-allegro form. It is instead developmental in essence . The middle section is contrasted by its simplicity, slower tempo, and 3/4 metre (though there are metrical variations throughout the section). It is features a lyrical, two-voiced theme, first presented by the clarinet and bassoon over an ostinato bass accompaniment. The key of G major is established by an insistent G pedal in the basses as well as by the tuba's dominant D at bar 183 and a dominant-tonic cadence at b. 190. The thematic development is continued from the previous section . In the central part of the concluding section (between rehearsal numbers 28 and 29), Revueltas uses a \\"distortion\\" characteristic of his style. A waltz in A major evoking the atmosphere of 19th-century salon music is contradicted by a surrealistic presentation in the brass of a B-major arpeggio . Reception Butterfly-net fishing on Lake P√°tzcuaro From the outset, Janitzio was a great success with Mexican audiences and the press. One critic reported that the audience demanded that Janitzio be repeated (, cited in ). Another review of the premiere reported: Janitzio was the epitome of the style of musical nationalism preferred by Mexican audiences, which was based on mestizo, popular elements, rather than on the pre-Columbian. Revueltas had by this time developed a style in which various, often disparate elements of the Mexican cultural soundscape were made to collide in audible violence: the popular, the modern, the urban, the peasant, the Indian, the military, the street life, the market, and the dance. Although the music sometimes celebrates the plurality and vitality of Mexican society, it also acknowledges clear cultural and societal conflicts. Whereas the harsher, more modernist examples of this style, such as Esquinas and Ventanas (both 1931) were given a cool welcome by audiences, more lyrical, milder examples, such as Colorines (1932) and Janitzio, were enthusiastically received. In fact, in the annual poll taken at the end of the 1933 OSM season Janitzio came in first place with 221 votes, ahead of even Ottorino Respighi‚Äôs Pines of Rome (210 votes), Igor Stravinsky‚Äôs Firebird Suite (198 votes), and Robert Schumann‚Äôs Piano Concerto (142 votes). This was in sharp contrast with Ventanas, which had received only 27 votes in the previous year's poll . Discography * From the Bay of Naples.

It was founded in 2008 and by November 2014, KAT became the most visited BitTorrent directory in the world, overtaking The Pirate Bay, according to the site's Alexa ranking. KAT went offline on 20 July 2016 when the domain was seized by the U.S. government. The site's proxy servers were shut down by its staff at the same time. In December 2016, former KAT staff members revived the KAT community by creating a website with its predecessor's features and appearance.  History  KAT was initially launched in November 2008 at the domain name kickasstorrents.com. In April 2011, it moved to a Philippinian domain kat.ph after a series of domain name seizures by the US Department of Justice against Demonoid and Torrentz. The site later moved across several different domains, which the operators planned to do every six months, including ka.tt, kickass.to, kickass.so, kickasstorrents.im and kat.cr. In June 2016, KAT added an official Tor network .onion address. Blocking and censorship KickassTorrents on its website claimed that it complied with the DMCA and it removed infringing torrents reported by content owners. On February 28, 2013, Internet service providers (ISPs) in the United Kingdom were ordered by the High Court in London to block access to KickassTorrents, along with two other torrent sites. Judge Richard Arnold ruled that the site's design contributed to copyright infringement. On 14 June, the domain name was changed to Tonga domain name kickass.to as a part of the site's regular domain change. Later on 23 June, KAT was delisted from Google at the request of the MPAA. In late August 2013, KAT was blocked by Belgian ISPs. In January 2014, several Irish ISPs started blocking KAT, and in February, Twitter started blocking links to KAT, although this was stopped after a few days. In June 2014, KAT was blocked in Malaysia by the Communications and Multimedia Commission for violating copyright law. In December 2014, the site moved to the Somalia domain name kickass.so, reportedly as a result of site's regular domain change. On 9 February 2015, kickass.so was listed as \\"banned\\" on Whois, causing the site to go offline. Later that day, the site reverted to its former domain name kickass.to. On 14 February 2015, it was found that messages mentioning \\"kickass.to\\" were blocked on Steam chat, but \\"kickass.so\\" and other popular torrent websites were not blocked, only flagged as \\"potentially malicious\\". On 23 April 2015, the site moved to the Isle of Man based domain name kickasstorrents.im but was quickly taken down later that day and on 24 April it was moved to the Costa Rica based domain name kat.cr. By July 2015, the kat.cr address had been removed from Google Search's results. After the removal, the top Google search result for KAT in many locations pointed to a fake KAT site that prompted visitors to download malware. In October 2015, Portugal bypassed its courts by making a voluntary agreement between ISPs, rightsholders and the Ministry of Culture to block access to KAT and most of the other popular BitTorrent websites. At the same time, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox blocked access to KAT because of security concerns with some of the ads pointing to malware. In April 2016, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox blocked KAT due to phishing concerns. Both blocks were later removed after KAT dealt with the concerns. One of the main domains of the site went up for sale in August 2016. Arrest of the alleged owner Notice displayed on KickassTorrents sites after its seizure. On 20 July 2016, the United States Department of Justice announced that it had seized the KAT.cr domain and had identified its alleged owner. Artem Vaulin (), a 30-year-old Ukrainian man known online as \\"tirm\\", was detained in Poland after being charged with a four-count U.S. criminal indictment. The remaining domains were taken offline voluntarily after the KAT.cr domain name was seized. Following the seizure of the original KAT domain multiple unofficial mirrors have been put online. These have no connection to the original team who have been urging users to exercise caution. A number of these mirrors have since been taken down. Vaulin was arrested after investigators cross- referenced an IP address he used for an iTunes transaction with an IP address used to log into KAT's Facebook page. The FBI also posed as an advertiser and obtained details of a bank account associated with the site. The investigation was led by special agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan, who also tracked down Ross Ulbricht, the operator of the online black market Silk Road. The criminal complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by Homeland Security Investigations, said that it was in possession of full copies of KAT's hard drives, including its email server. The investigation suggested that KAT made over $12 million per year in advertising revenue. In late August 2016, the Department of Justice followed the complaint with a full grand jury indictment of Vaulin and two other defendants, Ievgen Kutsenko and Oleksandr Radostin; while Vaulin was still being held in Polish prison. Vaulin has both a Polish and US legal representation Ira Rothken as his lawyers to handle the allegations. In November 2016, a Polish appeals court refused to allow bail for Vaulin, stating the evidence provided by the US is sufficient to keep him in prison.Alleged KickassTorrents Owner Stays in Prison, Court Rules 2 November 2016 Revival In mid-December 2016, some of the former KAT staff and moderators launched a website with a similar appearance as the original under the domain katcr.co.

The 2700-ton tanker was built at the Armstrong Mitchell yard, Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne, Britain, with eight compartments for the cargo. It was the first ship in which oil could be pumped directly into the vessel hull instead of being loaded in barrels or drums. (Other sources give the gross tonnage in the 2300s.) It was built for Wilhelm Anton Riedemann's shipping firm in Geestem√ºnde and ran mostly as a tramp steamer.

Bartolome with councilors Marisse Balina-Eron and Allan Paul C. Cruz as co-sponsors). Motivated by the urgency of need to serve the youth of growing Taguig City, the Local Government Administration came up with Ordinance No. 29 Series of 2004 \\"An Ordinance Establishing the Pamantasan ng Taguig and Appropriating Funds Thereof.\\" This was an offshoot of the provisions of the Local Government Code. Pamantasan ng Taguig was renamed Taguig City University pursuant to City Ordinance No.13, Series of 2009. TCU has gone through development problems ‚Äî top billed by the very basic need to have enough buildings. For two years, despite its courage, the university hardly manifested physical eloquence. In S.Y. 2006-2007, it swiftly took off: The organization of the university and construction of the TCU main building commenced. Meanwhile, undergraduate classes were held in high schools and elementary campuses in Taguig, lent to the growing management of TCU. In 2006, General Ricardo Papa Sr. Memorial High School offered some rooms for free. In 2007, rooms expanded to Taguig Elementary School, Sta. Ana- District 1 and Em's Elementary School, Signal Village-District 2. In 2008-2009 additional undergraduate classes were held in annex school of General Ricardo Papa Sr. Memorial High School at Brgy. Ususan and Signal Village Elementary School (Annex). Lack of classrooms did not deter the holding of graduate school classes. The graduate program in Master of Arts in Teaching major in Mathematics, Filipino, English and Social Sciences were lumped together as a common major. It paved the way to the development of the Master of Arts in Educational Management, while holding classes in a secluded and secured room at Sunshine Mall Taguig. School year 2009-2010 reflected the metamorphosis of youthful Taguig City University, because in June all classes from undergraduate to graduate programs started to be held at the new main building of TCU; the rest became part of history. On TCU's first year of operation, 2006-2007, the university was under the stewardship of the vice president for Academic Affairs, Tess Umali. The organization of the university and construction of the TCU main building were the highlights of this period. In 2007-2010, the first TCU president was vice mayor George Elias. During his term the construction of the main building was completed and curricular offerings were expanded. Year 2010 to the early part of 2011, TCU was under the reigns of Bro. Rolando Dizon who became instrumental in creating four schools: Graduate Studies; Education, Arts and Sciences; Engineering, Technology and Computer Sciences; Management, Entrepreneurship, and Criminology. On April 4, 2011, Mayor Ma. Laarni \\"Lani\\" L. Cayetano installed Atty. Lutgardo B. Barbo as the third president of TCU.

History The Christian Troubadours were originally organized in Lakewood, California, by guitar player and bass singer Wayne Walters, a native of Belleville, Arkansas. After the Troubadours formed, Walters also became manager and songwriter for the group. In 1962, upright bass player and tenor singer Bill Carter traveled to California from Eagleton, Arkansas, to join the Troubadours. At this time, the group had relocated in Modesto, California. A year later, Phil Price joined the band to play banjo as well as sing baritone and as a musical arranger. In time, Leroy Blankenship became lead singer in addition to preaching at the revival meetings and services held in conjunction with concerts given by the group.

His parents were Isaac and Ruth Shepherd (Johnson) Henderson. Isaac Henderson, who was born in Maryland, was a wealthy planter and a representative in the state legislature. Henderson graduated from Franklin College, now the University of Georgia, in 1843. After graduation, he became a lawyer, judge, mill owner, planter, a major in the Georgia militia and, in 1859 and 1860, a Georgia state legislator. He was a wealthy planter and slave owner in Covington in Newton County at the beginning of the Civil War. Robert J. Henderson's wife was Laura (Wood) Henderson.Allardice, Bruce S.

From this source and Calhoun we know that Mrs. L. J. Hill was Mary Ruth and it was in the home of Mary Ruth that Henderson died. American Civil War service Robert Johnson Henderson did not join the Confederate States Army at the outset of the Civil War. In early 1862, he helped raise the 42nd Georgia Infantry Regiment and was elected colonel on March 20, 1862.Eicher, 2001, p. 601. The regiment soon saw service at the Battle of the Cumberland Gap (June 1862) where Union forces under Brigadier General George W. Morgan secured temporary control of the gap.Morgan, George W. \\"Cumberland Gap\\" In Battles and Leaders of the Civil War, vol. 3, edited by Robert Underwood Johnson and Clarence C. Buel.

His brigade's charge helped restore a crumbling Confederate flank. Johnston proceeded to promote Henderson to brigadier general, or more likely to acting brigadier general, because Johnston had no authority to promote officers to general officer rank. On the other hand, the Confederate civilian authorities were in disarray and the Confederate Senate had already met for the last time so Henderson was unlikely to receive an official appointment, confirmation and commission and he was never legally commissioned. Henderson led the brigade as part of Carter L. Stevenson's Division of the II Corps of the Army of Tennessee until the surrender of Johnston's army at Bennett Place near Durham, North Carolina on April 26, 1865. Henderson was remembered for his bravery, strict discipline and expert management of men in battle. At the suggestion of his division commander, when Henderson signed his 1865 parole he listed his rank as brigadier general. Later, Henderson stated in his pardon application that he had been recommended for promotion to brigadier general but had never received a commission. Aftermath After the war, Henderson found his property in ruins but was able to rebuild his mill and his business as a planter. Robert Johnson Henderson died on February 3, 1891 at his daughter's (Mrs. L. J. (Mary Ruth) Hill) home in Atlanta, Georgia. He is buried in a family cemetery, identified as Henderson (Southview) Cemetery, in Covington, Georgia.

Written by Peter Nowalk and directed by Chandra Wilson, the episode was originally broadcast on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States on October 29, 2009. Grey's Anatomy centers on a group of young doctors in training. In this episode, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) performs an operation on a hospital technician's \\"inoperable\\" tumor, despite the objections of the chief of surgery, Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.). The episode was designed to revolve around Dempsey's character. Katherine Heigl (Dr. Izzie Stevens) was absent from the episode, as she was filming the 2010 romantic comedy Life as We Know It. Mark Saul, Jesse Williams, and Nora Zehetner returned as guest stars, while Faran Tahir made his only appearance. \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" won Wilson an NAACP Image Award, and received positive reviews from critics, with Tahir's character receiving particular praise. The initial episode broadcast was ranked #4 for the night with 13.74 million viewers, and a 5.2/13 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Plot \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" opens with Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital's chief of surgery, Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) implementing a new computerized surgical scheduling system, which is disliked by many of the hospital's staff. Thereafter, Isaac (Faran Tahir), a hospital lab technician, brings Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) a scan of his tumor, which has been declared inoperable by several other physicians due to its complexity. Isaac asks Shepherd to remove it. Shepherd agrees, but Webber refuses permission for the procedure because of the high risk involved. Shepherd ignores the chief's directions and schedules the surgery. The interns and residents all want the chance to assist due to the rarity of such a tumor, so Shepherd hosts a competition in which the winner gets to join him in the operating room. After seeing Dr. Steve Mostow (Mark Saul) make a mistake, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) is confident that she will win the competition, but loses to Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams). Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) is not invited to compete because Shepherd wants her to be his caregiver in what would be a long surgery. Knowing that she will not be able to use the bathroom for the entire procedure, Lexie decides to wear a diaper into the operating room; her courage and dedication impresses Yang. Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) is scheduled for an interleukin 2 (IL-2) treatment but is absent from the hospital. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) calls her, but she does not answer or come, so Karev cries to fellow resident Dr. Reed Adamson (Nora Zehetner). Shepherd spends ten hours in the operating room contemplating what to do about the tumor, with the motivational support of fellow surgeons Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), and Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez). Webber orders Shepherd to end the surgery because he is wasting hospital resources. Shortly thereafter, Isaac awakens to Shepherd explaining that the surgery would not have been possible without paralyzing him. Isaac convinces Shepherd to operate again in secret the next day, and the latter maps out a diagram of the surgery on his bedroom wall while discussing it with his wife Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), who is home on bed rest after donating part of her liver to her father in the episode \\"Tainted Obligation\\". Backed by his fellow attendings, Shepherd obtains Webber's permission to cut the cord but tells Avery and Lexie that they were not cutting the cord and playing by ear instead. He removes all but a tiny section of the tumor. Webber discovers that Shepherd is operating and is about to put an end to it, but Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) tells him to go away. Shepherd has to cut a nerve to remove the rest of the tumor, but does not know which will result in paralysis. He decides with a game of \\"Eeny, meeny, miny, moe\\", ultimately cutting the correct nerve and eliminating the entirety of the tumor. Despite the successful surgery, Webber is enraged and verbally fires Shepherd. Shepherd dismisses this in a light tone and goes home to drink champagne with his wife. Production Peter Nowalk intended the episode to revolve around Patrick Dempsey's character. Running for 43 minutes, the episode was written by Peter Nowalk and directed by Wilson; the latter portrays Bailey. Jenny Barak edited the music and Donald Lee Harris served as the production designer. Heigl was absent from the episode, as she was filming the romantic comedy Life as We Know It (2010). The song featured in the episode was Bat for Lashes' \\"Moon And Moon\\", featured on their second album Two Suns. Saul, Zehetner, and Williams returned to the episode as Mostow, Adamson, and Avery, respectively, while Tahir made his first and only appearance as Isaac. The scenes in the operating room were filmed at the Prospect Studios in Los Feliz, Los Angeles; Nowalk said the scenes were difficult to shoot, due to the technicality involved. Pompeo's appearances in the episode were scarce, as she was eight-and-a-half months pregnant during shooting. According to Nowalk, the idea to have Lexie wear a diaper to get through the operation was inspired by an episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show. He added: \\"It wasn't that big of a leap for us to go diaper. Our doctors are hardcore by nature.\\" Nowalk said that this episode was primarily focused around Shepherd, which he considered an \\"experiment\\". He commented that the idea of Isaac's storyline came from Dr. Robert Bray, a neurosurgeon in Los Angeles. Nowalk intended the nature of the episode to be \\"different\\", attributing it to the fact that Heigl's character was absent. He also praised Wilson for directing the episode, commenting that \\"she acts, she sings, and now she directs\\". The majority of the episode involved Shepherd staring at his patient's tumor, contemplating what to do. Nowalk offered his insight on this: Reception \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" was originally broadcast on October 29, 2009 in the United States on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). The episode underperformed the previous installment, \\"I Saw What I Saw\\", in terms of viewership. It was viewed by a total of 13.74 million people, down 1.66 percent from the previous episode, which garnered 15.04 million viewers. In terms of viewership, \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" ranked #4 for the night, behind Game 2 of the 2009 World Series, and CBS's CSI and The Mentalist. The installment did not rank high for viewership, but its 5.2/13 Nielsen rating ranked second in its 9:00 Eastern time-slot and the entire night for both the rating and share percentages of the 18‚Äì49 demographic, losing to the 2009 World Series but beating CSI, The Mentalist, and Private Practice. Although its rating was in the top rankings for the night, it was a decrease from the previous episode, which garnered a 5.6/14 rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Faran Tahir's character was well received by several critics. Critics were positive in their reviews of the episode. The Huffington Post Michael Pascua called \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" a \\"hit-and-miss\\" episode, criticizing the slang dialogue by saying it \\"sounded like it came from a MTV drama\\", but praising the instalment's \\"character-driven development\\". Pascua was positive on the development of Tahir's character, writing: \\"I hope he comes back in a later episode just to remind these people about patience and hope.\\" TV Fanatic Steve Marsi gave a positive review of the episode, saying it \\"won [him] over\\", and also praising Tahir's character. Marsi applauded the development of Dempsey's character, calling him \\"the best [doctor]\\", and noted that Wilson's directing may \\"net her an Emmy nomination\\". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Jennifer Armstrong had mixed feedback on the episode, writing: \\"The all-medical, all-the-time episodes need to stop.\\" However, she found it \\"fantastic\\" when Shepherd drew on the wall, and enjoyed Tahir's character, calling him \\"lovely\\". Armstrong also said that \\"Give Peace A Chance\\" was in \\"ER territory\\", adding: \\"I do not watch Grey's Anatomy to get my ER fix.\\" Adam Bryant of TV Guide enjoyed this episode compared to the previous one, but disliked the possible romantic development between Karev and Adamson. In his review, he concluded that the instalment \\"proves that Meredith Grey doesn't have to do all the heavy lifting on this show all the time.\\" People Carrie Bell enjoyed the episode, praising the balance of cast members. She called Isaac \\"beloved\\", and found that the teamwork in the episode proved \\"there's no 'I' in a team\\". Former Star-Ledger editor Alan Sepinwall gave a positive review of the entry, applauding the shift in themes and Shepherd's character development.Sepinwall, Alan (October 30, 2009). \\"Grey's Anatomy, 'Give Peace a Chance': Eeeny-meeny diaper genie\\" What's Alan Watching? Blogspot. Retrieved July 21, 2012. Writing for BuddyTV, Glenn Diaz found the episode comical, calling the scene in which Robbins stands up to Webber \\"hilarious\\", and naming Yang the instalment's \\"comic-relief\\". Referring to Shepherd and Webber's constant arguments, an AfterEllen senior editor said: \\"Seriously, these two need to drop their pants and get it over with.\\" Peter Nowalk's writing of the episode was nominated for a Humanitas Prize in the 60 Minute Category. The episode also earned Wilson an NAACP Image Award under the Outstanding Directing in a Dramatic Series category.

It is similar to the slang word guesstimate, a portmanteau of guess and estimate. History The slang term \\"SWAG\\" is generally thought to have originated in the US military, either the Army or the Air Force. Journalist Melvin J. Lasky wrote that it was first used casually by US Army General William Westmoreland during the Vietnam War. Westmoreland would sometimes reply \\"SWAG\\" to reporters' questions about American failure to neutralize the enemy. Westmoreland's use of the term was affirmed in court by Colonel John Frank Stewart in November 1984 during witness testimony for the lawsuit initiated by Westmoreland against CBS for their TV documentary The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam Deception. On the witness stand, Stewart explained that in Vietnam, the military intelligence branch that he commanded would deliver numbers of enemy strength to Westmoreland, the numbers derived from \\"the SWAG principle\\". There was laughter in the court when Stewart explained what was meant by the acronym SWAG. An earlier use of term is mentioned by linguist J. Robert Dumouchel who wrote the 1975 book, Dictionary of Development Terminology. Dumouchel says he first encountered SWAG \\"in the vernacular of community development\\" in the US in the 1960s. Regardless of its origin, the term gained greater prominence in the first half of 1999 in connection with the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Reporter John F. Harris of the Washington Post was the first person to put the term into a newspaper article. Describing the factors that led to President Bill Clinton relying on the US Air Force in Kosovo instead of employing \\"200,000 NATO troops\\", Harris wrote that NATO's estimate requiring 200,000 ground troops was regarded by American war planners as politically impossible to achieve; it was quickly removed from consideration. \\"NATO's analysis, officials said, was not a comprehensive study. Instead, it was an initial review that some officials called a 'SWAG'‚Äîmilitary parlance for a 'scientific wild-ass guess.'\\" Use SWAG is used to describe an estimate derived from a combination of factors including past experience, general impressions, and heuristic or approximate calculations rather than an exhaustive search, proof, or rigorous calculation. The SWAG is an educated guess but is not regarded as the best or most accurate estimate. The SWAG is not computed or proven rigorously, but the proponent asserts his or her own judgement suffices to rationalize the estimate; and it may, in time, be viable to produce a rigorous forecast of increased precision. Various other backronyms of SWAG have been published, including \\"sophisticated wild-ass guess\\", \\"Silly Wild-Ass Guess\\", \\"Semi-Wild-Ass Guess\\", \\"Stupid Wild- Ass Guess\\", and \\"Scientific Wildly Aimed Guess\\". \\"Scientific\\" implies that the \\"guess\\" can be justified if necessary or cost-effective. A guess of lesser worth may be called the \\"Wild-Ass Guess\\" or \\"WAG\\". A slightly better estimate may be called \\"Back of the Envelope\\" (BOTE).

Its rock art gallery has the largest collection of prehistoric paintings displayed in India dating from 14,000 B.C to 2000 B.C. The museum, using solar power system, has become the first museum in the country to become self-reliant in power generation. History A museum was originally set up in Allahabad in 1863 by North-West Province Governor General Sir William Muir, before being shut down for unspecified reasons in 1881. After the initiative to reopen the museum was taken by Jawaharlal Nehru, the then President of the Allahabad Municipal Board, stalwarts like Madan Mohan Malviya and the then leading newspaper The Pioneer, the museum was eventually opened in the Municipal Board building in 1931. Due to space constraint, the museum was shifted to the present building at the Alfred Park. The foundation stone of the present museum building was laid on 14 December 1947 by Jawaharlal Nehru and the museum was opened to the public in 1954.

The poet also draws on the traditions of Greek mythology so that he may approach current Cyrpriot political events.\\" \\"In his more mature books ...

PFF produces 0-100 Player Grades and a range of advanced statistics for teams and players by watching, charting and grading every player on every play in every game both at the NFL and FBS level. History PFF was founded by Neil Hornsby in the United Kingdom. Dissatisfied with some limitations of standard statistics, Hornsby began grading players in 2004. The staff gradually expanded over the next few years, and the site was launched in 2007. The 2006 NFL season is the first season for which PFF has complete data. For the 2011 season, PFF provided customized data to three NFL teams, agents, media and NFL players. In 2014, sports commentator and former NFL player Cris Collinsworth bought a majority interest in the service, which moved its operations to Cincinnati, near where Collinsworth lives in Ft. Thomas, Kentucky. PFF began collecting data for every NCAA Division-I college football game in 2014. As of 2019, PFF provides customized data to all 32 NFL teams, 74 NCAA FBS teams, 4 CFL teams, national/regional media (i.e. Washington Post, The Athletic, ESPN) and sports agencies/agents. Grades PFF grades every NFL player on every play on a scale of -2 to +2 using half point increments. The grades are based on context and performance. A four-yard run that gains a first down after two broken tackles will receive a better grade than a four- yard run on 3rd & 5, where the ball carrier does nothing more than expected. A quarterback who makes a good pass that a receiver tips into the arms of a defender will not negatively affect the quarterback's grade on that play, despite the overall negative result for the team. Furthermore, grades are separated by play type. Beyond just an overall grade, an offensive lineman receives one grade for pass-blocking and one for run-blocking. The average grade is meant to be zero, and raw grades are normalized. In watching every game, PFF is also able to record information and create data that is typically unavailable. One example is how frequently individual offensive linemen yield pressure.  Advanced Statistics  PFF covers every player on every play of every game at the NFL and major college football level and creates advanced stats based on the information gleaned from this. Criticism PFF has been criticized by the analytics community regarding the accuracy and veracity of its ratings. In contrast to the purely quantitative ratings released by sources like Football Outsiders, TeamRankings, and numberFire, PFF uses qualitative and opinion-based grading as the root of its 0-100 Player Grades -- not its advanced statistics. As such, the 0-100 Player Grades are not truly quantitative and could be seen as being prone to bias, poor sample sizing, or other issues.

Involving violent assaults on Filipino American farm workers by local residents opposed to immigration, the riots highlighted the racial and socioeconomic tensions in California's agricultural communities.De Witt 1979, p. 290. Background =Internal migration= As U.S. nationals, Filipinos had the legal right to work in the United States, and as early as 1906 they were working on Hawaii's sugar and pineapple plantations as full-time laborers. Assuming the Filipino workers' unfamiliarity with their rights, employers paid sakadas the lowest wages among all ethnic laborers; and Filipinos were introduced as strikebreakers as part of a divide and rule strategy to prevent cross-ethnic mobilization and thereby ensure smooth production processes .Filipino Migration to the United States, University of Hawaii The Immigration Acts of 1917 and 1924, which targeted non-whites of Asian descent, allowed Filipinos to answer the growing demand for labor on the U.S. mainland. From the 1920s on, \\"overwhelmingly young, single, and male\\"Lee and Yung 2011, p. 276. Filipinos migrated to the Pacific Coast, joining Mexicans in positions previously filled by Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, and Indians.Guerin-Gonzales 1994, p. 22. In California, Filipinos were the dominant Asian farm labor force during the next two decades.Lee and Yung 2011, p. 278. =Farm life= Filipino laborers' resilience in harsh working conditions made them favorite recruits among farm operators. In California's Santa Clara and San Joaquin Valleys, Filipinos were often assigned to the backbreaking work of cultivating and harvesting asparagus, celery, and lettuce. As in Hawaii, the industry and perceived passivity of these \\"little brown brothers\\" were used to counter the so-called \\"laziness\\" of working-class whites and other ethnic groups.Baldoz 2011, p. 67. Due to gender bias in immigration policy and hiring practices, of the 30,000 Filipino laborers following the cycle of seasonal farm work, only 1 in 14 were women.San Juan, Jr. 2000, p. 125. Unable to meet Filipinas, Filipino farm workers sought the companionship of women outside their own ethnic community, which further aggravated mounting racial discord. Mounting tensions In the next few years, white men decrying the takeover of jobs and white women by Filipinos resorted to vigilantism to deal with the \\"third Asiatic invasion.\\" Filipino laborers frequenting pool halls or attending street fairs in Stockton, Dinuba, Exeter, and Fresno risked being attacked by nativists threatened by the swelling labor pool as well as the Filipino's presumed predatory sexual nature.Lee and Yung 2010, p. 280. In October 1929, Filipinos at a street carnival in Exeter were shot with rubber bands as they walked with their white female companions. In response to the knifing of a heckler, a mob of 300 white men led by then Chief of Police C. E. Joyner burned the barn of a rancher known to hire Filipinos; and Joyner ordered the shutdown of a nearby labor camp. According to local press, the riot was caused primarily by Filipinos' insistence on equal treatment by white women.De Witt 1979, p. 294. Two months later, in the morning of December 2, 1929, in Watsonville, a coastal town 189 miles (304 km) away, police raided a boardinghouse and found two white girls, aged 16 and 11, sleeping in the same room with Perfecto Bandalan, a 25-year-old lettuce grower. The Watsonville community was outraged and remained so even after learning that Bandalan and 16-year-old Esther Schmick were engaged, and that they were caring for Esther's sister Bertha at her mother's request.Baldoz 2011, pp. 124-125. Riots Near midnight on January 18, 1930, 500 white men and youths gathered outside a Filipino dance club in the Palm Beach section of Watsonville. The club was owned by a Filipino man and offered dances with the nine white women who lived there. The mob came with clubs and weapons intending to take the women out and burn the place down. The owners threatened to shoot if the rioters persisted, and when the mob refused to leave, the owners opened fire. Police broke up the fight with gas bombs. Two days later, on January 20, a group of Filipino men met with a group of white men near the Pajaro River bridge to settle the score. A group of Hispanic men then arrived and took sides with the whites. The riot began and continued for five days. Hunting parties were organized; the white mob was run like a \\"military\\" operation with leaders giving orders to attack or withdraw. They dragged Filipinos from their homes and beat them. They threw Filipinos off the Pajaro River bridge. They ranged up the San Juan road to attack Filipinos at the Storm and Detlefsen ranches; at Riberal's labor camp, twenty-two Filipinos were dragged out and beaten almost to death. A Chinese apple-dryer that employed Filipinos was demolished; shots were fired into a Filipino home on Ford Street; and 22-year- old Fermin Tobera died after being shot in the heart when he was hiding in a closet with 11 others, trying to avoid the rounds of bullets fired at a bunkhouse in Murphy Ranch in San Juan Road on the 23rd. The police in Watsonville, led by Sheriff Nick Sinnott, gathered as many Filipinos as they could rescue and guarded them in the City Council's chamber while Monterey County Sheriff Carl Abbott secured the Pajaro side of the river against further riot. Aftermath The violence spread to Stockton, San Francisco, San Jose, and other cities. A Filipino club was blown up in Stockton, and the blast was blamed on the Filipinos themselves. In Gilroy, masked men warned a Japanese farmer to discharge his Filipinos. Fifty unemployed whites and Filipinos were hustled out of town by police, trying to preempt possible fighting. Many Filipinos fled the country. News of the riots spread to the Philippines, where there were protests in solidarity. The body of Fermin Tobera was sent to the Philippines, where he is considered a martyr, a symbol of the Filipinos' fight for independence and equality. The five days of the Watsonville riots had a profound impact on California's attitude toward imported Asian labor. As a result, Filipino immigration plummeted, and while they remained a significant part of the labor in the fields, they began to be replaced by Mexicans. Yet, seven months after the Watsonville riots, Filipino lettuce pickers carried out a successful strike in Salinas for better treatment. These strikes were repeated again in the Salinas Lettuce Strike of 1934 and in 1936. In addition, although their relationships were frowned upon, white women and Filipino men continued to meet and marry. In September 4, 2011, California apologized to Filipinos and Filipino Americans in an Assembly resolution authored by Assemblyman Luis Alejo, D-Salinas. \\"Filipino Americans have a proud history of hard work and perseverance,\\" Alejo said in a statement. \\"California, however, does not have as proud a history regarding its treatment of Filipino Americans. For these past injustices, it's time that we recognize the pain and suffering this community has endured.\\" Notes References *Baldoz, Rick (2011).

Background  Simmons grew up in East London and then East Lincolnshire until the age of 12. He studied physical geography (BSc) and holds a PhD from the University of London (early 1960s) on the vegetation history of Dartmoor.Preface, Simmons IG. 2003. The moorlands of England and Wales: an environmental history 8000 BC to AD 2000. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. He began university lecturing in his early 20s and was Lecturer and then Reader in Geography at the University of Durham from 1962 to 1977, then Professor of Geography at the University of Bristol from 1977 to 1981 before returning to a Chair in Geography at Durham, where he worked until retiring in 2001. In 1972‚Äì73, he taught biogeography for a year at York University, Canada and has held other appointments including Visiting Scholar, St. Johns College, University of Oxford in the 1990s. Previously, he had been an ACLS postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkeley.  Scholarship  His research includes the study of the later Mesolithic and early Neolithic in their environmental setting on English uplands, where he has demonstrated the role of these early human communities in initiating some of Britain's characteristic landscape elements. His work also encompasses the long-term effects of human manipulation of the natural environment and its consequences for resource use and environmental change. This line of work resulted in his last three books, which looked at environmental history on three nested scales: the moorlands of England and Wales, Great Britain, and the Globe. Each dealt with the last 10,000 years and tried to encompassboth conventional science-based data with the insights of the social sciences and humanities. Simmons has authored several books on environmental thought and culture over the ages as well as contemporary resource management and environmental problems.

In its time, the track was renowned nationwide and was considered by some to be second only to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Notable racers such as Barney Oldfield, Eddie Rickenbacker, Ralph DePalma, and both Louis and Gaston Chevrolet, were drawn to race for purses of up to $25,000 (approximately $573,000 in 2012 dollars). Before long, the track acquired a reputation for being dangerous. After an arson fire destroyed the wooden grandstands in 1920, the facility was rebuilt but failed financially and racing ended two years later. The site later became an airport and then a naval supply depot during World War II, and today is occupied by the campus of Clover Park Technical College and neighboring commercial sites in Lakewood, Washington. Beginnings 1912‚Äì1914 In 1912, a group of businessmen formed the Tacoma Carnival Association and created a dirt race course roughly bounded by today's Lakeview Avenue, Steilacoom Boulevard, Gravelly Lake Drive and S.W. 112th Street. This course was reduced in size for each of the next two years and became the final layout in 1914. On July 4 of that year, over 35,000 spectators came out to see racing, Vaudeville acts and fireworks. In 1915, the dirt track was upgraded to a wood track with turns banked up , using 2 million board feet (4,720 m3) of lumber and 15 tons (14,000 kg) of nails. At the time of construction, it was one of just eleven wood tracks in the United States. Promoters claimed it would be one of the fastest race tracks, if not the fastest, in the nation. Heydays 1915‚Äì1920 Three major races were held on the brand new track in 1915, the most important of which was the 250-mile (400 km) Montamarathon Classic on July 4, won by Glover Ruckstell driving a Mercer. That day also saw the track's first racer fatalities (spectators had been killed in 1912 and 1914), when a car carrying Billy Carlson and his riding mechanic left the track after incurring a punctured tire. Carlson was one of several drivers who had urged the track be paved with creosoted wood blocks instead of split boards, for safety reasons. One other driver died at the track in 1917, also due to a puncture. A map of Tacoma Speedway as it was rebuilt following an arson fire in 1920. In time, it was realized that the nature of the track's construction was problematic. Other board tracks were constructed with continuous wood surfaces, but in Tacoma the boards were spaced apart to save on materials. The gaps between the boards were filled with gravel, and there were constant problems with flying gravel and splinters, which caused many injuries, flat tires and accidents. Two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Tommy Milton once said, ‚ÄúDriving on the boards was always terrible, and then there was Tacoma.‚Äù Speaking about the board tracks of the period, veteran driver and riding mechanic Eddie Miller said: > \\"You used to get hit with some terrific blocks and knots of wood. We all > came in with pieces of wood bigger than kitchen matches driven into our face > and foreheads. They'd go in, hit the bone and then spread out. Then you had > to remove them, of course. Tacoma was worse. You had the splinters and knots > and all, but to save on lumber they had spaced out the 2x4s and caulked them > with some mixture of tar and crushed rock. When Tacoma began to go it was > like a meteor shower.\\" Race promoters often added sideshow attractions and staged exhibitions to help draw paying spectators. One such event in 1916 involved the head-on collision of two locomotives on a mile (1.6 km) of railroad track temporary laid in the race course infield. Although World War I put a damper on auto racing across much of the country, and briefly stopped it altogether in October 1918, the sport was not significantly interrupted in Tacoma. As a show of patriotism, in 1918 and 1919 races were run with cars flying the flags of Allied nations. Former-racer-turned-war-hero Eddie Rickenbacker returned in 1919 to serve as a race official.

In March 1920, the speedway's grandstands were destroyed in an arson fire. Though the loss was uninsured, funds to rebuild were raised by selling bonds, and new grandstands were constructed in time for racing that summer. The rebuilt facility was a major upgrade from the one that burned down, with of covered seating, new fencing, pedestrian tunnels, and an automobile bridge over Turn 4 that allowed spectator parking in the infield. Despite the improved facilities, the track lost money and was unable to continue operations after the race on July 4, 1922, which was the only race held that year. The original Tacoma Montamarathon Trophy is currently kept at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum. In 1927, part of the property became Mueller-Harkins Airport, then later, Tacoma Municipal Airport. The U.S. federal government seized the airport for use in World War II as the Pacific Naval Advance Base, and the site became Clover Park Technical College in 1962. Track record The best known lap speed at Tacoma Speedway was set in July 1922 during time trials for what would be the track's final race, when the top nine qualifiers all exceeded . By way of comparison, Jimmy Murphy's pole speed at the Indianapolis 500 that year was . Murphy qualified for the middle of the front row at Tacoma; the pole sitter and presumed record-holder is Tommy Milton, who won at Indianapolis in 1921 and 1923. Barney Oldfield is said to have been clocked at on the speedway in 1915, but it is unclear if this was a lap speed (unlikely) or if it was over a shorter measured distance.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 11, 2012. This was the 200th episode produced and was promoted as such, but was the 192nd episode broadcast. In the episode, Brian uses Stewie's time machine to hook up with potential girlfriends but it goes awry when he causes time to run backwards and he has to find a way to reverse it. Plot When Brian attempts to score a date at a bar, he gets a girl to come to his house, claiming he has a time machine. They sneak into Stewie's room and use the time machine to travel to the assassination of Abraham Lincoln (which is heckled by Statler and Waldorf, until Statler is also shot). Brian uses this tactic to score other dates, traveling to events such as the Hindenburg disaster (where Brian makes out with a girl as the Hindenburg crashes to the ground) and segregation-era America. However, when one of his dates points out the \\"years traveled\\" gauge on the time machine, Brian realizes Stewie might discover what he's been doing; to avoid this, he sets the \\"years traveled\\" gauge backward, which causes the time machine to have a complete meltdown and a bright blue light to emerge. Stewie wakes up to see this and Brian claims Meg is responsible, before an enormous energy blast blows Stewie and Brian against the wall, knocking them unconscious. The next morning, the two awake to discover that Brian's tampering with the machine has caused time to run backward. Brian and Stewie go around town, examining the effects of the machine, witnessing events running backwards, such as a fight between Peter and Ernie the Giant Chicken (after Peter had opened his car door when Ernie crashed his bicycle into it). After noticing that Cleveland is back living in Quahog, it becomes apparent that reverse time is starting to accelerate. Even worse, when Stewie sees that he is un-teething, he realizes the reversed timeline is beginning to affect them as well, and they are also reliving the ipecac incident in reverse, When they see that Bonnie is pregnant and that Susie has been \\"unborn\\", Stewie realizes he too will be unborn if the time machine isn't fixed. Shortly after Stewie repairs the time machine, he suddenly loses the ability to walk and realizes the time of his birth is growing near. When Stewie is going to be taken to the hospital to be unborn, he tells Brian it is now up to him to fix the machine. When Brian tries to set time forward again, he gets the idea to do the opposite of what he did the first time ‚Äì he sets the time gauge forward, causing a second meltdown which again knocks him unconscious. Brian wakes up to see that the timeline has been restored and rushes to the hospital just in time to witness Stewie's birth, where it shows that Brian was inadvertently responsible for Stewie getting his name. Stewie thanks Brian for saving his life and the Griffins head home with their newborn baby. As the episode ends, Chris' voice is heard over the credits telling the family that he heard Stewie talk, which Lois disregards. Reception The episode received a 2.7 rating and was watched by a total of 5.57 million people. This made it the second most watched show on Animation Domination that night, beating Bob's Burgers but losing to The Simpsons with 6.86 million. The episode was met with positive reviews from critics. Sonia Saraiya of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C, saying \\"Family Guy keeps delivering riffs on more of the same. It‚Äôs cold product. I‚Äôm not saying it wasn‚Äôt fun while it lasted, but I‚Äôm more or less over it. And if this episode is any indication, it‚Äôs beginning to seem like Family Guy is over itself, too.\\" Carter Dotson of TV Fanatic gave the episode four out of five stars, saying \\"It feels like the writing is on point, with a focused story to tell, yet there's something different about the feel of it. These episodes may be gimmicky in a way, but there's a purpose behind them that drives them to be better. I'd love to see more of this. Not knowing what's next, and seeing the humor that comes out of when the show does something unexpected is just plain refreshing, and I‚Äôm glad to see that the show can still be really good... 200 episodes later.\\" References External links 2012 American television episodes Family Guy (season 11) episodes Television episodes about time travel ","title":"Yug Ylimaf"},{"id":"36497009","text":"The Sakaleona Falls are the highest waterfalls of Madagascar, with a height of .www.travelmadagascar.org They are situated on the Sakaleona River in the Vatovavy-Fitovinany region, some from the village of Ampasinambo and about from Nosy Varika.

It is an important literary and artistic manifestation of the Hassaniya language and was, in 2011, added to the UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage List.  Origins  The T‚Äôheydinn dates back to the 17th century and contains dozens of poems that praise the exploits of Moorish emirs and sultans and narrates events and traditions that trace the social, cultural and historical evolution of the Moors. The T'heydinn talk of the intermingling of the two main elements of Moorish society today, the Beni Hassan, the descendants of the Beni Hilal who migrated from the Arabian peninsula, and the Sanhaja, the ancient Berber inhabitants of Mauritania. It is performed by griots (or iggawen in Hassaniya) who are singers who have acquired their art by directly imitating the musical talents of their ancestors.Nomination File No. 00524 for Inscription on the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in need of Urgent Safeguarding in 2011. UNESCO, 2011.  Griots  The T'heydinn is an oral history of each Moorish tribe which is recited and handed down the generations by the tribe's griots through music and poetry. In traditional Moorish society, each tribe maintained its griots on a gabdh, a kind of lifelong annual pension. Changes in lifestyle have meant this no longer the case and the T'heydin is today an endangered oral culture. Most of the griots today are elderly, with rapidly diminishing numbers and very few youngsters show an interest in taking up the griots lifestyle. The T'heydin is an oral tradition that is handed down the generations through the imitation of the musical talents of the ancestors and is performed on festive occasions with musical accompaniment. The griots live in all regions of Mauritania, although some regions are better known for their griot families. The regions of Hodh, Tagant-Assaba, Trarza-Brakna and Adrar are particularly well known for its griots. The population of griots is currently estimated to stand at over a thousand. The griots belong to specific families and almost form a musical caste within Mauritanian society. T‚Äôheydinn poems have also been composed by poets not belonging to such families. Griots hand down their knowledge from father to son. The father or a qualified relative initiates the young griot into playing musical instruments and later into the arts of music and poetry, culminating in his initiation into the art of the T‚Äôheydinn through recitation and mastery of the family‚Äôs own heritage. During this period of apprenticeship, the apprentice performer accompanies his father at all events, ceremonies and performances where he can turn practice and acquire new skills on the job. Every griot family guards its own T‚Äôheydinn repertoire as it distinguishes it from other griot families. A griot in possession of the whole epic is respected by all the other griot families and termed a ‚Äòbearer of the T‚Äôheydinn epic‚Äô.  Music  The T‚Äôheydinn is performed at social events such as weddings, reconciliation ceremonies and invitations. The recitation of the epic and its accompanying music provides for elaborate and sophisticated entertainment. The main musical instruments accompanying the recitation are the tidnit, a six stringed lute and the ardin, a thirteen stringed harp which are played to rouse the audience. Other musical elements employed include the tbal, a kettledrum, ululations, hand-clapping and lip vibrations (tberbir).  Role in society  The T‚Äôheydinn acts to strengthen social ties between griots and their communities and between the various communities themselves. It extols values such as honour, courage, generosity, honesty, endurance, magnanimity, rectitude and justice. It provides an opportunity for regional tribal and family reunions and promotes a culture of social peace and mutual assistance among communities based on the values it preaches.  A dying tradition  Today, most griots are old and they seldom perform even as their numbers are falling. Also these recitations no longer produce an adequate income and many young griots no longer take up the T‚Äôheydinn as a career. In recent years some griot organizations have been formed with the aim of imparting the T'heydinn to the younger generation and the Mauritanian Institute of Music has taken up the task of disseminating the art. Purists also point to how the original musical form of the T'heydinn, the faghu, is increasingly being replaced by lighter musical forms such as the liyyinn, destroying its original musical basis. Being solely an oral tradition, there are no manuals or catalogues of the T'heydinn which puts it at a greater risk of extinction.

The plot focuses on a sorority member and a group of pledges, who are stalked and murdered during their initiation ritual in a department store after hours. Filmed in Dallas, Texas in 1983, The Initiation initially had English director Peter Crane attached, though he was fired from the project early into the shoot, after which television director Stewart was hired. The Dallas Market Center and Southern Methodist University served as the primary shooting locations. The film has been noted for being star Zuniga's first leading role after her minor part in The Dorm That Dripped Blood (1982), as well as establishing a contemporary cult following as a midnight movie. Plot Since childhood, college student Kelly Fairchild has suffered from a recurring nightmare in which a strange man is burned alive in her childhood home. Hoping to unravel the meaning of the nightmare, Kelly pitches a term project idea to Peter, the graduate assistant in her psychology seminar, about it. Peter agrees to perform a sleep study on Kelly, but her mother, Frances, subsequently forbids it. Meanwhile, at a psychiatric hospital miles away, several patients escape, and a nurse is murdered. Frances is notified of this incident by phone, and informs Kelly's father, Dwight. Kelly prepares to partake in her sorority's initiation ritual which entails her and a group of other pledges breaking into her father's multilevel department store after hours and stealing the night porter's uniform. Kelly, her friend Marcia, and roommates Alison and Beth are the four main pledges. On the night of the initiation, Dwight departs for a business trip, but is brutally stabbed to death outside his car. The murderer leaves in Dwight's car with his corpse in the trunk. Just before Kelly and the other pledges arrive at the department store, the night porter is murdered while doing rounds. Beth decides to quit, leaving Kelly, Marcia, and Alison alone. The three split up, and Kelly heads to the lounge upstairs to retrieve one of the spare uniforms. Meanwhile, head sorority sister Megan lets coeds Chad, Ralph, and Andy break into the store to scare the pledges. Shortly after, Andy is killed with a hatchet and Megan is shot to death with a bow and arrow. Ralph and Chad successfully scare Kelly and Marcia by hiding in a dressing room. After uniting with Alison, all five attempt to leave the store, but are locked inside. At the university, Peter and his colleague, Heidi, comes across newspaper clippings detailing the fire Kelly described in her dream; the articles reveal the burning man's identity as Jason Randall, a floor manager at the Fairchild department store who was at one time married to Frances. Peter suspects that Jason is in fact Kelly's biological father, and that her nightmare is a memory of him being burned in an altercation with Frances' lover Dwight, who subsequently raised Kelly as his own daughter. A recent article on the inmates' revolt at the hospital reveals Jason is a groundskeeper there, and that he was among the prisoners who escaped. Peter drives to the Fairchild residence to notify Frances of his discoveries. Alison and Chad wander around the store together. While Chad is in the bathroom, Alison discovers the night porter's body, followed by Chad's corpse in a bathroom stall. A traumatized Alison locates Kelly, who instructs her to hide at a security desk on the ground floor. Kelly enters the bathroom and sees Chad's body, as well as her name written in blood on a mirror. Meanwhile, Alison is attacked at the security desk and viciously stabbed to death. Ralph and Marcia have sex in a retail display bed, before Ralph is shot dead with a harpoon gun. Marcia flees through the store, and is met by Kelly. They seek safety inside a freight elevator, but it is soon infiltrated by the killer, who drags Marcia into the elevator shaft. Kelly escapes and flees into the store's boiler room, where she encounters Jason, whom she assumes to be the killer. He pursues her to the roof, where she bludgeons him with a pipe, causing him to fall to the ground below. Peter and Frances arrive at the store and find Jason lying on the ground, clinging to life. Inside, Peter sees whom he believes to be Kelly standing in the store foyer and embraces her before she stabs him in the stomach. Kelly stumbles upon the scene and is faced with a reflection of herself: Her disturbed twin sister Terry, who has been institutionalized since childhood when Frances left their father and married Dwight, and of whom Kelly has no memory. Just as Terry is about to murder Kelly, she is shot to death by Frances. The film ends as a wounded Peter is taken away in an ambulance, while Kelly stares at her mother in disbelief. Cast Production =Concept and casting= The film marked the first leading part for Daphne Zuniga, pictured here in 2019 Screenwriter Charles Pratt Jr. wrote the script for the film after being asked to produce a low- budget horror film for producers Jock Gaynor, Bruce Lansbury, and Scott Winant for New World Pictures. According to Pratt, he initially cobbled together the concept of the sorority initiation pledge taking place within a department store, but the concept had to be reworked when the film scouts were unable to find a suitable location in Dallas available for shooting. Lead actress Daphne Zuniga was cast in the film following her minor role in the horror film The Dorm That Dripped Blood (1982), and was a student at the University of California, Los Angeles at the time of being cast. Recalling the experience, she said: \\"It was a great part. I got to play twins: a good sister and an evil sister. I got shot in the back on-screen. It was pretty heavy for a first role.\\" The majority of the supporting cast were local actors from the Dallas- Fort Worth area, including Hunter Tylo and Joy Jones, both of whom were students at Brookhaven College. British director Peter Crane signed on to direct the project, and Vera Miles was cast as the mother of Zuniga's character after a meeting with Crane. =Filming= The campus scenes were filmed at Southern Methodist University The Initiation was filmed on location in Fort Worth and Dallas, Texas, in the summer of 1983. Director Peter Crane began filming material on the production. Many of the early point-of-view shots in the film and the footage at the psychiatric hospital in the beginning of the film were shot by Crane. After several days of shooting, the shooting schedule had already fallen behind, and Crane was fired and replaced with Larry Stewart, who completed the rest of the film. The difference in technique and style between the two directors accounts for slight aesthetic differences from some of the film's earlier footage. The multilevel Dallas Market Center served as the location for the Fairchild department store, and the crew shot the film during evenings while the building was closed. The campus scenes were filmed at Southern Methodist University, while the dream-lab sequences were shot in an abandoned Holiday Inn hotel, where the production design had refitted a maid's closet to appear as the room.  Release  The Initiation first screened in the United States in the spring of 1984, with showings in Philadelphia beginning on April 28, 1984, and in Silver Spring, Maryland, beginning on May 12. In some midwestern cities, such as Bloomington, Illinois, it was paired as a drive-in double-feature with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). It was released several months later in Baltimore on September 7, 1984. The Los Angeles Times reported a tentative autumn release of the film in Los Angeles. In several southern U.S. cities, such as Shreveport, Pensacola, and Jackson, the film opened on December 7, 1984. The film was largely overshadowed at the U.S. box office by Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street, also released in the fall of 1984. It screened sporadically throughout the country, playing in one- or two-week runs. Although it passed the MPAA's restrictions without being cut, the British Board of Film Classification cut nearly a minute of gore from the film, specifically from Hunter Tylo's gruesome death scene. =Critical response and legacy= Joe Baltake of the Philadelphia Daily News wrote that the film was \\"convoluted, contemporary, and evil... This is a Freudian slip-of-a-horror-film, far more complex than truly frightening.\\" Rick Lyman of The Philadelphia Inquirer likened the film to its contemporary \\"sorority girl slasher movies,\\" concluding: \\"All of this is tied up in a surprise denouement that's about as surprising as, well, a knock-knock joke.\\" The Baltimore Evening Suns Lou Cedrone wrote that the film was \\"not so gory as most of the slice-and-dice genre,\\" comparing it to Friday the 13th (1980) and Sleepaway Camp (1983), but added: \\"The Initiation may be a little better than similar features, if only because it is a little less bloody.\\" In a subsequent review, Cedrone characterized the film as a \\"Friday the 13th clone,\\" and added: \\"Vera Miles and Clu Gulager are performers caught in this hapless mess.\\" Candice Russell of the South Florida Sun Sentinel awarded the film one-and-a-half out of four stars, referring to it as \\"an uncomfortable pastiche of scenes we've seen before,\\" and likened elements of it to Brian De Palma's Sisters (1973). Following the film's first DVD release in 2002, Film Threat gave it an unfavorable review, writing, \\"The Initiation is the latest forgotten horror film to receive the Anchor Bay DVD treatment, and I'd be at a loss to tell you why.\\" Film School Rejects, however, said the film \\"has all the hallmarks of being an awful movie without being an awful movie... it‚Äôs fun, and that should count for something.\\" Eric Snider, writing for Film.com in 2012, gave the film a negative review, calling it \\"a bad movie with bad ideas that are badly executed,\\" while TV Guide summarized the film as \\"boring slasher stuff,\\" noting that \\"Top-billed [Vera] Miles and [Clu] Gulager barely appear in the film, which would make a terrifically dreadful double bill with the similar The Dorm That Dripped Blood (1983), also featuring Zuniga.\\" Brian Collins, writing for the Alamo Drafthouse's film journal, Birth.Movies.Death., noted that the film \\"might be worth a look for slasher aficionados‚Äîit's far from a perfect film, but there are some unusual elements to it that give it enough personality to overcome its somewhat sluggish pace and TV movie-esque production.\\" Dread Centrals Anthony Arrigo observed in a 2016 review \\"a surprising amount of character depth on display here, more so than similar pictures of the era.\\" In Legacy of Blood: A Comprehensive Guide to Slasher Movie, writer Jim Harper called the film a \\"lackluster effort that never quite lives up to the abilities of its cast,\\" further noting: \\"Even with the soap opera ending, the film isn't entirely successful, mostly because of the terrible script. There's a wealth of unnecessary jargon and cheap dialogue, not to mention some notable inconsistencies. Zuniga does her best to rise above the bad material and turns in a great performance, but Gulager and Miles sleepwalk through their parts.\\" Horror film scholar Adam Rockoff alternately notes in his book Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film, that, \\"despite its proclivity for laughable dialogue and silly plot twists, [The Initiation] manages to be a fairly entertaining and occasionally frightening film.\\" Irrespective of the film's critical reception, it has garnered a contemporary cult following. =Home media= The film was released on VHS by Thorn EMI in the 1980s. It was released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment in 2002, and was later reissued in 2011 by Image Entertainment's \\"Midnight Madness\\" Series. In August 2016, it was revealed that Arrow Films would be releasing the film for the first time on Blu-ray in both the United States and the United Kingdom. It was released in the United States on November 8, 2016.

The nuts of most Lecythis species are edible. The name is said to derive from an old proverb, \\"a wise old monkey doesn't stick its hand into a pot\\", referring to the pot-like fruit that hold the seeds, and monkeys' eagerness to obtain the seeds. Supposedly young monkey's would stick their paw into an almost ripe fruit and would be unable to get it back out for their paws were filled with nuts, while old monkey's would learn it was better to be patient and pull out the nuts one by one. The fruit is coconut-sized, and roundish and woody, with a cap that pops off when it reaches maturity. Inside the fruit are anywhere from eight to 40 seeds, which eventually fall from the woody capsule after a period of time.  History  Because the seeds are rich in oil the plant was brought to Singapore as an experimental economic plant. Jean-Baptiste Christophore Fus√©e Aublet (1720-1778), discovered the Lecythis zabucajo during his two-year sojourn in French Guiana, where he held the office of Apothecary Botanist. He gathered material for his book, Histoire des Plantes de la Guyane Fran√ßoise (The Plant History of French Guiana), which was published in 1775.  Appearance and uses  The oil extracted from the nuts is tasteless and clear in color. In Brazil it is used for making white soap. It is also burnt as a light source. The wood is used in construction, cabinetry, and the making of tool handles and other wooden items.

It has occupied its current site on the Lane Cove River at Yacht Bay, Longueville since 1933. The club has a focus on masters, juniors and social rowing. The club conducts an annual corporate regatta and a learn-to-row program. History Sir George Dibbs, a three-time Premier of New South Wales was one of the instigators of a public meeting held in July 1879 at Milsons Point to consider the prospects of establishing a rowing club on Sydney harbour's north side. The following month at the School of Arts in St Leonards a committee was elected and an enrolment program for members was commenced. The club was the fourth senior rowing club to be formed in Sydney with only the Sydney, Mercantile and Glebe clubs in existence when North Shore came into being in 1879. The first boatshed was built on the western side of Careening Cove at the bottom of Willoughby Street and an opening ceremony took place on Saturday 15 November 1879, when a Regatta was held. The club met opposition from a local government member regarding the site it had secured and in 1890 voluntarily vacated the Willoughby Street site and moved the clubhouse to the opposite side of Careening Cove where a Mr. John Wilson owned a water frontage. By 1894, the club had 113 members and 14 boats and was considering a new and more ample boathouse site. A third location was secured in 1903 at the head of Careening Cove after the Committee negotiated a lease with the Harbour Trust. The shed was built that same year, a 65 ft by 50 ft two-storied structure, roughly twice as big as the old shed. Ferry traffic, choppy water and the site's exposure to Sydney's southerly winds made the site less than ideal for preparing racing crews and in 1929 the club built a branch clubhouse and training facility at its current location just above Longueville Wharf on the Lane Cove River. All the club's activities were transferred to this shed in 1937 and it has operated from there since. Club presidents * Spencer Grace was club president for over two decades retiring in 1998 aged 91. * Sue Wannan was the club president in 2012. Members Olympic representative members include: * Spencer Grace OAM (1907‚Äì1999) competed at London 1948 in the coxless pair with Ted Bromley. He was captain of the club from 1934 to 1939 and its President till 1988. * Maurice Grace and Peter Raper raced the Australian coxless pair at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics and placed fourth. Notable past members include: * Ted Bromley (1912‚Äì2004) was a Mosman Rowing Club member when he competed at London 1948 in the coxless pair and for many years after but he rowed with Spencer Grace from North Shore later in life and was keen supporter of the club. * Doug Bowden coxed, coached and administered at the club from the 1930s through to the 1960s. He was a competitive member when he coxed two New South Wales King's Cup victories and steered the Australian eight to a silver medal at the 1938 British Empire Games. * Frank Lowy AC is a member of the club and donated an eight in 1994.

Built in 1951, the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. From the 1940s to the 1960s, the faculty of the North Carolina State College School of Design included several modernist architects, including G. Milton Small, FAIA (1916-1992). Small had studied under Mies van der Rohe at the Illinois Institute of Technology before moving to Raleigh in 1948. He designed the Small House as his own family residence. Small used builder Frank Walser to construct the house. Small went into business with Walser for a time, building homes in the Drewry Hills neighborhood of Raleigh. In its original from, the Small House was \\"a compact T-shaped, flat-roofed frame box.\\" Most of the home's public living spaces were combined in \\"one long, carefully proportioned rectangular room that opened with sliding doors onto a full-width, screened porch.\\" The interior included a variety of exotic woods. A number of the home's design elements, including \\"the definition of space as roof and floor separated by exposed posts, and the large public area that opens onto semi-outdoor spaces,\\" are considered to be typical of the Miesian style. The Raleigh Historic Development Commission has called Small House \\"the first structure in Raleigh to evoke the design concepts of Mies.\\" A 1961 addition was designed by Small, adding bedrooms to the sides of the house and separate living and dining rooms.

They are medium-sized nocturnal birds with long pointed wings, short legs and short bills. Antrostomus nightjars are found in the New World, and like other nightjars they usually nest on the ground. They are mostly active in the late evening and early morning or at night, and feed predominantly on moths and other large flying insects. Most have small feet, of little use for walking, and their soft plumage is cryptically coloured to resemble bark or leaves. They have relatively long bills and rictal bristles. Some species, unusually for birds, perch along a branch, rather than across it, which helps to conceal them during the day. Temperate species are strongly migratory, wintering in the tropics. Many have repetitive and often mechanical songs. These species were formerly placed in the genus Caprimulgus but were moved to the resurrected genus Antrostomus based on the results of a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010. The genus Antrostomus was erected by the French naturalist Charles Bonaparte in 1838 with the chuck-will's-widow (Antrostomus carolinensis) as the type species. The generic name combines the Ancient Greek antron meaning \\"cavern\\" and stoma meaning \\"mouth\\". Species The genus contains 12 species: *Chuck-will's-widow Antrostomus carolinensis *Rufous nightjar, Antrostomus rufus *Cuban nightjar, Antrostomus cubanensis *Hispaniolan nightjar, Antrostomus ekmani *Tawny-collared nightjar, Antrostomus salvini *Yucatan nightjar, Antrostomus badius *Buff-collared nightjar, Antrostomus ridgwayi *Eastern whip-poor-will, Antrostomus vociferus *Mexican whip-poor-will, Antrostomus arizonae *Dusky nightjar, Antrostomus saturatus *Puerto Rican nightjar, Antrostomus noctitherus *Silky-tailed nightjar, Antrostomus sericocaudatus References Bird genera ","title":"Antrostomus"},{"id":"36498202","text":"Alexander Mitchell (July 27, 1912 - July 26, 2003) was a farmer and political figure in Saskatchewan.

He lives in Kandamanoor, near Madurai. Murugesan and Arivazhagan are Sundarapandian's close friends from the same town. Arivu had failed in his board exams twice and is now in college final year, while Sundarapandian completed college two years ago and is now living freely. Arivu falls in love with Archana, who lives in a small village near Usilampatti and sees daily on the bus from Madurai to Theni. Arivu is scared to propose his love and decides to get the help of Sundarapandian in expressing love. Sundarapandian, Murugesan, and Arivu board the route bus daily in which Archana travels to her college. Bhuvaneshwaran also loves Archana and travels in the same bus, also trying to propose to her. There arises a clash between Arivu and Bhuvanesh. They resolve it, as Bhuvanesh's native close friend is Sundarapandian's classmate Paranjothi. They give Bhuvanesh 31 days to woo Archana, without any of them intervening, failing which he should not disturb her anymore ever. Bhuvanesh fails and seemingly leaves way for Arivu. There, it is revealed that three years ago, Sundarapandian had proposed to Archana and she had rejected him. Upon Arivu's urging, Sundarapandian goes to Archana to give his proposal. The next day, Archana suddenly proposes to Sundarapandian, which shocks everyone. Archana likes Sundarapandian and was waiting to meet him to convey her love towards him. Arivu accepts to leave his love, and Sundarapandian accepts Archana, but her parents wanted her to marry their close relative Jegan, although she is not interested. Archana had asked Sundarapandian not to contact her as she has exams coming. Bhuvanesh uses this time and verbally harasses Archana in the bus. Sundarapandian catches him and warns him not to repeat it. Sundarapandian asks Bhuvanesh to stop following Archana. The next day, Bhuvanesh comes with two of his friends and again insults Archana. Sundarapandian and his friends board the bus halfway, and a clash erupts between Sundarapandian and Bhuvanesh while travelling in the bus. Suddenly, Bhuvanesh is pushed out of the moving bus, which leads to his death. Sundarapandian is arrested for the murder but gets bailed from the case as it was termed as an accident.

Meanwhile, Archana's parents try to force her to marry Jegan. Raghupathi comes to Archana's home with a marriage proposal between Archana and Sundarapandian. Raghupathi requests Archana's father Pandi to set aside the ego and fulfill his daughter's wish by getting her married to Sundarapandian.

She competed at the first Summer Youth Olympic Games. Vinsant also represented the United States at the 2012 Summer Olympics. She became the first ever U.S. trampoline athlete to qualify for the finals. Savannah finished sixth place during the trampoline finals. She was the youngest female trampoline competitor at the games. Early life Vinsant's parents are Neil and Ramonda Vinsant. Savannah Vinsant began gymnastics in 2000. She had always lived in cities that had trampoline gyms. However, when her family moved, in 2005, to Newton that changed. Her family drove her a constant back-and-forth trips to practices in Orange and Lafayette, La. until it became too much. It seemed as though at this point Vinsant's trampoline career would likely end, just shortly after it had started. \\"We didn't think she was going to bounce again,\\" said her father. Savannah made it quite clear that she was not going to take giving up the sport quietly. \\"I hate y'all. I hate y'all for making me quit,\\" Ramonda recalled Savannah telling her during one heated argument. The parents, who had taken courses in judging and coaching, began training Savannah on their own. They trained her on a 7-by-14-foot competition trampoline (a rectangular trampoline with a different bed than regular outdoor trampolines) ‚Äì in their backyard. Soon roughly 40 children began coming to Savannah's house and joined her with her practices. Her parents then offered to build a gym in their front yard. In 2007, Vinsant filled out an application to attend the U.S. Olympic Training Center without her parents' permission. She called her mother from Newton High School and told her she was sick and her parents would need to get her now. Her mother took her home from school, where the then 14-year-old Savannah received a call from the Olympic Training Center saying she was a few years too young to attend. Vinsant lived in Newton from the time she was 10 until one month before her 16th birthday, when she left home to train for the Olympics. The gym now is the headquarters for more than 200 aspiring trampolinists. Journey to the Olympics =London qualification= On November 21, 2011 in Birmingham, England, Vinsant finished tenth at the 2011 World Trampoline and Tumbling Championships with a score of 98.445. With her performance, she advanced to the women's individual trampoline final and secured a spot for the U.S. team at the next summer's 2012 Olympic Games in London. Although Vinsant's scores qualified the United States for an Olympic spot, she still had to compete in a series of qualification competitions to earn her place to represent the United States at the Olympics. Savannah won all three of the qualification competitions securing her spot easily. \\"I'm speechless ‚Äì I have no words for it\\", was her reaction upon being named to the Olympic team, \\"I'm filled with joy and I'm at peace that it's over. I had a big group of girls out there with me this year who were awesome, and they definitely kept me on my toes all year. I'm honored to be representing Team USA.\\" =London 2012= Vinsant competed on August 4, 2012 at the London Olympics. She was the youngest competitor of the female field. In the compulsory round, she scored a 46.400 for her routine that included a half in Rudy out and would be standing in 11th place. However, Vinsant's second routine, her optional routine, would score a 54.955, which moved her to seventh place in the prelims with a total score of 101.355. This would grant her one of the eight places in the finals competition on the same day. Vinsant became the first U.S. trampolinist to qualify to the finals at an Olympic Games. \\"I wanted to make finals, but overall I just wanted to do 20 skills,\\" she said. \\"Making it to finals in seventh, I was shocked actually‚Äì I thought that was a pretty high standard for me to reach.\\" During the finals portion of the competition, Vinsant's routine featured a Triffus tuck, half Rudi tuck, full in Rudi out straight, double back pike, Rudi out pike, half in half out pike, full Brani pike, half half tuck, half out pike and full full pike. She scored a 54.965 and finished sixth. Vinsant said of her overall performance in London, \\"I was very pleased with all of my performances today. This gives me a lot of confidence. I was the youngest competitor here and making finals really hit the pace for me. I will work to get my difficulty, time of flight and execution better so that I can be up in the medals at the next Olympics.\\" Accomplishments =Business= *In 2015, Savannah Vinsant Thompson launched Hangtime TNT Gymnastics, LLC., a trampoline and tumbling gymnastics club and cheerleading academy. In 2017, Coach Savannah's team had their first national champion and regional champions. All 2017 Hangtime TNT athletes became a State Champion in one of the three trampoline and tumbling events at the State Championships held in Lafayette, LA. Savannah is also very proud of her recreational program as it has grown and became very successful. She is able to give children something they will never forget at Hangtime TNT. Hangtime TNT is more than a gym, it is an experience children will remember forever. Savannah's dream was to own her own gym and become a positive role model for the youth. =School= *2014 SLCC Associate of General Studies Degree *2007 Student of the Year *Class of 2010 Valedictorian =Trampoline= National results * 2018 USA Gymnastics Trampoline Championships, Greensboro, North Carolina - 1st- TR *2013 U.S. T&T; Championships, Kansas City, Mo. - 4th-TR * 2013 U.S. Elite Challenge, Frisco, Texas - 1st-TR; 2nd-SY * 2012 USA Gymnastics Trampoline Championships, San Jose, Calif. ‚Äì 1st-TR *2012 Stars & Stripes Cup, Cleveland, Ohio ‚Äì 1st-TR *2012 Elite Challenge, Tulsa, Okla. ‚Äì 1st-TR; 2nd-SY *2011 U.S. Elite Championships, San Antonio, Texas ‚Äì 1st-TR *2011 U.S. Elite Challenge, Fort Worth, Texas ‚Äì 1st-SY; 6th-TR *2011 Winter Classic, Houston, Texas ‚Äì 8th-TR *2010 Visa Championships, Hartford, Conn. ‚Äì 6th-TR *2010 U.S. Elite Challenge, Virginia Beach, Va. ‚Äì 3rd-TR *2010 Fairland Classic, Laurel, Md. ‚Äì 1st-TR *2009 Final Selection Event, Las Vegas, Nev. ‚Äì 1st-TR, SY (15‚Äì16) (Jr. Div.) *2009 Visa Championships, Dallas, Texas ‚Äì 2nd-TR; 6th-SY (Jr. Div.) *2009 U.S. Elite Challenge, Ft.

Podhajsky has emerged as a promising photographer, with his brooding landscape photography attracting a large following through his popular Instagram and Facebook accounts. In addition to creating album art, has also created artwork for a number of record labels around the world, such as Warp Records, Modular Recordings, Sub Pop and Sony Music, with tour posters, T-shirts and other merchandise. Podhajsky's work explores themes of connectedness, love, fear, magic, the relevance of nature and the psychedelic or altered experience, and uses techniques such as pattern, recursion, balance, symmetry and repetition. By utilizing these subjects he attempts to \\"coerce the viewer into a realignment with themselves and their surroundings\\". Tame Impala Podhajsky has also worked with Australian psychedelic rock band Tame Impala on numerous occasions, creating art for their album Innerspeaker and its follow-up Lonerism, and also creating art for their singles \\"Solitude Is Bliss\\", \\"Lucidity\\", \\"Expectation\\", \\"Why Won't You Make Up Your Mind?\\", \\"Apocalypse Dreams\\" and \\"Elephant\\".

A lot of albums that have my work on them are on solid rotation. Ideally I like to spend a lot of time with the music working out a story and concept which I can capture the whole albums feel and flow.\\" Podhajsky also uses album art to \\"create one image which encompasses an entire album of story and emotion\\". Music also inspires Podhajsky in \\"not just work for record labels or bands, but across everything I do. I find it helps me turn the part of my brain that over analyses and makes things logical switch off. This helps as it lets me form compositions in a more natural and fluid way, so it felt really organic to begin creating artwork for musicians.

History The Shalimar Express was inaugurated in 1979 by the President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. The train at that time only consisted of 2 parlour coaches and had only two stops and covered the distance from Karachi to Lahore in 16 hours. Pakistan Railways suspended Shalimar Express on 27 July 2010 because it was running in loss. After 19 months of its suspension Pakistan Railways restarted it with the collaboration of a private company Air Rail Services on 24 February 2012.Reliving memories of old: Shalimar Express ready to chug on tracks again Published in The Express tribune on 25 December 2012. Retrieved on 21 July 2012 Shalimar Express currently consists of seven economy, two AC lower, one parlour car, one dining car, one power van and one luggage van coaches. The train now covers the distance from Karachi to Lahore in 19 hours. Shalimar Express was the first ever all air-conditioned train to run on the Pakistan Railway network. It consisted of 14 parlour coaches, two double capacity power vans and a dining car. The parlour coaches were manufactured in Pakistan carriage factory, through the acquisition of German rail technology. Each coach consisted of 52 reclining seats, with comfortable room space and two main televisions (that was installed in 1987). In short, the coach interiors was replicated to match that of an aeroplane. Shalimar Express got the first ever signature Pakistan Railway livery, that is used to date. It consisted of two dark green strips with a yellow middle livery, while the windows of the train were tinted black to avoid heat and sunlight to enter the coaches. For over eight years since the train's inauguration, the train had two stops along it 1263 km route between Lahore and Karachi, which were Rohri and Khanewal. The train covered its distance in 16 hours and for a few years, it even covered it in just 15 hours and 25 minutes. The train began its journey at 6:00 am both ways and reached either destination at 10:00 pm the same day. Between 1987 and 1994, Multan was also added to its stop (earlier, it used to bypass Multan by taking the Khanewal-Jahania-Lodhran route), during which the train began journey at 7:00 am either side. Initially the train was hauled by a 3000 horse power locomotive, imported from the General Motors company (EMD), United States in 1975. However, after the import of Hitachi Bombardier series from Japan in 1982, the GM engine retired and the new locomotives were put to work. Since the Hitachi engines were just 2000 HP each, two units were deployed to haul the Shalimar Express, but their poor quality led to a disruption and delay in the train service causing agitation among the passengers. Later in 1985, new EMD locomotives were imported, this time manufactured in the Henschel factory in Germany, that were used to pull the Shalimar Express.

The brewery produces Angkor Beer (the most widely consumed beer in the country and acknowledged as Cambodia‚Äôs national beer), Klang Beer, Bayon Beer, Angkor Extra Stout and Black Panther Premium Stout. History The original brewery, known as SKD Brewery (Soci√©t√© des Khmere Distilleries) was commissioned by the Cambodian Government in the early 1960s and built by a French contractor with technical assistance from France. The brewery was officially opened by HRH Prince Sihanouk in 1965. The brewery building was designed by Cambodia architect Vann Molyvann during the 'golden period' of New Khmer Architecture. The main office building follows the distinctive 'dong raik' architectural design form in which the upper floor overhangs the ground floor by several metres, highlighted and reflected in the shape of the distinctive triangle supports in the facade. Sihanoukville was chosen as the site for the brewery for the quality of the local water which supposedly had the ideal mineral content for brewing beer. The choice of Sihanoukville was not without controversy at the time due to the distance from the bottle manufacturing plant near Phnom Penh. The brewery produced lager beer, marketed under the brand names Angkor Beer and Bayon Beer. The brewery's operations were disrupted when civil war broke out in the early 1970s and closed in 1975. In 1991 Cambrew Ltd (a Malaysian company) assumed control of the brewery and after nine months of refurbishment, the brewery recommenced production in 1992. In 1992 Cambrew entered into a joint venture with PepsiCo for bottling and distribution of soft drinks in Cambodia. In 2005 the Carlsberg Group purchased a 50% holding in the brewery. In 2011 the Angkor Extra Stout was awarded the Grand Gold award from Monde Selection of Belgium.

He was a moderate performer on the flat, winning one minor race from fourteen attempts. He showed considerable improvement when switched to hurdling winning several important races including the Irish Champion Hurdle at Leopardstown and the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham. He later had some success as a steeplechaser, but was increasingly affected by respiratory problems and was retired from racing in 2001. Background Collier Bay was a dark-coated bay horse with a small white star, bred by his owner, Lord Derby's Stanley Stud. He was sired by the July Cup winner Green Desert whose other offspring include Desert Prince, Sheikh Albadou and Cape Cross, the sire of Sea the Stars. Collier Bay's dam, Cockatoo Island, was a descendant of Sun Stream, a mare who won the 1000 Guineas and Epsom Oaks for a former Earl of Derby in 1945. Collier Bay was originally sent into training with the leading flat trainer John Gosden at Stanley House Stables in Newmarket, England. Racing career =1992-1993: flat racing career= Collier Bay began his racing career as a two-year-old in the autumn of 1992 by finishing unplaced in maiden races at Newmarket and Leicester. In the following season, he ran ten times, mainly in low grade handicap races. His only success came at Salisbury in August, when he was ridden by Frankie Dettori to a three length win in a ¬£4,000 maiden race. At the end of the season, he had an official rating of 75, approximately forty pounds below top class. In October 1993, the colt was sent to the Tattersalls sales at Newmarket. He was bought for 46,000 guineas, by the Curragh Bloodstock Agency, acting on behalf of the trainer Jim Old and his patron Wally Sturt. Collier Bay was gelded and prepared for a National Hunt career at Old's stables at Upper Herdswick Farm near Barbury Castle in Wiltshire. =1994-1998: hurdle racing= Collier Bay began his hurdling career running in Novice hurdle races in the second half of the 1993/4 season running three times and winning twice. In February he won a minor race by twenty lengths at Lingfield and the following month he won a similar event at Newton Abbot by a distance (more than thirty lengths). A brief return to the flat was unsuccessful as he finished unplaced in a handicap at Newbury. The 1994/5 season saw Collier Bay racing against more experienced hurdlers. As in the previous year, he was ridden in all his races by Tom Grantham. On his seasonal debut he was moved up in class, but finished last of the four runners behind Large Action in the Grade Two Gerry Feilden Hurdle at Newbury. Two weeks later he finished fourth in a handicap at Cheltenham and was then off the course for three months. In March, Collier Bay was sent to Sandown to contest the Imperial Cup, a handicap hurdle for which he was assigned a weight of 142 pounds. Grantham sent the gelding into a clear lead approaching the final hurdle and he pulled away to win by eleven lengths. Four days later he made his first appearance at the Cheltenham Festival and finished fourth of the thirty runners in the Coral Cup. Collier Bay did not appear again on a racecourse until January 1996. The field for the Bonusprint Handicap Hurdle at Sandown included several leading hurdlers including Oh So Risky, runner-up in the 1994 Champion Hurdle and the mare Absalom's Lady, who had won the Grade One Christmas Hurdle. Ridden for the first time by Graham Bradley, Collier Bay took the lead two hurdles from the finish and won by seven lengths at odds of 25/1. Two weeks later, Collier Bay was moved up to Grade One class for the Irish Champion Hurdle at Leopardstown in which he was matched against some of the best Irish hurdlers at level weights. Jamie Osborne tracked the leaders on Collier Bay, before moving the English gelding into the lead at the second last. He was headed by Minella Lad at the last hurdle but rallied in the closing stages to regain the lead and win by a head, with Danoli half a length back in third. Collier Bay's win was almost ignored, as the crowd and media focused their attention on the popular Danoli, who was returning after a career-threatening injury. In the Champion Hurdle, it was expected that Osborne would ride Collier Bay, with Bradley partnering the favourite and reigning champion Alderbrook. Shortly before the race, Bradley was dismissed by Alderbrook's trainer, Kim Bailey, when the jockey failed to appear to ride the horse in an exercise gallop. Bradley claimed that his alarm clock had malfunctioned on the morning after he had attended a fellow jockey's birthday party. Osborne meanwhile, had abandoned Collier Bay in favour of the Triumph Hurdle-winning mare Mysilv. The result was that Richard Dunwoody rode Alderbrook, while Bradley was booked to ride Collier Bay. Racing on soft ground, Collier Bay was the 9/1 fourth choice in the betting for the Champion Hurdle behind Alderbrook (10/11), Danoli (5/1) and Mysilv (7/1). Bradley positioned the gelding in second behind Mysilv before going into the lead at the second last hurdle: according to Bradley, Jamie Osborne \\"let me have a few expletives when he realised he had chosen the wrong one\\". Collier Bay went clear of the field and held the late challenge of Alderbrook to win by two and a half lengths. After a break of almost eleven months, during which he escaped without injury when fire swept through Jim Old's stable, Collier Bay returned in February 1997 at Towcester. He started odds-on favourite for the Champion Hurdle Trial and won by three quarters of a length from Relkeel. On his return to Cheltenham, he was made 4/1 second favourite for the Champion Hurdle, although Old was worried by the faster ground. He made no impression in the race won by Make A Stand making several jumping mistakes and being tailed off in last place when Bradley pulled him up. He did not run again in the 1996/7 National Hunt season, but finished fourth in a flat race at Haydock Park eighteen days after his poor run at Cheltenham. In his final season over hurdles, Collier Bay ran three times. He was placed in the Bula Hurdle and the Champion Hurdle Trial but missed Cheltenham and was pulled up in the Aintree Hurdle. =1998-2001: steeplechasing= In the 1998/9 National Hunt season, Collier Bay was switched from hurdles to compete over larger obstacles in Novice Chases. He had his most active campaign since the 1993 flat season, running six times and winning races at Newton Abbot and Huntingdon. He also finished second in the Grade II Reynoldstown Novices' Chase at Ascot and ran fourth behind the future Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Looks Like Trouble in the Grade I RSA Chase. Hopes that Collier Bay would develop into a top class steeplechaser however, were not fulfilled as health problems restricted him to only four races in the next two years. After being pulled up suffering breathing difficulties in a handicap chase at Newton Abbot in April 2001, he was retired from racing. Retirement Collier Bay spent his retirement in the care of Old's secretary Emma Grierson. He died in December 2017 at the age of 27. Remembering his champion Jim Old said \\"He was a street-fighting thug and would drop you as a pastime at home but as far as I‚Äôm concerned he was career defining. He was a real character and had a great retirement\\".

After Mart√≠n de Zavala had opened up the Nuevo Le√≥n region in 1626, Ugarte became Captain of the newly founded settlement of Monterrey. Ugarte was appointed Governor of New Mexico by Mat√≠as de Peralta, dean of the Audiencia of New Spain, holding office from 1649 to 1653. In 1650, he dispatched an expedition from Santa Fe, led by Captain Diego del Castillo, to explore what is now north central Texas. The expedition reached the territory of the Tejas Indians, and reported finding pearls on the Concho River. The Diego de Guadalajara expedition was launched in 1654 to follow up on Castillo's findings. In 1650, Ugarte put down an uprising among the Jemez Indians, allied with the Navajos and some of the Tigua villages, that was meant to include all the pueblos, although not all joined in. Nine of the Jemez Indians were hanged as traitors, and others were sold as slaves. Following Ugarte's governorship, the New Mexico Pueblo people became increasingly restless, resenting Spanish efforts to resettle them and convert them to Christianity, and eventually revolted and broke free of Spain in 1680.

It operates as one of two primary law enforcement agencies tasked with maintaining law and order in the province. The levies force has jurisdiction in most districts of Balochistan. History The force has its origins back in the days of the British Raj, and has continued to function for over a century. It is headed by a director-general and is mostly constituted by local security personnel, including Baloch and Pashtun officers. During the regime of Pervez Musharraf, the Balochistan Levies had been disbanded and merged into the provincial police force. It was restored in 2010. Operations Areas which are manned by and are under the control of the Levies are called \\"B-Areas\\" which constitute around 90% of the total area of Balochistan while those under the control of the Balochistan Police are dubbed \\"A-Areas\\" i.e around 10% . The levies have been praised for their efficiency and reliability compared to the police force; this is attributed to the fact that it predominantly consists of local officers who are familiar with and well accustomed to the political and law and order landscape of Balochistan, thus fulfilling the concept of community policing, whereas the police force predominantly consists of non-locals. It is also in charge of more areas as compared to the police, and yet has a lower budget, rendering it the \\"cheapest available law enforcement agency\\". However, many critics have contended that the force has been used by Baloch tribal chiefs to serve their own interests. The force has often been targeted by militants involved in the insurgency in Balochistan. In 2018 the Balochistan government embarked on a four year long levies reorganization to improve the force \\"to turn it into a professional and motivated law-enforcement agency.\\" Law enforcement in Balochistan Balochistan Police is responsible for the law and order situation in mostly urban areas only, which are called A areas. This division has been in place, in various forms, since the time of the British Raj. Balochistan's rural areas, called B areas, are policed by the Balochistan Levies. The Frontier Corps operates in both areas. This division is seen as a severe handicap by the police and Levies as criminals based outside their areas of jurisdiction can easily plan attacks and run away. The distinction was eliminated by Musharraf, however, it was brought back by the PPP government of 2008 under the Chief Minister of Balochistan Aslam Raisani. The frequent swings in policy obviously do not allow institution-building and hurt the agencies' abilities to deal with crime. Since Pakistan's post 9/11 involvement in the Global War on Terror targeted killings, kidnappings, and terrorist attacks have risen substantially. In 2013 there were several bombings targeting the Hazara community in Quetta.SATP and attacks on police including senior officials. Duties Balochistan Levies duties include but are not limited to the following: * Maintenance of law and order which includes patrolling and highway patrol, * Execution and service of judicial summons and warrants and manning gaols. * Protection of vital installations, railways tracks, bridges and culverts, buildings and railways. * Security of foreign missions and delegations. * Maintenance of law and order in Afghan refugees camps. * natural disaster response and relief. * Assist other agencies in the prevention of smuggling. * helps protect the Pakistan ‚Äì Afghanistan border. * Collection of land revenue, usher, agriculture taxes, and all kinds of loans including Bank Loans.

Bond was born in the village of Ogbourne St George, Wiltshire, the son of the Reverend Alfred Bond, the local vicar. His younger brother was Sir Reginald Bond, later medical director-general of the Royal Navy. He trained as a doctor at University of Edinburgh, graduating Bachelor of Medicine (MB) in 1892, Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Public Health in 1893, Doctor of Medicine (MD) in 1895, and Doctor of Science (DSc) that same year. He was Gaskell Gold Medallist in Mental Disorders in 1898. He then took a post at Morningside Asylum in Edinburgh, before transferring to posts at Wakefield Asylum and Banstead Asylum and then as first deputy medical superintendent of Bexley Asylum. In 1903 he was appointed first medical superintendent of Ewell Colony for Epileptics in Surrey and in 1907 he became first medical superintendent of Long Grove Asylum. He was appointed a Commissioner in Lunacy in 1912 and a commissioner at the new Board of Control for Lunacy and Mental Deficiency in 1914, remaining there until his retirement less than a month before his death in 1945. In 1930 he became one of the four senior commissioners on the board. Bond favoured voluntary admission to mental hospitals rather than certification, reforms finally introduced in the Mental Treatment Act 1930. In 1924 he and another doctor were sued by a patient for wrongful detention. They jury found for the plaintiff and awarded him the huge sum of ¬£25,000 damages. The Court of Appeal set the verdict aside and ordered a retrial (later confirmed by the House of Lords), but the plaintiff eventually settled out of court for ¬£250 damages. This contributed to changes in the law in the 1930 act. Bond was also lecturer in mental disorders at the Maudsley Hospital from 1919 to 1939, lecturing to trainee psychiatrists on mental illness and the law. He was honorary general secretary of the Royal Medico-Psychological Association from 1906 to 1912 (and president from 1921 to 1922), a member of the War Office Shell-Shock Committee from 1920 to 1922, chairman of the Departmental Committee on Nursing in County and Borough Mental Hospitals from 1922 to 1924, president of the Association of Occupational Therapists from 1937 until his death, vice-president of the Lebanon Hospital from 1937 until his death, and a member of the Central Medical War Committee from 1939 until his death. He was consultant in neurology and mental disorders to the Royal Navy from 1925 until his death. In both world wars he worked on adapting mental hospitals for military use and for this work in the First World War he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in January 1920. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1929. On 12 May 1900, Bond married Janet Constance Laurie; they had one daughter. They lived in St Annes, Lancashire. From 1925 until his death he lived at 10 Portland Place, Brighton.

Internationally famous at the time of its publication, primarily because of his 1959 Manchurian Candidate, Condon had begun to lose the respect of critics with the publication of his last few books and the one-time, so-called Condon Cult was mostly a thing of the past. Like his fifth book, An Infinity of Mirrors, Mile High is a consciously ambitious work, primarily concerned with the establishment of Prohibition in the United States, and Condon researched it thoroughly. The first two-thirds of the book, in fact, reads as much like a lively history of New York City gangsterism from the mid-18th century through 1930 as it does a novel. Mile High is a three-generational story, beginning with Paddy West, a penniless, totally amoral immigrant from Ireland who through shrewdness and brutality makes himself into the most powerful political boss in New York City; with Paddy's death in 1911 as a Tammany Hall leader, his even shrewder and more brutal son, Edward Courance West, becomes the center of the story, as, at age 20, he conceives, full-blown, a scheme for imposing Prohibition on the United States‚Äîpurely as a means of making himself an unsurpassed fortune; and finally, in 1958, with Eddie West now the richest man in the world, but also criminally insane, the story shifts to his second son, Walter, a non-criminal architect, and his beautiful new black wife‚Äîa woman that the murderous racist Eddie West intends to torture and kill. The book is divided into three parts: \\"The Minotaur\\" (the longest); \\"Theseus and Wife\\"; and \\"The Labyrinth\\". Curiously enough, it was published within a few months of a somewhat similar novel about multi-generational New York gangsters, The Godfather, by a relatively unknown author, Mario Puzo. Puzo and his book went on to worldwide renown, and while Mile High was received reasonably well, it did little to enhance Condon's reputation. This would have to wait a further two decades for his quartet of novels about the Prizzi family and its Hollywood adaptation, Prizzi's Honor. Theme In Mile High, the basic theme of all 26 of Condon's books is summed up in a single angry cri de coeur: > Prohibition fused the amateurism and catch-as-catch-can national tendencies > of the early days of the republic with a more modern, highly organized lust > for violence and the quick buck. It fused the need to massacre twelve > hundred thousand American Indians and ten million American buffalo, the > lynching bees, the draft riots, bread riots, gold riots and race riots, the > constant wars, the largest rats in the biggest slums, boxing and football, > the loudest music, the most strident and exploitative press with the entire > wonderful promise of tomorrow and tomorrow, always dragging the great nation > downward into greater violence and more unnecessary deaths, into newer and > more positive celebration of nonlife, all so that the savage, simple-minded > people might be educated into greater frenzies of understanding that power > and money are the only desirable objects for this life.Mile High, Dial > Press, New York, 1969, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 77-80497, > page 156 Critical reception Cover of the first hardback edition, published by Dial Press in 1969. Both Time magazine and The New York Times devoted long, fairly favorable reviews to the book, although the Times was clearly more impressed by it than the anonymous Time magazine critic. Using a phrase of Condon's about what another character thinks Eddie West looks like as a young man, \\"a fish cake with a mustache\\", as the title of its review, the Time review recognizes many of Condon's talents in the book but also points out numerous faults: > The hideous possibility exists that Richard Condon has committed allegory. > This saddening and unlikely conclusion is what remains after the reader has > discarded all ordinary explanations for Mile High. The fine, demented gleam > in Condon's eye has become a glitter, like that of a health-bar sign > observed through the bottom of a celery-tonic bottle.... Condon's great and > nourishing strength has always been his mania for mania. The mushy > midsection of the human-behavior range has no interest for him, and ordinary > psychosis not much more. What grips his imagination, and shakes it till > splendid words fall out, is the tic of a human bomb.... Mile High at first > seems a normal Condon fancy.... Eddie West, the son of an Irish immigrant, > brings about Prohibition singlehanded. His reason for doing so is that > Prohibition will provide business opportunities. This is instantly > understood by \\"the 18 greediest, the seven most hypocritical and the five > wealthiest families in the country\\" to whom he goes for financing.... This > should be daft, glorious stuff, and West ought to lurch into life as a > monstrously American folk villain, the match of such folk heroes as Paul > Bunyan and Davy Crockett. If Minnesota's lakes are the hoof-prints of > Bunyan's blue ox, why can't Warren Harding, Al Capone and Joseph McCarthy be > the droppings from Eddie West's cigar? ...They might be, except that Condon > loses his balance and‚Äîodd for him‚Äîgoes off the shallow end. For the first > time in eight novels, he wavers from his delightful obsession that maniacal > rigidity is civilization's main motivating force and therefore the only > human quirk worth a novelist's attention.... Eddie West dies of Condon's > sermonizing. The last half of the book develops a subplot involving West's > compulsion to murder Negro women (his mother, who deserted him, was a very > dark-skinned Sicilian). It is here that the dreary suspicion of allegory > crosses the reader's mind. It may not be true that West is meant to stand > for corrupt America, and the Negro women for America's blacks, but the book > has been so mishandled by this point that no reader can be sure. Condon just > cannot be all bad, try as he will. Mile High contains at least one phrase > that will outlast the century. Someone's face is described as resembling \\"a > fish cake with a mustache.\\" Condon should discard the rest of the book and > rebuild on this foundation.\\"Books: Fish Cake with Mustache\\", Time magazine, > September 5, 1969, at At the New York Times, Pete Hamill, who has since had a long career as a journalist, columnist, and novelist, was favorably impressed by it except, perhaps, as a work of fiction. > For some years now, Richard Condon... has been one of our supreme > entertainers, a verbal tap-dancer whose ambitions usually have been limited > to bedazzlement, fantasy and dark laughter. For the moment, he has abandoned > vaudeville for a more serious stage. The result is this savage novel about > the corruption of modern America.... According to \\"Mile High,\\" it is not the > Mafia that is moving into business; Condon's thesis is that the Mafia was > the tool of \\"legitimate\\" business from the beginning, that the heroin pumped > into our children's arms has been sent there by respectable American > businessmen.... The plot becomes more operatic as it goes along. One of the > large weaknesses of the book, as fiction, is that we never feel anything > about Eddie West himself, not even loathing. But Condon makes his opera > believable, because he is the best of the practitioners of what might be > called the New Novelism... Condon applies a dense web of facts to his > fiction.

Condon has a mania for absolute detail that > reminds you frequently of Ian Fleming.... Despite the cult that has grown up > around Condon, he is not really a great novelist, and certainly makes no > pretensions about the value of his work. But as a practitioner of the > fiction of information, no one else comes close to him.... If much of the > book remains thesis and exposition (and thus fails as fiction), the thesis > itself is terrifying. He has written, with brilliance and style, an > indictment that forgives nothing.\\"For Eddie West, power was all that > mattered,\\" by Pete Hamill, The New York Times, August 31, 1969, at Title The title, for only the second time in Condon's eight novels, is not derived from a fictitious Keener's Manual mentioned in most of his earlier novels. Only his second, and most famous work, The Manchurian Candidate, had not previously used doggerel from the Manual as a title source. Characters Typical Condon quirks and characteristics =Metaphors and similes= The novel offers many fine examples of the traits and stylistic tricks that were typical of all of Condon's works, among them, as the playwright George Axelrod once put it, \\"the sheer gusto of the prose, the madness of his similies, the lunacy of his metaphors\\".Reviewing one of Condon's works in the International Herald Tribune; Axelrod was the author of the well-known plays The Seven-Year Itch and Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter and had collaborated with Condon on the screenplay for the first film adaptation of The Manchurian Candidate, A selection, taken almost at random: from Mile High: * \\"His anger was mounting like the white smoke of the papal election signal\\"‚Äîpage 34 * \\"Her dank black hair looked as though it had been arranged with an egg beater\\"‚Äîpage 36 * \\"She paddled on her back in a limpid pool of wistful fantasies\\"‚Äîpage 37 * \\"He was seventy-nine years old and might have lived to be ninety had he remembered Aaron Burr and not lost his temper just for the sake of slugging a horse. Just as Burr might have been President had he not lost his temper and shot Alexander Hamilton\\"‚Äîpage 44 =Food= As one Condon book succeeded another, he more and more described elaborate food preparations, generally from French cuisine, and gave long, detailed menus for what his characters ate at various meals. In Mile High, the abstemious Paddy West has a businessman's lunch at the famous Delmonico's at which he drinks selzer water but eats dines on \\"caviar, tortue verte au sherry, filets de sole √† la Nantua, supr√™me de volaille aux truffes fra√Æches, haricot verts √† la creme, pommes de terre √† la parisienne, parfait de fois gras √† la gel√©e de porto, asperges vertes, bombe Montmorency and friandises.\\"‚Äîpage 47 =Real-life names= Condon enjoyed peppering his books with generally brief allusions to real-life acquaintances. In Mile High, there is the first mention of the novelist Robert Keifetz, as \\"the Keifetz Prize,\\" on page 263, first mention of Keifetz. Also appearing is another of Condon's regulars, Dr. Abraham Weiler, page 262. In real life Weiler was a film critic for the New York Times. F. Marx Heller of the law firm Pick, Heller & O'Connell appears on page 61 and plays a minor role for a few chapters. F.M. Heller, or some variation thereof, is mentioned in all 26 of Condon's novels. The real-life Heller was a television director in New York City who eventually moved to a house on Rockrimmon Road in Stamford, Connecticut. \\"I flew in straight from an all-night party at Rockrimmon,\\" says a character in Mile High on page 313, the first of what would become recurring mentions of Rockrimmon in future Condon books. Possible errors In spite of Condon's thorough research and mania for elaborate details, long lists of trivia, and the apparent authenticity of all the purported facts that are cited in his books, there are at least two probable errors in Mile High. On page 93 an Italian prostitute sits in a \\"green rayon wrapper\\" awaiting her client at an unspecified date but probably around 1912 to 1915. This is possible but most unlikely: rayon had been invented 50 years earlier but its development was troubled and it was not until after World War I that it had been refined enough to become an everyday article of clothing. A more glaring error is the statement on page 41 that Eddie West receives an autographed photograph from William McKinley in the White House dated January 27, 1904. McKinley, of course, was assassinated in 1901 and Theodore Roosevelt was in the White House in 1904. Given the highly improbable premise of the book that a single man, Eddie West, invented and implemented Prohibition, it is possible that the wrong date is intentional and that Condon is warning the astute reader that the events of Mile High take place in an alternative universe in which McKinley was not assassinated.

In 1927 she married a mathematics teacher, Jacques Muller. The marriage lasted until his death in 1974. Her daughter was born the day the Germans invaded Belgium in May 1940. She fled with her husband to a small village near Bordeaux, but was forced by the government in exile to return to Brussels, and remained there, active in the Belgian Resistance. After the war, she lived regularly in Paris and had contact with writers such as Simone de Beauvoir Raymond Queneau and Jean-Paul Sartre, and also with painters such as Ren√© Magritte and Paul Delvaux. Her last novel, A la Recherche de Marie, was published in 1943. In the mid-1980s, however, Madeleine Bourdouxhe was rediscovered by the feminists, resulting in new editions and translations.

Published in 1961, it was one of the books that inspired a brief cult for his strenuously off-beat works. A subtitle does not appear on the cover of its first edition but is shown on an inner page. Plot In the 16th century an Aztec priest has cut off his own hand and used the bloody stump to lay a curse upon a blasphemous Spanish conquistador and all his direct descendants. The curse: that once any of the descendants, whether male or female, have tasted physical love, even in the form of a single kiss, they will spend the rest of their lives as being nearly sexually insatiable. Three centuries later the beautiful young virginal daughter of a fabulously wealthy Texas rancher and gambler is its latest victim. An elaborate set of contests and races is arranged to choose which of two cowboys will win her hand in marriage. Critical reception The cover of the 1978 Ballantine Books paperback edition. The reception was mixed. Time magazine said: > Disciples are the undoing of holy men, and so it is with Richard Condon, a > talented and satirical fantast whose fiercely proselytizing followers regard > him as the fifth hoarse man of the Apocalypse. A Condon novel has the sound > and shape of a bagful of cats.... But Condon's latest morality, a Western, > is written with calculation, not exasperation. It is not hard to imagine the > author fretfully asking himself, on a dry day, what would be a good, juicy > Condon touch.... Proof that the author himself knows that something is wrong > is that on almost every page he stops to wave at friends in the crowd. A > street in Paris, for instance, is not too slyly titled \\"Rue Artbuch Wald.\\" The New York Times was more favorable: > One could go on about Richard Condon's surrealist story lines, his laugh- > out-loud satiric wit, and his inordinate ability to invent outlandish > detail. But the key to reading the author... correctly is to see him as a > sophistocated Hans Christian Andersen, a teller of sardonic fairy tales for > adults.... Along the way in his new novel, which is the Western to end them > all, Condon follows his bent of inserting a measure of social commentary > into his neatly laced phrases. Thus: \\"Never among the savage peoples of > history, excepting the white man, has there been equal to the ferocity, the > intelligence and the wanton destructiveness of the Apache Indians.\\" But > Condon's main aim is still to fascinate, surprise, entertain. And the reader > is successfully dazzled into a page-turning trance, like a book-struck > child.... Since this is a novel by Richard Condon, it all ends with > brilliantly eccentric symmetry as a war party of savage Injuns dash out to > rescue the whites from a massacre by the cavalry. Title The title, as is the case in six of Condon's first seven books, is derived from the first line of a typical bit of Condonian doggerel that supposedly comes from a fictitious Keener's Manual mentioned in many of his earlier novels: ::The riches I bring you ::Crowding and shoving, ::Are the envy of princes: ::A talent for loving.

Early life  Chambers was born in Bombay, India, to Frederick Chambers. Her father was a member of the Indian Civil Service before returning the family back to Britain.Mohr, P. (2004-09-23). Chambers, Helen (1879‚Äì1935), pathologist and cancer research worker. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Retrieved 21 Apr. 2018  Education and early research  Chambers studied at the Jersey Ladies' College, and Park Street Girls' School in Cambridge before going up to Newnham College, Cambridge, where she studied chemistry and physics. Chambers entered the London School of Medicine for Women in 1898 to train as a doctor. She continued her studies at London University, graduating Bachelor of Medicine (MB) with first-class honors and the gold medal for medicine in 1903.A correspondent. \\"Dr. Helen Chambers.\\" Times [London, they had treated England] 26 July 1935: 16. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 21 Apr. 2018. She earned her Bachelor of Surgery (BS) in 1904, and in the same year joined the Royal Free Hospital as a pathologist, taking charge of the department at the age of only 24. Four years later, in 1908, she gained her Doctor of Medicine (MD) in pathology for her thesis \\"Observations on pathology of the thyroid gland\\". She also lectured over pathology at the University of London. Chambers received a scholarship in cancer research becoming a part-time researcher at the Cancer Research Laboratories at the Middlesex Hospital, where she worked with physics and radium expert, Sidney Russ. From 1911 to 1913, Russ and Chambers studied the biological effects of radium. During this time, they published works in the Proceedings of the Royal Society and the Archives of the Middlesex Hospital. These works made Chambers a reputable cancer researcher.  Career  During the First World War, she worked at the Endell Street Military Hospital, the only British wartime hospital entirely staffed by women, as the consultant pathologist. The women doctors and surgeons treated thousands of soldiers with wound infections. Chambers created a new antiseptic called bismuth-iodoform-paraffin-paste or Bipp. This antiseptic reduced the amount of infections and provided an alternative to wound dressing on a daily basis. For this work she was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in January 1920. After the war, she took a full-time cancer research appointment with the Medical Research Council at the Middlesex Hospital's Barnato Joel Laboratories, being named the radium research officer. She researched immunology and radiobiology of tumours in the early 1920s but she recognised the potential of radium for treating cancer. Thus, she decided to focus on radiotherapy for treating cancer of the cervix. In her 1924 lecture, \\"Progress in cancer problems\\", Chambers urged women doctors to treat their cancer patients with radium. In 1924‚Äì1925 she organised a group of female doctors in an effort to improve the use of radium in cancer treatment, especially of women, at the Royal Free Hospital, Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital, South London Hospital and New Sussex Hospital in Brighton. The British Empire Cancer Campaign gave Chambers and the other researchers a large supply of radium. The women implemented a Swedish technique which improved the five year survival statistics. By 1928, they had treated 300 cases, and realised their need for a centre for treating women's cancers. The success of this project, combined with Chambers' foresight and dedication, led to the establishment of the Marie Curie Hospital on Fitzjohn's Avenue, Hampstead, in 1930, where she became pathologist. In little time, the hospital showed increasing survival rates and was considered the main centre for treating women's cancers.  Personal life and legacy  Chambers never married, dedicating her entire life to science and research. She lived in Watford, and on 21 July 1935, died of breast cancer. In 1937, two years after her death, the Marie Curie Hospital named its new pathology laboratory the Helen Chambers Research Laboratory in her honour.

First published by Random House in 1964, it is set in France and Germany of the 1930s and 1940s, as seen through the eyes of a beautiful, rich Parisian Jew and her beloved husband, an old-fashioned Prussian army general. What unfolds is and an almost unrelievedly bleak depiction of the rise of the Nazis and the Third Reich . In spite of a few moments of typical Condonian gayness and insouciance, the overall tone of the book is of foreboding, incipient horror, and the impending doom of the Holocaust. After publishing four novels from 1958 through 1961, Condon was already widely known as the author of The Manchurian Candidate and was the subject of a so-called \\"Condon Cult\\". He then took three years to research the historical background of An Infinity of Mirrors and bring it to publication. All of Condon's earlier books were replete with unexpected moments of violence and gratuitous death but none can compare with An Infinity of Mirrors' account of mass murder. Perhaps because of the unquestionably depressing nature of the book, it attracted less critical acclaim than his earlier works and did not noticeably expand the Condon Cult. The term \\"Holocaust\\" is not used in the book, as it was far less common in 1964, but Condon gives the reader an extremely grim picture of its origins and some of the practical details involved in its bureaucratic, yet evil, execution. The book was not a commercial success and, unlike three of his first four books, was never made into a film. Impetus Back cover of the 1964 first edition with an explanation by Condon of why he wrote the book Condon's impetus for writing An Infinity of Mirrors is laid out in an excerpt from a letter from him that takes up the entire back dust cover of the first American edition. In it he writes: > The story of Hitler's nihilism‚Äîdestruction for the sake of destruction‚Äîand > the incongruity of Nazis occupying Paris‚Äîthe Beast in the city of Beauty, as > it were‚Äîhave attracted me since the end of World War II.... What I wanted to > say was that when evil confronts us in any form, it is not enough to flee it > or to pretend that it is happening to somebody else. But though evil must be > opposed, when it is fought with evil's ways it must ultimately corrupt and > strangle the opposer. Critical reception Time magazine was not greatly impressed by Condon's latest offering and gave it a fairly cursory review: > Richard Condon's apocalyptic pocketa-pocketa has produced a resplendent > collection of giants, ogres and drowsy princesses, all flimsily disguised as > people. They reappear in this grim foray into Hitler-corrupted Germany, but > the author of The Manchurian Candidate has turned from dismayed humor to > dismaying homily. Condon's current princess is an enormously wealthy, > unbelievably beautiful Frenchwoman; though Jewish, she is married to a > monocle-twirling Prussian general who cannot see the evil of Hitler until > their adored child dies in a Jewish concentration camp. They retaliate by > consigning the guilty SS officer to a grisly fate. However, the novel does > not keep its implicit promise to find meaning in mankind's acquiescence in > evil. Worse, Condon's stylistic limitations, which hardly matter in a farce, > cripple a serious novel. As an old Hollywood press agent and the possessor > of a considerable comic talent, he should recall the studio adage that > messages are for Western Union.\\"Also Current: Sep. 4, 1964\\", Time magazine > at Flaws were also found in the book by the New York Times reviewer David Dempsey, but the review was generally more favorable: The cover of a 1965 paperback edition published by Fawcett Crest > Any novelist who conspires with history in writing a novel runs the obvious > risk of letting history do too much of the work.

Any God Will Do is the sixth book by the American satirist and political novelist Richard Condon, first published by Random House in 1966. After the almost unmitigated grimness of his previous book, An Infinity of Mirrors, it was a return to his more usual light-heartedness as displayed in works such A Talent for Loving. Although its theme is madness, unusually for Condon it has little of the almost gratuitous scenes of violence and sudden deaths that punctuate most of his books. The only notable instance is that of a haughty French sommelier who shoots himself at an aristocratic dinner party when he discovers that an American guest is indeed correct in asserting a great white Burgundy can accompany young spring lamb. The story, which takes place from 1918 to 1922 in New York City, Switzerland, and London, is simple and straightforward by Condon's standards. Francis Vollmer, an orphan of unknown parentage, is raised by a wealthy New York banker and develops an overwhelming obsession with the notion that he is the offspring of noble parentage, possibly even an illicit union of Kaiser Wilhelm and Queen Mary. Flitting in and out of overt madness, he spends the course of the book trying to determine his parentage. Except for The Manchurian Candidate, all of Condon's previous books had displayed a robust interest in food, menus, and gourmandizing; here that interest is carried to its highest level yet: Vollmer teaches himself to become a French chef of a professional level, and much of the book is concerned with the delights of the table.Any God Will Do, Richard Condon, Random House, New York, 1966, first hardback edition, pages 137‚Äî140, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 66-21462 Critical reception Time magazine was distinctly lukewarm about the book: > While there is meticulous method in [the protagonist's] madness, there is > not nearly enough madness in the narrative methods of Richard Condon (The > Manchurian Candidate). What the author intends is a black comedy on the > peril of an obsessive delusion; what he achieves is a hybrid between > bedroom-comedy pink and olive-drab boredom.... > > Despite clever barbs and lucent epigrams (\\"Respect is the only successful > aphrodisiac\\"), Any God Will Do is not as acidly funny as it keeps promising > to be. In the past, Condon cultists have been treated to comic narrative > leaps performed with the agility of a Macedonian goat, and to sly > surrealistic glimpses into the lives of Oedipal wrecks and decent drudges > who turn up naked at the Last Judgment. But in this book much of the elan is > gone; it sometimes appears as if Condon is padding to keep from plotting. > Besides, he seems to hold his nose in the presence of his desperate snob, > and an author's distaste for his own hero can taint a reader's > pleasure.\\"Snob's Folly,\\" Time magazine, October 7, 1966, at Kurt Vonnegut, who in 1966 had not yet reached international acclaim and was far less known than Condon, was more favorably disposed about it in the New York Times: > The sixth novel by Richard Condon, an American, of course, seems very > middle-European to me. I hear echoes of Friedrich Durrenmatt, Max Frisch, > und so weiter-- and the theme, I take it, is the loss of identity by modern > man. I might as well add the name of Thomas Mann, since a lot of the action > takes place in a Swiss sanitarium, and since this is such a serious book (or > have I been had again?) It is serious despite a plot rigged along the lines > of low comedy. What could be more middle-European than that? > The best parts of the book are its celebrations of food....The poorest > parts of the book are its characters. The leading man, as has been said, is > hollow and is supposed to be hollow, and the supported players who put junk > into him or take it out are cartoons....The book is an honorable failure-- a > failure because it is boring, despite many game and clever efforts of the > author's part to bring it to life. It is honorable because it has tried to > say some big things without a trace of meretriciousness. Condon has not > solved a technical problem which may well be insoluble: how to write > interestingly about a man who is truly empty.Kurt Vonnegut, \\"The Fall of a > Climber\\", the New York Times, September 25, 1966, at Eight years later Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, the regular book reviewer of the Times, began a long review of Condon's latest novel with a backward look at Any God Will Do: > I gave up bothering with Richard Condon's books about five novels ago when > in Any God Will Do he led me all the way through his snobbish hero's search > for royal forebears, only to reveal at the end that said hero was actually > the offspring of dwarfs. It seemed to me that Mr. Condon was making his > point through overkill, just as he had one in his previous novel, An > Infinity of Mirrors, a one-dimensional attempt to exploit our revulsion with > Nazism.

Title The title, as is the case in six of Condon's first seven books, is derived from the last line of a typical bit of Condonian doggerel that supposedly comes from a fictitious Keener's Manual mentioned in many of his earlier novels: ::Interest is the key to life, ::Interest in the clue, ::Interest is the drum and fife ::And any god will do. The verse is found in only one place, as an epigraph on a blank page four pages after the title page and two pages before the beginning of the text.The entire verse is in italics. Any God Will Do, Random House, New York, 1966, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 66-21462 Unlike some of Condon's other books, however, in which the verse is clearly relevant to the theme of the book, this particular title, Any God Will Do, has no apparent relevance to what happens in the course of the novel. Theme The theme of the book is stated succinctly by the unfortunate female lover of Francis Vollmer: \\"He went mad because of snobbism.\\" Any God Will Do, Richard Condon, Random House, New York, 1966, first hardback edition, page 231, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 66-21462 > \\"He had been a poor orphan boy.

But he had invented all of it, it never had happened, > and he drove himself quite mad.\\" Typical Condon quirks and characteristics The novel offers several fine examples of the traits and stylistic tricks that are typical of Condon's work, among them, as the playwright George Axelrod once put it, \\"the madness of his similies, the lunacy of his metaphors\\". In a book in which the principal theme is social climbing, and the setting is Switzerland, we have: > She...took Francis in her arms, and began to ascend the north face of one of > the highest orgasms she had ever climbed.

Produced by Matt Peel, the album was released by Fierce Panda Records on 28 March 2011. The album was supported by the release of four singles and received generally positive reviews in the media. Chasing After Ghosts marked the last recording involvement with The Crookes for founding member and guitarist Alex Saunders. Background The Crookes were formed in the similarly named suburb of Sheffield in 2008, and had come to initial prominence through releasing one‚Äìoff singles on Too Pure and Heist or Hit Records before signing with Fierce Panda. After the release of the eight‚Äìtrack Dreams of Another Day EP in October of that year, they recorded their first full-length album, Chasing after Ghosts for release in 2011. This would mark the final contributions of guitarist Alex Saunders, who left the band following the promotional activities surrounding the album. Release Chasing after Ghosts was preceded by a single \\"Godless Girl\\" in mid‚ÄìMarch 2011, two weeks before the release of the album. The song \\"Bloodshot Days\\" had been released as a one-shot single the previous year, but this was re‚Äìrecorded for the album. \\"Chasing After Ghosts\\" was released on 28 March 2011, and the band embarked on various promotional tours both in the UK and other territories throughout the rest of the Summer and into Autumn 2011. Two further singles were released to promote the album: \\"Chorus of Fools\\" in July, and \\"I Remember Moonlight\\" in October 2011. The album itself was subsequently released in Japan in a deluxe version, including four extra tracks unavailable on the UK pressing. Track listing Reception Chasing After Ghosts was generally well received by online music press that reviewed it and was supported by both Huw Stephens on BBC Radio 1 and Steve Lamacq on BBC Radio 6 Music. In reviewing the album for the BBC, Iain Moffatt opined that \\"...live they positively crackle with the sort of inclusively bonhomous pop charge that modern thinking seldom credits currently-little-league guitar bands with, but they've also managed to make a debut album that accommodates all the allusions that come with such a soubriquet.\\" Likening them to Morrissey, The Housemartins and Aztec Camera, he concluded that \\"...they're admittedly unlikely to shepherd in a fresh wave of post-Britpop, but at least The Crookes are stealing from all the right places.\\" Writing for Drowned in Sound, Robert Cooke similarly likened The Crookes sound to that of The Smiths, but suggested that the album was \\"...eloquently coherent, with themes of youthful frustration and heartache constantly present, but never in a way that is embarrassingly gushing or childishly simplistic.\\" He concluded that \\"...it's nice to know that there's a place for poetry in contemporary pop.\\" AllMusic identified wider influences in the song-writing, with James Allen suggesting that alongside The Smiths, Chasing After Ghosts echoed the likes of The Mighty Lemon Drops, The Woodentops and even The Kinks. Concluding that \\"... when a band shows this much skill so early on, the biggest worry is that it'll peak too early, but still, there are far less enviable situations for a young act to find itself in,\\" he felt The Crookes sounded \\"...strikingly self-assured and fully formed for a band making its full-length debut.\\" In her review for This Is Fake DIY, Mary Chang said the album \\"shows their penchant for jangly guitars and concern for the downhearted, set to a enjoyable soundtrack celebrating the beauty of the shadows\\" and \\"Despite their youth and relative lack of life experience, the Crookes have managed to write an album that distills the Northern rain into 11 tracks.

Nervous about the prospect of having sex, Margie picks up a copy of Mother Goose and begins reading from it, causing Ted to faint. Dr. Richards (D'Hondt), a psychiatrist, deduces that Ted has a \\"Mother Goose complex\\" and treats him with an LSD spray while he sleeps.

Although satiric and sardonic in its depiction of the film business, it is so broadly drawn and implausible in its plotting and manner of telling that it is far more of a burlesque than Condon's previous books. Unlike most \\"Hollywood novels\\", in spite of its mockery of the subject, Condon appears to be writing more with affection than bitterness.

Donleavy and Anne McCaffrey, immediately took up residence; Condon asserts, however, that despite moving to Rossenarra about the same time, his own finances and citizenship were such that he never benefitted from living in this tax-free haven. Much of the book is devoted to his purchase and excruciatingly long and expensive restoration of the country house, with many incidents about incompetent plumbers, electricians, and other tradesmen, all directed by a fictional Capo invented by Condon as a humorous device. A memoir rather than a formal autobiography, the narrative is presented in a non- chronological manner, jumping almost randomly from one decade to another. The chapters all have long-winded, whimsical names in the style of 19th-century novels, (In Which we find Locarno. Shall we try England next? Or Crans? Or Adelaide, Australia? How to tell a Rolls Royce from a Mercedes), and there are frequent asides and anecdotes about food and its preparation in various cultures, as well as about some of Condon's books, particularly his first one, The Oldest Confession, and his most famous one, The Manchurian Candidate. In 1955, Condon, the publicity agent for The Pride and the Passion, a film starring Frank Sinatra and Sofia Loren being made in Spain, was present at a scene being filmed in the ancient rectory of the Escorial, the massive palace and cathedral outside of Madrid. The enormous lights needed to film the scene \\"revealed dozens upon dozens of great masterpieces of paintings that had not been seen centuries, hung frame touching frame‚Äîthe work of Goya, Velasquez, the great Dutch masters, and the most gifted masters of the Italian Renaissance.\\" > ...The idea of masterpieces of Spanish painting hanging in stone castles all > over Spain, high and invisible in the darkness, stayed with me and gradually > formed itself into a novel called The Oldest Confession, which got me over > the wall to freedom and got us off the high road to high-style, free-lance > emigrating. Back in New York, Condon began turning his initial concept into a screenplay‚Äîuntil his wife pointed out, correctly, that he was writing it in the past tense instead of the present, which is obligatory for screenplays, and that it should be turned into a novel. Condon followed her advice and the book was published to favorable reviews not long later. In contrast to most of Rossenarra, which is distinctly flip in manner, some of Condon's comments in Chapter 19 about the supposed similarities between the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and his The Manchurian Candidate, which had been published three years before the murder, are both heart-felt and bitter in their assessment of the American character. Scattered throughout the book, almost at random, are anecdotes and stories that generally have at least a slight relationship to the theme of the chapter in which they are found. Working as a youth for the Walt Disney Studios, for instance, he helped promote a sequel to the famous, and very successful, animated cartoon The Three Little Pigs. The sequel, The Practical Pig, he writes, involved a tie-up with \\"large colored displays of the characters and title in 18,924 pork and meat shops from coast to coast during the week the film would appear.\\" > Disney stared at me the way Eleanor Roosevelt would have looked at Heinrich > Himmler... his face gone white and haggard... so shocked that his lower lip > bobbled... \\"It's like you were working for Metro and you tied up three of > their biggest stars with National Embalming Week\\"... The measure of Disney, > the man, is that he did not fire me... I would have fired me. I felt like a > murderer. That was 1937. It wasn't until 1959, when we moved to Mexico, that > I could really enjoy pork again. For the first few years it like trying to > eat roast actor. As a result of his first few novels, all of them strikingly original in either content or manner of telling, Condon had become not only famous, with reviews in all the major media such as The New York Times, Time, and Newsweek, but also something of a literary cult figure. By the time Rossenarra was published, however, his reputation had slipped so much that its only mention in any of these three outlets was a notice of its appearance in \\"A Listing of Recently Published Books\\" in the New York Times of May 30, 1973.

Founded by Governor Thomas Brisbane, on 7 September 1825, the Mounted Police were recruited from a British military regiment stationed in NSW at the time, to protect travellers, suppress convict escapees and fight Indigenous Australians. The force remained the mounted division of the British Army in the colony of New South Wales until 1850, when it took upon a more civilian role. The NSW Mounted Police Unit is the oldest continuous mounted group in the world.They have a great group of riders that work there. Mounted Police at 'Thin Blue Line' unofficial NSW police site. History After the Bathurst War between the British and the Wiradjuri people concluded in 1824, it was deemed necessary that a mounted infantry division be formed in New South Wales. In 1825, the British Colonial Office approved the idea and agreed to finance the troopers for the mounted force who were to be recruited from the British Army stationed in the colony. The New South Wales government provided funding for the cost of the horses and equipment. Colonel William Stewart of the 3rd Regiment organised the first detachment by selecting 28 soldiers from his force. This first detachment of mounted troopers, which was based at Bathurst, became active on 4 November 1825. The second detachment was formed in February 1826 and was based at Wallis Plains which is now called Maitland. While the Bathurst division were quickly utilised to capture escaped convicts, the Wallis Plains unit were deployed in the repression of Aboriginal resistance along the newly colonised area of the Hunter Valley. Lieutenant Nathaniel Lowe, who volunteered for the Mounted Police from the 40th Regiment, ordered multiple executions of Aboriginal prisoners as part of the campaign. Reinforcements of mounted infantry under Ensign Archibald Robertson of the 57th Regiment were required from Sydney and Newcastle throughout the latter half of 1826 to force the local Wonnarua people to submit to British rule. With the aid of armed settlers such as Robert Scott of Glendon, the Mounted Police conducted raids of local Aboriginal camps and by early 1827 resistance in the area ended. Lieutenant Lowe was brought before a court to face charges of extrajudicial murder, but was acquitted and reinstated to his position. Lieutenant Lachlan Macalister By 1829 the force was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Snodgrass. There were four areas of operation, the main detachment of the unit, incorporating the Governor's guard, was stationed in Sydney at the Belmore Barracks (located on the present site of the Central railway station). There were three country divisions based at Bathurst, Goulburn and Maitland. Lieutenant Lachlan Macalister, who was also a prominent pastoral capitalist in the colony, was placed in charge of the Argyle Division and later commanded the Bathurst Division. Capturing outlaw gangs of escaped convicts, commonly referred to as bushrangers, was the main employment of the Mounted Police at this time. The Bushranging Act of 1830 which enabled the arrest without warrant of anyone suspected of being a criminal aided the force in their duties. The Mounted Police absorbed the Mounted Orderlies (established as a replacement for the Governor's Body Guard of Light Horse) in 1836. This unit existed as a separate component of the mounted police until at least 1860. Major James Winniett Nunn In 1837, Major James Winniett Nunn of the 80th Regiment became Commandant of the Mounted Police. The British colony at this time was spreading into regions that are now known as Port Phillip and the Liverpool Plains. Resistance by the Gamilaraay people to occupation in the Liverpool Plains area prompted the NSW government to send a large force led by Nunn to suppress this opposition. In early 1838, Nunn conducted a two-month sweeping operation along the Gwydir and Namoi Rivers that culminated in the Waterloo Creek massacre, where his mounted troopers shot dead at least 50 Gamilaraay people. This operation coincided with numerous other massacres of Aboriginals in the area by armed gangs of British settlers, of which the Myall Creek massacre is the best known. An inquiry into Nunn's campaign exonerated him of any wrong doing and he continued to command the Mounted Police as they expanded their operations in the south of the colony. By the mid 1840s, the Mounted Police consisted of around 150 troopers in five divisions distributed among 35 stations ranging from Muswellbrook in the north, Portland Bay in the south and Wellington in the west. The much cheaper Border Police had by this time usurped most of the functions of the Mounted Police and the cost of maintaining the force was deemed too expensive for the colonial government to run. In 1850 its paramilitary function was ceased and the force took on the more civilian role that it has in the present day. The frontier duties of repressing Aboriginal resistance was largely taken on by the Native Police. Redfern For over a century the New South Wales Mounted Police were a key part of policing, as horses were the main form of transport. The unit was formed three years before the London Mounted Police\\"Metropolitan Police Service ‚Äì History of the Metropolitan Police Service\\". Metropolitan Police. Archived from the original on 26 April 2009. Retrieved 6 May 2009. and 38 years prior to the 1873 formation of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.History of the RCMP Official Canadian police site By the 1900s the Mounted Police had grown to a strength of over 800 personnel and more than 900 horses. Most stations throughout the state had mounted units attached to them. It was around this time that they unit was moved from Belmore Barracks, to allow for the construction of the present Central railway station, to a temporary base at Moore Park, and then on to the Bourke Street Police complex at Redfern in 1907. Horses Horses used by the mounted Police generally include a variety of breeds, including heavier horses such as warm bloods, draft horses and Clydesdale crosses. Historically horses were donated to the section, and ex race horses have been included in the donations. It can take up to two years to train a mount. Modern-day duties Duties include traffic and crowd management, patrols, and ceremonial protocol duties (including taking part in the Queen's Jubiliee celebrations in London). Currently the NSW Mounted Police has a strength of 36 officers and around 38 mounts. Nine full-time grooms are employed to assist with the care of the horses and running and maintenance of the stable complex.

Israel thus has no reason to agree to assimilate them or provide them with a state, since they were part of those countries until their territory was captured in the 1967 Six-Day War. This proposal is very similar to the three-state solution advocated by some commentators. A very different alternative interpretation of a 'zero-state solution' has been presented by the Isocracy Network, a few years prior to the ACPR proposal. This anarchist perspective is more similar to the one-state solution, with the exception that instead of priorities of States, the concrete and visceral rights of individuals are given priority. The Isocracy 'zero-state solution' argues that the oft-suggested two-state solution is not a plausible option, 'there is next to no chance that the half million Israeli settlers are going to move from East Jerusalem or the West Bank. There is next to no chance that a Palestinian state without contiguous borders would ever be viable.' Overview (ACPR)  The approach generally assumes that Israel will expand to fill the territories occupied in 1967. Specific proposals differ as whether the present Palestinians can remain where they are, as non-citizens of Israel, or are expected to return to the territory of their national identity. There has been opposition to this plan from Palestinians, Jordanians and Egyptians. The proposal by ACPR, the \\"Framework Proposal for a National Strategy Regarding Judea and Samaria and the Issue of Eretz Israel Arabs\\", describes an objective of \\"Consolidating a political proposal with the intention of halting Israel's defeatist campaign that is manifest in its most extreme form in the conduct of the Olmert Government\\". It assumes that there is no unique Palestinian identity and that the Palestinians in the West Bank should get \\"restoration of Jordanian citizenship\\" while Egypt should have responsibility for the Gaza Strip. It proposes a unilateral solution because it does not believe Arab states will accept: * Extending Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank * \\"Jordan is Palestine\\" and restoration of Jordanian citizenship to the Arabs in Judea and Samaria * Municipal autonomy for the Arabs of Judea and Samaria (on the basis of the Camp David Accords) accompanied by a total disarmament of the autonomous areas * The areas of Arab settlements located on private property (the Mosaic Program by Dr. Yuval Arnon Ohanna) * Military liquidation of the military infrastructure in Gaza and according responsibility for the area to Egypt * Israeli Arabs: Equal rights in exchange for equal obligations Overview (Isocracy)  Whereas the ACPR proposal essentially means one state for Israel, zero states for the Palestinians, the argument from the Isocracy Network is the abolition of States in general. In this particular context it argues that all individuals in the country of historic Palestine are deserving of equal rights and liberties regardless of the governing authority that they live under. Specifically, the Isocracy version of the \\"Zero-State\\" solution argues that: * Governance would be secular and democratic. * There would be no special benefits on the basis of nationalities, real or imagined, or religious affiliation that were separate from the rights of all citizens. * The region would be a Jewish homeland, rather than a Jewish state (as with any other religion). * Land would be held as a public good without discrimination in leasing rights. * There would be no standing armies, only reserve militia and emergency services for the purpose of local defense and civil order, not invasive war.

Born at Wanerenooka, Northampton, Western Australia, Drew established and edited several newspapers circulating in the Geraldton region before entering politics. A strong opponent of federation, he was elected to the Legislative Council in 1900. Nominally independent, Drew aligned himself with the Labor Party, and served in several Labor ministries during the early 1900s, in positions such as Minister for Agriculture, Minister for Lands, and Colonial Secretary. He officially joined the party in 1911, having been admitted to caucus sittings the previous year. During World War I, Drew supported conscription, but this issue, coupled with the ineffectual Scaddan Ministry, led to him losing his seat at the 1918 election.

It is governed by a socialist constitution and operates within the political system of North Korea. Legal system North Korea has a codified civil law system, which was inherited from colonial Japan and is similar to South Korea's system. There are over 100 laws and regulations. The foreign investment laws are well-developed and up-to-date, and there is a highly developed arbitration system. North Korea has a three- tier court system, based on the Soviet model, comprising a Central Court, provincial courts, and county courts. Judicial affairs are handled by the Central Procurator's Office. The penal code is based on the principle of nullum crimen sine lege (no crime without a law), but remains a tool for political control despite several amendments reducing ideological influence. Courts carry out legal procedures related to not only criminal and civil matters, but also political cases as well. Political prisoners are sent to labor camps, while criminal offenders are incarcerated in a separate system. Legal profession North Korean attorneys must join the Choson Bar Association. The association's Central Committee determines professional standards, as well as the qualifying or disqualifying of attorneys. Attorneys are not hired by individuals or agencies, but rather the committee collects legal representation requests and then assigns cases and pays remunerations to the assignee. However, attorneys do not have a monopoly on providing legal services as anyone might provide representation in civil or criminal proceedings. The Law College at Kim Il Sung University is the only university- level institution that provides legal education. For 12 years, Michael Hay was the only foreign lawyer operating in North Korea. He reported winning or partly winning 70% of cases when representing foreign firms. Law and politics According to Robert Collins of the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, the specific hierarchy of authority in North Korea is the words or personal directives of Kim Jong-un, followed by the Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System, WPK directives ‚Äîparticularly the policy guidance of the WPK Secretariat's Organization and Guidance Department, the WPK Charter and domestic civil laws, and finally the North Korean Constitution. The WPK, while maintaining the dominant political role within the North Korean party-state, came to serve the leader in primacy above all other political entities. As in other communist political systems, the state and society serve the party, and civil laws do not bind the party.Songbun- North Korea‚Äôs Social Classification System, pg.15 See also *Law enforcement in North Korea *Politics of North Korea  References  =Works cited= * Further reading  * External links * North Korea at the Law Library of Congress * Full texts of laws on economy and trade at Naenara * Compilation of Laws and Regulations (For Foreign Investment) * North Korea at NATLEX (ILO) * North Korea at FAOLEX (FAO) * North Korea at WIPO Lex * Intellectual property laws at Korea Computer Center (archived) * Criminal Law of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (1999/2009) * \\"Brushes with the Law: North Korea and the Rule of Law\\" at Keia.org Politics of North Korea ","title":"Law of North Korea"},{"id":"36499487","text":"T·ªï t√¥m T·ªï t√¥m is a draw-and-discard card game played in Vietnam, usually by men.Mark W.

He is the founder of the Brightworks School, Tinkering School, the non-profit Institute for Applied Tinkering, and educational kit maker Tinkering Labs. His more recent work centers around the concept of students learning through building projects. He has delivered multiple TED talks on his work, published the book 50 Dangerous Things (You Should Let Your Children Do), and has contributed articles for many online media outlets. Career =Tinkering School= A self-taught software engineer, Tulley created the summer program called Tinkering School in 2005. The Tinkering School's program provides children with a week-long overnight experience at a ranch outside of San Francisco, California, United States. Participants spend the week building large projects such as a working roller coaster, a rope bridge made out of plastic bags, and a 3-story tree house. =TED= Tulley delivered a talk at the TED2007 conference entitled \\"5 Dangerous Things You Should Let Your Kids Do\\". In this talk, Tulley makes the argument that a growing trend towards over-protection of children is harming their ability to learn and think. Thus, Tulley advocates for parents to allow their children to do supervised activities that are considered to be dangerous. Tulley advises that children should: # Let children be co-authors in their education. # Trust children more. # The default answer is yes. # Focus on habits and character. # Agree that everything is interesting. By doing so, Tulley believes children will learn concepts that they may not learn in more structured and conventional activities. Tulley has since given further TED conference talks at TED2009 and various TEDx conferences. =Brightworks School= In 2011, Tulley opened the Brightworks School in San Francisco. The school expands upon the premise of his summer program, and students from grades K-12 learn through hands-on activities facilitated by adult \\"collaborators\\". The school opened in September 2011 with an initial enrollment of 18 students. The school follows a curriculum called the \\"Brightworks Arc\\" which has three phases: exploration, expression, and exposition. Criticism Tulley's philosophy on allowing children to participate in more dangerous activities has attracted the criticism of some parents and child psychologists. Child psychologist Michael Carr-Gregg has called Tulley's book an overreaction to \\"cotton-wool\\" parenting, and has called for sales of the book to be banned in Australia (despite Carr-Gregg never having read the book). Amanda Cox, founder of the parent organization Real Mums, has also criticized the book, claiming that the book crosses a fine line between learning and being dangerous.

German; literally: 'poem of things' or 'thing poem' plural: Dinggedichte) is a poetic form, referring to a specific focus and mood in the choice of a poetic theme. Developed during the second half of the 19th century, the focus in a Dinggedicht rests on an animate or inanimate object that is described in a distanced, often dissociated and objectified way. The poet aims at finding the language that is specific and supposedly indigenous to the thing in view. The poet attempts to let the very object itself speak in its own language. It is supposed to express the inner being of the object in focus. In this tradition, objects from the arts have often been taken up, but more recently poets have also sought out objects from every-day life. Furthermore, the Dinggedicht needs not necessarily aim at a physical object, but also recapture abstract notions in an objectified fashion. The voice in the Dinggedicht is frequently the third person. The poetological technical terms has been coined by the German literary scholar Kurt Oppert.

This gate was part of Beijing's city wall, situated south-west of the city center and facing east. Guang'anmen served as a main entrance to Beijing. The Records of the Capital at Yan , written by the Qing historian Gu Sen described the gate as follows: \\"Of the seven outer city gates, the one facing east is called Guangningmen. 15 li to the west of the gate is Lugou Bridge; if you cross the bridge and continue 20li, you will find the seat of Liangxiang County. The gate is a strategic passage for ground traffic from the southern provinces and is of vital importance.\\" The gate was torn down for construction of Beijing's 2nd Ring Road, which led to the demolition of most of Beijing city fortifications.

History Guang'anmen was known as \\"Guangningmen\\" during the Ming and early Qing Dynasty. It was renamed by the Daoguang Emperor, whose private name was Minning.

It was closed about 1960, with all flight operations being moved to the larger Lakeland Linder International Airport.  History  Lodwick Field was built in the mid-1930s by the Works Progress Administration as the municipal airport for Lakeland, Florida. It replaced the smaller Haldeman-Elder Field (southeast of the city) was proving inadequate to meet the city's needs. The airport of the 1930s had two paved runways, a north- south strip of 2,456 feet, and an east-west one of 2,475 feet. Two wider sod runways ran northwest-southeast (2,562 feet) and southwest-northeast (3,054 feet) and were later paved. To the east along the shore of Lake Parker was a seaplane ramp and dock. In 1937, Lakeland commenced its first regular commercial airline service when National Airlines began flying its Lodestar planes from Municipal Airport. In 1940, the Lincoln Airplane & Flying School was moved from Lincoln, Nebraska, to Lakeland's more favorable climate. The owner, EJ. Sias, later sold the flying school to Albert L. Lodwick (1904‚Äì1961), whose aviation career to that point included nine years with the Curtiss-Wright Corporation and the presidency of the Stinson Aircraft Company. The school was renamed the Lakeland School of Aeronautics in 1941 and later, the Lodwick School of Aeronautics. The school headquartered at the airport, and the Lodwick Aviation Military Academy in Avon Park, provided Army Air Corps cadets with primary flight training including time on PT-17 Stearman trainers. In addition to the main airport, the school operated the following sub-bases and auxiliary airfields: * Coronet Auxiliary Field * Haldeman-Elder Auxiliary Field * Hampton Auxiliary Field * Lodwick Auxiliary Field * Northeast Auxiliary Field #1 * Northwest Auxiliary Field #3 * Gilbert Auxiliary Field In addition to the military academy trainees, Lodwick also trained foreign students. The first class of cadets from England's Royal Air Force (RAF) arrived at Lodwick in 1941 and graduated from the ten-week training course on August 16 of that year. The last RAF trainees left in October 1942 and relocated to Riddle Field, near Clewiston. The Lodwick School of Aeronautics graduated more than six thousand cadets before it closed in August 1945. Albert Lodwick founded Lodwick Aircraft Industries in February 1946 to convert war surplus military aircraft to non-military use. The Lakeland City Commission renamed the airport as Al Lodwick Field in 1948. However, by the early 1950s, the number of military aircraft available for conversion to commercial use dwindled and most of the surplus parts & equipment it contracted to sell were obsolete & had no market. By 1954 the company was moribund. It had lost most of its assets in a bank foreclosure & ceased operations in September. Al Lodwick moved to the Miami area during the following year. With the closure of Lodwick Aircraft, Lodwick remained open for a few more years, but in the summer of 1957 Lakeland decided to move its airport to the much larger former military air base at Drane Field in south Lakeland. =Closure and Tiger Town= Beginning in 1953 the Detroit Tigers Tiger Town spring training complex was constructed over part of the airport, and with the closure of Lodwick Aircraft, Lodwick Field continued to be used by the city for several more years as its principal airport, but gradually more and more of the complex was converted for use as the spring training home of the Detroit Tigers professional baseball team. In 1958 the Tiger's spring training complex was expanded over the remains of the Lodwick Aircraft facility, and in 1960 the airport itself was closed. Expansion continued of the Tiger town complex, and in Joker Marchant Stadium was built in 1966. The three arched-roof hangars of the former airport have been renovated and are used for various purposes. Sadly, the most recent renovations to Tiger Town included the removal of a runway beyond the outfield wall. The facility is also the regular season home of the Class A Florida State League Lakeland Flying Tigers.

Such programs are quite significantly enhanced through the provision of an electronic version of an opening book. This eliminates the need for the program to calculate the best lines during approximately the first ten moves of the game, where the positions are extremely open-ended and thus computationally expensive to evaluate. As a result, it places the computer in a stronger position using considerably less resources than if it had to calculate the moves itself. On some occasions, a player might consider playing a strange move outside the opening book to force a computer to think for itself. While this may introduce a strategic weakness, a lot of the time, playing out of the book early may end up compromising one's own pawn structure, losing a tempo or allow the opponent to develop more effectively, as chess engines have become significantly more powerful over time to think more deeply or accurately than in the past. History By 1977, 14 of 16 entries in the second World Computer Chess Championship used opening books. One of the entries without a book, DARK HORSE, defeated opponent CHAOS in part by using a nonstandard N-F3 opening. Design Modern chess engines are designed to be controlled by a graphical user interface such as Winboard, ChessBase or Arena through the Universal Chess Interface protocol or Chess Engine Communication Protocol.

It can be seen as a precursor to Fantasia due to using various pieces of classical music in one short. The film was directed by Jack Cutting and produced by Walt Disney. An adaptation of the short was featured in the Silly Symphony comic strip over six weeks, from October 23 to November 27, 1938, around the time of the film's theatrical release. While the short doesn't have much of a story, the comic adaptation expands on a running gag involving a piglet looking for food, giving one of the piglets distinctive markings and a name (Spotty), and turns the gag into a short narrative. Spotty Pig also appeared in a nine-page story in the Silly Symphonies comic book issue #2 (1953). Synopsis Set to various classical pieces, the animals of a farmyard go about their daily business. The highlight is a rooster wooing a white hen, with the other animals joining in until they hear a sound more welcoming to them: the call of feeding time. =Pieces included= In order of appearance, the film includes the following pieces and arias. *Third movement (Allegro) and fifth (Allegretto) from Symphony No. 6 \\"Pastoral\\", by Ludwig van Beethoven - played under the opening credits and in the very first scene. *First and third part from William Tell Overture by Gioacchino Rossini - starting when the bull is waking up. *Overture from The Barber of Seville, by Rossini - foal waking up and piglets eating. *Allegretto grazioso (Op. 62, No. 5) from Songs Without Words by Felix Mendelssohn, popularly known as \\"Spring Song\\" - played while the calf and the foal chase each other. *\\"Garryowen\\" - while the ducks are marching. *Overture to Semiramide, by Rossini - during the rooster's strut and when he wakes up the chickens. *\\"La donna √® mobile\\" from Rigoletto by Giuseppe Verdi - \\"clucked\\" by the rooster and the white hen; this metamorphoses into a variation of \\"Sempre libera\\" from Act 1 of La traviata, also by Verdi, when all the other animals join in. *Final part (\\"March of the Swiss Soldiers\\") of William Tell overture, by Rossini, going into Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 by Franz Liszt - while the animals are eating. *Third movement (Con modo moderato) from Symphony No. 4 \\"Italian\\", by Mendelssohn - ending scene, Spotty eating corn. In addition to the above pieces, the film features a few excerpts adapted by Leigh Harline from traditional tunes (such as the one to which \\"Chick, chick, chick, chick...\\" is sung by the peasant woman), as well as original orchestral passages of his, which have no classical source.

Although results were disappointing, the expedition led to continued contact with the people of the area and then to Spanish settlement in and around San Angelo, Texas. Castillo-Martin expedition In 1650 Hernando de Ugarte y la Concha, Governor of New Mexico, dispatched an expedition from Santa Fe, led by Captains Diego del Castillo and Hernan Martin, to explore what is now north central Texas. The Castillo-Martin expedition travelled about southeast from Santa Fe along the route that had been taken by the Dominican friar Juan de Salas when he visited the Jumano Indians in 1632. They reached the Concho River, and then what they called the R√≠o de las Perlas (\\"Pearl River\\"). They named the Concho River (\\"river of shells\\") after the Tampico pearly mussel (Cyrtonaias tampicoensis) which they found there. Some members of the expedition went another southeast until they came to the boundary of the large and populous territory of the Tejas Indians, but did not continue further because they were unsure of how they would be received. The Tejas chief heard of the Spanish presence and sent an envoy to meet with them. The expedition remained in the region for six months, and collected samples of the freshwater pearls. These were sent to Luis Enr√≠quez de Guzm√°n, 9th Count of Alba de Liste and Viceroy of New Spain, and were part of the reason for the subsequent Guadalajara expedition. Guadalajara expedition The Diego de Guadalajara entrada (expedition) was launched in 1654 to follow up on Castillo's findings. The expedition probably set out before Easter of 1654, led by Sergeant Major Diego de Gaulalajara and including thirty soldiers and 200 Christian Indians, and travelled to the Concho River in Jumano country as had the previous expedition. According to Christoval de Anaya, speaking in 1663 when on trial for heresy, the expedition traveled 300 leagues east for nine months through country inhabited by friendly but non-Christian Indians. The main body of the expedition remained on the Concho, encamping among the Jumanos. The Jumanos were recruited to harvest mussels in the hope that they would contain gem-quality pearls. Meanwhile, Captain Andr√©z Lop√©z travelled with a party of twelve soldiers about east, where they found a rancheria of \\"Cuitao\\" people. They fought these people and took two hundred prisoners, with two hundred bundles of animal skins. When the Lop√©z party rejoined the main expedition, the combined force returned to Santa Fe with their rich haul of pelts and slaves. Results The expedition had found far fewer pearls than they had expected, but the Spanish had become interested in the region. There are no records of specific expeditions during the next thirty years, but the Mexican archives hold evidence that many trading journeys were undertaken. The Spanish probably exchanged iron tools and horses for pelts and buffalo meat. Juan Dom√≠nguez de Mendoza, who had been a member of the 1654 Guadalajara expedition, led another expedition into the area in 1683-1684. The Spanish built missions, and eventually built the town of San Angelo. In modern times there is still a fishery for the mussels and their pearls.

History Corner of Bernauer Stra√üe and Ackerstra√üe photographed in 1963 and 2011 On 22 September 1751, Lieutenant General Hans Christoph Friedrich Graf von Hacke, commandant of the city of Berlin, received orders from King Frederick II of Prussia to build houses outside the city Customs Wall between the Hamburg Gate and the Rosenthal Gate.Geschichte von Ackerstra√üe, Stra√üennamenlexikon des Luisenst√§dtischen Bildungsvereins, at Kauperts Stra√üenf√ºhrer durch Berlin, online ed. , retrieved 23 July 2012. Initially 30 houses were to be built, to house 60 families selected from applicants. The objective was to have the craftsmen stay year-round in Berlin rather than leaving each winter. The new residents were mostly from Vogtland; as a result the new area of settlement came to be called Neuvoigtland (New Vogtland). The streets were laid out in parallel straight lines and were designated numerically; what is now the Ackerstra√üe was the middle street and was originally called the Zweite Reihe (second row), and became the Dritte Reihe (third row) when the local population increased in the 19th century and new streets were added. The district was divided into identical land parcels with approximately frontagesAckerh√∂fe, Ackerstra√üe 14-15 , Stadterneuerung - Mitte - Rundgang Rosenthaler Vorstadt, Senatsverwaltung f√ºr Stadtentwicklung und Umwelt, Berlin , retrieved 23 July 2012 and to save money and time, the original houses were standardised; this set a new trend. Gardens were laid out between them, but the population increase led to extension of the buildings as the area became more urban. The area changed name to Rosenthaler Vorstadt, and the local residents petitioned the police for street names to be assigned. On 18 February 1801 the \\"third row\\" was renamed Ackerstra√üe (Field Street), probably because the development was in the farming area outside the city, the Feldmark. On 6 April 1833, the continuation of the same street, from Invalidenstra√üe to Liesenstra√üe, was named Neue Ackerstra√üe (New Ackerstra√üe). The southern extension to Koppenplatz was added in 1877. The residents there preferred the name Virchowstra√üe, but their request was denied. The St. Elisabeth Cemetery near the midpoint of the street was dedicated in 1844 and is still in operation.Friedhof der Elisabeth-Gemeinde, Denkmale in Berlin, Senatsverwaltung f√ºr Stadtentwicklung und Umwelt, Berlin , retrieved 23 July 2012. In the 1870s and 1880s, the character of the street was greatly changed with the building of tenements. The Ackerh√∂fe at numbers 14-15, unusual in occupying two of the original land parcels, are a restored complex of tenements built in four phases between 1867 and 1911, the last phase representing an attempt at housing reform.

He has developed extensive collections of work in art, film and experimental media. In 2010, he founded The Mascot Gallery, an online resource and store featuring a range of artwork and film about America's great icons with impressionistic depictions of their often forgotten origins. In 2012, he launched a two-story studio and exhibition space on Main Street in Durham, North Carolina.  Life and career  Born in Baltimore, Maryland on the bicentennial of American Independence, La Noue was named after artisan and revolutionary Paul Revere. He earned a bachelor's degree from the College of Arts and Letters at the University of Notre Dame where he played on the lacrosse team. Graduating in 1999, he went on to complete a Master's in the Documentary Film and Video Program at Stanford University. He has also studied at the Art League, the Corcoran College of Art and Design, the Pratt Institute and the Universit√© Catholique de l'Ouest in Angers, France.http://www.artprize.org/revere-la-noue In 2006, he moved to New York City and began working with filmmaker George Butler. He is credited as producer, creative consultant and editor on The Good Fight, a feature-length documentary about the Florida State Seminoles's football coach Bobby Bowden released in 2007.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1046965/fullcredits#cast He is also credited for his field producing in the swamps of the southeastern US on another of Butler's films, the National Geographic documentary The Lord God Bird, about the recent re-discovery of the ivory-billed woodpecker.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1759682/fullcredits#cast In 2009, La Noue relocated to Durham, North Carolina where he founded the Mascot Gallery. In 2012, he opened an art studio and exhibition space on Main Street. He is married to Elisabeth Haviland James, a documentary filmmaker.  Paintings and prints  La Noue credits the beginning of his art career to living in Europe as part of Notre Dame's study abroad program in Angers, France. He studied art history and European politics at the language-intensive Universit√© Catholique de l'Ouest, an hour's train ride from the museums of Paris. He also sought out smaller, less crowded museums where he could sit with the works of the French Impressionist painters. The sketches and preliminary paintings of Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin and Picasso, often just charcoal on scraps of paper, impressed upon La Noue the power of a well-executed line and subtle pairing of color.  The Mascot Gallery  La Noue's best known collection is the Mascot Gallery print series, a set of figurative and impressionistic images that tell the stories of American icons. He began his work on the histories and traditions behind mascots with \\"The Original Fighting Irish Print Series\\", exploring the cultural significance of the Fighting Irish, the mascot of his undergraduate alma mater. Head Notre Dame football coach Brian Kelly has said of \\"The Original Fighting Irish\\" that it captures the swagger and toughness that defines the school's athletic program. \\"It's about a humility, it's about a work ethic,\\" Head Notre Dame lacrosse coach Kevin Corrigan has said, \\"...and I think he captured all of that in a painting that we really take to heart\\". In 2011, La Noue was commissioned by Western Michigan University to create an entry representing their mascot, the Broncos, for the 2011 ArtPrize competition. He created a 6,500-square-foot mesh wrap around the Western Michigan University-Grand Rapids Graduate Building that depicts a fifty-foot tall herd of horses flanking a rearing central horse whose face is patterned like the western half of the state of Michigan. The original artwork for \\"Epic Broncos\\" was created using paint, charcoal and pastels before being scanned, printed on a 2-ton mesh canvas, and hung with construction lifts. La Noue interviewed the university president, athletic directors, deans, alumni, coaches and dozens of other university officials to understand the significance of the Bronco to the University. Western Michigan University described the collaboration as an opportunity for the college to \\"do the defining\\" of its own story.  Techniques and processes  Much of La Noue's work mixes the formal principles of figurative and impressionistic art, with stylization inspired by film noir, comic book art and the avant-garde. He uses drawings, paintings, and photography to add texture to his film work and often studies motion picture and photography to create movement in his paintings and prints. He frequently employs a gicl√©e printing technique to create master images from layers of microscopic digital scans of his mixed media works on paper.  Photography  In 2012, La Noue opened his first private show at his Durham gallery. Lady Buenos Aires: Portrait of a City in Abstract Symmetry consisted of twenty images of Buenos Aires, Argentina, including a set of \\"quadrographs\\", or single photographs rotated and repeated to create kaleidoscopic, abstract portraits. In addition to the quadrographs, La Noue created a series distinctively layered prints portraying the city \\"as a woman\\" preparing for a night of tango ritual. His most recent collection of quadrographs, Detroit in Abstract Symmetry, will debut at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum as part of the 2012 ArtPrize competition.http://www.artprize.org/revere-la-noue/2012/detroit-in-abstract- symmetry  Film  La Noue has done creative work on large feature productions, directed and produced several short films, and regularly consults on an array of movie projects. Alongside Martin Scorsese, he was a creative advisor on the 2011 HBO documentary The Loving Story. His short documentary Harvest was made in collaboration with the ALS Association, and continues to be used to lobby the United States Congress in support of stem cell research. Portrait of a Glitch, his short experimental documentary film, premiered nationally at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive and is screened in genomics classes at the Stanford University School of Medicine. http://lightrainmedia.com/FILM.html La Noue wrote and directed a satirical documentary Stanford Banned about the controversial Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band. The film premiered at the Ivy Film Festival and is screened annually during Stanford's reunion weekend.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmq4HJTO1Rs  References   External links  *Mascot Gallery Living people 1976 births American filmmakers Artists from Baltimore University of Notre Dame alumni Stanford University alumni Businesspeople from Durham, North Carolina ","title":"Revere La Noue"},{"id":"36499919","text":"Shen Xiaoying (born 2 March 1983) is a Chinese sailor who competed in the 2004 Summer Olympics.

Anderton, Swiss Build Mobile Anti-Aircraft Missile, Aviation Week, June 30, 1958. Test firings were made in Switzerland and Italy in 1958, and Japan placed a small order for training purposes, but the missile was not produced in high numbers. The missile system was developed from the earlier RSA Missile developed by the same companies. Design and development Contraves-Oerlikon started design work on guided missiles to supplement their anti-aircraft guns, like the popular 20 mm cannon, in 1947. The company produced a number of designs, including the RSA, culminating in the RSD 58 of 1958. The RSD 58 was a liquid- fuelled rocket-powered missile, guided to its target by riding a radar beam. The missile body was made of wrapped tubing and sheet with Araldite bonding while the wings were of sandwich construction. Targeting was by search radar and beam transmitter with targets tracked by a search radar until a beam riding transmitter locked on, at which point the missile could be fired, riding the beam until impact, proximity fuze or radio signal detonation. Launchers, slaved to the beam transmitter could launch missiles at any angle form 10¬∞ to 90¬∞ at a sustained rate of fire of up to two launches per minute. Control of the missiles was by vectoring rocket motor combustion chamber at launch and controllable rear fins at higher speeds. The complete system included a battery command post, target tracking radar, guidance beam transmitter and six twin railed trainable launchers and four diesel generator units. The components were carried on single-axle trailers apart from the diesel generators that were built on two-axle trailers. The entire system, including the launchers, was readily transportable to new locations with mobility claimed to be similar to that of a heavy anti-aircraft gun system. A parachute recoverable training round, the RSC-57, was developed which was powered by a reduced burn time rocket motor with the recovery parachute replacing the warhead. Operational use There were no significant orders, except for the delivery of a training battery to Japan. The Swiss Air Force instead used the British Bristol Bloodhound. A twin launcher with two missiles and a trailer-mounted radar as used in the system is now at the Full Military Museum and another launcher with two missiles ca be found in the Aviation Museum in D√ºbendorf. From 1959, the RSD system was further developed into the RSE, which was also unsuccessfully offered for export under as the Micon.

Many Japanese restaurants, both in Japan and abroad, specialize in this style of food preparation. Traditionally, the food consists of a combination of morsels of seafood and vegetables, but other kinds of food that are suitable for grilling may also be offered. The robata cooking style is different from other Japanese charcoal cooking in that it uses a wide, flat open fireplace in the style of an irori, rather than a shichirin or other type of charcoal cooking implement. History Robata originates from a centuries-old country style of cooking by northern Japanese fishermen around a communal hearth () that serves as a cooking area and a source of heat, found on the northernmost island of Japan, Hokkaido. The fishermen needed a way to cook on the boats, so they encased binch≈çtan coals in a stone box to protect the boat from the intense heat. After a government campaign depicting Hokkaido as an idyllic rustic area, this style of cooking became popular all over Japan. The first robata restaurant (named \\"Robata\\") opened in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture. Proving a successful formula, soon more robata restaurants followed, starting in Osaka. As of 1965, there were more than 10,000 such restaurants across the country. In the fishermen's town of Kushiro on Hokkaido, now many restaurants specialize in this style of cuisine. The Fuki-ya restaurant once owned by Junko and Richard K. Diran in the Japan Center (San Francisco) is said to have been the first robatayaki restaurant in the United States. Cultural connotations While the setup varies, a common arrangement has the grill in a central position, whether as a hearth in a sandpit as for the traditional irori, or on a raised dais, around which the customers are seated. In Japan, where the robata restaurant is often also a male-dominated drinking establishment (izakaya), this evokes a highly prized nostalgic feeling among the clientele.

Born in Blairsville, Pennsylvania, McClure graduated from Westminster College, New Wilmington, Pennsylvania. He began teaching in Khartoum, Sudan in 1928, returning to the United States three years later to study at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary. After graduation and ordination in 1934, McClure and his wife, Lyda, began work in Doleib Hill, Sudan with the Shulla people. During this time, McClure began to question the traditional missionary approach to indigenous people. McClure was convinced that a large staff employed for a limited time would result in a self- sustaining, self-governing, self-propagating church. In 1938 he initiated a new mission with the Anuak people at Akobo on the Sudan-Ethiopia border. A team of specialists in education, agriculture, medicine and evangelism were expected to work for 15 years. Although never fully staffed and interrupted by World War II, the Akobo mission became so successfully established that in 1950 the McClures were able to open new work among the Anuaks in the Ethiopian village of Pokwo. By 1960, McClure was directing a third station at Gilo River while serving in Addis Ababa as the general secretary of the American Presbyterian Mission. Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I, who had long supported McClure's pioneering work, requested that the American mission replicate the Anuak project among Somali nomads in the Somali border town of Gode, Ethiopia. The American Presbyterian mission declined to support this new cooperative venture between church and state, so Don and Lyda McClure began by themselves with the help of their longtime mission supporters.Partee (1990), pp. 395, 398‚Äì400. McClure was shot and killed by guerrillas in Gode on March 27, 1977. Don McClure was the first entrant in the book of Presbyterian martyrs.Commissioner's Resolution 26-87. On Establishing a Book of Presbyterian Martyrs, page 872, Book 1, minutes of the 199th General Assembly (1987) of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) The biography of Don McClure called \\"Adventure in Africa\\" by Charles Partee has been out of print since the early 1990s, is now available in an electronic version. Family and Early life W. Don McClure was the third child born into a family of four boys and three girls. His mother, Margaret McNaugher, held a college chair of Greek and Latin before her marriage to Robert Elmer McClure. Rev. McClure served his entire fifty-five year career in the United Presbyterian Church in a single pastorate in Blairsville, PA. Don's interest in an ageless, hardy adventuresome life came from his father, who went on a big game hunt with Don at the age of 70 and hunted the woods of Pennsylvania past his 91st birthday. Ministry =Khartoum (1928-1931)= McClure's American Presbyterian denomination had been working along the lower Nile in Egypt for several decades when the mission was requested to establish an outpost in Sudan. At loose ends after college, McClure joined the Khartoum mission and found himself working in unfocused helpfulness as a teacher, agriculturalist, unlicensed physician, veterinarian, part-time evangelist, big-game hunter, and full-time handyman. He also found his life's companion, Lyda Lake Boyd. They married in 1932 and together they decided to return to Sudan as missionary husband and wife.Partee (1990), pp. 24‚Äì45. =Doleib Hill (1934-1938)= After seminary, the McClures returned to Africa in 1934 and were assigned to live among the Shulla people in South Sudan (a.k.a. Shilluks). In this outpost, the McClures served their apprenticeship in frontier evangelism, agriculture, animal husbandry, rudimentary medicine, building construction, education, the languages and cultures of black Africa, and survival in primitive conditions involving almost daily encounters with lions, crocodiles, elephants, and hippos.Partee (1990), pp. 61‚Äì173. =The Anuak Project (1938-1962)= The Anuak people straddle the border between Western Ethiopia and Sudan. In the 1930s, the American Mission had been discussing a mission among the Anuaks for two decades, but the normal cost to establish a mission station was $20,000 (~$150,000 in 2009 dollars). Don and Lyda were willing to inaugurate the work among the Anuak people using locally-obtainable materials (with the exception of screen wire for windows). Therefore, in 1937, the McClures established their station in Akobo for $1,000.Partee (1990), pp. 141‚Äì142. Don was a dynamic speaker and fundraiser. Pictures, Super 8 film, reel-to-reel audio and tape cassettes combined to give an overview of Don's ministry. Akobo (1938-1950) McClure estimated the Anuak population at 60,000, with 20,000 living in Sudan and 40,000 living in Ethiopia. Although the majority of Anuaks lived in Ethiopia, and their king lived in a village called Gok on the Ethiopian side, the Italian occupation of Ethiopia required the McClures to start their work in Sudan at the periphery of the tribe.Partee (1990), p. 144. Pokwo (1950-1962) Don McClure's Anuak Project was inaugurated at Akobo and came to an end at the Gilo River station, but its fullest and deepest expression was at Pokwo. McClure secured an audience and the personal interest and permission of His Imperial Majesty, Haile Selassie I, to continue work in Ethiopia. At Pokwo (in Anuak \\"village of life\\"), McClure was at the height of his powers in evangelism, agriculture, pioneer education, and primitive medicine as well as wisdom in combating superstition, especially witchdoctors. After some years, McClure reported that the Christian gospel had been preached in every Anuak village. In some villages, as many as fifty Christians held regular services and at least one new Christian lived in nearly every village. Ten percent of the Anuaks were now literate and a few books, including the New Testament, had been printed in their language. Poultry and cattle were improved; fruit trees were multiplying and more than half of the people had been treated in the medical clinics.Partee (1990), p. 316. The mission at Pokwo was nearly self-sustaining, so McClure prepared to start a new work on the Gilo River. Gilo River (1960-1962) The Gilo River station was near the center of the Anuak tribe and where McClure had once hoped to begin his service. Now he expected to spend his final years there. The plan remained the same: a large group of specialists (in evangelism, education, agriculture, and medicine) deployed for a short period of time. Among his most creative ideas, McClure challenged young American men and women to volunteer a year of service in Africa without pay. In return, he provided them room, board, and plenty of work, which on the isolated and virtually inaccessible Gilo River meant first hacking an airstrip out of the forest. Among the early volunteers were the McClures' son, Don Jr., and daughter, Lyda. By this time, the church established at Gilo could be served by a trained Anuak pastor. No cattle could be raised at Gilo because it was an area that suffered from trypanosomiasis, or African sleeping sickness. =Addis Ababa (1962-1970)= As his church's senior missionary in Ethiopia, McClure was requested to become the administrative head of the American Mission representing and facilitating all its activities in Ethiopia. Exchanging field service for desk work, McClure dealt with the various ministries of the government, cultivated relations between various political and ecclesiastical factions, and tried to continue the expansion on the Gilo River, which was only a day's walk from the Sudan border and had become extremely dangerous because of the civil war in South Sudan. Because of his work with the United Nations Committee of Refugee Relief, McClure was classified as an enemy of the Sudanese nation.Partee (1990), p. 351. When the war caused the deportation of all Christian missionaries, Sudan asked all neighboring countries to refuse them entry. However, due to McClure's persistence, a single exception was made for his old Sudanese colleagues who were able to continue their missionary work in East Africa. =Gode (1970-1977)= Don McClure, Tefara Worq and Haile Selassie Concerned with border disputes in the north with Eritrea, in the west with Sudan, and the east with Somalia, the Ethiopian government planned to build a model city on the banks of the Wabe Shebelle river about 150 miles from the Somali border. With the hope that warring nomads would become peaceful agriculturalists, Haile Selassie, in person, asked McClure (and his church) to supervise the medical and educational work in this new city called Gode. For all his previous projects in Ethiopia, McClure had asked for the Emperor's permission. Now he had to respond to a direct request, involving a cross country move, working with a new people, and speaking a different language. In addition, McClure was approaching mandatory retirement age. Still, he expected that he could get the Gode project firmly underway. Moreover, he thought his church had promised Ethiopia that a Christian mission would be established at Gode. On that basis, in that he had given his word to the Emperor, and when no move was made to implement the program by the church officials in New York, McClure felt honor bound to begin by himself. He began work in 1970, as an independent missionary retired from the American mission and funded independently. Death Letter sent home by Lyda and Don Jr. Describing the events of March 27, 1977 Don McClure's gravesite outside Gode, Ethiopia Photograph of marker placed on gravesite in 2001. McClure was killed by guerillas on March 27, 1977 in Gode, Ethiopia. With his son, Don Jr., he had flown to the Gode station five days earlier to make final arrangements to turn the station over to World Vision. Lyda McClure was also scheduled to go with them, but was pulled from the flight because of a high priority passenger. The SIM missionaries in K'elafo had been held hostage and then evacuated, landing in Gode long enough to recount their harrowing experiences. Don requested that Lyda charter a plane to fly them out, although that flight would not occur until the weekend.Partee (1990), p. 13. About 1:30 Sunday morning, Don Jr. heard noises from his father's bedroom. When he investigated, he found the house surrounded by armed men. Graeme Smith (World Vision) heard the noises from a nearby house and came over to investigate. Smith and the two McClures were taken out into the yard. After the houses were looted, the command was given to shoot. A blast of gunfire killed Don Sr., but Smith and Don Jr. were spared. The guerillas who had rounded up the rest of the Smith family, two World Vision nurses and two German technicians were confused by the gunfire and ran away. Don Sr. was buried in Gode, Ethiopia at 10 a.m. March 28, 1977. In the summer of 2000, Don McClure's grandson, Jonathan Partee (son of Margaret Jean), returned to Gode to find the simple metal cross bearing McClure's name had been removed. In 2001, a new marker was placed on the gravesite which reads: ::W. Don McClure ::Servant of God ::Born April 28, 1906 ::Died March 27, 1977 ::\\"He who does the will of God lives forever.\\" Honors 1977 Distinguished Alumni of Pittsburgh Theological Seminary (Class of 1934).

The attack was the first major military engagement in the war since 1988, as the Polisario Front had ended negotiations with Morocco in that year. The King of Morocco, Hassan II, responded to the offensive by rejecting a second meeting with POLISARIO leaders. According to the Spanish newspaper El Pa√≠s, at least a hundred soldiers from both sides were killed in the clashes.  Background  Western Sahara was a Spanish colony until 1975, when it was the last colonial province in Africa. A war erupted between those countries and the Sahrawi Polisario Front, which proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) with a government-in-exile in Tindouf, Algeria. Mauritania withdrew in 1979, and Morocco eventually secured control of most of the territory, including all the major cities and natural resources. Armed conflict continued between Polisario and Morocco over prominence in the region, with Algerian support for Polisario and American, French and Saudi Arabian support for Morocco. The U.N. peace mission that aimed for a ceasefire and a referendum was accepted in various degrees by both combatants. The war was fought at a moment when Polisario felt that the second peace talks were deliberately delayed by King Hassan of Morocco. As a result, the peace talks were never held.  Battle  After Morocco built fortified sand walls in the northwestern border towards Western Sahara, the Polisario Front responded by attacking the Moroccan base at Guelta Zemmour. While Polisario was advancing during most of the offensive, Morocco eventually overpowered them with superior numbers and equipment. Morocco maintained the wall, Polisario left 18 tanks and other armored vehicles destroyed by Gazelle helicopters on the field.

Because of the chromatic aberration of the eye, the shorter wavelengths (green) are focused in front of the longer red wavelengths. Testing The patient is asked to compare the clarity of the letters on the green and the red side. If the letters of the green side are clearer +0.25 D sphere is added and if the letters on the red side are clearer -0.25 D sphere is added. With optimal spherical correction, the letters on the red and green halves of the chart appear equally clear. Because this test is based on chromatic aberration and not on color discrimination, it is used even with people having color vision deficiency. The eye with overactive accommodation may still require too much minus sphere in order to balance the red and green. Cycloplegia may be necessary. The duochrome test is not used with patients whose visual acuity is worse than 20/30 (6/9), because the 0.50 D difference between the 2 sides is too small to distinguish.

From left: Ludwig Wolff head of Deutscher Volksverband from ≈Å√≥d≈∫, from Katowice, gauleiter Josef Wagner, mayor from Bielsko-Bia≈Ça, obergruppenfuhrer Werner Lorenz, senator Erwin Hasbach from Ciechocinek, baron from Wielkopolska, Weiss from Jarocin. Deutscher Volksverband in Polen (DVV), or the German People's Union in Poland, was a Nazi German extreme right-wing political party founded in 1924 in central Poland by members of the ethnic German minority who did not wish to join the minority bloc in the Polish parliament Sejm. DVV was headed by August Utta, and financially supported by the Reich Ministry of Finance. Deutscher Volksverband was most active in the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Tomasz√≥w area. The German Foreign Ministry aggressively supported the DVV Party through its own consulate in Poland for a number of reasons, one of them being the presence of the explicitly pro-Polish Deutscher Kultur‚Äì und Wirtschaftsbund (DKWB) organization in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, which was critical of the revisionist Weimar government. DVV members denounced the \\"Lodzer Mensch\\" from the DKWB as puppets of the Polish government collaborating with the Jews and committing high treason against the German Reich. In 1935 August Utta was replaced by Ludwig Wolff, a committed Nazi.  Operation  By the late 1930s, the whole of Poland was covered by ethnic German organizations supported financially by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Third Reich. The Deutscher Volksverband (DVV) membership grew to over 25,000 participants in 1937. It was helped by emissaries arriving in Poland from Germany and commanded by Abwehr, with the aim of establishing the so-called 5th column among the Volksdeutsche, as well as any willing colonists, including the Mennonites. By 1938, all local structures of the DVV were formed. Many members of the DVV became German partisans during the 1939 invasion of Poland according to research. They were treated as an integral part of the German foreign policy towards the Polish state. Just before the outbreak of war, in the Powi≈õle neighbourhood of Warsaw, a massive propaganda campaign was carried out by the members of Deutscher Volksverband directed by German agent Aleks Nipie, trying to convince young Poles to join the Wehrmacht. The DVV community leaders were asked to register people into the Deutsche Volksliste without proof of origin; all that they needed was a declaration, confirmed by a witness. The action was most successful among peasants, as educated Polish Germans did not want to be affiliated with Adolf Hitler. The new Volksdeutsche were trained to guide the Luftwaffe aircraft towards a desired target with mirrors. In Inowroc≈Çaw, an ethnic German was spotted fastening big mirrors to a chimney on a roof of his dog pound. In the city of Toru≈Ñ for example, during the first days of war about a dozen people were arrested and executed for signalling German reconnaissance planes with mirrors and flags. The courses in sabotage were conducted with the promise of receiving property in Poland (as in Gliwice), but also in Wroc≈Çaw, Bielsko, Katowice, Zabrze and Rybnik. It is estimated that up to 20,000 ethnic Germans living in Poland belonged to organizations involved in sabotage actions, including Deutscher Volksbund in Silesia, Deutscher Volksverbarid in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ area, Deutsche Vereinigung in Pomerania and Jungdeutsche Partei across the entire country.

It was released on September 7, 2012.  Plot  In early 1980s Soviet Union, young Misha Galkin looks up at the night sky and sees the stars shift into a cow-shaped constellation which turns to look at him. Moments later, he is struck by lightning. A woman who examines him after comments that he will have an interesting life. Over the following years, Misha uses his natural skills to become an important marketing executive, receiving his big break when he meets Bob Gibbons, an American hired to spread Western brands in post-Communist Russia. When Bob's niece, Abby, visits from America, she and Misha begin a relationship against Bob's wishes. They discuss the history of modern marketing, which Misha claims was invented by Vladimir Lenin, and Communism as the first true global brand. Meanwhile, on a private Polynesian island, an unnamed marketing guru meets with fast food company executives to discuss a plan to make the industry profitable again. They plan to change public perceptions of beauty and \\"make fat the new fabulous.\\" Misha is hired to promote a new reality TV show, \\"Extreme Cosmetica\\", in which an overweight woman will undergo plastic surgery to become thin. After the first operation, the woman falls into a coma and the public turns against the show, as well as the glorification of thin body types. Misha becomes the scapegoat for the failed project and is swarmed by protesters before being beaten by police and arrested. Upon his release from jail, he confronts Bob; Misha has realized that the show and the woman's coma were orchestrated by fast food companies, such as \\"The Burger\\". Bob denies the accusations, claiming that such a plan would require too many resources. Misha and Bob fight and Bob has a heart attack. Feeling guilty for his role in the fate of the \\"Extreme Cosmetic\\" contestant, Misha leaves Moscow and withdraws from modern society; he believes his marketing powers are a curse. Over the next six years, the \\"fat is fabulous\\" campaign is successful; most people are overweight and advertising images now focus on this change in perception of the ideal body type. Misha dreams that he performs the Red Heifer ritual, sacrificing a red cow and bathing in its ashes. When he wakes, he discovers that he can see strange creatures that appear to be the embodiment of marketing brand desires. They cling to people's necks and no one except for Misha can see them. Abby tracks Misha to a rural community where he lives as a simple cowherd. She takes Misha to her Moscow apartment where she reveals that Bob left her a substantial inheritance and that she and Misha have a six-year-old son, who is overweight and loves many junk food brands. Misha‚Äîdistressed by his visions and disgusted with the rampant commercialism around him‚Äîimpulsively destroys Abby's apartment. Abby is frightened by this behavior and leaves, taking their son with her. Misha plans to fight the branding creatures by using their own methods. He returns to his old company and uses fear based marketing to make customers turn on the world's major brands, beginning with an anti-beef scare that turns people away from \\"The Burger\\" and towards a vegetarian Chinese restaurant chain, \\"Dim Song\\". Branding creatures fight and destroy each other throughout the city. Public opinion turns against marketing in general and the Russian parliament considers banning all advertising. Alone in his office, Misha leaves a phone message for Abby, asking for her forgiveness. Abby arrives at his office but the building is suddenly raided by anti-advertising protesters who assault the employees in the building. Misha is struck in the head as he attempts to escape with Abby. An emergency broadcast on television states that Russia and other nations have agreed to ban advertising as Misha lays on the floor, bleeding. Some time later, Misha wakes in the hospital and plays with Abby and their son. In the same hospital, the \\"Extreme Cosmetica\\" woman awakens from her coma and wanders into the streets to see an advertisement-free Moscow and a skyline free of billboards.
