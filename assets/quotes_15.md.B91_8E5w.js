Playing career Keene graduated from Oregon State University in 1921, where he was a pitcher on the baseball team, and was chosen as team captain in his junior year. Coaching career After graduating from Oregon State, Keene signed on with Willamette University's athletic department, where he coached three sports: football for 17 years, baseball for 16 years, and basketball for 11 years. Combined, Keene's teams won or shared 19 Northwest Conference championships, and in the 1929‚Äì30 academic year, each of his three teams were undefeated and won conference championships. Keene is considered the \\"father of Willamette athletics\\" and was a charter member of the University's Athletic Hall of Fame in 1991. =Attack on Pearl Harbor= On December 6, 1941, Keene's Willamette football team was in Honolulu, Hawaii, where they lost a game to Hawaii, 20‚Äì6. The following day, the players and fans had intended to do some sightseeing around Hawaii, but instead, were witness to Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. The players, now stranded in Hawaii, were enlisted to string barbed wire on Waikiki Beach and were given rifles and assigned to protect the beach and later the hills above Honolulu. Keene, along with future Oregon governor Douglas McKay, who had traveled with the football team, finally arranged passage home for the players on December 19 on an overloaded luxury liner, the SS President Coolidge. The team arrived in San Francisco on Christmas Day after taking a circuitous route to avoid Japanese submarines. In 1997, the entire team was inducted into Willamette's Athletic Hall of Fame. Return to Oregon State Following World War II, in 1947, Keene returned to Oregon State to serve as athletic director. He served in that post for 26 years, the longest tenure of any Oregon State athletic director. During his term, he oversaw construction of the University's two major sports facilities: Gill Coliseum in 1949 and Parker Stadium (later renamed Reser Stadium) in 1953. Keene was President of the Pacific Coast Conference Athletics Directors Association and served on the executive committee of the NCAA. Legacy In 1989, Willamette University built a new baseball stadium, which they named Roy S. \\"Spec\\" Keene Stadium. In addition to the Willamette University Athletic Hall of Fame, Keene was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1982 for his coaching, and the Oregon State University Sports Hall of Fame in 1991 for his service as athletic director.

In 1945 Dooley enlisted in the Irish Guards and became a piper in the regiment's band. At one point he went absent without leave, joined the Palestine Liberation Organization and subsequently served a prison sentence for his absence. After leaving the army, Dooley worked as a cleaner at Saint Martin's School of Art in London and enrolled in a drawing class at the Whitechapel Art Gallery. He became a student at St Martin's in 1953. Dooley had his first exhibition at the Gallery of the same name in 1962. Having decided he wanted to be a sculptor, he left London for Liverpool and set up a tiny studio and to support himself financially, he worked in the Dunlop Rubber Factory at Speke. In 1956, he set up a studio in Slater St where he began to sculpt in earnest. An early notable work was the fifteen Stations of the Cross in St Mary's RC Church, Leyland. Works Dooley's medium was usually scrap metal or bronze. He sculpted mainly religious works including the Risen Christ in the Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral, Redemption (a collaborative work with Ann McTavish) in Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral, The Resurrection of Christ at Princes Park Methodist Church in Toxteth and a Madonna and Child at St Faith's Church in Crosby and a sculpture entitled Splitting the Atom (depicting the creation of the atomic bomb) at Daresbury Laboratory, Cheshire. He also produced a tribute to The Beatles in Mathew Street, Liverpool, depicting The Madonna and The Beatles with the tribute Four lads who shook the world. For the, now closed, Church of the Resurrection, Gatehouse of Fleet, Kirkcudbrightshire, 1971, Dooley created a metal sculpture of The Resurrected Christ on the sanctuary wall and a sculpture of Our Lady. One of his notable works Dachau is in Gallery Oldham. In honour of a famous union dispute he made \\"The Fisher Bendix Tree\\" which included some parts from old radiators. This was purchased by Oldham Art Gallery but was never displayed. It was reportedly last seen rusting away in the yard of the gallery during the 1980s. Dooley was a subject of the television programme This Is Your Life in February 1970 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. His studio in Liverpool was notoriously untidy, and is reportedly untouched since his death. Manchester Martyrs To commemorate the 1967 centenary of the execution of the Manchester Martyrs, the Manchester Connolly Association commissioned Dooley to produce a memorial sculpture to stand on the site of New Bailey prison in Salford, where the martyrs had been hanged. There was opposition to the proposal, and it seems that the sculpture was never made, let alone installed. Dooley did however produce a foot-high maquette which now forms part of the collection of the Working Class Movement Library in Manchester. The maquette suggests that the memorial was to consist of a granite base with three standing steel pillars with attached Celtic shields each bearing a martyr's name as well as some detail of the event's significance. The maquette was donated to the WCML in 2011 by the family of Jud Cooper who had been given the maquette by Dooley. La Pasionaria La Pasionaria statue in Glasgow, Scotland Dolores Ib√°rruri, La Pasionaria, served as inspiration to Dooley who was commissioned in 1974 by the International Brigade Association of Scotland to create a monument commemorating the 2,100 British volunteers of the International Brigade, the men and women who joined the republican forces in the Spanish Civil War in their fight against Franco's nationalist and fascist rebels. The monument's inscription is dedicated to the 534 volunteers who died in the conflict, 65 of them from Glasgow, where the monument is situated. The statue was funded by money raised by Trade Unionists and Labour movement supporters. However, the ¬£3000 raised was insufficient for the statue to be cast in bronze. Instead, an armature was welded together from scrap iron and covered in fibreglass. The final version of the monument is a stylised female figure, representing Dolores Ibarruri, in a long dress, standing with legs apart and arms raised. On the plinth, Dooley carved Dolores' famous slogan ‚Äì 'better to die on your feet than live forever on your knees'. The phrase was first used by the Mexican revolutionary leader, Emiliano Zapata, but Ibarruri gave it new meaning when she used it during the miners strike in Asturias, Spain, in 1934. Over time, the B listed statue fell into extremely poor condition and this generated criticism from the public, elected officials and trades unionists. A restoration project was carried out between April and August 2010 and the monument was re-dedicated on 23 August 2010 by Leader of the Council, Bailie Gordon Matheson, and General Secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, Grahame Smith, in the presence of Thomas Watters, 97, a surviving International Brigade veteran. Watters was a veteran of the Scottish Ambulance Unit, which worked at the front line on the battlefields of Spain to aid wounded fighters and volunteers from across the world.

First-year composition (sometimes known as first-year writing, freshman composition or freshman writing) is an introductory core curriculum writing course in American colleges and universities. This course focuses on improving students' abilities to write in a university setting and introduces students to writing practices in the disciplines and professions.Duffy, John. \\"Essay on the Value of First-year Writing Courses.\\" Inside Higher Ed. March 16, 2012. These courses are traditionally required of incoming students, thus the previous name, \\"Freshman Composition.\\" Scholars working within the field of composition-rhetoric often have teaching first-year composition (FYC) courses as the practical focus of their scholarly work. FYC courses are structured in a variety of ways. Some institutions of higher education require only one term of FYC, while others require two or three courses. There are a number of identifiable pedagogies associated with FYC, including: current-traditional, expressivist, social- epistemic, process, post-process and Writing about Writing (WAW). Each of these pedagogies can generate a multitude of curricula. Composition professionals, including those with degrees in Writing Studies and Rhetoric and Composition, often focus on a rhetorical approach to help students learn how to apply an understanding of audience, purpose, context, invention, and style to their writing processes. This rhetorical approach has shown that real writing, rather than existing as isolated modes, has more to do with a writer choosing from among many approaches to perform rhetorical tasks. In addition to a focus on rhetoric, many first year composition courses also emphasize writing process, where students are encouraged to interact with classmates and receive feedback to be used for revision. These practices can take the form of essay peer review or workshopping. Portfolios are a common way of assessing revised student work.\\"Principles and Practices in Electronic Portfolios.\\" Conference on College Composition and Communication, 2007. History Since the late nineteenth century, college courses on composition have become increasingly common in American higher education.Crowley, Sharon. Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays. Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press: 1998. The German model of \\"rigorous 'scientific' philology and historical criticism\\" influenced instruction that caused the research paper to become a staple in first-year composition. Although a longstanding course offering at many colleges, first-year composition remains controversial and marginalized.Miller, Susan. Textual Carnivals: The Politics of Composition. Carbondale and Edwardsville, IL: Southern Illinois University Press, 1991.Holbrook, Sue Ellen. \\"Women's Work: The Feminizing of Composition.\\" Rhetoric Review 9(2) 1991: 201‚Äì229. =First-year requirement debate= The requirement for a first-year composition course has been debated in composition studies. This debate centers around how effective the first- year composition course is and the changes that need to be made to develop the field of composition. While most schools do require some form of the first- year composition course, there are some schools that have decided to abolish the first-year composition requirement. Some scholars, such as Sharon Crowley in Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays, argue that this requirement should be abolished. Crowley does not suggest the course itself be removed, only the requirement that all freshmen take the course. She states that students would still be interested in the course if the requirement was abolished and that removing the requirement would strengthen the field of composition. She implies that composition studies is marginalized within the university because of the view of the first-year composition course as a skill course. Removing the requirement, she states, would remove the association of composition studies with introductory courses, giving more acknowledgement to the field. Crowley, Sharon. Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1998. pg 241‚Äì43. Print. Crowley's opinion initiated a debate in the composition field, but she is not the only critic who advocates for the removal of this requirement. Scholars Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle also dislike the requirement and instead argue for a writing studies curriculum.Downs, Douglas and Elizabeth Wardle. Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions: (Re)Envisioning 'First-Year Composition' as 'Introduction to Writing Studies. College Composition and Communication. 58.4 (2007) 552‚Äì584. Web. Other scholars, however, do not agree with this stance. They argue that the first-year composition course is needed in the university, and believe that the requirement should remain. Scholar David Smit is one critic who favors keeping the requirement. He suggests that the requirement can be kept and the curriculum and structure of the first-year composition course altered for improvement. Smit explains that many of the developmental goals of those who favor abolishing the requirement can still be achieved by offering more writing experiences. He proposes more genre writing in composition courses with a \\"scaffolding\\" progression of discipline writing. If this was done, he suggests, the concerns over the status of composition studies in the university would still be solved, as the course would no longer be seen as skills based. Smit, David. The End of Composition Studies. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 2004. pg 183‚Äì85. Print. There has been no consensus reached in composition studies regarding the status of the first-year composition course requirement. The benefits of the course, as well as the drawbacks, continue to be debated and the scholars noted above are only a few of the voices and perspectives involved in this discussion. Despite the debate about the requirement, it remains in effect at a majority of universities. Structure of contemporary first-year composition First-year composition is designed to meet the goals for successful completion set forth by the Council of Writing Program Administrators. To reach these goals, students must learn rhetorical conventions, critical thinking skills, information literacy, and the process of writing an academic paper. While there is no American standard curriculum for first-year composition, curriculum is developed at several levels, including the state, institution, department, and writing program. = First-year composition and rhetoric = With the publication of James Kinneavy's Theory of Discourse in 1971, English departments began incorporating rhetoric into their composition classrooms.Clark, Irene. Concepts in Composition: Theory and Practice in the Teaching of Writing. Mahweh, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2003. p 6. In doing this, composition instructors have placed more emphasis on teaching audience analysis, Aristotle's rhetorical appeals (ethos, pathos, and logos), and teaching Kinneavy's modes of discourse. According to Brian Sutton in \\"Writing in the Disciplines, First-Year Composition, and the Research Paper\\", since 1980, there has been an increasing debate in academic circles as to whether the \\"generic\\" approach to writing in first year composition is useful for students whose future writing will be discipline specific.Sutton, Brian. \\"Writing in the Disciplines, First-Year Composition, and the Research Paper.\\" Language and Learning Across the Disciplines 2.1 (1997) 46‚Äì57. Web. =Basic writing= First described by Mina Shaughnessy in the 1970s, basic writing is a division of composition studies that strives to bring disadvantaged students entering college to a more complete understanding of the rhetorical aspects of the writing process.Otte, George, and Rebecca Mlynarczyk. \\"Brief: Basic Writing.\\" National Council of Teachers of English. 2009.  Approaches  There are a number of different composition theories and pedagogies that educators use to teach first-year composition. The second edition of A Guide to Composition Pedagogies identifies 17 different composition pedagogies, a few of which that relate to first-year composition are summarized below: = Genre = Genre pedagogy is meant to focus the student's attention on the purpose of a given piece of text, through the lens of genre. Some perspectives favor instruction on the specific traits of a given established genre, particularly for those who are learning English as a second language. Others espouse the view that students should learn to identify elements of writing‚Äîstyle and conventions, for example‚Äîwhich denote its usefulness in a given setting as genre elements and know when to use them appropriately. Another form of genre pedagogy involves evaluating the characteristics of given genres, including the sensibilities they instantiate and which individuals or perspectives are excluded by them. = Literature and composition = Literature and composition, as an approach to teaching, is premised upon the integration of literature as the content for a composition course. Literature is strategically threaded through the writing course providing learners with in-depth comprehensive information, empowering their contribution to a variety of literary conversations. In this approach, literature provides learners with a plethora of opportunities for the development of writing skills including topics for debates, arguments, discussions, and general exploration of humanity. Discourses for discovery with this methodology are inclusive of gender, race, ethnicity, culture, feminism, social issues, politics, and religion. = Process = As the name suggests, process pedagogy utilizes classroom time by discussing the entire writing process. A class that implements process pedagogy aims to improve students' skills as writers by working in one or more groups on brainstorming, revising, proofreading, and \\"workshopping\\" students' work before they submit a final draft. After first-year composition students will have learned strategies for the skills. Before submitting a final successful draft students would complete multiple drafts. Through the use of process pedagogy, the students' own writing acts as a text for the class which they use and learn from in order to become better writers. Some critics suggest that students will have trouble applying the skills they learned to other contexts. = Researched writing = The original purpose of assigning research papers in first-year composition was to assist students in developing research skills. Along with these skills came the emphasis of learning to incorporate sources to strengthen a paper's thesis. In recent years, a shift towards teaching information literacy skills and including multimedia has become more common in academia. Traditional research papers assigned to students have been on a decline since the 2000s, a survey from 2009 shows that 6% of research writing in first-year composition were traditional research papers while 94% were an alternative take.

History and design Scottish botanist David Douglas, the first scientific traveller to visit the Arrow Lakes, wrote about the Sinixt People in his 1827 journal: The sturgeon-nosed canoe was designed with a reversed prow to be most suitable for travel through bulrushes, and maneuverable in turbulent waters. Author Eileen Delehanty Pearkes records in her book about the Sinixt, The Geography of Memory, that ethnographer William Elmendorf recorded the process of making a sturgeon-nosed canoe based on a description by Sinixt Nation elder Nancy Wynecoop: \\"The mature tree must be felled in spring, when the sap is running. The outer bark is scraped off, then the inner bark is split and peeled off the heartwood in one sheet. The outside shape of the canoe is marked on the ground with stakes. Poles used for the gunwales are fastened to these stakes. Next, willow ribs are fastened to the gunwales, using willow bark twine. The bark is then sewn onto the ribs, using cedar root. An additional layer of bark is fastened less securely on to the outer side of the craft. All seams are glues with warm pine pitch. One the bow and stern of the canoe, the bark is folded over rings of willow. Extra layers are added for strength, shaped into a point, and sewn. A frame of woven poles is placed in the bottom of the canoe and covered with loose grass to sit on.\\"Pearkes 2001, p. 47. Elmendorf also refers to a ceremony, including dancing, fasting and sweatbathing, held by Sinixt men prior to the building of a new canoe. The purpose of the ceremony was to make the group \\"more agreeable with each other and focus their energy\\". The sturgeon-nose design is unique to North American canoes, but craft of similar design were discovered in the Amur River region of Siberia in the mid-19th century.CANOE - Canadian Online Explorer - Canada's news, sports, entertainment, finance and lifestyle siteThe Canoe in Canadian Cultures.

It is located on Avinguda del Marqu√®s de Mont-Roig and very close to Palau Municipal d'Esports de Badalona, the home arena of the professional basketball club Joventut de Badalona. It is served by TMB-operated Barcelona Metro lines L2 and L10, and Trambes√≤s route T5. History The first station in Gorg was opened on 22 April 1985, when Barcelona Metro line 4 opened its platforms with the extension of this line from La Pau to Pep Ventura stations. On 1 October 2003, the Barcelona Metro line 4 section from La Pau to Pep Ventura was transferred to Barcelona Metro line 2 and because of this change, the station was rehabilitated and adapted for disabled persons by installing escalators and elevators. On 8 September 2007, with the extension of Trambes√≤s network from Sant Adri√† de Bes√≤s to Badalona, Gorg stop was opened and became the terminus station of Trambes√≤s in Badalona. It was planned to open the station a few months earlier, but due to several complaints from neighbors to relocate the electric substation that feeds the line, its opening was delayed for several times. Until 15 June 2008, the station was served only by route T5, but with the opening of the branch via La Mina, route T6 began serving the station, allowing access to Sant Adri√† de Bes√≤s railway station from Gorg. Since 20 February 2012 and due to a restructuring of the network, route T6 no longer serves the station and instead of finishing in Gorg, it does it at Gl√≤ries. Barcelona Metro line 10 arrived at the station on 18 April 2010, with the opening of the line from this station to Bon Pastor. The President of the Generalitat presided the inauguration ceremony of the station and travelled from this station to Bon Pastor to inaugurate this new branch of the line in Badalona. The initial forecast was to open the station in 2004 and later in 2008, but given the setbacks did not become operational until 2010. Layout =Barcelona Metro= Line 2 Barcelona Metro line 2 station is located under the intersection of Avinguda del Marqu√®s de Mont-Roig and Antoni Bori street. The station has two accesses from the street, one situated on Alfons XIII Avenue and equipped with fixed stairs and an elevator, and the other one situated on Guifr√© street. Both accesses are joined in a same hall located in the central part of the station. The trains run on the lower level that consists of two tracks served by two 94 meter long side platforms. The lower level and the hall are linked by fixed stairs, escalators and elevators. Since April 2010 and because of the opening of the L10 station, on the Pep Ventura side some escalators and elevators were installed with the construction of an access to the L10 station. Line 10 Barcelona Metro line 10 station is located under the intersection of Avinguda del Marqu√®s de Mont-Roig and Pau Claris street. Unlike most L9/L10 stations, this station was not built using a well and was built using slurry walls at very shallow depths. The station has a single level and a single entrance from Alfons XII street, between Antoni Bori and Ponent streets. This access is equipped with fixed stairs, escalators and elevators, making the station accessible for disabled persons. This entrance leads to the main hall, situated at the end of the tracks where there is a TMB Control Center, ticket vending machines, the ticket gates and other facilities. There are two tracks served by a 108 meter long island platform where there are two groups of accesses that link it with each platform of the line 2 station independently. The architectural design of the station was designed by architect Alfons Soldevila Barbosa. =Trambes√≤s= Trambes√≤s stop is located on Avinguda del Marqu√®s de Mont-Roig, between Joaquim Ruyra and Pau Claris streets.

Soon thereafter, Castleman, Murphey, and bassist John London formed the 1960s pop group the Lewis & Clarke Expedition. They recorded a pop album in 1967 for Colgems, the label that also released The Monkees. Castleman and Murphey wrote \\"(What Am I Doin‚Äô) Hangin‚Äô Round,\\" which was recorded by the Monkees and featured on three episodes of their tv show.

As of July 2017, there are over 700 face-to-face meetings in 32 countries worldwide with the majority of these meetings occurring in the United States, Iran, India, Canada, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Australia, Russia and in various online community and social media platforms.. NicA maintains that total abstinence from nicotine is necessary for recovery. NicA defines abstinence as ‚Äúa state that begins when all use of nicotine ceases.  History  The first meetings began in February 1982 one on one meetings between a group of Southern California AA members to focus specifically on smoking cessation. These meetings began under the name Smokers Anonymous in Los Angeles. In June 1982 the founders, Rodger F, Robert K, Stephanie S, Dan H, began holding group meetings in Santa Monica California. Shortly thereafter another group independently started in San Francisco. In 1983, a Manhattan, New York group of meetings formed independently, also formed by recovering AA members, specifically to address their smoking addiction. They called themselves \\"AA for Non-Smokers\\". During the same period, two groups started in Cleveland, Ohio. Then in May 1985, Maurice Z., a California member, authored an article for Reader‚Äôs Digest. Thousands of letters poured in from people wanting to know more about this new Twelve-Step fellowship. That year Smokers Anonymous groups started independently in Woodstock, NY and in Islip, NY. Within a year there were a hundred meetings identified. In 1986 the group members met for their first conference in Bakersfield, California to form a fellowship, originally known as Smokers Anonymous. These groups met again in 1987 in Monterey, California. In April 1988, the fellowship‚Äôs first official World Services Conference was held in San Francisco. The fellowship was renamed Nicotine Anonymous in Phoenix, Arizona at the 1990 World Services Conference because the Smokers Anonymous trademark was not available, but also, importantly, the delegates decided the focus of recovery should be on the drug nicotine rather than any single nicotine delivery system. In 2000, \\"NicA\\" was selected to abbreviate Nicotine Anonymous at the annual World Service Conference.  Structure  Adapted with permission of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., the Twelve Traditions are utilized by Nicotine Anonymous as fundamental guiding principles. Nicotine Anonymous operates with an elected, all volunteer, nine member board of officers and a set of by-laws. The board meets regularly to discuss how to be of service to the organization including organizing its annual World Service Conference and monitoring a number of appointed committee coordinators and the Nicotine Anonymous World Service home office located in Dallas, TX. The office keeps regularly updated meeting lists, manages the website and its online store, distributes NicA literature and free Meeting Starter Kits, and serves as a resource for members or any interested nicotine user. There are no dues or fees for NicA membership, as stated in Tradition Three: \\"the only requirement for Nicotine Anonymous membership is a desire to stop using nicotine.\\"  Comparison  There are several commercial and nonprofit programs supporting smoking cessation programs in the United States. Low-cost options, in addition to Nicotine Anonymous, are sponsored by groups such as The American Cancer Society, The American Lung Association, The American Heart Association and The Seventh-day Adventist Church. Commercial programs include cognitive-behavioral group therapy, nicotine replacement therapies and bupropion. Combinations of these approaches, marketed in commercial packages such as Smokeless and Smoke Stoppers, are licensed to treatment providers and conducted on an inpatient or outpatient basis. These are in addition to local programs ran by regional treatment facilities. A weekly NicA meeting is ongoing and therefore unique among the array of treatment options because nicotine users and ex-nicotine users can enter and leave the process as they please. Most other treatment programs are structured as limited duration programs, with only a certain number of sessions, making it difficult for members to pick it up midway through or begin when a program is not being offered. In 1996, NicA ranked twelfth in size among the thirteen twelve-step organizations studied by Klaus Makela. Sponsorship and lifetime attendance is not emphasized as much as in other twelve-step programs. The average meeting size is about seven people. Although both drinking and smoking are recognized by many respondents as imposing burdens on the family, there are no auxiliary support groups for friends and family of smokers related to NicA; as Al-Anon meetings were created for friends and family members of alcoholics. Nicotine Anonymous World Services does, however, offer a pamphlet, Are You Concerned About Someone Who Smokes or Chews Tobacco? with information for friends and family of nicotine users.  Effectiveness  Success in achieving smoking abstinence using current smoking therapies such as Nicotine Anonymous, cognitive-behavioral group therapy, nicotine replacement therapies and bupropion (Zyban) ranges from 9% to 40% in different studies. Alcoholics and drug addicts have better smoking cessation success rates when attempting to quit smoking early in recovery. Combining psychosocial and pharmacological treatments increases smoking cessation success rates. Acupuncture, hypnosis, inpatient treatment, and Nicotine Anonymous have not been shown effective thus far. In a controlled study 205 alcoholics, with heavy tobacco dependence (an average of 26.8 cigarettes per day) and three months or more of continuous abstinence from drugs and alcohol, were placed at random in one of three treatment groups: an American Lung Association Quit Program plus Nicotine Anonymous meetings group, a behavioral counseling plus physical exercise group, or a behavioral counseling plus nicotine gum group. The effectiveness of the treatment programs was measured at post-treatment, six months, and twelve-months following post-treatment based on self-reports confirmed by confirmed biochemical and informant reports. Immediately following treatment the behavior counseling and exercise group had the highest quit percentage (60%) followed by the behavioral counseling plus nicotine gum group, with the ALA quit program plus NicA group at 31%. At the six-month follow up all groups had similar percentages of members maintaining abstinence from tobacco (29%, 27%, and 21%, respectively) and also at twelve-months (27%, 27%, and 26%, respectively). Out of all the participants, only 4% relapsed on alcohol or drugs. The alcohol relapse rate did not differ by treatment group.  Demographics  In a survey of 104 smokers (ages 18 and older) 78% reported they believed spiritual resources could be helpful in an attempt to quit smoking. In the same survey, male smokers, ages 31 and over, and females were found to be significantly more open to using spiritual resources in the smoking cessation process than controls. Heavy smokers, those smoking more than fifteen cigarettes per day, were also significantly more receptive to encouragement of spiritual resources in an attempt to quit. Alcoholics may have experienced twelve-step approaches to recovery and therefore may be more open to the possibility that same approach can be used to initiate and maintain abstinence from tobacco use. The first edition of Nicotine Anonymous: The Book published results of an internal survey of members showing that 25% of members responding to a survey on the topic reported they had prior twelve- step experience. Many smokers do not see group treatment as a potentially useful. Literature Nicotine Anonymous publishes eight books, sixteen pamphlets, two CDs, and one newsletter. Nicotine Anonymous: The Book explains the various principles of the Twelve Steps as they apply to nicotine addiction and includes testimonials from NicA members. Nicotine Anonymous Newcomer‚Äôs Booklet is a pocket sized booklet that answers common questions about the program and includes helpful tips. Nicotine Anonymous Step Study Workbook briefly discusses aspects of each Step and is followed by questions for the member to answer. Our Path to Freedom: Twelve Stories of Recovery includes testimonials from NicA members. 90 Days, 90 Ways has 90 daily meditations on topics related to recovery from nicotine addiction. A Year of Miracles has 366 daily meditations further expanding on topics related to recovery from nicotine addiction. The Twelve Traditions of Nicotine Anonymous (Extended Version) includes a complete copy of the explanations for all Twelve Traditions. Bylaws of Nicotine Anonymous has the rules and regulations for how Nicotine Anonymous World Services operates. The pamphlets provide information to new and prospective members, and include titles as follows: Introducing Nicotine Anonymous; To the Newcomer and Sponsorship in Nicotine Anonymous; Out Policy of Openness; How Nicotine Anonymous Works; Nicotine Anonymous the Program and the Tools; A Nicotine User's View of the Twelve Steps; The Serenity Prayer for Nicotine Users; Slogans to Help Us be Happy, Joyous, and Free Living Without Nicotine; Abstinence: What is it?; Tips for Gaining Freedom From Nicotine; Facing the Fatal Attraction; To the Dipper and Chewer; Our Promises; World Services, My intergroup, and Me; Introducing Nicotine Anonymous to the Medical Profession; Are You Concerned About Someone Who Smokes or Chews Tobacco? For the Friends and Family of Nicotine Addicts. Voices of NicA is a CD that has audio shares from members covering their experience, strength and hope in their nicotine recovery. There is also a CD with an audio content of Nicotine Anonymous: The Book and Our Path to Freedom. Seven Minutes is a quarterly newsletter used to keep members informed about developments within the organization and members‚Äô recovery contributions.  * Analysis A NicA pamphlet, Tips for Gaining Freedom from Nicotine, was reviewed in 1999 by a convenience sample of twelve professional colleagues of psychologist Edward Lichtenstein. These professionals were asked to review the cessation tips from the pamphlet and rate them on whether they were cognitive, behavioral, or neither. To that extent, they also rated how consistent the tips were with current cognitive-behavioral cessation techniques. It was found that many of the tips were very consistent with modern cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation treatment programs. The cognitive behavioral tips included setting dates, making commitments, planning things to keep one's mind off smoking, having something to fidget with, having something to put in one's mouth, rewarding oneself when goals have been met, remembering that discomfort associated with withdrawal will subside within two weeks. One tip was found to be spiritual, \\"Pray instead of puff\\". Since 1999 many of the NicA pamphlets have been updated and current versions may not contain the information analyzed.

It forms the basis for the definition of the class MaxSNP of optimization problems. It is defined as the class of problems that are properties of relational structures (such as graphs) expressible by a second-order logic formula of the following form: : \\\\exists S_1 \\\\dots \\\\exists S_\\\\ell \\\\, \\\\forall v_1 \\\\dots \\\\forall v_m \\\\,\\\\phi(R_1,\\\\dots,R_k,S_1,\\\\dots,S_\\\\ell,v_1,\\\\dots,v_m), where R_1,\\\\dots,R_k are relations of the structure (such as the adjacency relation, for a graph), S_1,\\\\dots,S_\\\\ell are unknown relations (sets of tuples of vertices), and \\\\phi is a quantifier-free formula: any boolean combination of the relations. That is, only existential second-order quantification (over relations) is allowed and only universal first-order quantification (over vertices) is allowed. If existential quantification over vertices were also allowed, the resulting complexity class would be equal to NP (more precisely, the class of those properties of relational structures that are in NP), a fact known as Fagin's theorem. For example, SNP contains 3-Coloring (the problem of determining whether a given graph is 3-colorable), because it can be expressed by the following formula: : \\\\exists S_1 \\\\exists S_2 \\\\exists S_3 \\\\, \\\\forall u \\\\forall v \\\\, \\\\bigl( S_1(u) \\\\vee S_2(u) \\\\vee S_3(u) \\\\bigr) \\\\, \\\\wedge \\\\, \\\\bigl( E(u,v)\\\\,\\\\implies\\\\,( eg S_1(u) \\\\vee eg S_1(v))\\\\,\\\\wedge\\\\,\\\\left( eg S_2(u) \\\\vee eg S_2(v)\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\wedge\\\\,( eg S_3(u) \\\\vee eg S_3(v)) \\\\bigr) . Here E denotes the adjacency relation of the input graph, while the sets (unary relations) S_1,S_2,S_3 correspond to sets of vertices colored with one of the 3 colors. Similarly, SNP contains the k-SAT problem: the boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) where the formula is restricted to conjunctive normal form and to at most k literals per clause, where k is fixed.  MaxSNP  An analogous definition considers optimization problems, when instead of asking a formula to be satisfied for all tuples, one wants to maximize the number of tuples for which it is satisfied. That is, MaxSNP0 is defined as the class of optimization problems on relational structures expressible in the following form: : \\\\max\\\\limits_{S_1,\\\\dots,S_\\\\ell} \\\\\\\\{ (v_1, \\\\dots, v_m) \\\\colon \\\\phi(R_1,\\\\dots,R_k,S_1,\\\\dots,S_\\\\ell,v_1,\\\\dots,v_m)\\\\\\\\} MaxSNP is then defined as the class of all problems with an L-reduction (linear reduction, not log- space reduction) to problems in MaxSNP0. For example, MAX-3SAT is a problem in MaxSNP0: given an instance of 3-CNF-SAT (the boolean satisfiability problem with the formula in conjunctive normal form and at most 3 literals per clause), find an assignment satisfying as many clauses as possible. In fact, it is a natural complete problem for MaxSNP. There is a fixed-ratio approximation algorithm to solve any problem in MaxSNP, hence MaxSNP is contained in APX, the class of all problems approximable to within some constant ratio. In fact the closure of MaxSNP under PTAS reductions (slightly more general than L-reductions) is equal to APX; that is, every problem in APX has a PTAS reduction to it from some problem in MaxSNP. In particular, every MaxSNP-complete problem (under L-reductions or under AP-reductions) is also APX-complete (under PTAS reductions), and hence does not admit a PTAS unless P=NP. However, the proof of this relies on the PCP theorem, while proofs of MaxSNP-completeness are often elementary.

Whenever a special move (or, in versions after 1.01, the strong attack) is used, this meter depletes. If a move would consume an amount of power that is greater than what is available, it cannot be performed. This meter automatically fills, or can be filled faster by using the game's \\"Charge\\" feature, which leaves the player vulnerable to attack. As the player loses health, the P-Gauge can \\"fill in\\" the empty parts of the Health Bar, thus allowing the player to use more specials if his/her life is low. Attack Power Correction Value: Represented by a number near the center of the screen. When the P-Gauge is full, by holding the \\"Charge\\" button and rapidly pushing the directional buttons, the player can sacrifice health for increased damage from all of his/her character's attacks. The maximum value places attacks at 199% power and leaves the character with 1 health point. B-Power Gauge: The game's \\"Super Bar.\\" This bar is filled either by attacking the opponent or by picking up stones dropped by attacked opponents, known as \\"B Stones.\\" When the number on the bar (called the \\"B-Power Stock\\") is 100 or higher, the player can execute one of several techniques that depend on this gauge: *B Power Arts: The term for this game's \\"Super Moves.\\" All B Power Arts cost 1 stock. *B Dash: An advanced version of the character's Dash. It is much faster, and has the ability to cancel any move type, allowing for more combo opportunities. Costs 1 stock. *B Counter: Activated by pushing the \\"B\\" button while blocking an opponent's attack. Allows the user to ignore block stun, and follow up with a counterattack. Costs 1 stock *B Escape: Allows the player to escape being attacked. This drains a significant amount of power compared to the other movements above. Costs 4 stocks. *Air Dash (1.01 only): In the first release, air dashing removed a small amount of B-Power. Every version thereafter borrows from the P-Gauge instead. *Big Bang Break (1.02 on): A powerful move that can only be performed in character unique situations, usually by canceling a specific B Power Art with a special command. Costs two stocks. An interesting note in this Gauge's history is that the first release had 9 levels of power, while every version after this only featured 5. Enhance: Basically the equivalent of a taunt. Any character can use an enhance three times per fight at maximum, except for Heita who can use it six times. The effects of the enhance vary wildly from character to character, and can be as minuscule as damage tweaks to a single move (Ren) or transformation into a new character (Heita).

The Garden Front Heythrop Park is a Grade II* listed early 18th-century country house southeast of Heythrop in Oxfordshire. It was designed by the architect Thomas Archer in the Baroque style for Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury. A fire in 1831 destroyed the original interior. From 1922 until 1999 Heythrop housed first a Jesuit tertiary education college, and later a training establishment. The house is now the main building of the Heythrop Park Hotel, Golf & Country Club. Architecture Heythrop Park. The Entrance Front. Heythrop Park In England, country houses which are set within a park are generally known as \\"park\\" rather than \\"house\\". e.g. Jane Austen's Mansfield Park. was designed by the architect Thomas Archer for Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury. Shrewsbury had travelled in Italy on an extensive Grand Tour, between 1700 and 1705. Apparently the duke had already decided to build in 1700, before he left for Italy, because of his failure to buy Cornbury Park near Charlbury, Oxfordshire., noting his correspondence with Lawrence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester, of Cornbury,, printed in V. J. Watney, Cornbury and Forest of Wychwood, page 179 Cornbury was a regular classical house designed by Inigo Jones' mason, Nicholas Stone, which had been brought up to date for the Earl of Clarendon more recently by Hugh May; Shrewsbury's disappointment evinces the enthusiasm for classical architecture that he had acquired before he left England. Modern architecture in Italy had evolved into its Baroque form, a style quite unknown in England. The travelling duke was quickly won over: in Rome, Shrewsbury visited the villa of Domenico de' Rossi in 1702, to \\"lay aside some prints\\" by the architectural engraver of the Studio di architettura civile di Roma, full of designs by Borromini and Bernini. In 1704 Shrewsbury obtained a plan for a house from Paolo Falconieri., noting Historic MSS. Commission 45, Buccleuch-Whitehall, ii (2), page 776 On his return to England, apparently possessing at least Rossi's first volume (of 1702), Shrewsbury called upon Archer to create a modern Italian palazzo set in the Oxfordshire countryside. At this time, Archer was one of the few English architects to have studied in Italy and become conversant with the Baroque forms of architecture, but many of the details of HeythropThe \\"deplorable\\" details, as Geoffrey Webb found them to be in 1925 () taking for examples the \\"lugged\\" mouldings round the windows of the ground floor; \\"a worse device than this is a feature window adorned with a broken pediment, the two halves of which have been reversed and sprout like horns above the window\\". The British took two and a half centuries to warm to their Baroque architecture. were adapted from Roman precedents through engravings in Rossi's publication, though none was directly imitated. Work on the house began in 1706. By 1709 the roof was in place and by 1713 the house was ready for partial occupation, but John Vanbrugh noted in April 1716 that it was incomplete, and so it was still, on Shrewsbury's death in 1718. The building contractors were William and Francis Smith of Warwick., s.v. \\"Smith, Francis\\" The stone used is a Middle Jurassic freestone, apparently Chipping Norton Limestone from local quarries. Archer's design was, as requested, in the Italian Baroque style. On the entrance facade of eleven bays, the giant order with a level balustraded roof is very similar to the design which William Talman had executed for the Duke of Devonshire at Chatsworth House just few years earlier. comment on this similarity. Chatsworth is regarded as England's first Baroque house. Archer's Corinthian order shifts restlessly against the wall plane, varying on the entrance front from flat pilasters to attached columns, to a free-standing screen that marches across the recessed entrance bays. The wall plane is ashlar on the entrance front but with strictly conventionalized channeled rustication the full height of the garden front. On the side elevations, the channeled rustication appears only on the rusticated pilaster-like corner quoins of the lightly projecting five central bays. In the frieze under the main cornice, occasional discreet square openings give light to the low attics. Alfred Waterhouse's hall at Heythrop Park; described by Pevsner, as in the style of Vanbrugh, can be compared to Vanbrugh's hall at Grimsthorpe Castle. The theme is that of the courtyard of a Renaissance palazzo. Paxton designed a similar courtyard hall with a glazed roof at Mentmore Towers twenty years earlier. The inspiration for the Baroque facade at Heythrop was Gian Lorenzo Bernini's final design for the Louvre, a plan never executed. Like Chatsworth, Heythrop Park comprises two floors linked by the giant order standing upon a raised semi-basement; the bays are articulated by a giant order with the Baroque inturned Corinthian volutes invented by Francesco Borromini. The elevation is broken by three projections, the centre being the central portico with Corinthian columns; this has no pediment to break the roof-line. In a break from his usual style, Archer has given the fenestration unusual emphasis by contrasting architectural detailing: the windows on the ground floor are from a design by Bernini, while those on the floor above are in a mannerist style with overlarge keystones penetrating the cornice, criticise this treatment of the fenestration as \\"fussy\\" and speculate it could be the result of input by Shrewsbury himself. as at Talman's Chatsworth. The central nine bays of the 13-bay garden front carry the rustication of the half-basement right up the wall to the cornice, with perfectly plain window openings and a central door framed in a very sober Doric order; this severe front is relieved by its richly treated two-bay end pavilions, which take up all the rich motifs of the entrance front. In 1831 a fire swept through the house destroying the interiors, many designed by James Gibbs, including a quatrefoil hall, a feature believed to have been unique in England. Other features of the rooms included a saloon which had an entablature supported by life-sized statues of Ceres and Flora beneath a stuccoed ceiling depicting the four corners of the globe. Mrs. Philip Lybbe Powys, who visited Heythrop in 1778 remarked that the stucco work was by \\"the famous Roberts of Oxford\\", though the plasterer Thomas Roberts was born in 1711; \\"In the arches over the doorways\\", Mrs. Lybbe Powys noted \\"fables of Aesop, finely executed in stucco, with wreathes of vine leaves.\\" After the fire the house remained derelict until sold to the railway contractor Thomas Brassey in 1870 as a wedding present for his third son Albert Brassey (1840‚Äì1918). Brassey commissioned the eminent architect Alfred Waterhouse to rebuild the interior. Waterhouse, a noted Gothic Revival architect, in deference to the history of the house worked in a neo-classical style; his double-height arcaded hall, being more redolent of the Baroque of John Vanbrugh than Archer. However, Waterhouse did add Gothic motifs to the hall's clerestory in the form of stained glass windows, by Morris and Co, depicting Faith, Hope and Charity. History Heythrop Park. The twentieth century saw the house extended for institutional use. Some contrasting architectural styles were employed. Heythrop Hall passed through various generations of the Talbot family until it was rendered uninhabitable by the fire of 1831. Rebuilt by new owners, the Brassey family in 1871; the house remained in their possession until 1926. From then until 1970, Heythrop Hall was a college for the philosophical and theological studies of Jesuit scholastics. During this period the house was altered and enlarged, not always in a style sympathetic to the original architectural concept. In 1926 two wings were added to the north front built of Hornton ironstone from north Oxfordshire. Like Chipping Norton Limestone it is a Middle Jurassic limestone, but its higher ironstone makes it much darker and browner than the stone used to build the house in the 18th century. In 1952, the indoor tennis court was converted to a chapel and in 1965, a library was added. In 1960, the architectural firm of Howell, Killick and Amis created two halls of residence in the grounds in a contemporary style. When in 1970 the Jesuit college moved to London as part of the University there, the National Westminster Bank group bought Heythrop Park and turned the house and its precincts into a training and conference centre. In 1999 NatWest sold the house to Firoz Kassam's company Firoka Ltd, which has turned the house and grounds to a hotel and country club. Heythrop Park Hotel Golf & Country Club Heythrop Park Hotel Golf & Country Club is a hotel with conference facilities and a golf course. The house has seventeen bedrooms and reception rooms and the restored and enlarged outbuildings and halls of residence contain a further 270 bedrooms. Heythrop Park completed a refurbishment in 2010 to make a conference centre and 2 hotels. The mid-20th Century lecture halls, which were demolished, had little to recommend them. The replacement building, now a Crowne Plaza franchise is in a similar architectural vogue. However, the development of the golf course and the main buildings has had an adverse effect on the condition of the gardens and relict features of the Talbot and Brassey era, with the consequent loss of rare and interesting trees across the estate. The gardens used to be quite special. Of particular note is the wide use of pulhamite in the Victorian hard landscaping, as found at Batsford Arboretum and elsewhere. English Heritage has had much input into preserving what remains of the ferme orn√©e but its ability to monitor the detail and enforce the small points of planning requirements seems limited.

Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1949 was an English amateur first-class cricketer who played more than 50 games for both Warwickshire and Worcestershire between 1914 and 1932, as well as having earlier appeared in the Minor Counties Championship for Staffordshire. Lane made his first-class debut for Worcestershire at Derby in May 1914. It was a chastening experience: Derbyshire won by an innings and 158 runs, and Lane took no wickets and scored 3 and 0. His next game the following month was little better: another heavy defeat, this time to Essex at Colchester, and 26 not out in the second innings could not make up for match figures of 22‚Äì1‚Äì94‚Äì0. He finally took his maiden wicket at the third attempt, when he claimed the solitary scalp of Hampshire's Phil Mead at Dudley at the end of June. He ended the season with just eight wickets at 55.50, though he did score two half-centuries. The First World War then brought a halt to first-class cricket for five years. When Lane played again, in 1919, it was for Warwickshire. He played a number of times for them that season and ended with 19 wickets at 28.26 ‚Äì his highest season's tally ‚Äî and in consecutive matches that June took 4‚Äì58 against Yorkshire and a career- best 4‚Äì56 versus Northamptonshire. Although he was absent in 1920 he had a couple more games in 1921, then another gap before two more appearances four years later. That marked the end of his Warwickshire career. In 1927 Lane returned to Worcestershire, for whom he played 34 times in three years; he acted as captain on three occasions in 1928 and 1929. His new county were terribly weak at this time, finishing bottom of the County Championship in 1927 and 1928, and second-bottom in 1929. Indeed, when Lane, batting at ten in each innings, scored 70 and 60* against Essex at Leyton in May 1929, a performance that his Wisden obituarist considered his \\"most valuable performance in first-class cricket\\", it was the first victory that the county had managed in nearly two years. After that season, Lane played no more regular first-class cricket, though he did make a final, one-off, appearance for Worcestershire three years later versus Essex at Leyton. This was the scene of his heroics in 1929, but a repeat was not to be: Lane had a quiet match, scoring 3 and 18 and not bowling in a drawn game. He was killed in a road accident in 1948, when his car crashed into a hedge.

The Duke has been in operation since March 5, 1925. Written and edited by students, it is published every Thursday during the academic year, excluding exam periods and holidays. The paper provides a mix of campus news, student opinions, editorials, and advertisements. The Duke reports a circulation of approximately 3,000 newspapers every week to upwards of 10,000 undergraduate and graduate students in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Online, The Duke website has averaged over 15,000 views per month since August 2015.  History  The paper was first published in 1925 and ran until 1942, when WWII forced it to pause publication until the war's end. The Duke resumed in 1949 and still publishes, in print and online, every Thursday.  Controversies  In the October 22, 2015 edition, a Staff Editorial detailed comments then- Duquesne University President Charles Dougherty made at a faculty town hall meeting. The article reported that Dougherty accused students who live off- campus as \\"liv[ing] a libertine lifestyle\\" and described their situation as \\"mardi gras.\\" The comments set off a fire-storm in the campus community and received coverage from national outlets such as The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, The Chronicle of Higher Education, the Associated Press and others. A news article published in the March 29, 2017 edition highlighted concern from the Duquesne LGBTQ community over the proposed addition of a Chick-fil-A Express on campus. Donald Trump Jr. mocked the upset Duquesne students on Twitter saying they were \\"#triggered.\\" Further controversy developed when during an April 13, 2017 segment of \\"Fox & Friends,\\" anchor Ainsley Earhardt appeared to plagiarize The Duke's reporting. The Society of Professional Journalists reported on Fox New's plagiarism, saying it \\"violates a core part of SPJ‚Äôs Code of Ethics,\\" and that \\"Fox News didn‚Äôt practice ethical journalism standards.

Barnard Eldershaw was the pseudonym used by the twentieth-century Australian literary collaborators Marjorie Barnard (1897-1987) and Flora Eldershaw (1897-1956). In a collaboration that lasted two decades from the late 1920s to the late 1940s, they published 5 novels, 3 histories, a radio drama, a collection of short stories, and several collections of critical essays and lectures. Flora Eldershaw and Marjorie Barnard were active in the Australian literary scene of the 1930s and 1940s. Through their lectures and reviews and their active participation in the Fellowship of Australian Writers, they played an important role in the development of Australia's \\"literary infrastructure\\".Goldsworthy (2000) p. 119 Collaborative life Marjorie Barnard met Flora Eldershaw, who was a year ahead of her, in her first year at the University of Sydney. Marjorie Barnard wrote of their first meeting as being > [N]ot entirely happy. I was the greenest of green 'freshers'. Flora was > established in her second year. Chance had given me the locker immediately > above hers. Its untidy contents frequently spilled out into her more ordered > domain. My then meager person was continually underfoot, and Flora's brown > eyes flashed with indignation more often than they smiled. But within the > year we were close friends. She widened my horizons and quickened my mind. > Later this friendship was to withstand what everyone agrees to be the acid > test of collaboration in writing.Barnard, in Meanjin, (4), 1956, cited by > Dever (1989) p. 39 While Marjorie Barnard spent most of the 1920s to 1940s living at home with her parents, Flora Eldershaw resided at the schools where she taught. Dale Spender writes that > \\"with so little encouragement, opportunity - or inclination, given the > demands of the day - she [Marjorie Barnard] and Flora Eldershaw ... still > managed to write their classic Australian novel A House is Built (1929), and > another, Green Memory (1933)\\".Spender (1988) p. 262 However, in 1936, when they were both thirty-nine, Barnard and Eldershaw also took a flat in Potts Point providing them with space for independence. Here, they held regular gatherings which operated something like a literary salon. Many of the leading literary and cultural figures of the time visited the flat. These included Frank Dalby Davison, Xavier Herbert, Leslie Rees, Tom Inglis Moore, Miles Franklin, Vance Palmer and Kylie Tennant.Dever (1994) p. 138 Literature was not the only subject discussed at their \\"salon\\". Guests included peace activists such as Lewis Rodd and Lloyd Ross, and Frank Dalby Davison said that his pamphlet \\"While freedom lives\\" grew out of \\"social discussions at the M. Barnard Eldershaw salon\\".cited by Dever (1989) p. 11 Barnard and Eldershaw were not part of the Bohemian circle as practised, for example, by Norman Lindsay, but this was not due to \\"petty bourgeois morality\\". Rather, it was because of \\"their expressed desire to promote the local literary product and force recognition of it from the prevailing cultural establishment\\". They were, in fact, highly active in promoting Australian writers and Australian literature - through the Fellowship of Australian Writers and other formal and informal activities. This and their approach to writing and criticism > \\"had the effect of mainstreaming writing by women, incorporating it into the > wider body of Australian letters, rather than confining it to the limited > range of culturally sanctioned 'feminine' forms like romance and children's > writing\\".Dever (1994) p. 141 They were both also part of Nettie Palmer's literary circle. She corresponded with and encouraged both of them, and she recognised the importance of their partnership. She wrote > \\"It isn't easy for an outsider to understand how a literary partnership is > carried on but in this case it seems to work well ... Any difference in the > characters of the two women doesn't make for a difference in their point of > view or values\\".cited by Spender (1988) p. 263 The partnership became harder to maintain after Eldershaw moved to Canberra in 1941. However, as well as still providing each other support, they were able to produce their last collaborative novel Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.Spender (1988) p. 264 While it is generally accepted that Barnard was the more expressive writer of the two, and that Eldershaw contributed her acute critical sense, Rorabacher also states that in their early collaborative novels it is impossible to distinguish their separate contributions.Rorabacher (1973) Collaboration ch. Overall, Barnard did more of the creative writing while Eldershaw focused on the structure and development of their major works. However, because Eldershaw was the more outgoing and articulate of the two, it was frequently assumed, at the time, that she was the dominant partner. This did not spoil their partnership, which lasted two decades, bearing testament to the fact that both derived value from it.Modjeska (1981) p. 79-80 Collaborative works Novels *A House is Built Barnard and Eldershaw wrote their first collaborative novel, A House is Built, in response to seeing an advertisement for The Bulletin prize. It went on to win this prize in 1928, shared with Katharine Susannah Prichard's Coonardoo. A House is Built was originally serialised in The Bulletin under the title, The Quartermaster.Goodwin (1986) p. 79 They could not find a publisher for it in Australia, so it was first published in England.Goldsworthy (2000) p. 115 It is an historical novel set in the nineteenth century, and focuses on the restricted lives of middle-class women of the era. Goldsworthy suggests that through this approach they also reflected \\"the dilemma of middle-class women in their own time, still largely denied the right to work and independence\\".Goldsworthy (2000) p. 110 *The Glasshouse The Glasshouse, a novel about shipboard life on a Norwegian boat travelling to Australia, was also first published in England.\\"The Argus Literary Supplement Book News\\", The Argus, 1945-07-28, p. 10 *Green Memory Green Memory, published in 1931, is a period novel set in 1850s Sydney, and deals with the lives of two sisters. A report on a 1931 meeting of the Canberra Society of Arts and Literature describes a lecture by Kenneth Binns on Green Memory in which he says the book \\"not only delights but ... also adds dignity and significance to Australian letters\\".\\"Arts Society: Review of current fiction in our literature\\", The Canberra Times, 1931-10-12 He praises the characterisation of both the main and secondary characters, and describes Barnard and Eldershaw as \\"masters of vivid, picturesque yet dignified writing\\". *Plaque with Laurel Plaque with Laurel (1937) was the first published novel ever set in Australia's national capital, Canberra. It concerns a writers' conference whose attendees come from other parts of Australia.Dorothy Johnston, Disturbing Undertones, Griffith Review, Edition 15. Retrieved 9 March 2014 *Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow Their final collaborative novel, Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow, published in 1947 as Tomorrow and Tomorrow, is considered to be one of Australia's major early science fiction novels and was highly regarded by Australia's only Nobel Prize winner for literature, Patrick White. It is set in the 24th century and features Knarf (a novelist and historian whose name is an inversion of Frank Dalby Davison's first name). The book is essentially a story within a story, with much of it comprising an historical novel, written by the character Knarf, about \\"old\\" Australia from 1924-1946. It was, however, censored for political reasons at the time: the censors demanded that 400 lines be cut, including references to \\"National Security regulations and how they contradicted the democratic principles for which the war was supposedly being fought\\".Capp (1993) pp. 181 In 1952, in Federal Parliament, W. C. Wentworth described it as \\"a trashy, tripey novel, with a Marxist slant\\".Dever (1989b) p. 9 Spender argues that it stands \\"firmly in the tradition\\" of women writers like Aphra Behn, Harriet Beecher Stowe and Elizabeth Gaskell who \\"have utilised fiction as a means of urging society to create a better world\\".Spender (1988) p. 265 It was not published in its entirety until Virago Press reissued it in 1983.Nelson (2004) There has been discussion in literary circles about how collaborative this novel is, fuelled partly by later comments by Barnard. This is despite significant evidence to the contrary, including Barnard's asking Palmer to obtain Eldershaw's signature as well as her own for his copy.Dever (1989a) p. 43-44 In later years Barnard claimed that Eldershaw's removal to Canberra in 1941 broke down their collaboration on the novel, although in 1941 she wrote to Palmer that \\"we're not going to let a little thing like distance interfere with collaboration. It's a pity the new book isn't further along\\".Barnard, cited by Dever (1989a) p. 45 Dever argues that there is significant evidence for Eldershaw's active involvement in the novel, including correspondence from the publisher referring to them both, and Eldershaw's later letter to Miles Franklin in which she commented on \\"the awful effort of having to close up the gaps left by the censor and adapting the ending\\".Eldershaw, cited by Dever (1989a) p. 46 Drama Barnard and Eldershaw wrote several stage and radio plays. Their first radio play, The Watch on the Headland, was broadcast on the ABC on 7 July 1940 as part of their Sunday Competition Play series. The subject of the play was the early days of settlement in Sydney.ABC Weekly, 2(27): 39, 6 July 1940 The competition winners were announced on 30 September 1940, with Barnard Eldershaw's play being placed 2nd.ABC Weekly, 2(40), 5 October 1940 Histories In one of their histories, My Australia (1939), they argue a case for Australia's future saying that \\"nothing corrupts a people more quickly than the opportunity to make a profit out of their fellows\\".Dever (1989b) p. 15 Essays and lectures A major and still well-regarded work is their Essays in Australian Fiction (1938).

It was first published in 1905 and later collected in The Thinking Machine (1907), which was featured in crime writer H. R. F. Keating's list of the 100 best crime and mystery books ever published. The story was selected by science fiction author Harlan Ellison for Lawrence Block's Best Mysteries of the Century. Plot summary Like Futrelle's other short stories, \\"The Problem of Cell 13\\" features Augustus S. F. X. Van Dusen as the main character, although most of the story is seen through the perspective of a prison warden. While in a scientific debate with two men, Dr. Charles Ransome and Alfred Fielding, Augustus, \\"The Thinking Machine\\", insists that nothing is impossible when the human mind is properly applied. To prove this, he agrees that he will take part in an experiment in which he will be incarcerated in a prison for one week and given the challenge of escaping. He achieves the goal with great ingenuity, and aid from his frequent confederate, newspaper reporter Hutchinson Hatch: after noticing rats in his cell escaping through a narrow drainpipe, he deduces that the pipe must terminate outside of the prison complex. He attaches a thread to a rat and a message addressed to whoever finds it, to be forwarded to Hatch. Working with Hatch, he is then able to draw a cable into his cell, along which any small item can be smuggled into the building. One of Augustus's primary needs is for nitric acid, which he uses to cut through the cell's window's bars. Along the way, he tosses out impossible fillips and red herrings, such as writing notes with no pen and making change from a five-dollar bill. He also indirectly manages to get an inmate to confess to a crime he committed, something the detectives had been unable to accomplish. Everyone around Augustus is amazed at his explanation, and they wholeheartedly believe his point that nothing is impossible, though the warden asks what would have happened if many of the key elements of Augustus's escape had not been present. Augustus smiles smugly and states that there were also two other ways out, and leaves it at that. Adaptations The story was adapted for television by Arthur A.

Every nonfederal hydroelectric project in the country operates under license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). As a project's license expires, the licensee begins a relicensing process that generally leads to a new license with updated terms. The new license lasts 30 to 50 years. The relicensing of PG&E;'s Mokelumne River Project, (Project 137) which began back in 1972, was the longest such process in FERC history. Meanwhile, PG&E; had been running its project, which stretches from Blue Lakes west to Electra Powerhouse, on annual licenses with few requirements for protecting the health of the river or providing river recreation. The 101-page settlement addresses the ecological and recreation effects of stream flows in all of the river reaches and creeks affected by the project. It balances the needs of the environment, recreation, and power generation. Other parties to the settlement are the California Department of Fish and Game, California Department of Boating and Waterways, US Fish and Wildlife Service, US Forest Service, Friends of the River, Bureau of Land Management, Natural Heritage Institute, and American Whitewater. The settlement led to the first removal of a PG&E; dam in the Sierra Nevada (U.S.) in modern history. The Foothill Conservancy successfully secured California Wild and Scenic River designation for 37 miles of the North Fork and main Mokelumne River with the passage of Senate Bill 854 in 2018. The designation bars new dams and major diversions on the river from just below Salt Springs Reservoir to just upstream of Pardee Reservoir. Earlier, the Conservancy laid the groundwork for that designation by working for the passage of Assembly Bill 142 in 2015. That legislation mandated a state wild and scenic river study of the Mokelumne River and provided interim protections from new dams and diversions.http://www.foothillconservancy.org/pages/focus3.cgi?magicatid=&magi;_detail=747&magid;=53 References * \\"Managing Watersheds in the New Century,\\" Proceedings of the Eight Biennial Watershed Management Conference 2000 * \\"Collaboration and Adaptive Management for the Mokelumne River Hydroelectric Project\\" * Tim Holt, \\"Persistence Frees the Mokelumne: River Advocate Pete Bell,\\" High Country News, March 15, 2004 * Matt Brown, \\"Saving the Sierra for Future Generations,\\" Lodi News Sentinel, August 29, 2007 * Dana Nichols, \\"New promise for trout streams; Dam removal helps Sierra sites recover,\\" The (Stockton) Record,December 18, 2006, * Environmental Defense, Power Play: The Sale of PG&E;'s Hydropwer System and the Future of California Rivers * Robin Mejia, \\"From Source to Sink: A River Divided,\\" Terrain Magazine External links * Foothill Conservancy * PG&E; Awards * California Water Policy Conference Awards Environmental organizations based in California Nature conservation organizations based in the United States Mokelumne River Non-profit organizations based in California Water in California ","title":"Foothill Conservancy"},{"id":"13270641","text":"The Conant Brook Dam is located on Conant Brook in Monson, Massachusetts, about upstream from the confluence of Conant Brook and the Quaboag River.

The division was formed primarily from the excess infantry regiments of existing divisions which were being triangularized. The division's 209th Infantry Brigade was formerly the 69th Infantry Brigade of the 36th Infantry Division, and came to the division with the 129th Infantry Regiment. The 21st Infantry Regiment came from the 35th Infantry Division and the 122nd F√ºsilier Regiment came from the 26th Infantry Division. The 21st and 129th Infantry Regiments were raised in West Prussia. The 122nd F√ºsilier Regiment was from the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg, and was later replaced by the 400th Infantry Regiment, raised primarily in the Rhineland. Combat chronicle The 105th Infantry Division initially served on the Eastern Front, seeing its first action in the Gorlice-Tarn√≥w Offensive. It was then transferred south to participate in the Serbian Campaign. It advanced to the Greek border and remained on the Macedonian front until June 1916. Elements of the division were detached and sent to Bulgaria during this period. The division was sent back to Galicia in June in response to the Russian Brusilov Offensive. In September, the division went to Latvia, and fought near Riga and Jakobstadt (now Jƒìkabpils). At the end of October 1917, the division was sent to the Western Front, entering the line in the German \\"Siegfried\\" position.

The gang gained notoriety for a successful string of bank robberies, using modern tools and tactics, in the Midwestern United States from September 1933 to July 1934. During this crime spree, the gang killed 10 and wounded 7. They managed to pull off three jail breaks which wounded two guards and killed a sheriff.https://www.fbi.gov/about- us/history/famous-cases/john-dillinger The increased use of new law enforcement techniques by the newly strengthened Bureau of Investigation (FBI predecessor) led to the dismantling of the gang. Many of its members were killed or imprisoned. Most notably, the BOI killed Dillinger in 1934 when he exited a movie theater.

Tactics included the use of roles during the robbery: Lookout, getaway driver, lobby man, and vault man. Gang members had modern weapons like the Thompson submachine gun and also had bulletproof vests. Lamm is credited with creating the first detailed getaway maps, known as \\"gits\\", to improve the chances for escape after the robbery. Powerful vehicles, like Ford coupes with a V8 engine, at the scene of the crime were known as \\"work cars\\" but were discarded after the crime to foil eye-witness reports given to police. Gangsters made use of caches of gasoline for their getaway cars as well as medical kits to treat injuries.

To obtain more supplies, the gang attacked the state police arsenals in Auburn, Indiana and Peru, Indiana, stealing machine guns, rifles, revolvers, ammunition, and bulletproof vests. On October 23, 1933, the gang robbed the Central National Bank & Trust Company in Greencastle, Indiana, making off with $74,802. They then headed to Chicago to hide out. The gang traveled to Racine, Wisconsin and robbed the American Bank and Trust Company, making off with $28,000. On December 14, 1933, CPD Detective William Shanley was killed. The police had been put on high alert and suspected the Dillinger gang of involvement in the robbery of the Unity Trust And Savings Bank of $8,700 the day before. The robbery was eventually determined to have been the work of another outfit. Shanley was following up on a tip that one of the gang's cars was being serviced at a local garage. John \\"Red\\" Hamilton showed up at the garage that afternoon. When Shanley approached him, Hamilton pulled a pistol and shot him twice, killing Shanley, then escaped. Shanley's murder led to the Chicago Police Department's establishment of a forty-man \\"Dillinger Squad.\\" =Daytona Beach, Florida= Dillinger and Evelyn Frechette were at a house on Daytona Beach, Florida on December 19. A day or two later they were joined by members of his gang; these were Pierpont, Makley, Russell Clark and Opal Long. Edwin Utter was the caretaker who occupied the garage apartment at the same address, and he told how the couples didn't bother anyone (they \\"kept to themselves\\") and had no outside contacts, as far as he knew, and he didn't see anyone visit them. To Utter the group had the appearance of gangsters. Someone in the group at some time mentioned to him they were coming from Chicago. Utter said the group received a considerable amount of mail. After the gang had gone, several letters came addressed to Frank Kirtley (an alias of Dillinger), J.C. Davies (alias of Makley), and J.C. Evans (an alias of Pierpont), but as the gang had not left a forwarding addresses, they were returned to the postman. Utter stated there was considerable drinking going on, especially at night. He said the gang stayed at the cottage until about January 12, leaving at night. This January date would have posed yet another problem for Dillinger's defense team had he gone to trial for Officer O'Malley's killing.FBI Dillinger File 62-29777 = East Chicago robbery = While Makley, Clark, and Pierpont extended their vacation by driving west to Tucson, Arizona, Dillinger left Florida on January 12 and met up with Hamilton in Chicago at noon on January 15, a meeting that had been arranged between the two men while Dillinger was in Daytona Beach. Later that afternoon they robbed the First National Bank in East Chicago. East Chicago marked the first time serious violence occurred at a Dillinger robbery, a trend that would continue through South Bend, the last job. Killed by Dillinger was East Chicago patrolman William Patrick O'Malley, the outlaw's first and only murder victim.Indiana Law Enforcement Memorial ‚Äì East Chicago Patrolman William Patrick O'Malley At approximately 2:50 p.m., 10 minutes before closing time, Dillinger, Hamilton, and an unidentified driver pulled up in front of the bank on Chicago Avenue on the wrong side of the street, facing east in the westbound lane, double parked, and exited the vehicle, leaving the driver to wait in the idling car. Hamilton waited in the bank's vestibule while Dillinger entered the main room of the bank. Once inside, Dillinger leisurely opened up a leather case containing a Thompson, pulled it out, and yelled to the 20 to 30 people in the bank, \\"This is a stickup. Put up your hands and get back against the wall.\\" The bank's vice president, Walter Spencer, while hiding, kicked a button which touched off the burglar alarm. Dillinger then went to the door of the vestibule and told Hamilton to come in. Hamilton produced a small leather bag and began scooping up the cash cage by cage. Dillinger told him, \\"Take your time. We're in no hurry.\\" Meanwhile, the first police contingent arrived on the scene after receiving the alarm at police headquarters. Four officers arrived: Patrick O'Malley, Hobart Wilgus, Pete Whalen, and Julius Schrenko. After a quick look through the windows of the bank, the officers could see a holdup was in progress and that one of the men was carrying a submachine gun. Shrenko ran to a nearby drugstore and called for more backup. While Schrenko was calling headquarters, Wilgus entered the bank by himself, but was soon covered by Dillinger. The outlaw \\"relieved\\" him of his pistol, emptied the cartridges, then tossed it back to the officer. Referring to his Thompson, Dillinger told Wilgus, \\"You oughtn't be afraid of this thing. I ain't even sure it'll shoot.\\" Turning his attention to Hamilton, Dillinger said, \\"Don't let those coppers outside worry you. Take your time and be sure to get all the dough. We'll take care of them birds on the outside when we get there.\\" Dillinger then discovered the hiding VP, Spencer, and ordered him up against the wall with everyone else. Schrenko's call for backup emptied the station of all but its phone operator. Four more officers arrived: Captains Tim O'Neil and Ed Knight, and Officers Nick Ranich and Lloyd Mulvihill (Mulvihill would be murdered by Van Meter on May 24). These four officers joined the other three in positions on either side of the Chicago Avenue entrance to the bank. Apparently, not one of them noticed the getaway car double parked on the wrong side of the street right outside the bank door, with its driver sitting unconcerned in the seat with the motor running. Dillinger then ordered Spencer and Wilgus to lead the way out of the bank, acting as shields. The four walked down the sidewalk toward the car. O'Malley, standing about 20 feet from the front door, saw an opening and fired four times at Dillinger, the bullets bouncing off the outlaw's bullet-proof vest. Dillinger pushed Spencer away with the barrel of his Thompson and yelled, \\"Get over. I'll get that son of a bitch.\\" O'Malley fell dead, with eight holes in a line across his chest. As Hamilton made his way into the street, he took a bullet to the right hand, causing him to drop an emptied pistol. Dillinger kept firing until he climbed into the rear seat of the car. Two game wardens who had driven up to the scene emptied their guns into the car as it started to pull away. The car actually started to pull away before Hamilton had closed the left rear door, and the door was partly torn off as it caught on the rear of another vehicle. The Ohio plates used at the gang's earlier robbery of a Greencastle bank in October were used on the East Chicago getaway car. Police believed the car \\"may have been a Plymouth,\\" but was actually a 1934 Ford Two-door Sedan. The abandoned car was found the following day at Byron Street and California Avenue, Chicago. Every officer, as well as numerous witnesses inside the bank, identified Dillinger as being one of the robbers ‚Äì and the gang member who shot Officer O'Malley. Prints were taken of the piece Hamilton left behind, which identified him.FBI Dillinger File, 62-29777 Dillinger was officially charged with Officer O'Malley's murder, although the identity of the actual killer is debatable, and it is still questioned by some whether Dillinger participated in the robbery at all. As police began closing in again, the men left Chicago to hide out first in Florida; later at the Gardner Hotel in El Paso, Texas, where a highly visible police presence dissuaded Dillinger from trying to cross the border at the Santa Fe Bridge in downtown El Paso to Ciudad Ju√°rez, Mexico. They instead crossed the border further South in Texas, eventually making their way to Tucson, Arizona. =Hiding out in Tucson= Issued on June 23, 1934; authorized by Homer S.

Congress St. in Tucson, AZ.Display of newspaper clippings of the capture of John Dillinger and his gang in the old lobby of the Congress Hotel. On January 21, 1934, a fire broke out at the Hotel Congress in Tucson where members of the Dillinger gang were staying. Forced to leave their luggage behind, they were rescued through a window and down a fire truck ladder. Makley and Clark tipped several firemen $12 (each, according to a bureau report) to climb back up and retrieve the luggage, affording the firefighters a good look at several members of Dillinger's gang. One of them, William Benedict, later recognized Makley, Pierpont, and Ed Shouse while thumbing through a copy of True Detective and informed the police, who traced Makley's luggage to 927 North Second Avenue. Officers from the Tucson Police Department went to the address on the afternoon of January 25, and there arrested Clark after a struggle. They found him in possession of $1,264.70 in cash. Makley was then followed to the Grabbe Electric & Radio Store on Congress Street, where he was looking at a radio capable of picking up police calls, and was apprehended there. He had $794.09 of cash in his possession.FBI Dillinger file, 62-2777 To capture Pierpont, the police staged a routine traffic stop and lured him to the police station, where they took him by surprise and arrested him. There was $99.81 recovered in Pierpont's personal effects and $3,116.20 on Mary Kinder. Dillinger was the last one taken, caught when he returned to the bungalow where Clark was captured. He had $7,175.44 in his possession, including notes from his robbery of the First National Bank in East Chicago, A000919 through A001107.Webb, Janet. \\"The day Tucson corralled Dillinger\\" Arizona Highways. January 8, 2006. These amounts, along with a leather money bag found, totaled over $25,000 in cash, as well as a cache of machine guns and several automatic weapons. The men were extradited to the Midwest after a debate between prosecutors as to where the gang would be prosecuted first. The governor compromised, and ordered that Dillinger would be extradited to the Lake County Jail in Crown Point for Officer O'Malley's murder in the East Chicago bank robbery, while Pierpont, Makley and Clark were sent to Ohio to stand trial for Sheriff Sarber's murder. Shouse's testimony at the March 1934 trials of Pierpont, Makley and Clark led to all three men being convicted. Pierpont and Makley received the death penalty, while Clark received a life sentence. On September 22, Makley would be shot dead by guards when he and Pierpont attempted to escape with fake pistols that were carved from bars of soap and painted black with shoe polish. Pierpont was wounded, and executed on October 17. Clark would ultimately be released in 1968, dying of cancer a few months later. Dillinger was flown back from Douglas Airport, Tucson, to Midway Airport, Chicago over the course of two days. With Lake County Chief Deputy Carroll Holley (Sheriff Lillian Holley's nephew), and East Chicago Chief of Police Nick Makar escorting the outlaw, the plane departed Tucson at 11:14 p.m. on Monday, January 29. After stops in Douglas, AZ (plane change), El Paso, Abilene, Dallas (another plane change), Fort Worth, Little Rock and Memphis (another plane change, a Ford Tri-Motor), there was yet another stop in St. Louis, where Chicago Times reporter/photographer Sol Davis boarded the aircraft and was obliged by Dillinger to take a few photos and ask some questions. After a while, growing weary of the questions and being photographed, the outlaw told Davis, \\"Go away and let me sleep.\\" Dillinger's brutal flight schedule ended at about six p.m. January 30 when the plane finally touched down at Midway. Waiting for him on the ground were 32 heavily armed Chicago policemen. A 13-car caravan consisting of 29 troopers from Indiana was ready to escort Dillinger to Crown Point, 30 miles away, to be tried for the O'Malley killing.Cromie/Pinkston, p. 147, 149 = Sioux Falls, South Dakota, robbery = Dillinger was for a time imprisoned at Crown Point jail, although he later escaped. Three days after Dillinger's escape, at about 9:45 a.m. on March 6, a vehicle (green 1934 Packard Super 8, 1934 Kansas license 13-786) filled with six members of the gang parked near the curb at the Security National Bank and Trust Company in Sioux Falls. One of the bank's bookkeepers, Mary Lucas, looked out the window and saw the Packard roll up the street. \\"If I ever saw a holdup car, that's one,\\" she said to a bank stenographer next to her. The stenographer laughed, saying that she'd been hearing too much lately about bank robberies. Before they could return to their desks, Dillinger, Nelson, Green, and Van Meter had entered the bank and subdued both tellers and customers. Hamilton, the driver, stayed with the car, while Tommy Carroll patrolled outside the bank with a Thompson. Inside, Nelson spotted motorcycle patrolman Hale Keith who was approaching the bank on foot. He fired his Thompson at Keith through a plate glass window while standing on an assistant cashier's counter. Multiple bullets hit Keith in the abdomen, in the right leg, about six inches below the hip, the right wrist, and the right arm, just below the elbow, but he would survive. Nelson was reported to have laughed when Keith fell, then saying, \\"I got one! I got one!\\" H.M. Shoebotham, a reporter for the Daily Argus-Leader, was in the office of Sheriff Mel Sells at the time of the Sheriff receiving a call informing him of the robbery. Mel grabbed a machine gun and a riot gun, and gave the riot gun to Shoebotham. They both got into a car and drove to the robbery scene, three blocks away. On the way to the bank, Sells figured his strategy. Across from the bank stood the Lincoln Hotel. He planned to reach a second floor window and fire at the robbers. When he reached the bank, scores of spectators were watching the activities. In the center of the street in front of the bank Carroll was standing with a machine gun. Occasionally, he would fire a few volleys, supposedly to keep the assembled people impressed. There exists a photograph taken of Tommy Carroll from across the street during the robbery, an \\"action\\" photo that is most likely unique to prewar bank robberies. Sheriff Sells backed his coupe into the alley behind the Lincoln Hotel and took his weapon to the second floor, leaving the Thompson with Shoebotham. Surrounding themselves with bystanders, the gang backed out of the bank to the Packard. No officers dared to shoot. The outlaws picked out five people to go with as hostages and commanded them to stand on the running boards. The hostages were Leo Olson, a bank teller; Mildred Bostwick, Alice Biegen, and Emma Knabach, stenographers; and Mary Lucas. As the Packard sped away from the bank, Patrolman Harley Chrisman managed to shoot out the radiator. Shortly after they left town, they swerved to avoid collisions with two horse-drawn milk wagons. Moments later, Dillinger released Olson, then made the women get into the car, which was already packed with the rest of the gang, their guns, extra gasoline cans, and the robbery loot. Bill Conklin of the Wilson service station on South Minnesota Avenue saw the Packard coming down the street with smoke pouring from the hood and assumed the car was on fire. He ran into the station, grabbed a fire extinguisher and ran back out. One of the robbers said, \\"Get back in there\\" as they had slowed up for him. The car eventually began to slow down right outside of town, giving three pursuing police cars time to catch up. Two miles outside of the Lakeland farm, the gang got out of the Packard and made the hostages stand around them, then opened fire on their pursuers. The three squad cars retreated. The gang then hijacked a car owned by local farmer Alfred Muesche, and transferred the gas cans and money into it. About 10 miles outside of Sioux Falls, the gang released the hostages and drove off. The hostages were eventually picked up by a passing motorist who drove them back to the bank. The police scoured the highways by ground and by air over a 50-mile segment of territory south and east of Sioux Falls. The men they were looking for were believed to have ditched Muesche's Dodge for \\"a big Lincoln\\" about two or three miles northwest of Shindler. From St. Paul came the assurance that 20 police cars were patrolling all roads heading into St. Paul and Minneapolis, but the gang made it safely back to the Twin Cities and began preparing for the Mason City heist.The Daily Argus-Leader, 3-6-34, 3-7-34,The Billings Gazette, 3-31-63 = Mason City, Iowa, robbery = Seven days later, on the afternoon of March 13, at 2:40 p.m., the same six (Dillinger, Nelson, Hamilton, Green, Van Meter, and Carroll), plus an added seventh man as the probable driver, either Joseph Burns or Red Forsythe, drove down State Street in a 1933 blue Buick 90 series sedan (with the rear window removed) and parked in front of Mulcahy's prescription shop. All sources tell a different story as to who went in the bank and who patrolled outside, but it was believed certain that Dillinger took a position outside the front entrance, with Nelson on the north side of the street near the alley behind the bank, and at least Hamilton and Green entered the bank, with probably Van Meter. From descriptions by witnesses later, Tommy Carroll was also positioned outside. Carroll stood in the doorway of the prescription shop on State. Freelance photographer H.C. Kunkleman happened to be filming the bank when the robbery began. Kunkleman was told by one of the bandits to turn the camera off, that they would be the ones doing all the shooting. He began filming again once the gang made their getaway (the five-minute film still exists). Green and Hamilton (and probably Van Meter) entered the bank and fired volleys into the walls and ceiling. Thirty-one employees and approximately 25 customers were ordered to put their hands up. Tom Walters, a bank guard positioned in an elevated bulletproof observation booth near the front entrance, fired a tear gas cartridge, according to procedure, which hit Green in the back. Walters' tear gas gun then jammed. One of the robbers, either Van Meter or Green, sprayed the booth with machine-gun fire, which shattered the glass, but left Walters unharmed. Tom Barclay, a clerk, threw a tear gas grenade over the balcony of the lobby. While the tellers' cash drawers were being emptied (drawers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7, missing 5, about $5,000), Hamilton grabbed assistant cashier Harry Fisher and brought him back to open the vault. About a week earlier, Eddie Green (most likely) had appeared at Fisher's door asking for directions, then peered attentively at Fisher's face, something Fisher would later remember. Directions for alternate routes for the getaway were also mapped out at this time. Once they got to the vault, Hamilton erred by allowing a steel gate to close and lock between him and Fisher. Fisher now could only hand stacks of $5 bills to Hamilton through the bars, greatly reducing the gang's take from $250,000 to $52,000.Block, Lawrence. Gangsters, Swindlers, Killers, and Thieves: The Lives and Crimes of Fifty American Villains. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. During the robbery, Green would periodically yell out the time to the others. Meanwhile, crowds began to form outside after word had spread that a robbery was in progress at the bank. James Buchanan, an off-duty officer, who had grabbed a sawed-off shotgun when he heard about the robbery, hid behind the Grand Army of the Republic monument. Unable to fire because of the crowd of people, he instead exchanged barbs with Dillinger. Of the robbers, Dillinger was the only one for whom a clothing description could be provided: light gray suit, dark overcoat and dark hat. Buchanan called back for him to get away from the crowd and he would fight it out with him. Buchanan said that Dillinger's upper lip turned into a snarl as he talked. Dillinger, armed with a Thompson, drew a .38 from an inside pocket and fired at Buchanan, but missed. Outside the bank, Nelson was acting somewhat crazily, firing randomly in different directions. One man, R.L. James, was hit in the leg by one of Nelson's bursts. Tommy Carroll came over to check on James' condition. An oncoming car came and Carroll blasted it with his machine gun. \\"The radiator of the car was filled with lead and the frantic driver backed out at the rate of 25 mph.\\" From his third-floor office above the bank, police judge John C. Shipley heard the gunfire and went to the window. Dillinger sent a volley of shots in Shipley's direction, warning him to stay back. The judge retreated, but went to his desk and grabbed a pistol, then returned to the window and fired, hitting Dillinger in the left shoulder. Hamilton, Green and Van Meter, with a large canvas bag of cash, left through the front door of the bank, surrounding themselves with hostages that Dillinger had collected. The entire gang moved as one around the corner onto State Street, with Dillinger in the center of the group. Judge Shipley, again, was at a window from above the bank and risked firing into the group, this time striking Hamilton in the shoulder. When Hamilton saw R.L. James lying on the street wounded, he said, \\"I thought there wasn't going to be any more of this?\\" Nelson, who had now joined them, said, \\"I thought he was a copper.\\" Nelson then stopped two women who had just come out of a nearby butcher shop and were at the intersection of State Street and the alley directly east of the bank, and marshalled them to the car and commanded them to stand outside of it. Before they reached the car, Nelson snatched the package of meat from Mrs. Clark's hands, threw it to the ground and stomped on it, silencing her protests with, \\"You'll get paid plenty for it.\\" The number of hostages varies wildly in Dillinger books, but the Mason City Globe-Gazette from that day names 11 people. A couple women sat inside the car on the robbers' laps. Bill Schmidt, an employee of Killmer Drug, was delivering a bag of sandwiches to the bank and was stopped by Dillinger and also shoved into the Buick. While riding through town, the bag of sandwiches was discovered and they were quickly eaten by the gang. The Buick slowly moved north on Federal Avenue to 2nd Street, taking a left, headed west to Adams, taking another left. The car stayed at about 25 mph within the downtown area. Near 4th Street, Clarence McGowan, along with his wife and five-year-old daughter, spotted the car. McGowan began to pursue the bandit car after mistakenly believing the vehicle, loaded with people on the outside of the car, to be part of a wedding or \\"some kind of wild demonstration.\\" He was shot in the abdomen after pulling up too close to the Buick. McGowan went home and bathed before going to the hospital. Both McGowan and R.L. James, Nelson's casualty, recovered. The Buick stopped from time to time so that roofing nails could be spread across the highway, \\"sacks full of them.\\" Oncoming cars were stopped by the gang and were ordered to stay where they were for five minutes before moving on. Bill Schmidt said that \\"The bandits would drive fairly fast on the straight away, but slowed down for the bumps.\\" The hostages were let off a few at a time and individually. Mrs. Clark (carrying the meat earlier) and Mrs. Graham were the last two hostages to be released, at a point three and a half miles south and a mile and a half east of Mason City. Asked if she'd be able to identify any of the men, Mrs. Clark said, \\"I sure would; especially the one who winked at me.\\" The Buick was found in a gravel pit about four miles south of the city later that evening. According to police, two cars had been waiting for the gang, with one driver in each vehicle.Mason City Globe-Gazette, Extra! edition, 3-14-34\\"Teargas and Tommyguns, DVD, 2004 Mason City Public Library Once the gang made it back to St. Paul, Green showed up at Pat Reilly's, 27-year-old fringe gang member, husband and father, and also bartender at St. Paul's Green Lantern, asking him if he knew where Dr. (Nels) Mortensen's home in St. Paul was, and requested that he accompany him to see the doctor. Reilly later stated to agents that at that time Eddie Green was driving a Hudson and that Dillinger and Hamilton were in the back seat; that both individuals had gunshot wounds in the shoulders and that Dillinger appeared to be nauseated and slightly dizzy. All four proceeded to Mortensen's home at 2252 Fairmount Avenue in St. Paul, arriving just after midnight. Mortensen answered the call in his night clothes. He examined both men, probing the wounds. Reilly said that during this time Dillinger was \\"quite ill and wobbly or faint\\" and had to sit down on the couch. Mortensen told them the wounds weren't serious and that he didn't have his medical bag there. He asked them if they had any liquor. They replied in the affirmative. He instructed them to go home and take a stiff drink and to return to his office the next day. They didn't appear. The four returned to Green's car and drove to the intersection of Snelling and Selby, where Green gave Reilly a $5 bill and let him out of the car. Reilly said he hailed a Blue and White taxi and then returned home.Dillinger File, 62-2977, R.C. Coulter report Eddie Green was later questioned by the FBI, and gave the names of the two doctors to them while in a critical state in the hospital.Beineke, John A. Hoosier Public Enemy: A Life of John Dillinger. Indianapolis: Indiana Historical Society Press, 2014. Proceeding the events of the Mason City, Iowa robbery, John Dillinger and his crew reached for safety at Little Bohemia Lodge, located in northern Wisconsin. The owner of the lodge grew suspicious after seeing the behavior of the group of men, and tipped the FBI. Three FBI agents positioned themselves about the cabin, and waited. Eventually, the agents opened fire on the lodge towards the gangsters, and Dillinger and his crew decided to flee through the woods after returning fire briefly. They escaped, and with no casualties.Stodghill, Dick. The Hoosier Hot Shots and My Friend Gabe. S.l.: JLT/Charatan Publications, 2007. =Little Bohemia Lodge= Very early on April 20, Van Meter, Marie Comforti (\\"Mickey\\"), and Pat Reilly were the first to arrive at Little Bohemia Lodge in the town of Manitowish Watersin northern Wisconsin. Emil Wanatka, who had opened the resort four years prior, greeted them. Arriving later, were Dillinger, Hamilton, and Cherrington by way of Sault Ste. Marie. Then Nelson and wife Helen, came in from Chicago. and last to arrive were Tommy Carroll and Jean Delaney. Reilly stated that on that first night he, Carroll, Lester Gillis (Nelson), Dillinger, and Emil Wanatka played \\"hearts\\" till around midnight. He went to the bar while the others went to their rooms. Hamilton and Pat Cherrington had the end room on the left upstairs, while Van Meter and Comforti had the room opposite. Tommy Carroll and Jean Delaney, together with Gillis and Helen, occupied the little cottage on the right of the lodge driveway. Dillinger had the room on the left aat the top of the stairs in the main lodge. Reilly stated to agents that Van Meter told him that Dillinger's room had two beds and that he and Dillinger would share the room. Reilly stated that as he entered the room, Dillinger was lying on the bed on the left side of the room, reading with a bottle of whiskey on the stand near the bed. That as he entered Dillinger laid his magazine on the table, but nothing was said. He noticed when Dillinger turned over he had a .45 automatic under his pillow. Reilly stated that Dillinger then took a drink. That he himself, then locked the door, turned out the light, and went to bed on the right-hand side of the room. The gang had assured the owners that they would give no trouble, but they monitored the owners whenever they left or spoke on the phone. Emil's wife Nan and her brother managed to evade Baby Face Nelson, who was tailing them, and mailed a letter of warning to a U.S. Attorney's office in Chicago, which later contacted the Division of Investigation. Days later, a score of federal agents led by Hugh Clegg and Melvin Purvis approached the lodge in the early morning hours. Two barking watchdogs announced their arrival, but the gang was so used to Nan Wanatka's dogs that they did not bother to inspect the disturbance. It was only after the federal agents mistakenly shot a local resident and two innocent Civilian Conservation Corps workers as they were about to drive away in a car that the Dillinger gang was alerted to the presence of the FBI.Toland, John. The Dillinger Days. Da Capo Press, 1995. . Gunfire between the groups lasted only momentarily, but the whole gang managed to escape in various ways despite the agents' efforts to surround the lodge. J.J. Dunn, Dakota County Sheriff, received a call from the Dept. of Justice at 3:40 a.m. on April 23, giving notice that the gang might be headed his way in a Model A, Wisconsin plate No. 92652. Dunn gathered a posse that included deputy sheriffs Joe Heinen, Norman Dieters, and Larry Dunn, with Hastings night policeman Fred McArdle. The coupe was spotted six hours later, shortly after 10 a.m., entering the city from the south on Highway 3, then \\"turned at the drug store corner to cross the high bridge, in the direction of St. Paul.\\" The officers used Heinen's Buick sedan in the pursuit, with Heinen driving and McArdle armed with a .30-30 and Dieters a .30-40. A large cattle truck slipped between the officers' car and the Model A, and Heinen was unable to pass the truck until he reached the opposite side of the spiral bridge. Upon leaving the north end of the bridge, the bandit car was seen climbing the hill a half a mile across the valley. The Buick started to creep up on the trio. McArdle and Dieters fired warning shots outside their windows as the two cars were leaving St. Paul Park. Dillinger, the middle passenger, with Van Meter driving, returned fire with his .45 through the rear window of the coupe. As the cars roared up the highway toward Newport, approximately 50 shots were exchanged. The chase that started near St. Paul Park, according to the officers involved, was for about 20 miles, not 50, as it is usually reported.Hastings Gazette, 4-27-34 McArdle fired the shot that inflicted the mortal wound to Hamilton. In describing the shot, McArdle said, \\"When the bullet hit the car, the coupe seemed to wobble for a minute and then we thought it was going into the ditch. The driver managed to keep it on the pavement, however, and after doubling back to St. Paul Park and crossing the highway toward Cottage Grove, they lost us in the hills.\\" The car would soon be replaced before heading to Chicago to seek out medical attention for Hamilton. It should be remembered that the trio hadn't slept at all the night before. It was also extremely cramped in the coupe with three people, one of them being mortally wounded, as the length of a Model A seat is only 39 inches across. Much has been written about the slowness of the Model A used in the escape (top speed about 45 mph), but with a large part of the driving done in darkness, Van Meter wouldn't have been going much faster than 40-45 mph in any car, since headlight systems in all cars of the period were notoriously inadequate. High speed at night was simply too dangerous. It's unfortunate for Dillinger, Van Meter and Hamilton that they didn't ditch the coupe for a faster car at daybreak. It probably wasn't possible to do so.Hastings Gazette, 4-27-34 edition Hamilton was taken by Dillinger and Van Meter to see Joseph Moran in Chicago, though Moran refused to treat Hamilton. He died at a Barker- Karpis hideout in Aurora, Illinois, three days after the shooting near Hastings. Dillinger, Van Meter, Arthur Barker, Volney Davis, and Harry Campbell, members of the Barker-Karpis gang, buried him in Oswego, Illinois. On May 3, one week after Hamilton's death, Dillinger, Van Meter, and Tommy Carroll robbed the First National Bank of Fostoria, Ohio. In the robbery, Fostoria police chief Frank Culp was wounded when Van Meter shot him in the chest with a Thompson.Culp died from his injury 16 years later in 1950 Dillinger and Van Meter spent most of May living out of a red panel truck with a mattress in the back. In early May, Dillinger paid a visit to Fred Hancock at 3301 East New York Street, Indianapolis (the Shell filling station where Hubert and Fred worked), and gave him $1,200 in cash. Fred Hancock: \\"It was on Thursday, May 10, that I next saw John. A fellow came into the station between 5:00 and 4:00 p.m. on this date dressed in overalls, wearing glasses, no coat, wearing a sleeveless jacket. He was unshaven, and this party stood by the kerosene drum. I did not recognize him at the time and continued to wait upon a customer who was in the station, and then walked into the filling station house, thinking that this party standing by the kerosene drum was a kerosene customer. This party then walked over to the filling station house and knocked on the window to attract my attention. When I looked at him more closely I realized that it was John. He left with me a package containing money and told me where to take it. He said to tell Dad if anything happened to him to give Billie some of that money. He gave me $1,200 made up in four packages -- $500 for Grandpa, $500 for my mother, Audrey Hancock, $100 for Hubert and $100 for myself, and I personally delivered this money to the people it was intended for. John told me how 'hot' he was. This was after the time the shooting had occurred at Little Bohemia Lodge in Wisconsin. He said he would return in two weeks. He was walking at the time, and I do not know how he came into the station. When leaving, he walked out of the station and walked south on LaSalle Street to Washington Street. The money was all made up of one-, five- and ten-dollar bills. There were very few ten-dollar bills in the money, it being mostly ones and fives. I used the $100 John gave me in connection with some work I was having done on the eyes of my little girl, and I understand that Mother and Grandpa later paid out the $500 they each received to some attorney, possibly John (sic) Ryan, in connection with John's case.\\" Agent Whitson had been observing the activity at the Shell station on the corner of New York and LaSalle. Whitson: \\"On 5-10-34 I noticed a stranger talking to Fred Hancock near the kerosene drum in the yard of the station at about 3:45 p.m. He was wearing blue overalls, brown vest, blue shirt and tie, dark hat, and wore spectacles, either rimless or with a thin metal rim. His complexion was ruddy and he had a stubble of beard. In his right hand he carried at all times what appeared to be a pint milk bottle wrapped in newspaper. About 3:50 p.m. the stranger left the station, going south on LaSalle Street toward Washington Street. Agent noted that the man appeared to have a deep cleft in his chin, and decided to follow him and have a better look at him. Agent reached the street without being observed by Hancock and followed the stranger, who was walking rapidly and without any noticeable lameness or infirmity in either leg. The man turned west on Washington Street when Agent was still between 25 and 30 yards behind him. When agent reached the street intersection, the man was nowhere in sight.\\" On May 24, it is alleged that Van Meter killed East Chicago patrolmen Francis Mulvihill and Martin O'Brien who had tried to pull them over.Indiana Law Enforcement Memorial ‚Äì East Chicago Patrolman Francis Lloyd MulvihillIndiana Law Enforcement Memorial ‚Äì East Chicago Patrolman Martin J. O'Brien On June 7, Tommy Carroll was shot and killed by police in Waterloo, Iowa. Dillinger and Van Meter reunited with Nelson a week later and went into hiding. On June 30, Dillinger, Van Meter, Nelson, and an unidentified \\"fat man\\" robbed the Merchants National Bank in South Bend, Indiana. The identity of the \\"fat man\\" has never been confirmed; it is widely suspected that he was one of Nelson's associates, or, as suggested by Fatso Negri to the BOI, Pretty Boy Floyd. During the robbery, a police officer named Howard Wagner was killed when Van Meter shot him in the chest as he responded to the sound of a burst of submachine gunfire coming from inside the bank. Van Meter was shot in the head during the resulting shootout, and was seriously wounded. =Green Lantern Tavern= The Green Lantern speakeasy opened for business in 1928. It was located at 229 E 6th St. in St. Paul Minnesota. It became notorious for being a favorite hangout for prohibition crime figures including the Dillinger gang. In 1933 two members of the gang, Tommy Gannon and William Albert \\"Pat\\" Reilly, took over its operations. The details of the how and why of that transaction are undocumented, but \\"Pat\\" Reilly was one of the Tavern's bartenders. Kay Glispie(Canadian), was a waitress there that at that time, said she was only to approach customers when summoned to their tables.

Life  The son of a French woman and a Russian engineer, Evreinov developed a keen interest in theatre from an early age, penning his first play at the age of 7. Six years later, he performed in a wandering circus as a clown. He attended a gymnasium in Pskov, before moving to the School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. It was there that he staged his first full-fledged play, The Rehearsal, followed by an op√©ra bouffe, The Power of Charms (1899). Having matriculated from the school in 1901, Evreinov turned his attention to music and studied with Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov at the Moscow Conservatory for a couple of years. In 1907-08 and 1911-12 he was involved in reconstructing the world of medieval plays and those dating from the Spanish Golden Age at the Starinny Theatre (\\"Old-Fashioned Theatre\\") in Saint Petersburg. The foremost Russian actress, Vera Komissarzhevskaya, asked him to cast her in the leading role for his version of Francesca da Rimini (1908). Later that year, Evreinov's production of Oscar Wilde's Salom√© was suppressed on the orders of Nicholas II. Evreinov's association with the Komissarzhevsky family continued for several years. Together with Theodore Komisarjevsky, he staged a number of \\"harlequinades\\" and \\"monodramas\\" as part of his new project, \\"The Merry Theatre for Aged Children\\". His concept of monodrama was exemplified in The Theater of the Soul, a 1915 production set inside the human breast as the repository of the soul. In 1910, Evreinov quit his job at the Ministry of Railways to take the helm as producer, dramatist, and composer of the False Mirror Theatre in Saint Petersburg. It was there that he staged more than one hundred plays, including fourteen pieces written by himself. His production of The Government Inspector was a milestone in the history of Russian theatre: each act was staged so as to parody one of the following aesthetics: provincial realist theatres, the Moscow Art Theatre of Constantin Stanislavski, the techniques of Edward Gordon Craig and Max Reinhardt, and slapstick comedy films. In 1922 and 1923 Evreinov visited Berlin and Paris where his plays were produced by the likes of Jacques Copeau and Charles Dullin. He spent the rest of his life in Paris, working with the , Sorbonne, and Serge Lifar. He prepared a comprehensive monograph tracing the History of Russian Theatre through the centuries. Many of his later plays have never been staged, including the \\"anti-Stalinist drama\\" The Steps of Nemesis, with such characters as Alexei Rykov, Nikolai Bukharin, Genrikh Yagoda, and Nikolai Yezhov.  The Storming of the Winter Palace  Scene from the 1920 spectacle that was later used as a purportedly \\"authentic\\" photograph of the events. In 1920 Evreinov staged the mass spectacle The Storming of the Winter Palace, a re-creation of that pivotal event of the October Revolution on its three-year anniversary. The mass spectacle form took the pre-revolutionary Symbolist utopias of \\"ritual theatre\\" (whose formulation was largely a response to the abortive 1905 revolution), and recast their 'people' as the proletariat.Kleberg (1980, 44-64). Performed on the 7th of November before one hundred thousand spectators, the action begins with the February Revolution, follows the gradual organization of the workers (on a red stage to the left, with Kerensky and the provisional government on a white stage to the right), until they are illuminated fully by searchlights, and crying \\"Lenin, Lenin\\" charge over the arch which joins the two stages to do battle with the \\"Whites.\\" Kerensky leaps to a car for an escape, and is pursued along a path between the two large groups of spectators by trucks full of the Red Guard waving bayonets, to the Palace. Silhouettes struggle in the windows of the Palace, until the Red Army is finally successful, and red lights flash out. A cannon fired from the battleship Aurora and fireworks herald the victory of the October Revolution. Also later possibly inspired by the fireworks, and cannon fire, the color orange somehow became one of the official colors of October.  Works and theories  commedia Harlequin Evreinov argued that the role of theatre was to ape and mimick nature. In his estimation, theatre is everything around us. He pointed out that nature is full of theatrical conventions: desert flowers mimicking the stones; mouse feigning death in order to escape a cat's claws; complicated dances of birds, etc. He viewed theatre as a universal symbol of existence. Apology for Theatricality is his most famous essay. It was published in 1908. Here Evreinov promoted an underlying aesthetic: :\\"To make a theatre of life is the duty of every artist. ... the stage must not borrow so much from life as life borrows from the stage.\\" The director sought to reinvigorate the theatre (and through it life itself) through the rediscovery of the origin of theatre in play. He was influenced by the philosophies of Schopenhauer, Nietzsche and Bergson, and, like Meyerhold, the aesthetics of symbolism and the commedia dell'arte (particularly in its use of mask and spontaneity). Evreinov developed his theatrical theories in An Introduction to Monodrama (1909), The Theatre as Such (1912), The Theatre for Oneself, and Pro Scena Sua (1915).Golub (1998). His plays include the monodramas The Presentation of Love (1910) and In the Stage-Wings of the Soul (1911), the tragi-farce A Merry Death (1908, based on Alexander Blok's The Puppet Show), and The Chief Thing (1921); the last two of which were heavily indebted to the commedia. Based on Maxim Gorky's The Lower Depths (1902), The Chief Thing provided Evreinov's one international success, was done on stage and screen in France as La Comedie du Bonheur and was staged on Broadway in 1926 by Theater Guild with Harold Clurman and Edward G. Robinson. His Ship of the Righteous was a great success in Poland. According to Spencer Golub, The Chief Thing play provides a \\"compendium of Evreinovian aesthetics and devices\\" and features Harlequin \\"as death-defier and life- transformer\\".

The fragment was discovered in 1990 by American scholar Harvey L. Sharrer, of University of California, Santa Barbara. Sharrer was analysing documents in the Torre do Tombo archive in Lisbon, when he found the folio in the binding of a 16th-century book. Before Sharrer's discovery, the only known Galician-Portuguese mediaeval manuscript with love (non-religious) songs and musical notation was the Vindel Parchment, which contains seven songs by troubadour Martim Codax. Several songbooks covering the period exist, but all of them lack musical notation except the Cantigas de Santa Maria, which are religious in tone. The text and musical notation of the Sharrer Pachment are fragmentary, due to damage done to the folio during the centuries; but further damage was inflicted during a disastrous \\"restoration\\" by Portuguese authorities. The parchment is written with Gothic letters and contains seven love songs (cantigas de amor). Even though the name of the author is not given, all songs appear in the same order in other songbooks (cancioneiros) of Galician-Portuguese poetry (Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional and the Cancioneiro da Vaticana), where they are attributed to King Dinis I of Portugal (reigned 1279-1325), known for his love for the arts. The folio probably belonged to a larger 14th century songbook that has been lost. The songs of the Sharrer Parchment are: *Poys que vos Deus, amigo, quer guisar *A tal estado me adusse, senhor *O que vos nunca cuidei a dizer *Que mui gr√£o prazer que eu hei, senhor *Senhor fremosa, no posso eu osmar *N√£o sei como me salva a minha senhor *Quis bem amigos, e quero e querrei Since their discovery, the songs have been recorded by several groups dedicated to early music like the Theatre of Voices.

Lewis Jr. (March 11, 1926 ‚Äì August 20, 2005), was an American businessman, philanthropist and Chairman of J.C. Lewis Enterprises, Lewis Broadcasting Corporation, J.C. Lewis Investment Company, and Island Investments. He served one term as Mayor of Savannah in the late 1960s as a Republican. From the 1940s to 2005, Lewis developed a sizable business empire, including automobile dealerships and media outlets throughout the southeast, including both a TV and radio station bearing his initials‚ÄîWJCL-TV (the Savannah, Georgia market's first all-color television station), and WJCL-FM (the market's first stereo FM station), and acquired numerous commercial real estate properties including shopping centers and tracts of mixed-use properties throughout the Savannah area. Lewis owned a portion of land on the southern end of Skidaway Island and later developed much of it into Moon River Landing, the final phase of the Landings on Skidaway Island and Green Island, a barrier island located off the coast of Georgia. History =Early life and career= A native of Savannah, J.C. Lewis Jr. was a prefect at the Woodberry Forest School in Orange, Virginia, where he graduated with honors and went on to graduate summa cum laude (highest honors) from the University of Georgia. Lewis was a veteran of the United States Navy, the Coast Guard, and the Merchant Marine. Lewis then embarked on what would become an incredibly successful business career, building wealth and stature in several arenas, but perhaps most so in the fields of automotive sales, television broadcasting, and real estate. assistance. In 1929 the general aviation committee of the Savannah City Council purchased 730 acres (3 km¬≤), the Belmont Tract belonging to Mr. Lewis' father, J.C. Lewis, as the future site of the Savannah Municipal Airport now known as Hunter Army Airfield. Lewis started his life by inheriting Georgia's oldest Ford dealership from his father and built a diversified family empire. He \\"proved to be a brilliant businessman, opening additional Ford dealerships in Daytona Beach and Melbourne, Fla., adding new brands to his Savannah dealership, and investing in tractor sales, taxi cab businesses, television and radio stations, hotels, life insurance, yacht sales and real estate.\\" . His business interests included numerous television and radio stations, along with new and used car dealerships throughout the southeast; and over a dozen other companies including life insurance, finance corporations, and both commercial and residential real estate development firms. His automotive interests included: the two Ford dealerships in Savannah, Georgia (Georgia's oldest continuously operated Ford Dealership), as well as the city's Lincoln, Mercury, Mazda, Saab, and Avis Rent A Car franchise(s). He also owned the Ford dealerships in Daytona Beach and Melbourne, Florida. Lewis was a principal partner in CLV-Credit Life Insurance Corporation and owned Owens and Trojan Yacht Sales Group which was located at the JC Lewis Marina located in Thunderbolt, Georgia. His media properties included: ABC-22 WJCL-TV and Fox-28 WTGS-TV in Savannah, Georgia, NBC-38 WLTZ-TV in Columbus, Georgia, CBS-19 WLTX-TV in Columbia, South Carolina, and a country western format radio station in Savannah, Georgia, WJCL-FM, as well as three classic rock‚Äìformatted stations in Jackson, WSTZ-FM, Vicksburg, Mississippi's WSTZ-AM, and Columbia, South Carolina's WNOK. In the mid-1970s Lewis acquired the Savannah Business Journal newspaper. Lewis was instrumental in developing the southside of Savannah, along Abercorn Street and an adjacent area of the city presently known as Habersham Woods. Much of the latter was an outgrowth of his Oakdale tract. He also sold the land that facilitated the construction of Oglethorpe Mall and the subsequent surrounding retail areas. =Mayorship= Mayor Lewis and Gov. Lester Maddox breaking ground on the Savannah Civic Center (1970) In 1966 Lewis became the first Republican mayor of a Georgia city since Reconstruction.Savannah Morning News, August 3, 1966 His entire slate of six Republican aldermanic candidates were elected to City Hall. Although he did not exploit the racial issues, he benefited from a backlash from white voters against the popular Democratic incumbent, Malcolm Maclean. Many white segregationists considered that Maclean had been too soft on matters of race. After four years in office, Lewis lost his last-minute reelection bid to Democratic nominee John Rousakis, who succeeded Lewis in 1970.Savannah Morning News, August 5, 1970 During his tenure at city hall, Lewis was directly responsible for the construction of the Savannah Civic Center (completed in 1974), the planning of the Harry S. Truman Parkway, and played a pivotal role in the revitalization of the city's River Street‚Äî‚Äînow a magnet for tourists. As mayor he also instituted the Model Cities Program, part of a national effort to erase neglect in blighted neighborhoods, and successfully led efforts to designate Wassaw Island, a large barrier island southeast of Savannah, a U.S. Wildlife Refuge in 1969. Construction of the city's sewerage treatment plant was also completed during his term. In the early 1960s, Lewis, a former YMCA president, donated of land on South Habersham Street and went on to lead the 1964 capital funds campaign. This eventually resulted in the YMCA Family Center on Habersham renamed in 2007, the YMCA J.C. Lewis, Jr. Family Center ‚Äì Habersham in Savannah.Habersham Street YMCA Celebrates Renovations He subsequently donated the adjacent tract of land for the formation of Memorial Baptist Church and Memorial Day School. Lewis was the primary benefactor in the Grace House and the Magdalene and Phoenix Projects. While serving as Mayor in 1967, he was approached by then Sheriff Wilkes S. MacFeeley about establishing and operating a \\"One Hundred Club\\" to provide financial support to the families of law enforcement officers and firefighters killed in the line of duty. The club was established in 1968, with Lewis serving as the president until 1976. =Later years and death= In the 1970s and '80s Lewis owned and operated a group of hotels including the Howard Johnson's in Hardeeville, South Carolina, Savannah's Downtowner Motor Inn (which later became the Ramada Inn downtown Savannah), and the Ramada Inn in Melbourne, Florida. All three hotels were new concepts for their day, which Lewis constructed with a nod to his native Savannah: He strayed from the Downtowner corporate concept and added the locally inspired Savannah wrought-iron railings to fit the locale. The Savannah Ramada Inn was later sold to Savannah College of Art and Design in 1987 and converted into the school's first dormitory, enabling much of the school's subsequent growth. The adjacent property on Oglethorpe Avenue still bearing the original J.C. Lewis signage, the site of second J.C. Lewis Motor Company location, was also sold to SCAD to become the school's gymnasium, ClubSCAD. Lewis died at Candler Hospital in Savannah on August 6, 2005, at age 79. He suffered from leukemia for several years. He had remained active in the community, serving as a director on numerous civic and business boards throughout the southeast up until his death. Private life and philanthropy 1970: Lewis meets with GOP presidential nominee Richard Nixon and Nixon's running mate, Governor Spiro Agnew, at the Bahia Hotel, San Diego Lewis married Nancy Nelson and together they had six children and 11 grandchildren. He was an avid yachtsman, amateur radio operator (FCC EXTRA Class), family man, and Sunday School teacher (church deacon). The businessman and former mayor was one of Georgia's leading figures in the 20th century and one of the South's most generous philanthropists. In a local TV interview with WTOC-TV that aired just after Lewis' 2005 funeral, then-Savannah mayor Dr. Otis S. Johnson stated that \\"Curtis Lewis was Savannah's most generous philanthropist. The question is who is going to pick up where he left off.\\" That same day former Savannah Congressman Jack Kingston offered a similar sentiment on Lewis' beneficence to the hostess city, stating: \\"Not since James Oglethorpe has someone done for Savannah what Mr. J.C. Lewis, Jr. did in his lifetime.\\" Lewis in 1970 at the dedication of the Skidaway Island Oceanographic Institute (L to R, President Richard Nixon and Patricia Nixon) Lewis is remembered as a very generous man who was never too busy to listen to others' needs. His 501c3 family foundation, established in 1953, is the largest family foundation in terms of assets in Chatham County, the largest county in population in the state of Georgia outside of metro Atlanta. Lewis was the primary benefactor and sustained numerous organizations and various charitable groups over the years throughout the southeast with a focus on the Savannah area donating untold sums in the multiple millions in cash to numerous organizations (many times unknown to the public) including over $5 million to the Union Mission (August 23, 2005 Savannah Morning News), which provides shelter for men, women, and families, short- and long-term housing assistance, health and dental care, behavioral counseling, substance abuse programs, life skills training, job training and employment assistance to the low-income population of the Coastal Empire, and to the First Baptist Church of Savannah on Chippewa Square, where Lewis was a member for 66 years. On its campus are the Lewis Fellowship Hall and Mahogany Altar. He also donated the land and buildings for the Skidaway Island Baptist Church, the Savannah Baptist Center, The J.C. Lewis Primary Health Center (which has become a national model program for healthcare for the indigent saving hospitals millions in impoverished care costs annually), the J.C. Lewis Dental Center, The J.C. Lewis Promotion Center (undisclosed sum) and has grown to include the freestanding J.C. Lewis Primary Health Care Pediatric Center on Waters avenue, and The J.C. Lewis Behavioral Health Center as well as the Chatham County Republican Party headquarters on Abercorn Street. Lewis also donated the land for numerous other nonprofit groups throughout the Savannah area including the Congregation Agudath Achimhttp://www.jta.org/1966/11/04/archive/savannah-mayor-presents-land-to- jewish-congregation-for-synagogue and the B'nai B'rith Jacob Synagogue's apartment complex, The Episcopal Church of Oakdale, Georgia, The Skidaway Island Community Center, Virginia Heard Public School, New Hope African Baptist Church of Savannah, The Word of God building & (Alzheimer's Association Coastal Georgia Region), and a portion of the land for The Savannah Jewish Educational Alliance (JEA) as well as a portion of the land for the Jepson Center for the Arts of the Telfair Museum of the Arts in downtown Savannah which houses the J.C. and Nancy Lewis Gallery on its top floor featuring rotating exhibits throughout the year. Lewis was also a major benefactor of the Savannah Country Day School's Lewis Leadership Center and Savannah Christian Preparatory School's Nancy N Lewis and JC Lewis Fine Arts Hall as well as the 50 million dollar Nancy N. and J.C. Lewis Cancer and Research Pavilion at St. Josephs / Candler Hospital System; the 62,000 sq ft cancer center is the Savannah region's only National Cancer Institute selected facility. Lewis endowed over one million dollars in 2003 to the JC and Nancy Lewis Christian Missions Endowment Fund of Woodberry Forest School in Orange, Virginia. Lewis established the German Heritage society's scholarship fund with members of the Society contributing to further the education of German students in the United States and American students in Germany.

Initially created as a venue for motor racing, it was converted to a ¬Ω-mile harness racing facility (the actual circumference was 165 feet shorter or 15/32-mile). The harness racing facility operated from September 2, 1940 until July 15, 1988. It was the original home of the Messenger Stakes, part of the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers. The raceway hosted the event until it closed. It was also the first track to use the now universal \\"mobile starting gate\\". The operation was sold in 1984 on the condition it was to remain an operating racetrack, but the facilities deteriorated, attendance dropped off, and the plant was no longer profitable. The site of Roosevelt Raceway is part of the Hempstead Plains, located in an unincorporated area of the Town of Hempstead, within the Westbury 11590 Zip Code. It is located near where the first English Governor of New York, Richard Nicolls, established the \\"Newmarket Course\\", the first horse racing track in North America (and the first organized sport of any kind) in the territory that would become the United States, in 1664.LI Sports: A Chronology Racing = Auto racing = Following the end of the Great Depression, George Washington Vanderbilt III, George Preston Marshall and Eddie Rickenbacker raised money to build a new home for the dormant Vanderbilt Cup, which had last been run in 1916. 1908 Vanderbilt Cup winner George Robertson was hired to oversee construction of the facility.1936 Vanderbilt Cup The land was acquired by lease of the land that was \\"Unit 2\\" of the Roosevelt Field airport, and was the site of the runway from which Charles Lindbergh took off in the Spirit of St. Louis. The original raceway was twisty and bumpy, not quite suited to the big-bore big-BHP racecars of the day, and a number of the drivers did not like the track. The 1937 layout was faster, with fewer corners and longer straights. Despite these adaptations, no GP motor car races were held there afterwards. The track has been recreated in at least two racing games, Spirit of Speed 1937 and the Grand Prix Legends racing simulation.Roosevelt = Harness racing = The property was leased in 1939 by a group of investors (Old Country Trotting Association) led by George Morton Levy with the intention of opening a harness racing track. However, unlike previous incarnations of the sport, Levy's track would race at night, with single heat races, in an attempt to bring the \\"hick sport\\" to the populous Long Island area. With World War II in progress, attendance and profit were minimal in the first few years.http://www.newsday.com/community/guide/lihistory/ny-historysports- roos,0,3783373.story?coll=ny-lihistory-navigation Roosevelt: The Rise and Fall The track opened September 2, 1940 with a crowd of 5,000 which bet a total of $40,742 and saw the first race won by the horse \\"Martha Lee\\".  Expansion and innovation  One of the difficulties harness racing faced was the start of races, which usually required multiple restarts to make sure each entrant had an equal chance. On May 24, 1946, Levy introduced the mobile starting gate, which eliminated most restart-related delays. Attendance quickly boomed. On June 30, 1956 the track would host the inaugural Messenger Stakes, part of the new \\"Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers\\". The race was won by Belle Acton, who tied the track record and won $32,320. In 1957 a new, much larger grandstand was opened, which included such features as dining and air conditioned areas, as well as a new toteboard. The grandstand was known as the \\"Dream Track\\". On August 20, 1960 attendance was 54,861 for a racing card that included the International Trot, which at the time was the largest crowd to witness a horse race in the U.S. By 1956 the original Vanderbilt grandstands were burdened by excessive additions and dangerous decay. Within the next season the new clubhouse-grandstand \\"plant\\" replaced the old Vanderbilt track without interruption of the racing schedule. The new building was designed by Arthur Froehlich who designed other innovative modern structures. The architectural plans cost $400,000 and the building was proposed at $12 million. In the end the new \\"Dream Track\\" (as it was nicknamed) cost $20 million. (The various tote boards alone cost approximately $800,000.) The new \\"plant\\" consisted of five levels with suspended security levels between floors. It boasted a 14-bed hospital with a fully functional operating room, radio and television broadcast rooms and two restaurants run by Harry M. Stevens, Inc. A new synthetic track was constructed and more than 105,000 watts of light lit its homestretch. Closed circuit television of each race was broadcast throughout the grandstand.  Historic moments  On opening night (September 2, 1940) the horse, Miss June, collapsed and died on the track after winning the fifth race. In 1942, George Levy was saddled with mounting debt. He would have to raise $20,000 or forfeit the raceway. This loan would prove almost disastrous to Roosevelt Raceway when Levy came under investigation of the Kefauver Committee in the 1950s. In 1944 the Raceway was in dire straits (again) and about to be evicted from the premises for $70,000 back rent, Mr. Levy bargained to purchase the land for the meager sum of $950,000 (satisfied on May 17, 1956). On November 8, 1963, only two horses finished following a mid-race crash. The race was declared official, which angered many of the 23,127 fans in attendance that night, setting off a riot. First throwing bottles and other debris, the fans then began jumping over the railing, smashing the tote board, and then attacking first the judges booth and then the police who attempted to interfere. After the fans began to set fires, arriving firemen set their hoses on the rioters to push them back. 15 people were treated for injuries. In 1964 the largest twin double was hit for 172,726.80 for a $2 ticket by Robert and Mary Froner. The property was utilized by several organizations for other events. After Roosevelt Raceway closed in 1988, the Plain and Fancy Shows, Inc used the facility as a flea market. Roosevelt Raceway was the first race track to be accepted by the American Stock Exchange (1956). = Festival of Hope Rockfest = In August 1972, Nassau County's first major rock festival took place at Roosevelt Raceway when the Nassau Easter Seals Society presented the Festival of Hope Rockfest. The 2-day festival featured performances by Ike & Tina Turner, Sly & The Family Stone, Jefferson Airplane, Chuck Berry, James Brown, The Shirelles, Sha-na-na, Billy Preston, Dr. Hook, Looking Glass, Bo Diddly, Stephen Stills, McKendree Spring, Elephant's Memory, The James Gang, and Commander Cody. = Summersault '74 = The most notable event was a rock concert; \\"Summersault '74\\", which drew a crowd of 75,000 (and featured performances by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Joni Mitchell, Jesse Colin Young, and the Beach Boys).  Decline, closure, and post-closure  It has been speculated that introduction of off-track betting in New York in 1971 had caused a decline in attendance at all the state's racetracks, which was then exacerbated by the opening of the Meadowlands Racetrack in 1976, which was located much closer to Manhattan, and had regular buses to and from the Port Authority, compared to a single \\"track bus\\" that ran once or twice an evening each way. In the case of Roosevelt Raceway, commercial growth outside the raceway brought new attractions that diverted people to other interests. In the end, Roosevelt Raceway's ticket sales could barely support its daily operating costs. In addition, the land value began to skyrocket, making Roosevelt Raceway a target for developers with purposes of demolition and development attempts were opposed by citizens of Nassau County citing loss of jobs. In 1984 the site was sold by Madison Square Garden, at the time a subsidiary of Gulf+Western, to a group of investors (Roosevelt Raceway Associates) led by incumbent raceway president Bill Hopkins and investor Charles L. Evans, via $54 million in tax- free bonds issued by the Town of Hempstead Industrial Development Agency. At the time of purchase they promised \\" . . to successfully operate the Roosevelt Raceway in its existing location and to preserve a traditional source of enjoyment and revenue for the citizens of Hempstead and surrounding communities.\\" But Raceway Associates closed the track in 1988, and became embroiled in a controversy over the bonds, that would lead to an investigation that would include New York Senator Alfonse D'Amato. No one would be found guilty of any legal wrongdoing. At the time of closure, the property was valued at approximately $200 million. The investment group was unable to develop the site, and as the facilities were not maintained, the grandstand and stables began to decay and the track removed. Although shopping centers were soon built on the former parking lots and stable areas, the grandstand would not be demolished until 2002. Little remains of Roosevelt Raceway, other than the name, which still graces a shopping center, known as Westbury Plaza, and an AMC Theatres movie theater located on the former parking lot. The site of the grandstand and track which lay vacant for years is now the site of a luxury condominium complex, Meadowbrook Pointe, which began operation in 2006. The shopping center and movie theater are located five minutes away from the Roosevelt Field Mall. The area to the east, now a Home Depot, was the location of the stables. The last plot of Raceway property was converted into the Archstone Apartment complex.

Like their predecessors in the Nahda movement (or the \\"Arab Renaissance\\"), writers of the Mahjar movement were stimulated by their personal encounter with the Western world and participated in the renewal of Arabic literature, hence their proponents being sometimes referred to as writers of the \\"late Nahda\\". These writers, in South America as well as the United States, contributed indeed to the development of the Nahda in the early 20th century.Somekh, \\"The Neo-Classical Poets\\" in M.M.

North America  = First periodicals = Kawkab America As worded by David Levinson and Melvin Ember, \\"the drive to sustain some Arab cultural identity\\" among the immigrant communities in North America \\"was reinforced from the beginning when educated immigrants launched Arabic-language newspapers and literary societies in both the New York and Boston areas to encourage poetry and writing, with the aim of keeping alive and enriching the Arabic cultural heritage.\\" Thus, in 1892, the first American Arabic-language newspaper, Kawkab America, was founded in New York and continued until 1908, and the first Arabic-language magazine Al-Funoon was published by Nasib Arida in New York from 1913 to 1918. This magazine served as a mouthpiece for young Mahjari writers. = The Pen League = Four members of the Pen League in 1920. Left to right: Nasib Arida, Kahlil Gibran, Abd al-Masih Haddad, and Mikhail Naimy The Pen League ( / ) was the first Arabic-language literary society in North America, formed initially by Nasib Arida and Abd al-Masih Haddad in 1915 or 1916, and subsequently re-formed in 1920 by a larger group of Mahjari writers in New York led by Kahlil Gibran. They had been working closely since 1911. The league dissolved following Gibran's death in 1931 and Mikhail Naimy's return to Lebanon in 1932. The primary goals of the Pen League were, in Naimy's words as Secretary, \\"to lift Arabic literature from the quagmire of stagnation and imitation, and to infuse a new life into its veins so as to make of it an active force in the building up of the Arab nations\\"., qtd. by Nadeem Naimy in The Lebanese Prophets of New York, American University of Beirut, 1985, p. 18. As Naimy expressed in the by-laws he drew up for the group: > The tendency to keep our language and literature within the narrow bounds of > aping the ancients in form and substance is a most pernicious tendency; if > left unopposed, it will soon lead to decay and disintegration... To imitate > them is a deadly shame... We must be true to ourselves if we would be true > to our ancestors., qtd. by Nadeem Naimy in The Lebanese Prophets of New > York, American University of Beirut, 1985, pp. 18-18. Literary historian Nadeem Naimy assesses the group's importance as having shifted the criteria of aesthetic merit in Arabic literature: > Focusing on Man rather than on language, on the human rather than on the law > and on the spirit rather than on the letter, the Mahjar (Arab emigrant) > School is said to have ushered Arabic literature from its age old classicism > into the modern era. Members of the Pen League included: Nasib Arida, Rashid Ayyub, Wadi Bahout, William Catzeflis (or Katsiflis), Kahlil Gibran (Chairman), Abd al-Masih Haddad, Nadra Haddad, Elia Abu Madi, Mikhail Naimy (Secretary), and Ameen Rihani. Musicians such as Russell Bunai were also associated with the group.  South America  The first Arabic-language newspaper in Brazil, Al-Fai√°h ( / ), appeared in Campinas in November 1895, followed by Al-Brasil ( / ) in Santos less than six months later.

He lives in Karaka south of Auckland. Biography Douglas made his first foray into politics in 1975 when he unsuccessfully sought the Labour Party candidacy for following the retirement of Hugh Watt. In early 1977 he contemplated standing as a candidate for the Labour Party nomination in the Mangere by-election, however he ultimately decided to withdraw from the candidacy race. He then put his name forward for the newly created seat in south Auckland, , defeating former cabinet minister Colin Moyle to win nomination. He won the election and represented the electorate from 25 November 1978 after the 1978 general election, until 24 May 1979, when he was unseated by a decision of the Electoral Court in favour of National Party candidate Winston Peters. The court declared Peters elected on election night. The petition involved the methods of voting allowable, 'ticks and crosses'. Following his ejection from Parliament, Douglas then unsuccessfully stood for the Labour nomination at the 1980 Onehunga by-election. Douglas garnered much support among local members and quickly became a frontrunner in the race and won the floor vote of members at the selection meeting, with over twice as many votes as the next two candidates (Dorothy Jelicich and Fred Gerbic) combined. However he still ended up losing, with Gerbic getting the nod. Later in 1980 he put his name forward to replace long serving MP Warren Freer in the safe Labour seat of Mount Albert, but missed out on the nomination to Helen Clark. In 1981 he stood for nomination in the Roskill electorate, losing out on nomination to Phil Goff. In 1990, Douglas was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. He is a son of Norman Douglas and a brother of Roger Douglas, both (ex) Labour Party politicians. Malcolm Douglas managed his brother's 2008 election campaign in the Hunua electorate when he stood for ACT New Zealand; he came third in the electorate, but was elected as number three on the party list.

Victor, a wooden-hulled motor-boat constructed at Camden, New Jersey, by Clement A. Troth, and completed in 1917, was leased by the Navy on 27 November 1917 from George H. Earle, Jr., of Haverford, Pennsylvania; and commissioned on 26 December 1917, Ens. George H. Earle, III, in command.  World War I service  Operating out of Cape May, New Jersey, Victor patrolled the entrance to Delaware Bay for the duration of the war. During her naval service, two incidents stood out to enliven her otherwise uneventful routine; and both occurred in February 1918.  Engine room explosion  While the boat was on patrol on the 10th of the month, an explosion in the vessel's engine room started a fire at 1530. The crew fought the flames with fire extinguishers and formed a bucket brigade back to the stern. Not having a wireless, Victor hoisted distress signals‚Äîincluding an upside down national ensign‚Äîfired a gun to attract attention to her plight, and sounded her klaxon horn. Meanwhile, her small boat was manned, lowered, and sent out to obtain assistance as the fire made enough headway to convince some on board that their chance of putting it out was slim. Members of the crew not fighting the fire began to construct a makeshift raft out of doors, tops of berths, hatchways, and tables, while still others moved ammunition astern to prevent its catching fire and exploding. All life preservers were moved on deck, ready for use. However, the dogged efforts of the firefighters brought the blaze under control by 1605; and it was completely extinguished by 1610. Soon thereafter, arrived on the scene and towed Victor back to port for repairs.  Rescuing crashed seaplane pilot and passenger  On 25 February, while Victor lay at anchor at the section base, a seaplane, piloted by Ens. Walker Weed, USNRF, tried to make a landing at Cold Spring Inlet, but instead fell on the opposite side of the base, on the beach. An explosion followed the crash, and the plane burst into flames with its occupants still on board. Sounding \\"man overboard,\\" Victor and Emerald sent boats shoreward with rescue parties. The pilot, Ensign Weed, his clothes afire, stumbled from the blazing aircraft and plunged headlong into the water to extinguish the flames. Meanwhile, his passenger, named Bennett, staggered out of the fire but passed out before he could reach the water's edge. Victor's men ran to his aid, extinguished the fire, and saw to it that the injured flyer's wounds were dressed and treated.  Final duties  Victor remained on harbor entrance patrol duties at Cape May, New Jersey, until four days before the armistice which ended the war in Europe. Shifted then to Delaware River patrol duties in the area of the antisubmarine nets, Victor sailed for Camden, New Jersey. She was decommissioned there on 21 November 1918 and returned to her owner.

Infanterie-Division (Chronik 1915/1918) It was part of a wave of new infantry divisions formed in 1915. The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The division was formed primarily from the excess infantry regiments of existing divisions which were being triangularized. The division's 213th Infantry Brigade was formerly the 98th Reserve Infantry Brigade of the 49th Reserve Division, and came to the division with the 227th Reserve Infantry Regiment. The 52nd Reserve Infantry Regiment came from the 5th Reserve Division and the 232nd Reserve Infantry Regiment came from the 50th Reserve Division. Combat chronicle The 107th Infantry Division initially served on the Eastern Front, seeing its first action in the Battle of Lemberg (now Lviv) and later participating in the capture of Brest-Litovsk and of Pinsk. It was then transferred south to participate in the Serbian Campaign. After a brief respite on the Macedonian front, the division went back to Russia at the beginning of January 1916. In November 1917, the division was sent to the Western Front, entering the line in the German \\"Siegfried\\" position. It fought in the tank Battle of Cambrai in November 1917 and in the German counterattack in December. In April 1918, the division participated in the German Spring Offensive, fighting in the First Battle of the Somme (1918), also known as the Second Battle of the Somme (to distinguish it from the 1916 battle). It remained in the Somme salient and fought against various Allied counteroffensives. The division moved to the St. Mihiel salient in September and then occupied the line in the Wo√´vre region. In October, it met the Allied Meuse-Argonne Offensive. The division remained in the line until the end of the war.

The tax, under a law passed by the Tennessee General Assembly in January 2005, was applied to illegal substances including cocaine, marijuana, and moonshine. Drug dealers were required to pay anonymously at the state revenue office, where they received a stamp to prove their payment. If a drug dealer was arrested without having a stamp, the state would seek the money owed it. In 2009 the Tennessee Supreme Court judged in a 3-2 ruling that the Crack Tax is unconstitutional, and repealed it. Challenge and repeal Steven Waters sought to challenge the statute after Tennessee Department of Revenue agents decided to seize his home in a drug sting operation. A county court found the law unconstitutional because it violated the drug dealer's Fifth Amendment right to protection from self-incrimination. The Tennessee Court of Appeals upheld the lower court's decision, unanimously declaring the law to be \\"arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable, and therefore invalid under the constitution of this state.\\" The opinion was written by Judge Sharon G. Lee. Governor Phil Bredesen stated on September 14, 2007 that the crack tax should be ended, though State Revenue Commissioner Reagan Farr has said that the state will continue to enforce the tax. A meeting was planned by officials with the state attorney general to determine whether to appeal to the Tennessee Supreme Court. Since 2005, Tennessee had collected more than $6 million from the crack tax, much of which came from confiscated property. In 2006 alone, the state collected $1.8 million.

NADP+ is an essential coenzyme that is reduced to NADPH primarily by the pentose phosphate pathway to provide reducing power in biosynthetic processes such as fatty acid biosynthesis and nucleotide synthesis. The structure of the NADK from the archaean Archaeoglobus fulgidus has been determined. In humans, the genes NADK and MNADK encode NAD+ kinases localized in cytosol and mitochondria, respectively. Similarly, yeast have both cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms, and the yeast mitochondrial isoform accepts both NAD+ and NADH as substrates for phosphorylation.  Reaction  ATP + NAD+ \\\\rightleftharpoons ADP + NADP+  Mechanism  NADK phosphorylates NAD+ at the 2‚Äô position of the ribose ring that carries the adenine moiety. It is highly selective for its substrates, NAD and ATP, and does not tolerate modifications either to the phosphoryl acceptor, NAD, or the pyridine moiety of the phosphoryl donor, ATP. NADK also uses metal ions to coordinate the ATP in the active site. In vitro studies with various divalent metal ions have shown that zinc and manganese are preferred over magnesium, while copper and nickel are not accepted by the enzyme at all. A proposed mechanism involves the 2' alcohol oxygen acting as a nucleophile to attack the gamma-phosphoryl of ATP, releasing ADP. Proposed mechanism of action for NAD+ phosphorylation by NADK  Regulation  NADK is highly regulated by the redox state of the cell. Whereas NAD is predominantly found in its oxidized state NAD+, the phosphorylated NADP is largely present in its reduced form, as NADPH. Thus, NADK can modulate responses to oxidative stress by controlling NADP synthesis. Bacterial NADK is shown to be inhibited allosterically by both NADPH and NADH. NADK is also reportedly stimulated by calcium/calmodulin binding in certain cell types, such as neutrophils. NAD kinases in plants and sea urchin eggs have also been found to bind calmodulin.  Clinical significance  Due to the essential role of NADPH in lipid and DNA biosynthesis and the hyperproliferative nature of most cancers, NADK is an attractive target for cancer therapy. Furthermore, NADPH is required for the antioxidant activities of thioredoxin reductase and glutaredoxin. Thionicotinamide and other nicotinamide analogs are potential inhibitors of NADK, and studies show that treatment of colon cancer cells with thionicotinamide suppresses the cytosolic NADPH pool to increase oxidative stress and synergizes with chemotherapy. While the role of NADK in increasing the NADPH pool appears to offer protection against apoptosis, there are also cases where NADK activity appears to potentiate cell death. Genetic studies done in human haploid cell lines indicate that knocking out NADK may protect from certain non-apoptotic stimuli.

The summit of Sahale Mountain is referred to as Sahale Peak. It is south of its higher neighbor, Boston Peak, and the saddle between the two is lower than Sahale's summit. Quien Sabe Glacier is to the west of the ridge between the two peaks while Davenport Glacier is in a cirque east of this ridge and above Horseshoe Basin. Sahale Glacier is south of the summit and east of Sahale Arm, a ridge that extends southwest from Sahale to Cascade Pass. The name Sahale may originate from a Northwest Native American word meaning \\"high place,\\" \\"falcon,\\" or \\"sacred.\\" Climbing Sahale Peak is noted for its panoramic views and is popular among mountaineers. The least technical route follows the Sahale Arm from the Cascade Pass Trail to the Sahale Glacier. From the glacier there is a 3‚Äì4 climb to the summit. Another option is to traverse from the Sahale Arm onto the Quien Sabe Glacier and climb the glacier to the rock ridge north of the peak. The climb up this ridge is also class 3‚Äì4 but crosses some loose rock and is more exposed. Cascade Pass and the Sahale Arm can be reached from Marblemount to the west or from the east, it is accessible via a trail, from Stehekin, up the Stehekin River valley. Climate Sahale and Sahale Arm in winter Sahale is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Geology Sharkfin Tower, Boston Peak, Sahale, Quien Sabe Glacier seen from Hidden Lake Peaks The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Geography, language and demographics  Ejemekwuru is a community in Oguta Local Government Areahttps://citypopulation.de/php/nigeria-admin.php?adm2id=NGA017017 of Imo Statehttps://www.imostate.gov.ng/, in southeastern Nigeria. The people are tribal Igbos, and predominantly speak the Igbo language with a dialect that is close to central Igbo. Ejemekwuru is situated along the Ogbaku-Oguta road, 15km from Owerri, 6km from Ogbaku, and 17km from Kalabari Beach in Oguta. It is bounded to the west by Agwa, to the east by Ishieke in Azara Obi Ato, to the north by Akabor and Izombe, and to the south by Ogbaku communities. Ejemekwuru is also at the southeastern boundary of Oguta Local Government Area. The town is approximately 16 sq.km in area with 1/3 of the area currently used for residential living, and the remaining 2/3 of the land area used as agricultural farmland. Ejemekwuru was elevated to the status of an Autonomous Community by the Imo State Government, effective January 1996. This elevation was published in the Imo State of Nigeria Extraordinary Gazette, no 2, vol 21 published in April 1996. Prior to this status elevation, the town was a part of the Awa Autonomous Community. Ejemekwuru is made up of five (5) primary groups of villages. These are Umuagwu, Umuebe, Umuawo, Umuoduwa, and Umuakum. Each group has its own administrative unit, and within each group are smaller villages and kindreds. Four major roads run north-south, and east- west to connect the community to other parts of Imo State. The North-South bound road also known as the Ogbaku-Oguta road connects Ogbaku to the south of Ejemekwuru to Izombe (and eventually Oguta) to the north of Ejemekwuru. The East-West road is the Azara Obiato-Agwa road connecting Agwa to the west of Ejemekwuru to Azara Obiato to the east of Ejemekwuru. Along the Ejemekwuru- Ogbaku major road is the community‚Äôs major market ‚Äì Nkwo Ejemekwuru market square. Lying opposite this central market square is the very dense tropical rain forest which doubles as the sacred shrine of the deity Ezeala, hence the name of the forest - Oke Ohia Ezeala. This sacred forest has historical significance for the people of Ejemekwuru. Other smaller regional markets exist in the villages such as the Nkwoala market which now primarily functions as a daily market and sits along the Ejemekwuru-Agwa road in Umuebe village, the now-defunct Eke Eburu market in Umuakum village, and Eke Amadioha market at the intersection of Ogbaku-Oguta road and Agwa-Azara Obiato road. The climate in Ejemekwuru is the tropical rain forest, with two seasons ‚Äì the rainy season (udu mmiri) which runs between April and October, and the dry season (okochi) which runs from November through March.  Culture and traditions  = Origin = There are different orally transmitted accounts pointing to the ancestral origin of the people of Ejemekwuru. However, the various accounts point to one individual ‚Äì Ekwuru as the ancestral patriarch and the head of the ancestral genealogy of the Ejemekwuru people. According to one account, Ekwuru is said to have arrived from Etekwuru in the regions of Ohaji and Egbema a few millennia ago to inhabit this virgin and pristine fertile land, teeming with wildlife that came to be named after him. There is a counter school of thought that suggests that the reverse was the case i.e. Etekwuru had originated from Ekwuru. Yet another account suggests both Ekwuru and Etekwuru were brothers who both migrated from the Oru area. The name ‚ÄòEjemekwuru‚Äô metamorphosized from the narrative that Akabo (who was a brother to Ekwuru and the founder of the neighboring Akabo community to the north of Ejemekwuru) would say ‚Äòejem nga Ekwuru‚Äô meaning ‚ÄòI am going to the home of Ekwuru‚Äô whenever he was visiting his brother. ‚ÄòEjem nga Ekwuru‚Äô would later become ‚ÄòEjemekwuru‚Äô. Another account - which is a purely cultural mythology (similar to other cultural myths of the Igbo people) and included in this narrative for completeness, states that a big gourd exploded and released many people, who later became the ancestors of different towns and villages. This account explains that it was from this gourd (Agbugba gbawara mmadu) that Ekwuru came out. Clearly, not much was recorded or passed down about the father of Ekwuru and that continues to remain a myth. The present-day people of Ejemekwuru are descendants of 3 brothers ‚Äì Njioke, Ebechere, and Awo born to the ancestral patriarch, Ekwuru. Njioke, the first son of Ekwuru had 3 sons namely Agwu, Akum, and Oduwa. The groups of villages in Ejemekwuru are direct descendants of these sons of Ekwuru namely: * Umuagwu, descendants of Agwu * Umuakum, descendants of Akum * Umuoduwa, descendants of Oduwa * Umuebe, descendants of Ebechere * Umuawo, descendants of Awo =Social system= Before the advent of Christianity, the social life of the people of Ejemekwuru was ordered in accordance with their spiritual beliefs that were rooted in the worship of the Patron deity of the town (Ezeala Ejemekwuru). Oracles and shrines for the Patron deity were erected in the sacred forest (Oke Ohia Ezeala), and worshippers would make sacrifices and offer prayers at these shrines and oracles for protection from evil forces, for a good crop yield after the planting season and for good health, and a good life. Part of the social norms were societal virtues that were upheld. Some of these included: Truthfulness (Ezi okwu), Non-violence (Igbu ochu), Kindness and Compassion (Obi oma & Idi na otu), Purity and Chastity (Obi ocha). On the other hand, some of the negative attributes and abominable acts were: Ikwa iko (adultery), Izu oshi (thievery), Anya ukwu (avarice or greed), Anya nji (envy). Acts of abomination necessitated purification rites, known as Ikwa Ala. = Days of the week and seasons of the year = The week has 4 days (Eke, Orie, Afor, Nkwo), and the year has two seasons ‚Äì the rainy season (udu mmiri) which runs between April and October, and the dry season (okochi) which runs from November through March. The planting season begins after the cold months of January and February, with bush clearing and burning of shrubs (igbu oru), planting of yam, corn, cassava and pumpkin, etc. = Traditional festivals = Owu, a festival of cultural dance is celebrated after the planting season at the beginning of the rainy season. The first part of the Owu festival is the Igbu awa immediately after the planting season. Following this in the second part Ito nkwa which takes place at the premises of the head of the Owu society (Onye Ishi Owu). Eight days after is the main part of the festival ‚Äì the owu dance when all and sundry gather for the traditional dance. This dance festival symbolizes a sacred invocation of the spirits of the ancestors to come and dwell with us on earth as masquerades (Okoroshi) for a month-long period of solemnity. Four days after, the masquerades begin to cry at night, and eight days later, they start to spear in the day time. Only men that are initiated through the igba mmii rites of passage are allowed to join the Okoroshi society. Women and children are excluded and are supposed to be terrified at the approach of the masquerades. The Okoroshi sings and dances in unique and special language peculiar to itself alone. For sixteen days, except on Nkwo market days, the Okoroshi parades the whole town from dusk to dawn paying visits to elders, and dignitaries and chiefs, who offer gifts of money, wine and food (consumed in secret), while taking the pleasure in pursuing girls, boys and young men who are not members of the Okoroshi society. If unmasked or uninitiated people use the language of the Okoroshi, they are usually subjected to heavy fines called aria Okoroshi. There is the Okoroshi Oma which wears a beautiful face, Okoroshi Ojoo which wears a fearful and ugly face and Ajakaja which is dressed with young palm branches. In modern times with the advent of Christianity, this festival has lost its spiritual significance and solemnity. It is simply celebrated by the youth these days as a festival of traditional song and dance. The end of the Okoroshi festival leads to the dawn of the harvesting season, which is celebrated as Iri ji ohuru (new yam festival). During this period full-grown yam tubers, corn, pumpkin, and melon are harvested and enjoyed. Special storage facilities such as barns (obah), and (uko), wooden racks are used to preserve the harvest for later consumption and planting. In this manner the full year was completed, and the cycle of life went on for this ancient community prior to the advent of modernity with the arrival of colonial masters from Europe. = Other traditional practices = Other traditional practices included stipulated norms for marriage, funeral, childbirth and naming ceremonies. In Ejemekwuru‚Äôs tradition, male children were circumcised (ibe ugwu) on the 8th day, a tradition that is still practiced to date. In addition, the people practiced ile omugwo when, after a woman had given birth to a child, a very close and experienced relative of her, in most cases her mother was required by tradition to come and spend time with her and her husband, assisting her with household chores, while the new mom focused on breastfeeding the newborn. The naming ceremony of a newborn child was equally an important cultural event. Names bore meanings and interpretations that were consistent with the circumstances leading to or surrounding the birth of the child. For example, a child born after many years of expectation for a child would be named Ogugua meaning ‚Äòchild that has cleaned my tears‚Äô. Similarly, a child born after many years of barrenness, if a boy, could be named Amaechi or Obiechina or Ahamefule and a child born during a bumper harvest would be named Obianuju. Other naming conventions included naming children after the name of the market day in which they were born ‚Äì Nweke, Nworie, Nwafor, and Nwankwo were names given to children born on the respective market days Eke, Orie, Afor and Nkwo. Chieftaincy (Nze na Ozo) ordination also followed stipulated norms. Before the coming of the British colonial government, the affairs of the town were governed by traditional title holders - Ndi Nze na Ozo, Ndi Nze (also known as Ndi Mgbirichi), and Ndi Ishi Owu (head of the Okoroshi society), as well as elders, who ensured the smooth functioning. These chiefs also meted out punishment (igba aria) to people who defiled the land through misdeeds and acts misconduct. There is also a spirit of brotherly love and unity which the people of Ejemekwuru express through their age-old fondness for addressing each other as nwunnem (literally; my mother‚Äôs child), which means brother or sister.  Local economy and primary occupation  The only economic activity of the indigenes right up to the advent of colonization by Europeans was farming in the form of subsistence farming, animal husbandry and hunting of wildlife. The people grew yams, cassava, maize, melon, and fluted pumpkin. Plantains, bananas, okra, and cocoyams were planted around residential areas. The people practice shifting cultivation i.e. a piece of land is left fallow for a period of five to six years between cultivation. Oil palm trees are found in the wild scattered in the farmlands and these were additional sources of revenue for the people from either the direct sale of the palm heads or the sale of the processed palm oil and palm kernels. The land is owned communally at the extended family household, and at the beginning of each planting season, the head of each family shares the piece of land available for farming for that given year. Beyond farming, residents are also into commerce mostly agricultural commodities trading, handcrafts, palm wine taping, and a host of other jobs.  Education and other public amenities  Ejemekwuru has 3 public elementary schools ‚Äì namely Community School Ejemekwuru (formerly St. Peters Catholic School), Primary School Ejemekwuru (formerly St. Marks Anglican School), and Town School Ejemekwuru respectively. There is a secondary school called Ejemekwuru-Akabor Secondary School which was established in 1979. This high school sits at the border with the neighboring town Akabor and was established to serve the needs of Ejemekwuru and Akabor for secondary school education. At the center of the community are situated the Ejemekwuru Post Office ‚Äì a part of the Nigerian Postal Service System, and the Ejemkwuru Primary Health Center ‚Äì a public primary healthcare clinic. In addition, there are a number of private primary healthcare providers, notably the Marycare Healthcare Center Ejemekwuru, built, funded, and operated by the US-based NGO, Marycare Inc.https://www.marycare.org/ https://theleaderassumpta.com/marycare-holds-second-free-medical-outreach-at- ejemekwuru/  Governance Since becoming an autonomous community, Ejemekwuru is governed by two arms of administration ‚Äì the Ezeship Council headed by the traditional ruler (Eze) of the community (who goes by the title EKWURUOMA of EJEMEKWURU), and the Town Union headed by the President of the Town Union. The Eze is the traditional and cultural head of the community. He is also the chief security officer of the community. Between the date of elevation to an autonomous community in 1996 and the date of this publication, the community has produced two traditional rulers (Ezes): The late HRH Eze Kevin Ojure- Amadi, Ekwuruoma I of EJEMEKWURU (2007 ‚Äì 2013) The late HRH Eze Val Ngozi Nwoke, Ekwuruoma II of EJEMEKWURU (2016 ‚Äì 2019)https://guardian.ng/news/okorocha-bans-monarchs-from-speaking-english/ https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/07/okorocha-bars-traditional-rulers-speaking- english-functions// The Town Union (formerly called Ejemekwuru Progressive Union and now Ejemekwuru Town Union) is the political and administrative arm of the community administration. Together with the heads of the groups of villages, they handle political and administrative issues within the community. Ejemekwuru has seen numerous Town Union Presidents since the inception of the formal Town Union in 1945. Those who have served as Town Union Presidents since inception are: - Joseph Osigwe, Mr. John Odunze Duruji, Chief Festus Ijeoma, Gabriel Ogumerem, Nze Innocent Ihemedu, Nze Cornelius Ogugua, Nze na Ozo Eugene Amadi, Nze P.C. Amako, Nze Obinna Hippolyte Duru, Boniface Ikpeama, Linus Ogumerem, Nze Roland Nwosu, and Uche Nwakuna. The current Town Union President is Chief Keryan Igwebuike.  Tourism and sites  Ejemekwuru is 15km from the capital city Owerrihttps://www.britannica.com/place/Owerri and 17km from Kalabari beach on the shores of the massive Oguta lake. Oguta lake is noted for the presence of the confluence of the blue water from the lake and the muddy water from Orashi Riverhttps://www.pulse.ng/lifestyle/food-travel/oguta-lake-in-a-corner-of-imo- two-angry-rivers-flow-without-ever-coming-together/wpxvxbp. Also within Ejemekwuru are the tropical dense forest containing the sacred shrines popularly called Oke Ohia Ezeala. Within this forest are sacred Monkeys which in years back were dedicated to the Ezeala deity (so they can not be hunted or eaten), and by such dedication are naturally preserved and protected (similar to animals in a game reserve). This preserved tropical forest is also home to rich fauna and flora, and a natural haven for biodiversity . Ejemekwuru is also one of the early oil exploration hubs for the Shell Oil company. A legacy Shell well (never produced) is still present in modern-day Ejemekwuru..  Ejemekwuru in modern times and notable natives  The Ejemekwuru community has remained relatively peaceful. It is a Christian community that is predominantly Roman Catholics and Anglicans. There are a good number of Pentecostal Christians and an insignificant number of people who still practice the African traditional religion. During the British colonial era, the first warrant chief appointed for Ejemekwuru was Eze Okwara Uzegbu, a man noted as one with outstanding personality and prominence. He was both a warrant chief and a native court judge. Subsequently, native court judges and local chiefs were appointed at the village level and these included Chief Okwaraozuoha Ubadimma, Chief Onyejigbu Chima, Chief William Amadi, Chief Matthias Nwosu, Chief Olumba Okororie and Chief Peter Amako (who was also a prominent philanthropist). The last colonial-era warrant chief and native court judge appointed for Ejemekwuru was Chief Festus Ijeoma who was widely viewed as a bold, courageous and fearless judge, and under whose leadership critical infrastructure such as the postal office and health care dispensary were built.

Yuba is a part of Grand Traverse County, and is located in Acme Township along U.S. Highway 31\\\\. Yuba rests on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan's Grand Traverse Bay. North of Yuba is the village of Elk Rapids. East of Yuba is the village of Williamsburg. South of Yuba is the village of Acme.  Size  The old Yuba schoolhouse in 2007 Yuba has a small population and almost no businesses. There is no post office, school or grocery store. An old schoolhouse, built in 1860, still stands in Yuba, but is no longer in use. Because of these factors, Yuba is often considered to be a ghost town, but this is not technically accurate as Yuba has never been abandoned by its populace, having only declined in economic and civic activities. On Walkscore.com, Yuba receives a 6 out of 100, meaning it is not a good place to live without a car, truck, bus or motorized vehicle of some sort.  Recreational Areas  The town of Yuba has two notable recreational areas: The Yuba Creek Natural Area is a large section of preserved wetlands surrounding Yuba Creek. There are two roadside access points to the area, leading to extensive walking trails. The Yuba Creek Natural Area is known for its diversity of birds and wildflowers. Some local legends also claim that the grounds of the Natural Area are haunted. Sayler Park is a public park located on the western edge of Yuba, along Grand Traverse Bay. The park has a small swimming area, a few playground items, and numerous picnic tables and grills. There are also three large, covered picnic shelters that may be reserved. Horses are not allowed in the park, and dogs are not permitted on the beach.  Landmarks  The oldest known Caucasian grave in the northwestern region of Michigan's Lower Peninsula is located in Yuba. It is not inside the Yuba Cemetery, but can be found across the highway along a turnoff just south of Yuba Park Road.

The more return sought, the more risk that must be undertaken. The progression There are various classes of possible investments, each with their own positions on the overall risk-return spectrum. The general progression is: short-term debt; long-term debt; property; high-yield debt; equity. There is considerable overlap of the ranges for each investment class. Sharpe Ratio All this can be visualised by plotting expected return on the vertical axis against risk (represented by standard deviation upon that expected return) on the horizontal axis. This line starts at the risk-free rate and rises as risk rises. The line will tend to be straight, and will be straight at equilibrium - see discussion below on domination. For any particular investment type, the line drawn from the risk- free rate on the vertical axis to the risk-return point for that investment has a slope called the Sharpe ratio. =Short-term loans to good government bodies= On the lowest end is short-dated loans to government and government- guaranteed entities (usually semi-independent government departments). The lowest of all is the risk-free rate of return. The risk-free rate has zero risk (most modern major governments will inflate and monetise their debts rather than default upon them), but the return is positive because there is still both the time-preference and inflation premium components of minimum expected rates of return that must be met or exceeded if the funding is to be forthcoming from providers. The risk-free rate is commonly approximated by the return paid upon 30-day or their equivalent, but in reality that rate has more to do with the monetary policy of that country's central bank than the market supply conditions for credit. =Mid- and long-term loans to good government bodies= The next types of investment is longer-term loans to government, such as 3-year bonds. The range width is larger, and follows the influence of increasing risk premium required as the maturity of that debt grows longer. Nevertheless, because it is debt of good government the highest end of the range is still comparatively low compared to the ranges of other investment types discussed below. Also, if the government in question is not at the highest jurisdiction (i.e., is a state or municipal government), or the smaller that government is, the more along the risk-return spectrum that government's securities will be. =Short-term loans to blue-chip corporations= Following the lowest-risk investments are short-dated bills of exchange from major blue-chip corporations with the highest credit ratings. The further away from perfect the credit rating, the higher up the risk-return spectrum that particular investment will be. =Mid- and long-term loans to blue-chip corporations= Overlapping the range for short-term debt is the longer term debt from those same well-rated corporations. These are higher up the range because the maturity has increased. The overlap occurs of the mid- term debt of the best rated corporations with the short-term debt of the nearly perfectly, but not perfectly rated corporations. In this arena, the debts are called investment grade by the rating agencies. The lower the credit rating, the higher the yield and thus the expected return. =Rental property= A commercial property that the investor rents out is comparable in risk or return to a low-investment grade. Industrial property has higher risk and returns, followed by residential (with the possible exception of the investor's own home). =High-yield debt= After the returns upon all classes of investment-grade debt come the returns on speculative-grade high-yield debt (also known derisively as junk bonds). These may come from mid and low rated corporations, and less politically stable governments. =Equity= Equity returns are the profits earned by businesses after interest and tax. Even the equity returns on the highest rated corporations are notably risky. Small-cap stocks are generally riskier than large-cap; companies that primarily service governments, or provide basic consumer goods such as food or utilities, tend to be less volatile than those in other industries. Note that since stocks tend to rise when corporate bonds fall and vice versa, a portfolio containing a small percentage of stocks can be less risky than one containing only debts. =Options and futures= Option and futures contracts often provide leverage on underlying stocks, bonds or commodities; this increases the returns but also the risks. Note that in some cases, derivatives can be used to hedge, decreasing the overall risk of the portfolio due to negative correlation with other investments. Why the progression? The existence of risk causes the need to incur a number of expenses. For example, the more risky the investment the more time and effort is usually required to obtain information about it and monitor its progress. For another, the importance of a loss of X amount of value is greater than the importance of a gain of X amount of value, so a riskier investment will attract a higher risk premium even if the forecast return is the same as upon a less risky investment. Risk is therefore something that must be compensated for, and the more risk the more compensation required. If an investment had a high return with low risk, eventually everyone would want to invest there. That action would drive down the actual rate of return achieved, until it reached the rate of return the market deems commensurate with the level of risk. Similarly, if an investment had a low return with high risk, all the present investors would want to leave that investment, which would then increase the actual return until again it reached the rate of return the market deems commensurate with the level of risk. That part of total returns which sets this appropriate level is called the risk premium. Leverage extends the spectrum The use of leverage can extend the progression out even further. Examples of this include borrowing funds to invest in equities, or use of derivatives. If leverage is used then there are two lines instead of one. This is because although one can invest at the risk-free rate, one can only borrow at an interest rate according to one's own credit-rating. This is visualised by the new line starting at the point of the riskiest unleveraged investment (equities) and rising at a lower slope than the original line. If this new line were traced back to the vertical axis of zero risk, it will cross it at the borrowing rate. Domination All investment types compete against each other, even though they are on different positions on the risk-return spectrum. Any of the mid-range investments can have their performances simulated by a portfolio consisting of a risk-free component and the highest-risk component. This principle, called the separation property, is a crucial feature of modern portfolio theory. The line is then called the capital market line. If at any time there is an investment that has a higher Sharpe ratio than another then that return is said to dominate. When there are two or more investments above the spectrum line, then the one with the highest Sharpe ratio is the most dominant one, even if the risk and return on that particular investment is lower than another. If every mid-range return falls below the spectrum line, this means that the highest- risk investment has the highest Sharpe Ratio and so dominates over all others. If at any time there is an investment that dominates then funds will tend to be withdrawn from all others and be redirected to that dominating investment. This action will lower the return on that investment and raise it on others. The withdrawal and redirection of capital ceases when all returns are at the levels appropriate for the degrees of risk and commensurate with the opportunity cost arising from competition with the other investment types on the spectrum, which means they all tend to end up having the same Sharpe Ratio.

The latest version of Mixed In Key analyzes MP3 and WAV files and determines the musical key of every file. Knowing the key, DJs can use music theory (such as the Circle of Fifths) to play songs in a harmonically-pleasing order. The software helps to eliminate dissonant tones while mixing songs together using a technique such as beatmatching. History Mixed In Key software was developed to provide a Windows interface for the tONaRT key detection algorithm created by zplane.development. The original tONaRT algorithm created by zplane.development had a simple Windows-based demo which could not process multiple audio files at once. Yakov Vorobyev created a simple C# .NET Windows application that could batch-process multiple files. The first version was released on March 25, 2006. Mac OS X development started shortly thereafter, and the first Mac OS X version was released on June 4, 2006. Since May 2007, Mixed In Key LLC has improved the key detection algorithm by combining tONaRT with a custom in-house algorithm. Mixed In Key was granted a patent on this algorithm. The new algorithm was released in Version 3.0. The latest version (in December 2017) is 8.1. Ali 'Dubfire' Shirazinia from Deep Dish was a big influence on the development of the Mac OS X version by providing feedback to the development team. After the Mac OS X version was released, Ali used Mixed In Key to help sequence songs for his Global Underground 31 Taipei album. Products All three suites of Mixed In Key's software, Mixed In Key, Platinum Notes, and Mashup, are used by world-renowned artists. All three software suites are available for both PCs and Macs. Mixed In Key is the original software from Mixed In Key LLC, the software analyzes the harmonies and melodies of the selected music. For every track it shows the musical key and helps choose tracks that are harmonically compatible with each other. Mixed In Key works with Traktor, Serato, Pioneer CDJs, Ableton Live and all other DJ apps. The software is used by the likes of David Guetta and Kaskade. Other artists include Paul van Dyk, Armin van Buuren, Sebastian Ingrosso, Sasha, Grammy-winning producer Ali 'Dubfire' from Deep Dish, Pete Tong from BBC Radio 1, trance producers Blank & Jones, Above & Beyond, High Contrast, Nick Warren, BT. Platinum Notes was the second software suite release, it allows the user to drop in music files. Platinum Notes then makes the tracks acoustically perfect, by using studio filters to process the files. The software corrects for pitch, improves volume and makes the file ready to play anywhere. Mashup is Mixed In Key's most recent addition to its offerings. The software helps beatmatch tracks and saves results to new MP3 files, files then can be made into a podcast. Controversy Mixed In Key has faced criticism over its decision to require an internet connection in versions following Version 2.5. While numerous users have identified this as a deterring and unfair form of copy-protection, Mixed In Key employees have responded claiming that the new requirement has nothing to do with piracy, stating, \\"an internet connection is needed to analyze new files because Mixed In Key uses very expensive technology that is not available in 'offline' mode.\\" Allen & Heath Partnership On December 22, 2006, Mixed In Key LLC announced a partnership with Allen & Heath to provide co-branded versions of Mixed In Key known as XONE Mixed In Key. Mixed In Key continued to sell \\"Original\\" versions of the software. Color scheme is the only difference between the two versions.

Its presidential candidate was Rigoberta Mench√∫, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning indigenous activist, running on a ticket with businessman Luis Fernando Montenegro as her vice-presidential hopeful. They secured 3.09% of the popular vote. In the Congressional election held on the same day, the party fared somewhat better, receiving 6.17% of the popular vote, which was enough to secure them four national-list deputies in Congress for the 2008-12 legislative period: Armando S√°nchez G√≥mez, Rodolfo An√≠bal Garc√≠a, Nineth Montenegro and Otilia Lux. Subsequently, only Nineth Montenegro has remained with the party; the other three deputies have left Encounter for Guatemala to operate as independents. Rodolfo An√≠bal Garc√≠a has since formed a new political party, the New Republic Movement (Movimiento Nueva Rep√∫blica (MNR)). Rigoberta Mench√∫ has gone on to form the Winaq political party. Both MNR and WInaq participated in the 2011 elections as part of the Broad Leftist Front (Frente Amplio de Izquierda). 2011 election For the 2011 elections, Encuentro formed a political alliance with center-right VIVA, another political party; its presidential and vice-presidential candidates were Harold Caballeros and Efra√≠n Medina, with party leader Nineth Montenegro leading the list of legislative candidates. 2019 election In the 2019 Election, the party chose Manfredo Marroqu√≠n as its presidential candidate.

He is currently a free agent. Career H√©verton's career started in 1999 with Guarani, he stayed with the club until 2004 when he left to join Turkish club Ankarag√ºc√º. He made 7 league appearances for Ankarag√ºc√º and scored one goal before returning to Brazil to sign for Uni√£o Barbarense. Next came a move to Ponte Preta, before H√©verton joined Corinthians in 2007 where he played nine times. In 2008, he signed for Vit√≥ria but made just two appearances before leaving. Following his departure from Vit√≥ria, he completed a transfer to Portuguesa. H√©verton's seventh club was his most successful move to date as he made 68 appearances and scored 24 goals in the space of five years. His best season for Portuguesa came in 2010, he began it by scoring 11 times in the club's 2010 Campeonato Paulista campaign and continued his fine form into the following S√©rie B season where he scored 12 goals in 32 matches. 2011 also started well for H√©verton as he scored three goals in six Campeonato Paulista games, this preceded a loan move to Atl√©tico Paranaense. He scored once in five Paulista matches for Atl√©tico Paranaense before returning to Portuguesa. Shortly after returning to Portuguesa, H√©verton was again on his way out on loan as he agreed to join Korean club Seongnam on loan until June 2012. He made his K League Classic debut on 16 July 2011 in a match against Jeju United where he also opened the scoring in the 19th minute, the match ended 2‚Äì2. He went on to make 12 appearances in total for Seongnam whilst scoring an impressive six goals from midfield. Seongnam finished the season in 10th but qualified for the 2012 AFC Champions League as winners of the 2011 Korean FA Cup. In the club's 2012 Champions League run, H√©verton scored twice (both against Nagoya Grampus) in five appearances as Seongnam qualified for the Round of 16 before getting eliminated by Bunyodkor. He made seven further appearances in all competitions for Seongnam before going back to his parent club Portuguesa. Back with Portuguesa, he made 15 appearances and scored once to end the year with Portuguesa. 29 appearances (including one in the 2013 Copa Sudamericana) and 2 goals followed for the club in the 2013 season as the club won the 2013 Campeonato Paulista S√©rie A2 before H√©verton left to join Paysandu where he made 18 appearances and scored 4 goals during 2014. In 2015, H√©verton joined Bras√≠lia. He played three matches in the 2015 Copa Verde and two in the 2015 Copa do Brasil before departing and subsequently joining Piracicaba in 2016.

The method is applicable for any GNSS/INS system.  Overview  = GPS/INS method = The GPS gives an absolute drift-free position value that can be used to reset the INS solution or can be blended with it by use of a mathematical algorithm, such as a Kalman filter. The angular orientation of the unit can be inferred from the series of position updates from the GPS. The change in the error in position relative to the GPS can be used to estimate the unknown angle error. The benefits of using GPS with an INS are that the INS may be calibrated by the GPS signals and that the INS can provide position and angle updates at a quicker rate than GPS. For high dynamic vehicles, such as missiles and aircraft, INS fills in the gaps between GPS positions. Additionally, GPS may lose its signal and the INS can continue to compute the position and angle during the period of lost GPS signal. The two systems are complementary and are often employed together.  Applications  GPS/INS is commonly used on aircraft for navigation purposes. Using GPS/INS allows for smoother position and velocity estimates that can be provided at a sampling rate faster than the GPS receiver. This also allows for accurate estimation of the aircraft attitude (roll, pitch, and yaw) angles. In general, GPS/INS sensor fusion is a nonlinear filtering problem, which is commonly approached using the extended Kalman filter (EKF) or the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The use of these two filters for GPS/INS has been compared in various sources, including a detailed sensitivity analysis. The EKF uses an analytical linearization approach using Jacobian matrices to linearize the system, while the UKF uses a statistical linearization approach called the unscented transform which uses a set of deterministically selected points to handle the nonlinearity. The UKF requires the calculation of a matrix square root of the state error covariance matrix, which is used to determine the spread of the sigma points for the unscented transform. There are various ways to calculate the matrix square root, which have been presented and compared within GPS/INS application. From this work it is recommended to use the Cholesky decomposition method. In addition to aircraft applications, GPS/INS has also been studied for automobile applications such as autonomous navigation, vehicle dynamics control, or sideslip, roll, and tire cornering stiffness estimation.

Education Aurel Aldea was born in Slatina, Olt County on 28 March 1887. He graduated from the Artillery and Engineering Military School of Ia»ôi, after which he was sent to Germany to the Preparatory School of Military Officers of Hanover (1907‚Äì1912) and to the Military Technical Academy of Charlottenburg, where he had his internship at the 23rd Artillery Regiment in Koblenz.Du»õu Alesandru and Dobre Florica: Drama generalilor rom√¢ni, p. 22 Army career In 1912 Aldea was recalled to Romania to participate in the Second Balkan War, and in 1913 he graduated from the Higher War School. He served in World War I as a battery commander, and participated in the battles from Dobrogea and Bucharest. In the interwar period Aldea worked within the General Staff of the Romanian Armed Forces in the Transport Division and Historic Service, Head of Staff of the 11th Infantry Division and 1st Army Corps, then commander of the 23rd Artillery Regiment. Between 1935 and 1938 he was the commander of the Artillery Brigade, after which he was appointed Secretary General of the Ministry of Army Endowment and Commander of the 11th Infantry Division (autumn 1938) and 4th Infantry Division (April 1939). World War II In June 1940, during the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, Aldea led the Romanian delegation that discussed with Red Army commanders the evacuation plans from those territories. The next year, he entered into conflict with Marshal Ion Antonescu, and was forced into retirement on July 21, 1941. In August 1944, the Soviet Army launched the Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive and entered Romania. Aldea was instrumental in the King Michael's Coup, which resulted in the arrest of Antonescu and Romania switching allegiance from the Axis powers to the Allies. He then served as Interior Minister in the first SƒÉnƒÉtescu cabinet from August 23 to November 3, 1944. Final years Under the command of Aldea, elements of the Romanian army officer corps sought to form in 1945‚Äì46 a National Resistance Movement, in order to oversee the disparate anti-communist resistance groups and to organize an armed insurrection. He was arrested on May 27, 1946 and tried by the High Court of Cassation and Justice November 11‚Äì18, 1946 for his resistance efforts. He was found guilty of plotting against the State, and was condemned to life in prison. He died in Aiud Prison on October 17, 1949.

Beginning in the 1920s, the bands typically had 8 to 12 musicians. These bands typically played one- nighters, 6 or 7 nights a week at venues like VFW halls, Elks Lodges, Lions Clubs, hotel ballrooms, and the like. Francis Davis, jazz critic for The Village Voice, likened territory bands to \\"the Top 40 cover bands (of the 1970s and 1980s) of their day, typically relying on stock arrangements of other ensembles' hits.\\" He said, \\"many historians give much credit to territory bands for popularizing modern ballroom dancing that began during the World War I era with the influence of Vernon and Irene Castle.\\" Territory bands helped disseminate popular music -- which included swing, jazz, sweet dance music, or any combination thereof -- bringing it to remote gin mills and dance halls that were otherwise ignored by national booking agents representing genuine recording stars like Ellington and Armstrong. Many developed original repertoires and signature sounds, none more storied than Walter Page's Blue Devils, the Oklahoma City-based outfit that Count Basie joined in 1926. History Territory bands rarely recorded and were often considered secondary in ability. They played in particular states or regions of the country. Ambitious and hopeful young musicians saw territory bands as a stepping stone to big bands. Audiences that wanted to dance kept the bands employed. In the 1920s, territory bands commonly traveled by car (station wagon), followed by an equipment truck for the PA system, guitar amplifiers and drum kit. Beginning in the mid-1930s, territory bands commonly traveled in sleeper trailers. =Territories= Home territories were loosely defined, but some classifications emerged. Generally, the areas were defined as Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, West Coast, Southwest, and Northwest. In addition, some state-groupings became common. MINK comprised Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas. VSA comprised Virginia, South Carolina and Alabama. The Southwest proved especially fertile for territory bands. Texas, with its open geography and relatively large population, offered the greatest opportunity with developed markets for dance music in Austin, Amarillo, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonio. The homegrown audiences of Texas bands were so plentiful that the bands developed to a high degree in relative isolation from outside influences. One such band was that of Alphonso Trent. Two other important groups out of the Southwest, Kansas City specifically, were Bennie Moten's band and Jay McShann's band. Musicians from the Moten band along with musicians from the Oklahoma City Blue Devils became one of the most influential jazz bands of all time under the leadership of Count Basie. McShann's band was on par with these groups and was where Charlie Parker began to show signs of true innovation. Bands from Los Angeles and Seattle performed not only in California, Oregon, and Washington, but also in Arizona, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming. The Glenn Henry Orchestra, which got its first big break playing summers at Yellowstone Park from 1935 to 1940, became a popular West Coast territory band. There were military territories, too, such as Officers' clubs and Non-commissioned Officer clubs. These clubs took bands to Bermuda, Greenland, Nova Scotia, Puerto Rico, as well as the U.S. =Styles= Audiences responded with great enthusiasm to the black bands in the Midwest. The East Coast black bands were popular in the 1920s, but swing came to that region in the form of Louis Armstrong joining the Fletcher Henderson band when he went to New York City Territory bands were not all swing bands. The Midwest settlements of Europeans of various ethnicities brought their community dancing and revelry with them in the form of very popular polka bands (and also old time waltzes, leandlers, and schottisches). They played at all the ballrooms and Elk Clubs and included Babe Wagner Band, Fezz Fritsche & His Goose-town Band, Six Fat Dutchmen, and Whoopie John, a polka band from Minneapolis. =Pre 1920s= There were traveling bands well before the 1920s & 30s. One of many examples were musicians who did their booking from Redfield, South Dakota. Redfield was a railroad hub in the Northern Plains. All their booking was up and down the rail line. =1920s swing and ballroom dancing= In 1924, according to Variety, there were more than 900 dance bands, representing steady work for 7,200 musicians. There were 68 Whiteman orchestras across the country, playing music from the Whiteman library, eleven in New York alone. In the mid-20s, bands typically had ten musicians: two altos, one tenor (who often doubled on other woodwinds and sometimes violin), two trumpets, trombone, banjo or guitar, piano, string bass or brass bass, and drums. Sometimes there were two trombones. If the band had only two saxophones, they would be alto and tenor. =Great Depression= The Great Depression, which hit bottom in 1933, was hard on territory bands. The public strained to afford entertainment. It was not uncommon for bands to be stranded for lack of funds. Many broke up during this period. =1940s Decline = There are many theories on why swing music and territory bands declined. Here are a few: #Unions restricted the fees of booking agents and managers. #Unions required visiting bands to pay local musicians for displaced work (in small towns, unions were nonexistent; but in large cities, unions often looked askance upon territory bands). #Popularity of small combos #Commercial Radio (introduced in 1922), better-quality gramophone discs, and TV (giving greater access to entertainment in the home and access to different types of music). Changing technology (radio, TV, mobility, amplified music) shocked the music industry in a similar way that the internet has shocked the recording industry today. #In the 1950s, most ballrooms in smaller towns of the Midwest closed because people could drive to the city for everything. #Record companies discovered -- during the AFM recording bans of 1942-43 and 1948 ‚Äî that they could profit from record sales, churning out Hit Parade music with just singers, who were exempt from the recording bans. This marked a period when singers became more popular than bandleaders. The introduction and technological advancement of amplification and gramophone recording led to the development of crooning, an intimate vocal style perfected by singers such as Bing Crosby and, later, Frank Sinatra. The record companies gained control over what got recorded; therefore music that was slated for a new market of teenagers was born. This destroyed several booking agencies. MCA, who broke up as many bands as it booked, moved to Hollywood. Frederic Bros. (Chicago) had a fallout with several of its bands. The Vic Schroeder Agency (Omaha), was one of the more responsible bookers before World War II but, little is known after -- same with the White Agency. #Amplification also led to the introduction of the electric guitar, which enabled a very small band to project adequately in large-room settings. Bear in mind that, in the 1920s, an unamplified orchestra had to be large enough and play loud enough to entertain a dance hall of 3,000. Prior to the recording bans, the industry was bent on capturing the intent of composers as interpreted by musicians. Before the ban, gramophone consumers were primarily interested in authenticity of symphonies and famous orchestras (dance bands). Vocals, with no microphones, were only an incidental part of an arrangement. Vocals -- like Bing Crosby's with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra in the studio ‚Äî could not be replicated live, on stage. Rudy Vall√©e used a cheerleader's megaphone. Amplification and the record industry helped spur technical improvements, at the expense of performing musicians. =Female bands= In the history of traveling dance bands, all female bands are often excluded, or only given minor inclusion. Popular culture seemed to regard the musical performances dance bands provided as an area meant to be dominated by men. In the scenarios where women were allowed to join in, they were often denoted as separate. This is seen in the way many female singers were nicknamed \\"canaries,\\" denoting them not as musicians, but as pretty objects meant to be on display. One example that shows just how foreign women could be considered appears in the name of a band Mary Lou Williams headed that was called \\"Six Men and a Girl.\\" Oftentimes these stereotypes surrounding performing women extended to instrumentalists. All female performers were not a new idea in the dawn of traveling jazz bands though. All women groups performing American genres of music dates back to minstrel groups like Madame Rentz's Female Minstrels. Because women could not easily enter prestigious music bands that were essentially all male, all women groups continuously popped up as groups that allowed skilled female musicians to perform. Sometimes they were put together with help from outside sources. It was not uncommon for a group to be put together by a man or a talent agency, but to consist of all female performers. Sometimes performers received aide from family or friends involved in the business to help get their foot in the door. For instance, Lil Hardin Armstrong had an all woman dance band in the early 1930s. This group went by such names as \\"Lil Armstrong and Her Swing Band.\\" Other bands popular in the 1930s include The Harlem Playgirls, The Dixie Sweethearts, the Darlings of Rhythm, and Gertrude Long and Her Rambling Night Hawks. Even banding together with other women though, public perception would sometimes view all female bands as \\"all-girl gimmicks.\\" Some talented musicians avoided joining all female bands in the fear that their talent would be disregarded in such a context. Yet all female bands were also forced into the feminine appearances they were also demeaned for. In many ways, this made being in a traveling dance band more difficult for women than it had been for men. After a night spent traveling women were expected to be visions of beauty with perfect make up, hair, and personalities. Often the ultra feminine clothes they had to wear, such as strapless dress and high heels, also affected their ability to play and perform. As had been shown in previous attempts women had made to broach men's groups, attempting to break away from this dainty female image could call the sexuality and morality of a performer into question. Yet women's performances were also often debased to their visual looks and sexual attractiveness, even though many reviewers criticized them for these elements. A certain need to prove themselves seemed to exist among many of the female musicians who worked in dance bands. These performers inherited a lot of the stereotypes that surrounded their previous female performer counterparts: chorus line girls and girl singers. The sexual objectification of women that haunted those two careers was also a part of being in an all female band. Furthermore, chorus line girls had an association with loose morals and even prostitution, and loss of face for an instrumentalist could mean the end of a career. These kinds of associations also made many people assume that female instrumentalists were not talented players. Upon interviewing later in life, many women insisted that they were talented musicians who knew how to play. This insistence seems to be in direct reaction to the claims that circulated that female musicians were not meant to play well but simply to look pretty. While it's true that many agencies required photos in their applications to join female bands, the musicians in them still tended to be quite talented. While many people view the end of the Swing era as the opening of World War II, this was not the case for all woman dance bands. Instead, they flourished during the 1940s. Swing music became a form of patriotism to a country at war. The all-girl bands that did the best at this time tended to be groups formed before American involvement in the war. Once it was realized that women could fill a major hole in the entertainment industry and that they could not be drafted, agencies and managers everywhere began trying to put together all female bands. In many ways, these musicians were very prepared to take over for the men because they had more advanced experience in playing instruments, either from hobbies or school bands. They were certainly more prepared for musical performance than many women were prepared for welding and factory work. Some groups connected to academic organizations, such as the International Sweethearts of Rhythm or the Prairie View Co-eds did very well at this time. These groups of industrious young women could come to represent an image of what the United States was at war for. Some of these groups even did USO tours. Soldiers shipped off to foreign lands, under the pressure war and deprived of any female presence were more than welcoming to these all woman groups. The armed audiences were known to have shown extreme appreciation for these female performers V-discs, recorded for broadcast on the Armed Forces Radio Network, often featured all-girl groups. = Ethnicity and race = There were black bands and white bands, and bands of various immigrant ethnicities. There were also all-female bands, such as the International Sweethearts of Rhythm. Musician, composer, and scholar Gunther Schuller asserted in one of his books, The Swing Era: The Development of Jazz, 1930‚Äì1945 (The History of Jazz, Vol. 2) that, \\"territory bands, by definition, were black. There were, of course, many white bands in the 'territories' but they tended to have the more lucrative and permanent jobs and therefore not required to travel as much as the black bands.\\" Another musician (former territory band musician and historian), Jack Behrens, expressed in a book that Schuller's depiction of divergent work conditions was narrow. \\"During my playing days in the 1940s and 50s in several white territory bands, we didn't have \\"lucrative and permanent jobs\\" unless you count day labor in a dairy bar or clerking at a military surplus store. Worse, there were times we didn't get paid at all and we had little recourse given the cost of legal advice.\\" For most territory bands -- whether black, white, integrated, male, female -- the musicians were nearly always paid. Neither the booking agencies nor the musicians got rich, but regular salaries helped maintain pretty decent musicianship. Most musicians witnessed and experienced Jim Crow laws. One common present-day misconception is that Jim Crow practices were more prevalent in the South. The practices were prevalent everywhere, especially in New York City and the Midwest. The bands that were racially integrated commonly experienced problems, mostly from having to dodge different applications and degrees of Jim Crow among cities and regions. Many bands, especially The International Sweethearts of Rhythm, handled some of the absurdities with a degree of inward, sarcastic humor. When musicians grew wary or even felt vulnerable to injustices of Jim Crow, the band bus, for those who had one, served as a safe haven.

Vigor was laid down on 16 June 1952 at Manitowoc, Wisconsin, by the Burger Boat Co.; launched on 23 June 1953, sponsored by Mrs. Charles C. Kerwin; and commissioned at the Boston Naval Shipyard on 8 November 1954, Lt. Walter W. Schwartz in command.  East Coast service  After brief duty at Boston, Massachusetts, the minesweeper moved to Key West, Florida, for shakedown training early in 1955. During the cruise, she was redesignated MSO-473 on 7 February. Minesweeper refresher training at Charleston, South Carolina, followed, and Vigor then began a tour of duty with the Naval Ordnance Laboratory at Port Everglades, Florida. Later that year, Vigor became a training ship, first for the Underwater Object Locator School at Key West and then for the Naval Mine Warfare School at Yorktown, Virginia. Early in 1956, she again headed south to participate in the annual Caribbean exercise, Operation Springboard. During her cruise to the West Indies, Vigor made port calls at San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Fredricksted, St. Croix, in the Virgin Islands.  1956 Med cruise  Following her return to Charleston and operations out of that port, she got underway on 1 May for her first deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. During that cruise, she visited Harwich, England; Ostend, Belgium; and Lisbon, Portugal, as well as touching at the usual U.S. 6th Fleet ports of call along the Mediterranean coast. She concluded that cruise at Charleston on 6 October and resumed operations from that base.  Testing and evaluation  Vigor continued that duty until the latter part of 1957, when she was reassigned to the Naval Mine Defense Laboratory at Panama City, Florida. From that new home port, the minesweeper operated with Mine Division 85 participating in various experimental projects conducted by the laboratory. For the next 14 years, she remained based at Panama City conducting operations for both the Mine Warfare Laboratory and with the Operational Test and Evaluation Force. During her assignment there, she also deployed to the Mediterranean five more times, operating with the 6th Fleet for six months at a time. Each time she returned to Panama City she resumed normal duty which was broken periodically by overhauls at various locations.  Decommissioning  On New Year's Day 1971, the ship's base was changed back to Charleston. She left Panama City on the 18th and arrived in Charleston on the 27th. After 15 months of duty with the Mine Force, Vigor was decommissioned at Charleston on 4 April 1972. Simultaneously, her name was struck from the Navy list, and she was transferred to the government of Spain. As of the beginning of 1980, she remained an active unit of the Spanish Navy, serving under the name Guadiana (M44).

It was based in the historic Struan House, an early 20th-century building which is now the Monash Peninsula Postgraduate Studies Centre.Peninsula Campus The College gained independence and state funding in the early 1970s, and from 1974 was known as the State College at Frankston.http://publications.epress.monash.edu/toc/sl/1/1 During this time, it educated many teachers who went on to become quite well known in children's education, such as author Paul Jennings. In 1982, the College merged with the Caulfield Institute of Technology to form the Chisholm Institute of Technology.http://publications.epress.monash.edu/toc/sl/1/1 By the end of the decade, Federal Government reforms to higher education in Australia made it clear that smaller degree-providing institutions would have to merge with larger ones. As a result, both Caulfield and Peninsula Chisholm campuses merged with Monash University in 1990, as part of the University's massive expansion. During the 1990s, Monash Vice-Chancellor Mal Logan was able to secure tens of millions of dollars worth of government grants to undertake an expansion and redevelopment of the Peninsula Campus.

It was founded by Marie-Paule Gigu√®re in Quebec in 1971 as a prayer group. It was formally approved as a Roman Catholic \\"pious association\\" in 1975, which approval was withdrawn by the archbishop of Quebec after Gigu√®re announced herself the reincarnation of the Blessed Virgin Mary. History Marie-Paule Gigu√®re was born in :fr:Sainte-Germaine-du-Lac-Etchemin, Quebec, Canada on 14 September 1921. In 1944, she married Georges Clich√©; they divorced in 1957. Their five children were placed out-of-home. Marie-Paule claimed to have heard celestial voices since the age of twelve. After visiting a small Marian shrine on the edge of Lake Etchemin in 1971, Marie-Paule is said to have received a revelation directing her to creating an Army of Mary (\\"Arm√©e de Marie\\") as an alternative to the existing Legion of Mary. Founded as a prayer group in 1971, and recognized in 1975 by the Archbishop of Quebec as a pious association four years later, the \\"Army of Mary\\" has been a headache for Canadian Catholic bishops ever since.\\"What is the Army of Mary?\\", Arkansas Catholic, Diocese of Little Rock, October 6, 2007 A Quebec priest, Philippe Roy, joined the movement and became its director, and over the next ten years the association began to expand. In 1971 Gigu√®re learned from French author Raoul Auclair of alleged apparitions in Amsterdam and the purported messages of the Lady of All Nations. Gigu√®re met visionary Ida Peerdeman in Amsterdam in 1973.Margry, Peter Jan. \\"Army of Mary / Community of the Lady of All Peoples\\", World Religions and Spirituality Project, Virginia Commonwealth University, October 28, 2013 In 1977, due to another revelation to Marie-Paule, the \\"Militia of Jesus Christ\\" was introduced in Canada and connected to the Army of Mary. The Militia was a new chivalric order created in France in 1973 for stimulating Marian devotion and doing social work. A number of members of the \\"Army of Mary\\" joined the \\"Militia of Jesus Christ\\". In 1978 Gigu√®re introduced herself as the (mystical) reincarnation of Mary. Gigu√®re published her spiritual writings (\\"Vie d'amour\\") in 1979. In 1981, the \\"Army of Mary\\" movement changed its name to the \\"Family and the Community of the Sons and Daughters of Mary\\", and in 1983 began construction at Lac-Etchemin of a world center for the Army of Mary and the Militia.See for a thorough overview of the movement: Peter Jan Margry, Mary's Reincarnation and the Banality of Salvation: The Millennialist Cultus of the Lady of All Nations/Peoples, in: Numen, International Review for the History of Religions 59 (2012) p. 486-508 At present, the Community of the Lady of All Nations declares itself independent of the Church and non- Catholic. It is an independent Neo-Marian, ecumenical group, open to interreligious dialogue. Its liturgy integrates \\"The Heritage of Humanity\\" (excerpts from books and sacred texts of other religions and thinkers). After a series of newspaper articles regarding the beliefs expressed in her writings, the new archbishop of Quebec, Cardinal Louis-Albert Vachon, withdrew the approval of his predecessor, and on 4 May 1987 declared the movement schismatic and disqualified it as a Catholic association because of its false teachings. He asked the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to review Gigu√®re's writings. Then-Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) concluded that the movement was in \\"major and very severe error.\\" The Army was forbidden to organize any celebration or to propagate their devotion for the Lady of All Peoples. On April 25, 2015, Gigu√®re died in the Residence of the Lady in Lac-Etchemin. Beliefs Members of the group believe that its late founder, Marie Paule Gigu√®re, was the reincarnation of the Virgin Mary, in open contradiction not only with the Catholic belief that reincarnation does not exist, but more specifically that Mary was assumed soul and body into heaven by God, and therefore Mary's soul is not separate from her body, so that if she were to appear, it would have to be as herself, not as a reincarnation. Father Eric Roy, superior general of the Sons of Mary, an affiliate of the \\"Army of Mary\\", said Gigu√®re did not claim to be the reincarnation of the Virgin Mary, and that the Quebec woman \\"received graces\\" from the Virgin Mary and God. \\"The Virgin Mary took possession of her soul. I would rather say it that way,\\" said Roy. Position of the Catholic Church On February 27, 1987 The Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith declared the writings of the movement to be in \\"major and severe error.\\" =Canada= In June 2001, the Catholic Bishops of Canada issued a negative doctrinal judgement stating that the group was not a \\"Catholic association\\". The bishops cited \\"spurious new doctrines that are without foundation in Scripture or Tradition\\". On 26 March 2007 the Archbishop of Quebec, Cardinal Marc Ouellet, declared that \\"The Army of Mary has clearly and publicly become a schismatic community and, as such, a non-Catholic association. Its particular teachings are false and its activities are not able to be frequented nor supported by Catholics\\". On July 11, 2007, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a declaration of excommunication against the group for heretical teachings and beliefs after a six-year investigation. The declaration was announced by the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops on September 12, 2007.Church excommunicates 'Army of Mary' Archbishop of Ottawa, Terrence Prendergast S.J., appointed in 2003 by Pope John Paul II to be a mediator said, \\"It‚Äôs a kind of cult.

William B. Gould (1837 ‚Äì May 25, 1923) was a former slave and veteran of the American Civil War. Early life William B. Gould was born to a slave woman and perhaps an Englishman. He learned to read and write and is known for his detailed entries in a diary about his work as a plasterer. He was enslaved by the Nixon family and worked on the Bellamy House. On September 21, 1862, Gould escaped with seven other slaves by rowing a small boat down the Cape Fear River and out into the Atlantic Ocean where the USS Cambridge of the Union blockade picked them up as contraband. Prior to the escape, Gould had been working as a plasterer at an antebellum mansion (now named the Bellamy Mansion) in Wilmington, North Carolina. At the time of his escape he appears to have been enslaved by Nicholas Nixon, a peanut planter and slave owner in Wilmington. Naval service After his escape, Gould joined the U.S. Navy and believed he was \\"defending the holiest of all causes, Liberty and Union.\\" Gould served on the USS Ohio, where he was rated a \\"boy.\\" While on board of the Ohio, he came down with the measles and have to leave the ship to go to the hospital. Shortly before, he met John Robert Bond, another black sailor serving on the Ohio. The two would reconnect ten years after the war and become good friends. Though black men served alongside white men in the Navy during the Civil War and made up roughly 15% of the Union Navy, Gould experienced racism while serving onboard the USS Cambridge. Black sailors were \\"treated shamefully,\\" Gould said, when they were not allowed to eat out of mess pans and were called disparaging names. =Diary= Beginning with his time on the Cambridge and continuing through his discharge at the end of the war he kept a diary of his day-to-day activities. According to John Hope Franklin, Gould's diary is one of three known diaries in existence written during the Civil War by former slaves. In the diary, Gould chronicles his trips to the northeastern United States, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, and England. The diary is distinguished not only by its details and eloquent tone, but also by its author's reflections on the conduct of the war, his own military engagements, race, race relations in the Navy, and what African Americans might expect after the war and during the Reconstruction Era. Post-war life GAR on Dedham's 250th anniversary. After he was discharged from the Navy at the Charlestown Navy Yard in Massachusetts, he married Cornelia Read in November 1865. Cornelia was a former slave who was then living on Nantucket and they corresponded throughout the war. The Goulds moved to Milton Street in Dedham, Massachusetts, and together they had two daughters and six sons. In Dedham, Gould \\"became a building contractor and community pillar.\\" The Gould home was close to the border with Readville, where former shipmate John Robert Bond settled after the war. Gould would later serve as godfather to Bond's second son. Gould \\"took great pride in his work\\" when he resumed work as a plasterer and helped to build the new St. Mary's Church. One of his employees improperly mixed the plaster and even though it was not visible by looking at it, Gould insisted that it be removed and reapplied correctly. He also worked as a stonemason, construcitng buildings around Dedham. Gould and his family were more likely to experience subtle slights on account of their race as opposed to outright racism while living in Dedham. He joined the Mt. Moriah Masonic Prince Hall Lodge in Cambridge with several other black veterans. Gould helped to build the Episcopal Church of the Good Shepard in Oakdale Square, though as a parishioner and not as a contractor. It may have been the Episcopal church he attended in Wilmington as a slave that taught him to read and write, and thus to be able to keep his diary. Gould's family remained active members of the church and, along with the Bonds and one other family, the Chesnuts, were the only black parishioners. Gould's gravestone at Brookdale Cemetery Gould was extremely active in the Charles W. Carroll Post 144 of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR). He \\"held virtually every position that it was possible to hold in the GAR from the time he joined [in 1882] until his death in 1923, including the highest post, commander, in 1900 and 1901.\\" He attended the statewide encampments of the GAR in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with Bond and other black veterans from the area. Five of his sons would fight in the World War I and one in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. A photo of the six sons and their father, all in military uniform, would appear in the NAACP's magazine, The Crisis, in December 1917 while the three youngest sons, all officers, were training to go and fight in World War I in France. Gould's great-grandson would describe them as \\"a family of fighters.\\" , Gould gave a speech at Dedham's 1918 Decoration Day celebrations at which he received \\"an ovation welcome.\\" Gould was regularly driven through town on parade days into the 1920s in cars adorned with red, white, and blue decorations. Legacy Gould and his six sons in military uniforms He died on or about May 25, 1923, at the age of 85 and was interred at Brookdale Cemetery in Dedham. The Dedham Transcript reported his death under the headline \\"East Dedham Mourns Faithful Soldier and Always Loyal Citizen: Death Came Very Suddenly to William B.

A purchase of particular options is known as a long strangle, while a sale of the same options is known as a short strangle. As an options position strangle is a variation of a more generic straddle position. Strangle's key difference from a straddle is in giving investor choice of balancing cost of opening a strangle versus a probability of profit. For example, given the same underlying security, strangle positions can be constructed with low cost and low probability of profit. Low cost is relative and comparable to a cost of straddle on the same underlying. Strangles can be used with equity options, index options or options on futures. Long strangle Payoffs of buying a strangle spread. The long strangle involves going long (buying) both a call option and a put option of the same underlying security. Like a straddle, the options expire at the same time, but unlike a straddle, the options have different strike prices. A strangle can be less expensive than a straddle if the strike prices are out- of-the-money. If the strike prices are in-the-money, the spread is called a gut spread. The owner of a long strangle makes a profit if the underlying price moves far enough away from the current price, either above or below. Thus, an investor may take a long strangle position if he thinks the underlying security is highly volatile, but does not know which direction it is going to move. This position is a limited risk, since the most a purchaser may lose is the cost of both options. At the same time, there is unlimited profit potential. =Example: Long Strangle P/L graph= Let's look at an example of a 1-year Long Strangle options strategy: Long Strangle Option Strategy Example (at-the-money, 1 year to expiry) 100 days after we purchase this Long Strangle, its P/L graph (blue line) would look as follows: Long Strangle Option Strategy Profit-Loss Chart (at 100 days and at expiry) We can see that after 100 days, the strategy will be profitable only if the stock price is lower than approximately 80 dollars or higher than 110 dollars. These are the break-even points of the strategy. As time goes by, the blue P/L graph will go down, closer and closer to the orange line, which is the P/L of this strategy at expiry. This is because options are losing value with time; this is known as time decay.  Short strangle  payoff of short strangle The short strangle strategy requires the investor to simultaneously sell both a [call] and a [put] option on the same underlying security. The strike price for the call and put contracts must be, respectively, above and below the current price of the underlying. The assumption of the investor (the person selling the option) is that, for the duration of the contract, the price of the underlying will remain below the call and above the put strike price. If the investor's assumption is correct the party purchasing the option has no advantage in exercising the contracts so they expire worthless. This expiration condition frees the investor from any contractual obligations and the money (the premium) he or she received at the time of the sale becomes profit. Importantly, if the investor's assumptions against volatility are incorrect the strangle strategy leads to modest or unlimited loss.

Life John Richards was born in England, and traveled with his parents in 1630 to North America as part of the first major wave of migration to the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In 1644 Ricards was enrolled in the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company, which he would remain involved with for the rest of his life. A resident of Dorchester for most of his life, he operated a mill, and frequently served as on the colony's general court (as its assembly was known). The colony did not have a residency requirement, and he usually represented communities (such as Hadley that were distant from Boston, where the assembly met. In 1679 and 1680, however, he was chosen to represent Boston, and was elected speaker in 1680. From 1680-84 he served as one of the colony's assistants, whose council served as the upper body of the assembly and as the colony's highest court. In 1681 Richards was appointed along with Joseph Dudley to represent the colony in London in an attempt to address royal concerns over the colony's administration. King Charles II had, upon his restoration, insisted that the colony exhibit more religious tolerance and adhere more closely to the Navigation Acts, both of which the colony's hardline administration had resisted doing. Richards and Dudley were unsuccessful in their negotiations with the Lords of Trade, because the colonial government had specifically denied them authority to agree to changes in the colonial charter. Richards was of the opinion that the colonial government should acquiesce to the crown demands, and was consequently voted from office in 1684. That year, the colonial charter was revoked. In 1686 the Dominion of New England was established, with Joseph Dudley as its first governor, and Sir Edmund Andros as its second. He served as a judge under Dudley's brief administration, but was apparently opposed to Andros' unpopular rule, in which he played no part. The dominion was overturned in 1689 when Andros and Dudley were arrested in the wake of the Glorious Revolution. The old colonial administration was restored, and Richards was once again made an assistant. Witch trials In 1692 Sir William Phips arrived in the colony bearing the new charter for the Province of Massachusetts Bay, and a commission as governor. Phips' arrival occurred during the height of a witchcraft scare in the Salem area of Essex County. Phips created a Special Court of Oyer and Terminer, to which Richards was appointed.Massachusetts Archives Collections, Governor's Council Executive Records, Vol. 2, 1692, pages 176‚Äì177. Certified copy from the original records at Her Majestie's State Paper Office, London, September 16, 1846. This court oversaw the conviction and execution of nineteen individuals in the infamous Salem witch trials. When the Superior Court of Judicature was formed as the province's high court, Richards was also appointed to it.Records of the Massachusetts Supreme Court of Judicature, 1692/3, Page 1.

It is known in English-language territories either as Joe: The Busy Body or The Gazebo. It was directed by Jean Girault and stars Louis de Fun√®s as playwright Antoine Brisebard, Claude Gensac as an actress and his wife Sylvie Brisebard as well Bernard Blier as inspector Ducros. The script is based on a play by Alec Coppel, published in 1958, The Gazebo. Jo is its second adaptation, the first one being the 1959 film The Gazebo, starring Glenn Ford and Debbie Reynolds. Synopsis Antoine Brisebard, a famous comedy playwright, is struggling with financial difficulties and is preparing to sell his country villa to an English couple. What no one knows, however, is that Brisebard is actually a victim of blackmail since his wife Sylvie, a famous actress, is the daughter of a notorious robber-murderer. His extortionist is a malevolent criminal only known as Jo, who visits him often to pick up his hush money. But faced with certain ruin, Brisebard is preparing to do away with Jo once and for all, planning his deed under the guise of him trying to write the script for a crime play and consulting his friend, attorney Colas, for ideas of how to efficiently get rid of the body. He finally takes up the offer of garden landscaper Tonelotti to erect a pavilion, whose foundation would provide the ideal hiding place for the corpse. On the night Jo is scheduled to arrive for his next payment, Brisebard awaits the arrival with a gun, but is not able to pull the trigger and drops the gun to the floor, which results in a shot going off and accidentally killing Jo. But it is only then that things turn really difficult: Police inspector Ducros, who has found out about Jo's operation and Brisebard's involvement in it, starts nosing around, telling Brisebard that Jo had already been murdered at the time he was supposed to come to the villa - the man Brisebard shot is eventually revealed as Riri, Joe's criminal associate and murderer. The pavillon foundation proves to be too shoddy, forcing Brisebard to hide the body elsewhere; a lot of unwanted houseguests keep coming and going; and finally, Riri's body stubbornly refuses to remain hidden. Even with the help of his wife, to whom he finally tells everything, the task of getting rid of the body becomes an outright daunting ‚Äì and nerve- wracking ‚Äì one.

It is midway between the village of Goshen and Florida, at the junction of Quarry Road (Orange County Route 68), built into the side of a 580-foot (177 m) hill known as Mount Lookout. In the 1960s, archaeologists digging at the site found caves with artifacts left by hunter- gatherers 12,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age. A Paleo-Indian fluted point, a very rare stone tool, was among them. At the time of its discovery it was the oldest such site east of the Mississippi. The site has been at the center of a battle between local archaeologists and the Pleasant Valley-based Dutchess Quarry and Supply Company, which actively produces dolomite gravel on the site. The company's operations have expanded in recent years to meet growing demand in the region, moving its activities closer to the cave site than they were when first discovered. It monitors the caves closely when it needs to do blasting, and the county has established a preserve on the most important 20 acres (4 ha) of the 177-acre (71 ha) site. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, with the site's boundaries expanded in 1997. But the researchers fear that a hitherto undisturbed area known as the Alpine Meadow, which may contain even more artifacts but also has road-grade dolomite, may be mined. They would like to see the county acquire at least a conservation easement on the cave site, and include it in its Open Space Plan. The company, which has been mining gravel on the property since 1938, says it is open to any solutions that do not adversely impact its extraction operations. The only person authorized to conduct tours of the site left the area in 2004, and it is not otherwise open to the public due to the quarrying operations.

He is renowned for providing the preclinical rationale for the development of anti-TNF therapies for rheumatoid arthritis. His researchMajor Scientific Achievements is highly cited for discovering disease pathways in animal models of chronic inflammation and autoimmunity (e.g. Rheumatoid Arthritis, Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Multiple Sclerosis).Brief CV at Alexander Fleming BSRC He is credited with the development of major national infrastructures of scientific and technological excellence in Greece.  Education and employment  George Kollias graduated from the Biology Department of the University of Athens, Greece and performed doctoral studies in Molecular Biology from 1980 to 1984 at the National Hellenic Research Foundation. He continued with postdoctoral research in the field of gene structure and expression at the Laboratory of Gene Structure and Expression, National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London, UK, and from 1990-2000 he established the Laboratory of Molecular Genetics at the Hellenic Pasteur Institute in Athens, Greece. From 2000-2002, he was appointed Director of the Institute for Immunology at the Biomedical Sciences Research Center \\"Alexander Fleming\\", and has served as the Center's President and Scientific Director (2002-2010 & 2016‚Äìpresent). Since May 2012, he is Professor of Experimental Physiology at the Medical School of the University of Athens.  Research and innovation  In 1991, George Kollias' group was first to provide in vivo, proof of principle studies, on deregulated TNF production being causal to the development of chronic polyarthritis in a transgenic animal model, and for showing originally that anti-huTNF antibody treatment was efficacious in treating the modeled disease (pg. 370). These studies were instrumental in mobilizing the interest of anti- TNF industry and foreshadowed the success of the first clinical trials performed in RA in 1994. Further work in his lab provided insights into the function of TNF in host defense and the structure and function of secondary lymphoid organs, a work that more recently evolved into the establishment of TNFRI and NFkB signals specifically in follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) being of pivotal significance in the regulation of humoral B cell responses and autoimmunity. Moreover, George Kollias' group demonstrated TNF‚Äôs causal effect in the development of combined Crohn's disease and polyarthritis, and the contribution of transmembrane versus soluble TNF in the pathogenic processes. These studies offered a better understanding of the physiological function of TNF in health and disease and rationalized potential complications or optimizations of anti-TNF therapies in other diseases such as in MS. More recently, George Kollias introduced a novel pathogenic principle to explain the cellular basis of TNF function in gut/joint axis diseases, including spondyloarthropathies, by showing that mesenchymal cells, namely synovial fibroblasts and intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts, are common pathogenic targets of TNF sufficient to drive the chronic inflammatory and destructive disease process.George Kollias' PubMed Publications Animal models developed in his lab have been distributed to numerous academic and industrial laboratories around the world (over 200 MTAs in the last ten years).

It is similar in design to a bathrobe but is meant to be worn backwards (i.e., with the opening in the back). The product has been marketed by various brands as the Snuggie, Snuggler, Doojo, Toasty Wrap, and Slanket, with varying sizes, colors and qualities of materials but similar basic design. Popularity A woman wearing a blue Snuggie In late 2008 and early 2009 the Snuggie brand of sleeved blankets became a pop culture phenomenon, sometimes described humorously as a \\"cult\\". The product became famous after a direct response commercial promoting the product was aired. It was featured on television programs like Today where cast and crew donned Snuggie blankets for a segment which was described as looking like a Black Protestant choir. Others have described mass-snuggie wearing as looking like a Harry Potter convention. The Associated Press likened it to a \\"monk's ensemble in fleece\\" and proclaimed it the \\"ultimate kitsch gift\\". The Snuggie initially sold singly for $14.95, and later in sets of two for $19.95. The Slanket was mentioned in an episode of NBC's 30 Rock entitled \\"The Ones\\". The product has also been ridiculed as a \\"backwards robe\\" or simple reinvention of the coat on radio and television talk shows in the United States. Comparisons have also been made with the Thneed, a highly promoted, amorphous garment in the Dr. Seuss story, The Lorax. On January 30, 2009, a group organized a pub crawl wearing Snuggies in Cincinnati, Ohio.Snuggie Pub Crawls. snuggiepubcrawls.com In the following months they went on to complete over 40 more across the nation. Later, a group organized a Snuggie pub crawl in Chicago to raise money for an African orphanage, which led to similar events throughout the United States.

William Ellis Metford (1824-1899) designed the Metford rifling Life He was born on 4 October 1824, the elder son of William Metford, a physician, of Flook House, Taunton, by his wife, Mary Eliza Anderdon. He was educated at Sherborne School between 1838 and 1841, and was apprenticed to W. M. Peniston, resident engineer under Isambard Kingdom Brunel, on the Bristol and Exeter Railway. From 1846 to 1850, he was employed on the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway. After 1850, he worked for Thomas Evans Blackwell, in connection with schemes for developing the traffic of Bristol, and subsequently acted for a short time under Peniston as engineer on the Wycombe railway, residing at Bourne End. During this period, he designed an improved theodolite with a travelling stage and a curved arm upholding the transit axis, and also invented a very good form of level. In March 1856, Metford was elected an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and early in 1857 he obtained an important appointment on the East India Railway under (Sir) Alexander Rendel. He arrived at Monghyr on 18 May to find that the mutiny had just broken out. With the aid of the railway staff, he took a leading part in organising the defence of the town. His ceaseless exertions largely contributed to the safety of the garrison, but they permanently impaired his health, and within a year he found himself obliged to abandon his engagement and return to England. Metford's interest in rifle shooting began in boyhood, his father having established a rifle club with a range in the fields near Flook House, and he gave constant attention to it in the intervals of his engineering studies. Late in 1852 or early in 1853 he suggested a hollow-based bullet for the Enfield rifle, expanding without a plug. It was brought out with the assistance of Robert Taylor Pritchett,Delia Millar, ‚ÄòPritchett, Robert Taylor (1828‚Äì1907)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 who was awarded ¬£1,000, by government for the invention on its adoption by the small-arms committee. In 1854, Metford investigated the disturbance of the barrel by the shock of the explosion, which affects the line of flight of the bullet, a difficulty which had led to much misunderstanding. In 1857, the select committee found his form of explosive rifle bullet the best of those submitted to them, and in 1863 it was adopted by government. In March 1869, however, it was declared obsolete in accordance with the resolution of the St. Petersburg convention against the employment of such missiles in warfare. Metford's chief distinction in rifle progress, however, is that he was the pioneer of the substitution of very shallow grooving and a hardened cylindrical bullet expanding into it, for deep grooving and bullets of soft lead. In 1865, his first match rifle appeared, having five shallow grooves and shooting a hardened bullet of special design (Patent No. 2488). In 1870, he embarked seriously on the production of a breechloading rifle, paying the closest attention to every detail of the barrel and cartridge. Before long his first experimental breechloading rifles appeared, and at Wimbledon in 1871 two of them were used, with one of which the principal prize for military breechloading rifles was won by Sir Henry St. John Halford, 3rd Baronet, whose acquaintance he had made in 1862 at the Wimbledon meeting, and who henceforth was his friend and assistant in his experiments. From 1877, the record of the Metford rifle was an unbroken succession of triumphs. Between that date and 1894, it failed only four times to win the Duke of Cambridge's prize, while it took a preponderating share of other prizes. The advance in military small arms abroad, and especially the increased rapidity of loading, caused the appointment of a committee in February 1883 to deal with the question. Metford designed for them the detail of the .42 bore for the rifle provisionally issued for trial early in 1887, and on the adoption of the .303 magazine rifle he gave much assistance in designing the barrel, chamber, and cartridge. In 1888, the war-office committee on small arms selected as the pattern for British use a rifle which combined the Metford bore with the bolt-action and detachable magazine invented by the British inventor, James Paris Lee. In 1892, Metford's health finally broke down, and henceforth he was precluded from active work. He died at his house at Redland, Bristol, on 14 October 1899. Family About 1856, he married Caroline Eliza Wallis, a daughter of Dr. George Wallis of Bristol. References ;Attribution Sources *Skennerton, Ian: The Lee-Enfield Story.

Niche blogs (also commonly referred to as \\"niche websites\\") may appeal to \\"geographic areas, a specialty industry, ethnic or age groups, or any other particular group of people.\\" While it could be argued that every blog is, in some form, a niche blog, the term as it applies to marketing refers to a particular kind of blog. Neither blogging nor niche marketing is a new concept. However, only in recent years has the concept of a niche blog come into being. Usually, niche blogs will contain affiliate links or advertisements of some sort (pay-per-click or products or both). In some cases, the purpose of the niche blog is to incite the reader into visiting another website which may then attempt to sell the reader a product or service. Niche blogging and splogging are often hard to distinguish. However, niche blogging's reliance on pay-per-click advertising and other revenue streams usually requires such blogs to have valuable content related to their chosen niche, unlike a splog. Popularity The popularity of niche blogging among new marketers can be attributed to several factors, including cost, adaptability and generating traffic. =Cost= Blogging can be a low-cost operation using free hosting platforms, including WordPress, Blogger and Tumblr. Bloggers who choose to invest may purchase domain names or self-host their blogs for a cost. Self-hosted blogs are popular, as Google also takes a website's speed as a ranking factor therefore SEOs recommend webmasters to host their blogs on high quality servers. = Effectiveness = As far as company-run websites go, niche blogs are an effective marketing tool due to their less sale-oriented nature. By providing useful content for users, rather than just pitching sales, niche blogs encourage product and brand awareness, and are therefore popular in a range of industries as an addition to company websites. = Audience targeting = Niche bloggers generate revenue by targeting readers in their niche, whether that be a group of fellow professionals in a business, or potential clients. The choice of target audience influences which topics bloggers choose to cover, as well as how they present and promote their writings. = Profitability = If built correctly, niche blogs can provide their bloggers with a pleasant revenue. From just some extra income to help pay monthly bills to generous amounts that can replace their full-time job salary or overtake it entirely. The reason is that this kind of blogs target a specific type of audience that is closer to the final stage of the purchase funnel.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 13, 1974. History The Greek Revival-style mansion was constructed for George Washington Foster, a prominent local with plantations in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi. Located at the summit of Court Street and the highest point in Florence, Foster named his residence Courtview. Because construction would result in the permanent obstruction of a major thoroughfare, Foster had to secure the approval of the Alabama Legislature before work could begin. Permission was granted with the stipulation that \\"the beauty of the home justify the inconvenience caused the people of the city.\\"Lyles, Carol, \\"Rogers Hall is Your Alumni House,\\" UNA Magazine, Summer, 2006 He had the grounds professionally landscaped by the Hastings firm out of Atlanta. Foster died in 1878, with the property going to his daughter, Sarah Independence Foster, and her husband, Stirling Payne MacDonald. MacDonald was a former captain in the Confederate Army. According to the diary of Sarah Foster MacDonald, the grounds were occupied by camps of Confederate and Union soldiers during the American Civil War. Union Army officers, under the command of William Tecumseh Sherman, stayed in house on November 3, 1863. Confederate generals P. G. T. Beauregard, Nathan Bedford Forrest and Stephen D. Lee visited the home in 1864. General Forrest, his wife, and son stayed with the Foster family for several days. Courtview was occupied by members of the Foster family until 1900, when it was sold to Emmet O'Neal, a Wesleyan University alumnus who served as the 34th Governor of Alabama from 1911 to 1915. After 1915, O'Neal lived in Birmingham and rented out the building as a boarding house. It was acquired by Thomas M. Rogers in 1922 and underwent significant restoration and remodeling. The Rogers family sold the house in 1948 to Florence State Teachers College, now known as the University of North Alabama. During the 1950s, the former residence was used as a guest house and for social events. The parlors on the first floor were used frequently for student meetings. The dining room and adjoining rooms were used by faculty and members of the Florence community. During the early 1980s, alumni, faculty and staff initiated \\"Project Courtview\\", a fund drive to restore Rogers Hall. Over 700 people volunteered their services.

A member of the Conservative Party, he specialised in agriculture, and became a critic of the development of the European Union and especially of the European Commission. Family and education Provan was born in Scotland and attended Ardvreck School in Crieff before going to Oundle School, a public school in Northamptonshire. Rather than pursue an academic career he went on to the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester. In 1960 he married Roweena Lewis; they have a daughter and twin sons. Perthshire In 1965 Provan became area President of Perthshire for the National Farmers Union of Scotland, a position which he also held in 1971. He was an active member of the Conservative Party in Perth and East Perthshire, being Treasurer of the local association from 1975 to 1977. He was a member of the Lord Lieutenant's Queen's Jubilee Appeal Committee in 1977. Political career Provan was elected to Tayside Regional Council in 1978, serving on the Tay River Purification Board. He was selected to be the Conservative Party candidate for North East Scotland for the 1979 European Parliament election, and won the seat despite only obtaining 33% of the vote when his opponents divided the rest evenly. =Agriculture committee= Immediately appointed to the Agriculture and Fisheries Committee, in March 1980 Provan voted against a proposal to increase farm prices by 7.9% because of its consequential increase in the European budget requirement and the proportion devoted to agricultural subsidies.\\"Tory voting in Europe\\" (letter), The Times, 24 March 1980, p. 15.

The Commission rejected the proposal.\\"Full intervention scheme for mutton and lamb ruled out\\", The Times, 21 May 1980, p. 12.

Defeat Provan was elected as a Quaestor in 1987, a job that gave him responsibility for the Parliament's finance and administration. The same year he became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. He published his analysis of the development of the European Community, \\"The European Community: an ever closer union?\\", in 1989. However, the unpopularity of the Conservative Party in Scotland made his position especially vulnerable and at the 1989 European election he was defeated, coming in third behind both the Labour Party and the Scottish National Party. After leaving the European Parliament, Provan went into business, becoming Chairman of McIntosh Donald Ltd and of James McIntosh & Co. He was also executive director of Scottish Financial Enterprise from 1990 to 1991, and became a member of the Agricultural and Food Research Council. From 1992 to 1998 he was chairman of the Rowett Research Institute. Retread Having a home in the south of England, Provan was selected as Conservative candidate for South Downs West in the run-up to the 1994 European Parliament election, a much better area for the Conservatives. He was elected with a 21,000 majority and became the Chief Whip for the Conservative Group.

It had its origins in the lead-up to World War II, during which it was known as the Department of Aircraft Production (DAP). In 1987, GAF was reorganised and renamed as Aerospace Technologies of Australia (ASTA) then privatised. ASTA was purchased by Rockwell USA, who was in turn purchased by Boeing a few years later. ASTA subsequently formed the nucleus of Boeing Australia. History =World War II= Bristol Beaufort production at DAP Australia c. 1943 The entity was established just before the outbreak of World War II when the Australian government recognised that supplies of aircraft from traditional sources could no longer be assured. To ensure supply of aircraft, in 1939 the government set up the new Department of Supply and Development with an Aircraft Construction Branch within that department; both organisations officially came into being on 1 July 1939. The organisation was set up specifically to produce the Bristol Beaufort under licence in Australia. After an evaluation process to assess the operational needs of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), a British Air Mission sent to Australia recommended that the Beaufort be manufactured for delivery to both the RAAF and the Royal Air Force (RAF). It is noteworthy that at this stage (mid-1939) an Australian aircraft industry barely existed. The private-enterprise Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation had by that time completed three of its first product, the Wirraway, and was in the process of building the prototype of its second type, the Wackett. Both of these were single-engined aircraft and the Wackett was not an advanced design by any criterion. The other major aircraft manufacturer, de Havilland Australia, had up to that time mainly assembled aircraft manufactured by its parent company imported into Australia as parts, commencing the delivery of 20 Tiger Moths, built from imported fuselages and locally manufactured wings, to the RAAF in May 1939. Total production in Australia to mid-1939 of all types of aircraft was certainly less than 100, and may have been less than seventy. Most of the types on the list were designed after WW II. and (privately published). These books list every aircraft registered in Australia prior to World War II. Some aircraft were also built and flown in Australia prior to September 1939 that were never registered, or flew exclusively with military identities. Many of these were \\"one-offs\\" and the vast majority were of \\"wood-and-fabric\\" construction like the Tiger Moth. By contrast the Beaufort was a large twin-engined all-metal aircraft of advanced design for the time. An initial order for 180 Beauforts was placed in July 1939, for delivery in equal numbers to the RAAF and RAF. By the time the first aircraft was delivered, the organisation responsible for its manufacture had undergone several changes. In March 1940 the Aircraft Construction Branch was renamed the Aircraft Production Commission. Three months later oversight responsibility was removed from the Minister for Supply and Development to the Minister for Munitions. In June 1941 (by which time production work had begun) the Aircraft Production Commission was removed from the Department of Supply and Development, placed within the newly created Department of Aircraft Production (DAP) and was soon after renamed the Aircraft Advisory Committee for the Co-ordination of Aircraft Production with the actual aircraft manufacturer being constituted as the Beaufort Division, usually referred to as the Beaufort Division of the DAP. As the Australian- built Beaufort was to be fitted with Pratt & Whitney R-1830 engines instead of the Bristol Taurus originally installed, the aircraft required several design changes, this partially accounting for the delay between the initial order and the first flight of the first aircraft in August 1941 (a Bristol-built aircraft had earlier been delivered to Australia and modified, flying with R-1830s for three months prior to this). Another reason for the delay was that various other parts of the aircraft (such as the undercarriage legs) were originally to come from Britain, but because of an embargo by the British Government on War Material after the Fall of France these had to be locally manufactured instead. One seemingly innocuous item caused major problems; no ball bearings were manufactured in Australia at the time, and so with none forthcoming from Britain a local substitute had to be found and incorporated into the design. The original intention was that the first 90 aircraft would be delivered to the RAF; in the event only six were delivered to that air arm, although 59 were assigned RAF serials in the T95xx and T96xx serial number blocks. The flight of the first Australian-built aircraft was the culmination of efforts by over 600 different companies and organisations - the Beaufort Division being more-or-less responsible for only final assembly, with only wing centre-sections of some aircraft being manufactured \\"in-house\\" at Fishermans Bend, gun turrets being manufactured at Fairfield, Victoria, and final assembly on two lines; at Fishermans Bend and at Mascot. Major assemblies were manufactured by the State Rail Workshops of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, and at the General Motors Holden factory in Woodville, South Australia. A total of 700 Beauforts had been built (a figure exceeded only by those for the Wirraway and Tiger Moth among Australian-built aircraft) when production ended in August 1944; by which time the main manufacturing effort had already turned to licence production of the Bristol Beaufighter. Beaufighter production proceeded more smoothly than its forebear, as might be expected when the same sub-contracting companies took part in both programmes. The RAAF had considered the type as early as February 1939 and placed an initial order in June that year, before the prototype had even flown. The same supply problems that delayed the Beaufort ended any chance of the RAAF acquiring Beaufighters for the time being, and it wasn't until the end of 1942 that plans began to be laid for Beaufighter production. The Australian Government gave the go-ahead for manufacture of 350 Beaufighters on 30 January 1943 and preparations got underway in earnest. As the supply of engines from Britain was still uncertain at that time, a Bristol-built aircraft was re-engined with Wright GR-2600 Cyclones as insurance; in the event all Australian-built Beaufighters were fitted with imported Bristol Hercules engines. The first DAP Beaufighter flew for the first time on 26 May 1944 and production and deliveries slightly overlapped those of Beauforts, with the first two dozen Beaufighters being built and delivered concurrently with the last fifty-or-so Beauforts. Orders were increased to 450 but with the end of the War the programme was terminated after 365 had been built,Some publications state that the production total was 364. This is because aircraft damaged during predelivery test flights were not repaired, and therefore were not delivered to the RAAF. with another 21 partially built airframes not delivered. =Postwar operations= Aerial view of GAF along the Yarra River showing the taxiway between the back of the factory and the Fishermans Bend runway c. 1954 London Heathrow in October 1953 before the start of the England-New Zealand air race GAF Jindivik target drone after assembly by Fairey Aviation in the UK in 1961 After the end of the Second World War came a scaling back of the Australian aviation industry, with the number of employees in Australia as a whole being reduced by 90%. In the case of the DAP there was also a reorganisation, the result of which was another name change, the longest-lasting and the one by which the organisation would be best-known - the Government Aircraft Factories (GAF). By the time of the reorganisation, preparations for production of the next type to emerge from the GAF were well underway. This was a version of the Avro Lincoln bomber. The Lincoln B.30 had an extended nose to accommodate two additional crew members and search radar and was used in the bombing and maritime reconnaissance roles. The initial five aircraft were largely assembled from Avro-built components and the first flew on 17 March 1946. A further 68 machines were completely built by the GAF. From 1953, the GAF built 48 English Electric Canberra twin-jet tactical bombers under licence. These aircraft were of the uprated B.20 type with extra range capability. Many served in the RAAFs contribution of forces in the war in Vietnam and some were later converted to T.21 operational training standard. In 1958 the GAF responded to the emerging need for a high performance jet-powered radio controlled target drone by designing the GAF Jindivik in collaboration with aerospace firms in the United Kingdom. It was powered by a Viper jet engine and could be recovered after flight by landing on skids. It served into the 1960s with Australian and United Kingdom military and government entities. =Demise= In 1987, the Government Aircraft Factories was reorganised and renamed as Aerospace Technologies of Australia (ASTA). In June 1995 ASTA was privatised, with the sale proceeds returning $40 million to the Commonwealth. Aerospace Technologies of Australia is now part of Boeing Australia.

Zinc iodide is formed as a byproduct. It has a disagreeable odor, and is pyrophoric. It has been of great importance in the synthesis of organic compounds. It is soluble in alkanes and often sold as a solution in hexanes. It belongs to the large series of similar compounds such as diethylzinc. History This substance was first prepared by Edward Frankland during his work with Robert Bunsen in 1849 at the University of Marburg. After heating a mixture of zinc and methyl iodide in an airtight vessel, a flame burst out when the seal was broken. In the laboratory, this synthesis method remains unchanged today, except that copper or copper compounds are used to activate the zinc. Uses Dimethyl zinc was used for a long time to introduce methyl groups into organic molecules or to synthesize organometallic compounds containing methyl groups. Grignard reagents, (organo-magnesium compounds), which are easier to handle and less flammable replaced organo-zinc compounds in most laboratory syntheses. Due to differences in reactivity (as well as in reaction by- products) between organo-zinc compounds and Grignard reagents, organo-zinc compounds may be preferred in some syntheses. Its high vapor pressure has led to extensive uses in metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) for the preparation of wide band gap II‚ÄìVI semiconducting films (e.g. ZnO, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe) and as p-dopant precursors for III‚ÄìV semiconductors (e.g. GaAs, InP, AlxGa1‚àíxAs), which have many electronic and photonic applications. Structure In the solid state the compound exists in two modifications. The tetragonal high-temperature phase shows a two-dimensional disorder, while the low-temperature phase which is monoclinic is ordered. The molecules are linear with Zn-C bond lengths measuring 192.7(6) pm. The structure of the gas-phase shows a very similar Zn-C distance of 193.0(2) pm.

The station is owned by Alpha Media. Its studios are located in Kettering, Ohio (with a Dayton address) and its transmitter is in New Carlisle, Ohio, northeast of Dayton. History The station began on August 1, 1965 at 101.7 MHz as WCOM, the name coming from the founder and original licensee, Champaign COMmunications, the DBA of parent company Brown Publishing, then the owners of the Urbana Daily Citizen newspaper. It aired a mix of beautiful music and traditional middle of the road throughout the 1960s and 1970s, when the station was managed by Jim Bissey. In the early 1970s, it became FM stereo to liken itself with WHIO-FM and WPTW-FM at 99.1 and 95.7 FM, respectively. Future WIZE DJ Bill Hart began his commercial radio career under Jim Bissey. The station actually programmed some Top 40 rock music at night until Hart graduated from then Urbana College. He was drafted and ended up on the American Forces Radio and Television Network in 1973. Religious programming was aired on Sunday evenings until a gradual format change to adult contemporary began in 1979. The station studios were located across the street from the downtown Chakeres Urbana cinema at 225 South Main Street (upstairs) in an old brick building that also housed a local printing business (downstairs). The building was razed in the 1990s after the studios and offices moved to Springfield. The WCOM call sign is currently used by a low power FM station in Carrboro, North Carolina, after being used as the call sign for Channel 68 in Mansfield, Ohio in the late 1980s, now WMFD-TV. The WKSW callsign is now used at an FM station in Cookeville, Tennessee. WKSW As the adult contemporary format came into being, a new image emerged with it along with a new owner, USA Broadcasting. The call letters changed in 1985 to WKSW as \\"Light Rock and Less Talk...Kiss FM.\\" John Hall (previously with WIZE in Springfield) became its new morning personality and program director during this time. Later, after the format switch to country, Hall moved on to WLW in Cincinnati, WGRR in Hamilton, WBNS (AM) in Columbus, the former WCLR Piqua/WZLR Xenia \\"Oldies 95,\\" and, finally, WULM, the former WBLY in Springfield, before passing in 2004. Kiss Country WKSW switched to a country music format in 1987 after a brief period with an adult contemporary format. After the transmitter had moved to Dallas Road east of U.S. Route 68 approximately halfway between Urbana and Springfield, the studios moved to Derr Road south of Villa Road on the north side of Springfield. The final afternoon personality and Program Director was Lee Riley, who was at WONE (AM) in Dayton during its country music years in the late 70s and 80s. Andy Lawrence, a fixture at the station since 1992, was the station's final morning show host and Assistant Program Director. WKSW-FM was the only commercial station still broadcasting in and for the Springfield and Urbana area. WULM now airs Catholic programming as part of Radio Maria USA, a repeater network originated by KJMJ in Alexandria, Louisiana. WIZE is a repeater of Dayton Sports station 980 WONE (AM). WDHT is licensed to Urbana, but has their tower site located in Springfield. The city of license for WDHT changed with the WKSW Enon move-in to comply with FCC rules. Radio One applied for a move of WKSW's frequency to 101.5 FM and its city of license to Enon prior to selling it to Main Line in 2007; the construction permit for that move, which allows the station to target the Dayton metropolitan area, was approved by the FCC. Through the middle of 2008, the 101.5 frequency had been used by W268AX, a translator of low-power WSWO-LP in Huber Heights.

It is a whodunnit and features the series detective Sir Henry Merrivale. Plot summary Kenwood Blake, introduced in the previous Sir Henry Merrivale mystery The Unicorn Murders, is about to marry his fellow British Secret Service operative, Evelyn Cheyne, 24 hours from now. He is sidetracked by an urgent telegram from Sir Henry asking him to come to Torquay to play an undercover role under an alias by which he is already known, \\"Robert Butler\\". Paul Hogenauer, a German polymath with many skills and interests, has aroused the suspicion of Sir Henry and Colonel Charters, the Chief Constable of the county by his recent interest in ghosts and spiritualism. Sir Henry and Colonel Charters feel that anti-British espionage may underlie recent events, and they suspect the involvement of a German spy known only as L. A police officer observing Hogenauer's house reports \\"the room was dark, but that it seemed to be very full of small, moving darts of light flickering round a thing like a flower-pot turned upside down.\\" Blake, as Butler, drives Sir Henry's car to Hogenauer's house and is promptly arrested‚Äîto his great surprise, Sir Henry and Colonel Charters disavow any knowledge of his actions. Blake/Butler escapes, breaks into Hogenauer's house and finds Hogenauer, dead in his easy chair, grinning from the rictus of strychnine and wearing a Turkish fez. A colleague of Hogenauer, Dr. Keppel, is soon found to be dead in a hotel halfway across town, apparently killed simultaneously with Hogenauer. Blake/Butler and his fianc√©e must stay a step ahead of the police and race around investigating espionage, counterfeiting, spiritualism, and multiple impersonations.

The ship went down in 460 feet (140 m) of water at , in United States waters about 8 miles (7 nm; 13 km) north of Deer Park in Luce County, Michigan. All but one of the 23 members of the crew perished. Construction Cyprus was built in Lorain, Ohio and launched 17 August 1907. She was a 420-foot-long (128 m), 15,000 ton (13,608 tonne) steel-hulled steamer. She was owned by the Lackawanna Steamship Company, (a subsidiary of Pickands Mather and Company) and based out of Fairport, Ohio, northeast of Cleveland, on Lake Erie. A marine trade publication described Cyprus as a very seaworthy vessel in an article published after her sinking. Sinking On only her second voyage, Cyprus was hauling iron ore from Superior, Wisconsin to Buffalo, New York when a moderate gale arose off Deer Park. The gale, according to contemporary accounts, was reported as nothing that Cyprus couldn't have handled. According to Second Mate Charles G. Pitz ‚Äî the sole survivor ‚Äî Cyprus had been pounded by northwesterly waves all afternoon which caused an increasing list to port. At around 7:45 p.m. the ship lurched to port and capsized. Pitz and three others, which included Captain F. B. Huyck (according to some accounts) secured themselves on a raft. By 2:00 a.m. the raft and its occupants were within 300 feet (91 m) of shore when breaking waves flipped the raft, and all but Pitz drowned in the surf. Pitz unwittingly staggered ashore, just a half-mile east of the Deer Park Life-Saving Station. All the bodies but two were eventually recovered. It was never clear what caused the ship to list in the first place. Another steamer, George Stephenson out of Pittsburgh, had passed Cyprus that afternoon and had noted that Cyprus was trailing a red wake, indicating that water was mixing with iron ore dust in its cargo hold before being pumped out. Speculation on the source of the leak has centered on the type of Mulholland sliding hatch cover the nearly new ship had been outfitted with. With a steel on steel seal, this type of hatch was prone to allowing water past unless special tarpaulins were fitted on the hatches. It was not clear if Huyck had ordered these tarpaulins deployed or not. Some alternate theories propose that the engine or rudder failed, leaving Cyprus without the maneuverability needed to avoid wave troughs where ships are most vulnerable to rolling, or propose that labor unrest in Lorain during Cyprus‚Äô construction may have contributed to other, as yet undiscovered flaws. The vessel was a $280,000 loss. Rediscovery In early August 2007 members of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society were using side-scan sonar to search for wrecks off Deer Park when they detected a large object on the bottom of Lake Superior. According to their best guess, it was the SS D.M. Clemson, which sank in that area with all hands on 1 December 1908. A follow- up visit to the vessel with a submersible ROV was made on 18 August 2007. Attempts to identify the vessel as D.M. Clemson were frustrated when the ship‚Äôs name was not on the bow in the place where searchers expected to find it. They then sent the ROV to the stern where they made the startling discovery that it was, in fact, the Cyprus they had located. The Shipwreck Society had previously believed that Cyprus was some ten miles (16 km) north of where it was found. Cyprus was discovered lying on her port side in about 460 feet of water. Her hull is totally intact, which is surprising considering the rather violent manner in which she foundered. Wreckage consisting of wall panelings, doors, railings, pipes, and her cargo of iron ore are scattered about the bottom up to 270 feet away from the wreck. Her name and port of call remains completely legible on her stern. The Shipwreck Society has plans to return to the wreck in the future for forensic research in order to answer some of the lingering questions relating to the sinking of Cyprus.

Content spinning works by replacing specific words, phrases, sentences, or even entire paragraphs with any number of alternate versions to provide a slightly different variation with each spin - also known as Rogeting. This process can be completely automated or written manually as many times as needed. Early content produced through automated methods often resulted in articles which were hard or even impossible to read. However, as article spinning techniques were refined they became more sophisticated, and can now result in perfectly readable articles which appear original. Once considered spamdexing, a black hat SEO practice years ago, the practice is now admitted as a fair way to lower the similarity ratio, resulting large catalogs of more or less similar items. Website authors use article spinning to reduce the similarity ratio of rather redundant pages or pages with thin content, and to avoid penalties in the search engine results pages (SERPs) for using duplicate content. It is also used in other types of applications, such as message personalization and chatbots. Automatic spinning Automatic rewriting can change the meaning of a sentence through the use of words with similar but subtly different meaning to the original. For example, the word \\"picture\\" could be replaced by the word \\"image\\" or \\"photo\\". Thousands of word- for-word combinations are stored in either a text file or database thesaurus to draw from. This ensures that a large percentage of words are different from the original article. The problem with simple automatic writing is that it cannot recognize context or grammar in the use of words and phrases. Poorly- done article spinning can result in unidiomatic phrasing that no human writer would choose. Some may substitute a synonym with the wrong part of speech when encountering a word that can be used as either a noun or a verb, use an obscure word that is only used within very specific contexts, or improperly substitute proper nouns. For example, \\"Great Britain\\" could be auto spun to \\"Good Britain\\". While \\"good\\" could be considered a synonym for \\"great\\", \\"Good Britain\\" does not have the same meaning as \\"Great Britain\\". Article spinning can use a variety of methods; a straightforward one is \\"spintax\\". Spintax (or spin syntax) uses a marked-up version of text to indicate which parts of the text should be altered or rearranged. The different variants of one paragraph, one or several sentences, or groups of words or words are marked. This spintax can be extremely rich and complex, with many depth levels (nested spinning). It acts as a tree with large branches, then many smaller branches up to the leaves. To create readable articles out of spintax, a specific software application chooses any of the possible paths in the tree; this results in wide variations of the base article without significant alteration to its meaning. As of 2017, there are a number of websites which will automatically spin content for an author. Manual spinning Because of the problems with automated spinning, website owners may pay writers or specific companies to perform higher quality spinning manually. Writers may also spin their own articles, allowing them to sell the same articles with slight variations to a number of clients or to use the article for multiple purposes, for example as content and also for article marketing. Plagiarism and duplicate content Google representatives say that Google doesn't penalize websites that host duplicate content, but the advances in filtering techniques mean that duplicate content will rarely feature well in SERPs, which is a form of penalty. In 2010 and 2011, changes to Google's search algorithm targeting content farms aim to penalize sites containing significant duplicate content. In this context, article spinning might help, as it's not detected as duplicate content. Criticisms Article spinning is a way to create what looks like new content from existing content. As such, it can be seen as unethical, whether it is paraphrasing of copyrighted material (to try to evade copyright), deceiving readers into wasting their time for the benefit of the spinner (while not providing additional value to them), or both. Other criticisms liken the results to \\"a haystack of low-quality blog networks and article repositories.\\" References Search engine optimization ","title":"Article spinning"},{"id":"13273262","text":"Death in Five Boxes is a mystery novel by the American writer John Dickson Carr, who published it under the name of Carter Dickson. It is a whodunnit and features the series detective Sir Henry Merrivale and his associate, Scotland Yard's Chief Inspector Humphrey Masters. Plot summary Dr. John Sanders, a serious young forensic scientist, is stopped by a pretty young girl late at night. Marcia Blystone asks him to accompany her to the top floor of a four- story building, to the apartment of Mr. Felix Haye, because she is afraid to go up alone. Before they reach the apartment, he finds an umbrella-swordstick with bloodstains on it, and they are immediately stopped by a clerk from the Anglo-Egyptian Importing Co. Ltd., one floor below Mr. Haye's flat. He mentions grumpily that Haye and his guests have been laughing uproariously and stomping their feet on the floor. When the couple finally enters Haye's flat, they find the host stabbed to death, and his three guests‚Äîincluding Miss Blystone's surgeon father‚Äîunconscious due to atropine poisoning. The couple make their way back to the importing company, where the clerk offers them the telephone and promptly disappears. Upon their recovering consciousness, each of the three guests is questioned about the unusual contents of their pockets. The doctor is carrying four wrist watches; a beautiful dealer in art is carrying a bottle of quicklime and another of phosphorus; and the owner of the Anglo-Egyptian Importing Company is carrying the ringing mechanism of an alarm clock and a convex piece of glass. All three swear that their cocktails were prepared from unopened bottles in the presence of all of them, yet someone has managed to poison them. Chief Inspector Masters brings in Sir Henry Merrivale to investigate the bizarre circumstances. At the offices of Charles Drake, Haye's lawyer, they find the evidence of five small boxes, all empty. They are each labeled with a name‚Äîthe three guests, the clerk, and someone named \\"Judith Adams\\", who turns out to be a deceased author who wrote a book on legendary dragons. It takes all Sir Henry's ingenuity to work out the tangle of relationships and motives and reveal not only who stabbed Felix Haye, but also poisoned the cocktails and how‚Äîand why Judith Adams is the key to it all. Literary significance and criticism According to Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor, \\"As usual, Carter Dickson's plot is extremely complicated and it depends on a variety of gimmicks, most of which are barely plausible. One good one is the method of poisoning the White Lady cocktails without anybody's going near the shaker or the glasses. For the rest, the dialogue is in the worst style of false excitement and byplay, particularly the part allotted to the egregious Sir Henry Merrivale, who calls everybody \\"son\\" and yells \\"shut up\\" whenever he is stumped.

Plot Fourteen-year-old Tolly Devlin and his mother-figure (Beatrice Kay) see four hoods beat his father to death. Tolly vows to avenge his father's death. Tolly becomes a criminal and gets himself sent to prison so that he can get close to the one perpetrator he recognized when his father was being beaten. On his prison deathbed, Tolly manipulates the names of the other 3 killers from him. The remaining 3 killers have risen to the top of the crime syndicate. Tolly works his way into their organization. Becoming a secret informant for the government, Tolly ends up playing both sides in his cagey campaign to bring down the remaining mobsters. One by one he sees to their death/downfall. Once accomplishing his goal, he plans to go straight and marry his girlfriend, Cuddles (Dolores Dorn). The police warn him that without bringing down Conners, the head of the syndicate, he has no chance of getting out alive. Tolly is planning to leave when he finds out Conners is planning to have Cuddles and other innocents killed. He decides that Conners must be stopped. In the process of killing Conners, Tolly is shot.

An opening scene with a Union of Prostitutes was deleted by Sam Briskin and other Columbia executives. Fuller's character Tolly is a loner motivated by revenge using the United States Government as well as his own devices to even the score. Fuller heard the reaction of a real life gangster who reportedly said \\"If only my son would have that kind of affection for me!\\". Reception =Critical response= Film critic Dennis Schwartz liked the film, and wrote, \\"Samuel Fuller's revenge crime thriller is shot in the same brisk and violent manner he shoots his war films. The timely crime film hopes to cash in on the public's thirst for mob stories, as it takes place after the well-covered mob gathering in Apalachin, New York; Fuller based his film on a series of expos√© articles in The Saturday Evening Post ... Fuller's violent noir film shows the inhumanity of the soldiers in the war on crime, where neither the syndicate or Tolly react with basic human responses. Their drive to succeed overrides everything, even love. The FBI is shown as stymied without the help of the public coming forth with information or willing to act as witnesses despite the risks, but the lawmen do not play fair by not telling how dangerous it's to be a witness against the mob.\\" Schwartz, Dennis.

His notable works include the score for The Night of the Hunter and the Dragnet Theme. (The Dragnet theme was lifted, inadvertently according to Schumann, from Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa's score from the 1946 film The Killers.) Career Schumann was born in New York City in 1913. By the early 1930s, he was attending law school at USC when he abruptly quit his studies to perform in a college dance band. Eventually, the members of the band went their separate ways but Schumann continued on within the music industry, working with Eddie Cantor on Cantor's radio show, and recording with Andre Kostelanetz. Following the outbreak of World War II, Schumann enlisted, eventually becoming the musical director of the Armed Forces Radio Service. He worked with most of the major acts of the war on all the radio shows AFRS produced during this time. After the war, he returned to Los Angeles and worked in the movie and television industry as a composer and arranger, mostly on several Abbott & Costello films. In 1949, Schumann was asked to compose a new theme for a police detective show about to make its debut on the NBC Radio network. He began his theme with a four-note motif‚Äîquite possibly the second most famous four-note motif after Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Dragnet became a smash hit on the radio, and then television and Schumann's theme quickly became instantly recognizable. He wrote one opera, John Brown's Body, which premiered in Los Angeles in 1953 and subsequently ran for sixty-five performances on Broadway at the New Century Theatre.Opera Glass Around this time, Schumann gathered together 20 talented vocalists and The Voices Of Walter Schumann was born. The ensemble recorded several easy-listening albums, similar to those recorded by Jackie Gleason, for both Capitol Records and RCA Victor. By 1955, Schumann was busy composing and conducting the score to the classic Robert Mitchum film The Night of the Hunter and won an Emmy for his wildly popular Dragnet theme. He recorded a space-age themed, spoken-word album titled Exploring the Unknown, and his \\"Voices\\" troupe recorded a popular, 19-track Christmas album, The Voices of Christmas. The latter album was reissued on compact disc by Collector's Choice Music in November 2007 ‚Äì 52 years after its initial debut both as an LP and 3-record 45 RPM set. There was a tribute to him on the centennial anniversary of his birth.Centennial Birthday Tribute to Walter Schumann Death In 1956 and 1957 Schumann continued to record with the Voices and they appeared on the first season of NBC's The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford. However, by the summer of 1958, poor health prompted Schumann to be admitted to the Mayo Clinic, where he underwent one of the first open heart surgeries in the United States. Complications arose following the operation, and Schumann died on August 21, 1958, aged 44, just weeks before the third season of The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show was scheduled to begin. Members of Schumann's \\"Voices\\" ensemble were stunned by his sudden death but decided to continue performing. They were renamed \\"The Top Twenty,\\" and they carried on with Ford for another five years.

Smith's work focuses on issues of violence against women of color and their communities, specifically Native American women. A co-founder of INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence, the Boarding School Healing Project, and the Chicago chapter of Women of All Red Nations, Smith has based her activism and her scholarship on the lives of women of color and long claimed to be Cherokee. Formerly an assistant professor of American Culture and Women's Studies at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Smith currently serves as a professor in the Department of Ethnic Studies at University of California, Riverside. In July 2015, Smith attracted national attention for having claimed Cherokee identity without proof or acceptance by the Cherokee nation. Smith said that her \\"enrollment status does not impact [her] Cherokee identity\\" and that she always has been and always will be Cherokee. Five Cherokee women scholars issued a public statement decrying Smith's Cherokee claims as false, noting that citizenship is based on community and kinship, and damaged by such abuse of integrity. Her claims have also been rejected by other Native scholars, saying her actions have damaged trust between indigenous and non-indigenous scholars. David Cornsilk, a Cherokee genealogist, notes she has no family connections to documented Cherokee ancestors or relatives. Early life and education Smith was born in San Francisco, California and grew up in Southern California. Smith earned her bachelor's degree at Harvard University in Comparative Study of Religion, and her Masters of Divinity at the Union Theological Seminary in 1997.\\"The Bible and the American Myth: A Symposium on the Bible and Constructions of Meaning\\", Studies in American Biblical Hermeneutics (16) In 2002, she received her Ph.D. in History of Consciousness from UC Santa Cruz. Activism and professional work Smith has long been active in anti-violence activism, serving as a rape crisis counselor and starting the Chicago chapter of Women of All Red Nations.(PDF) Along with Nadine Naber, Smith co-founded INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence in 2000, and she plays a prominent role in its National Planning Committee. INCITE! is a national grassroots organization that engages in direct action and critical dialogue to end violence against women of color and their communities. Smith was also a founding member of the Boarding School Healing Project (BSHP). According to its website, the BSHP \\"seeks to document Native boarding school abuses so that Native communities can begin healing ... and demand justice.\\" Smith has worked with Amnesty International as a Bunche Fellow, coordinating the research project on sexual violence and American Indian women. She represented the Indigenous Women's Network and the American Indian Law Alliance at the United Nations World Conference Against Racism in 1991. In 2005, Smith, in recognition of her research and work regarding violence against women of color in the US, was among 1000 women nominated as a group for the Nobel Peace Prize by Ruth-Gaby Vermot-Mangold, a Swiss parliament member. As of March 2013, Smith serves as the U.S. Coordinator for the Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians. Smith and her sister Justine were faculty members at the North American Institute for Indigenous Theological Studies. Critical work Smith's critical work centers on genocide and acts of violence against Native women. She discusses patriarchy as a tool of settler colonial violence used to subdue and eradicate Native women. In her text Conquest: Sexual Violence And American Indian Genocide, Smith gives a genealogical study of state-sanctioned violence against Native women and against their reproductive health from early America to the 19th century. Smith's work makes a critical intervention in Native American Studies which she argues has a tendency to dismiss patriarchy as outside the purview of analysis of Native scholarship. Most Native scholars dismiss patriarchy because they identify it as a uniquely Western manifestation forced onto Native populations through assimilation. Smith argues that despite the fact that patriarchy is not intrinsic to Native society, its fundamental importance in the domination and extermination of Native peoples and Native women in particular should not be discounted.. Retrieved March 24, 2013 Awards * Gustavus Myers Outstanding Book Award (2005) for Conquest: Sexual Violence and American Indian Genocide * California State University (Northridge) Phenomenal Woman Award (2010) Controversies =Tenure denial= On February 22, 2008, Smith was denied tenure from the College of Literature, Science and the Arts at the University of Michigan. This decision attracted \\"an unusual degree of attention from scholars, both at Ann Arbor and nationally.\\" Some 30 faculty and students concluded \\"the University's tenure evaluation process discriminates against women of color and interdisciplinary professors.\\" A statement issued by an anonymous group of students and faculty from the University of Michigan protesting the decision immediately began circulating via email and among feminist blogs. The statement refers to Smith as \\"one of the greatest indigenous feminist intellectuals of our time\\" and highlights Smith's relevance as both a scholar and social justice advocate, noting that as \\"a result of her work, scholars, social service providers, and community-based organizations throughout the United States have shifted from state-focused efforts to more systemic approaches for addressing violence against women.\\" A Facebook group in support of Smith's tenure bid and online petition to University of Michigan provost Teresa Sullivan soon followed. = Cherokee ancestry claim = Since at least 1991, Smith has publicly claimed to be Cherokee although she was not enrolled in any federally recognized Cherokee tribe.Andy Smith (November/December 1991), \\"For All Those Who Were Indian in a Former Life,\\" Ms. Magazine, p44-45 Cherokee Nation-United Keetoowah Band genealogist David Cornsilk claims that Smith hired him twice in the 1990s to research her genealogy and that he found no proof of Cherokee ancestry. In 2007, Smith was said to admit uncertainty regarding her Cherokee descent to scholar Patti Jo King and Richard Allen at a conference, apologizing and agreeing to set the record straight.Mark Edwin Miller, Claiming Tribal Identity: The Five Tribes and the Politics of Federal Acknowledgment, Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2013 Native lawyer Steve Russell (Cherokee Nation) publicly accused Smith of ethnic fraud in a 2008 editorial published by Indian Country Today, but it was not widely read. Smith failed to set the record straight; and her lack of documented Cherokee descent became \\"something of an open secret\\" until 2015. She continued to be identified at professional events as Cherokee or Native American, and claimed it was part of the reason for her denial of tenure at the University of Michigan (see above). Following the media attention surrounding activist Rachel Dolezal in 2015, who falsely claimed African-American identity, an anonymous Tumblr, \\"Andrea Smith is not Cherokee\\", was published, listing a chronology of book and conference biographies of Smith that refer to her purported Cherokee ancestry. The Daily Beast picked up the story, and it attracted national attention. Genealogist David Cornsilk noted in an Open Letter in Indian Country Today in July 2015 that the Cherokee are a very well- documented people, and he asserts that Cherokee citizenship is based on recognition by the Cherokee people and participation in the community, not by an individual such as Smith asserting a belief in a self-derived, independent identity. In the ensuing controversy, some supporters of Smith started a group blog \\"Against a Politics of Disposability.\\" Incite!, the collective that Smith helped to found, told the Daily Beast, \\"We support Andy Smith and the self- determination of all First Nations People. Incite would rather place our collective resources into abolishing settler colonialism than in perpetuating this ideology by policing her racial and tribal identity.\\" However, Native American scholars and activists have largely spoken in opposition to Smith. In an Open Letter, twelve Native women scholars jointly wrote, > \\"Asking for accountability to our communities and collectivities is not > limited to Andrea Smith. Asking for transparency, self-reflexivity, and > honesty about our complex histories and scholarly investments is motivated > by the desire to strengthen ethical indigenous scholarship by both > indigenous and non-indigenous scholars.\\" They also noted the names of numerous indigenous scholars who have made contributions in the same field as Smith, saying that they had sometimes been overlooked. They said, \\"Andrea Smith has a decades-long history of self- contradictory stories of identity and affiliation testified to by numerous scholars and activists, including her admission to four separate parties that she has no claim to Cherokee ancestry at all.\\" Five Cherokee women scholars, including Patti Jo King, also published an Open Letter, saying that Smith's claims damaged tribal integrity and kinship, and that she had tried to build her career on a false base. King said, \\"... since Andrea Smith has never been affiliated with any of our communities, she is a cultural outsider.\\" King said further, \\"it is Smith‚Äôs deception‚Äînot her enrollment status and not her advocacy‚Äîthat constitutes the central issue.' Native American studies ethnographer David Shorter wrote, \\"Andrea Smith surely thinks she is Cherokee; or she did at some point. She has been asked repeatedly to either stop claiming Cherokee identity or to either authenticate her claims through a reliable kinship, through ties to a specific family, or through the Cherokee Nation‚Äôs official process for enrollment.\\" Smith's sister, Justine, has also claimed Cherokee ancestry and is likewise accused of ethnic fraud. She allegedly falsified a tribal card of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma. Justine, who has the same parents as Andrea, also claims Ojibway heritage. She was announced as Native American when hired by the Saint Paul School of Theology in Oklahoma, but left after three months after being confronted about her identity when the Cherokee Nation disputed her claim. Andrea Smith responded to the protests and accusations in July 2015 with a statement on her blog asserting that her \\"enrollment status does not impact [her] Cherokee identity,\\" and that she always has been and always will be Cherokee.

Biography Leith (1881) He was born in the Santa Croce quarter of Florence, and showed an early inclination toward the study of literature, but with the encouragement of his father, Giovanni Signorini (1808-1864), a court painter for the Grand Duke of Tuscany, he decided instead to study painting.Steingr√§ber, E., & Matteucci, G. 1984, p. 115 In 1852 he enrolled at the Florentine Academy, and by 1854 he was painting landscapes en plein air. The following year he exhibited for the first time, showing paintings inspired by the works of Walter Scott and Machiavelli at the Societ√† Promotrice delle Belle Arti. In 1855, he began frequenting the Caff√® Michelangiolo in Florence, where he met Giovanni Fattori, Silvestro Lega, Saverio Altamura and several other Tuscan artists who would soon be dubbed the Macchiaioli. The Macchiaioli, dissatisfied with the antiquated conventions taught by the Italian academies of art, started painting outdoors in order to capture natural light, shade, and color. They were forerunners of the Impressionists who, beginning in the 1860s, would pursue similar aims in France. Signorini was a volunteer in the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859, and afterwards painted military scenes which he exhibited in 1860 and 1861. He made his first trip outside Italy in 1861 when he visited Paris, to which he would often return in the decades that followed. There he met Degas and a group of expatriate Italian artists in his orbit, including Giovanni Boldini, Giuseppe De Nittis, and Federico Zandomeneghi; unlike them, however, Signorini remained rooted in Italy.Broude 1987, pp. 136-137 He became not only one of the leading painters of the Macchiaioli, but also their leading polemicist. Art historian Giuliano Matteucci has written: \\"If we acknowledge Fattori and Lega as the major creative figures of the macchiaioli, then Signorini must surely be recognized as their 'deus ex machine'\\", describing his role as \\"that of catalyst and energetic doctrinarian. In transforming attention away from history painting and the academic portrait towards a new poetical interpretation of natural landscape, the part of Signorini was of fundamental consequence to macchiaioli painting.\\"Steingr√§ber, E., & Matteucci, G. 1984, p. 36 =Exhibitions= Ward of the Madwomen at S. Bonifazio (1865) His presence at exhibitions was frequent and prolific. In 1860, at the Societ√† Promotrice, he exhibited seven paintings, including I Toscani a Calcinato (The Calcined Tuscans). In 1861, he sent to Turin a somewhat polemical The ghetto of Venice. In 1865, he exhibited Le pazze (The Crazy Ones). In 1869 he made a series of etchings, and visited Paris for the second time. In 1870, at the Expositions of Parma and the Societ√† Promotrice, he exhibited November which received a prize. In 1873, he traveled to Paris and London with De Nittis. Signorini exhibited Fuori porta Arianna a Ravenna (Outside the Arianna Gate, Ravenna) at the Exposition of Naples in 1877. His painting L'alzaia (The Towpath, completed in the 1860s) won awards at the Exposition of Vienna of 1874. In 1880, he exhibited in Turin the painting depicting The Ponte Vecchio. In 1881, he traveled to paint in Scotland. At the 1882 Societ√† Promotrice, he displayed The Ghetto of Florence and Riomaggiore. In 1883: Princes Street in Edinburgh; A Primi Castagnaio e Adolescenza, the latter also exhibited Turin in 1884, along with the canvas of the ghetto.

Signorini was also a passionate art critic, and was published in art journals, including a series of 99 sonnets titled Le 99 discussioni artistiche di E. G. Molten√¨. In 1882, he was nominated professor of the Florentine Academy but declined the appointment. ‚Äò‚ÄòDizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti.‚Äô‚Äô, by Angelo de Gubernatis. Tipe dei Successori Le Monnier, 1889, page 475-476. =Works= Among his most notable paintings are The Ward of the Madwomen at S. Bonifazio in Florence (1865, Venice, Gallery of Modern Art in the C√† Pesaro); Prison Bath in Portoferraio (ca. 1890, Florence, Gallery of Modern Art in the Palazzo Pitti), which portrays the well-known brigand Carmine Crocco during his imprisonment; and Leith (1881, Florence, Gallery of Modern Art in Palazzo Pitti). The latter, a street scene observed on a trip to Scotland, is predominantly gray in tonality, but dominated by a brightly colored Rob Roy Whisky billboard on the side of a building. Art historian Norma Broude has written of Leith: > On the formal level, certainly, the Rob Roy sign arrests our attention and > plays with our expectations here as audaciously as a collage element in an > early twentieth-century cubist composition. What permitted and encouraged > Signorini's experimentation in this remarkably precocious and unprecedented > manner was unquestionably the experience of photography ... For with his > vision conditioned by that experience, he could accept‚Äîas the eye of the > camera accepts‚Äî what artists before him would normally have pruned or > screened out of their interpretations of such a scene.Broude 1987, pp. > 142-143 The influence of photography is often suggested by the asymmetrical compositions of Signorini's works, and his late etchings of street scenes reveal additional influences: those of Japanese art, and Whistler, in their simplifications of shape, atmospheric effects, and flattened treatment of space. He began teaching at the Instituto Superiore di Belle Arti in Florence, and died in that city on February 1, 1901.

CS stood for city/street, as it was aimed at urban commuters and it was also known as the Scarver, a portmanteau of street and carver. The CS was the third generation in the F650 single series, after the 1993‚Äì2001 F650, and 2000‚Äì7 F650GS. It was known for its offbeat styling intended to attract new motorcyclists. Design The F650CS was designed by American David Robb, Vice President of BMW Motorrad Design from 1993 to 2012, and designer of the R1100RT, K1200RS, R1200C, R1100S and K1200LT. The bike was the result of a partnership between BMW and Aprilia. The storage compartment where most motorcycles have the fuel tank. Many elements of the design, such as the striking colors used for the coordinated body panels, the Space Age instrument panel, translucent passenger grab handles, and slickly serviceable storage compartment had a consumer appliance feel and appearance, \\"remind[ing] you of current computer peripherals such as HP ScanJet printers.\\" Its small transparent wind screen seemed \\"iMac-inspired\\", and the use of translucent polycarbonate elsewhere hinted at Apple's style at the time. The addition of superfluous oblong slots with incongruous rubber inserts along the sides of the aluminum frame led Rider magazine to quip that it was \\"overstyled\\". BMW \\"ripped a page from the strategy book of Apple Computer Inc\\" with its three \\"youth-oriented\\" color choices, azure blue metallic, golden orange metallic and beluga blue. One of the F650CS removable bag options. To help attract the fashion conscious buyer, the F650CS had special color options for the side panels, either to match the other body panels or in aluminum, and a choice of two seat colors, for a total of 24 permutations. This modularity extended to the multi-use top storage compartment, which came with a small removable soft bag, and was used for an optional larger soft shoulder bag, or a hard plastic case which could have added an audio system with a CD player. The ignition key matched all three different locking compartment options, and the audio system was integrated with the speedometer so that it automatically increased the music volume at higher speeds and increased the bass at low speed. While the F650CS was similar to the GS released in 2000, it had several unique features including a single-sided swingarm, toothed belt drive, modular soft case baggage, and a storage area in what would traditionally be the top tank of the bike. The fuel tank was instead placed underneath the rear half of the seat, with the fuel filler cap on the right hand side of the rear of the bike. A toothed belt drive is cleaner, quieter, and more responsive than a chain drive, and requires less maintenance, but has greater power losses. Traditionally, BMW has favored shaft drive, but for the first time chose belt drive for this application for its advantages in cost and weight over shaft drive, and because it did not require the frequent cleaning, lubrication, and adjustment of roller chain drive, as well as lasting longer than a chain and running quieter. Using belt drive was consistent with the intent to attract new motorcyclists who might not be comfortable with the mechanical chores normally associated with motorcycling. Though belt drives have greater power loss than chains, which are typical of high-performance motorcycles, they do not suffer from chain lash, since chains must be kept slightly loose but belts remain tight at all times, meaning the responsiveness of the drivetrain is comparable to a heavier and more costly shaft drive. Performance The Rotax single-cylinder engine was low-powered compared to the liter class superbikes that could be had for the same price at the time, but considered on its own merits the bike's (rear wheel) was more than adequate for spirited riding in an urban setting, and the rear wheel torque allowed for easy acceleration when maneuvering in traffic. Testers found the handling light and quick, and surprisingly enjoyable in low-speed twisties and canyon curves. Acceleration was tested at in 4.72 to 5.47 seconds and 13.07 seconds to the ¬º mile at . Braking was . Sales Initial press reaction among motorcycle critics was uniformly positive, particularly praising BMW for taking a bold and innovative risk, and for their willingness to break traditional molds and entice consumers other than the typical motorcycle rider, though they worried that the cachet of the BMW label would not be enough to justify the premium price. It appeared at a time when most motorcycles were increasing in horsepower and specialization, and the F650CS went against those marketing trends, aimed instead at urban commuters, non-traditional riders, new motorcyclists, women, and shorter riders. The model was one example of BMW's efforts to combat becoming too much of an \\"old man's brand\\", and expand beyond their famous touring machines into new markets. The bike's designer David Robb said that, \\"If we want to offer something to new people we have to offer something new.\\" The large storage space and ease of use suggested the F650CS could attract scooter commuters as well as motorcyclists. BMW estimated 40% of sales would come from non-motorcyclists. It was BMW's first entry-level motorcycle since the R65 of 1978‚Äì1984. The F650CS was derived from the dual-sport F650GS single, which was BMW's top selling model worldwide in 2001. In its Canadian advertising campaign, the bike was tied with images of extreme sports in unlikely locales, like snowboarding down Mount Everest and windsurfing whitecaps in the Pacific Ocean, accompanied by lines such as \\"You feel the urge to windsurf across the Pacific Ocean... but what you really need is a ride on the new F650CS.\\" Hendrik von Kuenheim, president and CEO of BMW Group explained that, \\"These riders want a bike that expresses their individuality and expands on their already exciting lifestyle.\\" Ads were placed in lifestyle magazines rather than specialty motorcycle magazines. But for the year 2002, Motorcyclist magazine described the F650CS's sales as an \\"unmitigated flop\\", which languished alongside other lightweight European motorcycles that consumers found too expensive outside their home markets. Three years later, in 2005, the F650CS was discontinued, and the F800 series was introduced in 2006, but it was a different class of motorcycle, aimed at the middleweight sport bike segment, for riders looking to upgrade from their first bike, or return to motorcycling, rather than the beginning motorcyclist market. The F800 had a straight-twin engine, not a single, and though it shared belt drive with the F650CS and boasted its own technical innovations, it did not push the design envelope with the kind of unusual features found on the CS, nor did it elicit commentary for the polarizing nontraditional styling the CS was noted for.

Their particular distinction from other paid soldiers of the time was that they were organised into bands or routes.OED definition of routier The term is first used in the 12th century but is particularly associated with free companies who terrorised the French countryside during the Hundred Years' War.  Routiers of the 12th and 13th centuries  Although paid soldiers were known before the 12th century, the phenomenon of distinct bands (German Rotten, French routes) of mercenary soldiers, often mainly footsoldiers (spearmen, slingers, javelineers, archers and crossbowmen), appears to date from the mid 12th century. Exactly what distinguishes these mercenaries from simple paid soldiers is disputed by scholars but common elements include fighting for profit (as opposed to other reasons such as fealty or faith) and a \\"foreignness\\" of coming from a different geographical area to that in which they were fighting. Numerous different terms were used for these troops, some geographical (e.g. Braban√ßons from Brabant, Aragones from Aragon, Bascoli from the Basque country) and other nicknames (e.g. cotereaux or cotereli, perhaps from the knife they carried). Mercenary bands were mainly seen in France, Aquitaine and Occitania but also Normandy, England and the lands of the Holy Roman Emperor. They were noted for their lawlessness, with many complaints from the church about their depredations, leading to an explicit condemnation by the Third Lateran Council in 1179. Mercenary bands continued to be used but by the early 13th century they began to decline. While useful, they became increasingly unpopular. In England, not only was their brutality condemned, but the rise of mercenary leaders of lowly origins to high office caused friction within the nobility. King John's use of mercenaries in his civil wars led to condemnation and banishment of mercenaries in Magna Carta in 1215.Prestwich, Michael (1996) Armies and Warfare in the Middle Ages: The English Experience, New Haven: Yale University Press , pp. 152-3 Mercenary bands also fell from favour in France in the early 13th century, the end of the Albigensian Crusade and the beginning of a long period of domestic peace removing the context in which the routiers flourished. Norman Housely (1999), Ch.6 European Warfare c.1200- 1320 in Keen (1999), p. 115 Routiers in the Hundred Years' War The Hundred Years' War, which lasted from 1337 to 1453, was the backdrop to their pillaging. The Hundred Years' War was fought between two royal families over control of the French throne: the Plantagenets from England, and the House of Valois from France. The War, which is divided into three stages - the Edwardian War (1337-1360), the Caroline War (1369-1389), and the Lancastrian War (1415-1429) - saw the development of new tactics and weaponry that revolutionised warfare during that time period. By 1348 the Black Death was tearing through Europe, England was bankrupt, and Edward was invading mainland France. In 1347 Edward besieged the city of Calais on the English Channel. Capturing Calais was a major strategic victory, which allowed the English to permanently keep troops in France. King Edward‚Äôs son, the Black Prince, led a large band of routiers, captured the French King John II, and soon the French government began to fall apart. =Origins= The routiers' history can be traced back to a few years after the start of the Hundred Years' War, to Brittany in the early 1340s. No revenue was being generated from the revenues of the Duchy of Brittany for the English army, which meant that the English soldiers had to live off the land. This ‚Äúliving off the land‚Äù began as simple freebooting, but quickly transformed into patis, or ‚Äúransoms of the country‚Äù. A village near a garrison would usually be ransacked for any supplies. Subsequently the village would be forced to pay the respective garrison for future protection.Sumption, Jonathan (2001) The Hundred Years War II: Trial by Fire, University of Pennsylvania Press, , pp27-9 This system soon caused much instability in the region for a few reasons. The patis system did not generate any revenue for the English cause but it made small fortunes for individual captains. These captains, whose income depended on controlling an area, rather than wages from the Duchy, were hard to control. While in theory, the King's Lieutenant could rely on his garrisons in time of war, they were scarcely enthusiastic combatants. Furthermore, garrisons that were stationed in fringe territories were subject to boredom, which was relieved by random brutality. That state, coupled with the fact that they were surrounded by hostile inhabitants, caused a lot of animosity between the peasants and soldiers, which in a few instances led to skirmishes and made the task of governing the Duchy harder.Sumption (2001), pp29-30 The problem was not confined to Brittany. Ch√¢teau de Lusignan was a fortress near Poitiers captured by the Earl of Lancaster in September 1346. When the Earl withdrew from the area he left a garrison under the command of Bertrand de Montferrand. Many of his troops were men with questionable pasts; criminals and misfits. Despite a truce between 1346-1350, the garrison laid waste to over fifty parishes, ten monasteries, and destroyed towns and castles throughout southern Poitou. In May 1347, a French force was sent to recapture the fortress but were ambushed by the garrison and forced to retreat.Sumption (2001), p.43 =Nature of the Companies= Geographical origins Routiers were usually referred to as ‚ÄúEnglishmen‚Äù by their victims, but they were actually composed for the most part by Gascons, after the name of the region of what is now South-West France in which they resided.Urban, William (2006) : Medieval Mercenaries, Greenhill Books, p.95 But the Gascons were considered then as a distinct people from the French. The full demographic that filled the ranks of the routiers included Spaniards, Germans, English, and Frenchmen.Urban (2006), p.106 Although there had been major raiding campaigns led by English noblemen such as the Prince of Wales, many individual routes were led by Gascon officers. Kenneth Fowler has examined the origins of 166 named captains. Ninety one of these were involved in the Great Companies. 36 were English, 26 from English Aquitane, 19 were Gascons, five from B√©arn and five from Germany. In addition to these, there were a group of 45 Breton captains and a further group from Navarre.Fowler, Kenneth (2001) : Medieval Mercenaries vol.1 The Great Companies, Blackwell, Oxford, , pp.6-7 Organisation Unlike the earlier routiers companies, the routes of the Hundred Years' War were primarily mounted forces. Their main fighting men were men-at-arms, sometimes accompanied by mounted infantry including mounted archers. For example, the companies operating around Auverne in September 1363 were estimated at 2,000 lances of men-at-arms and 1,000 mounted infantry.Fowler (2001), p.6 In addition, the companies could be accompanied by groups of pillagers. A route operating around Beaune in September 1364 were numbered as 120 \\"good lances\\", 100 other combatants \\"not including pillagers\\", suggesting these last were not considered as militarily significantFowler (2001), p.106 Larger companies of routiers could be surprisingly well organised. They each had a command structure with a staff that even included secretaries to collect and disperse their loot.Fowler (2001), p.9 A few of the groups had their own uniforms, such as the notorious Bandes Blanches of the Archpriest Arnaud de Cervole. =Examples of routiers= John Hawkwood is the most famous of the English routiers. Beginning as a routier, he ultimately spent three decades as a mercenary captain in Italy. References  Bibliography *Seward, Desmond, The Hundred Years War.

(Manx Gaelic, meaning \\"black dog\\"): \\"They say, that an Apparition called, in their language, the Mauthe Doog, etc. is a phantom black hound in Manx folklore that reputedly haunted Peel Castle on the west coast of the Isle of Man. The Manx name Moddey Dhoo was transcribed as Mauthe Doog ( by an influential 18th-Century English-speaking folklore source, which led to a history of misspellings of the proper name. Old Legend The English topographer and poet George Waldron seems to be the sole definitive written authority of this folklore localized in the castle. Waldron transcribes the original Manx name \\"Moddey Dhoo\\" as \\"Mauthe Doog\\", and describes the dog thus: There used to be a passage connected to the Peel Castle, traversing the church grounds, leading to the apartment of the Captain of the Guard, and \\"the Mauthe Doog was always seen to come from that passage at the close of day, and return to it again as soon as the morning dawned\\"., p.24, \\"I forgot to mention..\\", etc. Waldron reports that one drunken guard of the castle, who in defiance of the dog, went against the usual procedure of locking up the castle gate in pairs and did this all alone. Emboldened by liquor, he \\"snatched up the keys\\" when it wasn't even his turn to do so. The watchman after locking up was supposed to use the haunted passage to deliver the keys to the captain. Some noises were heard, the adventurer returned to the guard-room, ghastly frightened, unable to share the story of what he had seen, and died three days later.https://ztevetevans.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/the-legend-of-the-moddey- dhoo-of-peel-castle-isle-of-man/ That was the last sighting of the dog. But the passage was sealed up and never used again after the haunting, and a different pathway constructed. The dog was made known to the world at large when Sir Walter Scott introduced the \\"Manthe Dog -- a fiend, or demon, in the shape of a large, shaggy, black mastiff\\" in Peveril of the Peak (1823), an installment of his Waverley novels., Peveril of the Peak, I, p.241 Here he freely adapted the folklore to suit his plot, but Scott derived knowledge of this folklore through Waldron's work (see below), as he candidly gave credit in his \\"author's notes\\". (Lang's edition of 1893), p.295ff. Note how Scott took liberty to scale up the size of the dog in his novel. Modern sightings William Walter Gill (d. 1963), has preserved some of the local lore regarding the Black Dog appearing around the Manx landscape, as well as firsthand eyewitness accounts: A field near Ballamodda, near a field named Robin y Gate, \\"Robin of the Road,\\" was haunted by an \\"ordinary moddey dhoo,\\" as opposed to Ballagilbert Glen (aka Kinlye's Glen), where stood a farmhouse on the east side, and in the lane leading to it \\"lurked a moddey dhoo, headless like that at Hango.\\", chapter 4, p.319ff Gill also reports sightings of Moddey Dhoo at a spot called \\"Milntown corner\\" close to Ramsey. In 1927, a friend saw it turning towards Glen Auldyn, and it was \\"black, with long shaggy hair, with eyes like coals of fire,\\" and a doctor while driving the road beyond the corner 1931 encountered \\"a big black dog-like creature nearly the size of a calf, with bright staring eyes.\\", chapter 6, p.254 As to the version where the black dog is described \\"as big as a calf and with eyes like pewter plates\\" (), this seems to derive from a report of a modern sighting of the calf-sized dog (), combined with the description of the eyes of a troll in Asbjornsen and Moe's Norwegian folktale collection.

He commanded a Christian Arab army in the Battle of Yarmouk in 636. After the Muslim conquest of the Levant he converted to Islam around the year 638. Any conversion was apparently short-lived, however. Two years after the defeat at Yarmouk and his apparent conversion to Islam, he was punished by the Caliph and ordered to pay a fine. Not wishing to, he absconded, with as many as 30,000 followers, to the Byzantine Empire.\\"The Origins of the Islamic State\\", a translation from the Arabic of the \\"Kitab Futuh al-Buldha of Ahmad ibn-Jabir al-Baladhuri\\", trans. by P.

Jabalah Ibn-Al-Aiham's ordeal with Islam There are different opinions about why Jabalah and his followers did not convert to Islam. All the opinions go along the general idea that the Ghassanids were not interested yet in giving up their status as the lords and nobility of Syria. Jabalah Ibn-Al-Aiham sided with the Ansar (Azdi Muslims from Medina) saying, \\"You are our brethren and the sons of our fathers\\" and professed Islam. After the arrival of 'Umar ibn-al-Khattab in Syria, in the year 17 (638 AD), Jabalah was conducting a pilgrimage in Mecca. During his tawaf around the kaaba a poor man mistakenly stepped on his robe, making Jabalah almost trip over. This angered Jabalah so much that he hit the man in the eye, after which the man went to the Caliph 'Umar bin Khattab, who then requested that Jabalah be summoned to trial. After displaying the facts of the case, 'Umar ordered that Jabalah be hit by the poor man on the eye in the same manner by which the man himself was hit, but Jabala resisted this saying \\"Is his eye like mine?\\" upon which the Caliph 'Umar responded that \\"Islam has made you both equal.\\" Jabalah requested that the Caliph carry out the sentence the next morning, and he fled to his village during the night. He then apostatized and went to the land of the Greeks (the Byzantines).

Political career and activities During the early 1940s, Maleki had been one of 53 left-wing intellectuals who had been imprisoned by Reza Shah. After his release, he had been one of the original founders of the Tudeh Party (i.e. party of the masses), a communist and pro-USSR organization that desired to transform Iran into a socialist state modeled on that of the Soviet Union. The group played a significant role in organizing labor unrest and pushing for improved wages and living conditions for the working class of Iran, particularly those working in the oil fields of Khuzestan (then under the control of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company or AIOC). But the party was widely believed to be taking its orders from Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and because of this, many Iranians regarded them as traitors. In time, Maleki came to believe that the Tudeh Party was a proxy force of the USSR and for this reason he broke off from the group and began to denounce them. Along with Dr. Mozzafar Baghai, he helped to create the Toilers Party of Iran, an organization ostensibly dedicated to establishing socialism and democracy in Iran, but which was also very anti- communist. In contrast to the Tudeh Party, Maleki argued that Iran should be independent of both the West (i.e. Great Britain) and East (Soviet Union). However, in 1952, Maleki broke with Baghai over the latter's decision to turn against the government of Dr. Mohammad Mossadegh, who was at this time the prime minister and leader of Iran. Premier Mossadegh had led the movement to nationalize the oil industry (bringing it under the control of the National Iranian Oil Company or NIOC) in 1951. Since that time, he had taken measures to democratize Iran and bring about modest reforms in administrative areas, in the military and in the conduct of elections. However, Baghai argued that Mossadegh was showing excessive tolerance towards the communists and that his policies were too collectivistic in nature. He then split off from the National Front of Iran (an umbrella group of parties who all supported Prime Minister Mossadegh). Because of this, the Toilers Party split into two factions, with one side joining with Baghai in opposing Mossadegh and the other joining with Khalil Maleki in his support for Mossadegh's policies. This latter group became known as the Third Force and it was the dominant left-wing element in the National Front. On 19 August 1953, the pro-Shah elements in the Iranian military replaced Mossadegh with an autocratic monarchy led by the reigning king, Mohammad Reza Shah. Khalil Maleki, along with other nationalists, strongly opposed the new, despotic and pro-West regime and he continued his political activity throughout the 1950s and 1960s. But in the early 1960s, during the formation of the Second National Front, he was prohibited from joining that group due to the strong resistance he encountered from Shapour Bakhtiar and Mohammad Ali Khonji. Nevertheless, he joined with the Third National Front and remained politically active until his death in 1969. Maleki was a Marxist, and, as noted, a former Communist. He was one of the first, if not the first, world Communist leader to reject Stalin's leadership after World War II. Instead, throughout the 1950s and 1960s, he identified with democratic socialism, and the non-aligned movement. Third Force party offices prominently displayed a picture of Jawaharlal Nehru, with whom Maleki identified politically. Maleki hoped for peaceful change through elections in Iran, but the Shah's repression in the late 1960s doomed those hopes.https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2012/04/homa- katouzian-on-khalil-maleki-part-1-nonalignment-and-the-third-force.html  References  *Homa Katouzian, Khalil Maleki: The human face of Iranian socialism, 2018, Oneworld publications External links * Article about Khalil Maleki on IranianNationalFront *Article on Iranian.com Other sources *Siavoshi, Sussan, Liberal Nationalism in Iran: The Failure of a Movement, Westview Press, March 1990. 1901 births 1969 deaths Anglo-Persian Oil Company National Front (Iran) politicians Iranian Azerbaijani politicians Iranian nationalists People from Tabriz Toilers Party of the Iranian Nation politicians Third Force (Iran) politicians League of Iranian Socialists politicians Tudeh Party of Iran politicians ","title":"Khalil Maleki"},{"id":"13273588","text":"Yellowstone is a 1936 American crime film set in Yellowstone National Park, directed by Arthur Lubin and released by Universal Studios.Yellowstone Monthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 3, Iss. 25, (Jan 1, 1936): 178.

D. Souther (Longbranch Pennywhistle, noted songwriter for Linda Ronstadt and the Eagles). The band recorded two albums during the 1970s before breaking up due to disagreements between the members. History The band was formed in 1973 at the suggestion of David Geffen, then head of Asylum Records. Hillman brought three other former members of Manassas to the group: keyboardist/flutist Paul Harris and percussionist Joe Lala, both of whom had also worked with Barnstorm; and pedal steel guitarist Al Perkins, who had also played with the Flying Burrito Brothers. The septet was rounded out by Jim Gordon, a noted session drummer and former member of Derek and the Dominos and Traffic. The band had a substantial hit in 1974 with its self-titled first album, which was certified gold, and the single \\"Fallin' in Love\\" (US #27). However, during the recording of that album, and influenced by Perkins, Furay converted to evangelical Christianity.Richie Furay's home page Tensions among the members increased, and Gordon, who may have been experiencing the onset of schizophrenia, left the band and was replaced by Ron Grinel.

He is mostly known as author of two memoirs, The Oath: A Surgeon Under Fire and Grief of My Heart: Memoirs of a Chechen Surgeon. Early life and education Khassan Baiev was born as a fraternal twin in Alkhan-Kala, a suburb of Grozny, in April 1963. His father, an herbalist by profession, served in the Soviet Red Army and was wounded during World War II, but was deported to Kazakhstan as a result of the forced deportations of most Chechens to Central Asia in February 1944. Baiev's parents would return in 1959 after Nikita Khrushchev allowed for the Chechens to return home during the de- Stalinization campaign. Plagued by frailty and illness growing up, Baiev took up martial arts to overcome his physical weaknesses ‚Äì by late adolescence he was a black belt judoka who won national competitions and faced a promising career as a coach in the sports-oriented Soviet Union. However, Baiev desired to become a doctor, as his sisters were nurses and his father a herbalist, and in his words, \\"I always wanted to do something that would be of service to society.\\" Baiev was accepted to the Krasnoyarsk Medical Institute in Siberia in 1980 and specialized in maxillofacial surgery. Career In 1985, Baiev graduated from medical school and started his specialist training. He returned to Chechnya in 1988 and became a successful plastic surgeon; and, in the early 1990s, he went to Moscow for additional training. He has said of his practice in Moscow: > In Moscow, 75% of my patients were people who wanted facelifts and tummy > tucks, while 25% were accident victims. People came from abroad--Sweden, > Germany, Switzerland--for plastic surgery because we were offering such > operations at a tenth of the cost in their countries. I could have stayed in > Moscow, but by 1994 it was clear that war was going to break out, and I > decided it was my duty to help my fellow Chechens.\\" By 2000, Baiev was the single surgeon for nearly 80,000 residents near Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, and at one point during the conflict he performed 67 amputations and eight brain operations in a 48-hour period. His patients included the rebel leaders Shamil Basayev and Salman Raduyev. Both sides of the conflict saw Baiev's actions of treating the other side as treason and multiple death threats were made against him. Consequently, the human rights organization Physicians for Human Rights sponsored Baiev for political asylum in the United States during the Second Chechen War and Baiev flew to Washington, DC in April 2000. After his family joined him in the U.S. ten months later, Baiev and his family have been living in Needham, Massachusetts. As of 2008, Dr. Khassan has been treating pediatric patients in Grozny, especially in deformations of the face and amputated limbs.

In it was an accelerator of the brand \\"U-150\\", specially built at the Izhorskiye Zavody for the Chinese (150 - is the diameter of the magnet poles in cm), the cyclotron, the deuteron has the energy of 18 MeV. The following year, the organization in the city of Rez (Czechoslovakia) is building \\"VVR-S\\", a research reactor (4 MW). In the Institute for Nuclear Research at Dresden, East Germany in 1960 it building a full range of physical and chemical laboratory, the cyclotron \\"U-120\\" research reactor \\"VVR-S\\" (power of 2 MW). In the same year in Yugoslavia organization (under the \\"Nuclear Research Center\\") built: a major scientific center named. Boris Kidridzha heavy water reactor (capacity up to 10 MW), radiochemical, and various other laboratories. After that, your own research reactor (2 MW) appears and Egypt - in 1961. At the same time near the Sophia, capital of Bulgaria was constructed \\"Institute of Nuclear Physics\\", which included were: Experimental Reactor type \\"IRT\\" and the radiochemical laboratory. And in 1962 \\"Institute for Nuclear Research\\" (with 2MW experimental reactors \\"VVR-S\\") appear in the Hungarian People's Republic and the Socialist Republic of Romania, respectively, in the cities of Debrecen and in Bucharest. =Recent period= The Russian nuclear vendor is building the first reactor power unit in Iranian Bushehr nuclear power plant located southwest of Tehran under a US$1 billion contract signed in 1995. In 2007, AtomStroyExport signed a memorandum of understanding with Ciner Insaat Ticaret ve Sanayi to promote its VVER-design pressurized water reactors in Turkey. In Bangladesh, proposals have been prepared to resurrect the potential Rooppur nuclear power plant. In the UK, Atomstroyexport would consider partnering with a Western manufacturer for a new UK builder. In Morocco, Atomstroyexport is considering participation in construction of a nuclear power plant at Sidi Boulbra. In late October 2006, the offer of Atomstroyexport for construction of the Belene Nuclear Power Plant in Bulgaria, using third-generation VVER-1000/V-446B reactors, was approved. The first unit would be in operation by 2013 and the second a year later. On 28 March 2012 the Bulgarian government announced the withdrawal from the Belene project due to a negative report regarding the viability of the future power plant and the lack of another major European or American investor. Between 1999 and 2007, Atomstroyexport constructed the Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant in China, which consists of two VVER reactors with 1,060 MW each, and has signed an agreement for construction of units 3 and 4. Unit 5 to 8 are firmly planned. On 19 February 2008, Atomstroyexport signed a cooperation agreement with Technopromexport, a Russian exporter of other large-scale power generation types, on the construction and management of power projects in Russia and abroad. On 14 December 2009, Atomstroyexport bought Nukem Technologies for 23.5 million Euros, adding nuclear power plant decommissioning, waste management and engineering services to its portfolio. Atomstroyexport will build 4 reactors in Ninh Thu·∫≠n, Vietnam. The reactors are slated to open one each year from 2021-4\\\\. An 8 billion US$ loan has been extended by the Russian state. Other projects include Akkuyu NPP, Hanhikivi NPP, Koodankulam NPP and Mochovce NPP. See also VVER#Power plants.

The intake and exhaust flows are controlled by simple ports in the cylinder heads. Costs are further reduced because all cylinders at each end of the engine share a common fuel injector and/or spark plug. Additionally, the designs are typically compact and lightweight. Description Most revolving cylinder, axial piston engine designs utilize a fixed, multi-lobed barrel-type cam and rollers on the pistons to control the reciprocating movement of the pistons. The benefit of this approach, versus a conventional crankshaft-and-connecting-rod mechanism, is that the kinematics of the piston motion can be optimized with regards to combustion cycle efficiency. The primary drawback to the revolving cylinder, axial piston engine design is that rotating piston assemblies are subjected to centrifugal forces, which can result in significant friction losses. These centrifugal forces increase at the square of the angular velocity. So unless the engine is run at very low rotational speeds, the friction losses due to centrifugal forces acting on the piston assemblies can quickly become unacceptable. Limited acceptance To date, commercial or military acceptance of this design is limited to torpedo propulsion systems in current use (2009) by the United States Navy's mk 46 series and mk 48 series engines which use a derivative of the original Gould swashplate engine which was developed in the early 1960s for torpedo propulsion. Problems associated with the design of the axial piston engine include high oil consumption, high fuel consumption, low rpm limit imposed by previously discussed frictional loads, low overall horsepower, mechanical complexity and complex machining methods needs to allow the engine to stand up to the loads imposed on the components. Additional problems are noted in that, the design does not have a long lifespan when compared to other engine designs due to large numbers of moving parts and relative high stresses. Wear and tear occurs at a faster rate because the engine makes more power pulses per turn of the cam than traditional engines. Lastly, due to very high initial torque and a need for large amounts of coolant, loss of oil or coolant to this design during running will almost certainly result in a catastrophic explosion of the engine because the engine generally has very light casings or shields located in the area around the cams and connecting rods. The benefits of the design include relatively very high initial torque when compared to other engines, very compact design, able to be made to run on a variety of fuels from gasoline, diesel, kerosene, alcohol, to more exotic/energetic mixtures such as Otto Fuel, hydrogen peroxide/fuel mixes.

It also has specialized programs for adolescents and young adults. Health care professionals such as physiotherapists and physiatrists deliver individually tailored treatment for people with the most serious and complex injuries and illnesses requiring rehabilitation.http://www.vch.ca/gfstrong History Following World War II, there was a large influx of soldiers returning to Canada with permanent disabilities, and there was no facility located in British Columbia to accommodate their needs. Dr. George Frederick Strong was a strong advocate for the building of a rehabilitation centre in BC after his daughter sustained a spinal cord injury. Dr. Strong joined with the Western Division of the Paraplegic Association to realise his dream. GF Strong Rehabilitation Centre opened in 1949, and has since grown in size and scope, treating patients from through BC and the Yukon. Patient services =Acquired brain injuries= Provides in and outpatient services, and community support to adult patients who have sustained a brain injury. =Spinal cord injury= The program has a 29-bed inpatient program, as well as outpatient support for people living in the community. The program encourages patients to realize their abilities and set goals towards rehabilitation. =Arthritis= This program is offered for patients who have been diagnosed with systemic inflammatory rheumatic diseases and/or associated reconstructive surgery. 55% of patients enter the program following reconstructive surgery. Patients are treated by interdisciplinary teams of rheumatologists, nurses, physical and occupational therapists, and social workers. To be admitted to the program patients must *Have a diagnosis of rheumatic disease or related reconstructive surgery *Be medically stable *Have sufficient cognition, motivation and endurance adequate to benefit from active rehabilitation *Have goals for rehabilitation *Be over 16 years of age. =Neuromusculoskeletal= The neuromusculoskeletal program offers treatment to patients suffering from Neuromuscular Disease, Polio, Burns, Complex Trauma, Multiple Sclerosis, Cerebral Palsy, Cancer, Amputation and Neurodegenerative Diseases. A team put together to treat patients in this program may include Occupational Therapists, Physiatrists, Physiotherapists, Social Workers and Speech Language Pathologists depending on the patients needs.

History  Phrateres was founded at UCLA in 1924 by the dean of women, Helen Matthewson Laughlin.Dean of Women at UCLA from 1919 to 1946. UCLA obituary, including mention of Phrateres. The intention was to bring \\"independent\\" women students (i.e. those not in dormitories or sororities) into a collective group for the purposes of socialization and philanthropy. However, the new group proved popular and soon membership was extended to any female student who wished to join. Members now included those who lived in dorms, commuted to campus, as well as members of sororities. Word spread to other colleges, especially those on the West Coast. The Beta Chapter was installed at the University of Washington in 1929. The 1930s saw the installation of ten more chapters: GammaOregon State University Archives & Delta in 1930, Epsilon in 1931, Zeta in 1932, Eta in 1933, Theta & Iota in 1935, Kappa in 1936, Lambda in 1937, and Nu in 1939. Phrateres now had chapters in seven states and one province in Canada (Theta at the University of British Columbia would remain the only Canadian chapter from 1935 to 1961). The 1940s brought four more chapters: Xi : \\"1941 ~ Rho Phi Sigma, a local women's social organization, becomes affiliated with the Xi chapter of Phrateres\\" & Omicron in 1941, Rho in 1942, and Sigma in 1945, for a total of sixteen active collegiate chapters (the most ever at one time). However, from 1945 until the late 1950s, three of those chapters closed: Delta, Eta, and Omicron. Their chapter names were later reused for newly installed chapters at different schools in 1950 (Delta), 1958 (Eta ), and 1964 (Omicron). Along with those, the final four chapters were installed in the 1960s, including three more in Canada: Omega: \\"...Saturday, October 21, Omega Chapter of Phrateres will be installed in a formal candlelit ceremony. Eleven executive members of the Theta Chapter at U.B.C. will help...\\" in 1961, TauSimon Fraser University Archives in 1966, Phi in the mid to late 1960s, and Psi in 1967. From the 1930s to the 1990s, conventions were held every one to two years, with members of the host chapter housing delegates from other chapters. Chapters could win awards, such as \\"Most Active Chapter\\" and \\"Best Scrapbook.\\" The earliest known date of a chapter closing was the first Omicron in 1945Augustana College Archives Only one other chapter closing is known with certainty: Lambda in 2000.

Unfortunately, for five chapters, the closing year is unknown due to an almost total lack of documentation. The first Delta chapter was closed by 1950, when the second one was installed. As for the second Delta, Nu, the second Omicron, and Phi, the only chapter records are those of installations (but it is known that none of them were active as of 1990).Theta Chapter newsletters, early 1990s In the 1990s, only three active collegiate chapters remained: Theta, Lambda, and the second Eta (the former in Canada; the latter two in Arizona, both of which were co-ed by this time ). Eta closed during that decade and Lambda closed in 2000. Now, the only active collegiate chapter was Theta at the University of British Columbia (UBC). The Phrateres International Board saw little purpose to its own existence (being that only one active chapter remained) and disbanded in 2001. As of 2015, the Theta Chapter still exists at UBC in the form of a self-governing AMS (Alma Mater Society, UBC's student society) club. = 2009‚Äì10: anniversary year = The 2009‚Äì10 school year marked two important milestones for the Phrateres organization: the 85th anniversary of the founding of Phrateres at UCLA and the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Theta Chapter at UBC. The Theta Chapter organized a celebration that was held in 2010, which featured a wide range of Phrateres sisters whose ages ranged from over 70 years, to 19. This event marked how important this organization was, and continues to be in the development of the individual, as well as fostering lifelong friendships, sisterhood, and memories. = History project = The Theta Chapter is currently compiling a more thorough history of Phrateres. The chapter is seeking out alumnae members of any chapter who can provide information, including, but not limited to, oral history or memories, yearbooks, manuals, photos, chapter newsletters, student newspaper articles, anything from or about Phrateres International, etc. The basic goal is to compile a complete listing of all the chapters that ever existed, including founding and closing dates, and histories of each individual chapter. As is apparent above, current historical knowledge is limited. Sources thus far have been Theta Chapter yearbooks and newsletters in the UBC archives, information available on the internet through online search engines, and Theta Chapter alumnae.  Phrateres International  The International consisted of the board of trustees: Phrateres alumnae living in the Greater Los Angeles area. It collected fees from each chapter, as well as published a regular newsletter, The Phraterean, with notices from each chapter. The Lura Heeter Award was a scholarship given to one collegiate member each year (began as a memorial award within the Zeta Chapter in 1985). When the board disbanded in 2001, it gave its remaining funds to the Theta Chapter. Monies from the Lura Heeter Award were given to the Zeta Alumnae Chapter. The board was led by a Grand President: * Helen Matthewson Laughlin, 1924‚Äì1957 * Marjorie Chilstrom,As of 2008 California State University, Northridge offers a scholarship offered in the name of Irving & Marjorie Chilstrom. 1957‚Äì1972, officially retired in 1972 but remained grand president until Phrateres International disbanded when the Lambda (University of Arizona) chapter closed * Cynthia Johnson, co-chairman of board of trustees with Lynne Love, 1973‚Äì1976 * Lynne Love, chairman of board of trustees, 1976-?

Twenty-three were in the United States, with Colorado, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Wisconsin, Utah, and Ohio each having one chapter; Arizona having three, Illinois, and Washington each having two; and the remaining nine all in California (three of which were in Los Angeles alone). The remaining four were in Canada, with one in Ontario and three in British Columbia, including Theta, the sole remaining active chapter. = Nomenclature = Chapters were named in the order of the Greek alphabet. No records have been found for Mu, Pi, Upsilon, or Chi chapters, although the fact that three other letters were used twice supports their possible existence. The two Arizona chapters (Lambda at University of Arizona and Eta at Arizona State University) referred to themselves, respectively, as \\"Phi Lambda Phrateres\\" and \\"Phi Eta Phrateres.\\" The Theta chapter at UBC has records of being called \\"Phi Theta\\" but this practice has been discontinued.  Alumnae chapters  The collegiate Theta Chapter hosts an annual \\"Alumnae Tea\\" each February (celebrating date of installation at UBC). Theta alumnae, some of whom are from the established Theta Alumnae Chapter, are always present. The collegiate Theta Chapter is interested in hearing from any other Alumnae or Alumnae Chapters in existence. Despite the short life of the collegiate Zeta Chapter at Carroll College, a strong Alumnae Chapter grew and is still in existence.  Theta Chapter  = 70+ years = In 2006, Theta celebrated 70 years of Phrateres at UBC with a gala celebration. Contacting alumnae proved difficult, unfortunately. Many members had married and taken new names. As well, records often only included the street address of the woman while she had been a student, providing no current mailing address or email address. Collegiate and alumnae members of the Theta Chapter were joined by spouses, parents, and a Rho Chapter alumnae, who had never been to Canada before. = History = The only remaining active chapter was often the largest during the heyday of Phrateres. In the mid-1930s, Clare BrownOften inaccurately referred to as \\"Clare Brown Harris\\" (her married name). A second marriage, to A. C. Buckland, occurred in 1963 and is listed in .

Student Services - Access & Diversity - Women to bring Phrateres to UBC. The Theta Chapter was installed on February 1, 1935. It was the eighth chapter installed, but the first Canadian chapter. From installation until the 1970s, membership was large enough to support as many as 12 Sub-Chapters. Each Sub-Chapter had its own president and council, with all Sub-Chapters falling under the control of an executive council comprising the Rho Sub-Chapter. Each Sub-Chapter also had a faculty advisor and recruited members separately. This promoted friendly competition between the Sub-Chapters. In those earlier decades, students at UBC had to wait until their sophomore year to join fraternities and sororities. Freshman female students were required to join Phrateres if they wanted to join a sorority later. After that first year, members either decided to stay solely in Phrateres, leave Phrateres for a sorority, or maintain membership in both. When the policy changed, and freshmen were allowed to rush, the Theta Chapter experienced a dramatic decline in membership (since the 1980s, membership has not exceeded 100). From that point onwards, Phrateres at UBC was no longer seen as an organization to unify all women students, as had been the vision of Dean Laughlin at UCLA in 1924. Sub- chapters eventually ceased and the club presently operates as one unified chapter. = 4 S's = Phrateres' activities are based on the 4S's: Sisterhood, Sports, Social, and Service. At Theta Chapter, sisterhood is encouraged by matching pledges with active members in the \\"Big/Little Sister Program\\", through nights out and nights in, and through study table sessions. Members often participate in UBC sports events and support the UBC Thunderbirds. Social activities include fraternity exchanges and the annual formals and semi-formals. = Philanthropy = The Theta Chapter organizes and participates in various philanthropic events throughout the year. Having no official charity, the club helps a variety of organizations. Annual events include: * Terry Fox Run: each September the chapter organizes a Terry Fox Run on the westside of Vancouver. The current route takes participants through the Pacific Spirit Park. The 2005 Run commemorated the 25th anniversary of the Marathon of Hope. That year, the local run organized by Phrateres raised $26,000. * Show of Hearts Telethon: each February the Theta Chapter volunteers time to answer phones during the Show of Hearts Telethon. The telethon is a fundraiser for Variety - The Children's Charity. Members usually take shifts from midnight to 4 am and/or 4 am to 8 am. * 24 Hour Relay: each June the Theta Chapter participates in the 24 Hour Relay. This event is organized by the B.C. Lions Society for Children with Disabilities, a group under the umbrella of Easter Seals. Teams camp at Burnaby's Central Park and send runners and walkers on a 4 km route through the park, starting and ending in Swangard Stadium. In the 2008 relay, held June 14-15th, the Theta Chapter fundraised $2,688.83 and the entire relay raised $1,315,304. All funds raised help send disabled children to specially equipped summer camps in British Columbia. * Phrateres Party: during the second term of the school year, the chapter hosts a party, benefiting a different organization each year. It is a costume party, and the theme since 2004 has been a Flintstones/general caveman medley, under the name \\"Bedrock\\". Until 2008, the party was held at a fraternity house on campus (most recently, Psi Upsilon and Delta Kappa Epsilon), with that fraternity and the Theta Chapter splitting the proceeds. In 2008, the Theta chapter opted to host the party themselves at the Pit Pub in the Student Union Building. The 2008 party proceeds went to Right to Play. Previous to the \\"Bedrock\\" theme, the party was held annually under the \\"Boxer Bash\\" name. * Express Yourself Fashion Shows: In 2013, the Theta chapter began partnering with the Battered Women's Support Services and their social enterprise, My Sister's Closet, and the AMS Sexual Assault Support Centre (SASC) to organize and host two fashion shows to promote and raise money for the educational, advocacy, and legal services of the two organizations.  Pledgeship  All women are encouraged and welcomed to join the organization. Pledgeship involves a year where members get to participate in the organization's events and get to know what the girls and organization are about. Pledges often form strong bonds with their pledge classes and enjoy this period of flexible fun. Pledges will also have the opportunity to take on leadership roles by running to become their Pledge President, and organizing a pledge project together.

One of Champaigne's most accomplished works, it is a votive offering (an ex-voto) by the painter which depicts a miracle involving his daughter that is said to have occurred at the Port-Royal-des-Champs Cistercian convent. A ray of light illuminates Mother-Superior Agn√®s Arnauld, who experienced on the ninth day of her novena for Champaigne's daughter, Sister Catherine de Sainte Suzanne, the hope that a cure would come for Sister Catherine. Catherine (seated, praying) was the painter's only surviving child, and had been suffering from a paralyzing illness. Until that point, prayer and medical treatments (\\"potions, baths, unctions, and thirty bleedings\\") had proven futile. After the Mother-Superior's novena, Sister Catherine soon attempted to walk, and found herself increasingly mobile; the illness no longer seemed present. The painting is a statement of gratitude by the father for the cure of his daughter. The miracle it portrays also symbolized hope for the cause of the Jansenists, who were subject to persecution by ecclesiastical and civil authorities. The Jansenists followed Cornelius Jansen, who reasserted the theology of St. Augustine, and were in conflict with the Jesuits. Their refusal to sign a document condemning five propositions found in Jansen's Augustinus resulted in their being deprived of the sacraments and confined to the abbey, which was eventually torn down. The composition is unique among Champaigne's work, with the two figures having richly defined, \\"sculptural\\" forms, lending them vitality and setting them off from the restricted hues and \\"angular simplicity\\" of the setting (Rand 1990). The figures dominate the canvas, giving the painting a monumental quality. The texture, weight, and folds of the robes are modeled in great detail, revealing Champaigne's Flemish training. His decision to portray the moment that Mother- Superior Agn√®s is instilled with hope, rather than the cure itself, is evident in the fact that the ray of light illuminates her instead of his daughter. The light develops a \\"chronological tension\\" that suggests \\"what will happen as a result of what is happening\\" (Rand 1983). The painting includes a Latin inscription on the wall on the left of the painting. Neither the text nor the lettering were Champaigne's work. The inscription, addressed to Christ, recounts that Sister Catherine suffered for 14 months from a high fever and that half her body was paralyzed; that she prayed with Mother Agn√®s and her health was restored, and again she offered herself to Christ; and that Champaigne offers the painting as a testament to this miracle and to express his joy.

The highway follows the route of the Old Spanish Trail.Official Highway Map, Utah Department of Transportation, 1995 edition, coordinates I-3 Route description View east from the west end of SR-20 Midway along Utah State Route 20 SR-20 begins at I-15, Exit 95, north of Paragonah, and heads east and southeast through a pass between the Markagunt Plateau and the Tushar Mountains. It ends at an intersection with US-89 at Bear Valley Junction. Trucks are routed from I-15 and US-89 onto SR-20 in preference to SR-9 and SR-14 to avoid steep grades and switchbacks required to cross the Markagunt Plateau. Because of this, SR-20 is included in the National Highway System. SR-20 itself is a difficult route, featuring 7% grades on the approaches to the summit, and oversize vehicles are required to have a pilot escort. History The route of SR-20 was first used by non- Native Americans in 1864, by the settlers of Panguitch. It crosses the Tushar Mountains just south of the Old Spanish Trail's crossing. The road from SR-1 (by 1926 US-91, now SR-271) in Paragonah to SR-11 (by 1926 US-89) at Bear Valley Junction was added to the state highway system in 1917.Utah Department of Transportation, State Route History , accessed July 2007 In 1927, the legislature assigned the State Route 20 designation to it, and in 1953 the west end was moved north to the present junction with I-15, removing Little Creek Canyon Road and Upper Bear Valley Road from the state highway system.

Depending on the particular certification, qualifications may include completing a course of study, proof of professional accomplishments, achieving a specified grade on an examination. The intention is to establish that an individual holding a certification is technically qualified to hold certain types of position within the field. Certifications, generally, need to be renewed periodically, or may be valid for a specific period (e.g. the lifetime of the product upon which the individual is certified). As a part of a complete renewal of an individual's certification, it is common for the individual to show evidence of continual learning ‚Äî often termed continuing education ‚Äî or earning continuing education units (CEU). Certification is often used in the professions of information technology industry. Some certification programs are oriented toward specific technologies, and are managed by the vendors of these technologies. These certification programs are tailored to the institutions that would employ people who use these technologies.  General certification  General certification of software practitioners has struggled. The ACM had a professional certification program in the early 1980s, which was discontinued due to lack of interest. Today, the IEEE is certifying software professionals, but only about 500 people have passed the exam . * The IEEE Computer Society sponsors the Certified Software Development Professional as well as membership designations, \\"Senior\\" and \\"Fellow\\" which reflect experience and peer review qualification. * The IET sponsors the Chartered Engineer and Incorporated Engineer, which can be ratified into the European Engineer * The BCS sponsors the Chartered IT Professional (CITP) programme. * The Institute for Certification of Computing Professionals sponsors the Certified Computing Professional (CCP) and Associate Computing Professional (ACP) certifications * The BDPA IT Institute sponsors the BDPA IT Associate (BITA), the BDPA IT Professional (BITP), and the BDPA IT Master (BITM) certifications * The Canadian Information Processing Society sponsors the Information Systems Professional (ISP) and Information Technology Certified Professional (ITCP) in Canada. * The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants sponsors the Certified Information Technology Professional program. * APICS establishes operations management standards and sponsors certification for Logistics * The New Zealand Computer Society sponsors the Information Technology Certified ProfessionalITCP programme * The Australian Computer Society offers pathways to Certified Professional (CP) and Certified Technologist (CT) designation. * The Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists sponsors the Certified Engineering Technologist or Professional Technologist Information Technology or Electronics (Computer) Technology profiles. =Information systems security= In an information systems environment that requires formal security accreditation, Certification refers to the comprehensive evaluation of the technical and non-technical security features of an information system. Certification is formally defined by Krutz and Vines as: =Software testing= * British Computer Society * National Software Testing Laboratories * American Society for Quality#Certifications * International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB) * CSTE Criticisms The current proliferation of IT certifications (both offered and attained) has led some technologists to question their value. Advanced training content that has been distributed on the Internet allows some to gain credentials without the implied depth or breadth of expertise beyond the certification material. Certifying agencies have responded in various ways: some now incorporate hands-on elements, anti- cheating methodologies or have expanded their content. Others have expired and restructured their certificate programs, and/or raised their fees to deter abuse. Education Research on college students and high school students has been done to determine whether relevant Information Technology industry certification is an asset to the teaching profession as they appear to be in the business world. The studies investigated CIS/IT student perceptions and outcomes of certified and non-certified instructors. As observed by Adelman, many post-secondary CIS/IT faculty were unconcerned about the emergence in the 1990s of ‚Äúa new, parallel universe of postsecondary credentials‚Äù, Anderson and Reimers found that CIS/IT students were keenly aware if their instructors had them. For example, certain certifications DOD 8570.1M are the only commercial certifications that the Department of Defense will accept towards meeting their Information Assurance hiring requirements. The studies found a significant difference in learning outcomes between technology courses taught by certified and non-certified instructors; students whose instructors held IT industry certifications had higher levels of achievement than their non- certified peers and that college undergraduate students showed a significantly greater perception of their instructor‚Äôs effectiveness, teaching skills, professor technical expertise, and their own engagement in their classes with certified professors. Randall & Zirrkle (2005) noted a distinction between high school students and college students result benefit and the type of certification (vendor neutral and vendor-specific). IT Certifications are considered as a standard of IT knowledge by most of the giant technology companies around the world. Best knowledge of up to date technologies is ensured by continuously updating the versions of certifications by the specific vendors.Hunsinger, S. & Smith, M.(2008) Factors that Influence Information Systems. Journal of Information Technology Education Undergraduates to Pursue IT Certification  DoD Directive 8570.1 and DoD Directive 8140  The U.S. Department of Defense Directive 8570.1, signed in August 2004, requires every full- and part-time military service member, defense contractor, civilian and foreign employee with privileged access to a DoD system, regardless of job series or occupational specialty, to obtain a commercial certification credential that has been accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). 8570.1 established certification requirements in 3 levels: Level I, II, and III was categorized into IAM - Information Assurance Management and IAT - Information Assurance Technician. Since its implementation the IT enterprise landscape has changed dramatically with the implementation of mobility, cloud computing, and cybersecurity areas of increased emphasis. As a result, the NICE - National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education was established to form the NICCS portal - National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies. This initiative was a public/private collaboration and resulted in the publishing of The Framework 1.0. Since the initial framework has established it has been enhanced and published as The Framework 2.0 and has morphed into the DoD 8140 Directive which is anticipated to be in full implementation by December 2015. This framework breaks down into seven (7) categories and establishes 31 KSA's (Key Specialty Areas), which fundamentally are silos within the IT landscape.

History  For much of its route, the Downs Link follows the course of two dismantled railways - the Cranleigh Line and the Steyning Line - both of which closed in the 1960s as a result of the Beeching Axe. Between 1965 and 1970 the track was lifted and much of the track ballast was removed. The coppiced woodland along many of the cuttings and embankment sides remained unmanaged until 2 April 1970 when ownership of much of the track was sold by the British Railways Board to Surrey County Council and Hambleton Rural District Council (which became Waverley Borough Council in 1974) for ¬£17,500. The local authorities managed the land until 1984, clearing scrub to allow the general public to use it as a recreational facility. In 1984, the local authorities working together with other authorities and the Manpower Services Commission established the Downs Link, a long footpath and bridleway connecting the North and South Downs National Trails. The Link was opened on 9 July 1984 by the Mayor of Waverley, Anne Hoath, at Baynard's station; it subsequently received a commendation in the National Conservation Award Scheme jointly organised by The Times newspaper and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.The Times, \\"'Industry should copy example of the trail-setters'; Councils capture conservation awards\\", 8 October 1985.  Status  The Downs Link is not a National Trail within the meaning of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, but a trail of regional importance supported by three local authorities - Surrey County Council, West Sussex County Council and Waverley Borough Council. Former missing sections =Christ's Hospital to Slinfold= For many years, the route of the Link deviated from the original railway alignment between Slinfold and Christ's Hospital, near Horsham, where a section of the old line had been sold to an adjacent landowner. Attempts to establish a right of way across this section were resisted by the owner, resulting in the re-routing of the Link via Mill Lane, Itchingfield. The \\"Missing Link\\" campaign began in 1999 to create a green corridor as a safer alternative to the hazardous stretch of road. In 2011, Christ's Hospital purchased a section of the old line from Christ's Hospital station to the A264 Five Oaks Road near Slinfold. Works were carried out to repair two bridges, clear vegetation, provide a hard surface and drainage and repair the disused platform at Christ's Hospital station. An official ceremony took place on 11 September 2020 to mark the opening of the new section. Following the works during the winter of 2019/2020, the new section opened in April 2020, allowing off-road route access from the former Cranleigh/Guildford platform to Station Road to the east of the station via a winding path which passes beneath the Arun Valley Line. In July 2020, the local signposts at Baystone Bridge, at the western end of the new alignment, had not been changed to update the route to include this section but were still directing Downslink users onto the road. =Others= Another missing section in the Downs Link was filled in April 2007 with the granting of a new right of way from Baystone Bridge, along the route of the old railway line, to a point near Christ's Hospital station. During the winter of 2019/2020, an improved alignment was created in Southwater to the west of Worthing Road as part of the construction of the Broadacres housing estate. The works involved a better delineation of the Link combined with improved drainage, landscaping and surfacing improvements.

The separation facilities at Rafnes and the installations downstream the reduction stations in Sweden and Denmark were not part of the project. The originally planned capacity of the pipeline was 6 billion cubic meter (bcm) of natural gas per year. The plans were upgraded to 7 bcm. The likelihood of greater future demand from Denmark and Poland, which plan to connect Skanled through Denmark with other planned pipeline, the Baltic Pipe between Denmark and Poland, may lead to widen the diameter of the pipe from the initial design. The pipeline was to be operational by October 2012. It was designed for 50 years of operation. It expected to cost 10 billion Norwegian kroner. Suspension The final investment decision depended on decisions by Yara International and Ineos, major potential consumers of gas provided by Skanled. In April 2009, the Skanled Project Group announced that they had decided to suspend the project \\"due to increased commercial risk combined with the global economic developments that have given an uncertain view on future gas demand.\\" Contractors The IKM Gruppen was selected for design activities related to the pipeline system with associated subsea structures, landfalls, and receiving and metering stations.

Interest in Gaelic football in North Derry was once again very high after Derry reached the 1958 All-Ireland Senior Championship final. The current club was founded that year and played in red jerseys, with white collars and a green shamrock on the breast. Their first Senior match came was a victory over Glenullin in the 1959 Neal Carlin Cup. 1960 saw Drumsurn win the North Derry Junior Championship for the first time. They went on to play the Derry City Champions Faughanavale in the All-County Junior Championship semi-final at Celtic Park, but were defeated. The club also won the following year's North Derry Junior Championship. In 1965 Drumsurn's Se√°n Moore won an All-Ireland medals with Derry Minors. During this time the club also purchased their current playing field. In 1966 St Matthews's won the Mahon Cup and Neal Carlin Cup with victories over Ardmore and Glenullin respectively. St Matthew's best ever performance in the Derry Senior Football Championship came in 1968 when they reached the semi-final stage. Joe Chivers from the club was part of the 1968 Derry All-Ireland U21 Football Championship winning team. The club added another Neal Carlin Cup success in 1979. In 1980 the club won Division 2 of the league and were narrowly defeated in the Derry Intermediate Football Championship final by Glen. That year the club were awarded an Allied Irish Bank Club of the Year award. Joe Irwin, who had returned to the club from Swatragh in 1978, established himself on the Derry side in the 1980s and won Railway Cup medals with Ulster in 1983 and 1984, captaining Derry in 1984. Drumsurn's greatest success came in 1991 went they won the Derry Intermediate Football Championship against St Martins Desertmartin. Drumsurn's Ciar√°n Mullan was a pillar of the 2002 Derry minor team which won the All-Ireland Minor Championship; notably scoring 1 goal and 5 points in a remarkable 'man of the match' performance in the semi-final against longford. He continues to be one of the most influential members of the club's senior team and is one of the most feared forwards in the intermediate league.

History The oldest HPS school campus, Holbrook Elementary School After Hamtramck became a municipality in 1922, every member of the Hamtramck Board of Education was a Pole and most students of the school system were Polish Catholics. In 1925, of the school district's 7,526 students, about 5,400 were ethnic Polish. Half of the ethnic Polish students were non-US citizens. By the mid-1920s, of the school-attending children in Hamtramck 66% attended public schools.Vinyard, p. 182. The public schools typically had 45 students per classroom while the parochial schools in Hamtramck had 70 students per classroom.Vinyard, p. 183. In the early 1920s the annual growth rate of Hamtramck Public Schools buildings was 27% while non-public schools had an annual growth rate of 6% in that period. In the 1920s the Polish language became a part of the curriculum at Hamtramck Public Schools. In 1925 655 students attended Hamtramck High School. JoEllen McNergney Vinyard, author of For Faith and Fortune: The Education of Catholic Immigrants in Detroit, 1805-1925, wrote that Hamtramck High had \\"substantially more students than were in all of Detroit's Polish Catholic high schools combined.\\" In the 1920s Hamtramck families often sent their children to public school for Kindergarten due to convenience, then moved their children to parochial schools during the periods with the most important religious instruction. Therefore, the age group 7 to 12 had the largest Catholic school enrollment. After the critical period ended, many students returned to public school. In 1925 the public schools had 1,467 students of ages 14‚Äì15 while the non-public schools had 217 students aged 14 and 15. In a period in the 20th Century, 8% of HPS teachers were Polish.Feinstein, p. 238. \\"The proportion of teachers of Polish descent is not so great in Detroit as in Hamtramck, where they constitute more than 8 per cent of the whole number.

It is one of the longest-lasting problems in computer vision because of the complexity of the models that relate observation with pose, and because of the variety of situations in which it would be useful. Description Perception of human beings in their neighboring environment is an important capability that robots must possess. If a person uses gestures to point to a particular object, then the interacting machine should be able to understand the situation in real world context. Thus pose estimation is an important and challenging problem in computer vision, and many algorithms have been deployed in solving this problem over the last two decades. Many solutions involve training complex models with large data sets. Pose estimation is a difficult problem and an active subject of research because the human body has 244 degrees of freedom with 230 joints. Although not all movements between joints are evident, the human body is composed of 10 large parts with 20 degrees of freedom. Algorithms must account for large variability introduced by differences in appearance due to clothing, body shape, size, and hairstyles. Additionally, the results may be ambiguous due to partial occlusions from self-articulation, such as a person's hand covering their face, or occlusions from external objects. Finally, most algorithms estimate pose from monocular (two- dimensional) images, taken from a normal camera. Other issues include varying lighting and camera configurations. The difficulties are compounded if there are additional performance requirements. These images lack the three- dimensional information of an actual body pose, leading to further ambiguities. There is recent work in this area wherein images from RGBD cameras provide information about color and depth.Droeschel, David, and Sven Behnke. \\"3D body pose estimation using an adaptive person model for articulated ICP.\\" Intelligent Robotics and Applications. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2011. 157167. There is a need to develop accurate, tether-less, vision-based articulated body pose estimation systems to recover the pose of bodies, such as the human body, a hand, or non-human creatures. Such a system has several foreseeable applications, including the following: * Markerless motion capture for human-computer interfaces, * Physiotherapy, * Human image synthesis, * Ergonomics studies, * Robot control, and * Visual surveillance. The typical articulated body pose estimation system involves a model-based approach, in which the pose estimation is achieved by maximizing/minimizing a similarity/dissimilarity between an observation (input) and a template model. Different kinds of sensors have been explored for use in making the observation, including the following: * Visible wavelength imagery, * Long- wave thermal infrared imagery, * Time-of-flight imagery, and * Laser range scanner imagery. These sensors produce intermediate representations that are directly used by the model. The representations include the following: * Image appearance, * Voxel (volume element) reconstruction, * 3D point clouds, and sum of Gaussian kernelsM. Ding and G. Fan, \\"Generalized Sum of Gaussians for Real-Time Human Pose Tracking from a Single Depth Sensor\\" 2015 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), Jan 2015 * 3D surface meshes. Part models The basic idea of part based model can be attributed to the human skeleton. Any object having the property of articulation can be broken down into smaller parts wherein each part can take different orientations, resulting in different articulations of the same object. Different scales and orientations of the main object can be articulated to scales and orientations of the corresponding parts. To formulate the model so that it can be represented in mathematical terms, the parts are connected to each other using springs. As such, the model is also known as a spring model. The degree of closeness between each part is accounted for by the compression and expansion of the springs. There is geometric constraint on the orientation of springs. For example, limbs of legs cannot move 360 degrees. Hence parts cannot have that extreme orientation. This reduces the possible permutations.Fischler, Martin A., and Robert A. Elschlager. \\"The representation and matching of pictorial structures.\\" IEEE Transactions on computers 1 (1973): 6792. The spring model forms a graph G(V,E) where V (nodes) corresponds to the parts and E (edges) represents springs connecting two neighboring parts. Each location in the image can be reached by the x and y coordinates of the pixel location. Let \\\\mathbf{p}_{i}(x, \\\\, y) be point at \\\\mathbf{i}^{th} location. Then the cost associated in joining the spring between \\\\mathbf{i}^{th} and the \\\\mathbf{j}^{th} point can be given by S(\\\\mathbf{p}_{i},\\\\,\\\\mathbf{p}_{j}) = S(\\\\mathbf{p}_{i} - \\\\mathbf{p}_{j}). Hence the total cost associated in placing l components at locations \\\\mathbf{P}_{l} is given by : S(\\\\mathbf{P}_{l}) = \\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{i=1}^{l} \\\\; \\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{j=1}^{i} \\\\; \\\\mathbf{s}_{ij}(\\\\mathbf{p}_{i},\\\\,\\\\mathbf{p}_{j}) The above equation simply represents the spring model used to describe body pose. To estimate pose from images, cost or energy function must be minimized. This energy function consists of two terms. The first is related to how each component matches the image data and the second deals with how much the oriented (deformed) parts match, thus accounting for articulation along with object detection.Felzenszwalb, Pedro F., and Daniel P. Huttenlocher. \\"Pictorial structures for object recognition.\\" International Journal of Computer Vision 61.1 (2005): 5579. The part models, also known as pictorial structures, are of one the basic models on which other efficient models are built by slight modification. One such example is the flexible mixture model which reduces the database of hundreds or thousands of deformed parts by exploiting the notion of local rigidity.Yang, Yi, and Deva Ramanan. \\"Articulated pose estimation with flexible mixtures-of-parts.\\" Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2011 IEEE Conference on. IEEE, 2011. Articulated model with quaternion  The kinematic skeleton is constructed by a tree-structured chain, as illustrated in the Figure.M. Ding and G. Fan, \\"Articulated and Generalized Gaussian Kernel Correlation for Human Pose Estimation\\" IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, Vol. 25, No. 2, Feb 2016 Each rigid body segment has its local coordinate system that can be transformed to the world coordinate system via a 4√ó4 transformation matrix T_l , : T_{l} = T_{\\\\operatorname{par}(l)}R_{l}, where R_l denotes the local transformation from body segment S_l to its parent \\\\operatorname{par}(S_l). Each joint in the body has 3 degrees of freedom (DoF) rotation. Given a transformation matrix T_l , the joint position at the T-pose can be transferred to its corresponding position in the world coordination. In many works, the 3D joint rotation is expressed as a normalized quaternion [x,y,z,w] due to its continuity that can facilitate gradient-based optimization in the parameter estimation. Applications =Assisted living= Personal care robots may be deployed in future assisted living homes. For these robots, high-accuracy human detection and pose estimation is necessary to perform a variety of tasks, such as fall detection. Additionally, this application has a number of performance constraints. =Character animation= Traditionally, character animation has been a manual process. However, poses can be synced directly to a real-life actor through specialized pose estimation systems. Older systems relied on markers or specialized suits. Recent advances in pose estimation and motion capture have enabled markerless applications, sometimes in real time. =Intelligent driver assisting system= Car accidents account for about two percent of deaths globally each year. As such, an intelligent system tracking driver pose may be useful for emergency alerts . Along the same lines, pedestrian detection algorithms have been used successfully in autonomous cars, enabling the car to make smarter decisions. =Video games= Commercially, pose estimation has been used in the context of video games, popularized with the Microsoft Kinect sensor (a depth camera). These systems track the user to render their avatar in-game, in addition to performing tasks like gesture recognition to enable the user to interact with the game.

Ct. R. 10(a) (2013); see also Tom Cummins & Adam Aft, Appellate Review, 2 59, 60 (2012) (discussing definition of the term \\"circuit split\\"). The existence of a circuit split is one of the factors that the Supreme Court of the United States considers when deciding whether to grant review of a case.https://www.supremecourt.gov/ctrules/2013RulesoftheCourt.pdf Some scholars suggest that the Supreme Court is more likely to grant review of a case to resolve a circuit split than for any other reason.Philip Allen Lacovara, 647 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). Despite the Supreme Court's desire to resolve conflicts between circuit courts, legal scholars disagree about whether circuit splits are detrimental or beneficial. Some argue that circuit splits are harmful because they create confusion and encourage forum shopping, while other scholars argue that variation among circuits allows local courts to experiment with new laws that reflect the values of local residents.Clifford Wallace, The Nature and Extent of Intercircuit Conflicts: A Solution Needed for a Mountain or a Molehill?, 71 913 (1983) (assessing arguments on both sides of the debate). Scholars have also observed that regional variations in different areas of the United States have provided certain circuits with a particular specialization or expertise in some subjects of the law.See, e.g., Eric Hansford, Measuring the Effects of Specialization with Circuit Split Resolutions, 63 1145, 1150 (2011).  Origins  Article III of the United States Constitution specifies that \\"[t]he judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\\"U.S. Const. art. III, ¬ß 1. In 1789, Congress created the first system of intermediate appellate courts, known as federal circuit courts, which had appellate jurisdiction over certain matters decided by District Courts.Daniel John Meador & Jordana Simone Bernstein, 7 (1994); Ruth A. Moyer, Disagreement About Disagreement: The Effect of A Circuit Split or \\"Other Circuit\\" Authority on the Availability of Federal Habeas Relief for State Convicts, 82 831, 836 (2014) (discussing history of federal circuit courts). These federal circuit courts consisted of two justices from the Supreme Court of the United States and one district court judge.Ruth A. Moyer, Disagreement About Disagreement: The Effect of A Circuit Split or \\"Other Circuit\\" Authority on the Availability of Federal Habeas Relief for State Convicts, 82 831, 836 (2014). In 1891, Congress created the existing system of United States courts of appeals, which hear appeals from United States district courts within limited geographic areas.Daniel John Meador & Jordana Simone Bernstein, 7 (1994). For example, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit hears appeals originating from United States district courts in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Decisions in circuit courts are usually made by rotating three-judge panels chosen from judges sitting within that circuit, and circuit courts also occasionally decide cases en banc.Arthur D. Hellman, \\"The Law of the Circuit\\" Revisited: What Role for Majority Rule?, 32 625 (2008); see also Fed. R. App. P. 35(a). Circuit courts do not collaborate or work with other circuits to resolve legal issues, and different circuit courts may reach conflicting conclusions about the same legal issue.Arthur March Brown, Comity in the Fed. Courts, 28 589, 590 (1915) (\\"Each District Court is independent of every other District Court, each Circuit Court of Appeals of every other Circuit Court of Appeals.\\"). Furthermore, cases decided in one circuit are not binding authority on other circuits.Chad Flanders, Toward a Theory of Persuasive Authority, 62 55, 77 (2009) (\\"[T]he fact that a court in a different circuit has ruled one way does not mean that all the circuits have to rule that way; indeed, even if every other court has ruled one way, this does not mandate the outcome for the remaining circuit.\\"). If the Supreme Court of the United States has not ruled on a legal issue, federal courts of appeals resolve these issues \\"as they see fit, subject only to a norm of intracircuit stare decisis.\\"Wayne A. Logan, Constitutional Cacophony: Federal Circuit Splits and the Fourth Amendment, 65 1137, 1139 (2012). When a circuit split occurs, there is rarely an even numeric division among courts of appeals with regard to how the dispute should be resolved.Tom Cummins & Adam Aft, Appellate Review, 2 59 (2012). In fact, one study found that courts of appeals split evenly in less than one third of all circuit splits. Occasionally, separate courts of appeals will reach three or more different conclusions with regard to the same legal issue.See, e.g., Deborah J. Buswell, Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act: A Three Ring Circus ‚Äî Three Circuits, Three Interpretations, 28 979 (2003).  Significance  Some scholars criticize the existence of circuit splits,See, e.g., Trevor W. Morrison, Fair Warning & the Retroactive Judicial Expansion of Federal Criminal Statutes, 74 455 (2001). while other scholars suggest that circuit splits may, in fact, be beneficial.See, e.g., Amanda Frost, Overvaluing Uniformity, 94 1567, 1571 (2008). Others simply argue that circuit splits may not be ideal, but problems associated with inter-circuit conflicts are overstated.See, e.g., J. Clifford Wallace, The Nature and Extent of Intercircuit Conflicts: A Solution Needed for a Mountain or a Molehill?, 71 913, 923, 929 (1983). For example, Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Harvie Wilkinson once stated the \\"world will not end because a few circuit splits are left unresolved.\\"J. Harvie Wilkinson III, If It Ain't Broke . . ., 119 67, 69 (2010). = Criticisms of circuit splits = Legal analysts have identified problems associated with circuit splits.Wayne A. Logan, Constitutional Cacophony: Federal Circuit Splits & the Fourth Amendment, 65 1137, 1147‚Äì48 (2012) (noting that researchers have identified \\"unique problems they present\\"). Jesse M. Boodoo, for example, suggests that circuit splits create a state of confusion and uncertainty for citizens.Jesse M. Boodoo, Compounding Problems & Compounding Confusion: Federal Regulation of Compounded Drug Products & the FDAMA Circuit Split, 36 220, 243 (2010) (\\"The split between the Fifth and Ninth Circuits on the severability of the FDAMA creates a confusing state of affairs.\\"). Because different laws are applied and enforced in different jurisdictions, Daniel J. Meador has argued that Circuit splits may create a judicial \\"Tower of Babel.\\"Daniel J. Meador, A Challenge to the Judicial Architecture: Modifying the Regional Design of the U.S. Courts of Appeal, 56 603, 640 (1989). Additionally, Wayne A. Logan has argued that if courts speak with a unified voice, this will \\"secure popular respect for judicial authority.\\"Wayne A. Logan, Constitutional Cacophony: Federal Circuit Splits & the Fourth Amendment, 65 1137, 1173 (2012). Likewise, Matthew Lund cautions that circuit splits will lead to forum shopping, where litigants flock to jurisdictions with more favorable laws.See, e.g., Matthew Lund, Rockwell International, Pondcrete, and an A La Carte Three-Step Test for Determining an \\"Original Source\\" in Qui Tam Lawsuits, 2008 1243, 1244 (2008). Judge Kimberly A. Moore also suggests that circuit splits and forum shopping lead to economic inefficiency because outcomes are unpredictable and litigants are less likely to settle.See, e.g., Kimberly A. Moore, Forum Shopping in Patent Cases: Does Geographic Choice Affect Innovation?, 79 889, 893-94 (2001). Scholars have also argued that inconsistent application of laws in different circuits is inherently unfair.See, e.g., Kiran H. Griffith, Fugitives in Immigration: A Call for Legislative Guidelines on Disentitlement, 36 209, 243 (2012) (arguing that it is \\"intolerable\\" for one result to be reached \\"in one circuit and the opposite result in another\\"). Trevor W. Morrison, for example, claims that circuit splits create potential due process conflicts if criminal defendants are unaware that their behavior constitutes criminal activity in that circuit.Trevor W. Morrison, Fair Warning & the Retroactive Judicial Expansion of Federal Criminal Statutes, 74 455 (2001) (discussing due process implications of circuit splits in federal criminal law). An article in the New England Journal on Criminal & Civil Confinement also suggested that there is the potential for the unconstitutional ex post facto application of law after circuit splits are resolved.Retrospective Application of State Firearm Prohibitions Triggering Enhanced Sentencing Under Federal Law: A Violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause? The Circuits Split, 27 307, 323 (2001) (discussing ex post facto application of law). Additionally, Jesse M. Boodoo argues that federal agencies tasked with enforcing laws throughout the United States may face challenges implementing regulatory measures when federal legislation is interpreted differently in separate circuits.Jesse M. Boodoo, Compounding Problems & Compounding Confusion: Federal Regulation of Compounded Drug Products & the FDAMA Circuit Split, 36 220 (2010) (discussing challenges with FDA's initial assertion of regulatory jurisdiction over compounded drugs in light of existing circuit split). = Arguments in favor of circuit splits = Legal scholars have also identified benefits associated with circuit splits.See, e.g., Amanda Frost, Overvaluing Uniformity, 94 1567, 1578 (2008); J. Clifford Wallace, The Nature and Extent of Intercircuit Conflicts: A Solution Needed for a Mountain or a Molehill?, 71 913, 923, 929 (1983). For example, Justice Louis Brandeis praised the fact that splits of opinion among courts allow jurisdictions to experiment with new developments in law without risking harm to other jurisdictions.See New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (\\"It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.\\"). Judge Diane P. Wood has suggested that circuit splits and \\"disagreements with colleagues force judges to sharpen their writing, push them to defend their positions, and from time to time persuade them that someone else's perspective is preferable\\".Diane P. Wood, Is It Time to Abolish the Federal Circuit's Exclusive Jurisdiction in Patent Cases?, 13 L. 1, 5-6 (2013). Amanda Frost has argued that negative attitudes toward circuit splits may hinder progress and creative problem solving because \\"[c]ourts of appeals are generally hesitant to depart from precedent set in other jurisdictions, despite being under no obligation to adhere to decisions by sister circuits.\\"Amanda Frost, Overvaluing Uniformity, 94 1567, 1578 (2008) (arguing that \\"nonuniformity has too often been given priority at the expense of other values\\"). Consequently, Frost suggests that uniformity among circuits may be \\"overvalued.\\" Likewise, Wayne A. Logan suggests that Circuit splits may also be beneficial by virtue of the fact that citizens in different parts of the country have different preferences for how to structure their laws.Wayne A. Logan, Constitutional Cacophony: Federal Circuit Splits & the Fourth Amendment, 65 1137, 1161‚Äì62 (2012). Additionally, Judge J. Clifford Wallace has argued that there is nothing inherently wrong with different laws existing in different circuits,J. Clifford Wallace, The Nature and Extent of Intercircuit Conflicts: A Solution Needed for a Mountain or a Molehill?, 71 913, 923, 929 (1983) (noting that it is \\"not clear that there is anything intrinsically unacceptable about conflicts\\"). and \\"if conflicts were by their very nature unacceptable, the traditional rule denying precedential status to out-of-circuit decisions probably would not have enjoyed its long history.\\" J. Clifford Wallace, The Nature and Extent of Intercircuit Conflicts: A Solution Needed for a Mountain or a Molehill?, 71 913, 929 (1983).  Resolving circuit splits at the Supreme Court of the United States  One of the primary functions of the Supreme Court of the United States is to ensure that laws are interpreted uniformly among intermediate courts of appeal.Testimony of Justice Van Devanter, , 68th Cong., 1st Sess., at 29-30 (1924); see also Wright v. North Carolina, , cert. den. (Douglas, J., dissenting). Unless the legislature takes action, the United States Supreme Court is the only source of resolution for conflicts among intermediate courts of appeal.Wright v. North Carolina, , cert. den. (Douglas, J., dissenting) (\\"We are, of course, the only source of resolution for this conflict and it is our obligation to provide uniformity on such important federal constitutional questions.\\"). Consequently, the existence of a circuit split may be a key factor when the Supreme Court decides whether to accept a case.H.W. Perry, , Harvard University Press 251 (1991); see also Moskal v. United States, (\\"[W]e granted certiorari to resolve a divergence of opinion among the Courts of Appeals.\\"). Although the Court always maintains discretion over whether it should grant review of a case, the Rules of the Supreme Court of the United States specifically state that the existence of a circuit split is one of the factors the Court considers when deciding whether to grant review. Philip Allen Lacovara and H.W. Perry both claim that the existence of a circuit split is \\"the single most important generalizable factor\\" that determines whether the Supreme Court will grant review of a case.Quoting Philip Allen Lacovara, 647 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also H.W. Perry, , Harvard University Press 246 (1991); Ryan Stephenson, Federal Circuit Case Selection at the Supreme Court: An Empirical Analysis 102 271, 274 (2013) (discussing Perry's findings). Indeed, justices sometimes cite the lack of a circuit split as a reason to deny review in a case. Although federal judges are prohibited from commenting publicly \\"on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court\\",, Canon 3: A Judge Should Perform the Duties of the Office Fairly, Impartially and Diligently. Judge Alfred T. Goodwin has stated that circuit court judges will occasionally create circuit splits to \\"hold the Supreme Court's toes to the fire\\" and force the Supreme Court to overrule precedent in other circuits.Stephen L. Wasby, Intercircuit Conflicts in the Courts of Appeals, 63 119, 140 (2002) (internal citations and quotations omitted) (noting that Goodwin \\"always took the view that we should not hesitate to create splits if we thoughtfully and carefully concluded that [another] Circuit was wrong\\"). Goodwin also wrote that \\"some of our number actually found it intellectually stimulating to challenge the Supreme Court from time to time\\" but that those judges \\"usually were rewarded by a Nine Zip reversal\\".Stephen L. Wasby, Intercircuit Conflicts in the Courts of Appeals, 63 119, 140 n.53 (2002) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Likewise, Judge Charles R. Wilson noted that when he drafted dissenting opinions, he would consider whether the parties planned to appeal the case to the Supreme Court of the United States, and \\"[i]f I believe that the parties will [file an appeal], I write the dissent with the Supreme Court in mind\\".Charles R. Wilson, How Opinions Are Developed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, 32 247, 266 n.102 (2003). C. Steven Bradford has also argued that circuit courts will \\"disregard a Supreme Court precedent if convinced that the Supreme Court would not follow it\\".C. Steven Bradford, Following Dead Precedent: The Supreme Court's Ill-Advised Rejection of Anticipatory Overruling, 59 39, 43 (1990). A study of Supreme Court cases during the first six terms of the Roberts Court (2005‚Äì2010) resolving circuit splits found that the Supreme Court upheld the view held by the majority of circuits in 51.5 percent of all cases.John S. Summers & Michael J. Newman, Towards a Better Measure and Understanding of U.S. Supreme Court Review of Courts of Appeals Decisions, 80 U.S.L.W. 393 (2011); cf. Tom Cummins & Adam Aft, Appellate Review, 2 59 (2012) (finding agreement with majority of circuits in ninety percent of cases). This same study found the greatest agreement when deciding legal issues between the Fifth and Tenth circuits (80.6 percent), the First and Second circuits (73.5 percent), and the Fifth and Fourth circuits (73.0 percent).John S. Summers & Michael J. Newman, Towards a Better Measure and Understanding of U.S. Supreme Court Review of Courts of Appeals Decisions, 80 U.S.L.W. 393 (2011). The circuit courts that agreed the least frequently were the Ninth and Fourth circuits (39.0 percent) and the Ninth and Seventh circuits (39.2 percent). Additionally, a study analyzing cases from the 2010 term found that nearly two thirds of Supreme Court decisions resolving circuit splits were decided unanimously or by an 8-1 vote.  Specialization among circuit courts of appeals  The eleven numbered circuit courts of appeals and the District of Columbia Circuit have appellate jurisdiction over cases in almost every area of the lawRuth Bader Ginsburg, An Overview of Court Review for Constitutionality in the United States, 57 1019, 1021 (1997) (\\"With some notable exceptions . . . federal courts are not specialized tribunals; typically, they are generalist courts, and none of their members sit, as continental judges do, in sections divided by subject matter.\\"). arising within the boundaries of that circuit.See 28 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1291, 1294 (2006). However, the subjects that appear more frequently in each circuit vary according to the kinds of cases that arise more often within the circuit's boundaries. For example, the District of Columbia Circuit, which contains the federal capital, hears a large number of administrative law cases.John G. Roberts, Jr., What Makes the D.C. Circuit Different? A Historical View, 92 375 (2006). Likewise, the Second Circuit, which contains New York, hears nearly one third of all federal securities law appeals, while the Fifth Circuit, which covers more than half of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border, hears approximately half of all federal immigration appeals.Eric Hansford, Measuring the Effects of Specialization with Circuit Split Resolutions, 63 1145, 1150 (2011) (noting that these totals are slightly misleading, because they do not account for discrepancies between the geographic size of the circuit courts). Eric Hansford argues that this has led to \\"specialized\\" courts with particular expertise with the subjects that appear before the court more frequently. Studies also suggest that the Supreme Court is more likely to affirm decisions of circuit courts when the circuit court has ruled on a case for which they possess special expertise.Eric Hansford, Measuring the Effects of Specialization with Circuit Split Resolutions, 63 1145, 1167 (2011) (concluding that \\"partial specialization improves judicial performance\\"). In some specialized areas of the law, cases are assigned to a court of appeals that possesses expertise in that area of the law.See, e.g. Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., (discussing formation of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit). For example, Congress created the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit as an exclusive federal court of appeals for patent cases.H.R.Rep. No. 97‚Äì312, pp. 20‚Äì23 (1981). Congress noted that consolidating cases in a single court of appeals would \\"strengthen the United States patent system in such a way as to foster technological growth and industrial innovation.\\"H.R.Rep. No. 97‚Äì312, p. 20 (1981). Because of its role as a specialist court, circuit splits rarely exist between the Federal Circuit and other circuit courts of appeal.Eric Hansford, Measuring the Effects of Specialization with Circuit Split Resolutions, 63 1145, 1150 (2011) (\\"[t]he Federal Circuit rarely opposes other circuits in circuit splits\\"). In his opinion in Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., Justice David Souter observed that avoiding conflicting rulings among circuit courts in patent law cases benefits the economy by providing legal certainty to businesses.See, e.g. Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., (discussing economic consequences of creating the Federal Circuit as a specialized tribunal).  Examples of existing circuit splits  The following are examples of existing splits of authority between different circuit courts of appeals:See Wayne A. Logan, Constitutional Cacophony: Federal Circuit Splits & the Fourth Amendment, 65 1137, 1195 (2012). * The Sixth Circuit and the Tenth Circuit disagree with regard to whether police may seize an individual, without a warrant, based solely on the officers' reasonable suspicion that the individual being seized committed a misdemeanor.Compare United States v. Moran, 503 F.3d 1135 (10th Cir. 2007) with Gaddis v. Redford, 364 F.3d 763 (6th Cir. 2007)), cert. denied, . * The Third Circuit, Fifth Circuit, and Ninth Circuit disagree with regard to whether the \\"special needs\\" exception permits warrantless strip searches of juveniles.Compare Doe v. Tex. Dep't of Prot. & Regulatory Servs., 299 F.3d 395, 407-08 (5th Cir. 2002) with Landstron v. Ill. Dep't of Children & Family Servs., 892 F.2d 670, 676 (9th Cir. 1990) (noting disagreement with Good v. Dauphin Cnty. Soc. Servs. for Children & Youth, 891 F.2d 1087, 1092 (3d Cir. 1989)). * The Fifth Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit disagree with regard to whether prisoners have a reasonable expectation of privacy for correspondence with their attorney.Compare Al-Amin v. Smith, 511 F.3d 1317 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, with Brewer v. Wilkinson, 3 F.3d 816 (5th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, . * The First Circuit and the Fifth Circuit disagree with regard to the appellate standard of review for a trial court's determination of the scope of defendant's consent to search.Compare United States v. Melendez, 301 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2002) with United States v. Stewart, 93 F.3d 189, 192 (5th Cir. 1996).

Neufville broke the world record in the 400 m and won four gold medals and one bronze in various regional championships. Born in Jamaica, she emigrated at eight years old to Great Britain. British years Marilyn gained three Women's AAA titles as a junior in the 100 yds and 150 yds in the under 15s category in 1967 and won the 220 yds in the under 17 category in 1968. In 1969, she was second at the Women's AAA Championships behind Dorothy Hyman in the 200 m, where she ran 24.3 seconds. Marilyn first appeared on the international scene in September 1969, when she ran the 4 √ó 400 m in a Great Britain vs West Germany match in Hamburg. In March 1970, she competed for Great Britain in the European Indoor Athletics Championships and won gold over 400 m in 53.01, breaking her outdoor PB of 54.2 and the world indoor record, as well as the UK National Junior Indoor Record which stood until February 2019 when Amber Anning ran 53.00 dead. Later in 1970, she won the WAAA outdoor title at the same distance in 52.6. Jamaican years In the summer, before the 1970 British Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh Marilyn chose to represent her country of birth, Jamaica over her country of residence. This caused wide controversy with many members of the British public saying she had betrayed where she was trained and considered her switch like treason. At the Commonwealth Games Neufville established a new world record by improving the preceding mark previously held by the Frenchwomen Colette Besson and Nicole Duclos with 51.0 (electronically timed as 51.02) at the age of 17. This made her the first and so far only Jamaican female athlete to break an outdoor world record. In 1970, she gained more recognition at ISTAF athletics meet in Berlin then at the AAA championships running 52.6 in front of Germany‚Äôs Christel Frese and Inge Eckhoff. In 1971, in the indoor AAA championships, Marilyn was beaten by Jannette Champion which reversed the result of the previous year. The same year, in the Pan-American Championships in Cali, she gained her third gold medal and bronze in the 4 √ó 400 m. At the 1971 Central American and Caribbean Championships she won a fourth gold medal. Her successes earned her two Jamaica Sportswoman of the year awards in 1970 and 1971. In 1972, she enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley. She is still ranked number 3 on the school's all-time list. After battling with injuries Marilyn returned at the 1974 British Commonwealth Games but was a shadow of her former self only finishing sixth in the 400 m final.

The route enters Arkansas on the Memphis & Arkansas Bridge over the Mississippi River from Memphis. It travels northward through northeast Arkansas connecting the cities of West Memphis and Blytheville. I-55 continues into Missouri heading to St. Louis, Missouri. The highway overlaps Interstate 40 in West Memphis and has a junction with Interstate 555, a spur route to Jonesboro, in Turrell. For the majority of its routing through Arkansas, I-55 generally follows U.S. Route 61 (US 61). Route description Interstate 55 splits from Interstate 40 in West Memphis. I-55 enters Arkansas from Memphis, Tennessee on the Memphis & Arkansas Bridge over the Mississippi River, sharing the bridge with US 61/US 64/US 70/US 79. Shortly after entering the state the highway enters West Memphis, where US 70 exits the route and becomes Broadway Avenue. I-55/US 61/US 64/US 79 form a concurrency with Interstate 40 at exit 5, an overlap that lasts . The highways split at I-40 exit 277, with I-40/US 63/US 79 continuing west to Little Rock and I-55/US 61/US 63/US 64 running north into Marion. US 64 exits I-55/US 61/US 63 in Marion, continuing west as Old Military Road toward Wynne. Interstate 55 continues to run through farmlands of the Arkansas delta, paralleling Highway 77 until Turrell.

Known for his defense and bunting, he won several Gold Gloves, made two All-Star teams and set several sacrifice hit records. Kawai was a pitcher in high school. In 1982, the Giants took him in the first round of the draft. He was moved to the infield and debuted for the Giants in 1984, mostly as a defensive substitute and pinch-hitter, getting only 126 plate appearances over 159 games in his first four years. He got 81 plate appearances at age 23 in 1988, hitting .268/.307/.423. Masahiro became a regular for the 1989 Giants, batting .254/.312/.361 and won his first Gold Glove as the top defensive shortstop in the Central League. He hit .190/.261/.238 for Yomiuri as they won the 1989 Japan Series. The next season, he set a new Nippon Professional Baseball record with 58 sacrifice hits and put up a good .288/.356/.450 line with career highs in slugging, home runs (9) and steals (9). He made the first of his two All-Star appearances and won another Gold Glove. In the 1990 Japan Series, he went 2 for 10 with a walk and a game four home run, a rare bright spot as the Giants were swept. In 1991, the Yomiuri shortstop took home his third Gold Glove while hitting .251/.330/.312 with a career-best 36 RBI. He laid down 66 successful sacrifice hits, breaking his own record; his mark would later be topped by Shinya Miyamoto. The next year, Masahiro had a .258/.312/.345 and led the Central League with 42 sacrifice hits. Takahiro Ikeyama broke his Gold Glove run at short. Kawai hit .290/.350/.381 in 1993 and made his second All-Star appearance while winning his fourth Gold Glove. His 176 total bases and 23 doubles were career highs and his 45 sacrifice hits gave him the Central League lead for a fourth consecutive year. Masahiro scored a career-high 69 runs in 1994 and hit .302/.376/.357, setting highs in average and OBP as well. He finished 9th in the Central League in average and won his fifth Gold Glove. He only batted .091/.160/.136 in the 1994 Japan Series but Yomiuri still won. In 1995, the 30-year-old veteran produced at a .261/.348/.313 rate and lost the Gold Glove to Kenjiro Nomura. His 47 sacrifice hits led the league. The next season, Kawai batted just .232/.310/.277 and won his sixth and final Gold Glove; he also led in sacrifice hits for the sixth time (56). He was 4 for 13 with 4 walks in the 1996 Japan Series. He capped his 7th sacrifice hit title in 8 years and the last of his career by laying down 45 in 1997, when he hit .288/.355/.392. Masahiro batted .256/.301/.327 during the 1998 season and he failed to reach 100 games played for the first time in six years as Daisuke Motoki was used regularly at short; Kawai remained the starter. He became the chairman of the board of the Japan Professional Baseball Players Association that winter; he would hold the job for three years before Kazuyoshi Tatsunami took his place. By 1999, though, he was on the bench usually, hitting .295/.371/.302 in 149 AB and 82 games, in a backup role again after a decade as the starter. Tomohiro Nioka was now the starting shortstop and would hold the role for years. Kawai had only 58 AB in 54 games in 2000, batting .190/.294/.207 (he was 0 for 1 with a sacrifice in the 2000 Japan Series) and 52 AB in 73 games the next season, hitting .288/.315/.462. His career had come full-circle from defensive sub in the 1980s to starter in the 1990s to defensive sub in the 2000s. In 2002, the 37-year-old produced at a .219/.246/.289 rate in 132 AB over 88 games, backing up Nioka at short, Motoki at third and Toshihisa Nishi at second base. In the 2002 Japan Series, he played one game at third as a defensive sub. His brightest moment may have been in 2003; though he hit only .238/.247/.300 in 80 AB over 72 games and was rarely playing short (primarily subbing for Akira Eto and Motoki at third), he won national acclaim when he laid down his 512th career sacrifice hit. This broke Eddie Collins' world record and got significant media attention in Japan. Robert Whiting, perhaps using a fair bit of hyperbole, says that it \\"was greeted with as much fanfare as if he had surpassed the home run record. There were fireworks on the Tokyo Dome electronic scoreboard and a flowery ceremony involving Kawai's wife and children, accompanied by tears of joy all around.\\" Yomiuri then tried to pressure him to retire but he refused and the club released him after 20 years with them. Kawai caught on with the Chunichi Dragons for 2004 and hit .261/.393/.391 in 23 AB, playing 80 games, almost exclusively as Tatsunami's backup at third base. In the 2004 Japan Series, he played three games at third and did not bat. In 2005, the 40-year-old again was the defensive substitute at third. He hit .294/.294/.412 in 17 AB over 69 games. For his final season, he batted .273/.304/.273 in 22 AB in 51 games. He played one game in the 2006 Japan Series and, very fittingly, laid down a successful sacrifice bunt in his final plate appearance after 23 years in Nippon Professional Baseball. His career offensive line read .266/.333/.345 with 533 sacrifice hits in 1,909 games. Ken Hirano (451) was second all-time in Nippon Professional Baseball in sacrifice hits at the time of Kawai's retirement with no other player within 200. Kawai retired after the 2006 season and was hired by Chunichi as a coach.

In 2001 he completed his first album, Molten. In 2016 he completed his latest album, The Mark of Gold Light, at Abbey Road Studios.  Biography  Bowvayne (also known as Andrew Knight) has investigated myths and mysteries, presented children's television programmes, performed hundreds of public speaking engagements, written a television series in Australia, movie screenplays, and a manual on how to write creatively.  Discography  = Albums = Bowvayne's 2001 debut album, Molten, was recorded in Australia and includes rocker Joe Camilleri (Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons, The Revelators and his Black Sorrows). As well as playing a vast array of instruments, Joe was also the producer for the album, which was recorded at Camilleri's Woodstock Studios. Work is completed on his second album, The Mark of Gold Light, in collaboration with ith Jim Eldritch and Matt Zander. The album will be themed with short pieces of narration. = Singles = 2001 Hot for You is taken from the album Molten. It is a different edit from the album track itself, and includes two bonus edits ‚Äì the Shanghai Radio Edit and Shanghai 12\\" re-mix. = Videos = 2002 Hot for You.  Books  Bow's first fiction book, a children's fantasy entitled The Forbidden Jewel, was published in 1987 and was endorsed by Kate Bush by writing the foreword \\"If you like adventure, fantasy and magic, then this is the book for you\\". His next novel, All Manner of Magic, was the best-selling children's book at the 1990 Singapore International Book Fair ‚Äì a book fair held annually at the World Trade Center. In 1992, Bow wrote four books for the well-known Australian characters, the Kangaroo Creek Gang series, entitled Treasure Map, The Liar Bird, Superstickious and One Joke Too Many. The \\"Mythbusters\\" series of books have published and sold internationally, and include Mythbusters ‚Äì First Cases (1991), Mythbusters ‚Äì Nut Cases (1993) (School Book Fairs' Book of the Term in the autumn of 1993), and Mythbusters ‚Äì Real-Life Adventures in the World of the Supernatural (1996), published by Puffin Books. This involved Bowvayne and his team travelling all over the world investigating mysteries from monsters and buried treasure to UFOs and ghosts. From 1993 to 1996, they also made appearances on the UK Channel 4 morning variety show The Big Breakfast in this capacity. In 1996 the books The Monster Store (a collection of children's short stories), and Creative Sparkle (a creative writing manual) were published in Singapore and Malaysia. Alexander Downer, MP, Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs endorsed Bowvayne's twelfth published book, Skin Deep, when it was launched in Australia in 1997. The tale of a schoolboy racist bully who turns green, it won plaudits around the world for its rich comedic seam and subtlety of moral message. Bow's latest book series, The Misadventures of Danny Cloke, is published by Usborne Publishing. The first novel, A Turn in the Grave, was released in 2004, short-listed in the UK for two book awards, and has been translated into numerous languages. A movie screenplay for A Turn in the Grave is being written. The sequel, A Spell Behind Bars is now published, and A Twist in the Tail will follow soon.  Television and film credits  In other fields of the entertainment industry, Bow has written scripts for television including LA, a lifestyle series screened on Australia's Channel 9 in 1999. He and Rising Sun Pictures secured funding from the South Australian Film Corporation to work on his screenplay, The Prize Turkey's Christmas. This project in ongoing. Bow has also been involved in the television industry as a presenter. He wrote and presented It's Preposterous for Banksia (1995), presented numerous segments of the Television South Coast to Coast news programme on ITV in the UK between 1988 and 1992, and also appeared on UK Channel 4's The Big Breakfast between 1993 and 1996. He wrote and presented Preposterous Poems, a mixture of real-life and animation for children, a co-operative project between Channel 9/Banksia and Kickscreen UK. In 1994, Bow had a stand-up comedy slot at the Edinburgh Fringe. Bow received an acting credit in the recent successful horror movie, Wolf Creek. In January 2005, Bowvayne commenced legal proceedings in Australia against Beyond Productions, the producer of the MythBusters television show, alleging passing off in relation to the use of the name \\"Mythbusters\\". Bow asserted that he had invented the word in 1988, see numerous interviews e.g. Big Breakfast TV show, The Times (UK), and The Today programme, Nine network, and that he had used the name continuously since in relation to pursuing myths and mysteries all around the world. He cited his series of books including a title by one of the most famous publishers in the world, namely Penguin Books under the banner \\"Mythbusters\\" in 1991, 1993, and 1996. In February 2007, the Federal Court of Australia dismissed Bow's claims against Beyond Productions.Knight v. Beyond Properties Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 70 A parallel action, relying on the same three books and a collection of television appearances, a television pilot episode, and Beyond's response to Bow's TV concept on officially headed notepaper, as well as Beyond's Title and Business Searches showing Bow's clear prior claim, that proved that Beyond had knowledge, all was dismissed. In the UK Beyond Properties Pty Limited was again a defendant. These claims were also dismissed.Knight v.

Orbital motion is to the left. The Earth is down. Mount Everest is shown several times for scale. The Fotino was released at the vertical, 32 km below Foton, about 240 km above the surface of the Earth, and made a re-entry towards Kazakhstan. The Young Engineers' Satellite 2 (YES2) is a 36 kg student-built tether satellite that is part of ESA's Foton-M3 microgravity mission. The launch of the Russian Foton-M3 occurred on September 14, 2007 at 13:00 (CEST) by a Soyuz-U launcher. The project was carried out by Delta-Utec SRC and supervised by the ESA Education Office and was nearly entirely designed and build by students and young engineers. The YES2 deployment took place Sept. 25, 2007. The mission objective was to deploy a 30 km long and 0.5 mm thin tether (made of Dyneema) in two controlled stages, in order to release a small, spherical, lightweight reentry capsule called Fotino into a predetermined trajectory to a landing area in Kazakhstan. The scientific objectives of the mission have been achieved. The YES2 featured the first multi-stage tether deployment. It could be reconstructed within about 20 m accuracy for the first stage (3400 m) and 100‚Äì150 m for the 31.7 km deployment as a whole. The first stage was deployed accurately (about 10‚Äì20 m error), the second stage overdeployed by 1.7 km. Fotino released as planned during a swing of the tethered system through the vertical (as seen from Foton). The tether properties, deployment dynamics and tether deployer system performance could be evaluated. The tether deployer performed nominally. However, due to an electrical fault, the on-board computer failed to register the final length correctly and only a partial deployment was initially reported based on telemetry available in real-time. Initial deployment friction was found to exceed the nominal range, revealed by post-mission testing to be most likely due to a thermomechanical settling of the tether spool ESA YES page Some weeks after mission completion, analysis of the full data set confirmed that the tether deployed to its full length of 31.7 km.Michiel Kruijff, Erik J. van der Heide, and Wubbo J. Ockels, \\"Data Analysis of a Tethered SpaceMail Experiment,\\" JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS Vol. 46, No. 6, November‚ÄìDecember 2009, (preview)Michiel Kruijff, \\"Tethers in Space, a propellantless propulsion in-orbit demonstration\\", () No signal was ever received from the \\"Fotino\\" re-entry capsule after separation, and it was lost. YES2 established a new world record as the longest artificial structure in space and was later included in the Guinness Book of Records Edition 2009. The YES2 project Most of the work done in this ambitious project (like design, manufacturing and integration) was done by students and young engineers. In total some 450 students participated. Soon after the beginning of the project, four \\"Centres of Expertise\\" were created. These were universities which were responsible for parts of the satellite or subsystems. The centres were: Samara State Aerospace University, Russia (mission analysis, GPS); University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy (re-entry capsule); Hochschule Niederrhein in Krefeld, Germany (tether); University of Patras, Greece (mechanical and thermal). Coordination and system engineering was carried out by prime contractor Delta-Utec SRC from the Netherlands. Towards the end of the project, in the manufacturing and integration phase, the work concentrated on the Delta-Utec office in Leiden and ESA's ESTEC in Noordwijk, where the satellite was built and tested. The test program included: * electromagnetic compatibility testing in the \\"Maxwell\\" EMC test chamber * simulation of space environment in a thermal vacuum chamber * vibration testing on a shake table * functional tests of all components and sub-systems The satellite was handed over to ESA at the beginning of May 2007 and was shipped to Samara (Russia) soon after, where YES2 was mated to Foton-M3 for the first time for test purposes. Afterwards YES2 and Foton were separated again and brought to Baikonur (Kazakhstan) by train where the whole satellite was completely integrated and mated with the launcher, a Soyuz-U rocket. Foton-M3 and YES2 finally launched on 14 September 2007 at 13:00 (CEST) from the Gagarin launch pad at Baikonur Cosmodrome. The main contribution of the project has been the demonstration of a complex controlled deployment in two stages. Post-flight, several independent sources of deployment data were collected, including deployment length and rate measurements from YES2 itself as well as highly precise triaxial accelerometer data from a separate experiment on the Foton carrier spacecraft. These data confirmed that the deployment did progress mostly successfully, in particular the critical first stage and stage transition and the tether deployer performed nominally. The data that has been recovered has helped to understand the deployer performance and tether dynamics in yet unseen detail, including explicit signatures of sound waves, transverse waves and spring-mass motion. The small reentry capsule Fotino, intended to demonstrate the SpaceMail concept, was not successfully recovered. Calculations based on YES2 sensor data indicate that the landing site should be in or near the Aral Sea. Alternatively, the capsule, experimental in itself, may have burnt up or crashlanded. Design of the satellite There are three main components of the experiment: *FLOYD ‚Äì the YES2 deployment mechanism located on the Foton spacecraft; *MASS ‚Äì the Mechanical data Acquisition and Support System; *FOTINO ‚Äì a small spherical capsule, with a diameter of 40 cm and a mass of 6 kg. YES2 mission design During the flight, the FLOYD mechanism ejected the other two components. There was then to be a controlled deployment of a 30 km long tether. Orbital dynamics caused the Fotino capsule to be positioned in front of the mother spacecraft. By bringing the deployment to a halt, a pendulum-like swing was induced. When the capsule and tether swung through the local vertical, the tether was cut. Since the capsule was then going too slowly to stay in orbit, it has entered a trajectory to re-enter the atmosphere from an altitude of about 250 km, protected by a heat shield made of novel materials. Once it reached an altitude of 5 km, a parachute was intended to deploy to ensure a soft landing on the steppes of Kazakhstan. Since data from the Fotino was not downlinked and the Fotino capsule itself was not recovered, it is not known how well the capsule has survived the entry.

Similar to other debt securities, ETNs have a maturity date and are backed only by the credit of the issuer. ETNs are designed to provide investors access to the returns of various market benchmarks. The returns of ETNs are usually linked to the performance of a market benchmark or strategy, less investor fees. When an investor buys an ETN, the underwriting bank promises to pay the amount reflected in the index, minus fees upon maturity. Thus ETN has an additional risk compared to an ETF; if the credit of the underwriting bank becomes suspect, the investment might lose value, the same way a senior debt would. Often linked to the performance of a market benchmark, ETNs are not equities, equity-based securities, index funds or futures. Although ETNs are usually traded on an exchange and can be sold short, ETNs don't actually own any underlying assets of the indices or benchmarks they are designed to track. The first ETN across the globe was developed and issued in May 2000 In the state of Israel by Haim Even-Zahav the CEO of Psagot-Ofek financial instruments (Leumi group) under the product name TALI-25. The purpose of issuing this instrument was to track the TEL AVIV-25 index which represent the 25 leading companies in Israel. Almost two years later, in March 2002, issued the first ETN in the united states by the Equity Structured Products Group at Morgan Stanley under the product name BOXES as a way to access the biotechnology index at very low cost. In 2006, Barclays re- marketed the product under the trade name [iPath] Exchange-Traded Notes. This was soon followed by Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs, and Swedish Export Credit Corporation. In 2008, additional issuers entered the market with their own offerings; these include BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, UBS, Lehman Brothers, and Credit Suisse. As of April 2008, there were 56 ETNs from nine issuers tracking different indexes. The popularity of ETNs is mainly due to the advantages that it offers to investors. Structure The returns of ETNs are linked to the performance of a market benchmark or strategy, less investor fees. As discussed previously, ETNs are debt notes. When held to maturity, the investor will receive a cash payment that is linked to the performance of the corresponding index during the period beginning on the trade date and ending at maturity, less investor fees. Typically, ETNs do not offer principal protection. ETNs could also be liquidated before their maturity by trading them on the exchange or by redeeming a large block of securities directly to the issuing bank. The redemption is typically on a weekly basis and a redemption charge may apply, subjected to the procedures described in the relevant prospectus. The investor fee is calculated cumulatively based on the yearly fee and the performance of the underlying index and increases each day based on the level of the index or currency exchange rate on that day. Because the investor fee reduces the amount of return at maturity or upon redemption, if the value of the underlying decreases or does not increase significantly, the investor may receive less than the principal amount of investment at maturity or upon redemption. Since ETNs are unsecured, unsubordinated debts, their risk is that of bonds of similar priority in the company's capital structure. Often issued off medium-term note shelves, ETNs would be pari passu with other debt issued off the same shelf. Therefore, ETNs are backed by the credit of the underwriting issuer. Like other debt securities, ETNs do not have voting rights. Unlike other debt securities, interest is not paid during the term of most ETNs. Pros and cons =Advantages= Tax efficiency An ETN offers a tax-efficient way to invest. It is treated as a prepaid contract (such as a forward contract) for tax purposes. The buyer of a prepaid contract pays an initial amount in order to receive a future payment based on the value of an index or other underlying benchmark at a specified future time. Very often index mutual funds and ETFs are required to make yearly income and capital gains distributions to its fund holders that are taxable. When a fund is forced to sell stock to rebalance or otherwise change its composition, the fund holders have to pay any resulting capital gains tax. With ETNs, in contrast, there is no interest payment or dividend distribution, which means there is no annual tax. Capital gain (or loss) is realized when an investor sells the ETN or it matures. Long-term capital gains are treated more favorably than short-term capital gains and interest in the US (> 1 year holdings are taxed at a capital gains rate of 20%). There is no way to avoid paying capital gains tax, but there can be great advantage in wealth building by delaying it. Recent tax rulings have suggested that ETNs may be qualified tax shelters for the purpose of changing current interest income into deferred capital gains income. No tracking error ETNs give investors a broad- based index without any tracking error to the index, doing away with the discrepancies that exist between the returns of many ETFs and their underlying indexes. One reason of the tracking error observed in ETFs might be attributed to the diversification issues that stem from the inability of a fund to replicate an index due to an upper limit on the maximum asset allocation to a single stock. But for ETN, this constraint does not exist, because though ETN is also tracking the index, the return is not based on the underlying securities. The ETN issuer guarantees the holder a return that is an exact replica of the underlying index, minus expense fees. The bank also agrees to pay large shareholders the exact value of the note on a weekly basis through redemption, which helps the ETNs track very closely to the underlying index return. Liquid structured product ETNs are a significant innovation to improve liquidity of structured products. Unlike other buy-and-hold structured products, ETNs can be bought and sold during normal trading hours on the securities exchange. For institutional size redemption, investors may offer their ETN for repurchase by the issuer on a weekly basis. Investors can easily track the performance of their ETN. In this sense, ETNs are structured to resemble ETFs. But ETNs are different from ETFs, as they consist of a debt instrument with cash flows derived from the performance of an underlying asset ‚Äì a structured product. Access to new markets and strategies ETNs have provided access to hard-to-reach exposures, such as commodity futures and the Indian stock market. Certain asset classes and strategies are not easily accessible to individual investors. For example, the ‚Äúmomentum investing‚Äù strategy, which is used in SPECTRUM Large Cap U.S. Sector Momentum Index, is to take advantage of the varied performances of the 10 sub-indexes of the S&P; 500 Total Return IndexSM (SPTR) relative to each other and to the SPTR. The weights of the 10 sub-indexes are computed each day based on performance and correlation. This makes SPECTRUM Large Cap U.S. Sector Momentum Index difficult to track through ETF. On the contrary, ETN provides opportunities to gain exposure to these types of investment strategies in a cost-efficient way. Possibility of leverage Some of the ETNs offer leverage instead of directly tracking a benchmark's performance. For instance, the DGP ETN offered by Deutsche Bank moves in the same direction as gold, but involves double leverage - it replicates twice the returns of holding gold. If gold gains 1%, the note gains 2%. Consequently, if gold goes down by 1%, the note loses 2%. Such characteristics make ETNs suitable for experienced investors willing to take on additional risk in hope of a higher return. =Disadvantages= Credit risk & lack of risk metrics ETNs, as debt instruments, are subject to risk of default by the issuing bank as counter party. This is the major design difference between ETFs and ETNs: ETFs are only subject to market risk whereas ETNs are subject to both market risk and the risk of default by the issuing bank. Even though the possibility of default turning into a reality is relatively low, it ought to be measured and accounted for. ETN investors will require a credit risk metric that facilitates answer to questions regarding the magnitude of the risk and its variation with time. With new players foraying into the ETN space, how will the risk vary by issuer? Who will take up the risk evaluation process? If and when the ETN sector grows, in order to participate, retail and institutional investors will need a source for ETN key data which is easy to assimilate. Illiquidity Given the relative newness of ETNs, not all enjoy high liquidity. The effectiveness of ETNs at tracking indices is contingent on their ability to garner enough support in the market. Another flipside of ETNs relates to their redemption feature. While ETNs can be sold daily on the secondary markets or held until maturity, institutional investors who wish to redeem blocks of 50,000 units or more directly with the issuer can only do so once a week. In contrast, other structured products, ETFs for instance, can be redeemed anytime during a trading day. Tax benefits speculative  The ETN issuers are using tax efficiency as their trump card. As things stand, there is significant tax saving to be gained from investing in ETNs. In reality, however, the Internal Revenue Service has yet to decide on the proposed tax treatment. So, the tax benefit status is still arguable. Dependence on credit ratings ETNs have their worth decided by two factors: * Performance of the index they are set to track * Credit ratings of the issuer Suppose the issuing bank has been impacted negatively, if only marginally, by a crisis like the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis and the ratings agencies depreciate the overall credit rating of the issuer to reflect the event. In this hypothetical case, even though the index it is tracking is showing growth, a decline in rating of an ETN issuing financial institution could negatively impact the worth of an ETN. Unprofitable trading strategies The GSCI has lost nearly 20% of its value since January 2006, despite soaring commodity prices, all thanks to contango. This is one instance where ETN tracked commodity indices like GSCI have ended up doing exactly the opposite of what they had set out to do. Contango is a scenario where the cost of the next-month futures contract is costlier than the current month contract. In this event, the issuing bank books a loss each time a current month contract is sold and the next month contract is bought. Contango has hit hard the energy futures over the past few years and markedly brought down the returns from energy markets. Indices are taking varied steps to hedge against the condition. Their results remain to be seen. The UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index (CMCI) addresses the issues of contango and backwardation by introducing the concept of constant maturity, which provides diversification across futures contract maturity dates. This is intended to smooth out the volatility often associated with commodity investments.UBS ETNs Seek to Smooth Out Commodity Ride See also * Exchange-traded fund * Exchange-traded product * Structured product References External links * Exchange Traded Notes: An Introduction * The Indicative Value - Price Puzzle in ETNs: Liquidity Constraints, Information Signaling, or an Ineffective System for Share Creation? * Mispricing and Trading Profits in ETNs * Are ETNs Realizing Their Potential?

Leesville Concrete Company, 500 U.S. 614 (1991), was a United States Supreme Court case which held that peremptory challenges may not be used to exclude jurors on the basis of race in civil trials.. Edmonson extended the court's similar decision in Batson v. Kentucky (1986), a criminal case. The Court applied the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as determined in Bolling v. Sharpe (1954), in finding that such race-based challenges violated the Constitution.  Background  A black construction worker, Thaddeus Donald Edmonson, was injured during work on federal property. He sued Leesville Concrete Company for negligence leading to his injuries. During jury selection, Leesville used two of their three peremptory challenges on black jurors, leaving a panel of twelve with one African-American. Edmonson, citing Batson, requested that the trial court require Leesville give a race-neutral reason for the peremptory challenges to black jurors, but the court refused. The jury found that Leesville was responsible for 20% of Edmonson's injury and awarded him $18,000. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the decision, holding that parties become state actors during jury selection, and so Batson requires race-neutral selection in civil cases. When the Fifth Circuit reheard the case en banc, they affirmed the original District Court decision. Recognizing a circuit split, the Supreme Court granted certiorari.  Opinion of the Court  Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the opinion for the majority. Justice Kennedy began with a long line of cases where the court held that racial discrimination was impermissible in jury selection before a criminal trial. He then pointed out that although the Court had never indicated such discrimination was permitted in a civil trial, either, it also holds that federal law restrains the actions of government, not private actors. To decide whether to apply federal law, Justice Kennedy applied a two- part test from Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co.. The first part of the test is whether the constitutional deprivation, in this case the right to a fair and impartial jury, resulted from a right rooted in state authority. Kennedy found, almost summarily, that peremptory challenges' intimate role in shaping a jury meant the case met the first part of the test. The second part of the test is whether the private party, Leesville and its counsel, was acting as a \\"state actor\\". In determining whether the Leesville was acting as a state actor, Justice Kennedy considered three issues and relevant precedent. The first issue was whether the actor relies on governmental assistance, and Justice Kennedy found that the system of jury selection clearly existed within the sphere of judicial proceedings and would not be possible without the assistance of the judge and all other constituent elements of the institution. The second consideration was whether the actor is performing a traditional function of government. Justice Kennedy first found that the jury was clearly performing a traditional function of government by serving as the finder-of- fact in a civil trial. Second, he drew a parallel between jury selection and elections, indicating that constitutional constraints apply to all the machinery involved in choosing representatives and juries (such as when parties control primary elections). This is unlike any other aspect of civil litigation, none of which involve a government function like jury selection. The third consideration was whether the injury caused was aggravated in a unique way by the incidents of governmental authority. Justice Kennedy said racial discrimination inside the courtroom diminishes the integrity of the courts and \\"compounds the racial insult\\" of discrimination.Edmonson, 500 U.S. at 628. Justice Kennedy then dealt with the question of whether litigants could raise violations of jurors' rights on their behalf. The relevant precedent in that consideration was Powers v. Ohio,. a similar case that dealt with race-based exclusion of jurors during jury selection in a criminal trial. In Powers, the Court held that litigants generally cannot make a claim due to violations of others' rights, except where the litigant has suffered an injury the courts can resolve, has a close relation with the third party, and the third party is hindered in protecting his or her own interests.Powers, 499 U.S. at 410. Justice Kennedy held that all three conditions were met in Edmonson's case, including the resolvable injury. The concrete resolvable injury arose, in Justice Kennedy's view, whenever racial discrimination took place within criminal or civil trials. The Court did not make a holding regarding whether prima facie evidence of racial discrimination in Edmonson's case actually existed, and remanded the case to the trial court to determine that issue. = Dissent = Three justices dissented, arguing that there was no state action (which is required for any Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment violation) because the litigants are private parties. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the dissent, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia. Justice O'Connor wrote that \\"the Court's final argument is that the exercise of a peremptory challenge by a private litigant is state action because it takes place in a courtroom. [But] the actions of a lawyer in a courtroom do not become those of the government by virtue of their location. This is true even if those actions are based on race.\\" \\"Constitutional 'liability attaches only to those wrongdoers who carry a badge of authority of [the government] and represent it in some capacity.' Tarkanian, 488 U.S., at 191 [double-internal quotation marks omitted].\\" Therefore, although \\"[r]acism is a terrible thing ... [t]he Government is not responsible for a peremptory challenge by a private litigant.\\"  References  External links A documentary on Edmonson v.

Harry Sweet Exhibitors Trade Review December 17, 1921Harry Sweet Lee Moran Baby Peggy Exhibitors Trade Review 1922Harry Sweet (October 2, 1901 - June 18, 1933) was an American actor, director and screenwriter. He appeared in 57 films between 1919 and 1932. He also directed 54 films between 1920 and 1933, including one Harry Langdon short, two of the Tay Garnett- penned comedies Stan Laurel made for Joe Rock, and fifteen of the earliest entries in the Edgar Kennedy \\"Average Man\\" series. Death On June 18, 1933, Sweet was location scouting by private plane in the vicinity of Big Bear Valley. That night, at 7:15 pm, a plane crashed and sank to the bottom of Big Bear Lake, with the authorities initially uncertain as to the identity of the pilot as well as the number and identity of the plane's passengers; on June 19, Bert Gilroy, a film associate of Sweet's, left Los Angeles for Big Bear after efforts to contact the director in that city failed. Hours after the accident, when the plane was pulled from 28 feet of water, the bodies of Sweet, actress Claudette Ford, and scenario writer Howard (Hal) Davitt, were found in the cockpit; the coroner's investigation determined Sweet had drowned and that his companions had both died from fractured skulls suffered in the crash.

He gained a Double First at Oxford University as an undergraduate between 1993 and 1996, and then a Distinction as an M.Sc. student in Economic and Social History in the 1996-97 academic year. While at Oxford, he won the Eubule Thelwall Prize for History and the Gladstone Prize for History and Politics. After a period as a schoolteacher, and as a journalist at The Independent, he moved back into academia at University College London. He took his PhD there in 2002 under the supervision of Professor Kathleen Burk, UCL's Professor of Modern History. In 2001 he was appointed Lecturer in Economic History at the University of Bristol, where he spent a year before moving to New College, Oxford, as lecturer in Modern History. He took up his present post as a lecturer at Oxford Brookes in January 2005 and was promoted to Senior Lecturer in January 2006, before becoming Reader in the History of Public Policy during October 2010 and then Professor of Modern and Contemporary History in October 2013. During November 2006 he was a Visiting Fellow of the University of Oslo. His work chiefly looks at British governments' decision-making and ideas in the twentieth century, drawing on insights from disciplines as far apart a geography, literary theory, telecommunications, politics, diplomatic history, management studies and economics. He has released a book about British economic and social planning in the 1960s; an edited collection about the Wilson governments of those years has been published by Routledge. Recently his work has begun to emphasise long-term elements in the making of British 'national identity', particularly the country's status as an island and oceanic nation as reflected in his 2010 book Britain and the Sea. More recently, he argued-- both in print and online--that the British Conservatives' electoral strength is weaker than is apparent, and that the 2010-2015 Coalition government's spending reductions were too rapid, unstable and economically unsound.'How (Not) to Cut Government Spending and Reduce Public Sector Debt', History and Policy (December 2009).

Various Positions won the 2002 Prix de Montr√©al at the Montreal World Film Festival. Although the film takes its title from an album by (and Ira Nadel's biography of) Leonard Cohen, the subject of the film is not Cohen, nor does he have any affiliation with the work. Synopsis In this briskly-paced romantic drama, college student Josh is on track for law school and a place at his father's firm. As his Orthodox Jewish family prepares for their traditional Passover celebrations, Josh hits a brick wall in the form of the alluring and troubled - and not quite Jewish - Cheryth. As things heat up at the dorm and at home, Josh is suddenly questioning his faith, his father and his future. Even worse, Josh is caught in the middle as his father moves to cover up a scandal involving the Jewish cemetery, forcing Josh to take a stand for what he believes is right. Passion and new love collide with family values and the demands of tradition as Josh, Cheryth, and Josh's family find themselves questioning their lives. Love and loyalty look a lot different when examined from various positions. In the end, Josh follows a road of his own choosing and it leads to a future of his own making.http://www.variouspositions.net/synopsis.html References  External links  Canadian films Films shot in Vancouver 2002 films ","title":"Various Positions (film)"},{"id":"13274916","text":"Peggy B√ºchse (born 9 September 1972 in Rostock) is a former long-distance swimmer from Germany, who won her first international title at the 1987 European Junior Championships (400 m freestyle).

Jakhau Salt, the port of Jakhau, is situated a further 15 km westwards. History The village and port are named after the legendary Jakh Botera who were shipwrecked on the Kutch coast and came ashore at Jakhau. Variously described as tall and fair-complexioned with an advanced culture (hence why locals name them Yakshas-demigods), their traditional number is 72 with at least one woman. Their origins are obscure-but one school of thought is that they were of zerthotrians iraani or parsi origins and good at horsemenship, medicine and archery. One cruel king puanra is said to have been controlled/put to an end by them-thus they attained gods status in region. In the Middle Ages, Jakhau was a thriving port and warehousing village. However, as Godia Creek silted up and ships increased in size, trade went to the dredged port at Mandvi instead and south to Bombay (now Mumbai). Exports were mostly salt cotton, millet, and castor bean oil and later cloth and tobacco, while imports were mostly rice, lumber and dried fruit, and some sugar. The 1998 Gujarat cyclone helped to further destroy the port. The major occupation is now fishing. Demographics In the 2001 census, the village of Jakhau had 4,076 inhabitants, with 2,032 males (49.9%) and 2,044 females (50.1%), for a gender ratio of 1006 females per thousand males.

When Griffin was nine years old his family moved to Fort Worth, Texas. Upon graduation from Texas A&M; he was commissioned as an officer in the United States Air Force. He served four years on active duty, first in flight training, then flying as a weapon systems officer in jet fighter-interceptors. In 1960 Griffin left active duty and began his space career as a systems engineer/flight controller at the USAF Satellite Test Center in Sunnyvale, California. In 1964 Griffin joined NASA in Houston as a flight controller in Mission Control, specializing in guidance, navigation and control systems during Project Gemini. In 1968 he was named a Mission Control flight director and served in that role for all of the Apollo Program manned missions, including all nine manned missions out to the Moon, six of which included lunar landings. Griffin's \\"Gold\\" team conducted half of the lunar landings made during Apollo: Apollos 14, 16, and 17. His team was scheduled to conduct the landing of Apollo 13, but when the landing was cancelled as a result of the oxygen tank explosion, his team played a key role in the safe return of the astronauts. After the Apollo Program was completed Griffin served in other roles at NASA, first in multiple positions at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., then as the deputy director of the Dryden (now Armstrong) Flight Research Center in California, then as deputy director of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. In 1982 he returned to Houston as director of the Johnson Space Center. After taking early retirement from NASA in 1986 Griffin became a senior executive with several non-space, as well as space-related, companies and organizations in the private sector. Today Griffin remains active in several businesses at the senior level. He also is a technical and management consultant for a broad range of clients. Because of his real life role as a flight director during the troubled flight of Apollo 13, Griffin was a technical advisor for the 1995 film Apollo 13. Later he was a technical advisor and also acted in the films Contact (1997) and Deep Impact (1998), and was the technical advisor for the 2011 film Apollo 18. He is a member of the Screen Actors Guild. Griffin was played by actor David Clyde Carr in the 1998 HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon, . Griffin is an active general aviation pilot and aircraft owner, holding a commercial license with an instrument rating for single engine aircraft, multi-engine aircraft and helicopters. Early life and education Gerry and his twin brother, Richard L. \\"Larry\\" Griffin, were born on December 25, 1934 in Athens, Texas to parents Herschel Hayden Griffin (1903‚Äì1989) and Helen Elizabeth Boswell Griffin (1904‚Äì1947). The twins also had an older brother, Kenneth H. \\"Ken\\" Griffin (1925‚Äì2003). The family moved to Fort Worth, Texas in 1944, and Gerry graduated from Arlington Heights High School in 1952. While in high school Gerry continued his activities in the Boy Scouts of America and earned the rank of Eagle Scout in 1951 at the age of 16. In junior high school and high school Gerry also began his long association with the military through the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC), then the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC). In the fall of 1952 Gerry entered the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, now Texas A&M; University, to study aeronautical engineering. He was a member of the famed Texas A&M; Corps of Cadets for four years and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Air Force (USAF) upon graduation in 1956 with a Bachelor of Science degree. After graduation Gerry went to work for Douglas Aircraft Company in Long Beach, California, prior to being called to active duty by the USAF. Military duty =USAF training= Pre-Flight The USAF ordered Gerry to report for active duty on December 7, 1956 at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. This was a 30-day \\"Pre-Flight\\" period which included physical and psychological exams, orientation courses, drill, physical training, ejection seat training, etc. Primary-Basic Navigator Course At the end of Pre- Flight Gerry was ordered to Harlingen Air Force Base in Harlingen, Texas where he would undergo one year of primary and basic navigation training. This was one year of intense ground school and inflight aircraft training in the Convair T-29. All phases of day and night navigation were covered including dead reckoning, celestial, radio, and radar. In December 1957 Gerry was awarded his USAF Navigator Wings. Radar Fighter Interceptor Course Gerry chose the fighter interceptor path in order to eventually be able to fly in high-performance supersonic jet fighters. This advanced training was at James Connally Air Force Base in Waco, Texas and was six months in duration. Again, intense ground school was accompanied by inflight day and night intercept training, first in the North American B-25 Mitchell, then in the Northrop F-89D Scorpion. Finally, after a year and a half of primary, basic and advanced training was over! Gerry finished second in his class and was able to select the operational assignment he wanted: the 84th Fighter Interceptor Squadron (FIS) at Hamilton Air Force Base in Marin County, California...just north of the Golden Gate Bridge! =USAF Operations= 84th FIS, Hamilton Air Force Base, California The 84th FIS was a fighter squadron in the USAF Air Defense Command. Gerry arrived at the 84th FIS in June 1958 to serve as a Weapons Systems Officer, flying first in the Northrop F-89J Scorpion, a subsonic air defense fighter, and then in the McDonnell F-101B Voodoo a supersonic air defense fighter. Both aircraft carried two MB-1 Genie nuclear air-to-air missiles with 3.5 kiloton warheads. Both aircraft also carried two Hughes Falcon infra red heat seeking missiles with high explosive warheads. In 1960, while still serving in the 84th FIS, Gerry, on his own and in his spare time, began his general aviation career as a pilot by taking flying lessons at a local airport in nearby Novato, California. Gerry served in the 84th FIS for two and a half years before leaving active duty on December 26, 1960 at the rank of First Lieutenant. Gerry remained in the USAF Active Reserve until 1964 attaining the rank of Captain. He was then assigned to the USAF Inactive Reserve until 1974 when he was retired officially from the USAF Reserve. During four years on active duty and four years in the active reserve Gerry logged over 800 hours of military flight time. Pre-NASA Space Career =Lockheed Missile and Space Company (LMSC)= Immediately after leaving USAF active duty Gerry joined LMSC in January 1961 as a Missile Systems Engineer at the USAF Satellite Test Center (STC) in Sunnyvale, California. LMSC was the prime contractor for flight operations in the STC which controlled USAF satellites launched into polar orbit from Vandenberg AFB, California. This was the era of the early reconnaissance (spy) satellites with names such as Discoverer, MIDAS and SAMOS. This was Gerry's first experience as a real-time flight controller during launch, orbit, and entry of space vehicles. He performed systems analysis of the satellites and the Agena upper stage used on the Thor and Atlas launch vehicles. Gerry's primary areas of specialty were guidance, control and propulsion systems. =General Dynamics/Fort Worth (GD/FW)= In 1962 Gerry left LMSC after two years to return to his native Texas and become a Senior Aerosystems Engineer at GD/FW in Fort Worth, Texas. GD/FW, a long- time designer and developer of aircraft, was venturing into space systems studies and, hopefully, space hardware development in the future. Gerry was brought in to help in the space effort, but from the beginning he was involved in research and engineering tasks involving aircraft and spacecraft guidance and control systems for NASA and USAF customers. From May 5, 1961, the day astronaut Al Shepard rode the Freedom 7 spacecraft in a suborbital flight down the Atlantic Ocean from Cape Canaveral, Gerry's strong desire was to work at NASA as a flight controller in Mission Control. \\"Coming home to Texas\\" gave him the opportunity not only to work for a fine aerospace company, GD/FW, it also got him closer to Houston and the Manned Spacecraft Center! NASA career =NASA Manned Spacecraft Center= Project Gemini In June 1964 Gerry went to work at the Manned Spacecraft Center (renamed Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in 1973). Project Mercury had recently ended and Project Gemini was just beginning. The USAF Agena was to be used as a rendezvous and docking target for the Gemini, and because of his background with the Agena Gerry was hired as an Agena flight controller. However, the second (and final) unmanned test flight of the Gemini-Titan was about to take place at Cape Canaveral, and Gerry was diverted to become a Gemini flight controller in the position of \\"GNC\\": Guidance, Navigation & Control. He served as a GNC flight controller throughout the Gemini program, specializing in guidance, navigation, control and propulsion systems. At the completion of Project Gemini he was preparing for similar role for the Apollo program when the Apollo 1 fire occurred. Apollo Program Griffin (l) and other flight directors celebrate the Apollo 13 splashdown April 17, 1970 As a result of the Apollo 1 fire the Apollo mission schedule was delayed for 21 months. During the flight delay Gerry was named to be an Apollo flight director and served in that role for all of the Apollo Program manned missions. Gerry was lead flight director for three lunar missions: Apollo 12, Apollo 15, and Apollo 17. Gerry's \\"Gold\\" team controlled two Earth launches (Apollo 12 and Apollo 15), and half of Apollo's six lunar landings (Apollo's 14, 16, and 17). His team was scheduled to conduct the landing of Apollo 13, but when the landing was canceled as a result of the oxygen tank explosion, his team played a key role in the safe return of the astronauts. =NASA Headquarters= Assistant Administrator for Legislative Affairs Gerry was responsible for coordinating and orchestrating all NASA liaison activities with Congress. He served as the principal advisor to the Administrator and other NASA officials on matters involving relations with the Congress as well as state and local governments. Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Flight (Operations) Gerry was responsible for early Space Transportation Systems (STS) operations planning, the development of user policies, and the establishment of pricing policies. These initial STS operational concepts were incorporated in overall Agency planning for the Shuttle era and became the foundation for later STS operations. =NASA Dryden Flight Research Center= Deputy Director Gerry served as \\"general manager\\" of the NASA center responsible for aircraft flight research programs involving a wide variety of aeronautical and space technology. Major efforts involved the flight testing of high-speed aircraft and preparations for the Shuttle Approach and Landing Test Program. In addition to general management functions, his specific duties required a strong interface with USAF flight research/test activities. =NASA Kennedy Space Center= Deputy Director Gerry served as the \\"general manager\\" of NASA's center for launch operations for unmanned and manned systems. KSC was a 140,000-acre installation with an original plant value of $1.8 billion, a workforce of 2,200 civil servants and 10,000 support contractors and an annual budget of $550 million. During this period KSC was the launch site for the unmanned Delta and Atlas-Centaur launch vehicles and the April 1981 first launch of the Space Shuttle. =Scott Science & Technology, Inc.= Vice President Gerry had responsibility for systems engineering and general management functions of the company, a small R&D; organization involved in high-technology products manufacturing and testing, research studies, management systems consultation and classified support contact work for the Department of Defense manned space flight activities. =NASA Johnson Space Center= Director Gerry was responsible for NASA's prime center for manned space flight R&D; and operations. The workforce included 3,200 civil servants and 10,000 support contractors. He was responsible for a budget of $1.5 billion per year and a diverse array of unique facilities. Griffin led the successful effort to bring the full Shuttle capability to operational status and played a key role in securing Presidential and Congressional approval for the development of the International Space Station. Private Sector Career =Greater Houston Chamber of Commerce= President and CEO Gerry was responsible for the total operation of the Greater Houston Chamber of Commerce, one of the largest chambers of commerce in the United States. His duties included external and internal functions. External functions included developing and executing a board-approved program of work aimed at regional improvements and economic development. Internal functions included budget planning and control, membership development and staffing. =Korn Ferry International= Managing Director, Houston Office Gerry was responsible for leading and directing the operation of the Houston office of Korn/Ferry International.

The tabling of the report concluded the committee's inquiry. It provided a tangible definition of the concept of sustainability that can serve as a pathway for Australian cities to be vibrant and productive urban regions that are environmentally responsible and socially inclusive at the same time. Conclusions The report states that in order for an Australian city to be considered sustainable, it must aim to: * \\"Conserve bushland, significant heritage and urban green zones; * \\"Ensure equitable access to and efficient use of energy, including renewable energy sources; * \\"Establish an integrated sustainable water and stormwater management system addressing capture, consumption, treatment and re-use opportunities; * \\"Manage and minimise domestic and industrial waste; * \\"Develop sustainable transport networks, nodal complementarity and logistics; * \\"Incorporate eco-efficiency principles into new buildings and housing; and * \\"Provide urban plans that accommodate lifestyle, employment and business opportunities.\\" A key recommendation within this report was that the Australian Government establish an independent Australian Sustainability Commission headed by a National Sustainability Commissioner. This was restated in 2007 when the Committee presented its report on the inquiry into a sustainability charter entitled Sustainability for survival: creating a climate for change. The report also recommended the creation of an Australian Sustainability Charter, which would set national targets across a number of areas, including water, transport, building design and planning.

The category does not comprise a single ethnic group but is instead a method of identification for white people who are not represented by other white census categories. This means that the Other White group contains a diverse collection of people with different countries of birth, languages and religions. In 2011, the Scottish Government introduced the category White Polish to differentiate Polish Britons, and Polish residents, living in Scotland from this broad grouping. The categorisation was primarily intended to cover people with ancestry from Continental Europe, with the largest represented ethnic groups being Poles (except in Scotland since 2011), Germans, Romanians, Italians and the French.2011 Census: KS202EW National identity, local authorities in England and Wales, Accessed 22 December 2012 It also appears that people with European ancestry (or who otherwise identify as white), born outside of the continent, are significantly represented in the White Other category. In 2001, the United States, South Africa and Australia were in the top ten birthplaces, together representing over 15 percent of the category. Along with White British and White Irish, the category does not appear in Northern Ireland, where only one single \\"White\\" classification was presented to respondents.  Demographics  =Birthplace= In the 2001 UK Census, the majority of people living in England and Wales ticking the 'Other White' ethnic group specified their ethnicity as European. Four out of five of the 'Other White' category (i.e. not British or Irish) were born overseas. A third were born in a Western European country other than the UK, and one in seven were born in an Eastern European country. Outside of Europe, countries derived from former British colonies such as the United States, South Africa and Australia were among the top ten birthplaces (which included the UK itself). This suggested that, in 2001, significant numbers of American Britons, South African Britons, and Australian Britons, such as those born abroad to British parents and returned to the UK as minors, identified as White Other. It may also be that those who identify as white Americans, white South Africans, or white Australians have migrated to the country as adults. =Economic status= The Other White group is largely of working age, with only one in ten aged over 65 and one in seven under 16 at the time of the 2001 census. This does vary according to the stated country of birth, with people born in the UK being disproportionately young. Polish and Italian respondents had a larger proportion of over 65s, which reflects the migration of Poles and Italians to Britain after the Second World War. A wide number of religions are represented in the Other White group. =Religion= In the census, the largest faith group, 63 per cent, identified themselves as Christian, with 16 per cent defining themselves as without religion, nine per cent as Muslims, and two per cent as Jewish.

Description The species is a shrub up to 3 metres in height. It has narrow-ovate leaves which are 1.4 to 6 cm long and 0.4 to 2 cm in length. Distinctive purple-black pendulous pea-flowers are produced from early spring to early summer (September to December in Australia). It is not known whether this species shares the toxic properties of many other members of the genus Gastrolobium. Taxonomy The species was first formally described in 1864 by botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. He gave it the name Brachysema melanopetalum, the specific epithet being derived from the Greek words melanos (black) and petalon, alluding to the dark-coloured flowers. In 1995, botanist Michael Crisp placed the species in the genus Gastrolobium along with a number of other Brachysema species. Distribution This species is usually found in thickets growing near streams or freshwater swamps. It occurs south of Perth between the Darling Scarp and the Blackwood River.

The first-born of 10 siblings, he had lived in Norway for more than 20 years. Obiora's name entered the public limelight in Norway after he died during a police arrest at a social services office, √òstbyen Servicekontor, in Trondheim. He was there to complain against his being denied welfare (financial aid). According to early news reports Obiora threatened and photographed the staff, and police were subsequently called in. When Obiora refused to leave the premises and resisted arrest, a scuffle ensued where a strangle hold was employed by one of the arresting officers. Shortly thereafter Obiora lost consciousness and was subsequently transported to the local hospital by the police. He was pronounced dead despite resuscitation attempts. The nurses who received the police patrol car have stated in police interviews that he was positioned \\"completely limp on his stomach face down on the floor of the supervisor vehicle.\\" The case made headlines locally and nationally, with accusations of unnecessary use of force and racism leveled at the local police, as well as uproar in African societies in Norway. Cause of death According to an article in the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten in June 2007, the autopsy report (Nordrum and Haugen) gives the following commentary on the cause of death: \\"The chain of events indicate that the deceased, who was most likely in a state of strong emotional upheaval, has found himself in a situation that was highly detrimental to his respiration by first having been subjected to a 'strangle hold' and then to have been placed on his stomach having first been handcuffed.\\" The article went on citing additional statements from the forensic examiners which said that tests performed with healthy individuals show that a person's lung capacity is reduced by 40% when strapped down on the stomach for three minutes. The autopsy report also mentions English expert literature in which positioning-related suffocation is described in connection with police work, in psychiatric settings and during ambulance transport. In the report from the Norwegian Bureau for the Investigation of Police Affairs the cause of death is established to be strangulation. The report notes that point bleeding, internal bleeding of the neck muscles, as well as fracture of the thyroid cartilage all occurred as results of the chokehold, and then goes on to conclude that the injuries caused shortness of breath, but that they alone did not cause suffocation. The Special Unit in summary finds that there has not been consciously performed \\"any one act which stopped/hindered\\" Obiora from breathing. The report goes on stating that it cannot be ruled out that Obiora's death \\"could have been avoided if the officers had had knowledge about possible dangers of using the stomach position\\". Renewed interest The media scrutiny intensified when information was uncovered that the officer who held Obiora in a strangle hold had also been involved in an incident in 1999 with a Ghanaian woman, Sophia Baidoo that some felt where similar. The incident was filmed by a bank security camera, and the officer was later cleared of all charges. The case took a new turn after the band Samvirkelaget produced a CD which included the song \\"Stopp Volden\\" (Stop the Violence/Stop Volden) in which one of the officers who took part in the incident was named. The Norwegian Police Federation sued the band to have the release stopped. The court did not find grounds for issuing an injunction. Nevertheless, it stated that the publicizing of the name of the policeman was libelous. The Norwegian Police Federation was considering suing Samvirkelaget for slander. The case was heard and settled in favour of Samvirkelaget. S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag police district filed a libel complaint on May 2, 2007 against a blog for having identified the previously mentioned officer by giving his name as well as picture in connection with the case. Police investigation The case was investigated by the Bureau for the Investigation of Police Affairs but was abandoned on May 4, 2007 concluding that in the case of three officers there was insufficient evidence to pursue an indictment, a fourth officer, identified as the chauffeur of the patrol car was cleared of any involvement. The Middle Norway Special Unit recommended however that the National Police Directorate be cited with corporate punishment for insufficient police education and training concerning the dangers of stomach positioning and leglock. However, the national chief of the Special Unit for Police Affairs did not follow up on this recommendation. All this caused 1100 people to protest in a rally in Trondheim on May 8, 2007, and in simultaneous protests in Trondheim and Oslo on May 19. An eyewitness, Ghulam Ali, spoke at the rally giving his version of what took place on the day of Obiora's death, when he saw the incident from a distance and heard the screams from Obiora who had been placed on the ground by the police. Demand for prosecution of police officers In May 2007 the next of kin of Eugene Obiora appealed the dismissal of the investigation against the arresting officers to the Norwegian Attorney General, and on June 28 the Attorney General ordered the Special Unit for Police Affairs to instigate a new and more thorough investigation of the case. Lawyer Abid Q. Raja, representing Eugene Obiora's surviving family, has demanded that the three arresting officers be charged with willful homicide in the case. Raja has also asserted that one of the officers involved in the arrest teaches arrest techniques at the Norwegian Police University College, a position which should have made the officer especially aware of the consequences of abuse of force. Meanwhile, a lawyer representing the three police officers has stated that Raja is misrepresenting the facts of the case when he repeatedly asserts that Obiora was killed as a direct result of the police using a controversial grip around his throat. \\"Opinion has been comprehensively misinformed through sensational media coverage. Raja has from the very first said that a policeman has used a stranglehold and that this is the sole cause of death. This is fundamentally incorrect and has led to a public persecution of this officer,\\" the lawyer says. Consequences of the Obiora case As a direct consequence of the case, training at the Norwegian Police Academy has undergone changes and national police director Ingelin Killengreen has instigated a thorough review of police methods generally. The policemen who are involved in the case told the Trondheim daily Adresseavisen in mid-September 2007 that they would urge the central police leadership to implement routines for temporary reassigning officers involved in cases such as the Obiora case, where three of the officers have remained in their positions during the investigations and the fourth was reassigned based on his own initiative. The officers state that they understand how the public would be upset when such reassignments are not implemented. They emphasize however that there would have to be a change of the rules for this to become routine as otherwise a reassignment would be perceived, both by the officers and by the public at large, as a censure. S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag police chief Per Marum has on several occasions responded to claims that the officers be suspended that according to the Norwegian civil servant act this can only be effected when existing information exists that could lead to dismissal. Also in mid- September 2007, the leader of the Special Unit for Police Affairs, Jan Egil Presthus, stated to the Oslo daily Dagsavisen that all investigations into police conduct of cases that have ended in deaths are going to be posted on the Internet. He states that a total openness in this way will strengthen the publics confidence in the unit's integrity and ability to conduct its investigations impartially. This comes following Dagsavisen's listing in June of police cases with a deadly result. Since the Special Unit's establishment on January 1, 2005 the investigation into ten of the most serious cases were concluded, in all 10 cases leading to all charges against the police being dropped. A buzzing media discourse focusing on deaths incurred during police arrests and transports has been going on in Norway throughout 2007, and Presthus counts this as one factor triggering the initiative to publish ongoing investigations on the Internet.

The Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos had sent his illegitimate daughter Maria Palaiologina to be the bride of Hulagu Khan, Abaqa's predecessor. Hulagu died before she arrived, and she was thus wed instead to Abaqa. She became a popular religious figure to the Mongols, who had previously looked to Doquz Khatun, Hulagu's wife, as a religious leader. After the death of Doquz, this sentiment turned to Maria, who was called \\"Despina Khatun\\". Clement and James had been encouraged by this, towards the possibility that the Mongols might join the Europeans in a Franco-Mongol alliance against the Muslims. From Viterbo in 1267, they sent a letter, carried by Jayme Alaric de Perpignan. It was responding positively to previous messages from the Mongols, and informed Abaqa of the upcoming Crusade (the Eighth Crusade). However, Abaqa was distracted by wars with other sections of the Mongol Empire, and would only make vague promises of assistance.Runciman, pp. 331-332 Jayme Alaric would return to Europe in 1269, accompanied by a Mongol embassy.

Weldon became a confidante and the personal secretary to the Lakota Sioux Indian leader Sitting Bull during the time when Plains Indians had adopted the Ghost Dance movement. Early life and education Caroline Weldon was born Susanna Karolina Faesch on 4 December 1844 in Kleinbasel, Canton Basel, Switzerland.Faesch Familien Archiv, Staatsarchiv des Kantons Basel, Basel, Switzerland, (Ref. StABS, PA397a, Gerichtsarchiv U152, Uc7) Her father was Johann Lukas Faesch, a career Swiss mercenary military officer serving in a Swiss regiment in France; her mother was Anna Maria Barbara, n√©e Marti. She was a member of the Faesch family, who were part of the Swiss nobility. She arrived in America in 1852, together with her mother, settling in Brooklyn. That year, her mother was remarried to the exiled German revolutionary and physician, Dr. Karl Heinrich Valentiny, who ran a medical practice in Brooklyn. In 1866, Susanna Carolina Faesch was married in Brooklyn to Dr. Bernhard Claudius Schlatter, a physician and fellow Swiss. Her marriage to Schlatter remained childless and was an unhappy one. In June 1876 she ran away with a married man identified in court records as Christopher J. Stevenson. Living with Stevenson briefly in a rented apartment in Hoboken, NJ, she gave birth to a child in late 1876 or early 1877, a boy she named Christie. However her romantic relationship with Stevenson did not last for he would soon abandon her to return to his wife of many years. Caroline was compelled to return to Brooklyn to live with her mother and stepfather. Her estranged husband Bernhard Schlatter filed for divorce which was granted in 1883.Superior Court, New York County, volume 62, pp. 177 ff. Divorce Record Schlatter vs. Schlatter 1883, New York State Supreme Court, Civil Branch, 31 Chamber Street, 7th Floor, New York NY 10007Caroline Weldon genealogy http://worldconnect.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi- bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db;=caroline_weldon&id;=I03 Career Sitting Bull by D F Barry ca 1883 original cabinet card Weldon pursued her interests in art. After her divorce from her husband and having been abandoned by her lover she became committed to the cause of Native Americans. Upon the death of her mother in 1887 she had inherited some money which gave her the means to freely pursue her interests. Sometime thereafter she changed her name to Caroline Weldon, presumably to allow her to put her past behind her, although her exact reasons for this action remain unknown. In the summer of 1889 Caroline Weldon traveled to Dakota Territory to fulfill her dream of living among the Sioux. She had joined NIDA, the National Indian Defense Association, headed by Dr. Thomas Bland and his wife Cora Bland, embarking on a quest to aid the Sioux in their struggle to fight the US government's attempt under the Dawes Act to expropriate vast portions of the Great Sioux Reservation for the purpose of opening some up for white settlement and with the intent of rendering the creations of the two new states of North Dakota and South Dakota economically viable. She befriended Sitting Bull, leader of the traditionalist faction among the Sioux acting as his secretary, interpreter and advocate. After she had moved with her young son Christie to live at Sitting Bull‚Äôs compound on the Grand River at Standing Rock Indian Reservation, her confrontations and open defiance of Indian Agent James McLaughlin did not endear her to the general public. McLaughlin initiated a smear campaign, resulting in her being hated and reviled by much of the white community and vilified in the national press. When in the summer of 1890 the Ghost Dance Movement swept through the Indian Reservations of the West she denounced it and warned Sitting Bull that it would give the government an excuse to harm him and to summon the military for intervention which would result in the destruction of the Sioux Nation. Sitting Bull turned against her and upon her son falling ill in November she decided to leave. The subsequent events of Sitting Bull‚Äôs murder and the Wounded Knee massacre the following December proved her right, adding to her sense of futility and failure. Her son died on 19 November 1890, while on the riverboat Chaska near Pierre, SD. She had been on her way to her new home in Kansas City, MO. She lived briefly in the latter city with her nephew Friedrich William Schleicher, a school teacher, only to return eventually to Brooklyn. She disappeared into obscurity soon after.Pollack, Eileen.

Rachmaninoff dedicated the work to his friend the violinist Fritz Kreisler. He wrote to another friend, the composer Nikolai Medtner, on 21 December 1931:R.D.

Used most frequently in The Gambia, Senegal, Guinea, and Mali, and also in Ivory Coast, the term can be derogatory by itself, but it is also frequently associated with \\"wealthy traveler\\" (if one can afford to travel, one must be rich). The word can also be applied to any perceived traveler, even those of black African descent with a different phenotype, up to foreign-raised locals (thus with a different accent) or visiting expatriates. In Alex Haley's book Roots, the word is spelled \\"toubob\\", and the phrase \\"toubob fa\\" (kill toubob) is used several times. In God's Bits of Wood, authored by Senegalese Sembene Ousmane, the natives call the French colonizers toubab (singular) or toubabs (plural). In the fourth episode of the miniseries ROOTS, Kizzy refers to her slave masters as \\"toubab,\\" or white. A verb in the Wolof language means \\"to convert\\" (missionaries during colonial times, being whites coming from Europe). The word could have derived from the two bob (two shillings) coin of pre-decimalization United Kingdom.  Related  In Ghana the word used for a white person or foreigner is Obroni in the local languages, of the Akan family. In Nigeria, the word used for a 'white' person is Oyibo. In Togo and Benin, the word used for a white person is 'yovo'. In Burkina Faso, the word for a white person is 'nassara‚Äô in moore, the most spoken native tongue. Otherwise ‚Äútoubabou‚Äù is the word for a white person in Dioula, bambara or mandinka spoken mostly in the West of the country. In East Africa and Eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the word used for a white or foreign person is \\"muzungu\\". In both the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo, the word used for a white person is \\"mondele\\" or \\"mundele\\".

New York: HarperCollins Publishers 1992 The wide-ranging volume encompasses Welles's life and his own stage, radio and film work as well as his insights on the work of others. The interview book was transcribed by Bogdanovich after Welles's death, at the request of Welles's longtime companion and professional collaborator, Oja Kodar. In addition to more than 300 pages of interviews, the book includes an annotated chronology of Welles's career; a summary of the alterations made in Welles's 1942 masterpiece, The Magnificent Ambersons; and notes on each chapter by film scholar Jonathan Rosenbaum, who edited the volume. A second edition of This is Orson Welles was published in paperback in 1998, with a new introduction by Bogdanovich and excerpts of a 58-page memo Welles wrote Universal Pictures about the editing of his 1958 film Touch of Evil. The memo was used to create a director's cut of the film released in 1998. The 1992 audiobook version of This is Orson Welles was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word or Non-Musical Album.\\"Rock to opera, a full list of nominees\\"; USA Today, January 8, 1993 Origin In 1961 Peter Bogdanovich organized a retrospective of Orson Welles's films, the first in the United States, for the Museum of Modern Art. Welles was not able to attend ‚Äî he was in Europe, preparing a film ‚Äî but he did read the monograph Bogdanovich had written to accompany the screening and was favorably impressed by it. In 1968 Welles phoned Bogdanovich to invite him for coffee at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Over the space of two hours the two filmmakers found themselves completely at ease with each other. As they left the restaurant, Welles flipped through the pages of a book Bogdanovich had just written about John Ford, Welles's favorite director; Bogdanovich had brought a copy as a gift, since Welles was quoted in its pages. \\"Isn't it too bad,\\" Welles said, \\"that you can't do a nice little book like this about me.\\" They decided to do a book of interviews together. \\"Of course it was Welles who suggested the shape of 'the book,' as we called it ‚Äî we never did arrive at a title we both liked,\\" Bogdanovich wrote. Recorded at intervals in the United States, Mexico and Europe, the interviews were not to be forced into the chronological order of Welles's life. Welles felt they should be more loosely organized, like their conversations. Bogdanovich transcribed the reel-to-reel tapes, organized the interviews into a chapter, and mailed the typed copy to Welles. Months later, Bogdanovich would get the chapter back from Welles, revised and sometimes rewritten. Some chapters were revised two or three times in this manner. In 1974, Orson Welles cast Bogdanovich in the role of Brooks Otterlake, a successful director, in the unreleased film The Other Side of the Wind. Welles filmed partly in Bogdanovich's Bel Air home, where Welles and actress Oja Kodar lived off and on for two years. Work on the book continued intermittently through 1975; later in the 1970s the two directors \\"drifted apart a bit,\\" Bogdanovich later wrote. For a time, the book was put on hold by Welles when he received a separate offer of $250,000 to write his memoirs. \\"He had no choice but to agree,\\" Bogdanovich wrote. \\"This was OK with me; it was his life and one of the few ways he had of getting money to pay not only for his family's expenses, but also for the real work he was doing ‚Äî his many directing projects.\\"Welles, Orson, and Peter Bogdanovich, This is Orson Welles, page xxvii. Bogdanovich and Welles had already taken advances for their joint effort from two publishers. Then, Bogdanovich wrote, the book was literally lost for five years: :Orson never did write his memoirs. Eventually, when he asked what had become of our book, it was lost somewhere in the depths of a storage facility while I was going through a personal and financial crisis (leading to bankruptcy and a kind of general breakdown in the summer of 1985, just a few months before Orson died). During one phone conversation he had said he hoped I wouldn't \\"just publish\\" the book after he was dead ‚Äî implying that I knew where it was and was just hanging on to it. That upset me and so when we finally could get back into storage, and the boxes turned up, I sent all of them over to Orson ‚Äî not keeping copies of anything ‚Äî with a note saying, in effect, it was his life, and here it was for him to do as he saw fit. Orson called me as soon as he got it ‚Äîhe was very touched, he said, and thanked me profusely. He went on to explain that there wasn't much he could leave to Oja, and if anything happened to him, he was planning to will the book to her.\\" After Welles died in October 1985, Oja Kodar asked Bogdanovich to help prepare the book for publication. He transcribed the materials, resulting in 1,400 pages that were then edited by Jonathan Rosenbaum into the 300 pages of interviews in the book. Reception =Reviews and commentary= * Todd McCarthy, Variety ‚Äî The book in question, which is based on hours of conversation between Welles and Peter Bogdanovich, is one I have been eagerly awaiting for fully 20 years, since Bogdanovich first told me about it on the set of Paper Moon. ‚Ä¶ The extravagantly rich result represents as detailed a reading of Welles' view of his own screen career as I could ever hope for. ‚Ä¶ The publisher, HarperCollins, has simultaneously released a four- pack volume of audio cassettes under the same title that includes four hours of the Welles‚ÄìBogdanovich interview. Some of the material overlaps, but much of it is different from what can be found in the book. And, in any event, it is great just to hear Welles telling these revealing stories himself, in his deep voice and with his infectious laugh.McCarthy, Todd, \\"Deep Focus: 'This is Orson Welles' sure to please aficionados\\". Daily Variety, October 23, 1992 * Michael Dwyer, The Irish Times ‚Äî A lively, entertaining and fascinating collection of conversations between Welles and the critic turned director, Peter Bogdanovich, who initiated the project partly to redress the balance after \\"three very damaging books\\" about Welles appeared in the late 1960s. ‚Ä¶ This is the best book of its kind since Fran√ßois Truffaut's classic book of interviews with Alfred Hitchcock.Dwyer, Michael, \\"Moving pictures in words: Michael Dwyer with the pick of 1993's books on the cinema\\"; The Irish Times, December 11, 1993 * The Observer ‚Äî The creation of this book was itself uncannily like a Welles film: created in fragments, abandoned, then lost, then finally restored by another hand.

Frisians are a Germanic ethnic group native to the coastal parts of the Netherlands and Germany. They are closely related to the Dutch, Northern Germans, and the English and speak Frisian languages divided by geographical regions. The Old Frisian language was once the closest Germanic language to Old English, though outside influences (from Dutch on Frisian and from Norman French on English) have made both languages grow ever farther apart than they naturally would have as they were developing separately. Today there exists a tripartite division of the original Frisians; namely the North Frisians, East Frisians and West Frisian, caused by the Frisia's constant loss of territory in the Middle Ages, but the West Frisians in the general do not feel or see themselves as part of a larger group of Frisians, and, according to a 1970 inquiry, identify themselves more with the Dutch than with East or North Frisians.Frisia. 'Facts and fiction' (1970), by D. Tamminga. Therefore the moniker 'Frisian' is (when used for the speakers of all three Frisian language) a linguistic (and to some extent, cultural) concept, not a political one. In the New Netherland colony, Frisian people from North Frisia, East Frisia and West Friesland were the largest ethnic group in the city of New Amsterdam which later became New York City. The New Amsterdam area was chiefly explored by one Jonas Bronk who led a group of settlers from North Frisia, and the region was later named The Bronx after him. Bronk (also known as Bronck) himself is said to have been either Danish or Swedish. Many North-Frisian settlers were refugees of the Burchardi flood of 1634 which had destroyed the wealthy island of Strand. According to Paulsen, \\"they introduced their old democratic traditions into the patrician Dutch society of that time.\\" Because there is no modern united Frisian state, Frisian Americans are often included within Dutch Americans, German Americans or Scandinavian Americans.

On 8 August 1884, he married Maude Davey, daughter of John Dobson (surveyor) from Oxford. Member of Parliament Headstone for Thomas Davey From between the general elections of 1902 and 1905, Davey was one of the three members of parliament representing the multi-member City of Christchurch electorate. He had been presented with a petition to stand for parliament and came third out of nine contenders in this three-member electorate, behind Tommy Taylor and Harry Ell. In 1905, these multi-member electorates were split up, and he won the Christchurch East electorate against three other contenders: William Whitehouse Collins (who had previously been in Parliament for the Liberal Party), Henry Toogood (a young engineer who only recently left Canterbury College and who would become one of the founding members of the Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand), and Frederick Cooke (a prominent member of the Socialist Party). Davey held Christchurch East to 1914, when he retired. Like Harry Ell, Davey showed an independent attitude towards the Liberal Government. He demanded an elective executive, and said that Premier Richard Seddon held too many portfolios. He also believed that the Cabinet should be reconstructed.: n.p. Nonetheless, Davey is listed as a member of the Liberal Party in Wilson's New Zealand Parliamentary Record : 1840‚Äì1984. Davey was elected Mayor of St Albans in 1897. He was a member of the Hospital Board and the Board of Canterbury College. The Lyttelton Times parliamentary correspondent described Davey as: \\"tall, straight, solidly built ‚Äì the best Mayor St. Albans ever had\\".: n.p.

The entire route is rural two-lane highway that passes through farmland and residential properties. SR 167 was originally introduced in the 1931 routed along its modern routing. The entire was paved by the mid-1960s. Route description SR 167 begins at an intersection between Walnut Street (SR 67) and Mississinewa Avenue, in the city of Albany in Delaware County. From there the road continues northeast on Mississinewa Avenue through a mix of residential neighborhoods and farmland for about before leaving the city of Albany. After leaving Albany SR 167 enters unincorporated Delaware County, passing through rural farmland as a two-lane highway. The road enters Dunkirk following Main Street, passing through the downtown of the city. The street crosses a Norfolk Southern Railway track, before leaving downtown Dunkirk. North of downtown Main Street curves due north near the West Jay County Middle School and forms the border between Blackford and Jay Counties. The SR 167 designation ends at an intersection with SR 26 east of Hartford City, but the roadway continues north as a county road. No segment of State Road 167 in Indiana is included in the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The highway is maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) like all other state roads in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state roads as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2013, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 4324 vehicles used the highway daily along Main Street on the south end of Dunkirk and 784 vehicles did so each day near the northern end of SR 167, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. History SR 167 was first designated in 1931. The original routing started in Albany and ran north through Dunkirk to SR 26 much as it does today. The entire road was either gravel or stone surface, until 1940 when the state highway commissioned desired to paved the road south of Dunkirk. This paving was completed by 1942.

The original company produced motorcycles from 1952, funded by a contract with the Ministry of Pensions for their Invacar, a three-wheeler for disabled drivers. After many wins in motorcycle trials competitions and developing a successful US export market, the original company ceased trading following a fire in 1977. Richard Deal bought the rights to the Greeves name in May 1999. The new business continues to develop motorcycles and launched the first new Greeves trials bike for 20 years in January 2009, with an all-new British two-stroke 280 cc engine. History Invacar model 70 The original company founded by Bert Greeves MBE was the Invacar company. Greeves was mowing the lawns of his home in Worcestershire when he had the idea of fitting the lawnmower engine to his disabled cousin's wheelchair and invented the Invacar. Invacar Ltd was set up and won a major contract to provide motorised three-wheeled invalid carriage vehicles to the UK Government Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance. in 1952 from a small factory in Church Road, Thundersley not far from Southend on Sea in Essex. Encouraged by this success, Bert Greeves decided to diversify into motorcycle manufacture. A keen trials rider in his spare time, he had started collecting veteran and vintage motorcycles, including a 1912 Triumph with the registration 'OLD 1'. His disabled cousin Derry Preston-Cobb also encouraged him to start the motorcycle business. Derry's own Invacar was used as a promotional vehicle and had been fitted with a more powerful engine, which used to amaze other drivers as he overtook them on the Southend roads. Working together they developed a prototype using a two-stroke single-cylinder engine sourced from Villiers Engineering - and a Greeves badge on the fuel tank. The motorcycles were really a sideline for the main business of producing the three-wheeled invalid cars, so development of the prototypes had to be fitted in when the production schedule allowed. Bert had been an enthusiastic motorcyclist in his youth and always had an ambition to become a motorcycle manufacturer. The first Greeves motorcycle was developed in mid-1951, using rubber-in-torsion springing at both front and rear. This unconventional rubber springing came straight from the patented system used for the invalid car. Rear wheel suspension was by a pivoted fork with rods connecting to torsion rubber mounted units just below the seat. Friction dampers were also fitted which could be manually adjusted. The front forks were also unusual, with short leading links to carry the wheel, pivoting on rubber-in-torsion spring units (later known as the 'Banana Leading Link' front fork. Motorcycle production began in the autumn of 1953 and the new models featured a unique frame with the steering head and a massive front down member combined in a large 'I-section' cast alloy beam, cast in a new light-alloy foundry that had been added to the Greeves factory. The tubular frame member was inserted into a mould and the main frame was cast around it, making for a very strong frame. Made from LM6 silicon-aluminium alloy, it was claimed to be stronger than tubular steel and proved capable of standing up to the rough treatment of international off-road trials competition. Protection was finished off with reinforced engine cradle plates which were also light alloy castings. Derry Preston-Cobb was made Sales Manager for the motorcycle business and they started with three models, a scrambler, a three speed road bike and a four-speed version. At the 1954 Earls Court Show, they also launched the 'Fleetwing', a two-cylinder two-stroke with a 242 cc British Anzani engine developed from those used for motor boats and featuring a crankshaft with a hollow midsection that acted as a rotary inlet valve. With a top speed of just , the Fleetwing continued in production until 1956 when the stock of British Anzani engines was finally exhausted. The Fleetwing name was brought back in 1957, however, for the Villiers engined model. This was more powerful than the earlier Fleetwing and now had a more respectable top speed of . Gearboxes were supplied by Albion Engineering Co. of Birmingham, Albion Engineering Co. Grace's Industrial guide later replaced by their own designs from 1964 forward. Greeves History greeves-riders.org.uk The lightweight high powered package made them successful in the trials market place against Triumph and BSA models. By 1962 there were eleven models in the Greeves range. The offroad motorcycles were also developed through an association with Queen's University Belfast producing the later Greeves QUB model. The last of the Challenger models was produced in 1968, replaced by the 250 and 380 cc Griffon motocrossers in 1969. The original leading link fork was no longer fitted, having been replaced by standard telescopic forks as the leading link design could not match the travel of forks. Also abandoned was the original cast alloy front down beam, replaced with a new frame of Reynolds 531 chrome molybdenum with a conventional down tube. Greeves also built a successful export business and at one time most of the motorcycles produced were going to the United States. Greeves became so successful in the US that they had a significant influence on the growth of the off-road biking sport and with the invention of the trail bike with their road legal off-roader, the Ranger. Competition success It was off-road competition that was to dominate Greeves production, and in 1956 Greeves signed motocross rider Brian Stonebridge and started competing in the European Motocross Championship. Stonebridge became the company Competitions Manager and Development Engineer, as he was a skilled two-stroke tuning specialist and was able to significantly improve the performance of the Villiers engines. In April 1957 Brian Stonebridge managed to beat the 500 cc bikes on the much smaller capacity Greeves round the demanding and hilly Hawkstone Park course, winning the 350 cc race and coming second in the 500 cc race, establishing Greeves' reputation as true off-road competition motorcycles. The next Greeves model was called the 'Hawkstone'; to capitalise on this success and the company began to specialise in motocross motorcycles, ridden by champions including Peter Hammond, Jack Simpson and Norman Sloper. Stonebridge led a three-man Greeves team to the West German International Six Days Trial event in 1958 and had a faultless ride, winning another gold medal. In October 1959, tragedy struck the Greeves team when Brian Stonebridge was killed in a car accident. Bert Greeves was at the wheel and Stonebridge was in the passenger seat when they crashed returning from a visit to a factory in Bradford. In a head-on collision Bert was only slightly injured but in the days before seat belts it proved fatal for Brian, who died at the scene of the accident. After the death of Stonebridge, Greeves signed Dave Bickers, who won the 1960 and 1961 250 cc championship.Greeves History Frank Conley's The company went on to win the Manx Grand Prix, the Scott Trial, the European Trials Championship and the Scottish Six Days Trial, winning gold medals in the ISDT and the ACU 250 cc Road Race. Bert Greeves also managed to sign up Bill Wilkinson, the Yorkshire trials rider who made the headlines when he won the British Experts Trail competition in 1960, the first time it had ever been won on a two-stroke motorcycle and a significant result for the Greeves factory. Greeves 250DCX Sportsman 1962 In 1963 the Greeves range still included the 25DC Sports Twin and two new models with the latest glass fibre tanks and handlebar fairings, as well as plastic mudguards. These were the 25DD 'Essex' and the 250 DCX 'Sportsman'. The same year the Greeves factory was asked to provide the motorcycles for the British ISDT team. This was significant because the team had previously relied on four-stroke vertical twins. Greeves produced three special machines for the event, which was held in the Czechoslovakian mountains. The engines were highly modified Villiers MK 36A but instead of the standard Villiers crankshaft they had an Alpha assembly and the squared-off cylinder barrels and heads were cast in Bert Greeves' own foundry and painted with matt black heat-dispersing paint. Although one of the riders, Triss Sharp, had starting problems, his brother Brian Sharp and the third rider Peter Stirland both won gold medals. The only woman to compete in the event, Mary Driver, was also riding a Greeves machine and won a bronze medal. Greeves Silverstone 250 cc, mid 1960s style with correct-appearance top half fairing at a Classic meeting, Cadwell Park, Lincolnshire, England in 2010 Greeves also made a successful entry into road racing with the 250 cc Silverstone model. These were a production Clubman's model with a reputation for reliability and were chosen to be the standard motorcycles for the Mortimer-Beart Road Racing School. When winning the 1964 Manx Grand Prix, London-based Rhodesian Gordon Keith also took the Greeves racer to the fastest lap of the race - his last of the four-lap race - at , which proved to be the best speed ever by a British 250 cc motorcycle, with a race-average of .

Retrieved 9 November 2015 This was a Cotton frame, a highly developed Starmaker engine and Bultaco forks. As well as a boost for the Greeves factory, this was an important win when the sport was beginning to become dominated by foreign motorcycles. This led to a lot of interest in the Greeves road bikes, including from a number of British Police forces for a version of the bigger twin equipped with a radio. Also in 1964 Greeves launched the 'Challenger', and first time out ridden by Garth Wheldon it won the Terry Cups Trail. In 1967, a version of the successful Challenger was launched, together with a road racer, a 350 cc version of the Silverstone, called the 'Oulton'. A special export model called the 'Ranger' was also developed but by 1968 Villiers had pulled out of engine production and Greeves decided to leave the trail-motorcycle market to concentrate on the development of a motocross model. End of an era As the Japanese entered the market place, with Suzuki dominating the European Championships from 1970 to 1973, sales began to slow. Greeves received an important order to supply motorcycles for the Royal Artillery Motorcycle Display Team and developed the 'Greeves Griffons', but a change in the law meant that the Invacar, which had been the mainstay of the company (even at the peak of motorcycle production Bert Greeves still answered the telephone as \\"Invacar Limited\\") was no longer legal for road use so the Ministry of Pensions decided to replace it with a four-wheeled car. Bert Greeves decided that it was time to retire from the business and was soon followed by his cousin Derry Preston-Cobb. The company floundered in 1976 and after a fire at the factory were unable to resume production, resulting in receivership.Greeves cybermotorcycle.com The last civilian Greeves road bikes were produced in 1966 these being the 25DCMk2 'East Coaster' and the 20DC 'Sports' single in black, but in 1968 the company produced a batch of 19 24DF police bikes with 250cc Villiers single cylinder engines, 15 for the Staffordshire County Police and 4 for the City of London police New Greeves The old Greeves motorcycles were ideal for the new \\"classic\\" (twinshock) class of trials but parts were scarce and expensive, so trials rider Richard Deal started producing replica parts, and then a replica motorcycle called the Anglian. In May 1999, after gaining control of the trademarks of the Greeves name in the UK, USA and Europe, a new Greeves company was founded in Chelmsford which restarted production of mainly trials models. The new company started building and rebuilding Greeves motorcycles from 2000 and established a replacement parts division. Continuing a tradition started by Bert Greeves, the heads, barrels, crankcases, and aluminium frame beams were manufactured from new castings produced in a specialist alloy foundry. =The new 280 cc= By 2009, the company had built 22 Greeves Anglian motorcycles, four Greeves Pathfinders, and had completed some restoration projects. In 2007 a decision was made to develop the first completely new Greeves trials motorcycle for over 20 years. Working with the students at DeMontfort University in Leicester, Greeves engineers consulted with participants involved in the Rapid Product Development MSc project to design and develop a completely new displacement lightweight two-stroke engine. To enable existing components to be used in the new engine, parts were scanned using the Centre‚Äôs Renishaw Cyclone Reverse Engineering machine. Rapid prototyping models of the new engine were then manufactured on the Centre‚Äôs 3D printing machine to check the fit before manufacture of prototype cast metal parts. GPD Developments, a foundry in Nuneaton, Warwickshire manufactured castings using a new method of printing sand moulds directly from computer- aided design (CAD) data. Prototype sand moulds used this new technique to cast prototype parts. After six thousand hours of design, further development and testing, Greeves launched the 280 cc Trials bike at the Classic Off-Road show at Telford in 2009. The 280 specification included Marzocchi aluminium forks, Dellorto carburettor, the fuel tank located close to the rear wheel to reduce the centre of gravity, and a single shock absorber mounted centrally on the swinging arm. The frame, headstock, swinging arm, footrest hangars and engine components used 6063 aerospace-quality aluminium.

He studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (M.Sc., Chemistry, 1946; Ph.D., 1954).\\"Probing into the realm of proteins and immunity \\" Today, he is Professor in the Weizmann Institute's Immunology Department. He is a former President of the Weizmann Institute of Science, from 1975-1985.  Research  Sela is known for his research in immunology, particularly for research on synthetic antigens, molecules that trigger the immune system to attack. This work of Sela has led to the discovery of the genetic control of the immune response, as well as to the design of vaccines based on synthetic molecules. He was among the first who introduced the use of linear and branched synthetic polypeptides as antigens, and this brought about a better understanding of immunological phenomena. For several decades, Sela has been interested in the possibility of fighting the autoimmune disease, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) with synthetic analogs of the molecules in the myelin sheath of the brain which are capable of provoking the disease. He is probably best known as the co-developer (with Ruth Arnon and Dvora Teitelbaum) of the multiple sclerosis drug copaxone.  Awards and honours  Sela has received several awards.

The mechanism of action by which suriclone produces its sedative and anxiolytic effects is by modulating GABAA receptors, although suriclone is more subtype-selective than most benzodiazepines.

Species are listed as such when there is inadequate information to make a direct, or indirect, assessment of its risk of extinction based on its distribution and/or population status. It may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking. Data Deficient is therefore not a category of threat. Listing of taxa in this category indicates that more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that future research will show that threatened classification is appropriate. It is important to make positive use of whatever data are available. In many cases great care should be exercised in choosing between DD and a threatened status. If the range of a taxon is suspected to be relatively circumscribed, and a considerable period of time has elapsed since the last record of the taxon, threatened status may well be justified.

In 2005, Glatze was quoted by Time magazine saying \\"I don't think the gay movement understands the extent to which the next generation just wants to be normal kids. The people who are getting that are the Christian right.\\" Glatze turned toward Christianity after a health scare due to palpitations. Worried that he was affected by the same heart condition which claimed his father's life, he sought medical help. The palpitations turned out to be due to anemia, caused by celiac disease.

Biography =Early life= Baume was born \\"Friedrich Baume\\" in Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1862. His parents were Joseph Baume and Emilie Ehrenfried, Joseph was a photographer by trade. Between 1877 and 1883, Baume pursued careers in both commerce and journalism before studying law. He was admitted to the bar in 1884 and graduated with a Bachelor of Law in 1891. In 1896 he established a legal practice with A. E. Whitaker, a son of Frederick Whitaker. =Political career= Upon moving to Auckland, Baume became a prominent figure there and soon entered the political arena. He became a member of the Auckland City Council as well as the Auckland Harbour Board. From 1902 to 1905 he was one of the three Members of Parliament representing the multi-member City of Auckland electorate. Before 1905, he had been associated with the New Liberal Party group, which disappeared after 1905. In 1905, the multi-member electorates were split up, and he won the newly created Auckland East electorate. Baume was later considered for membership of Joseph Ward's first cabinet in 1906, however he was passed over due to his connections with the liquor trade. Baume's health began to deteriorate and in 1909 he suffered a serious heart attack where the premature announcement of his death was reported. His health was to never fully recover and resigned in 1910 citing ill-health but died in Bad Nauheim, Germany, before the resulting by-election was held. He was succeeded in the Auckland East electorate by his cousin Arthur Myers. Family On 21 June 1899 Baume married Rosetta Lulah Leavy in San Francisco. She was a university graduate and had been one of the first female high school teachers in the United States. Later, Rosetta became the first woman candidate for Parliament in New Zealand, standing for the Liberal Party for the seat of Parnell in 1919. In 1921 she remarried to Edward William Kane, clerk of the New Zealand House of Representatives and died in Wellington on 22 February 1934. Frederick Baume and Rosetta had four sons: Frederick (Eric), Neville, Alan and Sidney. Eric Baume later became well known in Australia as a journalist, broadcaster and novelist.

He lived most of his adult live in Connecticut where he was a lawyer and a landowner. He was among the earliest puritan settlers in Connecticut, living in Podunk and finally settling in Hartford, Connecticut. He purchased most of the land covered by the current towns of South Windsor, Connecticut and East Hartford, Connecticut. He was the first American ancestor of a large number of Burnhams. He died in Hartford at the age of 69. Immigration to America The ancestry of Thomas Burnham and when he departed from England is a subject of ongoing debate. One of his decedents and author of his 1884 genealogy, Roderick Henry Burnham, believes that his family came from Hatfield, Herefordshire, England. Genealogists Cathy Soughton and Henry B. Hoff found evidence that he was baptized at Long Crendon in Buckinghamshire, England on 28 October 1619, the son of John Burnham, a yeoman farmer; however, genealogist Mary Pitkin uncovered flaws in this conclusion. A letter from one of his descendants states that he sailed for the Barbados from Gravesend in 1635; but this Caribbean connection could be a mistake since a different Thomas Burnham was \\"buried from St. Michael‚Äôs, Barbados on 1 Aug 1674.\\" There is no surviving record of when Burnham arrived in America, but he married Anna Wright ca. 1645 in Hartford, Connecticut. Pitkin states, \\"there are enough mentions of Thomas in Windsor over the years to prove that he was in Connecticut continuously between his arrival there and his death\\" on 28 June 1688 in Windsor, Hartford, Connecticut. Career and Legacy Burnham successfully defended a school teacher, Abigail Betts who had been accused of blasphemy, claiming \\"Christ was a bastard\\" and she could prove it through the scriptures. Burnham successfully defended her by asserting that blasphemy was not a capital crime in England, and thus could not be one in Connecticut under its charter. But by \\"saving her neck\\" the Puritan authorities disenfranchised him and prohibited Burnham from further practice of the court. In 1659 he purchased from Tantonimo (sometimes spelled, Tan-tonimo), Chief sachem of the Potunke Native Americans, a tract of land now covered by the towns of South Windsor and East Hartford, on which he afterward lived, and a part of which is still in possession of his descendants. He held this land under a deed from Tantonimo, and later in 1661, by a deed from six of the latter's successors and allies, by which they renounce \\"all our right and title in those lands aforesayd unto Thomas Burnam and his heirs.\\" The possession of this land led to endless lawsuits, supported by the government, and it was ordered to be divided. Burnham refused to give it up, however, and the contest continued for many years. It resulted finally in the appointment in 1688, at a town meeting of the inhabitants of Hartford, \\"of a Committee in behalf of this town, to\\" treat with Thomas Burnham, Senior, upon his claim to the lands on the East side of the Great River.\\" He erected a house on these lands at Potunke, which was one of five, on the east side of the Connecticut, to be fortified and garrisoned during the Indian war of 1675, King Philip's War. In 1649-56-59-60, he appears as plaintiff in court, and usually argued his own cases. Before his death he had divided the greater part of his estate among his children by deed, with the condition that it should remain in the family. Family The Burnham family had lived at Long Crendon since at least the early 1500s. Originally labourers, their fortunes improved during the course of the 16th and 17th centuries with several members of the English branch of the family becoming local attorneys from the mid-1600s until the early 19th century. There is no record of Thomas Burnham studying law in England but it seems probable. After he emigrated he married Anna Wright Burnham (1620 - August 4, 1703) in Hartford circa 1645. The daughter of Captain Richard Wright, she died in Hartford at the age of 83. Their children were all born in Hartford, and the dates below are based on research by historian Roderick H. Burnham with minor updates by genealogist Mary Pitkin: * Elizabeth Burnham (About 1640 - December 2, 1720), married Nicholas Morecock * Mary Burnham (1642 - January 25, 1720), married William Morton * Anna (Hannah) Burnham (1644 - November 29, 1722), married Samuel Gaines * Thomas Burnham (1646 - March 19, 1726), married Naomi Hull * John Burnham (1648 - April 20, 1721), married Mary Olcott * Samuel Burnham (1650 - April 12, 1728), married Mary Cadwell * William Burnham (1652 - December 12, 1730), married Elizabeth Loomis * Richard Burnham (1654 - April 28, 1731), married Sarah Humphries.

Bryan Daily Eagle and Pilot (November 29, 1911). p. 4 =World lightweight champion= Wolgast (right) in his title fight against Willie Ritchie, 1912. He turned professional in 1906, and on 22 February 1910 he won the World Lightweight Title with a technical knockout (TKO) during the 40-round Battling Nelson. After the California bout, both fighters were arrested and charged with violating the anti-prizefighting law. Wolgast would later defend the title against Mexican Joe Rivers in 1912, a bout that caused controversy. Delivering simultaneous blows, they knocked each other out. Referee Jack Welch counted to ten and the bout was over. However, he awarded the win to Wolgast, claiming that Ad had started to rise before the fatal ten. Rivers' fans let out a roar, believing he had been fouled. To add to the confusion, the timekeeper insisted the round had ended when Welch reached the count of four. But Welch's ruling became the official verdict. Wolgast ultimately defended the belt five times before losing it to Willie Ritchie in 1912. =Later life= Wolgast was declared incompetent in 1917 and a guardianship was established for him. He suffered a nervous breakdown in 1918 and was placed in a sanitarium. He escaped and was later found living in the \\"North Woods\\" of California as a \\"mountain man.\\" In December 1918 a Los Angeles court found him competent to handle his own affairs, and terminated the guardianship. In the early 1920s, Jack Doyle, owner of a Vernon, California boxing venue, took Wolgast \\"under his wing,\\" and allowed him to train at his boxing gym, although Wolgast was not to fight again. Death In 1927 he was committed to Stockton State Hospital. He was injured by guards trying to restrain him and he had ribs broken. He died 14 April 1955 in Camarillo, California of heart complications.

They united together because they thought that this was the only way for them to become popular. They hired Hunter Q. Robbins III as their manager. They were a team of masked super heavyweights.

It had a relatively novel layout, with a \\"buried\\" radial engine mounted mid- fuselage. Only a single prototype was built before the Armistice between Italy and the allied armed forces, which ended the project. Development Among the many Italian aircraft manufacturers, during World War II, the majority (such as Savoia-Marchetti and Caproni) designed and built mixed-construction aircraft, or, in the case of CANT, completely made of wood. While Fiat and Macchi built more advanced aircraft, they still tended to have conventional, often obsolete structures, even if of all-metal construction. Only Reggiane and Piaggio mastered advanced, all-metal structures. Of them, Piaggio tended to explore the innovative concepts. The Piaggio P.119 was one of the best examples of these projects. The '5' series fighters are well known, especially the Fiat G.55 and the Macchi C.205, but there were two other fighters on the same level, the Caproni Vizzola F.6 and the Piaggio P.119, neither of which entered production. The P.119 was designed (in 1939), to minimise drag by fitting the engine in mid-fuselage in a similar layout to the P-39 Airacobra. It was hoped to improve maneuverability by positioning the engine near the aircraft's centre of gravity, which would also allow a heavy nose-mounted armament. In 1940, Piaggio still had to solve three major issues: contra- rotating propellers, power transmission, and engine cooling. Giovanni Casiraghi, chief designer of Piaggio, tried to solve the first issue with the P.118 fighter, but without success. It was intended to be powered by two Piaggio P.XI RC 40 engines, each connected to a propeller, but it was not built. The P.119 was built instead and first flew at the end of 1942. Three different configurations were studied before one was chosen. Design The P.119 was a cantilever monoplane, constructed completely of metal, with a conventional wide undercarriage. It had a forward-mounted cockpit, with the weapons mounted just behind the three-bladed propeller. It had advanced construction for the time, with many removable panels for internal inspection. The number of components were reduced to a minimum, and also standardized, to make construction as easy as possible. No other Italian aircraft was so advanced in these details. The P.119 was powered by a 1,119 kW (1,500 hp) Piaggio P.XV RC 45 radial engine located behind the cockpit. Air intakes for cooling were fitted under the nose. The propeller was a 3.3 m (10 ft 10in) diameter Piaggio P.1002 driven by a shaft running under the cockpit. A further development was planned with a Piaggio P.XV RC 50, giving 1,230 kW (1,650 hp) at takeoff and 1,099 kW (1,475 hp) at 5,000 m (16,400 ft) altitude, with a planned maximum speed of 630 km/h (390 mph) maximum speed but never implemented. The aircraft had a 330 l (90 US gal) fuel tank in each wing, and a 340 l (90 US gal) tank in the fuselage, giving a total of 1,000 l (260 US gal), a 2¬Ω times greater capacity than that of a Bf 109 or a MC.205. Overall weight of the aircraft was quite high, but the wing was wide, with a 13 m (43 ft) wingspan. The surface area was almost 28 m2 (300 ft2), giving a wing loading of around 150 kg/m2. The wing was built on a single spar which also supported the engine, and a semi-spar/semi-monocoque skin. The armament was concentrated in the nose; a 20 mm Breda cannon with 110 rounds and four 12.7 mm (0.5 in) Breda heavy machine guns with 2,000 rounds. The Breda gun was more powerful than the German 20 mm MG 151, but had a lower rate of fire. There was also provision to install another four 7.7 mm (0.303 in) Breda machine guns in the wings with 1,200 rounds in total. An anti-tank version was proposed with a Breda 37 mm (1.46 in) gun, but not built. Operational history The machine was flight-tested, but it was found that firing all the weapons produced excessive vibration. A landing accident slightly damaged one wing on 2 August 1943. One month later, the armistice with the Allies brought an end to the project. All in all, the P.119 was an interesting and somewhat mysterious aircraft, for many years totally unknown to the public. It was not sent to Guidonia for official evaluation. Performance could have been very good. The engine and the weapons were built under foreign license, but they could have been called 'authentic' in respect to the German DB 605 engine and 20 mm MG 151 guns mounted in the '5' series fighters. Performance was good enough to compete with other Italian fighters and endurance was much better. However, the aircraft was not ready until eight months after the other '5' fighters, and this was catastrophic for the program. The aircraft was not rated officially by the Regia Aeronautica, and MM.496 was the only one built. Apart from this, the range, endurance and overall visibility were superior, and the performance and weaponry were not so different. But the P.119, with its technical problems, would never have been in a condition to show any capability as an operational aircraft, so the only Axis mid-fuselage engined fighter was swiftly forgotten.

It was a modern design for its time, but was a failure due to lack of powerplants commensurate with its high wing loading. Design The P.32 was a twin-engine monoplane with a crew of five or six. The main structure was of wood, with a glazed nose, low cockpit, twin tailfins, and a distinct 'banana' shape to the fuselage. It was armed with a dorsal turret with two machine guns, a ventral turret, a single machine gun in the nose, and it could carry a bombload. Utilizing their experience of designing experimental and record-breaking aircraft like the Piaggio P.16, Piaggio P.23M, and Piaggio P.23R, Piaggio designed the P.32 with very small wings for its size. This meant a high wing loading, which required Handley-Page leading edge slats and double trailing-edge flaps to provide enough lift on takeoff and landing. Development The development of this aircraft began with the contest announced by the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Air Force) in 1934. The P.32 was one of many contenders, and the most modern. The prototype first flew in 1936, and was tested at Guidonia, leading to an order for 12 aircraft, followed by a second order for five. These aircraft were fitted with the Isotta-Fraschini Asso XI.RC inline V-12 engines, and were designated the P.32 I. In early 1937, the P.32 Is were assigned to XXXVII Gruppo BT, 18 Stormo. The advanced wing design meant that they could be flown only by specially trained crews, but the aircraft was found to be fatally underpowered, with a maximum speed of only , and then only with no bombs or defensive weapons carried. They were unable to fly on only one engine, and their handling qualities were inferior to the SM.79 and BR.20. The P.32 II, fitted with more powerful Piaggio P.XI R.C.40 radial engines was tested, and 12 were delivered in early 1938. The more powerful engines gave a better rate of climb, but the increased weight meant there was no improvement in maximum speed, while the range dropped from because of higher fuel consumption. The P.32 Bis was a redesign that brought the empty weight of the aircraft down from by reducing its overall size slightly. This gave it a top speed of and a ceiling of with the Isotta-Fraschini Asso XI engines, and and a ceiling of with the Piaggio P.XI R.C.40 engines. However, the prototype crashed on 25 February 1938, killing the test pilot, leading to the cancellation of further development. The P.32 Is and IIs were taken out of service in April 1938 and were used as training aircraft. In 1939, a P.32 crashed, killing the entire crew. There is no further information about the fate of the remaining aircraft, and most likely they were scrapped soon afterwards. Variants ; P.32 I: With Isotta-Fraschini Asso XI R.C.

After the armistice with the Allied Forces in September 1943, he choose to follow the hard-line fascist regime of the Italian Social Republic (Repubblica Sociale Italiana, or RSI) in German-held northern Italy. During the German military occupation of Rome in 1943-1944, he was vice- commander of police under the Commander Caruso, informant of Captain Erich Priebke and Colonel Herbert Kappler of the SS.

Journalist in Sicily De Mauro at work (1960) In 1948, De Mauro moved to Palermo, Sicily, under an assumed name, and worked for local newspapers such as Il Tempo di Sicilia and Il Mattino di Sicilia. In 1959 he started working for L'Ora, a communist-oriented paper. Other journalists were puzzled about De Mauro's presence at the newspaper, as he had been a supporter of Mussolini until the bitter end and fought in the brutal war against the anti-Fascist partisans. Rumour had it that his nose had been broken by partisans. At L'Ora, De Mauro joined a group of crack investigative reporters that included Felice Chilanti and Mario Farinella. From the mid-1950s to the 1970s, the left-leaning newspaper often hit the national spotlight for its investigations and denunciations of ties between corrupt politicians and the Sicilian Mafia. Era L'Ora della mafia in prima pagina, La Stampa, 18 June 2012 In 1960 De Mauro was among the winners of the Premiolino, one of the most important Italian journalism awards, for his crime investigations. Premiolino website De Mauro also wrote pieces on drug trafficking and on the Sack of Palermo, the construction boom in the 1950s and 1960s that led to the destruction of the city's green belt and ancient villas. In 1962, De Mauro was the first to publish a detailed map of the Mafia, which was confirmed 22 years later by the Mafia pentito (turncoat) Tommaso Buscetta in his testimony to Judge Giovanni Falcone. In January 1962 he published a series of articles in L'Ora disclosing the testimony of Melchiorre Allegra, a medical doctor and a member of the Mafia from 1916 until his arrest in 1937. Upon being arrested, Allegra disclosed his membership and testified about Mafia activities. It was one of the first testimonies about the Mafia from within, but the document had been neglected until De Mauro republished it.

During his controversial tenure of ENI, Mattei had tried to break the oligopoly of the \\"Seven Sisters\\" (a term Mattei coined to refer to the dominant oil companies of the mid-20th centuryThe new Seven Sisters: oil and gas giants dwarf western rivals, Financial Times, 11 March 2007), and in 1959, in the middle of the Cold War, brokered an oil import deal with the Soviet Union over intense protests from the United States and NATO, while supporting independence movements against colonial powers such as Algeria.Algerian Gas to Europe: The Transmed Pipeline and Early Spanish Gas Import Projects , by Mark H.

Uno spiraglio di luce sui misteri d'Italia, Corriere della Sera, 14 May 2008Servadio, Mafioso, pp. 147-48 Verzotto knew Mafia boss Giuseppe Di Cristina quite well; he had been best man at De Cristina's wedding.Servadio, Mafioso, pp. 165-66 Verzotto had been with Mattei on his airplane the day before it crashed. De Mauro was convinced that he had got hold of a story of a lifetime. Before his disappearance he told colleagues at the newspaper L'Ora, ‚ÄúI have a scoop that is going to shake Italy.‚Äù Disappearance Front page of L'Ora five days after the disappearance of De Mauro begging for help to locate him De Mauro was kidnapped on the evening of 16 September 1970, while coming back home from work, in the via delle Magnolie in Palermo. In response, thousands of police and Carabinieri, equipped with helicopters and dogs, combed Sicily in vain in search of the reporter.Investigator of the Mafia Is Kidnapped on Sicily, The New York Times, 22 September 1970 De Mauro's body has never been found, a victim of the so-called lupara bianca, despite intensive search efforts assisted by top-level forces from Rome and even a special investigative committee of the Italian Parliament.Vain Search Angers Italian Crime Board, The New York Times, 14 October 1970 Over the years, the investigations into De Mauro's disappearance by the Carabinieri and the police followed widely divergent leads. Colonel Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa and Captain Giuseppe Russo of the Carabinieri were among the first to work on the case. Years later, and in different circumstances, both were murdered by the Mafia. They focused on the lead of drug trafficking. According to them, De Mauro would have been a victim of lupara bianca after discovering leads on drug trafficking by the Mafia between Sicily and the U.S. The first inquiries of the police by Bruno Contrada and Boris Giuliano instead focused on the lead of De Mauro's investigations into the death of Mattei, prompted by the disappearance a few pages of notes and a tape of Mattei's last speech from De Mauro's office. The investigations were seriously hampered due to deviations by people within the Italian police and secret services. According to police inspector Giuliano, there was \\"someone at the ministry in Rome that does not want to go to the bottom of the death of De Mauro.\\" According to Giuliano, an order to scale down the investigation was issued by the head of the secret service, Vito Miceli, allegedly involved in the Borghese coup. Omicidio De Mauro, assolto Tot√≤ Riina, La Repubblica, 10 June 2011 Miceli had been in contact with the mafiosi Di Cristina and Giuseppe Calderone, who wanted to support the coup, which was scheduled for December 1970. La verit√† del pentito su De Mauro, La Repubblica (Palermo edition), 12 June 2011 Italian mystery The disappearance of De Mauro remained a mystery and the focus of many speculations. In May 1994, Buscetta declared that the Sicilian Mafia had been involved in the murder of Mattei, and that De Mauro had been killed for investigating that murder. Quando Buscetta riapri' il caso, La Repubblica, 22 June 1995 According to Buscetta, Mattei was killed at the request of the American Mafia because his oil policies had hurt U.S. interests in the Middle East. Buscetta: 'Cosa nostra uccise Enrico Mattei', La Repubblica, 23 May 1994 The American Mafia in turn was possibly doing a favour to the Seven Sisters.Woodhull & Snyder, Journalists in peril, p. 101 Buscetta claimed that Mattei's death was organized by Mafia bosses Di Cristina, Salvatore Greco \\"Ciaschiteddu\\", and Stefano Bontade at the request of Angelo Bruno, a Sicilian born Mafia boss from Philadelphia.Arlacchi, Addio Cosa Nostra, pp. 79-83 Gaetano Iann√¨, another pentito, declared that a special agreement had been reached between the Sicilian Mafia and \\"some foreigners\\" for the elimination of Mattei, which was organized by Di Cristina. 'Fu Di Cristina a sabotare l'aereo di Enrico Mattei', La Repubblica, 21 June 1994 These statements triggered new inquiries, including the exhumation of Mattei's corpse. Buscetta claimed that Bontade organized De Mauro's kidnap, because his investigations into the death of Mattei came very close to the Mafia, and to Bontade in particular. Another pentito, Francesco Di Carlo, declared in 2001 that De Mauro was killed because he had learned that one of his former fascist friends, Prince Borghese, was involved in the planned 1970 coup with like- minded army officers, determined to stop what they considered as Italy's drift to the left. \\"De Mauro venne ucciso perch√© sapeva del golpe\\", La Repubblica, 26 January 2001 Yet another pentito, Rosario Naimo, who started to collaborate with the Italian authorities after his arrest in October 2010, said that the journalist was killed because of his investigative reporting that damaged the Mafia. Il debutto in aula dell'ex padrino, La Repubblica, 19 February 2011 The order for De Mauro's killing came from the heads of the Sicilian Mafia Commission, Bontade, Gaetano Badalamenti and Salvatore Riina, according to Di Carlo and Buscetta. Both Di Carlo and Naimo say that De Mauro was kidnapped by Emanuele D'Agostino, a mafioso from Bontade's Santa Maria di Ges√π crime family. According to Di Carlo, the remains of De Mauro were buried under a bridge over the Oreto River near Palermo. However, the police, after a search, did not find the body. The pentito Francesco Marino Mannoia later claimed that had been ordered by Bontade in 1977 or 1978 to dig up several bodies at the bridge and dissolve them in acid. De Mauro, la verit√† di Mannoia; Sciolsi il suo corpo nell' acido', La Repubblica, 12 October 2006 According to the new testimony of Naimo, De Mauro was taken to a terrain in Pallavicino neighbourhood in Palermo where the Mafia boss Francesco Madonia owned a chicken farm. He was killed there and dumped in a pit. 2006 murder trial Salvatore Riina In 2001, as a result of the declarations of Di Carlo, the judicial inquiry was reopened. De Mauro, si riapre l' inchiesta, Corriere della Sera, 27 January 2001 In April 2006, more than 35 years after De Mauro's disappearance, the trial on his murder started at the Court of Palermo with the former Mafia boss of bosses Riina as the only remaining defendant. De Mauro, processo dopo 35 anni, La Repubblica, 5 April 2006 (D'Agostino and Bontate were killed by Riina's Corleonesi in the Second Mafia War; Badalamenti died in a US prison in April 2004.) Anniversario omicidio Mauro De Mauro , Antimafia Duemila, 16 September 2009 In 2011 the new Mafia turncoat Naimo testified at the trial saying that the journalist was killed by the Mafia on the orders of Riina. Mauro De Mauro, ‚ÄúEcco dov‚Äô√® il suo corpo‚Äù, Le Repubblica, 14 January 2011 The \\"inconvenient journalist\\" (giornalista scomodo), as De Mauro had become known, was kidnapped and killed because the Mafia and their backers wanted to know his sources of confidential and potentially devastating information, public prosecutor Antonio Ingroia told the court in his closing speech in March 2011. \\"The death sentence on De Mauro was passed because of a convergence of two elements,\\" Ingroia said. Riina, Bontade and Badalamenti decided to eliminate De Mauro because he was about to go public about Mattei's 1962 murder as a result of research for Francesco Rosi's landmark movie, as well as the fact the journalist had uncovered the plans for staging the Mafia- backed far-right Borghese coup d'√©tat, thanks to his former wartime Fascist connections.Mafia 'beast' acquitted of Mattei journalist murder, Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno (in English), 27 January 2014 \\"De Mauro was very busy piecing together the elements of the plot, and his death stopped it being uncovered,\\" according to Ingroia. \\"The other 'convergent' element in his death was the fact that he knew, from its inception, about the subversive project involving spies, neofascists and Mafia groups,\\" to stage the Borghese Coup,\\" Ingroia said. \\"From his sources in neofascist circles, from his past in Prince Junio Valerio Borghese's crack Decima Mas unit, as well as from tip-offs from Mafia boss Emanuele D'Agostino, he knew something was in the offing\\". The \\"preventive crime\\" might even have had other motives, such as other events that concerned the \\"friends in Rome\\" of the Corleonesi headed by Riina, as emerged from documents retrieved from the former mayor of Palermo, Vito Ciancimino. Riina √® ancora il capo della mafia, Corriere della Sera, 5 March 2011 Cosa Nostra was behind the murder of De Mauro, but there were other backgrounds and individuals, allied with the Mafia, such as deviated freemasons and corrupt public officials. \\"De Mauro was not killed out of revenge, but to prevent harm to the Mafia. The Mafia did not just execute instructions of others, but also because his investigations affected Cosa Nostra itself and other powers associated with it,\\" according to Ingroia. He said the investigations for the trial had unearthed an \\"institutional cover- up\\" in the initial probe into De Mauro's disappearance.Mafia 'beast' life term asked in murder of Mattei journalist, Ansa, 22 April 2011  Mystery continues  On 10 June 2011, Riina was acquitted of charges for ordering the kidnap and killing of De Mauro by the Court in Palermo because of insufficient evidence. \\"It's certainly a surprise, but we'll see the reasons for this ruling,\\" said Franca De Mauro, daughter of the journalist. \\"I am very upset because after 40 years we still have no answer about what happened that day.\\" Riina assolto per l'omicidio De Mauro, Corriere della Sera, 10 June 2011 In their explanation of the ruling that became public in August 2012, the judges of the Court of Palermo decided that De Mauro had died because he had gone too far in his quest for the truth about the last hours of Mattei in Sicily. They pointed to Graziano Verzotto as a possible man behind the killing of De Mauro and Mattei, but without a clear conviction. Verzotto had died in June 2010. Verzotto, i misteri dell'ex dc nei delitti De Mauro e Mattei, Corriere della Sera, 9 August 2012 \\"Delitto De Mauro, Verzotto mandante\\", Corriere del Veneto, 9 August 2012 The prosecution, which had requested a further life term for Riina, appealed against the acquittal. The appeal trial began in April 2013. On 27 January 2014, the Palermo Appeal Court confirmed the acquittal of Riina. Delitto De Mauro, Riina assolto in Appello, Corriere del Mezzogiorno, 27 January 2014 The court was convinced of the involvement of Cosa Nostra in De Mauro's murder, but attributed the murder to the group that was headed by Stefano Bontade and identified the likely motive in the discovery by the journalist of important facts about the death of ENI president Enrico Mattei. Mafia, omicidio De Mauro: per i giudici, le prove su Riina erano contraddittorie, Corriere del Mezzogiorno, 9 May 2014 There was insufficient evidence for the involvement of Riina, due to contradictory evidence, lack of clarity of the evidence gathered and conflicting statements by government witnesses, in particular those of Di Carlo. In June 2015, Riina was absolved by the court of last instance, the supreme Court of Cassation. The evidence collected by the prosecution did not allow to establish a direct or indirect role of the accused in the crime. The Court concluded, however, that De Mauro most likely had been killed by the Mafia because he knew of their involvement in Enrico Mattei's death, rather than the Borghese coup attempt. \\"De Mauro ucciso per i segreti su Mattei\\", La Repubblica, 4 February 2016 De Mauro's disappearance and likely death remains one of the unsolved mysteries in Italian history.

Biography Penn was born on 14 March 1681, the sixth child of Penn and his first wife, Gulielma Maria Springett, in County Cork, Ireland. At Bristol on 12 January 1699, he married Mary Jones (1677‚Äì1733), the daughter of Charles and Martha (Wathen) Jones. His father was present at the wedding. The couple had three children. He came to the colony with newly appointed Lieutenant- Governor John Evans, arriving February 2, 1704, and was made a member of the provincial council six days later. He raised a militia company, but, being presented before the corporation of the city of Philadelphia, the chief men in which were unfriendly to his father, for disorder at a tavern, he took offense and returned to England. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Parliament. On his mother's side he was related to the wife of Lord Fairfax, and engaged with him and others in a project to recover sunken treasure. By various means he added to his father's financial embarrassment, and he was obliged to sell the manor of Williamstadt, which had been laid out for him at the founding of the colony. In 1708, he signed the Pennsylvania Mortgage Agreement. Around this time he formally renounced Quakerism and became a member of the Church of England. After William Penn's death in July 1718, his second wife, Hannah Callowhill Penn, had to deal with a challenge to her husband's will. The will had provided William Jr. with the estate of Shanagarry, County Cork, Ireland, which had descended from his grandfather, Admiral William Penn, and certain other property, including all but of the American estate. In an effort to cut Hannah and her children out of the inheritance, he waged a legal effort to contest his father's will. Although he died before the case was settled, his son Springett attempted to have the court declare the will invalid, asserting that his grandfather was mentally incompetent when he wrote it. Hannah Penn prevailed, and saw to it that her children received the estate, after payment of her husband's debts. When she died on December 20, 1726, the proprietorship of Pennsylvania passed to her three sons: John, Thomas, and Richard. He died of tuberculosis in Li√®ge on 23 June 1720.

Narration The hadith is narrated in the context of the revelation of Ash-Shu'ara, the 26th surah in the Quran, in 617. The surah includes a verse in which Muhammad is instructed to warn his relatives against adhering to their pagan beliefs and to instead become Muslim so as to avoid imminent disaster. There are two primary versions of the hadith, though both conclude with Muhammad mostly failing to convince his family and being mocked by his uncle Abu Lahab. Due to the latter incident, the hadith has also been linked to surah Al-Masad. =Address on the mountain= Muhammad ascended a mountain to address the warning to his clan, the Quraysh, speaking of an approaching Doomsday and stating that only faith in God would save them. Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj and Abu Awana ascribe the following declaration to him: The hadith is further elaborated in other variations with Muhammad issuing warnings of individual fates and stating that his own intercession would not be enough to save them. In such a context, he intreats by name his aunt Safiyya bint Abd al-Muttalib, his paternal uncles, as well as his daughter Fatimah. =Address during a feast= According to the Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal, upon receiving the Quranic instruction, Muhammad summoned thirty members of his immediate family to share in a meal with him. He then asked his gathered relatives \\"who of you is willing to act for my religion and for my prophecies, and in return will dwell in Paradise with me and become my successor in my family?\\" Among those gathered, only his young cousin, Ali ibn Abi Talib, offered his consent. Muhammad's reaction to this is not recorded, though other variations of the story state that he explicitly accepted Ali's support. In one such account, recorded by Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad declares Ali to be his brother, his heir, as well as his successor. Others also add a miraculous aspect to the hadith. Ibn Sa'd narrates that when forty members of his family arrived for the meal, Muhammad instructed Ali to feed them with a single plate of food. This plate provided enough food to satisfy all the guests, though Abu Lahab dismissed it as sorcery. Muhammad invited the group another night and repeated the miracle, asking who among them will lend him their support so as to become his \\"brother\\" and enter Paradise. Here too, Ali is the only one to agree. In both versions, his response is shown in clear contrast to the remainder of the Quraysh. Sir Richard Burton comments that this banquet \\"won for [Muhammad] a proselyte worth a thousand sabers in the person of Ali, son of Abu Talib.\\" Sunni and Shia interpretations The differing primary versions of the hadith have historically been appropriated for political means in the schism between the Sunni and Shia sects of Islam. In regards to the address on the mountain, the idea that kinship with Muhammad not being enough to secure salvation can be interpreted to have anti-Shia insinuations. This is due to the reverence given by the sect to the family of Muhammad. The implication was made especially clear with the implicit warning given to Fatimah, from whom the later Shia Imams descend. Conversely, the second version was used to advance one of the primary tenets of Shi'ism; the right of Ali as the successor to Muhammad. The direct appointment of Ali as Muhammad's heir was used to convey that his right to succession was established at the very beginning of Muhammad's prophetic activity. His merit for the role was further emphasised by the description of him being alone among his family in his support of Muhammad.

Tsien was also a pioneer of calcium imaging.  Early life  Paul Krugman, Roger Tsien, Martin Chalfie, Osamu Shimomura, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Masukawa, Nobel Prize Laureates 2008, at a press conference at the Swedish Academy of Science in Stockholm. Tsien was born to a Chinese American family in New York, in 1952.

He graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in chemistry and physics in 1972. According to his freshman-year roommate, economist and Iowa politician Herman Quirmbach, \\"It's probably not an exaggeration to say he's the smartest person I ever met ... [a]nd I have met a lot of brilliant people.\\" After completing his bachelor's degree, Tsien joined the Physiological Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, England with the aid of a Marshall Scholarship, and resided at Churchill College, Cambridge. He received his Ph.D. in physiology in 1977 for research on The Design and Use of Organic Chemical Tools in Cellular Physiology formally supervised by Richard Adrian in the Department of Physiology and assisted by Andy Holmes, Gerry Smith and Jeremy Sanders in the Department of Chemistry.  Research and career Following his Ph.D., Tsien was a Research Fellow at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge from 1977 to 1981. He was appointed to the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1982 to 1989. Beginning in 1989, he worked at the University of California, San Diego, as Professor of Pharmacology and Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and as an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Tsien contributed to the fields of cell biology and neurobiology by discovering genetically programmable fluorescent tags, thereby allowing scientists to watch the behavior of molecules in living cells in real time. He also developed fluorescent indicators of calcium ions and other ions important in biological processes. GFP Movie showing entire structure and zoom in to fluorescent chromophore.

In 2004, Tsien was awarded the Wolf Prize in Medicine \\"for his seminal contribution to the design and biological application of novel fluorescent and photolabile molecules to analyze and perturb cell signal transduction.\\" In 2008, Tsien shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Osamu Shimomura and Martin Chalfie for \\"the green fluorescent protein: discovery, expression and development.\\" = Fluorescent proteins = The multicolored fluorescent proteins developed in Tsien's lab are used by scientists to track where and when certain genes are expressed in cells or in whole organisms. Typically, the gene coding for a protein of interest is fused with the gene for a fluorescent protein, which causes the protein of interest to glow inside the cell when the cell is irradiated with ultraviolet light and allows microscopists to track its location in real time. This is such a popular technique that it has added a new dimension to the fields of molecular biology, cell biology, and biochemistry. with the Nobel lecture Constructing and Exploiting the Fluorescent Protein Paintbox Since the discovery of the wild type GFP, numerous different mutants of GFP have been engineered and tested. The first significant leap forward was a single point mutation (S65T) reported by Tsien in 1995 in Nature. This mutation dramatically improved the fluorescent (both intensity and photostability) and spectral characteristics of GFP. A shift of the major excitation peak to 488 nm with the emission peak staying at 509 nm thus can be clearly observed, which matched very well the spectral characteristics of commonly available FITC facilities. All these then largely amplified the practicality of using GFP by scientists in their research. Tsien mainly contributed to much of our understanding of how GFP works and for developing new techniques and mutants of GFP. Former trainees of Roger Y. Tsien include Atsushi Miyawaki and Alice Y. Ting. Timelines of GFP-development involved by Tsien: * 1994: Tsien showed the mechanism that GFP chromophore is formed in a chemical reaction which requires oxygen but without help from the other proteins. * 1994‚Äì1998: Tsien and collaborators made various GFP mutants by genetic modification and structural tweaking. Newly created variants of GFP can shine more brightly and show different colours, such as yellow, cyan, and blue. * 2000‚Äì2002: Tsien produced monomeric variants of DsRED, which can glow in shades of red, pink, and orange. Remarkably, since then complicated marcromolecular networks of living organisms can be labelled or marked by using \\"all the colours of the rainbow\\". Other detailed highlights involved by Tsien: * 2002: The critical structural difference between GFP and DsRed was revealed. One extra double-bond in the chromophore of DsRed extends its conjugation thus causes the red-shift. * 2002: Monomeric DsRed (mRFP) was first developed. * 2004: New \\"fruit\\" FPs were generated (by in vitro and in vivo directed evolutions). In 2009, a new kind of Infrared Fluorescent Protein (IFP) was developed by Tsien's group, and further reported and described by Science. The new IFPs are developed from bacterial phytochromes instead of from multicellular organism like jellyfish. Under normal conditions, bacterial phytochromes absorb light for signaling instead of fluorescence, but they can be turned fluorescent after deleting some of the signaling parts by genetic means such as site-directed mutagenesis. In order to fluoresce, IFPs require an exogenous chromophore, biliverdin. In 2016, a new class of fluorescent protein was evolved from a cyanobacterial (Trichodesmium erythraeum) phycobiliprotein, Œ±-allophycocyanin, and named small ultra red fluorescent protein (smURFP). smURFP autocatalytically self-incorporates the chromophore biliverdin without the need of an external protein, known as a lyase. Jellyfish- and coral-derived fluorescent proteins require oxygen and produce a stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide upon chromophore formation. smURFP does not require oxygen or produce hydrogen peroxide and uses the chromophore, biliverdin. smURFP has a large extinction coefficient (180,000 M‚àí1 cm‚àí1) and has a modest quantum yield (0.20), which makes it comparable biophysical brightness to eGFP and ~2-fold brighter than most red or far-red fluorescent proteins derived from coral. smURFP spectral properties are similar to the organic dye Cy5. = Next generation sequencing = Roger Tsien had built the foundation of next generation sequencing technology that is widely used today. On 26 October 1990, Roger Tsien et al filed a patent of stepwise (\\"base-by- base\\") sequencing with removable 3' blockers on DNA arrays. Illumina integrated this concept with DNA cloning for their next generation sequencer. = Calcium imaging = Tsien was a pioneer of calcium imaging and known for developing various dyes which become fluorescent in the presence of particular ions such as calcium. One such dye, Fura-2, is widely used to track the movement of calcium within cells. Indo-1, another popular calcium indicator, was also developed by Tsien's group in 1985. He has also developed fluorescent indicators for other ions such as magnesium, zinc, copper, iron, lead, cadmium, aluminum, nickel, cobalt, and mercury. Aequorin is also a useful tool to indicate calcium level inside cells; however, it has some limitations, primarily is that its prosthetic group coelenterazine is consumed irreversibly when emits light, thus requires continuous addition of coelenterazine into the media. To overcome such issues, Tsien's group also developed the calmodulin- based sensor, named Cameleon. = FlAsH-EDT2 = FlAsH-EDT2 is a biochemical method for specific covalent labeling inside live cells. It's a method based on recombinant protein molecules, and was developed by Tsien and his colleagues in 1998. * \\"FLASH-EDT2\\": Fluorescein arsenical helix binder, bis- EDT adduct, * \\"EDT\\": 1,2-ethanedithiol. = Fluorescence-assisted cancer surgery = Mouse experiments by Tsien's group suggest that cancer surgery can be guided and assisted by fluorescent peptides. The peptides are used as probes, and are harmless to living tissues and organs. Their lifetime in the body is only 4 or 5 days. Clinical trials are awaited. = Industrial activities = Tsien was also a notable biochemical inventor and holds or co- holds about 100 patents till 2010. In 1996, Tsien co-founded the Aurora Biosciences Corporation, which went public in 1997. In 2001, Aurora was acquired by the Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Similarly, Tsien was also a scientific co-founder of Senomyx in 1999.Interview, Roger Tsien. The light fantastic, pages 7-9 in The Biologist, Biochemistry Supplement. Vol 62 No 5 supplement. Oct/Nov 2015 Tsien also promoted science education to promising young scientists through the first-ever San Diego Science Festival Lunch with a Laureate Program.San Diego Science Festival Lunch with a Laureate  Personal life  According to the Qian (Tsien) clan genealogy book, Tsien is a 34th- generational descendant of King Qian Liu of the Wuyue Kingdom of ancient China. His family belongs to the line of King Qian Hongzong. Tsien's parents Hsue-Chu Tsien and Yi-Ying Li (ÊùéÊáøÈ¢ñ) came from Hangzhou and Beijing, respectively. Tsien had a number of engineers in his extended family, including his father Hsue-Chu Tsien who was an MIT-educated mechanical engineer and his mother's brothers Y. T. Li (ÊùéËÄÄÊªã) and Shihying Lee (ÊùéËØóÈ¢ñ), who were engineering professors at MIT. Tsien's mother Yi-Ying Li was a nurse. The famous rocket scientist Tsien Hsue-shen, regarded as the co-founding father of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology and, later, the director of the Chinese ballistic-missile and space programs, is a cousin of Tsien's father. Tsien was the younger brother of Richard Tsien, a renowned neurobiologist currently at New York University, and Louis Tsien, a software engineer. Tsien, who called his own work molecular engineering, once said, \\"I'm doomed by heredity to do this kind of work.\\"Steele, D. (2004) Cells aglow.

It collaborated with the more moderate and middle class Reform Union and gave strong support to the abortive Reform Bill 1866 and the successful Reform Act 1867. It developed into a formidable force of agitation at the very heart of the country. Origins During the autumn and winter of 1864‚Äì65 members of the Universal League for the Material Elevation of the Industrious Classes planned to form a new organisation which would concentrate solely on manhood suffrage. As a result, the Reform League was established on 23 February 1865 and the Universal League for the Material Elevation of the Industrious Classes became defunct. The leadership of the League, which was to remain consistent throughout its life, drew heavily on personalities from the International Working Men's Association, including George Howell, George Odger, William Cremer and Benjamin Lucraft. The father of the International, Karl Marx was delighted but he soon came to be disappointed by the outlook of the League.Foot Paul, \\"The Vote\\" Penguin 2006, pp. 134-6. The League leadership also included a number of respectable figures including the barrister, Edmond Beales, as President of the League and Sir Wilfrid Lawson. The League excluded a number of trade unionists, including Thomas Vaze of the Painters and John Bedford Leno the shoemaker poet because they had supported the South during the American Civil War.Harrison Royden, \\"Before the Socialists\\" Routledge, 1965. During the first few months of the League's existence, it proved important that Howell's role was a full-time one that was paid for by a few wealthy supporters. This enabled him to concentrate on marketing the League in newspapers and communicating announcements of the Reform League's Executive Committee. This helped recruit supporters. New branches were rapidly opened in both London and the provinces. During its first year the League received donations of ¬£621, of which ¬£476 came from rich Radicals such as P.A. Taylor MP, Samuel Morley MP and Sir Wilfred Lawson MP. The Liberals remained in power after the 1865 election. Reform Bill 1866 Support quickly grew for the League and meetings were held in pubs all over London. It provided left-wing leadership to a broader-based national movement that built up rapidly over the winter of 1865‚Äì6. William Ewart Gladstone introduced a Reform Bill in March 1866. It was criticised on all quarters; some thought it went too far, others that it didn't go far enough. Three months later an amendment to the bill brought down the Russell-Gladstone government in June and the bill was dropped. Robert Lowe, 1st Viscount Sherbrooke a Liberal M.P., enraged the working class by describing them as \\"impulsive, unreflecting, violent people\\" guilty of \\"venality, ignorance, drunkenness and intimidation\\". \\"Eight years in Australia and a visit to America had left him a convinced opponent of democracy.\\" Bradley Ian, The Optimists, Faber, 2010, p. 162. A succession of Tory Ministers further frustrated the working classes and the Reform League saw the chance to start major agitations which were to achieve pre-eminent national importance and put the Reform Union in the shade. Trafalgar Square demonstration of 1866 Disappointed with the failure of the Bill, the Reform League, organised a series of demonstrations throughout the nation. The radical MPs John Bright and Charles Bradlaugh were prominent in these public meetings which attracted crowds in the hundred thousands.Trevelyan, Life of John Bright, Consxtable, 1925. At one such meeting, in Trafalgar Square on 29 June 1866, speeches were made which refused support for any future Reform Bill which was not based on the League's programme. It was also declared that the advent of Tories to power was \\"destructive to freedom at home and favourable to despotism abroad\\". Red flags and the cap of liberty were sported by a march from Clerkenwell Green. Crowds cheered the Liberal Reform Club in Pall Mall and Gladstone's house in Carlton House Terrace Jenkins Roy, \\"Gladstone\\", Random House 2002, p. 268. and jeered loudly outside the Conservative Carlton Club. A second meeting on 2 July 1866 was even more heated, with rioting in the West End by a \\"fortuitous concourse of the waifs and strays and roughs of a great city\\". Hyde Park demonstration of 1866 The Trafalgar Square meetings were followed by a giant meeting held at Hyde Park on 23 July 1866. The Tory Home Secretary, Spencer Horatio Walpole declared it to be illegal, and issued a Police Notice, but the Reform League resolved to attempt to enter the Park and, if this failed, to move on to Trafalgar Square. The procession started off from the Reform League's headquarters, at 8 Adelphi Terrace, headed by a cab containing the Reform League's president, Edmond Beales, his friend Colonel Dickson and a few other aristocratic supporters. The procession was so vast that when the leading carriage reached Bond Street, the last had not yet left Holborn. When the procession reached Marble Arch they were confronted by a line of policemen and the park's gates were chained. 1600 constables, on foot and mounted, guarded Marble Arch alone. Barricades of omnibuses were on every side; the carriages of the wealthy blocked the way. A massive crowd assembled at the Arch and Beales attempted to enter the park. The police prevented this amid scuffles. Three days of what are variously described as \\"skirmishes\\" or \\"riots\\" ensued.Foot, Paul, pp. 148-9.Harrison Royden, p. 82. While arguing with the police, John Bedford Leno's friend, Humphreys, noticed that the railings would stand no pressure and began to sway them backwards and forwards. He was soon helped by the masses and the railings fell in what was to become known as the \\"Hyde Park Railings Affair\\". The people flooded into Hyde Park despite the efforts of the police to restrain them. Simultaneously, two other parts of the demonstration also broke into the park; one from Knightsbridge headed by Charles Bradlaugh, and another from Park Lane. In addition to the members of the procession, large numbers of bystanders, who were sympathetic to the cause, joined in the storming of Hyde Park and the police were overwhelmed \\"like flies before a waiter's napkin\\". It is estimated that 200,000 people invaded the park leading the police to call for military support. When the Royal Horse Guards arrived the crowds cried \\"Three cheers for the Guards - the people's Guards!\\". The soldiers held back and merely manoeuvred at a distance, despite the police commissioner, Sir Richard Mayne, and others being stoned by the mob. The meeting proceeded as planned under the Reformer's Tree. At its end it was decided to hold another meeting the next evening in Trafalgar Square. John Bedford Leno and the leaders of the Reform League heard a rumour that the government was determined to crack down on the demonstrators and so decided to confront the Home Secretary, Walpole. They pointed out to him that if the police or military stepped in bloodshed would ensue. With tears in his eyes Walpole agreed that restraint was the best option. John Bedford Leno and George Odger went back to the crowds and announced the next evening's meeting at Trafalgar Square. As the sun set the crowds dispersed and the police and military held back, out of sight, and the meeting passed without undue violence. The next evening's meeting at Trafalgar Square was chaired by John Bedford Leno and was also peaceful. The \\"Hyde Park Railings Affair\\" was widely reported and made the Reform League's leaders household names. They were in hot demand to speak at public meetings and demonstrations across the country and saw a rapid increase in support of the Reform League. Winter of discontent During the next few months the Reform League expanded its branches and demonstrations around the country. A notable success was achieved at the Birmingham Reform demonstrations on 28 Aug 1866 which allowed a Midland Department of the Reform League to be formed. This prospered and boasted almost 10,000 members and held great mass meetings at critical stages of the Reform campaign of 1867. The Reform League thought it vital to embrace the more middle-class supporters of the Reform Union and were careful to avoid violence or illegitimate actions. Meetings were closely controlled with one reputedly having 10,000 stewards. They encouraged John Bright to speak at events as he was one of the Reform movement's intellectual leaders. Bright addressed meetings including Manchester (24 September), West Riding/Leeds (8 October), Glasgow (16 October) and Dublin (2 November). Keen to avoid scaring their new-found middle-class supporters the Reform League's London Executive decided to avoid holding meetings in central London for a while. On 3 December 1866 thousands of League supporters marched from Whitehall to the grounds of Beaufort House, Chiswick to hold a meeting. The march was made in a dispiriting downpour, but the fine discipline displayed by the rain-sodden men gave their leaders another claim to public attention. The next day it was reported in the Times that the working men had done enough to show they were earnest in their demand for enfranchisement and asked them to stop their disturbing actions and to wait for the reforms that the Parliament was now certain to make. In the winter of 1866 discontent increased as cold gripped the nation with great East End distress, a growing Fenian problem in Ireland and amongst the Irish in English cities, Trade Union restlessness grew and a feverish international atmosphere followed Bismarck's foundation of an apparent democracy in the North German Confederation. The Reform League continued to campaign and soon found that it was supported by most of the British working-class. Agricultural Hall, Islington meeting of 1867 The Reform League's leaders were determined not to make the mistake of easing off that they had made at the time of the Reform Bill 1866, and so continued demonstrating. On 11 February 1867, the very day the Tory government had fixed for the announcement of its reforms, the League arranged an impressive demonstration that started from Trafalgar Square and ended at a meeting at the Agricultural Hall in Islington. The procession included every sort of Trade Union and Reform League branch from all around the country, all carrying banners and accompanied by bands. That evening a number of \\"advanced Liberal\\" MPs arrived fresh from a sitting at the House of Commons with news of how \\"unsatisfactory\\" the Tory government's proposals for reform were. This made the working men at the packed and excited meeting all the more determined not to give up the \\"pressure from without\\" until the Tory cabinet made much more generous proposals for reform. Hyde Park demonstration of 1867 The league now numbered one hundred branches in London alone and its deputations to Gladstone on 30 March 1867 and to Disraeli on 2 April 1867 were received with great attention. Lord Shaftesbury's appeal to the Reform League to cancel a proposed Good Friday procession to Hyde Park, due to fear of a gigantic \\"profanation\\", was accepted by the League's leaders as they were concerned it might mobilise religious sentiment against them. This was a disappointment as the prospect of a procession on a bank holiday, like Good Friday, was an excellent opportunity to draw large crowds of workers who had the day off. As pressure for reform built up nationally, the League decided to hold another Hyde Park meeting. The government banned it, saying it was illegal, but the League countered that the ban itself was illegal and posted posters to this effect on 1 May. The government backed down. Eventually 200,000 met at Hyde Park on 6 May and speeches were made on ten different platforms. The government planned to use violence, having sworn in large numbers of special constables on 4 May, but backed down at the last minute. Walpole subsequently resigned over the confusion of free speech in Hyde Park and it was never again questioned. English Civil War Gustave Paul Cluseret fled Ireland and arrived in London immediately after the Reform League's Trafalgar Square meeting. He met a dozen members of the Reform League, including John Bedford Leno, in a private room of the \\"White Horse\\" in Rathbone Place. He proposed that they create civil war in England and offered the service of two thousand sworn members of the Fenian body, and that he would act as their leader. John Bedford Leno was the first to reply and denounced the proposal, stating that it would surely lead to their \\"discomfiture and transportation\\", and added that the government would surely hear of the plot. During subsequent speeches Leno noticed that only a matchboard partition divided the room they occupied, with another adjoining room, and that voices could be heard on the other side. Leno declared his attention to leave at once, the others agreed, and the room was soon cleared. The next day the meeting was fully reported in The Times, although Leno's speech had been attributed to George Odger, who had in fact supported Cluseret's proposal. Leno concluded that there had been a leak and that the traitor had been Robert Hartwell, the editor of The Bee-Hive journal. John Bedford Leno was fully satisfied with the success the Reform League had met and, being opposed to unnecessary violence, bitterly opposed the interference of Cluseret, as did most of the other members of the Reform League. Cluseret's \\"call to arms\\" was rejected and he left England for Paris to start his \\"War of the Commune\\". The End of the League The Reform League's campaigning culminated in the passing of the Reform Act 1867 which gave the vote to representatives of working class men for the first time. Despite a Reform Bill being on the Statute Book by mid-August, the League's leaders resolved that the organisation needed to be kept going to watch over the Scottish and Irish Representation Bills, whose enactment was reserved for 1868, and to forward Vote by Ballot and a wider county franchise. They received support from John Bright, who hoped the League would be spurred on by its success and would continue to campaign for the ballot. Tories were alarmed at the prospect of two permanent bodies of agitation (the League and the Union) of a kind they had never known before. Demonstrations continued, culminating in the surprisingly successful \\"working men's\\" assembly of 11 Nov 1867 in Crystal Palace. However, the focus of the league started to recede once most \\"respectable\\" working men had received the householder or lodger vote. Years of demonstrations began to tire the workers and the thought of many more years of the same no longer held the same appeal. In addition, the Sheffield Outrages and the Fenian \\"martyrdoms\\" took over as the main working class issues of the day. Notable events of this time include the \\"funeral processions\\" of 24 Nov 1867 and the \\"Fenian Outrage\\" at Clerkenwell Prison on 13 Dec 1867. Pro-Fenian indiscretions by some members of the Reform League, such as George Odger and James Finlen were seized by the Tory press as chances to scare the population that the Reform League would continue agitation indefinitely. \\"Advanced Liberal\\" politicians of respectability, who had worked with the League in 1866‚Äì7 and had tasted its power to cause reform, were determined not to let the League die at a time when they needed support against Conservative resistance to changes in Ireland. The very wealthy Samuel Morley gave the League ¬£250 in November 1867, followed by ¬£25 from P. A. Taylor and ¬£20 from Abraham Walter Paulton in January 1868, ¬£100 from Titus Salt in April 1868 and ¬£100 from Thomas Thomasson in June 1868. However, Samuel Morley gave another donation of ¬£1,900 which enabled the League to send out numerous \\"deputations\\" to boroughs where a useful Trade Union and working- class vote might be won for the \\"advanced Liberalism\\" of the General Election of Nov 1868. Their help was gratefully received and enough \\"advanced Liberals\\" were elected in Nov 1868 to cause the immediate resignation of Benjamin Disraeli's cabinet. As reward for their help, Morley had also allowed some of his ¬£1,900 to finance a number of the Reform League's leaders (e.g., Edmond Beales in Tower Hamlets, George Howell (aided by John Bedford Leno) in Aylesbury and William Randal Cremer in Warwick, etc.) to stand themselves in the election. None succeeded, mainly due to a lack of respectability and also due to a failure of negotiations to allow them to contest suitable constituencies. The Reform League was dissolved in March 1869, and some of its members went on to become Liberal MPs or activists.

Sir William Keith, the lieutenant-governor, caused a tract of land, 6 miles wide and 15 miles long, on the frontier (around present-day York, Pennsylvania) to be laid out for him, and called Springettsbury Manor. In 1725, with Hannah Penn, the widow and executrix of the founder, he nominated Patrick Gordon as Keith's successor, and obtained confirmation of the appointment by the British Crown. The will of the founder was established by decree of the court of exchequer in 1727, and a compromise between the two branches of the family was in process of adjustment at his death.

At the 2006 census, its population was 841, in 284 families. People and culture The people of Sareshkeh are Gilak and Gileki with Bie-pish dialect is spoken in Sareshkeh. All of the people in Sareshkeh are Shi'a muslims. The people of Sareshkeh for many centuries endorsed the advancement of literacy and science. Sareshkeh's rice is sold all over the country. The other products of Sareshkeh are tea, garlic, cucumber and pumpkin. Climate and weather Sareshkeh enjoys a climate known as 'moderate Caspian'. This weather pattern emerged from the influence of the currents of both the Alborz Mountains and the Caspian Sea. The Talesh Mountains are stretched in a north to south direction, and the Alborz Mountains in an east to west direction. These serve as a barrier against the humid north-west Caspian winds and withhold the penetration of wind bearing vapors towards Iran's mainland, causing heavy rainfall in Gilan during the Spring and Fall seasons. Sareshkeh with a weather more favorable than the other points in the Gilan has warmer winters and cooler summers. Freezing temperatures are seldom reported in the coastal areas, however it is not odd for Sareshkeh to experience periods of near blizzard conditions during the winter. The amount of rainfall in Sareshkeh depends on the winds bearing vapor that blow from the North West in winter, from the East in spring and from the West in summer and autumn. These winds carry the vapor and humidity towards the plains causing heavy and prolonged rainfalls. Sports The popular sport of Sareshkeh is football. Sareshkeh football team is one of the most powerful teams in Gilan. Wrestling and Table football are the other sports in Sareshkeh. Politics The Sareshkeh council is the largest decision authority in Sareshkeh.
