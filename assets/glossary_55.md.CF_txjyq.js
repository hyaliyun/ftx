His work often ‚Äòdraws on his own experience of cancer treatment‚Äô, and is concerned with 'bodies and body politics'. Lobel has described solo performance as 'the perfect metaphor for being sick', since it requires one body 'on stage, isolated and vulnerable', and his performances often intervene 'into the way bodies are culturally stigmatised and marginalised.' In 2019 Lobel published Theatre & Cancer, a text aimed at undergraduate and postgraduate students of theatre, performance and disability studies, that challenges conventional perspectives on cancer narratives in theatre by highlighting key works to reconsider 'cancer performance' beyond sentimentality and survivorship. = Ball and Other Funny Stories about Cancer (2011) = BALL & Other Funny Stories About Cancer is one-person show that brings together works Lobel wrote about his experience with cancer between 2001 and 2011.

He is mostly known for his Tribal Mark Series, which are a hyperrealistic series of portraits with facially scarified characters. His works are often markers of Yoruba cultural significance and socio-cultural discourse. He specializes in hyperrealism and Trompe L'oeil art forms. He has been exhibited in the UK, USA, UAE and Hong Kong. His works have also been acquired privately by collectors such as the Mott-Warsh Collection in Michigan. In 2017, Babajide Olatunji was one of the youngest artists that participated in the Royal Academy of Arts Exhibition in London, UK. His works exhibit a deep commitment toward Yoruba history, and culture, which he researches extensively alongside other concepts of significant cultural relevance. He lives and works in Nigeria.  Early life and background  Babajide Olatunji hails from Okitipupa, Ondo State, Nigeria and was born in Port Harcourt in 1989 to Samuel Adeyemi Olatunji; a civil servant father, and Florence Omolola Olatunji; a petty-trading mother. He is the last child of a family of six. Babajide's artistic pursuit was Inspired by his older brother, Olumide Olatunji, who introduced him to art and mentored him over a contiguous ten-year period which abruptly ended when Olumide died in 2005 due to sickle- cell disease. During this period, Babajide would try and copy Olumide's own drawings which he perfected over time. Olumide also introduced him to literature, which contributed to his perspective about art. At age four, Babajide would draw and paint on mediums from his immediate environment such as books, tables, and even sand. This became a habit overtime which came with the cost of hiding some of his drawings from his teachers who took strong exceptions to him ‚Äòdefacing‚Äô the tables in the classroom. He had a notebook of stick-figure drawings which was confiscated by a teacher and was never returned. However, teachers would enlist his help with textbook illustrations on the chalkboard. He lost his father, the family's sole breadwinner in 2010. This marked a significant period in his life, where he had to cater to the well-being of his family asides himself. He had initially abandoned art to focus on his books, however, he had to start taking commissioned works for sustenance. He did portraits of people, their parents, colleagues and loved ones to earn his means for survival. He made portraits of celebrities like Ramsey Noah and A·π£a which earned him some recognition on campus. These series of events contributed to making art the central pursuit of his professional endeavor.  Education  Babajide Olatunji attended Oyemekun High School, Akure, Ondo State. In 2012, He graduated with a degree in botany from Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife.  Career  Babajide Olatunji's career was ignited by the death of his father and the need for sustenance as the bread winner of the family, which sharpened his focus to explore art professionally while he was a student at Obafemi Awolowo University. Olatunji's career officially took off in 2014, when Victor Ehikhamenor introduced him to Ayo Adeyinka of Tafeta Art Gallery, who he connected to on Facebook in 2013. Adeyinka also became his agent and their initial conversations would lead to the creation of his first project, ‚ÄúTribal Mark Series‚Äù. The series explored ‚Äò‚ÄôThe ancient method of facial scarification for identification and classification by caste within and among Nigerian ethnic groups‚Äô‚Äô.(https://thisisafrica.me/arts-and-culture/photorealistic-paintings- babajide-olatunji/ In the project, Babajide re-imagines the concept on fictional characters as a means of exploring identity in the context of contemporary society. Babajide Olatunji's \\"Tribal Mark Series I\\" was exhibited at the TAFETA Gallery, London in 2014 as his introduction to the global art community. His works have earned considerable recognition and has been added to private collections. Babajide Olatunji's partnership with TAFETA Art Gallery led to the production of 4 major body of works between 2014 and 2019 which he continues to develop and produce.  Artistic style  Babajide Olatunji works within but, not limited to hyperrealism and Trompe L'oeil art styles. He cites that the core of his pursuit for mastery is an understanding of the relationship between light and shadow, with reference to artists such as Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Van Rign and Jan Vermeer, who are great masters of light. Babajide Olatunji describes his art style as borne of either a thought, random feelings, random places, soliloquy, conversations, a figment of imagination or any idea that requires urgent attention or ‚Äúa bright flash annoying strobe that refuses to leave his mind until something is done about it‚Äù. He mostly adopts the artistic style of storytelling through art to attract and retain attention that inspires conversations. This is reflected in his collection of works, where, he used graphite on paper and coal on paper, before changing to charcoal and pastels. His creative process starts with a story, created before he draws the desired morphological features, after a detailed study of concepts to produce distinct figures. He feeds his creativity through extensive periods of research, solitude and long walks. The rendering process of his existing collection of works, which may take days or years, to complete, starts with creative imaginings of the subject of the painting, defining characteristic features, skin-type and where necessary imagining a medical history as employed during the development of the \\"Tribal Mark Series\\", after which he initiates the production process. He is mostly spotted with an afro, shirt and shorts while often dancing to his favorite genres of music such as Jazz, while working. He currently works with oil pastels and acrylic, a combination that was seen as nearly impossible in the creation of photo-realism.  Notable works  = Tribal Mark Series I‚ÄìIV (2014‚Äìpresent) = The Tribal Mark series is Babajide's maiden professional project initiated by his partnership with TAFETA Art Gallery in 2013. The project is a collection of portraits with the cultural practice of facial scarification, created without seaters as muses, initial contact or original photographs of the individuals. This approach to the project helped him to understand the underlying mechanisms of the face and its interactions with other parts of the body. The facial scarification in this collection of works depicted as Tribal marks, is attributed to the people of cultures across African countries, most especially the Yoruba people in Nigeria. He was fascinated by how specific people with tribal marks were identified during the slave trade era, in correlation to people across other cultures of the world. The project introduced an exploration to a 200-year old practice of identification and beautification through tribal marks (called ‚ÄúIla‚Äù) by people of Yoruba culture during the era of slave trade. He explored the portraits as a medium of expressing the uniqueness of identity as art by embodying the personality, character experiences and stories hidden behind the faces in the portraits. He created a mini series within the project themed Twins (Diptych) which was selected to be showcased at the Royal Academy of Art‚Äôs summer exhibition. The Twins (Diptych) exhibition ran from 13th June ‚Äì 20th August at the Burlington House in London. This maiden project was well received by the art community both locally and internationally and has been exhibited across the world.http://www.tink-africa.com/stpries/these- incredible-artworks-are-drawings-not-photographs The project has created memorable experiences for the artist, such as seeing a lady that resembled a portrait he had painted during the series without any prior meeting. The project is host to about 70 portraits created till date. = The Book of Proverbs (2015‚Äìresent) = The Book of Proverbs is a project that illustrates Yoruba proverbs Babajide learnt while growing up. The project was inspired by the nostalgic experiences of his childhood interactions with his parents and their utterances of proverbs to communicate intentions that weren't easily articulated but, were applicable to a wide variance of conditions. He ventured into this project to test the relevance and dynamism of the interpretation of these proverbs represented within the contemporary society. His exploration of this project brought him in contact with timeless principles that define human interactions and their interactions with their environment. One of these is titled The Martyrdom of Reason after the Yoruba proverb \\"Or√≠ b√≠b√© k√≥ ni o√≤g√πn or√≠ fif√≥,\\" which translates to \\" you cannot cure a headache by decapitation \\".‚ÄúThe Martyrdom of Reason‚Äù piece is a reaction and contribution to the preservation of proverbs that currently hold more relevance to the world's situation than ever before. = The History of the Yorubas (2018‚Äìpresent) = The History of the Yorubas explores cultural representation and storytelling of the identity of the Yorubas and their trails in the historical journey of global development.  The History of The Yorubas (Volume I): Obatala's Time at the Forge of Sokoti (Alagbede Orun) (2018)  This is Babajide Olatunji‚Äôs premier largest work and his first with acrylic on canvas, which spans more than 4 meters in length, titled ‚ÄúThe History of the Yorubas (Volume I): Obatala's time at the forge of Sokoti‚Äù. It is a piece for the Art Central, Hong Kong. It details Ob√†t√°l√°‚Äôs time at the forge of Sokoti (Alagbede Orun). This is a Yoruba creation myth in which Ob√†t√°l√°, a member of Olodumare's council of gods, thought it wise to create mankind. Upon receiving Olodumare's blessing, Ob√†t√°l√° asked Orunmila, for advice concerning what he was about starting. He activates this myth by depicting an imaginary scene where Ob√†t√°l√° visits the forge of Sokot√≠ to inspect the long and strong gold chain to reach √íde Ay√© (earth) from √ås√°l√∫ √írun (the abode of the gods). The painting is encoded with hidden proverbs and meanings, including triangular compositions which reflect Yoruba belief in the significance of the number three.  The History of the Yorubas (Volume II): Efunsetan Aniwura: Iyalode of Ibadan (2019)  A 250cm by 300 cm acrylic on primed linen canvas illustrating the socio-economic position of Iyalode Efunsetan Aniwura, a significantly influential figure of Ibadan's cultural ecosystem of the 19th century. The painting illustrates a visit to trade inventories of war with Efunsetan who was a respected merchant and political icon of her time. The piece bears cryptic Youruba messages highlighted by cultural elements within it that provide insight into the personalities within the painting, the nature of the meeting and the relationship between the elements in the piece. The composition of the piece is set in a simple linear perspective and employs the golden ratio in its pattern of illustrating the position and sizes of the characters to reflect their relevance in the painting. The piece was exhibited at the UK's Contemporary African Art Fair at the Somerset House in London, as part of UK Black History Month celebrations. = Aroko (2019) = Aroko is a series of pieces exploring the ancient practice of sending cryptic messages through simple everyday objects, with the messenger unaware of the intention conveyed by the items exchanged between the sender and the receiver. The central theme was inspired from his study of a book that described ancient cultures and their methods of communication. Objects like stones, gunpowder, honey, leaves and fish were some of the items used for this ancient practice, this series brings these elements to life and illustrates some direct aroko messages.

Site of Mablethorpe Station in 2018. Only a short section of platform remains as seen in the middle. The Louth and East Coast Railway opened its line, approaching Mablethorpe from the North, in 1877. This was followed by the opening of the Sutton and Willoughby Railway and Dock company in 1886; it had planned to create a large fishing dock at Sutton le Marsh, but it was unable to generate the capital to do so. Abandoning the dock idea, instead it built a connecting line to Mablethorpe, approaching from the south, and opening in 1888. Together the lines formed a loop off the main line. The two small companies sold their concerns to the Great Northern Railway in 1902 (S&WR;) and 1908 (L&ECR;). Mablethorpe developed very considerably as a holiday and excursion destination, facilitated by the railway connection, and the GNR did much to foster the business, running through excursions from Midlands towns, and later London, as well as handling holiday visitors. The local traffic was never significant, and the L&ECR; section closed in 1960; as seaside holidays in Britain lost popularity, the remaining line declined and was closed in 1970. Origins In 1848 the Great Northern Railway had opened its East Lincolnshire Line, having leased the unbuilt line from the East Lincolnshire Railway Company in 1846. The new line connected Boston and Grimsby, running in a largely straight line, through the market centre of Louth. This left a considerable number of important small towns unconnected to the railway network, and a number of independent companies were created to make branch lines. In the later decades of the nineteenth century, seaside watering places were beginning to rise in importance; a branch line to Skegness had been authorised in 1869 Stephen Walker, Firsby to Wainfleet and Skegness, KMS Books, Boston, 1987, , page 7 and Mablethorpe aspired to have its own connection. Louth and East Coast Railway Mablethorpe lines in 1886The Louth and East Coast Railway was incorporated on 18 July 1872 to make a line from Louth to Mablethorpe, a branch from Saltfleetby to North Somercotes, and a spur from this branch to Saltfleetby Haven. Authorised share capital was ¬£96,000.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume II: Expansion and Competition, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1979, , pages 68 and 69Paul Anderson, Railways of Lincolnshire, Irwell Press, Oldham, 1992, , page 67Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , page 342Ernest F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959, page 409 The company had arranged with the Great Northern Railway to work the line for 50% of receipts for 21 years. However nothing was done towards actual construction, and on 17 May 1877 the Louth and East Coast Railway obtained a second Act, allowing an extension of time for construction, and deviation of the branches. (In fact the branches were never made.)Carter, page 410 Opening Construction proceeded, and public traffic began on 17 October 1877, after a ceremonial opening the previous day. The line was 11 miles 68 chains long, generally straight and level. It diverged from the main line at Mablethorpe junction, 1 mile 8 chains south of Louth; the junction was aligned for direct running from Louth to Mablethorpe. There were 12 level crossings over public roads and six wooden underbridges. Stations and sidings were provided at Grimoldby, Saltfleetby, Theddlethorpe and Mablethorpe. At the suggestion of the GNR, Mablethorpe station was laid out to handle a large excursion traffic, although only one line was in use at first. The contractor, Henry Jackson, went bankrupt owing the GNR ¬£800 for haulage.Stewart E Squires, The Lost Railways of Lincolnshire, Castlemead Publications, Ware, 1986 , pages 38 and 39Robin Leleux, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 9: The East Midlands, David and Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1976, , pages 205 ‚Äì 208Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Branch lines to Skegness and Mablethorpe, also to Spilsby and Coningsby, Middleton Press, Midhurst 2016 Sutton and Willoughby Railway Mablethorpe lines in 1888In the early 1880s there were plans for a great fishing port to rival Grimsby. It was to be situated near the village of Sutton le Marsh two miles south of Mablethorpe. The location was considered to offer an excellent location for a new harbour. The Sutton and Willoughby Railway and Dock Company (S&WR;) was projected to connect it to the East Lincolnshire main line, and on 28 July 1884 it was authorised.Grant, page 546 It was to construct a line from Willoughby (on the East Lincolnshire main line) to Sutton le Marsh and build docks there; authorised share capital was ¬£60,000. The traditional name of Sutton had been Sutton-le-Marsh; the S&WR; used a new name, Sutton-on-Sea, which was much more encouraging.Wrottesley, volume 2, pages 145 and 146 At first the GNR refused to work the line until the Sutton docks were built, fearing that there would be little income from the bare agricultural district alone, but on 9 August 1886 it agreed to work it for 50% of the receipts for 21 years. The GNR also agreed to renew the working arrangement with the L&ECR; on the existing terms for 21 years from the date the S&WR; opened. The dock was never made; the S&WR; was unable to raise enough money to consider its construction. In December 1886 a fresh concern, the North Sea Fisheries Harbour and Dock Company promoted it again, but the GNR would not help, and this scheme too foundered. The line between Willoughby Junction and Sutton was given a formal opening formal opening on 23 September 1886, but general traffic did not start until 4 October 1886. The single line from the junction at Willoughby to Sutton was 7 miles 13 chains in extent. There was one intermediate station at Mumby Road; there were five trains each way on weekdays only. The GNR built a new station at Willoughby nearer the junction: it was provided with three platform faces, the up platform being an island, and new signal boxes were built there and at the junction. The station was completed early in 1887. The Sutton and Willoughby Company was asked to pay ¬£3,966 for its proportion of the new station, the junction and signalbox, and a ticket platform on its line. Completing the loop Sutton-on-Sea railway station in the 1960s)Seeing that the harbour scheme would not proceed, the Sutton and Willoughby Railway decided instead to link its line with Mablethorpe directly; the gap was modest. The L&ECR; company had reservations about admitting the Sutton company into its station, but after some deliberation agreed, and made arrangements to modify the station for through running. The S&WR; obtained another Act on 25 September 1886, authorising an extension of its railway (which was not yet open to the public) to an end-on junction with the Louth and East Coast Railway at Mablethorpe. The extension formed a loop line of the East Lincolnshire Line, and it was opened on 14 July 1888. It was 2 miles 47 chains in extent. Mablethorpe station was altered for through running. The line crossed the Alford and Sutton Tramway, and special arrangements were made at the intersection. From 22 July, Sunday trains ran from Leicester to Sutton and Mablethorpe via Willoughby.Wrottesley, volume 2, page 163 Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway The Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway was authorised in 1891. It was an ambitious scheme to build a line across the country and to take over the Sutton Harbour scheme. Financial problems overtook the project and the Sutton Harbour idea was forgotten.Chris Booth, The Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway, Fonthill Media Limited, 2017, , page 10 Absorbed by Great Northern Railway By the end of the nineteenth century the Sutton and Willoughby Railway was in serious financial difficulty, and had been discussing with the GNR the possibility of the larger concern buying it out. In January 1900 the GNR offered to absorb it for ¬£40,000. The stumbling block for the GNR was the magnitude of debentures that the S&WR; had outstanding, which in any purchase the GNR would have to take on. (The S&WR; had been \\"extravagantly\\" built.) In December 1901 the GNR arranged an advance of ¬£21,000 from the Union Bank and took over ¬£28,000 of S&W; debentures; it took over the line for ¬£40,500, also letting the S&WR; off a ¬£6,495 debt. This was finally arranged in March 1902. There were then about five trains each way on ordinary weekdays, but in the summer excursion trains came from Derby, Nottingham, and Leicester, allowing five hours at the seaside at Sutton and Mablethorpe.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume III: Twentieth Century to Grouping, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1981, , page 57 The L&ECR; saw that the S&WR; had achieved a successful outcome in being purchased by the GNR, and gave consideration to its own future. In August 1906 the price of ¬£87,000 was agreed. An absorption bill was passed on 1 August 1908.Wrottesley, volume 3, page 96 Goods traffic Mablethorpe railway station in the 1920sThe goods traffic of the district was agricultural. The Mablethorpe loop helped local farmers considerably: for example it was far easier and cheaper to send cattle to Louth market On the L&ECR; each small station had a cattle pen together with a siding and loading dock. Mablethorpe was planned as the railhead for a wide area, so facilities were more generous and included a brick goods shed together with a long siding for coal merchants. Passenger train services Louth station on the East Lincolnshire Line, was the northern terminus of the Mablethorpe Loop Railway until 1960. Over the years, loop passenger services were quite varied. Some of the 8 to 10 ordinary trains a day ran from Louth to Willoughby, but there were also Mablethorpe to Willoughby and Sutton to Louth workings. Certain summer trains were extended to Grimsby, Firsby, Grantham and even Nottingham. A steam railmotor was used on the line from 1905. Squires adds some detail: The line became increasingly popular with holidaymakers in the first decade of the twentieth century. In 1906 on August Bank Holiday, 5,400 people took advantage of the three shillings return fare from Kings Cross to Mablethorpe, and the total number of excursionists for the summer was 92 000. Theddlethorpe railway stationMablethorpe was always popular with people from the Nottingham area. From the early days there was a weekday through train between the two, via Grantham and Boston. This service operated until the outbreak of war in 1939. By 1914, on peak summer Saturdays, there were four return through-trains between Nottingham and Mablethorpe, and one each from Leicester, Leeds and Bradford, and Manchester via Sheffield. The traffic was not confined to weekends, for weekday specials also ran from Midlands towns in their holiday weeks, but Sunday was the peak day. On the busiest days, storage was a problem, and Mablethorpe's three carriage sidings were fully used. Goods sidings were pressed into use, and finally the line north to Louth, on which no Sunday service ran, was filled up with trains end to end. Many of the engines from these trains were too large for the small turntable, and they were despatched, three at a time, to Firsby, to be turned via the triangle there formed by the Skegness branch junctions. The greatest number of excursion trains in one day was August Bank Holiday Sunday, 1951, when there were nineteen.Squires, pages 39 to 42 Flooding emergency in 1953 The railway became a lifeline in 1953: on the night of 31 January a surge of water in the North Sea caught the east coast of England unawares and as night fell the dunes south of Sutton on Sea were breached. There was severe flooding, up to five feet deep in places, and several people were drowned. One Mablethorpe family escaped by using a platelayers‚Äô trolley on the line. The whole area was evacuated and a battle began to close the gap through which successive tides continued to flood. The Army and civilian contractors were called in and between them they used 40,000 tons of Scunthorpe slag, brought by rail to Sutton on Sea over a two-week period, to stem the tide. Train loads were delivered to Alford, from where they were delivered, sixteen 12-ton wagon loads at a time. Brand new diesel multiple units replaced steam traction on Mablethorpe local services in 1956. In 1960 there were diesel services working 8 trips over the full length of the loop. Passenger traffic was booming and there were many extras south of Mablethorpe particularly on Saturdays, and two on Sundays. Closures Grimoldby station buildingThe southward connection to Mablethorpe via Willoughby had always dominated in serving the holiday traffic. The decline in the use of rural railways for ordinary passenger and goods business was heavily felt in the locality and the line between Louth and Mablethorpe closed completely on 5 December 1960. However on one night in the summer of 1961, a late night return excursion to Lincoln had to traverse the route because of a derailment on the level crossing at the south end of Mablethorpe Station, so that the train was unable to run on its ordinary route direct to Willoughby. Theddlethorpe station The Willoughby connection too was under consideration for closure, but it was retained because the summer traffic was buoyant: 402,000 passengers arrived at Mablethorpe by rail in 1962. The line lost its goods service on 30 June 1964. Pay-trains were introduced in 1968, and the line still enjoyed a good level of service, with eleven up and ten down trains a day. However as part of a rationalisation scheme throughout the district, the branch closed completely on 5 October 1970, together with the East Lincolnshire Line north of Firsby.

During the 2019 Moscow City Duma election he was a member of election team of Lyubov Sobol. Together with her, he went on a hunger strike in protest against non-admission to the election. On 2 August he was arrested on charges of participating in the riots on 27 July 2019. Early life and education Aleksey was born in a family of graduates from the History Department of Moscow State University, although his father had to go into the fire guards so that the family could live in Moscow. Minyailo is an Orthodox Christian and was an altar boy in the church of St. Tatiana on Mokhovaya Street. He invited friends who rarely go to church to celebrate Easter together, helping them not to feel like strangers there. He graduated from the History Department of Moscow State University as did his parents, but refused to stay there for graduate study. Later he studied at the IEDC-Bled School of Management and he was supposed to defend a dissertation in 2019. He worked as an editor in a business magazine and as a business development manager in an advertising agency. He participated in the creation of an adaptation programs for children from orphanages. He also introduced project teaching methods in Russian higher education. 2019 Moscow City Duma election and imprisonment During the 2019 Moscow City Duma election he helped Lyubov Sobol to train signature collectors, and after she went on a hunger strike, joined her. On the night of August 1, the Investigative Committee of Russia came to him with a house-check, and then detained him. On 2 August, on the 20th day of the hunger strike, he was arrested for two months on charges of involvement in the mass riots. Lyubov Sobol considers the arrest of Minyaylo to be a pressure on herself. The charge was brought only in part 2 of article 212 of the Criminal Code (3‚Äì8 years imprisonment). Minyailo pleaded not guilty and pointed out that he had been in court together with Sobol (she was detained before the announced rally) for almost the entire day of July 27 and was detained on the way to Trubnaya Square. The leaders of several well- known Russian charitable foundations spoke in support of Minyaylo. On August 15, an appeal was pending in court. The court refused to replace imprisonment with house arrest or bail. In his last word, Minyaylo said that he decided to end the hunger strike, just as Sobol did. On 17 September dozens Orthodox priests signed a public petition in defense of prisoners in the \\"Moscow case\\". In this petition Minyaylo was especially mentioned as \\"the Orthodox person who is actively involved in social and charitable work.\\" On 24 September a number of well-known actors, directors, public figures and representatives of the charity sector signed an open letter to Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in support of Minyaylo. Next day dozens of historians (including a corresponding member of Russian Academy of Science) signed an open letter demanding to stop the case of so-called mass riots. \\"We believe that Alexey Minyailo and the other defendants are innocent,\\" the letter said. At the trial on September 26, Minyailo was released from custody without any other restrictions on freedom, although the investigator requested a house arrest. The judge noted that in the materials of the case against Minyailo there are no signs of mass riots.

To the west of Benbrack, at the end of a long spur, is the subsidiary, and similarly named summit of Knockbrack at (, meaning \\"speckled hill\\"). To the north of Benbrack, is the other subsidiary summit of Benbaun, at , which can confused with the larger 729-metre Benbaun to the south, and therefore its other Irish language place name (meaning \\"knoll\\"), can be used instead. Benbrack lies at the intersection of two major U-shaped valleys, with Glencorbet to the east, and Polladirk to the west (Polladirk can be viewed from a popular scenic viewpoint on the summit of Diamond Hill). To the northwest of Benbrack, is the small valley and river of Mweelin , around which Knockbrack, Benbrack and Benbaun (477 m) form a small horseshoe, popular with walkers.  Hill walking  The most straightforward route to climb Benbrack is a 5-kilometre 2.5-hour round- trip via its subsidiary peak of Benbaun, starting and ending at the car-park in Kylemore Abbey (L747583); this route can be expanded into the 7-kilometre 3.5 hour Mweelin Horseshoe, by descending via Knockbrack. Benbrack is also climbed as part of the Glencorbet Horseshoe, a 14-kilometre 6‚Äì7 hour circuit of Kylemore River, usually done counter-clockwise, which takes in the peaks of Benbaun (477 metres), Benbrack, Muckanaght (optional), Benfree, Benbaun (729 metres), and ending at Knockpasheemore.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. The building has been rehabilitated into residences, and is now part of the Elton Park lofts. History Automobile taxis were first introduced in Detroit in the late 19th century. By the 1910s, automobile taxis were commonplace, with stiff competition between organized taxi companies and independent operators. In 1921, some of Detroit‚Äôs independent taxicab operators organized into a confederation, soon named the \\"Checker Taxicab Service,\\" and later the \\"Checker Cab Company.\\" Checker undercut its competition on prices and allowed owner-operators to join, and by 1922 ran 85 cabs, increasing to 240 in 1924. In 1923, Checker Cab moved into new offices in the General Motors Building. One of Checker's largest rivals, the Detroit Cab Company, was organized in 1910 as the Detroit Garage Company (later the Detroit Taxicab and Transfer Company). By the early 1920s, the company was the largest taxicab company in Detroit. By 1921, the company had purchased a yard at the corner of Trumbull and Plum, where it built several single-story buildings, including a garage and office. In 1927, Detroit Cab constructed a new, multi-story garage and office building. The new building was designed by the Detroit branch of the Wisconsin Bridge and Iron Company. In 1929, the Checker Cab Company purchased the Detroit Cab Company, and by 1931 had moved its headquarters out of the General Motors Building and into the Trumbull facility. The Great Depression caused many of Checker's rivals to go out of business, and by the late 1930s most of the registered cabs in the city were Checker's. The company did well in the postwar years, but struggled in the 1970s and 1980s. However, it rebounded later, and remained the largest cab company in Michigan into the 2010s. Checker remained in the building on Trumbull until 2016, when it sold the building for redevelopment into loft space. The building was refurbished as part of the Elton Park development in 2018. Description The Checker Cab Building is a three-story, flat-roofed commercial-style brick building measuring 292 by 124 feet. It has a steel and concrete frame, and is faced with red-brown brick and cast concrete. The main facade is symmetrical, seven bays wide. The center bay is narrow, containing a single window with a pedestrian door on the first floor. The two flanking bays have paired windows; above these three bays is a gabled parapet. The remaining bays on each side are four- and two-window bays. The four-window bays contain garage doors on the first floor level. The bays are divided by brick piers trimmed with flat cast concrete bands at each floor level. The windows have cast concrete sills and soldier course brick lintels. The Plum Street facade is thirteen bays long, with red-brown brick like the main facade. The three bays nearest Trumbull contain tripled double-hung windows; the remainder contain steel factory windows.

The son of the essayist William Lucas Collins, he was born in Glamorgan at Cheriton in June 1848. Collins was educated at Radley College, before going up to Jesus College, Oxford. He did not feature in first-class cricket for Oxford University, at a time when the side was dominated by players from Brasenose College. He married Margaret Elizabeth Stepford Sackville in 1882. He eventually played first-class cricket in 1884, when he played for the Gentlemen of England against Oxford University at Oxford. He played again for the Gentlemen of England in 1886, this time against I Zingari in the Scarborough Festival of 1886. Held in high regard by C. I. Thornton, Collins was invited by him to play for Lord Londesborough's XI against the touring Australians at the festival. In the Lord Londesborough's XI first-innings total of 558, Collins came into bat at number eleven, scoring 56 runs. He played again at the 1887 Scarborough Festival in two first-class matches, for the Gentlemen of England against I Zingari and for the South in the North v South fixture. He was invited to play for the Oxford University Past and Present cricket team against the touring Australians at Leyton in 1888, taking figures of 6 for 35 in the Australians first-innings. His final first-class appearance came three years later for H. Philipson's XI against Oxford University. Across seven first-class matches, Collins scored 157 runs at an average of 19.62, while with the ball he took 19 wickets at a bowling average of 23.57. He played below first-class at county level for Northamptonshire, Hertfordshire and, in one match in 1903, for Shropshire.Published under Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians. Away from playing cricket, Collins was a regular contributor to Blackwood's Magazine and published two works of fiction set in Oxford: The Don and the Undergraduate (1899) and A Scholar of his College (1900). Collins died in January 1932 at Summerhill, Heacham, Norfolk.Shropshire Cricketers 1844-1998, page 10. He was described by A. J.

All the main events and event venues are located on the Maes. Background Central to the Maes is the competition venue, often a large temporary pavilion. From 2006 until 2014, the National Eisteddfod of Wales used a large pink pavilion, which arrived in four articulated lorries and took four days to erect. Prior to that, the pavilion had been a stripy green and yellow tent. The Maes is usually located in a field or on open farmland. In 2017 the National Eisteddfod of Wales was almost cancelled when, on the initial weekend of the event, the Maes was turned into a sea of mud by stormy weather. The carparks on nearby farmland became unusable. A later report also concluded the accessibility for disabled visitors to the Maes was inadequate. Normally the Maes in enclosed by a fence and an entrance fee is charged. However, in 2018 the National Eisteddfod was held in Cardiff Bay with an open, fence-free Maes. Existing, permanent buildings were used in the immediate area for the competitions and events, with an admission fee charged for these. Because of the additional security costs the event lost ¬£290,000, but attracted an estimated 500,000 visitors, as opposed to the usual 150,000. Maes B Maes of the National Eisteddfod from early years divided into different fields and Maes B began as the alternative field purely for young people.

He was a specialist on the bryophytes especially from the Himalayan region. He has been called the father of Indian bryology. Early life Kashyap was born in Jhelum District in a family that had members in the army. He studied at the University of Punjab in Lahore, receiving a medical diploma from Agra in 1904. He worked briefly in the medical service of the United Provinces during which time he privately appeared and qualified for the B.Sc. In 1909 he obtained a M.Sc. in botany. Obtaining the Arnold and Maclagan Gold medals, he went to Cambridge University in 1910 and passed the Natural Science Tripos in 1912. He then joined the Government College at Lahore as a professor of biology founding the botany department in 1919. He was a founding member of the Indian Botanical Society in 1920 and edited its journal. Academic career Following his return from England, he was appointed Professor of Botany at the Government College, Lahore, and he was promoted to the Indian Educational Service in 1920. In 1919, when the Honours School in Botany was established by Panjab University, he was appointed University Professor of Botany, where he served until his death. He was an elected Fellow of the University for many years and served as Dean of the Science Faculty. A member of the University Syndicate, he officiated as Dean of University Instruction for a brief while in 1931. He was conferred Honoris Causa, the Degree of Doctor of Science by the University of the Punjab in 1933. Contributions in Botany He is famous for three contributions - Liverworts of the Western Himalayas, Flora of Tibet and the sexual generation of Equisetum. Kashyap studied the liverworts of the western Himalayas and the Punjab region, where he described 4 new genera and 30 new species of Liverworts. He published book 'Lahore District Flora jointly with A C Joshi in 1936. He travelled widely across the Himalayan region and being a friend of the family, was an unofficial mentor for Birbal Sahni. He was a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences from 1934. A moss genus Kashyapia (family Calymperaceae) was named in his honour by Ram Saran Chopra but this is considered an illegitimate name and a possible synonym of Syrrhopodon. Family He had two sons and three daughters. His daughter Kamini Kaushal became a famous Bollywood actress. His other daughter, Kumkum Somani has written children's books while the third daughter Kavita Sahni is an artist. Memorials An entire block in Panjab University is named after him.

In general, the conflict was focused on air-to-ground attacks and ground-based anti-aircraft fire; only one dogfight is known to have occurred. The Uganda Army Air Force dominated the air space during the initial Ugandan invasion of northwestern Tanzania, but achieved little due to bad co-ordination with ground forces and a general lack of planning. At the same time, it suffered increasingly heavy losses as pilots deserted, and the Tanzanian anti-aircraft defenses became more effective. The initiative thus switched to the Tanzania Air Defence Command which supported the country's counter-offensive into Uganda. In the conflict's later stages, the Libyan Arab Republic Air Force intervened on the side of Uganda, but failed to make a tangible impact. The Uganda Army Air Force was eventually destroyed on 7 April 1979 when Tanzanian ground forces overran its main air base at Entebbe. The remaining Ugandan loyalist air pilots subsequently fled the country or joined the Libyan military.  Background to the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War  In 1971 Colonel Idi Amin launched a military coup that overthrew the President of Uganda, Milton Obote, precipitating a deterioration of relations with neighbouring Tanzania. Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere had close ties with Obote and had supported his socialist orientation. Amin installed himself as President of Uganda and ruled the country under a repressive dictatorship. Nyerere withheld diplomatic recognition of the new government and offered asylum to Obote and his supporters. With the approval of Nyerere, these Ugandan exiles organised a small army of guerillas, and attempted, unsuccessfully, to invade Uganda and remove Amin in 1972. Amin blamed Nyerere for backing and arming his enemies, and retaliated by bombing Tanzanian border towns. Subsequent mediation resulted in the signing of the Mogadishu Agreement, which established a demilitarised zone at the border and required that both countries refrain from supporting opposition forces that targeted each others' governments. Nevertheless, relations between the two presidents remained tense; Nyerere frequently denounced Amin's regime, and Amin made repeated threats to invade Tanzania. Uganda also disputed its border with Tanzania, claiming that the Kagera Salient‚Äîa stretch of land between the official border and the Kagera River 18 miles to the south, should be placed under its jurisdiction, maintaining that the river made for a more logical border. The circumstances immediately surrounding the outbreak of the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War in 1978 remain unclear.  Opposing forces  = Uganda = MiG-21s (MiG-21MF example pictured in the service of the Bangladesh Air Force). The Uganda Army Air Force (UAAF) was established in 1964 with Israeli aid. Its first aircraft was consequently of Israeli origin, and its initial pilots trained in Israel. As Uganda's government forged closer links with the Eastern Bloc, the UAAF began to acquire more aircraft as well as support in training from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Libya. Israeli aid initially continued as well. The UAAF was gradually expanded, and several air bases were built. Following Amin's coup in 1971, the Ugandan military began to deteriorate. International support for Amin's regime eroded over the next years. Israel turned from an ally into an enemy, and the relations with the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia worsened as well though they were not completely severed. The foreign supply of aircraft and spare parts for the UAAF was gradually cut off. As result, it became increasingly difficult to maintain the UAAF's fighters. At the same time, tribalism, corruption, and repeated purges negatively affected the military's combat capabilities. Furthermore, the Israeli-initiated Operation Entebbe resulted in the destruction of a quarter of the UAAF in 1976; Amin's regime subsequently received a substantial number of replacement MiG-21s from the Soviet Union and Libya. By late 1978, the UAAF was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Gore and consisted of several dozen MiG-21MFs, MiG-21UMs, MiG-17s, MiG-15UTIs, and L-29s. In addition, several unarmed trainer and transport aircraft were in service, including a single Lockheed C-130 Hercules cargo transport. The exact number of Ugandan combat aircraft at the time of the war's outbreak is disputed. According to J. Paxton, Uganda possessed 10 MiG-21s, 12 MiG-17s, 2 MiG-15s, and 5 L-29s, while journalist Dominique Lagarde stated that the UAAF consisted of 12 MiG-21s, 10 Mig-17s, 2 MiG-15s, and 12 L-29s. Some of the available aircraft were not combat-ready, however, and were abandoned during the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War without seeing action. The lack of spare parts especially affected the Mig-15s and MiG-17s. The UAAF was split into three fighter squadrons. Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Mukooza commanded the MiG-17 squadron, while Lieutenant Colonel Ali Kiiza led the MiG-21 squadron which was called the \\"Suicide Strike Command\\", and nicknamed \\"Sungura\\". At least some of the Suicide Strike Command's pilots were possibly Libyan-trained Palestinians. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was known to train pilots for its own air force in Uganda. Paxton stated that the UAAF employed about 600 personnel by 1978, while Lagarde claimed that it had 1,000 personnel. In addition, the Ugandan military possessed fifty 40mm anti- aircraft guns, man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) and nine radar stations for air defence. = Tanzania = MiG-21s at Mwanza Air Base in 2010 Tanzania established its air force as the \\"Air Wing\\" (Kiswahili: Usafirashaji wa Anga) of the Tanzania People's Defence Force's (TPDF) Air Defence Command in 1965. As it was following an international policy of non- alignment, Tanzania procured aircraft and trainers from a variety of countries, most notably China, Canada, and the Soviet Union. By 1978, the Tanzanian Air Wing possessed 14 MiG-21MFs, two MiG-21UMs, 22 Shenyang J-5s (F-5), 12 Shenyang J-6s (F-6), as well as several transport and trainer aircraft. Furthermore, the country's Air Defence had access to SA-3 surface- to-air missiles, SA-7 MANPADS, 14.5mm and 36mm or 37mm anti-aircraft guns, and ground support equipment‚Äîincluding early-warning radars. The Air Wing was eventually organised into three Kikosi cha Jeshi or KJ Brigades, with each brigade focusing on one particular element of air warfare: aircraft and helicopters (601 KJ), technical support (602 KJ), and air defence (603 KJ). The fighter aircraft unit of 601 KJ, known as \\"Squadron 601\\", was based at Mwanza Air Base (MiG-21s) and Ngerengere Air Force Base (F-5s, F-6s). In 1978 the Air Defence Command employed approximately 1,000 personnel. = Libya = The Libyan Arab Republic Air Force (LARAF) intervened in the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War's later stages. The LARAF was a large and well-equipped force, though it suffered from limitations in regard to its personnel. Its squadrons were often understrength, and many pilots lacked proper training. Though it is disputed how many and which types of Libyan aircraft were sent to Uganda, the presence of at least two Tupolev Tu-22 bombers was confirmed. LARAF's Tu-22s were operated by the No. 1022 Squadron (also known as \\"Second Bomber Squadron\\"). The Libyan Tu-22s were second-hand aircraft imported from the Soviet Union, and suffered from serviceability issues; the bombers were both difficult to maintain and to fly. In addition, Libyan Tu-22 crews were regarded by their Soviet instructors as being subpar, incapable of flying sophisticated bombing missions and more interested in their own safety than carrying out their tasks.  Air campaign  = Invasion of Kagera = In early September 1978 the Tanzanians noticed a high volume of Ugandan air reconnaissance flights. By the middle of the month the Ugandan aircraft began crossing into Tanzanian airspace. Ugandan troops made their first incursion into Tanzania on 9 October 1978 when a motorised detachment entered a Tanzanian village only to be repulsed by artillery. The next day UAAF MiG fighters bombed forests in the Kagera Salient without effect. On 18 October, Ugandan MiGs bombed Bukoba, the capital of the West Lake Region. Despite facing ineffectual Tanzanian anti- aircraft fire, the bombings caused little damage. However, the explosions' reverberations shattered windows and incited the population to panic. On 25 October the Uganda Army attempted to invade northern Tanzania. The ground attack was repulsed by artillery, but UAAF MiGs continued to cross into Tanzanian airspace, where they were again harassed by ineffectual anti- aircraft fire. Ugandan MiGs bombed Bukoba and the Kyaka Bridge‚Äîa key crossing over the Kagera River‚Äîon 21 and 27 October; most of their bombs hit forests, but one barely missed Bukoba's hospital. The second attack prompted Bukoba's residents to flee the town. Tanzanian SA-7 MANPAD (example pictured) teams shot down several Ugandan MiGs during the war On 27 October, the first Tanzanian reinforcements arrived in the war zone. Among them was a team of six soldiers equipped with SA-7 MANPADS who took up position at Kyaka, and waited for enemy aircraft to enter their range. Around this time, the UAAF was ordered to bomb Tanzania's Field Tactical Headquarters at Kapwepwe. The pilots selected for the mission were Lieutenant David Omita, Lieutenant Atiku, Lieutenant Abusala, and possibly Lieutenant Walugembe. Flying MiG-21s, they carried out the sortie, but as they returned to Uganda crossed into air space protected by the SA-7 team. The Tanzanians promptly hit the right wing of Omita's plane. He managed to safely eject just before his MiG exploded, and parachuted into a forest. From there, he managed to escape to Mutukula in Uganda. Amin's government admitted the loss, but downplayed it by claiming to have shot down several Tanzanian fighters which had allegedly attempted to bomb Ugandan cities. Furthermore, Amin promoted Omita, Atiku, Abusala, and Walugembe to the rank of captain. On 30 October the Ugandan Army launched a second invasion of northern Tanzania. Tanzanian forces were overwhelmed and quickly withdrew south of the Kagera River. Fearing that the TPDF could stage a counter-attack across the Kyaka Bridge, Ugandan commanders ordered it to be destroyed. The UAAF attacked the crossing from 1 to 3 November; these air strikes either missed or proved ineffective. In contrast, the Tanzanian SA-7 team advanced up to the bridge and reportedly shot down several Ugandan MiGs during these days. After the repeated failures by their air force, the Ugandans finally employed a mining specialist who successfully destroyed the Kyaka Bridge. Meanwhile, the TPDF's high command decided to redeploy a squadron of F-6s to Mwanza. As the fighters approached the air base on 3 November, however, they entered the air space protected by a Tanzanian SA-3 team as well as anti-aircraft artillery. The latter had not been informed about the redeployment, and mistook the F-6s for enemy fighters, opening fire. One aircraft was hit, and its pilot Ayekuwa Akiirusha was killed. Another fighter diverted from its course and crashed after running out of fuel, though its pilot safely ejected. The other F-6s braved the anti-aircraft fire and successfully landed at Mwanza. A monument was later built in honour of Akiirusha. Several other Tanzanian aircraft, mostly MiGs, were lost due to other accidents during the war. On 2 November Nyerere declared war on Uganda. After some probes, the TPDF launched a counter-offensive to retake the Kagera Salient on 23 November, encountering little resistance. Four UAAF MiGs carried out air strikes on that day: two bombed the landing strip at Bukoba without causing much damage, while two others were hit by anti-aircraft fire during an attack on Mwanza Air Base. One plane crashed and its pilot, Nobert Atiku, was taken prisoner after ejecting. The other MiG was badly damaged by a SA-7, but its pilot, Ali Kiiza, successfully returned to Entebbe Air Base. MiG-17 squadron commander Andrew Mukooza also flew an attack against targets in northern Tanzania, and was almost shot down by anti-aircraft missiles. One Ugandan aircraft crashed into Lake Victoria after returning to Uganda from an unsuccessful strike in Kagera. The Ugandan government again claimed to have successfully defeated a Tanzanian bombing raid during this time. In fact, no Tanzanian aircraft entered Ugandan air space until 1979. = Disintegration of the Uganda Army Air Force = Map of the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War Following the reconquest of Kagera, the TPDF began to prepare an offensive into Uganda. The UAAF had lost several fighters up to this point, and opted to fly no more attacks into Tanzania. As result, it missed the opportunity to disrupt the assembly of Tanzanian troops as they amassed along the border. A large-scale Tanzanian artillery bombardment began on 25 December. The UAAF was ordered to respond, but its attacks failed to destroy the Tanzanian artillery. Instead, another Ugandan MiG was shot down by SA-7s in January 1979. The TPDF began its advance into Uganda on 21 January, capturing and destroying the border town of Mutukula. The Tanzanians then constructed an air strip in the locale so transport aircraft could resupply the troops at the front lines. After an initial rest and further preparations, the Tanzanian forces along with allied Ugandan rebels resumed their offensive. The UAAF continued to attack the Tanzanian-led ground forces and supply bases during this time, while the TPDF's Air Wing began to make its first incursions into Ugandan air space. The most fierce air combat of the war occurred during the Battle of Simba Hills from 11 February 1979. The UAAF repeatedly attacked the TPDF troops at Simba Hills, encountering heavy resistance from SA-7 teams; the TPDF later claimed to have shot down 19 Ugandan aircraft. The Tanzanian Air Wing also bombed Ugandan positions during the battle. After two days of fighting, the Simba Hills fell to the Tanzanian-led forces. The TPDF also captured the Lukoma air strip, which had been used by the UAAF MiGs to stage raids in Tanzanian territory. Two Ugandan MiG-21s attacked the Lukoma air strip on 14 February in an attempt to destroy Tanzanian transport aircraft. The raid was easily repelled by the TPDF, as Tanzanian MiGs and ground forces responded and forced the Ugandans to flee. On 27 February, four UAAF MiG-21s attempted to bomb the Mutukula air strip, but three were reportedly shot down by SA-7s, with one Ugandan pilot taken prisoner. Following its devastating losses during February 1979, the UAAF was effectively eliminated as a fighting force, although it continued to fly missions. In March, the only known dogfight of the war took place, as a Tanzanian fighter shot down a UAAF MiG-21 near Byesika along the Masaka‚ÄìMubende road. The Ugandan pilot was killed, while the successful Tanzanian pilot remains unidentified. On 4 March UAAF MiGs were fielded against Ugandan rebels who were conducting a raid on the border town of Tororo, forcing them to retreat into Kenya. By this point, the UAAF increasingly suffered from the loss of manpower through deaths, defections and desertions. Its commander Christopher Gore either fled to Sudan or was killed in an ambush, leaving Andrew Mukooza as acting commander of the force. An Ugandan soldier interviewed by the Drum magazine stated that two pilots deserted with their MiG-21s, while others suffered from mental breakdowns. One pilot went absent without leave after flying several missions and was arrested and sentenced to death; he was later freed from prison by Tanzanian troops. Kiiza was one of those who deserted during the war's last stages. Following Kiiza's disappearance, at least some Ugandan soldiers falsely believed that he had been shot down in combat and died. A lack of spare parts and competent mechanics further undermined the UAAF's capabilities, reportedly grounding the remaining MiG-15s and MiG-17s. = Libyan intervention and end of the air campaign = Libyan Tupolev Tu-22 bomber in 1977 Faced with repeated defeats, Amin's regime was in a critical position. In response, its ally Libya intervened in the war during the second half of February, sending an expeditionary force to bolster the Ugandan military. The Libyan Arab Republic Air Force (LARAF) ultimately flew in 4,500 troops as well as armour, artillery, and a substantial amount of supplies. Whether the Libyan force included a substantial number of combat aircraft is unknown. According to the Africa Research Bulletin, \\"reliable reports\\" indicated that the Libyans sent six Dassault Mirages and seven MiG-21s to Uganda. Historians Tom Cooper and Adrien Fontanellaz have argued that it is unlikely that Libyan MiG or Dassault Mirage 5 fighters were sent to Uganda, as these short-range aircraft would have been forced to refuel several times to travel to eastern Africa. No such refueling stops for Libyan fighter aircraft were reported. It has been confirmed, however, that two to four Libyan Tupolev Tu-22 bombers deployed to Nakasongola Air Base in early March. According to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, Amin also asked Japan's government to loan him Kamikaze fighters in order to use them against the Tanzanians. The Ugandan President was known for his eccentric and cruel humor, so it is unclear if it was a serious request. According to foreign diplomats based in Kampala, the PLO dispatched 15 pilots to aid Amin during the war, but played no role in the conflict due to a lack of available operational aircraft upon on their arrival. Saa Nane Island Game Sanctuary (pictured 2020) was bombed by the Libyan Arab Republic Air Force in March 1979. The remnants of the UAAF, along with the Libyan bombers, flew a number of unsuccessful air strikes during March and early April 1979. On 29 March, \\"one of the strangest incidents of the war\\" took place, as Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi ordered one of the Tu-22s to attack Mwanza. This was supposed to intimidate the Tanzanian government into calling off the invasion of Uganda. The Libyan bomber approached over Lake Victoria and aimed at destroying the fuel depot at Mwanza, but completely missed its target; its five anti-personnel rockets instead hit the Saa Nane Island Game Sanctuary, slightly injuring one worker and killing six antelopes as well as several birds. Another air strike by the Libyan Tu-22s, aimed at a military base south of the Ugandan-Tanzanian border, was carried out just as poorly. This time the bombs fell close to the town of Nyarubanga in another country, namely Burundi. Following the failed attacks, several Ugandan and Libyan aircraft relocated from Entebbe to the airbases at Nakasongola and Gulu. One Tu-22 operating from Nakasongola conducted regular sorties against Tanzanian forces in southern Uganda. The Tanzanian Air Wing retaliated by successfully bombing fuel depots at Kampala, Jinja and Tororo on 1 April. One air strike coincidentally hit and destroyed the Libya-Uganda Development Bank in Jinja. By chance, Amin was in the town at the time, and panicked when the bomb hit. According to eyewitnesses, he ran \\"into the street screaming incoherently\\". The destruction of the development bank led many Ugandan soldiers to believe that the Tanzanians had acquired special munitions that could hit select targets on command. Tanzanian MiG-21 jets also raided Entebbe Air Base, strafing the runway and setting part of the terminal ablaze, but ultimately failing to cause enough damage to halt the Libyan air lift in support of Amin's regime. Radio Uganda later announced that Amin had said the attacks by the \\"so-called Tanzanian Air Force...will not escape a very heavy punishment\\". Radio Uganda also claimed that Amin said that \\"the bombings do not worry him at all\\" and repeated that \\"Nyerere will regret the consequences\\". The TPDF also attempted to disrupt the Libyan airlift by tricking incoming planes into landing at Mwanza by sending messages to them on Entebbe Air Base's radio frequency. The Tanzanians ended this practice after one attempt, having mistakenly misdirected and seized a Belgian Sabena cargo plane. Entebbe Airport in 1994 After occupying Mpigi, Tanzanian ground forces observed a high level of air traffic at Entebbe Air Base and a large number of troops gathered around it. Their commanders decided to secure it before attacking Kampala to end Libya's support of Uganda and eliminate the hostile forces gathered there. The Tanzanians started an artillery barrage on 6 April, causing Mukooza to flee via helicopter. Lieutenant Colonel Cyril Orambi was left in command of Entebbe Air Base. On the next day, the Battle of Entebbe took place, and resulted in a decisive Tanzanian victory. A dozen UAAF MiG fighters and one Uganda Airlines Boeing 707 were disabled in the attack and left on the runway, while a Libyan C-130 (LARAF C-130H 116) was destroyed by an RPG-7 anti-tank grenade launcher as it attempted to take off. Nine or ten fighters were deemed functional enough to be seized as war prizes. They were flown to Mwanza, but one crashed on landing, killing the pilot. The next morning, 200‚Äì365 UAAF personnel led by Orambi surrendered to the TPDF. The battle marked the de facto end of the UAAF. Most of its aircraft were destroyed or captured, and the air force personnel that managed to escape to the air fields in Jinja and Nakasongola spread panic among the Ugandan forces there. Mass desertions and defections were the consequence, leaving Mukooza with no means to continue the fight. With Libyan forces having suffered heavily during the battle, Nyerere decided to allow them to flee Kampala and quietly exit the war without further humiliation. He sent a message to Gaddafi explaining his decision, saying that the Libyan troops could be airlifted out of Uganda unopposed from the airstrip in Jinja. Most of them withdrew to Kenya and Ethiopia, where they were repatriated. Tanzanian jets struck several military installations in Kampala before the ground attack on the Ugandan capital commenced. One Tanzanian fighter was reportedly shot down by Ugandan anti-aircraft fire over Lake Victoria during this time. Several members of the UAAF were captured during the Fall of Kampala on 10‚Äì11 April 1979; they were subsequently imprisoned in Bukoba. Nakasongola Air Base was found deserted by Tanzanian forces later that month; they seized Amin's personal Gulfstream executive jet. The UAAF's remaining combat aircraft were seized there and at Gulu. Some Ugandan MiG pilots fled the country; one lieutenant took refuge in Sudan, as did the commander of the UAAF's radar network. Two Ugandan pilots deserted with their aircraft around mid-April, one landing and surrendering with his family at Entebbe, while the other sought refuge at Kilimanjaro International Airport in Tanzania. The leader of the UAAF band, Bonny Kyambadde, was rumoured to have been killed while trying to flee. Mukooza surrendered on 24 April, but was murdered by Ugandan rebels. In contrast, Kiiza was employed by the new Tanzanian-backed Ugandan government. About 30 Ugandan pilots were in the Soviet Union for training when the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War broke out. After Amin's government was overthrown, they opted not to return to Uganda, and instead joined the LARAF. The war ended on 3 June 1979 when Tanzanian ground troops secured the last unoccupied portion of Ugandan territory.  Aftermath and analysis  The UAAF was left completely destroyed by the war. The post-war Ugandan government attempted to rebuild the air force over the immediate following years, but struggled due to lack of funds and only managed to acquire a few helicopters. American journalist John Darnton observed that the war had proven that the UAAF was a \\"paper tiger\\". American intelligence analyst Kenneth M. Pollack praised the Libyan airlift in Uganda as an \\"impressive operation\\", but criticised Libya's \\"incompetent\\" deployment of aircraft in combat and its failure to use aerial reconnaissance. Renewed internal conflict stymied any efforts to properly restore a Ugandan air force for decades. By 1994, the \\"Ugandan People's Defence Air Force\\" still suffered from shortages in equipment and manpower, and was limited to just 100 personnel.

The first Indian expedition to conquer Mount Everest by the Indian Army, which was led by Brigadier Gyan Singh in 1960, failed. Climbers Colonel Narendra Kumar, Sonam Gyatso, and Sherpa Nawang Gombu reached 28,300 feet (8,625 meters) just 700 feet (223 meters) from the goal, but due to extremely bad weather they had to turn back. The second Indian expedition by the Indian Army, which was led by Major John Diaz in 1962, also failed. Captain Mohan Singh Kohli, Sonam Gyatso, and Hari Dang reached nearly 400 feet (128 meters) below the peak at 28,600 feet (8,720 m), but had to give up due to bad weather. Mohan Singh Kohli was part of both these expeditions. The Indian Everest Expedition 1965 was the first successful Indian scaling of Mount Everest by the Indian Army. Preparation In 1965, the third Indian expedition, which was led by Mohan Singh Kohli and his deputy Colonel Narendra \\"Bull\\" Kumar, included 21 core members of the expedition, and around 50 climbing sherpas. The mission was sponsored by the Indian Mountaineering foundation. The team started their journey from New Delhi on 21 February and reached on Jaynagar railway station in Bihar, the Indo-Nepal border on 24 February. They arranged for 25 tons of materials for the mission from various cities of India, including food, cloths, sleeping tents, oxygen cylinders and mountaineering equipment. All materials were carried from Jaynagar railway station to base camp by 800 porters including women. The initial attempt was attempted at the end of April and due to bad weather they came back to base camp and wait two weeks for better weather. Towards the end of May, Mount Everest was scaled in four successive attempts and put nine climbers on to the summit, setting a world record which India held for 17 years. Reaching the summit India became the fourth country to scale Mount Everest. *On May 20, 1965, Lt Col Avatar. S. Cheema and Nawang Gombu Sherpa climbed the peak and stood atop Mount Everest, thus becoming the first Indians to achieve this feat. This was the second time that Nawang Gombu Sherpa climbed Mount Everest. The first was with an American expedition in 1963. He became the first to climb the Mount Everest twice. Tenzing Norgay, the first man to climb Mount Everest, was his uncle. Two days later on May 22, Sonam Gyatso and Sonam Wangyal, reached the summit, the first time that the oldest (Gyatso at 42) and the youngest (Wangyal at 23) climbed Mount Everest together. On May 24 C. P. Vohra, Ang Kami Sherpa reached the top of Mount Everest. On May 29, 12 years to the day from the first ascent, the fourth and last climb with Major H. P. S. Ahluwalia, H. C. S. Rawat, Phu Dorjee Sherpa reached the summit. This was the first time three climbers stood on the summit together. Eleven people were scheduled to climb the peak in five attempts, but Captain HV Bahuguna and Major BP Singh were forced to retreat to the peak due to physical difficulties.  Reception and honors  Mohan Singh Kohli is best known as leader of the epoch-making Indian Everest Expedition 1965. The achievement electrified the nation. Nine climbers reached the summit, creating a world record that India held for 17 years. Public euphoria reached a crescendo. People danced in the streets. On return of the team from Nepal to India, Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri headed the reception at the airport. In another unprecedented move, an Arjuna Award for the entire team and Padma Bhushan for three members including team leader and Padma Shree leader and eight members of the nine submitter was immediately announced. The tallest tribute came from former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri: ‚ÄúThe record of Commander Kohli‚Äôs expedition will find special mention in history. It was a masterpiece of planning, organisation, teamwork, individual effort and leadership‚Äù. Lal Bahadur Shastri also described the 1965 success as one of India's six major achievements after independence. A full-length film on the expedition with music by Shankar Jaikishan was released all over India and abroad. The story of the achievement was serialized in several national newspapers and magazines. Mohan Singh Kohli and other members of the team were was felicitated at Brussels, Paris, Geneva and Rome. Tenzing Norgay accompanied Captain Kohli to several countries. In India, Chief Ministers of almost all the states invited the team to their capitals and honoured them at state and civic receptions.

Considered a forerunner of anti-politics or the first Italian satirical party, the Steak Party took part in the 1953 Italian general election, promising to give people a steak every day. History Corrado Tedeschi with a steak In 1950s Florence, publisher Corrado Tedeschi, together with Ugo Cavallini, founded a political party named after their popular weekly puzzle magazine (NET). The party was nicknamed the Steak Party () with its symbol being a heifer because the political program, among other things, would deliver a daily supply of steak to every citizen. The party also had an official anthem made up of cows' moos. The party had a more than evident mocking, goliardic, surrealist intent, and just as evidently parodied the populist Common Man's Front. Despite being a joke political party, the Italian Nettist Party took part in the 7 June 1953 general elections for the Chamber of Deputies, contesting the constituencies of Rome, Florence, and Milan. Their mottos were \\"Long Live Fun!\\" (), and \\"Better a steak today than an empire tomorrow\\". The Steak Party collected 4,305 valid votes, equivalent to 0.02% at the national level (or 0.14% in just Florence). Political program Corrado Tedeschi pointing to the Steak Party program Tedeschi during a rally at Pincian Hill in Rome Corrado Tedeschi presented the Nettist Party official program for 1953 Italian general election as follows: # Leisure activities, little work, and a lot of money for everyone. Machines must replace man in the suffering of work. The characteristic of the human species is intelligence and it is by exploiting it that it must survive. # Free medical care and medicine for all. # Three months of vacation for every citizen. # of steak per person insured daily to the people, sweet fruit and coffee. # Maximum increase in all games: arts, literature, music, and dance. Life is so short and we know so little about its consistency and purpose that the most serious thing about life is the game. # Continuous raffles and lotteries will entertain the citizens of the universal state. # State Companions of variety and clowns will be supremely honored and rewarded in the Universal Republic. It is time to end the sacrifices and missions! Let us laugh and be in good health. # Abolition of all taxes. # Referendums extended to all citizens will decide each time the most important local and universal issues instead of the outdated Parliaments. Statistical machines, electronic brains, will make the gears of the scientific universal republic turn. The current employees of the State will be sent in retirement and vacation with double salary. # School lessons will be reduced to 30 hours per year. Enigmatic NET, radio, television, cinema, and various shows will educate the sovereign and Nettist people. # Existing religions will be held in the highest honour and new churches with artistic and mystical intentions will be erected. Priests of all religions will receive fair salaries that will remove them from poverty. # Abolition of prisons. When all have of insured meat, nobody will need to steal and kill. If there are any exceptions, we will treat them in asylums. We must lift humanity out of fear of war and imprisonment.

Premiering on Comedy Central on July 29, 2019, the series features discussions on popular culture topics between Spade and a rotating panel of guest comedians, as well as other filmed segments. History The series was scheduled as a lead-out for The Daily Show; since the conclusion of The Colbert Report, the timeslot had seen several short-lived attempts at Daily Show spin-offs focusing on other cast members, such as The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore and The Opposition with Jordan Klepper, which both faced low viewership. Lights Out marked the first Comedy Central program in the 11:30 timeslot to not be a news comedy program or be hosted by an alumnus of The Daily Show; network president Kent Alterman argued that viewers were being fatigued by the extensive focus on politics and the Trump administration on other late night shows, with Spade saying that his show would focus more on \\"cultural events and some Hollywood stuff, [and] weird stories in the news\\" rather than primarily focus on political humor. In March 2020, production was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 3, 2020, Comedy Central announced that it would not renew Lights Out, but that it was open to selling the program to another network; the program had only been able to retain roughly half of its audience from The Daily Show (which, as a partial replacement, began producing expanded 45-minute episodes beginning April 27).

He was famous for his duel with a black sea demon called Seri Kemboja that took place off the coast of Pahang. In another version of the legend, both Seri Pahang and Seri Kemboja, are described as giant serpents called NƒÅga. The legend Chini Lake is the second largest natural freshwater lake in Malaysia. The Chini River, which drains from the lake, flows into the Pahang River. In the local lore, the lake and its adjoining mountain are sacred, and locals credit the place with the possession of a white crocodile styled 'Seri Pahang' (Malay for 'glory of Pahang'). According to the legend, news had reached Seri Pahang about a devastating black sea demon, Seri Kemboja (the Glory of Kemboja). He vowed to fight the demon and get rid of him. So Seri Pahang left Tasik Chini and swam downstream to Kuala Pahang. There he transformed into an old man carrying a bailing pail made of palm. In the form of the old man, Seri Pahang persuaded a group of sailors to take him on board with them. Since he had a bailing pail, they thought he might be useful if the boat needed to be bailed. His bailing pail seemed to have turmeric in it. When the boat reached a spot southeast of Sedili Kechil, Seri Pahang handed the bailing pail to the nakhuda and jumped into the sea. He immediately turned into a giant white crocodile and the men were amazed to see that the turmeric in the dipper had turned to gold. This was their payment for giving Seri Pahang a ride to the spot where he wanted to challenge Seri Kemboja, the black demon. The fight between Seri Pahang and Seri Kemboja lasted long. The sea became dark, thunder rolled and lightning flashed. After a fierce battle, Seri Pahang managed to kill Seri Kemboja but he was wounded badly himself. In great pain, he swam away to Aur Island, transformed himself back into an old man and got a boat ride back to Kuala Pahang. Once he reached a village called Sekukoh on the Pahang River, he was getting a very weak, and told the sailors to stop at the mouth of the Chini River and made announcement that he is dying at Sekukoh. He then slipped into the water and changed instantly into a crocodile. Soon after leaving Sekukoh, the boat passed the mouth of Chini River but it suddenly stopped moving. One of the sailors remembered the old man's request. They turned back to the Chini River and called out that a great white crocodile is dying at Sekukoh. As soon as it was delivered, the boat could move again. Before long, hundreds of crocodiles could be seen swimming downriver to Sekukoh. There were so many crocodiles in the river that, villagers living along the banks claimed that daring young men could cross the river on backs of the crocodiles. Before he died, the great white crocodile, asked the ruler of Pahang to give him a proper religious burial. After learning how the crocodile had killed the sea demon, the ruler agreed. That is how Seri Pahang came to be buried in a sandy pit near Sekukoh. The place is known to this day as Makam Tok Pahang ('Tok Pahang's Tomb'). Relation with Pahang rulers In 1914, when Sultan Ahmad died, people saw twenty six crocodiles cruising in a ‚ÄúV‚Äù formation in Pahang River, heading upriver. Behind them came a shoal of fish fanned out across the river. The people cast nets, but the fish magically escaped. These were a type of fish usually lives in Chini Lake. The people believed that the crocodiles and fish were coming back from the funeral of Sultan Ahmad. They had been paying their respects in gratitude, because the Sultan‚Äôs ancestor had buried Seri Pahang properly at Sekukoh before he died.

The names may mean higher education, but also education of girls (or daughters) of the upper classes. Some early institutions of higher education for girls were called Lyceum, while the term Gymnasium was first used only for boys' schools.  History  The term H√∂here M√§dchenschule was used for schools which promoted education of the mind (\\"geistige Bildung\\") beyond Volksschule (elementary school). They were sometimes reserved for (literally: \\"higher daughters\\"), girls from the wealthy bourgeoisie. The Mariengymnasium in Papenburg, for example, was founded around 1835 for the female youth from upper estates (\\"die weibliche Jugend h√∂herer St√§nde\\"). The first schools providing higher education for girls were founded at the beginning of the 18th century. The Gymnaecum, founded in 1709 by August Hermann Francke, is regarded as the first such institution.Helga Brandes: Frau, in: Werner Schneiders (ed.): Lexikon der Aufkl√§rung. Deutschland und Europa.

One of its teachers, , founded in 1806 a private institution for girls in L√ºbeck, which existed until 1871.Claus- Hinrich Offen; Schule in einer hanseatischen B√ºrgergesellschaft: zur Sozialgeschichte des niederen Schulwesens in L√ºbeck (1800‚Äì1866), 1990 In 1808, \\"Madame Wippermann\\", the wife of a merchant and manufacturer in Quedlinburg, founded the first private H√∂here T√∂chterschule for 40 students, which expanded to the St√§dtische H√∂here T√∂chterschule in 1863 and to today's . Education at these schools aimed primarily to prepare the girls to become wives and mothers. For more scientific education, wealthy families sent their girls to a finishing school (M√§dchenpensionat). Many girls from poor families left school as soon as compulsory education was served, to fulfil other duties. At the end of the 19th century, Prussia had 213 public h√∂here M√§dchenschulen and 656 private ones.Schaser, Angelika: Frauenbewegung in Deutschland 1848‚Äì1933. Darmstadt 2006, p. 25.

Since 2015, the RPR Coalition has positioned itself as an association of NGOs, not individual experts. The Coordinating Council approved the Charter of the RPR ‚Äì a charter that defines the functions of the Assembly, the RPR Council and the Secretariat and the general rules governing the platform's activities and internal relations and governance between coalition members. Besides, the Coordination Council found that its members are not just representatives from the groups, but their main experts.

Since then, there have been updated rules: how to choose a lead expert and group manager, how a particular expert can join the working group. Since then, the composition of the working groups is formed exclusively by public organizations, which are the organizational basis of each working group.

A network of 18 coalitions has been created: it includes 169 NGOs, more than 500 civic activists and experts. Local coalitions have created 16 reform roadmaps, and are now developing a single local reform roadmap harmonized with the roadmap at the national level, actively advocated by RPR. Also, 17 national organizations and local coalitions have joined forces in various projects. In cooperation with local coalitions there was held a number of public seminars on communication of reforms in cities. More than 50 changes (regulations, laws, etc.) have been advocated by local coalitions in their cities. However, in order to understand the results of the activities, it is necessary to delve into the context of each coalition. For example, in Chuhuiv there is a great example of how the coalition has established communication with most sections of the local population through print newspapers and social networks.The Bohuslav coalition also has a successful example of publishing its own newspaper and cooperating with the city authorities and the public. = Financing = Support is provided under the project - \\"RPR and Local Coalitions: A Synergy of Cooperation\\", implemented by the Civil Society Institute in conjunction with the RPR Coalition. The project is part of the Community Engagement Program \\"Engage\\" funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by Pact in Ukraine.

Taxonomy The description of the species was published in 2017, the collaborating authors Anna Gillespie, Mike Archer and Suzanne Hand working on the PANGEA research project based at the University of New South Wales. The holotype is a largely complete skull retaining some teeth and alveoli, with other materials such as the lower jaw and a humerus associated with the new species as paratypes. The discovery of more complete evidence of Oligocene species of the marsupial lion lineages prompted the authors to emend the circumscription of Wakaleo to include the type species of another genus, Priscileo pitikantensis, as a sister species to this taxon and contradicting a 2016 study that supported separation of P. pitikantensis from the wakaleo clade. Another early thylacoleonoid species, \\"Priscileo\\" roskellyae, was determined to have diverged from this genus during early period of the fossil record, and scant evidence of the species did not allow revising authors to assign a taxonomic placement with any confidence. A painter celebrated for his reconstructions of ancient animals, Peter Schouten, was honored by the authors in their proposed epithet for the species. The species was itself depicted by Schouten, in a conception of the animal contesting a thylacine for its kill, a kangaroo, in the early Miocene rainforest of Riversleigh. Description A species assigned to Wakaleo and resembling a contemporary animal of the Oligocene, Wakaleo pitikantensis. They were mid-sized predators who probably hunted in trees or ambushed prey from a branch. Calculations of the size following a method of statistical analysis for predicting body size, derived from 164 millimetres for the greatest length of the skull, indicate a weight of 22.6 or 24.0 kilograms. Another estimate using regression equations previously used in calculations of body size for Thylacoleo carnifex, a very large carnivore, resulted in a value around 5 kg that the describing authors considered too small. The dentition suggests that W. schouteni may have been omnivorous, but reveals the transition to hyper- carnivory of the genus during the Miocene. The distribution of the species included the Riversleigh World Heritage Area in the northwest of Queensland, at sediments dated to the later Oligocene to early Miocene. The assumption of at least partially arboreal habits is by the forest types that existed during the Oligo-Miocene at Riversleigh, open woodlands with the later development of rainforest. The humerus morphology is proposed to support this conception as a scansorial and arboreal predator, being similar to the structures of the arm and shoulder in species such as Phascolarctos cinereus, the related koala, and spotted cuscus Spilocuscus maculatus.

In 2018, he purchased the rights to Fangoria and relaunched the defunct magazine as a print-only publication; he additionally expanded the Fangoria brand to encompass a publishing and film production company. Beginning his career as an agent, Sonnier later gravitated towards production, initially founding the California-based Caliber Media with partner Jack Heller. Wanting to bring major film productions to the state of Texas, he returned there in 2016 to found the Dallas-based production company Cinestate. Early life and education Dallas Sonnier was born Joseph Albert Sonnier IV in the Highland Park neighborhood of Dallas, Texas, US. His parents, Becky and Dr. Joseph Sonnier moved from Shreveport, Louisiana to Dallas, Texas, shortly before he was born in 1980. Sonnier's nickname originated with his parents referring to him as ‚Äúthe Dallas baby‚Äù and the moniker stuck with him throughout his life. Sonnier developed an ambition to begin making movies while still in high school; to this end, he began taking continuing education classes in screenwriting at Southern Methodist University during the Summer before his senior year at Highland Park High School. He attended film classes at the University of Southern California while still in high school, and later as an undergrad, becoming one of five students to inaugurate the school's joint business-film program, introducing him to studio executives, entertainment attorneys, agents, and talent managers. During this period, he learned about aspects of the film making process beyond writing and directing. Career After graduating from USC, Sonnier obtained a job with United Talent Agency, beginning in the mailroom and working his way up to Agent Trainee. After a few years, he left the agency to join a start-up management firm run by David Schiff. In 2008, Sonnier and Jack Heller, a USC classmate, founded Caliber Media. While attending San Diego Comic Con, the pair met former wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin, eventually collaborating with him on nine low-budget action movies that were sold to distributors and premiered on DVD and video-on- demand. Caliber segued into other independent projects before raising funds for two years in order to shoot Bone Tomahawk; the script had been written by one of the pair's clients, S. Craig Zahler, whom they had been managing for two years. Zahler's script attracted Kurt Russell and Richard Jenkins, but the interested financiers wanted the script shortened. After several years of negotiations, Russell's agents were ready to move on if the movie was not fully financed in a matter of months. To secure financing for the film, in 2014, Sonnier took a new mortgage on his house. The film was a success. Following production on Bone Tomahawk, Sonnier departed Caliber to found Cinestate, a production company based in Dallas, with the intention of bringing film production to Texas. Sonnier would go on to collaborate with Zahler for two more films, Brawl in Cell Block 99 and Dragged Across Concrete. Production philosophy Sonnier's has stated that his approach to production is giving total creative freedom to writers and directors while also keeping budgets low enough that their projects can still be profitable. In interviews, he has been adamant about not making films that ‚Äúpander‚Äù to any audience, as well as not filtering directors‚Äô creativity. His business model relies on making films as widely available as possible‚Äîthrough purchase, rental, or streaming‚Äîon multiple platforms to ‚Äúpiece together‚Äù revenue from every possible source. Sonnier is also an advocate for filmmaking outside of New York and Los Angeles and not relying on the model of traditional studio systems. Cinestate Sonnier founded Cinestate upon his move back to Dallas from California. According to Sonnier, the unique selling point of the company is that the company produces films that are creatively unfiltered by producers or executives, and which represent the artistic vision of their creators. While revenue from Cinestate productions are a fraction of major studio releases, the company remains profitable by keeping production costs low and relying on word-of-mouth. In 2018, Sonnier completed the deal to acquire all the assets and trademarks of the Fangoria brand, including the horror movie magazine, and relaunched it as a division of Cinestate. Fangoria Magazine became print only and Sonnier hired a brand-new editor-in-chief, Phil Nobile Jr. of Birth.Movies.Death. As part of the arrangement, Cinestate controls all material from over 300 issues of Fangoria Magazine, which means all articles, photos, and exclusive interviews, spanning the past 40 years. Sonnier and his team are further developing Fangoria into a brand for producing movies and podcasts, as well as publishing horror novels. Cinestate has also extended its brand into other content, publishing six genre novels (three under the Cinestate imprint and three under a Fangoria imprint), as well as audiobook adaptations of screenplays.

Technically speaking, relativistic quantum cryptography is a sub-field of relativistic cryptography, in which cryptographic protocols exploit the no-superluminal signalling principle, independently of whether quantum properties are used or not. However, in practice, the term relativistic quantum cryptography is used for relativistic cryptography too. History In 1997 and 1998, some important tasks in mistrustful cryptography were shown to be impossible to achieve with unconditional security. Mayers and Lo and Chau showed that unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment was impossible. Lo showed that oblivious transfer and a broad class of secure computations were also impossible to achieve with unconditional security in quantum cryptography. Moreover, Lo and Chau showed that unconditionally secure ideal quantum coin tossing was impossible too. In this context, Kent provided in 1999 the first relativistic cryptographic protocols, for bit commitment and ideal coin tossing, which overcome the assumptions made by Mayers, Lo and Chau, and achieve unconditional security. Since then, other unconditionally secure relativistic protocols for bit commitment have been found by Kent and others, and other cryptographic tasks have been investigated in the setting of relativistic quantum cryptography. Basics =No-signalling and no- superluminal signalling= The no-signalling principle of quantum theory states that information cannot be communicated between two distinct locations L0 and L1 without the transmission of any physical systems, despite any quantum entanglement shared between L0 and L1. This implies, in particular, that without the transmission of any physical systems between L0 and L1, quantum correlation between L0 and L1 cannot be used to transmit information between L0 and L1, even if they are non-locally causal and violate Bell inequalities. According to relativity theory, physical systems cannot travel faster than the speed of light. Thus, it follows from the no-signalling principle that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light. This is called the no-superluminal signalling principle. The principle of no- superluminal signalling is the key physical principle exploited in relativistic cryptography. It guarantees that the outcome x of a random variable X obtained at some spacetime point P cannot influence the probability that a random variable Y takes some value y at a spacelike separated spacetime point Q. Thus, for example, if two parties Alice and Bob have each two agents, with the first agent of Bob sending a secret message x to a first agent of Alice at the spacetime point P, and with the second agent of Alice sending a secret message y to the second agent of Bob at the spacetime point Q, with P and Q spacelike separated, then Bob can be guaranteed that the message y received from Alice was chosen independently of the message x that he gave Alice, and vice versa. This is a useful mathematical property that is exploited to prove the security of cryptographic protocols in relativistic cryptography. =The setting= It is a fundamental requirement in relativistic cryptography that the parties implementing the cryptographic task have a good description of spacetime, at least within the region of spacetime where the task is implemented. For example, in protocols implemented near the Earth surface, it can be assumed that spacetime is close to Minkowski. Importantly, this means that, near the Earth surface, physical systems and information cannot travel faster than the speed of light through vacuum, which is approximately 300,000 km/s. In principle, relativistic cryptography can be applied with more general spacetimes, as long as the parties can guarantee that there are no mechanisms allowing instant communication, like wormholes. Another requirement is that the parties have access to a common reference frame, so that they can guarantee that some communication events are spacelike separated. In relativistic cryptography, it is assumed that each party participating in the cryptographic task has various trusted agents that collaborate to implement the task. The agents implement the protocol by performing different actions at various points in spacetime. The agents of the same party may communicate via authenticated and secure channels, which can be implemented with previously shared secure keys, for example using one-time pads. Various tasks investigated by relativistic cryptography consist in tasks of mistrustful cryptography, in which two or more mistrustful parties must collaborate to implement a cryptographic task while at the same time being guaranteed that other parties do not cheat. Examples of tasks in mistrustful cryptography are bit commitment, coin tossing, oblivious transfer and secure computations. Key distribution does not belong to mistrustful cryptography, because in this case the parties distributing the key trust each other. In relativistic cryptography, each participating party has various trusted agents, who collaborate with each other by performing different actions at various spacetime points. For example, Alice and Bob can be two companies with offices and laboratories at various locations in the Earth. Alice‚Äôs offices and laboratories work in collaboration and trust each other. Similarly, Bob‚Äôs offices and laboratories work in collaboration and trust each other. But Alice and Bob do not trust each other. Tasks investigated in relativistic cryptography =Bit commitment= Bit commitment is an important cryptographic task that has been widely investigated in relativistic cryptography. In bit commitment, Alice commits to a bit b at some time t, and at some later time t‚Äô > t Alice unveils her committed bit b to Bob. A bit commitment is said to be \\"hiding\\" if Bob cannot know b before Alice unveils. It is said to be \\"binding\\" if after the commitment time t, Alice cannot choose the value of b and successfully unveil b to Bob. A bit commitment protocol is \\"secure\\" if it is hiding and binding. The Mayers-Lo-Chau no go theorem states that unconditionally secure bit commitment is impossible based only on the laws of quantum physics. It was shown by Kent that the Mayers-Lo-Chau theorem is not general enough because it excludes protocols that exploit the principle of no-superluminal signalling. Kent provided the first unconditionally secure bit commitment protocol in the setting of relativistic cryptography. Various protocols for bit commitment have been devised by Kent and others. Experimental demonstrations of relativistic bit commitment have been implemented. =Coin tossing= In strong coin tossing, Alice and Bob are at different locations and they wish to toss a coin in such a way that Alice is guaranteed that Bob cannot bias the outcome, and Bob is guaranteed that Alice cannot bias the outcome either. It was shown by Lo and Chau that ideal strong coin tossing is impossible to achieve with unconditional security based only on the laws of quantum physics. However, Kent overcame this no-go theorem by providing a relativistic protocol for strong coin tossing that is unconditionally secure. This protocol is conceptually very simple and is illustrated here as an example of a protocol in relativistic cryptography. In Kent‚Äôs coin tossing protocol, Alice has two agents A0 and A1, and Bob has two agents B0 and B1. Ai and Bi are at location Li, for i\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}. Let L0 and L1 have a distant separation D. Let us assume that spacetime is Minkowski. Thus, the minimum time that light takes to travel between L0 and L1 is t = D/c, where c is the speed of light through vacuum. A0 generates a random bit a in a secure laboratory and gives it to B0 at a time t0. B1 generates a random bit b in a secure laboratory and gives it to A1 at a time t1. B0 and B1 communicate a and b through a secure and authenticated channel. Similarly, A0 and A1 communicate a and b through a secure and authenticated channel. Alice and Bob agree that the output of the toss d is the xor of the bits a and b, d =a \\\\oplus b . Alice and Bob agree on advance on the values of t0 and t1 in a common reference frame, in such a way that t0 \\\\- t1 < t. Thus, from the principle of no superluminal signalling, at receiving a from A0, B0 cannot send any signal that arrives to B1 before B1 gives b to A1. Therefore, Alice is guaranteed that the bit b is chosen by Bob independently of the bit a chosen by her. Since Alice chooses a randomly, and since b is independent of a, Alice is guaranteed that the bit d = a\\\\oplus b is random. With similar arguments, Bob is also guaranteed that the bit d is random. Variations of coin tossing have been investigated in relativistic cryptography by Colbeck and Kent. =Oblivious transfer and secure computations= Lo showed that oblivious transfer and other secure computations cannot be achieved with unconditional security based only on the laws of quantum physics. This impossibility result by Lo extends to the more general setting of relativistic quantum cryptography. Colbeck showed that various secure computations are impossible to achieve with unconditional security in relativistic quantum cryptography. =Position-based quantum cryptography= Position-based quantum cryptography consists in cryptographic tasks whose security exploit the location of a party, the principle of no-superluminal signalling and the laws of quantum physics. For example, in the problem of quantum location authentication, a prover wants to demonstrate his location L to a set of verifiers using quantum systems. A protocol for quantum location authentication works as follows. A set of verifiers at various locations that surround the location L send classical messages and quantum states towards the location L. If the prover is at the location L then he can receive the signals at specific times and reply to the verifiers with requested classical messages and/or quantum states, which must be received by the verifiers at specific times. Quantum location authentication was first investigated by Kent in 2002, which he called ‚Äòquantum tagging‚Äô, resulting in a filed US patent by Kent et. al. in 2007, and a publication in the academic literature in 2010, after a paper on position-based quantum cryptography was published by Buhrman et. al. There is a no-go theorem for quantum location authentication proved by Buhrman et. al. stating that it is impossible for a set of verifiers to authenticate the location of a prover with unconditional security. This is because for any quantum location authentication protocol, a set of dishonest provers sharing a sufficient amount of entanglement and positioned between the verifiers and the location L can intercept all communications from the verifiers, including all transmitted quantum states, and then apply a non-local quantum operation which allows them to reply correctly and at the correct times to the verifiers. Since the dishonest provers do not need to be at the location L to do this, the quantum location authentication protocol is insecure. This no-go theorem assumes that the location L of the honest prover is his only credential. Kent showed that if the prover shares secret keys with the verifiers then location authentication can be implemented securely.

He became the first African-American chaplain to die while in active U.S. military service. Asher was born on October 13, 1812 in North Branford, New Haven County, Connecticut to free parents, Reuel and Jerusha Asher. Reuel's father was an African named Gad who, at the age of four, had been captured on the coast of Guinea and shipped to captivity in Connecticut. Purchased by a ship carpenter named Titus Bishop in Connecticut, Gad was treated relatively well as a slave. After some forty years of bondage he was offered his freedom if he would fight in the American Revolution. Gad seized the opportunity, fighting in numerous battles. Yet Bishop broke his promise to Gad, forcing the slave to purchase his freedom, which he did. In addition, the U.S. government paid Gad a pension of $96 annually for the remainder of his life for fighting in the army.Incidents in the life of the Rev. J.

Hopes and Expectations: The Origins of the Black Middle Class in Hartford (SUNY Press, 2016). Jeremiah Asher, a third-generation free man, married Abigail Stewart on May 13, 1830 in Hartford, Connecticut. In March of 1839, he was licensed to preach at the First Baptist Church of Hartford. The now Reverend Asher began preaching at the Meeting Street Baptist Church, in Providence, Rhode Island, where he stayed for nine years at a salary of $300 per year. It was there that he rose to national prominence. In the early spring of 1848, he resigned from the Meeting Street Baptist Church. His first stop, after leaving Providence, was in Washington, DC, where he became the first ordained pastor of the Second (Colored) Baptist Church in early 1849. He only stayed there for three months or so, however. After leaving Washington, DC, he went to Philadelphia, where he pastored at the Shiloh Baptist Church. In 1863, Rev. Asher co-founded the Shiloh Baptist Church in Yorktown, Virginia with John Carey, a former slave. He named this church after his former church in Philadelphia. In that same year, Rev. Asher wrote to President Abraham Lincoln, requesting that Black ministers be allowed to serve as chaplains in the Union Army during the Civil War. President Lincoln agreed, and, at age 50 and with the support of all the white officers in the regiment, Rev. Asher became Chaplain of the 6th Regiment U.S. Colored Troops. He was one of only fourteen Black ministers in the entire Union Army to be assigned as Chaplain.http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMQN5R_FIRST_African_American_Chaplain_to_die_in_Military_Service_Yorktown_VAWilson, K.

Authentism (), incorporated as the Tezaurus Non-Confessional Spiritual Union (–í–Ω–µ–∫–æ–Ω—Ñ–µ—Å—Å–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –î—É—Ö–æ–≤–Ω—ã–π –°–æ—é–∑ \\"–¢–µ–∑–∞—É—Ä—É—Å\\"), is a Rodnover new spiritual philosophy and psychological order originally founded in 1984 by Sergey Petrovich Semenov (b. 1952) in Saint Petersburg. Members of the order are called Tezaurians, and they prefer not to qualify Authentism as a \\"religion\\", but rather as a \\"worldview\\". The term \\"Authentism\\" derives from the Latin word authenticus, meaning \\"authentic, self-made, self-consistent\\". According to the doctrine, authenticity is acquired when one discovers his true divine nature, God-given and immortal. Beliefs The Authentist movement is based on the teachings of the Russian Veda (–†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–π –í–µ–¥—ã), considered an expression of Slavic paganism, Russian cosmism and psychoanalysis. The aim of the philosophical practice is to reveal one's own true spiritual essence, which is identical with God, Rod ‚Äî which is viewed as the complementary unity of Belobog/Sventovid and Chernobog/Veles ‚Äî and therefore the unity of mankind and God, which characterises Russia's special mission opposed to Western individualism. History Sergey Petrovich Semenov was born in Saint Petersburg in 1952, and graduated in 1976 at the First Pavlov State Medical University of St. Petersburg, then First Medical Institute of Leningrad. In 1984, Semenov founded the \\"Studio of Psychic Culture\\", which one year later was transformed into the Mir club. The club was engaged in the dissemination of the Authentist ideas and published samizdat literature. In 1987 the club was closed by authorities, according to Semenov for its engagement in politics, and continued in informal ways. The original club had members focused on both ethnic Russian and Jewish cultures, organised respectively in the \\"Rus'\\" and \\"Sinai\\" subgroups. In 1989 the two groups diverged, and Semenov made a choice in favour of the \\"Rus'\\", which eventually developed into \\"Tezaurus\\". While Tezaurus is not registered as a religious organisation by the Russian government, in the 1990s it established educational, medical and political structures, all of which are recognised by the government.

Numlahti Manor (, ) is a manor house and mansion located in Nurmij√§rvi, close to the villages of Valkj√§rvi and Numlahti. The Numlahti Manor is the oldest manor of Nurmij√§rvi.  History  The manor dates back to 1594, when the rittmeister Klaus H√§stesko acquired five houses in the village of Paijala (now Numlahti) and soon acquired the remaining four of the village houses. The former owners of the houses became ranch growers of the manor. The manor was managed by H√§stesko's wife Bengta Creutz and her daughter Anna Skoo inherited the manor after her father died. At the end of the 17th century the manor was owned by Elisabet Crusebj√∂rn (1638‚Äì1709). He had leased it to Esaias Austrell, who was ruthlessly and roughly treating the manor workers. Then on March 2, 1697, the tenant farmer Juho Markunpoika, and his nephew, Juho Abrahaminpoika, killed Austell and his wife Kristina Dahl with an ax. After the murders, the victims were buried under the floor of the manor's vestibule and traces of the act were cleaned. Tenants broke into the manor rooms and collected from the chests a large loot, which included 200 thalers of money, silver goblets and spoons, rings, and a variety of clothing and food. The murderers first fled from Nurmij√§rvi to Vyborg and thence to Tallinn, where they were arrested in April. Both were sentenced to death and loss of property in June 1697. From 1922 to 1930, the manor was owned by Hjalmar V. Pohjanheimo, a film producer and businessman. In the every summer, his old silent films by Lyyra Film were shown to a crowd of servants and villagers in the manor carriage. However, the film reels were eventually destroyed in the matches of Pohjanheimo's grandchildren. Carl Jonas Borup became the owner of the manor in 1934, and ever since to the present day, the manor has been owned by the Borup family.  Buildings  The manor's two-floor main building partly dating back to 1876. The courtyard also features a probably 18th-century long mansard-roofed wing. The outbuildings made of brick from the manor date back to the early 20th century. The manor had a mill and a sawmill on the shore of nearby Kuhakoski. Later, the manor also had its own small power plant, a brick factory and a dairy.

Starring Yoo Ah-in and Park Shin-hye, it is based on the 2019 script Alone by Matt Naylor, who co-adapted his script with Cho. The film revolves around a video game live streamer's struggle for survival as he is forced to stay alone at his apartment in Seoul during a zombie apocalypse. It was released in South Korea on June 24, 2020, and globally via Netflix on September 8, 2020. Plot Joon-woo, who lives with his parents and sister in an apartment complex, spends his days video game live streaming. While his family is out, the news reports that a mysterious rapidly-spreading disease is causing its victims to attack and eat uninfected people, and the government has lost control. From his balcony, Joon-woo sees his neighbours fleeing or attacking one another. He goes to check the hallway, but a neighbour barges in and succumbs to infection. Joon-woo barely manages to push him out and lock the door. He then receives messages from his parents telling him that they are safe. Joon-woo barricades himself inside and posts a rescue request on social media. No help comes. Within days, the neighbourhood is overrun with infected. Though the emergency power stays on, Joon-woo gradually loses access to running water, internet service, and phone networks. He watches a policewoman attempt to escape the complex, but she is overwhelmed and infected. An infected man breaks into his apartment, but Jun-Woo manages to bait it into falling off his balcony. When his food and water runs low, he begins drinking from his father's liquor cabinet. As he hallucinates about his family, his phone network is restored momentarily, and he receives a voicemail from his family recording their last moments. Driven by grief, he prepares to hang himself, but stops when he is flashed by a laser pointer's beam from Yoo-bin, another survivor living in the apartment opposite of his balcony. They begin signalling to each other daily. Seeing that Joon-woo is hungry, Yoo-bin connects their apartments with a homemade zip line and sends him food. An infected man manipulates the zip line, causing Yoo-bin's table to fly and knock her out. The infected man climbs up the string to her apartment, but Joon-woo distracts it with his flying drone long enough for Yoo-bin to wake up and kill it. Joon-woo decides to search for supplies, finding food, clothing, and walkie-talkies in his neighbour's unit. He sends a walkie-talkie to Yoo- bin, and the two begin to bond. The infected hordes become agitated, and Yoo- bin knocks over some furniture while trying to hide. The sound causes a group to converge on her apartment, and Joon-woo distracts them by calling an adjacent unit's landline. Realizing that they will die if they stay put, the pair rappel from their balconies, recover the policewoman's revolver, and fight their way to the 8th floor of Joon-woo's apartment together, determining that the floor is safe. The horde finds them, but a stranger emerges from his apartment and saves the pair. In the stranger's home, the pair accepts his food, which has been drugged. The stranger cuffs the inebriated pair, then tries to feed Yoo-bin to his infected wife. Yoo-bin is able to wrap a bag over the infected wife's head, then releases the zombie upon her husband. She shoots them both with the revolver, but the gunshots attract the infected. Yoo-bin asks Joon-woo to mercy-kill her; however, Joon-woo hears helicopters outside. The pair fight their way to the rooftop, chased by the infected. Just as they are about to be overwhelmed, an army helicopter shoots the horde down and the pair are flown off to safety. A voiceover by an anchorman explains that wireless networks are being restored and the military has begun rescuing survivors who made social media posts.

[...] By taking a concept unfamiliar to the sub-genre, #Alive transforms how zombie movies can be handled as well as providing an exploration of the different circumstances individuals find themselves when dealing with the apocalypse.\\" Anthony Kao from Cinema Escapist suggested, \\"#Alive is an entertaining zombie flick that seems tailor-made for the time of coronavirus. [...] On top of its empathetic and socially relevant depiction of the Korean millennial condition, #Alive presents a narrative that feels unpretentious and accessibly entertaining.\\" The New York Times' Elisabeth Vincentelli concluded, \\"#Alive is a nifty little thriller that proves that you can always find signs of life in the most undead of genres. And the finale, far-fetched as it is, suggests that even a society atomized by isolation can find a connection\\".

The epicentre is unknown, although it may have been in the Portsmouth/Chichester area on the south coast of England or in Glamorgan, Wales. The earthquake is known for causing the destruction of St Michael's Church on Glastonbury Tor in Somerset.  Earthquake  The annals of Waverley report that the earthquake occurred \\"between the first hour of the day and the third\\" on 11 September 1275. It was felt in London, Canterbury, Winchester and Wales, and may have been felt across the rest of England. One account described how it was felt \\"chiefly in the west\\". Neither foreshocks nor aftershocks are reported as having occurred. The earthquake caused the destruction of the 11th-century timber Church of St Michael atop Glastonbury Tor. It is likely that other buildings across the country were destroyed, and the annals of Osney reported that people were killed in the earthquake‚Äî\\"domus et ecclesiae in diversis locis Angliae subvertebantur et homines interficiebantur\\" (\\"homes and churches in different areas of England [were] overthrow[n]; the people being killed\\"). The annals of Winchester state that the tremors were felt across the sea, which may imply it was felt in France, although the lack of corroboration from French sources may suggest this is a confusion with a different event. One account described how \\"a great earthquake happened in many kingdoms, and chiefly in England, and floods of water also about maritime towns\\". Similarly, Walter de Hemingburgh observed that \\"there was a general earthquake in London and in the kingdom of England, both in camps and towns, habitations and fields\\". It is possible that the coastal effects of the earthquake are better attributed to unrelated inclement weather, as the word \\"earthquake\\" may have archaically referred to thunder. The British Geological Survey hypothesises that the extent and spread of damage suggests an intensity of at least 7 on the Medvedev‚ÄìSponheuer‚ÄìKarnik scale (\\"very strong\\"), or 8 on the European macroseismic scale (\\"heavily damaging\\"). = Epicentre = The epicentre of the earthquake is unknown. Despite contemporary reports that assume the damage at Glastonbury Tor prove a Somerset epicentre, it is unlikely that the epicentre was in the county, and the destruction of the church is more likely attributed to the church's exposed position atop a steep and narrow hill. A possible location is in the area of Portsmouth and Chichester. This area is notable for frequency of earthquakes due to the presence of a deep north-south strike-slip fault. This hypothesis is strengthened by the report of Thomas Wykes, who wrote that the shock was more intense on the south coast. A possible alternative epicentre is in South Wales. Edward Gamage, the rector in St Athan, Glamorgan, described an earthquake causing immense damage to Glamorgan and Somerset. Gamage, an antiquarian in the 18th century, wrote a history of the Strandling family of Bristol where he described the earthquake as occurring in the time of Sir John Strandling, which is probably the same as the 1275 event. This suggests an epicentre closer to Swansea and implies an intensity of 6 Mw. Some sources cite the earthquake as being a Cornish or French event, mistaking a reference to the destruction at \\"St Michael on the Mount\\" (the church on Glastonbury Tor) for occurring at St Michael's Mount or Mont-Saint-Michel. The annals of Waverley refer to an earthquake affecting the whole country and destroying the church called \\"St Michael of [the] Mount\\", although no specific mention of the location of the church is made.

Early life  Pilar-Morin recalled a childhood in Barcelona, a Catholic education, a brief early marriage to a French count, and training as an actress and singer at the Paris Conservatoire. Pilar Morin, from a 1910 publication.  Career  Pilar- Morin was a stage performer who specialized in \\"silent drama\\" in the mime tradition, in shows including L'Enfant Prodigue, In Old Japan, A Paris Model, Rachel, and Orange Blossoms. She appeared in David Belasco's Madame Butterfly in London, and on vaudeville in the United States. Her expressive face and gestural vocabulary were considered well-suited to the medium of silent film. \\"We do not think there is any other woman in the world more suited by training, talent and temperament to the opportunity of uplifting the moving picture by her art.\\" Edison Company films featuring Pilar-Morin as an actress include Comedy and Tragedy (1909), A Japanese Peach Boy (1910), The Cigarette Maker of Seville (1910, a short, silent version of Carmen), Carminella (1910), The Piece of Lace (1910), From Tyranny to Liberty (1910), The Key of Life (1910), and The Greater Love (1910). After her film career, Pilar-Morin returned to giving live performances, and had an acting studio in New York. She invented a method, the \\"Key Note Waved Winged Clavier\\", for training singers and speakers in breath control. She wrote and presented a short drama about the French Revolution, La Cordette (1913). She also wrote and lectured on drama, breath control, and physical expression, for example in 1919 to the Society of Physical Education in New York. She trained American opera singer Josephine Lucchese in her physical methods.  Charges of impropriety  In 1896, Elizabeth Bartlett Grannis of the National Christian League for the Promotion of Purity charged a theatre manager, J. B. Doris, with \\"presenting an improper pantomime\\", specifically Pilar-Morin's Orange Blossoms. Grannis explained that Pilar-Morin's \\"grimaces\\" and gestures in a disrobing scene were \\"suggestive\\" and \\"demoralizing.\\" Pilar-Morin appeared before a New York magistrate to defend her show. The case went before the New York State Supreme Court in 1897. Her 1899 show, My Cousin (Ma Cousine) was also condemned as lewd and obscene. \\"You Americans prate about purity in dramatics,\\" she told an interviewer, \\"and there ends your opinions on the subject. You do not support pure plays, and naturally drive managers to seek what you really want.\\"  Personal life  Pilar-Morin seldom gave details of her personal life in interviews or lectures. She was married to French pianist and composer Aim√© Lachaume (1871-1944) in 1891; he performed with her in Boston in 1893. She testified that she was married and had a son in an 1896 hearing about 'Orange Blossoms'. She and Lachaume divorced in 1908. She was described as being married to \\"Prince de Matta of Egypt\\" in 1925, when her terrier, Lalith, wakened the couple and their neighbors to alert them to a fire in their New York apartment building.

Daniel Apai, lead astronomer of NDSO from the University of Arizona, and associated with the Steward Observatory and the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, commented \\"[With this new space telescope technology], we will be able to vastly increase the light-collecting power of telescopes, and among other science, study the atmospheres of 1,000 potentially Earth-like planets for signs of life.\\"  Overview  The NDSO mission is based on the development of very lightweight telescope mirrors that enhance the power of space telescopes, while substantially lowering manufacturing and launch costs. The concept is based not on traditional reflective optics but on diffractive optics, employing a single diffractive lens made of a multiorder diffractive engineered (MODE) material. A MODE lens is ten times lighter and 100 times less susceptible to misalignments than conventional lightweight large telescope mirrors. The NDSO mission proposes to launch a fleet of 35 space telescopes, each one a wide spherical telescope, and each featuring an diameter lens. Each of these space telescopes would be more powerful than the mirror of the James Webb Space Telescope, the wide mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope, and the mirror of the Ariel space telescope combined. The NDSO telescope array of 35 spacecraft, when used all together, would have the resolving power equivalent to a diameter telescope. With such telescopic power, the NDSO would be able to analyze the atmospheres of 1,000 exoplanets up to 1,000 light years away. In January 2019, the NDSO research team, which includes lead astronomer Daniel Apai, as well as Tom Milster, Dae Wook Kim and Ronguang Liang from the University of Arizona College of Optical Sciences, and Jonathan Arenberg from Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, received a $1.1 million support grant from the Moore Foundation in order to construct a prototype of a single telescope, and test it on the Kuiper Telescope before December 2020. Spacecraft Each individual Nautilus unit has a single solid MODE lens and would be packed in stackable form for a shared rocket launch, and once deployed, each unit would inflate into a diameter Mylar balloon with the instrument payload in the center.A Different Kind of Eye on the Cosmos.

Spanning two 50-meter high towers in the Palace of Mafra, it features 120 cast bronze bells, divided into carillon (103 bells), liturgical and clock bells. Along with the entire Mafra Royal Building (Portuguese: Edif√≠cio Real de Mafra) the carillons were inscribed on UNESCO‚Äôs World Heritage List in 2019. Description Both carillons are simultaneously composed of two systems: * A mechanical system, which functions as a Barbieri organ, with two colossal bronze cylinders, where the pegging of musical notes is located. When driven by the clock mechanism, the movement of the cylinders causes pins to strike metal keys or parrots, moving the bell hammers according to a melody programme. * The mechanical carillon in turn plays every room, every half and right hour, from sunrise to sunset- a system manually operated by a carillonneur tapping the keyboard with the hands and feet, triggers the bell chimes. Legend has it that King John V of Portugal had two, not just one carillon ordered, because he simply could afford such lavish commissions. The tower carillons were made by Flemish bell-makers, Nicholas II Levache in Li√©ge and Willem Witlockx foundries in Antwerp. Each of the bell towers comprising fifty-eight bells, belonging to every forty-nine chimes. The first bells, each weigh 625 ‚Äòarrobas‚Äô [1 arroba = 14,688 kg] or over 9,180 kg. Those of second magnitude, each weigh 291 ‚Äôarrobas‚Äô ie 4,270 kg each; those of third 231 ‚Äôarrobas‚Äô corresponding to 3,392 kg each, those of fourth 99 ‚Äôarrobas‚Äô i.e. 1,454 kg each. The magnitude thus decreasing to 1 bell at the smallest, weighing about 15 kg each. Finally the chime wheels and mills weigh 1,420 ‚Äòquintals‚Äô [1 quintal = 58,752 kg] or 83,427.84 kg. The carillons underwent extensive works between 2015 and 2019, to restore and preserve their optimal performance and splendour.  The National Palace of Mafra Located 40 km northwest of Lisbon, The Mafra Royal Building and adjacent property, was conceived by King John V (D. Jo√£o V) in 1711 as a tangible representation of his idea of monarchy and State. This imposing quadrangular building houses the king and queen's palaces, a royal chapel shaped like a Roman baroque basilica, a Franciscan monastery and an impressive library containing 36,000 volumes. The complex is completed by the Cerco garden, with its geometric layout and the royal hunting park and grounds (Portuguese: Tapada de Mafra). The Royal Monastic Library of the National Palace of Mafra is one of the most important European libraries, with a valuable collection of 18th-century illustrations. It also holds rare works such as the collection of incunabula (works printed before 1501), the famous ‚ÄúNuremberg Chronicle‚Äù (1493), notable Bibles, the French Encyclop√©die (edited by Diderot and d'Alembert), illuminated books of hours of the 15th century and an important nucleus of musical scores by Portuguese and foreign composers, especially written for the six historical organs of the Basilica. This complex is one of the most magnificent masterpieces undertaken by King Jo√£o V and it illustrates the power and reach of the Portuguese Empire in that period. It is also one of the best examples of Baroque architecture in Europe. Present usage Currently, the carillons are played in concerts organized by the Palace of Mafra and the Municipality of Mafra. They are also played in the religious ceremonies, namely the processions of the season of Lent in Mafra.

The son of Jerry and Patti Homan, his father played basketball at Marquette University. As a senior at Brookfield Central High School, Lucas averaged 18.6 points, 5.3 rebounds and four assists per game. Homan served as the quarterback for the Lancers' 2002 state final football team. He walked on to the basketball team at Milwaukee, but transferred to UW-La Crosse after Bruce Pearl left to coach at Tennessee. As a junior, he played in all 28 games and helped the team win 20 games.  Death  In the fall of 2006, Homan disappeared from downtown La Crosse after celebrating Oktoberfest with a group of friends. He was found dead three days later in the Mississippi River, in La Crosse, Wisconsin. The autopsy revealed acute alcohol intoxication as a major contributing factor to his death as well as cold water drowning. Drug tests were ran on Homan; all toxicology tests turned out to be negative.  Aftermath  Another UW La Crosse student was charged with obstruction in Homan's investigation. He is believed to be the last person to see Homan alive. He had told police Homan had gotten into an altercation with another bar patron and fled; he told a different story to Homan's friends and other UW students, saying he had been cut when he was punched by a man that was fighting with Homan and that three men were involved in the altercation. The young man appeared \\"upset and nervous\\" upon being questioned by the police during the search for Homan. He said three men had gotten into an altercation with Homan and then followed him out of the Vibe; these three men then returned without Homan and struck him with a beer bottle, cutting him. He immediately left the bar and headed home. Authorities stressed he was not involved in Homan's death, but Scott was charged with giving conflicting accounts to police.

Incumbent president Donald Trump has utilized his Twitter account in the past to reach his voters and make announcements, both during and after the 2016 election. The presumptive Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden has also been making use of social media networks to express his views and opinions on important events at the time such as the Trump administration's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the protests following the killing of George Floyd. Candidates have utilized platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to connect with their voter base, often making use of fact-checking, news articles and political advertising to discredit their opponents and gain support. Similar to the previous election, social media has helped shape the course of events, with candidates often hunting for 'viral moments'. These can include certain posts, remarks or videos. In contrast to the previous election, the Facebook‚ÄìCambridge Analytica data scandal that was exposed after Donald Trump's electoral victory in 2016 has led to tighter regulation on the harvesting of personal data for political advertising. Additionally, many platforms have enforced stricter rules on the content that can be posted, and also incorporated fact checking software into their applications. Controversially, the software has repeatedly flagged Republican candidate Donald Trump's posts, which has led him to accuse social media companies of bias against his campaign. On 12 August 2020, Google, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft announced partnership with Wikimedia Foundation. The representatives of the giants also met the representatives from FBI, the Office of the director of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security, in an effort to protect the integrity of the November presidential elections. They discussed about the disinformation campaign and deceptive behavior practiced over the said Internet and social media platforms.  Background  In the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump made extensive use of his Twitter account to broadcast his thoughts and opinions during his campaign. The Trump campaign also utilized targeted advertising on the social media site Facebook, by hiring political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to create these personalized ads for users. A subsequent whistle-blowing by an anonymous source, (later revealed to be former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie) revealed that personal data of the users had been illegally used, which led to a major data scandal and the liquidation of he company, as well as the eventually testification of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in front of the United States Congress. Joe Biden, the Democratic Party nominee for 2020, has not made much use of social media in the past, but has used portions of his campaign budget to run advertising on certain platforms, most notably Facebook, where he is estimated to have spent up to $1.6 million on advertising leading up to the California Democratic primary. Democratic primaries With over 23 candidates in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, attracting and generating social media attention became a central campaign strategy. In 2020 social media became a significant focus of campaign fundraising, due to the ongoing rise of social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. With the new centrality of social media to presidential campaigns, staff attention also had to be focused on managing negative viral moments. In the summer of 2019, the selection process of qualifying for the September 2019 2020 Democratic Party presidential debates and forums, which required candidates to have passes a 2% threshold in 4 national opinion polls, put enormous pressure on the less well- known candidates to generate a \\"viral moment\\". Reddit became an important social media platform in the primaries, with most major candidates having their own 'subreddits', or dedicated community noticeboards. Most of the subreddits were set up by volunteers and supporters, and rapidly grew in size. The largest of these was 'r/SandersForPresident', which accumulated nearly 500,000 followers before Sanders dropped out of the primaries. During the primaries, candidate Andrew Yang made extensive use of social media, which greatly increased his following. His self-proclaimed voter base the 'Yang Gang' became the subject of many internet memes, particularly on the online message board 4chan.  Donald Trump campaign  The Trump campaign made considerable use of social media in the 2016 presidential election. Donald Trump used the online platform Twitter to broadcast opinions and news on his campaign to his supporters, and his campaign staff created personalized advertisements for Facebook users. The personal data used to create these ads was obtained illegally, something which led to the Facebook‚ÄìCambridge Analytica data scandal. Trump's re-election campaign has been making use of use of multiple social media platforms as well as targeted ads since mid-2019 in an attempt to gain voters early. On 29 June 2020, Reddit deleted Trump's fans' subreddit, r/The_Donald, for violating its policies repeatedly over its lifetime.  Joe Biden campaign  Similar to his Republican party opponent, Donald Trump Joe Biden has made extensive use of Twitter to broadcast news of his campaign, as well as his opinions on various policies and his proposed changes. Biden used the platform to publicly announce California senator Kamala Harris as his running mate, and also to talk to her publicly.  Facebook  Facebook has been used by political campaigns to get people to sign up for candidate email lists or to give political donations. Additionally, Facebook has been used considerably more than other social media platforms for targeted advertising, as it is considered by many digital specialists as the best platform for direct response. The platform has a very wide demographic range, with significantly higher proportions of elderly people using the site as compared to its competitors. In December 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported that candidate Senator Bernie Sanders and President Trump were the most active on Facebook, followed by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren.  Twitter  Both Biden and Trump have taken to Twitter to express their opinions of issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the impeachment of Donald Trump and the George Floyd protests. Biden does not run his own Twitter account while Trump does. Trump has been criticized for his false and misleading statements, which have repeatedly been flagged by Twitter for violating its policies. A Pew survey of 3518 twitter users in 2020 shows that the most active 10% generate 92% of the tweets. This highly active group is 69% Democratic and 26% Republican. Furthermore the high-activity Democrats post twice as many posts per month as high-activity Republicans.\\"Differences in How Democrats and Republicans Behave on Twitter: A small minority of users create the vast majority of tweets from U.S. adults, and 69% of these highly prolific tweeters are Democrats\\" Pew Research Center (Oct 15, 2020) online See also *Foreign interference in the 2020 United States elections *Social media in the 2016 United States presidential election References Further reading *The Billion-Dollar Disinformation Campaign to Reelect the President; How new technologies and techniques pioneered by dictators will shape the 2020 election by McKay Coppins TheAtlantic.com March 2020 Issue Category:2020 United States presidential election Category:Donald Trump and social media Category:Political communication Category:Politics of the United States Category:Social media ","title":"Social media in the 2020 United States presidential election"},{"id":"61447797","text":"Oliwia Zalewska Czuprynska (born 20 January 1995) is a Polish professional pool player.

After the death of Bulumia, Sib√∂ wrapped her body in bijagua leaves and brought it to the ground. Upon arrival, Sib√∂ searched for an assistant to take care of Bulumia's corpse. He found K√°chabuk√© the poisonous frog and placed him on her belly. Sib√∂ told him to stand guard over the body of Bulumia for four days and not to move from there. Sib√∂ said that if anything happened to the body it would be K√°chabuk√©'s responsibility. The frog felt proud to be the one chosen to take care of the corpse, but he could not sleep well at night because the noise coming from the belly was similar to ocean waves, and his loneliness caused him to become frightened. The days passed and K√°chabuk√© had not eaten anything which caused him great hunger. Sib√∂ sent a bumblebee for the frog to catch and eat, but he could not catch it. The bumblebee collided with some trees and landed, and the frog rushed to catch it. As soon as he jumped, K√°chabuk√© heard a wind and ran back to the corpse, but he was too late; the belly was detached from the corpse and the fetus, a small tree called Dulu√≠tami, had emerged. Achiote fruits (Bixa orellana) The next day Sib√∂ came looking for the little frog and Dulu√≠tami was playing. Sib√∂ said \\"Why did not you do what I told you?\\" The frog explained that he was very hungry and tried to grab the bumblebee.

Critical reception  On AllMusic, Timothy Monger said, \\"Plucked from a Chicago run at the end of 1979, Dave's Picks, Vol. 31 features a jaunty trio of sets from the Grateful Dead, who were at the point still in the honeymoon phase with their newest recruit, keyboardist Brent Mydland.\\" In Glide Magazine, Doug Collette wrote, \\"In front of close to forty-five hundred attendees, the Grateful Dead were opening a three-night run... and proceeded to blend together tried-and-true material like \\"Brown-Eyed Women\\" and \\"Wharf Rat\\" with fairly new compositions such as \\"Alabama Getaway\\", \\"Althea\\" and \\"Fire On The Mountain\\".\\"  Track listing  Disc 1 :First set: #\\"Alabama Getaway\\" (Jerry Garcia, Robert Hunter) ‚Äì 7:05 #\\"Promised Land\\" (Chuck Berry) ‚Äì 4:35 #\\"Brown-Eyed Women\\" (Garcia, Hunter) ‚Äì 5:48 #\\"El Paso\\" (Marty Robbins) ‚Äì 4:26 #\\"Ramble On Rose\\" (Garcia, Hunter) ‚Äì 7:44 #\\"It's All Over Now\\" (Bobby Womack, Shirley Womack) ‚Äì 8:58 #\\"Jack-a-Roe\\" (traditional, arranged by Grateful Dead) ‚Äì 5:39 #\\"Lazy Lightning\\" (Bob Weir, John Perry Barlow) ‚Äì 3:16 #\\"Supplication\\" (Weir, Barlow) ‚Äì 5:25 #\\"Althea\\" (Garcia, Hunter) ‚Äì 11;33 #\\"The Music Never Stopped\\" (Weir, Barlow) ‚Äì 8:17 Disc 2 :Second set: #\\"Scarlet Begonias\\" (Garcia, Hunter) ‚Äì 11:42 #\\"Fire on the Mountain\\" (Mickey Hart, Hunter) ‚Äì 15:28 #\\"Samson and Delilah\\" (traditional, arranged by Grateful Dead) ‚Äì 7:45 #\\"Terrapin Station\\" (Garcia, Hunter) ‚Äì 14:11 #\\"Playing in the Band\\" (Weir, Hart, Hunter) ‚Äì 11:20 #\\"Drums\\" (Hart, Bill Kreutzmann) ‚Äì 10:02 Disc 3 #\\"Space\\" (Garcia, Phil Lesh, Weir) ‚Äì 2:27 #\\"Lost Sailor\\" (Weir, Barlow) ‚Äì 7:06 #\\"Saint of Circumstance\\" (Weir, Barlow) ‚Äì 6:11 #\\"Wharf Rat\\" (Garcia, Hunter) ‚Äì 11:05 #\\"Truckin'\\" (Garcia, Lesh, Weir, Hunter) ‚Äì 9:33 :Encore: # * \\"Johnny B.

She later became president again following the resignation of Mrs. John L. Lowes. She spoke in defense of Jane Addams and against the National Women Suffrage Association adopting an amendment that would prohibit any officer or member from participating in a major political party in 1912. She was elected to the board of directors of College Suffragist, part of the National Women Suffrage Association, at that time. She led the Equal Suffrage League to try to get suffrage to go to Missouri voters in 1914, but when the state senate tabled the discussion, she and Mrs. Walter McNab Miller, the state Equal Suffrage League president, started a petition campaign. The measure failed at a rate of nearly 3 to 1 statewide. At the 1916 National Democratic Convention, when thousands of women took to the streets to draw attention to suffrage, O'Neil stood at the end of a \\"golden lane\\" of women representing states with full suffrage, where she was dressed as a \\"spirit of liberty.\\"  Personal life and death  A portrait of O'Neil painted in 1902 by F.L.

It contains only one species, P. antiqua, which is endemic to the Western Ghats of India. Its natural habitat is montane rainforest. It is considered to be the sister taxon to the genus Ahetulla, which it diverged from during the mid- Oligocene. Due to its age, Proahaetulla may be one of the oldest monotypic lineages of snakes to still persist in the Western Ghats. The study that described Proahaetulla also found that the clade containing it and Ahaetulla was a sister group to the genus Dryophiops. Proahaetulla is also the first deeply divergent snake genus to be described from the Western Ghats in over a century; numerous Indian snake species have had new genera created to reclassify them from the genera they were originally classified in, but Proahaetulla is completely new, possibly having never been encountered by science prior to its description as a new genus and species. The species was first discovered in 2011, when an individual was found in the Agasthyamalai Hills of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. It was initially thought to be a new species of Ahaetulla, as it looked very similar to the species A. dispar. However, genetic analyses found it to be deeply divergent from any member in the genus Ahaetulla, so it was classified in its own genus. Both the genus and species were ultimately described in 2019.

It debuted in 1984 at the Los Angeles Auto Show. The name \\"ramarro\\" comes from the Italian word for \\"green lizard\\".  Specifications  The Ramarro uses the chassis from a 1984 C4 Corvette, the same car used to unveil the C4 to the European press at the 1983 Geneva Motor Show. Chevrolet gave Bertone that car to use to build the Ramarro, as well as a port fuel injection V8 engine from the newer 1985 Corvette. The engine remains mostly stock but the radiator and air conditioning have been moved to the back of the car, taking the place of the spare tire which was moved in front of the engine, in order to allow Bertone to design the body with a more tapered, sealed off nose for better airflow and aerodynamics. In order to get air into the radiator, air intakes were placed just behind the rear window on both sides. The only other mechanical change was the addition of experimental Michelin tyres in place of the original Goodyear units. These new tyres measure 280/45VR-17 in the rear and 240/45VR-17 in the front. On the outside, the Ramarro also features sliding doors that slide forward towards the nose of the car, making them easier to open in tight parking spots versus conventional doors which had a wide opening span. Many reviewers have drawn a comparison between these and the doors on the 1954 Kaiser Darrin but the Ramarro's doors are different in that they slide out and forwards whereas the doors on the Darrin retracted into the front fenders. = Interior = The interior of the Ramarro retains the Corvette's factory digital instrumentation and emergency brake handle but most of the original interior has been replaced by custom pieces. The concept features a sculpted single piece bucket seat that moves as one seat but has a hump in the middle for the center console. The interior was retrimmed in specially patterned green leather that was picked to match the exterior and also to resemble the colour and texture of lizard skin, a nod to the Ramarro name. Finally, the Corvette's original automatic transmission was kept but the shift lever was replaced by a large rotary dial gear selector in the center console.  History  Nuccio Bertone reportedly started the Ramarro project because it presented a challenge, and because most of the cars with Bertone designed bodies were sold in America, yet they featured the name of the automaker first and Bertone second, so Bertone wanted to have a car to show in America which bore the \\"Bertone\\" name first and foremost.  Reception  Rear view Bertone originally intended to unveil the car at the Turin Auto Show in the spring of 1984 but the show ended up being rescheduled to a few months later and since the Ramarro was based on the American Corvette, they made the decision to unveil it at the 1984 LA Auto Show instead. The Ramarro was well received at the show and later in 1985 was awarded Auto&Design;'s Car Design Award for its ‚Äúbold ideas,‚Äù which they say gave ‚Äúthe Chevrolet Corvette an entirely new personality.‚Äù  References  Category:Bertone concept vehicles Category:Chevrolet concept vehicles ","title":"Bertone Ramarro"},{"id":"61448055","text":"Jean-Pierre Miens (born 1 November 1949) is a French gymnast.

Jeropiga is the name given to a traditional alcoholic drink of Portuguese origin that is prepared by adding aguardente to grape must. The addition is made in the beginning of the fermentation process, making it different to another Portuguese traditional drink, the abafado, in which aguardente is added during the fermentation process. Preparation The usual given ratios for the confection of jeropiga are of two parts of must to one part of aguardente or brandy. The must's natural fermentation process is interrupted by the addition of the alcohol. Jeropiga traditionally accompanies the magosto autumn festivals, celebrated also in northern Spain and Catalonia, where the festival is known as Casta√±ada. Jeropiga is home-brewed and drunk throughout the year in Tr√°s-os-Montes and the Beira regions in Central Portugal. Historic use in fortified wines Historically, jeropiga has been added to Port wine to increase its sweetness, in a practise that is still applied today to some fortified wines. The historic use of jeropiga mixed with brandy and elderberries as a means of coloring in red wines has also been recorded. Nineteenth-century English writers largely dismissed jeropiga when discussing the port wine trade, with W. H. Bidwell calling it an \\"adulteration used to bringing up the character of ports\\". In 1844, the English wine merchant Joseph James Forrester anonymously published A Word or Two on Port Wine, a pamphlet that, among other criticisms made to the wine trade in the Douro region, denounced the use of jeropiga in wine.

Architecture  Zemo Nikozi church of the Archangel is a small domed structure, measuring 8.5 √ó 5.3 m. It is a form of cross-in-square design, known as kuppelhalle (domed rectangle) and built of neatly dressed grayish basalt stone blocks. The dome rests on pilasters sharply projecting from the longitudinal walls, its drum lit by four windows. The building terminates in a semicircular apse on the east, which has small apsed niches on each side. The transition from the square bay to the dome circle is achieved through squinches and pendentives. The church can be entered through three symmetrically arranged doors in the west, south, and north arms. The doors used to be embellished with semicircular pilasters and arches running above them. The exterior of the dome is adorned with a blind arch supported by a paired colonettes. The north fa√ßade carries a stone carving depicting the equestrian Saint George slaying the dragon and the dome base, to the north, bears three stylized lions carved in relief. A five-line inscription in the medieval Georgian asomtavruli script on the north wall proclaims that the church was built by Bishop Michael (Mikael), who is the same churchman commemorated in an inscription from the church of the Deity. Just above is another inscription, now badly damaged. On a stone above the north window in the dome, between two lion figures, there is the third inscription, arranged in four lines, which mentions Bishop Michael's sisterly nephew, John (Iovane).

In an interview with Bookforum, Oyeyemi talked about Mr. Fox's relationship to her other work, saying: \\"Then there are the books that are like games. Mr. Fox and What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours fit in there. And I think those are the ones that I love‚Äîthe ones I think are useless and not contributing anything. Because of that desire to be happy, and that desire to play, but also, they feel like my own, and not just projects. These are the books where I feel I‚Äôm developing toward something, some style.

He can't stop killing the heroines in his novels in most diabolical fashions. Mary wants to help, as much for Mr. Fox's sake as for the sake of the women in his stories. The complication is that Mary isn't exactly real, she's Mr. Fox's muse and a creation of his mind. But this doesn't stop Mary from challenging Mr. Fox to a game of stories where he becomes both author and subject. Meanwhile, Mr. Fox's wife Daphne is being neglected, and as her husband spends even more time in his study than usual she begins to suspect something is wrong, and that he may possibly even having an affair. Ultimately, Daphne forces her own way into Mr. Fox and Mary's game. Mr. Fox is forced to choose between a world of pure imagination with a not-quite-real muse who he loves nonetheless, and his very real wife who he is always forgetting just how much he loves.

Timbery's shellwork has contemporary elements, blended with the traditional medium. She has work in the collections of several art museums throughout Australia.  Biography  Timbery was born in 1931 in Port Kembla and is of Bidjigal Aboriginal heritage. Timbery began to create shellwork at a young age. She comes from a long line of shellworkers, including her great-grandmother, Emma Timbery. Timbery and her sister, Rose, began to sell their shellwork in the 1940s. Timbery currently works in La Perouse. ABC produced a documentary about her in 2007, titled She Sells Sea Shells.  Work  Timbery's work was exhibited at the 1988 opening of the Powerhouse Museum. In 1997, her work was exhibited at the Manly Regional Museum and Gallery in the show, \\"Djalarinji - Something that Belongs to Us.\\" Her work was included in the 2004 show, \\"Terra Alterisu: Land of Another\\" held at the College of Fine Arts in Paddington. She also exhibited in the 2008 Campbelltown Arts Centre show \\"Ngadhu Ngulili, Ngeaninyagu - A Personal History of Aboriginal Art in the Premier State.\\" For the Message Sticks Festival in 2001, Timbery was asked to create shellworked versions of the Sydney Opera House. The Opera House pieces reflect a more contemporary use of shellworking. In 2005, she earned the NSW Indigenous Art Prize for her work. She also decorated shoes for the design label, Romance Was Born for their Spring/Summer 2009/2010 collection. Timbery's piece, Shellworked Slippers (2008) is made up of 200 scuffs embellished with shellwork. The piece is also a memorial to the Stolen Generations. The piece was exhibited at the Sydney Biennale and is in the collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia. Shellworked Slippers also represents the strength of Aboriginal women. Three of her shellworked Sydney Harbour Bridges are part of the collection of the National Museum of Australia. Timbery also has art at the National Gallery of Australia and the Art Gallery of New South Wales.  Honours  A building at the University of New South Wales has been named in honour of Timbery, the Creative Practice Lab (ETCPL).

Slinkard entered the school in 1907, and studied under Walter Hedges, a student of Robert Henri. The League awarded Slinkard a 1908 scholarship to study under Henri at the William Merritt Chase School in New York City.Phil Kovinick, \\"The Art Student League of Los Angeles Chronology,\\" in Julia Armstrong-Totten, et al., A Seed of Modernism: The Art Students League of Los Angeles, 1906-1953, exhibition catalogue, Pasadena Museum of California Art. 2008.

The school organized an exhibition of works by Slinkard and League alumnus Pruett Carter in August 1910, which received a highly favorable review in The Los Angeles Times. In early 1911, at age 23, Slinkard was named director of the League.

In addition to being a prodigious artistic talent, Slinkard was a charismatic teacher. But his adherence to teaching the Realist style of the Ashcan School alienated experienced students such as Conrad Buff and Frank Curran, who had already established their own personal styles.Will South, \\"The Art Student League of Los Angeles: A Brief History,\\" in Julia Armstrong-Totten, et al., A Seed of Modernism: The Art Students League of Los Angeles, 1906-1953, exhibition catalogue, Pasadena Museum of California Art. 2008. The League provided a morning life class for women and men, an evening life class for men, with afternoons open for individual work in the studio. Slinkard socialized with students outside the school, and their Saturday night pot-luck dinners were held at the League. Slinkard became romantically involved with artist's model Jessie Daisy Augsbury, and married her after she became pregnant. The wedding took place on February 15, 1912, and their son Robert (1912-1964)Robert R. Slinkard at Find-A-Grave. was born on March 19.Charles C. Eldredge and Geneva M. Gano, The Legend of Rex Slinkard (Iris & B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts at Stanford University, 2011). Slinkard deserted them after less than a year, forcing her to divorce him. The scandal led to his resignation as director of the League in January 1913. Sprinchorn succeeded him as director. =Saugus= Slinkard retreated into self-imposed exile at the family ranch in Saugus. After not painting for close to a year, he began a series of increasingly moody self-portraits-- Acolyte-Self-Portrait (1914-1916),Acolyte-Self-Portrait at Cantor Arts Center.

As part of the 91st Infantry Division, he would have been deployed to Europe in Summer 1918, but he contracted scarlet fever in May. He recovered, and was promoted to sergeant at Newark, New Jersey in July. While waiting to be shipped overseas, he contracted Spanish flu and was hospitalized on October 12. He died of pneumonia at St. Vincent's Hospital, Manhattan, on October 18, 1918. Carl Sprinchorn accompanied his body on the train ride from New York City to Los Angeles, for funeral and burial. At the time of his death, Slinkard was engaged to Gladys Whitney Williams, who inherited most of his paintings and drawings. Posthumous recognition The Los Angeles Museum mounted a memorial exhibition of Slinkard's work, June 3-30, 1919. Marsden Hartley, who never met the artist but had been shown his paintings and letters by Carl Sprinchorn, penned an effusive essay for the catalogue.Emmanuel Cooper, The Sexual Perspective: Homosexuality and Art in the Last 100 Years in the West (London: Routledge & Kogan Paul, 1986), p. 102.

CINEMQ was first established in 2015.  Other festivals  CINEMQ is one of three unconnected LGBT film festivals in Shanghai. The second LGBT film festival is the Shanghai Queer Film Festival, which launched in September 2017, and is a volunteer-run, not-for-profit event that aims to help facilitate and promote the work of filmmakers from Chinese and other Asian backgrounds. The third is the ShanghaiPRIDE Film Festival which launched in 2015 and is a subdivision of ShanghaiPRIDE, an annual LGBT pride event.  History  CINEMQ is a volunteer-led, not-for-profit collective engaged in queer cultural activism through film and screen culture in Mainland China. Their main activities include a thematic queer film screening and party series - which are described as a 'mix tape of short films, visuals and music'. They screen films that are 'queer, or concerned with issues of gender or non- heterosexualities'. Drawing on film submissions and other sources, they take an experimental approach to film programming that 'highlights or challenges' concepts relevant to the local queer community, challenging 'a diverse audience on how they think about issues of gender and sexuality in life and in media'. Due to government restrictions, CINEMQ and other LGBT film festivals in China play primarily in underground spaces. They have also screened films in Beijing and London. Unlike the city's other film festivals, which work in collaboration with foreign consulates and corporate sponsors, CINEMQ is more closely aligned with Shanghai's underground arts scene, and youth culture. According to organizer Will Dai, \\"Queerness is very much entangled with youth culture in Shanghai. There's a fluidity within these sub-cultural groups that see gender and sexuality explored and sometimes dismantled through fashion, music, and art.\\" Youth culture's experimentation with sexuality and gender in China is, according to de Kloet and Fung, a reaction to the dominance of heterosexual-patriarchal discourses in China. They identify youth engagement in queer culture(s) as an act of disruption. \\"A lot of young people are catching up to this idea of being free and expressive of their individuality. To us, I think that‚Äôs the essence of being queer,\\" Dai states. \\" CINEMQ's content can be seen as political, but since we‚Äôre pushing it through culture and cinema it might not seem as confrontational ‚Äì it‚Äôs soft power.\\" CINEMQ was established in 2015 by Matthew Baren and Alvin Li. The collective was originally launched as a creative crowd-building initiative for ShanghaiPRIDE Film Festival. The aim was to broaden the reach of ShanghaiPRIDE to better represent local diversity. According to Baren, \\"whilst Pride is a great organization which does a lot for the community, there are a lot of people who aren‚Äôt reached by their events or who don‚Äôt feel represented by them. Our idea was to create a space for fringe queers, people of non-distinct sexuality or gender, for people who wanted to be challenged by what they saw on a night out whilst still having fun.\\" In 2017 CINEMQ ended its association with ShanghaiPRIDE. They expanded their operation to publish a bilingual online magazine through Chinese social media platform WeChat and covering queer cinema and screen culture, with a focus on China and East Asia. In 2019 CINEMQ partnered with London-based 'Queer' Asia to co-present their annual film festival. The 11-day event saw film screenings and discussions hosted at venues including British Museum, SOAS University of London, King‚Äôs College London and the University of Warwick.

Biography  While the Chemla family was originally from Djerba, Jacob Chemla served as a legal representative for litigants of the Beth din of Tunis. Chemla was an active philanthropist in the Jewish community of Tunis, serving as a founding member of the Jewish Hospital of Tunis among other ventures. = Journalist, author, translator = First page of Chemla's translation of The Count of Monte Cristo in Judeo-Tunisian Arabic In 1878, Chemla began a career in journalism with his brother-in-law, Messaoud Maarek. For over thirty years, until 1925, he helped bring in a period of growth in Judeo-Tunisian Arabic literature. He published two novels, Amour et malice (Love and Malice) in 1912 and Les C≈ìurs purs (The Pure Hearts) in 1923. Chemla translated multiple titles into Hebrew and Judeo-Tunisian Arabic, including The Jews of Spain at the Time of the Inquisition and The Count of Monte Cristo, which he originally released as a serial and later in full during the 1880s. = Ceramics = Chemla is perhaps most well known around Tunisia for his activities in ceramics. His father Ha√Øm Chemla was named by the Bey during the 1860s as the tax collector for the Artisans of Tunis (who would often pay in kind with donations of pottery). Haim Chemla would often pay the Bey the equivalent tax in cash while re-selling the pottery he had collected. Jacob Chemla followed in his father's footsteps around 1880, when he opened a shop in the Place des Potiers √† Tunis,.Le papier √† en-t√™te commercial de son entreprise indique 1881 comme date de fondation. In 1887, the Tunisian government contracted him to help revive traditional ceramics. In the Interwar period, production was moved to French Algeria and the United States, and the company presented at expositions in 1925, 1931 and 1937. Chemla's ceramic tiles decorated the homes of the rich in Tunis, Sidi Bou Said and La Marsa. He brought in his sons Victor (1892-1954), Albert (1894-1963) and Mo√Øse (Mouche) (1897-1977) to the family business. After the death of Victor and Albert's departure for Algeria in the 1930s, Moise succeeded his father and renamed the business Les fils de J. Chemla (Sons of Jacob Chemla), which operated as a family business until 1966. In the 1960s, President of Tunisia Habib Bourguiba contracted the company to install ceramic panels at Carthage Palace.

His tenure ended in May 1941, when he was abducted, tortured and killed by followers of the Usta≈°e movement. Platon attended seminary in his hometown of Belgrade and later graduated from the Moscow Theological Academy. He served as a military chaplain in the Royal Serbian Army during both Balkan Wars, as well as in the opening months of World War I. In 1936, he was ordained a bishop. Two years later, Platon was appointed Bishop of Ohrid and Bitola, but was dismissed from his post after criticizing his predecessor and accusing him of fomenting discord within the eparchy. In October 1940, he assumed the position of Bishop of Banja Luka. Six months later, Yugoslavia was invaded and occupied by the Axis powers. Banja Luka became part of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a fascist puppet state ruled by the Usta≈°e. On 24 April, the Usta≈°e commissioner of Banja Luka, Viktor Gutiƒá, issued a decree ordering all citizens who had been born in Serbia or Montenegro to leave the city within five days. Platon refused to abide by the order. On the evening of 4‚Äì5 May, he was arrested by the Usta≈°e. The following night, he and another cleric were taken from their cell and driven to the outskirts of Banja Luka, where they were tortured and killed, and their mutilated bodies pushed into the Vrbas. Platon's body was discovered on the banks of the Vrbas on 23 May and buried in an unmarked grave the following day. He was one of several hundred Serbian Orthodox clerics killed in the NDH over the course of the war. In 1973, Platon's remains were exhumed and reinterred in the crypt of the Church of the Holy Trinity in Banja Luka. In 1998, Platon was elevated to the status of hieromartyr by the Serbian Orthodox Church, and canonized two years later. His feast day is celebrated annually on 5 May, the date of his death. Biography =Early life= Platon was born Milivoje Jovanoviƒá in Belgrade, Serbia, on 29 September 1874. His father, Ilija, was a career soldier who had been born in Trebinje and his mother, Jelka (), was from Foƒça. He was baptized at the Church of the Ascension in Belgrade. He completed his primary education in Vranje and secondary education in Ni≈°. In 1892, Jovanoviƒá enrolled in the Serbian Orthodox seminary in Belgrade's Bogoslovija district. Three years later, in 1895, he took his monastic vows and adopted the name Platon. He graduated from the seminary in 1896. He was subsequently ordained a deacon and later a presbyter. In 1896, Platon moved to Russia to continue his education at the Moscow Theological Academy. He enrolled in the academy in 1897, becoming the first Serb to receive the Ivan Aksakov Scholarship. Platon completed his studies at the Moscow Theological Academy in 1901. Upon his return from Russia, Platon was raised to the rank of syncellus and assigned to the Rajinovac Monastery in the Belgrade suburb of Grocka. Platon requested that he be allowed to teach at the seminary in Bogoslovija, but this was denied. Instead, he was assigned to a theology school in Aleksinac, where he taught between 1903 and 1906. He also taught theology in Jagodina for several months in 1906. In 1906, Platon was certified to be a professor of theology, and raised to the rank of protosyncellus. In 1908, he was entrusted with editing the Gazette of the Serbian Orthodox Patriarchate, and the following year, he was raised to the rank of archimandrite. In 1910, he was relieved of his duties as the editor of the Gazette. =Clerical service= Following the outbreak of the Balkan Wars in November 1912, Platon was summoned to serve as a military chaplain in the Morava Brigade of the Royal Serbian Army. Platon also served as a military chaplain in the opening months of World War I. He was relieved of his chaplaincy on 11 December 1914 and permitted to resume teaching at the seminary in Bogoslovija. He spent the entirety of the war in Serbia, refusing to evacuate to the Greek island of Corfu along with the Royal Serbian Army after the country was defeated and occupied by the Central Powers. By late 1918, the Central Powers had been defeated. Austria-Hungary collapsed and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed Yugoslavia) was established over its former Balkan possessions. In 1919, due to the lobbying of his political opponents within the Bishops' Council of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Platon was forcibly retired, forcing him to find work as an apprentice in a carpentry shop. Within several months, Platon managed to find work as an accountant. He was later appointed the manager of a publishing house. Following the death of one of his chief rivals in 1922, Platon was permitted to return to the priesthood by the Bishop's Council. He was subsequently appointed archimandrite of the Rakovica Monastery, as well as the administrator of its monastic school. Within several years of his appointment, Platon was accused of misappropriating funds and relieved of his duties without restitution. After lodging several unsuccessful appeals with the Bishops' Council, Platon unsuccessfully petitioned the Minister of Education to permit him to teach at a seminary. He then appealed to Dositej, the Bishop of Ni≈°, who promised Platon a teaching position at a local seminary. Dositej subsequently wrote a letter to the Minister of Education, requesting that Platon be allowed to teach at the seminary, but Platon's opponents in the Ministry of Education successfully lobbied for his request to be ignored. Dositej subsequently appointed Platon as the archimandrite of the Poganovo Monastery. The death of Patriarch Dimitrije in 1930 resulted in several of Platon's political opponents, who had long enjoyed the late patriarch's patronage, being demoted in status. In 1932, the Bishop's Council dismissed the charges against Platon stemming from his tenure at Rakovica. In November 1932, Platon was appointed manager of the monastery printing press at Sremski Karlovci and once again entrusted with editing the Gazette of the Serbian Orthodox Patriarchate. In 1933, he launched a children's newspaper called Little Bogoljub. The following year, he was appointed the archimandrite of the Kru≈°edol Monastery. =Ordination as Bishop= On 4 October 1936, Platon was ordained a bishop in a ceremony presided over by Patriarch Varnava at Sremski Karlovci. During the Concordat Crisis, Platon wrote a pamphlet titled \\"Remarks and Objections to the Concordat Project\\" (), which was published anonymously. It soon emerged that Platon was its author, causing a rift between him and the Royal Yugoslav Government, headed by Prime Minister Milan Stojadinoviƒá. On 19 July 1937, the adoption of the concordat was put before a vote in the National Assembly, prompting street demonstrations led by high-ranking Serbian Orthodox clerics, which were violently suppressed by gendarmes wielding truncheons. Platon scuffled with the gendarmes during the unrest, during which a bishop and a priest were killed. The press termed the riots the Bloody Liturgy (). On 23 July, the National Assembly approved the legislation. Nevertheless, Stojadinoviƒá announced he would postpone the implementation of the concordat in order to mend ties with the Serbian Orthodox Church. Several hours later, Patriarch Varnava died of a heart attack. On 22 June 1938, the Bishops' Council elected Platon to the vacant Eparchy of Ohrid and Bitola. Following his arrival in southwestern Macedonia, Platon was surprised to find that the priests of his diocese were quarreling amongst themselves. On 19 December 1939, during a service to mark the feast of Saint Nicholas, Platon delivered a sermon in which he denounced his predecessor, and chastised him for inciting division and discontent within the diocese. The remarks proved controversial and the Bishops' Council sided with Platon's predecessor, demanding that Platon formally apologize before the Bishops' Council and beg for its forgiveness. Faced with the prospect of being defrocked, Platon begrudgingly obliged. Although the Ministry of Religious Affairs wished to see him forcibly retired, the Bishops' Council decided to transfer Platon to the Eparchy of Banja Luka. Because his opponents had declared that they would protest his arrival, Platon arrived in Banja Luka unannounced. On 1 October 1940, he assumed the position of Bishop of Banja Luka without undergoing a formal enthronement ceremony. To prevent clerics from assuming the position of bishop without being formally enthroned in the future, the Bishops' Council soon issued a prohibition against such practices, though Platon was allowed to keep his post. =Death= Following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of the Independent State of Croatia (; NDH), a puppet state governed by the fascist, Croatian nationalist Usta≈°e movement, under the leadership of Ante Paveliƒá. Almost immediately, the Usta≈°e set about implementing race laws targeting Serbs, Jews and Roma. The movement's primary targets were Serbs, whom the Usta≈°e resented and collectively blamed for the marginalization of Yugoslavia's Croat population during the interwar period, citing incidents of police brutality, political assassinations, voter suppression, and the centralization of political power within Serbia-proper. Shortly after the establishment of the NDH, Viktor Gutiƒá was named the Usta≈°e commissioner () for the city of Banja Luka. Gutiƒá swiftly implemented a string of anti-Serb and anti-Semitic measures. All Serbs, Jews and \\"enemies of the state\\" working in the public sector had their employment terminated and their jobs were allocated to Croats and Bosnian Muslims who were deemed loyal. Additionally, Serbs and Jews were forbidden from using the same public transportation as Croats and Bosnian Muslims. On 24 April, Gutiƒá issued a decree ordering that all individuals born in \\"the former Serbia and Montenegro\\", or had roots therein, leave Banja Luka within five days. Platon decided to arrange a meeting with Gutiƒá in an effort to ameliorate the anti- Serb measures that he had decreed, and if possible, convince him to postpone his deadline for the deportation of certain Serbs. Platon selected Du≈°an Maƒçkiƒá, a priest from the town of Kljuƒç, to act as his intermediary. Maƒçkiƒá and Gutiƒá met on 27 April. During the meeting, Gutiƒá described the anti-Serb measures that the Usta≈°e were implementing as \\"God's punishment for you Serbs\\", but agreed to postpone the deportations by ten days. Following their conversation, Gutiƒá unexpectedly decided to appoint Maƒçkiƒá as Platon's successor, given that the latter was scheduled to be deported. Maƒçkiƒá complained that he was not second in rank to Platon, but Gutiƒá insisted, reasoning that Platon's deputy bishop, Sava, had been born in Montenegro and would therefore also be deported. Maƒçkiƒá reluctantly accepted the appointment, a decision that drew the ire of much of the local clergy. Several days later, local newspapers began to report that Maƒçkiƒá had been appointed Platon's successor. Civilians began arriving at Maƒçkiƒá's home, pleading with him to intervene on behalf of their friends and relatives. Despite being born in Serbia, Platon refused to leave his diocese. On 1 May, he wrote Gutiƒá a letter pledging that he would not \\"abandon his flock\\", irrespective of the latter's decree. He was arrested by the Usta≈°e on the night of 4‚Äì5 May. Also arrested that night were many other prominent Serbs and Serbian Orthodox priests. Platon was detained inside the Habsburg-era prison known as the Black House. The Episcopal Dean of Gradi≈°ka, Du≈°an, was his cellmate. On the evening of 5 May, Platon and Du≈°an were taken from their cell by Asim ƒêeliƒá, one of Gutic's bodyguards. Together with two other Usta≈°e, Mirko Kovaƒçeviƒá and Nino ƒåondriƒá, ƒêeliƒá forced the two clerics into the back of a car and drove them out of the city. They were subsequently dragged to the banks of the Vrbas, near the village of Rebrovac. ƒêeliƒá, Kovaƒçeviƒá and ƒåondriƒá first beat the two clerics. Platon's beard was subsequently torn off, his eyes gouged out, and his nose and ears cut off. Pieces of his flesh were removed with a knife and salt was poured on his wounds. A hot iron rod was then driven into his chest. Platon finally succumbed after being shot in the head. He was 66 years old. Du≈°an was killed in a similar manner. Both clerics' bodies were subsequently pushed into the Vrbas. On 23 May, Platon's mutilated body was discovered on the banks of the Vrbas. Legacy Church of the Holy Trinity, Banja Luka Through an intermediary, Maƒçkiƒá managed to persuade a group of Bosnian Muslim and Croat civilians to bury Platon's body. On 24 May, his body was buried without ceremony at a military cemetery in Banja Luka. The cross placed above his burial plot was left unmarked. Of the ten Serbian Orthodox bishops in the NDH, three were killed, including Platon. The nine Serbian Orthodox dioceses in the NDH were extinguished, and according to Velikonja, the Serbian Orthodox Church \\"practically ceased to exist\\" within the puppet state. Velikonja states that there were 577 Serbian Orthodox priests, monks and other religious dignitaries in the NDH in April 1941. By December, there were none left. \\"Between 214 and 217 were murdered outright,\\" Velikonja writes, \\"334 were exiled to German- occupied Serbia, eighteen fled of their own accord, three were arrested, and five died of natural causes.\\" Mojzes states that 187 Serbian Orthodox priests and thirty monks were killed in the NDH over the course of the war. In addition, several hundred priests were exiled. Stella Alexander puts the death toll at three bishops and 214 priests. The historian Jozo Tomasevich writes that around 150 Serbian Orthodox priests were killed between May and December 1941 alone. In October 1944, ƒêeliƒá was hanged on the orders of the Croatian Home Guard general Vladimir Metiko≈°, citing insubordination. A post-war investigation conducted by the Yugoslav State Commission established that Platon's killing had been ordered by Gutiƒá. As the NDH disintegrated in 1945, Gutiƒá fled to Italy. He was subsequently apprehended by the Allies and extradited to Yugoslavia, where he was put on trial for treason, collaboration, war crimes and crimes against humanity. He was convicted on all counts in February 1947 and hanged later that month. On 1 July 1973, Platon's remains were exhumed and reinterred in the crypt of the Church of the Holy Trinity in Banja Luka, which had been dynamited by the Usta≈°e during the war and had only recently been rebuilt. In 1998, the Serbian Orthodox Church elevated Platon to the status of hieromartyr. The religious scholar Dimitri Brady argues that Platon was \\"martyred for [his] ethnic affiliation as much as for [his] religious convictions\\", and draws a parallel between his murder and that of the monk Father Chariton, who was abducted, tortured and killed by the Kosovo Liberation Army in June 1999. Platon was canonized by the Serbian Orthodox Church on 21 May 2000, in a ceremony held in Belgrade's Cathedral of Saint Sava, together with several other clergymen who had perished at the hands of the Usta≈°e. His remains were soon disinterred from the crypt of the Church of the Holy Trinity and interred as relics inside a sarcophagus in front of the church's altar. Platon's feast is celebrated annually on 5 May, the anniversary of his death. The historian Vjekoslav Perica argues that Platon's canonization and that of the other clergymen was undertaken in response to Pope John Paul II's controversial beatification of the wartime Archbishop of Zagreb Aloysius Stepinac in October 1998.

The film is a sample of the biodiversity of Colombia, recorded in 85 different locations to achieve the portrait of 20 ecosystems. Plot The documentary covers part of Colombian biodiversity in a narrative that contrasts places such as the depths of the Pacific Ocean on Malpelo Island, the arrival of humpback whales every year to the Utr√≠a National Park in Choc√≥, the footprints of Ciudad Perdida in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, the flight of the condor in the El Cocuy National Park, the p√°ramos of the Andes, the Sierra de Chiribiquete and its cave paintings, the Eastern Plains, the Amazon and the Providencia Island, among other places. It also shows some species of national fauna such as crabs, Sloth, Cotton-top tamarin, Orinoco crocodile, arawana, jaguar and hummingbird. Production The inspiration for the film was given thanks to the 2009 documentary film Home, which portrays the natural resources of 54 countries, but in which Colombia does not appear although it is the second country in the world with more biodiversity. At the time of its launch, Francisco Forero Bonell, a photographer who discovered some unknown petroglyphs in the Sierra del Chiribiquete, worked as a Google sales manager and had contact with the film thanks to its distribution deployment on YouTube, where it was published to be free in its entirety. He learned firsthand the work of cinematographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand, specializing in animal images and aerial photography. This inspiration led to the conception of a cinematographic project, unprecedented in Colombia especially for the technology involved in its production and the logistics to carry it out. The alliance for production was made between the Ecoplanet Foundation and √âxito Group through its Vice President of Marketing, Mart√≠n Nova, together with the producer Off The Fence, headed by executive producer Ellen Windemuth, who was in charge of filming. ‚ÄúIt is also the first time in history that a Latin American brand, √âxito Group, finances a film about the country's need to support conservation and unification. And the first time in the history of the world that a single brand has made this effort‚Äù said Ellen Windemuth of Off The Fence. Filming began in 2014 when underwater cameraman Bob Cranston (responsible for the Life documentary series) spent a week immersed in Malpelo Island and captured more than 150 minutes of hammerhead sharks in their natural habitat and continued with 9 weeks of shooting in the Amazon jungle with the work of Richard Kirby. The footage presented in the film are portraits of the most hidden habitats in an immersion experience for the spectators. In total there were 38 species and 20 ecosystems portrayed in the film. The team included 30 professionals from Off the Fence and 57 Colombians, who for 4 years toured Colombia under the direction of Mike Slee. In total the film cost 3.5 million dollars and by September 30, 2015 had raised 2.5 million dollars. Premiere The first release of the film took place on September 9, 2015 in Nabusimake, capital of the Arhuaco indigenous people in northern Colombia and a sacred town where meetings are held to make decisions between the communities of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. The community present there was able to attend a film screening for the first time, something totally unknown to many of them. The premiere in this place was held with the support of Ambulante, an NGO that organizes film screenings in various places. Although a quarter of the community does not understand Spanish because it only speaks the native language, they proved to understand the images projected on the screen. The premiere of the film was held on September 10, 2015 at the Teatro Col√≥n in Bogot√°, with the presence of the producer and producer team as well as personalities such as Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, Gabriel Vallejo (Minister of Environment), Carlos Mario Giraldo (President of the √âxito Group), Mariana Garc√©s (Minister of Culture) and Yesid Reyes (Minister of Justice) among other public figures. Topics In 90 minutes, the filmmakers invite to discover or rediscover the \\"paradise that still exists\\" in the country with a tour that goes through the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and explores the lands of the Eastern Plains, Choc√≥, the Malpelo and Gorgona Islands, the Colombian Caribbean, the Chiribiquete mountain range, Providencia Island and the Andean region. According to executive producer Ellen Windemuth of Off the Fence, it is a film with a thorough scientific investigation never before seen in Colombian cinema, about the multitude of habitats but also about the massive environmental threats to which they are exposed. It also contains a conservation message. The film portrays the most prone to degradation ecosystems by human hands, including those that inhabit the jaguar and the golden frog, two of the most threatened species in the country. The film portrays species like hummingbirds and sloths, which existence is in risk, particularly as a result of the elimination of the delicate ecosystems that have so far given them home and livelihood. In that sense, the film and its massive reproduction notify Colombians of the enormous responsibility they have to protect these unrecoverable spaces. In addition, he proposes a call to action, according to Mart√≠n Nova, Vice President of Marketing of the √âxito Group: ‚ÄúIf we don't change the current predatory attitude, these landscapes, parks, snowfalls or fauna in danger of extinction may not exist in some years and these images they will be only a testimony of what was, of what existed‚Äù. According to director Mike Slee, the aim of the film was to enchant the local audience, achieve a reaction in them and in the end an attitude of protection against nature: ‚Äúwhen you have an audience in love, and see that this is in danger, It is easier to react to protect what he loves. That's why I built that script: that those animals, those beings that appear there, generate an emotion. And then, a reaction‚Äù. Music The creator of the film's original music is David Campbell, a composer with a career in soundtracks from movies like Spider-Man 2, Brokeback Mountain and World War Z. He was contacted by Colombian singer Juanes, with whom he has worked on 6 of his musical albums, who summoned him to create the music of the film. Under his direction was the mixture of the compositions of Carlos Vives, Juanes, Fonseca, ChocQuibTown, Walter Silva, Aterciopelados and Andr√©s Castro, all performed by the National Symphony Orchestra of Colombia. Each of the artists took a scene from the film as an inspiration for their composition and then Campbell chose where in the film he would use the music. According to him, the film has almost 90 minutes of music, which is unusual because normally the tapes have a maximum of 40 minutes of soundtrack. Reception In its first weekend, the movie was seen by 328.786 people in cinema, it was the most watched movie of that weekend. And by December 31, 2015 it was already the most watched Colombian film in the country, with 2,371.112 viewers. In an interview with the newspaper El Espectador, Carlos Ogliastri of Royal Films ensures \\"any Colombian film that does not talk about drug trafficking, crimes, corrupt politicians and does not have a foul vocabulary, will be welcomed by all Colombians\\". \\"The great reception of this documentary shows that the national public is betting on other forms of representation of the country and that it sees in the cinema a way to raise awareness about issues that affect us all\\" said in the same article Adelfa Mart√≠nez, director of Proimagen Colombia. The movie has aroused various discussions and criticisms regarding environmental policy decisions in Colombia, for alliances in its distribution and dissemination with different government entities, mainly the Ministry of Environment. Various opinion columns treat the subject of the film as a distraction from the country's environmental problem, which faces mining crises and controversial decisions about the use of land and resources both in cities and in protected reserves. There were also several positive opinion columns that appreciated the film for its contribution to the discussion of the danger and threats to country's biodiversity.

Early life  Barbaro grew up in North Haven, Connecticut. His mother, Jean, worked as a library media specialist at Anna Reynolds Elementary School in Newington, Connecticut, and his father, Frank, was a New Haven, Connecticut city firefighter. His mother is Jewish and Barbaro identifies as Jewish. Barbaro has an older sister, Tracy Barbaro, who works at Harvard University as a research lab coordinator. In middle school, he and his sister delivered the New Haven Register every weekday at 6am. Both attended Hamden Hall Country Day School in Hamden, Connecticut. = High school and college journalism = In high school, Barbaro wrote for Hamden Hall's official newspaper called The Advent, and he ‚Äì along with classmate and future New York Times colleague Ross Douthat ‚Äì also co-founded and ran the school's underground newspaper, La Verite. In high school, Barbaro aspired to be the New York Times' Jerusalem Bureau Chief. He graduated from Yale University in 2002 with a Bachelor's degree in history. While at Yale, he reported for the Yale Daily News and later became its editor-in-chief, overseeing a staff of nearly 100 student writers.  Career  = 2002‚Äì2016: Reporter = After his graduation from Yale, Barbaro joined The Washington Post in 2002 as a reporter covering the biotechnology industry. In 2005, he joined The New York Times, where he first covered Walmart extensively until 2007 for the Business section. Next, he covered New York City Hall and the American retail industry. Later, he became a national political correspondent for the Times. During the 2016 United States presidential election, Barbaro frequently wrote front-page articles and became one of the most prominent Times reporters covering Donald Trump and the election. = 2016‚Äìpresent: Podcast host =  The Run-Up  In August 2016, The New York Times launched The Run-Up, a twice-a-week political podcast hosted by Barbaro, that aired for the final three months before the presidential election in November.  The Daily  In February 2017, The New York Times launched The Daily, its first podcast to air five days a week, and announced Barbaro as its host. In its first year, The Daily attracted an audience of one million listeners a day. The podcast, which has 20‚Äì30-minute-long episodes, has experienced tremendous success and was the #1 podcast in the United States for every month of 2019. Despite The Times' several other podcasts, most of the newspaper's audio revenue is from The Daily, which attracts several million listeners every month. In August 2020, incoming President and CEO Meredith Kopit Levien noted that The Daily had more than 3.5 million subscribers every day, a \\"vastly larger\\" audience than both the Times' daily and Sunday paper.  Public image  Barbaro's success with The Daily and distinct appearance lead many to compare him to Ira Glass, host and producer of This American Life. He is known for his distinctive voice, commonly described as \\"dulcet\\", and his \\"staccato\\" speech style. In the past few years since The Daily launched, Barbaro has received significant media coverage. He has made sold-out public appearances around the country, and a wide range of media outlets have interviewed him about The Daily, journalism, and politics. He has been featured on television shows such as Late Night with Seth Meyers, CBS This Morning, PBS NewsHour, in forums such as South by Southwest (SXSW) as well as on Vox's Recode Decode podcast and NPR's talk show 1A. The New Yorker also ran an article entitled: \\"An Appreciation of Michael Barbaro and The Daily.\\" In November 2018, Liev Schreiber portrayed Barbaro on Saturday Night Live.  Awards and honors  In 2018, Barbaro won a duPont-Columbia University Award, one of the most prestigious awards in journalism, for his work on The Daily. Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, which administers the award, called The Daily \\"one of the signature achievements in podcasting this year,\\" and said that the podcast is \\"raising the journalistic bar and inspiring a wave of imitators.\\" Vox ranked him number 67 on their 2017 Recode 100 List, People Magazine ranked him one of the \\"15 Sexiest Newsmen Alive\\" in 2017, and Crain's New York Business named him as a member of its 40 Under 40 List for 2018. In 2019, he gave the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism commencement speech. In January 2020, Barbaro co-hosted the 2020 duPont- Columbia Awards with CNN's Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour.  Personal life  In October 2014, Barbaro married Timothy Levin, a fellow Yale graduate. Levin, eight years Barbaro's senior, is the founder of Bespoke Education, a tutoring and test prep company. In July 2018, it was reported that Barbaro and Levin had since divorced. In a June 2019 interview with Evening Standard, Barbaro mentioned that it \\"wasn't a coincidence\\" that he and his husband broke up shortly after The Daily launched. He said: ‚Äú[The show] was a massive change, and it exposed things to me about my life. It made me reflect on who I was. Anytime you go through a major life change it tests every relationship.\\" After his relationship with Levin ended, Barbaro began a relationship with his coworker and The Daily executive producer, Lisa Tobin. They both report to the same boss, Sam Dolnick. A New York profile on Barbaro from January 2020 reported that Barbaro and Tobin are engaged and bought an apartment together in Brooklyn in 2019. Regarding Barbaro's sexual identity, the same article noted: \\"[Barbaro] declines to define his sexual orientation or whether he considers it to have shifted.\\" References Category:1979 births Category:21st-century American journalists Category:American men podcasters Category:American podcasters Category:Hamden Hall Country Day School alumni Category:Jewish American journalists Category:Journalists from Connecticut Category:LGBT Jews Category:LGBT journalists from the United States Category:LGBT people from Connecticut Category:Living people Category:People from North Haven, Connecticut Category:The New York Times people Category:Yale University alumni ","title":"Michael Barbaro"},{"id":"61448622","text":"The Cardiff & District League is a football league covering the city of Cardiff and surrounding areas in South Wales.

He was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of the British Empire for his perseverance, and after the war he wrote several memoirs. Early life Sorokin was born on to a working-class Russian family in Glubokoe. His family moved to Krasnodar oblast in 1920, where he attended school and was employed as an assistant locomotive engineer while training at an aeroclub. After entering the navy in 1937 he graduated from the Yeisk Naval Aviation School in 1939. He then was assigned to the 72nd Mixed Aviation Regiment of the Black Sea Fleet, based in Sevastopol. World War II Starting on 22 June 1941, Sorokin was engaged in World War II operations defending against Operation Barbarossa. The next month he was transferred to the Northern Fleet, where he flew in the squadron under the command of Boris Safonov. He was credited with his first aerial victory on 19 July 1941, and on 18 October 1941 he was promoted to deputy squadron commander. However, just one week later he was badly injured after a forced landing on the Arctic tundra, where he remained for four days before receiving medical attention, resulting in severe frostbite that ended up requiring his feet to be amputated. He received surgery in Kirov before returning to his regiment in March 1943. By the time he was promoted to the position of regimental navigator, the regiment had received the guards designation and been renamed as the 2nd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment. On 19 August 1944 he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union, and in December that year he transferred to the 11th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment, where he was also the senior navigator. In total he flew 267 sorties, gaining 10 solo and one probable shootdowns during the war.  Postwar  Almost immediately after the war he was discharged from the military since his need for prosthetic feet was considered to be a disability. However, he was able to re-enter the military in 1952 and posted to the 614th Fighter Aviation Regiment, but soon returned to the reserve in 1955. As a civilian he lived in Moscow, joined the Union of Journalists of the USSR, and authored 15 books. He died on 19 March 1978 and was buried in the Kuntsevo cemetery.

Launched in 1921, the vessel was constructed as Nourmahal for Vincent Astor of New York as a pleasure yacht. He sold the vessel in the late 1920s and it was renamed Conseco. The Royal Canadian Navy, finding a lack of suitable vessels in Canadian ownership to be taken into naval service, sent Canadian yacht owners south to the United States to find those vessels. Conseco was acquired and brought north to Halifax, Nova Scotia where the vessel was converted to an armed yacht in 1940. Renamed Otter the ship participated in the Battle of the Atlantic, escorting convoys and patrolling the Canadian coast. On 26 March 1941, Otter suffered a catastrophic fire aboard that sank the armed yacht. Two officers and seventeen ratings died in the incident. Description In Royal Canadian Navy service as an armed yacht, Otter had a displacement of with a length of , a beam of and a draught of . The armed yacht had a maximum speed of and a complement of 5 officers and 35 ratings. The ship was armed with one QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun. For anti-submarine warfare, Otter was equipped with depth charges and asdic. Service history Constructed for Vincent Astor by Robert Jacob of City Island, New York as Nourmahal, the vessel was launched in 1921. Later in the 1920s he sold the vessel to John W. Hubbard who used the yacht for coastal cruises. The vessel was renamed Conseco. To augment the local sea defences of East Coast ports in World War II, the Royal Canadian Navy sought large, steel- hulled yachts to requisition. However, a significant lack of capable vessels were owned by Canadians. Canada turned to its southern neighbour for suitable ships, finding several that met the navy's requirements. However, US neutrality laws prevented their sale to belligerents in the war. In order to circumvent these laws, the Royal Canadian Navy requisitioned the yachts of prominent Canadian yachtsmen and then sent them to the US to purchase the yachts that had been identified by the navy without the US government knowing they were working for the navy. The money to acquire the vessels was provided by the Canadian government through bank loans. Philip S. Ross, a business executive from Montreal, Quebec was sent to acquire Conseco after his own yacht had been requisitioned. After acquiring the yacht, Ross has his own yacht returned, and Conseco arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia in late May 1940. After arriving at Halifax, the yacht was renamed Otter and sailed with fellow armed yacht to Quebec City, Quebec to undergo conversion to an armed yacht. Conversion to an armed yacht involved removing most of the luxurious finery and installing naval hardware. Otter required more than just the installation of armament though. The vessel's fresh water tanks were corroded and needed replacing and all the generating machinery was shot and needed replacement. Otter returned to Halifax after conversion on 2 October 1940 and was commissioned on 4 October. The ship was assigned to the Halifax Local Defence Force, alternating between training duties and anti-submarine patrols. The ship escorted convoys of merchant vessels from Halifax and Sydney, Nova Scotia to the meeting point with the ocean escorts for the transatlantic crossing. However, wiring issues arose early in Otters service. The ship suffered a fire while sailing for its conversion, caused by a short circuit. Then, while off Newfoundland Otter had a second fire in a heavy storm. The danger of fire was higher aboard Otter than other warships as the cabins aboard the vessel were constructed of wood, not steel. Then, on 26 March 1941, the ship was ordered to await the arrival of the submarine off the Sambro Light Vessel. Otter was to escort the submarine into Halifax Harbour. At 0830 while off the lightship, a fire broke out aboard Otter in the engine room. All the engine room personnel on duty died in the fire. The fire spread rapidly to the captain's cabin and the wireless office. The engines failed and with them the electric pumps for the firefighting equipment. To fight the fire, the crew used hand extinguishers and sand, which were inadequate. The captain ordered the magazine flooded and the code books destroyed. Once that was done, he gave the order to abandon ship. The crew faced waves. In the following evacuation, six members of the crew earned Mentioned in Dispatches for their conduct, including two posthumously. The surviving crew were in the water for two hours before rescue arrived. The Polish-flagged SS Wilsa and HMS Talisman picked up survivors. One lifeboat capsized in the heavy seas while approaching Wilsa, with only three of those onboard rescued. Two officers and seventeen ratings died in the incident.

The show examines and explains various aspects of video game design and is supposed to help viewers consider the design of games that they play and to encourage developers to improve their craft. There are also more focused stems of the series, discussing issues of accessibility in video games or level design. The first GMTK video was published in 2014. The series is hosted on a YouTube channel of the same name and it is funded by viewers via Patreon. Since 2017, Mark Brown also hosts an annual GMTK game jam on itch.io. Each jam has a different theme ‚Äì a design challenge ‚Äì and contestants have 48 hours to design and create a video game fitting that theme.  History  Before starting Game Maker's Toolkit, Mark Brown was a video game journalist. As a freelance writer he wrote for GamesRadar, Wired and The Escapist, among others. In 2010 and 2011 he was a contributor at Eurogamer and wrote video game reviews. Brown joined Pocket Gamer, a British publication about mobile games, in August 2012 as news editor and later as features editor. He left his position as editor- at-large in January 2017 to focus on Game Maker's Toolkit. Since then Brown has written occasionally as a freelancer, and he publishes game reviews on his Patreon page for supporters of Game Maker's Toolkit. Game Maker's Toolkits first episode, \\"Adaptive Soundtracks\\" was published in November 2014. Early episodes were released irregularly, every three to five weeks. Each video discusses a certain issue in video game design and its implementation in specific games. In 2016 and 2017 GMTK episodes became longer, often with over 10 min runtime, and they were published more frequently ‚Äì there was about three weeks between new videos. Since 2018 Brown has published on average two videos per month. Brown launched a crowdfunding profile on Patreon in 2015, enabling viewers to support GMTK with small amount of money every month. In December 2016 he announced that thanks to his backers on Patreon he would be quitting his job at Pocket Gamer and in 2017 he would start working full-time on Game Maker's Toolkit. In 2016 Brown started a new side-show on his YouTube channel, called Boss Keys. This series explores the layout and design of dungeons in The Legend of Zelda franchise. Each video covers a single game in The Legend of Zelda series. Brown developed a mapping system to describe layouts of the dungeons. In the second season of Boss Keys, which began in July 2018, Brown discusses the layout of game worlds in the metroidvania genre, such as those in the Metroid series. A second side-show on GMTK channel, Designing for Disability, launched in July 2018. This series explores accessibility in video games, describes obstacles which may prevent some people from enjoying specific games and presents guidelines and practices that make video games more welcoming for players with disabilities. In November 2019 he continued the series with a review of accessibility in games in 2019.  Reception  Brown's Game Maker's Toolkit videos were covered by video game websites, such as Gamasutra, Kotaku and Rock, Paper, Shotgun. Designing for Disability series is included in Polygons summary of \\"The best video essays of 2018\\" and its writer names Brown \\"one of the most measured and meticulous people\\" in video game criticism. The Telegraph mentions Brown as one of \\"20 gaming YouTubers you should be following\\", describing GMTK as \\"an intelligent look into the design philosophy behind popular games\\". An arts magazine Hyperallergic includes GMTK video \\"The Challenge of Cameras\\" in its roundup of web documentaries. Game Maker's Toolkit was also referenced by some video game developers.

They were keen and accurate observers of nature and developed various myths and legends, which reflected their knowledge of these systems. For example, the people of Mangaia in the Cook Islands had over 30 different names for the wind direction including Maoaketa, which indicated that a cyclonic storm existed to the west of the island. During the 1700s, Captain James Cook conducted three voyages within the Pacific Ocean and it is thought that he didn't collect any information about or experience any tropical cyclones. Europeans that followed Cook soon realised that the South Pacific was not free of hurricanes and were the first to publish accounts about the systems. During 1853, Thomas Dobson became the first person to collate information about these systems, in order to attempt to understand and explain the characteristics of 24 tropical cyclones. However, these descriptions were considered to be vague and of little value, because he only had a small amount of data and no synoptic weather charts. Over the next 40 years various reports, journals and log books on the storms were published before E Knipping consolidated these reports and extended Dobson's list out to 120 tropical cyclones during 1893. During the 1920s Stephen Sargent Visher did some research into tropical cyclones in the Pacific and visited several island nations; including Fiji, Japan and the Philippines to obtain information on potential systems. He also consulted various journals and reports as well as Dobson's and Knipping's work, before he authored a number of papers on tropical cyclones in the Pacific. These papers contained information about 259 tropical storms in the South Pacific between 160¬∞E and 140¬∞W, two of which occurred during 1789 and 1819, while the rest occurred between 1830 and 1923. Visher also tried to estimate how many systems were occurring on an annual basis in each area, but overcompensated for his incomplete records and came up with a figure of 12 severe tropical cyclones per year. During Visher's time and until the start of World War Two, there was insufficient information available to allow for an accurate deception of tropical cyclone tracks.

Creation In 2013, civil disobedience in protest against the reduction of fuel and gas subsidies during the government of Omar al-Bashir was dealt with by security forces with lethal force, killing 200 protestors and detaining another 200. In response, resistance committees were created groups of typically three to five friends, to organise small-scale civil disobedience activities. The committees developed a loose network during 2013‚Äì2016. In late 2016, the committees organised a 3-day civil disobedience campaign and doctors and pharmacists went on strike over medical costs and \\"the deteriorating medical environment\\". This motivated the resistance committees to better organise in 2017 at a national level and to develop their plans for actions. The resistance committees ran a graffiti campaign in 2017 and distributed 20,000 pamphlets regarding issues including water access and government land seizures. Structure By May 2019, the Sudanese resistance committees had an elected council at the national level and branches in \\"many towns\\" in Sudan. In July 2019, the overall structure remained a \\"fluid, decentralised network of activists\\" that was resistant against Sudanese intelligence agencies. The autonomy of local residential committees and coordination between geographically neighbouring areas were factors in the continued effectiveness of the committees during an Internet blackout that followed the 3 June Khartoum massacre. =Demographic profile= Individuals interviewed by the Middle East Eye argue that the resistance committees were popular among young Sudanese, who felt unrepresented by formal political opposition groups. The committees gave youth \\"the momentum and inspiration to be part of the revolution and to own their own fate and future.\\" 2018‚Äì19 Sudanese protests In December 2018, there were 30 active resistance committees in Khartoum. As the 2018‚Äì19 Sudanese protests began, inactive groups reactivated and rejoined the network. The network collected paper, tyres and spray cans for their civil disobedience actions. The Sudanese resistance committees signed the January 2019 Declaration of Freedom and Change Charter (FFC), which called for president Omar al-Bashir to be removed from power. During the protests, the resistance committees loosely coordinated with the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) via online social networking services, while retaining their autonomy. Middle East Eye described the resistance committees as having been \\"crucial to [the] success\\" of massive street protests held on 30 June 2019. The 30 June marches, the first major marches since the 3 June Khartoum massacre, aimed, as had many earlier protests, to again put pressure on the Transitional Military Council (TMC) to transfer power to a civilian authority. Earlier in June, the TMC attributed the resistance committees' blocking of roads as the responsibility of the FFC, and argued that the actions were \\"against the law and norms and [constituted] a full crime against the citizens of violating their freedoms and preventing them from practicing their normal life.\\" Some of the resistance committees were unsatisfied with the 5 July verbal deal agreed between the FFC and the TMC. Waleed Omar of one of the Omdurman resistance committees stated that the committees \\"[hadn't] been consulted and [hadn't] been represented\\". He said that the committees were preparing new protests. An Ayin media group political analyst interviewed by Middle East Eye described the resistance committees as \\"one of the main players in the political dynamics of Sudan after the revolution\\" and that the other key groups were \\"trying to avoid [the resistance committees'] radical positions towards the revolution.\\" =Assassinations= According to activists interviewed by Radio Dabanga, Ammar El Dirdeiri of a Fatah district resistance committee and three other leading members of resistance committees were deliberately killed by the Rapid Support Forces and the National Intelligence and Security Service during the 30 June 2019 protest marches.

Built as a Georgian Orthodox monastery in a hall church plan, it bears medieval frescoes and Georgian inscriptions. After the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, the Georgians lost access to the monastery. In 2015, the church building was subjected to maintenance works which infringed on authenticity and partially damaged the frescoes, leading to a controversy in Tskhinvali and protests from Georgia. The monastery is inscribed on the list of Georgia's Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance.  Architecture  The Tiri monastery is located near the village of Monasteri, in the valley of Tiri, a tributary of the Greater Liakhvi River, 9 km northwest of Tskhinvali. The monastery consists of the church of the Nativity of the Theotokos, a bell-tower, and the ruins of a refectory, rock-cut cells, a circuit wall, and other accessory structures. They are mostly built of dressed basalt blocks, with the additional use of brick and cobblestone. The church of the Nativity of the Theotokos, measuring 15.7 √ó 8.8 m., is dated to the latter half of the 13th century. It is built as a rectangular hall church with an apse of the sanctuary separated from the nave by a contemporaneous five-arched iconostasis, which has lost its original appearance and has then been somewhat haphazardly reassembled. The sanctuary bears the surviving fragments of the 14th‚Äì15th century frescoes. In the 1420s, the church was expanded with a now-ruined porch and an eukterion. The north annex, a crypt of the noble family of Tavkhelidze, was added in the 1480s. The fa√ßades are adorned with decorative stone carvings. A two-storey bell-tower was constructed adjacent to the west side of the church at the end of the 14th century by the Tavkhelidze, who owned the monastery. In the 16th century Tiri passed to the princes Taktakidze, who built a family crypt at the northeast end of the church in 1682. = Inscriptions = A 14th-century Georgian inscription on the bell-tower. Three stone inscriptions in Georgian survive on the outer walls of the monastery: two on the north and south annexes of the church, respectively, and one on the bell-tower. The latter inscription, undated but probably made at the end of the 14th century in the medieval Georgian asomtavruli script, is placed on an architrave stone on the east door of the bell-tower, mentioning members of the Tavkhelisdze family: Siaosh, Rati, Asat, and Machabel. The inscription on the west wall of the south annex, a small chapel, in asomtavruli and also undated, commemorates the certain treasurer Khela and Bevroz Makhatlishvili. The third text, dated to 1682 and is inscribed in the north crypt of the church in mkhedruli, attributes the structure to the members of the Taktakidze family: the bishop Phillip of Ruisi, Ardashel, and Elizbar. There is also a barely discernible two-line asomtavruli inscription in the interior of the eukterion, making mention of the bishop Phillip. A marble tombstone in front of the iconostasis carries a mkhedruli text, arranged in twelve lines, which indicates that buried here is Rostom (died 1689), a son of the prince royal Vakhtang of Kartli. Next to this tombstone was that of Erekle, son of Prince Giorgi Machabeli, who died fighting under the Georgian king Erekle II at Erivan in 1777. These epitaphs were first published by the French student of the Caucasian antiquities, Marie-F√©licit√© Brosset, in 1850.  History  Tiri Monastery. A photo from the book by Countess Uvarova, 1894. The Tiri monastery is mentioned in several Georgian historical documents from the 15th to the 18th century. Prince Vakhushti, a Georgian scholar writing about 1745, reports that west of the Achabeti fortress, \\"on a hill, there is the Tiri monastery, without a dome, but beautifully built, in a pleasant place. An abbot sits there.\\" After the Russian takeover of Georgia, the monastery was abolished and Tiri was converted to a parish church in 1811. During the August 2008 Russo-Georgian War, the area where the monastery is located fell under the control of Russian and South Ossetian forces. As a result, the Georgian clergy and parish lost access to the Tiri church. In the immediate aftermath of the hostilities, a 19 August 2008 UNOSAT satellite image reported no visible damage to the church. The convent continued to function intermittently until being dissolved in 2010. In July 2015, the Russian Sputnik agency reported that the monastery was subjected to a \\"repair\\" process in which part of the frescoes were whitewashed or damaged; the floor in the bell-tower was covered with concrete, and a new wall was built to encircle the church. The South Ossetian authorities claimed ignorance and ordered the works to be suspended. The damage incurred was also confirmed by Georgia's Ministry of Culture, which expressed concerns regarding \\"uncontrolled activities\\" at cultural monuments in breakaway Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In 2016, the Permanent Mission of Georgia to the United Nations Office reported to the UN Special Rapporteur in the Field of cultural rights that the Tiri Monastery required an immediate intervention in order to prevent further damage from humidity and water infiltration.

Summary  The book outlines the principles of the philosophy of effective altruism and details the history of humanity's moral progress over millennia. It then documents the current state of factory farming and the farmed animal movement that seeks to reform or abolish animal agriculture. The book then discusses various strategies that can be and are being utilized, such as cage-free egg campaigns, vegetarian activism, and innovative food technologies such as plant-based and cellular agriculture. It argues for a strategic focus on changing institutions instead of changing individuals, a focus on \\"trigger events\\", rhetoric that emphasizes how to eat animal-free food instead of why, utilizing stories before citing statistics about animal agriculture, and finally a selective use of confrontational activism. It ends by circling back to the expanding moral circle and arguing that advocates should engender a broad moral understanding rather than addressing moral issues one by one.  Reception  Coverage of the book was mostly positive, noting the provocative thesis of the book and the contemporary emergence of plant-based and cell-based food products. Some reviewers emphasized Reese's background growing up in Texas near cattle ranches, while noting the challenges of reaching a wide audience with a conventional vegan message. Molly Brown at GeekWire and Kelsey Piper at Vox emphasized the transition happening from the conventional \\"vegan diatribe\\" to approaches focused on mass consumer appeal and innovative food technology. The book was praised for its optimistic outlook despite the gravity of factory farming. The book faced criticism from Current Affairs due to its focus on effective altruism. Nathan J. Robinson wrote: > The End of Animal Farming is written from the \\"effective altruist\\" point of > view, and carries both that movement's best and worst tendencies.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. Production The design was built by Pearson Yachts in the United States between 1983 and 1986. The company completed more than 300 examples of the design, but it is now out of production. Design The Pearson 303 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass with a balsa core and with wood trim. It has a masthead sloop rig, a raked stem, a vertical transom, a skeg-mounted rudder controlled by a wheel, with an emergency back-up tiller and a fixed fin keel. It displaces and carries of lead ballast. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel fitted. It has of headroom, below decks. The boat is fitted with a Japanese Yanmar 3GM(F) diesel engine of . The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . The boat's galley is located on the port side of the cabin and includes a sink, a two-burner alcohol stove and a icebox. Hot and cold running pressure water was a factory option. The cabin sole is made from teak and holly. The head has a privacy door and is located forward, just aft of the bow \\"V\\"-berth. Additional sleeping space is provided by the dinette settee, which has a folding table and the aft quarter berth which is a double. The total sleeping accommodation is for six people. Ventilation is provided by eight opening cabin ports, plus two opening translucent hatches, one in the bow cabin and one in the main cabin. The boat has internal jiffy-reefing. The cockpit has two genoa winches and two winches for the halyards. The mainsheet traveler is mounted on the bridge deck and the genoa has sheet tracks. There is an anchor locker in the bow. Operational history A review in Practical Sailor magazine wrote of the design \\"A quick look at the numbers shows that the Pearson 303 is a conservative design, moderate in every respect ... They also suggest a boat that is not particularly fast ... Our conclusion is that the Pearson 303 is a big 30-footer, intended for safe coastal cruising. She admirably succeeds in doing what she was designed to do. The only risk accrues to those who mistake her for something she is not‚Äîan offshore, passage-making boat.\\" Practical Sailor however also faulted the design and its stablemates on company fortunes, saying, \\"the Pearson 303, and later the 34, 36, 37 and 39 seemed to be nearly the same boat drawn to different lengths. Indeed, in 1991, all of the above models, except the 303 (terminated in 1986), were in production at the same time. There was a bland sameness to them. Not only in terms of the standard hull and deck colors, non-skid pattern, window treatments and interior finish, but in their lines as well. One would suppose that designer Bill Shaw believed the formula to be successful, and for a time it probably was. Nevertheless, we suspect it also may have accounted for the company‚Äôs eventual demise ... It seems the company was consumed in a vortex spun of its own successful sameness.\\" David Liscio, writing in Sailing magazine in 2013 note, \\"Shaw, who was at the helm of Pearson Yachts as chief designer and corporate executive from 1964 to 1986, has been criticized for cranking out different models that look too much alike. Harsh tongues have lumped the Pearson 303 in with this group, but the 303, which Pearson labeled a performance cruiser, had found an audience of admirers ready and willing to accept a design that sacrifices a bit of speed and handling ability for additional space and comfort below deck.\\" Liscio concluded. \\"Solidly built, affordably priced and easy to sail, with voluminous space below decks, the Pearson 303 is an ideal coastal cruising boat for a small family or a big-boat sailor looking to downsize.\\" A 2017 used boat review in the Spinsheet, some 31 years after production ended, remarked, \\"following a design philosophy that dates back to the company‚Äôs founding in 1955, Pearson Yachts introduced the Pearson 303, in the 1983 model year as a no excuses, Plain Jane cruising boat. After almost 25 years, she remains just that.\\" The review concluded, \\"the Pearson 303 is today, as she was in 1983, an ideal boat for a couple or small family on a limited budget looking for a comfortable Bay or coastal cruiser.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *Alberg 30 *Alberg Odyssey 30 *Aloha 30 *Annie 30 *Bahama 30 *Bristol 29.9 *Cal 9.2 *C&C; 30 *C&C; 30 Redwing *Catalina 30 *Catalina 309 *CS 30 *Grampian 30 *Hunter 29.5 *Hunter 30 *Hunter 30T *Hunter 30-2 *Hunter 306 *Kirby 30 *Leigh 30 *Mirage 30 *Nonsuch 30 *O'Day 30 *Santana 30/30 *Seafarer 30 *Southern Cross 28 *Tanzer 31 References Category:Keelboats Category:1980s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts ","title":"Pearson 303"},{"id":"61449104","text":"Turn und Sportverein Haltern am See von 1882 e.V., commonly referred to as TuS Haltern, is a German association football club based in Haltern am See, North Rhine-Westphalia. It was the first station for several players and coaches of the Bundesliga. In addition to the football department, which represents about half of the 1,000 club members, there are also departments for athletics, mass sports, gymnastics, tennis, table tennis, surfing as well as a running club. Tennis and table tennis, like the football department, have competition teams. History The history of TuS Haltern is closely connected with the history of ATV Haltern and the Haltern firefighters. On 22 October 1882, the original association of all three was founded as Turner Feuerwehr Haltern e.V. (Turner Fire Brigade Haltern). The main focus after the foundation was gymnastics. In 1907 the football department was added, first as an informal group \\"Spiel und Sport Haltern\\", then in 1914 as the first permanent football club \\"Edelwei√ü\\". After World War I, various sports groups joined forces: football, athletics and gymnastics were the preferred sports. In 1930, a handball department was added. In 1937, the National Socialist League of the Reich for Physical Exercise merged all Haltern sports clubs under the name Turn- und Sportverein Haltern von 1882. Only in 1951 were they re-established as TuS, ATV and Freiwillige Feuerwehr. Between 1952 and 1956, the football department of the club played in the then third-tier Landesliga Westfalen. For a long time, the point of contention was the right to carry the designation \\"von 1882\\". These disputes were settled until 1982, so that all three clubs celebrated their hundredth anniversary together in the city centre of Haltern. Since 2008, TuS Haltern has been financially supported by its former player Christoph Metzelder. After a financial contribution to avert insolvency, a team of supporters was formed to improve the training conditions (sports field, coach education with DFB licences), to intensify public relations work (advertising campaign, networking via social media such as Facebook or Twitter) and to intensively support youth work. Germany's first advertising campaign by a district league club, \\"Tu's Haltern\\" (Do It Haltern), came in second in the 2010 Sports Marketing Prize. The Stauseekampfbahn got an artificial turf pitch in 2009. In 2016, TuS Haltern was promoted to the Westfalenliga, beating out BSV Roxel by goal difference. In October 2016, TuS Haltern started the campaign \\"Wahrer Fu√üball statt Ware Fu√üball\\" (True football instead of commodity football) to get more attention for amateur football. One year later, TuS was promoted to the Oberliga Westfalen and in 2019 was promoted to the Regionalliga West.

Prior to the release of Ultimate, he was ranked as the best player in the world at Super Smash Bros. for Wii U for the first half of 2018. His main character in Ultimate is Joker while his main character in Wii U was Marth. Career = Early life and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U= MkLeo won his first Smash Bros. tournament at the age of eight when he took first place at the Super Smash Bros. Brawl competition at Anime Expo Mexico TNT 2009. At 14, he rose to prominence in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U after defeating Ramin \\"Mr. R\\" Delshad to win Smash Factor 4, right after Delshad took 2nd place at Evo 2015. He began competing internationally in 2016, culminating with a win at 2GGT: ZeRo Saga in December. At that event, he defeated several of the game's prominent players, including Gonzalo \\"ZeRo\\" Barrios, Larry \\"Larry Lurr\\" Holland, and James \\"Void\\" Makekau-Tyson. Following the win at 2GGT, MkLeo was jointly signed by Echo Fox ‚Äì who signed him and six other fighting game players at the same time to build the largest roster of fighting game players in esports ‚Äì and Most Valuable Gaming. MkLeo, who was not able to obtain a travel visa to attend Genesis 3 at the start of 2016, announced after his win at 2GGT that he go on to win Genesis 4, which was to be held the next month. At Genesis 4, he again finished in 1st place, defeating Elliot \\"Ally\\" Carroza- Oyarce, who had won the Smash tournament at Evo 2016. He was the youngest player to make the top 8 in the tournament series' history. Playing alongside Ally, the pair also won the tournament's doubles competition. MkLeo had mixed results throughout the rest of 2017, with disappointing results including taking 13th place at Frostbite 2017 in February, and 65th place at Evo 2017 in July. However, he won GameTyrant Expo 2017 at the start of October, and took second place at CEO 2017, falling to ZeRo. At the end of the year, MkLeo won the 2GGC Championship, this time defeating ZeRo in the finals, and claimed the tournament's $20,000 first place payout. In January 2018, ZeRo announced his retirement from professional Smash competition. As ZeRo had long been considered the best Super Smash Bros. for Wii U player in the world, this created an opening for MkLeo to seize the top spot. He put together a string of impressive performances over the year, including wins at Genesis 5, Evo Japan 2018,, CEO 2018,, Get On My Level 2018, and SwitchFest 2018. MkLeo was unable to attend Evo 2018 due to Chickenpox, but was able to attend Super Smash Con 2018 shortly thereafter, where he claimed another 1st-place finish. These wins resulted in MkLeo taking the top spot in the final bi-annual Panda Global rankings of Wii U players before the release of Ultimate. In the five semi-annual Panda Global rankings released over the competitive lifespan of Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, MkLeo was ranked 19th,, 8th, 2nd,, and 4th before taking first place in the final ranking. The Panda Global Rankings 100, which listed the Top 100 Wii U players from the game's release through the release of Ultimate, placed MkLeo as the 3rd best player of all time behind ZeRo and Nairoby \\"Nairo\\" Quezada. The final Panda Global rankings for Super Smash Bros. for Wii U listed Marth as the main character that he played and Cloud Strife and Bayonetta as his secondary characters. = Super Smash Bros. Ultimate= Smash Ultimate was released in December 2018, and MkLeo had strong showings at several tournaments held shortly after the game's launch. He won one of the first Ultimate tournaments, Smash Conference United, then took fourth place at Glitch 6, both in the month of January. The following month, he won Genesis 6, considered the first premier tournament in Ultimate. The win was his third consecutive title at that tournament series and made him a front-runner for best player in the world at the new game. In the first half of 2019 he won three other major tournaments, MomoCon 2019, CEO 2019, and Smash 'N' Splash 5, and placed second in another, Frostbite 2019. His weakest performance in a premier tournament came at Umebura Major in Japan, where he placed 33rd; this was also the first tournament where he used Joker competitively. He also took fourth in another major, and took seventh in two others. This string of tournament wins against the scene's other top players earned MkLeo the top position in the inaugural Panda Global rankings for Ultimate. MkLeo opened the second half of 2019 with a second-place finish at Smash Factor 8, held in Mexico, falling to Tyler \\"Marss\\" Martins. Shortly after, MkLeo won Evo 2019, the largest tournament by number of entrants in the Smash Bros. franchise's history. After losing in the round of 16 to Takuto \\"Kameme\\" Ono, MkLeo defeated a number of other elite players and reached the tournament's grand finals, where he defeated Gavin \\"Tweek\\" Dempsey twice ‚Äì first to \\"reset the bracket\\" (cancel out that MkLeo had already lost a set in the tournament and Tweek had not), and then to win the tournament, and with it a grand prize of over $21,000. In addition to Evo, he won two other premier tournaments ‚Äì Super Smash Con 2019 and 2GG: Kongo Saga. He placed second in two other premier tournaments ‚Äì Shine 2019 and Mainstage 2019. His high placings in these events secured him a second term as the best Ultimate player in the world in the bi- annual Panda Global rankings. In January 2020, MkLeo placed second at Genesis 7, again falling to Marss, who deprived MkLeo of a fourth straight Genesis title. On February 21, just prior to Frostbite 2020, he announced on Twitter that he had departed Echo Fox. The organization had dissolved in late 2019, and MkLeo and fighting game player SonicFox were the last two players on their roster. At Frostbite, after falling to Pedro \\"Prodigy\\" Alonso in the round of 96, MkLeo won the next 11 straight sets, defeating the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 9th, and 12th best players in the Panda Global rankings during his run. A few days after the tournament, multi-esport organization T1 announced that they had signed him. As of the second half of 2019, MKLeo was listed in the Panda Global rankings as using Joker as his main character and Ike, Lucina, and Wolf O'Donnell as secondary characters. At Frostbite 2020, he played part of the grand finals match with Byleth, who had been released as a playable character in Ultimate only weeks earlier. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the tournaments scheduled for the first half of 2020 were cancelled or moved online. Ultimates online service suffers from noticeable input delay and lag, and many top players ‚Äì including MkLeo ‚Äì had poorer than normal performances in online tournaments. At the end of April, MkLeo tied for 17th at Pound Online. Weeks later he tied for 33rd out of 8,192 participants at the Hungrybox-organized The Box tournament.

In it, the player plays as a detective frog, named \\"Frog Detective\\". A sequel entitled Frog Detective 2: The Case of the Invisible Wizard was released on December 9, 2019. Plot The Haunted Island begins with Frog Detective getting a call from their supervisor, who informs them that a ghost has been heard on the island. Frog Detective grabs their magnifying glass and goes to the island, where they meet several people, including Martin, the owner of the island who first heard the ghost, and Larry, who insists he is not the ghost. Larry then informs Frog Detective that the ghost noises are coming from the cave nearby. Martin also informs Frog Detective that he is planning a dance party the next day with his friend Finley, who lives off the island. However, an explosive device is needed to enter the cave. Frog Detective begins collecting the items needed to create an explosive device from the residents of the island. After collecting all the needed materials, Frog Detective is able to enter the cave. Inside, Frog Detective finds Finley, practicing dancing. It turns out that the ghostly noises were coming from Finley's radio. Finley and Frog Detective leave the cave and talk to Martin, and they all agree that books should never be trusted. Finley, Frog Detective and Martin then decide to move the contest from the next day to the current day. All the residents of the island then dance and the player is able to choose the winner.  Gameplay  Some of the characters found in The Haunted Island The Haunted Island's gameplay revolves around collecting the ingredients needed for an explosive device, to see if a ghost is inside a cave. Frog Detective is able to converse with several characters, such as the scientists Fresh X and MysteryMonkey.  Development  The Haunted Island took around five months to develop. Grace Bruxner aimed to subvert the detective genre as she created the game, which she had felt had become largely dominated by media such as Agatha Christie's Poirot and L.A. Noire. She also did research into the cinematography and camera angles of the detective genre to use in The Haunted Island, as she felt that the camera angles used in those pieces of media are extremely serious as compared to The Haunted Island, and using them would create comedy due to the mismatch in tone. Additionally, she tried to avoid writing characters that relied on offensive stereotypes. Bruxner claims that she made around 7,000 dollars from the game on its first month on the market. After the game was released, Superhot, the company that created the eponymous Superhot, a first-person shooter video game, gave funding to developer Grace Bruxner for use in developing this game's sequel, Frog Detective 2: The Case of the Invisible Wizard. Superhot said that the funding constituted the \\"crossover no one asked for\\". Reception The game received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews according to Metacritic. Destructoids Kevin Mersereau called it \\"pretty gosh darn rad.\\" The game's humor was praised by critics. Kotakus Cameron Kunzelman called it \\"really, really funny\\", comparing it to a Wes Anderson film. Vices Danielle Riendeau favorably compared it to Donut County, which they said is \\"another game that is really funny without trying too hard.\\" Mersereau praised the games graphics, saying that it is \\"suitably goofy\\", and \\"gels wonderfully with the whole aesthetic.\\" The Haunted Island was nominated for best student game at the Independent Games Festival.

History  In the 6th and 7th centuries, the episcopal chair already existed in the territory of the church. In the list of episcopal departments from 602 to 610, the Tzayish eparchy in Lazika is mentioned. The oldest Georgian monument, mentioned by the Bishopric of Tsasha, is an inscription on a stone cross from the 10th-11th centuries, where Bishop Ephraim of Tsaishsky is mentioned next to the name of King Bagrat.Bishop of Tsaishi, Abesalom Tughushi, Publishing House \\"Ornati\\", Zugdidi, 2001, p. 36. A modern domed temple was built between the 13th and 14th centuries. It is known that from the 11th century to 1823 the diocese belonged to 20 bishops, among which the most important were Gurieli Malaqu√≠as (1612 - 1639) and Grigol Chikovani (1777 - 1823). Bishop Malachi is known for having completely restored and renovated the Tsaishi church after the devastating earthquake of 1614, while Bishop Grigol is known for having managed to count on the support of Katsii III Dadiani and return the lands taken by the feudal lords to church. In addition, he built a wall and a bell tower around the church. In 1823, the Russian government abolished the bishop of Tsaishi and other bishoprics of Murel. From then until 1879 there was a monastery. The monastery was one of the main places for the dissemination of education since it had a school. With the arrival of the Bolsheviks in Georgia, the monastery was closed and abandoned. In 1989, with the blessing of Catholics Patriarch of Georgia Elijah II, the monastery was restored. From 1989 until his death, deacon Amiran Shengelia, who was buried near the south gate, was in charge of the temple.

Although he was active in the Pop art movement through his participation in Torcuato di Tella Institute, Santanton√≠n's personal artwork was based more on conceptual and abstract idealism. His artworks tended to involve mixed media that would challenge the viewer's relationship with objects and materials.  Career  Born in 1919, Santanton√≠n did not have any formal art education or training, but was largely self-taught. Indeed, he was largely unknown in the art world until 1943 when he entered the artistic world from the sidelines. Then, during one of his first exhibitions, at the Van Riel Gallery in 1960, he was ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù by two Avant-garde artists of the time, Luis Felipe No√© and Kenneth Kemble. Santanton√≠n worked hard to create new and sensual artworks, and while working towards this through his new ideas, he created an immense future for himself. He wanted his creations to fuel the collective power of a transformation movement he imagined was possible during his time and the scope of his radicalism conveyed in his brief writings detailed that at the moment, it was a perfect opportunity to stand up for ‚Äúunstable art‚Äù. During the middle of his career, Santanton√≠n‚Äôs work had an immediate impact through his representation of Argentina in his own exhibitions, such as the Lirolay Gallery in 1961 and 1941, as well as at exhibitions L‚ÄôArt Argentin Actuel (Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne, Paris, 1963), New art of Argentina (Walker Art Center, Minneaopolis, 1964), and at the VII Sao Paulo in which he participated in.  Arte-cosa  While Santanton√≠n did not go to school or have any formal training, he eventually made a name for himself through his creation of a unique mode of art making, which he called \\"Arte-cosa\\" (or \\"Art-thing\\"). This mode was developed in an environment saturated with Informalism and Destructive Art. Constructed out of cardboard, paper, rags, canvas, wire, plaster, and other various materials, the Cosas (or Things) were one of Santanton√≠n's most memorable art pieces. Through these pieces, Santanton√≠n hoped to express what he called an ‚Äúexistential crossroads‚Äù by creating fragile pieces that could not stand the test of time and indifference. Instead of giving every piece an individual name, he categorized them under a single title, thus avoiding placing his sculptures in the realm of objectivity. By doing this, Santanton√≠n hoped his audience would immerse themselves in these ‚Äúthings‚Äù with their own pleasure, distress and imagination. The \\"things\\" would provide a sensorial experience that could draw on self-destructive feelings, and prevent any contemplation of meaning or purpose. So Santanton√≠n's investment in Existentialism led him to created art that explored the essential aspects of human existence, including the role of sensory perception and human thought processes. In this way, Santanton√≠n distanced himself from traditional disciplines of art by focusing on ambiguous forms that possessed an existential intensity. Through this, he hoped to introduce a new level of experience in the cultural life of Buenos Aires.  La Menesunda  In 1965, he collaborated with Marta Minuj√≠n to create an installation called La Menesunda (Mayhem), . While Minujin and Santanton√≠n were unlikely partners due to their generational gap, these two artists became close from the beginning based on their mutual interests in popular culture and Kitsch. When it came to planning La Menesunda, the two came up with their ideas on their first meetings, and quickly followed out their plan by gathering participants such as David Lamelas. During the early stages of this project, Santanton√≠n and Minujin planned lists of various installments such swamp floors, a room full of objects that the spectator had to throw away in order to pass through, a room full of placards, changes of temperatures, and other outlandish proposals that revealed the artists collective imagination and focus on the senses of participants. This was a natural project for him to be a part of, considering his ideas to focus on sensual and visual experiences. Visitors in groups of eight followed a series of neon lights thought through sixteen chambers. In each they encountered a different multi-sensory experience, including couples in bed, a cosmetics counter with an attendant, and a room covered with mirrors with falling confetti and the scent of frying food.  Later career and death  However, while his name is credited to this exhibition, the reaction of the press attributed sole authorship of La Menesunda to Minujin, provoking him into an existential crisis. Due to this, Santanton√≠n ended his career as an artist by closing his ‚Äúpainter-construction‚Äù phase. Shortly before his untimely death in April 1969, Santanton√≠n lit a bonfire and burned almost all of his Arte-cosas artwork. This act of destruction has been interpreted as a gesture of despair prompted by his disappointment at the media‚Äôs reaction in his artistic work. Although at the time Santanton√≠n felt like he had failed as an artist, this could be seen as a punishment through which he felt like society was not worth viewing his artwork in the future. Presently, because there are few remaining pieces, collectors, members of the art market, and various Latin institutions are searching in vain for what is left behind or hidden. As for now, there are less than ten pieces known to be left behind, and it is uncertain if any more than this number remain.

Jewel is also the term used by the Municipality of Vicenza and the Diocese of Vicenza. See also Barbieri, Cevese, 2004 and Barbieri, 1973. of the city of Vicenza made as an ex-voto in the 16th century and attributed to the architect Andrea Palladio. The Jewel was stolen by the Napoleonic army during the Italian Campaign in the French Revolutionary Wars and subsequently destroyed. A copy was created between 2012 and 2013. History The precious Jewel was made of silver plates on a wood frame. It was completed in 1578. It's not certain that Andrea Palladio created the model, but the bond between two Bishops of Vicenza (Niccol√≤ Ridolfi and his successor Matteo Priuli) suggests that Palladio's role as director of city life was more important than his role as architect. For him, the Jewel might have represented his mental conception of the city of Vicenza. It can possibly be attributed to a goldsmith of the Capobianco family, as is supported by a document found in 2012 in the \\"Sanctuary of the Madonna\\" of Monte Berico. The citizens offered the Jewel as an ex-voto to the \\"Madonna of Mount Berico\\" in order to avoid the Plague of Saint Charles Borromeo that had spread two years before in the Duchy of Milan with some infection cases in the western cities of the Republic of Venice and up to Verona. Despite poor conditions, the citizenship united and provided a modest gift from each family. Vicenza was spared (until the great Italian plague of 1629‚Äì31), so the Jewel was initially displayed in the church of Monte Berico next to the \\"Santuario della Madonna di Monte Berico\\". Between the 17th and the 18th century, six oil paintings were made that represented the first patron saint of the city, Saint Vincent, holding the silver Jewel in his hands. The paintings that portray Saint Vincent holding the precious model are the main evidence we have of the model's appearance. The paintings show the Jewel from different points of view, which provides information about its three-dimensional form. The model is a main element in each of the pictures; Vicenza is seen from the front, offered by Saint Vincent, and enclosed in its medieval walls. In that period, the distinction between the borghi (boroughs) over the walls and the inner part of the city, nowadays the Old Town of Vicenza, already existed. Under the Napoleonic government, the French troops looted Vicenza of cultural artifacts in 1797, as they did throughout most of Italy. The arm√©e fran√ßaise, having seized the Sanctuary, brought the Jewel of Vicenza back to France because they thought it was completely made out of silver. They attempted to melt the model down, but it burned instead, as it was made of wood and only covered by a silver coating. With its destruction, Vicenza lost an important artifact from its century-long history of goldsmithing.  Reconstruction  In May 2010, a Committee for the Jewel of Vicenza was founded with the support of the Office of Cultural Heritage and other local institutions. The committee held a competition for a virtual restoration of the Jewel. The competition was won by the architect Romano Concato from Trissino, who compensated for the absence of original drawings by studying two paintings by Francesco Maffei and two others by Alessandro Maganza. The reconstruction was also developed by referencing medieval planimetrics of the city, the Pianta Angelica, designed by Giovanni Pittoni in 1580. In 2011, the Committee began the second part of its project‚Äîa collection of silver donations in order to recreate the model for Vicenza, as happened for the ancient ex-voto. The collection had 66 lbs (30 kgs) as its minimum target. In 2012, more than 110 lbs (50 kgs) of silver were collected (enough for the project), but ten of the most important goldsmiths of the city went on collecting until 25 December, to create additional funds for the reconstruction and its display. = Features = The church of San Lorenzo, the first building completed in the reconstruction The new Jewel of Vicenza is a large round silver tray with a diameter of 58 cm that supports more than 300 models of Vicenza buildings. Sixty-one of the models represent buildings of historical importance, such as the Basilica Palladiana, the Cathedral, the Torre Bissara, and dozens of churches. In the center of Piazza dei Signori, a gold model of the Rua was added, unannounced. The reconstruction of the Jewel was designed by proportioning the models using the golden ratio and studying the size of buildings from the time of its original construction so the three- dimensional reconstruction could be as close to the original as possible.(Part of the original description) The reconstruction started with small sculptures in modelled wax that served as a model for subsequent casting. The cast elements were then finished and embellished with chiseling and engraving. The model is made of 925/1000 silver. The final weight was 33 lbs (15 kg); and the total effort took around 2,000 hours of work. = Presentation = On 15 June 2012 in Piazza dei Signori an official presentation on the reconstruction was held. Afterwards, the work began, combining the craftsmanship of silversmith Carlo Rossi and the sophisticated laser technology offered by a company in Bressanvido. In September 2012, at the Gallerie di Palazzo Leoni Montanari the finished tray was presented with its first complete building, the Church of San Lorenzo. From 6 April to 9 June 2013, halfway through the reconstruction, the Jewel was exhibited at the Diocesan Museum with the support of FAI. In the summer of 2013 the Jewel was completed; it was returned to the citizens for the town's patronal feast on 7 September. The reconstruction was included in the usual procession to the Basilica of St. Mary of Mount Berico in an official ceremony that had 30,000 participants. The Jewel is now permanently housed at the Diocesan Museum and placed next to the painting by Maffei, San Vincenzo with the model of the city of Vicenza. In 2015, the Jewel was exhibited at Expo 2015 in Milan. At the exhibition, silversmith Carlo Rossi was awarded the Confartigianato Design Award 2015 for his creation of the reconstruction.

Throughout her career, she won 9- awards for her work and was designated a Master Artist by the Five Civilized Tribes Museum in 1976. Her artworks are in collections of the Heard Museum of Phoenix, Arizona; the Philbrook Museum of Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma; the Southern Plains Indian Museum in Anadarko, Oklahoma; and the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian of Santa Fe, New Mexico, among others. Early life Valjean McCarty was born on August 30, 1934, in Tulsa, Oklahoma to Madelyn Helen (n√©e Beck) and Vernon Clay McCarty. Her family were members of the Choctaw Nation and she was the oldest of four siblings, Carol Jean \\"Jane\\", Patrick, and Judy Louise. Her father was a plumber and an honorary tribal leader. Because he often had to travel for work, given that in-door plumbing was still uncommon, Valjean was raised in Tulsa in the home of her maternal grandparents, Sada and Fred Beck, who were of Welch ancestry. Her paternal grandparents, were Etta Regina (n√©e Davis), who was Choctaw and Carl McCarty. In grade school, McCarty wanted to become an artist, but when her father asked a local well-known artist where she and Jane could study painting, he was told that women could not be painters. Undaunted, when she won a scholarship at age 11 to attend weekend educational programs at the Philbrook Art Center, she accepted and studied art history, dancing, painting and pottery. From 1945, she participated in art shows at Philbrook, winning numerous local, state and national prizes for her artwork. After graduating from Tulsa Central High School in 1952, she won three college scholarships and chose to attend Mary Hardin‚ÄìBaylor College in Belton, Texas. While she was at Baylor, she met Robert C. Hessing, a veteran of the Korean War and mathematician. The couple married in 1954. That year, she returned to Tulsa to study at the University of Tulsa under the tutelage of Alexandre Hogue. Completing her studies in 1955, McCarty took several years off to raise her children, Robert Bart, Jane Ann, Lauri Lynn, and Bradly Lewis, though she continued her study of art and in 1962, taught herself the Bacone flatstyle of painting. Career Hessing is most known for her narrative history paintings in gouache using earth tones on a white background in the two-dimensional perspective of Flatstyle, a Native painting movement widespread in the 20th century. To give the appearance of depth, fine lines were added, as shading was not permitted. Though the flat-style was typically associated with previous generations of Native painters and Hessing was often discouraged by men who believed women should not paint, Hessing felt that it was important to keep the tradition alive. To make the work accurate, Native artists were required to do research to accurately portray the story of a custom or historic event meticulously reproducing garments, motifs, and themes. She sought to capture the wide spectrum of complexions among people and typically painted scenes of Choctaw daily life or focused on historic images and legends of her people. In 1962, Hessing returned to painting and began entering art exhibits like the Scottsdale National Indian Art Exhibition (1962) in Arizona, the U.S. Department of Interior Art exhibition (1964) in Washington, DC, the Tulsa Council of Indians Exhibition (1965), and the Second Annual Invitational Exhibition of American Indian Paintings (1965) in Washington, DC. In 1966 at the Philbrook Indian Annual, Hessing placed second, behind Joan Hill (Muscogee Creek/Cherokee, 1930‚Äì2020), the first woman designated as a \\"Master Artist\\" by the Five Civilized Tribes Museum. In 1971, Hessing won first prize for painting in the Scottsdale Exhibition's 10th Annual and the following year was the Choctaw Heritage Award winner at the Five Civilized Tribes Museum in Muskogee, Oklahoma. She often exhibited her works with her sister Jane, the Heard Museum of Phoenix produced an exhibition featuring the two women in 1972. The following year, the Philbrook selected Hessing's work for a solo exhibition. In 1973, when her husband was appointed as director of research and development at Amoco, the family relocated to Naperville, Illinois. In 1976, Hessing earned the distinction of \\"Master Artist\\" from the Five Civilized Tribes Museum. The designation is the highest honor bestowed by the museum and through 2008 only 35 artists had earned the distinction. Among her contemporaries, who had earned the distinction at the time of her recognition were Troy Anderson (Cherokee of Northeastern Alabama), Bob Bell (Choctaw Nation), Enoch Kelly Haney (Seminole/Muscogee Creek), Joan Hill (Muscogee Creek/Cherokee), Saint Clair Homer II (Choctaw Nation), Bert Seabourn, Jason Stone, and Willard Stone. In 1978, Hessing was honored by the Heard Museum with the Popovi Da Memorial and won the Pierce-Avery Memorial Award for her work Removal to Indian Territory. She won the Pierce-Avery Memorial Award a second time in 1980 and that year had a solo exhibit in Washington, DC, at Via Gambaro Gallery. Hessing was one of the featured artists who exhibited in 1983 at the Mary B. Rogers Gallery of the Millicent Rogers Museum in Taos, New Mexico. The following year, her family returned to Tulsa, when her husband was appointed to head Amoco's Computing Research Division. In 1985, she participated along with her sister Jane and Mary Adair (Cherokee Nation), Jean Bales (Iowa), Joan Brown, Sharron Ahtone Harjo (Kiowa), Ruthe Blalock Jones (Shawnee/Peoria), and Virginia Stroud (Keetoowah Band Cherokee/Muscogee Creek) in the Daughters of the Earth exhibition which traveled for three years (1985‚Äì1988), touring in the United States and Europe. Throughout her career, she won 90 honors for her paintings, which included nine grand awards. Death and legacy When Hessing's husband retired in the early 1990s, the couple moved to Onarga, Illinois. There she died on October 7, 2006. The U.S. Department of the Interior has preserved her works in two collections ‚Äî Amerindian Circle and Indian Arts and Crafts Board, both located in Washington, DC. She also has works in the permanent collections of the Heard Museum of Phoenix; the Philbrook Museum in Tulsa; the Southeast Missouri State University Museum at Cape Girardeau, Missouri; the Southern Plains Indian Museum in Anadarko, Oklahoma; and the Wheelwright Museum in Santa Fe, as well as in private collections. In 2008, the Institute of American Indian Arts hosted a retrospective of her works, Valjean McCarty Hessing Honored, and her painting The Black Hat was featured on the cover of The Santa Fe New Mexican's issue of February 1, 2008. In 2012, her work Some Died along the Way (1969) was one of the pieces exhibited from the James T. Bialac Native American Art Collection acquired by the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art in Norman, Oklahoma. In 2019, she was among the women artists featured in the Five Civilized Tribes Museum's Women of the Five Civilized Tribes Exhibit.

Its period has been observed to be decreasing, due to the emission of gravitational waves. It is both an eclipsing binary and a double-lined spectroscopic binary. The hotter white dwarf is , and the other one is significantly cooler (<10,000K). The stars may merge into one in 130,000 years, or if mass transfers between them, they may separate again. Their distance from Earth is estimated at . Stars The brighter star has an effective temperature of , a logarithm of surface gravity of 7.75, and a mass 0.6 times the Sun. Its radius is 0.0156 that of the Sun. The dimmer star is cooler, with a temperature of under , and has a mass 0.21 that of the Sun. It is physically larger than the brighter star at 0.0314 the radius of the Sun. Name ZTF stands for Zwicky Transient Facility. This is a survey of the whole northern sky recording light curves that uses Samuel Oschin Telescope at Palomar Observatory. Eclipse The light curve shows eclipses. One dip in the light curve is 15%, and the other is close to 100%. This means that one star is much brighter than the other. The light curve is not flat between eclipses, as the bright star is lighting up the face of the dim star. Orbital decay The orbital period is decreasing at seconds per second giving a characteristic timescale of 210,000 years. This decay is mostly due to the emission of gravitational waves, however 7% of the decay could be due to tidal losses. The decay is predicted to go for 130,000 years when the orbital period should reach 5 minutes. Then the dimmer star is predicted to expand and lose mass to the more massive star. It could then become an AM CVn system or merge to make a R Coronae Borealis star. The orbit compares with V407 Vulpeculae with a 9.5 minute orbit, and HM Cancri with 5.4 minute orbit. Star composition The hot star is a hydrogen-rich white dwarf of type DA. It has wide and shallow absorption lines of hydrogen. The dim star has narrow hydrogen emission lines, showing it is cooler. There are also helium absorption and emission lines. The two kinds of lines vary over the period, so that they can be identified with the two components. The emission lines are likely due to excess heating of the dim star by the bright one.

His best known artwork is a series called Vivo Dito in which Greco draws attention to objects and people as living art pieces within everyday life.  Biography  Alberto Greco was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1931. He was part of a family of five; his older brother, Jorge Julio, was eight years his senior, and his brother Edgardo was younger than him by four years. His mother was Ana Victoria Disolina Ferraris and his father was Francisco Jos√©. Greco never married and neither did he leave traces of a significant other in his life despite having friends. This gave him the freedom to do what he wanted without the burden of a partner, allowing him to travel freely. Alberto Greco was a student of Tom√°s Maldonado and attended many workshops put on by Cecilia Marcouch. Greco also attended the School of Fine Arts but dropped out. Throughout his time as an artist, he also worked and lived with many different artists. Greco not only influenced others but was also influenced by other artists.  Career  Alberto Greco not only considered himself the greatest informalist of his time, but acted as if he was. Informalism branched off from expressionism. Informal art explored possibilities of gestures and materialism that was typically non-traditional, and signage as the basis of communication. Informalism is creating artwork or signs, then giving them meaning afterwards. This focused on giving the viewer the freedom to think for themselves and decide what they see. Greco only desired a handful of things, such as validation, glory, and fame, and tried getting them through a variety of ways. Due to his eagerness to be famous and his rebellious ways, Greco would often get himself invited into places to later on not show up. Soon after this period, Greco's name began to be associated with the idea of scandal and imposture. To this Greco responded, \\"I am so serious a painter that I have no need to assume the appearance of one.\\" Alberto Greco was obsessed with the idea of growth and, through that, he believed that the \\"will to grow was the will to erase prejudice\\". Because of Greco's response to people's words and his ways of excluding prejudice, he became a symbol of the liberating angel to the marginalized. This is one of the reasons many consider him a leader. Instead of supporting public criticism, often artists would defend his work and his name. Alberto Greco created an outstanding amount of manifestos and these are just a few of them. Greco created many different manifestos during his Vito Dito series such as his \\"Gran Manifiesto-Rollo Arte Vito Dito\\". Alberto Greco created a manifesto titled \\"Grand vito-dito Anti Manifiesto\\". Vito Dito =Origins of Vito Dito and Personal life= Alberto Greco had an interesting relationship with himself. He often was overwhelmed by his being and through this aspired to break away from his identity. Greco would often beat himself up over the idea of becoming famous and pushed himself to exceed his own expectations. Simultaneously, he would glorify himself by hanging posters around cities he frequented, which said things like \\"Greco how great you are\\" and \\"Greco, America's greatest informalist painter.\\" He often tied himself up with the idea of hope and corruption. Hope, for it gave him the will to be rebellious, and corruption because it nourished the idea of rebellion. Despite this, Greco would put himself above the general codes of morality and considered himself a moralist. Like an unbalanced scale, he would often go from smoking cigarettes on the street to being waited on by maids in odd environments such as parks or gardens. Greco was also fascinated with quotidian reality; this is the idea of belonging to each day. With this fascination, Greco began to create the Vito Dito project. =Vito Dito project= Vito Dito means \\"living finger.\\" This was a series Greco created in 1962 to emphasize the idea of living in the now. For this project, Greco would walk around a town and sign objects, people, or animals. Greco once wrote a manifesto on a scroll and strung it around the town, calling it \\"Gran Manifiesto- Rollo Arte Vito Dito\\". He would also draw circles on the ground and sign his name outside the circle. It is believed that Greco once drew a circle around a man and would not let him out of it. He left the art in its place because he believed \\"once that object is found, it lives in its place, it does not transform it or carry it off to an art gallery.\\" Vito Dito was not a trend but instead a living piece of Greco. The point of this was to redefine art because he lived as a rebel against all formalizing and institutionalizing tendencies of art. Greco believed that art is an act of discovery and a process of looking. Through this project, he aimed to teach people to see the beauty of everyday objects. Greco created this series because he believed that people should not create art and then go back and re-decorate it. Greco often compared a finished project to a dead object; when something dies you do not go to its grave and dig it up to change its appearance or add to it, you simply let it rest, as you should to your artwork. Greco often wrote \\"live art seeks its object\\"; this is the reason he went out and pursued objects to sign because art is all around us. This allowed Greco to create a canvas anywhere and everywhere instead of limiting the idea of canvas to something that could have a measurement. Greco created many different paintings during his Vito Dito series such as these. Exhibitions and Artworks =First Live Art Exhibit= One of Greco's first exhibits that showed live art was in Paris in 1962. This exhibition belonged to Pablo Curatella Manes and Germein Derbecq and showcased other artists as well as Greco. His piece was called \\"30 Mice From Neo-Figuration\\". This artwork included 30 mice inside a glass box, in which the insides were painted black. Greco's piece was taken out of the exhibition because the mice began to reek. After being kicked out, Greco took the mice to a hotel and fed them bread; he later debated showing the eaten pieces of bread as his artwork. Not too long afterward, Greco was kicked out of the hotel because of the smell of the mice. =Sin Titulo Series= Greco not only created art such as the Vito Dito series, but had many different forms he involved himself in. Some of his art had political influences, such as his piece about President Kennedy's assassination during Greco's \\"Sin Titulo Series\\". \\"Sin Titulo\\" translates to \\"without a title\\" from Spanish. For examples, follow these links: Sin Titulo , Sin Titulo, Sin Titulo, Sin Titulo, Sin Titulo, Sin Titulo. =Other Artworks= Here are some of the many different paintings Greco created during his time. Greco also had the opportunity to present some of his artwork before the President of Italy in 1963. He here performed a political piece that included rats and was titled \\"Christ 63\\". This, however, did not go the right way because Greco ended up being kicked out of Italy because he released rats in front of the President. =Other forms of art= Greco also immersed himself in different forms of art and created poetry as well as jewellery. He published his first poetry book in 1950. Death Alberto Greco committed suicide on October 14, 1965, a few months after his 35th birthday. Greco planned his death in the early months of 1965, deciding that his suicide would be his last piece as a means of social commentary and an art performance. Grecos cause of death was an overdose of barbiturates. Barbiturates are a type of antidepressant prescribed for sleeping disorders. This type of drug is meant to repress the activity of the central nervous system reducing anxiety, but impairing memory and judgment at the same time. The purpose of this was to illustrate to the world that he was one of the best informalist artists in the world. Greco emphasized the importance of big gestures and overdramatized performances; in his mind, that was the only way to convey his ideas. This is why he decided to make the performance of his death a big one. Before committing suicide, Greco called his family to let them know this was happening and invited them to watch; his family declined the offer. While dying, Greco wrote down all of the feelings he was experiencing while on barbiturates. Before losing feeling in his body he wrote the word \\"Fin\\" on his left hand; fin meaning \\"end\\". Legacy Alberto Greco was an amazing artist who needs to be continually recognized. Not only did Greco create the Vito Dito series which emphasizes recognizing the everyday and now, he also had a dramatic influence on the creation of conceptual art. Greco also wrote poems, manifestos, and created jewellery. Through his rebellious and unique ways, Greco had diversified art during his time and even now. Greco is a legend that is often misunderstood because of his sometimes dark and confusing mindset. This underrated artist needs his name to be remembered by everyone for his undeniable influence. Greco must be remembered because if not it would be simply disrespectful.

The victims were mainly members of ethnic minority groups from southwestern Ethiopia, chiefly the Dorze, but also Gamos, Wolayitas, Gurages, and Silt'es. Background Since 2016, Ethiopia had been gripped by repeated waves of unrest and protest against the ruling Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Democratic Front, despite the EPRDF's victory in 2015 general elections (in which it and its allies won all seats in the lower house of parliament), which were not considered credible by international observers. These protests displayed a considerable degree of inter-ethnic solidarity. Prime Minister Hailemariam Dessalegn, has been seen by the political elite as weak and lacking in leadership and has led the country since 2012, also stepped down as chairman of the ruling coalition in April 2018 and was replaced by Abiy Ahmed to meet the demands of Oromo protesters who have accused the authorities of marginalization. Most of the unrest has centred on Ethiopia's two largest regions, Oromia and Amhara. Abiy swiftly promised to implement a sweeping series of political and economic reforms, and ended the state of emergency that had been in place since October 2016. As part of this political opening, political prisoners were pardoned and opposition movements permitted to resume operating in the country.Prime Minister broached the possibility of bringing Andargachew's Ginbot 7 into the political fold. On the same day Andargachew walked free, his colleague and Patriotic Ginbot 7 Movement for Unity and Democracychairman leader Berhanu Nega, had all charges against him dropped. =OLF rally= The OLF and two other organizations were removed from a list of terror groups earlier this year after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office. He invited them to come home as he vowed to widen the political space in a country where the ruling coalition, in power since 1991, and affiliated parties hold every seat in parliament. Earlier Saturday, some 1,500 OLF fighters returned to Ethiopia from neighboring Eritrea. The group since the 1970s has advocated the \\"right to national self-determination\\" for the Oromo people, Ethiopia's largest ethnic group. A large concert was held in Meskel Square in the capital, Addis Ababa, to welcome OLF leader Dawud Ibsa and others arriving from Eritrea's capital. Events also were held in Oromia, the largest region among Ethiopia's federal states. The capital Addis Ababa, that welcomed the return of Patriotic Ginbot 7 along with Several armed groups have returned home on Sunday was adorned with the Ethiopian tricolor of green, yellow and red. However, In the days leading up to the OLF leaders' arrival, supporters of the group trickled into the capital carrying and waving its Oromo Movement flag. The move angered some residents in Addis Ababa‚Äîwho see the flag as a symbol to separate the Oromia region from the rest of Ethiopia‚ÄîLeading to clashes that at left more than 20 people dead. Oromos are Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, constituting more than a third of the nation's 100 million-plus people. The flag controversy showcases the complexity of the political situation in Ethiopia and the challenges facing its ethnic federalism.The colors on the flag of the OLF are in fact the same as those of the flag of Ethiopia‚Äîgreen, yellow, and red. However, to emphasize their ethno-nationalist sympathies and their rejection of Ethiopian identity, it has become popular to omit the yellow and display a simplified red-green- red tricolor. The U.K. alert was issued on Friday with hours to the event whiles in the case of the U.S. its alert was issued on Thursday in connection with flag protests in Addis Ababa. The scuffles between Oromo youth and Amhara Youth had as at Friday led to one death after federal forces clashed with protesters. Amhara Youth who have also reportedly taken the law into their hands by removing hoisted flags have been cautioned by the police chief. Incidentally, the flags they are also putting up is the green, yellow, red version ‚Äì which is unofficial without the blue circle in the middle with a star. OLF leadership are expected to quit their base in Eritrea and formally return home after it agreed a deal with the federal government weeks ago in Asmara. OLF will now engage in peaceful armed struggle. =Burayu= The town of Burayu is located in the Special Zone Surrounding Finfinne in the Oromia, directly adjacent to the national capital, Addis Ababa.Finfinne is the Oromo name for Addis Ababa. With the growth of the city in recent decades and urban sprawl, the town has faced considerable economic and demographic pressures; its population leapt from around 10,000 in 1994 to an estimated 150,000 two decades later, as people, including many from the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region, migrated from the countryside looking for work, and Addis Ababa residents pushed outwards seeking cheaper housing. In 2012, more than half of residences were informal, as Burayu's authorities failed to deal with the demand, according to a 2014 paper by academics from Ethiopian Civil Service University. As a result, newcomers have been drawn into tension with the autochthonous Oromos; dispute over lands and coercive property transfers was a major contributing factor to the 2016 protests. Events According to eyewitnesses, clashes began late on Thursday, 13 September and continued sporadically the next day before escalating into a \\"full scale attack\\" on Saturday, 15 September. The events over the weekend were characterized as \\"organized robbery\\", as rioters looted and burnt businesses belonging to ethnic minorities. Hassan Ibrahim, a trader, told Reuters that \\"mobs of ethnic Oromo youth then marched here in Ashwa Meda [a neighborhood in Burayu] and attacked our homes and looted businesses chanting 'leave our land'\\". Regional police were largely unresponsive to the events as they folded; regional police commissioner Alemayehu Ejigu described the mobs as \\"organized hoodlums whose interest is looting\\", but said that the police were unable to respond \\"due to the topography of the region where the attack took place\\". Some witnesses alleged that local police had joined the mob in attacking local businesses. In the Burayu area alone, authorities reported that 23 people were killed, more than 500 have been injured and over 15,000 were displaced (local news sources reported exactly 15086 people). Addis Ababa police said the following Monday that 14 people had been killed in Kolfe district (, kifle ketema), 5 in Addis Ketema, 1 in Arada, 3 in Lafto and 5 in Kirkos. Aftermath On 17 September, thousands of people marched in Addis Ababa condemning the killings and perceived police inaction, five people were shot dead in what Amnesty International described as a \\"violent dispersal\\". In Arba Minch, condemnatory protests nearly turned violent as angry youths sought to stage reprisals against Oromo-owned businesses there, before elders intervened and succeeded in calming the mob. Leaders of seven parties including Oromo Federalist Congress, Oromo Liberation Front, Oromo Democratic Front, Oromo Unity for Freedom, Oromo Unity Front, Blue Party, and Patriotic Ginbot 7 Movement for Unity and Democracy issued a statement after a two-day meeting. the parties urged the youth to refrain from being used by forces fighting ongoing political reforms, championed by the prime minister, Abiy Ahmed. They also called on the government to strengthen its capacity to prevent conflicts and administer justices. At least 1,200 people were detained by Addis Ababa, Oromia, and federal police following the attacks, although the New York Times reported that most of those had been arrested in connection with unrelated \\"petty offenses\\" in sweeps of bars and clubs and other gathering spots across Addis Ababa. Amnesty International said that many of those arrested had in fact been taking part the in protests against the ethnic violence and demanded their immediate release. Negeri Lencho, a spokesperson for the Oromia Regional government, said that police who had participated in the attacks had been arrested. Burayu was one of the rapidly growing Oromia towns targeted by strategic planners and occasionally endured strikes and protests. It also faces severe political, economic and social pressures. Its population leaped from around 10,000 in 1994 to an estimated 150,000 two decades later, as people, including many from the Southern Nations, migrated from the countryside looking for work, and Addis Ababa residents pushed outwards seeking cheaper housing. In 2012, more than half of residences were informal, as Burayu's land agency failed to deal with the demand, according to a 2014 paper by academics from Ethiopian Civil Service University. The chaos overshadowed the return of the OLF faction, which is headed by Dawud Ibsa and was based in Eritrea. The insurgency formed in 1973 to fight for Oromia independence and was loosely allied with the Tigray People's Liberation Front(TPLF) in the struggle against the Derg. \\"OLF is the founding father of the Oromo struggle, dealing with the inhuman mass killings and injustices Oromo has been facing. So we are here to welcome our father\\", Chemeda Bokora from Harar said at the OLF rally. The federal governments jailed many thousands of Oromo for alleged OLF activity over the last two decades. The group now wants its armed wing to become part of Oromia's security apparatus, is willing to work with Oromo parties and seek allies in other states, and stands for ethnic self-determination, spokesman Tolera Adeba said in 12 Sep. interview. On 13 Sep., as residents rigged up Oromo Liberation Front(OLF) flags in preparation for the return to Ethiopia of the group's main faction two days later, individuals from the Oromo and Dorze ethnicities fought in and around Burayu, a town in Oromia state near the northwest boundary of Addis Ababa, the federal capital. Dorze attacked people putting up the flag the next day in Keta, leading to two Oromo deaths, said Henok Teshome, who lives there. The constitutional right to self-determination including secession is opposed by parties that reject ethnonationalism, including Ginbot 7, which recently split from the Patriotic Front. Ginbot 7, which was also Eritrea-based and ran a low-intensity insurgency, wants a restructured federation that is not based around ethnolinguistic identity, according to Ephrem Madebo, head of political affairs. An attendee at the OLF rally, Masresha Kumsa, said Menelik expropriated Oromo land using modern weaponry obtained from Europe \\"in the name of Christianity\\". The OLF and four Oromo parties said yesterday that the Ginbot 7-linked ESAT satellite channel had falsely framed OLF supporters. After the disorder spread to Addis Ababa's environs, accusations were leveled not only against Oromo activists for incitement but also against Ginbot 7 for orchestrating the attacks. Fatal attacks in the Addis Ababa area represent only the tip of recent violence, as local disputes flare during the transition, and an ideological struggle heats up. Regardless, Federal Police Commissioner-General Zeynu Jemal promoted the Arba Minch letter theory, although assigning blame to any party. Activist Jawar Mohammed claimed that 43 Oromos had been killed in the area of Saris Abo, but presented no evidence. Entertainer and activist Tamagne Beyene organized a relief appeal for the Global Alliance for the Rights of Ethiopians (GARE) that raised 13 million birr (US$425,000) for the benefit of those who fled their homes. Musician Teddy Afro donated 1 million birr (US$36,000) to relief efforts.

Approved EDE partners may access a suite of APIs which allow them to directly submit and update applications on the federal exchange. Using EDE allows private entities to offer consumers a smoother enrollment experience compared to the previous iteration, Direct Enrollment. Entities with EDE are also able to directly assist consumers with post-enrollment activities such as reporting changes to the application, submitting proof of citizenship or of qualifying life events, and downloading tax documents. Approved partners include HealthSherpa, Welltheos, Softheon, GetInsured, Stride Health, Enterate and GuideWell Connect.  History  The passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 created insurance exchanges that sold health insurance plans that met the consumer protection standards outlined in the health law, including covering certain essential health benefits and protecting people with pre-existing conditions. Prior to the launch of Healthcare.gov, a March 2012 regulation gave private web-brokers the ability to enroll subsidy-eligible people in these ‚ÄúMarketplace‚Äù plans. By July 2013, the federal government had signed deals with five web-brokers to allow them to enroll people in plans through the federally-operated Marketplace which then served 36 states. Enrollment in Marketplace coverage through the Affordable Health Act‚Äôs health insurance exchanges began in October 2013. Prior to the implementation of this pathway, consumers who wished to purchase a Marketplace health plan from a source other than Healthcare.gov could quote and select a plan on a web-broker‚Äôs site, but were redirected to Healthcare.gov to fill out the official application. Once the user completed the application and received their eligibility determination, they would be being redirected back to the web-broker‚Äôs site. This led many consumers to ‚Äúdrop off‚Äù during the process due to confusion or errors. The Department of Health and Human Services first announced that they were considering creating an Enhanced Direct Enrollment pathway in the proposed Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2017. The subsequent final 2017 rule noted that many commenters supported the proposal, arguing that it would increase enrollment by improving the consumer experience and eliminating the back-and-forth redirecting that caused many consumers to quit the process. Other commenters expressed worries that allowing the change would expose consumers to misleading or inaccurate information on web-broker sites. HHS asked for comments on the Enhanced Direct Enrollment Pathway again in the Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2018. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released detailed guidance for entities wishing to implement the pathway in February 2018. These guidelines noted that entities would be allowed to implement one of three phase options of the technology, each successive phase allowing the entity to directly enroll a greater percentage of consumers. Phase 1 entities can support only simple cases and Phase 2 entities can support common complex cases including applicants who are pregnant, full-time students, or noncitizens. Phase 3 entities can support all applicants. Entities choosing to implement any phase must undergo rigorous privacy and security audits. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid services then ‚Äúreviews the audit results to ensure compliance with nearly 300 CMS security and privacy standards.‚Äù Entities wishing to use EDE must additionally ‚Äúsign a privacy and security agreement with CMS.‚Äù  Implementation  On December 4, 2018, HealthSherpa announced that they had become the first entity approved to launch EDE, going live with Phase 2. On December 11, 2018, Stride Health announced that they had launched EDE. On April 5, 2019, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released a list of approved Enhanced Direct Enrollment partners. HealthSherpa and Stride were listed as the only two entities hosting EDE platforms, with seven insurance carriers listed as approved to use EDE but not hosting a platform. A March 2019 report from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities noted that at that time, at least six of the entities approved were using HealthSherpa‚Äôs platform. On July 16, 2019, Guidewell Connect announced that they had received approval to use EDE as a direct enrollment technology provider. On July 23, 2019, GetInsured became the first company to be approved to go live with Phase 3 Enhanced Direct Enrollment technology. On January 21, 2020, HealthSherpa announced they had enrolled over 1.2 million consumers using full Phase 3 Enhanced Direct Enrollment technology, representing 14% of active Healthcare.gov enrollment.  Reactions  Many consumer advocates have expressed worries that allowing private entities to use the Enhanced Direct Enrollment pathway would negatively impact the consumer experience. Tara Straw, a policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, wrote in a March 2019 report that ‚Äúsome insurers and brokers‚Ä¶..offer short-term health plans and other types of plans that don‚Äôt meet ACA consumer protections and benefit standards but pay high commissions to agents and brokers. Federal rules bar [EDE] entities from displaying these plans alongside marketplace plans, but some [web brokers] use screening tools to shift consumers away from marketplace options.‚Äù She also noted that not all web-brokers offer all plans available in a particular zip code, making it difficult for consumers to compare their plan options. However, other groups - including the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services itself, have argued that the pathway will foster innovation around the enrollment experience. In a November 2018 press release, CMS said the technology would allow ‚Äúthe private sector to come up with innovative ways to create a uniquely tailored end-to-end user experience.‚Äù In a blog post for Health Affairs, Katie Keith noted that some states \\"seem[ed] to be interested\\" in using the pathway ‚Äúto create their own marketplaces that replace the profile of HealthCare.gov.‚Äù In a December 2018 press release, HealthSherpa noted that EDE would allow them to customize the enrollment experience for their nonprofit partners ‚Äúto meet the needs of diverse and underserved communities.‚Äù References Category:2018 establishments in the United States Category:Healthcare in the United States ","title":"Enhanced Direct Enrollment"},{"id":"61449764","text":"The Sentience Institute is an American think tank that specializes in effective altruism and social movement research.

The monastery is picturesquely located on the cliff of a promontory in the curve of the Ckalcitela river, a tributary of the Rioni river.  History  Its name, whose meaning is the \\"Place of the Martyrs\\", is related to the brothers of a noble family of Argveti, David and Constantine, who organized a rebellion against the occupying Arabs in the 8th century. When the rebellion failed, they were captured and then they were promised forgiveness in exchange for converting to Islam. None accepted the offer, and they were later tortured and killed, and their bodies were thrown into the river. The water turned red and in memory of this event, the river was called Ckalcitela, which means red water. According to the story, the brothers' remains were captured by the lions and taken to the hill, where the Gelati monastery is located. Later, the Orthodox Church of Georgia recognized them as Saints, and in the 11th century, the king Bagrat IV of Georgia founded a temple there. Officials from the Bolshevik secret police in 1923 took the remains of David and Constantine from the Gelati monastery to the museum in Kutaisi, but this caused such a scandal that the relics were delivered quickly and are still in the monasteries today.

Elements of the Mishnaic order of Taharot are also cited in his name by the Tosafists,Cf. the Sefer ha-Makhri'a (Leghorn, 1779) of Isaiah di Trani (nos 62, 86, et al.); Chaim Yosef David Azulai in Shem ha- Gedolim, i. 106 and E.E. Urbach, Tosafot, index. (e.g. Baba Metsi'a 30a, Tosafot s.v. ◊ê◊£ ◊¢◊ï◊ë◊ì ◊ì◊†◊ô◊ó◊ê ◊ú◊ô◊î) but the complete work is no longer extant. Background Rabbi Isaac ben Melchizedek was the son of an astute Italian Jewish Talmudist. Rabbi Isaac eventually moved away from his home town and settled in Salerno. He is known to have fathered at least two sons: Judah and Shiloh. It was in Salerno that Isaac's son, Judah, met with the renowned Jewish traveler, Benjamin of Tudela. Benjamin of Tudelo referred to his father, Rabbi Isaac, as \\"the great rabbi.\\" In Italy, Rabbi Isaac maintained a correspondence with Rabbi Yaakov ben Meir, known also as Rabbeinu Tam. Shiloh, his son, is mentioned in Sefer ha-'I·π≠·π≠ur.Sefer ha-'I·π≠·π≠ur (ed. Lemberg, i. 14b) > From Naples by sea to the city of Salerno, where the Christians have a > school of medicine. About 600 Jews dwell there. Among the scholars are R. > Judah, son of R. Isaac, the son of Melchizedek, the great Rabbi, who came > from the city of Siponto. Isaac's Mishnah commentary is thought to have had a wide dissemination among Jewish communities throughout the Mediterranean littoral and Egypt, as some of his words are cited and argued against by great Jewish scholars in FostatSimcha Assaf, Kiryat Sefer, XVIII (1941), p. 65 and in Posqui√®res.R. Abraham b. David of Posqui√®res' gloss to Mishneh Torah, Tum'eot ha-Met 1:2, 14:7, and 17:3David Jeremy Silver, Maimonidean Criticism and the Maimonidean Controversy 1180‚Äì1240, E.J. Brill, Leiden 1965, p. 22 (note 2) Rabbi Abraham b. David of Posqui√®res referred to Rabbi Isaac by the epithet, Ha-Rav ha- Yevani, meaning, \\"the Grecian rabbi,\\" seeing that part of southern Italy was at that time under Byzantine influence. Rabbi Isaac's work is also widely cited by Solomon Sirilio where, occasionally, he decides in favor of Isaac's interpretation of a passage in the Mishnah over that of the later scholar, Maimonides. Both, Ishtori Haparchi and Rabbi Chaim Joseph David Azulai, make mention of him in their writings.cf. Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg mentions him with respect to teachings in Mishnah Kelim 8:6; Nega'im 11:1. Rabbi Isaac's commentary of Seder Zera'im has been printed in the 1890 Romm Wilna edition of the Babylonian Talmud. In most editions of the Berakhot tractate, his commentary on Seder Zera'im appears in its entirety. The portion of Rabbi Isaac's Mishnah commentary of Bikkurim 2:4, unto the end of the tractate, is of special importance, as it has been printed in Shimshon of Sens's commentary of the Mishnah where he left no commentary of his own. In Rabbi Isaac ben Melchizedek's commentary, besides citing from the two Talmuds, he frequently makes use of other classical rabbinic sources, such as the Tosefta, the Sifra on Leviticus, Sifrei Zu·π≠a on the Book of Numbers, the Aramaic Targum, the Seder 'Olam, the Sefer Arukh of Rabbi Nathan ben Jehiel of Rome, the commentary written by Rabbi Hai Gaon on the Mishnaic orders of Zera'im and ·π¨aharot, as well as cites elements taken from R. Nissim's Sefer Maftea·∏• (\\"The book of the key to unlocking the Talmud\\"). Manuscripts Two manuscripts exist of Isaac ben Melchizedek's Mishnah commentary, one at the Bodleian Library in Oxford (no. 392 - [Michael 203]), written on paper and copied in the 16-17th century, containing all of Seder Zera'im; the other is housed at the British Library (Or 6712), formerly the British Museum, written on parchment and also containing all of Seder Zera'im. Mishnah Kil'ayim 1:2‚Äì3 (Courtesy of the British Library) Importance Rabbi Isaac's Mishnah commentary was published and edited by Nisan Meir Zaks (q.v. N.M. Zaks) in 1975, laureate of the \\"Rav Kook Award\\" for original Torah literature. When read in conjunction with other commentaries, it is an indispensable source for helping scholars understand the diachrony of the Hebrew language, especially in its use of Greek loan words, and how that some words have changed in meaning over the course of two millennia. Rabbi Isaac's method of elucidating the Mishnah is concise, resembling that of Rashi's commentary on the Talmud. His commentary is unique in that he not only employs in his commentary Aramaic words to elucidate the text, but also Arabic, Greek, Latin and Italian words, written in Hebrew characters.

Early life and education Tong was born in Carroll, Fairfield County, Ohio on August 1, 1842. He was the oldest child of Oliver Perry Tong (1813-1871) and Eleanor Elizabeth Poorman (1813-1876). In 1858 Tong began studies at Kenyon College, and in 1859 he entered the University of Notre Dame. He received a diploma in the Commercial Department at Notre Dame in 1861 and a Bachelor of Laws from Notre Dame in 1871. Career Tong began teaching at Notre Dame in 1863 as Professor of Bookkeeping. Immediately after receiving his law degree in 1871, he also served as Professor of Commercial Civil Law. The following year he was identified as Dean of the Commercial Faculty, Professor of Bookkeeping and of Commercial and Civil Laws. By 1877 he was Director of the Law Department as well as Professor of Bookkeeping. He remained on the faculty of Notre Dame as Professor of Law and Bookkeeping until 1882, when he was appointed secretary of the St. Joseph County Savings Bank. Tong and attorney John Hagerty established a practice as attorneys and real estate agents in South Bend in August 1873. In May 1874, Hagerty qualified as City Judge in South Bend and in 1875 Tong established a law practice of his own. =Political career= Tong was elected mayor of South Bend, Indiana in 1878 on the Republican Party ticket, succeeding Republican Alexander N. Thomas. Tong defeated Democratic Party candidate Dwight Deming by a tally of 1262 to 1140 votes. While mayor, he had the opportunity to meet U.S. president Rutherford B. Hayes during a brief stop of the president in South Bend. Tong served one term as mayor, losing his bid for re-election in 1880 to Democrat Levi J. Ham by a tally of 1317 to 1076 votes. Although he was mentioned as a possible candidate for mayor in 1888, he never held any other political office. A newspaper history written more than 25 years after his term as mayor noted that Tong's \\"administration was noted for the great amount of routine business disposed of in a given time,\\" and that Tong \\"wasted no time with talk that was not directly to the point ... being of methodical habits he wanted to see the budget cleaned up at each session.\\" Mayor Tong was largely responsible for securing for the city \\"Heck's addition,\\" the tract of land now known as Howard Park (used at the time for dumping purposes). Notable legislation that was considered by the city council during Tong's service as mayor involved the paving of several streets in South Bend with cedar blocks, rather than clay bricks. =Banking= Tong was elected a trustee of the St. Joseph County Savings Bank in 1878, was appointed Vice President in 1880, secretary (also known as ‚Äúcashier‚Äù) in May 1882, and treasurer in 1904. He was appointed secretary-treasurer of the St. Joseph Loan and Trust Co. when it was organized in 1900. In 1904 he was elected president of the newly formed South Bend Clearing House Association, organized to facilitate business between the city‚Äôs financial institutions. In late 1907 Tong suffered a nervous breakdown which was attributed to the nationwide financial crisis known as the Panic of 1907. He died on April 12, 1908 in South Bend. Personal life Tong was a founding member of the St. Joseph Total Abstinence Society (a temperance group organized in 1874 for young Catholic men), the South Bend branch of the Land League (organized to provide support to the ‚Äúoppressed tenantry of Ireland‚Äù), and the local chapter of the League of American Wheelmen (established in 1890 to promote cycling). He also served as the first president of the Municipal Voters' League of South Bend (intended to promote good government). Tong married Bridget Cecilia Ball (1847-1914) in Lafayette, Indiana on September 8, 1873. She was a native of Ireland and the daughter of a prominent wholesale grocer in Lafayette.

Jenkins' Roane and Jackson County raid in September 1862, Confederate raiders seized Spencer (the Roane County seat) on September 2, in part because Col. Rathbone who was commanding five companies of the 11th West Virginia failed to heed General B. Kelley's warnings of their advance, so his men awoke with Confederates pointing guns at them (and fled to the woods or towards Parkersburg, and Rathbone soon surrendered with 200 men and was paroled by Jenkins). The advancing Confederates then arrived in Ripley, the Jackson County seat, where they again faced no opposition.

From Wheeling, Governor Pierpont sent more men to defend Parkersburg, and Frost took command of the soldiers who had retreated from Spencer to the city.Henry Edmund Matheny, Wood County, West Virginia in Civil War Times, with an account of Guerilla Warfare in the Little Kanawha Valley (Trans-Allegheny Books, Parkersburg 1987) p. 276-277 Although the documents of the U.S. Army investigation of the Spencer incident were lost, rumors abounded that Rathbone had reached a deal to protect his oil field. Thus, after his release, Rathbone was only allowed to supervise suspected Confederate sympathizers imprisoned in Ohio, then was dismissed from the service on January 6, 1863, reportedly for cowardice during the Spencer incident. Papers documenting the revocation of that dismissal by President Johnson in 1866 were also lost. Although Rathbone was later reimbursed for funds he had spent outfitting the 11th West Virginia Infantry and Company C of the 1st West Virginia Cavalry, he was a broken man by this and the burning of his family's oil fields at Burning Springs the following July, and after the war moved to Kansas, where he died not long afterward.Matheny pp. 275-281 Meanwhile, promoted to lead the 11th West Virginia, Col. Frost defended Parkersburg from September 1862 until the arrival of the 126th Ohio Regiment and Col. G.W. McCook. Frost also recruited Company F of the 3rd West Virginia Cavalry at Parkersburg in November 1862, eventually deploying it on scout duty in Wood, Jackson and Wirt counties. However, first they guarded Camp Union, the Parkersburg depots, as well as road trans between Parkersburg and the Ohio River, while Captain W.K. Flesher receruited Company H of the Third (West) Virginia Cavalry patroleed the roads from Parkersburg to Ripley, Ravenswood and Belleville and would eventually be attached to the 23rd Ohio Infantry.Matheny pp. 307-308 By the fall of 1862, Confederate raiders had wrecked the railroad from Parkersburg to Doddridge County, increasing the burden on the east/west Wheeling railroad line; plus traffic had virtually ceased on the Northwestern and Staunton Pikes, on which the Moccasin Raiders and Night Hawk Raiders were often seen, although after General B. F. Kelley was assigned to rebuild the railroad that winter, the job got done.Matheny pp. 305-307 Meanwhile, Frost also maintained a military station at Ravenswood, where some Confederate sympathizers objected to his efforts to get them to take the loyalty oath, particularly if they returned to the area as had Mrs. Henrietta Barr, whose four brothers had all enlisted in the Confederate States Army.Matheny pp. 309-310 Frost feared vandalism and other bushwhacking activities.http://www.wvculture.org/history/journal_wvh/wvh43-2.htmlMoore pp. 114-115 A few Union cavalrymen patrolled north of Ripley that fall and winter; sufficient patrols to support mail service to Ripley would not begin until the summer of 1863, when Capt. William Logsdon organized the State Scouts.Matheny pp. 281-282 Frost received his formal commission as colonel on February 11, 1863, and was then again appointed to lead Parkersburg's defenses. He replaced Lt. Col. John F. Hoy of the 6th West Virginia Infantry in March 1863, in part because Hoy's son had been dismissed for Confederate sympathies and because Arthur Boreman wrote Gov. Pierpont on March 2 that Ritchie County railroad bridges were burned the previous night and secessionists claimed Hoy proposed to allow them including Sherrad Clemens to speak in Parkersburg. Thus Clemens's proposed speech in MIddlebourne, the Tyler COunty seat on March 9 was prevented and Frost cleared Wirt County boatmen from Parkersburg on March 12, eventually preventing a proposed anti-New State convention being called by (former militia General) John Jay Jackson (Wood County's most powerful politician).Matheny pp. 314-324 As West Virginia voters overwhelmingly voted for statehood in late March 1863 (President Lincoln recognizing the vote in April and stating that statehood would occur 60 days later in June, 1863), the \\"Moccasin Rangers\\" would be organized formally within the 19th Virginia Cavalry (under CSA Col. then (Gen.) John Imboden and William Lowther Jackson of Parkersburg). Furthermore, the \\"Night Hawk Rangers\\" of Parkersburg started by Capt. James S. Alexander Crawford would become Company F of the 17th Virginia Cavalry.Matheny pp. 294-301 All noticed horses seized by Confederate raiders in the mountains, which supported a Confederate buildup in the spring of 1863. Thus Captain Flesher's cavalry was sent to Sutton based on rumors the invaders would cross there and proceed to Weston. Outposts in Roane, Wirt and Jackson Counties (even Ravenswood) were temporarily abandoned, which exacerbated bridge-burning by Confederate troops. Frost declared martial law in Wood County on April 20. Peter Van Winkle's son Rathbone Van Winkle recruited between 500 and 1000 men in Parkersburg for the 113th Virginia militia. Meanwhile, the Jones Imboden Raid began by capturing Rowlesburg and Kingwood in Preston County as well as Oakland, Maryland; and Fairmont in Marion County surrendered on April 29, with Union General Roberts retreating to Clarksburg. As Imboden's offensive began, Pierpont had been slow to realize the danger, and Frost feared a southwestern invasion. He asked for 3000 men to defend the railroad, 500 additional guns for new recruits and Parkersburg's cannons to be returned, with little result until mid-May. Although Capt. Henry Haywood of the 18th U.S. Infantry noted his availability, Pierpont sent those troops to protect Wheeling rather than Parkersburg on May 4, so on Frost sent his son, Sgt. Taylor Frost and four men as scouts to Harrisville, but they were captured on May 7.Matheny pp. 328-339 A Union convention had been scheduled for Parkersburg on May 6, but it was delayed as boat crews feared crossing the 13 miles between Marietta, Ohio and Parkersburg. Rumors abounded that Col. Mudwall Jackson had a grudge list and would sack and burn Parkersburg, particularly as Gen. Roberts removed troops from Parkersburg to protect various railroad stations, even though raiders had already destroyed intervening rails so no attack by train could be expected. Gov. Pierpont asked for troops from Ohio, but only 400 men were sent on May 7, barely replacing the men sent to protect the B&O.; However, the convention eventually was held after Col. Steedman conveyed delegates on the steamer Ohio No. 3 from Wheeling. The convention nominated Boreman for governor, Jacob E. Boyers of Tyler County for secretary of state, Campbell Tarr of Brooke County for treasurer, Samuel Crane of Randolph for auditor, Aquilla B. Caldwell of Ohio County for Attorney General and Ralph L. Berkshire of Monongalia County, William A. Harrison of Harrison County and James H. Brown of Kanawha County as the three judges of the new state's Court of Appeals. On May 7 Gen. Kelley notified Pierpont that he was ordering the 14th Pennsylvania Cavalry and the 10th (West) Virginia Infantry to aid Parkersburg, and the upper Ohio Naval Command sent a second gunboat. Although Frost prepared evacuation plans, sympathizers' intelligence about the additional troops and gunboats reached the Confederates, and General Jones detoured to burn Rathbone's undefended oil field at Burning Springs rather than Parkersburg. Rathbone had tried to ransom the oil field, to no effect. On May 9, the burning oil boats and tanks exploded and burned (perhaps as much as 150,000 gallons of oil), and the river became a sheet of fire, somewhat obscured by clouds of black smoke though the red could be seen from the roof of Parkersburg's Swann hotel. Although Moccasin Rangers continued to create trouble, railroad crews fixed the tunnel at Cairo, the 11th West Virginia Infantry again protected the railroad by mid- month. Elections were held on May 28 as scheduled, although some Confederate sympathizers were confined beforehand and only 33 counties participated. In mid-June, construction of what was initially called Fort Logan (but Fort Boreman after the governor took office) was completed on the hill above Parkersburg to house the two returned brass cannon.Matheny pp. 328-344,364-366 During 1863, despite his lack of formal legal training, Col. Frost also led courts martial in Clarksburg, West Virginia and Cumberland, Maryland. That summer, the 11th West Virginia participated in General Averill's and Union General David Hunter's raids into Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, including the burning of the Virginia Military Institute.http://www.theintelligencer.net/news/community/2016/07/daniel-frost- helped-chart-w-va-s-statehood-2 Thus, the 9th West Virginia and 13th Kentucky militia (rather than the 11th West Virginia) defended Ravenswood during the victory at the Battle of Buffington Island which ended the raiding of CSA Major General John Hunt Morgan (although Morgan would surrender 8 days later after further defeat at the Battle of Salineville). Col. Frost and his 11th West Virginia also fought raiders led by CSA Gen. Jubal Early in 1864, and Col. Frost received a citation for gallantry during the victory at the Battle of Cloyd's Mountain. Death and legacy On July 18, 1864, Col. Frost was commanding the Third Brigade of Col. Joseph Thoburn's division when (due to poor intelligence) it encountered a large Confederate force near Snicker's Ferry, in what became known as the Battle of Cool Spring. Frost received a severe abdominal would, and survived long enough to be taken to a nearby farmhouse, where he wrote out his last will and testament, though a nearby Confederate-sympathizing relative refused to come to his deathbed.http://www.theintelligencer.net/news/community/2016/07/daniel-frost- helped-chart-w-va-s-statehood-2 Large crowds attended Frost's funeral in Wheeling, West Virginia.http://www.theintelligencer.net/news/community/2016/07/daniel-frost- helped-chart-w-va-s-statehood-2/ Daniel Frost is buried at historic Mount Wood Cemetery above Wheeling.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/12177671/daniel- edward-frost His youngest daughter did not survive to adulthood; his widow would live until 1886, marrying twice more, first in 1867 to Andrew Brown in Scioto County, Ohio, then in 1870 to John W. Brigham in Missouri, before moving to Cairo, Illinois (where their son Daniel V. Frost had settled) before her death .https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/43421771/ellen-sophia-brigman Meanwhile, although Frost's Unionist friend Andrew Flesher restarted a newspaper in Ravenswood (and sold it after about a year), Jackson County's next multi-year newspaper would be the Jackson Democrat, beginning in Ripley in 1864 (the year President Lincoln received 670 votes in the county, compared to 190 for McClellan) and replaced by the Jackson Herald in 1875.Moore p. 136 West Virginia has erected a highway marker memorializing Daniel Frost's contributions to the new state.https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=124351 References Category:1819 births Category:1864 deaths Category:Military personnel from West Virginia Category:Members of the Virginia House of Delegates Category:Union Army officers Category:People of Virginia in the American Civil War Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"Daniel E.

Year-by-year breakdown =1960= CBS first broadcast National Hockey League games for four seasons from to . CBS aired games on Saturday afternoons with Bud Palmer and Fred Cusick initially handling the announcing duties. Palmer served as the play-by-play announcer while Cusick did color commentary as well as interviews for the first three seasons. In , Cusick moved over to play-by-play while Brian McFarlane came in to do the color commentary and interviews. The pregame and intermission interviews were done on the ice, with the interviewer on skates. No playoff games were televised during this period and all broadcasts took place in one of the four American arenas at the time. In the May 28 edition of the Winnipeg Free Press, a Canadian Press article mentioned the fact that the CBC fielded numerous angry calls from viewers upset that CBC continued to televise all three overtimes of the third game of the Toronto- Detroit playoff series. Because of this, the angry viewers missed several previously scheduled shows as the overtime continued on. The CBC said that the policy of telecasting each Stanley Cup playoff game to its conclusion would be enforced. =1961= Some semifinal playoff games may not have been seen outside the Toronto or Montreal metro areas. This may have been the first time that all playoff games were televised somewhere across Canada. =1962= CBC's Winnipeg affiliate carried Game 3 of the Montreal-Chicago playoff series at 8:30 p.m. Central time (9:30 p.m. Eastern time). Meanwhile, they aired The Ed Sullivan Show at 7:00 p.m. (8:00 p.m. Eastern), which included guest stars Wayne and Shuster. This was followed by Close-Up at 8:00 p.m. (9:00 p.m. Eastern) and then the hockey game in progress. On April 3, CBC's affiliates in and near Toronto aired The Garry Moore Show at 8 p.m. followed by Game 4 of the Toronto-New York Rangers game in progress at 9:00 p.m. =1966= CTV's involvement with the NHL began in the season with a series of Wednesday-night regular season games. These were produced by the McLaren ad agency, which also produced the Saturday night Hockey Night in Canada games for the CBC. As was the case with the Saturday games, they were contests (usually at home) of the Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs, and after 1970, the Vancouver Canucks. CTV decided to pull out of midweek NHL coverage in 1975, opening the way for local TV stations in the three Canadian cities which had NHL clubs to carry mid-week telecasts of their hometown NHL clubs (also usually on Wednesday nights). On March 16, 1966, CTV's coverage of the game between the Canadiens and Maple Leafs was frequently interrupted for news updates on the Gemini 8 space mission, which had run into serious trouble after being successfully launched that morning; when the game ended, CTV joined a simulcast of CBS News coverage in time for the capsule's re-entry and splashdown. There was no American network television coverage of the Stanley Cup playoffs until 1965‚Äì66 (which also marked the first telecasts of an NHL game in color), the second to last season of the Original Six era. The earliest known American television coverage of any kind occurred in 1956, when Games 3 and 5 of the Montreal-New York Rangers playoff series were televised in the New York area on WPIX 11 at 9 p.m. local time. Bud Palmer worked play- by-play for those games on WPIX while and Jack McCarthy hosted from the studio. The regional issues that caused the NHL's previous American television deal with CBS to be terminated were settled by the league's pending addition of six new teams, which expanded the league's reach nationwide and into lucrative markets in Pennsylvania and California (in addition to two other midwestern markets; NBC, however, would lose the broadcast rights before the six new teams would make it to play). In 1966, NBC became the first television network in the United States to air a national broadcast of a Stanley Cup Playoff game. The network provided coverage of four Sunday afternoon playoff games during the postseason. On April 10 and April 17, NBC aired semifinal games between the Chicago Black Hawks and the Detroit Red Wings. On April 24 and May 1, NBC aired Games 1 and 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals between the Montreal Canadiens and the Detroit Red Wings. Win Elliot served as the play- by-play man while Bill Mazer served as the color commentator for the games. NBC's coverage of the 1966 Stanley Cup Finals marked the first time that hockey games were broadcast on network television in color. The CBC would follow suit the following year. NBC's Stanley Cup coverage preempted a sports anthology series called NBC Sports in Action, hosted by Jim Simpson and Bill Cullen, who were between-periods co-hosts for the Stanley Cup broadcasts. To accommodate the American TV coverage on NBC, Game 1 of the 1966 Stanley Cup Finals was shifted to a Sunday afternoon. This in return, was the first time ever that a National Hockey League game was played on a Sunday afternoon in Montreal. In the United States, the clinching game of the 1966 Stanley Cup Finals on the evening of Thursday, May 5 aired on RKO General's stations, such as WOR-TV in New York City and WHCT in Hartford, Connecticut. The commentators for RKO's coverage on that occasion were Bob Wolff and Emile Francis. Wolff at the time did play-by-play for New York Rangers games seen on WOR. Although the TV listings page of the May 5, 1966 edition of the Boston Globe indicated that RKO-owned WNAC-TV in Boston would not carry the game,Boston Globe, May 5, 1966 the then-ABC-affiliated station did clear the broadcast at the last minute. =1967= For six seasons, from through , CBS aired a game each week between mid-January until early-mid May in each of those seasons, mainly on a Sunday afternoon, including playoffs. Each American based franchise was paid US$100,000 annually for the first two years of the initial contract and $150,000 for the third. From 1968‚Äì69 through 1971‚Äì72, the intermission studio was called \\"CBS Control,\\" just like with its NFL coverage. Due to prior programming commitments, CBS could not broadcast regular season games during the 1966-67 season, so that portion of the package was subleased to RKO General, which syndicated eight regular-season games to some cities, including the four U.S. cities that then had NHL clubs and the six U.S. cities that would gain new teams in the 1967 expansion. RKO General aired series of Sunday afternoon broadcasts at 4 p.m. Eastern Time during the last eight weeks of the regular season. This started on February 12, 1967. Some regular-season games were blacked out in the cities where they were played. For example, the March 26, 1967 game between the Boston Bruins and Montreal Canadiens in Boston was not televised on any station in the Boston area.Boston Globe, March 26, 1967, p. 37 Except Game 2 of the Toronto-Chicago series, all of the Stanley Cup playoff games on CBC were televised in color. The 1967 playoffs were the first time CBC televised NHL games in color. =1968= CBS started its weekly 1967‚Äì68 coverage with the opening game (the Philadelphia Flyers vs. Los Angeles Kings) at The Forum in Inglewood, California on December 30. Then after two more Saturday afternoons, CBS switched to covering Sunday afternoon games beginning on January 28 for the next 10 weeks. Due to another strike by AFTRA (which resulted in the cancellation of a New York Rangers-Montreal broadcast), CBS started its playoff coverage with a CBC tape of the previous night's Boston-Montreal game. On April 13, CBS started its three-week-long weekend afternoon Stanley Cup coverage. The last game of the series was St. Louis-Montreal on May 11. For the playoffs, Jim Gordon worked play-by-play and Stu Nahan worked color commentary and intermission interviews. During the regular season, Gordon and Nahan alternated roles each week. For instance, Gordon worked play-by-play on December 30 while Nahan worked play-by-play the next week. =1969= In , CBS broadcast 13 regular season afternoon games and five Stanley Cup playoff games. Dan Kelly did play-by-play while Bill Mazer did color commentary and intermission interviews.

In December 1992, J√°n Mito≈°inka was elected as the new chairman, who in turn nominated Okoliƒç√°ny as vice-president of the Slovak Ice Hockey Federation.Holko, J√°n (2013) p. 35 From 1993 to 2003, Okoliƒç√°ny directed the organizing committee when Slovakia hosted 12 IIHF competitions. Okoliƒç√°ny was the manager of the Slovakia men's national ice hockey team at the 1993 Olympic qualification. Slovakia won the event, and Okoliƒç√°ny went on to manage the team for ice hockey at the 1994 Winter Olympics, the 1996 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships, the 1997 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships and ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics. In a 2008 interview, he said that \\"I have worked with Art Berglund since 1993, when we appeared as Slovakia on the national hockey map. He was one of those who supported us. It was not easy to get to the Olympic qualifiers, or to organize the IIHF competitions with us\\". IIHF administrator Okoliƒç√°ny was part of the IIHF's junior committee from 1993 to 1998, and a member of the IIHF's referee committee from 1998 to 2008.

Okoliƒç√°ny and the referee committee were responsible for performance of the officials at IIHF events. He described his duties as working from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. during events; which included analyzing previous matches, evaluating officials and correcting mistakes, and planning which officials referee future matches. He stated that new referees were rarely chosen for the championship final, and his goal was to prepare officials for future Winter Olympic Games. Honors and awards Okoliƒç√°ny's career as an official was recognized when he was awarded the IIHF Referee Gold Badge. In May 2008, Okoliƒç√°ny was honored with the Paul Loicq Award, presented for \\"special contributions to the IIHF and international ice hockey\\". He received the award during the IIHF Hall of Fame induction ceremony at the 2008 IIHF World Championship in Quebec City. He was the first Slovak to win the award, and his acceptance speech noted the great satisfaction he felt to receive the award during the IIHF's 100th anniversary celebrations in Canada. He also credited his wife for supporting while he was away for 130 days per year at seven to eight tournaments. Death and legacy Okoliƒç√°ny died on 10 September 2008, in Bratislava, due to complications from surgery. He had lived most of his life in Bratislava at the time of his death. His remains were cremated and his funeral was attended by Ren√© Fasel on behalf of the IIHF.Holko, J√°n (2013) p. 37 Fasel said in memoriam, \\"The entire international ice hockey family is devastated by Juraj's death. It feels like it was just yesterday that we celebrated his accomplishments in Quebec City. He was a person that was simply there, at every World Championship, at every Olympics, working tirelessly for the good of the sport\\". Ice Hockey Federation of Russia president Vladislav Tretiak referred to Okoliƒç√°ny as \\"a great caliber professional who lived with hockey and was always devoted to sports\\". Czechoslovak national player Jozef Golonka stated, \\"I met him as one of the best Czechoslovak referees and was a real top. For many years he has been a member of the IIHF at the Referee Committee, and only a well-trained person can do it. I believe it is a great loss not only for Slovak, but also for Czechoslovakian hockey and for the IIHF. because he was the one who had everything the referees had to say under the thumb, he was the man who could get the best out of every referee, and he was a very strong man and he could always assert himself\\". Okoliƒç√°ny is the namesake of the Juraj Okoliƒç√°ny Award, given annually to the best referee in the Slovakia.

Transformasi Nasional 2050 (TN50, National Transformation 2050); is an initiative of national development that spans 30 years, from 2020 to 2050. It was launched by the 6th Prime Minister of Malaysia, Najib Razak. The initiative was planned to be driven by clear goals and targets for the span of 30 years, which were to be developed through a consultative process in the preparatory phase from 2017 to 2019. Policy documents of TN50 were to be published in 2020. However following the changes of government in Malaysia in 2018, the new Youth and Sports Minister Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman announced the TN50 was officially dismantled with some aspirations maintained by the Pakatan Harapan (PH)'s Malaysia Baharu government after GE14.  History  The Ministry of Youth and Sports started the process by leading the ‚ÄòTN50 Discussion‚Äô, involvement series and activities discourse. The 2017‚Äì2019 preparation phase included other activities that related to the development of TN50 policy documents such as engagement with policy stakeholders, domain experts and leaders in specific areas. = Prime dialogue = The TN50 Prime Dialogue (Dialog Perdana TN50) was held in Dewan Tunku Canselor, Universiti Malaya on 19 January 2017.

As Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar, the senior government official in charge, he transferred the city's administration to Colonel (temp. Brigadier-General) Reginald Dyer in April 1919, which helped to precipitate the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. Early career Irving was born in Singapore, then the capital of the crown colony of the Straits Settlements; his father Charles John Irving was a senior revenue officer who rose to become the colony's Auditor-General. Educated at Blundell's School and at Balliol College, Oxford, Irving sat the Indian Civil Service exams in 1898 and arrived in India on 10 November 1899. He was assigned to the Punjab cadre of the ICS, and in April 1914 served at Lahore, the capital of the Punjab Province. In the same month, he was appointed senior secretary to the financial commissioner of Punjab, with the rank of assistant commissioner (1st grade). In October, he was promoted to deputy commissioner (officiating), Having received a reserve commission in the British Indian Army with the rank of captain, he was called to active duty in February 1917, and was promoted from captain to temporary lieutenant-colonel on 20 February 1917. Initially posted as assistant adjutant-general at Delhi, Irving was subsequently assigned to the headquarters of the Southern Command. He was demobilised in February 1919, having been mentioned in dispatches. For his wartime service, he was further appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, Military Division in June. Amritsar Following his demobilisation, Irving was appointed officiating deputy commissioner for Amritsar city and the surrounding district. In March 1919, the enactment of the Rowlatt Act, which imposed stricter press censorship, arbitrary and warrantless searches and detention without trial, triggered massive protests across India. In response to the Act's passage, Mahatma Gandhi called for a general strike (hartal) to begin on 30 March as part of a peaceful satyagraha. On 30 March, the Amritsar satyagraha movement was launched by a Dr. Satyapal, a local general practitioner, and his friend Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew, a barrister who had studied at Cambridge University and was close to Gandhi, having known him since 1909. Though the hartal in Amritsar on 6 April passed peacefully, on 8 April Irving telegraphed the Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab, Sir Michael O'Dwyer, reporting members of all three major faiths in the city - Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims - had united for the satyagraha. Characterising Satyapal and Kitchlew as agitators and troublemakers, Irving requested immediate reinforcements, including machine-gun units if possible. With O'Dwyer giving his approval, on the morning of 10 April Irving invited Satyapal and Kitchlew to a private meeting at his official residence in the British cantonment, located in the Civil Lines area. Upon arrival, both were arrested and deported by car to Dharamshala in the United Provinces, where they were held without trial.. After Kitchlew and Satyapal's followers were informed of their leaders' arrests, several barrister friends of Kitchlew's led a deputation towards Irving's residence, accompanied by a large crowd.
