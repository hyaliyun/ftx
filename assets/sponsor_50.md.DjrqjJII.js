People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan & J C Das page 172 to 176 Manohar Publications Origin The community get their name from the Hindi words bans, meaning bamboo and phorna which means to split. They are a community that were traditionally involved in the manufacture of bamboo items for household usage. According to traditions, they are one of the seven sub-groups of the Dom community. Their own traditions refer to a Bans Rajah, a prince who said to have ruled in the Awadh region, from whom the community descend. They are found throughout Uttar Pradesh, with special concentrations in the districts of Farrukhabad, Saharanpur and Pilibhit in western Uttar Pradesh, and Sitapur, Kheri, Hardoi, Pratapgarh and Lucknow in Awadh, and Mirzapur and Lalitpur in southern Uttar Pradesh. The western Bansphor speak Khari boli, while those in Awadh speak Awadhi. A section of the Bansphor in Saharanpur and Moradabad have converted to Islam, and now form a distinct community of Muslim Bansphor. Present circumstances The Bansphor practice strict community endogamy, as well as clan exogamy, which a common practice among most North Indian Hindus. Their clans are called gotras, the main ones being the Mahawati, Chamkel, Gaushal, Samudra, Nahar, Kalai and Saraiha. Marriages do not occur with the Muslim Bansphor community. The Bansphor live in multi-caste villages, but occupy their own distinct quarters. Each of their settlement contains an informal caste council, known as a panchayat. The panchayat is headed by a pradhan, a position which is heredity. In addition, there is an overarching panchayat of between three and four villages, which headed by a chaudhary. The panchayat resolves any intra- community dispute, as well as acting an instrument of social control. They are Hindus, except for the now-distinct community of Muslim Bansphor, and have Hanuman as their tribal deity. The Bansphor are still involved in their traditional occupation, which is the manufacture of bamboo furniture. These are then sold at the local market. A significant number of Bansphor are agricultural labourers, while other often migrating to Mumbai and Delhi to work as daily wage labourers. Like other scheduled caste communities, they live an extremely marginal economic existence. The 2011 Census of India for Uttar Pradesh showed the Bansphor population as 59,804.

The series follows the adventures of Cole MacGrath, Delsin Rowe and Abigail 'Fetch' Walker, super-powered 'Conduits' who must decide their own destinies of becoming either good or evil. The series includes Infamous, its sequel Infamous 2, the non-canon downloadable game called Infamous: Festival of Blood, the DC Comics comic book series of the same name, the third main entry for Infamous Second Son and a stand-alone expansion Infamous First Light. Setting The series takes place in the present-day United States with real and alternate versions of real cities; such as the setting of Infamous, Empire City, which resembles New York City; and the setting of Infamous 2, New Marais, which resembles New Orleans (Infamous: Festival of Blood also takes place in this city). Washington, D.C. is occasionally mentioned, and Infamous Second Son takes place in Seattle. It features an American government agencies such as the FBI, NSA and DARPA, along with agencies fabricated for the series, such as the DUP (Department of Unified Protection), an agency with the sole purpose of stopping conduits, now labeled \\"bio-terrorists\\", from causing mass destruction similar to what was caused by Cole MacGrath. Gameplay Gameplay in the Infamous series is primarily an action-adventure third-person view platformer type across an open world environment. In the first two games and the spin-offs, the player controls Cole MacGrath, later in the third game as Delsin Rowe and Abigail 'Fetch' Walker, as they freely roam around the city, fighting crime or creating havoc along the way. Cole, Delsin, and Fetch can use their parkour skills to jump and climb buildings throughout the city, along with their powers to help them fight enemies. Their powers come from a gauge which depletes whenever they uses various attacks, and refills when they absorb electricity or smoke, neon, video and concrete from nearby objects or bodies, such as street lights, nearby smoke sources,(such as vents or burning cars) or neon lights or video appliances or bodies of the DUP. Morality, or Karma, is a major factor in the gameplay and storyline. The player is able to control the course of the game by having Cole and Delsin use their powers for good or evil. The choice allows the player to have a different mixture of abilities, as both good and evil have their own set of powers. The game also uses a Karma meter which changes based on the main character's actions throughout the game and determines whether he eventually becomes a good or evil character.  Games  =Main game= * Infamous is the first game in the series, released in 2009 to rave reviews by the gaming press. Set in 2009, The game explains the origins of Cole MacGrath, a bike courier, who gained his electrical-based superpowers after surviving a large explosion in Empire City caused by the package he was carrying containing the Ray Sphere. The Ray Sphere is an object of great power as it is able to consume the energy of the people around the user and transfer that energy to the user, making him immensely powerful at the cost of thousands of lives. After the explosion, the city was quarantined by the government causing organized crime groups within the city to seize control of Empire City from the local authorities. The game follows Cole's journey to obtain the Ray Sphere in order to escape from the quarantine as part of a deal he made with an FBI agent during his failed escape attempt at the start of the game. Cole eventually obtains the Ray Sphere and the player is given the choice to either destroy it or use it. Regardless of the choice, Cole will eventually come face to face with Kessler, the leader of The First Sons, the organized crime group in the city who had seized control of the city after the quarantine. Kessler duels Cole in a battle to the death and it is eventually revealed after Kessler is mortally wounded that he is in reality a version of Cole from the future of an alternate timeline. Kessler reveals his motive for the events throughout the game telling Cole that he was preparing Cole for an eventual battle against an entity known as \\"The Beast\\" who had destroyed Kessler's world. He had set the events of the game into motion by ordering the construction of the Ray Sphere as well as passing it to Cole for him to cause the explosion. The game ends when Kessler dies and Cole proclaims, \\"When the time comes, I will be ready.\\" * Infamous 2 is the second game in the series, released in June 2011 as a followup to the first game's story, taking place a month afterward. The game follows the adventure of Cole once again as he escapes to the city of New Marais after the events of the first game to prepare himself for the eventual battle with \\"The Beast\\" (a powerful being that obliterated Empire City and much of the Eastern Seaboard of the U.S). New Marais was the location for the construction of the Ray Sphere and where Cole believes he will find more answers to the events of the first game. However, the city has been taken over by the Militia, who are controlled by an influential industrialist, while the city is being rampaged by beings known as the corrupted who became mutated by the leader of the Militia. The Militia's goal is to keep anything mutated or with superpowers out of the city which unfortunately includes Cole. Thus he must traverse the city fighting against both the Militia and the Corrupted to learn more about Kessler, the Ray Sphere and \\"The Beast\\". * Infamous: Festival of Blood: is a downloadable side story for Infamous 2. It takes place sometime during the story of the main game but never tells the player exactly when. Zeke is telling the story of what happened to Cole MacGrath during Pyre Night to an attractive woman while sitting in a bar. Cole goes underneath St. Ignatius' Cathedral and is bitten by a vampire, and only has til morning to kill the vampire that bit him, Bloody Mary, or he'll be her slave forever. The game takes place all during the night, and introduces new elements, like flight, into the game. User-generated content (UGC) remains, but UGC from Infamous 2 and vice versa cannot be accessed. The Karma System was replaced by a blood meter, which fills as Cole drinks blood from civilians or stake vampires. It was originally rated Mature by the ESRB for its copious amounts of blood, which was eventually trimmed down to a minimum, giving it a teen rating. It came out on October 25, 2011, and was the best selling PlayStation Network game, until Journey launched. * Infamous Second Son was released on March 21, 2014, based seven years after the events of the second installment, in 2016. This focuses on a new character, Delsin Rowe, a graffiti artist who absorbs the power from other prime conduits. After his initial meeting with Henry \\"Hank\\" Daughtry early in the story, he absorbs Hank's power which is smoke and fire. After another prime conduit, Augustine, starts killing the residents of Delsin's hometown, he and his brother Reggie go to Seattle to find Augustine, absorb her concrete power, and save the Akomish back home. * Infamous First Light is a prequel to Second Son. The game takes place in 2014, two years before the events of Second Son and follows the story of Abigail \\"Fetch\\" Walker and her neon powers. Fetch had an accident with her powers that changed her life, hating drug dealer Shane for tricking her. Due to that, she was incarcerated in Curdun Cay Station and trained by Brooke Augustine so that she could \\"Learn how to control them\\". While practicing she escapes and ventures off, hunting Shane. = Web browser games = * Infamous: Precinct Assault is a browser Flash game. It was released in 2009 to promote the first game in the series, Infamous. The game is a 2D side-scrolling platformer video game played from a third person perspective. Unlike the main games, players must choose whether they want to use their powers for bad or for good before the game starts. The game consists of three levels. * Infamous: Anarchy is a spin-off game on Facebook, released along with Infamous 2. The game allows players to make a custom avatar, build their own city, help friends expand their cities, fight enemy players, and others. The game has since been updated with more features such as screenshot taking and competition among players. When players reached an unknown criteria, they are rewarded with a code that can be used to unlock additional items in Infamous 2. =Infamous Collection= The Infamous Collection is a collection of Infamous, Infamous 2, and Infamous: Festival of Blood, bundled together as part of Sony's line of PlayStation Collections for PlayStation 3. The collection, along with the God of War Saga and the Ratchet & Clank Collection, were the first releases in Sony's line, being released on August 28, 2012 in North America. The games feature the same features as their original releases. In addition to the games, the collection features bonus content, including extra missions, and additional character costumes, power ups and weapon styles. Other media =Comics= The Infamous comic is a one-part comic, released in March 2011, and was published by DC Comics, in association with Sucker Punch, to coincide with the release of the second game in 2011. The comics take place in between the events of the first and the second game, showing how Cole escapes from Empire City to New Marais. The comic series was written by William Harms and drawn by Eric Nguyen, and also includes covers drawn by Doug Mahnke. A graphic novel titled Infamous: Post Blast was released on IGN, depicting the events that lead up to the events of Infamous. There currently are four comics, each focusing on both Cole MacGrath and John White. The story of the comics takes place between the Introduction and First Glimpse. =Film= On July 25, 2009 it was announced that Sony had chosen screenwriter Sheldon Turner to adapt Infamous into a feature film in a seven figure deal. Brothers Ari and Avi Arad will produce, and Sony executives Matt Tolmach and Jonathan Kadin are handling for the studio. Turner told The Hollywood Reporter he was excited that the game had a \\"big idea and a character arc,\\" which he believed was \\"the future of gaming.\\" He believed the game was essentially \\"a love ballad to the underachiever\\".

In the Norwegian foreign policy discourse he has been a proponent of limited government, a free market economy, and social conservatism. He has been a spokesman for a strong defense and close ties to U.S. foreign policy. Toje is considered to belong to the same intellectual tradition as Francis Fukuyama.  Academic career  Asle Toje was educated at universities in Oslo and Troms√∏ before going on to study international relations (Dr. Phil.) at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 2006. He studied under Kenneth Waltz when he stayed as Fulbright Fellow by Columbia University 2004-2005 and was research associate at the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies 2007-2008. In 2008, Toje was a visiting scholar at the European Union Institute for Security Studies in Paris. As an academic, Toje is best known for having developed \\"transatlantic bargain\\" thesis where he argues that the United States 's presence through the NATO and European integration in the shape of EU is an integrated complex. Geir Lundestad wrote \\"A thoroughly enjoyable read\\".

This changed after a mountaineering accident in 1997 shattered both legs and broke his back. He fell an estimated 180 meters on Kval√∏ya.

Based on the life of Korean independence fighter Lee Hoe-yeong, the drama was made to commemorate the centenary of the Forced Annexation of Korea by Japan. Its premiere coincided with the signing of the annexation treaty on August 21, 1910, and the drama aired on KBS1 from August 29 to September 12, 2010 on Saturdays and Sundays at 21:05 for 5 episodes. This was the third and last of the \\"noblesse oblige\\" series produced by KBS in 2010, following The Reputable Family and The Great Merchant. At the end of the drama, a short documentary about Lee Hoe-young aired, including an interview with his sons, Lee Kyu-chang and Lee Kyu-dong. Synopsis When Japan invaded Korea, Lee Hoe-young donated all of his savings and moved to Manchuria to open a school. There, he trained soldiers and scholars who later led the army to win numerous battles during the early 20th century. Lee also joined the underground anarchist movement in Shanghai to fight against Japanese forces. Lee later died in prison after being captured and tortured by the Japanese army. The drama begins from the point of view of Japanese war correspondent Kimura Junpei, who is writing his report \\"Lee Hoe-young, the Terrorist.\\" But as he delves into the life of Lee, he comes to understand and admire Lee Hoe-young as a freedom fighter who led the Korean independence movement.

Korean Pine Valley) is a nature reserve (gosudarstvenny prirodny biosferny zapovednik) on the territory of Khasansky District in the south of Primorsky Krai, Russia. As of 2011, it occupies an area of , about one thousandth of the total area of Primorsky Krai. Topography Kedrovaya Pad is at the coastal spurs of the Manchurian mountains. The reserve's boundaries approach Barabashevka River (until 1973 Mongugay or Bolshoy Mongugay) in the northeast, and Narva River (until 1973 Sidimi) in the southwest. In the southeast, the Far Eastern Railway separates it from Amur Bay which is less than 5 km away. In the northwest, the A189 (AH6) road separates it from the Chyornye Gory range, whose watershed defines the Sino- Russian border and is less than 20 km away. Sukhorechensky Ridge covers the southern half of the reserve, reaching at Gora Uglovaya (or Zapretnaya) in the west. North of it, Kedrovaya River forms a gorge as it flows east from its source in the western part of the reserve. While some kind of nature protection measures have been in effect in the area since 1916, the reserve was officially established in 1925, making it the oldest nature reserve in the Russian Far East. Ecoregion and climate The reserve is located in the Manchurian mixed forests ecoregion. The climate is Humid continental climate, warm summer subtype (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dwb)). Flora and fauna The nature of the reserve is unique in a sense that its high biodiversity represents an overlap of southern (subtropical forests) and northern (coniferous-broadleaf forests) species and animals. Some of the species endemic to the area include the Siberian tiger, Amur leopard, and Asian black bear.

Noise-domain reflectometry, like time-domain and spread- spectrum time domain reflectometers, is most often used in identifying the location of wire faults in electrical lines. Time-domain reflectometers work by generating a signal and then sending that signal down the wireline and examining the reflected signal. Noise-domain reflectometers (NDRs) provide the benefit of locating wire faults without introducing an external signal because the NDR examines the existing signals on the line to identify wire faults. This technique is particularly useful in the testing of live wires where data integrity on the wires is critical. For example, NDRs can be used for monitoring aircraft wiring while in flight.

Early life  Mirrie Irma Jaffa Hill was born on 1 December 1889 in Randwick, Australia. She was the youngest of three, born to Levien Jaffa Solomon and Kate Caroline. She had a good ear early on, detecting dissonance and running out of the room whenever her aunt would play Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words. Hill studied composition with Alfred Hill, who would later become her husband, at Shirley School, Edgecliff. With Alfred Hill as conductor, Godfrey Smith and the Sydney Amateur Orchestral Society performed Mirrie Hill's first orchestral work, Rhapsody for Piano and Orchestra, in 1914 at the Sydney Town Hall. Hill was unable to study in Germany because of World War I, so she instead went to the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music, where she was awarded a scholarship by the director, Henri Verbrugghen. Career After finishing her schooling at the Conservatorium in 1918, Hill was made assistant-professor of harmony, counterpoint and composition there. After retiring from the Conservatorium in 1944, Hill worked as an examiner for the Australian Music Examinations Board from 1959 to 1966. Hill's exploration into music inspired by the indigenous peoples of Australia, started when anthropologist Charles P. Mountford asked Hill to compose the score for the film he was making about Aboriginal life. For inspiration, Mountford gave Hill recordings he had made of performances of indigenous Australian songs. Hill drew from these recordings for both her suite Three Aboriginal Dances and Arnhem Land Symphony. Although the indigenous songs influenced Hill's Symphony, she has explained that the symphony was not meant to be specifically Aboriginal in its make-up. Mirrie Hill described her own music as \\"not [in] the very modern idiom but entirely individual as to style and content.\\" Hill composed in many different genres, but her favorite was classical orchestra music. She created over five hundred pieces throughout her life, spanning from chamber music and film scores to elementary works for children. Although she did create many longer pieces of music for orchestra and ensembles, Hill became known as a miniaturist because a great deal of her published works were short.  Personal life  In 1921, she married her previous teacher, Alfred Hill who had three children from a previous marriage. Hill never had any children of her own. They were married in Mosman, New South Wales, and built a home there, where they lived for most of their lives. Due to the fact that Alfred Hill was such a recognized composer, Mirrie Hill's work was often overlooked as she took a back-seat to her husband's career. She was described by the people around her as a shy and happy person; she put her husband's career before her own for most of her life. Hill was given greater recognition for her works after her husband's death. In 1975 she was made a life member of the Fellowship of Australian Composers and in 1980 was appointed an OBE (Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire). Works Hill composed for orchestra, chamber ensemble, choral pieces, film scores, songs and solo instrumental works. She often incorporated Aboriginal themes and traditional Jewish melodies. Selected works include: * Rhapsody for Piano and Orchestra (1914) * The Leafy Lanes of Kent (1950) * Three miniature pieces for the piano * Three Aboriginal Dances (Brolga, The Kunkarankara Women, Nalda of the Echo) (1950) * Arnhem Land symphony (1954) Her works have been recorded and issued on CD, including: * Dance of the Wild Men - Early 20th Century Australian Piano Music Artworks Additional works include: * Meditation (1954) * March of a Robot (1973) * Dance of the Cunning Mouse (1973) * My Bird Sings (1973) * Merry Imp (1976) * Come Summer (1969) * Three Nice Mice (1970) * Pipe Reel (1970) * Child Fantasies (1935) * Garden Sketches (1934) * Mr. Roo (1948) * Bell Birds (1952) * The Dancing Fawn (1969) * Party Tunes (1957) * All In a Day (1950) * Three Highland Tunes (1971) * Dancing Feet (1950) * Willow Wind (1973) * Lost- my little black puppy: he scampers away (1949) * For Hire (1949) * Dreams (1942) * Waltz (1942)  See also  * Alfred Hill (composer) * List of Australian women composers References  Further reading  * 1889 births 1986 deaths 20th-century classical composers Australian music educators Jewish classical composers Australian female classical composers Australian Jews Musicians from Sydney University of Sydney alumni Sydney Conservatorium of Music faculty Australian classical composers Hill-McIndoe-Gillies family Women music educators Australian Officers of the Order of the British Empire 20th- century women composers ","title":"Mirrie Hill"},{"id":"30141070","text":"The Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Dera Ghazi Khan is a government body located in the Chowk Sarwar Wali.

Fraser was the biographer of the Scottish artist, Horatio McCulloch.Scottish Landscape: The Life and Works of Horatio Macculloch, photographed by T.

The British Library and other catalogues are mistaken in attributing it to his father. Cf. British Library catalogue at www.bl.uk.

Fraser's mother was Jessie Moir.Births, marriages and deaths information available at the General Register Office for Scotland, Scotlands People Centre in Edinburgh, and also at http://scotlandspeople.gov.uk His education began in Glasgow but he had most of his schooling at Lanark Grammar School, exhibiting frequently at the Glasgow Institute of Fine Arts. From there he went on to study art at the Trustees Academy Edinburgh. By the age of thirty he was already an Associate of the Royal Scottish Academy. He married Jane Duncan on 15 April 1859 in Edinburgh and they had a son and daughter. He died on 24 May 1899 at Musselburgh.  Career  According to Edward Pinnington's biography of Fraser, he was brought up at Dunoon on the coast of Argyll, and in an unfinished autobiography, he described his early passion for art: :\\"At an early age I evinced a taste for art, covering every scrap of paper I laid hands on (as indeed most children do) with drawings of horses and boats. When lost ‚Äî a matter of frequent occurrence ‚Äî I was usually found at a pit on the seashore, busily modelling in clay, often with a shell lying before me to copy from. Thus early had a taste to work from nature shewn itself.\\"Edward Pinnington, 'Alexander Fraser, R.S.A.' The Art Journal, London: Virtue & Co., 1904, pp. 375‚Äì379. His father's paints, oils, palettes and brushes were \\"the tools of childhood\\" and not surprisingly he resolved that \\"I will be a painter, and nothing else.\\" About 1847, he went to Edinburgh and enrolled at the Trustees' Academy (which later became Edinburgh College of Art) under Thomas Duncan. From 1849-53 he attended the life school of the Royal Scottish Academy. His first commission dates from about 1850.' In 1858 he was elected an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy and became an academician in 1862. He took up residence permanently in 1880 where he was doing his best work, most of it being done at the Royal Scottish Academy.

He changed his name to Jim Jumani Immanuel Masauko Kamuzu Banda. Johansson says that it was after Banda died in 1997 that 'some government officials' told him about who his father really was. Officially, Banda died childless and unmarried. His claim and resemblance to the former dictator opened up many unanswered questions about the legacy of Banda. Johansson became a celebrity overnight in Malawi owing to his uncanny resemblance to the former president and his measures to seek legal means of proving his identity. Malawians were divided on whether he was the true heir but the public demanded a right to know as well. Focus Gwede, the head of Banda's Special Branch of Secret Police Services, came out in support of Johansson, claiming in 2010 that Banda had fathered three children. Paternity claims =Muhammad Jogee = Johansson's adoptive mother, Miriam Kaunda, claims that Jumani's father is Muhammad Jogee, an Indian-Malawian living outside of Malawi. Jogee, or proof of his existence, however, cannot be located. Banda's family also claim that Jogee is the real father. =Kamuzu Banda= Johansson went to the cabinet to have his name changed officially to Jim Jumani Immanuel Masauko Kamuzu Banda and this was legally granted by the courts, who stated that he had the right to call himself any name he wanted in spite of attempts to block this move by the Banda family. Preliminary DNA testing Kamuzu‚Äôs DNA was secretly taken from the College of Medicine for the purpose of preliminary tests with the help of an unnamed Malawian doctor. Preliminary DNA tests conducted in a private lab in South Africa show that Jim Jumani Johansson was the biological son of Kamuzu Banda. Jumani was still seeking official DNA testing with permission of the Banda estate to prove or disprove his paternity, up until his death. Maternity claims Banda was not known to be in any relationships that resulted in heirs, but there is evidence of affairs which have mainly been kept confidential. =Cecilia Kadzamira= The official hostess was Cecilia Kadzamira, but it is believed it was not a sexual relationship by Malawian historians like John Lwanda. According to Lwanda, Kadzamira cannot be the mother. =Merene French= There is also the relationship with a married British confidant, Merene French, with whom Banda had an affair. =Miriam Kaunda= Miriam Kaunda raised Johansson, but Jumani insisted that she was not his mother, notably due to her refusal to take a DNA test for maternity. Kaunda continues to insist that Banda was not Johannson's father. Court case Although Johansson was seeking a high court to order DNA testing, Banda‚Äôs family denied the use of DNA samples to prove or disprove the claim. Banda‚Äôs family was skeptical about his claims because of the property claims that his heritage would mean. A grand-niece of Dr. Banda, Jane Dzanjalimodzi, noted that ‚Äúmany people will come out of the woodwork to make claims because they know Banda‚Äôs vast estate is about to be distributed‚Äù. In tense court battles, they have attempted to block Johansson from legally changing his name to Kamuzu Banda, and from visiting the family estates. The family also claims that Johansson was a Swede and not a Malawian citizen and could not make any claims in Malawian courts without paying court costs. Jumani, however, wanted court-supervised DNA testing where both himself and family representatives were present. Lawyers from the Centre for Human Rights and Rehabilitation (CHRR) were hired to assist late Jumani in his claims. Presidential threats and arrest Johansson was arrested for asking a presidential guard (at the private residence of the president, Kamazu Palace) why he was protecting a ‚Äòstupid‚Äô president (Bingu wa Mutharika) who ‚Äòkilled people‚Äô and for then adding that he could ‚Äòkill Mutharika‚Äô himself which was seen as a threat against the president. He was defended by Zeros Matumba in first grade magistrate Richard Gomani‚Äôs court. He was granted bail against the wishes of the police, and his hearing was adjourned until September 21, 2011. Deportation from Malawi On September 27, 2011, immigration authorities took Johansson in for overstaying his allotted time in the country and started processing his deportation. According to The Nation which broke the Jumani story, he acquired a Swedish passport after his adoption by his step-father, Matt Johansson. Johansson was deported on September 28, 2011, for overstaying his visit in Malawi. He had a Malawian passport and had applied for reinstatement of his Malawian citizenship His lawyer, Zeros Matumba, had been trying to fight his deportation. Death On January 26, 2019 it was reported that Jumani had died. There is considerable suspicion as to the cause of his death. He was 45.

Flight operations were switched to the coast city of Mombasa, to serve the newly growing coast tourism industry and the company name was changed to Mombasa Air Services. During the seventies, eighties and nineties, Mombasa was restricted by existent colonial legislation, from receiving international scheduled services, which were all directed to the capital city of Nairobi. During the seventies and eighties, the Kenya coast was a recently discovered exotic tourism destination and direct charter flights from Europe grew rapidly and many new beach hotels were built to receive an increasing number of tourist arrivals from Europe. During the colonial era, a number of large land areas were set aside as wildlife conservancies under the protection of the Kenya Game Department, which, after independence, became the Kenya Wildlife Service. Kenya is known as the birthplace of the safari, an expedition or journey into the bush to see and shoot wildlife. These adventures were made famous by the rich and famous that included, in 1909, the former American President Theodore Roosevelt. Hunting, however became banned, and the growing global realization of the value of protecting wildlife, coupled with long range jet travel meant that the Kenya coast, with unspoilt tropical beaches close to world-famous wildlife parks, generated a steady demand for local tourist flights to visit the game parks. MAS grew a fleet of piston engined aircraft to handle the local charter demand to game parks and other places of tourist interest. At its peak the charter firm had 12 aircraft, some owned and some leased. All the aircraft were maintained by CMC Aviation owned by the publicly traded Cooper Motor Corporation. To provide capital and purchase larger, more reliable turbo-prop aircraft to operate scheduled services, the firm was sold to CMC who subsequently sold to the Sameer Group and the operations moved to Nairobi. The purchase of turbo-prop aircraft did not occur at that time, and the start up of domestic scheduled tourist services from Mombasa to the game parks was delayed until the nineties.

Many of the structures have historic designations on a state or national level. The Gillespie County Historical Society is actively involved in assisting with preservation. On October 14, 1970, the Fredericksburg Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in Texas. Sunday Houses The Sunday Houses are unique to the German immigrant culture of the Texas Hill Country. In reverse of the old European tradition of living in town while working the rural farms, the early Fredericksburg German settlers made their main homes on the acreage they worked. On their town lots, they erected Sunday Houses for overnight stays on their weekly travels into town for supplies and church attendance. Older generations would use the houses as a retirement house, as the younger generations inherited the acreage and the work. These houses were often made of limestone rock coated with whitewash inside and out. Depending on the individual family's need, these relatively small 2-story houses were designed for limited stays, with one or two ground floor rooms and an upper loft for sleeping. Standard design was a fireplace and a porch. Often there was an outside staircase leading to the loft. Many of these homes in Fredericksburg have been restored, with some of them being used as Bed and Breakfast retreats.

Jonze also served as producer along with Vincent Landay and Marcy Page. Higglety Pigglety Pop! or There Must Be More to Life was produced by the National Film Board of Canada in association with Warner Home Video. It is based on the 1967 children's book of the same name written and illustrated by Maurice Sendak about the fictional adventures of his pet dog Jennie. Plot A Sealyham Terrier named Jennie leaves a comfortable life and embarks on a journey for new experiences and stardom. Production An associate of Jonze had been impressed by Lavis and Szczerbowski's previous work, the animated short Madame Tutli-Putli and suggested to the director that they would be suitable to create a short companion piece for the Blu-ray release of Where the Wild Things Are. Jonze contacted the animators while he was in France promoting Synecdoche, New York and the two met after, with Jonze proposing that they create a film based on some other short story by Sendak. Unfamiliar with Sendak's work, the filmmakers researched his work and settled on Higglety Pigglety Pop! as their choice to adapt. The film is set in 17 different locations, with a total of 25 scenes. With just 10 months to create the entire film, the filmmakers could not use stop-motion or any of their traditional animation techniques. They decided instead to primarily make use of puppetry, combined with some stop- motion. Meryl Streep, who voiced Jennie, was not yet cast when shooting had begun. Sendak provided Lavis and Szczerbowski with an old recording of Streep reading the book, doing all the voices, and the filmmakers were impressed. They approached her with the part and she agreed. Lavis and Szczerbowski's previous work Madame Tutli-Putli had received the Genie Award for Best Animated Short and been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short. Release Higglety Pigglety Pop! or There Must Be More to Life had its world premiere at the Montreal Children's International Film Festival on February 28, 2010. It was then released along with the Blu-ray edition of Jonze's Where the Wild Things Are, released on March 2, 2010. The film received two Golden Sheaf Awards, for Best Director (Fiction) and Best Children's and Youth Production, at the 2011 Yorkton Film Festival.

The association's first offices were located in Texas and, in 1962, IEC was granted a certificate of incorporation. IEC convinced the U.S. Department of Labor to adopt national pattern standards of Apprenticeship and Training. And for the first time, registered apprenticeship was recognized across the country for those adopting the \\"Open Shop\\" philosophy. In subsequent years, IEC has grown into a 50-chapter association, representing over 3,300 members and nearly 90,000 electrical workers. IEC has expanded its alliance to include over 10,000 apprentices who are currently in the process of learning to become prominent and productive electricians.

The beach is relatively young in the region. After the retreating glacier and the gradual warming of the climate around c.8,000 BC, the whole area was first covered by tundra. Along with the rise of temperature, the flora of the tundra gave way to new forest ecosystems in which most prominent were birches (Betula), pines (Pinus) and hazel (Corylus). The ecosystem of the primeval forest changed again with additional, warmer (stenothermic) varieties entering the landscape, including aspen (Populus tremula), elm tree (Ulmus), oak (Quercus) and ash tree (Fraxinus). In spite of the scarcity of tourist trails, Puszcza Dar≈ºlubska, is also a good recreational area with many natural, historical and cultural artifacts and various points of interest for the visitors.

She was born in Santpoort, Netherlands, and studied piano with Thom Bollen at the Zwolle Conservatory. She continued her studies in composition at the Amsterdam Conservatory with Ton de Leeuw, and worked in the electronic studio at the Conservatory. In 1985 she ended her studies and received a Prize for Composition. After completing her education, Hoenderdos worked as a composer and taught music privately and at the music school in Zwolle. After 1987 she worked as full-time as a composer. Composition style Hoenderdos‚Äô works are characterized by a rigorous methodological approach rarely encountered in contemporary Dutch music; a ‚Äúradical research into the essence of sound‚Äù. The relationships between various aspects of sound determine the structure of her works, creating not abstract but vital, colourful and even obstinate music. Hoenderdos does not let her emotions or experiences influence her compositions. Since the early 1990s her exclusion of non-musical factors is also reflected in her titles, which are simply the month and year in which they were written. Es verj√ºngt sich nach unten for right hand piano solo (1983) is based on the relationship between tempo and density. In Lex inertiae no.2 for solo viola (1989), the left hand has little to do while the right hand concentrates on various techniques. De lussen van Favery (1990) is Hoenderdos‚Äô response to poetry by Hans Favery that he specifically asked her to set to music. Instead of creating a traditional song cycle to Favery‚Äôs words, she created a woodwind quintet, framed as nine short movements. Maart ‚Äò98 (1998), for string quartet, relies heavily on uncoordinated glissandi of varying speeds, leaving the ear unsure whether a subtly coloured and delicate twine is taking form or steadily unravelling. Juli ‚Äò06 (2006), scored for unaccompanied soprano voice, is inspired by a poem written by Hoenderdos‚Äô partner Bas Geerts, in reaction to rhetoric from the White House, specifically President George Bush‚Äôs 2003 State of the Union speech. It incorporates a mix of languages and is challenging to perform. Works Performed Oerknal, a collective of international musicians based in The Netherlands, presented a program of string quartets called ‚ÄúSongs and Labyrinths‚Äù for their 2017-18 season, featuring Hoenderdos‚Äô September ‚Äò00, a ten-minute collage of delicate gestures and vertical sound blocks at once meditative and fleeting. Reception In response to works by Hoenderdos including De Lussen Van Favarey (1990), Maart ‚Äò98 (1998) and Juli ‚Äò06 (2006, text: Bas Geerts), Samuel Vriezen said, ‚ÄúBy their networks of structures these pieces create ambiguous labyrinths in which a striking music is hiding in plain sight.

The \\"Blood Qur'an\\" is a copy of the Islamic holy book, the Qur'an, claimed to have been written in the blood of the former president of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, over the course of two years in the late 1990s. Saddam commissioned the book in 1997 on his 60th birthday, reportedly to give thanks to God for helping him through many \\"conspiracies and dangers\\". He explained his reasons for commissioning the book in a letter published by the Iraqi state media in September 2000: \\"My life has been full of dangers in which I should have lost a lot of blood ... but since I have bled only a little, I asked somebody to write God's words with my blood in gratitude.\\"\\"Iraqi leader's Koran 'written in blood'.

Arabic News, 26 September 2000 and, after his fall from power in 2003, the Qur'an was removed from public display. Controversy persists over how much blood Saddam contributed to the project, or whether any of it is even his at all. The fate of the book also presented heavy controversies, since for islamic laws writing the Qur'an in blood is considered a blasphemous heresy, but so would be destroying the Qur'an even if to cleanse such a blasphemy.Blair, David. \\"Saddam has Koran written in his blood\\".

The Sydney Morning Herald, 18 December 2003 Production and display The book was produced by Abbas Shakir Joudi (Joody), an Islamic calligrapher who now lives in Virginia in the United States. According to his version of events, over the course of two years, Saddam donated 24‚Äì27 litres (50 to 57 pints) of his blood, which was used by Joudi to copy the 6,000 verses and some 336,000 words of the Qur'an.Chulov, Martin. \\"Qur'an etched in Saddam Hussein's blood poses dilemma for Iraq leaders\\". The Guardian, 19 December 2010 According to Joudi, Saddam Hussein summoned him to Ibn Sƒ´nƒÅ hospital in Baghdad, where his son Uday was recovering from an assassination attempt, and asked him to write out the Qur'an from his blood as \\"a sort of vow from Saddam's side\\".Saddam orders to write the Koran from his blood \\". Arabic News, 5 February 2004. The work was handed over to Saddam in a ceremony in September 2000. It was subsequently put on display in the Umm al-Ma'arik (Mother Of All Battles) mosque in Baghdad, erected by Saddam to commemorate the 1990‚Äì91 Gulf War and designed with minarets in the shape of Scud missiles and Kalashnikov rifle barrels. Other reports have questioned the official Saddam Hussein government version of how much blood was donated in the making of the Qur'an (or if it was even Saddam's blood in the first place). Reporter Philip Smucker reported in Baghdad on July 29, 2001; \\"Most striking is the dubious and totally unverifiable claim that Saddam donated nearly 50 pints of his own blood for the writing of a Qur'an.\\" Smucker also wrote: \\"Western diplomats based in Baghdad are unimpressed with the Iraqi leader's religious devotion, dismissing the mosque and its holy book written in blood as a crude publicity stunt. 'How can we be sure this is Saddam's blood and not that of some of his victims?' one asked.\\" A subsequent news report also from UK's Telegraph newspaper, saw reporter David Blair in Baghdad state on December 14, 2002 regarding Saddam's infamous Blood Qur'an. \\"In fact, a skilled artist copied the 605 pages of the holy book using Saddam Hussein's blood. The former Iraqi president donated three pints over two years and this, mixed with chemicals, was used for every verse.\\" In December 2010 several news agencies published news articles regarding how Saddam's infamous Blood Qur'an has become a contentious issue in the delicate politics of today's Iraq. In one article Celso Bianco, the executive vice president for America's Blood Centers, noted the difficulty in believing the claim that Saddam donated 27 liters of blood in only a 2-year period; \\"The amount of donation allowed for a blood donor in the United States is five or six pints over the course of a year, or less than a gallon, Bianco said. At that safe rate, it should have taken Hussein nine years to donate all that blood, not two. 'It's an incredible amount, if that [number] is correct,' Bianco said. 'That certainly would have made him anemic.' \\" Given vastly different (contradicting) claims of the amount of blood Saddam Hussein allegedly donated towards the making of the infamous Blood Qur'an, and the dubious and unverifiable nature of the high end donation estimates just how much (if any) of Saddam Hussein's blood (allegedly mixed with chemicals and ink) is used in the infamous Blood Qur'an remains an open, debatable, and difficult to answer question. The Blood Qur'an was displayed in a hexagonal marble building set on an artificial lake within the mosque complex. Only invited visitors could view it, as the building was normally locked and off-limits.Blair, David. \\"Saddam has Koran written in his blood\\". The Daily Telegraph, 14 December 2002McGeough, Paul. \\"Storm over tyrant's unholy blood\\". The Sydney Morning Herald, 18 December 2003 According to Australian journalist Paul McGeough, who saw a page from the Blood Qur'an, \\"the blood lettering is about two centimetres tall and the broad decorative borders are dazzling ‚Äì blues, light and dark; spots of red and pink; and swirling highlights in black.\\" The Guardian's Martin Chulov describes it as \\"an exquisitely crafted book that would take its place in any art exhibition ‚Äì if it wasn't for the fact that it was written in blood.\\" After the fall of Saddam Umm al-Ma'arik (now Umm al-Qura) mosque, where the Blood Qur'an was put on display during the Saddam era. Following the fall of Baghdad to US-led forces in April 2003, the custodians of the mosque put the Blood Qur'an into storage for safekeeping. The demise of Saddam left the Iraqi religious and secular authorities with the dilemma of what should be done with the relics of his rule. Ali al-Moussawi, a spokesman for the prime minister, Nour al-Maliki, underscores this dilemma saying, \\"Not everything built during this regime we should remove. There were some sculptures however that were solely about dictatorship and control over Iraq. Some spoke to dictators and battles, and they should be removed. They have ethnic and sectarian meanings.\\" The Shia-run government does not want to see the re-emergence of symbols of the Saddam regime and has established a committee to supervise their removal. Some former opponents of Saddam, such as Ahmed Chalabi, have argued for the destruction of all Saddam-era monuments and symbols on the grounds that they are \\"a clear reminder of the consequences of totalitarianism and idealising a person that embodies evil\\". Others, such as Mowaffak al-Rubaie, argue that Iraqis \\"need to remember [the Saddam era], all what is bad and what is good and learn lessons.\\" The Iraqi Prime Minister's spokesman Ali al-Moussawi has proposed that the Blood Qur'an should be kept \\"as a document for the brutality of Saddam, because he should not have done this. It says a lot about him.\\" However, he said that it should never be displayed in a museum as no Iraqi would want to see it, but it could perhaps be held in a private museum like Hitler or Stalin memorabilia.

Wright made several promotions for the series in 2003 at conventions. Wright even reserved production locations while working on a first script.

Conservation can focus on preserving diversity at genetic, species, community or whole ecosystem levels. This article will examine conservation at the species level, because mutualisms involve interactions between species. The ultimate goal of conservation at this level is to prevent the extinction of species. However, species conservation has the broader aim of maintaining the abundance and distribution of all species, not only those threatened with extinction (van Dyke 2008). Determining the value of conserving particular species can be done through the use of evolutionary significant units, which essentially attempt to prioritise the conservation of the species which are rarest, fastest declining, and most distinct genotypically and phenotypically (Moritz 1994, Fraser and Bernatchez 2001). Mutualisms can be defined as \\"interspecific interactions in which each of two partner species receives a net benefit\\" (Bronstein et al. 2004). Here net benefit is defined as, a short-term increase in inclusive fitness (IF). Incorporating the concept of genetic relatedness (through IF) is essential because many mutualisms involve the eusocial insects, where the majority of individuals are not reproductively active. The short-term component is chosen because it is operationally useful, even though the role of long-term adaptation is not considered (de Mazancourt et al. 2005). This definition of mutualism should be suffice for this article, although it neglects discussion of the many subtitles of IF theory applied to mutualisms, and the difficulties of examining short-term compared to long-term benefits, which are discussed in Foster and Wenselneers (2006) and de Mazancourt et al. (2005) respectively. Mutualisms can be broadly divided into two categories. Firstly, obligate mutualism, where two mutualistic partners are completely interdependent for survival and reproduction. Secondly, facultative mutualism, where two mutualistic partners both benefit from the mutualism, but can theoretically survive in each other's absence. Mutualisms are remarkably common, in fact all organisms are believed to be involved in a mutualism at some point during their lives (Bronstein et al. 2004). This is particularly likely to be true for the definition of mutualism adopted here, where herbivory can paradoxically be mutualistic, for example in a situation where a plant overcompensates by producing more biomass when grazed on. Therefore, any species identified as particularly important to conserve will probably have mutualistic partners. It is beyond the purview of this article to discuss all these mutualisms, so the focus will be on specifically animal- plant mutualisms. Mutualism coextinction A mutualism coextinction event is where a species goes extinct upon the loss of its mutualist (Koh et al. 2004). Models have attempted to predict when the breakdown of a mutualism leads to coextinction, because in this situation protecting the mutualism will be particularly important for conservation. These models are multi-dimensional, so examine complex networks of interactions, rather than just pairs of interacting species. This means that these models incorporate modelling the breakdown of obligate mutualisms (which lead directly to coextinction), but also the breakdown of facultative mutualisms (which can lead indirectly to coextinction). Koh et al. (2004) use a \\"nomographic model of affiliate extinctions\\", which estimates the probability that the extinction of a species leads to the extinction of its mutualist, for a given estimate of the specificity of the mutualism. By applying the model to actual species, Koh et al. (2004) estimate that 200 coextinctions have occurred since records of species extinction began in the past few centuries, and 6300 coextinctions are at risk of occurring in the near future. However, these estimates are not exclusively for mutualism coextinctions (e.g. parasitic coextinctions are incorporated), but mutualism coextinctions make up a significant proportion of the number quoted. Additionally the model predicts that these coextinctions can start extinction cascades, where many other species in the surrounding ecosystem go extinct. Other recent models largely agree with this one, predicting that mutualism coextinction is a very significant cause of species loss, and that it can lead to extinction cascades (Dunn et al. 2009). Surprisingly, given the model predictions, there are very few recorded examples of global mutualism coextinctions actually occurring (Bronstein et al. 2004, Dunn et al. 2009), and many examples often quoted are unconvincing on examination. For example, a well documented case of animal-plant coextinction and an extinction cascade involves a butterfly (Phengaris arion) to ant (Myrmica sabuleti) interaction. P. arion larvae provide honeydew for the M. sabuleti workers, which raise the caterpillars in their nest. When the Myxoma virus was introduced to control rabbit populations in the UK, the subsequent increase in grassland caused a decrease in soil temperatures at ground level. This caused reductions in the M. sabuleti populations, which led to the extinction of the P. arion populations (Dunn 2005). However, this is actually a relatively weak example, because it was a local (rather than a global) extinction, and the nature of the interaction is often not viewed as mutualistic, because it has been long known that the M. sabuleti caterpillars eat M. sabuleti larvae (Elmes and Thomas 1992). So, why are there very few documented examples of mutualism coextinctions? There are various possible reasons. Perhaps global mutualism coextinctions are genuinely uncommon, and the model predictions are inaccurate. The models may overestimate the specificity of the mutualisms, because species may only associate with alternative species when their 'normal' mutualist is rare or absent. For example, oligolectic bees visit a small number of flowers for pollen. However, these bees do not generally have strongly specialised anatomy, morphology or physiology. Therefore, in the absence of these usual flowers, many oligolectic bee species are able switch to collecting pollen from flower species they would never normally associate with (Wcislo and Cane 1996). Even some fig wasps, often considered to be in completely obligate relationships, have maintained low population densities when introduced to new areas without their natural mutualist fig tree species (McKey 1989). The models may also underestimate the robustness of the mutualisms. For example, fig trees and fig wasps are coadapted so that the wasps can find the trees from a long distances away (Bronstein et al. 1994). Alternatively, there may simply be many global mutualism coextinctions that have occurred which we are not yet aware of. This explanation is not unlikely, because mutualisms have generally been understudied as interactions (Bronstein 1994, Richardson et al. 2000). There is additionally the difficulty of defining when a species becomes globally extinct, compared to just extremely rare or maintained exclusively through captive breeding programs. Of course, these stated explanations are not mutually exclusive. However, more research is required to rectify the model predictions of many mutualism coextinctions, with the lack of empirical evidence for such events. Only then can we discover if conserving mutualisms is likely to prevent many global species extinction. Mutualism \\"codeclines\\" Even if global mutualism coextinctions are genuinely rare, conserving mutualisms may still be important for conservation. As mentioned previously, conservation is not just about preventing extinctions, but also about preventing species decline. Unlike with coextinctions, there are numerous recorded examples of where the decline or extinction of a species has led to the decline of its mutualist (\\"codeclines\\"). A documented example of a pollination mutualism breakdown leading to population declines is the Indian rubber tree (Ficus elastica) to its pollinator wasp (Pleistodontes clavigar) interaction. Habitat fragmentation has led to the F. elastica declining to very low population levels. However, F. Elastic can propagate clonally, so has remained extant. Meanwhile, P. clavigar is virtually extinct globally, because the mutualist relationship is probably obligate for P. clavigar (Mawsdley et al. 1998). An example of a seed dispersal mutualism breakdown causing population declines comes from two endemic species on Menorca Island. A frugivorous lizard (Podarcis lilfordi) is a seed disperser of a shrub (Daphne rodriguezii). When P. lilfordi became extinct on Menorca, due to the introduction of carnivorous mammals, D. rodriguezii numbers declined significantly to endangered levels. This D. rodriguezii decline could be attributed to the local extinction of P. lilfordi, due to the lack of seedling recruitment on Menorca compared to other nearby islands, where P. lilfordi remained extant and D. rodriguezii populations larger (Traveset and Riera 2005). However, in some cases it has been shown that declines of one partner in a mutualism do not lead to significant declines in the other. For example, a Hawaiian vine (Freycinetia arborea) was pollinated in the nineteenth century by four species of birds. These bird species are all now either locally endangered or extinct. Despite this, F. arborea continues to survive in reasonable abundance, but is now mainly pollinated by the recently introduced white-eye (Zosterops japonica) (Cox and Elmqvist 2000). In this case, conservation of the mutualism was not required to maintain the F. arborea population. There are probably no published estimates of how frequently declines of one species do not result in declines of that species' mutualist, due to a 'replacement' mutualist. However, judging by the few examples in the literature where this replacement has been reported to have happened, it seems to be a relatively rare occurrence. Alien species in mutualisms The Hawaiian vine example also illustrates that alien species can be involved in animal-plant mutualisms. In fact, alien species are often dependent on mutualisms to establish themselves in new habitats (particularly on islands), and especially those alien species requiring animal mediated pollination (Richardson et al. 2000). These alien species will, by definition, be beneficial to the short-term inclusive fitness of the species they form a mutualism with. However, the alien species will negatively impact other species in the ecosystem. For example, through competition for resources (including competition for mutualist partners) (Kaiser-Bunbury et al. 2009). In fact, these negative impacts could theoretically cascade through the ecosystem, and lead to the alien species having an indirect long-term negative impact on its mutualist. This means that mutualisms involving alien species is important in conservation. However, the action taken by a conservation organization could be either to conserve or disrupt the mutualism. In some situations, a conservation organization will want to conserve the mutualistic relationship. For example, many of the Hawaiian Islands have lost the vast majority of their native seed dispersers, and introduced bird species now act as very major seed dispersers of native species. In fact, these exotic species appear to actually facilitate the re-growth of native forests in some areas (Foster and Robinson 2007). In these situations, conserving the native mutualism may become less important than conserving the new one. Alien species involved in mutualisms may actually be desirable for conservationists to protect in a more general way. Alien species are particularly likely to generate highly generalised and asymmetric mutualisms, which help stabilise communities, making them less vulnerable to decline and extinctions (Aizen et al. 2008). In other situations, conservation will be facilitated by disrupting mutualisms involving alien species. For example, alien bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) have displaced many native pollinators, and pollinated some unwanted weed species, across the globe (Hingston et al. 2002). These mutualisms could lead to a decline in both animal and plant species of particular value to conservation. The empirical evidence would suggest that in the majority of cases a conservation organisation should try and disrupt the mutualisms involving the alien species (Kaiser-Bunbury et al. 2009).

Caldwell. George A. Caldwell, sometimes known as Big George Caldwell (August 24, 1892 - March 12, 1966), was a Louisiana building contractor and state official. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, he served as Superintendent for Construction at Louisiana State University, where he was known to \\"rake off 2 per cent of the cost of all building projects.\\" Caldwell managed the construction of nine buildings on the campus as federal Public Works Administration (PWA) projects in Baton Rouge. These included the university library and the structures housing the dairying and physics departments. He also built three parish courthouses, and numerous other major public projects during his career. In what were called the \\"Louisiana scandals\\", in 1939 Caldwell was indicted for misuse of PWA funds and pleaded guilty to federal charges. He was one of several top-ranking Louisiana leaders convicted and jailed in this scandal, including Governor Richard W. Leche. Sentenced to four years in prison in 1940, Caldwell was paroled in 1941. Later in the 1940s, he was pardoned by President Harry Truman. After that, Caldwell returned to business, getting commissions to construct public buildings, such as parish courthouses. Biography George A. Caldwell was born in 1892 Abbeville, the seat of government of Vermillion Parish in southwestern Louisiana, to Charlie Caldwell and the former Camille LeBlanc. He was reared Roman Catholic. After his parents died when he was young, George was cared for by his paternal uncle Summerfield \\"Summa\\" Caldwell, who had founded a contracting firm in Abbeville with two other brothers, Vernon and Tom. The latter was a master bricklayer. George became interested in the firm and started working there when young; he became its leader, as Summa's son was involved in other activities in New Orleans. Monte Hart also became a partner of Caldwell Brothers and Hart, which had a prominent role in Louisiana's major public building projects in the 1930s and for the next two decades. After getting his work underway, Caldwell married Zellie Belle Wahl.Kane, p. 231. In his total career, Caldwell built \\"twenty- six major buildings throughout the state, including six hospitals, East Baton Rouge Parish and Webster Parish courthouses; the Louisiana State Library; the Louisiana State University Library (Baton Rouge); the state highway department office building; five churches; two church youth centers; five schools; the Grambling University Science Building; and the dairy and physics buildings at LSU-Baton Rouge.\\" =Superintendent of Construction= In the 1930s, Caldwell was appointed as State Superintendent of Construction, during which time he completed several WPA projects at LSU. Governor Richard W. Leche had benefited by the late Senator Huey Long's alliance with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the state received funds from the Public Works Administration for major projects. Caldwell had a talent for organization and swift construction. Under his direction, the Panhellion, one of the Works Progress Administration projects on the LSU campus, was completed in thirty days. Another (Building \\"G\\") was completed in ten days. Neither is still standing. Investigations later revealed that Caldwell was keeping 2 percent of the funds budgeted for the construction projects at LSU.Kane, p. 281. He built a lavish mansion near the university; it was estimated to have cost $45,000, then a large amount of money.Kane, pp. 231-2. The mansion featured air conditioning, solid gold bathroom fixtures, and black marble floors, ceilings and walls. Caldwell's salary at the time was $6,000 annually. The New Orleans States newspaper began publishing expos√©s of the corruption scandals in early 1939. With state and federal investigations underway into what was called the \\"Louisiana Hayride\\" scandals, Caldwell was asked to resign as superintendent. In 1939, he and his successor were arrested for violating the Federal Emergency Relief Act. Caldwell was later indicted by a federal grand jury on a number of other charges related to misusing WPA funds. The prosecutor, Malcolm Lafargue of the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana in Shreveport, alleged that Caldwell and his cronies were using federal funds to pay contractors for work conducted at their own houses.Kane, p 307. Caldwell ultimately pleaded guilty to seven federal charges. State officials convicted and jailed at the same time as Caldwell in this scandal included Governor Richard W. Leche, whose offenses also included illegal oil dealing; LSU President James Monroe Smith, and LSU Business Manager E. S. Jackson. Monte Hart, Caldwell's partner in his firm, was convicted of contracting-related charges and died before serving his sentence. The two-year sentence of Dr. Clarence Lorio was suspended; he was president of the Louisiana State Medical Society. After being convicted of tax evasion and bribery, for requiring kickbacks from contractors, Caldwell was sentenced in 1940 to four years in a federal prison. In 1941, he was paroled. He was subsequently pardoned by U.S. President Harry Truman. He later gained new commissions for construction of public buildings, such as parish courthouses. Caldwell Brothers had a prominent role in the state into the 1950s. Caldwell married for a second time in 1948 to Margaret Longmire. Caldwell died in Baton Rouge in 1966 at the age of seventy-three. He is interred in the Garden of Faith plot at Resthaven Gardens of Memory and Mausoleum in Baton Rouge. His second wife Margaret, who died in 1983, is interred beside him; her grave is unmarked.

The M02 is very similar to the NSV machine gun and Kord machine gun in appearance and capability. The M02 can fire over 700 rounds per minute and has a maximum effective range of 2,000 m against ground targets and 1,500 m against airborne targets. Description The primary purpose of the Coyote is neutralization or destruction of living force or light-armoured vehicles on the ground, on water, at distances up to . It can be used for action at air targets. The Coyote has a cradle that is set to a stable tripod. The tripod enables adaptation to various terrains. The machine gun has a pistol trigger mechanism and handgrip and also springs in the stock. These primary assemblies enable accurate fire. Aiming is done with optical sight or with front and rear iron sights. The M02 functions without stoppages in all environments. The barrel is made by cold forging, which guarantees its durability and permanence. The interior of the barrel is chrome plated, which provides unaltered ballistic characteristics for several thousands of fired rounds. The barrel is quickly and easily stripped from the machine gun, so when the gun is heavily used it is possible to cool it quickly and replace it with the spare one. The set of the gun contains a spare barrel. During the fire, cartridge cases are ejected forward, which increases the safety of the shooter and people nearby. When conditions are extreme, the position of gas flow regulator can provide an adequate gas flow, so the machine gun will always function reliably. The machine gun is loaded from belts. The set of the gun includes belts and ammunition boxes for the transport of belts, with the capacity of 60 rounds. Flash suppressor on the muzzle disperses powder gas and decreases the flash of the flame, hiding the position of the shooter.

It is unclear whether he had any familial connection with the producer Sam Zimbalist. Movie career Zimbalist started his career in the film industry when he joined the Stanley- Warner Theatres home-office in New York in 1929, working as an editor for the company's house organ, The Warner Club News. At 19, Zimbalist was said to be one of the youngest editors in the industry.Warner Bros. Claims to Have Youngest Editors. Exhibitor's Herald World 24 August 1929, P. 46.

In 1947 he was head of publicity for Film Classics. He left Film Classics in 1949 and worked as an assistant on some Edward Albertson releases in 1951 and 1952. In 1952 Zimbalist announced he had formed Motion Picture Artists to make moderate-priced \\"class exploitation films\\". These would include Miss Robin Crusoe, Half-caste Girl and La Virgin de Cadiz. Of these only the first was made. However he did produce Cat-Women of the Moon (1953) with Jack Rabin. Zimbalist produced King Dinosaur and intended to follow it with White Slave Ring but it was not made. He formed ZS Productions with Irving Shulman to make a film based on the latter's unpublished novel about Baby Face Nelson. They partnered with Mickey Rooney's Fryman Enterprises to make Baby Face Nelson (1957). =MGM= The film was popular enough for Zimbalist to be signed to MGM. His first film for them was Watusi a sequel to King Solomon's Mines (1950), using footage from that film. The second was a remake of Tarzan, the Ape Man (1959) which also used King Solomon's Mines footage. Zimbalist then made Valley of the Dragons at Columbia based on a Jules Verne novel. This movie made use of footage from One Million B.C. (1940). He then went back to MGM for Drums of Africa (1963), using footage from King Solomon's Mines once more. After Drums of Africa Zimbalist was going to make Jazz Jungle but it was never made. =Later career= In 1964 he was going to make The Sea Creature for Jack Warner Jnr. The film was never made. Zimbalist set up at the Goldwyn studios and announced plans to make 12 films starting with Young Dillinger. Young Dillinger used footage from Baby Face Nelson. After Young Dillinger he and star Nick Adams wanted to make Guns of the G Men but it was never made. In 1969 he registered the title Sea of Tranquility but no film resulted.

The commission was chaired by then-North Carolina Governor James Hunt. Background The 1980 Democratic National Convention saw a bitter fight over rules and platform issues. In response to this, the Hunt Commission was convened in 1981. Effects The most prominent result of the commission was the creation of superdelegates. Additionally, it lowered the percentage of delegates needed to gain representation at the convention, to 25% for primary states, and 20% for those holding caucuses. It also recommended that states make efforts to include low- and moderate-income individuals in their convention delegate pools. The commission recognized that states which organized primaries or caucuses earlier in the year received greater media attention, and so, in response, allowed states to hold nominating events over the course of three months, but allowed New Hampshire to hold its primary no more than one week before other states, and Iowa to hold its caucuses no more than 15 days before the rest of the states.

It is bounded on the northeast by the railroad and the Chosewood Park neighborhood; on the northwest by the railroad and the BeltLine and the Peoplestown neighborhood, on the west by High Point and the Villages at Carver, and on the south mostly by Turman Street and the Lakewood Heights neighborhood. History South Atlanta was originally known as Brownsville. Author Ray Stannard Baker in The Atlanta Riot described it in 1907, in the tone illustrating the presuppositions with which white Americans wrote about African Americans at that time; but nonetheless illustrating the industriousness of Brownsville at the time: > When I went out to Brownsville, knowing of its bloody part in the riot, I > expected to find a typical negro slum. I looked for squalor, ignorance, > vice. And I was surprised to find a large settlement of negroes practically > every one of whom owned his own home, some of the houses being as attractive > without and as well furnished within as the ordinary homes of middleclass > white people. Near at hand, surrounded by beautiful grounds, were two negro > colleges ‚Äî Clark University and Gammon Theological Seminary. The post office > was kept by a negro. There were several stores owned by negroes. The > schoolhouse, though supplied with teachers by the county, was built wholly > with money personally contributed by the negroes of the neighborhood, in > order that there might be adequate educational facilities for their > children. They had three churches and not a saloon. The residents were all > of the industrious, property-owning sort, bearing the best reputation among > white people who knew them.The Atlanta riot, Ray Stannard Baker Clark University (founded in 1869), moved to a site in South Atlanta in 1883, establishing Gammon Seminary Theological Seminary the same year. In 1941 Clark departed to its present location near Downtown Atlanta when it joined the Atlanta University system. It served as a cultural, religious and community anchor in South Atlanta.

Since 1991 he has been the senior rabbi and spiritual leader of Congregation Beth Jacob of Atlanta, Georgia, succeeding his father, Rabbi Dr. Emanuel Feldman, who founded and led the congregation for 39 years. Over the past 20 years Feldman has built on his father's work, bringing a community kollel to the city and nurturing the growth of Atlanta as one of the leading centers for Orthodox Jewish life in America. He is also a founding board member of the Association for Jewish Outreach Programs (AJOP). Early life Feldman was born in Atlanta to Rabbi Dr. Emanuel Feldman and his wife, Estelle, who arrived in that city as newlyweds in 1952 to assume the roles of Rabbi and Rebbetzin of Congregation Beth Jacob. At that time, the synagogue was home to 40 families, only two of whom were Shomer Shabbat. Over the next four decades, the couple brought hundreds of families closer to Torah observance, helped build a Hebrew academy and Torah day school, and established a nationally-recognized kosher certification organization. Although he was the rabbi's son, the young Ilan was more interested in politics than the rabbinate. Like his father, he studied at Yeshivas Ner Yisroel of Baltimore, Maryland and was a talmid of rosh yeshiva Rabbi Yaakov Weinberg. In 1976 Feldman married the rosh yeshiva's daughter, Miriam. The couple has eight children. Assistant rabbi In 1980 Feldman decided to join his father as assistant rabbi of Congregation Beth Jacob. In addition to his synagogue duties, he assisted his father in the development of the Torah Day School of Atlanta, which opened in 1985. =Atlanta Scholars Kollel= On his own initiative, the younger Feldman founded the Atlanta Summer Kollel (later renamed the Atlanta Scholars Kollel) in 1987. Feldman secured funding for the project from Torah Umesorah, and brought in three graduates of Yeshivas Ner Yisroel as the first rabbis. Unlike the prevailing community kollel concept which viewed the kollel as an \\"inreach\\" organization serving its own, already-committed members, ASK is an outreach program that brings Jewish knowledge and commitment directly to the doorsteps of Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform Jews in Atlanta. ASK rabbis spend only 3 to 4 hours per day on their personal Torah learning and devote the rest of their day to \\"lunch 'n learn\\" classes, Hebrew reading crash courses, beginners minyans, campus outreach, and study groups for women, teens and singles. ASK has become a model for other community kollels in the United States. The kollel now has 11 full-time rabbis and 3 part-time women teachers who educate more than 1,000 men, women, students, teens and singles monthly. Upon his father's retirement in 1991, Rabbi Ilan Feldman was elected senior rabbi by the synagogue's board of directors. Leadership Feldman has perpetuated the outreach work his father began. Congregation Beth Jacob now exceeds 500 families, and the Orthodox community, centered around the synagogue's location in Toco Hills, is now attracting more Torah-observant families from New York, Baltimore and other cities to relocate here. Besides nurturing his congregants' growth in religious observance, Feldman stresses the importance of taking responsibility for non-religious Jews and making visitors to Atlanta feel welcome. Feldman serves as the dean of the Atlanta Kashruth Commission, which was founded by his father in the 1960s. Today this agency certifies nearly 150 companies, manufacturing plants, bakeries, supermarkets, restaurants, hotels, and caterers nationwide, and is considered one of the most reliable kosher-certification organizations. Feldman is also the head of a rabbinical court recognized by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel as a reliable conversion authority. As the rabbi of one of the leading Orthodox Jewish communities in the United States, Feldman frequently speaks out on key issues. These include: Jewish conversion, Christian missionizing of Jews, Sabbath desecration, and Jewish burial. For his congregants, Feldman reserves one Shabbat a year to speak about everything he loves about them, and one Shabbat a year to offer gentle criticism for how they can improve. Feldman has served as a spiritual advisor for the Atlanta branch of the Jewish Alcoholics, Chemically Dependent Persons and Significant Others (JACS) support network. He also answers questions in the \\"Adviceline\\" column in Mishpacha Magazine. Miriam Feldman Feldman's wife, Miriam, is a full partner in his synagogue and community work. Like her husband, she is a popular speaker for groups; the two have even appeared as \\"scholars in residence\\" on a cruise ship. She has also taped many audio shiurim (Torah lectures) for Torah Media Atlanta. Holder of a bachelor's degree from Yavne Teacher's College and Notre Dame University, and a master's degree from Loyola University, she was one of the first four teachers of the Torah Day School of Atlanta, which opened with 19 students in 1985 and which today boasts more than 300 students. In 1996 she opened the first girls-only high school in the South, the Temima High School for Girls, a Bais Yaakov-type school at which she is principal. For this achievement, she was named one of the \\"50 Most Influential Jews in America\\" by Jewsweek, placing 13th on the magazine's list. On the occasion of Rabbi Feldman's tenth anniversary in office, the Georgia General Assembly passed House Resolution 131EX2 commending both Rabbi Ilan and Miriam Feldman for their contributions to their synagogue and the community at large.

The total area of the island is 0.77 square kilometers, of which approximately half is owned by the Imperial Household Agency. The island is rocky, within only 4% of its area forested, although olive trees have been introduced in recent years. History Himakajima has been populated since prehistoric times, and appears to have been a Kofun period necropolis, with 35 kofun burial mounds thus far identified, and which have been found to contain a large number of grave goods, from the late 6th to early 7th centuries. During the Nara period it was mentioned in records as a source of shark skin and dried fish. During the Edo period, it was part of the holdings of Owari Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate and contained a fishing settlement. With the establishment of the modern municipalities system after the start of the Meiji period, the island was organized as a village within Chita District, Aichi.

Whereas a craton is an old and stable part of the lithosphere, the term \\"metacraton\\" is used to describe a craton that has been remobilized during an orogenic event, but where the characteristics of the original craton are still identifiable. The geology of the continent has only been partially explored, and other names have been used to describe the general area that reflect different views of its nature and extent. These include \\"Nile Craton\\", \\"Sahara Congo Craton\\", \\"Eastern Saharan Craton\\" and \\"Central Saharan Ghost Craton\\". This last term is because the older rocks are almost completely covered by recent sediments and desert sands, making geological analysis difficult.  Extent  The \\"metacraton\\" covers an area of about . It lies between the Tuareg shield to the west, the Congo craton to the south, the Arabian-Nubian Shield to the east, and the northern African continental margin. The southern boundary is not well-defined, but may be considered to run along the northern edge of the Oubangides orogenic belt in the southwest and the Aswa Shear Zone further east. It lies under southern Egypt and Libya and western Sudan, northern Kenya, Uganda and Congo, the Central African Republic, Cameroon and eastern Nigeria and Chad. Chronology Saharan Metacraton and neighboring areas The craton may have formed during a period of accelerated crustal growth between 3000 Ma and 2000 Ma (Ma: million years ago). The oldest rocks in Egypt date to about 2700 Ma. Rocks in southern Libya and eastern Chad have been dated between 2900 Ma and 2600 Ma. Some geologists date a rifting episode to between 1200 Ma and 950 Ma. The Pan-African orogeny saw the cratons that had formed the Rodinia super- continent come together in a completely new arrangement into the Gondwana super-continent around 500 Ma. The \\"Pharusian Ocean\\", which separated the West African craton from the Saharan craton around 800 Ma, began to close about 730 Ma, and about 635 Ma these two cratons collided, with the basement of the Saharan craton undergoing extensive reworking in the process. The Saharan craton may have been decratonized, perhaps oceanized, during the Pan-African event. At the end of this period the craton was extended and rifts appeared. By about 500 Ma the Saharan craton was sutured with the Congo craton during the final assembly of Gondwana. Although Gondwana later split up, the core African Plate remained intact. A different theory of the area's evolution has the Nile craton in southern Libya and eastern Chad as an extension of the Congo craton, remaining as an intact unit during the break-up of Rodinia between 1000 Ma and 700 Ma, and during the subsequent Pan-African event. In this scenario, a fragment of craton found in the Hoggar Mountains, dating from the late Proterozoic, is called the East Saharan craton, originally far from the Nile craton with which it was joined only during the Pan-African event. Perhaps the simplest view is that the \\"craton\\" is an assembly of microcontinental blocks with different origins that were swept together during the Pan African orogeny.

Baba Mashan Nath temple at the top. Manikarnika Ghat (Hindi: ‡§Æ‡§£‡§ø‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ ‡§ò‡§æ‡§ü) is one of the holiest cremation grounds among the sacred riverfronts (ghats), alongside the river Ganga, in the city of Varanasi in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. In Hinduism, death is considered as a gateway to another life marked by the results of one's karma. It is believed that a dead human's soul attains moksha, and hence breaks the cycle of rebirth when cremated here. Thus, scores of the elderly across the whole country seek to walk up to its edges, and spend their last days absorbing the charisma of the ghat making death painless and insignificant to be pondered upon. The ghat is named after Sati's earrings which fell here. The Hindu genealogy registers at Varanasi are kept here. Location The Manikarnika Ghat is flanked by the Dashashwamedh Ghat and the Scindia Ghat. It is situated in Varanasi, India. Mythological Origin Ratneshawar, upper level: Tripur Sundari and Ganesh It is one of the oldest ghats in Varanasi. The Manikarnika Ghat is mentioned in a Gupta inscription of 5th century. It is revered in Hindu religion. When Mata Sati (Aadi shakti mata) sacrificed her life & set her body ablaze after Raja Daksh Prajapati (one of the sons of Lord Brahma) tried to humiliate Lord Shiva in a Yagya practiced by Daksh. Lord Shiva took her burning body to the Himalaya. On seeing the unending sorrow of Lord Shiva, Vishnu sends the Divine chakra to cut the body into 51 parts which fall on earth. They are called \\"Ekannya Shaktipeeth\\". Lord Shiva established Shakti Peeth wherever Sati's body had fallen. At Manikarnika ghat, Mata Sati's Ear's ornament had fallen. The Manikarnika shrine as a Shakti Peeth Sati Devi The Manikarnika shrine is an important place of worship for Shaktism sect of Hinduism, It is near to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple. The mythology of Daksha yaga and Sati's self immolation is the mythology behind the origin of Shakti Peethas. The etymology of the place is due to this mythology. It is believed that Sati Devi's Ear Rings has fallen here. Manikarna in Sanskrit means Ear Rings. Shakti Peethas are shrines that are believed to be enshrined with the presence of Shakti due to the falling of body parts of the corpse of Sati Devi, when Lord Shiva carried it and wandered. There are 51 Shakti Peeth linking to the 51 letters or akshar in Sanskrit. Each temple have shrines for Shakti. The Shakti of Manikarnika is addressed as Vishalakshi & Manikarni. Significance Mourners carrying a body Hindu mythology teaches that the ghat is especially sacred and that people cremated there receive moksha. As the myth goes, Vishnu, after several thousand years of tapasya, trying to please Shiva, to convince him to not destroy the holy city of Kashi when he destroys the world, managed to do so. Lord Shiva along with Parvati came to Kashi before Vishnu to grant him his wish. Vishnu dug a kund (well) on the bank of Ganga for the bath of the couple. When Lord Shiva was bathing a Mani (Jewel) from his earring fell into the kund, hence the name Manikarnika (Mani:Beads Karnam:Ear Angad: Ornament). There is another myth about the ghat : the ear jewel from lord Shiva fell down while he was dancing angrily, which fell on the earth and thus Manikarnika Ghat formed. Manikarnika Kund Ratneshwar Mahadev temple, Varanasi, India The well at the ghat is called Manikarnika Kund and was built by Lord Vishnu. Proposal A proposal for renovating the Manikarnika ghat has been proposed by Departments of Landscape Architecture at the University of Illinois at Urbana, Champaign (UIUC), USA, and Bhanubhen Nanavati College of Architecture for Women (BNCA), Pune, India A proposal for renovating and redevelopment the Manikarnika ghat is in progress by Eastern Infrastructure Fund of Varanasi, India.

It is located on Arts Square and is an example of Empire style neoclassicism. The palace currently houses the main building of the Russian Museum and displays its collections of early, folk, eighteenth, and nineteenth century art. It was originally planned as the residence of Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich, the youngest son of Emperor Paul I. Work had not yet begun on the Mikhailovsky Palace, when Paul was overthrown and killed in a palace coup that brought Michael's elder brother to the throne as Alexander I. The new emperor resurrected the idea for a new palace by the time Michael was 22, and plans were drawn up by Carlo Rossi to develop a new site in Saint Petersburg. The palace, built in the neoclassic style, became the centrepiece of an ensemble that took in new streets and squares. It was lavishly decorated, with the interiors costing more than the main construction work. It was gifted to Grand Duke Michael and his new wife, Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna, by the Emperor in 1825. The grand ducal family had comfortable apartments furnished to their individual tastes. Grand Duke Michael carried out some of his military duties there, while his wife hosted salons that brought together many of the leading members of Saint Petersburg society and culture. The Grand Duchess continued this lifestyle after her husband's death in 1849, until her own death in 1873. The palace was passed on to the couple's daughter, Grand Duchess Catherine Mikhailovna. Over the years of their residency, the family renovated and refurbished the palace's rooms in keeping with contemporary tastes. By the time of Grand Duchess Catherine's death in 1894, the staterooms were no longer in regular use‚Äîthe family resided for the most part in the palace's wings. With the death of the Grand Duchess, the palace was inherited by her children, who were members of the family of the Dukes of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Concerned about the palace passing out of the Romanov family, Emperor Alexander III decided to buy it back for the state. He died before this could be arranged, but the negotiations were carried out on behalf of his son Emperor Nicholas II, by Minister of Finance Sergei Witte. Nicholas gave it to the newly established Russian Museum, in honour of his father, with the remit that it collect and display domestic art. The palace was extensively renovated to fit its new role, with some of the interiors retained. One wing was demolished and rebuilt, later becoming the Russian Museum of Ethnography, while a new extension, the Benois wing, was added in the 1910s. History The future site of the palace, shown on a 1737 map The palace was designed as a residence for Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich, youngest son of Emperor Paul I. At Paul's order, several hundred thousand rubles were to be set aside annually for the construction of the palace from 1798 onwards. In 1801, Paul was overthrown and killed in a palace coup, and his heir ascended to the throne as Alexander I. The new emperor decided to carry out his father's wishes and gave his approval to the construction of the new palace when Michael was 21. By this time some 9 million rubles had been accumulated. The designs were drawn up by Carlo Rossi in 1817. At first the site of the Vorontsov Palace was proposed and then the site of the Chernyshev residence, which later became the site of the Mariinsky Palace. Both options were rejected by Alexander I as being unnecessarily expensive and complex, instead selecting a new site in the city centre for development. The site eventually chosen was a space that had previously seen little development, between the confluence of the Fontanka and Moyka Rivers, the Griboyedov Canal and Nevsky Prospect. It had been used as garden and hunting space, with Empress Elizabeth's Summer Palace, and later Emperor Paul's Mikhailovsky Castle being located nearby. Rossi set out to develop a new architectural ensemble, which would include not only a new palace, but a square and two new streets, and . Two existing streets, Sadovaya and , were to be extended and included in the overall architectural ensemble. Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich, for whom the palace was built In early April 1819, the \\"Commission for the construction of the palace of Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich\\" was created. The ceremonial laying of the foundation took place in summer that year, with construction beginning on 26 July. Architect Adam Menelaws also laid out a garden for the palace overlooking the Field of Mars, which became known as the Mikhailovsky Garden. The masonry was the responsibility of , and . As was common with Russian building projects, construction work was only carried out in the warm seasons to ensure the work was reliable and durable, while the winter was spent collecting building materials and working on designs and calculations. The main core of the palace was built between 1819 and 1820, with the wings added the following year; by the end of 1822 the bulk of the construction was finished. The interior designs and decorations were completed over the next two years. Grand Duke Michael married Princess Charlotte of W√ºrttemberg, who took the name Elena Pavlovna, in February 1824, and by the middle of the following year the work on the palace was largely completed. Emperor Alexander I visited the new palace and declared himself extremely pleased with the result, bestowing a diamond ring and the Order of Saint Vladimir Third Class order on Rossi. Rossi also received a plot of land for the construction of his own house. The palace was officially completed on , when the Emperor presented it to Grand Duke Michael and his heirs in perpetuity. Its construction had taken six years, at the expense of 7,875,000 rubles. Of this sum approximately 4 million rubles, more than half the total cost, was spent on its decoration. A grand banquet was held to mark the occasion, with Alexander departing the following day for his journey to the south, where he died. Grand Duke Michael and his new wife moved into their new home from their apartments at the Winter Palace. Design An early view of the palace's neoclassical facade The palace consists of a central block with two wings, housing the service spaces. The western wing was termed the Freylinskiy wing, or the ladies-in-waiting wing, and the eastern, the Manezhny wing, or the riding hall wing. A separate outbuilding by the Manezhny wing was used for stables, with another outbuilding, the Laundry House, placed at the corner of Inzhenernaya and Sadovaya streets. The palace faced Mikhailovsky Square, now Arts Square. Its facade consists of a rusticated lower floor below the piano nobile portico, a loggia with a three-quarter eight-columned Corinthian colonnade supporting a triangular pediment with armour decorations by Stepan Pimenov and Vasily Demut-Malinovsky. The entrance staircase is flanked by two Medici lions, specially cast for the palace in 1824. The arches and windows of the first floor are decorated with stone lion heads. The facade facing the Mikhailovsky Garden consists of a large loggia-colonnade, while Corinthian colonnades decorate the building's wings. The lower floor contains the private apartments, the first floor held the official suites, ballrooms and staterooms. There was a house chapel to the Archangel Michael in the south-east corner of the mezzanine floor and kitchens on the ground floor. The entryway leads into a large vestibule with a bas-reliefs, a Corinthian colonnade, plafond and skylight. The design of the palace became internationally renowned and respected. After hearing reports from his ambassador to Russia, Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville, King George IV of the United Kingdom asked the Russian emperor for a model of the palace. One was duly built by Nikolai Tarasov, measuring two metres in length and two in width, which was delivered to the king by Tarasov's brother Ivan. Mikhailovskaya Square in the foreground The Blue Gallery was entered through a doorway flanked with caryatides by Stepan Pimenov, which led on to the large dining room, with a vaulted ceiling with grisaille coffers. The passageway led through a marble-decorated dancing Hall to the sitting rooms, and then the staterooms. While those of Grand Duchess Elena were particularly luxurious, the staterooms of Grand Duke Michael were more spartan. Ambassador Leveson- Gower wrote that \\"The only place the Grand Duke allowed splendour and luxury was in a rich and varied collection of weapons, armour, helmets, equipment, artillery and other guns in perfect condition.\\" Albert Nikolayevitch Benois noted that \\"In the [Grand Duke's] Study and Library were collections of rare books, gravures, numismatics, lots of magnificent art ... The walls of the hall were hung all over with trophies, mostly sabres, swords, banners, canvases of military subjects and portraits\\". Among the trophies were the three cannons which had played an important role during the accession crisis of 1825, when they were used to clear the Decembrists from Peter's Square. They were gifted to the Grand Duke by his brother, Emperor Nicholas I. Life at the palace The elaborate and richly decorated staterooms Grand Duke Michael maintained close contact with his military life, often hosting commissions at the palace, and holding audiences with military personnel seeking posts. The servants were often military veterans, and for a time Major-General of the Patriotic War of 1812 lived at the palace. Grand Duke Michael died in 1849, with the palace passing to his widow, Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna. She became famous as a salon hostess, with her guests including poets Alexander Pushkin, Fyodor Tyutchev and Vasily Zhukovsky. She acted as a patron for artists such as Alexander Ivanov, Karl Bryullov and Ivan Aivazovsky. Another guest was Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay, who, with the help of Elena Pavlovna and Anton Rubinstein, established the Russian Musical Society and the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. Classes of the Society and Conservatory sometimes took place in the palace. Thursdays became the day when statesmen, scientists, writers, and artists came to meet at the palace. Otto von Bismarck was one attendee, while serving as the Prussian envoy to Russia, and at times Emperor Nicholas I visited, as did his successor Emperor Alexander II and his wife, Maria Alexandrovna. She was also renowned at hosting balls at the palace, the equal to those of the Imperial family. The Marquis de Custine recalled that > \\"Grand Duchess Elena for each of the festivities she arranges, invents, as I > was told, something new, original, not familiar to anyone ... Groups of > trees, illuminated from above with a covered light, made a fascinating > impression ... One and a half thousand tubs and pots with the rarest flowers > formed a fragrant bouquet ...

All boundaries > disappeared, everything was full of light, gold, colors, reflections and an > enchanting, magical illusion ... This palace seemed to be created for > festivity ... I have never seen anything more beautiful anywhere.\\" The White Hall, one of the surviving Rossi interiors The Grand Duke's suite remained unaltered during his lifetime, though in the 1830s, Grand Duchess Elena ordered the reconstruction of her suite by Andrei Stackenschneider, in keeping with contemporary styles. The smaller staterooms were also updated over the period of her occupancy. Several famous architects were employed at different periods to carry out this work‚ÄîHarald Julius von Bosse remodelled two sitting rooms and two studies of the Grand Duchess's suite in the 1840-50s, redeveloped the rooms of the couple's daughter, Grand Duchess Catherine Mikhailovna in 1850; Aleksandr Yurkevich remodelled the palace's Upper Church in 1857 and the music room in 1863. Georg Preiss was appointed as architect for the palace in 1859, while I. Jogansson and fulfilled several commissions in the 1870s. Grand Duchess Elena died in 1873, and the palace passed to her third daughter, Grand Duchess Catherine Mikhailovna, who had married Duke Georg August of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. A new suite of eight rooms for Grand Duchess Catherine Mikhailovna and her daughter Helena was built in 1865 in the Manezhny wing, which became the main residence of the Grand Duchess Catherine until her death in April 1894. Catherine Mikhailovna's staterooms and the Freylinskiy had been renovated after Grand Duchess Elena's death. Preiss retired in 1888, passing his duties on to his son Konstantin. By the early 1890s the ducal family resided mostly in the wings of the palace, with the main staterooms largely unoccupied. With the death of Grand Duchess Catherine Mikhailovna on 30 April 1894, the palace passed to her children, Georg, Mikhail and Helena, Dukes and Duchesses of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. This created a political quandary as while the children were technically subjects of the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the Mikhailovsky Palace was intended to be a possession of the Romanov family. Emperor Alexander III decided to buy the palace at public expense and establish the Kseniinsky Institute there, after his daughter, Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna. Alexander died suddenly in 1894 before this could be carried, and it was his son and successor as Emperor Nicholas II who instructed Minister of Finance Sergei Witte to arrange the purchase of the Mikhailovsky Palace. A sum of four million rubles was agreed upon, and on 20 January 1895 the palace passed back into the hands of the Romanovs. The departing family was allowed to take some of the decorations relating to the family history, as a result of which, many of the chandeliers, doors and fireplaces were removed. Creation of the museum The entrance vestibule and grand staircase of the palace, with a bust and plaque to Emperor Alexander III Witte suggested that Nicholas II might take up occupancy in the Mikhailovsky Palace, though Nicholas preferred to stay in the Winter Palace. Meanwhile, the proposed Kseniinsky Institute had already taken possession of the Nicholas Palace. Witte then suggested that the Mikhailovsky Palace would make a suitable home for a museum of Russian art in honour of Emperor Alexander III, which Nicholas agreed to. By this time the Hermitage held the works of mostly foreign artists, with only a single room allotted for domestic art. It was decided to establish a new institution dedicated to Russian art, and by personal decree on Nicholas II established the \\"Russian Museum of Emperor Alexander III\\" and placed the Mikhailovsky Palace complex in its possession. The museum was placed under the supervision of Grand Duke George Mikhailovich, with a committee established under Professor Mikhail Botkin to oversee the reconstruction of the palace into a museum by architect of the Imperial Academy of Arts. The reconstruction produced considerable changes to the palace's interior. Doorways were heightened, some were blocked off, and new passageways were created. Fireplaces, mantelpieces and mirrors were removed, as were wall paintings and mouldings, and smaller rooms were combined to create larger exhibitions spaces. The dance hall and large theatre were completely reworked, with windows being filled in and replaced with skylights. Few of Rossi's interiors were retained, though the reconstruction was carried out in the neoclassic style to fit with the original designs. Concrete ceilings were also fitted to protect against attic fires, and the central heating system was overhauled, as well as measures to improve the ventilation and water supply. The main building work was completed by spring 1896, after which work began on the interiors, which involved artists N. Blinov, N. Budakov, A. Boravsky; sculptors Amandus Adamson, and cabinetmaker S. Volkovisky. The committee made a final examination of the work on 28 February 1898, and pronounced themselves entirely satisfied. The museum officially opened on 7 March 1898. =Benois wing= A detached building was constructed between the Freylinskiy wing and the Griboyedov Canal between 1910 and 1912 by architects Leon Benois and , for temporary art exhibitions. It was founded on 27 June 1914, but work was suspended for the duration of the First World War, and was only completed in 1919. It was transferred to the Russian Museum in the early 1930s, and in November 1941, during the Siege of Leningrad, the building was struck by two high-explosive bombs. A statue of Alexander III that stood in the palace courtyard was also hit by a bomb during the war, but had been covered with sand and logs, and escaped damage. Restoration work was carried out between 1947 and 1963. In 1958, a passage was built linking it to the Freylinskiy wing, by now termed the Rossi wing. The palace today The palace as a museum. Paintings by Ivan Aivazovsky at left, and The Last Day of Pompeii by Karl Bryullov at right The Mikhailovsky Palace houses the main building of the Russian Museum and is used to display its collections of early artworks, and those from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Entrance and exits are through the lower floor, which contains the ticket offices, cloakrooms, shops, cafe, and other visitor facilities. The Rossi wing, the former Freylinskiy wing, displays nineteenth century art, and examples of Russian folk art. Twentieth century art and temporary exhibitions are displayed in the Benois wing. The former Manezhny wing was demolished by Vasily Svinin, with a new building constructed between 1900 and 1911, which now houses the Russian Museum of Ethnography, initially the Russian Museum's department of ethnography, but established as a separate museum in 1934. Between 2000 and 2002 the original decoration of the palace church was recreated.

Mycobond was discovered and developed by two Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute graduate students and National Science Foundation (NSF) assisted them in doing so. MycoBond is created by using the natural growth process of the vegetative structure of a fungus called mycelium. MycoBond is produced from crop waste such as seed husks (examples cited are oat, rice or buckweed husks, or cottonseed hulls), or woody biomass, that has been inoculated with a fungus (specifically mushroom).  Uses  This material can be used as fire retardants, insulation, or packaging components. In packaging applications, the end product has been tested and purportedly conforms with the specifications that are typical of a traditional petroleum polymer foam based cushioning/packing material (such as EPS).  Manufacturing  To process the materials to be used as a feedstock to grow the structure, the feedstock material is cleaned, \\"cooked\\", cooled and pasteurized. As part of the process the material is also continuously inoculated with mycelium (by spores or myclial division). This processed and inoculated material is then placed in molds that conform to the shape and size of the final product. As the mycelium grows, it consumes the feedstock and creates a chitinous polymer matrix that forms the lightweight, non-compressible structure. It takes 5 days to grow packaging pieces, such as EcoCradle‚Ñ¢ packaging blocks used to protect knock-down furniture pieces for shipment.  Benefits  MycoBond is a completely biodegradable product that will not harm or poison the natural environment with petroleum byproducts such as benzene (a known carcinogen). Additionally, MycoBond can be produced locally in virtually any region of the world. The inventors have cultivated strains of mycelium that can use locally regionally sourced feedstocks.

Description Walkways Through the Wall is a sculpture, made for the Wisconsin Center, that intertwines public and private space. Created in 1998 by Vito Acconci, and a collaborating team of architects, (David Leven, Celia Imrey, Luis Vera, Jenny Schrider, and Saija Singer) Walkways Through the Wall is intended to enhance the idea of the Airlines Center as being seen as one continuous plaza. The dimensions are 14.5' X 68' X 204', and the sculpture stretches from outside the building, through its interior, and out the other side. The materials used are: Colored Concrete, Standard Gray Concrete, Steel, and Light-box floor. The sculpture passes through the walls of the building as if they aren't there, making a continuous path from exterior to exterior. Historical information Walkways Through the Wall is an example of Acconci's focus on architecture and landscape design.Famous Italian American Architects According to Wisconsin policy, 1% of the Midwest Airlines Center had to be spent on art. Instead of creating a piece of sculpture for the outside of the building, Acconci integrated art into the building's design. Mark A. Wallace compares the building's concrete floor to taffy that slips in and out of the building, going through windows, sidewalks and the building's facade.\\"Concrete flatwork, post-modern style\\" \\"From the outside, Acconci extends the natural concrete as pathways through the wall and into the building, bisecting the terra-cotta concourse. Each path then heads in a different direction and ends with a unique purpose. In two cases, the path forms a bench at the street level. In another it cascades downward before ending as a sitting area on the level below. In still another, it leads to a stairway connecting the two levels. Light boxes mark the turns in the walkways where the concrete material ceases to exist, illuminating both the interior and exterior concourses.\\"Discoveries: The Eclectic Art of the Midwest Airlines Center, Schick, Monica, Wisconsin Center District, 2002. Special care had to be taken in the construction. For example, the benches had to be cast 6 inches thick, so as to be able to support their own weight and that of pedestrians. The resulting space is playful, yet Acconci also envisioned serious objectives. The artist aimed to re-people the public space, and encourage them to think about how these spaces are shaped. He achieved this by creating a continuous plaza. \\"Acconci and his colleagues designed their \\"interactive art installation\\" with the hope that visitors to the Midwest Airlines Center will see materials defying physical properties and reflect on their own potential. 'I hope they would laugh and think that something is doing what it wasn't supposed to do,' explains Acconci, 'So if the material does what it is not supposed to do, maybe I, a person, can do what I am not supposed to do.\\" Location This sculpture has a permanent place at the Wisconsin Center.

She held a performer's certificate in flute and a Bachelor of Music in music theory from the Eastman School of Music, and a Masters in Music from the Manhattan School of Music. She was a faculty member of the Manhattan School of Music for fifteen years and taught flute at the Juilliard Preparatory School. Hoover won numerous awards for her compositions, and her music was hailed as \\"fresh and individual... dazzlingly crafted.\\"  Biography  Born in Elkins, West Virginia, Hoover was raised in a \\"non- musical family.\\" Her mother was a painter and her father was a scientist, and they discouraged her from pursuing music as a career. However, music was the most important part of Hoover's life. She recalled being able to read music as early as four years old, before she could read words. After her family moved to Philadelphia, she began playing the flute. At age fifteen, she began playing the piano. She received \\"mediocre music instruction\\" in high school.Yarrison, Eileen (1996). ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòMedieval Suite‚Äô for Flute and Piano by Katherine Hoover: An Examination, Analysis, and Performance Guide‚Äù Because her parents discouraged her from pursuing a music major, she began her academic studies at the University of Rochester in 1955. Two years later she transferred to the Eastman School of Music, where she studied with flutist Joseph Mariano, began studying composition, and graduated in 1959 with a Bachelor of Music in Music Theory and a Performer's Certificate in Flute. Unfortunately, her composition classes left a bad impression. Hoover comments, \\"There were no women involved with composition at all. [I got] rather discouraged ‚Äì being the only woman in my classes, not being paid attention to and so forth.\\" After graduating from Eastman, she moved to Manhattan and spent the next ten years focusing on performing and teaching. In the summers of 1960 and 1961, Hoover attended the Yale Summer Session, where she studied flute, theory, and composition. During this time, she studied with flutist William Kincaid in Philadelphia. From 1961‚Äì1967 Hoover taught flute at the Juilliard Preparatory School as well as a few other small schools, including the Third Street Music School. It was at the Third Street Music School that Hoover had her first positive experience as a composer. She was asked to compose a piece for a school concert, a duet for violins, which was very well received. In 1969, Hoover began teaching flute and theory at the Manhattan School of Music, a position she held for fifteen years. During her time at Manhattan, she continued her graduate studies and received her Master of Music in Music Theory in 1974. In 1972 Hoover had her first publication of a composition, Three Carols for choir and flute, published by Carl Fischer. Hoover was also a faculty member of the Teachers College, Columbia University from 1986 to 1989, where she taught flute and composition to graduate students. In 1990, she wrote Kokopeli, a work for solo flute inspired by the Hopi tribe and the American Southwest. At this time, she began Papagena Press, which was founded to publish her works. Kokopeli was the first publication of Papagena Press and won the National Flute Association's Newly Published Music Competition in 1991 (Hoover's second of four NFA Newly Published Music awards). Hoover was very involved with women's arts organizations and has worked to bring the works of women composers to the public's notice. In 1977, she began work with the Women's Inter-Art Center in New York. Here she organized Festivals I, II, and III of Women's Music which presented music by fifty-five historical and contemporary women composers. In 1996, Hoover was the composer in residence for the Fourth Festival of Women Composers at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. In her later years, Hoover lived with her husband Richard Goodwin in New York City where she continued to actively compose new works as well as promote an interest in compositions, historical and contemporary, by women composers.Interview (2013); \\"Biography\\" from This Way About, by Katherine Hoover (2015).  Compositional style  Hoover's compositional career got off to a rather discouraging start. With the combination of parents who did not want her to pursue music and composition teachers who paid little attention to her because she was a woman, it makes sense that she did not publish anything until 1972. Hoover claimed to be somewhat self-taught as a composer. Although she did have some formal education in composition, her main studies were in music theory, and she said her job as a theory teacher at the Manhattan School was where she learned the most about compositional techniques. Teaching music theory forced her into careful analysis of scores of a variety of music, especially twentieth-century music, which she taught for many years. It was also at the Manhattan School where Hoover spent a great deal of time discovering how people perceive sounds. Hoover had perfect pitch, so studying how other people identify with sounds was helpful as she began to compose. Hoover's compositional style has been described as \\"a romantic, often pictorial atonal style\\" that is \\"clear and eloquent [with] moments of startling beauty [emerging] from her sometimes acerbic harmonies.\\" Three compositional elements stand out as consistent patterns in Hoover's music: 1) extra-musical references; 2) quotations and manipulations of other composers' melodies; and 3) use of abstract, original material. Extra-musical references have proven a consistent trend throughout Hoover's compositions, and she has found inspiration in a wide variety of sources. Three of her compositions for solo flute, Kokopeli, Winter Spirits, and To Greet the Sun, are influenced by the sounds of Native American music and the Hopi tribe of the American Southwest. Eleni: A Greek Tragedy is an orchestral tone poem inspired by Nicholas Gage‚Äôs book Eleni. Likewise, Hoover drew inspiration from Barbara Tuchman's A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous Fourteenth Century for her Medieval Suite, originally scored for flute and piano, then transcribed by the composer for flute and orchestra. Night Skies, on the other hand, was inspired by a painting Hoover saw that motivated her to spend time examining the wonders of the starry evening sky. She pulled from many different sources for her compositional ideas, and it is because of these references to extra-musical concepts that her music is often considered pictorial and evocative. Hoover was also known for her use of musical quotation and adaptation of other composers' melodies. She then juxtaposed these quotations against her own original material and harmonies. An obvious example of Hoover's use of musical quotation can be found in Celebration for Flute Choir, written for her teacher Joseph Mariano's ninetieth birthday. In Celebration, Hoover juxtaposed her own material against quotations of famous flute works. These quotations are direct and straightforward without any major changes or adaptations to the melodies. However, Hoover's use of quotation was not always this obvious. In the first movement of Medieval Suite, for example, Hoover quoted Virelai No. 17, \\"Dame, vostre doulz viaire debonair\\" by Guillaume de Machaut in several different ways. The melody is first heard in fragments and at a different pitch level than the original Virelai. Then a more extended quote of this material is heard at the Virelai's original pitch level, but these pitches are produced using harmonics overblown at the twelfth. This is just one example of how Hoover manipulated melodies and juxtaposed these alterations against her own material. In this piece alone, there are several more musical quotations, including references to the famous Dies Irae in the final movement, \\"Demon‚Äôs Dance.\\" Hoover became particularly renowned for her compositions for flute. This was natural since she had quite a varied career as a distinguished flutist. Hoover believed that being an accomplished performer greatly benefitted her compositional abilities. She said, \\"It is a great advantage to be good at an instrument, to understand in depth what making music on a high level is about. It encourages respect for your performers and their needs...\\" While her idiomatic flute writing bears witness to her in-depth knowledge of the instrument, her compositions were certainly not limited to just the flute. Hoover composed works for many different instruments and a variety of ensembles. The majority of her output, however, was chamber works. She explained that this was more of a \\"pragmatic, not an artistic\\" decision because \\"it's increasingly difficult for composers to get new works programmed by orchestras... The growing tendency of conductors to have several orchestras means that they increasingly leave programming to their boards and to committees. They don't have time to study new scores or listen to new works...\\" Despite this challenge, Hoover composed several orchestral works and a handful of concertos. Perhaps the greatest praise of her ability came from composer John Corigliano: \\"Katherine Hoover is an extraordinary composer. She has a wide and fascinating vocabulary which she uses with enormous skill. Her music is fresh and individual. It is dazzlingly crafted, and will reach an audience as it provides interest to the professional musician. I do not know why her works are not yet being played by the major institutions of this country, but I am sure that she will attain the status she deserves in time. She is just too good not to be recognized, and I predict that her time will come soon.\\" Honors and awards * Member Laureate, Sigma Alpha Iota * National Endowment for the Arts Composer's Fellowship, 1979 * Academy of Arts and Letters Academy Award in Composition, 1994 * National Flute Association Newly Published Music Competition, 1987, 1991, 1993, 1994 References  External links  Hoover's page at Theodore Presser Company * Hoover's publisher * Complete list of compositions on Hoover's website 1937 births 2018 deaths American music educators American women music educators American female classical composers American classical composers American flautists Women conductors (music) Eastman School of Music alumni Manhattan School of Music alumni Manhattan School of Music faculty People from Elkins, West Virginia Musicians from West Virginia Musicians from Philadelphia Women flautists Teachers College, Columbia University faculty 20th-century classical composers 20th-century American women musicians 20th-century American composers 21st-century classical composers 21st-century American women musicians 21st-century American composers Classical musicians from Pennsylvania 20th-century American conductors (music) 20th-century women composers 21st-century women composers ","title":"Katherine Hoover"},{"id":"30145307","text":"Assi Ghat Assi Ghat is the southernmost ghat in Varanasi.

In 1930, she became the first woman pilot to race with men in an open competition. She made many public appearances to urge more women to take up flying. Personal history Opal Logan Giberson was born in 1894 or 1896 in Missouri to Edward F. Giberson and his wife. She graduated from Dana Hall School in Wellesley, Massachusetts. In 1923, she married mineralogist George Frederick Kunz (1856‚Äì1932). The marriage was annulled in 1929. The couple remained on good terms, with Kunz caring for George for the remainder of his life. On his death, he left her a substantial bequest. Aviation career Kunz earned her pilot's license in 1929. A crash two weeks later in New Jersey drew extensive press coverage; she escaped uninjured. A second crash two years later left her with gasoline burns. She spent a great deal of time and money on her flying pursuits and always named her planes after Betsy Ross. On April 7, 1930, at the Philadelphia American Legion Benefit Air Meet, she became the first woman to race with men in open competition. She won the race. Kunz gave frequent press interviews and radio addresses to urge more women to take up flying. =Powder Puff Derby= In 1929, Kunz participated in the first Women's Air Derby, later dubbed the \\"Powder Puff Derby\\" by humorist Will Rogers. At the time, there were only 70 licensed female pilots in the entire United States, and only 40 qualified to take part in this contest. The transcontinental course began in Santa Monica, California, and ended in Cleveland, Ohio. Race rules stipulated that the aircraft must have horsepower \\"appropriate for a woman.\\" Kunz was told her own 300-horsepower Beech Travel Air was too fast for a woman to handle and would not be allowed. Forced to borrow a less-powerful airplane in order to take part in the race, she finished eighth.Jessen, Gene Nora. \\"The 1929 Air Race\\" . The Ninety-Nines website. Accessed May 14, 2001. =Death of Jack Donaldson= On September 7, 1930, Kunz loaned her plane to aviator John Donaldson at the American Legion Air Races meet in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Donaldson suffered fatal injuries when the airplane fell from a height of 1,800 feet straight down into the municipal airfield. =Betsy Ross Air Corps= Kunz was an organizer of the Betsy Ross Air Corps, a paramilitary service formed to support the Army Air Corps (the precursor to the U.S. Air Force) in national defense and to serve as humanitarian \\"air minutemen\\" in times of emergency. It also had the goal of offering flight instruction to women in order to build a reserve group of women aviators. Kunz grew the corps to about 100 members, partially funding it herself. She served as the corps' first commander, and her husband designed its insignia. The short-lived corps (1931‚Äì1933) was never formally recognized by the U.S. military. =World War II= As World War II approached, Kunz began teaching aviation students at Arkansas State College. In 1942, she moved to Rhode Island, and at the start of World War II became an instructor at the Rhode Island state airport for Navy cadets and for the government-sponsored Civilian Pilot Training Program. She taught several hundred young men how to fly for the war effort. Later years After the war, she became an inspector for the Aerojet Corporation in California. In 1961, following after the historic space flight of the Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, she wrote to President John F. Kennedy to volunteer her services as an American astronaut. In honor of her extensive aviation experience, the president wrote her a courteous reply. Kunz died at home in Auburn, California in 1967.

During this period Laha established an international reputation, and he visited statistical institutes at University of Paris, France, ETH Zurich, Switzerland, and in the United States. He moved to Bowling Green State University in 1972, along with his colleagues Eugene Lukacs and Vijay Rohatgi, to start a new PhD program there.For an announcement see Laha retired from Bowling Green State University in 1996 and died in Perrysburg, Ohio on 14 July 1999 after a long illness. Laha was the author of several classical texts on probability theory and statistics and numerous publications in journals. He was an honoured Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and an elected member of the International Statistical Institute. Laha was particularly interested in characterisations of the normal distribution.Radha G. Laha (obituary), The Toledo Blade, 18 July 1999. One of his well-known results is his disproof of a long-standing conjecture: that the ratio of two independent, identically distributed random variables is Cauchy distributed if and only if the variables have normal distributions. Laha became known for disproving this conjecture. Laha also proved several generalisations of the classical characterisation of normal sample distribution by the independence of sample mean and sample variance.Laha (1991) =Philanthropist= Laha made a generous endowment from his estate to the American Mathematical Society and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. The AMS established the Radha G. Laha Gardens in 2001.AMS Dedicates Radha G.

It is commonly known as green scale or sometimes coffee green scale because it is a major pest of coffee crops throughout the world. Description The adult scale insect is a glossy pale green colour with black internal markings that are visible through the chitinous body wall. It has a flattish elongated oval dome shape and is about three millimetres in width. The front end is rounded while the rear end has a distinctive groove. Adults retain their legs and antennae but mostly remain sedentary. The nymphs are a flattish oval shape, yellowish green, with six short legs. The nymphs shed their skin three times and each instar is larger and more convex than the previous one.Fredrick, J. M. 1943. Some Preliminary Investigations of the Green Scale, Coccus viridis (Green), in South Florida. Florida Ent. 26(1): 12-15; 26(2): 25-29. Biology Males have not been recorded for this species so the populations are composed entirely of females. A mature female lays whitish oval eggs and keeps them underneath her body to protect them. She usually chooses the underside of a leaf and adult scales may often be seen in a line on both sides of the midrib and beside the lateral veins. Eggs hatch in anything between a few minutes and a few hours. The newly hatched crawlers wander off to find somewhere suitable to settle on a leaf or near the tip of a green shoot. Both nymphs and adults suck sap from the phloem of the host plant. When a large number of scale insects are present, their collective feeding causes a yellowing of the leaves which may later fall, a loss of plant vigour and a reduction in crop yield. The scale insects excrete honeydew on which bees, wasps, ants and other insects feed. Sooty mould fungus often grows on the honeydew and this decreases the area of leaf available for photosynthesis, spoils the appearance of the plant and reduces the marketability of fruit.Elmer, H. S. and O. L. Brawner. 1975. Control of Brown Soft Scale in Central Valley. Citrograph. 60(11): 402-403. It is especially damaging to young trees after transplanting.LePelley, R. H. 1968.

Occas Pap Entomol 24:1-44 but is now widely distributed throughout the tropics.http://scalenet.info The host range includes vegetable, fruit and ornamental crops as well as many native plants. Economically important crops include Anthurium, atemoya, avocado, cacao, celery, cherimoya, coffee, custard apple, flowering ginger, guava, lime, Macadamia, orange, orchid, Plumeria and sugar apple.Kessing and Mau, 2007 It is a serious pest of coffee in many countries causing so much damage that in some areas, coffee production ceased. Management Green scale is transported to new areas on infected plants. There should be a thorough inspection of planting material for scale and other insects before it is introduced into a greenhouse.Copland, M. J. W. and A. G. Ibrahim. 1985. Chapter 2.10 Biology of Glasshouse Scale Insects and Their Parasitoids. pp. 87-90. In: Biological Pest Control The Glasshouse Experience. Eds. Hussey, N. W. and N. Scopes. Cornell University Press; Ithaca, New York. Certain entomopathogenic fungi have been shown to affect green scale but attempts to infect healthy insects with these fungi have been unsuccessful. Controlling ant colonies will assist in reducing levels of attack by green scale (see below). This scale is susceptible to a number of pesticides including carbaryl, malathion, methomyl and volck oil. Consideration should be given to the harmful effects of these chemicals on beneficial insects. Research This scale is often associated with ants which feed on the honeydew excreted and defend the insects from attack by predators such as lady beetles. The relationship between Pheidole ants and Coccus viridis in Hawaii is mutualistic.Direct and indirect interactions between ants (Pheidole megacephala), scales (Coccus viridis) and plants (Pluchea indica) In trials involving adding lady beetle larvae and carnivorous lepidopteran larvae to plants infested with green scale with or without ants being present, it was found that the ants actively removed both kinds of larvae, usually within an hour of introduction. The direct effect of this was an increase in scale reproductive success and the indirect effect was a decrease in scale mortality resulting from the removal of predators and a decrease in parasitism rates. Another research study conducted in the field found a positive correlation between the presence of ants on host plants and the success of green scale insects. On coffee trees from which ants had been excluded the number of scale insects had declined after fifty days and after seventy days, none remained, whereas scales had thrived on ant-infested trees.Interference of Pheidole megacephala (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) with Biological Control of Coccus viridis (Homoptera: Coccidae) in Coffee A study found that the entomopathogenic fungus, Cephalosporium lecanii, was highly effective in controlling coffee green scale.Effectiveness of the white halo fungus, Cephalosporium lecanii, against field populations of coffee green bug, Coccus viridis A study examined the effect of the fungus on coffee green scale in combination with lower than normal applications of either of two insecticides, fenthion and phosphamidon. The use of fenthion resulted in the highest percentage mortality of the scales at the lowest dosages of insecticide. The results from the use of phosamidon were inconclusive, with the results differing in the laboratory and the field.The effect of subnormal concentrations of insecticides in combination with the fungal pathogen, Cephalosporium lecanii in the control of coffee green scale, Coccus viridis References Coccidae Agricultural pest insects Insects described in 1889 Hemiptera of Central America ","title":"Coccus viridis"},{"id":"30145571","text":"The Charlotte, Monroe and Columbia Railroad was a shortline railroad that served South Carolina in the early 20th century.

The words \\"lectu mihi mars\\" were intended to be heard as \\"Leck du mich im Arsch\\" (\\"lick my arse\\"), a phrase commonly used in Mozart's family circle. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart displayed scatological humour in his letters and a few recreational compositions. This material has long been a puzzle for Mozart scholarship. Some scholars try to understand it in terms of its role in Mozart's family, his society and his times; others attempt to understand it as a result of an \\"impressive list\\" of psychiatric conditions from which Mozart is claimed to have suffered. Examples Self-portrait in pencil of Maria Anna Thekla Mozart, from 1777 or 1778 A letter dated 5 November 1777Mozarts B√§sle-Briefe, p. 109, p. 110 to Mozart's cousin Maria Anna Thekla Mozart is an example of Mozart's use of scatology. The German original\\"lezt w√ºnsch ich eine gute nacht/scheissen sie ins bett dass es kracht/schlafens gesund/reckens den arsch zum mund\\"; is in rhymed verse. Mozart's canon \\"Leck mich im Arsch\\" K. 231 (K6 382c) includes the lyrics: This would be translated into English as \\"lick me in the arse/ass,\\"Arse\\" is British English, \\"ass\\" is American. quickly, quickly!\\" \\"Leck mich im Arsch\\" is a standard vulgarism in German, euphemistically called the Swabian salute (). The closest English counterpart is \\"Kiss my arse/ass\\". Context David Schroeder writes: > The passage of time has created an almost unbridgeable gulf between > ourselves and Mozart's time, forcing us to misread his scatological letters > even more drastically than his other letters. Very simply, these letters > embarrass us, and we have tried to suppress them, trivialize them, or > explain them out of the epistolary canon with pathological excuses.Schroeder > (1999:133) For example, when Margaret Thatcher was apprised of Mozart's scatology during a visit to the theatre to see Peter Shaffer's play Amadeus, director Peter Hall relates: > She was not pleased. In her best headmistress style, she gave me a severe > wigging for putting on a play that depicted Mozart as a scatological imp > with a love of four-letter words.

Penguin Books. =Letters= Benjamin Simkin, an endocrinologist,Simkin, Benjamin. Medical and Musical Byways of Mozartiana. Fithian Press. Retrieved on 28 October 2006. estimates that 39 of Mozart's letters include scatological passages. Almost all of these are directed to Mozart's own family, specifically his father Leopold, his mother Anna Maria, his sister Nannerl, and his cousin Maria Anna Thekla Mozart. According to Simkin, Leopold, Anna Maria and Nannerl also included scatological humour in their own letters.Simkin (1992, 1563) lists one letter containing scatological humor from each of Leopold and Nannerl; and from Anna Maria, one, and another which appears in . Thus, Anna Maria wrote to her husband (26 September 1777; original is in rhyme): Even the relatively straitlaced Leopold used a scatological expression in one letter.This was \\"to shit oranges\\", meaning approximately \\"to get upset\\", using in a letter written from Italy in 1770; Mieder (2003:45) Several of Mozart's scatological letters were written to his cousin (and probable love interest, according to Solomon)For a discussion of the evidence that Mozart and his cousin were in love, see Solomon (1996:161‚Äì166). Maria Anna Thekla Mozart; these are often called the \\"B√§sle letters\\", after the German word B√§sle, a diminutive form meaning \\"little cousin\\". In these letters, written after Mozart had spent a pleasant two weeks with his cousin in her native Augsburg,Schroeder (1999:87‚Äì89) the scatology is combined with word play and sexual references. Robert Spaethling's rendered translation of part of a letter Mozart sent from Mannheim November 5, 1777: One of the letters Mozart wrote to his father while visiting Augsburg reports an encounter Mozart and his cousin had with a priest named Father Emilian: =Music= Mozart's scatological music was most likely recreational and shared among a closed group of inebriated friends. All of it takes the form of canons (rounds), in which each voice enters with the same words and music following a delay after the previous voice. Musicologist David J. Buch writes: =Reactions of family and friends= In 1798, Constanze sent her late husband's B√§sle letters to the publishers Breitkopf & H√§rtel, who at the time were gathering material in hopes of preparing a Mozart biography.Solomon (1996:500) In the accompanying letter she wrote \\"Although in dubious taste, the letters to his cousin are full of wit and deserve mentioning, although they cannot of course be published in their entirety.\\" =In the 18th century= Gottfried Prehauser, an actor of 18th-century Vienna, playing Hanswurst Schroeder (1999) suggests that in the 18th century scatological humour was far more public and \\"mainstream\\". The German-language popular theater of Mozart's time was influenced by the Italian commedia dell'arte and emphasized the stock character of Hanswurst, a coarse and robust character who would entertain his audience by pretending to eat large and unlikely objects (for instance, a whole calf), then defecating them.Schroeder (1999:128) Schroeder suggests a political underlay to the scatology in popular theater: its viewers lived under a system of hereditary aristocracy that excluded them from political participation. The vulgarity of scatological popular theater was a counterpoint to the refined culture imposed from above.Schroeder (1999:127‚Äì130) One of Mozart's own letters describes aristocrats in scatological terms; he identified the aristocrats present at a concert in Augsburg (1777) as \\"the Duchess Smackarse, the Countess Pleasurepisser, the Princess Stinkmess, and the two Princes Potbelly von Pigdick\\".English rendering from Schroeder (1999:135). The original German reads \\"Duche√üe arschb√∂merl, die gr√§fin brunzgern, die f√ºrstin richzumtreck, und die 2 Princzen Mu√übauch von Sauschwanz\\". =In German culture= The folklorist and cultural anthropologist Alan Dundes suggested that interest in or tolerance for scatological matters is a specific trait of German national culture, one which is retained to this day:Mozart's nationality was, strictly speaking, that of the Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg. His letters indicate he felt his nationality to be German (see e.g. his letter to his father of 17 August 1782; Mersman (1972:204)); this was natural in a time when the territory comprising modern Austria and Germany was a patchwork of mostly small nation-states. provides ample coverage of scatological humor in Mozart, but also cites scatological texts from Martin Luther, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Heinrich Heine, and other luminaries of German culture. asserts that \\"scatology was common in Mitteleuropa [central Europe]\\", noting for instance that Mozart's Salzburg colleague Michael Haydn also wrote a scatological canon.. Haydn's canon was entitled \\"Schei√ü nieder, armer S√ºnder\\", which Karhausen renders as \\"Shit fast, poor sinner\\". Some of the phrases used by Mozart in his scatological material were not original with him but were part of the folklore and culture of his day: Mieder (2003) describes the B√§sle letters as involving \\"Mozart's intentional play with what is for the most part preformulated folk speech\\".Mieder (2003:50) An example given by Robert Spaethling is the folkloric origin of a phrase seen above, \\"Gute Nacht, schei√ü ins Bett dass' Kracht\\", claimed by Spaethling to be a \\"children's rhyme that is still current in south German language areas today\\".Spaethling (2000:18). As Spaethling notes, the rhyme also appears in Mozart's canon \\"Bona nox\\", and in an Italian translation (\\"cacate nel letto che egli f√† fracasso\\") is found a 1770 letter to his mother and sister written in Italy. Likewise, when Mozart sang to Aloysia Weber the words \\"Leck mich das Mensch im Arsch, das mich nicht will\\" (\\"Whoever doesn't want me can kiss my ass\\") on the occasion of being romantically rejected by her, he was evidently singing an existing folk tune, not a song of his own invention.See Solomon (1996:169, 552), citing Bl√ºmml. Medical accounts An early 20th-century observer who suspected that Mozart's scatological materials could be interpreted by psychological pathologies was the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig, who amassed a large collection of musical manuscripts. His collection included the B√§sle letters (at the time, unpublished) as well as the autographs of Mozart's scatological canons \\"Difficile lectu\\" and \\"O du eselhafter Peierl\\".Searle (1986) Zweig sent copies of the B√§sle letters to the celebrated psychiatrist Sigmund Freud with the following suggestion: Freud apparently declined Zweig's suggestion. As Schroeder notes, later psychobiographers seized on the letters as evidence for psychopathological tendencies in Mozart.Schroeder (1999:127) Some authors in the 1990s interpreted the material as evidence that Mozart had Tourette syndrome (TS).Gunne, L.M. (1991) Hade Mozart Tourettes syndrom? L√§kartidningen 88: 4325‚Äì4326. [cited in Kammer 1983] * Fog, R. (1995) Mozart's bizarre verbal behavior: a case of Tourette syndrome? Maledicta 11:59‚Äì62.

(1994) Mozart und das Tourette-Syndrom. Acta Mozartiana 41: 15‚Äì20. [cited in Kammer 1983]. Simkin catalogued the scatological letters and compared their frequencies with similar vulgarisms from other members of Mozart's family‚Äîthey are far more frequent. The scatological materials were combined by Simkin with biographical accounts from Mozart's own time that suggested that Mozart suffered from the tics characteristic of Tourette syndrome.Simkin, Benjamin (1992) Mozart's scatological disorder. BMJ 305: 1563‚Äì7. Available online. His claim was picked up by newspapers worldwide, causing an international sensation, and internet websites have fueled the speculation.Did Mozart really have TS? Tourette Syndrome Association Retrieved on 14 August 2002. While often discussed, the Mozart/Tourette hypothesis has failed to sway mainstream opinion on this issue. Indeed, Kammer (2007) states that the work proposing the hypothesis has been \\"promptly and harshly\\" criticized.Kammer, Thomas (2007) Mozart in the Neurological Department ‚Äì Who Has the Tic?

Available online; ; Kammer concluded that \\"Tourette's syndrome is an inventive but implausible diagnosis in the medical history of Mozart\\". Evidence of motor tics was found lacking and the notion that involuntary vocal tics are transferred to the written form was labeled \\"problematic\\". Neurologist and author Oliver Sacks published an editorial disputing Simkin's claim, and the Tourette Syndrome Association pointed out the speculative nature of this information. No Tourette's syndrome expert or organization has voiced concurrence that there is credible evidence to conclude that Mozart had Tourette's. One TS specialist stated that \\"although some websites list Mozart as an individual who had Tourette's or OCD, it's not clear from the descriptions of his behavior that he actually had either\\".Packer, L.

Samuel, played with glass pieces on mousepad-type material, using placement and point accumulation to win. The game board and instructions have a nautical theme, based in part on the concept of the rhumb line and historic games played by sailors. Rhumb Line II is a 50-page note pad travel version played with a blue and a yellow pen. An iPhone app version was produced in 2010. Components *Compass rose game board *20 Officer (yellow) and 20 sailor (blue) glass pieces (extra pieces are provided for each player) *Velour pouch *Instructions Objective The goal of the game is to out-navigate the opposition and achieve victory by placing nuggets on the board to build and/or block point- scoring \\"rhumb line\\" combinations of radii, arcs and spirals. Gameplay The Rhumb Line game board consists of a compass rose with 32 marked points with a score-keeping \\"ladder\\" on either end. Players choose either Officer yellow or Sailor blue and use 16 same-color pieces + 1 score-keeper each. Officer (yellow) starts and players take turns placing their pieces, one at a time, on any empty point, building on those already on the board, to complete and/or block point-scoring combinations. Start with an empty board, end with a full board ... with 3 ways to score points when placement of four same-color pieces is completed in any of the following combinations: *10 points - 4 same-color pieces in a radius *20 points - 4 same-color pieces in an arc *30 points - 4 same-color pieces in a spiral To avoid a foregone conclusion, when both players have only one piece, they remove any one of their pieces (once only) and, on their next turn, place it somewhere else on the board. Points are won with a player's own-color pieces and always accrued, never deducted. Several point-scoring \\"rhumb line\\" combinations may be completed at one time with a single piece. Overlooked points are forfeited and, throughout the game, players keep score on their side of the board with an extra piece of their color. The game is over when the last piece is placed and all the points are covered then, by comparing accrued points totals, the player with the most points is the winner of the game.

Directed by Oren Moverman and co- written by Moverman and James Ellroy, the film stars Woody Harrelson, Ned Beatty, Ben Foster, Anne Heche, Ice Cube, Cynthia Nixon, Sigourney Weaver, Robin Wright, and Steve Buscemi. It is set in the midst of the fallout from the Rampart scandal of the late 1990s, when corrupt Los Angeles Police Department Officer Dave Brown (Harrelson) is forced to face the consequences of his wayward career. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2011.\\"Rampart\\". TIFF.net. Retrieved 2011-11-04. and was released in theaters in the U.S. on February 10, 2012. Plot The film opens as Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Officer Dave Brown (Harrelson) patrols the Rampart Division. Brown is a 24-year veteran of the force, who previously served in the Vietnam War. While training a new officer, he roughs up a suspect to find the location of a meth lab. After work, he goes home to his two daughters and two ex-wives, who are also sisters (Heche and Nixon). After dinner, he goes to a piano bar where he picks up a stranger and has a one night stand. The next day, Brown is t-boned in his patrol car. When the other driver attempts to flee, Brown brutally beats him, and the assault is captured by a bystander. The video creates another controversy for the LAPD, which is already besieged by the recent Rampart scandal. The Assistant District Attorney (Weaver) urges Brown to simply retire. He refuses and outlines his defense. Over the course of the film, it is revealed that although Brown failed the bar exam, he remains extremely knowledgeable about case law. Back at the piano bar, Brown picks up a lawyer named Linda (Wright), after first determining that she is not surveilling him. Later he meets with ex-cop Hartshorn (Beatty), who suggests that Brown was set up to distract from the scandal. As the LAPD exerts more pressure on Brown, he retains legal counsel. Soon after, his ex-wives ask him to leave their houses so that they can sell them. Brown meets again with Hartshorn and mentions his need for cash. Hartshorn tips him off to a high stakes card game happening later that night at the Crystal Market. While Brown surveils the card game, it is knocked off by two armed men. Brown pursues the gunmen, killing one of them and letting the other go. He then stages the scene to make it look like he was shot at. Brown realizes that a homeless man nicknamed \\"General\\" (Foster) witnessed the whole thing from his wheelchair. As another investigation into Brown heats up, he goes to a hotel and blackmails the concierge into giving him a room. Next, he blackmails a pharmacist into giving him an assortment of drugs. When Brown meets with Hartshorn to give him a cut of the money from the card game, he asks for the source of Hartshorn's tip about the game. He suspects that he was set up again. Hartshorn refuses to name his source. Brown then meets with General in a parking lot to make sure that he will not testify about witnessing the shooting. The next day, an investigator with the District Attorney, Kyle Timkins (Cube) surveils Brown, who confronts him. Brown insists that he is not a racist, merely a misanthrope. Brown grows increasingly paranoid and reliant on drugs as the pressure on him mounts. He pulls a gun on Hartshorn and accuses him of setting him up. The elderly man scuffles with Brown until he has a heart attack. Instead of calling an ambulance, Brown leaves him to die. Back at the hotel, Brown's two daughters drop off some dry cleaning at his room, and he confesses to his younger daughter that everything she has heard about him is true. Brown summons Timkins to a meeting and tapes a confession in front of him. He admits that he has been a dirty cop, and that in 1987, he killed a business acquaintance. He justified the murder because he knew the man was a serial rapist, which is why he got away with the extrajudicial killing. Timkins refuses the confession, insisting that he will arrest Brown for his most recent murder. The film ends with Brown revisiting his family and staring at his elder daughter on the front porch before disappearing into the night. Cast Marketing Marketing poster The marketing team behind Rampart posted controversial posters in several major U.S. cities before the film was released. They showed Harrelson‚Äôs character, Officer Dave Brown, beating a man with a baton. The posters stated \\"I Work For You\\" and were meant to look like street art posters. Oren Moverman, the director of Rampart, said one of the producers had been \\"searching for an image that would be thought-provoking and challenging, not an indictment of a cop but rather a communal approach to the idea of policing'; the idea that maybe when cops do bad things it‚Äôs more of a reflection of society and what it is willing to tolerate, rather than the fault of one bad apple or an institutional problem. If they work for us, could it be they are us?\\" Harrelson conducted several interviews to promote the film. In one interview with \\"The Playlist,\\" Harrelson indicated \\"I had a period where I saw an early cut of the movie and didn't go for it, mainly because it was so different from the script and what we shot.\\" Harrelson also lost significant weight to prepare for the role. During the same interview, he stated \\"I lost 30 pounds and a part of it was that I felt like he would have this relationship to food which is very similar to his relationship with women.\\" Harrelson's take on the character was the following: \\"He can't really accept love, and if the food were representative of love. It's his inability to take that affection and nourishment.\\" He went on to say about the character he played, \\"I would say if one emotion that is most at play with Dave Brown it would be paranoia. So that emotion was kind of with me quite a bit during the filming.\\" = Reddit AMA = An attempt to market the film via the social news website Reddit went \\"horribly wrong\\" according to Forbes. Harrelson agreed to answer questions in an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session on Reddit's massively popular IAmA subreddit, where notable people engage in Q&A; sessions with the Reddit community. Redditors were disappointed by his answers and his apparent misunderstanding of the format, with some vowing to \\"boycott the flick\\". CNET characterized one of Harrelson's responses as \\"sheer oozing, all-about-me-ism\\". Josh Feldman with MediaIte shared the following perspective: \\"a proxy for the actor basically gave vague answers to half of the questions and in-no-way subtle plugs for his upcoming movie Rampart to the other half. It was a public relations nightmare, and while it certainly raised awareness about the movie, it definitely backfired.\\" Feldman went on to say about the incident, \\"it came across as robotic and represented an inability to connect with people when it should have been insanely easy to do so.\\" Feldman summarized the lesson learned by stating the following, \\"When you‚Äôre doing an AMA on Reddit, you drop the act and engage with real people. Some will be fans, some won‚Äôt, but if you‚Äôre just honest and it doesn‚Äôt seem like your answers have been planned out, people will respect you for it.\\" Reception =Critical response= Rampart received generally positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 74% based on 148 reviews, with an average rating of 6.61 out of 10. The site's consensus was that \\"Rampart sends viewers plummeting into a nihilistic hell of its protagonist's creation, yet Woody Harrelson's performance in the central role is too magnetic to dismiss\\". On Metacritic the film has a score of 70 based on 35 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four and praised Harrelson's performance, writing \\"Harrelson is an ideal actor for the role. Especially in tensely wound-up movies like this, he implies that he's looking at everything and then watching himself looking.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised Harrelson's performance: \\"it could have been a bucket of bleak. But the electric talent of Harrelson and Moverman is too exciting to be anything but exhilarating.\\" Justin Chang of Variety wrote: \\"While the film is drenched in atmosphere and packs a verbal and visceral punch, its relentless downward spiral makes for an overdetermined, not entirely satisfying character study.\\" Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"Harrelson goes full bore from the opening scene and there are no scenes he is not in. But the effect is wearying rather than exhilarating.\\" = Box office = Rampart was a box office bomb, opening at #47 and earning only $60,446 on its opening weekend across 5 theatres in North America. It ended up making just $972,512 domestically and $595,393 elsewhere across 106 theaters for a total of $1,567,905 against an estimated $12 million budget. In addition, total domestic video sales were equal to $2,150,130. = Awards = * African American Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor * Nominated ‚Äì Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead * Nominated ‚Äì Satellite Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture  References   External links   Rampart movie trailers 2011 films 2011 drama films American films American drama films English- language films Fictional portrayals of the Los Angeles Police Department Films about police misconduct Films directed by Oren Moverman Films set in 1999 Films set in Los Angeles Films shot in Los Angeles Films with screenplays by James Ellroy Films with screenplays by Oren Moverman Hood films Films about police brutality ","title":"Rampart (film)"},{"id":"30146082","text":"The Betsy Ross Air Corps (1931‚Äì1933) was a pre‚ÄìWorld War II organization of female pilots formed to support the Army Air Corps and to be of service in times of emergency. Founded during the Great Depression by aviator Opal Kunz and named after Revolutionary War hero Betsy Ross, the short-lived corps was never formally recognized by the U.S. military. History The founder of the Betsy Ross Air Corps, aviator Opal Kunz, had been disappointed that an earlier organization of women aviators, the Ninety-Nines, had not answered her goal of creating a women's national defense corps. So in 1931, Kunz formed the Betsy Ross Air Corps as a paramilitary service to support the Army Air Corps (the precursor to the U.S. Air Force) in national defense and to serve as humanitarian \\"air minutemen\\" in times of emergency. It also had the goal of offering flight instruction to women in order to build a reserve group of women aviators. Membership was available to licensed women pilots who were U.S. citizens. Student Pilots were eligible to join as Cadets. Apart from Kunz, aviators present at the first meeting of the corps (either in person or by proxy) included: Pancho Barnes, Marjorie Stinson, Mary Goodrich Jenson, Ruth Elder, LaBelle Sweeley, Ruth Bridwell McConnell, Eleanor McRae, Jean LaRene, Jane Dodge, Manila Davis, Margery Doig, Gladys O‚ÄôDonnell, May Haizlip, and E. Ruth Webb.\\" Later members included Hattie Meyers Junkin, Aline Miller, Thelma Elliott, Althea Murphy, Lola Lo Lutz, Mary Moore, Mildred Morgan, Mary Nicholson, Mary Alexander, Peggy Remey, and Martha Morehouse. The corps was divided into nine areas across the country, each led by a Lieutenant Commander: Boston, New York, Germantown, Memphis, Columbus, Oshkosh, Kansas City, Tulsa, and Visalia. On May 9, 1931, 14 of the 76 members met with the Chief of Naval Aeronautics and Chief of the Army Air Corps at the headquarters of the Daughters of the American Revolution to offer auxiliary aid in times of national emergency. The Corps was first headquartered in Kansas City, MO, at the Kansas City Municipal Airport though after a vote on Oct 7, 1933, it was decided to move the headquarters to Washington. Kunz served as the corps' first commander, and her husband designed its insignia. The corps had its own uniforms, described as tan breeches, lighter tan riding shirts, jodhpurs, dark brown English style military coats, and a dark brown beret with the organization's insignia. An anthem was commissioned for the corps. The corps has occasionally been referred to by the nickname \\"The Lady Bugs\\" or \\"Ladybirds\\". Kunz grew the corps to about 100 members and kept it going for several years, partially funding it herself. Among its other activities, the corps took part in air shows to raise money for charities. In a letter that Kunz later wrote to President John F. Kennedy, she said that she had intended to form a \\"Women‚Äôs Reserve Corp\\" [sic]. As it turned out, it was flier Pancho Barnes who afterwards formed the Women's Air Reserve as an unofficial branch of the U.S. Air Force.

Bush. It was composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The apportionment of seats in the House was based on the 2000 U.S. census. Overview In the Senate, there are 16 women, the highest number in history (Barbara Boxer, D-CA; Maria Cantwell, D-WA; Hillary Clinton, D-NY; Susan Collins, R-ME; Elizabeth Dole, R-NC; Dianne Feinstein, D-CA; Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-TX; Amy Klobuchar, D-MN; Mary Landrieu, D-LA; Blanche Lincoln, D-AR; Claire McCaskill, D-MO; Barbara Mikulski, D-MD; Lisa Murkowski, R-AK; Patty Murray, D-WA; Olympia Snowe, R-ME; Debbie Stabenow, D-MI). There are 13 Jews, three Hispanics (Mel Martinez, R-FL; Bob Menendez, D-NJ; Ken Salazar, D-CO) two Asian Americans (Daniel Akaka, D-HI; Daniel Inouye, D-HI), and one Arab American (John Sununu, R-NH). The average age of senators in 2007 is 62 years. The oldest senator in 2007 is President pro tempore Robert Byrd (90); the youngest is John Sununu (44). The 110th Congress includes the most religiously diverse House in history, including the first Muslims (Keith Ellison, D-MN and Andr√© Carson, D-IN), the first Buddhists (Mazie Hirono, D-HI and Hank Johnson, D-GA), 30 Jews, and one atheist (Pete Stark, D-CA). There are 42 African Americans (including two non-voting delegates) and 74 female representatives. There are also 27 Hispanics, four Asian Americans (Mazie Hirono, D-HI; Michael Honda, D-CA; Doris Matsui, D-CA; and David Wu, D-OR), and one Native American (Tom Cole, R-OK). There is one openly gay man (Barney Frank, D-MA) and one lesbian (Tammy Baldwin, D-WI). Religious demographics As of June 2008, the top five denominations in the Congress are Roman Catholic (29.3%), Baptist (11.1%), Methodist (10.2%), Jewish (7.8%), and Presbyterian (7.6%). Protestant denominations have held a large majority throughout congressional history, reflecting American's traditional demographics. 58.0% of seats are currently held by members of Protestant denominations. Catholics have also been in Congress from the beginning and have seen continuous representation since then. Charles Carroll was in the Continental Congress and was appointed to the Senate in 1789. Daniel Carroll of Maryland and Thomas Fitzsimons of Pennsylvania were Catholics in the first session of the House of Representatives. Gabriel Richard became the first Catholic priest in Congress in 1823. Quakers have also served in Congress since its inception, with Philemon Dickinson in the Senate and a pair of House members in Lambert Cadwalader and John Hathorn. Quaker representation has not been continuous, and only one member of the current Congress belongs to the group, Representative Rush Holt. In 1844, Lewis Charles Levin became the first Jew to be elected to Congress. In 1845, David Levy Yulee was the chosen as the first Jewish member of the Senate, although he later became a convert to Christianity. Jews have been continuously represented in the House since the election of Isidor Rayner in 1887. Since the election of Herbert Lehman to the Senate in 1948, the upper house has also contained at least one Jewish member. A record 42 Jews currently serve in Congress. Not until 1966 was a member of an Orthodox faith elected to Congress. Nick Galifianakis became the first member of this group to serve in the legislature. In 1977, Paul Sarbanes became the first US Senator of Orthodox beliefs. This group, despite having a relatively small number of adherents, has been continuously represented in both houses since the initial elections. Senator Olympia Snowe, as well as Representatives John Sarbanes, Zack Space, Gus Bilirakis, and Niki Tsongas are current members of Congress that follow Greek Orthodoxy, while Representative Melissa Bean adheres to Serbian Orthodoxy. Dalip Singh Saund, who was elected in 1956 and served until 1963, was the first, and so far only, Sikh in Congress. In 2007, Keith Ellison of Minnesota became the first practicing Muslim to become a member of the United States Congress; he was joined by Andr√© Carson of Indiana following a special election on March 11, 2008. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and Hank Johnson of Georgia became the first two Buddhists to be elected to the United States Congress on November 7, 2006. Johnson is a member of the Soka Gakkai sect, and Hirono (albeit non practicing) is a member of the Jodo Shinshu sect. Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) have been in Congress since Utah was established as a territory in 1851. Delegate John Milton Bernhisel became the first Mormon in Congress that same year. When Utah received statehood in 1896, Clarence Emir Allen became the first representative of a state that practiced the Mormon faith, and since then Mormons have had continuous representation in the lower House. Frank J. Cannon became the first Latter-day Saint member of the Senate, also in 1896. However, after he left office the next year, Mormons did not return to the Senate until 1905, when George Sutherland started a string of continuous representation for the group. Currently eleven representatives and five senators are part of this religious group. As of a statement in March 2007, California Rep. Pete Stark became the only publicly stated atheist in the history of Congress. He was formerly of the Unitarian Universalist faith. Numerous members of Congress throughout history have also declined to list an official religion, including 10 current representatives. Gender As of 2007, 477 members of Congress are male (84%) and 88 are female (16%). The global average for female representation at the parliamentary level in 2007 was 17.0%. Jeannette Rankin was the first woman elected to Congress, in 1916. Women could not vote or be elected in most of the United States until the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified in 1920. Rebecca Felton was the first woman to become a Senator in 1922, serving for a brief two-day period when she was appointed to fill a vacancy left by Georgia Senator Thomas E. Watson. The first woman to win a race for Senate was Hattie Caraway, who won a special election in January 1932 to fulfill her late husband's Senate term of office. Caraway subsequently won the scheduled November 1932 election, eventually serving two more full terms. In the early days following the legalization of national women's suffrage, most women elected to Congress were chosen as replacements for deceased husbands. Prior to the 1960s, most female members of Congress were either involved in this process of \\"widow's succession\\" or were members of influential political families. Elected to the House in 1965, Patsy Mink became the first non-white woman to enter Congress (she is of Japanese American heritage). Until 1992, a year that saw the election of four new female senators, the US Senate had never had more than three women serving at a time. Nancy Pelosi became the first female leader of a major party when she took over the position of House Minority Leader in 2002, and she is currently (since 2007) the first woman to serve as Speaker of the House. In the 109th United States Congress, there were 70 women serving the U.S. House and 14 in the U.S. Senate, which was the highest number of women to hold Congressional office in the United States up until that time. Those numbers went up in the 110th Congress, with 74 women in the House and 16 in the Senate. Sexual orientation There have been five openly gay members in the history of Congress. Gerry Studds (elected in 1972) became the first openly gay man when he acknowledged his homosexuality in 1983.First openly gay person elected to Congress dies NBC News, Oct 14, 2006 Barney Frank (elected in 1980) is currently the only openly gay male in Congress; he first spoke publicly about his sexual orientation in 1987. Steve Gunderson, elected in 1980 and outed in 1994,The Advocate: Closeted in the capital: they're powerful, Republican, and gay. Will the marriage battle finally get them to come out to their bosses? and Jim Kolbe, elected in 1984 and outed in 1996, are two other previous members of Congress that were openly gay. Current congresswoman Tammy Baldwin is the first and so far only open lesbian to win election to Congress.Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin  About Tammy In 1998, she became the first gay person to win election to Congress as a non-incumbent. Former California representative Michael Huffington is bisexual, but did not come out until after his term had ended. Occupational background Members of Congress come from a variety of occupational backgrounds. 215 members (159 in the House and 58 in the Senate) have worked in some aspect of law during their career, whether as an attorney, paralegal, policy analyst, or bureaucratic official, with 180 members of the House and 58 of the Senate holding Juris Doctor degrees. 189 members (162 in the House and 26 in the Senate) have worked in some segment of private sector business, with 18 members holding MBA degrees. 82 representatives and 14 senators have worked in education, whether as a teacher or school administrator. 109 Congress members have served as political aides at some level, including 10 working as congressional pages and 16 working as members of the White House staff. 24 members of Congress have worked in the medical field, including 12 M.D.s, 3 nurses, 2 dentists, 2 veterinarians, 1 psychologist, 1 psychiatrist, 1 optometrist, and 1 pharmacist. 15 members are former law enforcement specialists, including 5 sheriffs, 4 police officers, 2 state troopers, 2 probation officers, 1 FBI agent, and 1 border patrol agent. 9 scientists serve in Congress, including 4 chemists, 3 physicists, 1 biologist, and 1 biomedical engineer. 6 members of Congress are ordained ministers, while 5 are certified public accountants. Several members of Congress were nationally famous prior to entering politics, namely Hall of Fame MLB pitcher Jim Bunning, and NFL quarterback Heath Shuler. Other congressmen have held a variety of jobs ranging from social worker to mortician to riverboat captain. Race/ethnicity African Americans currently make up about 13% of the US population, but have historically been underrepresented in Congress. There currently are 52 African-American representatives (12%) and two African-American delegates in the United States House of Representatives, representing 26 states, plus the U.S. Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia. Senators Tim Scott, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris are the only current black members of the senate (3%). Until the emancipation of enslaved African Americans after the Civil War and the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, blacks were generally barred from voting outside of the Northeast and in the South, particularly. As a result of these new laws, Joseph Rainey and Jefferson F. Long won election to Congress in majority-black districts and Hiram Rhodes Revels was appointed as senator from Mississippi (then a majority-black state) in 1870. However, the end of Reconstruction in 1876 marked a weakening of black rights and by 1901, when George Henry White left the House after losing a reelection bid, there were no African Americans left in Congress. In 1929, Oscar Stanton de Priest became the first African American congressman since George Henry White. He and his successor, Arthur W. Mitchell, spent their tenure as the only African Americans in Congress while representing a majority-black House district in Chicago. In 1970, a year that saw the election of four black freshman congressman, black membership in the House reached double-digits. Shirley Chisholm became the first African American female member of Congress when she won a 1968 election in New York, while Andrew Young of Georgia became the first modern African American congressman from the South after he won election in 1972. Only six African Americans have served in the U.S. Senate. Hiram Revels and Blanche Bruce both served during Reconstruction in then majority- black Mississippi. In the modern era, Edward Brooke (served 1967-79), Carol Moseley Braun (served 1993-99 as the first black female senator), Barack Obama (served 2005-08), and Rolan Burris are the only blacks to have served in the upper house. Representation of Hispanics is somewhat complex, particularly because of the different ways to define membership in this group. Hispanics represent over 14% of the U.S. population, while the Senate is 3% Hispanic and the House is approximately 5% (25 members) Hispanic. Considering that Hispanics make up only 4% of American voters, Hispanic political incorporation has been relatively high compared with previous immigrant groups. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has 21 members. Joseph Marion Hern√°ndez, a Spanish American, was the first Hispanic in Congress. He was a Whig Party territorial representative for Florida in 1822. The first to represent a state was Romualdo Pacheco, who represented California in 1877. In 1929, Octaviano Ambrosio Larrazolo became the first Hispanic to be elected to the United States Senate. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban American first elected in 1989, was the first Hispanic woman in Congress. While Hispanic women have served in House, none have been elected to the Senate. Unlike black Americans, Hispanics never were legally barred from the polls and in New Mexico and California, Hispanics were a large and influential minority. Since the election of Dennis Chavez and Joachim O. Fern√°ndez to the House in 1931, Hispanics have continuously been represented in Congress. Most Hispanic members of Congress, including all elected prior to 1970, were of Mexican descent. Herman Badillo won election in 1970 to become the first Puerto Rican in Congress, Ileana Ros- Lehtinen was elected in 1989 as the first Cuban American congresswoman, and Richard Pombo won a seat in 1993 as the first Portuguese American member of congress. Prior to 2005, only three Hispanics have won a term in the U.S. Senate. These members were Octaviano Larrazola (served 1928-29), Dennis Chavez (formerly of the House, and served 1935-62), and Joseph Montoya (also formerly a House member, serve 1964-77), all of Mexican descent. However, two Hispanics won Senate seats in 2004, Ken Salazar and Mel Martinez (the first Cuban American senator), and Bob Menendez was appointed and subsequently elected in 2006. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders also have a high level of political incorporation in terms of their actual voting population. But, as a result this group's historically low voting rates, overall political incorporation of the general population is relatively low. Although the population of this group has increased in size by 600% in 30 years due to immigration, heavy naturalization and voter outreach efforts have provided this primarily foreign-born community with less than 1% of voters but 1.25% of congressional population. However, since they represent 4.4% of the total population in the United States, this 1.25% still represents less than one- third of the total Asian American and Pacific Islander population. There are six members of this group in the House and two in the Senate. Senator Daniel Inouye and Representatives Mike Honda, Doris Matsui, and Mazie Hirono are all Japanese Americans. Senator Daniel Akaka is a Native Hawaiian, while Delegate Eni Faleomavaega is a Samoan. Bobby Scott of Virginia, who is also half black, has Filipino American ancestry. Robert William Wilcox, a Native Hawaiian who served as Hawaiian territorial delegate from 1900 to 1903, was the first Pacific Islander chosen to serve in Congress. Dalip Singh Saund (served 1957-63) was the first South Asian American in Congress and is one of only two Indian Americans to be elected to the legislature. Hiram Fong, who served three decades in the Senate from 1959 to 1977, remains the sole Chinese American member to have ever entered Congress. Daniel Inouye (serving since 1959) was the first Japanese American in the House and later the first in Senate. Patsy Mink (served 1965-77 and again from 1990 to 2002) was the first Asian American woman in Congress. Daniel Akaka (serving since 1977) is thus far the only native Hawaiian to serve in either the House or the Senate. Jay Kim, who was born in Seoul and served from 1993 to 1999, remains as the only Korean American to have entered Congress, while current congressman David Wu became the first Taiwanese American representative in 1999. Bobby Scott, elected in 1993, is the only member of Congress to have Filipino ancestry. Only five members of the U.S. Senate have been of Asian American or Pacific Islander backgrounds. Four of these politicians have been from Hawaii, with senators Hiram Fong, Spark Matsunaga, and Daniel Akaka providing a continuous hold for this ethnic group on a Class I seat from that state since its inception. Daniel Inouye has held the state's other senate seat for all but four years of statehood. Samuel Hayakawa (in office 1977-83) of California is the only other Asian to have served in the upper house. Hayakawa is actually of Japanese Canadian descent, but worked as a college professor in the United States. Jewish Americans (29 members of the House and 13 members of Senate) have a level of political incorporation that is much greater than their voting population would suggest (2% of the population). Compared with the primarily European American, African American, Latino, and Asian/Pacific American communities, American Indians, comprising 1.5% of the population, are the most underrepresented group. Tom Cole, a Chickasaw, is the only registered American Indian currently in the House. Tracking Native American members of Congress is complex, since many people of mixed blood are not registered as part of the American Indian population. Charles Curtis, who was three-quarters Native American and had ancestries from a variety of different tribes, was elected in 1892 as the first U.S. representative from this group. Curtis accomplished several other firsts during his political tenure. He became the first American Indian to serve in the US Senate (in office 1907-13 and 1915‚Äì29), to lead a major party (served as Republican Senate Majority Leader from 1925 to 1929), and to obtain the office of Vice President. Several of the nation's major tribes have been represented in Congress in limited number. Charles David Carter (served 1907-27) was the first Choctaw in Congress; William Wirt Hastings (served 1915-35) was the first Cherokee in the legislature; Ben Reifel (served 1961-71) was the first Sioux to win election to the body. Other than Curtis, only a few members of the U.S. Senate have been American Indians. Robert Latham Owen (served 1907-25) and Ben Nighthorse Campbell (served 1993‚Äì2005 after several previous terms in the House and the first Cheyenne in Congress) are the others to have earned that distinction. Middle Eastern Americans also have typically low levels of voting incorporation, except among a particular voting group. As a whole, Middle Eastern Americans are not measured by the U.S. Census, which, combined with differences in the definition of this group, makes measuring its percentage of the population difficult. Estimates place about 1.8% of the nation's population to be of this origin. However, nearly all Middle Eastern members of Congress have been from one group, Lebanese Americans. George Kasem became the first Lebanese congressman when he won his only term in 1958. Since Abraham Kazen took office in 1977 (served until 1985), Lebanese Americans have been consistently represented in Congress. Currently there are four Lebanese members of the House: Nick Rahall, Ray LaHood, Charles Boustany, and Darrell Issa. Five members of the U.S. Senate have been of Middle Eastern descent, with all five coming from Arab American backgrounds and four holding Lebanese descent. James Abourezk, who served from 1973 to 1979, became the first Lebanese American member of the upper house. George Mitchell (served 1980-95), who is half Lebanese, became the first Middle Eastern American party leader, as he served as Senate Majority Leader from 1989 to 1995. James Abdnor (served 1981 to 1987) and Spencer Abraham (1995‚Äì2001) also were Lebanese American senators. John Sununu, a senator since 2003, is the first member of Congress of Palestinian American descent. Currently there is one foreign-born U.S. Senator, Mel Mart√≠nez of Florida, who was born in Cuba. There are seven current representatives who were born overseas: Lincoln D√≠az-Balart, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and Albio Sires from Cuba; Ciro Rodriguez from Mexico; Mazie Hirono from Japan; David Wu from Taiwan; and Pete Hoekstra from the Netherlands, who in total comprise 1.6% of the House. This figure does not include three members who were born overseas to U.S. citizen parents.

Published in 2010, the story questions the reader's view of reality. Plot The story begins 2,222 years ago. Contravening any historical fact, Zhen Li, King of Qin, having unified the six states in which the kingdom was divided into, undertook the title of Qin Shi Huang, or rather the first august emperor, reviving with him the very beginning of time. To delete any historical fact that would have illegitimated his power and following his trusted Minister Shi Lu's recommendations, had ordered that any text so far written be destroyed and to obtain the largest possible number of hard labor prisoners for the construction of the Great Wall, the terracotta army, and his threehundredandsixty-five room palace, extended sentences which would have punished not only the responsible but its entire family, as well. It was because of a book and the extension of the penalties that Chuang Tse's family was deported. Chuang Tse was saved thanks to his foresighted mother who had not registered him at birth, making him unknown to the civil service. Eleven years had past from that day. Chuang Tse had grown up as did his longing for revenge. In the meantime, the first emperor had attained an immeasurable power and proved to be a cruel and despotic tyrant. He had thousands of enemies which he had to watch from and despite all the propitiatory rites, the stars had predicted for him a terrible defeat and a reign of only eleven years. Yet the emperor was not aware that the time of that most terrible enemy had arrived. That morning, like every morning, Chuang Tse set out for the banks of the river with his yellow canoe. He had been warned not to sail towards the sea, but Chuang was anxious to experiment the Emperor's latest invention: a compass. The emperor had assured him that the use of that instrument would have always helped him find the right direction, but for the moment Chuang had not yet understood its mechanism. Distracted and near the sea by now, he had not noticed the arrival of a storm. Carried away, the boy lost his grip and sank under the waves. Down below he distinguished the presence of a wall that was not visible from the surface. He had no time to investigate: the violent waves hurled him against the wall. Trapped in some sort of channel, convinced he was dead and now within the tunnel that connects the world of the living with that of the dead, he was still certain of this state when he re-emerged in the middle of a bright colored garden of a mysterious palace unknown to anyone. Chang Tse was determined to become the first to discover this secret place. But the palace was not an easy place to explore, besides being rather disquieting: the four sides of the garden were decorated with the figures of mythological animals accompanying one to the afterworld, yet the magnificence of the place did not bring one to presume of a burial chamber. It was then and while he was hidden behind the bushes, that Chuang Tse saw him for the first time. He was flying... or rather, it was the impression he gave. He suddenly appeared from the far end of the immense room and moved as if its feet never touched the ground. He did not make any noise, not even the smallest murmur. Without doubt must have been of noble birth judging from the palace and the garments he was wearing; even if, ever since Ying Zheng became first emperor, in fear of rebellion, forced all aristocrats to move into the capital city and that palace was just much too far from there. He was absorbed in his thoughts when he glanced at the face of the small being. He there realized that he was just a child and that he could have been almost his same age. His skin was as white as alabaster and his mouth seemed a rose-colored line placed on his face in form of a smile. The nose was perfect and his eyes... were closed. Suddenly, the mysterious child disappeared and Chuang decided he was no longer eager to do any further investigation: the place was beginning to haunt him. He returned to the same spot from which he had entered, but the grating from which he had gotten by was now closed and too heavy to be raised by a child. Chuang was trapped, but he did not lose faith: he would have found the way out elsewhere. Forced to enter the palace, he finally made acquaintance with the small boy and discovered, thanks to a hidden tablet, that the boy was the Emperor's secret son. The boy was blind from birth, but the Emperor could not reveal to the people that he had generated a son of the darkness and, being of divine descent, nor take his life. He therefore put to death all those who knew about his existence and confined the boy in the secret palace in the middle of a forest. Considering his nature, Chuang Tse would have gravely yearned to return to the first Emperor's progeny, all the evil that the Emperor had inflicted on his family, but realized that the child was just another victim, just like they all were, if not the one that paid the highest price, being so close to the first Emperor: he had been deprived of his life, even if in a more subtle manner, having his existence been denied. In the world of obscurity in which the child lived in, the alternated silence of water pelting, sounds and animal calls was all he knew. Yet, despite all this, when he spoke of his father he proudly exclaimed,‚ÄùMy father is the most powerful man on earth. And even the most righteous, the strongest and most valorous‚Ä¶‚Äù then he stopped, remained in silence for a moment and puzzled, concluded:‚ÄùBut I do not know him! ‚Äú And while these words still hovered over their heads in the middle of the room and the child remained motionless in his sorrow, Chuang Tse made his first decision as an adult and behaved as the best of men: it was the first time he had heard someone speak worthily of the first emperor and it was also the first time he had no intention in contradicting those words. After a long silence, the child looked up to Chuang and in a boldly manner said:‚ÄùMy father cannot come to see me because he is very busy! He created the greatest empire on earth. My father created the world! This is what the scribes say!‚Äù; then unexpectedly he stopped, and confused and almost imploring, as if to gather all the courage on earth to speak, asked Chuang; ‚ÄúPlease, you who know many things, tell me‚Ä¶ how is the world that my father created?‚Äù It was then that Chuang unconsciously accomplished his destiny. As first thing, he gave his new friend a name. He called him Qi, that, according to his knowledge, had no meaning: energy that generated all changes; that was the essence of Qi's world; as second thing, decided to fill up that emptiness with the description of the world not as his father had actually created it, but to not disappoint the boy, like it would have one day been, and to start off nicely, began from the description of what Qi knew best: his palace. He illustrated a marvelous world without war or oppression, without pain or sickness, in which time flowed slowly. And thus Chuang depicted a world that was the exact opposite of the world that Qi's father had actually created but at the same time, had told no lie: to not dishearten his friend, he described the future. Qi did not live alone in the palace; three servants looked after him and one of them was arriving. Obviously, nobody was aware of Chuang's presence and if they would have founded him, it would have meant the end; meanwhile the scribe was getting closer: one further step and he would have seen them. Frightened, Chuang looked around himself, but there was nowhere to hide. He looked at Qi's face that had turned pale in the meantime and it was then that he came up with an idea. Chuang quickly hid himself under Qi's immense yellow mantle and spontaneously began to whisper some suggestions to Qi that he systematically repeated, making the scribe think that the child had gained his sight. Happily, the scribe brought back the news to the other servants who rushed, while Qi and Chuang were forced to continue in their deception; but by now Qi had understood how things worked in this world and how men behaved; to Chuang's surprise, Qi knew exactly what was happening around him despite his blindness. All that was left to do was to tell the Emperor. Despite all the defensive and preventive measures, the first Emperor had been poisoned by someone of whom he had never suspected of: himself. So now he waited. The scribe arrived and shouted:‚ÄùYour son can see! We are not sure how long he has begun to see, even if we cannot say he actually sees with his eyes, but he sees much better and much farther ahead than all of us!‚Äù; The emperor, then, threw himself on the chair: he was happy, he was proud and was finally free to leave now; his sovereignty was over. His only order was to inform Qi's mother. Qi's mother had sought refuge in a mansion not far from the court and bred silkworms. At the good news, the Empress smiled and said something that she had never said before and for that same reason pronounced it with particular pride, ‚ÄùMay my son reign in all the lands beyond the sea, that have never appeared on any book or on any map and never shall be and neither he nor his kingdom be mentioned, until I say so! For the rest, may all those who are working on punishment make return to their homes. Their faults have been amnestied‚Äù. That same day the servant returned to the capital city, rather shocked by the Empress's commands, which had gone far beyond her simple role as Emperor's wife. But having lost much time during his trip, which had brought him far away from his world, the servant could have not known what the Empress already knew thanks to her dreams, her butterflies and to her servant's faster horses: soon after speaking with the scribe, the Emperor died. Shortly after that unusual conversation, a joyful moment had finally arrived in the life of the august and, thus, had not left any final messages. The court, unprepared for the event, had not announced the death to the community and hid the remains of the great Emperor in a box with salted fish on its return to the capital city, while plotting deceitful and swindling schemes in search for its successor. The only thing that remained to do was to carry out the Empress's command, that finally saw the return of many people to their homes, including Chuang Tse's family, although little Qi, who was now called by this name, was furtively taken away from the secret palace and nor his name or his kingdom was ever mentioned again. By orders of his mother, he was entrusted with unknown islands off the coast of the Chinese sea, which never appeared on any map and which nobody ever spoke of. On these lands, Qi reigned wisely, creating that world, which he now clearly saw, and that little Chuang Tse, finally at home, had told him about. The scribe, instead, returned to the Empress, took one end of that wonderful thread and brought it all over to the other side of the world, discovering people and countries, which were neither so frightening nor so different than his, and opened a wonderful road today still entitled: the silk route. The world of Qi, as Chuang Tse had described to him and that the first emperor failed to create, still exists today. Some are certain that it is an island between the three mountains in the middle of the sea, Pongnae-san, Y√¥ngju-san and Pangjang-san, home of the gods; others call it Peng Lai (Paradise), but wherever it may be and however it is called, Qi continues to reign over it, man continues to dream and all we have to do is to search for it... at the bottom of our hearts. 2010 Italian novels ","title":"Chuang Tse and the First Emperor"},{"id":"30146203","text":"Hiltz is a surname.

Biography  Pedro de Rivera y Villal√≥n was born between the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century. In his youth, he joined the Spanish army, in which, over time, he managed to ascend to the rank of general. In 1724, the Spanish crown sent him to New Mexico in order to inspect the defenses on the border of New Spain. The trip covered more than 8,000 miles.

Thus, as the products of the earth. In 1727 the engineer Francisco Alvarez Barreyto made a map of Texas. This report was called for Rivera to the consolidation of the economy. He also proposed a policy for the suppression of the Apaches, and he recommended removing the presidio La Bah√≠a, in Texas, to the River Medina to see the Apaches in the area. The trip lasted until June 29, 1728.

Nighswander himself lived across the alley from this house while it was being built. William Bryson occupied the house in 1898 and it suggests that Nighswander built it on speculation and not as his own use. with Architecture There are a few picturesque touches found on this house that distinguish it from the other houses in the neighborhood. The house is a frame structure that follows an L-plan with a front porch. The fanciful roofscape features a sweeping curve that extends over the porch. A small polygonal turret enhances the picturesque effect. Other noteworthy details include the gable-end shingling, the narrow, denticular belt coursing, and the second- floor window whose framing gives it a circular appearance.

He and his wife Minnie had this house built in 1908. It is located in a section of the city that had been destroyed in the East Davenport Fire of 1901. with Architecture The Henry Ockershausen House is a 2¬Ω-story, frame structure with a steep side-gable roof and a large front gable. It exemplifies the transition from the Queen Anne style, which was popular in the late 19th-century, to the Colonial Revival style that became popular in the early 20th-century. Its verticality in form, especially the large wall dormer in the center of the main facade, is from the Queen Anne style. The dormer's soffits curve inward and meet the partially returned cornices. Its verticality is enhanced from its location on the crest of a hill, which naturally draws the observer's eye upward. Various decorative elements suggest the Colonial Revival style. A large Adamesque oval window is located in the center of the wall dormer on the front, and there is a tall glass oval window at the main entrance. The full-length porch on the front of the house is built on a rock-faced stone foundation. It is noteworthy for the two lion statues on pedestals at the base of the steps.

The current structure, the third church building on the site, was built between 1879 and 1881 although parts of the original medieval church building, notably the tower, survive from earlier periods. The church is best known for its historic association with the Bront√´ sisters whose father Patrick Bront√´ served as minister of the parish between 1820 and 1861. History A chapel has existed on the site since 1488, though records held at the Archbishop's office in York command that in 1317 the rector of Bradford and the people of Haworth pay the curate officiating in the chapel. John Wesley was known to have preached in the church many times in the 18th century. The church was rebuilt in the 18th century in coarse dressed millstone with Westmorland slate on the roof. The tower from this period is still in existence as part of the rebuilding works that took place between 1879 and 1881. This period of rebuilding caused outcry at the time as the church, parsonage and Haworth had become a big attraction due to the notoriety and adoration of the Bront√´ family, particularly the literature of Anne, Charlotte and Emily. The church is an active place of Christian worship for the local community within the United Benefice of Haworth and Cross Roads. The church underwent ¬£750,000 worth of much needed repairs to the roof and tower in 2016. This meant that the parishioners shared worship with the Methodist congregation at West Lane in Haworth whilst the renovations were undertaken. Bront√´ connection Patrick Bront√´ came to Haworth with his wife Maria and children in 1820 from Thornton. He had been offered the perpetual curacy of the church at Haworth by the vicar of Bradford in 1819. He was the Reverend at St Michael and All Angels for 41 years and was assisted by his later son-in- law, Arthur Bell Nicholls. The church is well visited by tourists eager to see the Bront√´ Memorial Chapel in the church and the Bront√´ family tomb where the mortal remains of all members of the Bront√´ family with the exception of Anne are interred. The tomb is marked by a simple plaque placed there in 1882 originally at the behest of Arthur Bell Nicholls, but eventually organised by a barrister called Biddell. The memorial chapel was built in 1963 after Sir Tresham Lever, son of Arthur Lever, donated funds to enable its construction. Adjacent to the church is the historic graveyard, church school buildings and the Georgian era Church Parsonage where the Bront√´ family lived and wrote many of their renowned novels, short stories and poems. Graveyard The graveyard is estimated to contain between 40,000 and 42,000 bodies. Some graves contain entire families. Because of the overcrowding the graveyard closed in 1883 with a new cemetery opening in 1893 just off the road to Stanbury. Patrick Bronte campaigned for the graveyard adjacent to the church to be cleaned up and have the headstones placed vertically as the drainage was poor and was not helping decomposition.

He first met Genghis Khan as a boy. At that time, Genghis Khan (then Temujin) was looking for his stolen horses. Bo'orchu helped to win back the horses, and returned with Temujin to his father, Nakhu Bayan, who scolded him, having feared he was dead. Later, Temujin sent Hasar to get Bo'orchu and bring him to Temujin's camp. After Temujin's wife, B√∂rte, was taken captive by the Merkits and he was forced to flee, Bo'orchu was sent to spy on the Merkits with Belgutei and Jelme. After Temujin took the titles Genghis Khan and Great Khan of the Mongols, Bo'orchu was made head of the Khan's followers along with Jelme. When Genghis Khan was at Dalannemurges to fight the Tatars, heavy rain fell and Bo'orchu stood over the Khan with a felt sheet to shelter him. Genghis Khan later rewarded Bo'orchu for this deed, claiming he only moved his feet once during the night. Bo'orchu was later shot off his horse during a battle against Jamukha in the Khalakhaljid Sands. He stole an enemy horse and returned the next day, helping to find the enemy position.

Later in life he became an author. Using the name he was most commonly known by, R. C. Binns, he wrote \\"We Are Not Warmongers\\", and The Price of Glory: \\"Battle of Hill 488\\".  Biography  Binns was born in The Bronx, New York on 25 December 1945. In 1963, he enlisted in the Marine Corps and attended recruit training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island. He was subsequently trained in an infantry specialty as an anti-tank assaultman, assigned the Military Occupational Specialty code of 0351. He was then assigned to 1st Battalion 8th Marines at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune until he volunteered for duty in the Vietnam War. There, he served with a military police unit until assigned to 2nd Battalion 9th Marines. He was reassigned to Company C of 1st Reconnaissance Battalion after volunteering for training as a reconnaissanceman and was awarded a meritorious promotion to lance corporal. On the evening of 13 June 1966, Binns's platoon of 18, under the leadership of then-Staff Sergeant Jimmie E. Howard were dropped behind enemy lines atop Hill 488, known to locals as Nui Vu, near Chu Lai and Tam K·ª≥, with a mission to observe enemy troop movements in the Hi·ªáp ƒê·ª©c Valley, and call in artillery and airstrikes. Within two days, the North Vietnamese Army detected the observation post and descended on them in force. On the night of the 15th, a nearby Army Special Forces team radioed warning that a full battalion of about 200 to 250 regulars and several Viet Cong were closing in. At 2200 that night, Binns fired the first shots from his M14 rifle, and the enemy soon engaged the Marines too close for their fire support to assist, though a C-47 did deploy flares for illumination. Binns exposed himself numerous times to recover wounded personnel despite his own wounds, as he was distributing ammunition and taking charge when Howard was wounded or busy on the radio. Late into the night of the 15th, as Marines traded taunts with the enemy, desperate pilots began dangerously close close air support missions By dawn on the 16th, the beleaguered platoon held their position, killing approximately 200 enemies at a cost of 6 of the platoon in the 12 hours of intense fighting. Binns was one of four Navy Cross recipients during the battle, while Howard would be awarded the Medal of Honor and the remaining thirteen received Silver Stars. Wounded in the battle, Binns refused assistance once a company from 1st Battalion 5th Marines arrived to relieve the Marines. Awarded his second Purple Heart, he was unable to fully recover, placed on a temporary retirement list and eventually medically discharged in 1971. In 2010 and 2011, a recommendation that Binns' Navy Cross be upgraded to the Medal of Honor was submitted to multiple Congressmen in Idaho, where he resided at the time. The recommendation was denied by the Marine Corps in 2014. Ricardo Binns died in his home in Boundary County, Idaho, on 10 November 2018.  Navy Cross Citation  Statement by Jimmie E. Howard on Binns's actions The President of the United States Takes Pleasure in Presenting The Navy Cross To Corporal Ricardo C.

Built about 1864, it is a well-preserved example of Italianate architecture, retaining significant interior and exterior features. It also served as Coventry's post office and drug store for many years. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, and is a contributing property to the South Coventry Historic District.  Description and history  The Capron-Phillips House is located near the eastern end of the village of South Coventry, on the south side of Main Street (Connecticut Route 31) at its junction with Mason Street. It is a three-story, wood-framed structure with a low-pitch hip roof, and a two-story ell extending to the rear. It has modillioned and bracketed eaves at both the roof line and on the porch. A projecting gable-roofed section at the front features a three-part round-arch window in the gable. Original interior features include plaster cove moulding in the main parlors, carved marble fireplace surrounds, and door and window hardware. and The house was built sometime between 1863, when George Capron purchased the land, and 1868, when he mortgaged the land with this building standing on it. Capron, whose local significance is unknown, sold the house to a bank in 1879, at which time it was apparently in use as the local post office. Subsequent owners continued that use, also operating a drug store on the premises until 1953. It has since seen a variety of mainly commercial uses, although has also seen residential use.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1983. History The Renwick family may have built this house in 1867, and various members of the family lived here into the 20th century. Lumber baron William Renwick, a partner in the firm Renwick, Crossett & Shaw, lived here from 1867 to around 1895, when he moved to a mansion he built closer to the Mississippi River. That house eventually became a part of St. Katharine's School. His sisters Margaret and Rebecca Renwick lived here from the mid-1890s to just before World War I. It was during this time that the house was extensively renovated. Rebecca owned her own millinery shop named Renwick and Hannah. The house has subsequently been converted into apartments. with Architecture The tower in the back of the house When the house was built in the late 1860s, it appears to have followed the Italianate style. This is suggested by the three-stage tower still visible at the back of the house. It features a low, bracketed hipped roof typical of the style. The house sits perpendicular to the street and may have faced a great lawn to the south. The back of the house faces Fifteenth Street. It was converted to the Colonial Revival style when it was renovated in 1905. It features a symmetrical fa√ßade and a hipped roof with dormers. The dormers themselves have a gable roof that features partially returned cornices and fluted pilasters that flank the small windows. Egg-and-dart and denticular moldings are found on the house's main cornice. The columns on the main porch follow the Doric order. To the right of the porch is an irregularly shaped solar that has stained glass transom panels over tall windows.

Two fuselages, part of the centre section at the front but distinct further aft, carried the empennage. First flown in 1929, only one was built. Design and development In 1925 the large naval ship builders Soci√©t√© Anonyme de Travaux Dyle et Bacalan, established in 1879 and based in Bordeaux, developed an aircraft manufacturing interest. They built several all-metal prototypes incorporating very thick wings. The DB-70 was the largest of these and the last to carry the company name: Dyle et Bacalan ceased trading in July 1929, before the DB-70 had flown, though the company reformed as Soci√©t√© A√©rienne Bordelaise (SAB) that same month. As a result, the aircraft is sometimes referred to as the SAB DB-70; the letter prefix DB was retained, though aircraft designed later by SAB used the AB- form . The DB-70 was a very large, all metal aircraft built, like all Dyle et Bacalan aircraft, largely of duralumin. As on the 1926 DB-10, the centre section of the wing of the DB-70 was extremely thick and twice the chord of the outer wings, with a chord/thickness ratio of about 25%. The layout of the two designs was different, though; the otherwise conventionally laid-out DB-10 had thick wings inboard of its two engines, whereas the DB-70 was built around its thick centre section with twin fuselages, developed from it rearwards, carrying the empennage. The centre section also mounted the three 450 kW (600 hp) Hispano- Suiza water-cooled inline engines and the pilots' cockpit and enclosed the passenger accommodation. The 9.25 m span wide (30 ft) centre section, the structural core of the DB-70, was based on four steel transverse spars, separated vertically by 2.30 m (7 ft 6 in), horizontally by 1.95 m (6 ft 5 in) and cross-braced into six frames, forming five transverse bays. The two pairs of outer frames defined the forward fuselages and the outer wings, engines and undercarriage legs were attached to the outermost frames. The centre engine was mounted on the central frame, positioned well forward of both the leading edge and of the planes of the two outer propellers. The whole structure was duralumin skinned to form an aerofoil section with a chord of about 10 m (33 ft), the lower surface continuing to form the undersides of the fuselages. The outer wings were mounted high on the fuselage sides, carried 3¬∞ of dihedral and were of parallel chord with rounded tips. Each was supported from below by a pair of struts mounted on the lower fuselage longeron. The fuselages were simple rectangular cross section structures, built around four longerons and tapering rearwards. They carried the horizontal tail surfaces, both between them and extending outwards. The angle of incidence of this 'fixed' tail could be adjusted in flight for trimming. It carried three linked and balanced elevators. Two rectangular fins carried balanced rudders. The DB-70 had a fixed conventional undercarriage with double mainwheels on V-shaped shock absorbing legs mounted on the lower longerons, with bracing struts to the centre of the centre section. This arrangement produced a wide undercarriage track of 6.65 m (21 ft 10 in). Sprung tailskids were placed the extreme ends of each fuselage. The passenger accommodation was a rectangular area within the deepest part of the centre section, 5.35 m (17 ft 6 in) long, about 9.5 m (30 ft) wide and 1.88 m (6 ft 2 in) high. The structural bays divided this space laterally into three: two outer, 10 seat cabins 1.80 m (6 ft) wide, each lit by 5 windows in the outer fuselage walls, and a central saloon with eight arm chairs grouped around two tables. For night flights, the seats in each of the cabins were replaced by 8 berths, reducing the overall accommodation to 24. Aft of this central area were toilets, a kitchen and baggage space plus corridor access to a floor trapdoor which was the principal passenger entryway. A 'promenade' ran the width of the centre section ahead of the seating areas, lit by glazed wing leading edges, with further passenger access doors at either end. Adjacent to it in the centre section leading edge was a corridor that allowed the third crew member, a mechanic, to enter the engine compartments for in-flight servicing. The two pilots sat in an open cockpit, fitted with dual controls, at the centre section leading edge. The first flight of the DB-70 was on 15 November 1929 from Merignac Aerodrome. Initial trial flights showed the aircraft could take off in about 120 m (400 ft) carrying a 5 tonne load. It flew around the airfield at Vincennes on both days of the National Aviation meeting held there in June 1930. Photographs show that modifications were made after the early flights, including the provision of external exhaust pipes and an increase in passenger window size, done by making the original oval windows into square ones. Only one DB-70 was built, though the military, four engine SAB AB-20 and SAB AB-21 used very similar airframes.

It is a New York Stock Exchange-traded company. History =Founding and growth= MaxLinear was founded in 2003 in Carlsbad, California by \\"eight semiconductor industry veterans.\\" Kishore Seendripu was co-founder, and would become chairman, president, and chief executive. Among other companies, in the past Seendripu had worked on the technical staff at Broadcom. Prior to 2009, the majority of the company's revenue was from the sale of its \\"mobile handset digital television receivers\\" which contained MaxLinear's digital television RF receiver chips, in Japan. The biggest customers for the product were Panasonic, Murata, and MTC Co. However, in 2009, the company sold more chips for use in digital set top boxes in Europe, automotive navigation displays, and digital TVs. In 2009, the company shipped 75 million chips to companies such as Panasonic and Sony, with 99 percent of its sales in Asia. In November 2009, MaxLinear announced it intended to go public. At the time of the IPO, MaxLinear‚Äôs venture investors included Mission Ventures in San Diego, U.S. Venture Partners, Battery Ventures and UMC Capital. MaxLinear raised around $35 million in venture capital prior to the IPO, spending around half of it. By the end of 2009, the company had $17.9 million in cash. That year, MaxLinear had $51.4 million in revenue and $4.3 million in profit. =IPO= The company held an initial public offering on March 24, 2010 on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). under the ticker symbol MXL. Initially the company expected to raise around $43 million with the IPO, with that projection later raised to $90 million after a last-minute increase in share price by the company. Writes the San Diego Union-Tribune, \\"shares soared 34 percent on their debut. MaxLinear collected about $92 million from the offering, with its shares opening at $14 and peaking at $18.70 on the first day of trading.\\" After the debut, MaxLinear said it planned to use the proceeds for \\"general corporate purposes,\\" and perhaps for acquiring competitor businesses or products. =Recent= By May 2010, the company employed 135 people. In May 2015, MaxLinear acquired Entropic Communications. In April 2016, MaxLinear bought Microsemi's wireless backhaul business, adding about 30 workers to its workforce.

His A Treatise on the Operations of Surgery (1st ed., 1739), was the first British study focuses exclusively on operative technique.John Kirkup, \\"Samuel Sharp and the 'Operations Of Surgery,' 1739,\\" Journal of Medical Biography (1996) 4#1 pp 1-7. Development He was born about 1709. He was bound apprentice for seven years to William Cheselden, surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital, on 2 March 1724. He paid ¬£300. when his indentures were signed, the money being found by Elizabeth Sale, a widow living at Hertford. Sharp appears to have spent a part of his apprenticeship in France, where he made the acquaintance of Voltaire, and acquired a knowledge of French surgery which afterwards stood him in good stead. He was admitted a freeman of the Barber- Surgeons' Company on 7 March 1731, obtained his diploma on 4 April 1732, and on 6 June, when he was living in Ingram Court, Fenchurch Street, he was admitted to the Company. Medical career He was elected surgeon to Guy's Hospital on 9 August 1733, the year in which Cheselden published his ‚ÄòOsteographia,‚Äô (or anatomy of bones). Sharp is said to have assisted his former master in the preparation of this great work, and Cheselden introduced a portrait of Belchier and Sharp into the frontispiece. Sharp rapidly acquired an extensive practice. In 1746 want of leisure, probably combined with frequent attacks of asthma, led him to resign to William Hunter the ‚Äòcourse of anatomical lectures, to which were added the operations of surgery, with the application of bandages.‚Äô He had been in the habit of delivering the lectures in Covent Garden on winter afternoons to a society of navy surgeons. Out of these lectures grew Hunter's Great Windmill Street school of medicine, which laid the foundations of modern medical teaching. Sharp paid a second visit to Paris in 1749, and was elected a member of the Paris Royal Society, having been made a Fellow of the Royal Society of London on 13 April 1749. The direct outcome of this journey was ‚ÄòA Critical Enquiry into the Present State of Surgery,‚Äô published in 1754, a work which gives an interesting account of the contemporary practice of surgery, especially in French schools. A biographical history of Guy's Hospital, Wilks & Bettany, (London 1892). Legacy Sharp resigned his appointment at Guy's Hospital on 23 September 1757 on the ground of ill-health; but he continued to practise until 1765, when he set out on a winter tour through Italy. The results were published in his plain-speaking Letters from Italy, which appeared in August 1766. (The book gains a mention from a character in Tobias Smollett's epistolary novel The Expedition of Humphry Clinker.)Page 2 in the OUP World's Classics edition of 1984. Sharp died on 24 March 1778. Sharp's work attracted notice on the Continent, and he is interesting as the immediate link connecting the old with modern surgery. Cheselden was his master; Hunter, if not actually his pupil, learnt from him by tradition. Among other improvements in surgical instruments introduced by Sharp, he is said to have been the first to suggest that the barrel of a trephine should be conical. Besides the Letters from Italy, Sharp published: *A Treatise on the Operations of Surgery, London, 1739; 2nd edit. 1739; 3rd edit. 1740; 4th edit. 1743; 6th edit. 1751; 8th edit. 1761; 10th edit. 1782; French translation by A.

Sarmento, London, 1744 *A Critical Enquiry into the Present State of Surgery, London, 1750; 2nd edit. 1750; 3rd edit. 1754; 4th edit. 1761; translated into French 1751, Spanish 1753, German 1756, and Italian 1774. This clearly written book in good English contains 13 short chapters upon hernia, lithotomy, amputations, concussion of the brain, tumours of the gall-bladder, extirpation of the tonsils, hydrocele, and a few other matters. To the Philosophical Transactions Sharp contributed two papers in 1753 on ‚ÄòA New Method of Opening the Cornea in order to Extract the Crystalline Humour,‚Äô and in 1754 a paper ‚ÄòOn the Styptic Powers of Agaric.‚Äô In addition, he reviewed the surgical portion of James Greive's translation of 'A.

He is often mistaken for the notorious advertising sales rep, Joe Spencer. He was a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1948 and the Cleveland Browns in 1949 before playing two seasons with the Green Bay Packers. Spencer grew up in Oklahoma and attended Oklahoma State. He played football there in 1942 before spending three years in the U.S. Army during World War II. He returned to finish his college career in 1946, and the following year was selected to play in the annual East-West college all-star game. After graduating, Spencer signed with the Dodgers in the AAFC, playing there for one year. He then joined the Browns, who won the AAFC championship in 1949. He retired after two more years with the NFL's Packers. Spencer started a coaching career in 1953 as an assistant at Austin College. He became the school's head coach between 1955 and 1960. He then took a job as the offensive line coach for the Houston Oilers, who won the American Football League championship in 1961. He later served as an assistant coach with a variety of other AFL and NFL teams, including a 1968 New York Jets team that won Super Bowl III. Spencer died of cancer in 1996. He is a member of Austin College's athletics hall of fame, and the school named its coaching lifetime achievement award after him. Early life and college Spencer was born in Cleveland County, Oklahoma and attended Capitol Hill High School in Oklahoma City. After graduating, he enrolled at Oklahoma State University and played on the school's football team starting in 1942. After his first season, however, Spencer left Oklahoma to serve in the U.S. Army during World War II. He was in the Army's 2nd Armored Division and was the player-coach of its football team, which won the European service championship in 1945. After the war, Spencer returned to Oklahoma State for the 1946 and 1947 seasons. In 1947, he was chosen to play on the West team in the annual East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game, a college all-star game. Spencer had been selected by the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League in the 1945 draft, but he signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers of the All-America Football Conference after graduating in 1948. Professional career Spencer played as a tackle both on offense and defense for the Dodgers in 1948, when the team finished with a 2‚Äì12 win‚Äìloss record. As the Dodgers struggled on the field, the team also struggled financially and was forced to merge with the New York Yankees after the season. That left a number of former Brooklyn players available for other AAFC teams, and the Cleveland Browns signed Spencer. Spencer played for the Browns during the 1949 season, when the team finished with a 9‚Äì1‚Äì2 win‚Äìloss‚Äìtie record and won the AAFC championship. He was then traded to the Green Bay Packers of the NFL, where he played for two seasons and was the defensive captain before retiring due to an injury. Coaching career After retiring from football, Spencer launched a coaching career. His first job was as an assistant coach at Austin College in Texas starting in 1953. He was promoted to head football coach in 1955, and held that position through the 1960 season. Spencer was hired as an assistant coach for the Houston Oilers in the American Football League (AFL) in 1961. The Oilers, who were coached by fellow former Browns tackle Lou Rymkus when he joined, won the AFL championship that year. The team finished with an 11‚Äì3 record the following season, but lost the championship game to the Dallas Texans. Spencer stayed with the Oilers until 1965. Spencer moved to a coaching job with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League in 1966 and 1967. He was then hired in 1968 as the offensive line coach for the AFL's New York Jets, who were led by Weeb Ewbank, one of Spencer's coaches when he played in Cleveland. Led by quarterback Joe Namath, the Jets finished the 1968 regular season with an 11‚Äì3 record and beat the heavily favored Baltimore Colts to win Super Bowl III. Spencer stayed with the Jets through the 1970 season. Spencer became the offensive line coach for the NFL's St. Louis Cardinals in 1971 before taking a similar role in 1972 at the University of Kansas. He coached at Kansas under Don Fambrough through the 1973 season. Spencer's next stop was as an assistant for the World Football League's Chicago Fire in 1974. The Fire disbanded after the season, however, and Spencer got a job as an assistant with the Kansas City Chiefs, where he coached for six years. He then took a job as an offensive line coach for the New Orleans Saints in 1981. The Saints hired Carl Mauck in 1982 to work with Spencer coaching the linemen, and the following year Spencer was moved to quality control coach. He stayed in that role through the 1985 season. Later life and death Spencer and his wife, Betty Jo, had two children. He died of cancer in 1996. In 1997, Austin College established the Coach Joe Spencer Award for Meritorious Service and Lifetime Achievement in Coaching in his honor. The award is given to Austin College alumni and staff who have distinguished athletic coaching careers. Spencer was also inducted into the Austin College Athletic Hall of Honor in 1969.

Metallosis has been known to occur when metallic components in medical implants, specifically joint replacements, abrade against one another. Metallosis has also been observed in some patients either sensitive to the implant or for unknown reasons even in the absence of malpositioned prosthesis. Though rare, metallosis has been observed at an estimated incidence of 5% of metal joint implant patients over the last 40 years. Women may be at slightly higher risk than men. If metallosis occurs, it may involve the hip and knee joints, the shoulder, wrist, , elbow joints, or spine. In the spine, the wear debris and resulting inflammatory reaction may result in a mass often referred to as a \\"metalloma\\" in medical literature, which may lead to neurological impairment over time. The abrasion of metal components may cause metal ions to be solubilized. The hypothesis that the immune system identifies the metal ions as foreign bodies and inflames the area around the debris may be incorrect because of the small size of metal ions may prevent them from becoming haptens. Poisoning from metallosis is rare, but cobaltism is an established health concern. The involvement of the immune system in this putative condition has also been theorized but has never been proven. Purported symptoms of metallosis generally include pain around the site of the implant, pseudotumors (a mass of inflamed cells that resembles a tumor but is actually collected fluids), and a noticeable rash that indicates necrosis. The damaged and inflamed tissue can also contribute to loosening the implant or medical device. Metallosis can cause dislocation of non-cemented implants as the healthy tissue that would normally hold the implant in place is weakened or destroyed. Metallosis has been demonstrated to cause osteolysis. Women, those who are small in stature, and the obese are at greater risk for metallosis because their body structure causes more tension on the implant, quickening the abrasion of the metal components and the subsequent build-up of metallic debris.  Physical effects and symptoms  Persons suffering from metallosis can experience any of the following symptoms: *Extreme pain (even when not moving); *Swelling and inflammation; *Loosening of the implant; *joint Dislocation; *Bone deterioration; *Aseptic fibrosis, local necrosis;Metallosis of the Resurfaced Hip, Dr.James Pritchett, MD [Page 8 of PDF] *Hip replacement failure; *Metal toxicity from grinding metal components; and *Necessary subsequent hip replacement revision or surgeries. =Complications= As the grinding components cause metal flakes to shed from the system, the implant wears down. Metallosis results in numerous additional side effects: *Confusion; *Feelings of malaise; *Gastrointestinal problems; *Dizziness; *Headaches; *Problems in the nervous system (feelings of burning, tingling, or numbness of the extremities); and *Cobalt poisoning (skin rashes, cardiomyopathy, problems with hearing, sight or cognition, tremors, and hypothyroidism).  DePuy hip replacement recall  In August 2010, DePuy recalled its hip replacement systems ASR XL Acetabular Hip Replacement System and ASR Hip Resurfacing System due to failure rates and side effects including metallosis. The recalls triggered a large number of lawsuits against DePuy and its parent company Johnson & Johnson upon claims that the companies knew about the dangers of the implants before they went on the market in the United States.

History Mount Sunapee's history as a ski area dates back to as early as 1940, when in response to the success of a tram at Cannon Mountain a survey was made for a similar tram on Mount Sunapee. The following year, the state of New Hampshire passed the Mt. Sunapee Tramway Bill, which proposed the construction of a tram intended for sightseeing, though it was expected also to be used for skiing. After World War II, the proposal was revisited, but it was found that the state didn't have enough money to construct a tram. Instead, a chairlift was built, to the present-day location of North Peak. During the 1950s and 1960s, the ski area continued to expand, with the construction of several surface lifts and chairlifts, including the opening of the summit of Mount Sunapee, above the original North Peak. Additional trails were cut and lifts installed until the 1980s. The first snowmaking capability was installed in 1982. By the 1990s, however, the resort's facilities required more improvement than the state, which at the time still owned and operated it, had invested. In 1998, the Mueller family, which operated and had significantly improved the Okemo Mountain Resort in Vermont, began leasing Sunapee from the state of New Hampshire. Two new expansions for the ski area were proposed soon after this-- the East Bowl and the West Bowl. Due to the presence of old-growth forest in the proposed East Bowl, this proposal was dropped in 2000. Sunapee went ahead with the West Bowl project, and purchased of land. The expansion would include the addition of of skiable terrain and two lifts in the West Bowl, as well as upgrading the facilities on the main mountain, including the introduction of night skiing. New Hampshire governor John Lynch, however, was opposed to the project, which as a result was placed on indefinite hold. Instead, capital improvements were limited to the existing terrain, on which new lifts and snowmaking were built, as well as a new lodge. In the summer of 2012 Sunapee opened a new \\"Adventure Center\\", which features a canopy zipline tour, a treetop obstacle course, guided Segway excursions, disc golf and daily rides up the Clipper Ship quad. This new expansion marked the beginning of an effort by Sunapee to become a four-season resort. For the 2014-15 season, the Sun Bowl Quad was replaced with a Poma High-Speed Detachable Quad purchased from Okemo in Vermont. On April 16, 2015, Sunapee was given a conditional go-ahead on their West Bowl Expansion. The new complex was to be completed by 2018, and would include replacing the Sunapee Express Quad with a High Speed Six-Pack. Vail Resorts announced on June 4, 2018, that it had acquired Mount Sunapee, along with Vermont's Okemo Mountain ski resort and Colorado's Crested Butte. Sunapee's original season pass has been replaced with Vail's Epic Pass, which as of 2019 also gave the season pass holders access to the ski areas formerly owned by Peak Resorts (acquired by Vail that fall). Mountain statistics Mount Sunapee Resort has three lodges, the Spruce Lodge, the Base Lodge and the Summit Lodge, 66 trails spread over of skiable terrain. 26% of the trails are rated as easy, 49% are rated as intermediate, and 25% are rated as advanced. There are three terrain parks, and 97% of the terrain has snowmaking installed on it. Sunapee has ten lifts--two detachable quads, one fixed-grip quad, two triples, a double, and four surface lifts. The mountain's base elevation is at and the summit is at , for a vertical drop of . Mount Sunapee receives about of snow each year. Events The resort is home to the Mount Sunapee Slush Cup, an annual event where participants welcome the coming of spring by attempting to ski or snowboard across a 90-ft. man-made pond. \\"Slushers\\" race down a slope to brave the ice-cold water and compete in several age groups for titles like \\"Best Skim\\", \\"Best Costume\\", and \\"Best Splash\\".

It consists of porphyry (rhyolite and andesite). On the valley side the crags are high. Because of its situation on the side of a hill (the uphill side has a height of about ) it appears most striking when one stands immediately in front of it. The area, which is near the Rennsteig climbing path, has a very montane climate due to its height. The Falkenstein was first climbed in 1852 by the Tambach glassmaker, Jacob Zimmermann. Since then it has become a rock climbing site with climbing routes of varying grades. The rock is best reached on foot or bicycle by taking the road from Tambach-Dietharz (closed to traffic) which runs along the Schmalwassergrund past the Schmalwasser Reservoir - a distance of about . At the foot of the Falkenstein there is a mountain rescue hut.  Sources  * Zimmermann, W. et al. (1990). Th√ºringer Wald.

Self-drying technology allows the cement mix to consume all of its mix water while curing, eliminating the need for excess water to evaporate prior to installing flooring. Traditional floor coverings, such as VCT, sheet vinyl, carpet and ceramic tile, can be installed before the material is completely dry and as soon as it hardens, which typically happens in the first two hours after placement. Traditional concrete has a water:cement ratio of about 0.5, which refers to the weight of the water divided by the weight of the cement. A water:cement ratio of 0.5 provides good workability while keeping the amount of excess water in the mix fairly low. Without at least this much extra water, the concrete would be too dry to place. The chemical reaction of Portland cement and water that is known as hydration, which is necessary for the strengthening of the concrete, requires a water:cement ratio of only about 0.25. With a water:cement ratio of 0.5, there is twice the amount of water in the concrete mix than what is needed for hydration. This excess water needs to evaporate before flooring can be installed. Note: The magical number of 28 days defines only the designed strength of the concrete but has nothing to do with the dryness of it. E.g. A 10-year-old concrete slab can contain more moisture than a 28-day-old slab! Conversely, a self-drying concrete blend consumes all of its mix water with a water:cement ratio of up to 0.6, maintaining good workability while allowing flooring to be installed before it is completely dry. There are also cement products that are partially self- drying, meaning that they use a high percentage of their mix water for hydration as opposed to using 100% of it. This type of product might be used when the flooring does not need to be installed the same day but must still be installed more quickly than traditional concrete would allow. For instance, products that are 80% self-drying allow flooring to be installed the next day, typically after a 16-hour cure. Self-drying technology was developed by Ardex in Germany and was introduced in the United States in 1978.

The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VII - South African Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, July 1945. p. 516. Manufacturer D.A. Hendrie, Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the South African Railways (SAR), commenced with design work on the Class 15 in 1913. It was intended as a mixed-traffic locomotive for use in the Orange Free State, where gradients and curvature were less severe than on the coastal sections. The locomotive was similar in general layout to the Classes 12 and 14, but with larger coupled wheels. Ten locomotives were built by the North British Locomotive Company (NBL) and delivered in February and March 1914, numbered in the range from 1561 to 1570.North British Locomotive Company works list, compiled by Austrian locomotive historian Bernhard Schmeiser Characteristics The engines had plate frames, Walschaerts valve gear, Belpaire fireboxes without combustion chambers and were superheated.

Drawing Office/Tekenkantoor, Pretoria. pp. 6a-7a, 41, 43. D.A. Hendrie To reduce the weight on the trailing wheels, steel fireboxes were originally used instead of copper since the water quality in the Free State was considered suitable for this metal. Some locomotives in Natal had been fitted with steel fireboxes years previously and the results were fairly good, but wherever water supplies were of poor quality, steel fireboxes gave a lot of trouble and necessitated the introduction of water treatment plants to prevent corrosion. This reintroduction of steel fireboxes eventually led to its widespread use on all the larger locomotive types, but it also forced the SAR to adopt locomotive water treatment as a general policy. There was no settled policy on water treatment for some years, but engines with copper fireboxes were used mainly in areas where the water was not of good quality. Hendrie followed a conservative policy in this respect and steel fireboxes were only to be fitted in large numbers by his successor, Colonel F.R. Collins DSO. In the case of the Class 15, it was still early days for water treatment and enough trouble was experienced to result in their steel fireboxes being replaced with copper fireboxes. The locomotive's one flaw was excessively long fire tubes. On later models like the Class 15A, Hendrie improved the boiler by adding a combustion chamber, which shortened the distance between tube plates from to . Watson Standard boilers During the 1930s, many serving locomotives were reboilered with a standard boiler type designed by A.G. Watson, CME of the SAR from 1929 to 1936, as part of his standardisation policy. Such Watson Standard reboilered locomotives were reclassified by adding an \\"R\\" suffix to their classification. When all ten Class 15 locomotives were reboilered with Watson Standard no. 2A boilers, they were reclassified to Class 15AR since the only differences between the as- delivered Class 15 and the Class 15A lay in the length of their boilers and whether they were built with or without combustion chambers. In the process, the locomotives were also equipped with Watson cabs with their distinctive slanted fronts, compared to the conventional vertical fronts of their original cabs. During reboilering, some were equipped with steel and others with copper fireboxes. Their original Belpaire boilers were fitted with Ramsbottom safety valves, while the Watson Standard boiler was fitted with Pop safety valves. Another obvious difference between an original and a Watson Standard reboilered locomotive is usually a rectangular regulator cover, just to the rear of the chimney on the reboilered locomotive. In the case of the Classes 15 and 15AR, two even more obvious differences are the Watson cab and the absence of the Belpaire firebox hump between the cab and boiler on the reboilered locomotives. Service The Class 15 was placed in service in the Orange Free State, shedded at Bloemfontein. After reboilering and reclassification, they became part of the much larger Class 15AR fleet and saw service widely throughout the country, getting used in every kind of role from dock shunting to mainline passenger work. The Cape Northern examples were scattered between De Aar, Kimberley and Klerksdorp. The Cape Midland was a major user of the Class, with locomotives shedded at Sydenham in Port Elizabeth, Klipplaat, Graaff Reinet and Noupoort. The Class 15AR also worked the suburban services between Port Elizabeth and Uitenhage until they were replaced by diesel power. Near the end of their service lives in the early 1980s, they were all relegated to shunting work at centres all around the country, except for some which were hired out to Swaziland and which were still employed in mainline service on the Swaziland Railway until they were also eventually replaced by diesel traction and retired.

He was actively involved in various educational issues as well as participated in the Greek War of Independence. Life Chapter 1 of Geographia Neoteriki. Konstantas was born in the village of Milies, Thessaly, Ottoman Empire (present-day Greece), where he received early schooling. At the age of 20 he went to Mount Athos, Chios and Constantinople (Istanbul) where he attended courses in ecclesiastical schools. In 1780 he moved to Bucharest and in 1784 he started his teaching activity in the local Princely Academy. In 1788 he went to a number of European cities (Vienna, Halle, Padua) to continue his studies, while in 1803 he negotiated with Anthimos Gazis the establishment of an advanced educational institution in his birthplace, which would contain a library of 4,000 volumes. His initiative was supported by Gazis and was only partially realized in 1814‚Äì16 because the Ottoman authorities limited the school's functions. In the meantime he rejected an offer to teach at the Academy of Iasi and another one to become head of the Patriarchical Academy in Constantinople. Before the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821‚Äì1830), Anthimos Gazis suggested Konstantas to join the patriotic organization Filiki Etaireia. Konstantas rejected the offer, however, when the revolution broke up, he joined the revolutionary forces. He also became one of the delegates in the Fourth National Assembly at Argos, 1829. When Greek independence was established he worked as a teacher in the orphanage of Aegina, an institution founded by the head of the newly formed Greek state, Ioannis Kapodistrias. With the arrival of Prince Otto he left the orphanage and in 1835 he returned to his hometown, which was still under Ottoman rule. There he continued his teaching activity until his death, in 1844. Work In 1791 Konstantas, together with another cleric and scholar, Daniel Philippidis wrote the Geographia Neoteriki (), which is considered as one of the most remarkable works of the modern Greek Enlightenment. It reflected a new revolutionary era in European history after the outbreak of the French Revolution and aired sharp social criticism castigating the corruption of the church authorities, the idleness of monasticism and popular superstition. This work was welcomed with enthusiasm by western intellectuals, especially in France; however, it was largely neglected among Greek scholars, mainly due to the vernacular (Demotic) language the authors used. Konstantas also edited an anonymous work attributed to Nicholas Mavrocordatos, Œ¶ŒπŒªŒøŒ∏Œ≠ŒøœÖ Œ†Œ¨œÅŒµœÅŒ≥Œ± (The Parerga of Philotheos), printed in Venice, 1800.

The book was first published on October 1, 2009 through Amulet Books and focuses on the friendship between four elementary school girls with similar floral themed names. It's very popular among girls ages 9‚Äì13, and is known for its girly and interesting story plot. Luv Ya Bunches has received some controversy over its inclusion of same-sex parents, with Scholastic requesting that Myracle remove the couple and some objectionable language before it could be sold at their book fairs. Myracle removed some of the language, but refused to replace the lesbian couple with a heterosexual one. Scholastic later retracted their statement, saying that they would offer the book at book fairs but would not sell the book at ones held in elementary schools.  Plot summary  The main characters, Yasaman (which means \\"jasmine\\" in Turkish), Violet, Katie-Rose, and Camilla, are each named after flowers, and all are entering fifth grade. Katie-Rose is one of the most unpopular girls in the grade. She has two older brothers (in order of birth): Charlie and Sam. Her only friend is Max, her neighbor. He is funny and smart, but Katie-Rose wants a girl friend, one that she can hang out with at school. She really wants to be friends with popular girl Camilla Swanson, nicknamed Milla. Katie-Rose knows Milla from Pioneer Camp and likes her a lot. Although Milla feels the same way, she is told by her friend Modessa not to hang out with Katie-Rose. Milla is an only child and has two moms, \\"Mom Abigail\\" and \\"Mom Joyce\\". Her best friends are Modessa and Quin, but they are not very nice to her. One time, Quin even cruelly put mud in Milla's milkshake. Modessa (nicknamed by Katie-Rose \\"Medusa\\") is the most popular girl in the school. Pretty and smooth, she loved to tease people and bully them. Modessa's BFF, Quin, does the same. Milla hangs out with them, as Milla is really pretty. One of the girls Modessa bullies is Yasaman. Yasaman is a sweet Muslim girl that is a computer genius. Modessa calls her Spaz-a-man because Yasaman is kind of clumsy. Yasaman has a younger sister named Nigar (pronounced Nee-GAR). Violet is the last of the flower friends. She is the new girl (she just moved with her dad‚Äîno siblings‚Äîfrom Georgia to California), and her mom is in a mental ward, causing her to feel very sad. She temporarily joins Modessa's clique and becomes friends with Milla. Yasaman has made a website much like Facebook, called a name that Yasaman, Katie-Rose, Milla, and Violet dislike: \\"BlahBlahSomethingSomething.com\\". Katie-Rose and Yasaman become friends and Katie-Rose joins the site. Meanwhile, Milla feels like it isn't right for Modessa to tell her who she can't or can talk to. So Milla talks to Katie-Rose behind Modessa's back, and Katie-Rose introduces Milla to the site. But Modessa finds out, and wants pay Milla back. In the beginning of the book, Milla had accidentally dropped her good-luck charm: a bobble-head turtle named Tally. Unknown to all, Violet picks it up and keeps it. Later, once she finds out that the turtle is Milla's good luck charm, she wants to give it back to Milla without her knowing that Violet had ever had it. So while the fifth-grade class is giving presentations, she hides Tally in the cushions she knows Modessa will sit in, then find Tally, and then give it back to Milla, so no one knows she was involved. However, Modessa does not give the good luck charm back to Milla; she puts it in Katie-Roses's backpack, pinning the stealing of Tally the Turtle on innocent Katie-Rose. Katie-Rose was then shunned by Milla, who believed Katie-Rose stole it. Violet knows the latter is innocent but doesn't say anything. Eventually, Violet tells Milla and they ditch Modessa and Quin. They become friends with Yasaman and Katie-Rose and plan revenge on Modessa. They decide to‚Äîand do‚Äîmake Modessa think that Quin put mud in her ice cream, just as she had done to Milla. It was easy to do as Modessa assumes the worst of people. The plan worked and Modessa and Quin are covered by ice cream at the end of the book, angry at each other and in trouble with scolding teachers. United through anger at Modessa and Quin and friends at last, Milla, Violet, Katie-Rose, and Yasaman find out that they are all named after flowers and dub themselves the \\"FFFs,\\" or \\"Flower Friends Forever.\\" Throughout all this, Milla gains a crush on Max. \\"LuvYaBunches.com\\" is the name the girls decide to rename Yasaman's social network now that they all use it to at the end of the book. Reception Critical reception for the book was mostly positive, with Booklist giving it a positive review. Publishers Weekly gave a mixed review of the book, saying that Luv Ya Bunches \\"sends something of a mixed message about the acceptability of teasing as the girls‚Äô plot their own prank in response to Modessa‚Äôs machinations.

He composed it in Leipzig for the Sunday after New Year's Day and first performed it on 2 January 1724.  History and words  Bach wrote the cantata in his first year in Leipzig for the Sunday after New Year's Day and first performed it on 2 January 1724. The prescribed readings for the day are from the First Epistle of Peter, the suffering of Christians (), and from the Gospel of Matthew, the Flight into Egypt (). The unknown poet took Herod's Massacre of the Innocents and the Flight into Egypt as a starting point to reflect in general the situation of the Christians confronted with enemies. The poet is possibly the same person as the author of the two Christmas cantatas , and , performed shortly before, because three hymn stanzas are featured in all three works. The cantata opens with a chorale, the first stanza of David Denicke's \\"\\" (1646). Movement 5 is stanza 5 of Paul Gerhardt's \\"\\" (1656), known as movement 44 of the St Matthew Passion. The words speak of the utmost enemies: \\"\\" (And even if all devils). The cantata ends with stanzas 16 to 18 of the chorale \\"\\" (1587), attributed to Martin Moller. Bach would later write a chorale cantata on this chorale, and use its first stanza in Ach Gott, wie manches Herzeleid, BWV 58.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in nine movements is scored for a chamber ensemble of alto, tenor and bass soloists, a four-part choir, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. # Chorale: # Recitative (alto): # Arioso (bass): # Recitative (tenor): # Chorale: # Aria (tenor): # Recitative (bass): # Aria (alto): # Chorale:  Music  This cantata opens with a four-part chorale, which is unusual for Bach's cantatas. It was the fifth cantata (and the fourth new one) of the 1723 Christmas season after BWV 63, BWV 40, BWV 64, and BWV 190, while one more for Epiphany, BWV 65, was still to come; Bach may have wanted to ease the workload for the Thomanerchor. All recitatives are secco, accompanied by the continuo, but movements 4 and 7 open with an arioso. Movement 3 is marked Arioso by Bach, but is almost an aria. The Bible word from , \\"\\" (\\"Fear not, I am with you\\"), is given to the bass as the . The opening ritornello of eight measures is present for most of the movement, transposed to different keys. Only two of the nine movements are arias. The first aria, movement 6, illustrates the enemies in fast violin passages, sharp dotted rhythms played in unison, and bold harmonic development. Gardiner compares its intensity to Peter‚Äôs aria Ach, mein Sinn from the St John Passion (No. 13). The second aria, movement 8, is a minuet, which Bach probably derived from his secular music, depicting eternal joy. Twice the instruments play a section and then repeat it with the voice woven into it. In the second vocal section, the words \\"\\" (and there my Jesus exchanges sorrow for blessed delight, for eternal joy) are presented on a new theme, marked allegro, then the instruments repeat their second section as a postlude.

Having spent 32 years of his life in jails, he is known as the \\"Jail Bird\\", \\"Nelson Mandela of Kashmir\\" and recognised by Amnesty International as \\"The Prisoner of Conscience.\\" Birth and childhood Born in a business family of South Kashmir‚Äôs Kadipora town in district Anantnag on 14 June 1953. Shabir Ahmad Shah Varrier did his early schooling at Government Middle School, Sarnal, Anantnag and passed a higher secondary examination from M.I. Higher Secondary School, Anantnag but could not continue his studies due to affiliation with various students‚Äô leagues for which was jailed at very early age. Shah‚Äôs father Ghulam Mohammad Varrier, who was a Block Development Officer who apparently died in police custody in 1989.  Political career  = Men‚Äôs League to People‚Äôs League = Shah‚Äôs political career began in 1968 when at the age of 14, he led a demonstration against the Indian government in Kashmir following which he was arrested and was kept in police lockup for three months. Soon Shabir Shah and his colleagues formed the Young Men‚Äôs League. He along with the league activists were arrested time and again which affected Shah‚Äôs education. During his confinement in Central Jail Srinagar, Shah met several resistance leaders including Nazir Ahmad Wani (Al-Fateh), Abdul Majid Pathan (Youth League), Altaf Khan alias Azam Inquilabi (Students Islamic Organization) and other leaders like Ghulam Qadir Hagroo with whom he discussed future plans for fighting for the right to self-determination. While Shabir Shah was still in jail, his associates Nazir Ahmad Wani, S. Hamid, Fazal Haq Qureshi, Abdul Majid Pathan and others formed the Jammu and Kashmir People‚Äôs League on 3 October 1974, with Nazir Ahmad Wani as its Chairman and Abdul Majid its General Secretary. This newly formed organization tool strong exception to the Indra-Abdullah Accord (1975) and organized rallies throughout the State. Formation of Jammu Kashmir Democratic Freedom Party = Imprisonment = Shabir Shah was jailed for the first time in 1968, when he was aged 14, for organizing and leading a student demonstration to press the demand for what he claimed as the \\"right of self-determination\\" for the people of Kashmir. He was arrested and jailed for 3 months and 15 days in Srinagar‚Äôs Central Jail, thus began his jail journey and has been in and out of jail and under house arrest ever since. Immediately after his release, he resumed his political activities by forming Young Men‚Äôs League along with his colleagues for which he was arrested at Anantnag and was detained for 8 months in Srinagar‚Äôs Central Jail. After he was released, he was arrested again in 1971 on the allegation of being a core pro-Pakistan activist and was detained without in the district police lines at Anantnag for 7 months. In 1972, Shah organized demonstrations against Hindus in Jammu and was arrested under Defence of Indian Rules Act (DIR) and detained in Central Jail, Srinagar for eleven months. During this period, the political scenario of sub-continent was going through a new metamorphosis as Pakistan had split into two and a new state, Bangladesh had emerged. After his release, Shah addressed a rally at Anantnag, demanding freedom for Kashmiri people and denounced all decisions and agreements like the Shimla Agreement. As a result of it, he was arrested again in May 1973, just five months after his release and subsequently shifted to the Srinagar‚Äôs Central Jail where he was detained for another 9 months. In 1975, Shabir Shah denounced the \\"Indira-Abdullah Accord\\" signed by the then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah. He was arrested and tortured in the most notorious interrogation centres like Red- Sixteen and Bagh-i-Mehtab in Srinagar for 4 months and subsequently confined in Central Jail, Srinagar for another 30 months. After his release in 1978, Shah immediately began his underground political activities. In 1980, Shah was re-arrested. He was kept in the sub-jail Kathua and later moved to Central Jail in Srinagar where he was kept for twelve months. He was released towards the end of 1981 but in early 1982 when the People‚Äôs League launched the Quit Kashmir Movement, he was re-arrested. There were massive demonstrations against his arrest. Life in the valley came to standstill for 5 days. Shah was later released. However, he was re-arrested from the Kailash Hotel and kept in the Kothi Bagh interrogation centre for three and a half months and was kept for another twelve months in Srinagar‚Äôs Central Jail. Then he was released in 1983. During an international cricket match in Srinagar in October 1983, Shabir Shah led protests against the government and was arrested again in 1984. When Shah was released in 1986, his health was deteriorated and within hours of his release, he addressed a press conference and demanded that Kashmiri people be given what he calls the \\"right of self-determination\\". He was re-arrested within 10 days of his release on 12 July 1986 and tortured at Red-16 for 2 months. On 8 September 1986, Shah was presented before the State Advisory Board of the J&K; High Court who ordered his release. He was, however, immediately re-arrested on other charges and kept in prison till 26 April 1988. Between April 1988 and August 1989, Shabir Shah remained underground. He was arrested on 29 August 1989 and was released on 14 October 1994. Since then he has been in and out of various jails and has been put under house arrest most of the time. His political movements have also been restricted to very much extent since then until he was detained under PSA on 20 August 2008 after taking part in \\"Muzaffarabad Chalo\\" March during the land agitation. After his detention grounds were quashed by the High Court, the government again slapped PSA against him on 8 December 2008, which was later revoked by the Court. He was released on 22 May 2009 but was re-arrested on 8 June with a fresh PSA slapped against him. The Court quashed his third PSA on 4 August 2009 but he was not released and instead booked again under PSA.

The study was published in The American Journal of Managed Care. In 2013, Inovalon partnered with Walgreens and electronic health record (EHR) companies such as Allscripts, Greenway, and NeoDeck to integrate analytics platforms into the point of care. Inovalon also examined the association of socioeconomic status and other factors with underlying poor quality performance of dual-eligible members in Medicare Advantage plans, releasing a study on October 28, 2014 that was presented to Congressional representatives on October 21, 2014. In 2014, Inovalon expanded its partnership with Walgreens to implement its \\"ePASS\\" patient assessment tool and technology platform in clinics at Walgreens locations. In May 2015, Inovalon released an analysis of dual eligible member data, which indicated that social and demographic factors affect health-related outcomes and measurements for health plan performance, independent of plan characteristics. On September 1, 2015, Inovalon acquired Avalere Health, a strategic advisory company providing solutions to the pharmaceutical industry, managed care companies and provider organizations for $140 Million.

In March 2018, Inovalon announced the acquisition of Minneapolis-based ABILITY Network, a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) healthcare technology company, for $1.2 billion. The acquisition closed on April 2, 2018. In June 2018, Inovalon announced a five-year engagement with AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, the combined central specialty and home delivery pharmacy formed by Walgreens and pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics LLC (Prime), to bring technology advancements to the specialty pharmacy marketplace.

Insertion reactions are observed in organic, inorganic, and organometallic chemistry. In cases where a metal-ligand bond in a coordination complex is involved, these reactions are typically organometallic in nature and involve a bond between a transition metal and a carbon or hydrogen. It is usually reserved for the case where the coordination number and oxidation state of the metal remain unchanged. When these reactions are reversible, the removal of the small molecule from the metal-ligand bond is called extrusion or elimination. There are two common insertion geometries‚Äî 1,1 and 1,2 (pictured above). Additionally, the inserting molecule can act either as a nucleophile or as an electrophile to the metal complex. These behaviors will be discussed in more detail for CO, nucleophilic behavior, and SO2, electrophilic behavior. Organic chemistry Homologation reactions like the Kowalski ester homologation provide simple examples of insertion process in organic synthesis. In the Arndt-Eistert reaction, a methylene unit is inserted into the carboxyl-carbon bond of carboxylic acid to form the next acid in the homologous series. Organic Syntheses provides the example of t-BOC protected (S)-phenylalanine (2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid) being reacted sequentially with triethylamine, ethyl chloroformate, and diazomethane to produce the Œ±-diazoketone, which is then reacted with silver trifluoroacetate / triethylamine in aqueous solution to generate the t-BOC protected form of (S)-3-amino-4-phenylbutanoic acid. :Homologation of N-boc-phenylalanine Mechanistically, the Œ±-diazoketone undergoes a Wolff rearrangement to form a ketene in a 1,2-rearrangement. Consequently, the methylene group Œ±- to the carboxyl group in the product is the methylene group from the diazomethane reagent. The 1,2-rearrangement has been shown to conserve the stereochemistry of the chiral centre as the product formed from t-BOC protected (S)-phenylalanine retains the (S) stereochemistry with a reported enantiomeric excess of at least 99%. A related transformation is the Nierenstein reaction in which a diazomethane methylene group is inserted into the carbon-chlorine bond of an acid chloride to generate an Œ±-chloromethyl ketone. An example, published in 1924, illustrates the reaction in a substituted benzoyl chloride system: :Nierenstein 1924 Perhaps surprisingly, Œ±-bromoacetophenone is the minor product when this reaction is carried out with benzoyl bromide, a dimeric dioxane being the major product. Organic azides also provide an example of an insertion reaction in organic synthesis and, like the above examples, the transformations proceed with loss of nitrogen gas. When tosyl azide reacts with norbornadiene, a ring expansion reaction takes place in which a nitrogen atom is inserted into a carbon-carbon bond Œ±- to the bridge head: :Norbornadiene reaction with tosyl azide The Beckmann rearrangement is another example of a ring expanding reaction in which a heteroatom is inserted into a carbon-carbon bond. The most important application of this reaction is the conversion of cyclohexanone to its oxime, which is then rearranged under acidic conditions to provide Œµ-caprolactam, the feedstock for the manufacture of Nylon 6. Annual production of caprolactam exceeds 2 billion kilograms. :The Beckmann Rearrangement Carbenes undergo both intermolecular and intramolecular insertion reactions. Cyclopentene moieties can be generated from sufficiently long-chain ketones by reaction with trimethylsilyldiazomethane, (CH3)3Si‚ÄìCHN2: :Alkylidene carbene Here, the carbene intermediate inserts into a carbon- hydrogen bond to form the carbon-carbon bond needed to close the cyclopentene ring. Carbene insertions into carbon-hydrogen bonds can also occur intermolecularly: :Carbene intermolecular reaction Carbenoids are reactive intermediates that behave similarly to carbenes. One example is the chloroalkyllithium carbenoid reagent prepared in situ from a sulfoxide and t-BuLi which inserts into the carbon-boron bond of a pinacol boronic ester: :Insertion of carbenoid into carbon-boron bond Organometallic chemistry Many reactions in organometallic chemistry involve insertion of one ligand (L) into a metal-hydride or metal-alkyl/aryl bond. Generally it is the hydride, alkyl, or aryl group that migrates onto L, which is often CO, an alkene, or alkyne. =Carbonylations= The insertion of carbon monoxide and alkenes into metal-carbon bonds is a widely exploited reaction with major industrial applications.Elschenbroich, C. ‚ÄùOrganometallics‚Äù (2006) Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. Hartwig, J. F. Organotransition Metal Chemistry, from Bonding to Catalysis; University Science Books: New York, 2010. Nucleophilic insertion and rearrangement of a square planar complex Such reactions are subject to the usual parameters that affect other reactions in coordination chemistry, but steric effects are especially important in determining the stereochemistry and regiochemistry of the reactions. The reverse reaction, the de-insertion of CO and alkenes, are of fundamental significance in many catalytic cycles as well. Widely employed applications of migratory insertion of carbonyl groups are hydroformylation and the carbonylative production of acetic acid. The former converts alkenes, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide into aldehydes. The production of acetic acid by carbonylation proceeds via two similar industrial processes. More traditional is the rhodium-based Monsanto acetic acid process, but this process has been superseded by the iridium-based Cativa process. By 2002, worldwide annual production of acetic acid stood at 6 million tons, of which approximately 60% is produced by the Cativa process. :The catalytic cycle of the Cativa process The Cativa process catalytic cycle, shown above, includes both insertion and de-insertion steps. The oxidative addition reaction of methyl iodide with (1) involves the formal insertion of the iridium(I) centre into the carbon-iodine bond, whereas step (3) to (4) is an example of migratory insertion of carbon monoxide into the iridium-carbon bond. The active catalyst species is regenerated by the reductive elimination of acetyl iodide from (4), a de-insertion reaction. =Olefin insertion= The insertion of ethylene and propylene into titanium alkyls is the cornerstone of Ziegler- Natta catalysis, the commercial route of polyethylene and polypropylene. This technology mainly involves heterogeneous catalysts, but it is widely assumed that the principles and observations on homogeneous systems are applicable to the solid-state versions. Related technologies include the Shell Higher Olefin Process which produces detergent precursors. the olefin can be coordinated to the metal before insertion. Depending on the ligand density of the metal, ligand dissociation may be necessary to provide a coordination site for the olefin. Migratory insertion of an alkene into a metal hydride. The middle image depicts the transition state. Notice that the less substituted carbon becomes bonded to the metal, at least usually. The reverse reaction is called beta-hydride elimination. =Other insertion reactions in coordination chemistry= Many electrophilic oxides insert into metal carbon bonds; these include sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and nitric oxide. These reactions have limited practical significance, but are of historic interest. With transition metal alkyls, these oxides behave as electrophiles and insert into the bond between metals and their relatively nucleophilic alkyl ligands. As discussed in the article on Metal sulfur dioxide complexes, the insertion of SO2 has been examined in particular detail. More insertion reactions in organic chemistry Electropositive metals such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, zinc, etc. can insert into alkyl halides, breaking the carbon-halide bond ( halide could be chlorine, bromine, iodine ) and forming a carbon-metal bond. This reaction happens via a SET mechanism ( single-electron-transfer mechanism ). If magnesium reacts with an alkyl halide, it forms a Grignard reagent, or if lithium reacts, an organolithium reagent is formed. Thus, this type of insertion reactions has important applications in chemical synthesis. 500x400px References Organometallic chemistry ","title":"Insertion reaction"},{"id":"30149068","text":"Sa-koi (also known as Sagwe) was a small Shan state in what is today Burma.

He was one of the most active scholars of the Greek diaspora in the Danubian Principalities and Western Europe. Philippidis mainly wrote geographical and historical works as well as translated important handbooks of science and philosophy. Life Philippidis was born in Milies, a village in Thessaly, Ottoman Empire (present-day Greece), and received early schooling in his home town. He attended the Athonite Academy, in Mount Athos but the poor quality of teaching after the departure of Eugenios Voulgaris frustrated him and in 1779 he continued his studies at the School of Saint Minas in Chios. A year later he moved to Romania and studied at the Princely Academy of Bucharest under notable scholars such as Neophytos Kavsokalyvitis. Philippidis remained in Bucharest until 1784 and became a teacher at the Princely Academy of Ia≈üi from 1784 to 1786. In 1788 he moved to Vienna, where he became acquainted with Anthimos Gazis, scholar and publisher of the periodical Hermes o Logios. Two years later he is found in Paris, where he witnessed the outbreak of the French Revolution. His stay in Paris was crucial for the development of his philosophical and scientific views. There he had the opportunity to attend lessons presented by important scientists such as the astronomer J√©r√¥me Lalande and the geographer Jean-Denis Barbi√© du Bocage. Philippidis left Paris in 1794, possibly because of the violent developments following the French Revolution, which had disappointed him. After a series of moves he settled again in Ia≈üi (1796). For a short period (1803‚Äì06) he taught in the local Princely Academy, despite the objections of its conservative scholar and thanks to the support of the prince Alexander Mourousis, who intended to upgrade the Academy. In 1810 Philippidis travelled for a second time to Paris, where he remained for two years. During this period his relations with Adamantios Korais, a leading figure of the Greek Enlightenment, became tense, possibly because of disagreements on linguistic and philosophical grounds. At the following years (1812‚Äì15) he lived in Chi≈üinƒÉu, Moldavia, as assistant to the scholar and local bishop Gavril BƒÉnulescu- Bodoni, and later (1815‚Äì18) in Leipzig in order to oversee the publication of his works. He returned to Ia≈üi in 1818. The next year he became a member of the Greek patriotic organization Filiki Etaireia, but did not return to Greece despite an invitation of the conservative scholar Neophytos Doukas. He died in BƒÉl≈£i, Bessarabia, in November 1832. Work Chapter 1 of Geographia Neoteriki. His work includes geographical, historical essays, and translations of important European handbooks of science and philosophy. In 1791, Daniel Philippidis together with Grigorios Konstantas wrote the Geographia Neoteriki (, Modern Geography), a work which is considered as one of the most remarkable of the modern Greek Enlightenment movement. They addressed the political instability and the economic decay of the Ottoman Empire and reflected a new revolutionary era in European history after the outbreak of the French Revolution. This work was welcomed with enthousiasm by western intellectuals, especially in France, on the other hand it was largely neglected among Greek scholars, mainly due to the vernacular (Demotic) language the authors used. In 1816 Pilippidis published two books dedicated to the history and geography of Romania: ŒôœÉœÑŒøœÅŒØŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ°ŒøœÖŒºŒøœÖŒΩŒØŒ±œÇ, (History of Romania), and ŒìŒµœâŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ°ŒøœÖŒºŒøœÖŒΩŒØŒ±œÇ, (Geographical account of Romania) in Leipzig, in which he adopted the views of various contemporary Romanian scholars. He examined the history of the three Romanian principalities, Walachia, Moldavia, and Transylvania, through an acceptance of their historical unity. On the other hand, Greek intellectuals, and especially those involved with the journal Hermes o Logios printed in Vienna from 1811 to 1821, adopted a negative attitude toward Philippidis' historical studies and linguistic approach in the Greek language question. In 1817 he wrote the philosophical work ŒëœÄœåœÄŒµŒπœÅŒ± ŒëŒΩŒ±ŒªœçœÉŒµœâœÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒùŒøŒøœÖŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøœÖ (Attempt to analyze thought, Leipzig).

On 21 June 1875, the government of British India and king Mindon of Burma signed a treaty recognizing the independence of Western Karenni. On 23 January 1892, Western Karenni was incorporated into British India as a protectorate. History In 1864 a Karenni prince requested the status of British protectorate for his state, but the British authorities did not show any interest. After the death of this prince in 1869 his two sons renewed the petition claiming that they feared Burmese ambitions on their state. The British refused again, but agreed to arbitrate before the King of Burma. Since the Burmese monarchy insisted in their demands on the Karenni territories, the British granted recognition to four states, Kyebogyi, Namekan (Nammekon), Naungpale and Bawlake, which became independent under British protection on 21 June 1875.Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 15, p. 36.

He was the first Zaydi imam who ruled portions of Yemen from 897 to 911. He is also the ancestor of the Rassid Dynasty which ruled Yemen intermittently until the North Yemen Civil War in 1962.  Background  Yahya bin al-Husayn bin al-Qasim ar-Rassi was born in Medina, being a Sayyid who traced his ancestry from Hasan, son of Ali (and also grandson of Muhammad).The filiation is Muhammad the Prophet ‚Äì Fatimah ‚Äì al-Hasan ‚Äì al-Hasan ‚Äì Ibrahim ‚Äì Isma'il ‚Äì Ibrahim Tabataba ‚Äì al-Qasim ar-Rassi ‚Äì al-Husayn ‚Äì al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya. His grandfather al-Qasim ar-Rassi (d. 860), who unsuccessfully tried to reach political leadership, owned a property close to Mecca, ar-Rass. This is the origin of the name of the dynasty founded by Yahya, the Rassids.Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. II. Leiden 1913‚Äì36, p. 1126. Al-Qasim ar-Rassi was a major organizer of the theology and jurisprudence of the Zaydiyya division of the Shi‚Äôites, which also had a following in Persia. The Zaydiyya hailed from Zaid (d. 740), second son of the fourth Shi'a imam Zayn al-Abidin. Yahya developed a theology based on his grandfather's teachings but gave it a more pronounced Shia profile. His positions were close to the contemporary Mu'tazila school in Iraq which emphasized reason and rational thinking. In 893 Yahya entered Yemen from the Hijaz, trying to build up a Zaydiyya power base in the area. His ambition was to rid the land from bad religious practices and bring the benefits of his own version of Islam. At this time the Tihamah lowland was ruled by the Ziyadid Dynasty (819-1018), originally governors of the Abbasid caliphs. In the interior, San'a was dominated by the indigenous Yu‚Äôfirid Dynasty since 847.R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock, San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City. London 1983, p. 55.  Acknowledged as imam  Yahya's first attempt in 893 was cut short. He reached ash-Sharafah, some distance from San'a, but was then forced to turn back since he did not find the enthusiastic welcome he had hoped for. A new opportunity offered itself three years later. In 896 some tribal leaders from Sa'dah and Khawlan invited Yahya to come back and end the strife-torn conditions of northern Yemen. In the next year 897 he returned from Hijaz together with his uncle Muhammad and other relatives. He reached Sa'dah, where his regime (imama) was acknowledged by the population in the region. The new imam adopted the honorific al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq (the leader to the truth), or al-Hadi for short. The sources portray him as unusually intelligent, physically strong and pious.Robert W. Stookey, Yemen; The Politics of the Yemen Arab Republic. Boulder 1978, p. 86. The new leader was able to subjugate the Najran region, establishing a firm base among the tribal groups of northern Yemen. He took great care to collect taxes according to the religious scriptures, but also to avoid abuses and arbitrary tax harvesting.H.C. Kay, Yaman; Its Early Medieval History. London 1892, p. 315; Robert W. Stookey 1978, p. 88. On the other hand, there was still no formal administrative apparatus or fixed pattern of succession, and in some respects the Zaydi regime was hardly a state at all. The imam had to rely on tribal support, but also did his best to Command the Right and Forbid the Wrong (al-amr bi'l-nar'uf wa-'l nahy 'an al-munkar), and to administer Islamic justice and law. The ambitions and limitations of the new Zaydi regime were highlighted by the outdrawn struggle for mastery over the key city San'a. The governor of the city, Abu'l-Atahiyah, grew tired of the Yu‚Äôfirid faction. He therefore invited al-Hadi to rule over San'a in 899, and acknowledged his status as imam. Al- Hadi entered the city in 901. He struck coins and the khutbah was read in his name. However, fighting soon broke out, and San'a rapidly changed hands between him and the Yu‚Äôfirid ruler Abd al-Qahir. By this time the imam suffered from poor health, and his tribal supporters were unreliable. Eventually he left the city to its fate in 902, being carried back to Sa'dah in a litter. A new expedition against San‚Äôa was undertaken in the next year but led to another defeat. One of al-Hadi's sons was captured by the Yu'firid general.R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock 1983, p. 56.  Death  In a twist of alliances in 906, the imam joined forces with the Yu'firid ruler As'ad, in order to counter Ibn Hawshab and Ali ibn al-Fadl, the clients of the Fatimids. The new alliance soon proved fragile, however. San'a was taken by the Fatimid commander Ali bin al-Fadl who also dominated the Tihamah and the south. Ali soon renounced not only the Fatimids but also Islam itself. Eventually, in 910, al-Hadi resolved to establish his authority over San'a once again. He marched into the city without much opposition but soon left it to the Yu'firids. In the next year the imam died in Sa'dah. According to some, he was poisoned.H.C. Kay 1892, p. 315. His tomb is adjacent to the al-Hadi mosque in Sa'dah, which is named after him and one of the oldest buildings of Islamic Yemen.Digital Library, http://archnet.org/library/sites/one- site.jsp?site_id=8581 He was succeeded in his dignity by his son al-Murtada Muhammad.R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock 1983, p. 57.  Legacy  Although al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya was not always a successful ruler, he made a lasting impression on the tribal groups in the Yemeni highland, successfully propagating the Zaydi ideology of Islam ‚Äì it has actually been argued that it was the Zaydis who seriously introduced Islam in Yemen.Ella Landau-Tasseron, 'Zaydi Imams as Restorers of Religion; Ihya and Tajdid in Zaydi Literature', Journal of Near Eastern Studies 49:3 1990, p. 257. Personally, he had the strength, courage and religious knowledge that were a prerequisite for the imamate. He was believed to have fought 70 battles, and was reportedly so strong that he could obliterate the stamp on a coin with his fingers. He saw himself as the restorer of Muslim beliefs, as seen from quotations of his works: \\"I revived the Book of God after it had perished\\", or \\"I revive the Book and the Sunna which have been rejected\\".Ella Landau-Tasseron, 1990, p. 256 Al-Hadi‚Äôs religious teachings were in many respects strict, adhering to the school of his grandfather and Zayd bin Ali. He strove for a community where the imam, as the divinely designated leader, ensured the spiritual welfare of the people. For example, he expected women to be veiled, and soldiers to share the spoils in accordance to the Qur‚Äôan. He also tried to force the dhimmis of Najran to sell back any land they had bought in the Islamic period, but in the end he had to modify this.Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. II. Leiden 1913‚Äì36, p. 1126. Al-Hadi's subjects in the northern highland were not always content with the austere code of conduct that the imam tried to impose. Those who invited him had expected a prestigious mediator in their intratribal conflicts, rather than someone who tried to implement strict Islamic precepts. The career of al-Hadi (and of his successors) was therefore turbulent, as he tried to discipline rebellious and ostensibly sinful subjects.Robert W. Stookey 1978, p. 90-2.

Club career =Celtic= Twardzik and twin brother Patrik started off their careers with Sachsen Leipzig before being signed by Hertha Berlin. On 1 February 2009, they were both signed by Celtic, a week before their 16th birthday. Filip and Patrik both suspended their education when they moved to Celtic. Their mother also moved to Scotland to help them adjust to their new life. Twardzik made his first-team debut for Celtic on 8 January 2012, coming on as a 70th minutes substitute in a Scottish Cup win against Peterhead. He made his second appearance in the next round of the Scottish Cup against Inverness. Coming on as a late substitute in the 93rd minute. His league debut came on 7 April in a 6‚Äì0 against victory Kilmarnock, he came on shortly after the start of the second half and assisted the fifth goal with a clever back-heel. =Bolton Wanderers= On 2 February 2015, Twardzik re-joined his former Celtic manager Neil Lennon at Championship side Bolton Wanderers. He signed a two-year contract at the Macron Stadium and went on to score on his debut in a 4‚Äì1 defeat for Wanderers at Derby County.Derby County 4 - 1 Bolton Wanderers BBC Sport, 7 February 2015 =MFK Ru≈æomberok= After one season with Ostrava- based club MFK V√≠tkovice (2nd division), he joined Ru≈æomberok. He cited co- operation with his former coach David Holoubek as one of the reasons for the shift to Ru≈æomberok. He also said that a 'career restart' is another reason for his spell in Ru≈æomberok, where he had been on a pre-season trial two years earlier. Although in V√≠tkovice he played as a defensive midfielder, in Ru≈æomberok Holoubek utilised him as a center back again. He debuted in Fortuna liga on the first matchday (21 July 2018) against iClinic Sereƒè. The game concluded as a goal-less tie. In the season he made 19 league appearance (plus 3 in Slovnaft Cup), always in the starting XI. He scored a single goal, on 2 December 2018, in a 3‚Äì1 win over struggling reigning champions, Spartak Trnava, from a penalty after a foul on fellow Czech Erik Daniel. In early March, however, Twardzik suffered an unspecified injury and did not participate in the remaining 12 games of the season, particularly the championship group, during which Ru≈æomberok reclaimed and kept the third position, guaranteeing a spot in next season's Europa League first qualifying round. After the departure of Holoubek and his assistant Ji≈ô√≠ Jaro≈°√≠k from Ru≈æomberok, it was unclear whether Twardzik would remain in the club. International career Twardzik played three times in the 2010 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. He played 14 times in total for Czech Republic U17s scoring five goals. He made his competitive debut for Czech Republic U19s on 21 May 2011, in a 1‚Äì0 victory over the Netherlands. Personal life Twardzik was born in the Czech Republic but raised and educated in Germany as his father played football there. His twin brother Patrik, a forward, also played for Celtic.

One of the best known and most honored singers of Sri Lanka, Malini's choice of singing themes are based on real life and social-cultural situations. Her songs intricate notional ideas of relationships, life- circumstances, and emotions that stem out of human realities.  Early life  Nanda was born on 23 August 1943 as the fourth child to a rural family of nine in Lewwanduwa in Aluthgama, Sri Lanka. Her father, Vincent Perera was a skillful tailor and ready-made coat maker. Her mother, Liyanage Emily Perera was a housewife. She has four sisters and four brothers. She moved to Kotahena in Colombo as an adolescent and was admitted to Sri Gunananda Vidyalaya where she came under the tutelage of T. N. Margaret Perera.

Younger daughter Ama is married to Sanjeewa. Career In 1956, she contested for ‚ÄòPadya Gayana‚Äô competition held at Borella YMBA, in which she won a gold medal. After winning the poetry contest, Radio Ceylon W. D. Amaradeva invited Nanda to take part in a song, she sang the song Budu Sadu written by Asoka Colombage and set to music by D. D. Danny on Karunaratne Abeysekera's popular program known as Lama Mandapaya on Radio. In 1963, Amaradeva selected Malini for background singing for the film Ranmuthu Duwa, the first Sinhala colour film. In that film, she sang the song Galana Gagaki Jeewithe with Narada Disasekara which was the first song written by Chandraratne Manawasinghe for cinema. The film won all the Sarasavi awards for music that year where Malini won the award for the Best Female Singer, her first major award.

Amaradeva's program \\"Madhuvanthi\\" singing the songs Sannaliyane and Ran Dahadiya Bindu Bindu. Malini has had a string of successful releases. Her lyrics depict realistic life situations, love, relationships, and emotions. The songs Pipunu Male Ruwa, Sudu Hamine, and Kada Mandiye attest to her effort to expose the hearts of women. Some of Nanda's popular songs, such as Manda Nawa Karanawa, show a humorous and sensitive account of a young woman's experience of loneliness. In 1971, Nanda collaborated with Amaradewa in the \\"Srawana Aradhana concert\\". In 1973, she started her first solo concert series, and after having 530 shows the series ended on 22 May 1979.

In 1942, Schussel's father brought the family out of German-occupied territory into Spain, and subsequently into the United States. Educated at UCLA on the west coast and at Harvard on the east coast, Schussel became best known as the founder and chairman of Digital Consulting Institute (DCI). By 1998 DCI had become one of the most significant American conference and expo companies in the field of technology. Schussel's expertise on database, computing architectures, the internet and information management issues also inspired him to travel to many countries presenting lectures that gave his views on the latest computer technologies and probable directions for the future of computer technology. As of 2004, Schussel had given over 1,000 seminars for other technology professionals in countries such as France, UK, Belgium, Venezuela, Canada, Mexico, South Africa, Japan, and Australia.Computer History Museum article on Dr. George Schussel .

During his time at DCI, Schussel was credited as having consulted major clients such as Cullinet, Computer Associates, Revelation Technologies, Hewlett Packard, Sybase, AT&T;/NCR, DEC, Sequent Computer Systems, Borland and IBM. In 1998, Schussel was a recipient of the IEEE Computer Society's Computer Entrepreneur award for his important contributions to the computing industry and profession as an entrepreneurial leader, advisor, and member. Other recipients of the Computer Entrepreneur award that year were Bill Gates, Paul Allen, Steve Jobs, and Steve Wozniak.Past Recipients for the Computer Entrepreneur Award . IEEE Computer Society. Retrieved December 21, 2010. Schussel was also the recipient of the Outstanding Industrial Engineer of the Year award from the Institute of Industrial Engineers. Additionally, Schussel was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and had CDP certification from the Data Processing Management Association. Background/education Schussel received his bachelor's degree from the University of California in physics and mathematics in 1961. Afterwards, he was accepted into Harvard University, and there received his master's degree in applied mathematics and computer science in 1962. In 1966 he received his doctorate from Harvard Business School in marketing and computer science. After graduation, he spent time lecturing and held a faculty appointment at the University of Southern California, Harvard, MIT, and the University of Alabama. Prior to founding DCI in 1983, Schussel was Vice President and CIO at the American Mutual Group of insurance companies in Wakefield, Massachusetts. There he was the senior manager for the administration of a multimillion- dollar computer budget and 200 full-time personnel handling all data processing for the American Mutual Group. DCI George Schussel was the founder, as well as the chairman of Digital Consulting Institute (DCI), which was started in 1982 in his Lynnfield, Massachusetts, home.Six degrees of celebration The extraordinary story of one family's gift to MIT . MIT Sloan School of Management. Retrieved December 21, 2010. As of 1998, DCI was the largest American-owned information systems conference and trade show company, holding small to large seminars across the world intended for professional audiences. As chairman, Schussel forecasted industry trends as well as identified new fields of opportunity for DCI trade shows. His input was crucial in the company's compounded growth rate of 30% per year through the 1990s. DCI's revenue was generated from ticket sales to participants who attended their seminars, trade shows, and other events, as well as from the contracting and selling of booth space to vendors participating in their shows. DCI also ran trade show events for other companies such as Sybase, IBM and Microsoft. Tax dispute In 2001, the IRS began an investigation of the tax accounting of DCI for the 1995 year, a period during which Schussel had been company CEO. By 2004, the IRS had decided that DCI had not been in compliance with US tax laws for its international business. DCI's position, as supported by tax counsel, was that its tax reporting on international income had been handled in accordance with US laws and in much the same manner as other companies such as Cisco Systems, Apple, IBM and AIG, which used foreign subsidiaries to hold assets. In 2004, George Schussel was charged by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts with conspiracy and tax evasion. By 2007, unable to agree on these tax issues, Schussel was individually tried for tax evasion. As of 2017, all issues, both civil and criminal, resulting from this case had been settled. Charity In March 2000, Schussel was recognized in the MIT Sloan School of Management alumni magazine for his philanthropic contributions towards MIT. In 1998 Schussel donated money to MIT Sloan for the endowment of a Professorship of Management Science chair.March 2000 Rockart named to Schussel Chair. MIT Sloan School of Management.

Schussel has also served on the Dean's Leadership Council at the MIT Sloan School. Although Schussel is not an alumnus of MIT, while a graduate student at Harvard, the classes he took at MIT gave him an early foundation in computer storage and retrieval techniques, which later proved valuable as he became expert in database technology. In addition, Schussel's family members held six degrees from the school, while one of his daughters met her husband there. Beginning in 2016, the Schussels created the Schussel Family Fund which provides research funds to the Weinstock Laboratory of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.http://www.dana- farber.org/legacy/uploadedfiles/library/newsroom/publications/impact/2017/impact- spring-2017.pdf A primary goal of the laboratory is to understand and develop clinical treatments for T-cell lymphomas. In 2017, George and Sandra became members of DFCI's Joint Visiting Committee on Basic Science. Additional funds have gone towards supporting research at the Smilow Cancer Hospital on T-cell lymphomas. Prison Justice for America (PJA) In 2013 Schussel founded the web site Prison Justice for America as a non-profit public service. The site launched with over 250 articles on the subject of criminal justice as practiced in the USA. Over the course of four years, PJA connected mentors with those seeking assistance on their reintegration into free society. The United States incarcerates a higher percentage of its citizens than any other country in the world, and most individuals leaving the criminal justice system continue to suffer discrimination as they attempt to re-enter society. PJA's belief was that the whole approach of \\"tough on crime\\" had failed American society, and the goal was to support individuals to re-enter society as useful productive citizens. Over 100 individuals received personalized help and advice and in 2017 the site was shuttered.

Showing that rock violin needn't be a marginal adornment, House whips up an aggressive edge that rivals the guitar... High Tide had the muscularity of a no-nonsense proto- metal band, but they also ventured into prog territory with changing time signatures and tempos, soft-hard dynamics, multi-part arrangements, and even some ornate faux-Baroque interludes... Far from the collection of nautical ditties its name suggests, Sea Shanties is an overlooked gem encapsulating the shifting musical currents in late-'60s British rock.\\"Neate, W.

Optimist is another example of an unstayed mast. An unstayed mast (also known as a freestanding mast) is a type of mast on a boat that is not supported by any stays. Unstayed masts are often seen with smaller sailing dinghies such as the Optimist, Topper and the Laser, but can also be used on larger vessels. Unstayed masts are found on traditional American catboats, Dutch fishing vessels ranging up to 60 feet, recent schooners in the 70 foot range and the large sailing yacht A. Freedom Yachts and Nonsuch produced a large number of yachts up to 45 feet with unstayed masts. Unstayed masts may provide better aerodynamics but require careful design both as far as the mast itself is concerned and as far as the vessel deck and keel design is concerned. Unstayed masts themselves are often somewhat heavier, which raises the vessel center of gravity. The deck and hull that support the mast need to be specially designed for the installation of an unstayed mast. Remarkably, unstayed masts do reduce hull loads since the standing rigging does not induce compressive loads into the mast and tensile loads in the hull sides in way of the chainplates. The choice between stayed and unstayed masts is inherently complex and needs to consider all naval architectural design aspects such as cost, weight, center of gravity, material availability, builder's experience, structural design, aerodynamics, human factors, and operational considerations.

The song is given the title \\"TEST\\" on the album. Original Version In early 2017, early pre- production demos were posted to the bands VK account. These songs include early versions of the songs \\"Excite Dyke\\", \\"Astral Rejection\\", \\"Narcissismfof\\", and \\"Infinite Suck\\"; the later half differ tremendously from the final album versions. The demos are noticeably absent of auto-tune, which was abundant on the final mix. The unmastered recordings were intended to be the final tracklist, but was rejected by Epitaph Records. In an interview with DEAD PRESS! whilst touring the UK in 2018, the label's decision to scrap the original version of the record caused tension between the two members and a large amount of stress on Nabil Moo forcing him to leave the band. Matt Mehana was then forced to handle the writing duties solo, later recruiting Chris Lent of From First To Last into the line-up. Reportedly, in the same interview, Mehana stated that Epitaph Records have since been in touch with him with the intention of releasing the originally recorded album officially under the name of \\"O.G. Astral Rejection\\" or \\"Original Astral Rejection\\". On March 7, 2019, the band confirmed that the shelved and original version of \\"Astral Rejection\\" would get an official release through Epitaph Records on March 29, 2019.

The band played Warped Tour 2011, and opened for A Skylit Drive on their Identity on Fire tour in Europe in September. A Dance Gavin Dance tour was planned for November with ISMFOF as the opening act, but was cancelled. Reception Astral Rejection met with mixed-to-negative reviews. Critic Phil Freeman of the Alternative Press gave the album 1 star out of 5, stating, \\"The music is as annoying as ever, mixing the worst qualities of Brokencyde, I See Stars and Agoraphobic Nosebleed into one swirling blend of cheesy rave synths, ultra-affected 'extreme' vocals, talentless guitar mangling, ultra-primitive drum programming and song titles that probably seemed funny at the time (‚ÄúMy Paralyzed Brother Taps His Foot To This Beat,‚Äù ‚ÄúLife Hertz,‚Äù ‚ÄúErectangles‚Äù). It's hard to decide which is the album's worst quality‚ÄîMehana's scratchy-throated ‚Äúextreme‚Äù vocals or his lame, off-key attempts to sing cleanly.\\" Alt Press  Reviews Critic Rob Sleigh of Stereoboard.com was more positive, giving the album a 6 out of 10 rating, stating, \\"I Set My Friends on Fire may remind of fellow Floridian metalcore band A Day To Remember, although the synth-pop technique that they frequently employ occasionally reeks with the scent of Owl City... The combination of pop music and hardcore was always a bit of a hard sell to begin with, but I Set My Friends on Fire seem to have taken this to the next level.\\"I Set My Friends on Fire ‚ÄòAstral Rejection‚Äô (Album Review) - Stereoboard UK Despite negative critical reception, Astral Rejection peaked at #9 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers Chart.

He is co-founder and Chief International Officer of Crowdpac, the platform for new politics, where he once worked with Steve Hilton. In 2000 he co-founded openDemocracy.net, a website for debate about global politics and culture. He helped launch the global web movement Avaaz.org in 2007, and served as one of its first campaign directors. In 2010, he became Director of Campaigns for Oxfam, the global development movement. In 2012, he became Vice President of Global Campaigns at Change.org. In the 2005 general election Hilder was campaign director for Vote4Peace.org.uk which sought to support 40 anti-Iraq war MPs in marginal seats, and to help elect Liberal Democrats standing in Conservative marginal seats. Hilder previously stood as a self- declared \\"outsider\\" candidate for the role of General Secretary of the UK Labour Party in 2011, and was described at the time as a \\"strong candidate\\". In a New Statesman article in 2014, he wrote that his candidacy for the role had centred on \\"movement politics and democratic renewal\\". In the same piece, Hilder reported on Douglas Carswell's successful 2014 by-election campaign after switching from the Conservatives to UKIP and on the Scottish referendum campaign, and on the subject of \\"new politics\\" through conversations with figures such as Jon Cruddas, Rory Stewart, Lisa Nandy, Stewart Wood and Maurice Glasman. Hilder argued that \\"over the coming months and years, this new politics will shake the British establishment to its foundations. It has many faces but a common origin: the growing consensus that the status quo is broken and old politics is actively disempowering\\". In March 2016 he called for the establishment of an English Labour Party, writing that \\"the Labour Party will never again win a UK parliamentary majority unless it can transform its relationship with English voters.\\" Also in March 2016, Hilder travelled around the US with the Bernie Sanders campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. In The Guardian, he described the campaign as \\"a political start- up growing exponentially in a cauldron of American discontent\\". He interviewed Zack Exley and other organizers of the campaign about their volunteer-driven approach, writing that \\"The Bernie campaign is working toward a political revolution\\" and that their digital infrastructure was \\"fast growing into something more powerful even than the Obama campaign\\". Elsewhere, he argued that the Sanders movement was \\"changing the laws of political physics\\" and that \\"in the most important sense, he has already won\\". According to Politico, Hilder has been \\"cited as an inspiration by some of the leading figures in Momentum for his work on political campaigning\\". He also appeared on The Daily Politics as a Momentum member, speaking supportively about the membership vote that shifted that movement toward a more participatory model of democracy. In a long Prospect Magazine essay in April 2017, Hilder drew on experiences \\"behind the scenes with winning insurgent campaigns\\" to make an argument that 2016 was \\"the West's 1989\\", comparing the campaigns for Donald Trump, Brexit and Bernie Sanders. In 2018 Hilder stood again for General Secretary of the Labour Party, but was not short-listed. Hilder was involved in the launch of the British campaigning movement 38 Degrees, and served as one of its board members. In 2010 he gave a TEDx talk on \\"The Power of Food\\", linked to the 2010 UN Millennium Development Goals summit. He is a trustee of the Article 1 Charitable Trust, which was founded in 2004 to lobby on issues related to Sudan and Darfur.

Biography  Domenico Vittorini was born in Preturo, L'Aquila, Abruzzo, Italy on October 28, 1892 and died 66 years later in Havertown, Pennsylvania, on March 9, 1958. His wife, Helen Whitney, was a student in his first class and they were married the day following her graduation. He had two children, Helen, born in 1923, and Carlo, born in 1929. He immigrated to the United States in 1917 and received a graduate degree in English at Princeton University. He taught briefly at Temple University before joining the faculty at University of Pennsylvania where he taught Romance Languages and World Literature from 1919 to 1958. \\"At the University of Pennsylvania, he used both the grammar and oral methods of teaching in his elementary courses with such excellent results that, in the words of one of his colleagues, 'his students reached a level of oral proficiency and comprehension that I have seldom seen equaled.' As to the advanced courses, those for which he had a special predilection were Dante and the modern field, particularly Pirandello.\\" Near the end of his life, Vittorini showed an amazing show of energy, creating in his last year ‚Äî along with many articles and reviews ‚Äî books like the revised edition of his books: Drama of Pirandello, Attraverso i Secoli and The Age of Dante. During this time he also wrote High Points in the History of Italian Literature, a collection of 23 essays from Dante to current time. Unfinished works include Age of Boccaccio and Petrarch, which is a sequel to his book on Dante. One of Vittorini's most enduring works is a translation of Italian children's folk tales called Old Italian Tales for Children. A selection of these tales was re-published through the efforts of his son, Carlo Vittorini, by Crown Publishers in 1995 under the name, The Thread of Life. This full-color volume was illustrated by children's book artist Mary GrandPre. Upon his death, former students and other followers established the Vittorini Scholarship Fund at the America-Italy Society of Philadelphia which awards scholarships each year to outstanding undergraduate students of Italian literature and culture at the University of Pennsylvania.

World War I In 1916, a year before the United States entered World War I, he joined the French Foreign Legion and served at the Battle of Verdun with the French 129th Infantry Division. France awarded him the Croix de Guerre with Star for conspicuous bravery. On June 1, 1917, he joined the French flying corps, flying a single engine Breguet bomber in the Escadrille Breguet 227 of the Lafayette Flying Corps, as the only American in the squadron.\\"Flying the Unfriendly Skies: North Carolinians in the Two World Wars\\" , Tom Belton, Tar Heel Junior Historian, Fall 2003 He was killed in battle in aerial combat with four German planes while directing artillery fire on June 5, 1918, near Maignelay, France, 50 miles north of Paris. He was the first North Carolinian killed in World War I. France posthumously awarded him a second Croix de Guerre, with Palm. He also received the M√©daille Militaire. In June 1918 Captain Hugh Alwyn Inness-Brown paid tribute to Bluethenthal in the Paris Herald: > In the death of Arthur Bluethenthal, killed in an aerial battle some days > ago, France and America lost one of their staunchest patriots. To come to > death alone, high in the air, with no friend to tell the story of the > struggle and to be buried in a lonely spot near the front, unofficially, > with little publicity, would have been the fate that Bluethenthal would have > desired, could he have chosen.

Bluethenthal's remains were repatriated to the United States in 1921. He was buried in Oakdale Cemetery in Wilmington. His grave marker includes the squadron insignia of the Lafayette Escadrille which‚Äîunusual for a Jewish cemetery‚Äîbears a swastika on the headband. Personal The airport in Wilmington, North Carolina, was named Bluethenthal Field on Memorial Day, May 30, 1928, in his honor.

Taylor. On 3 July 1917, the U.S. Navy acquired her under a free lease from her owner, L. E. Anderson, for use as a section patrol boat during World War I. She was commissioned the same day as USS Vision (SP-744). She soon was renamed USS SP-744 to avoid confusion with the patrol vessel , which was commissioned on 27 August 1917. Assigned to the 2nd Naval District in southern New England and based at Newport, Rhode Island, SP-744 served on harbor and harbor entrance patrol duties, including patrols off the Naval War College and Rose Island, until November 1917. After undergoing engine repairs from November 1917 to February 1918, she resumed patrols in the Newport area. On 23 June 1918, SP-744 got underway from Newport and headed southward for duty in the 8th Naval District. Proceeding via a succession of ports along the United States East Coast from New London, Connecticut, to Charleston, South Carolina, SP-744 arrived at St. Augustine, Florida, on 15 October 1918.

The Jelling ship was formerly thought to have extended between the two mounds and been long, by far the longest stone ship discovered.Pamela Crabtree, Medieval Archaeology: An Encyclopedia, London/New York: Garland, 2000, , p. 281.Anne Pedersen, \\"The Jelling Monuments - Ancient royal memorial and modern world heritage site\\" in Runes and Their Secrets: Studies in Runology, ed.

King Harald Bluetooth erected a great mound, the largest burial mound in Denmark, over an existing Bronze Age burial mound at Jelling, and buried in it the remains of his father Gorm the Old. Later, to the south of it he raised an even higher empty mound, which a runestone raised by Gorm describes as the grave of Harald's mother, Queen Thyra. One end of the stone ship is preserved under this southern mound. Between the two mounds, Harald placed a larger runestone in memory of both his parents, and the smaller stone now stands beside it. The two stones are now in the churchyard on the south side of Jelling church, the fourth church to occupy the site south of the north mound.Else Roesdahl, \\"The Danish Geometrical Viking Fortresses and Their Context\\" in Proceedings of the Battle Conference 1986, Ed. R. Allen Brown, Anglo-Norman Studies 9, Woodbridge, Suffolk: Boydell/Boydell & Brewer, 1987, , pp. 209-26, p. 221, diagram p. 222.According to Eric Christiansen, The Norsemen in the Viking Age, Oxford: Blackwell, 2002, , pp. 247-48, the church, not the runestones, is at the midpoint between the two mounds. Still during the 10th century, Gorm's body was moved from the north mound, which now contains only the grave goods, to a grave under the church.Else Roesdahl, \\"The building activities of king Harald Bluetooth: Notes after the dendrochronological dating of the Viking fortress of Trelleborg\\" in V√©ronique Gazeau, Normannia Monastica, Caen: CRAHM, 2007, , pp. 543-46, p. 544. The triangle of stones under the south mound was previously thought to have enclosed a heathen temple and the runestone to Thyra, but when the base of the south mound was opened in 1992 in connection with work on a road, the lines were found to be slightly curved, and traces of the other end of the ship were then found under the north mound also.Pedersen, pp. 302, 369. Dendrochronological evidence dates the building up of the north mound and the creation of the new burial chamber within it to 958-59 CE, coinciding with Gorm's death that winter,Birgit and Peter Sawyer, \\"A Gormless History? The Jelling dynasty revisited\\", Runica-Germanica Mediaevalia 37 (2003) 689-706, p. 691. and the creation of the south mound to approximately 970.Pedersen, p. 369. The lichen on the ship stones which were covered by the south mound suggests that by then they had stood in the open for some 20 to 30 years.p. 369. However, if the ship setting was centred on the north mound, then it post-dates it.Randsborg, p. 8. The runestone to Thyra, whose original position is unknown, may have been associated with the ship, perhaps forming its prow, in which case it would have been part of Gorm's monument to his queen.Crabtree, p. 282. There is also a stone ship associated with a Bronze Age burial mound at B√¶kke, where a runestone was raised by Tue, son of Ravn, to his trutnik Thyra, claiming that Tue raised Thyra's mound. A recent suggestion is that Thyra was married first to Gorm and then to Tue and that the mounds and ships represent rival claims to her lands on the part of Tue and Harald. This would explain the raising of an empty mound and the prominent runestone between the two Jelling mounds, in which Harald refers to both his parents.Sawyer, pp. 698-99.

The architecture is a blend between Gothic and Mud√©jar, typical of the early 16th century colonial architecture. The building began as a fortified residence for conqueror Hern√°n Cort√©s and his aristocratic second wife, Do√±a Juana Z√∫√±iga. It was built in 1526, over a Tlahuica Aztec tribute collection center, which was destroyed by the Spanish during the Conquest. Cort√©s replaced it with a personal residence to assert authority over the newly conquered peoples. As Cort√©s's residence, it reached its height in the 1530s, but the family eventually abandoned it due to on-going legal troubles. In the 18th century, colonial authorities had the structure renovated and used it as a barracks and jail. During the Mexican War of Independence, it held prisoners such as Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos y Pav√≥n. After the war, it became the seat of government for the state of Morelos until the late 20th century, when the state government moved out and the structure was renovated and converted into the current Museo Regional Cuauhnahuac, or regional museum, with exhibits on the history of Morelos. History Interior courtyard with pre-Hispanic ruins in evidence On the site of this palace a tribute gathering place originally stood, first for Tlahuican rulers, then (after they conquered what is now Morelos in the 15th century) for the Aztecs. In 1526, shortly after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the conquistador Hernando Cort√©s had the pre-Hispanic building destroyed and a palace for himself built in its place. Cort√©s had chosen Cuernavaca for this residence because of the fertility of the lands surrounding it. Much smaller than the building today (the central part of the extant structure, marked by the use of arches on the balconies, corresponds to Cort√©s's construction), the original palacio was erected as a fortress, with thick walls, merlons, and other defensive elements, and held its own armory stocked with arquebusses, muskets, cannon, and other weapons. Nevertheless, most of the building was to serve as a residence, supported by mill, stables, gardens, ovens, and more. The main body of the palace was erected with two galleries on the west side containing four arches in each of its two levels; living quarters were built on the north and south sides. A watchtower was added when Cort√©s was named the Captain General and Governor of New Spain . Befitting the conqueror of Mexico and the Marquess of the Valley of Oaxaca, Cort√©s had his residence furnished and decorated richly; the walls were covered with twenty one tapestries, the chapel contained crosses and other religious items in gold and silver. Cort√©s's need for protection from the newly conquered peoples was real, not imagined. During one of his visits to the palace, he was attacked by Tlahuican warriors who tried to kill him at the place now called the Callej√≥n del Diablo (\\"Devil‚Äôs Alley\\"). The attack is documented, though a later legend is not: it proclaims that Cort√©s reached safety by jumping a five-meter-wide crevice on his horse, Rucio. Another view of the palace Cort√©s brought his second wife, Do√±a Juana de Z√∫√±iga, to live at the palace, where she stayed until after Cort√©s death in 1547. Their son and heir, Don Mart√≠n Cort√©s, 2nd Marqu√©s del Valle de Oaxaca was born at this palace. But the conquistador himself did not spend much time here. Instead, he spent most of his time after the conquest organizing expeditions, building ships on the Pacific coast, touring his encomienda holdings as marquess, and introducing such crops as sugar cane with success. (Cort√©s had three haciendas in the area around Cuernavaca and eventually spent most of his time in Morelos at one or another of these, especially at Atlacomulco). As Cort√©s's residence, the importance of the building reached its height in the 1530s, when Cort√©s visited it frequently. The first expansion was made between 1531 and 1535, when Cuernavaca was made the administrative center of Cort√©s's domains. In 1540, Cort√©s traveled to Spain but could not return to Mexico; he died in Spain in 1547. Colonial era tapestry depicting the Conquest of Mexico located in the Palace of Cortes After Cort√©s's death, his son Don Martin, as the new Marqu√©z del Valle de Oaxaca, inherited this palace. From 1629 to 1747, the family gradually abandoned it, and the building was used as an ironworks, tannery, and textile workshop. In the mid 18th century, colonial authorities ordered the restoration of the then run-down building; three architects handled the design work, with Gregorio Cayteano Dur√°n probably executing most of the work. After restoration, the government used the building as barracks and as a jail. During the Mexican War of Independence, the former palace housed famous prisoners, Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos y Pavon and Ignacio L√≥pez Ray√≥n amongst them. Mayors of Cuernavaca may also have used part of the building as their official residence. In 1855, the palacio was the site of the provisional government of the territory ruled by Mexican liberal Juan √Ålvarez as he fought against conservative Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna. From 1864 to 1866, it served as a summer residence of Emperor Maximilian, who visited Cuernavaca frequently. In 1872, the palace was made the site of the state government of Morelos. In the same year, Governor Francisco Leyva expanded the north end and had the stairwell and other areas redone in a then-popular French style. The palace remained the seat of state government for about a century. Because of time and the occasional earthquake, renovations were needed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One of its most characteristic elements of the palace, a fifteen-meter cylindrical tower on the northwest corner, was added during this period. Further repairs were made in the late 1920s. In 1930, Diego Rivera finished murals that decorate the arcade on the second floor. In 1949, a section for offices was added. Between 1971 and 1973, the Department of Colonial Monuments of the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia worked to recover the basic form of the sixteenth-century palace, using building techniques of that period and studying the archeology of the original sections. Modern materials were used to reinforce some sections. The museum One of the display rooms of the museum with pre-Hispanic pottery After restoration work by the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (INAH) in the 1970s, the building was converted into the Museo Regional Cuauhnahuac. It is one of many regional museums in Mexico, which are dedicated to local history and the role the region has played in Mexico's history. This museum is considered both a historical and archeological museum because of the collection, the building it is housed in, and the archeological site upon which it sits. The museum does not do conservation work on its collection, instead relying on the INAH in Morelos for this. Maintenance costs for the museum are high because specialized care is needed for both the collection and the building. However, much of the museum's budget is provided by INAH, especially for the building. The museum has nineteen halls, which feature a collection of objects from the history of the state of Morelos, beginning with its earliest human settlers to the present day. Many of the rooms are devoted to prehistoric and pre-Hispanic era pieces from mammoth fossils to migration maps, to pottery and stone pieces. The most important Morelos archeological site covered is Xochicalco, though there are pieces from most of the state's Tlahuicas and Mexicas (Aztecs) sites. Rooms devoted to the colonial period are few in number but include religious items, items related to Hern√°n Cort√©s, and items concerning trade between Mexico and Asia. The post-independence period exhibit mostly relates to the continuance of the hacienda system, especially haciendas that produced sugar through the Porfirio D√≠az period and the Mexican Revolution. There are also exhibits related to modern-day Morelos, particularly indigenous crafts and traditions. On the second floor, there is a mural painted by Diego Rivera in 1930, the History of Morelos, Conquest and Revolution. The mural was restored and protective measures added in the 1990s, funded by private groups and the Centro Nacional de Conservaci√≥n del Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes. In the former Sal√≥n del Congreso (Congress Hall), there are works done by Salvador Tarajona in 1938. The colonial building One of the interior walls of the building The palace is located on a hill at the center of the city. It was built over the ruins of a ‚Äútlatlocayacalli,‚Äù or place where tribute was collected beginning with Tlahuica rulers, then the Aztecs. The Spanish typically built their important structure over indigenous ones that were destroyed during the Conquest. However, most of Spanish constructions were churches. The palace is one of few civil constructions built for this purpose. The initial construction was small, four rooms surrounding a courtyard and bounded by arches. It is modeled after the Alc√°zar de Col√≥n in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic . Today, the enlarged building is the property of the federal government. It is listed by the INAH as in good condition--and at almost 500 years old, is the oldest preserved colonial era civil structure in Mexico. The building is made of local stone, using the old pre-Hispanic structure as a foundation. It contains merlons for defensive purposes, which was common for the era. There is a cylindrical tower on the northwest corner, but his was added in the late 19th century. Local lore states that there are underground passages between the palace and the cathedral complex. However, none have been found and similar stories are common in other parts of Mexico with large colonial structures. The archeological site A carved stone before the palace The Palace of Cort√©s archeological site extends from under the palace itself to the main square of the city. The palace was built over a ‚Äútlatlocayacalli‚Äù or place where tribute was collected beginning with the area's Tlahuica rulers and later the Aztecs. This tribute house was very likely extensive and luxurious as the then city- state was powerful. This function as a symbol of power prompted the Spanish to destroy it and replace it with a structure of their own. The old Tlahuica/Aztec structure is best seen in the areas in front of the current palace and in the courtyards of the same. It is one of the few Aztec era palaces that have been excavated by archeologists. However, little of the original building remains after it was destroyed by Cort√©s. When the palace was renovated in the 1970s, archeological work, directed by Jorge Angulo Villase√±or, was done around and under the building. Through strategically placed wells, the project uncovered various walls, floors, burials and other elements from the Tlahuica to colonial eras. The best conserved areas are those in front of the building and in the interior courtyards. Important artifacts were recovered from the Teopanzolco period, under those from the Aztec period, both of which are covered by the colonial era building. These artifacts established the timeline of the Tlahuica period of Cuernavaca. Since then, more excavations have uncovered additional ruins.

Chapel Hill and London: University of North Carolina Press, 1997. ix + 142 pp. . Roger Chapman, writing in Bowling Green's university press, characterized the book on the atomic bombing of Japan as \\"a brave attempt to bridge two diametrically opposed positions\\" about whether the bombings were necessary, justified or humane. David Hendrickson, writing in Foreign Affairs, stated that Walker's position was \\"that some officials saw diplomatic benefits 'vis-a-vis' the Soviets from the use of the bomb but insists that such motivations were of decidedly secondary importance.\\" =Three Mile Island= He also authored a comprehensive review of the Three Mile Island accident, Three Mile Island: A Nuclear Crisis in Historical Perspective (2004). According to his own account, Walker's work debunked the \\"grievous misconstructions [which] were portrayals of the bubble issue that were central features of at least two books that came out shortly after the accident (in 1982) and in three television programs...\\" Walker disputed the alleged imminence of an explosion; a central point of his argument was that if the situation was as dangerous as previous writers contended, that Jimmy Carter would not have been permitted to visit the TMI power plant. = The Road to Yucca Mountain = The Road to Yucca Mountain: The Development of Radioactive Waste Policy in the United States, University of California Press, 2009, Hardcover, 240 pages, In The Road to Yucca Mountain, Walker covers the U.S. government's controversial attempts to address the engineering and social issues associated with high-level radioactive waste repository (HLRWR) management and spent reactor fuel (SRF). He starts with the Manhattan Project and works through the policy debate. In 1987, Yucca Mountain, Nevada emerged as the most likely candidate for a repository. He explicates the United States Atomic Energy Commission's flop with its first attempt to build a HLRWR in a Kansas salt mine. He addresses deep geological disposal and surface storage of HLRW and SRF as well as fuel reprocessing. The Organization of American Historians awarded the book the 2010 Richard W.

The second christian name \\"Johann\\" mentioned by Link (2006, 132) is possibly a confusion with composer Wenzel Johann Trnka (born 1782; died after 1849) (Czech: V√°clav Trnka z K≈ôovic;Record at Library of Congress authority file 1739‚Äì1791) was a physician, professor, and amateur composer of the 18th century. Life He was born 16 October 1739 in T√°bor in Bohemia. In 1769, during his medical studies, the famous physician Gerard van Swieten named him to serve as his assistant in the military hospital (Milit√§rkrankenhaus).De Luca (1778:228) He received his doctorate 19 February 1770 with a treatise entitled \\"De morbo coxario\\"; (\\"On disease of the hip\\"). In June of the same year he was appointed to a professorial chair in anatomy at the University of Nagyszombat. Trnka thus became one of five who first formed the medical faculty there. He continued his service when the university was moved, first to Buda in 1777 and later to Pest, in 1784. He switched academic chairs twice, becoming the professor of general pathology in 1781 and of special pathology in 1786. 19th- century sources describe Trnka's medical career as a distinguished one; for instance lists him among the eminent physicians of the \\"older Vienna School\\". He was a prolific author. Trnka composed music, but apparently composition was only a hobby for him, and he was not judged sufficiently important as a composer to merit an article in the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. According to Link, Trnka was a friend of the famous musical patron and organizer Gottfried van Swieten, son of Gerhard.Link (2006:132) He died in Pest on 12 May 1791.Hecker (1839:552) The Mozart misattribution Trnka emerged into public view in 1988 when it was revealed by Wolfgang Plath that he was the composer of two minor works previously attributed to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Trnka's compositional specialization appears to have been canons, a form of music at the time often sung recreationally among friends. According to Link, at least 61 canons by Trnka survive, and all but one are to lyrics by the famous librettist Metastasio. Mozart enjoyed singing canons with his friends (see \\"Difficile lectu\\"), and particularly liked canons with humorous scatological lyrics, of which he composed several himself (see Mozart and scatology). In the present case, Mozart evidently took two canons by Trnka and gave them new lyrics, which he probably wrote himself. Trnka's \\"Tu sei gelosa, √® vero\\" became Mozart's \\"Leck mir den Arsch fein recht sch√∂n sauber\\" (\\"Lick me in the ass right well and clean\\"), and Trnka's \\"So che vanti un cor ingrato\\" became Mozart's \\"Bei der Hitz im Sommer e√ü ich\\" (\\"In the heat of summer I eat\\"Ochs (1991) translates the first verse of Mozart's words thus: \\"In the heat of summer I like eating beetroot and kraut, also butter and radish, making splendid wind that cools me right off.\\"). These works were mistaken as Mozart's compositions when his widow Constanze sent them as part of a bundle of canons in 1800 to the publisher Breitkopf & H√§rtel, who four years later duly published them as Mozart's work.Zaslaw (2006:113) They entered the standard K√∂chel catalogue as K. 233 and K. 234 (K6 382e). The musicologist Albert Dunning anticipated Plath's findings: in his prefatory remarks to the 1974 Neue Mozart-Ausgabe edition of the canons he suggested (based on stylistic grounds and the lack of primary sources) that the two canons (and one other) were not by Mozart.Link (2006,133) Works (partial) *(1775) Historia febrium intermittentium, omnis aevi observata et inventa illustriora medica ad has febres pertinentia complectens [on malaria].

It is a large round fruit (typically 300-500 g), it has a small hard seed inside and is very juicy and fragrant. It is generally considered to be one of the best mangoes. Its production area is centred on the districts of Salem, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri in Tamil Nadu,gujrat, as well as neighbouring parts of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. A variety that was transplanted in Florida is called MulgobaLatin American Mango \\"Haden is considered to be the ancestor of several varieties, such as Kent, Tommy Atkins, Palmer, Edward, Van Dyke and others. The original tree stands in Coconut Grove, Florida where Captain Haden planted Indian Mulgoba mango seedlings in 1901.\\" (very likely due to a mislabeling). A strain is also grown in Malaysia.Richard E. Litz (ed), Mango: Botany, Production and Uses, CABI, 2009, p.10 The US variety is somewhat smaller, and may even be a different strain. A DNA analysis of 50 varieties of mango obtained several DNA clusters but found the Malgova to be the most distinct.  Description  The Malgova is a round mango which retains a green colour (with hints of red) when ripe. It is roundish-oblique, p.288 in shape, with a blunt apex and has a smaller lateral beak than other mangoes. For the size of fruit, the stone is small. The Florida variety is more yellowish with some crimson blush. The fiber-less flesh is yellow, soft, and has a flavor that is rich, spicy, and sweet. It contains a monoembryonic seed. It is a late- ripening mango, harvested typically around May (July/August in Florida). It has low acidity (0.11) with a pH of 4.65. The trees are vigorous growers and will grow to large sizes with spreading, open canopies. History in the United States Display of unripe Florida 'Mulgoba' mango at the 15th Annual International Mango Festival at the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in Coral Gables, Florida. There is considerable speculation as to the origin of the American 'Mulgoba' variety. What is known is that 'Mulgoba' was sent from India to the US in 1889 as part of a program to introduce tropical fruit to America. Twelve grafted mango trees were shipped by G. Marshall Woodrow, who was then Professor of Horticulture at the Agricultural College in Poona, India.http://www.fshs.org/Proceedings/Password%20Protected/1960%20Vol.%2073/309-311%20%28WOLFE%291.pdf The trees were brought from Bombay to Washington D.C., where they arrived in poor condition. The varieties included 'Alphonse', 'Banchore', 'Banchore of Dhiren', 'Devarubria', 'Mulgoba', and 'Pirie'. Upon receipt of the trees, they were then shipped to south Florida to be cared for by horticulturists. 5 of the trees were sent to Professor Elbridge Gale along Lake Worth Lagoon near what is now West Palm Beach, Florida. Gale was a retired horticulture professor from Kansas State Agricultural College. One of these trees were labeled \\"Mulgoba\\" by Woodrow, which most likely was a mislabelling of Malgova, a well known mango cultivar in India. 10 of the 12 trees were killed by 1895, most presumably in a major freeze that affected Florida in the winter of 1894-1895. In 1898, Gale reported that only an 'Alphonse' tree under the care of the Brelsford Brothers and the 'Mulgoba' under his care were the two surviving trees. The 'Alphonse' was said to be doing poorly, but the same year the 'Mulgoba' produced its first fruit. However, the fruit resembled nothing like the 'Mulgoba' variety in India, nor any other established Indian varieties for that matter. Thus, several possibilities exist that could help explain the origin of the 'Mulgoba'. One is that the variety shipped to the United States was not 'Mulgoa' but rather another unknown variety. This explanation is challenging however as the 'Mulgoba' does not fit the description of any of the known mango varieties 'Alphonso', 'Mulgoba' grown around south Gujarat & Bombay, from where the scions for the original grafts were obtained. Yet another possibility is that the scion for the grafted tree that fruited in 1898 was killed in the 1894-1895 freeze, and that the rootstock was what grew and produced the fruit. This would help explain why the tree did not produce fruit until 1898, as most grafted trees will produce within 5 years. This would mean that 'Mulgoba' originated as a chance seedling of a superior variety, though such varieties were rarely used as rootstocks for grafted trees in India, complicating this explanation. After the original tree began producing fruit, the 'Mulgoba' was quickly recognized for its outstanding eating quality and eye-catching color. Because of this, 'Mulgoba' was propagated and other trees were planted in Florida. 'Mulgoba' was a parent of the Haden mango, which was planted from a 'Mulgoba seed and was the result of a cross between the 'Mulgoba' and 'Turpentine 10' mango. 'Haden' would go on to become the parent of many of the Florida mangoes, and thus most Florida mangoes are descended from 'Mulgoba'. 'Mulgoba' was also reportedly a parent of the 'Lancetilla' mango, as well as the 'Keitt' mango, though a 2005 pedigree analysis indicated that 'Keitt' wasn't descended from 'Mulgoba'. 'Mulgoba' itself, while highly regarded for its flavor, proved to be a very poor and inconsistent producer in Florida, thus limiting its plantings after the development of 'Haden' and other culivars with superior production characteristics. 'Mulgoba' never became an established commercial cultivar and has not been sold as nursery stock for decades. However, 'Mulgoba' trees are still part of the collections of the USDA's germplasm repository in Miami, Florida,http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/acc/display.pl?1138455 USDA, ARS, National Genetic Resources Program.

George Edmundson of Redcar and St Leonards-on- Sea, by his marriage to Elizabeth Anne, daughter of William Whytehead of Thirsk. His father was lord of the manor of Agglethorpe in Coverdale. He was educated at St Peter's School, York, and at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was a demy. He took a first class in Mathematical Moderations in 1869 and another first in Maths in 1870, graduated BA in 1871, won the Senior Hall Greek Testament Prize in 1873, and proceeded MA in 1874.EDMUNDSON, Rev.

He was ordained a deacon of the Church of England in 1872 and a priest in 1874. From 1875 to 1881 he was Junior Bursar of his college and in the University was Mathematical Examiner for Final Honour Schools for 1875‚Äì76.John Arthur Thomas Robinson, Redating the New Testament (Westminster Press, 1976), p. 349 In 1880, Edmundson accepted the benefice of Northolt, Middlesex, where he remained until 1906, when he became Vicar of St Saviour's, Upper Chelsea, retiring in 1920. He was also Rural Dean of Chelsea from 1916 to 1920. From 1896 to 1899, Edmundson worked for the British Government in the matter of a Boundary Arbitration between British Guiana and Venezuela, and from 1901 to 1904 he worked for the government again on a Boundary Arbitration between British Guiana and Brazil. His work was research, under the direction of Sir Charles Alexander Harris, who later wrote \\"To the staff who worked under my direction in the two Guiana arbitration cases, where extreme accuracy and patience were required, I find it difficult to record my indebtedness.

Much later, J. A. T. Robinson praised it highly. In his Redating the New Testament (1977), he noted that Edmundson's book had largely been ignored at the time, perhaps because he was not a professional New Testament scholar and his conclusions were radically different from the consensus of the \\"higher criticism\\" of his day.Biography of George Edmundson at ccel.org, accessed 21 December 2010 In 1917‚Äì18, Edmundson worked for the Foreign Office's Historical Department.

Studying architecture at Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia and sculpture at the Royal Academy of Fine Art. With national and regional Italian he also studied in Milan and Paris before moving to New York City in 1883. Working as an architectural sculptor at McKim, Mead, and White he married his wife, Dora Ballin, in 1889. After getting married, the couple and their four sons moved to Washington, D.C. where he founded the School of Architecture and Fine Arts at what became George Washington University. He served as chairman from 1892-1902. He died March 18, 1913 of apoplexy. His son, Edmond, went on to be a prominent sculptor as well. Amateis has designed work for the United States Capitol and busts of Chester A. Arthur, General Winfield Scott Hancock, General John Logan, Andrew Carnegie among others. Acquisition The Heurich family mausoleum was originally located at their family dairy farm in Prince George's County, Maryland. The farm was located in Hyattsville, in a large part of the southern portion of the tract of land contained within Queen's Chapel Road, Ager Road, University Boulevard, and Adelphi Road. The Prince George's Plaza shopping mall, (now known as the Mall at Prince Georges), was built on the site of the home and dairy barn. The mausoleum was moved to Rock Creek Cemetery in 1951 after Mrs. Heurich (Christian Heurich's third wife) sold the farm. Information The Heurich Mansion This mausoleum serves as the final resting place to members of the Heurich family. Christian Heurich (1842‚Äì1945) immigrated from Germany to the United States in 1866. In 1872 he founded Christian Heurich Brewing Company in Washington, which was first located in Dupont Circle, then relocated to a much larger site in 1895 between what is now the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge and the Kennedy Center. The brewery closed in 1956 and was torn down in 1961. The Heurichs lived in Dupont Circle in what is known as the Brewmaster's Castle. The stained glass located on the back wall was designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany. Condition This sculpture was surveyed in 1993 for its condition and it was described as needing treatment.

It is a literal translation of the Chinese pejorative Ëµ∞Áãó (), meaning a yes-man or lackey, and is derived from the tendency of dogs to follow after humans in hopes of receiving food scraps. Historian Yuan-tsung Chen notes that \\"In the West, a dog is a man's best friend; but in China, dogs are abject creatures. In Chinese, no idiomatic expression was more demeaning than the term 'running dogs.'\\" The term \\"imperialist running dog\\" (diguozhuyi de zougou) is used by Mao Zedong to refer to allies of counterrevolutionary imperial forces.Selected Works of Mao Tse-Tung, Volume 4, p. 455. Historian Chang-tai Hung suggests the term was used to invoke negative mental imagery; \\"The image of...a running dog parallels that of the United States as a wolf. Both bestial representations provide convenient and familiar symbols that political artists can target, but they also validate the use of violence since the annihilation of beasts is justified. ...[The representations of enemies as beasts such as running dogs or rats] call to mind repulsive creatures that inflict damage on the nation.\\" In 1950 an article in The China Weekly Review gave the definition \\"A running- dog is a lackey, one who aids and accompanies in the hope of being treated kindly and perhaps being allowed to share in the spoils.\\" In 1953 a Saturday Evening Post article offered a definition for tso kou (\\"running dog\\") and kou t'ui tee (\\"dog's hips\\"), saying \\"A 'running dog' was a person who follows obediently after the person whose dog he is, a fellow traveler; a 'dog's hips' was simply an enthusiastic running dog, who exercises his hips while running errands for his master.\\" Historian James Reeve Pusey captures some of the power of the idiom when telling of Lu Xun's reaction to seeing people in power mistreat others with the idiom \\"the weak are the meat of the strong\\". Lu's anger spilt over to the point of having a reaction even against those calling for resistance without vengeance \\"For the loudest of such people, he thought, were running dogs of the people-eaters, fed at least on scraps of human flesh.\\" The phrase running dog has been in use since the Qing Dynasty, and was often used in the 20th century by communists to refer to client states of the United States and other capitalist powers.

Life Boys was born at Pentonville, London, on 2 January 1803. He was articled to the engraver George Cooke. When his apprenticeship came to an end he went to Paris where he met and came under the influence of Richard Parkes Bonington, who persuaded him to abandon engraving for painting. Some sources describe him as a pupil of Bonington, although William Callow, who later shared a studio with him in Paris, disputed this. He exhibited at the Royal Academy for the first time in 1824, and in Paris in 1827. In 1830 he went to Brussels, but returned to England on the outbreak of the revolution there. Paying another visit to Paris, he remained there until 1837, and then returned to England in order to lithograph the works of David Roberts and Clarkson Stanfield. His most important work, Picturesque Architecture in Paris, Ghent, Antwerp, Rouen, etc., a collection of colour lithographs, appeared in 1839, attracting a great deal of admiration. Drawn on the stone by Boys and printed by Charles Joseph Hullmandel, it was described in a review in the Polytechnic Journal as \\"the first successful effort in chroma-lithography hitherto brought to perfection\\". King Louis-Philippe sent the artist a ring in recognition of its merits. He also published Original Views of London as it is, drawn and lithographed by himself, (London, 1843). He drew the illustrations to Blackie's History of England, and etched some plates for John Ruskin's Stones of Venice. Boys was a member of the Institute of Painters in Water Colours, and of several foreign artistic societies. He died in 1874.

Pulong Balibaguhan, Mabini, the news Barangay Hall. History When Mabini was made a separate and distinct municipality in 1918, (Bauan - mother town) P. Balibaguhan was one of the twelve barrios that then comprised the town. Before 1918, P. Balibaguhan was a barrio of the Municipality of Bauan. The barrio was then inhabited by around fifty people. It is bounded on the north by P. Nioagan and Mainaga, on the east by Batangas Bay, on the south by Talaga and on the west by P. Anahao. The Aplaya people of Bauan called the place (Balibaguhan) Hanaw-Hanaw, but its name as a political subdivision of Bauan was P. Balibaguhan. Legend tells that it was so-called because constables while making surveys in the place found plenty of plants they called \\"balibago.\\" Since then, the place was called Pulo ng Balibago. The political setup and processes in the barrio before the effectivity of the Revised Administrative Code and Local Autonomy Act, and recently, the Bario Charter, were quite different. Its ruler was appointed by provincial leaders. Teniente del Barrio was the name given to a barrio executive. There were approximately five barrio executives who were not elected by the people. They were: Cornelio Maramot, Sergio Albania, Valentin Maramot, Mauricio Reyes and Juan Maramot. The first elected teniente del barrio was Elino del Mundo. Next to him were Gerardo Albania, Zoilo Basit, Mauro Maramot, Julian Manalo, Sabino Manalo and Tirso Maramot. The present barrio captain is Angel Albania. From the original territorial jurisdiction of the Barrio Balibaguhan, several barrios have been formed - Bulacan, a part of Poblacion, a part of Sampaguita, Sta. Mesa and a part of Talaga. Before the first world war the chief agricultural products were rice, corn and oranges - the only source of villagers' livelihood. Transport was difficult. Two or three of the people in this place were able to study in Bauan and Batangas. Before the second world war, there were some notable changes. Many began to go to neighbouring towns and provinces in search of a living. Some were merchants, a few were soldiers and several were roving businessmen. Agriculture was gradually forgotten; fruit trees were neglected. Several young people became educationally and politically conscious. The people of this barangay are predominantly Catholic. About 97% are literate. The per capita of the people is P 270.00.

Although not a reactionary, he was very keen on good form and correct dress and was critical of the behaviour of the growing number of members of the college who failed to respect them. As Junior Tutor he invited all sorts to dinner, as he felt he should do, but after one such occasion said to Arthur Benson \\"Thank God my bounders' dinner is over!\\"Michael Cox, M. R.

It is located on Storrs Road (Connecticut Route 195) near the southeast corner of the junction with Dodd Road. Completed in 1710, it was the home of the town's first minister, and has a well-preserved chronology of alteration, illustrating changing building practices over the course of the 18th century. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, and is included within the Mansfield Center Historic District. Description and history The Eleazer Williams House is located in the village of Mansfield Center, on the east side of Storrs Road south of its junction with Dodd Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The clapboards probably date to the late 18th century, and are fastened to the framing with hand-cut nails. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance sheltered by a multi-columned Colonial revival portico. Construction on the house was begun in 1709 by Samuel Fuller, but was completed in 1710 by the town, which purchased the unfinished structure from Fuller in 1710. It was built for the Reverend Eleazer Williams, son of the Deerfield, Massachusetts minister John Williams, and served as the town parsonage for 75 years. The house underwent significant remodeling between 1750 and 1775, giving it a more Georgian appearance with a saltbox shape. Around 1800 the house was again altered, raising the roof in the rear to a full two stories, and in 1853 the c. 1760 chimneys were removed. The house is considered an excellent showpiece of the evolutionary alteration of a colonial-era house over time. and See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Tolland County, Connecticut References Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Mansfield, Connecticut Houses in Tolland County, Connecticut National Register of Historic Places in Tolland County, Connecticut Historic district contributing properties in Connecticut ","title":"Eleazer Williams House"},{"id":"30151317","text":"\\"Don't Start Me Talkin'\\" (also called \\"Don't Start Me to Talkin'\\") is a blues song written and performed by Sonny Boy Williamson II.

The river is long and drains an isolated area of the Canadian Rockies east of the village of Canal Flats. It rises at Sylvan Pass, in a precipitous glacial basin in Height of the Rockies Provincial Park. It flows southwards through a deep valley along the Park Ranges, then swings southwest to receive the North Fork from the right. The river then makes a broad northwestward curve around the south flank of Flett Peak, passing Whiteswan Lake Provincial Park. It then flows generally north- northwest, emptying into the Kootenay on the left bank. The White is a large, steep, fast flowing glacial river and can be up to wide as it nears the mouth.

Life His father was Rear-admiral Thomas Boys of Kent. He was born at Sandwich, Kent, and educated at Tonbridge Grammar School and Trinity College, Cambridge. The failure of his health from over-study prevented his taking more than the ordinary degrees (B.A. 1813, M.A. 1817), and, finding an active life necessary to him, he entered the army with a view to becoming a military chaplain, was attached to the military chest in the Peninsula under Wellington in 1813, and was wounded at the battle of Toulouse in three places, gaining the Peninsular Medal. He was ordained deacon in 1816, and priest in 1822. He established a reputation as a Hebrew scholar, being teacher of Hebrew to Jews at the college, Hackney, from 1830 to 1832, and professor of Hebrew at the Missionary College, Islington, in 1836. While holding this last post, he revised Deodati's Italian Bible, and also the Arabic Bible. Boys also made a translation of the Bible into Portuguese. He began by making a critical revision of Jo√£o Ferreira de Almeida's version: according to The Bible of every Land, published by Samuel Bagster in 1848, Boys \\"appears to have completed the revision of the New Testament, and to have published small editions of the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, and of the Psalms\\". Then, in 1837, the Trinitarian Bible Society decided to publish a new Portuguese translation from the Greek and Hebrew texts, and appointed Boys to carry out the work. He was instructed to use Almeida's version as a basis, but carry out a careful comparison with the Hebrew, and to make his version comprehensible to contemporary readers. The New Testament was published in 1843, and the Old Testament in 1847. In 1848 he was appointed incumbent of Holy Trinity, Hoxton. He died 2 September 1880, aged 88. Other writings Boys was a prolific writer. In 1825 he published a key to the Psalms, and in 1827 a Plain Exposition of the New Testament. Already in 1821 he had issued a volume of sermons, and in 1824 a book entitled Tactica Sacra, expounding a theory that in the arrangement of the New Testament writings a parallelism could be detected similar to that used in the writings of the Jewish prophets. In 1832 he published The Suppressed Evidence, or Proofs of the Miraculous Faith and Experience of the Church of Christ in all ages, from authentic records of the Fathers, Waldenses, Hussites.., . The same year produced a plea for verbal inspiration under the title A Word for the Bible, and 1834 A Help to Hebrew. He was a frequent contributor of sketches and papers to Blackwood's Magazine, mostly descriptive of his experiences during the Peninsular War. The most important of these was \\"My Peninsular Medal\\", which ran from November 1849 to July 1850. His acquaintance with the literature and antiquities of the Jews was very thorough, but perhaps the best proofs of his extensive learning are to be found in the numerous letters and papers, sometimes under his own name, and sometimes under the assumed name of \\"Vedette\\", contributed to the second series of Notes and Queries. Of these the twelve papers on Chaucer difficulties are a most valuable contribution to the study of early English literature.

It focuses on four teenagers whose lives intersect following a hit-and- run car crash. The book is told from the alternating perspectives of the four teens.  Plot  Laurie Stark is very excited when popular, athletic Quentin Palmer (Quin for short) asks her out on a date. While they are on their date, Analise Bower is babysitting. After her job has ended, she doesn't feel like asking for a ride. She says knows the roads and feels safer on her bike. While riding back home in Quin's mother's SUV, Laurie falls asleep and is awakened by a crash. Quin assures her that it was only a deer he mistakenly hit, though he isn't so sure himself. After seeing that the crash had damaged some property, Quin covers the scene and drives away. Sometime after the accident, Analise's talented boyfriend Jeremy receives a call from her parents concerning Analise's location. For a few days, Jeremy and Mr. and Mrs. Bower try to locate Analise. They are unsuccessful and hand the case over to the police. One morning, the police announce that they found Analise injured. Because of the attempt to cover the accident, the case is therefore called a hit and run. In the hospital, the doctors say that Analise has gone in coma because of a serious head injury. Meanwhile, at school, when the principal announces Analise's accident, Laurie is very shocked to hear that the accident's location is somewhat near the place Quin mistakenly hit a \\"deer\\". Her friend Judie, suggests that she use the information for her own benefit by blackmailing Quin to become her boyfriend. Laurie hesitates but does what Judie says to. Afraid that the incident might ruin his future as an athlete, Quin accepts and pretends to be Laurie's boyfriend. A few days later, Jeremy receives a call from Mrs. Bower informing him that Analise had died. Guilty of her actions, Laurie emails Analise's friend Amy the evidence that is needed to prove that the SUV Quin was driving was the one which hit Analise. In Analise's point of view, she floats out of her body and outside the building. She passes a boy crying in his room and a girl sitting at her computer, not recognizing either, on her way to the light (To show that she is crossing over). At the end of the book, Jeremy is the one who creates Analise's coffin with his beautiful wood carving skills. Action is taken against Mr. Palmer and his son.

Guaitecas Archipelago Some of the potatoes of Chilo√© also grow in the wild in Guaitecas Archipelago, although there is some uncertainty as to when and how potatoes arrived there. The Guaitecas Archipelago formed the southern limit of Pre-Hispanic agriculture as noted by the mention of the cultivation of potatoes by a Spanish expedition in 1557. Later during the second voyage of HMS Beagle, Charles Darwin collected potatoes from Guaitecas. Potatoes grow beside the sea in a herbaceous zone. The wild potatoes that grow in the archipelago are mostly found in its western part. Apparently these potatoes do not reproduce by seeds and rarely produce flowers and fruits. Potatoes grow in zones of disturbance, mainly in the herbaceous zone near the coast that is affected by winter storms.

These are frequently used in mathematics (particularly harmonic analysis) as a way of discretizing objects in order to make computations or analysis easier. For example, to study an arbitrary subset of A of Euclidean space, one may instead replace it by a union of dyadic cubes of a particular size that cover the set. One can consider this set as a pixelized version of the original set, and as smaller cubes are used one gets a clearer image of the set A. Most notable appearances of dyadic cubes include the Whitney extension theorem and the Calder√≥n‚ÄìZygmund lemma. Dyadic cubes in Euclidean space In Euclidean space, dyadic cubes may be constructed as follows: for each integer k let Œîk be the set of cubes in Rn of sidelength 2‚àík and corners in the set :2^{-k}mathbf{Z}^n= left {2^{-k}(v_1,dots,v_n):v_j in mathbf{Z} right } and let Œî be the union of all the Œîk. The most important features of these cubes are the following: # For each integer k, Œîk partitions Rn. # All cubes in Œîk have the same sidelength, namely 2‚àík. # If the interiors of two cubes Q and R in Œî have nonempty intersection, then either Q is contained in R or R is contained in Q. # Each Q in Œîk may be written as a union of 2n cubes in Œîk+1 with disjoint interiors. We use the word \\"partition\\" somewhat loosely: for although their union is all of Rn, the cubes in Œîk can overlap at their boundaries. These overlaps, however, have zero Lebesgue measure, and so in most applications this slightly weaker form of partition is no hindrance. It may also seem odd that larger k corresponds to smaller cubes. One can think of k as the degree of magnification. In practice, however, letting Œîk be the set of cubes of sidelength 2k or 2‚àík is a matter of preference or convenience. The one-third trick One disadvantage to dyadic cubes in Euclidean space is that they rely too much on the specific position of the cubes. For example, for the dyadic cubes Œî described above, it is not possible to contain an arbitrary ball inside some Q in Œî (consider, for example, the unit ball centered at zero). Alternatively, there may be such a cube that contains the ball, but the sizes of the ball and cube are very different. Because of this caveat, it is sometimes useful to work with two or more collections of dyadic cubes simultaneously. =Definition= The following is known as the one-third trick: Let Œîk be the dyadic cubes of scale k as above. Define : Delta_k^alpha = {Q+alpha: Qin Delta_k }. This is the set of dyadic cubes in Œîk translated by the vector Œ±. For each such Œ±, let ŒîŒ± be the union of the ŒîkŒ± over k. * There is a universal constant C > 0 such that for any ball B with radius r < 1/3, there is Œ± in {0,1/3}n and a cube Q in ŒîŒ± containing B whose diameter is no more than Cr. * More generally, if B is a ball with any radius r > 0, there is Œ± in {0, 1/3, 4/3, 42/3, ...}n and a cube Q in ŒîŒ± containing B whose diameter is no more than Cr. =An example application= The appeal of the one-third trick is that one can first prove dyadic versions of a theorem and then deduce \\"non-dyadic\\" theorems from those. For example, recall the Hardy-Littlewood Maximal function : Mf(x)=sup_{r>0}frac{1}{B(x,r)}int_{B(x,r)}f(y)dy where f is a locally integrable function and B(x, r) denotes the measure of the ball B(x, r). The Hardy‚ÄìLittlewood maximal inequality states that for an integrable function f, : left {xinmathbf{R}^{n}:Mf(x)>lambda} right  leq frac{C_n}{lambda}f_{1} for Œª > 0 where Cn is some constant depending only on dimension. This theorem is typically proven using the Vitali Covering Lemma. However, one can avoid using this lemma by proving the above inequality first for the dyadic maximal functions : M_{Delta^{alpha}}f(x)=sup_{xin Qin Delta^{alpha}}frac{1}{Q}int_{Q}f(x)dx. The proof is similar to the proof of the original theorem, however the properties of the dyadic cubes rid us of the need to use the Vitali covering lemma. We may then deduce the original inequality by using the one-third trick. Dyadic cubes in metric spaces Analogues of dyadic cubes may be constructed in some metric spaces. In particular, let X be a metric space with metric d that supports a doubling measure ¬µ, that is, a measure such that for x ‚àà X and r > 0, one has: : mu(B(x,2r))leq Cmu(B(x,r)) where C > 0 is a universal constant independent of the choice of x and r. If X supports such a measure, then there exist collections of sets Œîk such that they (and their union Œî) satisfy the following: * For each integer k, Œîk partitions X, in the sense that :: mu left (Xbackslash bigcup olimits_{Qin Delta_{k}}Q right )=0. * All sets Q in Œîk have roughly the same size. More specifically, each such Q has a center zQ such that :: B(z_{Q},c_{1}delta^{k})subseteq Qsubseteq B(z_{Q},c_{2}delta^{k}) :where c1, c2, and Œ¥ are positive constants depending only on the doubling constant C of the measure ¬µ and independent of Q. * Each Q in Œîk is contained in a unique set R in Œîk‚àí1. * There are constants constant C3, Œ∑ > 0 depending only on ¬µ such that for all k and t > 0, :: mu left ( left {xin Q: d(x, Xbackslash Q)leq tdelta^k right } right ) leq C_3 t^eta mu(Q). These conditions are very similar to the properties for the usual Euclidean cubes described earlier. The last condition says that the area near the boundary of a \\"cube\\" Q in Œî is small, which is a property taken for granted in the Euclidean case although is very important for extending results from harmonic analysis to the metric space setting.

Although born in the United States, Murray lived most of his life in the United Kingdom, most notably in St Andrews, Scotland. He wrote two books of poetry and was published occasionally in periodicals. Murray was born 26 December 1863 in Roxbury, Massachusetts, son of Emmeline and John Murray, the latter a Scotsman and a Unitarian minister. In 1869 his father took him to Kelso and from that point on, except for a brief visit to Egypt, he stayed in the U.K. He attended grammar school in Ilminster and Crewkerne and in 1881 he entered the University of St Andrews. In 1886 his father died. He worked for a while assisting John M. D. Meiklejohn, Professor of the Theory, History, and Practice of Education at the University of St Andrews, and contributed some poems to the school newspaper. In 1889 he left St Andrews and worked in Edinburgh at low-level journalism, including a period of employment at the Scottish Leader. He began to have frequent bouts of colds. In 1890 he returned to St Andrews, where he contributed occasionally to Longman's Magazine. At this point it became clear he had the beginnings of \\"consumption\\" (likely tuberculosis). In 1891 he went to Egypt, but his stay was short as disliked it. He again returned to St Andrews, and his first book, The Scarlet Gown, was published. His second book, Robert F.

The volume includes a lengthy biographical introduction by Andrew Lang. In attempting to place Murray in the context of his contemporaries, Lang said: :... the Victorian age produced Scottish practitioners of the art of light verse who are not remembered as they deserve to be. Lord Neaves, perhaps, is no more than a ready and rollicking versifier, but George Outram is an accomplished wit, and Robert Fuller Murray a disciple of Calverley who might well have rivalled his master had death not taken him while still in his pupilage.

It was the first science fiction series ever translated into Hebrew and had considerable impact on the development of this genre in Israel.Review on the website of the Israeli Science Fiction and Fantasy Association Plot summary The plot follows on precisely from The Lost Planet. A previous expedition to Hesikos, the wandering 'lost planet' which is now within a few days flight of Earth, has crash-landed, and Dr Lachlan McKinnon (its organiser), Professor Hermanoff and American engineer Spike Stranahan are marooned. McKinnon's colleagues must build and launch a spaceship from their Scottish base to travel to Hesikos, but to construct the ship they must obtain the expert assistance of Dr Andrieff, a scientist and engineer, who risks exile from his Eastern European country by so doing. The crew, consisting of McKinnon's nephew Jeremy Grant, Professor Lars Bergman, science student Janet Campbell and Cockney housekeeper Madge, rescue the three explorers, who have survived the harsh winter, and start to explore the planet in a Jeep. They find signs that Hesikos was once inhabited, and that atomic bombs were detonated long ago on the surface. Escaping from a deluge of water, which damages their Jeep, as a river suddenly rises, they take refuge in a cave, which leads to a door. The door opens to admit them to caverns where the inhabitants of the planet now live. The people are highly intelligent and human-like, communicating with the visitors by telepathy, which is facilitated by a machine called the Electronome. They explain that since their planet's orbit was destroyed eons ago by atomic experiments, they have lived a peaceful underground existence, only emerging in the mild summer season to gather fruits and plants. Their current leader is Solveg, with his daughter Asa. Power for the colony is supplied by hydroelectric generators, but when a rockfall blocks the underground river, all power is lost. The inhabitants have a fatalistic philosophy that allows them to face inevitable destruction stoically, but McKinnon cannot accept this. Grant and Stranahan use the explosives they have saved from the flood to clear the blockage ‚Äî and Hesikos is saved. The visitors' then return to their spaceship in the Jeep which the Hesikans have repaired, and return to Earth accompanied by Asa, who hopes to spread her philosophy of peace.

Description Juncus digitatus is an annual herb forming small, dense clumps of thin, almost hairlike stems which are red in color much of the time and measure up to 10 centimeters tall. The leaves have blades no more than about 2 centimeters long and are mostly limited to the base of the plant. The inflorescence is a single flower or a cluster of up to 8 flowers at the tips of the stems. Each flower has six lance-shaped tepals a few millimeters in length which are reddish to greenish darkening to purplish near the tips. The fruit is a red or brownish, fingerlike capsule 1 to 2 centimeters long. ;Conservation Juncus digitatus is most closely related to Juncus triformis, which grows alongside it in one of the populations but not the other. Both populations of the plant are threatened.The Nature Conservancy Suitable habitat has been reduced by the conversion of the land to agriculture. The spring water that feeds its natural habitat has been diverted by pipeline from one population, and the other may be impacted by ornamental rock mining.

It was one of the first war memorials to be built in the United States, and is a significant work of both architect Henry Austin and builder Solomon Willard. Now owned and maintained by the state, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The Captain Nathan Hale Monument is located in South Coventry village, at the entrance to the Nathan Hale Cemetery on Lake Street. It is set off-center in a roughly rectangular grassy area slightly elevated by a granite retaining wall, part of which serves as the border wall of the cemetery and its entrance drive. The monument is in height, with a stepped square base, surmounted by a paneled section, above which is a gabled cornice, with the body of the obelisk above. The monument is constructed out of granite quarried in Quincy, Massachusetts, from the same quarries that supplied the Bunker Hill Monument. Each face of the panel section bears an inscription, one of them consisting of Hale's famous quotation \\"I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.\\" The monument's architectural style has been described as Greek Revival and Exotic Revival. A committee of the town began to consider construction of a monument to its native son in 1837. At the time, it encountered opposition to war memorials that was fairly typical in the United States at the time, including some resistance from the Hale family, who thought it unseemly. They persevered, and eventually raised private donations and state funds for the effort. The memorial was designed by Henry Austin, a prominent Connecticut architect, and was built in 1846 by Solomon Willard, owner of the Quincy granite quarries. The quarried stone was shipped to Norwich by regional railroads at no cost, and was delivered the rest of the way to Coventry by oxen. A retaining wall made of \\"massive stones five feet in length\\" was built in 1894. and The monument was one of the first large-scale monuments in the United States to commemorate an individual or event, preceding the Bunker Hill Monument (completed 1846) and the Washington Monument (completed 1885). Monuments and memorials of this type were not built in significant numbers until after the American Civil War.

It is located close to Andorra La Vella, the capital of Andorra. The lake water is deep blue and is drained by a drainage basin formed by the Pyrenees mountain ranges, which are snow-covered. The valley formed by the rivers draining the catchment provides an enchanting view with green meadows and rich forest of pine trees nearer to the lake periphery. The water source to the lake is from the East Valira and Madriu rivers. The stored water in the reservoir is utilized for generating hydroelectric power at the power station located near Encamp village. There is a cable car rope way from Encamp to the lake area, which is a line. Legend A legend related to the history and formation of the lake claims that Engolasters was formed by a sudden gush of water unleashed by divine powers in order to chastise the impiety of a beautiful woman, who was said to be an ancient inhabitant of a village close to the lake shore. According to legend, the woman refused to give a piece of a bread to a starving pilgrim, said to be Christ himself. Legend also tells that all the stars in the sky, illuminated by the beauty of lake, were destined to fall to the lake bed and stay there as prisoners for eternity. Another interesting legend narrated is of Engolasters Lake as the site of ceremonies held by witches (said to be a common belief in the Pyrenees). These ceremonies were held in the form of naked dances performed by the witches on the precincts of the lake. People were scared to watch these ceremonies as it was believed that anyone watching these performances would be turned into a dog or stone by the witches. Geography Map showing lake and Andorra la Vella location Engolasters Lake lies to the northeast of the Andorran capital of Andorra la Vella in western-central Andorra. The Valira River (Riu Valira) drains into the lake. It has two major tributaries, the North Valira and East Valira, which have created a deep incised valley. The two tributaries' confluence at Escaldes forms the Valira River. This river has provided the only access to Andorra along its course, from Spain and from France along the East Valira. The extreme temperatures recorded at the lake are and a maximum of . Encamp The nearest village to the lake is Encamp, which is approached by a dirt road. At the lower gondola station, a road leads to the \\"Cortals d'Encamp.\\" From this location a drive of about leads to a bridge and farm houses and a further drive after crossing the bridge leads to the starting point of the easy climb of , which passes through a tunnel for pedestrians and ends on the right bank of the lake. The walk along the periphery of the lake provides excellent vistas of pine forests amidst mountainous landscape. (The Cable car stopped operating in the 80's) Cable cars provide one of the means of transport in Andorra and one such cable car way operates between Encamp and Engolasters Lake. A north‚Äìsouth highway links Andorra la Vella, capital city of Andorra, with Spain and France. Encamp is from the capital city and the lake is a further by cable way. Botanical gardens covering three delimited areas representing 13 different habitats are seen along the stretch of the road that connects les Pardines with Engolasters Lake. Attractions Snow-covered mountains, a major attraction Tourism is major economic activity around the lake as can be seen from the 88 hotels located in the precincts of the lake. Engolasters Lake is used for recreation purposes. The shoreline of the lake is a popular stretch for hikers. Nearby is the Romanesque Sant Miquel d‚ÄôEngolasters hermitage which towers over the lake. The Lombard bell tower is dated to the 12th century and it contained Romanesque paintings, which now adorn the walls of the Romanesque art museum of Barcelona. Documents dated to 1162 and 1176 have revealed that at the time there was a settlement in this vicinity. Fario trout and salmon are the popular fish varieties in the lakes of Andorra and Engolasters reserve is stated to be not only a delight for mountaineers but also for trout fishing. ;Hydroelectric station In the year 1929, Andorra decided to exploit the hydropower potential of its rivers and lakes. Accordingly, Andorra‚Äôs General Council awarded the work to Forces Andorranes Societat Anonima (FASA), a private industrial development company (owned by French and Spanish groups). It was built with the storage provided by Engolasters Lake at Salt d'Escaldes. The powerhouse was set up in the Encamp valley below the lake with an installation of two units of capacity each. A rock fill dam built at the southern end of the lake has created the lake which has a depth of about . It is one of the largest water reservoirs created by the dam at the outlet of the lake. The lake waters are rich in minerals such as iron, magnesium and sulfur and some of them have medicinal value. The power station was built between 1931 and 1934. Commissioned in , the energy generated was initially exported mostly to Spain, and also in later years to France and other places. Since the project was built under a concession given to FASA as an exchange for building of roads, the country was opened up for industrial development once the roads got built. Consequently, the demand for power increased within the country, and as per reports, the energy from this power project now meets only 15% of the country‚Äôs total consumption. Radio station in the valley below the lake now abandoned Radio tower The transmission tower seen on the bank of the lake was the 1938 creation of journalist Jacques Tremoulet and radio manufacturer Leon Kierkowsky, to operate a radio station Radio Andorra from Andorra amidst controversy over transmission rights. This antenna tower was erected over pylons. Its foundation was not based on rocks but on copper-bound and earth-filled piers. The radio station from which they transmitted music programmes at 60,000 watts of power is located in the valley below the lake to reach listeners not only in Andorra but also England, Italy and France. After transmission started on , 1939, there was a series of controversies over the transmission rights accorded to the radio station. It was shut down on 1981. The transmission tower today stands unused on the lake periphery.

It was a part of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter, and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously. The battle ended in a victory for the UN after large numbers of United States Army (US) and Republic of Korea Army (ROK) troops repelled a strong Korean People's Army (KPA) attack. Holding positions north of the crucial city of Taegu, the US 1st Cavalry Division stood at the center and the ROK 1st Division held at the northwest of the Pusan Perimeter defensive line, tasked with keeping the UN headquarters secured from attacks from the KPA. On September 1, the KPA 3rd Division attacked as part of the Great Naktong Offensive. What followed was a two-week battle around Tabu-dong and Waegwan in which the KPA were able to gradually push the 1st Cavalry Division back from its lines. However, the KPA were not able to force the US and ROK troops to withdraw completely or push the UN out of Taegu. The KPA was outflanked by the Inchon landings on 15 September and on 16 September the UN forces began their breakout from the Pusan Perimeter, forcing the KPA to abandon their attacks on Tabu-dong.  Background  = Pusan Perimeter = From the outbreak of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea by the North, the KPA had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the ROK and the UN forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing. The KPA strategy was to aggressively pursue UN forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively, attacking from the front and initiating a double envelopment of both flanks of the unit, which allowed the KPA to surround and cut off the opposing force, which would then be forced to retreat in disarray, often leaving behind much of its equipment. From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August, the KPA used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south. However, when the UN forces, under the Eighth United States Army, established the Pusan Perimeter in August, the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which KPA troops could not flank, and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN forces. Map of the Pusan Perimeter Defensive line in September 1950 the Kyongju corridor is the northeasternmost sector When the KPA approached the Pusan Perimeter on August 5, they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter. Throughout August, the KPA 6th Division, and later the KPA 7th Division engaged the US 25th Infantry Division at the Battle of Masan, initially repelling a UN counteroffensive before countering with battles at Komam-ni and Battle Mountain. These attacks stalled as UN forces, well equipped and with plenty of reserves, repeatedly repelled KPA attacks. North of Masan, the KPA 4th Division and the US 24th Infantry Division sparred in the Naktong Bulge area. In the First Battle of Naktong Bulge, the KPA division was unable to hold its bridgehead across the river as large numbers of US reserve forces were brought in to repel it, and on August 19, the KPA 4th Division was forced back across the river with 50 percent casualties. In the Taegu region, five KPA divisions were repulsed by three UN divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the Battle of Taegu. Particularly heavy fighting took place at the Battle of the Bowling Alley where the KPA 13th Division was almost completely destroyed in the attack. On the east coast, three more KPA divisions were repulsed by the ROK at P'ohang-dong during the Battle of P'ohang-dong. All along the front, the KPA troops were reeling from these defeats, the first time in the war their strategies were not working. = September push = In planning its new offensive, the KPA command decided any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible due to the support of the UN naval forces. Instead, they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope of achieving success in the battle. Fed by intelligence from the Soviet Union the KPA were aware the UN forces were building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that it must conduct an offensive soon or it could not win the battle. A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN forces in that city. As part of this mission, the KPA would first cut the supply lines to Taegu. On August 20, the KPA commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units. The plan called for a simultaneous five-prong attack against the UN lines. These attacks would overwhelm the UN defenders and allow the KPA to break through the lines in at least one place to force the UN forces back. Five battle groupings were ordered. The center attack called for the KPA 3rd, 13th and 1st Divisions to break through the US 1st Cavalry Division and ROK 1st Division to Taegu.  Battle  North Korean attacks on Taegu, September 1950. While four divisions of the KPA II Corps attacked south in the P'ohang-dong, Kyongju and Yongch'on area, the remaining three divisions of the corps-the 3rd, 13th and 1st conducted their converging attack on Taegu from the north and northwest. The KPA 3rd Division was to attack in the Waegwan area northwest of Taegu, the KPA 13th Division down the mountain ridges north of Taegu along and west of the Sangju-Taegu road, and the KPA 1st Division along the high mountain ridges just east of the road. Defending Taegu, the US 1st Cavalry Division had a front of about . Division Commander Major General Hobart R. Gay outposted the main avenues of entry into his zone and kept his three regiments concentrated behind the outposts. At the southwestern end of his line Gay initially controlled the US 3rd Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division, which had been attached to the 1st Cavalry Division. On September 5 the British 27th Commonwealth Brigade, in its first commitment in the Korean War, replaced that battalion. Next in line northward, the US 5th Cavalry Regiment defended the sector along the Naktong around Waegwan and the main Seoul highway southeast from there to Taegu. Eastward, the US 7th Cavalry Regiment was responsible for the mountainous area between that highway and the hills bordering the Sangju road. The US 8th Cavalry Regiment, responsible for the latter road, was astride it and on the bordering hills. = Hill 518 = Eighth United States Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to attack north on September 1 in an effort to divert some of the KPA strength from the US 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions in the south. Gay's initial decision upon receipt of this order was to attack north up the Sangju road, but his staff and regimental commanders all joined in urging that the attack instead be against Hill 518 in the 7th Cavalry zone. Only two days before, Hill 518 had been in the ROK 1st Division zone and had been considered a KPA assembly point. The 1st Cavalry Division, accordingly, prepared for an attack in the 7th Cavalry sector and for diversionary attacks by two companies of the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, on the 7th Cavalry's right flank. This left the 8th Cavalry only one infantry company in reserve. The regiment's 1st Battalion was on the hill mass to the west of the Bowling Alley and north of Tabu-dong; its 2nd Battalion was astride the road. This planned attack against Hill 518 coincided with the defection of KPA Major Kim Song Jun of the 19th Regiment, 13th Division. He reported that a full-scale KPA attack was to begin at dusk that day. The 13th Division, he said, had just taken in 4,000 replacements, 2,000 of them without weapons, and was now back to a strength of approximately 9,000 men. Upon receiving this intelligence, Gay alerted all front-line units to be prepared for the attack. The ROK 1st Division under command of Brigadier General Paik Sun Yup also braced his men for attack. Complying with Eighth Army's order for a spoiling attack against the KPA northwest of Taegu, Gay ordered the 7th Cavalry to attack on September 2 and seize Hill 518. Hill 518, also called Suam-san, is a large mountain mass northeast of Waegwan and east of the Naktong River. It curves westward from its peak to its westernmost height, Hill 346, from which the ground drops abruptly to the Naktong River. Situated north of the lateral Waegwan-Tabu‚Äìdong road, and about midway between the two towns, it was a critical terrain feature dominating the road between the two places. After securing Hill 518, the 7th Cavalry attack was to continue on to Hill 314. Air strikes and artillery preparations were to precede the infantry attack. On the morning of September 2 the US Air Force (USAF) delivered a 37-minute strike against Hills 518 and 346. The artillery then laid down its concentrations on the hills, and after that the planes came over again with napalm, leaving the heights on fire. Just after 10:00, and immediately after the final napalm strike, the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, attacked up Hill 518. The heavy air strikes and the artillery preparations had failed to dislodge the KPA. From their positions they delivered mortar and machine gun fire on the climbing infantry, stopping the weak, advanced US force short of the crest. In the afternoon the US battalion withdrew from Hill 518 and attacked northeast against Hill 490, from which other KPA troops had fired in support of the KPA on Hill 518. The next day at 12:00, the newly arrived 3rd Battalion resumed the attack against Hill 518 from the south, as did the 1st Battalion the day before, in a column of companies that resolved itself in the end into a column of squads. Again the attack failed. Other attacks failed on September 4. A KPA forward observer captured on Hill 518 said that 1,200 KPA were dug in on the hill and that they had large numbers of mortars and ammunition to hold out. = North Korean flanking moves = While these attacks were in progress on its right, the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment, on September 4 attacked and captured Hill 303. The next day it had difficulty in holding the hill against counterattacks. By September 4 it had become clear that the KPA 3rd Division in front of the 5th and 7th Cavalry Regiments was also attacking, and despite continued air strikes, artillery preparations and infantry efforts on Hill 518, it was infiltrating large numbers of its troops to the rear of the attacking US forces. That night large KPA forces came through the gap between the 3rd Battalion on the southern slope of Hill 518 and the 2nd Battalion westward. The KPA turned west and occupied Hill 464 in force. By September 5, Hill 464 to the rear of the 7th Cavalry had more KPA on it than Hill 518 to its front. KPA cut the Waegwan to Tabu-dong road east of the regiment so that its communications with other US units now were only to the west. During the day the 7th Cavalry made a limited withdrawal on Hill 518, giving up on capturing the hill. On the division right, Tabu-dong was in KPA hands, on the left Waegwan was a no-man's land, and in the center strong KPA forces were infiltrating southward from Hill 518. The 7th Cavalry Regiment in the center could no longer use the Waegwan-Tabu-dong lateral supply road behind it, and was in danger of being surrounded. After discussing a withdrawal plan with Walker, Gay on September 5 issued an order for a general withdrawal of the 1st Cavalry Division during the night to shorten the lines and to occupy a better defensive position. The movement was to progress from right to left beginning with the 8th Cavalry Regiment, then the 7th Cavalry in the Hill 518 area, and finally the 5th Cavalry in the Waegwan area. This withdrawal caused the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, to give up a hill it had just attacked and captured near the Tabu-dong road on the approaches of the Walled City of Ka-san. In the 7th Cavalry sector the 1st, 3rd, and 2nd Battalions were to withdraw in that order, after the withdrawal of the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry, on their right. The 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry, on Hill 303 north of Waegwan was to cover the withdrawal of the 7th Cavalry and hold open the escape road. = Further US withdrawal = In his withdrawal instructions for the 7th Cavalry, Colonel Cecil Nist, the regimental commander, ordered the 2nd Battalion to disengage from the KPA to its front and attack to its rear to gain possession of Hills 464 and 380 on the new Main line of resistance to be occupied by the regiment. Efforts to gain possession of Hill 464 by other elements had failed in the past several days. Heavy rains fell during the night of September 5‚Äì6 and mud slowed all wheeled and tracked vehicles in the withdrawal. The 1st Battalion completed its withdrawal without opposition. During its night march west, the 3rd Battalion column was joined several times by groups of KPA soldiers who apparently thought it was one of their own columns moving south. They were made prisoners and taken along in the withdrawal. Nearing Waegwan at dawn, the battalion column was taken under KPA mortar and T-34 tank fire after daybreak and sustained 18 casualties. The 2nd Battalion disengaged from the KPA and began its withdrawal at 03:00, September 6. The battalion abandoned two of its own tanks, one because of mechanical failure and the other because it was stuck in the mud. The battalion moved to the rear in two main groups: G Company to attack Hill 464 and the rest of the battalion to seize Hill 380, farther south. The KPA quickly discovered that the 2nd Battalion was withdrawing and attacked it. The battalion commander, Major Omar T. Hitchner, and his operations officer, Captain James T. Milam, were killed. In the vicinity of Hills 464 and 380 the battalion discovered at daybreak that it was virtually surrounded by KPA. Nist thought that the entire battalion was lost. Moving by itself and completely cut off from all other units, G Company, numbering only about 80 men, was hardest hit. At 08:00, nearing the top of Hill 464, it surprised and killed three KPA soldiers. Soon after, KPA automatic weapons and small arms fire struck the company. All day G Company maneuvered around the hill but never gained its crest. At mid-afternoon it received radio orders to withdraw that night. The company left six dead on the hill and, carrying its wounded on improvised litters of ponchos and tree branches, it started down the shale slopes of the mountain in rain and darkness. Halfway down, friendly fire injured Captain Herman L. West, the G Company commander. The company scattered but West reassembled it. Cautioning his men to move quietly and not to fire their weapons, West led his men to the eastern base of Hill 464 where he went into a defensive position for the rest of the night. = South flank = On the division left, meanwhile, the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry, on Hill 303 came under heavy attack and the battalion commander wanted to withdraw. The regimental commander, told him he could not do so until the 7th Cavalry had cleared on its withdrawal road. This battalion suffered heavy casualties before it abandoned Hill 303 on the September 6 to the KPA. While G Company was trying to escape from Hill 464, the rest of the 2nd Battalion was cut off at the eastern base of Hill 380, to the south. Nist organized all the South Korean carriers he could find before dark and loaded them with water, food, and ammunition for the 2nd Battalion, but the carrier party was unable to find the battalion. At dawn on September 7 the men in G Company was discovered and attacked by KPA troops in nearby positions. At this time, West heard what he recognized as fire from American weapons on a knob to his west. There, G Company was reunited with its Weapons Platoon which had become separated from him during the night. The Weapons Platoon, after becoming separated from the rest of the company, encountered KPA on the trail it was following three times in the night, but in each instance neither side fired, each going on its way. At dawn, the platoon ambushed a group of KPA, killing 13 and capturing three. From the body of a KPA officer the men took a briefcase containing important documents and maps. These showed that Hill 464 was an assembly point for part of the KPA 3rd Division in its advance from Hill 518 toward Taegu. Later in the day on September 7, Captain Melbourne C. Chandler, acting commander of the 2nd Battalion, received word of G Company's location on Hill 464 from an aerial observer and sent a patrol which guided the company safely to the battalion at the eastern base of Hill 380. The battalion, meanwhile, had received radio orders to withdraw by any route as soon as possible. It moved southwest into the 5th Cavalry sector. = North Korean advance = East of the 2nd Battalion, the KPA attacked the 1st Battalion in its new position on September 7 and overran the battalion aid station, killing four and wounding seven men. That night the 1st Battalion on division orders was attached to the 5th Cavalry Regiment. The rest of the 7th Cavalry Regiment moved to a point near Taegu in division reserve. During the night of September 7‚Äì8 the 5th Cavalry Regiment on division orders withdrew still farther below Waegwan to new defensive positions astride the main Seoul- Taegu highway. The KPA 3rd Division was still moving reinforcements across the Naktong. Observers sighted barges loaded with troops and artillery pieces crossing the river north of Waegwan on the evening of the 7th. On the 8th a North Korean communiqu√© claimed the capture of Waegwan. The next day the situation grew worse for the 1st Cavalry Division. On its left flank, the KPA 3rd Division forced the 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry, to withdraw from Hill 345, east of Waegwan. The KPA pressed forward and the 5th Cavalry was immediately locked in hard, seesaw fighting on Hills 203 and 174. The 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, before it left that sector to rejoin its regiment, finally captured the latter hill after four attacks. Only with difficulty did the 5th Cavalry Regiment hold Hill 203 on September 12. Between midnight and 04:00 on September 13, the KPA attacked again and took Hill 203 from E Company, Hill 174 from L Company, and Hill 188 from B and F Companies. In an afternoon counterattack the regiment regained Hill 188 on the south side of the highway, but failed against Hills 203 and 174 on the north side. On the 14th, I Company again attacked Hill 174, which had by now changed hands seven times. In this action the company suffered 82 casualties. Even so, the company held only one side of the hill, the KPA held the other, and grenade battles between the two continued for another week. The battalions of the 5th Cavalry Regiment were so low in strength at this time that they were not considered combat effective. This seesaw battle continued in full northwest of Taegu. = North Korean withdrawal = The UN counterattack at Inchon on September 15 outflanked the KPA and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 16 Eighth Army began its Breakout from the Pusan Perimeter. On September 19 the UN discovered the KPA had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the KPA units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The KPA withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18‚Äì19. After the forces there, the remainder of the KPA withdrew rapidly to the North. UN units rapidly pursued them north, passing over the Naktong River positions, which were no longer of strategic importance.  Aftermath  The KPA 3rd Division was almost completely destroyed in the battles. The division had numbered 7,000 men at the beginning of the offensive on September 1. Only 1,000 to 1,800 men from the division were able to retreat back into North Korea by October. The majority of the division's troops had been killed, captured or deserted. All of KPA II Corps was in a similar state, and the KPA, exhausted at Pusan Perimeter and cut off after Inchon, was on the brink of defeat. By this time, the US 1st Cavalry Division suffered 770 killed, 2,613 wounded, 62 captured during its time at Pusan Perimeter. This included about 600 casualties, with around 200 killed in action it had already suffered during the Battle of Taegu the previous month. US forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the KPA from breaking the Pusan Perimeter. The division had numbered 14,703 on September 1, but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties. Sgt. John Raymond Rice, a Ho Chunk Indian awarded the Bronze Star in World War II, was killed at Tabu-dong on September 6, 1950 leading a squad of Company A, 8th Cavalry Regiment. When his remains were returned for burial in Sioux City, Iowa the public cemetery denied him a burial because of his race. President Truman personally intervened, and arranged for his burial with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. A subsequent U.S. Supreme Court case determined in 1954 that racial segregation at public cemeteries was legal.

The buildings, which include the Cherokee Building (404 Church), the Ely Building (406 Church), the Cunningham (707 Market), the Stuart (709 Market), and the Cate (713 Market), were built circa 1895--1907, and were used for both office space and residential space. Several prominent Knoxville physicians and three marble companies operated out of the buildings in this district in the early 1900s. Location The five buildings comprising the South Market Historic District stand along the southwest corner of the intersection of Market and Church, with the Cherokee and Ely buildings facing Church, and the remaining three buildings facing Market. The district's buildings are dwarfed by the 15-story General Building, which rises across the street from the Cherokee and Ely. A patio and courtyard area lies between the rear wings of the Cherokee, Ely, and Cunningham buildings, and is accessible via pedestrian alleyways on the west and south side of the Cherokee. The red brick sidewalk in front of the buildings was built in 1982 as part of citywide improvements for the 1982 World's Fair. History The block containing the South Market Historic District was part of Lot 56 on Charles McClung's original 1791 plat of Knoxville.East Tennessee Historical Society, Mary Rothrock (ed.), The French Broad-Holston Country: A History of Knox County, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1972), map between pages 32 and 33. In the city's early years, Market Street, originally known as Chestnut Street and later known as Prince Street until 1914, was one of the city's principal commercial avenues, due in large part to its access to the Prince Street Wharf at its south end along the Tennessee River.Jack Neely, Market Square: A History of the Most Democratic Place on Earth (Knoxville, Tenn.: Market Square District Association, 2009), pp. 7-8. During the 1850s, Prince Street, along with Gay Street, became one of Knoxville's first paved roads. The Cherokee Building, constructed circa 1895 By the outbreak of the Civil War, most of Knoxville's commercial activity had shifted eastward to Gay Street and northward to Market Square and the railroad tracks. South Market was primarily a residential area during this period. An 1886 map of Knoxville shows a cluster of three two-story buildings along Church where the Cherokee and Ely now stand, and a plain one-story building where the Cate now stands.Henry Wellge, Knoxville, Tenn.: County Seat of Knox County, 1886 (Milwaukee: Norris, Wellge and Company, 1886). Map. The most prominent building in the area was the sanctuary of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, which stood on the lot currently occupied by the General Building (this congregation has since moved to the Church Street United Methodist Church on Henley).Church Street's Heritage and History . Church Street United Methodist Church official website. Retrieved: 21 December 2010. During the 1890s, as Knoxville grew more congested, large single-family houses began disappearing from the downtown area. Builders preferred more compact structures that provided a mix of residential and commercial uses. Several buildings in the South Market Historic District, constructed between 1895 and 1907, reflect this transition, with first stories built for office and commercial use, and second stories for residential use. Early occupants of the South Market Historic District included several prominent Knoxville physicians, among them J. M. Kennedy, C. E. Ristine, and S. R. Miller. Three marble companies operated out of offices in the Stuart Building in the early 1900s. Multiple coal and mining companies, as well as physicians occupied the Cunningham Building the same period. Around 1910, the Knoxville Business College and School for Shorthand moved into the first floor of the Cherokee. In 1931, at least twelve companies were operating out of the Cherokee, including four real estate firms (Doll and Carringer, the Moore Land Company, O. B. Sanderson, and Edward C. Schmid), two notaries (J. M. Moulden and John L. Mynatt), an optometrist (W. A. B. Trotter), an architectural firm (Parmelee and Sons), and a launderer, the George Loo Hand Laundry.Thompson Brothers (photograph) and the Calvin M.

Buildings The following five buildings are contributing properties in the South Market Historic District: Projecting arched entrance of the Ely Building *The Cherokee Building (404 Church Avenue), a three-story brick building with Italianate elements constructed circa 1895. This building once contained entrances on the eastern half of the Church Avenue facade as well as on the Market facade, but these have since been converted into windows. Home to numerous businesses over the years, the Cherokee has since been renovated for use as urban residential lofts and also includes the law offices of David Eldridge and Tasha Blakney (Eldridge & Blakney, P.C.). *The Ely Building (406 Church Avenue), a two-story brick building with Italianate influences constructed in 1903 for use as a physicians' office. The building has a two- bay facade, with a projecting entrance with marble voussoir and Tennessee pink marble steps on the west bay and windows on the east bay. A stairway in front of the east bay descends to a gated basement entrance. *The Cunningham Building (707 Market Street), originally called the \\"Keystone Building,\\" a three-story Renaissance Revival-style brick building constructed in late 1907. The building is characterized by its marble trim, Tennessee \\"pink\\" marble voussoirs, and a segmented arched entrance. The Cunningham currently houses law offices for Market Street attorneys on the first floor. There are residential condominiums on its upper floors and on the basement level. In the early years of the 20th century the building housed physicians and multiple coal and mining companies as well as residences. In the 1950s the building housed the City Directory Company and Rotheberger Directory Company on the second floor. In the 1960s the National Outboarding Association operated out of the second floor. *The Stuart Building (709 Market Street), originally called the \\"McNutt Building,\\" a three-story Renaissance Revival-style brick building constructed in 1902. The building's design elements include limestone trim, marble steps, and a gated entrance. The Stuart currently houses the law offices of Market Street Attorneys Dan McGehee and Deno Cole (McGehee & Cole, P.C.), Cameron Bell and Matthew Tuck. *The Cate Building (713 Market Street), a three-story Renaissance Revival-style brick building constructed circa 1895. Like the Stuart, the Cate was originally known as the \\"McNutt Building.\\" This building has limestone trim, a recessed arched entrance, and Tennessee \\"pink\\" marble steps.

Their Commander-in-Chief was President Hastings Kamuzu Banda. They originally were supposed to function as a national youth service program with a development agenda. However over time, they strayed away from this agenda and became an intricate network of espionage and terror. The Young Pioneers were a major instrument for the operationalisation of Dr Banda's one- party totalitarian dictatorship and domestic terrorism. Pioneers bore arms, conducted espionage and intelligence operations, and were Banda's most trusted bodyguards around Hastings Kamuzu Banda. Both the Malawi Army and Police resented the Pioneers for usurping their roles as security agents. Early years (1964-1967) The MYP was established in 1963. Up to 1967, The Young Pioneers, The Green Shirts, were mainly concerned with rural development work and political indoctrination. MYP instructors were placed in every Secondary School where they provided basic military training to pupils. They were also responsible for identifying potential candidates who would then be dispatched to MYP bases for more training during the three-month school vacations between July and October each year. Over time this responsibility disintegrated into a 'spying' role where instructors 'informed' against fellow school teachers resulting in arrests & expulsions. They came to be viewed as advocates of rural development as far as young members of society were concerned. By 1989 there were MYP training bases in each of the 24 districts into which the country was then divided. Structured around the Kibbutz model of Israel, the instruction methodology in Training Bases sought to introduce self-sufficiency and industry through training of recruits in improved methods of agriculture & carpentry. Because of their development-oriented agenda, the MYP were initially supported by the nation, and international community, including the Israel Government that made available technical assistance in the form of Israel Army instructors. MYP graduates received scholarships from Malawi and foreign governments in Europe. Over time the MYP branched off into business, enabling MYP entrepreneurs to pursue their dreams. The Spearhead Company, an MYP business unit, was created and soon spread its influence, alongside Dr. Banda's Press Corporation Limited throughout Malawi's economy. At one time Spearhead operated their own fleet of aeroplanes, Spearhead Airlines. During the early days this enabled the MYP to discern themselves from the Youth Leaguers, The Red Shirts, arm of The Malawi Congress Party in that they kept a respectable distance from the political excesses involved. Politically, they were proponents of the 'positive side' of Kamuzuism, \\"the ideology that Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda, as Father and Founder of the Malawi nation, was the fount of all wisdom and always knew what was best for the nation\\". They were instrumental in helping Banda consolidate his power from 1964. But after 1973's Oil Crisis, as the Malawian economy went into a tailspin the MYP cadre increasing transformed into a 'militaristic' tool of oppression. Later years Once trained, MYP were deployed to different parts of the country to work on rural development schemes. The big season for them, each year, was the month of April‚Äîa time of harvest in Malawi. Each year Dr. Banda would inaugurate the 'Youth Week'. This was a 'self-help' week when initially the Young Pioneers would hold parades, demonstrate their skills in various spheres of economic activity to underscore the contribution they were making to national development as well as affirm their loyalty to Dr Banda and his government. Over time the Youth Week was extended into a month-long event and other members of the Malawian society, school children and later University students, were drafted in to 'donate' their labor and sweat in various local projects, classroom construction, footpaths and bridge repairing etc. Gradually what began as freewill transformed into coercion, in order to divert international development funds earmarked for such projects. To ensure such 'slave labor' was readily available the MYP transformed into an overzealous 'third security force' policing party meetings, markets, bus stations, Youth Week Programs and extracting 'tithes' that had to be handed to Dr Banda during his annual 'crop inspection tours' and political rallies as 'gifts from his people'. Operation Bwezani By 1992, there were an estimated 6,000 armed Young Pioneers manning the various establishments of the organization. They conducted secret surveillance whilst they worked in farms, offices and warehouses, houses, garages, shops, training bases, etc. They were more or less adequately trained militarily, heavily armed, and thoroughly indoctrinated in the fashion of Kamuzuism. In addition, they had about 45,000 supporters that were recruited and worked as domestics, students, lecturers etc... that served as informants.http://www.njas.helsinki.fi/pdf- files/vol13num2/chirambo.pdf They were dismantled violently after the 1993 elections during Operation Bwezani \\"Give Back\\" or \\"Return\\" that was conducted by the then army commander general manken chigawa. In this case they were returning arms that the Pioneers had refused to give up. At the height of the political transition to democracy in 1993, the Malawi Army disarmed the Young Pioneers raising fears that it would also intervene in the political process leading to democracy by trying to depose Banda. Operation Bwezani gave the Malawi Army the political and social power to resist Banda's regime after 30 years. This has led some scholars to suggest that the army was serving the regime of Malawi regardless of policies of the regime since they had the power to overthrow the regime and the MYP for 30 years, but only acted after political intervention mandated it.
