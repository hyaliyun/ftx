The film was directed by David Miller from a screenplay by Dalton Trumbo. It stars Kirk Douglas as cowboy Jack Burns, Gena Rowlands as his best friend's wife and Walter Matthau as a sheriff who sympathizes with Burns but must do his job and chase him down. It also featured an early score by composer Jerry Goldsmith. Douglas felt that this was his favorite film.Brian Cady \\"Lonely Are the Brave\\" (TCM article) Plot John W. \\"Jack\\" Burns (Kirk Douglas) is a veteran of the Korean War who works as a roaming ranch hand much as the cowboys of the old West did, refusing to join modern society. He rejects much of modern technology and carries no identification, such as a driver's license or draft card. He cannot even provide authorities a home address because he just sleeps wherever he finds a place. As Burns crosses a highway into a town in New Mexico, his horse Whiskey has a difficult time crossing the road, confused and scared by the traffic. They enter town to visit Jerry (Gena Rowlands). She is the wife of an old friend, Paul Bondi (Michael Kane), who has been jailed for giving aid to illegal immigrants. Jack explains his dislike for a society that restricts a man on where he can or can't go, what he can or can't do. To break Bondi out of jail, Burns decides he himself needs to get arrested. After a violent barroom fight against a one-armed man (Bill Raisch) in which he is forced to use only one arm himself, Burns is arrested. When the police decide to let him go, he deliberately punches a cop to get himself re-arrested. He is now facing a probable sentence of a year in jail, which allows him to see Bondi, with a purpose of helping him escape. The town is a sleepy border town and the cops are mostly bored, occasionally dealing with minor offenses. The Sheriff, Morey Johnson (Walter Matthau), has to compel them to pay attention to their duties at times. Joining Bondi in jail, Burns tries to persuade him to escape. He tells Bondi he couldn't spend a year locked up because he'd probably kill someone. Burns defends Bondi from the attention of sadistic Deputy Sheriff Gutierrez (George Kennedy), who picks Burns as his next target. During the night the inmates saw through one of the jail's bars using two hacksaw blades Burns hid in his boot. The deputy summons Burns in the middle of the night and beats him. Upon returning to his cell, Burns tries to persuade Bondi to join him in escaping, but Bondi, nearing the end of his sentence, and having a family and too much at stake to become a fugitive from the law, decides to remain. Burns breaks out by himself and returns to Bondi's house, where he picks up his horse and some food from Bondi's wife. After the jail break, the Sheriff learns that Burns served in the military during the Korean War, including seven months in a disciplinary training center for striking a superior officer. He also received a Purple Heart and a Distinguished Service Cross with oak leaf clusters for his valor during battle. Burns heads for the mountains on horseback with the goal of crossing the border into Mexico. The police mount an extensive search, with Sheriff Johnson and his Deputy Sheriff Harry (William Schallert) following him in a jeep. A military helicopter is brought in, and when the aircrew locates Burns, they relay his location to the sheriff. Whiskey is repeatedly spooked by the helicopter so Burns shoots the tail rotor, damaging it and causing the pilot to lose control and crash land. Deputy Gutierrez also chases Burns. He sees the horse and is preparing to shoot when Burns sneaks up, knocking him unconscious with his rifle butt. Burns leads his horse up impossibly difficult, rocky slopes to escape his pursuers, but the lawmen keep on his trail, forcing him to keep moving. Surrounded on three sides, Burns' horse refuses at first to climb a steep slope. They finally surmount the crest of the Sandia Mountains and escape into the east side of the mountains, a broad stand of heavy timber, with the lawmen shooting at him. The Sheriff acknowledges that Burns has evaded their attempts to capture him. Burns is shot through the ankle during his dash to the timber. Burns tries to cross Highway 66 in Tijeras Canyon during a heavy rainstorm on Whiskey but the horse gets spooked by the traffic and blinded by the lights. A truck driver strikes Burns and Whiskey as they are attempting to cross the road. The sheriff arrives and, asked by the state police if Burns is the man he has been looking for, says he can't identify him, because he's never seen the man he is looking for up close. Both seriously wounded, Burns is taken away in an ambulance and Whiskey must be euthanized.

This is what attracted me to the > story – the difficulty of being an individual today. Douglas assembled the cast and crew through his production company, Joel Productions, recruiting ex-blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo, who had written Spartacus two years before, to write the screenplay. The movie was filmed in the area in and around Albuquerque, New Mexico: the Sandia Mountains, the Manzano Mountains, the Tijeras Canyon and Kirtland Air Force Base.IMDb Filming locations The working title for the film was \\"The Last Hero,\\"TCM Overview but the release title of the film was a matter of contention between Douglas, who wanted to call it \\"The Brave Cowboy\\" after the novel, and the studio. Douglas wanted the film to open in art houses and build an audience, but Universal chose to market the film as a Western, titling it \\"Lonely Are the Brave\\" and opening it widely without any particular support. Despite this, the film has a cult following, and is often listed as one of the best Westerns ever made. Miller directed the picture with a reverent and eloquent feeling for the landscape, complementing the story arc of a lone and principled individual tested by tragedy and the drive of his fiercely independent conscience. Lonely Are the Brave premiered in Houston, Texas on 24 May 1962. President John F. Kennedy watched the movie in the White House in November 1962. In his memoir Conversations with Kennedy, Ben Bradlee wrote, \\"Jackie read off the list of what was available, and the President selected the one [film] we had all unanimously voted against, a brutal, sadistic little Western called Lonely Are the Brave.\\"Bradlee, Benjamin C., Conversations with Kennedy (Pocket Books, New York 1976), pp. 122-123 Soundtrack The score to Lonely Are the Brave was composed by Jerry Goldsmith.Jerry Goldsmith (1929–2004) tribute at Filmtracks.com. Retrieved 2011-02-11. Goldsmith's involvement in the picture was the result of a recommendation by veteran composer Alfred Newman who had been impressed with Goldsmith's score on the television show Thriller and took it upon himself to recommend Goldsmith to the head of Universal Pictures' music department, despite having never met him..

P. Putnam's Sons, 1952. Some \\"pyramidologists\\" also concern themselves with the monumental structures of pre-Columbian America (such as Teotihuacan, the Mesoamerican Maya civilization, and the Inca of the South American Andes), and the temples of Southeast Asia. Some pyramidologists claim that the Great Pyramid of Giza has encoded within it predictions for the exodus of Moses from Egypt,Capt, E. Raymond The Great Pyramid Decoded Artisan Publishers (June 1978) pp. 76-78 the crucifixion of Jesus, the start of World War I,Davidson, D.; H.W. Badger Great Pyramid & Talks on the Great Pyramid 1881 Kessinger Publishing Co (28 April 2003) p.19Collier, Robert Gordon Something to Hope For 1942 Kessinger Publishing Co (15 Oct 2004) p.17 the founding of modern-day Israel in 1948, and future events including the beginning of Armageddon; this was discovered by using what they call \\"pyramid inches\\" to calculate the passage of time where one British inch equals one solar year. Pyramidology reached its peak by the early 1980s. Interest revived when in 1992 and 1993 Rudolf Gantenbrink sent a miniature remote-controlled robot rover, known as Upuaut, up one of the \\"air shafts\\" in the Queen's Chamber of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Upuaut discovered the shaft closed off by a stone block with decaying copper hooks attached to the outside. In 1994 Robert Bauval published the book The Orion Mystery, attempting to prove that the pyramids on the Giza plateau were built to mimic the stars in the belt of the constellation Orion, a claim that came to be known as the Orion correlation theory.  Types of pyramidology  The main types of pyramidological accounts involve one or more aspects which include: *metrological: theories regarding the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza by hypothetical geometric measurements *numerological: theories that the measurements of the Great Pyramid and its passages have esoteric significance, and that their geometric measurements contain some encoded message. This form of pyramidology is popular within Christian Pyramidology (e.g. British Israelism and Bible Students). *\\"pyramid power\\": claims originating in the late 1960s that pyramids as geometrical shapes possess supernatural powers *pseudoarchaeological: varying theories that deny the pyramids were built to serve exclusively as tombs for the Pharaohs; alternative explanations regarding the construction of the pyramids (for example the use of long-lost knowledge; anti-gravity technology, etc...); and hypotheses that they were built by someone other than the historical Ancient Egyptians (e.g. early Hebrews, Atlanteans, or even extra-terrestrials)  History  =Metrological= Metrological pyramidology dates to the 17th century. John Greaves, an English mathematician, astronomer and antiquarian, first took precise measurements of the Great Pyramid at Giza using the best mathematical instruments of the day. His data was published in Pyramidographia (1646) which theorized a geometric cubit was used by the builders of the Great Pyramid (see: Egyptian royal cubit). While Greave's measurements were objective, his metrological data was later misused by numerologists: =John Taylor and the golden ratio= In the mid-19th century, Friedrich Röber studied various Egyptian pyramids which he linked to the golden ratio. This led pyramidologist John Taylor to theorize in his 1859 book The Great Pyramid: Why Was It Built and Who Built It? that the Great Pyramid of Giza is related to the golden ratio as well. Although the Great Pyramid's measurements have found to be within the margin of error, the connections between ancient Egypt and the golden ratio have been explained by modern scholars as coincidental, as no other knowledge of the golden ratio is known from before the fifth century BC. Taylor also proposed that the inch used to build the Great Pyramid was 1/25 of the \\"sacred cubit\\" (whose existence had earlier been postulated by Isaac Newton). Taylor was also the first to claim that the pyramid was divinely inspired, contained a revelation and was built not by the Egyptians, but instead by the Hebrews, pointing to Biblical passages (Is. 19: 19-20; Job 38: 5-7) to support his theories.A Study in Pyramidology, E. Raymond Capt, Hoffman Printing, 1996 ed. p. 34 For this reason Taylor is often credited as being the \\"founder of pyramidology\\". Martin Gardner noted: =Christian pyramidology= British Israelism Taylor influenced the Astronomer Royal of Scotland Charles Piazzi Smyth, F.R.S.E., F.R.A.S., who made numerous numerological calculations on the pyramid and published them in a 664-page book Our Inheritance in the Great Pyramid (1864) followed by Life, and Work in the Great Pyramid (1867). These two works fused pyramidology with British Israelism and Smyth first linked the hypothetical pyramid inch to the British Imperial Unit system.M. Reisenauer, \\"The battle of the standards\\" : Great Pyramid metrology and British identity, 1859-1890, The Historian, v. 65 no. 4 (Summer 2003) p. 931–978; E. F. Cox, The International Institute: First organized opposition to the metric system, Ohio History, v. 68, 54–83 This diagram from Charles Piazzi Smyth's Our Inheritance in the Great Pyramid (1864) shows some of his measurements and chronological determinations made from them Smyth's theories were later expanded upon by early 20th century British Israelites such as Colonel Garnier (Great Pyramid: Its Builder & Its Prophecy, 1905), who began to theorise that chambers within the Great Pyramid contain prophetic dates which concern the future of the British, Celtic, or Anglo-Saxon peoples. However this idea originated with Robert Menzies, an earlier correspondent of Smyth's.The idea of associating lengths in the pyramid with dates in history was suggested to Smyth by Robert Menzies, [Smyth, 1864, appendix II]. David Davidson with H. Aldersmith wrote The Great Pyramid, Its Divine Message (1924) and further introduced the idea that Britain's chronology (including future events) may be unlocked from inside the Great Pyramid. This theme is also found in Basil Stewart's trilogy on the same subject: Witness of the Great Pyramid (1927), The Great Pyramid, Its Construction, Symbolism and Chronology (1931) and History and Significance of the Great Pyramid... (1935). More recently a four-volume set entitled Pyramidology was published by British Israelite Adam Rutherford (released between 1957–1972).Adam Rutherford, Pyramidology Books 1, 2, and 3, C. Tinling & Co Ltd London, Liverpool and Prescot 1961, 1962 & 1966. British Israelite author E. Raymond Capt also wrote Great Pyramid Decoded in 1971 followed by Study in Pyramidology in 1986. Joseph A. Seiss Joseph Seiss was a Lutheran minister who was a proponent of pyramidology. He wrote A Miracle in Stone: or, The Great Pyramid of Egypt in 1877. His work was popular with contemporary evangelical Christians.The Great Pyramid of Egypt, Miracle in Stone: Secrets and Advanced Knowledge (2007 Reprint) by Joseph Augustus Seiss, Forgottenbooks.com, pages vii-x.  Charles Taze Russell In 1891 pyramidology reached a global audience when it was integrated into the works of Charles Taze Russell, founder of the Bible Student movement.Jehovah's Witnesses, Edmond C. Gruss, Xulon Press, 2001, pp. 210-212. Russell however denounced the British-Israelite variant of pyramidology in an article called The Anglo-Israelitish Question.Thy Kingdom Come, Charles Taze Russell, C-291, Oakland Co. Bible Students, 2000. Adopting Joseph Seiss's designation that the Great Pyramid of Giza was \\"the Bible in stone\\" Russell taught that it played a special part in God's plan during the \\"last days\\" basing his interpretation on Isaiah 19:19-20 which says - \\"In that day shall there be an altar (pile of stones) to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar (Hebrew matstebah, or monument) at the border thereof to the Lord. And it shall be for a sign, and for a witness unto the Lord of Hosts in the land of Egypt.\\" Two brothers, archaeologists John and Morton Edgar, as personal associates and supporters of Russell, wrote extensive treatises on the history, nature, and prophetic symbolism of the Great Pyramid in relation to the then known archaeological history, along with their interpretations of prophetic and Biblical chronology. They are best known for their two-volume work Great Pyramid Passages and Chambers, published in 1910 and 1913. Although most Bible Student groups continue to support and endorse the study of pyramidology from a Biblical perspective, the Bible Students associated with the Watchtower Society, who chose ’Jehovah's Witnesses’ as their new name in 1931, have abandoned pyramidology entirely since 1928.Shermer, Michael The Skeptic encyclopedia of pseudoscience, Vol. 2 ABC-CLIO Ltd; illustrated edition (31 Oct 2002) p.406 The Watchtower, 15 November and 1 December 1928. Watchtower, Bible and Tract Society. =Pyramid power= Another set of speculations concerning pyramids have centered upon the possible existence of an unknown energy concentrated in pyramidical structures.Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology, Lewis Spence, Kessinger Publishing, 2003, pp. 759-760: \\"...speculations concerning pyramids have centered upon the possible existence of an unknown energy concentrated in pyramidical structures. Pyramid energy was rediscovered in the early 1970s after it was introduced in the popular best-selling Psychic Discoveries behind the Iron Curtain by journalists Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schroeder. They described their experience with a Czech radio engineer, Karl Drbal, who had taken out a patent on a pyramid razor blade sharpener. The idea was picked up by New Age writer Lyll Wat and then a host of others including Peter Toth, Greg Nielsen, and Pat Flanagan. Through the 1970s, it was a common theme at psychic and New Age gatherings.\\" Pyramid energy was popularized in the early 1970s, particularly by New Age authors such as Patrick Flanagan (Pyramid Power: The Millennium Science, 1973), Max Toth and Greg Nielsen (Pyramid Power, 1974) and Warren Smith (Secret Forces of the Pyramids, 1975). These works focused on the alleged energies of pyramids in general, not solely the Egyptian pyramids. Toth and Nielsen for example reported experiments where \\"seeds stored in pyramid replicas germinated sooner and grew higher\\".Interventions in applied gerontology, Robert F. Morgan, Kendall/Hunt Pub. Co., 1981, pp.123-125. =Modern pyramidology= Alan F. Alford Author Alan F. Alford interprets the entire Great Pyramid in the context of ancient Egyptian religion. Alford takes as his starting point the golden rule that the pharaoh had to be buried in the earth, i.e. at ground level or below, and this leads him to conclude that Khufu was interred in an ingeniously concealed cave whose entrance is today sealed up in the so-called Well Shaft adjacent to a known cave called the Grotto.Alford, Pyramid of Secrets, chapter 4; The Midnight Sun, pp. 352-56, 358-70. He has lobbied the Egyptian authorities to explore this area of the pyramid with ground penetrating radar. The cult of creation theory also provided the basis for Alford's next idea: that the sarcophagus in the King's Chamber - commonly supposed to be Khufu's final resting place - actually enshrined iron meteorites.Alford, Pyramid of Secrets, chapter 5; The Midnight Sun, pp. 356-58 He maintains, by reference to the Pyramid Texts, that this iron was blasted into the sky at the time of creation, according to the Egyptians' geocentric way of thinking. Alford says the King's Chamber, with its upward inclined dual 'airshafts', was built to capture the magic of this mythical moment.Alford, Pyramid of Secrets, pp. 201-4; The Midnight Sun, p. 357. Alford's most speculative idea is that the King's Chamber generated low frequency sound via its 'airshafts', the purpose being to re-enact the sound of the earth splitting open at the time of creation.Alford, Pyramid of Secrets, chapter 7.The Daily Mail, 21 June 2003. India Various spiritual organizations in India have used pyramids as a means to promote theories of their potency. Numerous papers have been published in an Indian science journal called the Indian Journal of Traditional Knowledge by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. Pseudoarchaeology Lewis Spence in his An Encyclopaedia of Occultism (1920) summed up the earliest of pseudoarcheological claims on the ancient Egyptian pyramids as follows: > ...in the 1880s, Ignatius Donnelly had suggested that the Great Pyramid had > been built by the descendants of the Atlanteans. That idea was picked up in > the 1920s by Manly Palmer Hall who went on to suggest that they were the > focus of the ancient Egyptian wisdom schools. Edgar Cayce built upon Hall's > speculations.Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology, Lewis Spence, > Kessinger Publishing, 2003 (reprint), pp.759-761. Ignatius Donnelly and later proponents of the hyperdiffusionist view of history claimed that all pyramid structures across the world had a common origin. Donnelly claimed this common origin was in Atlantis,Atlantis, the Antediluvian World, Ignatius Donnelly, 1882, p. 317. while Grafton Elliot Smith claimed Egypt, writing: \\"Small groups of people, moving mainly by sea, settled at certain places and there made rude imitations of the Egyptian monuments of the Pyramid Age.\\"The Ancient Egyptians and the origin of Civilization (London/New York, Harper & Brother 1911), p. ix. =Ancient astronauts= Several proponents of ancient astronauts claim that the Great Pyramid of Giza was constructed by extraterrestrial beings, or influenced by them (e.g., through their advanced technology).They Built the Pyramids, Joseph Davidovits, Geopolymer Institute, 2008, p. 27. Proponents include Erich von Däniken, Robert Charroux, W. Raymond Drake, and Zecharia Sitchin. According to Erich Von Däniken, the Great Pyramid has advanced numerological properties which could not have been known to the ancient Egyptians and so must have been passed down by extraterrestrials: \\"...the height of the pyramid of Cheops, multiplied by a thousand million—98,000,000 miles—corresponds approximately to the distance between the Earth and the sun\\".Pseudoscience and the Paranormal, Prometheus Books, 2003, Terence Hines, p. 307. OCT - the outline of the Giza pyramids superimposed over a photograph of the stars in Orion's Belt. =Orion correlation theory= Robert Bauval and Graham Hancock (1996) have both suggested that the 'ground plan' of the three main Egyptian pyramids was physically established in c. 10,500 BC, but that the pyramids were built around 2,500 BC. This theory was based on their initial claims regarding the alignment of the Giza pyramids with OrionHancock, Graham, Fingerprints of the Gods, 1995, p. 375\\\\. \\"...the three pyramids were a terrestrial map of the three stars of Orion's belt\\" are later joined with speculation about the age of the Great Sphinx.Hancock and Bauval, Keeper of Genesis, published 1996, and in 1997 in the U.S. as The Message of the Sphinx) Advanced technology Linked to the pseudoarchaeological ancient astronaut theory and Orion correlation theory are related claims that the Great Pyramid was constructed by the use of an advanced lost technology. Proponents of this theory often link this hypothetical advanced technology to extraterrestrials but also Atlanteans, Lemurians or a legendary lost race.Technology of the Gods: The Incredible Sciences of the Ancients, David Hatcher Childress, Adventures Unlimited Press (1 Jun 2000).Forbidden Science: From Ancient Technologies to Free Energy, J. Douglas Kenyon, Inner Traditions International (21 Mar 2008)The Giza Power Plant: Technologies of Ancient Egypt, Christopher Dunn, Bear & Company (31 Oct 1998) Notable proponents include Christopher Dunn and David Hatcher Childress. Graham Hancock, in his book Fingerprints of the Gods, assigned the 'ground plan' of the three main Egyptian pyramids, in his theory of an advanced progenitor civilization which possessed advanced technology. Criticism In 1880, the renowned Egyptologist Flinders Petrie went to Egypt to perform new measurements of the Great Pyramid, and wrote that he found that the pyramid was several feet smaller than previously believed by John Taylor and Charles Piazzi Smyth.W. M. Flinders Petrie, The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh (London, 1883), p. 189 . Flinders therefore claimed that the hypothetical pyramid inch of the pyramidologists had no basis in truth, and published his results in \\"The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh\\" (1883), writing: \\"there is no authentic example, that will bear examination, of the use or existence of any such measure as a 'Pyramid inch,' or of a cubit of 25.025 British inches.\\" Proponents of the pyramid inch, especially British Israelites, responded to Petrie's discoveries and claimed to have found flaws in them.Great Pyramid Its Divine Message, D. Davidson, H. Aldersmith, Kessinger Publishing, 1992, p. 11. Petrie refused to respond to these criticisms, claiming he had disproved the pyramid inch and compared continuing proponents to \\"flat earth believers\\": In 1930, Belgian Egyptologists Jean Capart and Marcelle Werbrouck stated that \\"with the help of mathematicians and often mingling with them mystics have invented what might be called the 'religion of the pyramids'\\".Capart, Jean & Werbrouck, Marcelle (1930). Memphis à l'ombre des pyramides. Bruxelles, p. 291. Six years later, Adolf Erman complained of the fact that certain theories were still proposed, even though a century of research would have long since debunked all of them.Erman, Adolf (1936). Die Welt am Nil, Bilder aus dem alten Ägypten. Leipzig, p. 123 On 24 January 1937, Gustave Jéquier chose to expose his criticism of the pyramidology assumptions on a mass media, the newspaper Gazette de Lausanne, lamenting that \\"these speculations didn't deserve the resonance they have had\\" and warning the audience against \\"prophecies incurred by arguments masked as science, when the very foundations of these reasonings, cleverly disguised, are nothing but inaccurate news or simple hypotheses and that the whole argument is clearly tendentious\\".Cited in , pp. 25–26 The term \\"pyramidiot\\" is said to have been coined by Leonard Cottrell, whose 1956 book The Mountains of Pharaoh included a chapter entitled \\"The Great Pyramidiot\\" about Piazzi Smyth's theories. In 1964 Barbara Mertz, reflecting the views of the scientific establishment, reported another term for pyramidologists: The Toronto Society for Psychical Research organized a research team consisting of Allan Alter (B.Sc. Phm) and Dale Simmons (Dip. Engr. Tech) to explore claims made in Pyramid Power literature that pyramids could better preserve organic matter.Allen Alter, \\"The Pyramid and Food Dehydration,\\" New Horizons, Vol. 1 (Summer 1973). Extensive tests showed that pyramid containers \\"are no more effective than those of other shapes in preserving and dehydrating organic material.\\"The incredible Dr. Matrix, Martin Gardner, Scribner, 1976, p. 249Pseudoscience and the paranormal, Terence Hines, Prometheus Books, 2003, p. 306. French Egyptologist and architect Jean-Philippe Lauer undertook a scientific analysis of several pyramidologists' claims by reconstructing their reasoning step-by-step and redoing their mathematical calculations. In 1974, he concluded that those intuitions, though fascinating and made by people in good faith, have little to no regard to archaeology needs, if not to any other science at all.Lauer, Jean-Philippe (1974).

It is brown or chestnut-colored and covered with minuscule, translucent bristles, which give the species its common name. Distribution and habitat This species is endemic to California. This snail is found in northwestern Trinity County, along the Trinity River, up some of its tributaries and into the Corral Bottom area. It has a healthy population within its territory. It likes cool, wet, shady riparian zones, and prefers areas with a deciduous understory. Ecology The Trinity bristle snail is dependent on cool, moist conditions, and therefore it is only active at night. It spends warmer parts of the day stuck to shady areas on tree trunks, and in especially warm parts of the summer it may not move for days. When conditions are cool enough it feeds on lichen and the tender parts of green plants. The snail has a lifespan of over ten years, and may not reach full size for nearly that long. It is subject to predation by beetles and possibly rodents. Survival threats The species appears dependent on riparian habitats, and especially likes bigleaf maples (Acer macrophyllum), eating the leaves that are decomposing at the base of the trees(from observations during field work by Forest Service employee Gay Berrien who was involved with locating the snails during initial research in 1980). There have been no studies that show it ever occupied a larger area than it does now--much of the northwestern portion of Trinity County. At the edges of its territory it has been known to cross with others of the Monadenia genus {\\"Trinity Bristle Snail Not Big Bar Exclusive,\\" Klam-Ity Kourier, Willow Creek, California, July 23, 1980} References External links Category:Monadenia Snail Category:Molluscs of the United States Category:Endangered fauna of California Category:Gastropods described in 1852 ","title":"Trinity bristle snail"},{"id":"2165622","text":"Neophile or Neophiliac, a term popularised by cult writer Robert Anton Wilson, is a personality type characterized by a strong affinity for novelty. The term was used earlier by Christopher Booker in his book The Neophiliacs (1969), and by J. D. Salinger in his short story Hapworth 16, 1924 (1965). Characteristics Neophiles/Neophiliacs have the following basic characteristics: * The ability to adapt rapidly to extreme change. * A distaste or downright loathing of tradition, repetition, and routine. * A tendency to become bored quickly with old things. * A desire, bordering on obsession in some cases, to experience novelty. * A corresponding and related desire to create novelty by creating or achieving something and/or by stirring social or other forms of unrest. * A complete objection to or distrust of commitment. A neophile is distinct from a revolutionary in that anyone might become a revolutionary if pushed far enough by the reigning authorities or social norms, whereas neophiles are revolutionaries by nature. Their intellectual abhorrence of tradition and repetition usually bemoans a deeper emotional need for constant novelty and change. The meaning of neophile approaches and is not mutually exclusive to the term visionary, but differs in that a neophile actively seeks first-hand experience of novelty rather than merely pontificating about it. The opposite of a neophile is a neophobe; a person with an aversion to novelty and change. Wilson observes that neophobes tend to regard neophiles, especially extreme ones, with fear and contempt, and to brand them with titles such as \\"witch,\\" \\"satanist,\\" \\"heretic,\\" etc. He also speculates in his Prometheus Rising series of books that the industrial revolution and related enlightenment represents one of the first periods of history in which neophiles were a dominant force in society. Neophiles accelerate change because they like it that way. Types Open-source advocate and programmer Eric S. Raymond observes that this personality is especially prevalent in certain fields of expertise; in business, these are primarily computer science and other areas of high technology. Raymond speculates that the rapid progress of these fields (especially computers) is a result of this. A neophile's love of novelty is likely to lead them into subjects outside of the normal areas of human interest. Raymond observes a high concentration of neophiles in or around what he calls \\"leading edge subcultures\\" such as science fiction fandom, neo-paganism, transhumanism, etc. as well as in or around nontraditional areas of thought such as fringe philosophy or the occult. Raymond observes that most neophiles have roving interests and tend to be widely well-read. There is more than one type of neophile. There are social neophiles (the extreme social butterfly), intellectual neophiles (the revolutionary philosopher and the technophile), and physical/kinetic neophiles (the extreme sports enthusiast). These tendencies are not mutually exclusive, and might exist simultaneously in the same individual. The word \\"neophilia\\" has particular significance in Internet and hacker culture. The New Hacker's Dictionary gave the following definition to neophilia: > The trait of being excited and pleased by novelty. Common among most > hackers, SF fans, and members of several other connected leading-edge > subcultures, including the pro-technology 'Whole Earth' wing of the ecology > movement, space activists, many members of Mensa, and the Discordian/neo- > pagan underground (see geek). All these groups overlap heavily and (where > evidence is available) seem to share characteristic hacker tropisms for > science fiction, music.

It is part of the Ithaca City School District, and has an enrollment of approximately 1,675. The school is located at 1401 North Cayuga Street in the north end of Ithaca, near Stewart Park, Cayuga Lake, and Ithaca Falls. The current principal is Jason Trumble. In 2017, U.S. News & World Report ranked IHS as the best high school in Central New York, 48th in New York State, and 401st nationwide. History The former school, now DeWitt Mall. Ithaca High School was founded in 1875 as the successor to the Ithaca Academy, a private school that had operated since the 1820s. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the school had a significant side business as a tuition-charging college preparatory school; then-Cornell University President Jacob Gould Schurman called it \\"one of the finest in the Northeast.\\" A new building for the high school on the site of the former academy was built in 1885; that building burned on February 14, 1912. The renowned architect William Henry Miller, who designed many buildings at Cornell, designed the new building, which the high school occupied from 1915 to 1960. That building was later used as DeWitt Junior High school for a number of years and was saved from demolition by the local architect William Downing. Downing converted the building into an eclectic collection of shops, offices, studios, apartments, and restaurants known as the Dewitt Mall. The nationally renowned Moosewood Restaurant is also in the mall. The new campus, which opened in 1960, is at 1401 North Cayuga Street in the north end of Ithaca, near Stewart Park, Cayuga Lake, and Ithaca Falls. Designed by the architecture firm Perkins and Will, it is a California-style campus, with 11 mostly interconnected buildings spread across a fairly wide area. Some have praised the campus as being architecturally innovative, while others have criticized it as inefficient and inappropriate to Ithaca's climate (notably as students routinely travel outdoors between classes, out of necessity or for a more direct route). The campus includes the Frank R. Bliss Gymnasium, the 840-seat Claude L. Kulp Auditorium and York Lecture Hall. Most of the Ithaca City School District's administrative offices and the Board of Education building are located on the same campus, as are the offices of the ICSD employee unions. The building is one of the few schools that use deep lake water cooling (from Cayuga Lake) for air conditioning. From 2007 to 2009, additions were built that doubled the size of Kulp Auditorium, adding separate rehearsal, practice and office spaces for the orchestra, choir and band, as well as create a large fitness center and competition gymnasium . Local demographics have resulted in continuing socio-economic tensions: > The [Ithaca] schools have children of professors at Cornell University and > Ithaca College, who would not be rattled by a dinner-table chat about > quantum physics. They also have students from Ithaca's poorer streets and > from the hardscrabble farms and mobile homes in the villages that surround > this Finger Lakes city. \\"We have kids who live on dirt floors and go outside > to the restroom and come to school to take a shower, and we have Carl > Sagan's kids,\\" said Peter Romani, a history teacher at Ithaca High School. More recently, the school experienced difficulties in 2004 and 2007. In December 2007, over 200 Ithaca residents signed a petition calling for principal Joseph M. Wilson to be fired after what they believed was Wilson's mishandling of a series of racially charged incidents. Academics The mean SAT score in 2003 was 1169, compared to 1026 nationally. Typically, about 70% of students matriculate at four-year colleges and 20% at two-year colleges following graduation. The school traditionally sends a very large number of graduates to nearby Cornell University; from 2000 to 2004, an average of 37.6 students per class (slightly less than ten percent) matriculated at Cornell immediately following graduation.IHS Admission Decisions by Decile, 2000-2004, Ithaca High School Guidance Office. A total of 188 students from the classes of 2000 through 2004 were offered immediate acceptance at Cornell. Nineteen advanced placement courses are offered:http://www.icsd.k12.ny.us/legacy/highschool/studserv/08-09%20Program%20Studies.doc There are 140 professional staff members, including about 120 classroom teachers, and over 85% of the faculty has a master's degree or higher. Two Ithaca High School math teachers received the Edyth May Sliffe Award, given annually to about 25 math teachers nationally: Dave Bock (twice, in 1990 and 1993), and Roselyn Teukolsky (in 1991). Athletics The school is part of the Southern Tier Athletic Conference (STAC). Athletic teams compete as the \\"Little Red\\", in counterpoint to the \\"Big Red\\" of nearby Cornell University. Ithaca High School has won five New York State Class A boys’ ice hockey championships (1984, 1987, 1994, 2000, 2007), as well as four Upstate New York Girls' Hockey League championships (2001, 2002, 2003, 2011). The Ithaca women's varsity swim team has had more than two decades of consecutive Section IV titles, several unofficial state titles, and countless undefeated seasons. Since 1989, the team has lost only one dual meet in 1998. The team has been coached by Roy Staley through all of these successful seasons. The Boys' Lacrosse Program has established itself as a Section IV, Class A powerhouse, winning five straight sectional championships from 2000 to 2005 and often finding itself in the state and national rankings. Little Reds lacrosse team has reached the Section IV, Class A finals in both 2010 and 2011, losing to Fairport and Farmingdale programs respectively,http://www.laxpower.com/update11/binboy/XITHNY.PHP losses which helped to solidify its reputation as a local lacrosse hub in upstate New York and a dominant program for years to come. The boys' and girls' track and field program was undefeated in dual meets for eight years until 2005, when defeated by 70-71 by Vestal High School. The program turns out state competitors regularly in both cross country and track and field. In 2005, it produced two state and federation champions, Drew Hilker (pentathlon) and Peter Thompson (pole vault). In addition to offering most traditional school sports Ithaca offers a large array of private sports teams which are mostly made up of Ithaca High School Students. Notable among these teams are Cascadilla Boat Club, which has been undefeated in section III championships for its entire existence, and Head Over Heels Gymnastics that has had multiple state, regional, and national winners. Music From 1955 to 1967, the Ithaca High School Band received national recognition for its musicianship and innovation under the direction of Frank Battisti. During this time, the band commissioned 24 new compositions (many by Pulitzer Prize winners and some now important wind ensemble pieces), performed at locations such as the Eastman School of Music, the New York World's Fair and Rockefeller Center, and played with many guest soloists and conductors including Benny Goodman and Doc Severinsen. A book, One Band that Took a Chance by Brian Norcross, was later published about the IHS band of this era. On May 7, 2009, Ithaca High School held a 50th Anniversary concert in honor of Frank Battisti and the 1959 commission of Warren Benson's piece Night Song, which included a new commission by the local composer Gregory B. Rudgers, Night Fantasy. The Ithaca High School Orchestra, meanwhile, is one of the oldest high school orchestras in the country, having been established in 1904. It celebrated its 100th anniversary with a celebration and concert that included a newly commissioned work entitled Enlightened City by composer Robert Paterson.http://www.robpaterson.com/works- notes/enlightened_city.html Publications The Ithaca High School newspaper, the Tattler, founded in 1892, is one of the oldest high school student newspapers in the country. At times in its history (in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as more recently beginning in 2005) it has been involved in controversy over claims of unconstitutional school censorship.http://www.rmozone.com/tattlerwiki Paul Wolfowitz and Stephen L. Carter were both editors for the paper during their time at Ithaca High School. Administration IHS has in recent years had very high administrator turnover. Since 1988, fourteen principals have passed through IHS, and only one has stayed for longer than three years. In February 2008, principal Joseph M. Wilson was granted tenure in return for agreeing to resign at the end of the 2008–2009 school year. Wilson had been the subject of considerable controversy in his time at IHS. In 2005 he was sued in federal court for the alleged censorship of the school newspaper, The Tattler; the case was ultimately ruled on by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. In December 2007, over 200 Ithaca residents signed a petition calling for him to be fired after what they believed was Wilson's mishandling of a series of racially charged incidents in the school. In August 2014, Jarrett Powers announced he was leaving to become Superintendent of the Union Springs Central School District. He was replaced by longtime teacher and coach Jason Trumble. =Principals= Notable alumni The following is an incomplete list of notable Ithaca High School alumni: See also *List of high schools in New York * The Tattler References and further reading  Terzian, Sevan G. \\"The Founding of IHS\\", serialized in The Tattler, 2004–2005 * Terzian, Sevan G., & Beadie, N. \\"'Let the People Remember It': Academies and the Rise of Public High Schools, 1865-1890\\", in N.

It is found from southern Queensland through to central Victoria, including in the Murray-Darling river system. It is also found in some eastern and southern flowing coastal rivers. Found primarily in upland and \\"midland\\" habitats, though early records of fish fauna suggest it was originally far more extensively distributed and was found in some lowland habitats as well. Originally, river blackfish co-inhabited many of its lowland and \\"midland\\" habitats with species such as Murray cod and golden perch, and its upland habitats with species such as trout cod and Macquarie perch. It is a popular angling fish in some parts of its range. Description River blackfish are elongated with a rounded body, distinct snout and large mouth, and small to moderate sized eyes. The caudal fin, soft dorsal fin and anal fin are rounded. The spiny dorsal fin is low, weak and blends into the soft dorsal fin. Colour varies but is usually either yellow or green with dark green mottling, or a very dark purple/black colour. It is an ambush predator that takes crayfish, shrimp, small fish and aquatic insects. It is strongly nocturnal. Murray-Darling river blackfish show a maximum size of around 30 cm and < 0.8 kg, with larger specimens from coastal drainages reaching up to 60 cm (Gellibrand River). It is a highly underrated sportsfish, particularly the Southern form (see below). It is fast and strong, and has been shown to take flies and lures, even surface lures, in addition to the more usual worm baits. There is an unofficial world record caught by Piotr Pomorski on a WildBait Lure, in Victoria Australia that measured 70 cm in length. Range and classification Endemic to south-eastern Australia, river blackfish like many Murray-Darling native fishes have managed to cross the Great Dividing Range via natural river capture events and so are found in south-flowing coastal rivers and streams in the eastern half of Victoria. These fish are now often referred to as southern river blackfish. This population shows a far great maximum size of 60 cm or more and about . Specimens this large were likely to be very old — 30 years or more — and are rarely seen now. Southern river blackfish may be a separate species. The taxonomy does not yet reflect to this. River blackfish continue the trend present in Murray-Darling native fish of speciating into primarily lowland species and upland species, with the upland species being in this case the two-spined blackfish, Gadopsis bispinosus. The two-spined blackfish is a more specialised upland inhabitant, and is found in the strongly flowing, cobble- bottomed sub-alpine rivers and streams of northeast Victoria, southeast New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. While the split may be between lowland (or midland) and upland, there are overlaps in their range, and river blackfish are found in many upland habitats. There are also indications river blackfish populations in the southern and northern halves of the Murray-Darling river system may represent two distinct species or sub- species, with genetic and other differences. The Gadopsis blackfish and the Maccullochella cods (such as the Murray cod, Maccullochella peelii) are strongly similar. There are some grounds for believing blackfish may be a smaller version of Murray cod, inhabiting similar niches but in habitats are too small for Murray cod (having said this, their distributions originally overlapped substantially), and there are grounds for believing that blackfish and Murray cod have drawn heavily on common genes at the family level. FishBase, for instance, has scrapped the family Gadopsidae and listed the blackfishes as members of the temperate perch family, Percichthyidae. A mitochondrial DNA study has confirmed a relationship between the Blackfish and the Percichthyidae but the exact relationship was not resolved in that study. Further study is needed to resolve the relationship between the blackfish and the Percichthyidae. In addition, molecular studies have supported the view that G. marmoratus is a species complex of five different species, these include a species in the Murray-Darling Basin and four species in coastal freshwaters. One of these forms from Victoria has been named as Gadopsis gracilis. Blackfish have a recruitment method similar to Murray cod, but with more specialisation to upland habitats. Blackfish spawn in spring and lay a very limited number of large, adhesive eggs (<1000) on sunken timber (snags), or in the case of two-spined blackfish on submerged rocks. Similar to Murray cod, the male guards the eggs until they hatch. Upon hatching the larval blackfish are, uniquely, attached to their ruptured egg case by a tether until the yolk sac is largely used and the larvae are ready to commence exogenous feeding. (This unique structure is presumably an adaptation to upland river/stream habitats, to prevent larvae being swept away in currents.) Conservation Blackfish have declined very seriously due to overfishing, stream siltation and snag removal, and predation and competition by introduced species, particularly introduced trout species. Recent bushfires in south- eastern Australia (2003–2006) have filled many blackfish rivers with large quantities of silt, and infilled the interstices (\\"gaps\\") between larger rocks that blackfish normally use as a refuge from predatory alien trout species. The presumed result will be increased levels of alien trout predation on blackfish, and the long-term future of blackfish species is now of some concern. The blackfish species are very low in fecundity, slow-growing and long-lived, and have low migratory tendencies, so are extremely vulnerable to overfishing and localised extinctions. River Blackfish are a protected species in South Australia. References  Jackson, P. D.

Based on the 1950 novel Bend of the Snake by Bill Gulick, the film is about a tough cowboy who risks his life to deliver confiscated supplies to homesteaders after gold is discovered in the region. Bend of the River was filmed on location in Sandy River, Mount Hood, the Columbia River and Timberline, Oregon. This is the second Western film collaboration between Anthony Mann and James Stewart. Plot In 1866, remorseful former border raider Glyn McLyntock (James Stewart) is scouting for a wagon train of settlers to Oregon. While he is checking the trail ahead, he rescues Emerson Cole (Arthur Kennedy) from being lynched for stealing a horse. Cole, who says the horse is \\"not exactly stolen\\", thinks he has heard of McLyntock, but does not pursue the subject. One of the pioneers in the wagon train is the eligible Laura Baile (Julie Adams). That night, they are attacked by five Shoshone Indians and Laura is wounded by an arrow. McLyntock and Cole go out to deal with the Shoshones and Cole saves McLyntock's life in the process. McLyntock welcomes Cole, but Jeremy Baile (Jay C. Flippen), the leader of the settlers, does not trust Cole and does not believe that a man can change from bad to good. When they reach Portland, Oregon, Laura remains there to recover. Cole also leaves the party saying that he wants to go to California to find gold. The rest, including McLyntock, go on to establish a settlement in the wilderness after making arrangements with a man named Tom Hendricks (Howard Petrie) for the supplies they need for the winter to be sent on later (\\"the first week in September\\"). That night, they have a big party and meet a professional gambler named Trey Wilson (Rock Hudson). With winter fast approaching and the supplies at least six weeks late, they begin to worry when the food runs low. McLyntock and Jeremy go back to Portland to investigate. They find that a gold rush has inflated prices enormously. Laura and Cole are working for Hendricks and have no intention of going to the settlement. Jeremy is not happy about his daughter being Cole's girl. Meanwhile, Hendricks has decided to sell their supplies for a much higher price to a mining camp. McLyntock secretly hires some men to load the supplies to take back to the settlement, but Hendricks finds out, instigating a shootout. Cole and Trey both side with McLyntock. When they are pursued, McLyntock sets up an ambush. Hendricks and some of his gang are killed, and the rest are driven off. On the way to the settlement, some of the miners show up and offer an exorbitant sum for the supplies. The hired men begin thinking about commandeering the wagon train. Cole cannot resist the temptation of all that money and double-crosses his friend, but does not kill him. That proves to be a fatal mistake. McLyntock tracks them down and retakes the supplies with the assistance of Jeremy, Laura, and Trey. Cole brings some miners, but they are beaten off in a climactic gunfight at a river. McLyntock fights and kills Cole, and the current takes his body away. At the end, they reach the settlement with the supplies and it is apparent that Laura and McLyntock are now a couple.

This new Stewart persona was more violent, edgier and more disillusioned, but a persona that was still likable. This collaboration included eight films, five of them Westerns. Along with Winchester '73 and Bend of the River, these included The Naked Spur (1953), The Far Country (1954) and The Man From Laramie (1955). This was the second of the Western collaborations between them. The film was written by Borden Chase, who had co-written Winchester '73 and would write The Far Country. It was based on the 1950 novel Bend of the Snake, by Bill Gulick. In Great Britain in the 1950s, the movie was known under the title Where the River Bends. Under this name the film was given a multi-page review section in F. Maurice Speed's The Western Film Annual for the 1952 edition of his book. Character actor Arthur Kennedy was cast as Emerson Cole. Kennedy was confined to shooting riding scenes until his knee healed, after spraining it while filming the fight scene with Jay C. Flippen, who plays Jeremy Baile, the leader of the Baile family. Julie Adams was cast as Laura while Lori Nelson was cast as her sister Marjie. Adams is best known for her role as Kay Lawrence in the 1954 horror film Creature from the Black Lagoon and Nelson played the female lead role in the 1955 sequel Revenge of the Creature, which were both directed by Jack Arnold. Rock Hudson played Trey Wilson, a professional gambler. The film was filmed in Mount Hood, Sandy River and Timberline, Oregon. To promote the film before it was released, a 3.6 mile steamboat race on the Columbia River was staged on January 24, 1952, featuring the sternwheeler Henderson (which had been used in the film, and which had several of the stars on board) versus the newer sternwheeler Portland. The Henderson won the race. Reception The film first released on February 13, 1952. The film grossed about $3 million. When first released, the film received poor reviews, but has since then gained more critical acclaim and is recognized as a great Western. The New York Times, in its 1952 review said the film \\"keeps you guessing as to which of its male stars is going to turn out 'good' and which 'bad' and of the cast, the paper's reviewer commented \\"So it comes down to farmers and miners and Mr. Stewart versus Mr. Kennedy. Both actors are first-rate performers when it comes to slinging guns and giving a general impression of cryptic personalities. Jay C. Flippen is good as the top farmer, Julia Adams and Lori Nelson make svelte farm girls and Rock Hudson is ornamental as a gentleman gambler who strings along. We are sorry to note that Stepin Fetchit is back to play a clownish stereotype, but the scenery is good in Technicolor and the fightin' is frequent and bold.\\" Stewart took a percentage of the profits. In 1953, William Goetz estimated that Stewart had earned $750,000 from the film. The movie holds a perfect 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In 2008, Bend of the River was nominated for AFI's Top 10 Western Films list.

It is found in the cool, clear, strong-flowing, cobble bottomed, sub-alpine rivers and streams (ranging from small to large) in the southeast corner of the Murray-Darling river system. Their range encompasses northeast Victoria, southeast New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. Originally two-spined blackfish co-inhabited many of these waters with Macquarie perch and trout cod. Two-spined blackfish are similar in shape and appearance to river blackfish, though their spiny dorsal fin usually contain only two spines (hence their scientific name) in comparison to river blackfish which have 7 to 13 distinguishable spines in their spiny dorsal fin. (In reality, this is a rather academic point as two-spined blackfish have blurred the difference between the dorsal spines and the dorsal rays that make up their soft dorsal fin, and any distinctions between the two weakly calcified dorsal spines and the dorsal rays that follow it are hard to pick in a living specimen.) The two-spined blackfish is similar to the river blackfish in spawning and diet; however, they prefer rocks and the interstices (\\"gaps\\") between to timber as the main spawning and habitat sites. Two-spined blackfish are also much smaller, commonly 15 to 17 cm and a maximum size of 30 cm. The species feeds mostly on aquatic insect larvae and terrestrial invertebrates, and occasionally other fishes and crayfish. Two-spined blackfish breed between October and December. Larvae hatch after around 16 days and remain at the spawning site with the male parent for another 3 weeks. Two-spined blackfish have declined seriously due to stream siltation and competition by introduced species, particularly introduced trout species. The species suffers serious predation and competition from introduced species of trout but due its nocturnal habits and cryptic, cover-oriented behaviour it appears to survive in sufficient numbers to maintain populations in high quality habitats. Recent severe bushfires in south-eastern Australia (2003–2006), however, have filled many upland rivers with large quantities of silt, and infilled the interstices (\\"gaps\\") between larger rocks that two-spined blackfish normally use as a refuge from predatory trout species.

He is the last holdout among the several people whose land the Air Force wants, and he refuses to move. A young land developer, Mackie, is sent to vacate the rancher, but soon he joins in defying the military. Soon it boils down to a battle of wills between Vogelin and the equally bullheaded army officer Colonel Desalius.

In 1923, they began publishing lectures delivered at the People's Institute, the adult education division of New York City's Cooper Union. William and Margaret had a daughter, Anne Aston Warder Norton (1928-1977). The Nortons soon expanded their program beyond the Institute, acquiring manuscripts by celebrated academics from America and abroad. This is the beginning of W. W. Norton & Company. Starting in 1942 he was very active with the Council on Books in Wartime. It was that council, which was a consortium of publishers, that agreed to an equitable distribution of paper and binding materials, all these scarce materials that went into the manufacture of books. He died at 54, just four months after V-E Day.

After extraction, fragments of interest can be mixed, precipitated, and enzymatically ligated together in several simple steps. This process, usually performed on plasmids, is the basis for rudimentary genetic engineering. After DNA samples are run on an agarose gel, extraction involves four basic steps: identifying the fragments of interest, isolating the corresponding bands, isolating the DNA from those bands, and removing the accompanying salts and stain. To begin, UV light is shone on the gel in order to illuminate all the ethidium bromide-stained DNA. Care must be taken to avoid exposing the DNA to mutagenic radiation for longer than absolutely necessary. The desired band is identified and physically removed with a cover slip or razor blade. The removed slice of gel should contain the desired DNA inside. An alternative method, utilizing SYBR Safe DNA gel stain and blue- light illumination, avoids the DNA damage associated with ethidium bromide and UV light.Quest: An Invitrogen Publication for Discovery Vol. 4, Issue 2, pp. 44–45 (2007). Several strategies for isolating and cleaning the DNA fragment of interest exist. Spin Column Extraction Gel extraction kits are available from several major biotech manufacturers for a final cost of approximately 1–2 US$ per sample. Protocols included in these kits generally call for the dissolution of the gel-slice in 3 volumes of chaotropic agent at 50 °C, followed by application of the solution to a spin-column (the DNA remains in the column), a 70% ethanol wash (the DNA remains in the column, salt and impurities are washed out), and elution of the DNA in a small volume (30 µL) of water or buffer.Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit Instruction Manual. http://www.zymoresearch.com/zrc/pdf/D4001i.pdf Dialysis The gel fragment is placed in a dialysis tube that is permeable to fluids but impermeable to molecules at the size of DNA, thus preventing the DNA from passing through the membrane when soaked in TE buffer. An electric field is established around the tubing (in a way similar to gel electrophresis) long enough so that the DNA is removed from the gel but remains in the tube. The tube solution can then be pipetted out and will contain the desired DNA with minimal background. Traditional The traditional method of gel extraction involves creating a folded pocket of Parafilm wax paper and placing the agarose fragment inside. The agarose is physically compressed with a finger into a corner of the pocket, partially liquifying the gel and its contents. The liquid droplets can then be directed out of the pocket onto an exterior piece of Parafilm, where they are pipetted into a small tube. A butanol extraction removes the ethidium bromide stain, followed by a phenol/chloroform extraction of the cleaned DNA fragment. The disadvantage of gel isolation is that background can only be removed if it can be physically identified using the UV light. If two bands are very close together, it can be hard to separate them without some contamination. In order to clearly identify the band of interest, further restriction digests may be necessary. Restriction sites unique to unwanted bands of similar size can aid in breaking up these potential contaminants. = References = External links Category:Molecular biology Category:Laboratory techniques ","title":"Gel extraction"},{"id":"2165664","title":"Division of Prospect"},{"id":"2165666","text":"White coffee can refer to any of a number of different kinds of coffees or coffee substitutes worldwide.  Coffee with whitener  In many English- speaking countries, \\"white coffee\\" is used to refer to regular black coffee that has had milk, cream or some other \\"whitener\\" added to it, though the term is almost entirely unheard of in the US, where the same beverage might be called \\"coffee light\\" in the New York City area, \\"light coffee\\", \\"coffee with milk,\\" or \\"regular coffee\\" in New England and New York City. Cream varieties, often called \\"creamers\\" in the US, can be made of dairy milk, corn syrup derivatives, soy, or nut products. Sweeteners used include cane sugar or artificial ingredients. White coffee should be distinguished from café au lait, in that white coffee uses chilled or room-temperature milk or other whitener, while café au lait uses heated or steamed milk.  Other coffee drinks  = Malaysia = In Malaysia, the original white coffee started in the Old Town of Ipoh and was a drink made from beans roasted in margarine, ground, brewed and served with sweetened condensed milk. Ipoh Oldtown White Coffee continues to be popular throughout the country. However, “white coffee” in Malaysia often simply refers to how the drink is prepared and presented - with added milk or creamer. Overseas visitors finding the margarine-roasted coffee beans unorthodox (due to their slight caramelized flavor) are often misled into believing that there is a type of coffee bean endemic to Malaysia called the \\"white coffee bean\\". The beans used are invariably imported beans roasted to a light color. Local coffee manufacturers now mix instant coffee powder with non-dairy creamer or whitener and sugar, and market the 3-in-1 mixture as white coffee as well. The mixture is preferred by Malaysians at home or in the office as a convenient easy-to-prepare coffee drink. The advisability, however, of consuming instant coffee mixed with non-dairy creamer and sugar daily is slowly coming into question, with some manufacturers now taking the sugar out of the mixture, and marketing the 2-in-1 mixture as sugar-free white coffee. = Indonesia = In Indonesia, the term white coffee or kopi putih refers to coffee beans which are roasted less than regular coffee beans. The shorter and lower heat roasting yields lighter- colored coffee beans, called biji kopi putih or white coffee beans. The white coffee beans are harder and different in taste than regular coffee beans. White coffee has a savory and mild taste compared to its regular counterpart. Due to its shorter roasting time, white coffee has a higher concentration of caffeine. = Lebanon = Lebanese white coffee \\"kahwah bayda\\" (قهوة بيضاء) is a caffeine-free drink made from water, orange blossom water, and sweetened with sugar if desired. Although not the most common substitute for coffee it is occasionally served in lieu of coffee (Turkish coffee). Ahweh bayda is traditionally thought to have a soothing effect when taken. = United States = In the United States, white coffee may also refer to coffee beans which have been roasted to a yellow roast level. When prepared as espresso these beans produce a thin yellow brew, with a high acidic note. There is a debate about whether white coffee is more highly caffeinated than darker roasted coffee. In fact, the sublimation point of caffeine is , about one hundred degrees lower than the typical very dark roast. Coffee beans can catch fire at temperatures lower than . White coffee is generally used only for making espresso drinks, not simple brewed coffee. With shorter roasting times, natural sugars are not caramelized within the coffee beans, making the coffee less bitter. The flavor of white coffee is frequently described as nutlike, with pronounced acidity. White coffee is usually purchased pre-ground due to the fact that the beans are harder than regular coffee, making it difficult to grind, even using a commercial grinder. For this reason, white coffee usually pours fast when using a commercial espresso machine. It is common for baristas to use the second pour rather than the first because it is believed to have more caffeine and a smoother flavor. = Yemen = There is also a form of white coffee, native to Yemen, which refers to the ground shell of the coffee bean. This form of coffee earns its name from its color, and is brewed in the same manner as regular coffee, only with some spices added.

It became available as a generic medication in 2019. It works by inhibiting the breakdown of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It is also known as γ-vinyl-GABA, and is a structural analogue of GABA, but does not bind to GABA receptors.Long, Phillip W. \\"Vigabatrin.\\" Internet Mental Health. 1995–2003. Medical uses =Epilepsy= In Canada, vigabatrin is approved for use as an adjunctive treatment (with other drugs) in treatment resistant epilepsy, complex partial seizures, secondary generalized seizures, and for monotherapy use in infantile spasms in West syndrome. As of 2003, vigabatrin is approved in Mexico for the treatment of epilepsy that is not satisfactorily controlled by conventional therapy (adjunctive or monotherapy) or in recently diagnosed patients who have not tried other agents (monotherapy).DEF Mexico: Sabril Diccionario de Especialdades Farmaceuticas. Edicion 49, 2003. Vigabatrin is also indicated for monotherapy use in secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures, partial seizures, and in infantile spasms due to West syndrome. On August 21, 2009, Lundbeck announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had granted two New Drug Application approvals for vigabatrin. The drug is indicated as monotherapy for pediatric patients one month to two years of age with infantile spasms for whom the potential benefits outweigh the potential risk of vision loss, and as adjunctive (add-on) therapy for adult patients with refractory complex partial seizures (CPS) who have inadequately responded to several alternative treatments and for whom the potential benefits outweigh the risk of vision loss. In 1994, Feucht and Brantner-Inthaler reported that vigabatrin reduced seizures by 50-100% in 85% of children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who had poor results with sodium valproate. =Others= Vigabatrin reduced cholecystokinin tetrapeptide-induced symptoms of panic disorder, in addition to elevated cortisol and ACTH levels, in healthy volunteers. Vigabatrin is also used to treat seizures in succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (SSADHD), which is an inborn GABA metabolism defect that causes intellectual disability, hypotonia, seizures, speech disturbance, and ataxia through the accumulation of γ-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB). Vigabatrin helps lower GHB levels through GABA transaminase inhibition. However, this is in the brain only; it has no effect on peripheral GABA transaminase, so the GHB keeps building up and eventually reaches the brain. Adverse effects =Central nervous system= Sleepiness (12.5%), headache (3.8%), dizziness (3.8%), nervousness (2.7%), depression (2.5%), memory disturbances (2.3%), diplopia (2.2%), aggression (2.0%), ataxia (1.9%), vertigo (1.9%), hyperactivity (1.8%), vision loss (1.6%) (See below), confusion (1.4%), insomnia (1.3%), impaired concentration (1.2%), personality issues (1.1%). Out of 299 children, 33 (11%) became hyperactive. Some patients develop psychosis during the course of vigabatrin therapy, which is more common in adults than in children. This can happen even in patients with no prior history of psychosis. Other rare CNS side effects include anxiety, emotional lability, irritability, tremor, abnormal gait, and speech disorder. =Gastrointestinal= Abdominal pain (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), vomiting (1.4%), and nausea (1.4%). Dyspepsia and increased appetite occurred in less than 1% of subjects in clinical trials. =Body as a whole= Fatigue (9.2%), weight gain (5.0%), asthenia (1.1%). =Teratogenicity= A teratology study conducted in rabbits found that a dose of 150 mg/kg/day caused cleft palate in 2% of pups and a dose of 200 mg/kg/day caused it in 9%. This may be due to a decrease in methionine levels, according to a study published in March 2001. In 2005, a study conducted at the University of Catania was published stating that rats whose mothers had consumed 250–1000 mg/kg/day had poorer performance in the water maze and open-field tasks, rats in the 750-mg group were underweight at birth and did not catch up to the control group, and rats in the 1000 mg group did not survive pregnancy. There is no controlled teratology data in humans to date. =Sensory= In 2003, vigabatrin was shown by Frisén and Malmgren to cause irreversible diffuse atrophy of the retinal nerve fiber layer in a retrospective study of 25 patients. This has the most effect on the outer area (as opposed to the macular, or central area) of the retina. Visual field defects had been reported as early as 1997 by Tom Eke and others, in the UK. Some authors, including Comaish et al. believe that visual field loss and electrophysiological changes may be demonstrable in up to 50% of Vigabatrin users. The retinal toxicity of vigabatrin can be attributed to a taurine depletion. Due to safety issues, the Vigabatrin REMS Program is required by the FDA to ensure informed decisions before initiating and to ensure appropriate use of this drug. Interactions A study published in 2002 found that vigabatrin causes a statistically significant increase in plasma clearance of carbamazepine. In 1984, Drs Rimmer and Richens at the University of Wales reported that administering vigabatrin with phenytoin lowered the serum phenytoin concentration in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy. Five years later, the same two scientists reported a fall in concentration of phenytoin of 23% within five weeks in a paper describing their failed attempt at elucidating the mechanism behind this interaction. Pharmacology Vigabatrin is an irreversible mechanism-based inhibitor of gamma-aminobutyric acid aminotransferase (GABA-AT), the enzyme responsible for the catabolism of GABA. Inhibition of GABA-AT results in increased levels of GABA in the brain. Vigabatrin is a racemic compound, and its [S]-enantiomer is pharmacologically active., Crystal Structure (pdb:1OHW) showing vigabatrin binding to specific residues in the active site of GABA-AT, based on experiments by Storici et al. Pharmacokinetics With most drugs, elimination half-life is a useful predictor of dosing schedules and the time needed to reach steady state concentrations. In the case of vigabatrin, however, it has been found that the half-life of biologic activity is far longer than the elimination half-life. For vigabatrin, there is no range of target concentrations because researchers found no difference between the serum concentration levels of responders and those of non-responders. Instead, the duration of action is believed to be more a function of the GABA-T resynthesis rate; levels of GABA-T do not usually return to their normal state until six days after stopping the medication. History Vigabatrin was developed in the 1980s with the specific goal of increasing GABA concentrations in the brain in order to stop an epileptic seizure. To do this, the drug was designed to irreversibly inhibit the GABA transaminase, which degrades the GABA substrate. Although the drug was approved for treatment in the United Kingdom in 1989, the authorized use of Vigabatrin by US Food and Drug Administration was delayed twice in the United States before 2009. It was delayed in 1983 because animal trials produced intramyelinic edema, however, the effects were not apparent in human trials so the drug design continued. In 1997, the trials were temporarily suspended because it was linked to peripheral visual field defects in humans.

He is the son of Norman Maclean, author of A River Runs Through It. Biography John N. Maclean was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1943, the second of two children. He attended the University of Chicago school system through high school and graduated from Shimer College in Mt. Carroll, Illinois, then a satellite school of the U of C. Maclean began his career in journalism in 1964 as a police reporter and rewrite man with the City News Bureau of Chicago. He went to work for the Chicago Tribune the following year. He married Frances Ellen McGeachie in 1968; they have two sons, Daniel, a science teacher in Anchorage, Alaska, and John Fitzroy, a public defender for the state of Maryland. In 1970 Maclean was assigned to the Washington Bureau of the Tribune. As diplomatic correspondent there he covered the State Department and was a regular on the \\"Kissinger Shuttle,\\" covering much of the \\"shuttle diplomacy\\" of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Maclean was a Nieman Fellow in Journalism at Harvard University for the 1974-1975 academic year and became the Tribune’s Foreign Editor in Chicago in 1988. He resigned from the newspaper in 1995 (after news reports of Colorado's tragic South Canyon Fire) to write Fire on the Mountain and has since published three other books on fatal wildland fires.

The book won the Mountains and Plains Booksellers award for the best non-fiction of 1994. Maclean's second book, Fire and Ashes: On the Frontlines of American Wildfire, was published in 2003 and chronicles the 1953 Rattlesnake Fire on the Mendocino National Forest in northern California, the 1999 Sadler Fire in Nevada, and the 1949 Mann Gulch Fire in Montana, which was the subject of his father, Norman Maclean's Young Men and Fire, a book published posthumously with John’s assistance. Maclean's third book, The Thirtymile Fire: A Chronicle of Bravery and Betrayal, recounts the deadly Thirtymile Fire (and the controversy and recriminations that raged in its aftermath). The Thirtymile entrapped and killed four members of a fire crew. Maclean's fourth book, The Esperanza Fire: Arson, Murder and the Agony of Engine 57 details the 2006 wildfire that killed a five-man Forest Service engine crew. The arsonist, Raymond Lee Oyler, was the first person ever convicted of murder for setting a wildland fire; Oyler was sentenced to death sentenced to death and remains on Death Row at California's San Quentin State Prison.

Hindu texts have taken positions regarding the homosexual characters and themes. Rigveda, one of the four canonical sacred texts of Hinduism says Vikriti Evam Prakriti (meaning what seems unnatural is also natural), which some scholars believe recognises homosexual dimensions of human life, like all forms of universal diversities. The ancient Indian text Kamasutra written by Vātsyāyana dedicates a complete chapter on erotic homosexual behaviour. Historical literary evidence indicates that homosexuality has been prevalent across the Indian subcontinent throughout history, and that homosexuals were not necessarily considered inferior in any way until about 18th century during British colonial rule. On 6 September 2018, a 5-judge constitutional bench of Supreme Court of India invalidated part of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, hence making homosexuality legal in India. In striking down the colonial-era law that made gay sex punishable by up to 10 years in prison, one judge said the landmark decision would \\"pave the way for a better future.\\" This ruling also applied to Jammu and Kashmir state under Article 141 of the Constitution of India and Delhi Agreement 1952, as section 377 of IPC and Ranbir Penal Code is prima materia and Judicial Pronouncements were extended to Jammu and Kashmir. There are no official demographics for the LGBT population in India, but the government of India submitted figures to the Supreme Court in 2012, according to which, there were about 2.5 million gay people recorded in India. These figures are only based on those individuals who have self-declared to the Ministry of Health. There may be much higher statistics for individuals who have concealed their identity, since a number of homosexual Indians are living in the closet due to fear of discrimination. Homophobia is prevalent in India. Public discussion of homosexuality in India has been inhibited by the fact that sexuality in any form is rarely discussed openly. In recent years, however, attitudes towards homosexuality have shifted slightly. In particular, there have been more depictions and discussions of homosexuality in the Indian media and cinema. Before striking down the colonial-era law several organisations have expressed support for decriminalising homosexuality in India, and pushed for tolerance and social equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. India is among countries with a social element of a third gender, but mental, physical, emotional and economic violence against the LGBT community in India prevails. Lacking support from family, society or police, many gay rape victims do not report the crimes. History There are Ancient Indian texts which are relevant to modern LGBT causes. Religion has played a role in shaping Indian customs and traditions. While injunctions on homosexuality's morality are not explicitly mentioned in the religious texts central to Hinduism (the largest religion in India) it has taken various positions, ranging from homosexual characters and themes in its texts to being neutral or antagonistic towards it. Rigveda, one of the four canonical sacred texts of Hinduism says Vikriti Evam Prakriti (Sanskrit: विकृतिः एवम्‌ प्रकृति, meaning what seems unnatural is also natural), which some scholars believe recognises homosexual/transsexual dimensions of human life, like all forms of universal diversities. The ancient Indian text Kamasutra written by Vātsyāyana dedicates a complete chapter on erotic homosexual behaviour. Historical literary evidence indicates that homosexuality has been prevalent across the Indian subcontinent throughout history, and that homosexuals were not necessarily considered inferior in any way until about 18th century during British colonial rule. The Arthashastra, an ancient Indian treatise on statecraft, mentions a wide variety of sexual practices which, whether performed with a man or a woman, were sought to be punished with the lowest grade of fine. While homosexual intercourse was not sanctioned, it was treated as a very minor offence, and several kinds of heterosexual intercourse were punished more severely. Sex between non-virgin women incurred a small fine, while homosexual intercourse between men could be made up for merely with a bath with one's clothes on, and a penance of \\"eating the five products of the cow and keeping a one-night fast\\".

Gouache Wellcome L0033073.jpgTwo women using carrots as dildos, 20th century gouache painting. Legal status On 24 August 2017, India's Supreme Court gave the country's LGBT community the freedom to safely express their sexual orientation. Therefore, an individual's sexual orientation is protected under the country's Right to Privacy law. However, the Supreme Court did not directly overturn any laws criminalizing same-sex relationships. On 6 September 2018, consensual gay sex was legalised by India's Supreme Court. Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), dating back to 1861, makes sexual activities \\"against the order of nature\\" punishable by law and carries a life sentence. The law replaced the variety of punishments for Zina (unlawful intercourse) mandated in the Mughal empire's Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, these ranged from 50 lashes for a slave, 100 for a free infidel, to death by stoning for a Muslim.A digest of the Moohummudan law pp. 1–3 with footnotes, Neil Baillie, Smith Elder, London Similarly the Goa Inquisition once prosecuted the capital crime of sodomy in Portuguese India, but not lesbian acts. =Support for decriminalisation= Gay Pride March in Bangalore (2013) One leader, Akkai Padmashali (born Jagadeesh) was influential in the protests and demonstrations that eventually led to the repeal of Section 377 of Indian Penal Code. She started the organization \\"Ondede\\" in 2014 which envisioned a society that is non-discriminatory and gender-just. Ondede, in Kannada, means convergence and this is what she envisioned for the society of India as a whole. She wanted Ondede to be a place where people of all sexual orientations spoke openly of their concerns. Their mission statement is \\"To create a space for dialogue, support and strengthen action to visibilize issues of Dignity-Voice- Sexuality in relation to children, women and sexual minorities\\". They develop partnerships with community groups through social movements, engage with the state and conduct research. Several organisations, including the Naz Foundation (India) Trust, the National AIDS Control Organisation, Law Commission of India, Union Health Ministry, National Human Rights Commission of India and the Planning Commission of India have expressed support for decriminalising homosexuality in India. In September 2006, Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen, acclaimed writer Vikram Seth and other prominent Indians publicly demanded the repeal of section 377 of the IPC. The open letter demanded that \\"In the name of humanity and of our Constitution, this cruel and discriminatory law should be struck down.\\" On 30 June 2008, Indian Labour Minister Oscar Fernandes backed calls for decriminalisation of consensual gay sex, and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called for greater tolerance towards homosexuals. On 23 July 2008, Bombay High Court Judge Bilal Nazki said that India's unnatural sex law should be reviewed. The Law Commission of India had historically favoured the retention of this section in its 42nd and 156th report, but in its 172nd report, delivered in 2000, it recommended its repeal. On 9 August 2008, then health minister, Anbumani Ramadoss began his campaign for changing Section 377 of the Indian penal code, which defines homosexuality as an unnatural act and thus illegal. At the International AIDS Conference in Mexico City, he said, \\"Section 377 of IPC, which criminalises men who have sex with men, must go.\\" His ministerial portfolio had put him at odds with the Indian Home Minister Shivraj Patil and several other ministers in seeking to scrap Section 377. In late 2008, he changed his argument saying he does not want the scrapping of Section 377 but a mere modification of the law treating homosexuality as a criminal offence punishable up to life imprisonment. He said he wants Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to resolve the matter, while he wanted to avoid discord with the home ministry, who said the altered law would then result in an increase in criminal incidences of sodomy or offences involving sexual abuse of children, particularly boys. In doing so he alleged that the law even penalises health workers who treat homosexuals, while making this a cognizable and non-bailable offence. Various Hindu organisations, based in India and abroad have supported decriminalisation of homosexual behaviours. In 2009, the Hindu Council UK became one of the first major religious organisations to support LGBT rights when they issued a statement \\"Hinduism does not condemn homosexuality\\". Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, a prominent Hindu spiritual leader, has condemned sec 377 in a series of tweets, maintaining that \\"Hinduism has never considered homosexuality a crime\\" and \\"to brand a person a criminal based on sexual preference would be absurd\\". The United Nations has urged India to decriminalise homosexuality by saying it would help the fight against HIV/AIDS by allowing intervention programmes, much like the successful ones in China and Brazil. Jeffrey O'Malley, director of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on HIV/AIDS, has stated countries which protect men who have sex with men (MSM) have double the rate of coverage of HIV prevention services as much as 60%. According to him, inappropriate criminalisation hinders universal access to essential HIV, health and social services. Later talking to The Hindu in November 2008, he added concerns that the then in power United Progressive Alliance government was in a difficult position in regards to amending Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code because of the then upcoming elections, as such changes could be misrepresented. He further emphasised the need to change the laws, sensitise the police and judiciary. According to him, after removal of discriminatory laws, marginalised groups would have better access to treatment and prevention facilities like condoms. He warned of the urgency and stated that India had succeeded in checking the spread of AIDS through commercial sex workers but transmission through gay sex, and injectable-drug users was still an area of concern in the country. In July 2014, a book on LGBTQIA and genderqueer rights published by Srishti Madurai was released by Vanathi Srinivasan, the general secretary of the BJP in Tamil Nadu. The move has been considered encouraging by members of the LGBTQIA community. Bharatiya Janata Party senior leader Arun Jaitley stated in February 2014 that he supported decriminalisation of homosexuality. On 13 January 2015, BJP spokesperson Shaina NC, appearing on NDTV, stated, \\"We BJP are for decriminalising homosexuality. That is the progressive way forward.\\" However, the BJP government (at that time the ruling party at the Union of India) did not put forth any stand before the Supreme Court when the Navtej Johar case (which decriminalised homosexuality) was being decided and left the matter to the 'wisdom of the court'. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh spokesperson Ram Madhav in an interview with national daily Business Standard said in May 2014: \\"But I can say this – that while glorification of certain forms of social behaviour is not something we endorse, the penalising and criminalisation aspects need to be looked into. Whether to call homosexuality a crime and treat it as one in this day and age is questionable.\\" This is interpreted as Sangh's support to decriminalisation of homosexuality. On 6 March 2016, Srishti Madurai's new website was launched by Dalit activist and Ambedkarite Ma. Venkatesan from BJP in the presence of Central Minister Pon Radhakrishnan, Vanathi Srinivasan, Aravindan Neelakandan, Joe D'Cruz and scores of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh volunteers at Chennai. =Court proceedings= In December 2002, Naz Foundation filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) to challenge IPC Section 377 in the Delhi High Court. On 4 July 2008, the Delhi High Court noted that there was \\"nothing unusual\\" in holding a gay rally, something which is common outside India. On 2 July 2009, in the case of Naz Foundation v National Capital Territory of Delhi, the High Court of Delhi struck down much of S. 377 of the IPC as being unconstitutional. The Court held that to the extent S. 377 criminalised consensual non-vaginal sexual acts between adults, it violated an individual's fundamental rights to equality before the law, freedom from discrimination and to life and personal liberty under Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India. The High Court did not strike down Section 377 completely. It held the section to be valid in case of non-consensual non-vaginal intercourse or to intercourse with minors, and it expressed the hope that Parliament would legislatively address the issue. On 11 December 2013, on responding an appeal filed by an astrologer Suresh Kumar Koushal and others, the Supreme Court of India upheld the constitutionality of Section 377 of the IPC, and stated that the Court was instead deferring to Indian legislators to provide the sought- after clarity. The Delhi High Court judgement was as follows: On 28 January 2014, Supreme Court dismissed the review petition filed by Central Government, Naz Foundation and several others, against its 11 December verdict on Section 377 of IPC. In January 2015, National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) said that according to data collected, 778 cases were filed under Section 377 of IPC and 587 arrests were made in 2014 until October after the Supreme Court verdict. Some states are yet to submit their full data. On 18 December 2015 Shashi Tharoor, a member of the Indian National Congress, introduced a Private Members Bill for the decriminalisation of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code in the Lok Sabha, but the motion was rejected by house by a vote of 71–24 with one abstention. On 12 March 2016, Tharoor once again introduced a Private Members Bill for the decriminilsation of Section 377. However, the motion for introduction was yet again defeated by a division of 58–14 with one abstention. On 2 February 2016, the Supreme Court agreed to reconsider its 2013 judgment; it said it would refer petitions to abolish Section 377 to a five-member constitutional bench, which would conduct a comprehensive hearing of the issue. On 24 August 2016 a draft law for the ban of commercial surrogacy was cleared by the Union Cabinet and announced by Sushma Swaraj, the Minister of External Affairs (India). The draft bill denied homosexuals from having surrogate children, with Swaraj stating \\"We do not recognise live-in and homosexual relationships ... this is against our ethos\\". On 24 August 2017, the Supreme Court upheld that the right to individual privacy is an \\"intrinsic\\" and fundamental right under the constitution. In its 547-page decision on privacy rights, the nine-judge bench also held that \\"sexual orientation is an essential attribute of privacy\\". The judgement noted, \\"Discrimination against an individual on the basis of sexual orientation is deeply offensive to the dignity and self-worth of the individual. Equality demands that the sexual orientation of each individual in society must be protected on an even platform. The right to privacy and the protection of sexual orientation lie at the core of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution.\\" On 10 July 2018, the Hon'ble Supreme Court upholding the importance of the rights of the LGBT community through Justice D. Y. Chandrachud in the proceedings of the court held that Choosing a Partner is every person's Fundamental Right On 6 September 2018, the Supreme Court struck down the part of section 377, a British-era provision, criminalising consensual homosexual activities. The apex court upheld that other aspects of section 377 criminalising unnatural sex with minors and animals will remain in force. Religious opposition The 11 December 2013 judgement of the Supreme Court, upholding Section 377, was met with support from religious leaders. The main petitioner in the plea was an astrologer, Suresh Kumar Koushal, and other petitioners were religious organizations like All India Muslim Personal Law Board, Trust God Missionaries, Krantikari Manuwadi Morcha, Apostolic Churches Alliance, and Utkal Christian Council. The Daily News and Analysis called it \\"the univocal unity of religious leaders in expressing their homophobic attitude. Usually divisive and almost always seen tearing down each other's religious beliefs, leaders across sections came forward in decrying homosexuality and expressing their solidarity with the judgment.\\" The article added that Baba Ramdev India's well-known yoga guru, after advising that journalists interviewing him not to turn homosexual, stated he could cure homosexuality through yoga and called it a bad addiction. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad's vice-president Om Prakash Singhal said, \\"This is a right decision, we welcome it. Homosexuality is against Indian culture, against nature, and against science. We are regressing, going back to when we were almost like animals. The SC had protected our culture.\\" Singhal further dismissed HIV/AIDS concerns within the LGBT community saying, \\"It is understood that when you try to suppress one anomaly, there will be a break-out of a few more.\\" This, however, is in stark disagreement with many Hindu teachings because Hinduism does not view homosexuality as a religious sin.Gay Histories and Cultures, Routledge, p. 438, George Haggerly Maulana Madni, of an Islamic organization, Jamiat Ulema- e-Hind, has echoed similar sentiments by stating that \\"Homosexuality is a crime according to scriptures and is unnatural. People cannot consider themselves to be exclusive of a society... In a society, a family is made up of a man and a woman, not a woman and a woman, or a man and a man. If these same-sex couples adopt children, the child will grow up with a skewed version of a family. Society will disintegrate. If we are to look at countries in the West who have allowed same-sex marriages, you will find the mental tensions they suffer from.\\" Rabbi Ezekiel Isaac Malekar, honorary secretary of the Judah Hyam Synagogue, in upholding the judgement, was also quoted as saying \\"In Judaism, our scriptures do not permit homosexuality.\\" Reverend Paul Swarup of the Cathedral Church of the Redemption in Delhi in stating his views on what he believes to be the unnaturalness of homosexuality, stated \\"Spiritually, human sexual relations are identified as those shared by a man and a woman. The Supreme Court's view is an endorsement of our scriptures.\\" Pride parades In 2005, Prince Manvendra Singh Gohil, who hails from Rajpipla in the Gujarat, publicly came out as gay. He was quickly anointed by the Indian and the world media as the first openly gay royal. He was disinherited as an immediate reaction by the royal family, though they eventually reconciled. He appeared on the American talk show The Oprah Winfrey Show on 24 October 2007, and on BBC Three's Undercover Princes. In 2008, Zoltan Parag, a competitor at the Mr. Gay International contest said that he was apprehensive about returning to India. He said, \\"Indian media has exposed me so much that now when I call my friends back home, their parents do not let them talk to me\\". On 29 June 2008, five Indian cities (Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata, Indore and Pondicherry) celebrated gay pride parades. About 2,000 people turned out in these nationwide parades. Mumbai held its pride march on 16 August 2008, with Bollywood actress Celina Jaitley flagged off the festivities. On 4 July 2008, the Delhi High Court, while hearing the case to decriminalise homosexuality, opined that there was nothing unusual in holding a gay rally, something which is common outside India. Days after the 2 July 2009 Delhi High Court verdict legalising homosexuality, Pink Pages, India's first online LGBT magazine was released. On 16 April 2009, India's first gay magazine Bombay Dost originally launched in 1990, was re-launched by Celina Jaitley in Mumbai. On 27 June 2009, Bhubaneswar, the capital city of Odisha, saw its first gay pride parade. A day later, Union Law Minister Veerappa Moily announced that the Union Home Minister has convened a meeting with the Union Law Ministers, Union Health Ministers and Home Ministers of all states to evolve a consensus on decriminalising homosexuality in India. On 28 June 2009, Delhi and Bangalore held their second gay pride parades, and Chennai, generally considered to be a very conservative city, held its first. Mumbai has one of its own pride events, like Kashish Mumbai Queer Film Festival which was first held in 2010 from 22 to 25 April and in the next year 2011 from 25 to 29 May. It was the first queer film festival in India and is held in a mainstream multiplex theater which screens LGBT films from all over the world. It has been recognised by Interpride as a pride event in India. Asia's first Genderqueer Pride Parade at Madurai with Anjali Gopalan and Gopi Shankar Madurai Madurai celebrated city's first LGBTQ Rainbow festival on 29 July 2012, Anjali Gopalan inaugurated Alan Turing Rainbow festival and flagged off the Asia's first Gender queer pride parade as a part of Turing Rainbow festival organised by Srishti Madurai, a literary and resource circle for alternative gender and sexualities. It was established by Gopi Shankar a student of The American College in Madurai to eradicate social discrimination faced by the LGBT and Genderqueer community. The objective of the organisation in to highlight 20 different types of Genders. On 1 May 2011, Kolkata Rainbow Pride Festival (KRPF) was formed to take the initiative of organising Pride Walk in Kolkata. Since then the initiative of Queer Pride Parade in Kolkata is being taken by KRPF. The 11th Kolkata Rainbow Pride Walk, held on 15 July 2012, was attended by more than 1500 people. Kolkata hosted South Asia's first pride walk in 1999. Chandigarh held its first LGBT pride parade on 15 March 2013 and it has been held annually ever since. The first LGBT pride parade in Gujarat state was held at Surat on 6 October 2013. Rajasthan witnessed its first pride event on 1 March 2015, when a pride walk was held in Jaipur. Awadh witnessed the first Awadh Pride parade in 2017. In 2013, India was represented by Nolan Lewis, a model, at the Mr Gay World 2013 contest. He had trouble finding sponsors. Previously, India had been represented at the Mr Gay World by Zoltan Parag Bhaindarkar in 2008. He did not return to India and reportedly sought asylum in the United States. Sushant Divgikar, the winner of Mr Gay India 2014, was a contestant on the Bigg Boss reality show. On 26 July 2014, at Kochi the 5th All-Kerala Queer Pride Parade was held. It was organised by Queerala (a support group for the LGBT community) and Sahayathrika (a rights organisation for lesbian and bisexual women in Kerala). In June 2016, a platform named Amour Queer Dating is launched in India, to help queer/LGBTIQ people find long term companions. Recognition of same-sex couples In February 2017, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare unveiled resource material relating to health issues to be used as a part of a nationwide adolescent peer-education plan called Saathiya. Among other subjects, the material discusses homosexuality. The material states, \\"Yes, adolescents frequently fall in love. They can feel attraction for a friend or any individual of the same or opposite sex. It is normal to have special feelings for someone. It is important for adolescents to understand that such relationships are based on mutual consent, trust, transparency, and respect. It is alright to talk about such feelings to the person for whom you have them but always in a respectful manner.\\" See also * LGBT culture in India * :Category:LGBT people from India * Hijra (South Asia) * Kothi (gender) Organisations: * Trikone Religious views: * LGBT topics and Hinduism * LGBT themes in Hindu mythology * Buddhism and sexual orientation * Sikhism and sexual orientation * Zoroastrianism and sexual orientation * LGBT in Islam * Christianity and homosexuality * Homosexuality and the Bahá'í Faith Media: * The World of Homosexuals by Shakuntala Devi the \\"Human Computer\\", 1977 * Pink Pages, India's National LGBT magazine * Gaylaxy * Fire Related: * Sexuality in India * Male sexuality * Human rights in India Notes References  *Paola Bacchetta. \\"Queer Formations in (Hindu) Nationalism.\\" In Sexuality Studies, edited by Sanjay Srivasta, 121–140.

The gens Pompeia was a plebeian family at ancient Rome, first appearing in history during the second century BC, and frequently occupying the highest offices of the Roman state from then until imperial times. The first of the Pompeii to obtain the consulship was Quintus Pompeius in 141 BC, but by far the most illustrious of the gens was Gnaeus Pompeius, surnamed Magnus, a distinguished general under the dictator Sulla, who became a member of the First Triumvirate, together with Caesar and Crassus. After the death of Crassus, the rivalry between Caesar and Pompeius led to the Civil War, one of the defining events of the final years of the Roman Republic.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 473 (\\"Pompeia Gens\\"). Origin The nomen Pompeius (frequently anglicized as Pompey) is generally believed to be derived from the Oscan praenomen Pompo, equivalent to the Latin Quintus, and thus a patronymic surname. The gentilicia Pompilius and Pomponius, with which Pompeius is frequently confounded, were also derived from Pompo. The gentile-forming suffix ' was typical of Sabine families, suggesting that the Pompeii were of Sabine or Oscan extraction.Chase, pp. 119, 121. Cicero describes Quintus Pompeius, the consul of 141 BC, as a man of \\"humble and obscure origin\\".Cicero, In Verrem, v. 70, Pro Murena, 7, Brutus 25, quotation from the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology. Chase posits an alternative etymology: that Pompeius and similar names were instead derived from pompa, a procession, or a derived cognomen Pompo, meaning not \\"fifth\\", but a participant in a procession; but he concludes that all of these hypotheses are uncertain. Praenomina The main praenomina of the Pompeii were Gnaeus, Quintus, and Sextus, each of which was used by the two main branches of the family under the Republic, as well as by other members. Individual families made use of Aulus and Marcus. All of these were common names throughout Roman history. A few Pompeii not associated with any of the major families of this gens used other praenomina. Branches and cognomina According to Velleius Paterculus, the Pompeii of the Republic were divided into two or three distinct families, of which two can be reconstructed with a high degree of probability. How they were related is not known. They used almost entirely different sets of praenomina, which was unusual, since as a rule certain ancestral praenomina would be used by all of the branches of a gens, although others might be unique to individual stirpes.Velleius Paterculus, ii. 21.Drumann, Geschichte Roms, pp. 306 ff. Denarius of Sextus Pompeius, paternal grandfather of Pompey the Great. The first branch to appear at Rome acquired the surname Rufus, signifying someone with red hair,Chase, p. 110. but it was only passed down through one line. The surname Bithynicus is also thought to have belonged to a branch of this family, although it is not certain how the name, a reference to Bithynia, was acquired, or precisely when. The other branch, which played a conspicuous role in the final decades of the Republic and under the early Empire, mainly used personal cognomina, such as Strabo, Magnus, Pius, and Faustulus. Strabo, referring to someone with a pronounced squint,Chase, p. 109. belonged to the father of the triumvir, and is said to have been the nickname of his cook, whose proper name was Menogenes; but it then became a nickname of Pompeius, because he resembled the cook.Pliny the Elder, vii. 10. s. 12.Valerius Maximus, ix. 14. § 2. Magnus, or \\"great\\", was originally an epithet of the triumvir, who won renown as a general under Sulla's command, and later on his own; his sons and some of their descendants also used the name to signify their connection to him. Pius, or \\"faithful\\", was assumed by the general's son, Sextus, to signify his filial devotion to pursue vengeance on behalf of his father and brother. Faustulus, found as a surname on the coins of a Sextus Pompeius, presumably a member of the same family, is a diminutive of Faustus, meaning \\"fortunate\\" or \\"lucky\\".Chase, p. 111. Various surnames were borne by other Pompeii, including a number of freedmen and their descendants, but the majority of the Pompeii who lived in the time of the Republic bore no cognomen.

He secured election through duplicity, and received the province of Hispania Citerior. After suffering several military setbacks, he made a treaty on favourable terms to the Numantines, which he subsequently disavowed. He deftly avoided punishment for this and a charge of extortion made against him, and was censor in 131.Cicero, Brutus, 25, Laelius, 21, Pro Fonteio, 7, De Officiis, iii. 30, De Finibus, ii. 17.Valerius Maximus, viii. 5. § 1, ix. 3. § 7.Appian, Hispanica, 63, 76–79.Livy, Epitome, 54, 59.Orosius, v. 4.Broughton, vol.

A. n., the wife of Gaius Sicinius.Cicero, Brutus, 76. * Aulus Pompeius (Q. f. Q. n.), tribune of the plebs in 102 BC, denounced Battaces, who claimed to be the priest of the Magna Mater at Pessinus, and that the Romans had profaned her temple. Pompeius attempted to prevent him speaking from the rostra, but fell ill from a quinsy, which deprived him of speech; when he died soon thereafter, the people took it as a sign of the Magna Mater's displeasure.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Marius\\", 17.Diodorus Siculus, xxxvi. 13.Broughton, vol. I, p. 568. * Quintus Pompeius Q. f. (Q. n.) Rufus, a fervent partisan of the aristocratic party at Rome, was tribune of the plebs in 99 BC, praetor urbanus in 91, and consul in 88, the year in which civil war broke out between the supporters of Marius and Sulla. After being driven from Rome, he became one of Sulla's generals, but was murdered by the soldiers of Pompeius Strabo, who was unwilling to hand his army over to Rufus.Orosius, v. 17.Cicero, De Oratore, i. 37, Laelius, 1, Pro Cluentio, 5, Brutus, 56, 89.Appian, Bellum Civile, i. 55–57, 63.Velleius Paterculus, ii. 20.Livy, Epitome, 77.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Sulla\\", 8.Broughton, vol.

Rufus, praetor in 63 BC, was sent to Capua in order to prevent a feared rebellion by the slaves of Campania and Apula in support of the conspiracy of Catiline. The following year, he was appointed governor of Africa, with the title of proconsul, and according to Cicero, carried out his office with great integrity.Sallust, Bellum Catilinae, 30.Cicero, Pro Caelio, 30.SIG, 747.Broughton, vol. II, pp. 115, 166, 176, 181, 185, 191. * Pompeia Q. f. Q. n., granddaughter of Sulla, married Julius Caesar in 67 BC. In 62, as wife of the Pontifex Maximus, she hosted the mysteries of the Bona Dea, from which all men were excluded. Publius Clodius entered the house, disguised as a woman, allegedly for the purpose of seducing Pompeia, but was discovered. In the ensuing scandal, Caesar felt compelled to divorce Pompeia.Suetonius, \\"The Life of Caesar\\", 6.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Caesar\\", 5, 10.Cassius Dio, xxxvii. 45.Broughton, vol. II, p. 173. * Quintus Pompeius Q. f. Q. n. Rufus, grandson of Sulla, was tribune of the plebs in 52 BC, and a supporter of the triumvir Pompeius. He stoked feelings of panic at Rome, hoping to drive public support toward the triumvir, preventing the election of magistrates, and leading to a confrontation with the senate, following which the triumvir was appointed consul sine collega. He helped bring about the exile of Titus Annius Milo, but once he left office, Rufus was himself condemned and exiled.Cicero, Epistulae ad Quintum Fratrem, iii. 2. § 3, Epistulae ad Atticum, iv. 16. § 8.Asconius Pedianus, In Ciceronis Pro Milone, passim.Cassius Dio, xl. 45, 49, 55.Valerius Maximus, iv. 2. § 7.Broughton, vol. II, p. 236. * Quintus Pompeius A. f. (Q. n.) Bithynicus, a close friend of Cicero, who describes him as an able orator, but criticizes his delivery.

There, he was slain together with other supporters of Pompeius.Cicero, Brutus, 68, 90.Orosius, vi. 15. * Aulus Pompeius Q. f. A. n. Bithynicus, governor of Sicily at the time of Caesar's death in 44 BC. He wavered in his support of the various factions during the following months, and besought the help of Cicero. He initially opposed Sextus Pompeius' attempt to take possession of Messana, before agreeing to share the government of Sicily; but soon afterward, Sextus betrayed and murdered his cousin.Cicero, Epistulae ad Familiares, vi. 16, 17.Cassius Dio, xlviii. 17, 19.Livy, Epitome, 123.Appian, Bellum Civile, iv. 84, v. 70.Broughton, vol.

Cn. n. Strabo, the father of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus. As consul in 89 BC, during the Social War, he gained a number of important victories and received a triumph. During the civil war between Marius and Sulla, he instigated the murder of his commander, and his own cousin, the consul Quintus Pompeius.

Magnus, also known as \\"Pompey the Great\\", rose to prominence in his youth as one of the generals of Sulla, and distinguished himself in Numidia and Spain, bringing an end to the civil war fought between the allies of Marius and Sulla. He cleared the Mediterranean of pirates, defeated Mithridates, and brought Asia Minor and Syria under Roman control. As members of the First Triumvirate, Pompeius, Caesar, and Crassus divided the Roman world between them. He was consul in 70, 60, 55, and consul sine collega in 52, but his lack of foresight and prudence allowed his defeat by Caesar during the Civil War, in 48 BC.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Pompeius\\".Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol.

Sextus commanded the remaining Pompeian forces in Africa until defeated at the Battle of Thapsus in 46. He avoided capture after the Battle of Munda. After Caesar's murder, he became associated with the republicans, and was proscribed by the new triumvirs. Despite gathering a substantial fleet, he was decisively defeated by Agrippa at the Battle of Naulochus in 36, and fled to the east, where he was captured and put to death.Caesar, De Bello Hispaniensis, 3 ff, 32.Cicero, Epistulae ad Atticum, xii. 37, 44, xiv. 13, 21, 29, xv. 7, 20, 22, xvil. 1, Philippicae, xiii. passim.Appian, Bellum Civile, ii. 105, 122, iii. 4, iv. 84–117, v. 2–143.Cassius Dio, xlvi.–xlix.Velleius Paterculus, ii. 73, 87.Livy, Epitome, 123, 128, 129, 131. * Pompeia Cn. f.

She encouraged her husband to adopt Hadrian, as she had no children of her own, and was honoured by the latter emperor after her death. According to most accounts, she was a woman of exemplary virtue, although Cassius Dio reports an unsavoury rumour concerning the nature of her relationship to Hadrian.Cassius Dio, lxviii. 5, lxix. 1, 10.Pliny the Younger, Panegyricus Trajani, 83, 84.Aurelius Victor, Epitome de Caesaribus, 42, § 21.Aelius Spartianus, \\"The Life of Hadrian\\", 4, 12. * Servius Cornelius Ser. f.

Schorn, p. 437. * Pompeius Probus, appointed consul in AD 310 by the eastern emperors Galerius and Licinius; his authority was not recognized by the western emperors, Maxentius and Constantine. His relationship to the other Pompeii is probably through the maternal line, as he appears to have been a member of the gens Petronia. * Saint Pompeius of Pavia, Bishop of Pavia from AD 339 to 353. The circumstances of his canonization are uncertain, but he is not thought to have been a martyr. His feast day is December 14. * Pompeius, a Latin grammarian, who must have flourished before the fifth century, as he appears to have been a source for Servius and Cassiodorus.

Some universities fill the Residence Hall Director positions with graduate students who are only part time and may be required to complete fewer tasks or are responsible for smaller residential areas. There are also institutions that hire undergraduate students for the position. These students are often overseen by an Area Coordinator or a mid-level student affairs officer.  Responsibilities  The main responsibility of the hall director is the direct supervision of Resident Assistants (RAs). Often carrying out the training of the RAs themselves, Residence Hall Directors meet frequently with their RAs to ensure the residence hall community is healthy and operating smoothly. In addition to meeting and managing the RAs and any other hall staff, Residence Hall Directors frequently (depending on the university) have many of the following responsibilities: *manage the hall secretaries and custodian staff *teach sections of transfer or first-year seminar classes *oversee the judicial process of residence students ranging from fines, behavioral contracts, community service to eviction. *provide counseling to student residents *refer residents to proper campus offices and support services *plan and implement social activities *advise the Hall Council *provide crisis support to parents and students *coordinate emergency/crisis response to the rest of the University *serve as a liaison to university officials and law enforcement personnel *enforce hall behavior codes and meet with students who break policies *general administrative work for the hall *mediate roommate conflicts and oversee room change process. Another aspect of being a Residence Hall Director is that they also tend to live in the hall or a separate adjoining apartment. They also tend to be on call 24 hours a day and are generally called by their RAs if problems arise needing attention.

The first school in Millard was established in the fall of 1870. The school district is named for Ezra Millard (1833-1886), who platted Millard, a mostly uninhabited prairie 12 miles southwest of the city. The former city of Millard was annexed by the City of Omaha in 1971 after a lengthy legal battle. Today the Millard School District has diverse programs such as Nebraska's only K-12 International Baccalaureate program, offered at Millard North High school, Millard North Middle School and Aldrich Elementary. The district also offers the Core Academy and Montessori, as well as many other programs. Thirteen Millard schools have earned the Blue Ribbon Award from the U.S. Department of Education. Kiplinger's Magazine cited the \\"top-rated, nationally recognized\\" Millard School District as one of the reasons Omaha rated No. 3 in the list of the Top 10 Best Cities for 2008.

It was founded in 1897 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. History =1920s and 1930s= Throughout the 1920s, and 1930s the Boston Store was run by Philip Irving Stone. His nephew, Irving Stone, worked as a manager and, beginning in 1927, dated Broadway ingenue and later MGM movie star Jeanette MacDonald for a time. In December 1933, 600 of the store's 1000 employees walked out in a famous White Collar union strike. =Federated and Maus Freres S.A.= Julian Simon's control of Boston Store was sold to Federated Department Stores in 1948 and under Federated, branch stores were opened in several Wisconsin cities including Oshkosh, Sheboygan and Manitowoc. Ownership later passed to the Bergner's chain of Peoria, Illinois in 1985 (itself owned by Switzerland-based Maus Frères S.A., a retail conglomerate controlled by the Maus and Nordmann Families); soon afterward Bergner's relocated its headquarters to Milwaukee. =Acquisitions= As cross-town rival Gimbels was being dismantled in 1986, Boston Store acquired three Gimbel's branches at Southgate Mall, Milwaukee, East Towne Mall, Madison and Mayfair Mall, Wauwatosa. In 1989, P.A. Bergner bought Chicago's Carson Pirie Scott for over $450 million. Carson's itself had just bought Minneapolis-based Donaldson's in November 1987. With this, Bergner's was a major Midwestern presence, with stores in five states: Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, Indiana, and Iowa, operating under the Bergner's, Carson Pirie Scott and Boston Store names. =Bankruptcy and merger with Proffitt's= In 1991, Bergner's filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, with Maus Freres S.A. losing control of the company in a bitter fight. In 1993, the organization emerged from bankruptcy court under the name Carson Pirie Scott & Co, trading under the symbol CPS. Eventually, Proffitt's Inc., now Saks Incorporated, bought Carson Pirie Scott in 1998 and its purchase increased the northern presence of the Saks Incorporated company. =Sale to The Bon-Ton= In July 2005, Saks completed the sale of its Southern Department Store Group consisting of Proffitt's and McRae's to Charlotte, North Carolina-based Belk, Inc. On October 31, 2005, Saks announced that it was selling Boston Store and its other Northern Department Store Group stores (Carson Pirie Scott, Bergner's, Younkers, and Herberger's) to Bon-Ton Stores in a $1.1 billion deal. The transaction was completed on March 6, 2006. Younkers stores in the Milwaukee area were rebranded Boston Stores, simplifying the company's ads to feature one Bon-Ton banner per market. On April 17, 2018, two liquidators, Great American Group and Tiger Capital Group, won an auction for the company, with a bid estimated at $775.5 million. Stores were closed within 10 to 12 weeks. =Resurrection= On September 14, 2018 it was announced that Bostonstore.com had a homepage stating “We’re Back!”. An agreement had been signed the previous week by CSC Generation Holdings to use the rights to Bon-Ton and its subsidiaries. https://fox6now.com/2018/09/14/were-back-boston-stores-website- is-up-and-running-ready-for-shoppers/ On October 1, 2018 The Boston Store was operative online.

The meaning of the word philoi is deeply rooted in the concept of reciprocity; encompassing the exchange of favors and support, in addition to a profound sense of duty to each other.Aristotle and Ross 2005, p. 66 Philoi typically encompassed family members foremost, with the addition of friends or members of society with whom obligations, loyalty or other established ties existed.Osborne 1984  Greek value-system  Within the Greek value-system there was an explicit distinction between friend (philoi) and the enemy (echthroi), and further, a prevalent and constant awareness of both how to treat and one can expect to be treated by each. In fact, every member of society could be classified into three distinct groups: philoi, people one owed obligations to and from whom favors were returned, echthroi, those to whom one was hostile and from whom they expected hostility, and medetoeroi, outsiders who fall under neither category and to whom no one owed anything.Osborne 1984, Section 3.13 Such classifications are rooted in a fundamental belief in the principle of reciprocity, which continually reinforced that the man's duty was to aid his friends and to inflict damage onto his enemies. Further, there was great pride associated with not only helping philoi but also in harming one's echthroi, and the importance of fulfilling these two duties to upload an overarching, strict friend-enemy dichotomy is manifested in a variety of other aspects in Greek life, including literature, theatre and in court.Osborne 1984, Section 3.2  Philoi in court  The importance of the philoi’s role, in particular within a larger cultural system that polarizes the philoi and ekhthroi, is evident in trial processes in Ancient Greek courts. Trials sought to establish a winning and losing party instead of necessarily achieving a balanced, even-handed verdict.Osborne 1984, Section 3.2 Contributing to this was the importance of witnesses in the Athenian courts despite never being cross-examined.Osborne 1984, Section 5.53 Witnesses were oftentimes chosen not by who would be the most impartial, but instead close philoi of those involved. Thus the average Athenian man's dependence on his philoi permeated even trial proceedings and outcomes, and as described by Isaeus in On the Estate of Pyrrhos, “You all know that when we are acting without concealment and need witnesses, we normally make use of our close relatives and intimate friends as witnesses of such actions.”Isaeus 2018, p. 87  Women  With the exception of festivals, women had limited roles outside of the home and therefore had finite opportunities to cultivate reciprocal relationships with their philoi and echthroi in the same way men in Greece did. As a result, the woman's philoi consisted solely of those in her own home.Osborne 1984, Section 3.18  In literature  The practice of reciprocal obligation amongst philoi and overarching strict friend-enemy dichotomy characteristic of Greek value-systems manifest themselves in Homeric heroes such as Agamemnon and Achilles in Homer’s Iliad.Homer and Mueller 2009 The prevalence of warfare in which heroes compete against each other to prove their superiority evidences this dichotomy; that there must be two explicit opposing sides, and both parties must act in accordance to their duty to harm one another, typically in a public display.Osborne 1984, Section 3.5  In philosophy  This definition of philoi is cemented in and often discussed in various philosophical works from this time too, and in particular those of Aristotle. In Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle writes that “to be friends, then, they must be mutually recognized as bearing goodwill and wishing well to each other,”Aristotle and Ross 2005, p. 66. indicating that a philoi is characterized by not necessarily fondness for someone, but a concern for one another that is assuredly reciprocated. He explains that people inherently are fond of those who treat them well or who they believe have the intention, and further, that people usually love those who hate the same people they do, hence the need for philoi on your side, as opposed to the echthroi’s side, who will defend you. Aristotle writes that “friendship is likened to one's love for oneself”Aristotle and Ross 2005, p. 151. but that philoi nonetheless exist “for the sake of some use to be made of him,\\"Aristotle and Ross 2005, p. 152. so they appear to serve both self-serving and altruistic intentions.  Macedonia  In ancient Macedonia, philoi was a title to the royal friends, advisors of the king (basileus). They were the personal choice of the king and they might have come from anywhere in the Greek world. The title became common among the Hellenistic kingdoms. In the Seleucid Empire a number of ranks can be traced; Protoi Philoi, First Friends and Timomenoi Philoi, Honoured Friends organized in various orders. In inscriptions the phrase the King, his Friends and the army signifies their important role.

The greens are traditionally known for being real smooth and fast. The oak and pine trees form tree-lines along the fairways. There are grass and sand bunkers around the greens and on the fairways. There are about four to five bunkers per hole. Water hazards (three ponds) come into play on six holes. The signature hole is #16, a 150-yard, par 3, requiring a tee shot over water to a green that is surrounded by trees and bunkers.Visalia Country Club - Course Profile History On January 27, 1922 a meeting was held in the Visalia Municipal Auditorium for the purposes of organizing a golf club. Mr. Harvey V.E. Gilmer spearheaded the effort. The lack of awareness of the sport at that time made it somewhat of a challenge to arrange the initial subscriptions, but upon collecting twenty-five hundred dollars, property was leased from Dick Hyde. The first membership sold for fifty dollars, and the dues were five dollars per month. The Visalia Golf Club began with three holes, still existing today as numbers 11, 12 and 13. \\"Greens\\" were oiled sand, which needed smoothing before every putt. The tee areas were asphalt slabs. In 1926, six more holes were added and the sand greens were replaced with grass greens. Two years later the original clubhouse was erected. Later in the year, a clubhouse building committee was formed; plans were drawn up & accepted. W.R. Spalding (whose house still stands today in downtown and serves as one of Visalia’s two B&B;’s) donated lumber for the new clubhouse. Members were asked to provide additional donations, and were enthusiastically willing – even non-members donated. The original clubhouse and greens had been constructed for a cost of $6400. The original clubhouse measured 16 feet by 24 feet, and burned to the ground in 1927. It was re-built the same year. In April 1942, during World War II, Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Johnny Weissmuller and an outstanding amateur from Los Angeles, Johnny Dawson, played an exhibition golf match at the club. While no records survive to document the victor of the match, the real winner was the Visalia Chapter of the American Red Cross, to whom the proceeds were donated. The design of the fairways was determined in part by the famous Jennings Ditch which wanders throughout the entire length of the course. In 1950, Mill Creek, which supplied water for the Jennings Ditch, was diverted, leaving a dry ditch which is still visible throughout the course and particularly along the right side of the #9 fairway and the lake between #17 and #18. In that same year, the official name of the club was changed to Visalia Country Club. By 1952, the club added nine more holes to reach the present eighteen. In 1953, a new clubhouse was built at the site of today’s snack bar – the cost of the new clubhouse increased from that of the original to a reported $120,000, and was entirely financed voluntarily by donations from the members. From 1962 until 1965, the club hosted the Visalia Open on the LPGA Tour.Lpga in Northern California -SFGatelpga tournament chronology Many famous women golfers played in the events, including Mickey Wright,Looking back at Mickey Wright Betsy Rawls, Kathy Whitworth, Patty Berg and Judy Rankin.

In freshwater ecology it refers to trees, branches, and other pieces of naturally occurring wood found sunken in rivers and streams; it is also known as coarse woody debris. When used in manufacturing, especially in Scandinavia, they are often called \\"dead wood\\" and in Finland \\"kelo wood\\".  Forest snags  Snags are an important structural component in forest communities, making up 10–20% of all trees present in old-growth tropical, temperate, and boreal forests. Snags and downed coarse woody debris represent a large portion of the woody biomass in a healthy forest. In temperate forests, snags provide critical habitat for more than 100 species of bird and mammal, and snags are often called 'wildlife trees' by foresters. Dead, decaying wood supports a rich community of decomposers like bacteria and fungi, insects, and other invertebrates. These organisms and their consumers, along with the structural complexity of cavities, hollows, and broken tops make snags important habitat for birds, bats, and small mammals, which in turn feed larger mammalian predators.Thomas, Jack W., Ralph G. Anderson, Chris Maser, and Evelyn L. Bull. 1979. Snags. p.60-77. In Wildlife habitats in managed forests the Blue Mountains of Oregon and Washington, USDA Forest Service. Ag. Hand. No. 553, 512p. A coast Douglas-fir snag provides nest cavities for birds Snags are optimal habitat for primary cavity nesters such as woodpeckers which create the majority of cavities used by secondary cavity users in forest ecosystems. Woodpeckers excavate cavities for more than 80 other species and the health of their populations relies on snags. Most snag- dependent birds and mammals are insectivorous and represent a major portion of the insectivorous forest fauna, and are important factors in controlling forest insect populations. There are many instances in which birds reduced outbreak populations of forest insects, such as woodpeckers affecting outbreaks of southern hardwood borers and Engelmann spruce beetles. Successional stages of a snag from death of a tree to final decomposition. Snag creation occurs naturally as trees die due to old age, disease, drought, or wildfire. A snag undergoes a series of changes from the time the tree dies until final collapse, and each stage in the decay process has particular value to certain wildlife species.Keen, F. P. 1955. The rate of natural falling of beetle-killed ponderosa pine snags. Journal of Forestry 53(10):720–723. Snag persistence depends on two factors, the size of the stem, and the durability of the wood of the species concerned. The snags of some large conifers, such as Giant Sequoia and Coast Redwood on the Pacific Coast of North America, and the Alerce of Patagonia, can remain intact for 100 years or more, becoming progressively shorter with age, while other snags with rapidly decaying wood, such as aspen and birch, break up and collapse in 2–10 years. Snag Forests, or Complex Early Seral Forests, are ecosystems that occupy potentially forested sites after a stand-replacement disturbance and before re-establishment of a closed-forest canopy. They are generated by natural disturbances such as wildfire or insect outbreaks that reset ecological succession processes and follow a pathway that is influenced by biological legacies (e.g., large live trees and snags downed logs, seed banks, resprout tissue, fungi, and other live and dead biomass) that were not removed during the initial disturbance. Water hunting birds like the osprey or kingfishers can be found near water, perched in a snag tree, or feeding upon their fish catch.  Freshwater snags  In freshwater ecology in Australia and the United States, the term snag is used to refer to the trees, branches and other pieces of naturally occurring wood found in a sunken form in rivers and streams. Such snags have been identified as being critical for shelter and as spawning sites for fish, and are one of the few hard substrates available for biofilm growth supporting aquatic invertebrates in lowland rivers flowing through alluvial flood plains. Snags are important as sites for biofilm growth and for shelter and feeding of aquatic invertebrates in both lowland and upland rivers and streams.A Canada goose feeds near a snag in the Nisqually RiverIn Australia, the role of freshwater snags has been largely ignored until recently, and more than one million snags have been removed from the Murray-Darling basin. Large tracts of the lowland reaches of the Murray-Darling system are now devoid of the snags that native fish like Murray cod require for shelter and breeding. The damage such wholesale snag removal has caused is enormous but difficult to quantify, however some quantification attempts have been made. Most snags in these systems are river red gum snags. As the dense wood of river red gum is almost impervious to rot it is thought that some of the river red gum snags removed in past decades may have been several thousand years old.  Maritime hazard  Also known as deadheads, partially submerged snags posed hazards to early riverboat navigation and commerce. If hit, snags punctured the wooden hulls used in the 19th century and early 20th century. Snags were, in fact, the most commonly encountered hazard, especially in the early years of steamboat travel. In the United States, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers operated \\"snagboats\\" such as the W. T. Preston in the Puget Sound of Washington State and the Montgomery in the rivers of Alabama to pull out and clear snags. Starting in 1824, there were successful efforts to remove snags from the Mississippi and its tributaries. By 1835, a lieutenant reported to the Chief of Engineers that steamboat travel had become much safer, but by the mid-1840s the appropriations for snag removal dried up and snags re-accumulated until after the Civil War.  \\"Dead wood\\" products  \\"Kelo wood\\" (\\"dead wood\\") used in Finland in the manufacture of rustic furniture products. In Scandinavia and Finland snags, invariably pine trees, known in Finnish as kelo and in Swedish as torraka, are collected for the production of different objects, from furniture to entire log houses. Commercial enterprises market them abroad as \\"dead wood\\" or in Finland as \\"kelo wood\\". They have been especially prized for their silver-grey weathered surface in the manufacture of vernacular or national romantic products. The suppliers of \\"dead wood\\" emphasise its age: the wood has developed with dehydration in the dry coldness of the subarctic zones, the tree having stopped growing after some 300–400 years, and the tree has remained upright for another few hundred years. \\"Dead wood\\" logs are easier to transport and handle than normal logs due to their lightness.

F. Green Airport (signed as T. F. Green Airport/Warwick) is a train station and intermodal facility in Warwick, Rhode Island, on the Northeast Corridor, adjacent to T. F. Green Airport. It extends the MBTA Commuter Rail Providence/Stoughton Line from Boston, which previously only went as far as the Providence train station. The station was completed in October 2010 and MBTA service began on December 6, 2010. On November 14, 2011, service expanded to 10 weekday trains in each direction. Trips to and from Boston's South Station take 75 to 90 minutes. The station's primary purpose is to serve local commuters to Providence and Boston, but it will also bring passengers and employees to and from the airport. The station also makes it possible to move between T.F. Green and Logan International Airport in about two hours via subway and commuter rail. Amtrak trains cannot and do not serve the station because the track that serves the single platform is not electrified. Funding was not provided for the necessary track and electrical work, although long- range plans call for this infrastructure to be provided. History 2007 map of South County Commuter Rail service to T.F. Green Airport and Wickford Junction Rush-hour train waiting at the station, January 2011 A state study of rail corridors was completed in 1994 and the Northeast Corridor was designated as the highest-priority line for commuter service to Providence. An addendum in 1995 projected daily ridership from a Warwick station to be 454 in 2000 and 529 in 2020. An operations plan was released in 2001, and environmental assessment was completed in 2003. The station's ceremonial groundbreaking took place on July 17, 2006, but construction was delayed by negotiations with Amtrak over the agreement to allow the MBTA to run commuter trains on Amtrak- owned tracks. Site preparation began in September 2007 and construction began in late 2008 or early 2009. The station was originally scheduled to open in late 2010, and construction was completed on schedule, with the opening ceremony taking place on October 27, 2010. On October 13, 2010, the MBTA and the Rhode Island Department of Transportation signed an agreement enabling MBTA operations to the station to begin on December 6, 2010, initially with 6 inbound and 5 outbound trains each weekday. This service consisted of three peak-hour trains in each direction between T.F. Green and South Station, plus several off-peak shuttles to/from Providence. This was despite earlier concerns that service could be delayed pending completion of the Wickford Junction station and the siding there used to allow trains to reverse directions. However, the siding at T.F. Green was deemed sufficient for operations. In November 2011, service was increased significantly, with mid- day service and more rush hour trains. The line was extended 10 miles past T.F. Green with the opening of Wickford Junction station in April 2012. Normal service to T.F. Green Airport is weekday-only, with no regular weekend trains. Beginning on September 16, 2012, special Sunday trains serving New England Patriots games were extended from Providence to T.F. Green Airport. These trains run on game days only to Foxboro, which was not served by regular daily MBTA service. Game-day service was cut back to Providence in the 2019 season. =Ridership= Daily boardings were projected to reach 529 in 2020 by the 1995 analysis; this was halved to 245 in the 2003 Environmental Assessment. In the first quarter of 2012, inbound ridership from the station averaged 149 riders per day, lower than state officials hoped. By July 2012, the count increased to more than 200 daily, even as passenger traffic at the airport decreased. By early 2017, total ridership (boardings plus alightings) was 414. For the second half of 2017, the state offered free intrastate rides, primarily in an attempt to promote the under-utilized Wickford Junction station. The six-month promotion was expected to cost about $102,000. However, a 2018 count had just 227 daily boardings - barely increased from 2012.

Green Although Amtrak owns the tracks through the station, T.F. Green Airport is not a stop on Amtrak's Northeast Regional or Acela Express trains. The station is on a third track built west of the existing two-track Northeast Corridor line, however the new track was not electrified due to lack of funding. All Amtrak trains currently operating on the Northeast Corridor require overhead electric power. Amtrak had requested a separate track for its trains, which was not built, and has also cited a lack of sufficient ridership for the stop to be economically sustainable. This may change with time. Long- term Amtrak plans call for a fourth track (as a second passing siding) with a second platform at the station for intrastate commuter service as well as possible future Amtrak use. The new siding and the current siding would need to have catenary wire extended over them in order for Amtrak trains to stop. In June 2019, a $2.8 million federal grant was awarded to fund preliminary engineering and environmental review work. Currently, connections to Amtrak Northeast Regional and Acela Express trains can be made at Providence station, and to the Lake Shore Limited at South Station and Back Bay in Boston.

Early life Bell was born Virginia Miriam Beck in Montrose, California on August 14, 1934.(death certificate) Her parents were John Charles Beck and Freda Yugend. She graduated high school in 1949. She was married a short time to Charles Merle Bell, and then to Eli Jackson, who would go on to produce some of her earliest movies. Career Two Bells for Virginia Bell began her career in burlesque at age 22. By the 1950s, Bell began posing for men's magazines. Virginia had one starring role in a feature film, Bell, Bare and Beautiful (1963), which was the product of legendary sexploitation team of Herschell Gordon Lewis and David Friedman. It was made to fulfill a request by her husband, Eli Jackson. In it, Virginia plays a burlesque dancer pursued by Lewis regular Thomas Wood. But his attempts at finding true love with the \\"girl of his dreams\\" are thwarted by her gangster boyfriend (played by David Friedman). Wood gets around this speedbump by tracking Virginia down at the nudist camp she frequents, which is where at least half the film takes place. Virginia would make another appearance in Lullaby of Bareland (1964), a series of three shorter segments spliced together to flesh out the runtime. Virginia's contribution is a lengthy striptease routine. Aside from feature films, Virginia appeared in many nudie loops, which can be found in the video series, \\"Reel Classics\\", and in the \\"Big Bust Loops\\" and \\"Super Boobs\\" series from Something Weird Video. In the early ‘60s, Bell had three children by her husband Jackson: Pierre Joseph Jackson, b. 1961, Tyrone Eli Jackson b.1962 and Todd George Jackson b. 1964. After she and Eli divorced, she was married to Alexander White until his death in 2004. Later life Bell retired from adult entertainment in the early ‘70s and lived a quiet life until her death on July 19, 2010.

Written by Borden Chase, the film is about a self-minded adventurer who locks horns with an evil, corrupt judge while driving cattle to Dawson, Yukon Territory. It is one of the few Westerns, others include The Spoilers and North to Alaska, to be set in Alaska, although it was not filmed there. This was the fourth western film collaboration between Anthony Mann and James Stewart. Plot In 1896, Jeff Webster (James Stewart) hears of the Klondike gold rush and he and friend Ben Tatem (Walter Brennan) decide to drive a herd of cattle to Dawson City, Yukon. On the way, he annoys self-appointed Judge Gannon (John McIntire) by interrupting a hanging in Skagway, so Gannon unilaterly confiscates his herd. After signing on to assist in taking supplies to Dawson, Jeff and Ben return to town to take the animals back to make them a part of the caravan and take off with Gannon and his men in hot pursuit. After crossing the border into Canada, Jeff uses a few well-placed warning shots to persuade Gannon's gang to give up the chase, but the judge promises to hang Jeff when he returns thru Skagway. When Jeff gets to Dawson, he finds a widespread benign lawlessness, and ignores it as none of his business. He auctions off his herd for $2 per pound ($/lb today) to new arrival Ronda Castle who had hired him, a saloon owner and one of Gannon's business associates, when she outbids Hominy, Grits and Molasses, co- owners of the local hash house. Both Ronda and French-Canadian gamine Renee Vallon are strongly attracted to Jeff. Now looking for their next adventure, Jeff and Ben use $40,000 ($ million today) of their proceeds to buy an existing gold claim, soon doubling their money. Ronda sets up a saloon in partnership with Gannon, who begins cheating the miners out of their claims. Gannon and his gunmen show up to grab their share (and then some), making Dawson much more dangerous. Jeff stays out of it, instead planning to sneak out by river while Gannon is otherwise occupied. However, Gannon is tipped off when Ben buys extra coffee for the long trip; his men kill Ben and wound Jeff, finally forcing him to take sides. Jeff calls Gannon out to settle the dispute man to man, but the villain arranges an ambush. Ronda rushes out to warn Jeff and is fatally shot in the back. Jeff kills Gannon in the ensuing gunfight and the rest of his gang agree to leave town, rather than fight all the fed-up longtime residents, who have finally found their courage and have armed themselves to directly face and resist the gang.

Hydroxyl groups are present in many chemical compounds and they must be protected during oxidation, acylation, halogenation, dehydration and other reactions to which they are susceptible. Many kinds of protective groups for hydroxyl groups have been developed and used in organic chemistry, but the number of protective groups for tertiary hydroxyl groups, which are susceptible to acid-catalyzed dehydration, is still small because of their poor reactiveness. They can be easily protected with MTM ethers and recovered in good yield. To introduce an MTM ether to a hydroxyl group, two methods are mainly used. One is a typical Williamson ether synthesis using an MTM halide as an MTM resource and sodium hydride (NaH) as a base. The other is a special method, in which dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and acetic anhydride (Ac2O) are used. In this case, the reaction proceeds with Pummerer rearrangement: MTM ethers have another advantage. They are removed by neutral (but toxic) mercuric chloride, to which most other ethers are stable.

It is a measurement model that has potential application in any context in which the objective is to measure a trait or ability through a process in which responses to items are scored with successive integers. For example, the model is applicable to the use of Likert scales, rating scales, and to educational assessment items for which successively higher integer scores are intended to indicate increasing levels of competence or attainment. Background and overview The polytomous Rasch model was derived by Andrich (1978), subsequent to derivations by Rasch (1961) and Andersen (1977), through resolution of relevant terms of a general form of Rasch's model into threshold and discrimination parameters. When the model was derived, Andrich focused on the use of Likert scales in psychometrics, both for illustrative purposes and to aid in the interpretation of the model. The model is sometimes referred to as the Rating Scale Model when (i) items have the same number of thresholds and (ii) in turn, the difference between any given threshold location and the mean of the threshold locations is equal or uniform across items. This is, however, a potentially misleading name for the model because it is far more general in its application than to so-called rating scales. The model is also sometimes referred to as the Partial Credit Model, particularly when applied in educational contexts. The Partial Credit Model (Masters, 1982) has an identical algebraic form but was derived from a different starting point at a later time, and is interpreted in a somewhat different manner. The Partial Credit Model also allows different thresholds for different items. Although this name for the model is often used, Andrich (2005) provides a detailed analysis of problems associated with elements of Masters' approach, which relate specifically to the type of response process that is compatible with the model, and to empirical situations in which estimates of threshold locations are disordered. These issues are discussed in the elaboration of the model that follows. The model is a general probabilistic measurement model which provides a theoretical foundation for the use of sequential integer scores, in a manner that preserves the distinctive property that defines Rasch models: specifically, total raw scores are sufficient statistics for the parameters of the models. See the main article for the Rasch model for elaboration of this property. In addition to preserving this property, the model permits a stringent empirical test of the hypothesis that response categories represent increasing levels of a latent attribute or trait, hence are ordered. The reason the model provides a basis for testing this hypothesis is that it is empirically possible that thresholds will fail to display their intended ordering. In this more general form of the Rasch model for dichotomous data, the score on a particular item is defined as the count of the number of threshold locations on the latent trait surpassed by the individual. This does not mean that a measurement process entails making such counts in a literal sense; rather, threshold locations on a latent continuum are usually inferred from a matrix of response data through an estimation process such as Conditional Maximum likelihood estimation. In general, the central feature of the measurement process is that individuals are classified into one of a set of contiguous, or adjoining, ordered categories. A response format employed in a given experimental context may achieve this in a number of ways. For example, respondents may choose a category they perceive best captures their level of endorsement of a statement (such as 'strongly agree'), judges may classify persons into categories based on well-defined criteria, or a person may categorise a physical stimulus based on perceived similarity to a set of reference stimuli. The polytomous Rasch model specialises to the model for dichotomous data when responses are classifiable into only two categories. In this special case, the item difficulty and (single) threshold are identical. The concept of a threshold is elaborated on in the following section. The Polytomous Rasch Model First, let : X_{ni} = x \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1,\\\\dots,m_i\\\\\\\\} \\\\, be an integer random variable where m_i is the maximum score for item i. That is, the variable X_{ni} is a random variable that can take on integer values between 0 and a maximum of m_i . In the polytomous Rasch model (Andrich, 1978), the probability of the outcome X_{ni} = x is : \\\\Pr \\\\\\\\{X_{ni}=x, x>0\\\\\\\\} =\\\\frac{\\\\exp{{\\\\sum_{k=1}^x (\\\\beta_n} - {\\\\tau_{ki}})}}{1+ \\\\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} \\\\exp{{\\\\sum_{k=1}^j (\\\\beta_n} - {\\\\tau_{ki}})}} ; : \\\\Pr \\\\\\\\{X_{ni}=0\\\\\\\\} =\\\\frac{1}{1+ \\\\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} \\\\exp{{\\\\sum_{k=1}^j (\\\\beta_n} - {\\\\tau_{ki}})}} where \\\\tau_{ki} is the kth threshold location of item i on a latent continuum, \\\\beta_n is the location of person n on the same continuum, and m_i is the maximum score for item i. These equations are the same as : \\\\Pr \\\\\\\\{X_{ni}=x\\\\\\\\} =\\\\frac{\\\\exp{{\\\\sum_{k=0}^x (\\\\beta_n} - {\\\\tau_{ki}})}}{\\\\sum_{j=0}^{m_i} \\\\exp{{\\\\sum_{k=0}^j (\\\\beta_n} - {\\\\tau_{ki}})}} where the value of \\\\tau_{0i} is chosen for computational convenience that is: \\\\sum_{k=0}^{m_i} (\\\\beta_n - \\\\tau_{ki}) \\\\equiv 0. The Rating Scale Model Similarly, the Rasch \\"Rating Scale\\" model (Andrich, 1978) is : \\\\Pr \\\\\\\\{X_{ni}=x\\\\\\\\} =\\\\frac{\\\\exp{{\\\\sum_{k=0}^x (\\\\beta_n} - ({\\\\delta_i-\\\\tau_{k}}))}}{\\\\sum_{j=0}^m \\\\exp{{\\\\sum_{k=0}^j (\\\\beta_n} - {(\\\\delta_i-\\\\tau_{k}}))}} where \\\\delta_{i} is the difficulty of item i and \\\\tau_{k} is the kth threshold location of the rating scale which is in common to all the items. m is the maximum score and is identical for all the items. \\\\tau_{0} is chosen for computational convenience. Application Applied in a given empirical context, the model can be considered a mathematical hypothesis that the probability of a given outcome is a probabilistic function of these person and item parameters. The graph showing the relation between the probability of a given category as a function of person location is referred to as a Category Probability Curve (CPC). An example of the CPCs for an item with five categories, scored from 0 to 4, is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Rasch category probability curves for an item with five ordered categories A given threshold \\\\tau_{ki} partitions the continuum into regions above and below its location. The threshold corresponds with the location on a latent continuum at which it is equally likely a person will be classified into adjacent categories, and therefore to obtain one of two successive scores. The first threshold of item i, \\\\tau_{1i}, is the location on the continuum at which a person is equally likely to obtain a score of 0 or 1, the second threshold is the location at which a person is equally likely to obtain a score of 1 and 2, and so on. In the example shown in Figure 1, the threshold locations are −1.5, −0.5, 0.5, and 1.5 respectively. Respondents may obtain scores in many different ways. For example, where Likert response formats are employed, Strongly Disagree may be assigned 0, Disagree a 1, Agree a 2, and Strongly Agree a 3. In the context of assessment in educational psychology, successively higher integer scores may be awarded according to explicit criteria or descriptions which characterise increasing levels of attainment in a specific domain, such as reading comprehension. The common and central feature is that some process must result in classification of each individual into one of a set of ordered categories that collectively comprise an assessment item. =Elaboration of the model= In elaborating on features of the model, Andrich (2005) clarifies that its structure entails a simultaneous classification process, which results in a single manifest response, and involves a series of dichotomous latent responses. In addition, the latent dichotomous responses operate within a Guttman structure and associated response space, as is characterised to follow. Let : Y_{nk}=y\\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}, k \\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,1,\\\\dots,m\\\\\\\\} \\\\, be a set of independent dichotomous random variables. Andrich (1978, 2005) shows that the polytomous Rasch model requires that these dichotomous responses conform with a latent Guttman response subspace: : \\\\Omega' \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\dots,1,0,\\\\dots,0\\\\\\\\} in which x ones are followed by m-x zeros. For example, in the case of two thresholds, the permissible patterns in this response subspace are: ::0,0 \\\\Leftrightarrow 0 ::1,0 \\\\Leftrightarrow 1 ::1,1 \\\\Leftrightarrow 2 where the integer score x implied by each pattern (and vice versa) is as shown. The reason this subspace is implied by the model is as follows. Let : P_{nxi} =\\\\frac{\\\\exp({\\\\beta_n} - {\\\\tau_{ki}})}{1 + \\\\exp({\\\\beta_n} - {\\\\tau_{ki}})},\\\\ k=x,\\\\, be the probability that Y_{nki}=1 and let Q_{nxi}=1-P_{nxi}. This function has the structure of the Rasch model for dichotomous data. Next, consider the following conditional probability in the case two thresholds: : \\\\frac{P_{n1}Q_{n2}}{Q_{n1}Q_{n2}+P_{n1}Q_{n2}+P_{n1}P_{n2}} . It can be shown that this conditional probability is equal to : \\\\frac{\\\\exp{{\\\\sum_{k=1}^1 (\\\\beta_n} - {\\\\tau_{k}})}}{1+ \\\\sum_{j=1}^2 \\\\exp{{\\\\sum_{k=1}^j (\\\\beta_n} - {\\\\tau_{k}})}} which, in turn, is the probability Pr\\\\\\\\{X_{ni}=1\\\\\\\\} given by the polytomous Rasch model. From the denominator of these equations, it can be seen that the probability in this example is conditional on response patterns of \\\\\\\\{0,0\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{1,0\\\\\\\\}, or \\\\\\\\{1,1\\\\\\\\}. It is therefore evident that in general, the response subspace \\\\Omega', as defined earlier, is intrinsic to the structure of the polytomous Rasch model. This restriction on the subspace is necessary to the justification for integer scoring of responses: i.e. such that the score is simply the count of ordered thresholds surpassed. Andrich (1978) showed that equal discrimination at each of the thresholds is also necessary to this justification. In the polytomous Rasch model, a score of x on a given item implies that an individual has simultaneously surpassed x thresholds below a certain region on the continuum, and failed to surpass the remaining m − x thresholds above that region. In order for this to be possible, the thresholds must be in their natural order, as shown in the example of Figure 1. Disordered threshold estimates indicate a failure to construct an assessment context in which classifications represented by successive scores reflect increasing levels of the latent trait. For example, consider a situation in which there are two thresholds, and in which the estimate of the second threshold is lower on the continuum than the estimate of the first threshold. If the locations are taken literally, classification of a person into category 1 implies that the person's location simultaneously surpasses the second threshold but fails to surpass the first threshold. In turn, this implies a response pattern {0,1}, a pattern which does not belong to the subspace of patterns that is intrinsic to the structure of the model, as described above. When threshold estimates are disordered, the estimates cannot therefore be taken literally; rather the disordering, in itself, inherently indicates that the classifications do not satisfy criteria that must logically be satisfied in order to justify the use of successive integer scores as a basis for measurement. To emphasise this point, Andrich (2005) uses an example in which grades of fail, pass, credit, and distinction are awarded. These grades, or classifications, are usually intended to represent increasing levels of attainment. Consider a person A, whose location on the latent continuum is at the threshold between regions on the continuum at which a pass and credit are most likely to be awarded. Consider also another person B, whose location is at the threshold between the regions at which a credit and distinction are most likely to be awarded. In the example considered by Andrich (2005, p. 25), disordered thresholds would, if taken literally, imply that the location of person A (at the pass/credit threshold) is higher than that of person B (at the credit/distinction threshold). That is, taken literally, the disordered threshold locations would imply that a person would need to demonstrate a higher level of attainment to be at the pass/credit threshold than would be needed to be at the credit/distinction threshold. Clearly, this disagrees with the intent of such a grading system. The disordering of the thresholds would, therefore, indicate that the manner in which grades are being awarded is not in agreement with the intention of the grading system. That is, the disordering would indicate that the hypothesis implicit in the grading system - that grades represent ordered classifications of increasing performance - is not substantiated by the structure of the empirical data.

Released in Japan in 1997, the game was ported to the PlayStation in 1999, with an English version of the game appearing on the platform in North America in the following September by Sony Computer Entertainment, and in Europe in 2000 by Ubi Soft. The game was produced by much of the same staff who worked on the company's previous role-playing endeavor, the Lunar series, including producer Yoichi Miyagi and composer Noriyuki Iwadare. Grandia is notable for its combat mechanics which have been carried over to future games within the franchise, and has spawned an expansion disk (Grandia: Digital Museum) and a spin-off title (Grandia: Parallel Trippers) - both released exclusively in Japan. In celebration of the announcement of renewing development on Grandia Online, which acts as a prequel to Grandia, the game was re-released on Sony's PlayStation Network platform in Japan as a downloadable title on April 22, 2009 and in North America on February 25, 2010. It was re-released in Europe on November 10, 2010. A high-definition remaster of the game was released in North America and Europe on August 16, 2019, together with Grandia II, for Nintendo Switch; a Windows PC version was released on October 15, 2019.http://uk.ign.com/articles/2018/08/20/grandia-and-grandia-ii-coming-to- switch-in-hd-remaster GungHo Online Entertainment clarified that a Japanese release of the remasters will follow in the future.https://twitter.com/GA_Express/status/1161060231729672192 GungHo Online Entertainment announced Grandia HD Remaster along with Grandia II HD Remaster on PlayStation 4. The game is set in a fantasy world of emerging technology and exploration. A young boy named Justin inherits a magic stone that leads him on a journey around the world to uncover the mystery of a long-lost civilization. Along the way, he meets other adventurers who join him on his quest, which draws the attention of the militaristic Garlyle Forces who seek to uncover the secrets of the past as well. Grandia received a largely positive critical response during its original release, and was voted by readers of the Japanese magazine Famitsu as the 73rd greatest game of all time in a 2006 poll. Gameplay Grandia's environments are depicted as three- dimensional maps, with characters represented by 2-D animated bitmap sprites. The camera is fully rotational and follows the party from an angled third- person perspective; it is often necessary to rotate the camera in order to see hidden items or passageways. Grandia features a rotational party roster. The statistics of each party member increase each time they gain a new level by defeating enemies and earning experience points. Characters learn new abilities through the repeated use of weapons and spells. Once a particular weapon/magic spell is used a number of times in battle, its Skill Level is raised. Weapons are divided into different classes, including swords, maces, axes, whips and knives. Each party member's potential abilities are listed on a Skill screen within the game's main menu, as well as the Skill requirements that must be met in order to learn them. The game encourages players to periodically switch between weapons. When a weapon or magic element levels up, permanent stat points are added to that character as well. For example, when a character's water skill levels up, they also receive +1 HP as well as +2 MP. Monsters in Grandia are visible on the field and wander around aimlessly until the party gets close. A battle begins once the monster touches a party member. If the player manages to sneak up on the enemy and make contact from the rear, they gain a preemptive strike and attack first. Likewise, if an enemy touches a party member from behind, they get the first strike. Combat is shown from a third-person overhead view. The IP bar at the bottom right corner of the screen displays a row of icons, which represent all party members and enemies on the screen. When an icon drifts to the midpoint of the IP Bar, that character can choose their next action. The IP Bar also shows the time it takes for enemies to attack; if the party manages to land a strike during the period where an enemy is preparing an attack, that enemy's attack is canceled. Plot =Characters= The extended cast of Grandia, including main and supporting characters. The story centers around , an aspiring adventurer from Parm. He lives with his mother, , in their home in the upstairs floor of their family-owned restaurant. Justin's father vanished years ago on an adventure, and his mother is worried that he will try to follow in her late husband's footsteps, yet Justin, a romanticist, insists that there are still uncharted parts of the world, despite general perception that the \\"End of the World\\" -- an insurmountable stone wall found on a newly discovered continent -- has closed the book on the age of adventuring. Other characters include , a friend from his town who acts as a surrogate sister to Justin; , a seasoned adventurer and Justin's idol; , a valiant knight who mentors Justin in the way of swordsmanship; , an ill-mannered youth from the village of Cafu; , a feral giantess who, despite her volatile nature, has a sweet side, particularly for her husband; , a traveling salesman and chieftain of a diminutive, rabbit-like clan called the Mogay; and , a mysterious woman who contacts Justin inside the Sult Ruins. She resides in an ancient space station and serves as a living database of an ancient civilization. The game's main antagonist is General , the calculating leader of the Garlyle Forces. Despite appearing to be involved in the excavation of ruins for purely philanthropic reasons, he has his own agenda. His son and second-in-command is Colonel , a tactician who is well liked by his subordinates. Alongside him is his aide-de-camp, , a young soldier who has gained a special place in the military for reasons unknown. , , and are three female commanders who are each assigned their own squadrons. Despite their best efforts, they often bungle important missions, particularly if Justin happens to be involved. Each one of them has a crush on Colonel Mullen and outwardly show their jealousy of Leen as a result. =Story= Grandia is a set in a fantasy world where societies thrive in an era of increasing technological developments following the collapse of the ancient civilization centuries before. General Baal, leader of the militaristic Garlyle Forces, along with his son Colonel Mullen (Murren) and Mullen's love interest Lieutenant Leen, make their way to an archaeological site where treasures of the ancient people are believed to be resting. Justin, a young boy keen on adventure who lives in the port town of Parm just outside the dig site, travels to the area along with his friend Sue to investigate, as well as gather clues about an artifact left by Justin's missing father, the Spirit Stone. Slipping past the Garlyle soldiers into the ruins, Justin finds a holographic device that displays the image of a woman named Liete, who tells him that his stone holds great power, and he must travel far to the east in search of , the ancient city of knowledge, to learn of its true potential. Returning home, Justin avoids his mother and sneaks out to the docks early the next day to board a ship bound for the New World across the ocean while promising to become a great adventurer like his father. Aboard the ship, Justin discovers Sue has stowed away, and meets with another young adventurer named Feena, who joins the two in saving the vessel from a haunted ship that appears in a fog. After a long journey, they arrive in the town of New Parm only to have Feena become kidnapped by the Adventurer Society's President, who wants her as his wife. Stealing her away, the three travel to a nearby ruin where they once again meet Liete deep inside, who tells them that Alent lies further within the New World beyond a massive continent-spanning wall known as \\"The End of the World\\". The Garlyle Forces intercept the three as they travel farther, and question Justin on his ability to manipulate ancient machinery within the ruins. Escaping their capture aboard a military train, the three make their way to a village at the foot of the great wall, where it is revealed that Leen is Feena's long-lost sister. Resolving to continue their journey, the team make their way up the wall, setting up camps along the way before eventually reaching the top, gaining access to the remainder of the continent on the other side. Making their way through a forest, the three meet Gadwin, a beast-man and seasoned knight who sees potential in Justin and leads the three to the ancient Twin Towers in order to contact Liete again. After being intercepted by the Garlyle Forces once again, they make their escape, only for Sue to fall ill as they near another village. Fearing for her safety, Justin obtains a teleportation orb and lets Sue use it to return to Parm and continues onward with Gadwin and Feena to the bounds of the continent and yet another ocean. Justin then defeats Gadwin in a duel, the latter allowing Justin and Feena to have his boat, before leaving the party. Taking Gadwin's ship to another island, Justin and Feena begin to express their feelings for one another. Landing on a beach outside a beast-man village, the two meet Rapp, who asks them to help destroy a nearby tower that is emanating a dark energy and petrifying the land. Finding the tower to be controlled by the Garlyle Forces, the team meets with Milda, a beast-woman, inside and join her in destroying the source of the corruption, which turns out to be a plant-like creature known as \\"Gaia\\" being grown by Garlyle researchers under the orders of General Baal. After destroying the creature and taking a sample of its seeds, Justin is confronted by Leen who steals them back. Moving forward in search of Alent, the party meets a traveling merchant named Guido who leads them to his home town, where he acts as chieftain despite his young appearance, allowing them access to more ruins. It is here that Feena discovers innate magic powers that manifest in the form of wings when she is in trouble, and is promptly captured along with Justin's Spirit Stone by invading Garlyle soldiers and taken aboard Baal's flagship, the Grandeur. Baal reveals to her that he intends to revive a fully powered Gaia using the stone to take over the world and remake it to his own design. Justin, Rapp, and Guido manage to board the Grandeur and engage the Garlyle troops aboard before confronting Baal. Due to the self-destruct mechanism being activated by accident, the ship starts to fall apart, and Guido and Rapp end up getting separated from Justin, leaving him to face Baal alone. The general forces Justin to hand over the Spirit Stone by threatening Feena, but Baal keeps her hostage anyway. Justin therefore is forced to fight Baal, but learns during the fight that the madman had fused with Gaia. He knocks Justin off the burning ship, but Feena breaks free from Baal and dives after Justin. The Grandeur subsequently breaks apart in the air, apparently taking Baal and the Spirit Stone with it. After reuniting, the party finally reaches Alent. Here, Justin meets Liete in person, who reveals to him that his stone is actually an ancient artifact forged by the Icarians, a race of powerful sorcerers who lived during the Angelou era, and was a gift to the humans who lived at the time to use as they pleased to bring prosperity, but when they became corrupted by dark desires, it instead gave birth to Gaia, who nearly destroyed the world. The Icarians sacrificed themselves to save the planet and humanity, and enacted a spell that two of their kind would be born into the world should Gaia ever be revived, destined to also sacrifice themselves to save the world until the next revival in an endless loop. Realizing Feena and Leen are the current revival of the Icarians, Justin sets off to save them from the Gaia- fused Baal, who now faces mutiny among his troops, including his son Mullen. With Gaia proving more than a match for the entire Garlyle army, Leen accepts her destiny and sacrifices herself to lower his defenses. Although Mullen pleads with Feena to finish Gaia, Justin argues that the problem can't be solved with more sacrifice since Gaia will just revive later. Thus Gaia must be defeated outright to end the cycle. Though Gaia defeats the troops and spreads its corruption around the planet, Justin is able to sum up the courage to face the evil with help from his friends, and travels to the underground heart of Gaia itself to destroy it and the Spirit Stone once and for all. With Gaia defeated permanently, the world experiences a new age of peace. Leen is also restored to life with Gaia's destruction. In an epilogue ten years later, Sue, now a teenager, re-unites with Justin and Feena who arrive home after nearly a decade of adventure, with children in tow (although in a tease the older Justin and Feena are not seen). Development Grandia was developed by Game Arts over a period of more than two years beginning after the release of the company's previous role-playing video game title, Lunar: Eternal Blue for the Sega Mega-CD. The project, headed by producer Yoichi Miyaji and directors Takeshi Miyaji and Toshiaki Hontani, was also originally intended for the Mega-CD system, but was shifted to the Saturn early in development due to Sega's abandoning the platform. According to a spokesman for Game Arts, Grandia was created as part of the company's on-going effort to \\"provide consumers with good games rather than try to follow market trends\\", opting instead to create a product that would tell a compelling story catering primarily to their existing fanbase. The Saturn version was released in December 1997 exclusively in Japan, along with a special Limited Edition for those who pre-ordered the game between October 25 and November 30, 1997, which included a fold-out cloth map of the Grandia world, as well as a mini radio drama disc featuring voiced scenes from the game. In November 1998, Grandia was re-released in Japan as the Grandia Memorial Package, which featured new instruction booklet artwork and a lower sales price. Sega of America had commented that they had no plans to bring an English version of the game to North American audiences on their system, which prompted an online petition originating on the role-playing game fansite LunarNET designed to alert the company of consumer interest. Despite gathering several hundred signatures in only a few days, as well as promotion from gaming website GameSpot, the Saturn version was never released internationally. Telecom Animation Film, AIC, Gonzo, Production I.G, and Studio Junio both helped helped animate the game by being animation support, and the CG support. In March 1999, Game Art's Japanese publisher ESP Software showcased a PlayStation version of Grandia at that year's Tokyo Game Show expo, along with confirmation that the game would be released in English for the first time in North America by Sony Computer Entertainment America. Working Designs, which had previously worked with Game Arts on bringing their Lunar games to the region, had expressed interest in publishing the game, but were ultimately unable to secure the rights. New features for the PlayStation version included support for the system's DualShock analog control sticks and vibration function, as well as compatibility with Sony's Japanese-only PocketStation peripheral, which allows players to download game data on a portable device for use in a special mini- game. Although the company had expressed interest in bringing the game to the PlayStation as early as 1998, technical problems originally prevented the title from being ported to the system. Game Arts was later able to release the game with a slight loss in frame rate and a marginal decrease in video effects the following June. The North American version was originally announced by Sony as a summer release during the 1999 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, but was pushed back to the following October. Grandia was later released for the PlayStation in Europe in 2000 by Ubisoft. Nearly ten years after Grandias release on the PlayStation, Game Arts announced in April 2009 that the game would be released as a downloadable title on Sony's PlayStation Network service in Japan in celebration of the resuming development on the company's long-dormant Grandia Online project. =Audio= { class=\\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"clear:none; float:right; font-size:90%; margin:5px; width:25%;\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"background:#d1dbdf;\\" Voice actors - ! style=\\"width:10%;\\" Character ! style=\\"width:10%;\\" Japanese ! style=\\"width:10%;\\" English - style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Justin  Fujiko Takimoto  Snazin Smith - style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Feena  Noriko Hidaka  Angela Anderson - style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Sue  Kumiko Nishihara  Blaney R.

Iwadare was called upon to write the music due to his relationship with the company, and claims that his work on Grandia was \\"a turning point in my career\\", and described the music-making process as \\"very interesting\\". Grandias sound team utilized the latest technology available at the time to create the game's background themes, included the game's main theme, \\"Theme of Grandia\\", which was composed by Iwadare in just one night after looking at an illustration for the game. The music was recorded at Skywalker Sound with producer Tom Meyers. In addition to music, the game features voice acting during battles and certain story scenes, with the Japanese version featuring a number of anime and video game veteran actors. Two of the English version's main characters, Justin and Gadwin, were officially left uncredited. \\"It's the End\\" by Japanese rock group L'Arc-en-Ciel, from the band's 1999 Album Ray, was used as the game's official commercial theme song during its re-release on the PlayStation. In December 1997, selected music tracks from the game were released in Japan on the Grandia Original Soundtrack by King Records across two discs, which were organized as \\"Orchestra Side\\" and \\"Synth Side\\" according to the type of instrument samples used to compose them. A follow-up album, Grandia Original Soundtrack II, was made available in June 1998, containing an additional two discs of music not featured on the previous album. One year later, in June 1999, a compilation album entitled The Best of Grandia was released by Twofive Records containing some of Iwadare's favorite music from the game, including a never-before released track, \\"Pavane\\". Iwadare also produced a special arranged album called Vent: Grandia Arrange Version, with \\"vent\\" () being the French word for \\"wind\\", which Iwadare chose because it \\"carries the image of cool pleasant wind\\". The album was released in February 1998 by King Records and contains 12 arranged tracks, which Iwadare designed to be \\"an album, which people would listen at leisure on Sunday mornings\\". Reception =Saturn version= Grandia received near-universal acclaim during its original release in Japan, garnering a 9 out of 10 from both Sega Saturn Magazine and Saturn Fan, as well as an 8.75 out of 10 from Weekly TV Gamer. Weekly Famitsu granted the game a 32 out of 40, earning it an editor's choice Gold Award. Despite not being released outside Japan, GameSpot covered the Saturn version in a 1998 import review, claiming that Grandia \\"beats out Final Fantasy VII in all of the ways that matter,\\" adding that the game was \\"not only longer, with a more engaging cast of characters, but it lacks the lulls that so many RPGs have because of these merits,\\" awarding the game an Editor's Choice Award. Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine called the game \\"arguably the best RPG for Sega's Saturn console.\\" The game earned an \\"Excellence Award\\" during the 1997 CESA Japan Game Awards as runner-up for game of the year. Next Generation reviewed the Saturn version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Grandia's design and innovation will be a benchmark for future RPGs in the 32-bit generation and beyond.\\" It sold 181,219 units in its first week and would go on to sell 344,554 copies in Japan, becoming the 15th highest-selling game for the system in the region and the country's fourth highest-selling Saturn title of 1997. In addition, North American imports of the game were higher than many other games in the genre at the time due to its positive overseas reception and cancellation of the English release on the platform. In 2006, readers of Famitsu voted the Saturn version the 73rd greatest game of all time during the magazine's Top 100 Favorite Games of All Time feature. =PlayStation version= The PlayStation version of Grandia met with similarly positive reception to the Saturn release, though sales remained lower than the original in Japan, selling approximately 97,460 copies in its first three weeks. It received an aggregate score of 86% on GameRankings and 89/100 on Metacritic. Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine named it as one of the \\"25 Games You Must Play in 1999\\", praising the title's colorful presentation and \\"innovative battle system\\" and \\"elegant character advancement system\\", yet found the game's English voice acting to be \\"depressingly awkward\\". GameSpot once again compared Grandia to Square's popular Final Fantasy series, calling it \\"every bit as worthwhile as Final Fantasy VIII, just in different ways,\\" calling attention to its sound quality that is \\"as complete and detailed as it visuals\\", but finding fault in the game's translation and voice work that was declared \\"inexcusable by today's standards.\\" GamePro magazine felt that the game had aged during its two-year transition to the PlayStation, but that the game's presentation was still \\"amazingly detailed and well designed.\\" The publication would cite the game's music as its major downfall, calling it \\"repetitive and annoying and will have the player reaching for the volume control\\", as well as the relatively low detail on enemy monsters when compared to the rest of the game, yet ultimately felt that \\"Grandia's puzzles, gorgeous locations, and solid story more than make up for its minor flaws.\\" IGN, conversely, found the game's music to be \\"good\\", yet found its \\"overly simplistic tones and themes\\" to be a turn-off for some, yet adding that \\"you'd be selling the game short if you didn't push through and see the game to conclusion.\\" \\"In 2000, IGN would rank Grandia 17th on its list of the top 25 PlayStation games of all time, calling it \\"Game Arts' magnum opus and probably their most historically significant project.\\" Eurogamer, in a 2007 retrospective, called the game \\"fantastic\\", praising the title's \\"vastly enjoyable battle system which few other games have rivaled, even in recent years\\". Francesca Reyes reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Light-hearted, but incredibly involving, Grandia proves to be worth the wait.\\" Grandia: Digital Museum is an extension of Grandia, developed by Game Arts and published by ESP Software for the Sega Saturn. Released exclusively in Japan in May 1998, the game features character graphics, textures, and music lifted directly from its predecessor. Players can also swap save data between the core Grandia disc and the Digital Museum on the Saturn memory card. The game's story is set sometime after the events of the original Grandia, with the main characters Justin, Feena, and Sue being transported to a large museum created by the sorceress Liete made to honor their adventure during the first game. When most of the exhibits go missing, Liete uses her magic to transport the three to four separate dungeons each containing remnants of their previous journey to find and restore them to their proper place. As players progress through the game, bonus material becomes unlocked in the museum itself, which includes music files, artwork, and movie clips related to Grandia, as well as minigames. =Gameplay= The Museum Itself The following exhibits are found in the four dungeons: *Artwork and storyboards - Several pieces of rare artwork and storyboards. Each one carries a small collection which can be viewed. *Character Portraits - The character portraits that pop up each time a character is speaking. *Sound Theatre - A collection of sound or radio plays featuring the Grandia cast. *Grandia 1 saves - Allows the player to download a save file for use in the full Grandia 1 game. *Bestiary - A library of all the monsters and their characteristics. *Arcade - An arcade with mini-games. Including games such as baseball, archery, an eating competition, and a text- based game. =Reception= Grandia: Digital Museum debuted as the fifth highest-selling game of the week during its launch in Japan, and would go on to sell approximately 32,226 copies in its first month. HD Remaster release Grandia HD Remaster for PC was released on October 15, 2019. The remastered game used original PlayStation code, but combined with the details and effects from the Sega Saturn version to create a definitive version of the game. The remastered game features enhanced details to UI / sprites / texture art, visually enhanced original cinematic videos, widescreen support and customizable resolutions (PC only), Steam Trading Cards / Steam Achievements (PC only), Japanese and English Audio, and new language support (original English and Japanese plus French and German translations), gamepad and keyboard support with remappable controls (PC only). Full Japanese language support along with various fixes were released on March 25, 2020.

It was the fourth episode of the sixth season, originally airing October 4, 1977 and repeated March 6, 1978, and written by Everett Greenbaum and Jim Fritzell and directed by Don Weis. Guest cast is James Cromwell as Capt. Leo Bardonaro, Robert Karnes as Major General Frederick Fox, and John Ashton as an MP. Overview One of B.J.'s old buddies shows up at the 4077th, and is a bigger practical joker than B.J. or Hawkeye. Unfortunately, his joke backfires and B.J. finds himself charged with a crime, so everybody must now undo the joke so they can exonerate B.J. (and Hawkeye and B.J. can get even). Detailed story Colonel Potter receives a telephone call from a colonel at the Provost Marshal's office, informing him that a report has been received that Captain Hunnicutt may have forged his surgeon's credentials. Potter insists that Hunnicutt is a qualified doctor, but the caller persists and informs Potter that he will be coming to the 4077th later that day to make an investigation. Just then Klinger comes in, pretending to be leading a camel. Klinger shows off the \\"camel\\", and after a brief show Potter kicks him out of his office. Potter then goes to the mess tent looking for Hunnicutt, and finds Hawkeye and Father Mulcahy sitting down to a meal. He asks his junior officers Hunnicutt's whereabouts, but they do not know. He then explains the situation to them. Just then, B.J. walks in and overhears the conversation. Potter explains to him that he is being investigated, and Hawkeye jokes that B.J. is actually a spy. Potter then mentions the name of the colonel that called. B.J. recognizes the name instantly—his old college roommate Leo Bardonaro. He explains that Bardonaro is a master practical joker, and that he was simply letting B.J. know that he would be stopping by for a visit later that afternoon. Upon arriving at the camp, Bardonaro is directed to the Swamp. There he is greeted by B.J., who introduces him to Hawkeye. B.J. and Bardonaro reminisce about their old exploits, but soon Bardonaro has to leave, explaining that he has a flight to catch—he's going home! Bardonaro exchanges a cheerful goodbye with the Swampmen, then leaves on his way. Just after he leaves. B.J.'s cigar (which he got from Bardonaro) explodes. (Hawkeye gets \\"zapped\\" with a hand held joy-buzzer.) Later, in Post-Op, B.J. is apprehended by two military policemen. Hawkeye, who is standing nearby, explains that it's just another joke, but the MPs insist on arresting B.J. They walk over to Colonel Potter's office to sort everything out, Hawkeye trying to bribe the MPs along the way. Potter takes a look at the arrest order—it's from Major General Frederick Fox, and it accuses B.J. of \\"willful misconduct\\". Potter allows the MPs to take Hunnicutt to Seoul, and an hour later he follows with Hawkeye, evidence in hand. In his office in Seoul, General Fox accuses Hunnicutt of holding a loud and boisterous party in a hotel room next to one he was occupying with his secretary. He also claims that after the party, Hunnicutt grilled steaks on his hotel room balcony, and the smoke filled General Fox's room. Because of the smoke, Fox and his secretary, both naked, were forced to flee their room, interrupting the General's \\"official dictation\\". Potter claims that Hunnicutt was working the night of the alleged incident, and offers the duty logs of that night in support of his claim. Fox claims that the duty logs could have been forged, and presents a copy of the hotel register with what he alleges is Hunnicutt's signature. B.J. argues that the signature is not in his handwriting, and suggests that the register, too, could have been forged. Fox then pulls out a hat, telling B.J. that he must have left it behind in his hurry to leave the hotel. B.J. says the hat is not his and, at General Fox's insistence, puts it on. It is several sizes too large. Exonerated, B.J. leaves for the 4077th with Potter and Hawkeye. In celebration of their victory \\"against the brass\\", all three (including Hawkeye, who is driving) drink wildly and curse Bardonaro. Hawkeye mentions that he'd like to get back at Bardonaro, and B.J. says he'll have a chance soon enough—he had swiped Bardonaro's travel orders just before he left the Swamp. The three return to the camp completely drunk, and they go their separate ways. Colonel Potter finds Klinger and tells him he brought a discharge for the camel, and Hawkeye and B.J. return to the Swamp to find Bardonaro sitting, waiting for them. Bardonaro begs B.J. for his travel orders, and B.J. finally relents after making Bardonaro promise to stop the childish practical jokes. Bardonaro agrees, and as he heads out the door he remembers that he has no way to get to Kimpo Air Base. B.J. suggests that they use the Jeep he and Hawkeye just returned in, telling him that it's \\"all gassed up\\". Bardonaro thanks him and rushes out of the Swamp. Soon after he leaves, Radar comes in with an envelope for B.J. B.J. opens it and finds it's a bill for $580.00 from the hotel in Seoul for damages. He laughs and explains to Hawkeye that Bardonaro will be walking back in half an hour. Hawkeye is confused by this, so B.J. informs him that \\"the only thing gassed up in that Jeep was us!\\" A subplot is Margaret Houlihan nearly going crazy about getting in touch with her husband Donald Penobscot.

Mount Lyell has an elevation of above sea level. The adjacent mountains are Mount Sedgwick to the north and Mount Owen to the south. The mountain was named by Charles Gould in 1863 after geologist Charles Lyell, a supporter of Charles Darwin. Mount Lyell was also the common short name of the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company. Mining activity The Mount Lyell company operations centred mainly on the shoulder between Mount Owen and Mount Lyell, and to the western side of the mountain. On the eastern side of the shoulder were the old North Mount Lyell workings, where the 1912 North Mount Lyell Disaster occurred. There was a small operation in the early days of the mining operation that was on the northern side of Mount Lyell, known as the Comstock mine. In the late twentieth century, just west of the Comstock workings was a section of the mine known as Cape Horn. The western end of the mountain has been named Cape Horn Spur, as the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company had a mine called Cape Horn in the 1970s at the west end of this spur. Railway lines A railway line was planned to travel from Linda in the Linda Valley, around the southern, eastern and northern sides of Mount Lyell. The formation was built but the line was never utilised. The sides of the mountain have been subjected to bush fires, smelter fumes and high rainfall, consequently the resultant vegetation and the legacy of tree stumps give the southern sides of the mountain a unique appearance.

The district's current boundaries were redrawn in February 2016 after a U.S. District Court overturned the existing boundaries because of politically directed gerrymandering that suppressed minority representation. The new congressional district consists of Union, Anson, Richmond, Scotland, and Robeson counties; a southeast portion of Mecklenburg County; and parts of Cumberland and Bladen counties. Republicans have held this district since 1963. Republican Robert Pittenger had represented the district since January 2013. In 2018, Pittenger was defeated by challenger Mark Harris in the Republican primary. The latter faced Democrat Dan McCready in the general election. Harris was initially called as the winner by several hundred votes, but the result was not certified, pending a statewide investigation into allegations of absentee ballot fraud. On February 21, the bipartisan State Election Board unanimously voted to call for a new election for the 9th district, because of ballot fraud by Republican operatives. A special election was held September 10, 2019, with Democrat Dan McCready running against Republican Dan Bishop, a state senator who won the Republican primary. Bishop won the 2019 special election to the U.S. House of Representatives with 50.7% of the vote to McCready's 48.7%.Live results: North Carolina elections, Politico, September 10, 2019.Republican Dan Bishop wins special election for House seat in North Carolina special election, NBC News projects, NBC News, September 10, 2019.

Harris won 48.5 percent of the vote to Pittenger's 46.2 percent. The New York Times described the election between Harris and Democrat Dan McCready as a \\"top-tier contest\\". In results on election day, Harris defeated McCready by 905 votes, but on November 27, 2018, the North Carolina State Board of Elections and Ethics Reform declined to certify the election results, citing voting irregularities involving absentee ballots. The irregularities in counting and handling of absentee ballots became the subject of a criminal investigation. Outlets such as the Associated Press and FiveThirtyEight subsequently retracted calling the race, pending the decision of the state board of elections. On December 1, the chair of the state elections board resigned, saying: \\"The investigation of criminal conduct and absentee voting fraud in the 2018 Republican primary and 2018 general election in congressional district 9 is a matter of vital importance to our democracy\\", adding that \\"I will not allow myself to be used as an instrument of distraction in this investigation\\". On November 30, the election board of the district decided to hear evidence about “claims of numerous irregularities and concerted fraudulent activities” at a meeting to be held by December 21. A finding of fraud could have resulted in a new election. On December 5, 2018, independent investigative reporting of the alleged vote thefts detailed a practice that targeted southern rural elderly black voters in the 9th district congressional race and termed the affair, \\"...the most serious federal election tampering case in years.\\" Campaign workers revealed that the vote tampering went on in a pervasively chaotic atmosphere. Operatives tracked votes and field workers \\"...would come to your house, they would get you to fill out an absentee ballot to be sent to your house. They would go back and pick it up and then seal it and then find two witnesses,\\" to certify their validity. Such handling of ballots and completed applications by other than board and postal workers is legally prohibited. An informant tabulated the number of ballots delivered to the county election board and said an indicted leader gave the Harris campaign updates on the operation's most recent totals. The leader was employed by Red Dome political consultants which received over $428,000 from the Harris campaign. The informant had delivered 185 absentee ballot applications and the leader personally delivered 592 more.Inside The North Carolina Republican Vote Machine: Cash, Pills — And Ballots, Buzzfeed News, Brianna Sacks and Otillia Steadman, December 5, 2018. Retrieved August 5, 2019. On December 6, Democratic candidate McCready withdrew his earlier submitted election concession. Republican candidate Harris agreed for a new election to be held if allegations of election fraud could be proven by the election board to have affected the contest's outcome. The leader of the North Carolina Republicans, Robin Hayes, stated on December 11 that, regardless to what extent election fraud could be proven to have altered the election, a new election would be necessary in the state's 9th congressional district if investigators can verify a local newspaper report that early voting results in Bladen County were leaked before Election Day. On December 28, the state court dissolved the state election board, before it had certified election results. The election board's staff announced that it would continue the investigation, but delayed hearings until a new election board was seated, presumably on January 31. Democratic Governor Roy Cooper's attempts to fill an interim board were overridden by the Republican-controlled legislature. Incoming United States House of Representatives Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Democrat, announced that the House of Representatives would not seat Harris under any circumstances until the fraud investigation is completed. Harris announced he would seek court intervention to have him immediately certified as the winner and stated his intention to join the 116th Congress on January 3. However, Harris was not permitted to join the new Congress on January 3. On February 21, the bipartisan state board of elections voted to hold a new election, because, according to board chairman Bob Cordle, \\"irregularities and improprieties ... tainted the results ... and cast doubt on its fairness.\\" A newly passed law by the North Carolina state legislature will require the parties to hold new primaries before the general election for this seat.  Harris has said that he will not run again.  2019 special election  Democrat Dan McCready, a veteran and business executive, was unopposed as his party's nominee for this seat, following his narrow initial loss to Mark Harris in the election voided because of alleged ballot fraud by Republican operatives. After the Republicans conducted their primary, they nominated Dan Bishop, a North Carolina state senator, to run in the special election to be held in September 2019. On September 10, 2019, Bishop narrowly won the election with 50.7% of the vote to McCready's 48.7%. He was sworn in on September 17, 2019.

It is located in St. John's, on the island of Antigua. The ground has been used by the West Indies cricket team and Antigua and Barbuda national football team. It had Test cricket status.Cricinfo It was also known as the Old Recreation Ground, or the Old Rec. A number of great cricketers, including Andy Roberts and Richie Richardson, began their first-class careers there. One of Antigua's most famous sons, Viv Richards, scored the fastest Test match century off 56 balls against England in the \\"Blackwash\\" series of 1986 at the Recreation Ground. It was also where Brian Lara twice set the record for highest individual Test innings, scoring 375 in 1994 and the current record of 400 not out in 2004, both times against England. In May 2003 the West Indies completed the highest ever successful run chase in Test Cricket at the ARG, making 418/7 against Australia in their fourth innings to win by 3 wickets. Antigua is considered to be a good wicket on which to bat — hard and dry whilst not offering much bounce or movement to bowlers. This is colloquially known as a \\"featherbed\\". After the building of the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium for the 2007 World Cup, no further Test cricket was expected at the Recreation Ground. However, due to the abandonment of the Second Test between West Indies v England on 13 February 2009 after just ten balls (due to an unfit outfield), an extra Test, called the Third Test, began at the Antigua Recreation Ground on 15 February 2009, despite concerns about the dilapidated condition of the stadium. Like many other cricket grounds in the Caribbean, the Antigua Recreation Ground traditionally hosts a variety of off the field entertainment, particularly music, both live and recorded, during breaks in play.

It is native to Southeast Asia, but is regularly kept in butterfly houses around the world. Subspecies There are several subspecies (from Burma, Borneo, Indonesia, Nias and the Philippines). * P. p. palinurus – Burma, Malaysia Borneo * P. p. auffenbergi Späth, 1992 – Simeulue, Indonesia * P. p. nymphodorus (Fruhstorfer) – Island of Basilan * P. p. adventus (Fruhstorfer) – Island of Nias * P. p. daedalus (C. & R. Felder, 1861) – Philippines * P. p. angustatus (Staudinger, 1888) – Island of Palawan, Philippines Etymology The genus name Papilio comes from the Latin word papilio meaning butterfly. The species name palinurus derives from Palinurus, the name of the pilot of Aeneas's boat in Virgil's Aeneid. Description Papilio palinurus has a wingspan reaching about . The dorsal sides of the wings are covered by a powder of green scales and the background vary from dark greenish to black, with broad bright emerald green metallic bands. The undersides are black with orange, white and blue spots along the edges of hindwings, that show extended tails at the end. The flight of these butterflies is swift and quite fast. Caterpillars feed on plants of genus Euodia belonging to the Rutaceae, commonly known as the rue or citrus family. Green by structural coloration The green of Papilio palinurus is created by structural coloration, using special microstructures in the wing scales. The iridescent green sheen of the bands of this butterfly is not produced by pigments, but is structural coloration produced by the microstructure of the wing scales. They refract the light and give rise to blue and yellow visible reflections, producing the perception of green color when additively mixed.Crne, Matija; Vivek Sharma, John Blair, Jung Ok Park, Christopher J.

There is an abundance of parks and gardens close to the CBD with a variety of common and rare plant species amid landscaped vistas, pedestrian pathways, and tree lined avenues. The phrase Victoria – Garden State was used on Victorian car number plates from the 1970s to 1994, and many regional towns have well tended botanic gardens, parks and tree lined avenues. The first superintendent of the Port Phillip region, Charles La Trobe, set aside large tracts of land around the city for open space, parkland and gardens. Much of this land has since been excised for public infrastructure like sporting complexes, railways, hospitals and other public buildings, and also for residential development, but a substantial amount has remained. This allowed landscape designer Clement Hodgkinson and Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne, William Guilfoyle, to landscape many of the parks and gardens. Many of these parks and gardens are within easy walking distance of the central business district. Inner suburbs Carlton Gardens south Late afternoon sunlight on the Fitzroy Gardens Speaker's mound at Speakers' corner, Birrarung Marr Catani Gardens in St Kilda is typical of the many gardens in the bayside area which are often lined with stands of Canary Island Date Palms. Aerial panorama of the Victoria State Rose Garden in Werribee One of Melbourne's oldest parks is Flagstaff Gardens (7.2 ha). Used by office workers at lunchtime, the park contains a memorial to the first Europeans who died in the colony and were buried on the site between 1835 and 1840 when it was the original site of Melbourne Cemetery (later moved). One of the most highly regarded gardens is the Royal Botanic Gardens (35.4 ha) and Kings Domain (36 ha) just across the Yarra River from the central business district. These gardens, originally a swamp, now house a fine collection of botanical species. The Botanic Gardens were established by Superintendent La Trobe in 1846. Its first Curator was John Arthur, a gardener from Heidelberg, who died shortly after. He was succeeded by John Dallachy, who was succeeded by Ferdinand von Mueller. Baron von Mueller was relieved of duties in 1873, and was succeeded by William Guilfoyle, who re-landscaped the gardens extensively and gave them their current form. They are highly prized for their landscaping, with parkland containing lakes, monuments and statues. Queen Elizabeth II granted the title 'Royal' to the Gardens after visiting early in her reign. Walking around the Botanic Gardens there are views of Government House. Kings Domain contains open lawns and stands of both native and exotic trees, which surround Government House, the Shrine of Remembrance and the Sidney Myer Music Bowl. Queen Victoria Gardens (4.8 ha) and Alexandra Gardens (5.2 ha) continue the parkland along St Kilda Road to the banks of the Yarra River. The Pioneer Women's Memorial Garden is also located within Kings Domain. The Carlton Gardens (26 ha) and the Royal Exhibition Building are located to the north of the central business district in the suburb of Carlton and are listed as a World Heritage Site. The gardens contain varied European and Australian tree plantings consisting of deciduous English oaks, White Poplars, Plane trees, Elms, Conifers, Cedars, Turkey Oaks, Araucarias and evergreens such as Moreton Bay Figs, combined with flower beds of annuals and shrubs. At the south end of the gardens, the Melbourne International Flower and Garden Show is held each April, while the Melbourne Museum and Imax theatre are located to the north of the Exhibition Building. A children's playground can be found in the northern gardens. Royal Park (181 ha) is located four kilometres north of the CBD and features sporting ovals, the State Netball Hockey centre, the Royal Melbourne Zoological Gardens and the 2006 Commonwealth Games Athlete's Village was constructed on former hospital grounds that were once also part of Royal Park. The exclusive suburb of Parkville was excised from the parkland, as well as the Royal Melbourne Hospital, the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, and University High School. These sites separate it from neighbouring Princes Park (38.6 ha). To the east of Spring Street and the CBD are the Treasury Gardens (5.8 ha) and the Fitzroy Gardens (26 ha). The Treasury Gardens are a short walk from Victoria's Parliament House and are overlooked by the old Treasury buildings, and State Offices. Due to their central location close to the city, they are a popular spot as the starting or ending point for political rallies, demonstrations and festivals, including the annual May Day march, which has been held there since 1999. Across Lansdowne Street from Treasury Gardens are the Fitzroy Gardens, one of the major Victorian era landscaped gardens in Australia designed by Clement Hodgkinson. Within the gardens are Captain Cook's Cottage, an ornamental lake, kiosk and café, Model Tudor village, the fairy tree, and a tree scarred by the original Wurundjeri inhabitants. Further east of the CBD is Yarra Park (35.469 ha) with the Melbourne Cricket Ground located within its boundaries. Initially the area was used as police paddocks for the agistment of police horses, but by the 1860s five recreational ovals were marked out including the MCG oval. The park features several sculptures of Australian sporting heroes and examples of old eucalypt trees which show scars caused by harvesting of bark for canoes by the original inhabitants of the Yarra River Valley. The park stretches to the northern banks of the Yarra River via Gosh's paddock, but is divided by several railway lines linking Richmond station to Flinders Street Station, Swan Street and Batman Avenue. The Olympic Park stadium, home to the Melbourne Storm in the national rugby league, was once the precinct of the Friendly Society Gardens. The redevelopment of the railway yards and Federation Square allowed for the creation of a new riverside park, Birrurung Marr (8 ha), opened in 2002. Birrarung Marr has been designed to incorporate long lines of sight towards various landmarks, such as the spire at the Victorian Arts Centre and the towers of St Paul's Cathedral. The park incorporates in the south-eastern corner the original speakers mounds of Speakers Corner, the location for Sunday soapbox oratory and public protests and demonstrations up to 1998, when the site was closed for redevelopment. In the suburb of Albert Park, St Vincent Gardens is a park of national significance which provides an example of nineteenth century residential development around a large landscaped square. It was influenced by similar urban design in London, but on such a scale unparalleled in Australia. The Australian Grand Prix is held around the Albert Park Lake on the Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit in Albert Park. This park provides space for the Albert Park Public Golf Course and numerous sporting grounds and ovals. The decision to hold the race there was controversial. A series of protests were organised by the \\"Save Albert Park\\" group in 1995 and 1996, who claimed that the race turned a public park into a private playground for much of the year. Other parks of note in the inner suburbs include Edinburgh Gardens (c. 24 ha) in North Fitzroy, Fawkner Park (41 ha), Como Park and Victoria Gardens in South Yarra, Alma Park and the St Kilda Botanical Gardens in St Kilda, Hedgeley Dene Gardens and Central Park in Malvern, Princes Park in Caulfield, and Footscray Park in Footscray, and Hays Paddock in Kew East. Outer suburbs Maribyrnong River at Brimbank Park While most attention is paid to parks and gardens in the inner urban area around the CBD, extensive and significant parks and rivers can also be found around the outer suburbs of Melbourne. These include: * Brimbank Park on the Maribyrnong River in the north west * Westerfolds Park and Yarra Bend Park on the Yarra River * Wattle Park in the eastern suburb of Surrey Hills with its historical connection to trams in Melbourne. * Cherry Lake, Truganina Coastal Parklands and Altona Coastal Park in the bayside western suburb of Altona. * Werribee Park in Werribee, which includes the Werribee Park Mansion, the Victoria State Rose Garden, the Werribee Park National Equestrian Centre, the Werribee Open Range Zoo, a contemporary sculpture walk and a Heritage Orchard. * Willamstown Botanic Gardens at the bayside western suburb of Williamstown. * Footscray Park in the western suburb of Maribyrnong opposite the Flemington Racecourse on the Maribyrnong River. * Pipemakers Park, a park in Maribyrnong recycled from a historic pipemaking industrial site and includes a museum, wharf, garden, wetlands, BBQ areas and the Maribyrnong River trail. * Newport Lakes Park, a 33-hectare bushland oasis created from a former blustone quarry and rubbish tip site in the middle of Newport. * Blackburn Lake Sanctuary – one of the few remaining areas of natural bushland in suburban Melbourne, located in the eastern suburbs at Blackburn * Royal Botanic Gardens, Cranbourne, emphasising Australian plants. * Other suburban rivers with fantastic trails and reserves and within 20 km of the CBD include Merri Creek, Moonee Ponds Creek, Kororoit Creek, Plenty River, Darebin Creek and Dandenong Creek. * Currawong Bush Park in Warrandyte, important remnant native riparian bushland and archaeological site. * Organ Pipes National Park, a 121 hectares protected area located in Keilor North off the Calder Highway, 20 km to the northwest of Melbourne city. * Point Cook Coastal Park, Point Cook Homestead, Cheetham Wetlands and RAAF Aircraft Museum in Point Cook.  Dandenong Ranges  The Dandenong Ranges to the east of Melbourne are famous for their gardens, which are established on rich volcanic soil in a high rainfall area. A popular pastime during autumn is to drive through the hills viewing the vibrant foliage of deciduous trees. Some public gardens in the Ranges include: * William Ricketts Sanctuary at Mount Dandenong * National Rhododendron Gardens at Olinda. * Alfred Nicholas Gardens * George Tindale Garden * Mount Dandenong Arboretum * Pirianda Garden, Olinda. *Karwarra Australian Native Botanic Garden (rear of Kalorama Memorial Reserve) Kalorama  Private gardens  Residential gardening is a popular pastime throughout Melbourne, and the city is known for its leafy green suburbs. Many private gardens open for public viewing through Australia's Open Garden Scheme, which started in Melbourne.

He took part in the staged Gleiwitz incident, a false flag intended to provide the justification for the attack on Poland by Nazi Germany, starting the Second World War in Europe. Early life Naujocks was born in Kiel and attended the University of Kiel, where he studied engineering. In 1931, after an incomplete apprenticeship as a precision mechanic, he joined the SS. A well known amateur boxer, he was frequently in brawls with the communists. He then signed on as a low-ranking driver for the Sicherheitsdienst SD-Regional Command East, Berlin in 1934, but was soon entrusted with special assignments such as murder. He led an undercover attack on an anti-Nazi radio station in the village of Slapy in Czechoslovakia on 23 January 1935. Black Front activist Rudolf Formis was killed in the incident; Naujocks confessed to the murder in 1944 while in American custody.Alfred Naujocks: Eine verflixt heikle Geschichte (in German) By the Autumn of 1937, Naujocks had been promoted to Hauptsturmführer (captain) and by 1938 had been promoted again, to Sturmbannführer (major). World War II Plaque on site commemorating the Gleiwitz incident On 10 August 1939, Reinhard Heydrich informed Naujocks of his mission to lead a small group of German operatives to seize the Gleiwitz radio station. Three weeks later, on the night of 31 August, Naujocks led the attack on the German radio station at Gleiwitz, one of twenty-one similar concentrated attacks which the German government quickly attributed to the Poles. Once inside the radio station, a short anti-German message in Polish was broadcast (the precise content of the message is now uncertain). Shots were fired in the studio and a corpse left on the floor near the microphone. To add documented proof of this attack, the SD operatives placed fictitious Polish troops (corpses of prisoners from the Dachau concentration camp who had been dressed in Polish uniforms provided by the Abwehr, killed by lethal injection, and then shot for the sake of appearances) around the attacked radio station for selected members of the press to see at the site of the incident. These attacks, but not exclusively the Gleiwitz incident, formed Hitler's justification to the Reichstag regarding the necessary \\"pacification\\" of Poland, thereby igniting the Second World War in Europe.Benz (2007). A Concise History of the Third Reich, p. 170. More recently, author and researcher Jak Mallmann-Showell's investigation has suggested that Naujocks's claims as to his actions at the Gleiwitz radio station may have been a fabrication to curry special handling by the Allies after the war. Mallmann- Showell discerned that Naujocks is the sole source for details of his personal actions on the night of 31 August 1939. He also avers that the Poles may have accessed the site to obtain Enigma machine secrets for the allies. Later, on 9 November 1939, Naujocks (along with Walter Schellenberg) participated in the Venlo incident, which saw the capture in the Netherlands of two British SIS agents, Captain Sigismund Payne Best and Major Richard Henry Stevens. In early 1940, Naujocks was put in charge of the counterfeiting unit of the SD charged with forging British bank notes under Operation Andreas. By late 1940 Naujocks had been removed from his position after he fell out of favor with Heydrich. In 1941, he was dismissed from the SD after disputing one of Reinhard Heydrich's orders. He was demoted and had to serve in the Waffen-SS on the Eastern Front. In 1943, due to ill health, he was sent to the West, where he served as an economic administrator the following year for German troops in Belgium, while involving himself in the deaths of several Belgian underground and Danish resistance members. After his promotion to Obersturmführer (first lieutenant) he participated in sabotage and terrorist actions against the Danish population from December 1943 until autumn 1944, as the leader of the \\"Peter Group\\", including the murder of Lutheran pastor Kaj Munk.Murder of Kaj Munk, findagrave.com; accessed 22 January 2015. Later leadership passed to SS- Hauptsturmführer Otto Alexander Friedrich Schwerdt (SS-Jagdverbände). Circa November 1944, Naujocks turned himself over to American forces, who subsequently placed him in detention as a possible war criminal by the end of the war. Later life At the Nuremberg Trials, Naujocks declared the attack against German Radio Tower in Gleiwitz was under orders from Heinrich Müller, the head of Gestapo and his superior, Reinhard Heydrich. After the war, he escaped from custody before his trial for war crimes, and lived in hiding into the 1960s. He worked as a businessman in Hamburg, where he eventually sold his story to the media as The Man who Started the War. He was alleged to have been involved in running ODESSA, together with Otto Skorzeny, who handled contracts with the Spanish government, supplying passports and arranging for funds. Naujocks and his associates handled former Nazi war criminals going to Latin America, being responsible for their reception and protection there. Naujocks died of a heart attack in Hamburg on 4 April 1966, aged 54.Stalin enthauptet die Rote Armee: Der Fall Tuchatschewskij (in German)Berliner Zeitung: Vor fünfzig Jahren kam der Film \\"Der Fall Gleiwitz\\" in die Kinos, 17.

The Biesbosch National Park is one of the largest national parks of the Netherlands and one of the last extensive areas of freshwater tidal wetlands in Northwestern Europe. The Biesbosch ('forest of sedges' or 'rushwoods') consists of a large network of rivers and smaller and larger creeks with islands. The vegetation is mostly willow forests, although wet grasslands and fields of reed are common as well. The Biesbosch is an important wetland area for waterfowl and has a rich flora and fauna. It is especially important for migrating geese.  Structure  = National Park = Simple map of the Biesbosch.The Biesbosch National Park consists of the following major parts: * Sliedrechtse Biesbosch The most northern part of the Biesbosch. This is the part of the Biesbosch with the most significant tidal influence (one of the distinctive characteristics of the Biesbosch). The Sliedrechtse Biesbosch is named after the town of Sliedrecht, which was drowned during the creation of the Biesbosch and was later rebuilt on the other side of the river Beneden Merwede (one of the borders of the Biesbosch). The eastern part of the Sliedrechtse Biesbosch is one of the few areas in the Netherlands that has an intact system of river dunes. * Hollandse Biesbosch The westernmost part of the Biesbosch and the largest remnant of the (once much larger) South Hollandic part of the Biesbosch. The Hollandse Biesbosch is the part of the National Park best known for its birds. * Brabantse Biesbosch (Zuidwaard) Map showing the parts of the Biesbosch that make up the National Park (highlighted).The eastern and largest part of the Biesbosch, which is separated from the rest of the Biesbosch by the Nieuwe Merwede river (which serves as the borderline between the provinces of South Holland and North Brabant). The Brabantse Biesbosch can be divided in three parts, from which only the so-called Zuidwaard belongs to the National Park. The Zuidwaard of the Brabantse Biesbosch has fewer fields of reeds and sedges compared to the rest of the National Park and consists mostly of willow forests. = Other = The National Park occupies only half of the original Biesbosch area. The other half has been reclaimed and consists mostly of farmland. It can be divided in several parts as well: * Dordtse Biesbosch The part of the Biesbosch that borders the city of Dordrecht. It is located between the Sliedrechtse Biesbosch and the Hollandse Biesbosch. Although the Dordtse Biesbosch has largely an agricultural destination, it also contains several recreational areas which serves as the \\"playground\\" for the people of Dordrecht. * Brabantse Biesbosch (Noordwaard) Creek remnant in the Biesbosch.The most central part of the Biesbosch and the subject of much recent controversy. The Noordwaard has only been reclaimed during the 20th century and hosts some of most fertile farmlands in the entire Netherlands. However, as a result of the high water levels in the Dutch rivers during the 1990s, the government has decided to undo the reclamation and reconnect the Noordwaard to the Merwede rivers (essentially the Rhine). In this way it can serve as a buffer and be of much importance in the prevention of dike breaks and subsequent flooding in densely populated areas in the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta. The first phase of the \\"de-poldering\\" has been completed by 2008 and the resulting wetlands have been added to the National Park. The second phase will be completed somewhere between 2015 and 2020. * Brabantse Biesbosch (Oostwaard) The easternmost and oldest part of the Biesbosch does not resemble the rest of the Biesbosch and consists mainly of farmland and expanded neighbourhoods of towns along the Biesbosch border (such as Werkendam, Nieuwendijk and Hank), along with a few creek remnants. Much of the Oostwaard has been reclaimed during the 17th and 18th centuries. Creation The Biesbosch was created when 300 square kilometres of polder lands were submerged in the St. Elizabeth flood in the year 1421. Before this, the area was called Grote Hollandse Waard, containing cultivated land and a number of villages. The more than a century old dikes collapsed because of lack of maintenance, due to the difficult economic situation in the area, and the difficulties between the political entities within (especially the Hook and Cod (civil) wars). The Grote Waard in 1421, just before the St. Elizabeth flood.One of the key factors in the flooding of the Grote Waard was the creation of a new dike in the southwest of the polder. The ground beneath this dike was unstable, which was a known (but underestimated) fact in this period of time. However, combined with political rivalry and financial issues, this resulted in the creation of an unstable dike, located at one of the key corners of the Grote Waard. It was the only place where high tides coming directly from the sea could penetrate the land deeply and could reach a primary \\"keystone\\" dike of the Grote Waard (most of the primary dikes were used as protection against rivers instead). Biesbosch wetlands.Very high river levels combined with a severe storm surge coming in from the sea caused the collapse of the southwest dike and several riverdikes, resulting in the flooding of most of the Grote Hollandse Waard. After the flood, three areas remained: the Island of Dordrecht to the west, the Land van Altena (with the city of Woudrichem) to the east, and the brackish swamps of the Biesbosch in between. Many villages (by tradition 72) were swallowed by the flood and were lost, causing (again by tradition) either 2,000 or 10,000 casualties. Some towns had more luck and submerged, only to rise above the water later on. Many Rhine-Meuse delta branches that were closed off from the main rivers and served as drainage bodies of the Grote Waard, also disappeared. These include the Dubbel (the name of which survives in Dubbeldam), Eem, Werken (after which Werkendam is named), Graaf, Alm (which lent its name to Almkerk; the eastern part survived) and most of the main drainage stream: the Oude Maas (a small part survives in the form of the Oude Maasje, not to be confused with another branch called Oude Maas near Rotterdam). Most of the flooded area changed into a network of estuaries. The most important of those were the Hollands Diep (\\"Holland Deep\\") and the (shallow) Heidezee (\\"Heath Sea\\"). Both were connected to the Haringvliet which existed before the disaster as a pure seawater inlet of the North Sea. After the disaster it became brackish and an important estuary of the rivers Rhine and Meuse. A persistent misunderstanding is that the Biesbosch arose by this storm flood in one night. It is true that this flood broke dikes of the then Grote Hollandse Waard or Zuid Hollandse Waard, but it needed dozens of years before the whole area was under water and had changed to the Biesbosch with its creeks and reeds. History Biesbosch at low tide.At first, the Heidezee was a shallow but extended body of water, with high tides but also a predominance of fresh water. The deposits of the rivers caused the land to become only submerged at high tides. From that moment on the area was called the Bergse Veld (\\"Fields of Geertruidenberg\\") and, later on (during the 18th century), the Biesbosch (although a small patch of swamp had been known as Biesbosch even before the flood). A network of interconnecting creeks, mudflats and forested areas arose, which served as a sort of inland delta of the large rivers feeding it. A significant result of this was that the former estuary arms of the Rhine and Meuse, further north- west, were devoid of much of the inflow of fresh water. This caused the rivers to fill with deposits, so the important shipping route between Rotterdam and the inland areas was no longer usable. During the last centuries, conditions changed significantly. Most of the Biesbosch was reclaimed and turned into polders. The Rhine-Meuse connection with Rotterdam was restored by preventing the build-up of deposits by artificial means. Most of the Biesbosch creeks were closed off at their upstream end to lower the risk of flooding. The confluence of the Meuse and Rhine rivers was closed off as well and the Meuse received a new, artificial mouth: the Bergse Maas. By separating rivers Meuse and Rhine before they reach the Biesbosch, their flow can be controlled better. A second ship canal was created to better distribute the flow of the river Rhine as well: the Nieuwe Merwede, which divides the Biesbosch into two parts: the \\"lesser\\" Biesbosch, now the southeastern part of the Island of Dordrecht, and the \\"greater\\" Biesbosch. As a result of these hydrological changes, the Biesbosch lost its function as a river delta and now only receives water directly from the rivers in times of high discharges. During World War II, the area was used by Dutch residents to hide out from the German occupation forces in the Netherlands. A resistance group was formed that, late in the war, captured Germans fleeing to the north from what was then the Allied-held south of the Netherlands. In the winter of 1944, the area was crossed by refugees from the occupied north, while, at the same time, it was being used to smuggle medicines to the north. The people that coordinated these activities are known as the Biesbosch crossers and are commonly regarded as national heroes. Many Dutch books and a few movies are based on this resistance group. Before 1970 a connection with the sea existed, and the tidal differences were, on average, two meters. Despite the diminished inflow of the Meuse and Waal rivers, fresh water continued to dominate. The tidal differences almost disappeared after 1970 when the Delta Works closed the Haringvliet and with it the Biesbosch's direct connection with the sea. Only in the northern part of the Biesbosch (the so-called Sliedrechtse Biesbosch) some of the tidal difference remained (20–80 cm on average). The diminishing of the tidal difference caused a dramatic transformation of the Biesbosch, which mostly changed into a willow forest with small remnants of the once mighty delta streams. The creation of the Haringvlietdam also blocked the main route for migrating fish. The influence of both rivers and sea had now mostly gone.  Future  The Dutch government has decided to undo most of the reclamation and give it back to nature and to reconnect the main rivers with the Biesbosch creeks. This decision has been made as a result of extremely high river discharges in 1993 and 1995. This means that a large part of the Biesbosch will return to its original state: an interconnected network of rivers and creeks, serving as an inland river delta. The area can then be used as a natural buffer to prevent major floods and to lower the risk of very high river levels. This will also restore some of the natural situation and will result in an expansion of the habitat of many animals. Much of this operation is near completion as of 2014. Air view of parts of the BiesboschEspecially the beaver population could profit from these hydrological changes (and, as of 2014, they indeed expanded their range significantly). It would also hopefully create the right conditions for the return of the osprey and the white-tailed eagle as breeding birds. Because of recent nature development of new wetlands the great egret and the little egret have already become familiar elements in the Biesbosch today. There is also an increase in the population of bitterns and kingfishers. Moreover, as of 2014 a couple of white-tailed eagles has been breeding in the Biesbosch for several years in a row. Ospreys have been using the Biesbosch as a feeding ground for several years now, with as a result the first Dutch-born Ospreys in the spring of 2016.http://nos.nl/artikel/2108500-primeur-eerste-visarend-en-in-nederland- geboren.html There are also plans to restore the estuary function of the Haringvliet and Hollands Diep, restoring the natural shift from fresh to salty water and allow the return of the tides in the Biesbosch. A first step will be opening some of the sluices of the Haringvlietdam. This will result in a minimal return of tidal effects without having a dramatic impact on the landscape, because a full opening of the dam will make most of the surrounding farming areas unusable, as a result of the influx of salty water. One should note the fact that in times of severe floods coming from the North Sea, the dam will still be able to close and serve in a similar way as the Oosterscheldekering. The partial opening of the Haringvlietdam will create an opportunity for migrating fish to enter the Rhine and Meuse rivers, restoring the natural situation. This will hopefully result in the return of the salmon, trout, shad, smelt and many other species of fish. It will also create opportunities for the almost extinct southern Dutch population of seals (now mostly restricted to parts of the Oosterschelde). Seals used to be a common sight in the Biesbosch despite the fact that the area is dominated by freshwater. Their presence ended in 1970, although a few individuals somehow managed to reach the Biesbosch afterwards. The partial opening of the Haringvlietdam will restore some of the natural situation. In the future possibly moose will be re-introduced in the area.Elanden in de Biesbosch - ARK Natuurontwikkeling Threats Typical Biesbosch creek.The area still faces many threats. One of them is the pollution of water and soil. Many streambeds contain severely polluted sediments, a remainder from the sixties and seventies, when the rivers Rhine and Meuse were much more polluted than they are today. Because there is little net flow in the Biesbosch (because the connection with both rivers and the sea has been blocked, although this will change in the future) the build-up of polluted sediments in the Biesbosch has been severe. Completely restoring the Biesbosch ecosystem cannot happen without an extensive cleanup of all the creeks, which will be an enormous and costly task. Another threat to the Biesbosch ecosystem is the extensive water recreation in the area. The Biesbosch has, however, both strong natural and recreational values, so banning all recreational activities in the area is not an option. Finding the right balance in this issue will be a challenge. Other threats include the construction of yacht-basins, urban expansion and plans for exploitation of natural gas reserves.

The mandible—or lower jaw—is tapped at a downward angle just below the lips at the chin while the mouth is held slightly open. In response, the masseter muscles will jerk the mandible upwards. Normally this reflex is absent or very slight. However, in individuals with upper motor neuron lesions the jaw jerk reflex can be quite pronounced. The jaw jerk reflex can be classified as a dynamic stretch reflex. As with most other reflexes, the response to the stimulus is monosynaptic, with sensory neurons of the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus sending axons to the trigeminal motor nucleus, which in turn innervates the masseter. This reflex is used to judge the integrity of the upper motor neurons projecting to the trigeminal motor nucleus. Both the sensory and motor aspects of this reflex are through CN V. It is not part of a standard neurological examination. It is performed when there are other signs of damage to the trigeminal nerve. The clinical presentation of cervical spondylotic myelopathy can be similar to multiple sclerosis (MS) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), however, a hyperactive jaw reflex suggests the pathology is above the foramen magnum. In other words, a normal jaw jerk reflex points the diagnosis toward cervical spondylotic myelopathy and away from MS or ALS.  Factors affecting the reflex  = Gender = Studies have shown that there is a significant effect of gender on the jaw jerk reflex. Electromyographs are used to measure the impulse within the muscle, allowing the amplitude of the impulse to be known and shown on a graph. The ECMs were focussed on the masseter muscle and temporalis muscle. Females showed a significantly higher amplitude – meaning that the impulse was larger – than males. This should be taken into account when interpreting ECM results, as a female’s graphs will normally show a higher peak to peak amplitude than a male. The mean latency of the impulse was also found to be shorter in females than in males. This variation in women appears to be constant, and is not affected by the menstrual cycle. = Age = Studies have shown that there has been a slight general increase in latency of this reflex with increasing age. Latency is defined here as the time taken between the chin tap to the first obvious deflection as seen on the subject. The most prominent decline in masseteric activity was recorded in patients aged 75 years and older, which might be due to the reduction in both tendon and superficial reflexes. A study also reports that 52% of the elderly exhibit an absence of jaw jerk reflex, in an average age of 81.8 years. Jaw muscles do not display very prominent changes in muscular tissue with age in healthy elderly, as their oral cavities are in constant motor movement (i.e.: performing tasks such as talking and chewing etc.). This motion delays the decrease in lean body mass and aids protein retention that comes with age, preventing the muscular tissues from wearing and tearing. History American neurologist Morris Lewis (1852–1928) first described the jaw jerk. But several textbooks of neurology and clinical neurophysiology attribute discovery of the jaw jerk reflex to Armand de Watteville (1846–1925) as he correctly predicted that the jaw jerk would be valuable to detect disease affecting bulbar nuclei  References  * Nolte, J.

Before the war, the island of Hispaniola had been united under the Haitian government for a period of 22 years when the newly independent nation, previously known as the Captaincy General of Santo Domingo, was unified with Haiti in 1822. The criollo class within the country overthrew the Spanish crown in 1821 before unifying with Haiti a year later. After ousting the Haitian occupying force from the country, Dominican nationalists had to fight against a series of attempted invasions from 1844 to 1856. Haitian soldiers would make incessant attacks to try to regain control of the territory, but these efforts were to no avail as the Dominicans would go on to win every battle henceforth. Background At the beginning of the 1800s, the colony of Santo Domingo, which had once been the headquarters of Spanish power in the New World, was in its worst decline. Spain during this time was embroiled in the Peninsular War in Europe, and other various wars to maintain control of the Americas. With Spain's resources spread among its global interest, Santo Domingo and other Caribbean territories became neglected. This period is referred to as the España Boba era. The population of the Spanish colony stood at approximately 80,000 with the vast majority being European descendants and free people of color. For most of its history, Santo Domingo had an economy based on mining and cattle ranching. The Spanish colony's plantation economy never truly flourished, because of this the black slave population had been significantly lower than that of the neighboring Saint-Domingue, which was nearing a million slaves before the Haitian Revolution. = Ephemeral independence = Late in 1821 the leader José Núñez de Cáceres proclaimed Santo Domingo's adhesion to the new \\"Republic of Gran Colombia\\", created by Simón Bolívar, but the determination of the island elite to perpetuate their privileged status by maintaining intact all colonial-era institutions such as social hierarchy, land titles, and slavery doomed this limited experiment in liberty to failure two months later.  Unification of Hispaniola (1822-1844) A group of Dominican politicians and military officers had expressed interest in uniting the entire island, while they sought for political stability and support under Haiti, which at the time was still seen as having a great deal of wealth and power. Haiti had been by far the richest colony in the western hemisphere and was known as the Pearl of the Antilles. Haiti's president, Jean Pierre Boyer, promised his full protection and support to the frontier governors, and thus he ceremoniously entered the country with around 10,000 soldiers in February 1822, after most of the cities and towns proclaimed their allegiance to the Republic of Haiti between November 1821 and January 1822, including Puerto Plata (December 13, 1821) and Santiago (December 29, 1821). On February 9, 1822, Boyer formally entered the capital city, Santo Domingo, where he was met with enthusiasm and received by Núñez who offered to him the keys of the Palace. Boyer rejected the offer, while saying: \\"I have not come into this city as a conqueror but by the will of its inhabitants\\". The island was thus united from \\"Cape Tiburon to Cape Samana in possession of one government.\\" Eventually, the Haitian government became extremely unpopular throughout the country. The Dominican population grew increasingly impatient with Haiti's poor management and perceived incompetence, and the heavy taxation that was imposed on their side. The country was hit with a severe economic crisis after having been forced to pay a huge indemnity to France. A debt was accrued by Haiti in order to pay for their own independence from the European nation; this would give rise to many anti-Haitian plots. =Resistance= An assembly of the Trinitarios In 1838 Juan Pablo Duarte, an educated nationalist, founded a resistance movement called La Trinitaria (\\"The Trinity\\") along with Ramón Matías Mella and Francisco del Rosario Sánchez. It was so named because its original nine members had organized themselves into cells of three. The cells went on to recruit as separate organizations, maintaining strict secrecy, with little or no direct contact among themselves, in order to minimize the possibility of detection by the Haitian authorities. Many recruits quickly came to the group, but it was discovered and forced to change its name to La Filantrópica (\\"The Philanthropic\\"). In 1843 the revolution made a breakthrough: they worked with a liberal Haitian party that overthrew President Jean-Pierre Boyer. However, the Trinitarios'The members of La Trinitaria. work in the overthrow gained the attention of Boyer's replacement, Charles Rivière-Hérard. Rivière-Hérard imprisoned some Trinitarios and forced Duarte to leave the island. While gone, Duarte searched for support in Colombia and Venezuela, but was unsuccessful. In December 1843 the rebels told Duarte to return since they had to act quickly because they were afraid the Haitians had learned of their insurrection plans. When Duarte had not returned by February, because of illness, the rebels decided to take action anyway with the leadership of Francisco del Rosario Sánchez, Ramón Matías Mella, and Pedro Santana, a wealthy cattle-rancher from El Seibo who commanded a private army of peons who worked on his estates. War of Independence Battle of Azua. The Dominicans gained the victory, repelling their enemy with the loss of only 2 killed and 3 wounded, while more than 1,000 Haitians remained dead on the field. Battle of Santiago. Musket and cannon fire accounted for 600 Haitian dead; the Dominicans suffered only 1 wounded.alt= On February 27, 1844, the rebels seized the Ozama Fortress in the capital. The Haitian garrison, taken by surprise and apparently betrayed by at least one of its sentries, retired in disarray. Within two days, all Haitian officials had left Santo Domingo. Mella headed the provisional governing junta of the new Dominican Republic. On March 14, Duarte finally returned after recovering from his illness and was greeted in celebration. Hérard responded almost immediately. Fielding an army of 30,000 soldiers on March 10, 1844, he entered the new Dominican Republic with the intent of returning the eastern half of the island to Haitian rule. He was quickly defeated, however, and within a month was forced to retreat with his army back into Haiti. In early July 1844, Duarte was urged by his followers to take the title of President of the Republic. Duarte agreed, but only if free elections were arranged. However, Santana's forces took Santo Domingo on July 12, 1844, and they declared Santana ruler of the Dominican Republic. Santana then put Mella, Duarte, and Sánchez in jail. On November 6, 1844 a constituent assembly drafted a constitution, which established separation of powers and legislative checks on the executive. However, Santana included in it Article 210, which granted him unlimited power during the current war against Haiti. The war continued throughout September and November 1845, with the Dominicans winning the Battle of Estrelleta and the Battle of Beler. Santana remained as President until 1848, when he lost the election, only to seize power by a coup d'état the year after, when the Haitian Emperor Faustin Soulouque attacked and was defeated at Ocoa. Haitian strategy was ridiculed by the American press: In November 1849, a small naval campaign was undertaken in which Dominican government schooners captured Anse-à-Pitres and one or two other villages on the southern coast of Haiti, which were sacked and burned by the Dominicans. The Dominicans also captured Dame-Marie, which they plundered and set on fire. In November 1855, Soulouque invaded the Dominican Republic at the head of a 30,000-strong army. But again the Dominicans proved to be superior soldiers, defeating Soulouque's army, which vastly outnumbered them.It was the last Haitian invasion, but Haiti did not formally recognize the independence of the Dominican Republic until 1874.

He was one of the most popular American comedians in the 1930s and 1940s, with films like A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935), Earthworm Tractors (1936), and Alibi Ike (1935). In his later career Brown starred in Some Like It Hot (1959), as Osgood Fielding III, in which he utters the film's famous punchline \\"Well, nobody's perfect.\\" Early life Brown was born on July 28, 1891, in Holgate, Ohio, near Toledo, into a large family of Welsh descent. He spent most of his childhood in Toledo. In 1902, at the age of ten, he joined a troupe of circus tumblers known as the Five Marvelous Ashtons, who toured the country on both the circus and vaudeville circuits. Later he became a professional baseball player. Despite his skill, he declined an opportunity to sign with the New York Yankees to pursue his career as an entertainer. After three seasons he returned to the circus, then went into vaudeville and finally starred on Broadway. He gradually added comedy to his act, and transformed himself into a comedian. He moved to Broadway in the 1920s, first appearing in the musical comedy Jim Jam Jems. Film career with June Travis in Earthworm Tractors (1936) In late 1928, Brown began making films, starting the next year with Warner Brothers. He quickly became a favorite with child audiences, and shot to stardom after appearing in the first all-color all-talking musical comedy On with the Show (1929). He starred in a number of lavish Technicolor musical comedies, including Sally (1929), Hold Everything (1930), Song of the West (1930), and Going Wild (1930). By 1931, Brown had become such a star that his name was billed above the title in the films in which he appeared. He appeared in Fireman, Save My Child (1932), a comedy in which he played a member of the St. Louis Cardinals, and in Elmer, the Great (1933) with Patricia Ellis and Claire Dodd and Alibi Ike (1935) with Olivia de Havilland, in both of which he portrayed ballplayers with the Chicago Cubs. In 1933 he starred in Son of a Sailor with Jean Muir and Thelma Todd. In 1934, Brown starred in A Very Honorable Guy with Alice White and Robert Barrat, in The Circus Clown again with Patricia Ellis and with Dorothy Burgess, and with Maxine Doyle in Six-Day Bike Rider. Brown was one of the few vaudeville comedians to appear in a Shakespeare film; he played Francis Flute in the Max Reinhardt/William Dieterle film version of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935) and was highly praised for his performance. He starred in Polo Joe (1936) with Carol Hughes and Richard \\"Skeets\\" Gallagher, and in Sons o' Guns. In 1933 and 1936, he became one of the top 10 earners in films. He was sufficiently well known internationally by this point to be depicted in comic strips in the British comic Film Fun for 20 years from 1933. He left Warner Brothers to work for producer David L. Loew, starring in When's Your Birthday? (1937). In 1938, he starred in The Gladiator, a loose adaptation of Philip Gordon Wylie's 1930 novel Gladiator that influenced the creation of Superman.Jones, Gerard.

World War II Brown and Irving Leroy Ress (right) c. 1950 In 1939, Brown testified before the House Immigration Committee in support of a bill that would allow 20,000 German-Jewish refugee children into the U.S. He later adopted two refugee children.The Holocaust Chronicle. Publications International Ltd., 2000 (), p. 162 At age 50 when the U.S. entered World War II, Brown was too old to enlist. Both of his biological sons served in the military during the war. In 1942, Captain Don E. Brown, was killed when his Douglas A-20 Havoc crashed near Palm Springs, California. Even before the USO was organized, Brown spent a great deal of time traveling, at his own expense, to entertain troops in the South Pacific, including Guadalcanal, New Zealand and Australia, as well as the Caribbean and Alaska. He was the first to tour in this way and before Bob Hope made similar journeys. Brown also spent many nights working and meeting servicemen at the Hollywood Canteen. He wrote of his experiences entertaining the troops in his book Your Kids and Mine. On his return to the U.S., Brown brought sacks of letters, making sure they were delivered by the Post Office. He gave shows in all weather conditions, many in hospitals, sometimes doing his entire show for a single dying soldier. He signed autographs for everyone. For his services to morale, Brown became one of only two civilians to be awarded the Bronze Star during World War II. Postwar work His concern for the troops continued into the Korean War, as evidenced by a newsreel featuring his appeal for blood donations to aid the U.S. and UN troops there that was featured in the season 4 episode of M*A*S*H titled \\"Deluge\\". In 1948, he was awarded a Special Tony Award for his work in the touring company of Harvey. He had a cameo appearance in Around the World in 80 Days (1956), as the Fort Kearney stationmaster talking to Fogg (David Niven) and his entourage in a small town in Nebraska. In the similarly epic film It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963), he had a cameo as a union official giving a speech at a construction site in the climactic scene. On television, he was the mystery guest on What's My Line? during the episode on January 11, 1953. His best known postwar role was that of aging millionaire Osgood Fielding III in Billy Wilder's 1959 comedy Some Like It Hot. Fielding falls for Daphne (Jerry), played by Jack Lemmon in drag; at the end of the film, Lemmon takes off his wig and reveals to Brown that he is a man, to which Brown responds \\"Well, nobody's perfect\\", one of the more celebrated punchlines in film. Another of his notable postwar roles was that of Cap'n Andy Hawks in MGM's 1951 remake of Show Boat, a role that he reprised onstage in the 1961 New York City Center revival of the musical and on tour. Brown performed several dance routines in the film, and famed choreographer Gower Champion appeared along with first wife Marge. Brown's final film appearance was in The Comedy of Terrors (1964). Brown with Buster Keaton in the \\"Journey to Ninevah\\" episode of Route 66 from 1962 Brown was a sports enthusiast, both in film and personally. Some of his best films were the \\"baseball trilogy\\" which consisted of Fireman, Save My Child (1932), Elmer, the Great (1933) and Alibi Ike (1935). He was a television and radio broadcaster for the New York Yankees in 1953. His son Joe L. Brown became the general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates for more than 20 years. Brown spent Ty Cobb's last days with him, discussing his life. Brown's sports enthusiasm also led to him becoming the first president of PONY Baseball and Softball (at the time named Pony League) when the organization was incorporated in 1953. He continued in the post until late 1964, when he retired. Later he traveled additional thousands of miles telling the story of PONY League, hoping to interest adults in organizing baseball programs for young people. He was a fan of thoroughbred horse racing, a regular at the racetracks in Del Mar and Santa Anita. In popular culture He was caricatured in the Disney cartoons Mickey's Gala Premiere (1933), Mother Goose Goes Hollywood (1938), and The Autograph Hound (1939); all contain a scene in which he is seen laughing so loud that his mouth opens extremely wide. According to the official biography Daws Butler: Characters Actor, Daws Butler used Joe E. Brown as inspiration for the voices of two Hanna-Barbera cartoon characters: Lippy the Lion (1962) and Peter Potamus (19631966). Later life and family Brown married Kathryn Francis McGraw in 1915. The marriage lasted until his death in 1973. The couple had four children: two sons, Don Evan Brown (December 25, 1916 October 8, 1942; Captain in the United States Army Air Force, who was killed in the crash of an A-20B Havoc bomber while serving as a ferry pilot)Associated Press, \\"Flying Son Of Film Star Crash Victim\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Friday 9 October 1942, Volume 49, page 1. and Joe LeRoy \\"Joe L.\\" Brown (September 1, 1918 August 15, 2010), and two daughters, Mary Katherine Ann (b. 1930) and Kathryn Francis (b. 1934). Both daughters were adopted as infants. Joe L. Brown shared his father's love of baseball, serving as general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1955 to 1976, and briefly in 1985, also building the 1960 and 1971 World Series champions. Brown's '71 Pirates featured baseball's first all-black starting nine.

It only retreats from the northern limits of its range in Texas and northern Mexico during winter. The groove-billed ani is about long, and weighs . Wingspan ranges from 41-46 cm (16-18 in). It is completely black, with a very long tail almost as long as its body. It has a huge bill with lengthwise grooves running the length of the upper mandible. It is very similar to the smooth-billed ani, some specimens of which have bills as small as the groove-billed and with grooves on the basal half. The two species are best distinguished by voice and range. In flight, the ani alternates between quick, choppy flaps and short glides. Close up of the Groove-billed ani Like other anis, the groove-billed is found in open and partly open country, such as pastures, savanna, and orchards. It feeds largely on a mixed diet of insects, seeds, and fruits. The groove-billed ani lives in small groups of one to five breeding pairs. They defend a single territory and lay their eggs in one communal nest. All group members incubate the eggs and care for the young.

In a camera, depth of focus indicates the tolerance of the film's displacement within the camera and is therefore sometimes referred to as \\"lens-to-film tolerance\\". Depth of focus versus depth of field The phrase depth of focus is sometimes erroneously used to refer to the depth of field (DOF), which is the area in front of the lens in acceptable focus, whereas the true meaning of depth of focus refers to the zone behind the lens wherein the film plane or sensor is placed to produce an in-focus image. Depth of focus can have two slightly different meanings. The first is the distance over which the image plane can be displaced while a single object plane remains in acceptably sharp focus; the second is the image-side conjugate of depth of field. With the first meaning, the depth of focus is symmetrical about the image plane; with the second, the depth of focus is greater on the far side of the image plane, though in most cases the distances are approximately equal. Where depth of field often can be measured in macroscopic units such as meters and feet, depth of focus is typically measured in microscopic units such as fractions of a millimeter or thousandths of an inch. The same factors that determine depth of field also determine depth of focus, but these factors can have different effects than they have in depth of field. Both depth of field and depth of focus increase with smaller apertures. For distant subjects (beyond macro range), depth of focus is relatively insensitive to focal length and subject distance, for a fixed f-number. In the macro region, depth of focus increases with longer focal length or closer subject distance, while depth of field decreases. Determining factors In small-format cameras, the smaller circle of confusion limit yields a proportionately smaller depth of focus. In motion-picture cameras, different lens mount and camera gate combinations have exact flange focal distance measurements to which lenses are calibrated. The choice to place gels or other filters behind the lens becomes a much more critical decision when dealing with smaller formats. Placement of items behind the lens will alter the optics pathway, shifting the focal plane. Therefore, often this insertion must be done in concert with stopping down the lens in order to compensate enough to make any shift negligible given a greater depth of focus. It is often advised in 35 mm motion-picture filmmaking not to use filters behind the lens if the lens is wider than 25 mm. Calculation If the depth of focus relates to a single plane in object space, it can be calculated from Larmore 1965, p. 167\\\\. :t = 2Nc \\\\frac{v}{f}, where t is the total depth of focus, N is the lens f-number, c is the circle of confusion, v is the image distance, and f is the lens focal length. In most cases, the image distance (not to be confused with subject distance) is not easily determined; the depth of focus can also be given in terms of magnification m: :t = 2Nc (1 + m). The magnification depends on the focal length and the subject distance, and sometimes it can be difficult to estimate. When the magnification is small, the formula simplifies to :t \\\\approx 2Nc. The simple formula is often used as a guideline, as it is much easier to calculate, and in many cases, the difference from the exact formula is insignificant. Moreover, the simple formula will always err on the conservative side (i.e., depth of focus will always be greater than calculated). Following historical convention, the circle of confusion is sometimes taken as the lens focal length divided by 1000 (with the result in same units as the focal length); Larmore 1965, p. 163\\\\. Ray 2000, p. 53\\\\. this formula makes most sense in the case of normal lens (as opposed to wide- angle or telephoto), where the focal length is a representation of the format size. This practice is now deprecated; it is more common to base the circle of confusion on the format size (for example, the diagonal divided by 1000 or 1500). In astronomy, the depth of focus \\\\Delta f is the amount of defocus that introduces a \\\\pm \\\\lambda/4 wavefront error. It can be calculated asMcLean 2008, p. 238.Lipson, Lipson, and Lipson 2010. :\\\\Delta f = \\\\pm 2 \\\\lambda N^2.  References  * Hart, Douglas C. 1996.

The Cuyama River runs adjacent to the town, flowing west towards the Pacific Ocean. Cuyama is surrounded by many apricot, peach, and plum orchards. The ZIP Code is 93254, and the community is inside area code 805. The population was 57 at the 2010 census. The name \\"Cuyama\\" comes from an Indian village named for the Chumash word kuyam, meaning \\"clam\\" or \\"freshwater mollusk\\". Cuyama is located on California State Route 166 2.5 miles (4 km) east of its much larger neighbor New Cuyama. South of the town is the Sierra Madre mountain range, most of which is included in the Los Padres National Forest. Considerable oil and gas development has taken place at the South Cuyama Oil Field in the foothills of the Sierra Madre, just south of Cuyama and adjacent New Cuyama. In July 2005, 52,000 acres (210 km2) in Los Padres National Forest, mostly in the region immediately south of Cuyama, was opened up to further development by the National Forest Service.

Formerly known as the Louisville Icehawks, they played in the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL) from 1995–2000. They played their home games in the Jacksonville Coliseum. History The Lizard Kings began play in the East Coast Hockey League as the Louisville Icehawks, based in Louisville, Kentucky. They played in Louisville from 1990 until 1994, but suspended operations after the 1993-94 season, and the organization decided to relocate to Jacksonville, Florida. The team, now rebranded as the Jacksonville Lizard Kings, promoted themselves in their new city with a substantial marketing campaign, including television ads featuring a goalie catching a puck with a lizard tongue. They faced some competition from another local hockey team, the Jacksonville Bullets, but were able to secure a lease to the Jacksonville Coliseum, and became Jacksonville's only professional hockey team when the Bullets folded in 1996. Despite their advertising the Lizard Kings were not able to cover their operating costs, and lost $2.2 million over four years. The management determined they would not be viable in the aging Jacksonville Coliseum, and decided to suspend operations in 2000 in anticipation of the construction of the new Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena. They never returned; in 2002 a new team, the Jacksonville Barracudas, began play in the Coliseum and secured a contract for the new Arena, completed in 2003.

The eastern portion of the route is known as Chino Hills Parkway. Running from State Route 90, Imperial Highway, in Brea to State Route 71 in Chino Hills, SR 142 is a popular shortcut from the business centers of Brea and surrounding Orange County to the Inland Empire. The road has multiple tight curves, so travel is not recommended for long vehicles, such as big rigs. Route description SR 142 begins in the city of Brea as Valencia Avenue at a junction with SR 90. The road heads northeast to an intersection with Carbon Canyon Road, which assumes the designation of SR 142 and continues east through Carbon Canyon Regional Park. SR 142 continues into the community of Olinda before crossing into the Sleepy Hollow area of the city of Chino Hills in San Bernardino County. SR 142 continues northeast through Chino Hills to an intersection, where it continues eastbound on Chino Hills Parkway. The highway ends at an interchange with SR 71 on the border of Chino Hills and Chino, near the California Institution for Men, a state prison. SR 142 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 142 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. History In 1933, a road from Brea to Chino was added to the state highway system. It was designated as Route 177 in 1935. In the 1964 state highway renumbering, this became part of SR 142. A routing from Chino to Upland was added to the state highway system as Route 274 in 1959, and was added to SR 142 in the 1964 renumbering from SR 71 to SR 30 (later SR 210), but no highway has been built along that route. In popular culture The road was referenced in the 1953 film War of the Worlds as the location that Recoilless 75s were positioned to defend the local townsfolk from the alien invasion.

Cricket career Bob Cowper was the son of Dave Cowper, who captained the Australia national rugby union team in the 1930s. Bob was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne, and began playing for Hawthorn-East Melbourne in 1958.The Oxford Companion to Australian Cricket, Oxford, Melbourne, 1996, pp. 125–26. Two years later he was in the Victorian side. A tall, correct left-handed batsmen, Cowper scored heavily for Victoria in the 1962–63 and 1963-64 seasons and was selected to tour England in 1964. He was successful in the county matches but not in his first Test at Headingley. He took part in Australia's next tour, to the West Indies in 1964-65, when he \\"displayed courage, a cool temperament and fine technique in dealing with the hostile pace of Hall and Griffith\\". He was Australia's leading run-scorer in the Test series, with 417 runs at an average of 52.12, including centuries in the Second and Fourth Tests.Alex Bannister, \\"Australians in West Indies, 1965\\", Wisden 1966, pp. 817–31. He was dropped in the 1965-66 Ashes series for slow scoring. When he was recalled for the Fifth Test at Melbourne he made the first Test triple-century in Australia: 307 from 589 balls in 727 minutes. Matthew Hayden's 380 against Zimbabwe in 2002–03 is now the highest Test century in Australia, but Cowper's remains the longest. After his triple-century he was never omitted from the Test side until a hand injury forced him out of the Fifth Test in 1968. In the last 13 matches of his Test career (the 1966–67, 1967–68, and 1968 series) he scored 931 runs at 38.79 and took 31 wickets at 25.22. In those 13 matches no other Australian player exceeded 800 runs, and only Graham McKenzie, with 49, took more wickets. Cowper was only 27 when he played his last Test, at Headingley in 1968, almost exactly four years after his first, at Headingley in 1964. He captained Victoria to victory in the Sheffield Shield in 1969-70, then left cricket altogether to concentrate on his business career. Remarkably, he averaged an impressive 75.78 in home Tests but only 33.33 overseas. The difference of 42.45 is a Test record.The best – and worst – travellers Later career Since retiring from playing, Cowper has had a successful career in big business, and has also served as a cricket referee. In 1977 he joined the administrative board of World Series Cricket. In the 1980s he moved to Monaco. He was awarded life membership of Cricket Victoria in 2018.

Once they are alone on the river bank, he murders the young woman. Background The song is superficially similar to other murder ballads in the idiom such as \\"Omie Wise\\" and more especially \\"Pretty Polly\\", which is also generally narrated in the first person by a killer called Willie. However, it differs significantly in the narrative; the killer explains why he killed his love, and spends much of the song expressing his sorrow and regret. Musically, it is distinguished by a long refrain which calmly reflects the love and the hopes for the future which he felt before the murder. This gives a different psychological tone to the song, and accompanying singers (or indeed the audience) the possibility of singing along in chorus. Another, less-well-known version of the song is entitled \\"On the Banks of the Old Pedee\\". The lyrics are sometimes adapted for a female singer. Recordings Commercial country music recordings started in 1927 with versions by Red Patterson's Piedmont Log Rollers (as \\"Down By The Banks Of The Ohio\\") and by Grayson and Whitter (as \\"I'll Never Be Yours\\"). Other early country music stars who recorded the song included Ernest Stoneman (1928), The Callahan Brothers (1934), The Blue Sky Boys (1936), Clayton McMichen (1931) and The Monroe Brothers (1936). The Blue Sky Boys version appears in the soundtrack of the 1973 film Paper Moon. The song was recorded for the American folk music revival market by Bascom Lamar Lunsford (1953) and by the traditional singer Ruby Vass on a 1959 field recording made by Alan Lomax and issued on the LP (and subsequent CD) series Southern Journey. It was recorded several times by Joan Baez: in 1959 as the opening track for the album Folksingers 'Round Harvard Square; in 1961 in her album Joan Baez, Vol. 2; on the 1968 Newport Folk Festival album; and other recordings. It was included on the 2011 CD compilation Voice of the People. Alan Lomax made a further field recording in 1961 at his New York City apartment, featuring veteran singer Clarence Ashley, accompanied by Fred Price (fiddle), and Clint Howard and Doc Watson (guitars). The recording, filmed by George Pickow and with sound by Jean Ritchie, was later used by Anna Lomax Wood for the short film Ballads, Blues and Bluegrass. Another recording by this group was issued on Old Time Music at Clarence Ashley's reissued as Original Folkways Recordings: 1960–1962 (1994). Also for Folkways, Doc Watson performed the song as a duet with Bill Monroe in 1963. Other folk revival artist who recorded the song included the New Lost City Ramblers and Pete Seeger. Artists who returned the song to country music audiences included Johnny Cash with The Carter Family and Porter Wagoner. Other recording were made by The Wolfe Tones, Arlo Guthrie (as \\"Arloff Boguslavaki\\", on the 1972 Earl Scruggs album I Saw the Light), Dave Guard and the Whiskeyhill Singers, Mike Ireland and Holler, Gangstagrass featuring Alexa Dirks also giving a faithful rendition on their 2014 album Broken Hearts and Stolen Money. Dolly Parton recorded the song in 2013, for her album Blue Smoke. Olivia Newton-John recorded an arrangement of the song by John Farrar and Bruce Welch in 1971, for her album If Not for You. It was released as the second single from the album and was successful in the UK, peaking at number six. It was her first number one hit in Australia and reached number nine in South Africa but failed to reach the top forty in Canada and the US, peaking at number sixty-six and ninety-four, respectively. The distinctive basso backing vocals were provided by English musician and vocal session arranger Mike Sammes. Tony Rice recorded the song on his eponymous 1977 album. A Swedish version, recorded by Ann-Louise Hanson, is entitled \\"Tag emot en utsträckt hand\\". The song appears, and gives the title for, the 2013 album Oh, Willie, Please... a collection of folk murder ballads, by alt-folk musical project Vandaveer. The band made a live 78 acetate recording in 2011. A Czech version, entitled \\"Náklaďák\\", was recorded by Petra Černocká, as a single in 1975 and was later recorded as the title track for her 1994 album. Legacy The song and its title served as the theme song for, and title of, a long-running radio series broadcast of bluegrass music on WAMU-PBS and Bluegrass Country, hosted by Fred Bartenstein and produced for the International Bluegrass Music Museum, near the Ohio River in Owensboro, Kentucky. Michigan bluegrass singer Missy Armstrong has recorded a play on this song entitled \\"Ain't Going Down to the River\\", in which the female singer recognizes that in too many songs, girls get killed at the banks of too many rivers.

MacDonald novel The Executioners. He was portrayed by Robert Mitchum in Cape Fear and Robert De Niro in Martin Scorsese's remake. Character overview Robert Mitchum as Max Cady in Cape Fear (1962). Robert De Niro as Max Cady in the 1991 remake. In both film versions of MacDonald's novel, Cady is a criminal with an obsessive grudge against an attorney named Sam Bowden (played by Gregory Peck in the first film and by Nick Nolte in the remake) who sent him to prison for rape. While in prison, Cady teaches himself to read as he nurtures his hatred of Bowden, made especially intense when his wife divorces him and takes their child. Upon his release, he terrorizes Bowden and his family, stalking his wife at their house and attempting to seduce Bowden's teenaged daughter. After Bowden's failed attempts to get rid of Cady with bribery and a restraining order, he hires street thugs to rough Cady up, which only succeeds in making him angrier and more determined to make sure Bowden \\"learns all about loss\\". Cady tracks the family to its summer home in the titular North Carolina beach town of Cape Fear and nearly kills them all. In the climax of the first film, Bowden puts Cady under citizen's arrest; in the second, Cady apparently drowns after a fight with Bowden. =Differences between the films= Significant differences are seen between the way in which Cady is portrayed in the original film and the remake. Mitchum's characterization is that of a sleazy, degenerate con artist, while De Niro's is of a homicidal sociopath, who viciously attacks everything and everyone Bowden holds dear (he even beats, mutilates and rapes Bowden's mistress). The remake also sheds some light on Cady's background, revealing he grew up in a rural Pentecostal family who handled snakes and drank strychnine to achieve religious ecstasy. Also, many differences occur in the films' portrayals of Cady and Bowden's relationship. In the first film, Bowden merely testified against Cady in court. In the remake, Bowden was Cady's attorney who deliberately suppressed evidence which may have lightened Cady's sentence or granted him an acquittal. Most notably, Cady's fate differs in the two films. In the 1962 version, Bowden manages to grab his revolver and shoot Cady in the leg during a fight between the two men. Rather than finish him off, Bowden spares Cady so he will be forced to spend the rest of his life in jail. In the remake, Bowden is able to handcuff Cady's ankle to a railing in the houseboat before it hits submerged rocks and begins to break apart. The two exchange blows with rocks, and Bowden savagely attempts to bring a large rock down on Cady's head. Before he can do so, though, Cady is washed out into the river, still cuffed to part of the houseboat, madly crying out and speaking in tongues, and Bowden then watches as Cady is pulled to the bottom of the river and drowns. =Differences between the book and the films= In the novel by John D. MacDonald, Sam Bowden testified against Max Cady back in World War II, since he witnessed the latter raping a fourteen-year-old girl when he was stationed in Australia. Cady was sentenced to life at a hard labor prison camp but was released thirteen years later. Cady nurtured his grudge against Bowden during his time which exacerbated due to his wife divorcing him and his only son dying in an accident. Unlike the films, Cady refers to Bowden as \\"lieutenant\\" instead of \\"counselor\\". Cady's background differs from the films in that he hails from West Virginia and has three brothers, all of whom were criminals (with one killed during a prison riot). They are not religious zealots like in the 1991 film. However, in the book, Cady is very much a violent psychopath who has no remorse for anything he does which includes, among many other despicable acts, shooting one of Bowden's children with a rifle. He is determined to kill Bowden \\"six times\\". Cady's fate in the book is being shot by Bowden as he flees from their home after attacking Bowden's wife. In the wee hours of the morning during a police search, his body is found in the woods behind the Bowden home. He died of excessive blood loss from two of Bowden's shots. Cultural impact *Mitchum's portrayal of Cady ranks number 28 on the American Film Institute's list of the top 50 movie villains of all time. *Cady was parodied in a 1993 episode of The Simpsons entitled \\"Cape Feare\\", in which Sideshow Bob stalks the Simpson family to a lake town to get revenge on Bart. *De Niro's portrayal of Cady was the inspiration for professional wrestler Dan Spivey's Waylon Mercy character. *Windham Rotunda, another professional wrestler, portrays a character named Bray Wyatt, who is also loosely modeled after De Niro's version of the character.

It features Detective Inspector Jack Spratt and his assistant, Sergeant Mary Mary. It is set in an alternate reality similar to that of his previous books: The Eyre Affair, Lost in a Good Book, The Well of Lost Plots and Something Rotten. According to Fforde, The Big Over Easy is the result of the book Caversham Heights featured in The Well of Lost Plots and includes a possible cameo appearance of the author's heroine Thursday Next, thus verifying this claim.'Big Over Easy' Special Features Section The book was the first novel Fforde wrote, however, he failed in its publication. It was massively re- written following the success of the Thursday Next novels. A follow-up, entitled The Fourth Bear, was published in July 2006. The book is satirical, based on many nursery rhymes, fables, and the like. The main character Jack Spratt is based on Jack Sprat, and the secondary character is Mary Mary, both from nursery rhymes. They investigate events such as the Three Little Pigs and Humpty Dumpty. People from such sources are known in the book as PDRs, \\"persons of dubious reality\\". Plot The book begins a short time after Easter, and no one can remember the last sunny day. Mary Mary, a detective sergeant from Basingstoke, is being transferred to Reading, Berkshire. She hopes to be paired up with Detective Chief Inspector Friedland Chymes, a member of the Detective's Guild with multiple appearances in the fictional magazine Amazing Crime Stories, but instead is paired up with Jack Spratt at the Nursery Crime Department, who is most famous for giant killing and for arresting the serial wife killer Bluebeard. Jack himself is living with his second wife, Madeleine, who moonlights as a photographer for certain prestigious events, and their five children: Pandora, Ben, Stevie, Jerome, and Megan. Madeleine is trying to rent the spare room in the house, but without much success. Jack's first wife could only eat fat and soon died. The day after Mary is transferred, Humpty Dumpty is discovered dead outside of his residence at Grimm's Road, apparently having fallen off the wall. Jack's Superintendent, Briggs, introduces him to Mary Mary at the crime scene. Jack interviews some possible witnesses, including Wee Willie Winkie, the insomniac neighbor; Ms. Hubbard, the owner of the boarding house where Humpty stayed; and Prometheus, the titan from Greek mythology, the latter of which Jack offers to rent the spare room in his house to. They all describe Humpty as a nice egg, who generally kept to himself. Upon inspection of Humpty's room, Jack and Mary find some odd clues: several shares in Spongg Footcare, Reading's Footcare empire, a picture of Humpty with a girlfriend in Vienna, and a 28-foot-long strand of hair. They later interview Laura, Humpty Dumpty's ex-wife. When Jack returns home, he tells his mother that the painting of the cow his mother wanted to sell was fake and he only received some beans in return. Mrs. Spratt retorts that she had the painting valued years ago and that the auctioneer probably knows how incredibly valuable it is. She is so upset that she throws the beans out of the window, and Jack sees them bury into the ground by themselves. There is another interview at a hospital called Saint Cerebellum's, this time with mad scientist doctor Quatt, and on their way to meeting her Jack notices the serial killer the 'Gingerbread Man'. Jack had been chasing the killer in previous cases and had to witness his colleague having his arms ripped off, only for the local newspaper, the Gadfly, to say that Chymes had caught the 'Gingerbread Man'. The interview with Dr. Quatt only reveals that she was Humpty's doctor. The conversation ends with Quatt showing Jack and Mary her latest experiment, a kitten's head sewn onto the body of a haddock. A few days later, Jack and Mary team up with Superintendent Baker, Ashley (an alien who can only speak binary code) and forensic scientist Gretel Kandlestyck-Maeker. Humpty Dumpty's wife is found to have committed suicide at the biscuit factory, but it is suspected that she has been murdered. The woman had jumped into a chocolate vat and was sliced by the machines, but when the employees stopped the machine, it was too late. The police of the Nursery Crime Division find a suicide note, but Mary concludes that it was written by his wife by comparing it to her diary. The proof of suicide also comes from a witnessing employee who saw her jump in, and no one pushed her. A few days later, the team are called in to investigate the recent death of Wee Willie Winkie. He was attacked with a large weapon, supposedly a broadsword, and a fifty-pound note was found in his hand, showing he was blackmailing the killer. Jack has his own problems at home when his mother calls him to sell a painting of a cow. Jack next interviews Randolph Spongg. Humpty had been investing in their failing businesses in hope of a breakthrough, which never came. The interview take place in Spongg's strange house, where doors lead nowhere, some rooms revolve around and go-kart races inside the house itself are held commonly every year. They next interview Lola Vavoom, who lives in the room next to Humpty Dumpty in the block of flats. At the end of the conversation she tells them that Humpty's shower had been running for a whole year, before his death. The two men break the door, and Baker finds a skeleton in the shower. The man is identified as Tom Thomm, son of a local flautist. His skin has been washed away by the shower water, and his skeleton is badly damaged. There are also five bullet holes in the shower curtain, three at waist height and two at foot height. Gretel says that when Tom was shot in the waist, he fell on the floor, where the two other shots hit his head. Jack then realises that Tom's killer was Humpty's wife: the three waist-height shots would have been head height for Humpty. His wife killed herself as she was sorry for what she had done. Jack is interviewed by colleagues, and Friedland Chymes appears and warns Spratt that if he does not give the case to Chymes, he will be fired. Jack accepts that that may happen, and refuses to give the case away. Later on, they have a meeting with another industrialist, Solomon Grundy, whose wife is Rapunzel. When she takes off her hat and her hair falls to the ground, Spratt and Mary remember the 28-foot- long strand of hair found in Humpty's bedroom. Solomon shows them into a room with an abnormally large amount of security: a person going in has to wear no shoes in case of being detected. In the centre of the room is a puzzle piece, the sacred gonga, held in unbreakable glass. It has magic powers which he reveals to Jack and Mary by putting them on each side of the room. When Jack thinks of a number, Mary says it out loud. This was so amazing that Solomon decided to put it on display for everyone in Reading. When an inspector is put in charge of watching Spratt and the others, Humpty's car, a Ford Zephyr, is found. As the car is about to be taken away, Jack realises that the front headlight has been removed and there is a wire feeding through it. He orders everyone to run away and the car explodes. Spratt and Mary then interview a woman who was divorced from Humpty. The woman claims that she killed Humpty out of jealousy by putting three poisonous tablets in his coffee. Jack then tells her that Humpty was shot, not poisoned, and that she is therefore innocent. When Jack returns home, he notices a huge crowd of people around the house. His mother says that the beans that were thrown from the window had grown into a huge stalk. She has even made arrangements for the magical celebrity, the Jellyman, to see it when he arrives in Reading. Jack is told by Gretel that Humpty Dumpty was shot by someone from behind, which smashed through his shell and burst the albumen, sending a shock which cracked the whole egg. When Mary, Spratt and the inspector enter Humpty's house, they wonder how Humpty got his money: he had no proper job and all he did was invest in failing companies. Their question is answered when they discover on the sofa a goose that lays golden eggs. On a further inspection, a giant verruca is found on another sofa. Jack then remembers a strange doctor, Horatio Carbuncle, who always made living things like the verruca. He killed Humpty Dumpty because he was investing in a company which got rid of verrucas. Humpty's wife killed herself because she thought that she had killed him, and Wee Willie Winkie was killed because he was blackmailing him. Jack is not sure about Tom, but thought the evidence is good enough. Mary then calls him into the next room and shows him the body of Carbuncle, shot dead. Jack then remembers the verruca and the puzzle piece. If Randolph was the killer, he would have the best motive so that he could put the verruca under the floor of Solomon's room. Hundreds of people would come in bare-footed to see the puzzle piece, and the verruca would give off a gas which would infect all the people's feet with verrucas. They would turn to the only foot care product, made by Randolph Spongg, and the failing company would make thousands. Jack is told that the man who shot Humpty was employed by Solomon Grundy, but Jack knows that Solomon is not the killer and sets off to find the real one, Randolph Spongg. Arriving at the house, the butler asks him to remove his mobile. The room becomes strange and starts to revolve. Jack enters a normal room with a mirror next, but he cannot see himself in the reflection. He sees Randolph and Lola come out of a trapdoor, and turns round, but sees no one. Randolph explains that this is his magic. Lola says that she is happy that Humpty is dead in the Ford Zephyr and reveals that she loves Randolph. Behind the two, the butler comes out of the trapdoor, but to Jack's surprise the butler is behind him. Jack is confused as he is standing in front of a mirror and cannot see his reflection, but that of Randolph and Lola, and the butler is the only one with a reflection. Randolph puts a sandwich with tin foil inside on a table and shines a lamp on it. He explains that the sandwich will crumple up under the heat, and when the corners of the tin foil touch, the house will explode. When they leave, Jack realises that it is not a mirror at all, but glass. He breaks it and finds a room on the other side, made exactly backwards. The butler had a twin brother who appeared on the other side, looking like he had a reflection. Jack stops the bomb, but the killers escape in a plane. After talking to Mary, he thinks that the car bomb was not intended for them, but for Humpty. He gets this idea because Lola said that Humpty died in the Zephyr, so was hoping he would be killed in it. Moments later, Jack is informed by Gretel that Humpty survived the shot, and that instead, he hatched, because Dr. Quatt secretly fecundated him in vitro. The team are thrown into confusion as they try to find a giant chicken which they think Humpty hatched into. Spratt and Mary then return to his house to attend the arrival of 'his eminence' the Jellyman. When he looks at the stalk, Jack has an urge to climb it. The only people in the house are a few police officers, Spratt, Mary, the Jellyman, Madeleine and their children. The few police officers stationed outside the house are alerted, and one by one, a strange creature kills them all. The monster bursts into the house in an attempt to kill the Jellyman. Jack leads him outside and climbs the stalk, followed by the beast. When they are high up in the sky, the monster rips Jack off and he falls all the way through the garden shed. When Jack regains consciousness, he sees a chainsaw. He is reminded of the axe and takes it and begins hacking down the beanstalk, aiming for the beast to fall down. It jumps onto him and tries to kill him, but a voice behind it makes it stop. Dr. Quatt appears in front of Jack and tells him that she is the killer, whose aim was to kill the Jellyman all along. She is about to kill Jack, but Mary knocks her unconscious. The monster runs to her aid, picking her up and running away. Mary tries to kill them, but Jack tells her not to bother. The beanstalk topples over from when Jack tried to cut it down, crushing the monster and Dr. Quatt. The end of the book is the explanation. Scientists take away the goose that lays golden eggs and cut it open to find out what makes it lay these eggs, but are disappointed to find only find a normal goose's insides. Jack explains to Mary that Humpty, although a good egg, had many friends and many enemies. His previous wife thought she killed him by poison, his wife thought she killed him by shooting him in the shower, Solomon Grundy thought he killed him by hiring a man to shoot him, Randolph Spongg and Lola Vavoom thought they killed him with a car bomb. But the real killer was Dr. Quatt, who injected him with the monster when he was having his appointments with her. Humpty's wife killed herself because she thought she killed him. Wee Willie Winkie saw Humpty hatch and knew it was her and blackmailed her. She made the monster follow her, and when she met him, the beast killed him with its claw. Her plan was to kill the Jellyman and used Humpty as a host to create the monster. She only wanted to kill one person, but a lot of others were the victim of her powerful, and short wrath.

Release details *11 July 2005, Hodder & Stoughton Ltd, , hardback Critical reception Reviewing the book for UK Sunday newspaper The Observer, Peter Guttridge began by writing, \\"I'm not sure what it says about the mystery genre that pretty much the only unflawed, untroubled, morally unambiguous policeman around is a nursery rhyme character\\". He added, \\"Now humour is notoriously subjective […]. And, indeed, when Fforde wrote the first version of this novel in 1994 - he called it Who Killed Humpty Dumpty? - it was rejected by every publisher he sent it to. But I love it. The Big Over Easy is great not just because it's very funny (albeit with some excruciating puns) but also because it works properly as a whodunit. Although I was wrong to say Spratt is untroubled. As a conflation of three nursery rhyme Jacks, he has several 'issues' to deal with, including the need for a fat-free diet and a strong compulsion to kill giants.\\" Guttridge concluded his review saying simply, \\"Comic genius\\". Reviewing the audiobook edition, read by Simon Prebble, Publishers Weekly found that, \\"Despite its many virtues, this is probably Fforde's weakest novel, lacking the literary sophistication of the Thursday Next books. But Prebble's performance easily makes this Fforde's best audiobook to date\\".

The Shipra, also known as the Kshipra, is a river in Madhya Pradesh state of central India. The river rises in the North of Dhar district, and flows north across the Malwa Plateau to join the Chambal River at the MP-Rajasthan boundary in Mandsaur district. It is one of the sacred rivers in Hinduism. The holy city of Ujjain is situated on its east bank. Every 12 years, the Sinhastha fair (Kumbh Mela) takes place on the city's elaborate riverside ghats, as do yearly celebrations of the river goddess Kshipra. There are hundreds of Hindu shrines along the banks of the river Shipra. Shipra is a perennial river. Earlier there used to be plenty of water in the river. Now the river stops flowing a couple of months after the monsoon. With this reference, the word Shipra is used as a symbol of \\"purity\\" (of soul, emotions, body, etc.) or \\"chastity\\" or \\"clarity\\". The Puranas, or ancient Hindu texts, also suggest that the Shipra originated from the heart of Varaha, Lord Vishnu's incarnation as a boar. Also on the banks of the Shipra is Sage Sandipani’s ashram or hermitage where the blue god, Krishna, Lord Vishnu's eighth incarnation, had studied.

Upon discovering his noble lineage, his slave master Thomas Foster, began referring to him as \\"Prince\\", a title he kept until his final days. After spending 40 years in slavery, he was freed in 1828 by order of U.S. President John Quincy Adams and Secretary of State Henry Clay after the Sultan of Morocco requested his release. Life Abdul-Rahman ibn Ibrahim Sori was a Torodbe Muslim ruler (Emir) who was born in 1762 in the city of Timbo, now located in Guinea. His father, Almami Ibrahim Sori, consolidated the Islamic confederation of Futa Jallon in 1776, with Timbo as its capital, where Abdul Rahman lived and studied. \\"He was learned in the Islamic sciences and could speak at least 4 different African languages, in addition to Arabic and English, and in 1781, after returning from study in the renowned city of learning-Timbuktu, Abd'r-Rahman joined the armies of his father.\\" At age 26, he was made an Emir of one of the regiments that conquered the lands of the Bambara and in 1788 his father \\"made him the head of a 2000 men army whose mission was to protect the coast and strengthen their economic interest in the region. It was during this military campaign that Abd'r-Rahman was captured and enslaved.\\" by other Africans. He was sold to the British who brought him to Natchez, Mississippi where he labored on the cotton plantation of Thomas Foster for more than thirty-eight years before gaining his freedom. In 1794 he married Isabella, another slave of Foster's, and eventually fathered a large family: five sons and four daughters. By using his knowledge of growing cotton in Futa Jallon, Abdul-Rahman rose to a position of authority on the plantation and became the de facto foreman. This granted him the opportunity to grow his own vegetable garden and sell at the local market. During this time, he met an old acquaintance, Dr. John Cox, an Irish surgeon who had served on an English ship, and had become the first white man to reach Timbo after being abandoned by his ship and then falling ill. Cox stayed ashore for six months and was taken in by Abdul-Rahman's family, where he was tasked to teach Abdul-Rahman English. Cox appealed to Foster to sell his \\"Prince\\" so he could return to Africa. However, Foster would not budge, since he viewed Abdul-Rahman as indispensable to the Foster farm. Dr. Cox continued, until his death in 1816, to seek Ibrahim's freedom, to no avail. After Cox died, his son continued the cause to free Abdul-Rahman. In 1826, Abdul-Rahman wrote a letter to his relatives in Africa. A local newspaperman, Andrew Marschalk, who was Dutch, sent the letter to United States Senator Thomas Reed from Mississippi, who was in town at the time, and Reed forwarded it to the U.S. Consulate in Morocco. Since Abdul-Rahman wrote in Arabic, Marschalk and the U.S. government assumed that he was a Moor. After the Sultan of Morocco Abderrahmane read the letter, he asked President Adams and Secretary of State Henry Clay to release Abdul- Rahman. In 1829, Thomas Foster agreed to the release of Abdul-Rahman, without payment, with the stipulation that he return to Africa and not live as a free man in America. Before leaving the US, Abdul-Rahman and his wife went to various states and Washington, D.C. where he met with President Adams in person. He solicited donations, through the press, personal appearances, the American Colonization Society and politicians, to free his family back in Mississippi. Word got back to Foster, who considered this a breach of the agreement. Abdul-Rahman's actions and freedom were also used against President John Quincy Adams by future president Andrew Jackson during the presidential election. After ten months, Abdul-Rahman and Isabella had raised only half the funds to free their children, and instead left for Monrovia, Liberia, without their children. He lived for four months before contracting a fever and died at the age of 67. He never saw Fouta Djallon or his children again. The funds that Abdul-Rahman and Isabella raised only bought the freedom of two sons and their families. They were reunited with Isabella in Monrovia. Thomas Foster died the same year as Abdul-Rahman. Foster's estate, including Abdul-Rahman's other children and grandchildren, was divided among Foster's heirs and scattered across Mississippi and the South. Abdul-Rahman's descendants still reside in Monrovia and in Natchez Mississippi United States. In 2006, Abdul- Rahman's descendants gathered for a family reunion at Foster's Field. Legacy Abdul-Rahman (Prince Sori), wrote two autobiographies. A drawing of him is displayed in the Library of Congress, a roadmap which one can say was left for his descendants to follow as they reconnect to the Royal lineages. Prince Sori's legacy stretches from Natchez Mississippi to Monrovia Liberia and with the advancements of DNA testing, his descendants have been able to connect with each other, such as his great-grandchildren Dr. Artemus Gaye of Monrovia and Karen Chatman of Natchez Mississippi. Dr. Gaye and Karen Chatman of Natchez, Mississippi, descendants of Abdul-Rahman: uses the Royal titles and lineage which were inherited from Prince Sori and recognized by both the United States and International Government officials, to promote charitable organizations. Chatman has teamed with both the Obama Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to heighten awareness of global humanitarian issues. Chatman, a United States born citizen and a renowned humanitarian, founded three separate foundations dedicated to humanitarian issues. The Princess Karen Foundation of Global and Ancestry Development, dedicated to utilizing DNA and Gene Therapy to finding a cure for incurable diseases. The Global Paths Foundation was founded in 2014, which encourages unity amongst children of all races between the ages fourteen to eighteen and Think Pink for a Cure. Chatman is the author of \\"Chained Free.\\" In 1968, James Register, who had been born in Natchez, wrote the first full account of Abdul-Rahman's life in his book Jallon: Arabic Prince of Old Natchez (1788 - 1828). In 1977, history professor Terry Alford further documented the life of Abdul-Rahman in his book Prince Among Slaves. In Prince Among Slaves, Alford writes: In 2007, Andrea Kalin directed Prince Among Slaves, a film portraying the life of Abdul-Rahman, narrated by Mos Def.

Urania Observatory (German: Urania Sternwarte) was built in 1909 according to the plans of Art Nouveau style architect Max Fabiani (a student of Otto Wagner) at the outlet of the Wien River and was opened in 1910 by Franz Joseph I of Austria as an educational facility with a public observatory. It was named after the Muse Urania who represents Astronomy. During World War II, the Urania was severely damaged and the dome with the observatory was totally destroyed. After its reconstruction, it was reopened in 1957. The observatory itself has been continually improved technically over the years. Though it now serves different functions, the Urania continues to be a public observatory. Presently the Urania also has seminar rooms in which wide-ranging classes and lectures are given, a movie theater that screens at the annual Viennale movie festival and a puppet theater created originally by actor Hans Kraus. The Urania moreover contains a memorial room for the Kindertransport organized by the Dutch resistance fighter and humanitarian Mrs Gertruida Wijsmuller-Meijer, who early December 1938 managed to rescue the first 600 Jewish children from Vienna after direct negociations in Vienna with Adolf Eichmann.

Yizhar (), was an Israeli writer and politician. Biography Yizhar Smilansky was born in Rehovot to a family of writers. His great uncle was Israeli writer Moshe Smilansky.Moshe Smilansky The Institute for the Translation of Hebrew Literature His father, Zev Zass Smilensky, was also a writer. After the end of World War I, the family moved to Tel Aviv where Yizhar attended the Balfour school. The family returned to Rehovot when he was 11. After earning a degree in education from the Beit Hakerem Seminar in Jerusalem, Yizhar taught in Yavniel, Ben Shemen, Hulda, and Rehovot. He served as an intelligence officer in the Israel Defense Forces during the 1948 Arab- Israeli War. Yizhar married Naomi Wollman in 1942. They had three children, Yisrael (born 1942), Hila (born 1944), and Ze'ev (born 1954). Literary career From the end of the 1930s to the 1950s, Yizhar published short novellas, among them Ephraim Goes Back to Alfalfa, On the Edge of the Negev, The Wood on the Hill, A Night Without Shootings, Journey to the Evening's Shores, Midnight Convoy, as well as several collections of short stories. His pen name was given to him by the poet and editor Yitzhak Lamdan, when in 1938 he published Yizhar's first story Ephraim Goes Back to Alfalfa in his literary journal Galleons. From then on, Yizhar signed his works with his pen name. In 1949, he published the novella Khirbet Khizeh, in which he described the fictional expulsion of Palestinian Arabs from their fictional village by the IDF during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. It became a best-seller and in 1964 was included in the Israeli high school curriculum.The price of return Haaretz, 10 December 2008 In 1978, a controversy arose after a dramatization of Khirbet Khizeh by director Ram Loevy was aired on Israeli television.Cultural Crossoads of the Levant Shapira has lamented that, despite the publishing of Yizhar's novella decades earlier, Benny Morris was able, when he published The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947–1949 in 1988, to announce \\"himself as the man who had laid bare the original sin of the State of Israel\\".Shapira, A Hirbet Hizah: Between Remembrance and Forgetting Jewish Social Studies Vol. 7, No. 1 In the late 1950s, his massive work Days of Ziklag appeared, comprising two volumes and more than a thousand pages. This work had a powerful impact on changing the outlook for Hebrew prose on the one hand, and \\"war literature\\" on the other. Although Yizhar remained in the public eye as an outstanding polemicist, he broke his decades-long literary silence only in 1992 with the publication of his novel, Mikdamot (Preliminaries). This was quickly followed by five additional new volumes of prose, both novels and collections of short stories, including Tsalhavim, Etsel Ha-Yam (At Sea), Tsedadiyim (Asides), and Malkomyah Yefehfiyah (Beautiful Malcolmia). His last work, Gilui Eliahu (Discovering Elijah), set in the period of the Yom Kippur War, was published in 1999 and later adapted for the stage. The play won first prize at the Acco Festival of Alternative Israeli Theatre in 2001. Yizhar also wrote stories for children in which he contended with the defining themes of his youth, as in Oran and Ange concerning the Israeli cultivation of citrus fruits; Uncle Moshe's Chariot, a memoir of the character of his famous great uncle Moshe Smilansky; and others. Academic career Yizhar was a professor of education at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1986-7 he was Visiting Writer at the Center for Jewish Studies at Harvard University. He was a lecturer at Levinsky College in Tel Aviv into the late 1990s.Yuval Jobani and Gideon Katz, In the Convoy and Alongside It: A Study of S. Yizhar’s Works on Education and Literature. Contemporary Jewry, 36(2), 2016, pp.203-224. Political career Yizhar was elected to the first Knesset in 1949, remaining a Knesset member until the 1955 elections. He returned to the Knesset in October 1956 as a replacement for Aharon Becker. In 1965 he defected to David Ben-Gurion's new Rafi party, but resigned from the Knesset on 20 February 1967. He subsequently joined Ben- Gurion's new National List and was given the symbolic 120th place on its list for the 1969 elections.National List 1969 list Israel Democracy Institute Literary style Yizhar's early work was influenced by Uri Nissan Gnessin. His knowledge of Israeli geology, geomorphology, climate, and flora is evident in his landscape descriptions and his emphasis on the relationship between person and place. Yizhar's use of language is unique. With his long sentences and combination of literary Hebrew and street jargon, he draws the reader into his heroes' stream of consciousness. Awards * In 1959, Yizhar was awarded the Israel Prize for his literary merits * In 1959, he was awarded the Brenner Prize for literature. * In 1960, he was awarded the Lamdan Prize for children's literature. * In 1991, he was awarded the Bialik Prize for literature. * In 2002, he received the annual Israeli EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture. * He is also the recipient of the David Ben-Gurion Award.

The strip first appeared in the University of Wisconsin–Madison The Daily Cardinal newspaper in 1988. Since April 25, 2011, Jim's Journal has run on \\"GoComics\\" featuring both new and classic comics. The strip On the flyleaf of the first Jim's Journal collection is a felt-pen drawing of a nondescript young man sitting at a desk and writing in a notebook. Above him are the words, \\"I'm Jim. This is the journal of my day-to-day life.\\" And that's just what the strip is: nuggets of experience, not processed by Jim, but merely recorded as he moves passively through his world. No context is provided, though anyone who's been to college, worked a minimum-wage job, or lived in a rundown apartment building can supply it. Jim and his friends muddle through school and a series of dead-end jobs, have vague dreams (never seriously attempted) of working in the entertainment business or the space program, and share thoughts such as \\"I don't think life is absurd or meaningless. I think it's funny.\\" In Jim's world, it is enough to simply exist, and order a pizza once in a while. The humor Dikkers' purpose was to parody the typical four-panel comic strip, creating a character-driven strip with a main character who had no discernible personality, observational humor that provided no insights, and no comic timing, just strips that ended without a gag, or sometimes without even a conclusion. Dikkers calls this style anti-humor, \\"creating humor by poking fun at other humor\\". (Dikkers, 1999) Characters =Jim= He is an almost completely passive person, speaking little and almost never initiating conversation, content to go to school or work, come home, and occasionally venture out in the company of his few friends. He is a keen observer, though he seems to lack the capacity to draw conclusions about what he sees. =Tony= Jim's college roommate, and later off-campus apartmentmate. Tony is impulsive, often trying out new lifestyles and hobbies, but his short attention span and low threshold of disappointment prevent him from making any major changes. He loves practical jokes, but lacks the knowhow for them to succeed, and appoints himself expert on many subjects, though his attention span for other peoples' interests is slight. Tony was the (stereo)typical college student: drinking and partying, trying to cram an entire semester's worth of work into a week, and hopelessly pursuing girls who dismissed him as immature. After college, he was unable to find a job that would let him use his economics degree. After a long tenure at his older brother's shoe store, he moved \\"up\\" to selling cable TV subscriptions over the phone. =Ruth= Jim met Ruth while working at McDonald's. She is cheerful and kind, if a bit overbearing, and easily the most mature and responsible character in the strip. She was made crew chief at McDonald's, and after graduation, found a job in her chosen field as a dental assistant. Late in the strip, she and Jim were married, though Jim never documented any change in their relationship before the wedding. Since then, she has devoted herself to the roles of wife, wage-earner and homemaker, and has been gently trying to influence Jim to be more ambitious. =Steve= Steve was brought into the strip as a third roommate when Jim and Tony moved into their off-campus apartment. He attended the same high school as Tony, a year behind him. Steve was intimidated by the college experience at first; it has never been made clear whether or not he graduated, nor what job he holds, if any. His fondness for junk food and junk TV led to an iconic strip panel, in which he sat in front of the TV eating cereal right out of the box. Steve strives to be intellectual and creative, without much success, but his native intelligence puts him ahead of Tony, who once tried to play a practical joke on him that fell utterly flat. At times, he exhibits some whimsy, climbing a tree \\"because it would be fun\\", or cracking jokes that no one gets except him. =Mr. Peterson= Jim's cat. Steve returned from his hometown with a kitten, whom he named Mr. Peterson for no known reason. When he attempted to have the cat neutered, Mr. Peterson was revealed to be a female, but her name was not changed. When the three roommates took separate apartments, she became Jim's cat by default. =Mark= Jim's college classmate, and co-worker at McDonald's. Mark is a typical 1990s pseudointellectual. When they met, Jim noted that Mark \\"always points out the dreary, hopeless aspect of everything.\\" Jim thought Mark might be trying to be funny, but also observes that in four years at McDonald's, Mark had never gotten a raise, which might be a source of his bitterness. He and Jim take a creative writing course in college. When Mark is absent one day, Jim observes that \\"the class was quiet without him.\\" Despite sounding off constantly, Mark objects to criticism of his own work, claiming that artistic expression should not be graded. =Mike= Another McDonald's co-worker. Cheerful and gifted with a genuine flair for comedy, he leaves McDonald's to do stand-up. When he breaks his leg, he welcomes the chance to incorporate it into his act, so he can \\"stop doing the fat-guy schtick.\\" =Dan= Jim's co-worker at the copy store. Dan is a quirky geek, more concerned with larger concepts such as time travel, which he thinks would be \\"neat\\", than with his own shortcomings. He brings burnt cookies to work, claiming that he likes them that way because it adds flavor. He welcomes guests to his squalid apartment and clears mounds of junk off the couch so they can sit to watch his videos. Later, he stands up to Joel, another co- worker, and the dispute ends with Joel's firing, prompting Dan to observe that \\"there is justice in the galaxy.\\" =Joel= Copy store co-worker. The source of his feud with Dan is never disclosed, although Joel's generally abrasive personality might have something to do with it. =Julie= Copy store co- worker. Apparently depressed to be working so far below her potential, Julie takes out her frustrations on Jim, once throwing a roll of tape at his head. Another time, she asked what she could do on her break. When Jim had no suggestion, she mused, \\"Maybe I'll drop dead.\\" =Brian= Copy store co- worker. Brian is a true slacker, doing as little as possible, showing no enthusiasm, and even smoking on the job. When Jim asks why he doesn't like working there, he replies, \\"It's not MY copy store -- I can only care so much.\\" Later, he quits without notice, reportedly one step ahead of being fired. =Steve the manager= Jim's first boss at McDonald's, characterized by his \\"odd reverence\\" for the company. Early on, he expressed great pride in Jim for mastering the task of heating fish fillet buns, but when Jim dropped a tray of hamburgers, he didn't speak to Jim the rest of the day. After Jim left McDonald's at the end of his freshman year, he snubbed Jim when they met outside the store. =Cheryl the manager= Steve's replacement. Friendlier and more accessible than Steve. Jim returned to McDonald's when she attempted to round up the disgruntled employees from Steve's tenure. =Hal the manager= Manager at the copy store. He makes occasional attempts to motivate his employees, such as letting them choose the radio station or bringing malted milks for the staff when they're overloaded with work. However, he once reminded the staff that being manager is \\"like working 24 hours a day.\\" When Dan was describing the similarities between ape and human social structure, Hal's entrance was perfectly timed to establish him as the alpha. Work Jim works a series of minimum wage jobs. He initially applied at McDonald's as a way of meeting people and filling downtime, and quit at the end of the school year. Early in his sophomore year, he was called back to McDonald's, then, after leaving college, applied at a bookstore, where he worked for a short time before being laid off. His longest-lasting job was at a copy store, where he once envisioned a bleak future as the manager. He then had another dead-end job at a grocery. We were never told what Jim's major was in college, and he has never expressed a desire to pursue any particular line of work. The impression is that Jim works because that's what people are supposed to do. Recreation Jim has no hobbies to speak of, only occasionally joining Tony or Steve in a game of basketball or billiards, or reading Trivial Pursuit answers for hours at a time.

His father, the surgeon John Monro, had been a prime mover in the foundation of the Edinburgh Medical School and had arranged Alexander's education in the hope that his son might become the first Professor of Anatomy in the new university medical school. After medical studies in Edinburgh, London, Paris and Leiden, Alexander Monro returned to Edinburgh, and pursued a career as a surgeon and anatomy teacher. With the support of his father and the patronage of the Edinburgh Lord Provost George Drummond, Alexander Monro was appointed foundation Professor of Anatomy at the University of Edinburgh. His lectures, delivered in English, rather than the conventional Latin, proved popular with students and his qualities as a teacher contributed to the success and reputation of the Edinburgh medical school. He is known as Alexander Monro primus to distinguish him from his son Alexander Monro secundus and his grandson Alexander Monro tertius, who both followed him in the chair of anatomy. These three Monros between them held the Edinburgh University Chair of Anatomy for 126 years. Early life and education Alexander Monro was the son of John Monro and his wife Jean Forbes, who was his first cousin. John Monro was a Monro of Auchenbowie, a cadet branch of Clan Munro, descended from the Monros of Foulis. John Monro was a military surgeon and his son Alexander was born in London while he was on military duty there. When Alexander was three the family returned to Edinburgh, where John Monro took great care with his son's education. He had him instructed in Latin, Greek and French, and in philosophy, arithmetic and book-keeping. Alexander attended classes at the University of Edinburgh between 1710 and 1713 but did not graduate.Guerrini, A. (23 September 2004). Monro, Alexander, primus (1697–1767), surgeon and anatomist. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-18964 (Subscription required) He was then bound apprentice to his father, who was by now in practice as a surgeon in Edinburgh. During this apprenticeship he also attended courses in botany delivered by George Preston, courses in chemistry by Dr James Crawford and anatomy dissections at Surgeons Hall by Messers Robert Eliot, Adam Drummond and John McGill.  Studies in London, Paris and Leiden  In 1717 on completion of his apprenticeship, Alexander Munro was sent to London to study anatomy under William Cheselden, the famous surgeon who was a renowned teacher and a skilful demonstrator. A lasting friendship was formed between the two men. To gain as much experience as possible Monro lodged in the house of an apothecary and visited patients with him. He also attended lectures by the theologian and mathematician William Whiston and the physicist Francis Hauksbee on experimental philosophy. He made dissections of the human body and of various animals and demonstrated a natural aptitude for this work. His career was nearly cut short as a result of a scratch on the hand inflicted while he was dissecting the suppurated lung of a subject, known to have phthisis (tuberculosis). His mentor and friend, the Scots born accoucheur and anatomist James Douglas was concerned that he would lose the arm as a result of the soft tissue infection which developed. Monro took an active part in discussions, and in one of his papers first sketched his \\"Account of the Bones in General\\". This would form the basis of his later textbook on osteology. Before he left London he sent home to his father some of his anatomical specimens. His father showed these to members of the Royal College of Physicians and the Incorporation of Surgeons. They were so impressed with the quality of these dissections that Adam Drummond, on seeing them, indicated that would resign his share of the professorship of anatomy in favour of Monro. In the spring of 1718, Alexander Monro primus went to Paris where attended lectures on botany in the Jardin du Roy. He walked the wards of the hospitals including Hotel Dieu where he attended a course of anatomy given by Bourquet. He performed operations under the direction of Thibaut and had instruction in midwifery from Gregoire, in bandaging from Cesau, and in botany from Pierre-Jean-Baptiste Chomel. On 16 November 1718, Monro entered as a student of Leiden University to study under Herman Boerhaave, the great physician and teacher, who lectured on the theory and practice of physic. On Boerhaave's recommendation he visited Frederik Ruysch, professor of Anatomy at Amsterdam, where he saw Ruysch's large collection of anatomical dissections and learned from him techniques of preservation of anatomical specimens. Patients from Scotland who came to consult Boerhaave in Leiden were often put under Monro's care. Like many Scottish students at Leiden he did not sit the examinations for the degree of MD.  Professor of Anatomy  On his return to Edinburgh in the autumn of 1719, Monro sat the four part examination to become a Freeman (Fellow) of the Incorporation of Surgeons and was admitted as a Fellow on 19 November. Adam Drummond then fulfilled his promise of resigning his professorship, and John M'Gill did likewise. They also gave a recommendation in favour of Monro to the Town Council, the patrons of the University. This was backed by the Incorporation of Surgeons, and on 22 January 1720 the Council appointed Monro Professor of Anatomy with a salary of £15 sterling, this modest sum being supplemented by the students' fees of three guineas a head. Monro's original appointment as professor was only at the pleasure of the Town Council, who at that time administered the University or Town's College. In 1722, encouraged by his success, Monro applied to the Council for permanent status, and although the Council had as lately as August 1719 reaffirmed the principle that regentships and professorships were to be held at their pleasure, they now departed from this and on 14 March 1722, nominated Alexander Monro sole Professor of Anatomy in the City and College. Until 1725, Monro continued to lecture in the old Surgeons' Hall on the south side of Surgeons' Square. The popularity of his teaching had led to an increased demand for cadavers for dissection. Despite the fact that Monro had publicly declared his \\"...Abhorrence for the vile, abominable and most inhumane Crime of stealing human bodies out of their graves...\\" public anger was directed against anatomists. This led to public demonstrations and riots which Monro felt endangered him and his collection of dissected specimens. Monro appealed to the Town Council to allow him to lecture and perform anatomical demonstrations within the relative safety of the University. The Council agreed and Monro moved from Surgeons Hall to the University of Edinburgh, being formally inaugurated to the university chair on 3 November 1725. The initial medical faculty was completed in February 1726 with the appointment of John Rutherford and John Innes as Professors of the Practice of Physic, Andrew St Clair as Professor of the Institutes of Theory of Medicine, Andrew Plummer as professor of Chemistry, and John Gibson as professor of Midwifery.  Establishing a teaching hospital  John Monro's vision of the new Edinburgh medical school was based on the Leiden model of a medical faculty within a university and with an associated teaching hospital. In 1721 Alexander Monro circulated a pamphlet setting out the case for this hospital. Lord Provost George Drummond helped secure financial backing from local surgeons, physicians, wealthy citizens and Church of Scotland parishes. Monro and the committee of donors established this hospital in August 1729 in a house in Robertson's Close, rented from the university. This had six beds where the sick poor could be treated and provide clinical teaching for medical students. This 'Hospital for the Sick Poor' or 'Little House' as it was known was the origin of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. In 1736 it received a Royal Charter from King George II, which conferred the 'Royal' designation. With the growth of the new medical school this soon became too small for purpose and a new teaching hospital was commissioned, designed by the leading architect William Adam. The original hospital moved in 1741 and the new hospital was finally completed in 1745. Among the first admissions to the completed hospital were casualties from the Battle of Prestonpans on 21 September 1745. Monro primus, a staunch Hanoverian, treated the wounded of both sides at the battlefield and afterwards in the new Royal Infirmary.  The Anatomy of the Human Bones  At the end of 1726, Monro published his only major textbook The Anatomy of the Human Bones, which went through eight editions in his lifetime and a further three after his death. Later editions included a description of The Anatomy of the Human Nerves. It was translated into most European languages and in 1759 a French folio edition was published in Paris with elegant engravings by Joseph Sue, Professor of Anatomy to the Royal Schools of Surgery and to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in Paris. Thomas Thomson wrote that the book \\"may be considered as the completion on the subject, since it would be exceedingly difficult and perfectly unnecessary to introduce any improvements upon the descriptions which Dr Monro has given.\\" The great reputation attained by Monro's work did much to increase the fame of the new school of medicine on Edinburgh. In 1764, he resigned his professorship, but continued to give clinical lectures at the hospital. In the same year, he published An Account of the Inoculation of Small-pox in Scotland.  Learned societies  As a Freeman (or Fellow) of the Incorporation of Surgeons, Monro continued his surgical practice alongside anatomy teaching. Like all three generations, Monro primus was a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. Monro secundus and Monro tertius were also Presidents of the RCPE. Monro was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, on 27 June 1723, on the recommendation of William Cheseldon. In 1731 Monro was the driving force in the foundation of the Society for the Improvement of Medical Knowledge, and he became its first secretary. The following year the Society began to publish Medical Essays and Observations with Monro as editor. A total of six volumes were published consisting of case reports from around the British Isles, reviews of the literature and book reviews, with most of the reviews being written by Monro himself. These were popular and important in their day, being translated into French, German and Dutch. Medical Essays and Observations regarded as the first regular medical journal in Britain and one of the first in the world It was also the first medical journal to introduce anonymised peer review. This innovative publication helped to establish Monro as a major figure of the Scottish Enlightenment. After a period of inactivity the society was reformed as the Philosophical Society, which also lapsed but was revived in 1752 with Monro and the philosopher David Hume as joint secretaries. In 1783 the Philosophical Society received a Royal Charter to become the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Monro was also a member of the Select Society , which had been founded in 1754 by the painter Allan Ramsay \\"...to discover the most effectual methods of promoting the good of the country.\\"Scots Magazine 3 March 1755. pp. 14–15 In 1765 Monro published an account of the extent of inoculation against smallpox in Scotland, in which he estimated that only 88 of Scotland's doctors, out of an estimated 270, had taken up the procedure and had inoculated a total of 5,554 people. Family and later life In 1725, he married Isabella MacDonald (1694 -1774), third daughter of Sir Donald MacDonald of Sleat. They had three sons and a daughter. The eldest son John Monro (1725-1789) became an advocate and then procurator Fiscal to the High Court of Admiralty. He inherited Achenbowie to become 5th of Auchenbowie. The second son Donald Monro (1727–1802) graduated MD and became Physician-General to the army, physician to St George's Hospital, London and a Fellow of the Royal Society. The third son Alexander Monro secundus (1733–1817) succeeded his father as Professor of anatomy at the University of Edinburgh. For Margaret (d1802) his only surviving daughter Monro primus wrote An essay on female conduct 'intended to improve her education. From 1730 Monro lived in a large flat on the south side of the Lawnmarket, moving in 1750 to Covenant Close off the High Street. He died at his home in Covenant Close, Edinburgh of rectal cancer on 10 July 1767. He is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard in the centre of Edinburgh with his wife and son, Alexander secundus.

There, while enslaved for the remainder of his life, he wrote a series of works of history and theology, including a posthumously famous autobiography.  Biography  Omar ibn Said was born in present-day Senegal in Futa Toro, a region along the Middle Senegal River in West Africa, to a wealthy family. He was an Islamic scholar and a Fula who spent 25 years of his life studying with prominent Muslim scholars, learning subjects ranging from arithmetic to theology in Africa. In 1807, he was captured during a military conflict, enslaved and taken across the Atlantic Ocean to the United States. He escaped from a cruel master in Charleston, South Carolina, and journeyed to Fayetteville, North Carolina. There he was recaptured and later sold to James Owen. Said lived into his mid- nineties and was still enslaved at the time of his death in 1864. He was buried in Bladen County, North Carolina. Omar ibn Sa'id was also known as Uncle Moreau and Prince Omeroh. Omar ibn Said describing his two slave masters Although Omar was converted to Christianity on December 3, 1820, there are dedications to Muhammad written in his Bible, and a card dated 1857 on which he wrote Surat An-Nasr, a short sura which refers to the conversion of non- Muslims to Islam 'in multitudes.' The back of this card contains another person's handwriting in English misidentifying the sura as the Lord's Prayer and attesting to Omar's status as a good Christian. Additionally, while others writing on Omar's behalf identified him as a Christian, his own autobiography and other writings offer more of an ambiguous position. In the autobiography, he still offers praise to Muhammad when describing his life in his own country; his references to \\"Jesus the Messiah\\" in fact parallel Quranic descriptions of Jesus (who is called المسيح 'the Messiah' a total of eleven times in the Quran), and descriptions of Jesus as 'our lord/master' ( ') employ the typical Islamic honorific for prophets and is not to be confused with Lord ( '); and description of Jesus as 'bringing grace and truth' (a reference to John 1:14) is equally appropriate to the conception of Jesus in Islam. Literary analysis of Said’s autobiography suggests that he wrote it for two audiences, the white literates who sought to exploit his conversion to Christianity and Muslim readers who would recognize Qur'anic literary devices and subtext and understand his position as a fellow Muslim living under persecution. In a letter written to Sheikh Hunter regarding the autobiography, he apologized for forgetting the \\"talk\\" of his homeland and ended the letter saying: \\"O my brothers, do not blame me,\\" with the knowledge that Hunter would require Arabic-speaking translators to read the message. Scholar Basima Kamel Shaheen argues that Said’s spiritual ambiguity may have been purposefully cultivated to impress upon a wide readership the injustices of slavery. Manuscripts Surat Al-Mulk from the Qur'an, copied by Omar ibn Sa'id in a rudimentary Fulani script. Omar ibn Said is widely known for fourteen manuscripts that he wrote in Arabic. Out of all of his Arabic manuscripts, he is best known for his autobiographical essay, The Life of Omar Ibn Said, written in 1831. It describes some of the events of his life and includes reflections on his steadfast adherence to Islam and his openness towards other \\"God-fearing\\" people. On the surface, the document may appear to be tolerant towards slavery; however, Said begins it with Surat Al-Mulk, a chapter from the Qur'an, which states that only God has sovereignty over human beings. The manuscript is the only known Arabic autobiography by a slave in America. It was sold within a collection of Sa'id's documents between private collectors prior to its acquisition by the Library of Congress in 2017. It has since been treated for preservation and made viewable online. Most of Said's other work consisted of Islamic manuscripts in Arabic, including a handwritten copy of some short chapters (surat) from the Qur'an that are now part of the North Carolina Collection in the Wilson Library at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Transcribing from memory, ibn Said made some mistakes in his work, notably at the start of Surat An-Nasr. His Bible, a translation into Arabic published by a missionary society, which has notations in Arabic by Omar, is part of the rare books collection at Davidson College.Davidson College Archives Omar Ibn Sayyid Sa'id was also the author of a letter, dated 1819, addressed to James Owen's brother, Major John Owen, written in Arabic and containing numerous Quranic references (including from the above-mentioned Surat Al-Mulk), which also includes several geometric symbols and shapes which point to its possible esoteric intentions. This letter, currently housed in Andover Theological Seminary, is reprinted in Allen Austin's African Muslims in Antebellum America: A Sourcebook.

It is located in the middle of the Magelang Regency, between Mount Merbabu and Mount Sumbing in Central Java Province, Indonesia. Magelang is located 43 km north of Yogyakarta, 15 km north of Mungkid and 75 km south of Semarang, the capital of Central Java. History The Magelang town hall in 1925–1936 Magelang was established on 11 April 907. Magelang was then known as a village called Mantyasih, which is now known as Meteseh.According to a local act number 6 (1989) There are three stele of historical importance in Magelang, namely Poh, Gilikan and Mantyasih, all of which are written on a plate of copper. Poh and Mantyasih were written under the rule of King Balitung of Mataram Kingdom. In those stele, the villages of Mantyasih and Glanggang were mentioned. They became Meteseh and Magelang respectively. In Mantyasih stele, it mentioned the name of King Watukura Dyah Balitung, as well as 829 Çaka bulan Çaitra tanggal 11 Paro-Gelap Paringkelan Tungle, Pasaran Umanis hari Senais Sçara atau Sabtu, which means Saturday Legi, 11 April 907. The village Mantyasih was made by the king as tax-free village which was led by a patih (similar to Prime Minister nowadays). Also mentioned are Mount Susundara and Mount Wukir Sumbing which is now known as Mount Sindoro and Mount Sumbing. When Britain colonised Magelang in the eighteenth century, Magelang became the seat of the government and was made to the same level as a regency with Mas Ngabehi Danukromo as its first leader (Bupati). Mas Ngabehi Danukromo built Alun-Alun (town square), bupati residence and a mosque. Magelang became the capital of Karesidenan Kedu in 1818. After the Dutch defeated the British, Magelang was made as the central of economy because its strategic location. The Dutch government built drinking water tower (known locally as Menara Air Minum) in 1918 which provides the city with water. Electricity became available in 1927. The roads were remade using asphalt. The city has historically been a military post, dating back to the Dutch East Indies colonial era. It subsequently acted as an army stronghold for Indonesian pro-independence movements against the Dutch government during the resistance period. Currently, it is a host of two military landmarks: The National Military Academy, and the only military- associated school, Taruna Nusantara. Journalist Taichiro Kaijimura announced on 12 May 2007 the discovery of 30 Netherlands government documents submitted to the Tokyo tribunal as an evidence of a forced massed prostitution incident by the Japanese army in 1944 in Magelang.Files: Females forced into sexual servitude in wartime Indonesia http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi- bin/nn20070512a6.html After the independence of Indonesia, Magelang became kotapraja (same level as a district) and then kotamadya (same level as city). Geography Magelang Central Park Street View Magelang City is a city which is located in a fertile agricultural area and one of the most densely populated regions on Central Java. Magelang City has two borders. The western border is Progo River and the Eastern Boones Elo River. The city is divided into three districts and several sub-districts. Magelang Utara (North Magelang): * Kramat Utara * Kramat Selatan * Kedungsari * Wates * Potrobangsan Magelang Tengah (Central Magelang): * Magelang * Cacaban * Kemirirejo * Gelangan * Panjang * Rejowinangun Utara Magelang Selatan (South Magelang): * Tidar Utara * Tidar Selatan * Rejowinangun Selatan * Magersari * Jurangombo Utara * Jurangombo Selatan =Climate= Demography The composition of demography based on its religion and belief, Magelang people has varied and different belief and religion. Majority of Magelang citizen are Muslim, but there are minority groups such as Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Confucianism, and there are also spiritualism and traditional Javanese belief. As of February 2010, Magelang has a total population of 118,227. Magelang's population was 58,311 men (49% of the total population) and 59,916 women (51% of the total population). Places of interest Magelang Big Stove - Water Container Magelang Big Stove - Water Container - 1925 =Temples= Magelang is the closest major town to Borobudur, a ninth-century Buddhist monument located about north-west of Yogyakarta. The Canggal Temple, also located in the Magelang regency, has a Sanskrit transcription bearing the name of the first Mataram Kingdom ruler, Sanjaya. =Rafting= There is white water rafting on the Elo River, located in the district of Magelang. Elo river disgorges from Mount Merbabu, Mount Telomoyo and Mount Ungaran, so it is not affected by the flow of volcanic material from Mount Merapi. The river is ideal for white water rafting because the characters of flow and flooding are relatively stable, so it is relatively safe to be forded in both the dry and rainy seasons. Running rafting chosen difficulty level (grade) maximum III + and suitable for families. The track has a length of about 12.5 km and reached in 2.5 – 3 hours rafting. =Museums= A number of the town's buildings from the Dutch East Indies era have become heritage landmarks. The Karesidenan Kedu building, is now known as Museum Pangeran Diponegoro, where Prince Diponegoro was arrested by the Dutch colonial government during the Java War (1825–1830). The chair on which the Prince sat remains in the museum. A fingernail, believed to be Diponegoro's, remains on the arm of the chair. A statue in his honour stands in Magelang's town square. =Jalan Pemuda= Jalan Pemuda (\\"Youth Street\\") is Magelang's Pecinan (Chinatown). The one-way road is the centre of business and includes shops, a minimarket, and restaurants. The road, running along a former railroad, is divided with a narrow section reserved for rickshawss. =Alun-alun (Town Square)= The Alun-alun or town square is located in the city centre. The area has the Matahari and Gardena department stores, Magelang's only cinema, to the north the Trio Plaza and the BCA tower; in the south a police station, the BPD Bank building, and a Confucian temple along Jalan Pemuda. In the west, is city's largest mosque, locally known as Kauman. Within the vicinity of the town square is a watertower, and also a statue of Diponegoro riding a horse. =Sports= There are a number of sport venues in Magelang. In 2006, for example, a golf course was opened: the Borobudur International Golf and Country Club. The Abu Bakrin football stadium is located on Jl. Tidar, which is near the golf course. Besides, the Gedung Olah Raga \\"Samapta\\" is a popular sport venue in the sub- district of North Magelang. The area is being developed because of the plan to raise its status to Sport Centre of the Central Java. It is located in the east of the Progo river. Stadion Gemilang Kabupaten Magelang is located in the town of Blondo. It has a capacity of 15,000 and it is used mostly for football matches. =Parks= A 28-hectare park, Kyai Langgeng, is located at Cempaka Street approximately one kilometer south of the city centre. Research is undertaken on rare plant species here. The park has a playground for children and their families. The river Progo is accessible from this park. Badaan park is located in Jalan Pahlawan (Pahlawan Road) and one of two parks in Magelang. The park is smaller than Kyai Langgeng and mostly regarded as a children's playground. There are animal statues within the park such as rhino the animal used as its namesake, elephant and giraffe. Hawkers sell a variety of bakso (Meat Balls) in the vicinity of the park. =Mount Tidar= Mount Tidar is located in Magersari, South Magelang and located within the complex of Military Academy (Akmil). Here lies the remains of Syekh Subakir from Iran. =Universities= Although Magelang City is a small city, it has a number of universities or academy or colleges. At least, there are six universities located in Magelang City such as Military Academy of Magelang (AKMIL), Muhammadiyah University of Magelang (UMM), Tidar University of Magelang (UTM), Bina Patria Computer College of Magelang (STIMIK Bina Patria), Tirtawiayasa Water College (Akademi Tirtawiyasa), and Nurse Academy of Magelang (AKPER Magelang) Transportation Jalur 6, one of Magelang Mass Public Transport Main transportation which is operating in Magelang are cars, motorcycles, buses, paddy cabs, becak, and bicycles. Today, the most popular of them are cars and motorcycles. Even almost all of the household have a motorcycle as mean of mobility in daily activity. Then, for public transportation is mainly using buses and cars. Magelang used to have a railway track from Semarang to Yogyakarta passing at its centre (along Jalan Pemuda), but have since been redirected outside the city. Unfortunately, today the railway track does not function again. It was closed by the government due to the operational cost in that time. Magelang does not have its own airport and therefore relies on Yogyakarta's Adisutjipto International Airport, Surakarta's Adisumarmo International Airport and Semarang's Achmad Yani International Airport. Then, to reach the airport, especially Adisucipto, from Magelang needs about one hour by bus or car or taxi. But today the easier way to reach Adi Sucipto International Airport in Yogyakarta is by using DAMRI buses that specially operated to carry people from Magelang to Adi Sucipto Airport and its way- back. November 2011: Due to lava flooding from Mount Merapi through Kali Putih River in Gempol, Magelang, the main road connecting Magelang and Yogyakarta has several times closed. An estimated Rp.64 billion ($7.3 million) project to build bridge over the river, a 2.3 kilometer-long stream dredge and land acquisition is being built by government.

The coffee beans themselves are not actually white; the colour comes from the milk stirred into the end product. In Malaysia, the original white coffee started in the Ipoh and was a drink made from beans roasted in margarine, ground, brewed, and served with sweetened condensed milk. This style of coffee continues to be popular throughout the country. However, “White Coffee” in Malaysia often simply refers to how the drink is prepared and presented - with added milk or creamer. Overseas visitors finding the margarine-roasted coffee beans unorthodox (due to their slight caramelized flavor) are often misled into believing that there is a type of coffee bean endemic to Malaysia called the \\"white coffee bean\\". The beans used are invariably imported beans roasted to a light color. Local coffee manufacturers now mix instant coffee powder with non-dairy creamer or whitener and sugar, and market the 3-in-1 mixture as white coffee as well. The mixture is preferred by Malaysians at home or in the office as a convenient easy-to- prepare coffee drink. The advisability, however, of consuming instant coffee mixed with non-dairy creamer and sugar daily is slowly coming into question, with some manufacturers now taking the sugar out of the mixture, and marketing the 2-in-1 mixture as sugar-free white coffee.  Styles  Cup of white coffee. Traditionally, Malaysian style ‘black’ coffee roast (Kopi-O) is produced by roasting the beans with sugar, margarine and wheat. ‘White’ coffee, on the other hand, is produced with only margarine and without any sugar, resulting in a less dark roast. Ipoh White Coffee is also widely available in an instant version. It is sometimes consumed after dinner. The generic term ‘Ipoh white coffee’ in Chinese is \\"白咖啡\\"(Jyutping: Ji4bou2 Baak6 Kaa1fei1). Baak6 \\"白\\" (pinyin: bái), commonly meaning white, has nothing to do with the colour in this instance, but is rather a reference to the way the coffee is roasted. In Chinese, Bái also means ‘without’ or ‘unadulterated’,http://dict.baidu.com/s?wd=%B0%D7&tn;=dict nothing has been added to the coffee during the roasting process.

The pancreatic duct joins the common bile duct just prior to the ampulla of Vater, after which both ducts perforate the medial side of the second portion of the duodenum at the major duodenal papilla. There are many anatomical variants reported, but these are quite rare. The duct of Wirsung is named after its discoverer, the German anatomist Johann Georg Wirsung (1589–1643). Accessory pancreatic duct Most people have just one pancreatic duct. However, some have an additional accessory pancreatic duct, called the Duct of Santorini. An accessory pancreatic duct can be functional or non-functional and may open separately into the second part of the duodenum Moore KL, Dalley AF. 2006. Clinically Oriented Anatomy. 5th Ed.

In the other 30% it drains into the main pancreatic duct, which drains into the duodenum via the major duodenal papilla. The main pancreatic duct and the accessory duct both eventually—either directly or indirectly—connect to the second part ('D2', the vertical segment) of the duodenum.

Recurti, 1724 File:Grant 1962 155.pngFormation of an accessory pancreatic duct Clinical significance Compression, obstruction or inflammation of the pancreatic duct may lead to acute pancreatitis. The most common cause for obstruction is the presence of gallstones in the common bile duct, a condition called choledocholithiasis. Obstruction can also be due to duodenal inflammation in Crohn's disease. A gallstone may get lodged in the constricted distal end of the ampulla of Vater, where it blocks the flow of both bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum. Bile backing up into the pancreatic duct may initiate pancreatitis. The pancreatic duct is generally regarded as abnormally enlarged if being over 3 mm in the head and 2 mm in the body or tail.

Playaround purchased the rights to Mystique's titles and released them as \\"double-enders\\" - extra-long cartridges that had a different game on each end. Playaround released additional titles unique from those picked up from Mystique, and made female versions of several of their games to try to tap into another market, which didn't work very well. While the games' themes may be considered adult, the graphics are quite blocky and generally poor enough that it takes quite an imagination to see them as anything more than a novelty. List of Playaround games =Beat' Em and Eat' Em/Philly Flasher= * For more, see Beat 'Em and Eat 'Em =Burning Desire/Jungle Fever= * In Burning Desire, the player assumes the role of a nude man hovering over on a helicopter trying to save a woman from getting consumed by flames, while dodging stones being thrown at him by cannibals. He ejaculates to put out the fire, then he has the woman latch onto his penis and airs her to safety. In Jungle Fever, the roles are reversed and the player controls a woman who lactates the fire out. =Knight on the Town/Lady in Wading= * In Knight on the Town, you play a knight who needs to get across the moat to save a buxom princess, but the only way across is for the knight to build a drawbridge, piece by piece. While building the bridge, the knight must dodge a dragon's fire, an alligator swimming in the moat and a little gremlin with a big mouth to bite the knight's penis off. To make matters worse, the gremlin moves faster for every piece of bridge placed. The goal of this game is to get across a completed drawbridge and climb to the top of the tower to get the princess in the least amount of time. For Lady in Wading, a studly prince is abducted and an Amazon takes the knight's place. =Cathouse Blues/Gigolo= * Both games are Memory-style games to test your memory. In Cathouse Blues, you play a man on a mission to find and score with 7 different women in a large neighborhood and you get paid after you find the right house. However, there are empty houses with alarms that can stun him temporarily. Also wandering the streets are police officers ready to capture you. Also on hand is a mugger who steals all your money if you run into him. You run out of lives and the game is over. In Gigolo, it's a woman who looks for 7 different men. =Bachelor/Bachelorette Party= * This game is similar to Breakout! and Arkanoid in gameplay, but instead of bricks and Pong balls, there are walls of nude women and a nude man to bounce around with a paddle. The roles are reversed in Bachelorette Party. =General Retreat/Westward Ho!= Another double-ended game was released in Europe called General Retreat/Westward Ho!, but due to the multiple complaints, negative impact and protests that Custer's Revenge got, it was never released in the U.S. and stayed on European markets.

Course and features Wingham Manning River rises below Mount Barrington, on the northeastern slopes of the Great Dividing Range within Barrington Tops National Park, east southeast of Ellerston, and flows generally southeast, joined by eleven tributaries including the Pigna Barney, Barnard, Nowendoc, Gloucester, Dawson, and Lansdowne rivers, descending over its course from the high upper reaches, through the Manning Valley, and out to sea. The river flows past the towns of Wingham and Taree. At Taree, the river splits and becomes a double delta. The southern arm reaches its mouth at the Tasman Sea of the South Pacific Ocean, near Old Bar. The northern arm is joined by the Dawson River and further downstream the Lansdowne River, reaching its mouth at the Tasman Sea, near Harrington Point; creating two separate entrances to the river: Harrington Inlet (north) and Farquhar Inlet (south). Within the delta there are several channels dividing coastal land into large islands, such as Mitchells and Oxley islands. Between Croki (in the north) and east of Bohnock (in the south), Scotts Creek links both the northern and southern passages of the river. The Manning River is one of Australia's few large river systems that have not been dammed for water supply purposes anywhere along its catchment. The local water supply is fed by Bootawa Dam, which is an offsite dam, however, water is pumped from the river to the dam whenever river turbidity and flow levels can allow. A small weir is located in the upper reaches of the Barnard River, part of the inter-basin water transfer of the Barnard River Scheme, enabling water to be pumped into the Hunter River to meet the cooling needs of Bayswater and Liddell electric power stations. The scheme is shut down until needed but as of 2006 this scheme was partly decommissioned due to its rare use. The Manning River is one of only a few Australian mainland rivers to receive annual winter melting snow deposits. The Manning River is variously traversed by the Pacific Highway between Taree and Coopernook, and the North Coast railway line at Taree.  History  The traditional custodians of the land surrounding the Manning River and its associated valley are the Australian Aboriginal Biripi people of the Bundjalung nation, who named the river as Boolumbahtee, meaning a place where the brolgas played. In 1818, John Oxley crossed and named Harrington and Farquhar inlets during a trip from the Hastings River, near Port Macquarie, to Port Stephens. The Manning River itself was first surveyed by Henry Dangar in 1825 and again in 1826 on behalf of the Australian Agricultural Company. Later in 1826, the river was named the Manning River by Robert Dawson for the Deputy Governor of the Australian Agricultural Company, William ManningThe Present State of Australia by Robert Dawson, page 372.. In the same year it was declared that the Manning was the northern limit of the Nineteen Counties, defining the areas of New South Wales where settlers were free to occupy. Until 1913, ships servicing the coast brought goods and supplies up the river. Wingham was established at the furthest point supply boats could reach up the river and became the region’s major port. The old cargo wharf at Wingham Brush has since been refurbished. The town of Tinonee was also settled on the river near Taree. Ecology The Manning River is a large producer of Australian oysters and is home to many fish, the most common being the Dusky Flathead (Platycephalus fuscus), a common Australian estuary fish. The Manning River is frequented by dolphins and sharks, with some venturing as far up the river to Wingham. Whales also frequent the river, mainly at the larger Harrington Inlet, although some do enter the Farquar Inlet and generally do not venture far up river. However, on 16 September 1994 a rare tropical Bryde's whale measuring long, nicknamed \\"Free Willy\\" by locals, ventured much further up river to Taree. After becoming a tourist attraction, and repeatedly evading attempts by conservationists to free him \\"Free Willy\\" was finally rescued by Seaworld Staff in conjunction with NSW National Parks And Wildlife and ORCA (Organisation for the Rescue and Research of Cetaceans in Australia). \\"Willy\\" became stranded on a sandbar, and with the assistance of a specially designed inflatable Cetacean Rescue Device, floated and towed back out to sea and was last seen heading for deeper water to the east.Bryde's whale breaches off Tacking Point coastline Events and industry Taree is home to the annual Manning River Summer Festival, which features rowing, and sailing. The Taree Powerboat Club Spectacular is held in the Manning River during the Easter long weekend. Commercial fishing and oyster farming are both practiced in the Manning. The peak season for oyster production is September to March; and the annual production during 2013 was dozen. The link between Taree and the oyster industry is shown by the presence in Taree of the \\"Big Oyster\\", a building constructed in the shape of an open oyster shell. The Manning River area is popular for domestic tourism.

It is isolated from other areas of Detroit by industrial warehouses and Interstate 75 (I-75). As a neighborhood, Delray has no legally defined boundaries, but its area usually extends south to the River Rouge, east to the Detroit River, west to M-85 (Fort Street) and I-75, and north to Dragoon Street at Fort Wayne or sometimes farther north to Clark Street. In 1930, Delray had approximately 23,000 residents. As of the 2010 Census, the two tracts that cover the area had a population of 2,783, a 33% decrease in population from the 2000 Census. Residents have left over the years due to the increased industrialization and decay of the neighborhood. Much of Delray consists of riverfront industries, interspersed with residential properties, mostly single-family and duplex houses. Due to this high level of disrepair, in 2007, the Detroit Metro Times described Delray as \\"the closest thing to a ghost town within a city.\\" Delray was selected for the location of the upcoming Gordie Howe International Bridge. The enormous project will radically alter the neighborhood and result in the destruction of numerous structures and roadways, as well as the relocation of some residents. Geography Delray is located at the southern edge of the city limit of Detroit, although it is not the city's southernmost territory. The neighborhoods of Boynton and Oakwood Heights occupy the southernmost strip of Detroit along Outer Drive and Fort Street extending down to the city of Lincoln Park. With no official boundaries, Delray is considered mostly conterminous with two Census Bureau tracts that cover . Major thoroughfares through Delray, which typically represent the neighborhood's boundaries, include Fort Street, I-75 (Fisher Freeway), and West Jefferson Avenue. Delray is relatively isolated from the rest of the city. The southern border of Delray is the River Rouge, with the city of River Rouge on the southern side of the river. The two are connected by the West Jefferson Avenue-Rouge River Bridge. Due to a bend at the mouth of the River Rouge, Delray is also bordered on the southeast by the river as well. Across the river at that point lies Zug Island, part of the city of River Rouge. North of Zug Island, Delray borders the Detroit River on the east. No residents of Delray live along either body of water as the land is devoted to riverfront industries and the historic Fort Wayne. Delray is about west of Downtown Detroit. In 1935 Delray formed the southern portion of Wards 14, 16, 18, and 20. Since 2013 the neighborhood lies within District 6. History Historic Fort Wayne, built 1843 to guard Detroit from British attack from Amherstburg's Fort Malden, is located at the northeastern end of the neighborhood. The area known as Delray was first platted as \\"Belgrade\\" in 1836. It was renamed as \\"Del Rey\\" on October 14, 1851. Augustus D. Burdeno, after returning from the Mexican–American War, convinced other residents to rename the town. He had encountered a Mexican village named \\"Del Rey\\" (\\"of the kings\\") during the Mexican-American War. This was associated with the Battle of Molino del Rey. At a later point the name was anglicized to \\"Delray\\". Most of the village sat in what was Springwells Township, with the rest sitting across the River Rouge in Ecorse Township. In 1870 it received a post office. It incorporated as a village in 1897. By 1870, salt was mined there and, shortly thereafter, industries located in Delray thanks to its favorable location along the Detroit River and near the several rail lines that linked Detroit to Toledo. These industries were established long before there was any concern with pollution or environmental degradation. Around 1889 many Slovaks, Hungarians, and Poles settled in Delray. Dense housing arrangements appeared to accommodate the immigrants going to Delray. In 1894 Solvay Process Company opened a chemical plant. The company provided a fire service and paved streets to Delray. In 1901 Detroit Iron Works built two iron-making blast furnaces on Zug Island, near Delray. The city of Delray Beach, Florida, in Greater Miami was named after Delray in 1901. In 1906 Detroit annexed Delray. Chemical plants and factories opened in Delray. As years passed, residents who were able moved to larger homes in less industrial neighborhoods. As the value of the housing stock declined, absentee owners did not spend on renovation and tenants did not repair their damage thus leading to continued falling values and a desire of tenants to rent rather than own. In 1929 the railroad built and owned the Detroit Union Terminal at the corner of Fort Street and Green Street, which later was renamed the Detroit Produce Terminal. It is an efficient location for wholesale distributors to receive semi-truck loads of produce from throughout the world, via east coast ports and the southwest border with Mexico. As crops are harvested across the US and Canada, they are delivered to the wholesalers who market to buyers who walk the corridors between various produce display rooms. Most restaurant patrons and grocery shoppers in Metro Detroit and other Michigan communities have competitively priced fresh food each day because of the direct and indirect impact of the market.http://www.thepacker.com/fruit-vegetable-news/know-your- market/Detroit-Produce-Terminal-still-plays-major-role-in-market-- 179565991.html Delray had around 23,000 residents in 1930 according to former residents, which is about the number in the two census divisions that encompassed the neighborhood that year. Delray reached its highest population density in that decade. A wastewater plant opened in the area in 1939, leading to demolition of houses in Delray causing the first major decrease in resident population. When I-75 was built in the 1950s and 1960s, many more houses in Delray were razed. The wastewater plant received an expansion in 1957, leading to more loss of houses. In the 1990s the neighborhood dealt with large gang membership. Numerous gangs were targeted in policing efforts to control crime and recruitment including the Cobras, Cash Flow Posse, 138, Gangster Disciples, Latin Counts, Latin Kings, and the Delray Mafia. Many businesses in Delray closed during the late 2000s economic recession. In addition, around that time U.S. Steel had taken over nearby Zug Island. Many workers had been laid off during the recession. According to the 2000 census, 3,100 lived in Delray. John Carlisle (DetroitBloggerJohn) said in a 2009 article in the Detroit Metro Times that \\"a foul stench\\" was present in Delray due to the wastewater plant and the factories still operating. Due to EPA air pollution regulations, a number of air quality improvements have been made, but much of that was due to closings of antiquated facilities. Even so the transhipment industry grew which has comparatively little health impact, and a handful of warehouses near the Detroit Produce Terminal were converted into temperature- controlled storage facilities specifically for fruits such as bananas and pineapples. In the 2010s, Delray gained attention in the state as a result of the debate over the Detroit River International Crossing, the construction of which would lead to the demolition of much of, if not the vast majority of, the blighted neighborhood. In 2017, the city government offered to buy out houses in the bridge development zone, giving away empty houses outside of the bridge zone to people accepting the offer, plus paying up to $60,000 per household for renovation costs and foreclosing all taxes. Some families accepted the deal, and some refused. The Ambassador Bridge operators went to court to block evictions, but the court case was dismissed in May 2018. In July 2018, the builder of the bridge was selected, and clearance work in Delray will begin. Demographics There were about 2,100 people according to Census estimates in 2014. about 33% of the population was non-Hispanic white, 33% was Hispanic, and 33% was black. In 1897 Delray had about 5,000 people. In 1930 the population was about 24,000. This declined to 20,000 in 1940, over 17,000 in 1950, and under 13,000 in 1970. =Hungarian population= In the early 20th Century the Delray-Springwells area served as the \\"Little Hungary\\" of Detroit and Michigan's Hungarian culture was centered in that community. In 1898 the Michigan Malleable Iron Company began operations in Delray. Hungarian immigrants moved to Delray from cities including Cleveland, Ohio; South Bend, Indiana; and Toledo, Ohio, in order to get better working conditions and better wages. The first wave of Hungarian refugees came to the U.S. in order to escape the Austro-Hungarian Empire's political issues. In 1904 a society to establish a Hungarian Lutheran church had about 60 members, There were also plans to establish a Catholic church, but by 1905 the Hungarians had difficulty agreeing on a final site. Later that year the Holy Cross Hungarian Church, a Hungarian Catholic church, opened in Delray. By 1911 about 5,000 Hungarians lived in Delray. In 1906 the Hungarian population began resisting the actions of the town police. In 1907 some Hungarians in Delray and Wyandotte who feared a lack of work returned to Hungary. After World War I a second wave of Hungarian refugees arrived, who emigrated due to religious and political reasons. Hungary had been reduced in size so many Magyars were escaping discrimination, intimidation and deprivation in the conquered lands of the former enemies of Hungary, often because of the roles they had played in the war. They selected Detroit because the automobile plants paid high wages. As the number of Hungarians in Delray increased, a new church of the Holy Cross Hungarian Catholic Church opened in 1925. In 1935, Doanne Erdmann Beynon, author of \\"Crime and Custom of the Hungarians of Detroit,\\" wrote that \\"it may be assumed\\" that the Hungarian colony is within an area that extends from Fort Street to the Detroit River and from Clark Street to the Rouge River. He stated that even though the former Delray municipality had \\"definite\\" boundaries the boundary of the \\"Hungarian colony of Delray\\" was \\"zonal\\" and that the lines \\"fade off indeterminately into areas that do not belong to the colony.\\" He wrote that within this colony, immigrants from all parts of Hungary lived next to each other and did not settle in different areas according to their places of origin. The exception was an area on Barnes and Medina Streets called \\"Magyar Negyed\\" where the immigrants mainly originated from Sarud in Heves County. Beynon wrote that the residents preserved \\"the peculiar customs and, to some extent, the costumes of the home village.\\" Beynon wrote that in Delray the individual village cultures in Hungary were mixed into a new pan-Hungarian way of life in Delray. During the time Hungarians inhabited Delray, a common phrase was \\"Within Delray the village life flows on\\" (). Various Hungarian social clubs including athletic, altar, dramatic, sick benefit and insurance, singing (Dalárdák), and social clubs were formed. Each club included a membership and a wider group of adherents or pártolók. Beynon wrote that \\"Practically every Hungarian of Detroit who has not broken away entirely from the people of his own nationality is connected in some way with one or more of these societies or clubs.\\" As of 1935 many Hungarians in Delray had been socially isolated to the community and persons who had lived 15 to 20 years in Detroit had never visited the city center. Kossuth Day was celebrated in Delray. Beynon argued that due to Delray's fragmentation among many different wards it was \\"not possible to determine from the population statistics published by the Bureau of the Census either the number of Hungarians resident within the colony or the population which these form of the total Hungarian population of Detroit.\\" Using the Detroit Board of Education's Detroit City Census, Beynon concluded that in 1925, 45.46% of Detroit's Hungarian population lived in Delray. Using a list of Hungarian surnames in the Detroit City Directory published by the company Polk, Beynon concluded that 44.27% of the Hungarians lived in the Delray colony and 55.72% lived outside of the Delray colony. During the Great Depression the Daughters of Divine Charity served in a Hungarian-operated orphanage on South Street. From January 1, 1927, to March 11, 1932, the Wayne County Juvenile Court received 462 complaints filed against Hungarian boys, with a total of 380 boys involved. Of those boys, 140 were from the Delray Hungarian colony. One wave of Hungarians arrived after the end of World War II. Another wave of Hungarians escaped the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, causing more to arrive in Delray. The construction of Interstate 75 in the mid-1960s destroyed large parts of Delray and divided the community into two pieces. Middle and working class Hungarians moved to Allen Park, Lincoln Park, Melvindale, and Riverview. The Holy Cross parish school closed. The Holy Cross Hungarian Church was scheduled to observe its 75th anniversary on September 17, 2000. By August of that year, renovations and polishing were underway. Education =Public schools= Residents of Delray are zoned to Detroit Public Schools (DPS). Clemente Elementary serves Delray for elementary school. All residents are zoned to Western International High School. Histories of public schools From 1894 to 1999, James McMillan School was located on West End Street in central Delray. Originally opened as an elementary school, it was absorbed into DPS in 1907. It was converted into a high school but back into an elementary school for the district in 1916. McMillan Elementary School operated until the end of the 1999 school year, when DPS shut down the school. After it was closed, it remained unused with no intentions of being reopened. It subsequently became heavily vandalized and polluted, suffering a number of fires and eventually a gas line explosion, until the building itself was torn down in 2009. The neighborhood is home also to the now-abandoned Cary Elementary School. Students at the elementary level (grades preK–5) previously attended Roberto Clemente Elementary or Phoenix Elementary. Students in grades 6–8 attended Mark Twain Elementary School or Earhart Middle School. High school students attended Southwestern High School or Western International High School. At 6921 West Fort Street, Southwestern High School can be considered part of the Delray neighborhood, although most properties along this stretch of Fort Street are not normally included as part of the Delray neighborhood. =Public libraries= In September 1907, Branch 8 of the Detroit Public Library system opened as the Delray Branch on West End Avenue. In January 1922, the branch was replaced with the James Valentine Campbell Branch on M-85 (West Fort Street). The branch operated until its closure in December 1996. In July 1999, the Campbell Annex Branch opened at the Holy Redeemer Cultural Center and closed in August 2004, only to reopen as the Campbell Branch at Lawndale Station. The neighborhood currently contains no libraries but is closest served by the Campbell Branch Library. It is located outside of the neighborbood at 8733 West Vernor in the Springwells neighborhood.

The amino (NH2) group and the keto (=O) group are exchanged. Transaminases or aminotransferases are enzymes that catalyze a transamination reaction between an amino acid and an α-keto acid. They are important in the synthesis of amino acids, which form proteins.  Function and mechanism  An amino acid contains an amine (NH2) group. A keto acid contains a keto (=O) group. In transamination, the NH2 group on one molecule is exchanged with the =O group on the other molecule. The amino acid becomes a keto acid, and the keto acid becomes an amino acid. Most transaminases are protein enzymes. However, some transamination activities of the ribosome have been found to be catalyzed by ribozymes (RNA enzymes). Examples being the hammerhead ribozyme, the VS ribozyme and the hairpin ribozyme. Transaminases require the coenzyme pyridoxal-phosphate, which is converted into pyridoxamine in the first half- reaction, when an amino acid is converted into a keto acid. Enzyme-bound pyridoxamine in turn reacts with pyruvate, oxaloacetate, or alpha- ketoglutarate, giving alanine, aspartic acid, or glutamic acid, respectively. Many transamination reactions occur in tissues, catalysed by transaminases specific for a particular amino/keto acid pair. The reactions are readily reversible, the direction being determined by which of the reactants are in excess. This reversibility can be exploited for synthetic chemistry applications to achieve the synthesis of valuable chiral amines. The specific enzymes are named from one of the reactant pairs, for example; the reaction between glutamic acid and pyruvic acid to make alpha ketoglutaric acid and alanine is called glutamic-pyruvic transaminase or GPT for short. Tissue transaminase activities can be investigated by incubating a homogenate with various amino/keto acid pairs. Transamination is demonstrated if the corresponding new amino acid and keto acid are formed, as revealed by paper chromatography. Reversibility is demonstrated by using the complementary keto/amino acid pair as starting reactants. After chromatogram has been taken out of the solvent the chromatogram is then treated with ninhydrin to locate the spots.. Amino acid metabolism in animals Animals must metabolize proteins to amino acids, at the expense of muscle tissue, when blood sugar is low. The preference of liver transaminases for oxaloacetate or alpha- ketoglutarate plays a key role in funneling nitrogen from amino acid metabolism to aspartate and glutamate for conversion to urea for excretion of nitrogen. In similar manner, in muscles the use of pyruvate for transamination gives alanine, which is carried by the bloodstream to the liver (the overall reaction being termed glucose-alanine cycle). Here other transaminases regenerate pyruvate, which provides a valuable precursor for gluconeogenesis. This alanine cycle is analogous to the Cori cycle, which allows anaerobic metabolism by muscles. = Diagnostic uses = The transaminase enzymes are important in the production of various amino acids, and measuring the concentrations of various transaminases in the blood is important in the diagnosing and tracking many diseases. For example, the presence of elevated transaminases can be an indicator of liver and cardiac damage. Two important transaminase enzymes are aspartate transaminase (AST), also known as serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT); and alanine transaminase (ALT), also called alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) or serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (SGPT). These transaminases were discovered in 1954 and their clinical importance in 1955.

He commanded the SS Main Office in 1935–1939. After World War II, Heißmeyer was tried and convicted as a \\"major Nazi offender\\". Early life After finishing school, Heißmeyer joined the Prussian military. In World War I, he was an infantry officer and was awarded the Iron Cross First Class for bravery. After giving up his studies, he was employed as a driving teacher. In 1923 he first came into contact with the Nazi Party, which he joined in 1925. In early 1926, Heißmeyer joined the Sturmabteilung (SA) where he was responsible for building up the SA-Gausturm Hannover-Süd, and was for a time the acting Gauleiter. In 1940 Heißmeyer, previously married with six children in his custody, married Gertrud Scholtz- Klink, the Reichsfrauenführerin (Reich Women's Leader), who had two previous marriages herself. SS career Heißmeyer joined the Schutzstaffel (SS) in January 1930. From 1932, Heißmeyer was posted to the SS Main Office, becoming its leader in 1935 and relieving Heinrich Himmler from that specific position. On 9 November 1936, Heißmeyer was promoted to SS-Obergruppenführer (general) and Inspector of the National Political Institutes of Education. In 1939, Heißmeyer was appointed SS Oberabschnittsleiter \\"East\\" and in 1940 as HSSPF (Higher SS and Police Leader) Spree, where he was in charge of the Berlin- Brandenburg area. August Heißmeyer took over the command of the SS Totenkopf Standarte in 1940 from the outgoing Theodor Eicke, who in 1939 had begun commanding a combat SS division (SS Division Totenkopf) and therefore gave his supervision over the concentration camps back to the SS Leadership Main Office. Heißmeyer was provisionally in charge of this bureau until May 1942. Richard Glücks took over the position, and became the chief of the Concentration Camps Inspectorate. In April 1945, Heißmeyer was given command of Kampfgruppe \\"Heißmeyer\\", a collection of Volkssturm militia and Hitler Youth who were given the task of protecting the Spandau airfield outside Berlin. =Post-war trial and conviction= On 29 February 1948, Heißmeyer was arrested by French authorities near Tübingen and held for trial the following month. He served 18 months in prison before being released in 1949. The following year he was sentenced by the de-Nazification appeals court to 3 years imprisonment and forfeiture of property as a \\"major Nazi offender\\". His nephew Kurt Heissmeyer, an SS physician, was also convicted. After his release, Heißmeyer went to live in Schwäbisch Hall. He became the director of the West German Coca-Cola bottling plant. He died on 16 January 1979, five days after his 82nd birthday.

It billed itself as \\"a 16-part series for young people and their families,\\" with the target audience being primarily kids, preteens, teenagers, and young adults, and it was widely praised by educational groups. The series was later rerun by Nickelodeon from 1984 to 1986. Description Set in Washington, D.C., Powerhouse is focused on the adventures of a racially and ethnically diverse group of five teenagers and one adult from the inner city, based at a former boxing and sports gym headquarters turned community center for kids and teens. The center was founded by Brenda Gaines, a woman who inherited the place from her late father, a former boxing champion. The basic theme of the series is that every person is a source of creativity and power. “We all have a Powerhouse deep down inside,” it says in the theme song of the show. Each Powerhouse episode dealt with significant personal issues that affected both kids and teenagers such as alcoholism, peer pressure, physical fitness, and more, but they were combined with fast-paced action-adventure stories in which the group often had to solve a mystery or prevent a crime. For instance, in one episode they had to uncover the head of a racketeering operation that threatened to put Brenda and Powerhouse out of business. In another episode, they tried to track down the source of a potentially lethal food-poisoning epidemic, a task that took on even greater urgency when one of the group became infected. Uncommercials One of Powerhouse's innovations was the use of what the show called Uncommercials. Since the show ran on PBS, which is commercial-free, the producers created 30- to 90-second commercial-like breaks that would air during the broadcast. Instead of selling products, uncommercials would sell a theme, often in entertaining or humorous ways. One uncommercial, for example, featured a 12-year-old boy who asked, “How do I get a girl to like me?” Several boys and girls of around the same age then offered suggestions. Another one asked, “What is a friend?” and several teenagers answered, one of which was future Saturday Night Live star Ana Gasteyer (her answer: “Someone you can be weird with.”) in her first-ever TV appearance. Another uncommercial featured Henry Winkler as a celebrity organ who gave advice on how to take care of your lungs. Another popular uncommercial theme was \\"Don't Just Sit There—Do Something!\\" which encouraged viewers to do something active or constructive. Other features Another Powerhouse feature was a salute to a particular youth organization, such as the Boy Scouts of America; these salutes preceded at least one of the uncommercials. The Powerhouse gang *Brenda Gaines (Sandra Bowie)—Brenda is the founder of Powerhouse, which was originally her father's gymnasium. She turns it into an after-school youth center, which the rest of the five teenagers eventually join. Brenda is the leader as well the mother of the Powerhouse gang and the de facto authority figure of the gang, although she treats the rest of the five teens as equals rather than subordinates. *Jennifer LaBianca (Domenica Galati)—A friendly brunette teenager and owner of the Powerhouse van, Jennifer has a strong aptitude for mechanics. *Kevin Jackson (Michael Mack)—18-year-old Kevin is the eldest of the five teenagers. He is the rock of the Powerhouse gang, a big brother to whom the younger ones can go for advice and support. *Lolo Knopke (Jason Kravits)—13-year-old (after the episode \\"Celebration\\") Lolo is insecure about his appearance because he is very short and has to wear glasses (thus giving him the appearance of a stereotypical nerd), but he is also one of the smartest kids in the group. He is Jewish. *Pepper McKenzie (Jessica Prentice)—12-year-old Pepper is one of the most outgoing members of the group, despite being the youngest. She is impulsive and adventurous, and is sometimes prone to becoming a “damsel-in-distress” that often causes Jennifer, Kevin, Lolo and Tony to say her first name out loud. *Tony Dominguez (Michael Wikes)—Tony is a streetwise 17-year-old. He is a good person at heart but sometimes feels like he has to play the tough guy to mask his insecurities.

Seropian became interested in computer programming in college and teamed up with fellow student Jason Jones to publish Jones's game Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete. The two became partners, and Bungie grew to become the best-known Apple Macintosh game developer before being bought by Microsoft in 2001. In 2004, Seropian left Bungie and created Wideload Games, with the goal of streamlining game development. Wideload's small core development team worked with outside contractors to produce Stubbs the Zombie and Hail to the Chimp. Wideload was acquired by Disney in 2009. As part of the deal Seropian became vice president of game development for Disney Interactive Studios. In 2012 he left the position to start Industrial Toys, a company focusing on mobile games. Biography =Early life= Alex Seropian attended the University of Chicago, and joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, where he met one of his future colleagues Jason Jones. Interested in computer programming, Seropian was pursuing a mathematics degree with a concentration in computer science as the Department of Computer Science did not offer undergraduate degrees at the time. He graduated in 1991 with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics. Before graduating, Seropian was living with his father, sleeping on his couch, and debating whether to get a job or create his own video game company. Seropian's father advised him to take a job to get experience, but the next day Seropian decided to found his own company. \\"My dad is a master of reverse psychology\\", Seropian said. =Bungie= Seropian's first game was a self- published Pong-clone called Gnop! for Apple Macintosh. The game was free, although a few customers paid $15 for the game's source code. In 1991 he founded Bungie and published his first commercial game, Operation Desert Storm. Seropian sold 2,500 copies of the game, assembling the game boxes and mailing them out from his bedroom. Seropian partnered with his Artificial Intelligence classmate Jason Jones to publish Jones's nearly complete Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete; the game sold around 2,500 copies—it required a then-rare modem for network play—it developed a devoted following. After publishing Minotaur, the two formed a partnership. For the next Bungie title, 1993's Pathways Into Darkness, Seropian hired a third team member for graphics work. The game was the first three-dimensional texture-mapped game on the Mac and the first true first-person shooter. By 1994 Bungie had grown to a staff of six and had moved into a rundown Chicago office—a converted former religious school located in front of a crack house. Their next title, Marathon, began development as a sequel to Pathways but grew larger. On release it won several awards and established Bungie as the top Mac game developer. For Halo: Combat Evolved, Seropian noted that the company had to incorporate new features such as surround sound and cinematics. Halo went on to sell more than 4 million units by 2004 and founded a media franchise encompassing sequels, books, and music. Seropian left Bungie in 2002 to spend time with his new family, but also due to frustrations with the game development process. =Wideload Games= Seropian founded his own studio in 2004 called Wideload Games, intended to be more streamlined than most video game studios. Calling the method of game development \\"broken\\", Wideload began with a staff of 10, with the plan to outsource the lion's share of development, to stay within budget. Seropian said that the idea came from figuring out that his decade-old assumptions about how to make games did not necessarily apply to the future. Seropian turned to the film industry for cues, saying that it helped to look at an older industry that had been solving the same types of problems for a longer period than video games. The external development model allowed Wideload to focus on the creative aspect of a project and added flexibility in what types of projects the team could take on. Wideload produced two games, 2005's Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse and 2008's Hail to the Chimp. On September 8, 2009 Disney acquired Wideload. Seropian joined Disney to head its in-house game development team, Disney Interactive Studios. The sale of Wideload was not originally planned: Wideload and Disney began working on a title together, and as conversations turned to a \\"broader scope and vision\\", the two companies \\"discovered [they] had a lot in common,\\" Seropian said. Seropian left Disney in February 2012.Pligge, Zachary. (2012-02-07) Breaking: Bungie Founder Leaving Disney Interactive – News. www.GameInformer.com. Retrieved on 2013-03-23. Seropian also serves as DePaul University's second \\"game designer in residence\\"; DePaul is the first liberal arts university to offer a bachelor's degree for game design. =Industrial Toys= In 2012, Seropian founded a studio named Industrial Toys. The company plans to develop mobile games for core gamers. The first title by Industrial Toys, Midnight Star, was announced to be a sci- fi shooter designed with touch-based mobile platforms in mind , and debuted in February 2015. In July 2018, Industrial Toys was acquired by Electronic Arts.

He was Mayor of Cotonou from 2003 to 2015. Soglo is married to Rosine Vieyra Soglo, the Beninois former First Lady and politician. Biography Soglo was born in Togo. After receiving degrees in law and economics from the University of Paris, Soglo returned to Benin (then called Dahomey) and was the inspector of finance (1965–1967) before his cousin, Colonel Christophe Soglo, overthrew President Sourou-Migan Apithy and appointed his relative minister of finance and economic affairs. Following the 1972 coup that brought Mathieu Kérékou to power, he left the country and held positions at international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. In the late 1980s, faced with growing dissatisfaction over a stagnant economy, the Kérékou government agreed to convene a national conference that would lead the country towards multiparty democracy. The conference designated Nicéphore Soglo Prime Minister, and he took office on March 12, 1990. The conference produced a constitution that was overwhelmingly approved in a referendum held on 2 December 1990. In the country's first multiparty presidential election, Soglo took first place in the first round, held on March 10, 1991, with 36.31% of the vote. A run-off against Kérékou followed on 24 March in which Soglo won a strong majority, receiving 67.73% of the vote—the first time that an opposition candidate in post-colonial Francophone Africa had won a free election.Elections in Benin, African Elections Database. He took office on April 4, 1991. In the following year, the Renaissance Party of Benin (known by the acronym PRB or RB) was founded by Rosine Soglo; her husband became leader of the party in 1994. In 1993, President Soglo headed the Benin delegation which participated in the first Tokyo International Conference on African Development.Japan, Ministry for Foreign Affairs (MOFA): 28 African nations During his presidency, Soglo took efforts to refurbish Benin's devastated economy. These economic measures caused civil unrest and undermined his popularity. Despite these problems, his government was praised for its adherence to democratic principles and respect for human rights. In the March 1996 presidential election, Soglo again took first place in the first round, but in the second round he was defeated by Mathieu Kérékou, receiving 47.51% of the vote. Soglo alleged election fraud, but this was rejected by the Constitutional Court.Benin, Year in Review: 1996, Britannica.com. In a bid to regain the presidency in the March 2001 election, he placed second behind Mathieu Kérékou, winning 27.12% of the vote. Although Soglo qualified to participate in a run-off against Kérékou, he withdrew alleging irregularities, which resulted in a Kérékou victory. Soglo could not run again in the March 2006 presidential election due to the age limit of 70 years; his son Lehady Soglo ran as the candidate of the Renaissance Party instead,\\"Underfinanced Benin election promises change\\", afrol News, March 3, 2006. placing fourth with 8.44% of the vote.

The community is located along Allatoona Creek, southeast of Cartersville. It was once a small mining community until a dam was erected at the base of the Etowah river, completely flooding the town of Allatoona. History Allatoona was first founded in 1838. One of the first official buildings was a small post office that was active until 1918. Before the emergence of the civil war, the town became increasingly popular, people started coming to the town in search of gold and other resources; a silver mine was also located nearby that also brought miners to the small town. As well as a blacksmith, a small depot and a dry goods store. A small Universalist church was built in 1910 which also functioned as a schoolhouse. The town later expanded and added a new school house site which would be located just a half mile southeast of the railroad that ran through town. John Clayton was among the first settlers to the town of Allatoona he was a rich slave owner and owned several plantations around the area. Several of the founders including John Clayton are buried in the cemetery adjacent to the church. The graves of founders and other town folk can still be visited to this day. Allatoona was also considered both an agricultural community and transportation crossroads established along Allatoona Creek at the southern end of the Appalachian Mountains and best known for the battle of Allatoona Pass. Battle of Allatoona After the Battle of Atlanta Southern Confederates wanted to stop General Sherman and his army of Northern troops. General Sherman aimed to finish his march to the sea; conquering every town that his army encountered. The leader of the Confederate army, General Hood, and his soldiers were ordered to destroy the railroad that ran through the town of Allatoona. Doing so would weaken any chance of the Union army to finish taking control of other southern towns. On the morning of October 5, 1864, a battle in the town of Allatoona took place, as Confederate troops approached Allatoona pass they were outnumbered by union troops at 2,000 to 1,944. Confederate soldiers in an attempt to fight off the larger number of Union troops resorted to rocks and hand-to-hand combat to secure the town of Allatoona for the south. John Claytons plantation home, known as the Clayton- Mooney house was used as a union headquarters as well as a makeshift hospital during the battle. During the battle, the Confederate Army had received a tip that the Union army would have more reinforcements and that they would be overtaken by the Union army. General Hood had made the decision to pull his troops from battle, and thus ended up defeated. The confederate army lost to the union because of false information they had received. It is known as one of the civil wars bloodiest battle due to the duration of the battle which approximately lasted 6–8 hours. Also making it one of the civil wars shortest battles. The Clayton-Mooney home, circa 1836, is the only structure still standing. Bloodstains and bullet holes are still able to be seen today and serve as a reminder of the events that took place in Allatoona. Allatoona Dam Allatoona dam is located at the base of the Etowah River and approximately a mile off of Interstate 75. It is roughly 30 miles from downtown Atlanta, Georgia. The first official recognition that the present dam site on the Etowah River near Cartersville, Georgia, was a prime location for a hydropower project was in a document entitled, \\"Reports on Examination and Survey of Etowah, Coosa, Tallapoosa and Alabama Rivers\\", prepared in 1910 by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. Lake Allatoona was authorized by the Flood Control Acts of 1941 and 1946 The town of Allatoona was scheduled to be destroyed to allow for the construction of the dam. As the dam was officially being started it was a fast moving project, the construction of the dam took place prior to World War ll. When the US joined WWII construction on the dam had to be put on hold. Once the war ended work was restarted on the dam on February 8, 1946; instead of the Army Corps finishing the project they opted for hired laborers to complete the dam. The lake began to fill just after Christmas in 1949. By May 1950, the lake was full, with 12,010 acres of water and 270 miles of shoreline. The power plant began operation on January 31, 1950. The dam serves several functions; including seven authorized purposes such as: flood control, hydropower generation, water supply, recreation, fish and wildlife management, water quality, and Navigation. Before the dam was built the town of Allatoona and other surrounding areas would occasionally flood causing extensive damage throughout the town. The addition of Allatoona Dam has prevented nearly $80 million in flood damages since 1950. The total cost of the Allatoona Dam project for construction, land, and relocation was $31,500,000 in 1950. That's roughly $300 million in 2013 dollars. The Allatoona dam is approximately 1,250 feet in length and the maximum height above the existing riverbed is 190 feet. An 18-foot wide roadway is provided across the entire length of the dam. Recreation Lake Allatoona seen from AllatoonaWith the installation of the dam and the town of Allatoona now transformed into a lake, the surrounding areas were converted for recreational use. Several beaches, campgrounds, and cabins are scattered throughout the area. Around the shores of Allatoona there are 25 parks, 8 marinas and 10 campgrounds. There are several parks used for daily use on Lake Allatoona and the Etowah River. The surrounding land is ideal for families and sees large surges of guests every year. Out of the dozens of parks at Allatoona two of those are handicap accessible so that all patrons can still take part in lake activities. In 1998, Lake Allatoona clocked more visitor hours than any of the other 450 Corps of Engineers projects in the United States. In the 1980s during a drought that affected Bartow County and other regions, the water level of the lake reached an all-time low due to the dry conditions. During the peak of the drought, onlookers were able to see the old roads, remnants of houses and tree stumps clearly visible from above water. Presently the park is managed and maintained by Red Top Mountain State Park.

It is home to Andrei Rublev Museum of Old Russian Art, named after the most famous monk of this abbey. Muscovite and Imperial period The Andronikov Gospels was made in the monastery in the early 15th century The monastery was established in 1357 by Metropolitan Alexis as a way of giving thanks for his survival in a storm. Its first hegumen was Saint Andronik, one of Sergii Radonezhsky's disciples. The extant four-pillared Saviour Cathedral was constructed from 1420-1427\\\\. The great medieval painter Andrei Rublev spent the last years of his life at the monastery and was buried there. In addition, one of the largest mass graves for lay brothers (called , skudelnitsa) was located on the cloister's premises. In the second half of the 14th century, a monastic quarter formed outside the walls of the Andronikov Monastery, which started producing bricks for the ongoing construction of the Moscow Kremlin (1475). From its beginning, Andronikov Monastery was one of the centres of book copying in Muscovy. Manuscript collection of the cloister included most of the works by Maximus the Greek. In August 1653, archpriest Avvakum was held under arrest at this monastery. Andronikov Monastery has been ransacked on numerous occasions (1571, 1611, 1812). In 1748 and 1812, its archives were lost in fires. In the 19th century, there were a theological seminary and a library on the cloister's premises. In 1917, there were seventeen monks and one novice in the monastery. Soviet period and beyond After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Andronikov Monastery was closed. One of the first Cheka's penal colonies (mostly, for foreign nationals) was located within the walls of the monastery. In 1928, the Soviets destroyed the necropolis of the Andronikov Monastery, where Andrei Rublev and soldiers of the Great Northern War and the Patriotic War had been interred. In 1947, however, Andronikov Monastery was declared a national monument. In 1985, the Andrei Rublev Central Museum of Ancient Russian Culture and Art was opened on the cloister's premises. In 1991, the Saviour cathedral was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church. Archaeological excavations on the cloister's territory in 1993 uncovered an ancient altar and other relics. Monuments Ivan the Great Belltower. Since the 1930s, when the Communists destroyed the 14th-century Saviour Cathedral in the Wood, the monastery's cathedral has attracted a renewed interest as the oldest preserved in Moscow. Consequently, its present outlook is the result of a controversial Soviet restoration (1959-1960), which sought to remove all additions from later periods. Nothing but traces of the frescoes by Andrei Rublev and Daniil Chyorny remain visible on its walls. The second oldest monument (1504-1506) in the abbey is a spacious refectory, the third largest such structure after those in the Palace of Facets and Joseph-Volotsky Monastery. The adjacent baroque church was commissioned by Eudoxia Lopukhina in 1694 to commemorate the birth of her son, Tsarevich Alexis, and contains a burial vault of the Lopukhin family. Massive 17th-century walls and towers are reminiscent of the period when the monastery defended the eastern approaches against the Moscow Kremlin. In 1795, they started a Neoclassical belltower, one of the tallest in Moscow. This astonishing belfry was destroyed in 1929-1932, and its bricks were subsequently reused in construction of nearby buildings.

Atlantic Monthly Press) The Long Emergency: Surviving the Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-first Century is a book by James Howard Kunstler (Grove/Atlantic, 2005) exploring the consequences of a world oil production peak, coinciding with the forces of climate change, resurgent diseases, water scarcity, global economic instability and warfare to cause major trouble for future generations. The book's principal theme explores the effects of a peak in oil production, predicted by many geologists, on American society as well as the rest of the world. In both this book and in his other writings, Kunstler argues that the economic upheavals caused by peak oil will force Americans to live in more localized, self-sufficient communities. Synopsis Kunstler's premise is that \\"cheap, plentiful\\" oil is the foundation of industrial society and the pervasiveness of its effects is not widely appreciated. Through the 21st century, oil and natural gas will become increasingly difficult to obtain, becoming increasingly expensive and ultimately unavailable. Scarcity of petroleum will cause significant problems for transportation and generation of electrical power. In addition, shipping of food and manufactured items will become increasingly expensive, ultimately prohibitively so. Also, natural gas is vitally important to food production as it is the raw material for much of commercial crop fertilizers. In the industrialized West, most food production and manufacturing is performed far from, and generally abstracted away from the consumer. The author further argues that alternative sources of energy will be insufficient. As petroleum sources become scarce, environmentally harmful or risky technologies such as coal and nuclear will become necessary but not sufficient for our energy needs. Hydroelectric, solar, and wind power, even in combination with coal and nuclear, will also be far from sufficient. Kunstler does not consider hydrogen to be a true energy source since one cannot drill into the earth and obtain hydrogen. Hydrogen must be extracted from other energy sources, such as natural gas or using electricity at a total net loss of energy. Kunstler states that, as energy becomes scarce, transportation will become difficult or impossible, causing food and other necessary commodities to become unavailable in many communities. It will be necessary for local communities to become self-sufficient for food production, but many communities will be unable to do so, particularly large cities. The result will be mass starvation, disease, and civil unrest. Kunstler suggests that governments will be incapable of managing these problems. This period of scarcity and collapse will possibly last for hundreds of years, hence the \\"long\\" emergency of the book's title. Kunstler, a long-time critic of suburban design, advises people should begin learning to grow food. See also *Urban agriculture *Geoffrey Parker (historian)  Further reading        Lynn, R. R.

January 1, 1969. His formative experiences as Christian missionary and educator in early 20th century China shaped his life's work. Although he did not learn the Chinese language, he became known for his magisterial scholarly surveys of the history of world Christianity, the history of China, and of American relations with East Asia.  Early life  Latourette was born in Oregon City, Oregon, the son of DeWitt Clinton Latourette and Ella (Scott) Latourette. His mother and father both attended Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon, where they graduated in 1878. DeWitt Clinton Latourette was a lawyer in Oregon City. The Latourette family migrated to Oregon in the 1860's; the family's origins are from France where they fled religious persecution as Hugenots and migrated to Staten Island, New York in the 1600s. In 1904, Latourette was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree from Linfield College in Oregon. He continued his education in New Haven, Connecticut at Yale, earning a BA in 1906, an MA in 1907 and PhD in 1909.Boston University School of Theology (BUSTH): Anderson, Gerald H. (1998). \\"Latourette, Kenneth Scott,\\" in Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions, pp. 384–85.  Career From 1909 through 1910, Latourette served as a traveling secretary for the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions. In 1910, he joined the faculty of Yale-in China's Yali School at Changsha in Hunan Province. He began to study the Chinese language, but in the summer of 1911 he contracted a severe case of amoebic dysentery and was forced to return to the United States. As he began his recovery, Latourette joined the faculty at Reed College in Portland, Oregon; and from 1914 through 1916, he was a professor of history at Reed. In 1916, he accepted a position at Denison University, an institution with Baptist affiliations, in Granville, Ohio. His time at Denison lasted from 1916 through 1921. In 1918, while at Denison, Latourette was ordained as a Baptist minister. Latourette joined the faculty of the Yale University Divinity School in 1921. Latourette lived in a college dormitory suite during his time at Yale. He welcomed student groups to meet in the living room and was known as \\"Uncle Ken.\\" He accepted appointment as the D. Willis James Professor of Missions and World Christianity (1921–1949), and he was later made the Sterling Professor of Missions and Oriental History (1949–1953). In 1938, he was named Chairman of the Department of Religion at Yale. He took on greater responsibilities in 1946 as Director of Graduate Studies at the Yale Divinity School. From his retirement in 1953 until his death in 1968, he was Sterling Professor Emeritus at the Divinity School. Latourette was killed at age 84 when an automobile accidentally hit him in front of his family home in Oregon City, Oregon.  Other achievements  Latourette served as president of the American Historical Association, the Association for Asian Studies, the American Baptist Convention, the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society and the Japan International Christian University Foundation. He was a leader in the ecumenical movement, and he held leadership positions in the American Baptist Missionary Union, the International Board of the Y.M.C.A., the United Board for Christian Colleges in China and the World Council of Churches. Throughout his life he remained active in the Yale-in-China Association. At the Yale Divinity School, the \\"Latourette Initiative\\" is a proactive program to preserve and provide access to the documentation of world Christianity. It provides funding for the microfilming of published and archival resources documenting the history of Christian missions and Christian life. =Honors= Latourette was awarded honorary doctorates from seventeen universities in five countries. In 1938 he received the Order of Jade from the Government of China. He is also honored at the campus of William Carey International University. in Pasadena, California. The institution's main library is called the Latourette Library.. (The WCIU campus was sold to Education First and therefore no longer heralds Latourette's name). Linfield College named a residence hall in his honor in 1946..  Writings  Latourette was the author of over 80 books on Christianity, Oriental history and customs, and theological subjects. He also wrote and spoke out about issues of his time, as for example, when he warned his fellow Americans in 1943 about the unwanted consequences of revenge after Japan should eventually lose the war they started with the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.\\"Warns on Revenge After Japan Loses; Dr. K.S. Latourette Sees Peril in Depriving Our Foe of Way to Earn Livelihood,\\" The New York Times. December 15, 1943. In addition, Latourette later wrote extensively on China. The single work for which Latourette is most remembered is the seven- volume \\"A History of the Expansion of Christianity\\".Burger, Nash K. \\"In the Field of Religion,\\" The New York Times.

Bottle episodes are usually shot on sets built for other episodes, frequently the main interior sets for a series, and consist largely of dialogue and scenes for which no special preparations are needed. They are commonly used when one script has fallen through and another has to be written at short notice, or because of budgetary constraints. Bottle episodes have also been used for dramatic effect, with the limited setting and cast allowing for a slower pace and deeper exploration of character traits and motives. Use The term \\"bottle show\\" was coined by Leslie Stevens, creator and executive producer of 1960s TV series The Outer Limits, for an episode made in very little time at very little cost, \\"as in pulling an episode right out of a bottle like a genie\\". The earliest known use of \\"bottle episode\\" is 2003. Bottle episodes are sometimes produced when a show has a mid-season cliffhanger or an expensive season opener/closer, to allow as much of the budget as possible to go to the more expensive episodes. Scott Brazil, executive producer/director of The Shield, described bottle episodes as \\"the sad little stepchild whose allowance is docked in order to buy big brother a new pair of sneaks\\". Examples Seinfelds \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\" was reportedly refused by NBC numerous times, almost causing Larry David to leave the show. The episode, the only pure Seinfeld bottle episode, is viewed as a classic and said to have \\"[broken] new ground\\" for both the show and sitcoms. The third season premiere of The West Wing was delayed by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States. When the season did return, the first episode was a bottle episode titled \\"Isaac and Ishmael\\", in which the main cast paid tribute to those affected by the attacks and informed viewers about what to expect from the delayed premiere. Set almost entirely in the White House Mess Hall, the main characters explore the motivations and nuances of terrorism. The popularity of the Friends bottle episode \\"The One Where No One's Ready\\" led the producers to create at least one bottle episode in each season.Bright, Kevin S. (2005). Friends: Final Thoughts (DVD). New Wave DVD and Warner Home Entertainment. The bottle episode on Brooklyn Nine-Nine, \\"The Box\\", is rated as one of the best by its viewers. It is currently the joint highest-rated episode of the series (9.5/10) on IMDB.Brooklyn Nine-Nine episodes ranked by rating on IMDB. https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?series=tt2467372&view;=simple&count;=250&sort;=user_rating,desc&ref;_=tt_eps_rhs_sm Several early episodes of The X-Files were conceived as bottle episodes, including \\"Space\\", \\"Darkness Falls\\", and the well-received \\"Ice\\", although these ran over budget.Lowry, pp.121–122Edwards, p.71Goldman, p.94Edwards, p.45 Bottle episodes from Star Trek: The Original Series (Star Trek: TOS) are known for occasionally becoming popular with fans. Examples include \\"Charlie X\\", \\"Journey to Babel\\", \\"The Changeling\\", \\"Elaan of Troyius\\", and \\"Is There in Truth No Beauty?\\". The phenomenon has persisted to a lesser extent in later incarnations, with \\"Duet\\" (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine) being celebrated by Startrek.com and Amazon.com—among other sources—as \\"[a]rguably one of the best episodes of Deep Space Nine and a jewel in the entire Trek canon\\". The third story of Doctor Who, The Edge of Destruction, was a bottle episode created in different circumstances from most. The series had been picked up for thirteen episodes by the BBC, and the previous two stories had contained eleven episodes between them; hence, a two-part story was needed. It only featured the main cast of four. Doctor Who has also had occasional bottle episodes since then, most notably \\"Midnight\\", which, apart from bookend scenes at a holiday resort, is set entirely on a shuttle bus, with a monster depicted only via sound effects and the acting of the guest cast. The third-season episode \\"Fly\\" of Breaking Bad features only two members of the main cast (plus a few extras) and takes place almost exclusively in the secret laboratory used to cook crystal methamphetamine. Although widely acclaimed by critics, this episode was the lowest rated episode of the entire series. Series creator Vince Gilligan has referred to this as a bottle episode, noting that the limited setting and cast allowed for a slower pace and deeper exploration of character traits and motives: > Even if financial realities didn't enter into it, I feel as a showrunner > that there should be a certain shape and pace to each season, and the really > high highs that you try to get to at the end of a season—the big dramatic > moments of action and violence, the big operatic moments you're striving > for—I don't think would land as hard if you didn't have the moments of quiet > that came before them. The quiet episodes make the tenser, more dramatic > episodes pop even more than they usually would just by their contrast. Archers Season 6, Episode 5, \\"Vision Quest\\", features seven of the eight major cast members stuck in an elevator in real time. The comedy-drama series Leverage had three bottle episodes. \\"The Bottle Job\\" (season 2, episode 11) uses only three locations: Nathan Ford's (Timothy Hutton) apartment; McRory's, the bar it sits over; and the bar's backroom. It also alludes to the concept by forcing the Leverage team to execute a late betting or \\"wire\\" con, which normally takes days or weeks just to set up, in only an hour and a half; Ford explicitly calls it \\"the wire in a bottle\\". (Ford, a recovering alcoholic, also reverts to drinking as part of the con; \\"hitting the bottle\\" is an expression for heavy drinking.) \\"The Cross My Heart Job\\" (season 4, episode 9) sees the team confined to an airport with no equipment or other resources, fighting to stop a transplant heart from going to a terminally ill defense contractor who's had it stolen from its intended recipient. And finally, \\"The Broken Wing Job\\" (season 5, episode 8) has Parker (Beth Riesgraf) working to foil a kidnapping while stuck at home with a broken leg, while the rest of the team is on a job in Japan. A meta-example is Communitys Season 2, Episode 8, \\"Cooperative Calligraphy\\". After the opening, characters Jeff Winger (Joel McHale) and Abed Nadir (Danny Pudi) both refer to the situation as a bottle episode. The entire episode is set inside a study room of the college with only the main cast. Its plot centers around the pen of the character Annie Edison (Alison Brie) going missing as she refuses to let anyone else leave the study room until they come forward with it. Another meta-example is Teen Titans Go!s Season 3, Episode 29, \\"Bottle Episode\\". Its plot centers around the main characters being trapped in a literal glass bottle, and passing the time by reminiscing about previous episodes (making it also a clip show). The episode breaks the fourth wall multiple times with dialogue referencing the expense of television production, giving production staff a break, and the need to fill episodes that fall through. The adult-animated sci-fi sitcom Rick and Morty has a bottle episode called \\"Rixty Minutes\\". In it, the Smith family alternates between watching the lives of alternate versions of themselves on special goggles and commercials on the TV, the latter being entirely improvised sketches by co-creator Justin Roiland. The anime series Hyouka has a bottle episode titled Anyone Who Knows. In it, Hōtarō challenges Eru to come up with a random mystery to prove that a theory can be created out of anything. The entire episode is set in a school classroom and focuses on the two main characters. The episodes \\"My Coffee With Niles\\" and \\"Dinner Party\\" of the sitcom Frasier are notable bottle episodes, each taking place entirely on a single set (the fictional coffee shop Cafe Nervosa, and Frasier's apartment, respectively) and featuring minimal or no guest actors. The episode \\"Train Station\\" of the BBC mockumentary This Country is a bottle episode almost entirely set on a bench on a railway station platform. It features the two main characters, Kerry and Kurtan, bickering as they await the return of their friend the Vicar from a week away in Bristol. The Peep Show episode Nether Zone (series 7, episode 4) takes place almost entirely inside a block of flats, as Mark and Jez are locked inside, unable to get to Mark's baby's christening. In a seventh season episode of the American comedy television series Parks and Recreation titled \\"Leslie and Ron\\", the Parks & Recreation gang finds Leslie Knope and Ron Swanson's rivalry cumbersome and locks them in a room together overnight to hash things out. The BoJack Horseman episode \\"Free Churro\\" features the title character give a monologue in front of a static background for 20 minutes of the episode's 26-minute runtime. The entire episode was voiced by a single voice-actor. The BBC soap opera Eastenders has a tradition of \\"two-hander\\" episodes stretching back to 1986, which consist of a dialogue between two characters, typically in a single location.

It is one of two Hungarian national libraries, the other being University of Debrecen Library. History The library was founded in 1802 by the highly patriotic Hungarian aristocrat Count Ferenc Széchényi. Széchényi traveled the world buying Hungarian books, which he assembled and donated to the nation. In the following year the public library was opened in Pest. Széchényi's example resulted in a nationwide movement of book donations to the library. In 1808, the Hungarian National Assembly (\\"Diet\\") created the Hungarian National Museum to collect the historical, archaeological and natural relics of Hungary. The Museum was merged into the Library and for the last 200 years this is how it has existed, a national depository for written, printed and objective relics of the Hungarian past. In 1846, the Hungarian National Museum moved into its new building but it was not until 1949 that the Library became a separate entity again, with its current name. In 1985, the library moved to its new home at the Buda Castle Palace. The NSZL works on its catalogue's semantic availability.

Since 2020, it has been published by Nigel Gourlay, Chapel-en-le-Frith. History The work is usually referred to as Lewis and Short after the names of its editors, Charlton T. Lewis and Charles Short. It was derived from the 1850 English translation by Ethan Allen Andrews of an earlier Latin-German dictionary, Wörterbuch der Lateinischen Sprache, by the German philologist Wilhelm Freund, in turn based on I.J.G. Scheller’s Latin–German dictionary of 1783. The Andrews translation was partially revised by Freund himself, then by Henry Drisler, and was finally edited by Short and Lewis.See the advertisement of the book itself, available on WikiSource. The division of labour between the two editors was remarkably unequal. Short, a very thorough but slow worker, produced material for the letters A through C, but B and C were lost by Harpers, meaning that his work now appears only in the letter A (216 pages), while Lewis, who worked in the time he could spare from his law practice, was solely responsible for the entries beginning with the letters B through Z (1803 pages). In 1890 Lewis published a heavily abridged version of the dictionary, entitled An Elementary Latin Dictionary, for the use of students. Sometimes called the Elementary Lewis, it is still in print today. The adoption of the book by Oxford University Press was the result of the failure of its own project to create a new Latin-English dictionary in 1875. Henry Nettleship and John Mayor had been commissioned to produce a new Latin dictionary based on a fresh reading of the sources, but after Mayor withdrew from the project, Nettleship was unable to complete it on his own; he eventually published his research as notes on Lewis and Short. While the Press had earlier published John Riddle’s 1835 translation of Scheller’s Latin–German dictionary, this was a much more expensive book. The Press thus adopted Harpers' Latin Dictionary as a stopgap measure, paying Harper and Brothers 10 per cent royalties. Harper and Brothers sold its rights to the American Book Company in 1899, shortly before its bankruptcy. From the time of its publication, many scholars have criticized the dictionary for its errors and inconsistencies.For example:     Because of various circumstances, however, no replacement was attempted until 1933, with the Oxford Latin Dictionary, which was completed in 1983. In 2020, Lewis & Short was reprinted under a new publisher. The dictionary's full text is available on-line from the Perseus Project. Lewis and Short is also available for offline consultation, by means of various applications. Comparison with other dictionaries Among classicists, Lewis and Short has been largely superseded by the Oxford Latin Dictionary, called the OLD for short. Lewis and Short incorporated material from existing Latin dictionaries; the OLD, by contrast, started from scratch, following procedures similar to those of the well-regarded Oxford English Dictionary. Thanks to the increased availability of modern editions, the OLD editors had access to a larger variety of classical works. Although classicists still consult Lewis and Short, they tend to prefer the OLD. On the other hand, Lewis and Short remains a standard reference work for medievalists, renaissance specialists, and early modernists, as the dictionary covers Late and Medieval Latin, if somewhat inconsistently. The OLD, when used on its own, rarely meets their needs, since it was decided early in the OLD's planning that the work would not encompass works written later than AD 200. A few exceptions were made for especially important texts from the late classical period, such as Augustine's De Civitate Dei, but for periods later than that the OLD is considerably less useful. The Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources supplements the OLD for medieval usage of Latin words. In cases where Lewis and Short do not answer a medieval usage question, J. F. Niermeyer's Mediae Latinitatis Lexicon Minus often supplies an answer. The Lexicon Minus was completed in 1976 by C. van de Kieft after Niermeyer's death, and has since become a standard reference work. More recent editions of the Lexicon Minus have corrections and expansions; also, in later editions all words are defined in English, French and German, making it of greater international importance than Lewis and Short. The Glossarium ad scriptores mediae et infimae latinitatis completed in 1678 by Charles du Fresne (commonly referred to as Du Cange after the author's title, the Sieur du Cange) is now less frequently used, as Niermeyer's Lexicon Minus incorporates much of its information. On occasion people confuse Lewis and Short (or L&S;) with Liddell and Scott, its Greek counterpart, entitled A Greek–English Lexicon. The 1945 and later editions of Liddell and Scott are commonly referred to by the abbreviation LSJ after the names of its editors Liddell, Scott and the editor of the 1945 revision, Jones.

His father worked as a garment presser and his mother in a clothes shop and during his childhood the family lived in a council flat in Tornay House, Shore Place, South Hackney. He attended Cassland Road School and enjoyed visits to the Hackney Empire, which was then a music hall and to the cinema to watch James Cagney films.London Magazine Celebrity Homes - Don Black . Retrieved 18 December 2015.John Nathan, \\"Don Black: Star lyricist puts a productive life into words\\", Jewish Chronicle, 2 September 2013. Retrieved 18 December 2015. Career =Early career= He began his music industry career as an office boy with a music publishing firm, and later worked as a song-plugger. He also had a brief spell as a comic. He was personal manager to the singer Matt Monro for many years and also provided songs for him (usually writing English language lyrics to continental songs). These included \\"Walk Away\\" (music: Udo Jürgens) and \\"For Mamma\\" (music: Charles Aznavour). =Film work= Black's first film work was the lyrics for the theme of the James Bond entry Thunderball (1965). His association with the Bond series continued over several decades, with Diamonds Are Forever and The Man with the Golden Gun, in collaboration with John Barry, and Surrender for Tomorrow Never Dies and The World Is Not Enough, in collaboration with David Arnold. Black's film work culminated when he collaborated with Barry on the title song of 1966's Born Free, which won the Oscar for Best Song and provided a hit for Matt Monro. Pianist Roger Williams made the US Top 40 with an instrumental version. The song was nominated for Song of the Year at the 1967 Grammy Awards. The movie's producer, Sam Jaffe, was not impressed with the song, fearing that Black had made too much of a political comment in the lyric, and initially had the film printed without it on the soundtrack. When it became a US hit, he relented and had the film reprinted, commenting to Black, \\"It grows on you,\\" after the song won the Oscar. Black later collaborated with Barry on The Tamarind Seed, Out of Africa, Dances with Wolves, and an ill-fated Broadway musical, The Little Prince and the Aviator. In 1967, Lulu took the Black-Mark London title song of the film To Sir, with Love to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Black received his second Oscar nomination for Best Song with the title theme, written with Elmer Bernstein, of the 1969 John Wayne western, True Grit. That same year, he partnered with Quincy Jones for the theme song of the Michael Caine film, The Italian Job, \\"On Days Like These\\". He received a third Oscar nomination for the title song of the 1972 film Ben, a US No. 1 hit for Michael Jackson, which Black had written with Walter Scharf. Further Oscar nominations came for \\"Wherever Love Takes Me\\" (music: Elmer Bernstein), from 1974 film Gold, and \\"Come to Me\\" (music: Henry Mancini) from 1976's The Pink Panther Strikes Again. In addition, Black teamed with Charles Strouse on the songs \\"Growing Up Isn't Easy\\" and \\"Anything Can Happen On Halloween\\" for the 1986 HBO film The Worst Witch, based on the children's book by Jill Murphy. =Musical theatre= Black's stage credits include the musicals Billy (music: John Barry), Bar Mitzvah Boy (music: Jule Styne), Dear Anyone (music: Geoff Stephens), Budgie (music: Mort Shuman) and several Andrew Lloyd Webber shows: the 1979 song-cycle, Tell Me on a Sunday, which was performed by Marti Webb (whom Black also managed for a time); Aspects of Love, which propelled Michael Ball to stardom; and, together with Christopher Hampton, the musical adaptation of the Billy Wilder film Sunset Boulevard. The latter brought Black and Hampton a Tony Award for Best Book. Tell Me on a Sunday was incorporated into Song and Dance. This was later adapted for a Broadway production starring Bernadette Peters, for which she won a Tony award as Best Actress in a Musical. Sarah Brightman released \\"Unexpected Song\\", from that musical, as a single. With Geoff Stephens he produced a concept album of a 'revuesical' entitled Off The Wall.The Guinness encyclopedia of popular music - Volume 1 - Page 426 1561591769 Colin Larkin - 1995 \\"renewed his partnership with Geoff Stephens for a concept album of a 'revuesical' entitled Off The Wall, the story of 'six characters determined ...\\" In 2002, he worked with the Indian composer A. R. Rahman on the musical Bombay Dreams. In 2004, Black's second musical collaboration with Hampton, Frank Wildhorn's Dracula, the Musical, debuted on Broadway. He also collaborated with John Barry once more, on the musical Brighton Rock. Based on the Graham Greene novel, it debuted at the Almeida Theatre, London, in 2004. In 2006, Black created the lyrics for the musical adaptation of the book Feather Boy, for the National Theatre in London. In 2011, Black wrote the lyrics alongside composer Frank Wildhorn for the 2011 Broadway production of Bonnie & Clyde which premiered at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre on 22 November 2011 and closed four weeks later due to poor ticket sales, despite the general public giving the show high praise for its score and the lead actors Jeremy Jordan (as Clyde Barrow) and Laura Osnes (as Bonnie Parker). The cast recording however became one of Wildhorn and Black's most successful musical scores. In 2013, he again worked with Christopher Hampton and Andrew Lloyd Webber on Stephen Ward the Musical. In 2015, he wrote the lyrics for Mrs Henderson Presents, with George Fenton and Simon Chamberlin composing the music. = Radio broadcasting = Black presented a Sunday night show on BBC Radio 2 from 2013 to 2020, which featured classic songs and songwriters of the 20th century, paid a weekly tribute to Matt Monro, whom he managed, and included many of his showbiz encounter stories. He took over this slot from the late David Jacobs. Legacy In 1993, Play It Again released Born Free – The Don Black Songbook, which remains the only album to date which consists solely of songs co-written by the lyricist. In 2007, Black was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. That same year, Black was credited on \\"Sexy Lady\\", the 2007 debut single and hit for rapper Yung Berg, which sampled the Black-Barry theme for Diamonds Are Forever. On 17 August 2008, the tribute concert Lyrics by Don Black was held at the London Palladium, featuring performances of Black's songs by a selection of guest artists. The evening, hosted by Michael Parkinson and recorded for broadcast by BBC Radio 2, included an exclusive performance of two songs from Black's new musical, The Count of Monte Cristo. The concert included contributions from Lee Mead, Gary Barlow, Elkie Brooks, Craig David, Maria Friedman, Joe Longthorne, Lulu, Peter Grant, Raza Jaffrey, Matt Rawle, Ryan Molloy, Marti Webb, Jonathan Ansell, Hayley Westenra, Phil Campbell and Mica Paris. The singers were accompanied by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Mike Dixon and with guest conductors Michel Legrand and David Arnold. In October 2013, a special concert to celebrate Black's work was held at London's Royal Festival Hall, featuring a lengthy interview with the composer by Michael Grade, interspersed by performances of his songs by artists such as Michael Ball, Maria Friedman, Katie Melua, and Marti Webb. The concert was recorded for television and first shown on BBC Four in early January 2014.  Personal life  Black lives in London, England. His wife of nearly 60 years, Shirley, died in March 2018. Black's elder brother, Michael Black, a showbusiness booking agent, was married to singer Julie Rogers until his death in November 2018.

The full publication title is The Holy Scriptures According to the Masoretic Text: A New Translation with the Aid of Previous Versions and with Constant Consultation of Jewish Authorities. Earlier translations The translation, which appeared in 1917, is heavily indebted to the Revised Version and American Standard Version. It differs from them in many passages where Jewish and Christian interpretations differ, notably in Isaiah 7:14, where it has \\"young woman\\" as opposed to the word \\"virgin\\" which is used in most Christian Bibles. The translation was initiated in 1892 by the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the organization of Reform rabbis, and the original intention was to assign different books of the Bible to individual rabbis and scholars. A committee of editors would ensure quality and consistency. It became clear after several years that this method was hard to implement, and after more than a decade only the Book of Psalms had been sent to press. In 1908 the Jewish Publication Society agreed to take over the project. The Jewish Publication Society's plan called for a committee of seven editors who would be responsible for the entire translation. They included Solomon Schechter, Cyrus Adler and Joseph Jacobs, from the Society, and Kaufmann Kohler, David Philipson, and Samuel Schulman, from the Central Conference of American Rabbis. They were led by Editor-in-Chief Max Margolis. The editorial committee comprised an equal number of faculty from Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City, and Dropsie College for Hebrew in Philadelphia. The work was completed in November 1915 and published two years later. The translators state their reason for a new version in their \\"Preface,\\" in a passage that suggests the emotional as well as rational need they felt for a Bible of their own: > The repeated efforts by Jews in the field of biblical translation show their > sentiment toward translations prepared by other denominations. The dominant > feature of this sentiment, apart from the thought that the christological > interpretations in non-Jewish translations are out of place in a Jewish > Bible, is and was that the Jew cannot afford to have his Bible translation > prepared for him by others. He cannot have it as a gift, even as he cannot > borrow his soul from others. If a new country and a new language > metamorphose him into a new man, the duty of this new man is to prepare a > new garb and a new method of expression for what is most sacred and most > dear to him. The translation is based on the Hebrew Masoretic text. It follows the edition of Seligman Baer except for the books of Exodus to Deuteronomy, which never appeared in Baer's edition. For those books, C. D. Ginsburg's Hebrew text was used. Book order The order of the books is Torah (the five books of Moses), Nevi'im (Prophets) and Ketuvim (Writings). Christian readers would note differences in the order of the books from the Christian Bible, as well as some breaks in where chapters begin and end (such as Deuteronomy 12:32 vs. 13:1), and also in Tehillim (Psalms) where the titles are often counted as the first verse, causing a difference of one in verse numbering for these psalms as they appear in Christian Bibles. Later translation This translation was superseded by the JPS Tanakh (NJPS), which appeared in a complete form in 1985. However, the 1917 version is still widely disseminated through its appearance in the commentaries of the Soncino Books of the Bible and the Torah commentary edited by Joseph H. Hertz. Further, it has influenced many subsequent 20th century translations by drawing attention to the Jewish view of many passages.

Biography =Career= Kari Kairamo had a master's degree in engineering (wood processing). Early on in his career, he had leading positions in several international firms in the paper industry. Nokia hired him in 1967, when it was still a major player in the forest industry. In 1977, Kairamo became CEO of Nokia after Björn Westerlund retired. Kairamo's mission was to build Nokia fast into an internationally large multi-industry company, and he led several courageous acquisitions for the company. The late 1980s was a very special period of time both for the Nokia Corporation and for Finland. The place Finland occupied on the map of Europe was about to change, and cold war and protectionism in the Finnish trade politics was about to break down. Kairamo saw the importance of Nokia, the biggest company in Finland, as a major agent in getting Finland closer to Western Europe, although at the same time he considered the Soviet Union to be an important trade partner and managed to retain close relations with major Soviet politicians and business leaders. =Death= Kari Kairamo committed suicide by hanging himself in his home on 11 December 1988, an act which Nokia at first attempted to hide. His sudden death by his own hand only served to strengthen his already legendary image. He had endless amount of energy and a stunning work efficiency. Suffering from bipolar disorder is also a commonly suspected reason for his tragic decision. As he was part of the Kihlman family, famous for their artists, some people close to the family suspect he was manic-depressive like many great artists.

He is the father of professional wrestler Kelly Kiniski and international amateur and professional wrestler Nick Kiniski. Early life One of six children of local politician Julia Kiniski, who emigrated from Poland, Kiniski grew up in Edmonton. At the age of seventeen he was over six feet tall. Kiniski wrestled and played football at St. Joseph's High School. In March 1947, he entered the annual Edmonton School's Boxing and Wrestling Tournament at Westglen gymnasium. Due to his size, he was the lone heavyweight competing.National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 212, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, Kiniski captured the attention of Annis Stukus, a scout for the Edmonton Eskimos, of the then Western Interprovincial Football Union in 1949, (which later merged with the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union to form the Canadian Football League). Along with Kiniski, wrestlers Al Oeming and Stu Hart were at the training camp as well. Two of his Eskimos teammates were future wrestlers Wilbur Snyder and Joe Blanchard. Kiniski secured himself a spot on the defensive line and his play earned him a scholarship to the University of Arizona. He was enrolled there from September 18, 1950 to January 26, 1952 and played on the defensive line for Bob Winslow. Rod Fenton recruited Kiniski into professional wrestling in Arizona in 1952. Kiniski returned to Edmonton to play football for the Eskimos, and he suffered a torn kneecap in the team's first game against Saskatchewan in August 1952. He retired from football in 1953 to resume wrestling full-time.  Professional wrestling career  = Early career = After retiring from football, Kiniski trained with Dory Funk and Tony Morelli for a wrestling career, eventually making his pro debut on February 13, 1952 in Tucson, Arizona, where he defeated Curly Hughes.Gene Kiniski career record at Vance Nevada's Wrestling Career Records Archive Kiniski's first exposure on television was in Southern California in 1954 alongside other wrestlers such as Wilbur Snyder and Bobo Brazil. One year later, he teamed up with John Tolos to win his first major championship, the International TV Tag Team title, in Los Angeles, then challenged NWA World Champion Lou Thesz in November 1954. As an emerging talent, Kiniski got the opportunity to wrestle Lou Thesz at the Olympic Auditorium on November 3, 1954. Kiniski lost in two straight falls. From there, Kiniski ventured to San Francisco and teamed with Lord James Blears to win the territory's version of the NWA World Tag Team title three times in 1955; after that, he went to Texas and, wrestling as Gene Kelly, captured the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship in 1956. = Toronto and Montreal = Kiniski began wrestling in his native Canada for the first time in November 1956, debuting for Toronto's Maple Leaf Wrestling. His first main- event match in the territory took place at Maple Leaf Gardens in January 1957, when he teamed with Buddy Rogers against Whipper Billy Watson and Pat O'Connor and saw the beginning of a lengthy feud with Watson that spanned across Canada; the Kiniski-Watson feud gained national exposure due to their matches sometimes being seen on CBC Television. He also challenged NWA World Heavyweight titleholders Watson, Thesz and Dick Hutton for the title on several occasions between 1955 and 1957. In 1957, Kiniski competed in Montreal and Toronto. His feuds with Whipper Billy Watson, Yukon Eric, Édouard Carpentier, and Pat O'Connor pushed his career further. Gene captured the British Empire title from O'Connor on May 2, 1957, and the Montreal version of the world title from Carpentier on June 12, 1957. Kiniski headlined a wrestling card at Delormier stadium in Montreal, where he dropped the Montreal world title to Killer Kowalski on July 17, 1957 in front of 21,000 fans. In 1959, Kiniski teamed with Don Leo Jonathan, \\"The Mormon Giant\\" to win the Canadian Open Tag Team Championship. = Championship runs = Kiniski joined the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in 1960 and defeated AWA World Champion Verne Gagne to win the title on July 11, 1961, also capturing the AWA World Tag Team title twice with Hard Boiled Haggerty. The title reign lasted less than a month. Kiniski won another title in West Texas a year later. In 1962, Kiniski began what became the peak period of his career when he went to Vancouver to join NWA: All-Star Wrestling. Early on, he won the NWA British Empire Heavyweight title twice and the Pacific Coast Tag Team title three times, and he challenged again for the NWA World title, taking on Rogers in a main event at Empire Stadium in Vancouver on July 30, 1962 (Rogers beat Kiniski to retain his title), and Thesz in 1963. He made Vancouver his home base while also making appearances in other promotions throughout North America and in Japan, particularly a lengthy stint in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) in 1964; while there, he challenged WWWF Champion Bruno Sammartino several times. Kiniski wrestled Sammartino on November 16, 1964 at Madison Square Garden. Thinking that he had pinned Sammartino in the second fall, Kiniski took the belt and left the ring. Despite being counted out, Kiniski kept the title until a rematch on December 14 settled the matter of who was the real champion. He also went to Dick the Bruiser's Indianapolis- based World Wrestling Association in December 1965 and captured its World Heavyweight title, holding it for four months. A few weeks later, Kiniski earned the opportunity to contend for the National Wrestling Alliance World Heavyweight title. The pinnacle of Kiniski's career finally came on January 7, 1966, when he defeated Thesz to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in St. Louis, Missouri in front of 11,612 fans at the Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis. = Heel champion = Compared to Thesz, Kiniski was a heel and was very comfortable in his role as a \\"bad guy\\" world champion. As world champion, Kiniski wrestled many well-known luminaries. These included Bobo Brazil, Dick the Bruiser, Johnny Valentine, Bill Watts, Édouard Carpentier, Pat O'Connor, and the Funks, Terry and Dory, Jr., respectively. He travelled worldwide to defend his title during his three-year reign as champion, including making frequent stops back in Vancouver to defend his title in NWA All Star, taking on challengers such as Lou Thesz, Don Leo Jonathan, Dutch Savage, Bill Dromo, Bearcat Wright, John Tolos, Chris Tolos, Abdullah the Butcher, Haystacks Calhoun, Bobby Shane, Dean Higuchi, Tex McKenzie and Paddy Barrett in the promotion. After stops in Honolulu, Tokyo, and becoming the first World Champion to appear in Los Angeles in more than 11 years in November 1968, Kiniski was exhausted. At the 1968 NWA Convention, Kiniski announced that it was time to step down. He agreed to lose the championship to Dory Funk, Jr., and eventually went down to a spinning toehold on February 11, 1969 in Tampa. However, he later claimed in a WWE DVD release that the manner of his loss was accidental, as he submitted early to the toehold believing that the match was a two out of three falls encounter. = Into the 1970s = The NWA World title loss was not the end of the line, however, as Kiniski continued winning championships in NWA All Star and elsewhere. He won the NWA Missouri Heavyweight title from Terry Funk in St. Louis on March 16, 1973, while back in Vancouver, he won the Pacific Coast Heavyweight title seven times from 1970 to 1979, and won the Canadian Tag Team title ten times between 1963 and 1976, and in Japan, he captured the NWA International Heavyweight title in 1970. He also got involved in the promotional side of the business when he joined forces with Sandor Kovacs and Portland promoter Don Owen to acquire the Vancouver territory in the late 1960s; that, combined with Kiniski's NWA World title reign at the time, helped make Vancouver a wrestling hotbed for several years, until Kovacs sold his share in the promotion to Al Tomko in 1977. Kiniski retained his ownership stake in NWA All Star until around 1983. Kiniski also wrestled for several months in 1970 and 1971 as a masked wrestler, \\"The Crimson Knight\\", on local TV (KPLR-TV) matches in St. Louis, Missouri. The storyline continued through numerous attempts to unmask the Knight (his mask was sewn onto his tights, making an easy removal impossible) before he was finally unmasked and revealed to be Kiniski. = Late career = Kiniski remained involved in the sport for a few more years, teaming periodically with his sons, Kelly and Nick, refereeing the main event of the inaugural NWA Starrcade (Ric Flair vs. NWA World Champion Harley Race in a steel cage) in 1983, and later promoting events for Stampede Wrestling and the AWA in Vancouver while occasionally stepping into the ring. His final matches as an active wrestler took place in Winnipeg's West Four Wrestling Alliance on February 25, 1992, defeating \\"Bulldog\\" Bob Brown, Bob Ryan and Randy Rudd in singles matches, teaming with Chris Jericho and Lance Storm to battle Brown, The Natural and Gerry Morrow to a no-contest in a six-man match, and being the last man eliminated by Morrow in a battle royal to fill the vacant WFWA Canadian Heavyweight Championship at a WFWA TV taping in Winnipeg.Vance Nevada's Canadian Wrestling Results Archive (February 25, 1992)Classic Battle Royal from 1992 featuring young Chris Jericho and Gene Kiniski's final match He acted as the cornerman for Dory Funk Jr. in a match between Funk and Nick Bockwinkel (with Verne Gagne) at Slamboree 1993. He was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 1996, and into the Tragos/Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in Newton, Iowa in 2004. In 2000, he was the interim president (commissioner) of All Japan Pro Wrestling's Pacific Wrestling Federation title governing body, but only while they searched for a permanent replacement for Lord James Blears and to present the vacant Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship to the winner of a tournament. The winner turned out to be Genichiro Tenryu; Kiniski left thereafter, and in 2001 the permanent PWF president was announced as Stan Hansen, who had competed in the tournament and lost to Tenryu in the semifinals.  Acting career  In addition to his sports pursuits, Kiniski went into acting on occasion, appearing in the 1978 Sylvester Stallone movie Paradise Alley, as well as Double Happiness (which also starred Sandra Oh) and the made-in-Vancouver cult film Terminal City Ricochet (with former Big Valley regular Peter Breck), playing a bit role as a policeman. On the TV side, he appeared as one of the wrestling legends interviewed on The Comedy Network series Wrestling with the Past, and he served as a commercial pitchman in several TV ads aired in the Vancouver area. He also made an appearance on an episode of the CBUT arts and entertainment magazine show Zero Avenue in 1993, discussing art with host/interviewer Christine Lippa in a Vancouver-area art gallery.  Death  On April 4, 2010, Jim Ross reported on his blog that Kiniski had \\"taken a turn for the worse and is battling to stay alive. 'Big Thunder's' cancer has spread to his brain and some speculate that is just a matter of time [before he dies]\\".Pro Wrestling Torch: Other News: Wrestling legend Gene Kiniski battling to stay alive Kiniski died on April 14, 2010, aged 81, at his home in Blaine, Washington. A celebration of his life was held on April 25, 2010 at Kiniski's Reef in Point Roberts, USA, where Gene often appeared at his son's Nick's tavern.

A common name is mother of thyme, but \\"creeping thyme\\" and \\"wild thyme\\" may be used where Thymus serpyllum, which also shares these names, is not found. It is native to central, southern, and western Europe.  Classification  Thymus praecox is in the genus Thymus belonging to the Serpyllum section. It has sometimes been reclassified as T. polytrichus.Brickell, C. & Zuk, J., Editors-in-Chief. The American Horticultural Society A-Z Encyclopedia of Garden Plants, First American Edition.

Found in the wild in Bosnia. * Thymus praecox subsp. skorpilii (Velen.) Jalas. Found in the wild in Bosnia. Uses =Cultivation= Thymus praecox is cultivated as an ornamental plant, used as an evergreen groundcover in gardens and pots. When maintained at a lower height it is used between paving stones in patios and walkways. It is drought tolerant when established. This thyme species (and Thymus serpyllum) has escaped cultivation in North America, and is a weed or invasive species in some habitats in the United States. =Cuisine= This thyme has a strong scent similar to Oregano. It can be used in cuisine. Like other species of thyme, T. praecox is characterized by substantial differences in essential oil composition from plant to plant. Plants which differ in this way are known as chemotypes and a geographical population will generally contain a mix of chemotypes. For example, studies of chemotypes in Greenland, Iceland, Norway, England, Scotland, and Ireland show that chemotypes span those countries rather than being geographically localized. Some of those areas contain greater chemotype diversity than others.

The Regulation Colours are the standard colours used in the armed forces of the countries falling under the Commonwealth of Nations.  British Armed Forces colours  United Kingdom military units usually carry two Regulation Colours: the Regulation Queen's Colour and Regulation Regimental Colour. These are often referred to as the standard or ensign. Colours are the identifying battle flags carried by military regiments to show where their respective troops should rally in battle. Originally these were 6'6\\" × 6' in size, though have now been reduced to 3'9\\" × 3', as regiments no longer carry their colours on the battlefield. = British Army = Prior to 1743, each infantry regiment of the British Army was responsible for the design and quantity of standards carried, often with each company having its own design. In that year King George II issued a royal warrant to require each regiment to have, as their first colour, the King's colour. It was also to consist of the Union Jack throughout, as a symbol of royal allegiance. The second colour was to be the colour of the facings (uniform linings) of each Regiment, with the Union flag in the upper canton. When Regiments had red or white facings, this was to be replaced by the red cross of St George on a white background. Regiments with \\"Royal\\" designation or named after the members of the royal family, regardless of facings, used blue regimental colours (plus the optional Union Jack canton), Irish regiments green facings. A second royal warrant was issued in 1747, requiring the Regimental number to be displayed on the colours. As many regiments at that time were known by the name of the Regimental Colonel instead of a number, this requirement was often ignored. On 1 July 1751 a third royal warrant was issued stating \\"No Colonel is to put his Arms, Crest, Device, or Livery on any part of the Appointments of the Regiment under his Command.\\" Company colours were phased out altogether, with the battalion colours of the regiment using the designs issued being the only sanctioned ones used. Over time, these colours have evolved to include the battle honours awarded to each Regiment, though these have also been limited. The last British Army regiment to carry its regimental colours into battle was the 58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot in January 1881 at the Battle of Laing's Nek during the First Boer War. Colours of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment Only one British Regiment carries more than two colours on parade. This is the Yorkshire Regiment, who carry four colours. The second pair consists of a stand of honorary battle flags, which are the original size of 6'6\\" × 6'. These honorary colours, 'Queen's Honorary Colour' and 'Regimental Honorary Colour,' were originally awarded to the 76th Regiment of Foot, which later became the 2nd Battalion of the Duke of Wellington's (West Riding Regiment) in 1808, by the Honorable East India Company for their distinguished services during the Battle of Ally Ghur and again at Delhi between 1802 and 1804.British Army website - Yorks Honorary Colours In 1948 the 1st and 2nd Battalions merged and retained the Honorary Colours. In 2006 the Duke of Wellington's Regiment merged with the Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire and the Green Howards to form the 'Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)'.British Army website - Yorkshire Regiment History Light infantry regiments (today The Rifles) plus the Brigade of Gurkhas do not use colours at all owing to their role (the latter, however, carries the Queen's Truncheon awarded in 1857 instead).  Guards Division  Unlike the rest of the Army, all five Foot Guards infantry regiments sport a different variant pattern. Given the status of the guards regiments as units under royal patronage and for the defence of the British Royal Family and facilities belonging to them, the design of the colours are: * Queen's/King's Colour - Scarlet with the regimental insignia, arms and battle honours * Regimental Colors - Union Jack with regimental insignia and any battle honours Unlike most infantry regiments all five carry all battle honours on both colours. Until the 1820s, the Guards infantry carried company colours alongside the regimental battalion colours. A 3rd colour, the Guards State Colour, is only used when the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are present. Only the Grenadier, Coldstream and Scots Guards use them. Their design is scarlet with the regimental insignia and arms at the centre with the Royal Cypher at the corners.

Biography Ferris spent his youth in Neumünster, Kiel, and then Bremen. A recurring theme of social exclusion is predominant in his music. He graduated from Hauptschule and served his apprenticeship as an auto mechanic. At the same time, he was a radio DJ and actor (e.g. Tatorthttps://www.daserste.de/unterhaltung/krimi/tatort/sendung/2012/hochzeitsnacht-100.html). Together with Flowin Immo and DJ Pee, Ferris founded the Freaks Association Bremen (FAB), which, in the quickly-growing German hip hop scene, achieved success rather quickly. They performed at several events, festivals, and on MTV and VIVA. In 1994, FAB released their first album Freaks, on the small indie label MZEE. Three years later, they disbanded over a private, professional dispute. Ferris moved to Hamburg and in with Tobi Tobsen and finds DJ Stylewarz, who turned out to be a patient live DJ that was more fitting to Ferris' musical style. He released several records on Yo Mama. In 1999, he released the single \\"Reimemonster\\" with fellow rapper Afrob, which was a success, and followed it with his first solo album Asimetrie. Later the same year he parted ways with Stylewarz, and wound up deeper in the Hamburg drug scene. His second LP Fertich was released in 2001, but the single \\"Flash for Ferris MC\\" and the corresponding music video don't fulfill the high commercial expectations. In 2003, Ferris released a musical autobiography, adequately called Audiobiographie and his last regular album Ferris MC. On 17 March 2006, his last single was released on the greatest hits album Düstere Legende'. It concluded Ferris' career as a hip hop artist.

She was a familiar figure on the University of Pennsylvania campus, often dancing on the College Green brandishing homemade flags painted with various political messages and vocally advocating nonviolent social revolution. On October 22, 1996, she committed suicide by self-immolation on the spot where she had often performed in an effort to engage Penn students in the progressive causes she championed; the packages of writings she delivered to six Penn students, two local residents, as well as Penn's campus newspaper and other news organizations contextualized her carefully planned suicide as both protest and a vehicle for her message. She changed her performance name to Kathy Change to indicate her commitment to political and social change. She was the daughter of Chinese academics who emigrated to America in the wake of the Chinese Revolution. Change was married to writer Frank Chin for five years. Life Change was born Kathleen Chang in Ohio in 1950. Her father, Sheldon Chang, was an engineer and a professor at the State University at Stony Brook, Long Island, New York. Her mother Gertrude (née Hung) was a writer. Her mother's father, William Hung, was one of the founders of Yenching University and later taught at Harvard. She had one brother. Her parents divorced while she was a teenager, leading to Chang's first suicide attempt. Her mother committed suicide when Kathy was 14 years old. Change graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in New York City and briefly attended Mills College and the Bronx campus of New York University. After she married Frank Chin in 1971, she returned to California. Her marriage lasted five years, and she attempted suicide again after it ended. The Iron Moonhunter (1977) In 1977, she wrote and illustrated a 24-page children's book, The Iron Moonhunter. The book purportedly retells a legend handed down by Chinese workers of the Central Pacific Railroad working on the First Transcontinental Railroad in the 19th century; the titular train was built using salvaged steel to rescue the restless spirits of workers who had died during construction in harsh mountain conditions. In 1981, Change moved to Philadelphia. Around this time, her life became increasingly defined by her political activism and by what many observers would term mental illness. The New York Times noted that she had seen psychiatrists off and on for her adult life, although friends were unaware if a specific illness had been diagnosed. For a brief period in the early 1980s, she squatted in an abandoned Philadelphia building with others in the Powelton Village neighborhood on the edge of Drexel University campus. She also for awhile lived nearby on Spring Garden Street. Around this time, she added an \\"e\\" to her last name, and informally changed her name to Kathy Change. By 1996, she had legally adopted the name Change. Activism Change was drawn to political activism for diverse causes for most of her adult life. In 1990, she was named \\"Freedom Fighter of the Month\\" by High Times magazine, recognizing her activism for cannabis legalization. For 15 years she gave colorful one-woman street performances on Penn's campus and around Philadelphia to protest the government, during which she danced, sang, played the guitar and electronic keyboard, waved handmade flags, and made speeches. These performances included a weekly presentation on Sunday afternoons at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In the final years of her Art Museum performances, she was joined by singer/songwriter David Downing, who wrote \\"Stop the Business (Transformation Day),\\" an anthem for her political movement. Change founded and led the Transformation Party, a political party that advocated a complete change of the government and society. An \\"emergency economy\\" would be created by workers in essential industries, which would allow the majority of citizens to form a more representative democracy. Death At 11:20 am, October 22, Change doused herself with gasoline in front of Peace Symbol, a stainless steel sculpture (Robert Engman, 1967; installed 1983) west of the Van Pelt Library and set herself on fire. Flames shot ten feet in the air as she danced in front of approximately fifty onlookers. Penn Police officer Bill Dailey tried to put out the flames with his jacket and was subsequently honored at a 1997 ceremony held by the school's Division of Public Safety, for attempting to prevent Change's suicide. A speech given at the event cited Dailey's \\"heroism under emotionally stressful and physically dangerous circumstances\\". After he noticed the flames from a distance and determined that a person was on fire, he attempted to extinguish the conflagration by wrapping her in his patrol jacket and rolling her on the ground. The flames restarted several times. She was taken to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania with burns over 100% of her body. Change was pronounced dead at 11:48 am. =Rationale= In a packet of her writings that she delivered to The Philadelphia Inquirer, the Daily Pennsylvanian, and several friends and acquaintances (six students and two local citizens) on the morning of her death, she explained the rationale behind her suicide: Change felt that she \\"need[ed] to do something sensational that will make headline news and people will have to stop and talk about me and the message that I'm trying to put out.\\" Legacy A memorial is held in her honor every year on October 22 at the peace sign sculpture on the University of Pennsylvania campus where Kathy died. The memorial attracts artists, activists and performers, among others. Percussionist/composer Kevin Norton wrote a suite for Kathy Change entitled Change Dance (Troubled Energy) in 2001 and was released late in 2001/early 2002 on the Barking Hoop label. Industrial metal band Fear Factory wrote the song \\"Slave Labor\\" referring to her suicide; it was included in the 2004 album Archetype. Drummer Tyshawn Sorey composed and performed \\"For Kathy Change,\\" a quintet in her honor, in March 2011. Soomi Kim wrote and performed in the biographical play \\"Chang(e)\\", directed by Suzi Takahashi, which premiered in 2013 and has had multiple performances since then, including New York City and Portland, Oregon. Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Quiara Alegría Hudes's 2016 play \\"Daphne's Dive,\\" based in Philadelphia, features a character closely resembling Kathy Change. The play is dedicated \\"in memory: Kathy Chang(e).\\" Actor (and writer) Shin-Fei Chen portrays \\"Peace Activist Kathy Change\\" in Andrew Repasky McElhinney’s 2019 film Casual Encounters: Philadelphia True Crime Confessions. Her scenes were shot on 35mm Kodak film, September 2018 in West Philadelphia.

It is located the west part of Sapporo city and the second largest of Sapporo's 10 wards. Neighbourhoods within Nishi-ku include Kotoni (琴似), Hachiken (八軒), Nijuyonken (二十四軒), Yamanote (山の手), Nishimachi (西町), Nishino (西野), Fukui (福井), Heiwa (平和), Hassamu (発寒), Miyanosawa (宮の沢), and Kobetsuzawa (小別沢).  Outline  The administrative offices of Nishi-ku are located in the Kotoni neighbourhood. Nishi-ku is the oldest area in a history of urban development in Sapporo. Sapporo Municipal Teine Memorial Museum (手稲記念館), Kotoni Tonden Historical Archives (琴似屯田歴史館資料室), and Mitobe Memorial Museum (三戸部記念館) are sites of historical interest whose focus is on the era of Japanese 'pioneers' in Hokkaidō. Geography Sankaku-yama in winter The eastern part of Nishi-Ku is flat with many residential and commercial areas, but the western part slopes into mountains. Sankaku-yama, located in the western part of the ward in the Yamanote area, is a 311.3m high triangle- shaped mountain and is a popular and easy hike. It leads to Okura jump stadium in Chuo-ku. Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo's practice field is also located in Nishi-ku, and is a popular site for the team's fans. Major parks in Nishi-ku are Noshi Koen and Miyagaoka Koen. Numerous other parks may be found, many located along the banks of the Kotoni-Hassamu-gawa and its tributaries. Hiking trails abound. One of the most popular begins from near the Heiwa-no-taki waterfall and leads to the summit of Sapporo's famous mountain, Mt. Teine in which the Olympic game was held in 1972 has some ski ground and an amusement park, located on the division line of Nishi-ku and Teine-ku, the city's northwesternmost ward. In the less built-up neighbourhoods of Nishino, Heiwa, Fukui, and Kobetsuzawa, it is not unusual for wildlife, such as red foxes (Vulpes vulpes schrencki) and Asiatic brown bears (Ursus arctos yesoensis) or their spoor, to be observed. Transportation Primary public transportation services are the Sapporo Municipal Subway, JR Hokkaidō, and bus services including JR Hokkaidō Bus and Hokkaidō Chūō Bus. The last four stations of the Tozai subway line's western end are located here, two of which were added in 1999.

A view of the English coastline from the viewing platform at Cap Gris-Nez It is between Wissant and Audresselles, in the commune of Audinghen. The cliffs of the cape are the closest point of France to England – from their English counterparts at Dover. Smothered in sea pinks and thrift, the cliffs are a perfect vantage point to see hundreds of ships, from oil tankers to little fishing trawlers, plying the waters below. On a clear day, the emblematic white cliffs of Dover on the English shore can be seen.  Etymology  Gris-nez literally means \\"grey nose\\" in English. It is derived from colloquial Dutch \\"grey cape\\"; officially, the Dutch name was Swartenesse (\\"black cape\\") to set it apart from Blankenesse \\"white cape\\" (Cap Blanc-Nez) to the northeast. The element -nesse is cognate to English -ness, denoting \\"headland\\", as in for example Dungeness or Sheerness. Geology View of the English coast from Cap Gris-Nez The cliffs of Cap Gris-Nez are made of sandstone, clay and chalk. They are mainly grey, which gives the cape its name. It is also a good place to collect fossils, which are mainly from the Jurassic period. One can find bivalves, gastropods and wood. In the sandstone layers with small pebbles, one can find teeth of fish and reptiles. Sometimes, larger ammonites are found in the sandstones. The cape is a regular stopover for millions of migratory birds. History The proximity of the cape to England led to the frequent destruction of the nearby village of Audinghen in wars between England and France. On the top of the cliff are the ruins of an English fortress, built by Henry VIII at the beginning of the 16th century. The English called the fort 'Blackness', a translation of the Dutch name Swartenisse.Colvin, Howard, ed., The History of the King's Works, vol. 3 part 1, HMS0 (1975), 388-9. ;Napoleonic Wars Napoleon stopped at the cape on 1 July 1803 whilst making an inspection of the coast around Boulogne-sur-Mer and of his invasion troops. He then envisioned setting up a cross-Channel optical telegraph, with a semaphore on the cape. The first semaphore of this line was installed on the cape in 1805, without waiting for the planned French invasion of England. On 18 July 1805, a memorable naval battle took place off the cape. A British flotilla with strong numerical superiority pursued Dutch ships that were following the coast and trying to get back into harbor of Ambleteuse. Expecting an attack of this type, Napoleon had stationed a battery of 300 guns on the cape, and a barrage from this force obliged the British vessels to withdraw. ;World War II Commandant Ducuing and his men died on May 25, 1940 while defending the semaphore, and a commemorative stela was later placed on the cape to commemorate this sacrifice. Later, the Germans built a blockhouse inside the Tudor ruins. The locality has a cluster of World War II bunkers, part of the Atlantic Wall intended to rebuff the anticipated allied invasion. There are heavy artillery sites – Grosser Kurfürst Battery, formerly with three 170 millimeter guns, and Todt Battery, with four 380 mm guns. These covered the approaches to both Calais and Boulogne and they were protected by massive concrete blockhouses and other lesser defensive sites. One of the Todt Battery blockhouses now houses the Atlantic Wall Museum. Units of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division liberated the area in September 1944. Sunset at Cape Gris-Nez ;Postwar The cylindrical concrete lighthouse at Cap Gris-Nez dates from 1958. It is 31 meters (102 feet) high, and replaces an earlier structure destroyed in 1944. The lighthouse and its accompanying radar station provide guidance to over 500 ships passing the cape every day.

The battle was fought between elements of the British Channel Fleet and the French Atlantic Fleet, which were cruising in the region on separate missions. The British fleet, commanded by Admiral Lord Bridport, was covering an invasion convoy carrying a French Royalist army to invade Quiberon, while the French under Vice-admiral Villaret de Joyeuse had sailed a week earlier to rescue a French convoy from attack by a British squadron. The French fleet had driven off the British squadron in a battle on 17 June known as Cornwallis's Retreat, and were attempting to return to their base at Brest when Bridport's force of 14 ships of the line appeared on 22 June. Villaret, believing that the stronger British fleet would destroy his own 12 ships of the line, ordered his force to fall back to the inshore anchorage off Groix, hoping to take shelter in protected coastal waters. Several of his ships were too slow, falling behind so that early in the morning of 23 June the rearmost ships of his fleet were caught by the British vanguard, overhauled one by one and brought to battle. Although Villaret fought a determined rearguard action, three French ships were captured, all with very heavy casualties, and the remainder of the French fleet was left scattered across miles of coastline. In this position they were highly vulnerable to continued British attack, but after only a few hours' engagement, concerned that his ships might be wrecked on the rocky coastline, Bridport called off the action and allowed Villaret to regroup inshore and retreat to Lorient. Although the battle was a British victory, there was criticism of Bridport's rapid withdrawal. British historians have subsequently considered that a unique opportunity to destroy the French Atlantic fleet had been lost. The invasion at Quiberon ended in disaster a month later, although Bridport remained at sea in the region until September. The French fleet by contrast was trapped in the port of Lorient where food supplies ran out, forcing Villaret to discharge many of his ships' crews. As a result, most ships did not return to Brest until the winter and were consequently unable to threaten British control of the French coastline for the remainder of the year. Several French captains were court-martialled following the battle, with two dismissed from the Navy for disobeying orders. Background The first two years of the French Revolutionary Wars had seen the French Atlantic Fleet, based principally at the Breton harbour of Brest, suffer a series of setbacks. The tense atmosphere in France following the French Revolution was reflected in the fleet, which suffered a mutiny in September 1793 followed by a purge of suspected anti-republicans which resulted in the death or imprisonment of a number of experienced commanders.James, p. 59Willis, p. 34 In May 1794, the French fleet sallied into the Atlantic to protect an incoming grain convoy from the United States and was attacked by the British Channel Fleet at the battle of the Glorious First of June, losing seven ships, although the convoy was saved. In the winter of 1794–1795, five more French ships were lost in a disastrous sortie in the middle of the Atlantic winter storm season known as the Croisière du Grand Hiver. By the spring of 1795, the British Channel Fleet was in the ascendancy, enforcing a distant blockade of the French fleet in Brest.Gardiner, Fleet Battle and Blockade p. 16 In May 1795, with much of the winter's damage repaired, the French commander Vice-amiral Villaret de Joyeuse sent a squadron of three ships of the line and several frigates under Contre- amiral Jean Gaspard Vence to Bordeaux with orders to escort a convoy of merchant ships carrying wine and brandy to Brest.Clowes, p. 255 On 8 June, as Vence's convoy passed the fortified island of Belle Île on the southern Breton coast they were discovered by a British battle squadron of five ships of the line and two frigates under Vice-Admiral William Cornwallis.Clowes, p. 256 Vence ordered his outnumbered ships to shelter under the batteries of Belle Île, and after a brief skirmish Cornwallis withdrew his forces with eight captured merchant ships. While Cornwallis was escorting his prizes to the mouth of the Channel, Vence sailed out of the Belle Île anchorage and discovered on 15 June that the main force of the Atlantic fleet had sailed to rescue him, a mission ordered by government over the objections of the fleet's officers that Vence would be able to easily extricate himself from the anchorage due to the proximity of the port of Lorient.James, pp. 237–238 On the morning of 16 June Cornwallis returned to the region, hunting for Vence, and instead discovered Villaret de Joyeuse with an overwhelming force. This time Cornwallis was forced to retreat, heading into open water with the French fleet in pursuit. Cornwallis was hampered by the poor sailing of two of his squadron, and on the morning of 17 June the leading French ships were close enough to open fire on his rearguard.James, p. 240 Throughout the day the French vanguard kept up a distant but continual fire on the rearmost British ship HMS Mars, until eventually the ship began to fall behind. In an effort to protect Mars, Cornwallis interposed his 100-gun flagship HMS Royal Sovereign between the British squadron and the French force, its massive broadsides driving the French back.Clowes, p. 257 At the same time, Cornwallis had ordered the frigate HMS Phaeton to range ahead of his squadron making false signals announcing the imminent arrival of a British fleet. These signals, in combination with the coincidental appearance of unidentified sails to the north, caused Villaret to become so concerned that at 18:40 he called off pursuit and returned to the French coast, allowing Cornwallis to return to Britain without further incident. The engagement was subsequently known as Cornwallis's Retreat.James, p. 241 Unbeknownst to either Villaret or Cornwallis, the British Channel Fleet was also at sea, having sailed from Spithead on 12 June with 14 ships of the line and 11 smaller vessels under the command of Admiral Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport. Bridport had been tasked with ensuring the safety of a convoy of transports, commanded by Commodore Sir John Borlase Warren, which carried a French Royalist army to Quiberon with the intention of triggering a counter-revolution in Brittany.Gardiner, Fleet Battle and Blockade p. 48 This force consisted of an additional three ships of the line, six frigates and more than 50 transports containing 2,500 French Royalists. The voyage across the English Channel and around the Ushant headland took seven days, the combined fleet and expeditionary force arriving off Belle Île on 19 June.James, p. 244 Bridport had ordered Warren to take his convoy on to Quiberon while the main body of the Channel Fleet stood further out to sea to intercept any attack by the French Atlantic Fleet, which Bridport assumed would advance southwards from Brest. What the British admiral did not know was that not only had the French fleet sailed a week earlier, they were still at sea – Villaret's ships having been blown southwards by a severe gale on 18 June and forced to take shelter in the anchorage off Belle Île.James, p. 243 Engagement off Groix =Villaret's retreat= alt=The island of Groix is near the French coast southeast of Brest. It was one of Warren's ships, the frigate HMS Arethusa, which first discovered the French as Villaret led his fleet out from the sheltered anchorage. Lookouts on Arethusa miscounted the French fleet, identifying 16 ships of the line and ten frigates; Warren immediately sent word to Bridport while ordering his convoy to turn away from the French.James, p. 244 Villaret did not pursue Warren's force: he may not have gauged its true strength correctly, and his ships were running low on provisions having taken aboard only enough for 15 days in their haste to leave Brest a week earlier.James, p. 238 On the morning of 20 June, Warren's force sighted Bridport's fleet to the south-east, the admiral sending orders to Warren to detach his three ships of the line to bolster Bridport's fleet in the face of the supposedly more numerous French force. Without waiting for these reinforcements, Bridport sailed back towards the coast against the wind, seeking to place his fleet between the Quiberon expedition and Villaret's ships.James, p. 245 The adverse southeasterly winds frustrated both fleets, and it was not until 03:30 on 22 June that lookouts on Bridport's scouting frigates HMS Nymphe and HMS Astrea finally discovered the French in the distance to the southeast, the British approximately from the French coast.Clowes, p. 261 On seeing the larger British fleet, to which Warren's detached ships had still not joined, Villaret ordered his fleet to turn back towards the land and Bridport followed, seeing that the French admiral did not intend to offer battle. To maximise his chances of catching the French, Bridport specifically ordered his \\"best-sailing\\" ships HMS Sans Pareil, HMS Orion, HMS Colossus, HMS Irresistible, HMS Valiant and HMS Russell, to break from the formation and lead the pursuit at 06:30.Brenton, p. 231 Bridport followed in his 100-gun first rate flagship HMS Royal George, accompanied by the remainder of the fleet, which included another 100-gun ship HMS Queen Charlotte and seven 98-gun second rate ships.Clowes, p. 260 All day the chase continued: at 12:00 the French fleet were approximately distant, and all through the afternoon the British ships slowly gained on their opponents, both sides hampered by long periods of calm weather. To ensure that his fleet was in a position to intercept the French whichever tack they took, Bridport split his fleet across a wide front, clustered in two trailing groups. At 19:00, Bridport signaled for his ships to attack the rearmost French vessels, and at 19:25 to attack French ships as and when they overhauled them, taking up mutually supportive positions. At 22:30 a calm fell, arresting both fleets until 03:00 on 23 June, when a light breeze from the south-west was enough to allow Bridport's fleet to push onwards so that as dawn rose the French were dead ahead. The main body of the French fleet was sailing in a loose cluster with three or four ships trailing behind and one ship, Alexandre under Captain François Charles Guillemet far to the rear and only from the British vanguard.James, pp. 245–246 Alexandre had been a British ship until November 1794, when she had been captured in a sharp engagement with a French squadron in which the ship had been badly damaged.Clowes, p. 262 The ship was a poor sailer, and its position was worsened by poor handling by Guillemet who did not follow Villaret's orders to form a line of battle rapidly enough.Rouvier, p. 210 Against expectation, Bridport's leading ship was Queen Charlotte, which had attained an unusually fast speed for a first rate through the carefully planned sailing of Captain Sir Andrew Snape Douglas. Immediately behind Douglas was Captain Richard Grindall in Irresistible, with Orion, Colossus, Sans Pareil and Russell a short distance behind the leaders and the rest of the fleet substantially to the rear. At 04:00, the island of Groix lay approximately to the east of Queen Charlotte, the French coastline behind it. It was to this region that Villaret was retreating, hoping Bridport would be reluctant to follow him into the confined waters around the well-fortified island, which lies on the entrance to the port of Lorient. The southern Breton coast was a notoriously dangerous region, where Atlantic gales could push ships towards poorly charted reefs and rocky outcrops.Gardiner, Campaign of Trafalgar p. 101 =23 June= NMM.alt=Sea scene. On the proper right three sailing ships with tattered sails and twisted masts are in group, smoke billowing from their sides. On the proper left are two more ships in a similar condition. Other ships are less distinct in the background and in the centre of the background is a large fort with cannon emplacements. With Alexandre now in danger of becoming isolated, Villaret sent the frigate Régénérée to take the lumbering vessel under tow at 05:00. Just under an hour later, Douglas brought Queen Charlotte within range, Guillemet firing his stern- chasers at his three-decked opponent.James, p. 246 Douglas responded with his bow-chasers, gradually bringing his main battery into range and joined by Captain Sir James Saumarez in Orion, which opened fire shortly after 06:00. The frigate captain, aware that his ship was powerless against two such opponents, abandoned the tow and sped ahead to rejoin the French fleet. Villaret's force had once more divided, with Formidable under Captain Charles Linois a little way ahead of Alexandre and Villaret in his 120-gun flagship Peuple ahead of Formidable. With the French admiral were Redoutable, Mucius, Wattignies, Tigre and Vence's flagship Nestor, while the remainder of the fleet had pushed on ahead and were now substantially advanced. Villaret sent signals to form a tight line of battle, and all French ships repeated the signal, but none executed the manoeuvre.Chasseriau, p. 240 At 06:15, Queen Charlotte passed Alexandre and began firing on Formidable, Linois returning fire against his much larger enemy for fifteen minutes before a fire broke out on the poop deck.Allen, p. 184 As the French crew scrambled to extinguish it, Sans Pareil, flagship of Rear-Admiral Lord Hugh Seymour, reached the ship and fired a broadside in passing, causing Formidable to lose speed and fall further back from the main body of the French. The fire from Queen Charlotte had reduced Linois's ship to a wreck, with the rigging torn and more than 320 men killed or wounded from a crew of 717.James, pp. 246–248 As Sans Pareil passed ahead of the battered ship, the mizzenmast on Formidable collapsed over the side and Linois, seeing the rest of the British fleet rapidly approaching, struck his colours and surrendered.Brenton, p. 232 As Sans Pareil and Queen Charlotte battled Formidable, Colossus and Russell, joined by the second rates HMS London and HMS Queen, pushed on to the French centre where Villaret's ships were awaiting them, the French admiral repeatedly attempting to form his ships into a line of battle to receive the British attack, without success.Rouvier, p. 212 At 07:00, four British ships and six French fought a confused melee while the French vanguard continued eastwards without pause and the slower portions of the British fleet struggled to come up in the light winds. The entire combat was slowly pulling closer to the fortified rocky island of Groix, close to which Villaret intended to shelter his fleet. Douglas in Queen Charlotte had been forced out of the engagement due to severe damage to his rigging and sails which made his ship unmanageable. At 07:14, he drifted past the shattered hull of Alexandre; Captain Guillemet opened fire briefly before surrendering as Douglas returned it with devastating effect.Clowes, pp. 262–263 Even as his ship fell back, Douglas continued to engage the French at long range, turning the guns on Peuple and Tigre, joined by Sans Pareil which attacked Tigre under Captain Jacques Bedout and forced it out of the French formation with severe damage. Villaret again attempted to gather his forces in support of Tigre, and even positioned his frigate ahead of his own fleeing ships in hope of cutting off their retreat and forcing them to imitate his own manoeuvres, but in vain; \\"they would have passed over my very body had not taken command and prevented a collision\\", he wrote in his report.Chasseriau, p. 242 As Tigre fell out of line, Queen and London joined the attack on the isolated ship, and Bedout was forced to surrender in the face of overwhelming odds.James, p. 247 The French ship had been severely damaged, with of water in the hold, the masts and rigging badly torn and more than 130 men killed or wounded, including Bedout, who had been hit three times.Rouvier, p. 213 At 07:57, Bridport's Royal George reached the combat, Douglas falling in behind his ship in anticipation of a renewed attack, the crew of Queen Charlotte having conducted enough hasty repairs to regain control of their ship. At 08:15 Bridport signaled Colossus under Captain John Monkton, the leading British ship more than ahead of the flagship, to return to the fleet. He repeated the order to Seymour in Sans Pareil who was almost as far advanced in combat with the retreating Peuple, on which Villaret's flag captain Jacques Angot had been killed in action.Décret no 1051 de la Convention nationale, Collection générale des décrets rendus par la Convention Nationale, Volume 51, Retrieved 28 April 2012 Bridport then pulled ahead in the pursuit, catching the badly damaged Peuple approximately west of Groix and firing one broadside at the French flagship and another at Tigre, which Bridport was not aware had already surrendered. At 08:37, ignoring the nearby Peuple and the remainder of the French fleet scattered between Groix and the River Laïta, Bridport turned away to the south-west followed by the British fleet.Clowes, p. 263 Aftermath Bridport gave instructions as he withdrew for Alexandre, Formidable and Tigre to be taken under tow by HMS Prince, HMS Barfleur and HMS Prince George respectively. The British fleet was in good condition: five ships had seen no action at all and of those that had fought, only Queen Charlotte had suffered any significant damage, principally to her rigging. The British fleet had lost 31 men killed and 113 wounded; Queen Charlotte and Colossus had the heaviest casualties of 36 and 35 respectively. Bridport placed prize crews on the captured vessels and sent them back to Britain while turning the fleet back eastwards once it had reached a safe distance from the coast, in order to provide support for Warren's expedition to Quiberon. Warren landed the French Royalist forces at Carnac on 27 June, but the invasion ended in disaster a month later, the surviving Royalists driven back to the coast and collected by Warren.Clowes, p. 266 Bridport had remained off Quiberon to ensure that Villaret did not return to harass the expeditionary force, returning to Britain on 20 September but leaving the bulk of the blockade fleet off the Breton coast under Rear-Admiral Henry Harvey. The 68-year-old Bridport was forcibly retired in October after an unrelated argument with First Lord of the Admiralty Earl Spencer, but was reinstated in 1796 and continued to serve in command of the Channel Fleet until 1800.Clowes, p. 267 Villaret meanwhile gathered his scattered ships and called a council of his senior officers on the frigate Proserpine to discuss their next course of action. The French admiral believed Bridport had only temporarily withdrawn and would be soon returning to continue the engagement. He therefore proposed to anchor off the Breton coast in a strong defensive position and await Bridport's attack. This scheme was vociferously opposed by Contre-amirals Kerguelen and Étienne Eustache Bruix who argued that in such a position the British would be able to use the weather gage to bombard the French at will and attack them with fireships.James, p. 249 Following their advice, Villaret decided to shelter the fleet in the nearby port of Lorient to seek supplies and repairs before returning to Brest. But he found that, having sailed without sufficient provisions, Lorient was not equipped for a fleet of such size and Villaret was forced to discharge the majority of sailors as he was unable to feed them. It was not until December and the winter storm season that a number of the ships were able to travel quietly up the coast to Brest, while others were sent southwards to Rochefort.James, p. 253 French casualties had been heavy, although they have not been reported other than on the captured vessels, which totaled 670 killed and wounded.James, p. 248 In the aftermath of the action, Villaret wrote a letter condemning the behaviour of a number of his officers, stating \\"Soit ignorance, soit ineptie, soit insubordination, malgré nos signaux réitérés, des ordres transmis par porte- voix, rien ne fut fait. Nos boulets atterissaient dans l'eau, le patriotisme à lui seul ne peut manoeuvrer un navire\\" (\\"Be it ignorance, ineptitude or insubordination, in spite of our repeated signals, nothing was done. Our shots landed in water, patriotism alone cannot manoeuvre a ship\\").Granier, p. 98 Several French captains were court-martialled: Jean Magnac of Zélé, already blamed for the failure at Cornwallis's Retreat, was dismissed from the Navy, as was Captain Giot-Labrière of Fougueux. Captain Larréguy of Mucius was censured for not adequately supporting Tigre, and three other captains were tried but acquitted.Rouvier, p. 214 In common with the battle of the Glorious First of June the previous year,James, p. 181 rewards for the British victory at Groix were unevenly distributed. Bridport's dispatch to the Admiralty was short and lacking in detail; the only officer commended was Bridport's own flag captain William Domett, whose ship had joined the action only in the last stages. The situation was worsened by the Parliament of Great Britain, which voted thanks for the battle but specifically named only Bridport, Lord Hugh Seymour and Vice-Admiral Sir Alan Gardner of Queen. This omitted not only the numerous captains who had taken part in the battle, but also Vice-Admiral John Colpoys of London, whose ship had been much more heavily engaged than Gardner's.Clowes, p. 265 Numerous historians have commented on these unexplained omissions, William James noting that Douglas and Queen Charlotte were particularly unfortunate in this regard as the admiral normally aboard, Rear-Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, was ashore at the court-martial of Captain Anthony Molloy and consequently the ship received no recognition despite being the most heavily engaged of any in the British fleet. All three captured ships were taken into the Royal Navy. The name of Alexandre reverted to the former Alexander, and although James suggests that the ship was never again fit for frontline service, this claim is refuted by Alexander's presence in the line at the Battle of the Nile in 1798 under Captain Alexander Ball.Winfield, p. 51 Tigre retained her French name, while Formidable, as there was already a ship by that name in the Royal Navy, became HMS Belleisle, apparently due to confusion between the islands of Groix and Belle Île in the aftermath of the battle.James, p. 250 Belleisle had a long and successful career, fighting at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 under Captain William Hargood. More controversial than the distribution of commendations was the debate over Bridport's decision to withdraw from the battle while the remainder of the French fleet was still within reach. In his official dispatch, the British admiral wrote that \\"If the Enemy had not been protected and sheltered by the Land, I have every reason to believe that a much greater Number, if not all the Line of Battle ships, would have been taken or destroyed\\", going on note that \\"When the ships struck, the British squadron was near to some Batteries [on Groix], and in the Face of a strong Naval Port [Lorient]. His subsequent concern for the Quiberon expeditionary convoy also demonstrates that he considered its protection his principal duty. But in the opinion of French admiral Kerguelen, \\"S'ils avaient bien manouevré, ils auraient pu, ou prendre tous nos vaisseaux, ou les faire périr à la côte\\" (If [the English] had manoeuvred successfully they could have taken all our vessels, or made them perish on the coast). Historians have considered this view and most agree that Bridport's retirement was premature: In 1827 James noted that the scattered remains of the French fleet could easily have been attacked by the unengaged British rear with the advantage of the weather gage, while William Laird Clowes wrote in 1901 that \\"We may be pretty sure that had a Nelson, a Hawke or even a Boscawen commanded on the occasion, the fleet of Villaret would have been annihilated.\\" Twenty-first-century historians Noel Mostert and Richard Woodman have compared Groix with the battles of Genoa and Hyères fought during the year in the Mediterranean, where in similar circumstances another elderly admiral, William Hotham, had also allowed scattered and retreating French fleets to escape when they might have been destroyed.Mostert, p. 164Woodman, p. 61 References Bibliography      Category:Naval battles involving France Category:Naval battles involving Great Britain Category:Conflicts in 1795 Category:Naval battles of the French Revolutionary Wars ","title":"Battle of Groix"},{"id":"2166309","text":"Irwin Allen Schiff (; February 23, 1928 – October 16, 2015) was an American libertarian and tax resistance advocate known for writing and promoting literature in which he argued that the income tax in the United States is illegal and unconstitutional.

As a result of these judicial rulings Schiff was in a hospital prison serving a sentence of 162 months (13.5 years) at the time of his death at the age of 87.

His parents were immigrants from PolandThe American Conservative: \\"Dr. Doom Runs for Senate\\" By Michael Brendan Dougherty October 1, 2009 and his father worked as a carpenter. In 1950, Schiff attended the University of Connecticut where he obtained a B.S. with a double major in Accounting and Economics.Schiff v. Commissioner, 47 T.C.M. (CCH) 1706, T.C. Memo 1984-223, CCH Dec. 41,174(M) (1984), aff'd per curiam, 751 F.2d 116, 85-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9108 (2d Cir. 1984). After college, Schiff was in the insurance brokerage business in Connecticut. In connection with his business, he was involved in a tax shelter in which he became the victim of a Ponzi scheme in which he lost money belonging to him and his clients.Jason Zengerle, \\"Hell Nay, We Won't Pay,\\" March 29, 2009, The New York Times, at .

(CCH) ¶ 9112 (2d Cir. 1979). before the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency in opposition to the removal of gold backing from Federal Reserve Notes. In 1976, he published a book entitled The Biggest Con: How the Government is Fleecing You. Schiff was a candidate for the Libertarian Party presidential nomination in 1996, and he participated in a Libertarian presidential candidates debate in Washington on July 5, 1996.Libertarian Presidential Candidates Debate, C-SPAN Schiff had a web site named \\"PayNoIncomeTax.com,\\" which offered his various books for sale. He was featured in Hollywood producer Aaron Russo's 2006 film America: Freedom to Fascism. Arguments raised by Schiff Among the arguments raised over the years by Schiff: # That the Internal Revenue Service, in enforcing the income tax, seeks to impose a tax not authorized by the taxing clauses of the United States Constitution; # That no statutory deficiency in Federal income tax can exist until an assessment has been made; # The filing of income tax is voluntary, and \\"voluntary compliance\\" is a misleading phrase used by the IRS to mislead the public; # That no tax assessment can be made unless a tax return has been voluntarily filed; # That the United States Tax Court has no jurisdiction over him; and # That the United States Tax Court is not a legal court, but is instead a part of the IRS. # That \\"income\\" as properly defined according to his reading of court decisions and statutes, is not wages, but only corporate profits. These arguments were ruled invalid in Schiff v. Commissioner.63 T.C.M. (CCH) 2572, T.C. Memo 1992-183, CCH Dec. 48,108(M) (1992). Another argument made by Schiff on his web site is: \\"On the 1040 itself... you report 'zero' income regardless of how much you received in: wages, commissions, interest, alimony, capital gains or from operating a business. For tax purposes, 'income' only means corporate 'profit.' Therefore, no individual receives anything that is reportable as 'income'.\\" This argument has been rejected by the lower courts, as well as the United States courts of appeal. See Cameron v. Internal Revenue Serv.;593 F. Supp. 1540, 84-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9845 (N.D. Ind. 1984), aff'd, 773 F.2d 126, 85-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9661 (7th Cir. 1985). Stoewer v. Commissioner;84 T.C.M.

According to his son, Peter Schiff, \\"my father was most known for his staunch opposition to the federal income tax, for which the US government labeled him a 'tax protester.' But he had no objection to lawful, reasonable taxation.\\"https://www.facebook.com/457030431120943/posts/an-open-letter-from- peter-schiff-my-father-irwin-a-schiff-was-born-feb-23rd-1928/540324432791542/ Convictions for 1974 and 1975 tax years Schiff had filed income tax returns through the tax year 1973. For years 1974 and 1975, however, he refused to disclose his income. Instead, he sent unsigned 1040 forms to the Internal Revenue Service with the title (\\"U.S. Individual Income Tax Return\\") changed to read \\"U.S. Individual Income Confession.\\" Instead of disclosing income, he included assertions of various constitutional rights on the forms, claiming essentially that under the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Thirteenth Amendments he would not be an \\"involuntary serf\\" of the U.S. government. Schiff contended that because Federal Reserve notes were not backed by gold, they were not \\"income\\" for purposes of the Federal income tax. Schiff began conducting seminars on Federal income taxes in 1977. On April 12, 1978, Schiff appeared on the NBC television program The Tomorrow Show with host Tom Snyder, arguing his views on Federal income taxes. Six days after his appearance on The Tomorrow Show, Schiff was charged with willful failure to file tax returns for the years 1974 and 1975.See . The modified, unsigned 1974 and 1975 forms, with no income information on them, were deemed by the Internal Revenue Service not to be valid Federal income tax returns under . During the resulting trial, a videotape of the television program was shown to the jury. Schiff was convicted on both counts and appealed his conviction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. At the Court of Appeals, the admission of the videotape was ruled unduly prejudicial, the conviction was overturned, and the case was remanded for a new trial. He was convicted a second time for failure to file, and that conviction was affirmed.United States v. Schiff, 647 F.2d 163 (2d Cir. 1981). Convictions for 1980 through 1982 tax years In October 1985, Schiff was convicted of tax evasionSee . with respect to his personal income taxes for years 1980, 1981, and 1982, and willful failure to file a corporate tax return for Irwin A. Schiff, Inc. (a company for which he served as president), and that conviction was affirmed the following year.See United States v. Schiff, 801 F.2d 108 (2d Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 945 (1987) and United States v. Schiff, 2003-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 50,546 (D. Nev. 2003). Schiff was released from the Federal prison system in June 1993. Despite having spent four years in the system, he continued his tax protest related activities. Civil tax problems for tax years 1979 through 1985 In June 2004, a Federal court ruled that Schiff was liable for over $2 million in taxes, penalties and interest for the years 1979 through 1985. In that case, Schiff's attorney had filed a brief claiming a diminished capacity defense, contending that Schiff had been diagnosed with a chronic, severe delusional disorder relating to his beliefs about the federal income tax system. That was characterized by some of his opponents as a claim that those beliefs were the product of a delusion or even insanity and that Schiff had willingly allowed his defense counsel to raise such an argument. Schiff responded to these claims and stated that the diminished capacity defense was an attempt to prevent the judge from rendering a summary judgment and instead allow a jury trial. Schiff also asserted that this was different from an insanity defense. Schiff, in his statement on the matter, asserted that the judge erred in not putting this question to the jury and insisted that \\"(1) no one is required to pay income taxes; (2) the entire federal judiciary is involved in a monumental, criminal conspiracy to collect income taxes in violation of law.\\" , Schiff's internet web site still included a claim that the U.S. federal income tax had been repealed in the 1950s and that U.S. officials were engaged in a conspiracy: \\"Since the income tax was repealed in 1954 when Congress adopted the 1954 Code, it is clear that for 50 years federal judges in conspiracy with U. S. Department of Injustice prosecutors have been illegally and criminally prosecuting people for crimes that do not exist in connection with a tax that nobody owes.\\" Case regarding The Federal Mafia The Federal Mafia is a book written by Schiff, while in prison. His son Peter Schiff referred to him as a political prisoner.See generally United States v. Heath, opinion, May 19, 2008, case no. 05-81115, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. In the book, Schiff contended that the income tax system and Internal Revenue Service were illegal. On August 9, 2004, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found the book to be fraudulent and upheld an injunction issued by a U.S. District Court in Nevada under against Irwin Schiff and associates Cynthia Neun and Lawrence Cohen against the sale of this book by those persons.United States v. Schiff, 379 F.3d 621, 2004-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 50,328 (9th Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 812, 126 S. Ct. 334 (2005). The injunction relates to \\"specified conduct\\" subject to penalties under and . The prohibition does not extend to other sellers of the book. The court rejected Schiff's contention on appeal that the First Amendment protects sales of the book, as the court found that the information it contains is fraudulent, as it advertised that it would teach buyers how to legally cease paying federal income taxes.See also footnote 1, United States v. Schiff, 2008-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 50,111 (9th Cir. 2007), citing United States v. Schiff, 379 F.3d 621, 630 (9th Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 812, 126 S. Ct. 334 (2005), regarding the Court's finding that the book The Federal Mafia: How the Government Illegally Imposes and Unlawfully Collects Income Taxes constituted \\"fraudulent commercial speech\\". Schiff, Neun, and Cohen were barred under the injunction from selling or advertising material advocating nonpayment of tax, from preparing a tax return for others, and from otherwise providing assistance or encouragement to others in violating tax law. Schiff and his associates were additionally required to provide a copy of the injunction to each of their customers, post it on their website, and provide the government with a customer list.United States Department of Justice press release regarding The Federal Mafia case Schiff and his associates responded by providing the book for free on their website.Federal Mafia Schiff's followers In 2003, the Internal Revenue Service had identified about 5,000 tax returns filed by about 3,100 of Schiff's customers in a three-year period, reportedly representing about $56 million in attempted tax evasion.United States v.

On December 26, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed Schiff's convictions except for the criminal contempt convictions. The Court vacated the contempt convictions because of the failure of the trial court judge to file contempt orders under rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

Location and status Fairlie Castle in the 1840s. Fairlie sits on the eastern shore of the Firth of Clyde and looks across to the Isle of Arran and the Cumbraes. It is currently little more than a commuter village, with few businesses still running within Fairlie. These include the \\"Village Inn\\" (a pub and restaurant) and a petrol station According to the 2001 census, Fairlie counted 1,510 residents. Fairlie House near Gatehead, Ayrshire in East Ayrshire was named after the Fairlie family of Fairlie; it previous name had been Little Dreghorn. History King David I of Scotland appointed Sir Richard de Morville, a Norman, to hold land in Scotland. Thus he became High Constable of Scotland and Lord of Cunninghame, Largs and Lauderdale. This piece of land was later sub-divided among Richard's relatives and friends, and, in the 13th century, the land of Fairlie was held by the de Ros (or Ross) family of Tarbert, the land to the North was held by the Boyle family and to the South by the Sempill family. It was one of the sons of the Ross family who built the Castle and adopted the name Fairlie. The family continued to live in the Castle until the 17th century, but by the end of the 19th century the castle was in ruins (the Castle has been sold in 1999 to be converted into a dwelling). It has many similarities to Law Castle, Little Cumbrae Castle, and the tower of Skelmorlie Castle. The land to the South of Fairlie Burn, held by the Sempill family, was never held by the Fairlie family and is actually in the Parish of West Kilbride. The Montgomerie family latterly held the estate (Southannan). The original building of Southannan House or Castle was demolished in the 18th century and the present house was built some time later. To the North of Fairlie are the Kelburn lands, with a fine castle, where members of the Boyville (Boyle) family have been since the 12th century. A David Boyle was honoured in 1703 by being created Viscount Kelburn and Earl of Glasgow. One of the later Earls, in 1850, had a wall built round the estate to give work to the poor people of the area. The present Earl has greatly improved and developed the estate. It is now a country centre, open to the public, and attracts many visitors from far and wide. According to ancient records it would appear that Fairlie developed as a fishing village, as it had a good, sheltered anchorage that was fully used in the 16th century. Weaving also began to help the prosperity of the village as the demand for Paisley shawls increased. The cottages below Fairlie Castle (Burnfoot) were known as Weaver's Row. A bit further North was the \\"middle row\\" (Ferry Row), where the fishermen and ferrymen lived. The remains of the old ferry quay can still be seen. This became known as Knox's Rocks as Knox White, an old Fairlie worthy, hired boats in this area in the 1920s and 1930s. Still further north was \\"north row\\", an indeterminate group of modest dwellings (the Bay Street area). The families kept pigs and hens, grew fruit and vegetables - the more affluent had a cow - other necessities of life were obtained from peddlers, who traveled the countryside. An occasional visit to Largs (by foot) especially to Hyndman's market or to Colm's (Columba's) Day fair. A turnpike road was built from Greenock to Stranraer in the 18th century and merchants and master mariners began to move into Fairlie. The channel between Fairlie and Cumbrae (Fairlie Roads) was a popular anchorage for merchant shipping, mainly to avoid the dangers of press-gangs at Greenock and the customs could be easier avoided at Fairlie. The old cottages, in time, were improved and some enlarged, new buildings were erected. Some of the originals are Rockhaven (the Ferry Inn), Fairlie Lodge, Beach House, Allanbank, Fairlie Cottage and part of Brookside. It was in the late 18th century that John Fyfe came from Kilbirnie to set up business as a cartwright in Fairlie. His son William (1785–1865) founded the Fife & Son shipyard in Fairlie in 1803 to which William's grandson William Fife III (1857–1944) brought international recognition as a prolific designer and builder of sailing yachts. MOD base and other facilities Fairlie in the 1840s. The Royal Navy ASDIC research establishment moved from its base at Portland to Fairlie in November 1940 and took over the Fife & Son shipyard. They also worked on other forms of anti-submarine warfare and in 1941 developed the Fairlie Mortar. This was not very successful but evolved into the very successful Squid. A boom defence depot remained post-war and there was a plan for an anti-submarine boom from Fairlie to Great Cumbrae then continuing to Bute.Shield of Empire - the Royal Navy and Scotland, Brian Lavery, Birlinn 2007, In recent years a succession of industrial and military developments has somewhat changed the character of the village. Hunterston B nuclear power station, Hunterston deep sea shipping terminal and a NATO base have been built along the shoreline.  Fairlie Pier  Fairlie Pier, closed in 1971, provided links to Clyde ferry services and the Largs Branch.

Flathead galaxias are found in lowland habitats, while the mountain galaxias species complex, containing at least seven species of Galaxias (research is ongoing) are found in upland habitats, as well as \\"midland\\" or upland/lowland transitional habitats.

It has an olive green back and sides with indistinct grey to green blotches and silvery bottom. Adults are commonly 9 cm but found up to 12 cm long. Conservation Serious concerns exist for flathead galaxias. They, along with a number of other small native forage fish, are disappearing from vast tracts of the Murray-Darling basin. The species is considered extinct in South Australia. Along with river regulation, destruction of water clarity and submergent macrophytes (\\"water weed\\") by exotic, illegally introduced common carp (Cyprinus carpio) appear to be having a devastating effect on this species.

Irving Thomas Stuttaford, (4 May 1931 – 8 June 2018) was a British medical doctor, columnist, and politician who served as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Norwich South between 1970 and 1974. In 2002 he retired as Senior Medical Advisor for Barclays Bank. Early life The third child of Dr William Stuttaford, MC and his wife, Marjorie (née Royden), Stuttaford was born in Horning, Norfolk. He was educated at Gresham's SchoolI Will Plant Me a Tree: an Illustrated History of Gresham's School by S.G.G. Benson and Martin Crossley Evans (James & James, London, 2002) and Brasenose College, Oxford. Personal life Married to Pamela Ropner on 1 June 1957, the couple had three sons: Andrew, Thomas, and Hugo. Pamela Stuttaford died on 4 July 2013. Career =Medicine= Stuttaford qualified as a doctor in 1959, working at the Hammersmith Hospital before joining his uncle's general practice in rural east Norfolk. Later he helped set up a general practice in Norwich where he remained until being elected as an MP in 1970. He continued practicing medicine as a consultant for Bupa for most of his time in parliament. After losing his seat, Stuttaford remained with BUPA for quite a few more years, but took on other medical jobs including acting as medical adviser to a number of companies, and specializing in genitourinary medicine at the Royal London and Queen Mary's Hospitals, as well as Moorfields Eye Hospital. He also was a partner in a small private practice. =Politics= From 1970–74 Stuttaford was the Conservative MP for Norwich South. He was a frequent dissenter from the Conservative Government's line in Parliament, including over the introduction of value added tax (VAT) on children's shoes, the ending of free school milk in primary schools,Philip Norton - Conservative Dissidents: Dissent Within The Parliamentary Conservative Party 1970-74 and the introduction of museum charges.Philip Norton - Conservative Dissidents: Dissent Within The Parliamentary Conservative Party 1970-74 He also took a leading role within parliament in the campaign, led by The Sunday Times, to secure compensation for children born with birth defects arising out of their mothers' use of the drug Thalidomide during pregnancy.Judy Bachrach - Tina and Harry Come to America: Tina Brown, Harry Evans and the Uses of Power Stuttaford lost his Norwich South seat to John Garrett in the first general election of 1974. In two subsequent elections he was selected as the Conservative candidate in the Isle of Ely to oppose Clement Freud, who had won the seat for the Liberal Party in a by-election in 1973 after the death of Sir Harry Legge-Bourke. Freud later increased his majority in the first 1974 election. Stuttaford was first selected to oppose Freud for 1974's second general election. In their first contest Freud's majority was sharply reduced. Stuttaford was then selected to challenge Freud again. In the 1979 general election Stuttaford received the highest number of Conservative votes ever recorded in the constituency, but the collapse of the Labour vote (many former Labour voters switched their support to the Liberals) ensured that Freud was again returned, this time with a slightly increased majority. =Medical journalism= In 1981, Stuttaford was recruited by the then editor of The Times, Harold Evans, to be the paper's medical correspondent. Stuttaford had worked with Evans during the latter's campaign to secure compensation for the victims of Thalidomide. Later, Stuttaford became \\"The Times\\" medical columnist, a role he retained until January 2009. In the years that followed he continued to write the regular monthly column for The Oldie that he had begun in 1994. He filed his last piece for the magazine just a few days before his death. He was a frequent contributor to Healthspan, an online retailer of vitamin supplements,Healthspan – About Us and occasionally to other national newspapers and journals. He was accused by Dr Ben Goldacre in The Guardian of using an article in The Times to promote energy replacement pills that appear to have nothing more than a placebo effect.Ben Goldacre, \\"Pep, zing, oomph, energy.

It is one of many LGBT-welcoming church movements to emerge in American Christianity beginning in the 1980s. left AWAB was established by about ten congregations in 1993 during that year's ABCUSA Biennial in San Jose, California. It grew out of a group called American Baptists Concerned for Sexual Minorities, which was founded in 1972 and which merged with AWAB in 2003. As of 2012 AWAB had 76 member congregations. These congregations are affiliated with the American Baptist Churches USA, the Baptist Peace Fellowship of North America, the Alliance of Baptists, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and the United Church of Christ. Informal partners of AWAB include the Roger Williams Fellowship, the Coalition for Baptist Principles, and Baptists without Borders. In addition to the member congregations and informal partner organizations, AWAB has a number of local affiliated groups, member organizations, one member seminary and thousands of Friends around the world. Beyond Baptist circles, AWAB cooperates ecumenically with welcoming and affirming organizations in other Christian denominations and faith traditions. AWAB is a partner in the Institute of Welcoming Resources and publishes an electronic newsletter, \\"Welcoming Spirit\\". The national offices of AWAB are in Kensington, Maryland.

It occurs when the rate of depolarization of the sinoatrial node falls below the rate of the atrioventricular node. This dysrhythmia also may occur when the electrical impulses from the SA node fail to reach the AV node because of SA or AV block. It is a protective mechanism for the heart, to compensate for the SA node no longer handling the pacemaking activity, and is one of a series of backup sites that can take over pacemaker function when the SA node fails to do so. Signs and symptoms Junctional rhythms (if a bradycardia) can cause decreased cardiac output. Therefore, the person may exhibit signs and symptoms similar to other bradycardia such as lightheadedness, dizziness, low blood pressure, and fainting. This rhythm can usually be tolerated if the rate is above 50 beats per minute. Cause A junctional escape complex is a normal response that may result from excessive vagal tone on the SA node (e.g. digoxin toxicity), a pathological slowing of the SA discharge, or a complete AV block. Diagnosis *Rate: 35–60 bpm *Rhythm: Irregular in single junctional escape complex; regular in junctional escape rhythm. *P waves: Depends on the site of the ectopic focus. They will be inverted, and may appear before or after the QRS complex, or they may be absent, hidden by the QRS. *P-R interval: If the P wave occurs before the QRS complex, the interval will be less than 0.12 seconds. *QRS Complex: Usually normal in duration and morphology, less than 0.12 seconds.

In humans, bradycardia is generally defined to be a rate of under 60 beats per minute. A normal heartbeat in human is usually at a rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute. Signs and symptoms The decreased heart rate can cause a decreased cardiac output resulting in symptoms such as lightheadedness, dizziness, hypotension, vertigo, and syncope. The slow heart rate may also lead to atrial, junctional, or ventricular ectopic rhythms. Bradycardia is not necessarily problematic. People who regularly practice sports may have sinus bradycardia, because their trained hearts can pump enough blood in each contraction to allow a low resting heart rate. Sinus bradycardia can also be an adaptive advantage; for example, diving seals may have a heart rate as low as 12 beats per minute, helping them to conserve oxygen during long dives. Sinus bradycardia is a common condition found in both healthy individuals and those who are considered well conditioned athletes. Heart rates considered bradycardic vary by species; for example, in the common housecat, a rate of under 120 beats per minute is abnormal. Generally, smaller species have higher heart rates while larger species have lower rates.  Pathophysiology & etiology  * Sinus bradycardia is commonly seen in normal healthy persons and athletes in the absence of pathophysiological diseases or conditions. * Different factors or etiologies could lead to the dysfunction of the sinus node, causing a malformation or prolongation of the impulse. *In terms of pathophysiological diseases, sinus rhythm may be caused by: **Diseases/Conditions: ***Acute myocardial infarction, carotid sinus syndrome, eating disorders (such as anorexia nervosa) rhodotoxin poisoning, hypothermia, hypothyroidism, infections (such as diphtheria, acute rheumatic fever, or viral myocarditis), intrinsic disease of the SA node (such as sick sinus syndrome), Roemheld syndrome, sleep apnea **Physiological causes: *** Increased vagal tone, increased intracranial pressure ** Medications, most commonly: digitalis glycosides, beta-blockers, quinidine, adenosine, calcium channel blockers, class I antiarrhythmic agents, ivabradine, clonidine, reserpine, cimetidine, lithium, amitriptyline Diagnosis Diagnosis of sinus bradycardia can be confirmed by an electrocardiogram that shows the following characteristics: *Rate: Less than 60 beats per minute. *Rhythm: Regular. *P waves: Upright, consistent, and normal in morphology and duration. *PR interval: Between 0.12 and 0.20 seconds in duration. *QRS complex: Less than 0.12 seconds in width, and consistent in morphology. Taking a thorough medical history and physical exam by healthcare providers can also help with narrowing differential diagnosis. Any recent changes to patient's medication history, new symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath and palpitations, family history of sinus bradycardia, physical exam that reveals cyanosis, peripheral edema, altered mental status, dyspnea, rales and crackles are all relevant information to consider for differential diagnosis.

He was born in 1886 in Karelichy near Minsk, and was murdered May 1, 1944 in Auschwitz. Biography Soon after his birth Katzenelson's family moved to Łódź, Poland, where he grew up. He worked as a teacher, founding a school, and as a dramatist in both Yiddish and Hebrew, starting a theatre group which toured Poland and Lithuania. Following the German invasion of Poland in 1939 he and his family fled to Warsaw, where they got trapped in the Ghetto. There he ran an underground school for Jewish children. His wife and two of his sons were deported to the Treblinka extermination camp and murdered there. Katzenelson participated in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising starting on April 19, 1943. To save his life, friends supplied him and his surviving son with forged Honduran passports. They managed to leave the ghetto but later ended up in Germans hands as part of the Hotel Polski affair. He was deported to a detention camp in Vittel, France, where the Nazis held American and British citizens and nationals of other Allied and neutral countries, for possible later prisoner exchange. In Vittel, Katzenelson wrote Dos lid funem oysgehargetn yidishn folk (\\"Song of the Murdered Jewish People\\"). He put the manuscript in bottles and buried them under a tree, from where it was recovered after the war. A copy was sewn into the handle of a suitcase and later taken to Israel. In late April 1944, Itzhak Katzenelson and his son Zvi were sent on a transport to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where they were murdered on May 1, 1944. Katzenelson was issued a Paraguayan passport issued by Ładoś Group.

In adults, sinus tachycardia is defined as a heart rate greater than 100 beats/min (bpm). The normal resting heart rate is 60–100 bpm in an average male adult and 60-90 bpm in an average female adult. Normal heart rate varies with age, from infants having faster heart rates (110-150 bpm) and the elderly having slower heart rates. Sinus tachycardia is a normal response to physical exercise, when the heart rate increases to meet the body's higher demand for energy and oxygen, but sinus tachycardia can also indicate a health problem. Thus, sinus tachycardia is a medical finding that can be either physiological or pathological. Signs and symptoms Tachycardia is often asymptomatic. It is often a resulting symptom of a primary disease state and can be an indication of the severity of a disease. If the heart rate is too high, cardiac output may fall due to the markedly reduced ventricular filling time. Rapid rates, though they may be compensating for ischemia elsewhere, increase myocardial oxygen demand and reduce coronary blood flow, thus precipitating an ischemic heart or valvular disease. Sinus tachycardia accompanying a myocardial infarction may be indicative of cardiogenic shock. Cause Sinus tachycardia is usually a response to physiological stress, such as exercise, or an increased sympathetic tone with increased catecholamine release, such as stress, fright, flight, and anger. Other causes include: *Pain *Fever *Anxiety *Dehydration *Malignant hyperthermia *Hypovolemia with hypotension and shock *Anemia *Heart failure *Hyperthyroidism *Mercury poisoning *Kawasaki disease *Pheochromocytoma *Sepsis *Pulmonary embolism *Acute coronary ischemia and myocardial infarction *Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease *Hypoxia *Intake of stimulants such as caffeine, theophylline, nicotine, cocaine, or amphetamines *Hyperdynamic circulation *Electric shock *Drug withdrawal *Porphyria *Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy *Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome *Mitral Valve Prolapse Diagnosis A 12 lead ECG showing sinus tachycardia Sinus tachycardia is usually apparent on an ECG, but if heart rate is above 140 bpm the P wave may be difficult to distinguish from the previous T wave and one may confuse it with a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or atrial flutter with a 2:1 block. Ways to distinguish the three are: * Vagal maneuvers (such as carotid sinus massage or Valsalva's maneuver) to slow the rate and identification of P waves * administer AV blockers (e.g., adenosine, verapamil) to identify atrial flutter with 2:1 block Heart sounds should also be listened to. =ECG characteristics= *Rate: Greater than or equal to 100. *Rhythm: Regular. *P waves: Upright, in leads I, II and aVL, and negative in lead aVR; * each P wave is followed by a QRS and T waves =Inappropriate sinus tachycardia= In inappropriate sinus tachycardia (also known as chronic nonparoxysmal sinus tachycardia), patients have elevated resting heart rate and/or exaggerated heart rate in response to exercise. These patients have no apparent heart disease or other causes of sinus tachycardia. IST is thought to be due to abnormal autonomic control. =Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome= Usually in women with no heart problems, this syndrome is characterized by normal resting heart rate but exaggerated postural sinus tachycardia with or without orthostatic hypotension. Treatment Treatment for physiologic sinus tachycardia involves treating the underlying causes of the tachycardia response. Beta blockers may be used to decrease tachycardia in patients with certain conditions, such as ischemic heart disease and rate-related angina. In patients with inappropriate sinus tachycardia, careful titration of beta blockers, salt loading, and hydration typically reduce symptoms. Patients who are unresponsive to such treatment can undergo catheter ablation to potentially repair the sinus node. = Acute myocardial infarction = Sinus tachycardia can present in more than a third of the patients with AMI but this usually decreases over time. Patients with sustained sinus tachycardia reflects a larger infarct that are more anterior with prominent left ventricular dysfunction, associated with high mortality and morbidity. Tachycardia in the presence of AMI can reduce coronary blood flow and increase myocardial oxygen demand, aggravating the situation. Beta blockers can be used to slow the rate, but most patients are usually already treated with beta blockers as a routine regimen for AMI. = IST and POTS = Beta blockers are useful if the cause is sympathetic overactivity. If the cause is due to decreased vagal activity, it is usually hard to treat and one may consider radiofrequency catheter ablation.

[i]n stamp size.\\" A \\"rare ability at the time,\\" he would later use this skill as a \\"selling point\\" when pursuing a career \\"as an illustrator in advertising and publishing.\\" Career After a period of time as a \\"[l]ettering artist for a cardboard box manufacturer\\", followed by teaching work, he says he \\"[r]an away to London.\\" After some time in menial jobs, Ranson gained experience as a \\"[g]eneral patcher-up and filler-in at [a] commercial art studio,\\" where he was encouraged to become a freelance artist by, he recalls Ranson has a son, Jonas, who is also an artist, and daughter, Cassandra. =Look-in= Ranson first brought the precise techniques he had evolved through his apprenticeship to the UK TV comic Look-in, working first on portrait covers, and later alongside other major comics artists such as John M. Burns, Martin Asbury, Harry North, Colin Wyatt, John Bolton, Jim Baikie, Phil Gascoine, Barry Mitchell, and Bill Titcombe. After some time drawing \\"funnies\\", Ranson drew on his skill in translating pictures across mediums (generally using a Grant Projector, which \\"projects an image up onto a glass plate, on which one places tracing paper\\"), and brought his talents to bear for Look-in by creating strips based on such popular TV series as Sapphire and Steel and Danger Mouse, all written by Angus Allan. Since these works were based on specific TV shows, he says that \\"it seemed important that the characters looked as much like the actors as possible\\", and thus \\"used the methods I knew\\" to achieve the accurate likenesses that typify his work. =Musical strips= Ranson also produced a series of comic-strip biographies of well-known music stars and bands, including ABBA (1977),Published January 14, 1978.

Most biographical articles on Ranson date his Beatles work to \\"the 1960s,\\"Arthur Ranson at Lambiek'x Comiclopedia. Accessed September 3, 2008 but Ranson himself dispels this myth by stating that the \\"first auto-biographical [sic] strip I did was ABBA.\\"ABBA not existing before the 1970s clearly indicates that Ranson was not drawing the Beatles a decade earlier.. In fact that work was done in 1981.Confirmed by the artist himself 28 September 2008. Ranson recalls that Look-in editor Colin Shelbourne was convinced to allow Allan and Ranson to \\"retain... the copyright\\" to their Elvis and Beatles strips, which had the unfortunate side- effect of delaying complete publication, since such deals were largely unheard of. Ranson says: Ranson describes Shelbourne as \\"an adventurous editor,\\" who went the extra mile and even allowed the writer and artist to \\"go to Liverpool for research\\" for the Beatles strip. =TV strips= Sapphire & Steel Ranson's best-known work for Look-in consisted largely of adaptations of two strips based upon totally different British television programmes. The first of these was a strip based on P. J. Hammond's Sapphire & Steel, which Ranson was \\"the first and only one to draw\\" between 1979 and 1981. Scripted by Angus Allan (almost Look-ins sole writer, according to Ranson), Ranson barely recalls drawing the strip, but does remember that Ranson was denied the chance to meet Sapphire & Steel star Joanna Lumley by being absent when she visited the offices. He recalls that, unfortunately, while \\"[s]he was kind enough to offer to meet me and pose for more photo-reference,\\" \\"[s]omeone told her that no, that would not be necessary. Stupid sods.\\" In 2007, Prion Books reprinted a selection of material from Look-in, and included a three-part Sapphire & Steel story on pages 132-133, 136-137 and 140-141.Look-in: The best of Look-in * Junior TVTimes * The Seventies (Prion, 2007) () Dangermouse Ranson's other famous strip for Look-in was Danger Mouse, an unlikely children's cartoon hero based - loosely - on the Patrick McGoohan TV series Danger Man, created in cartoon mouse form by Cosgrove Hall and voiced on TV by David Jason. Ranson says that he \\"did enjoy it at the time,\\" and was awarded not only the \\"Good Grief Oh Crikey\\" Award from Cosgrove Hall (\\"The award is a painted model of Dangermouse in heroic pose with a nervous Penfold peering from behind him\\"), but also received an award from the Society of Strip Illustration for his work on the strip. Ranson wryly notes that \\"[t]he reflected glory from the highly popular TV show made me a big hit with my daughter's primary school friends too.\\" Other Between 1977 and 1990, Ranson also produced strips based on such TV properties as Worzel Gummidge, Michael Bentine's Potty Time, Duckula (another Cosgrove Hall character whose comics adventures began in Look-in, but also spun off into its own title),Cosgrove Hall characters in comics .

Ranson also worked briefly for Marvel UK in the late 1980s, and even illustrated a couple of issues of the comics adventures of Dr. Who for Doctor Who Magazine in 1990. =Advertising= Aside from his Look-in and (later) 2000AD comics work, Ranson also produced illustrations for Fiesta and some \\"[a]dvertising work through an agent, [including] some All-Bran adverts.\\" He produced some assorted work for various other IPC magazines in addition to 2000AD, and was glad of the \\"more challenging\\" work to be found in comics, branding himself \\"too sensitive a plant to get on in advertising despite the high fees.\\" Ranson stresses the influence of his peers - particularly Brian Bolland - on his own evolution as an artist, moving from being burdened by the \\"British way of drawing adventure comics... dependable, professional, craftsmanlike and worthy,\\" to seeing and being influenced by work that \\"looked as though [the artist, particularly Bolland] really cared about it.\\" =2000 AD= Ranson stresses the importance of artist Brian Bolland, saying that In 1989, Ranson followed in Bolland—and others'—footsteps, and moved to major British sci-fi comic 2000 AD, where he has remained ever since, with rare forays into the world of American comics, including Batman and the X-Men. He counts himself lucky that this career path has, in his decades-long comics career seen him work primarily with just three writers. =Judge Anderson: Psi Division= Ranson's first work for 2000 AD was a one-off Judge Dredd story \\"Dungeon Master\\" by John Wagner. It was followed by the ten-part Anderson: Psi Division - \\"Triad\\" storyline, which started in Prog #635 (15 July, 1989).2000AD Art- Droids (Progs #1-1100 + Megazines Vol 1/1 - Vol 3/50) compiled by Julia Hayden: Arthur Ranson .

Having formed an imprint - Apocalypse Ltd - the publish the new anthology title, Pat Mills found himself de facto editor of the in-preparation title, now called Toxic!. Amid some turmoil, the initial five creators began to splinter, with Wagner in particular feeling that his \\"style, the way I write, had itself been deemed un-Toxic!\\" The strip he had spent some time working on was vetoed by Mills, who felt that it was \\"far too close to 2000 AD in style.\\" It eventually fell to the new editor - Dan Abnett, head-hunted from Marvel UK \\\\- to inform Wagner. He recalls that \\"[b]y that stage Arthur Ranson had drawn an awful lot of it.\\" The strip - called Button Man - was shelved half-finished. Toxic! was cancelled in October, 1991 after 31 issues.Bishop (2007), pp. 144 In the spring of 1992, as part of a promotion called \\"the Mega-Blast,\\" Button Man was resurrected and launched in Prog 780.Bishop (2007), pp. 153-154 Ultra-violent and one of the first non-science fictional strips to appear in the comic's 15-year history, Button Man was one of the very few creator-owned strips to appear in 2000 AD. Then-editor Steve MacManus sums it up by saying Ranson says that: The first Button Man serial was collected in 1994 by Kitchen Sink Press, and again by Rebellion in 2003. Ranson remembers that he \\"[made] a small change to the end of Button Man,\\" but praises Wagner's storytelling abilities, for being \\"self-contained. Complete in themselves, neat, compact and satisfying, solid.\\" A second story followed in 1994, and the third made its debut \\"after an absence of six years\\" in 2001.Bishop (2007), pp. 216-217 Writer John Wagner candidly stated that he believes \\"My writing and Arthur's art were patchier on the third series, but I believe the plot was the best of the three.\\" In 2007, Wagner wrote a fourth series, as well pursuing prospects for a big screen adaptation of the series. =Other comics work= In 1993, Grant and Ranson contributed the two-part story \\"Tao\\" to DC Comics' Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight series (issues #52-53). In 1997, Ranson provided the artwork for a one-shot prestige-format single issue for DC Comics, Batman/Phantom Stranger. Written by one of Ranson's frequent collaborators, Alan Grant (a mainstay at 2000 AD, and also a major contributor to the Batman mythos), the story saw the two characters team-up to \\"solve the mystery of a missing civilization.\\" . Accessed September 2, 2008 Grant and Ranson had previously produced \\"an outline of a Phantom Stranger story [Ranson] wanted to draw,\\" but were rebuffed. Indeed, Ranson recalls that Grant was asked to write in Batman/Phantom Stranger a Stranger who \\"must do nothing spooky.\\" He worked on a number of X-Men-related comics for Marvel.

The area was formerly the large tidal estuary of the Afon Glaslyn. It was created after large-scale land reclamation occurred in the late 18th century and the early 19th century. A large embankment, called the Cob, separates the area from the sea and carries a road and railway line. History =Early years= The old tollhouse at Boston Lodge Ffestiniog Railway locomotive David Lloyd George on the Cob, heading towards Blaenau The 19th-century embankment across Traeth Mawr which is known as The Cob The original estuary of the Afon Glaslyn was a dangerous place; many people were said to have died in the quicksands trying to cross the Traeth Mawr. In the late 18th century, various landowners around the edge of the estuary began to systematically reclaim land of between and . Between 1770 and 1800 this resulted in the creation of about of new land. Around 1798, William Madocks bought the Tan-yr-Allt estate near Penmorfa Marsh. Soon afterwards he reclaimed an area of sand from the sea and the river by building a earthen bank from Prenteg to Clog-y-Berth (now Porthmadog). The township of Tremadog was founded within the new area. A wooden-tracked railway was used in the dyke's construction. The rails were later used by the Croesor Tramway. =Completion= In 1807 Madocks obtained a Private Act of Parliament permitting him to complete the reclamation of Traeth Mawr.1 August 1807 - 47 George III Cap. 71 Between 1808 and 1811 an embankment called \\"the Cob\\" was constructed from the island of Ynys Towyn (now part of Porthmadog) to Boston Lodge in the Meirionnydd. The massive stone-lined earthwork was long, wide at the bottom, tapering to at the top, which was above the level of the river. The work completed the reclamation of of Traeth Mawr. Soon after completion in 1812, the embankment was breached in a violent storm. Repairs were completed by the end of September 1814. Although the original estimate to complete The Cob was £23,500 (£16.9million in 2014), it eventually cost Madocks £60,000 (£43.3million in 2014) to finish. At its seaward end, Traeth Mawr joins \\"Traeth Bach\\" (\\"little sands\\"), the estuary of the Afon Dwyryd. =Transport= In 1836, the Ffestiniog Railway began using The Cob when it built a tramroad to transport slate from the quarries around the inland town of Blaenau Ffestiniog to Porthmadog where it was loaded onto ships. Empty wagons were hauled back up to the quarries by horses. Loaded dandy waggons used gravity to run downhill from Blaenau Ffestiniog to the port across The Cob. After a number of trials and some modifications, the line was upgraded to a narrow gauge railway in 1863. In 1927 the Cob was breached again, and took several months to repair. A carriageway was also constructed at a lower level on the inland side to take a public highway. Until September 2003, when The Cob was bought by the Welsh Assembly Government, all vehicles crossing the embankment were required to pay a toll. The collection of fees often caused traffic jams at peak holiday travel times: it was not exceptional for queues to back up to in each direction. In 2002, the highway across the Cob was widened while a separate path was added for walkers and cyclists. The pedestrian route now forms part of Lôn Las Cymru, the national cycle route from Holyhead to Cardiff. In 2010 work started on the Porthmadog, Minffordd and Tremadog bypass to reduce the amount of through traffic in the town.Welsh Assembly Government : A487 Porthmadog, Minffordd and Tremadog Bypass On completion the original course of the A487 across The Cob was renumbered as the A4971. thumb Twilight.

The exact time during which Khaba ruled is unknown but may have been around 2670 BC,Thomas Schneider: Lexikon der Pharaonen. Albatros, Düsseldorf 2002, , p. 97. and almost definitely towards the end of the dynasty. King Khaba is considered to be difficult to assess as a figure of ancient Egypt. His name is archaeologically well- attested by stone bowls and mud seal impressions. Khaba's reign is securely dated to the Third Dynasty. Because of the contradictions within Ramesside king lists and the lack of contemporary, festive inscriptions, his exact chronological position within the dynasty remains disputed. These problems originate in part from contradictory king lists, which were all compiled long after Khaba's death, especially during the Ramesside era (which is separated from the Third Dynasty by 1,400 years). It is also a matter of debate as to where Khaba might have been buried. Many Egyptologists and archaeologists propose that an unfinished Layer Pyramid at Zawyet el'Aryan belongs to him. Others believe instead that his tomb is a large mastaba close to the Layer Pyramid, where numerous stone vessels bearing Khaba's serekh have been found.  Attestations  Khaba's name appears on nine polished stone bowls, variously made of magnesite, travertine, and diorite, which were found at the archaeological locales of Zawyet el'Aryan, Abusir, and Naga-ed-Deir. The bowls were found mostly intact; they show only the king's serekh name on their polished surfaces. As was conventional at the time they were made, they contain no additional inscriptions for context. His name also appears on several mud seal impressions found at Quesna (in the Delta),Luxor Times: British archaeologists discovered an Old Kingdom Mastaba in Delta Zawyet el'Aryan, Hierakonpolis, and Elephantine. Most of the mud seals were excavated at modern-day Elephantine; it is possible that more of them lie under the garden of the current museum of Elephantine. These seal impressions bear more inscriptions than the stone bowls, however most of the seals are only preserved as small fragments and their surfaces have been roughened over the years. Only one seal bears a well-preserved complete row of names or titles; the seal, numbered UC-11755, is undated and is now on display in the Petrie Museum, London. The inscription alternates between Horus and Golden Horus names.Jean-Pierre Pätznik: Die Siegelabrollungen und Rollsiegel der Stadt Elephantine im 3. Jahrtausend v. Chr. p. 73–75.  Identity  =Royal name= Khaba is known by his serekh and Golden Horus name only. His Nisut- Bity title and his Nebty name are unknown. Additionally, Khaba is one of the very few kings from Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom times with an archaeologically proven Gold name, a likely predecessor to the Golden Horus name, which Khaba may also have introduced. Aside from Khaba, the only kings with Gold names who lived before king Sneferu, founder of the 4th dynasty, were Djer, Den, Nynetjer, Khasekhemwy, and Djoser.Toby A. H. Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt, Routledge, London (UK) 2002, , p. 84–86, 171, 172 & 177. From Snefru onward, the Golden Horus name became a fixed royal title to any ruling king, no matter how long the king ruled. Khaba's Golden Horus name can be found on several seal impressions, although its correct reading and translation are disputed. Peter Kaplony interprets it as Nub-iret or Nub iret- djedef, though he is unsure whether the syllable djedef was an inherent part of the name or an additional honorary title.Peter Kaplony: Inschriften der ägyptischen Frühzeit. Band III, Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1963, , p. 173–174. Thomas Schneider and Jürgen von Beckerath, in contrast, see Khaba's Golden Horus as Netjer-nub, which means \\"golden falcon\\". Khaba's Gold name is the first to show the infinitive form of the royal Gold name. =Identification with Ramesside kinglists= Scholars face several problems in attempting to connect Khaba to royal names known from the Ramesside era (the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties). Unfortunately, these lists offer no clear consensus about the number or names of the kings of the 3rd dynasty. The Abydos king list gives Nebka, Djoser, Teti, Sedjes, and Neferkarê, while the Turin Canon offers Nebka, Djoser, Djoserteti, Hudjefa, and Huni. The kinglist of Saqqara lists Djoser, Djoserteti, Nebkarê, and Huni. The ancient historian Manetho gives nine names: Necheróphes, Tosorthrós, Týreis, Mesôchris, Sôÿphis, Tósertasis, Achês, Sêphuris, and Kerpherês.Aidan Dodson: The Layer Pyramid of Zawiyet el-Aryan: Its Layout and Context. In: Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt (JARCE), No. 37 (2000). American Research Center (Hg.), Eisenbrauns, Winona Lake/Bristol 2000, ISSN 0065-9991, pp. 81–90. Egyptologist Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards, for example, identifies Khaba with the Ramesside cartouche name Teti.Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards u.a.: The Cambridge ancient history, vol.1, p. 156. In contrast, Egyptologists Wolfgang Helck and Aidan Dodson suggest that Khaba could have been identical to the Ramesside names Sedjes and Hudjefa II. Both \\"names\\" are actually pseudonyms for a royal title that was illegible when the Ramesside scribes compiled the kinglists. This would match a king who ruled only a short time. The Turin Canon gives a short reign of 6 years for Hudjefa II. A minority of modern Egyptologists think that Khaba might be identical to a Ramesside cartouche name known as Huni. This name can be credited to a king who is handed down by the Ramesside scribes as the last ruler of the 3rd dynasty. Rainer Stadelmann, Nicolas Grimal, Wolfgang Helck, and Toby Wilkinson point to a step pyramid at Zawyet el'Aryan, called the Layer Pyramid. This monument is assigned to Khaba (see section below) and since Stadelmann and Wilkinson hold that the pyramid was finished, they believe that a long-reigning king, such as king Huni, would have been necessary to oversee the project. Huni is attested in the Turin Canon to have reigned for 24 years. In addition, Stadelmann points to the seal impressions found at Elephantine: they come from a site very close to a stepped pyramid which is said to have been built by Huni.Rainer Stadelmann: King Huni: His Monuments and His Place in the History of the Old Kingdom. In: Zahi A. Hawass, Janet Richards (Hrsg.): The Archaeology and Art of Ancient Egypt. Essays in Honor of David B. O'Connor, vol. II. Conceil Suprême des Antiquités de l'Égypte, Kairo 2007, p. 425–431. = Identification with Manetho's king list = It is also unknown under which Hellenized name the ancient historian Manetho listed Khaba. He might have been the same person as the listed Mesôchris or Sôÿphis, but this in turn is doubted by Wolfgang Helck and Eberhard Otto. They connect both names with king Sanakht.Wolfgang Helck, Eberhard Otto: Lexikon der Ägyptologie, Vol. 5. Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, Wiesbaden 1984, , p. 250.  Reign  =Chronology= Because of the contradictions within Ramesside king lists and the lack of contemporary, festive inscriptions, the exact chronological position of Khaba remains disputed. Egyptologist Nabil Swelim believes that Khaba could have been the direct successor to King Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the 2nd dynasty. He bases his assumptions on similarities between the two's names: both begin with the syllable kha. As a comparison, he points to the names Netjerikhet (Djoser) and Sekhemkhet (Djoserteti), which also display such similarity and are widely assumed to have ruled back-to-back.Nabil Swelim: Some Problems on the History of the Third Dynasty - Archaeological and Historical Studies, vol. 7. The Archaeological Society of Alexandria, Alexandria 1983, p. 199–202. However, Swelim's theory is not widely accepted. Grimal, Helck, Wilkinson and Stadelmann point out that during the 3rd dynasty it became a fashion that royal stone bowls with polished surfaces showed only Horus names, without any guiding inscriptions. This is also the case for the stone bowls of king Khaba. This decor style was practiced still under Sneferu, the founder of the 4th dynasty. Thus, Khaba is thought to have reigned close to the end of the Third Dynasty.Nicolas-Christophe Grimal: A history of ancient Egypt. Wiley & Blackwell, London (UK) 1994, , p. 66. =Duration= The correct duration of Khaba's reign is also unknown. Should he be identical to the Ramesside cartouche names Sedjes (meaning \\"omitted\\") and Hudjefa (meaning \\"erased\\"), he might have ruled for six years, as the Turin Canon suggests. If Khaba was identical to king Huni, he might have ruled for 24 years.Wolfgang Helck: Untersuchungen zur Thinitenzeit (= Ägyptologische Abhandlungen (ÄA), vol. 45). Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1987, , p.109.Gerald P. Verbrugghe, John Moore Wickersham: Berossos and Manetho, Introduced and Translated: Native Traditions in Ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt. University of Michigan Press, 2001, , p. 189. =Events= The current archaeological situation allows no closer evaluation of Khaba's reign. The seal impressions from Elephantine only prove that this island seems to have been an important place to visit in Khaba's time. The inscriptions reveal that the seals and their belonging vessels originated from Thinis and that they were registered by the governor of Elephantine. Other seals show the depiction of the goddess Bastet. The Hierakonpolis seal was found in early dynastic ruins of a local Horus temple. It shows traces of the image of a god, possibly Ash.  Tomb  Layer Pyramid at Zawyet el'Aryan. Khaba is commonly thought to have built the Layer Pyramid, located at Zawyet el'Aryan, about 8 km south-west of Giza. The pyramid's construction is typical of Third Dynasty masonry with mudbricks arranged in layers around a core made of rough blocks from the local bedrock. The pyramid was planned to be about tall, but is now only . It is unclear whether part of the pyramid has been eroded over time or its construction was never finished. While there are no inscriptions directly relating the pyramid to Khaba, his serekh appears on stone bowls that were discovered in a nearby mastaba, known as Mastaba Z500.Miroslav Verner: Die Pyramiden. Rowohlt, Wiesbaden 1999, , p. 174–177. Alternatively, Khaba could have been interred in the aforementioned mastaba, which is located about north of the pyramid. Indeed, excavations of the mastaba yielded several stone bowls inscribed with Khaba's Horus name as well as two seal fragments of him. Although this is generally taken as a proof that Khaba was the pyramid owner, it could equally imply that the mastaba was Khaba's tomb and the pyramid that of another, yet unknown king.  Other buildings from Khaba's reign  = Mastaba Z500 = Only two large mastaba tombs can be securely dated into Khaba's reign. The first one is known as Mastaba Z500, which is located at Zawyet el'Aryan. It lies around 200m north of the Layer Pyramid and has a south–north-orientation.Mark Lehner: Z500 and The Layer Pyramid of Zawiyet el-Aryan. In: Studies in honor of William Kelly Simpson vol. II. (PDF), Boston 1997, p. 507-522. The mastaba ist made of mudbricks, its outer wall is niched and it contains only two large chambers without any typical tomb architecture elements. Because of this, Egyptologists such as Nabil Swelim believe that Mastaba Z500 was in fact a mortuary temple, belonging to the funerary complex of the Layer Pyramid. The datation of the building into Khaba's reign is based on numerous diorite and dolomite vessels and mud seal fragments, bearing the serekh name of king Khaba.Nabil Swelim: Some Problems on the History of the Third Dynasty - Archaeological and Historical Studies, volume 7. The Archaeological Society of Alexandria, Alexandria 1983, S. 27-32, 180 & 219. = Quesna Tomb = In 2010, an unknown mudbrick mastaba was discovered in Quesna, an archaeological site located in the Monufia Governorate (in the Nile Delta). The mastaba was once 14m in length and 6m in width. Its substructure contains a 3m wide corridor chapel, divided into three architectural sections: the first (northern) section is filled with rubble, the second (central) section contains a double room as the burial chamber and the third (southern) section has a burial shaft in its center. In 2014, a tiny mud seal fragment with the king's name was discovered inside. The true owner of the tomb, however, is unknown and archaeological excavations are still on-going.Mada Masr: Tomb of little-known pharaoh unearthed in Nile Delta, press release in April 23, 2015 (English) .

P. M. Holt, Peter Malcolm Holt, Ann K. S. Lambton, Bernard Lewis, (Cambridge University Press, 1970), 421. History When the Caliphate of Cordoba broke up into the Taifa kingdoms, the Berber mercenary Abdallah ibn Muhammad ibn Maslamah ibn al-Aftas (1022–1045) took control of Badajoz, by death of Sabur al-Khatib (a Slavic serf, previously serving at the court of Caliph al-Hakam II, that had proclaimed himself Lord of Badajoz in 1009, and that Ibn al-Aftas served). Ibn al-Aftas added to his name the Laqab al-Mansur Billah, Victorious by Grace of God, and ruled over an extensive part of the Al Garb Al Andalus, from the Douro river to the south of Tagus river, establishing the Taifa of Badajoz. Ibn al-Aftas died in 1045. Under Ibn al-Aftas' successors, Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Abdallah al-Muzzaffar (1045–1065) and his two sons 'Umar ibn Muhammad al- Mutawakkil (1065-1094 in Évora) and Yahya ibn Muhammad al-Mansur (1065-1072 in Badajoz), the Taifa of Badajoz not only controlled large expanses of western Spain and Portugal, but was also a major centre of Islamic culture, which was fostered by the Aftasid rulers. In 1055, Badajoz came under the suzerainty of the Kingdom of León-Castile and was forced to pay tribute. The taifa lost control over significant parts of its territory, south of the Mondego river (south of Coimbra). The Abbadid dynasty of Seville conquered parts of their territory. In 1094, the kingdom was annexed by the Almoravid dynasty. Badajoz was taken at the end of 1095 by the Almoravid general Abu Bakr, with the connivance of the inhabitants who were fed up of the fiscal exactions of their emir, Umar ibn Muhammad al-Mutawakkil. Al-Mutawakkil and two of his sons Al- Fadl and S'ad, were taken prisoner and sent to Seville, but were executed before their arrival, which was eulogized in a poem by Ibn 'Abdun.James T. Monroe, Hispano-Arabic Poetry: A Student Anthology, (Gorgias Press, 2004), 37. Another son of Al-Mutawakkil, Al-Mansur, escaped and fortified himself for some time in the castle of Montanchez, in the modern province of Caceres, and finally together with his followers, migrated into the dominions of Alfonso VI, where he abandoned Islam for Christianity.

Quantum mechanics In quantum mechanics, a shape resonance, in contrast to a Feshbach resonance, is a resonance which is not turned into a bound state if the coupling between some degrees of freedom and the degrees of freedom associated to the fragmentation (reaction coordinates) are set to zero. More simply, the shape resonance total energy is more than the separated fragment energy. \\"Roles Played by Metastable States in Chemistry\\" Jack Simons in Resonances in Electron-Molecule Scattering Van Der Waals Complexes, and Reactive Chemical Dynamics Donald G. Truhlar, Ed, American Chemical Society Symposium Series, ACS No. 263 (1984) Practical implications of this difference for lifetimes and spectral widths are mentioned in works such as Zobel. Related terms include a special kind of shape resonance, the core-excited shape resonance, and trap-induced shape resonance. Of course in one-dimensional systems, resonances are shape resonances. In a system with more than one degree of freedom, this definition makes sense only if the separable model, which supposes the two groups of degrees of freedom uncoupled, is a meaningful approximation. When the coupling becomes large, the situation is much less clear. In the case of atomic and molecular electronic structure problems, it is well known that the self- consistent field (SCF) approximation is relevant at least as a starting point of more elaborate methods. The Slater determinants built from SCF orbitals (atomic or molecular orbitals) are shape resonances if only one electronic transition is required to emit one electron. Today, there is some debate about the definition and even existence of the shape resonance in some systems observed with molecular spectroscopy.LBL Mol Spec Discussion It has been experimentally observed in the anionic yields from photofragmentation of small molecules to provide details of internal structure. In nuclear physics the concept of \\"Shape Resonance\\" is described by Amos de Shalit and Herman Feshbach in their book.Nuclear Physics: Nuclear structure Amos de Shalit and Herman Feshbach John Wiley & Sons Inc, New York, page 87 (1974) \\"It is well known that the scattering from a potential shows characteristics peaks, as a function of energy, for such values of E that make the integral number of wave lengths sit within the potential. The resulting shape resonances are rather broad, their width being of the order of ....\\" The shape resonances were observed around the years 1949–54 in nuclear scattering experiments. They indicate broad asymmetric peaks in the scattering cross section of neutrons or protons scattered by nuclei. The name \\"shape resonance\\" has been introduced to describe the fact that the resonance in the potential scattering for the particle of energy E is controlled by the shape of the nucleus. In fact the shape resonance occurs where the integral number of wavelengths of the particle sit within the potential of the nucleus of radius R. Therefore, the measure of the energies of the shape resonances in the neutron-nucleus scattering have been used in the years from 1947 to 1954 to measure the radii R of the nuclei with the precision of ±1×10−13 cm as it can be seen in the chapter \\"Elastic Cross Sections\\" of A Textbook in Nuclear Physics by R. D. Evans.Robley D. Evans The Atomic Nucleus McGraw-Hill Books, p. 448-450 and p. 455-456 (1955) The \\"shape resonances\\" are discussed in general introductory academic courses of quantum mechanics in the frame of potential scattering phenomena.J. J. Sakurai, Modern Quantum Mechanics Addison-Wesley Longman (2005) pag. 418-421 The shape resonances arise from the quantum interference between closed and an open scattering channels. At the resonance energy a quasi bound state is degenerate with a continuum. This quantum interference in many body system has been described using quantum mechanics by Gregor Wentzel, for the interpretation of the Auger effect, by Ettore Majorana for the dissociation processes and quasi bound states, by Ugo Fano for the atomic auto-ionization states in the continuum of helium atomic spectrum and by Victor Frederick Weisskopf. J. M. Blatt and Herman Feshbach for nuclear scattering experiments.J. M. Blatt and V. F. Weisskopf Theoretical Nuclear Physics John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York (1952) The shape resonances are related with the existence of nearly stable bound states (that is, resonances) of two objects that dramatically influences how those two objects interact when their total energy is near that of the bound state. When the total energy of the objects is close to the energy of the resonance they interact strongly, and their scattering cross-section becomes very large. A particular type of \\"shape resonance\\" occurs in multiband or two-band superconducting heterostructures at atomic limit called superstripes due to quantum interference of a first pairing channel in a first wide band and a second pairing channel in a second band where the chemical potential is tuned near a Lifshitz transition at the band edge or at the topological electronic transitions of the Fermi surface type \\"neck-collapsing\\" or \\"neck-disrupting\\" See also * Dzhanibekov effect * Fano resonance * Intermediate axis theorem * Tennis racket theorem References Category:Scattering Category:Spectroscopy ","title":"Shape resonance"},{"id":"2166584","text":"Anthony Cattel Trischka (born January 16, 1949) is an American five-string banjo player. Music career A native of Syracuse, New York, Trischka's interest in banjo was sparked by the Kingston Trio's version of \\"Charlie and the MTA\\" in 1963. Two years later, he joined the Down City Ramblers, where he remained through 1971. That year, he made his recording debut on 15 Bluegrass Instrumentals with the band Country Cooking; at the same time, he was also a member of America's premier sports-rock band Country Granola. In 1973, he began a three-year stint with Breakfast Special. Between 1974 and 1975, he recorded two solo albums, Bluegrass Light and Heartlands. After one more solo album in 1976, Banjoland, he went on to become musical leader for the Broadway show The Robber Bridegroom. Trischka toured with the show in 1978, the year he also played with the Monroe Doctrine. In 1978, Trischka toured Japan and recorded with Peter Rowan and Richard Greene. In the early 1980s, he began recording with his group Skyline, which released its first album in 1983. Later albums included Robot Plane Flies over Arkansas (solo, 1983), Stranded in the Moonlight (with Skyline, 1984) and Hill Country (solo, 1985). In 1984, he performed in his first feature film, Foxfire. Three years later, he worked on the pre-recorded music for the off-Broadway production of Driving Miss Daisy that featured Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman. Trischka produced the Belgian group Gold Rush's No More Angels in 1988. The following year, Skyline recorded its final album, Fire of Grace. He also recorded the theme song for Books on the Air, a popular National Public Radio show, and continued his affiliation with the network by appearing on Garrison Keillor's Prairie Home Companion, Mountain Stage, From Our Front Porch, and other radio shows. Trischka continued his recording career with 1993's World Turning, 1995's Glory Shone Around: A Christmas Collection and 1999's Bend. New Deal followed in 2003. Double Banjo Bluegrass Spectacular, featuring appearances by Steve Martin, Earl Scruggs, Béla Fleck, Tony Rice and many other luminaries, came out four years later. For this recording Trischka went back to bluegrass and reinvigorated the double banjo tradition. In October 2007, he was given an IBMA (International Bluegrass Music Association) award for Banjo Player of the Year 2007. Double Banjo Bluegrass Spectacular received IBMA awards for Recorded Event of the Year, Instrumental Album of the Year and a Grammy Nomination. He has written over fifteen instructional books and a series of DVDs. In July 2009 he launched the groundbreaking Online Banjo School with Tony Trischka, an interactive, online learning school that teaches students around the world how to play banjo with ArtistWorks. Trischka is closely associated with \\"newgrass,\\" which features several innovations to traditional bluegrass, including jazzy arrangements, non-traditional chordal structures, and frequent covers of non-bluegrass songs. Trischka is one of the major innovators of the \\"chromatic\\" banjo style, which features sinewy, snaky melodic runs not strictly played out of chord positions. 2011 saw Give Me the Banjo aired on PBS stations nationwide with Trischka as the musical director and co-producer of the documentary. It was released on DVD. He produced Steve Martin's Grammy-nominated Rare Bird Alert (Rounder), which features performances by Paul McCartney, the Dixie Chicks and the Steep Canyon Rangers.

Development The missile was developed by the Nudelman OKB-16 design bureau. It was developed at about the same time as the AT-1 Snapper as a heavy ATGM for use on both ground launchers and helicopters. It addressed some of the problems of the AT-1; it was much faster, and had slightly longer range. These improvements were achieved by sending commands via a radio link instead of a trailing guidance wire, which allowed the missile to travel faster. However, it did make it vulnerable to jamming. The missile system was shown to Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev in September 1964, and accepted for service shortly afterwards. History AT-2B Swatter missile The AT-2 was the first Soviet ATGM to be deployed from helicopters. Small numbers were fitted to the Mi-4AV. The missile was deployed on the Mi-8 Hip as well as the Mi-24 and Mi-25 'Hind' series of helicopters. It was also deployed on the BRDM-1 and BRDM-2 infantry fighting vehicles. The original AT-2A (3M11 Falanga) missile was problematic; one Russian source describes the missile as \\"notable for its complexity and low reliability\\". Also, the missile's range was felt to be inadequate. An improved version of the missile was developed: the AT-2B (9M17 Skorpion). Externally, the missiles are very similar, however the AT-2B range is increased to 3.5 km. The standard production version was the 9M17M Skorpion-M, which entered service in 1968. The next development was to integrate SACLOS guidance, resulting in the AT-2 Swatter-C or 9M17P Skorpion-P. It entered service in 1969. A product improved version the 9M17MP was developed that had an improved engine and signal lamp. The missile has been used extensively in the following wars on the Mi-24 platform. * Angolan War of Independence * Soviet invasion of Afghanistan * 1980s Iran–Iraq War * 1982 Lebanon War It was replaced in Soviet service by the 9K114 Shturm ATGM.

The rivers Garonne and Dordogne, and the Gironde estuary are important in defining the various parts of the region A Bordeaux wine (, ) is any wine produced in the Bordeaux region of southwest France. Bordeaux is centered on the city of Bordeaux, on the Garonne River. To the north of the city the Dordogne River joins the Garonne forming the broad estuary called the Gironde and covering the whole area of the Gironde department, with a total vineyard area of over 120,000 hectares, making it the largest wine growing area in France. Average vintages produce over 700 million bottles of Bordeaux wine, ranging from large quantities of everyday table wine, to some of the most expensive and prestigious wines in the world. The vast majority of wine produced in Bordeaux is red (sometimes called \\"claret\\" in Britain), with sweet white wines (most notably Sauternes), dry whites, and (in much smaller quantities) rosé and sparkling wines (Crémant de Bordeaux) collectively making up the remainder. Bordeaux wine is made by more than 8,500 producers or châteaux. There are 54 appellations of Bordeaux wine.Bordeaux.com (CIVB): Essential Guide to Bordeaux Wines , read on May 28, 2010  History  Map of the French provinces (including Bordeaux) assimilated by the Plantagenet-Aquitaine union The wine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-1st century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since then. In the 12th century, the popularity of Bordeaux wines in England increased dramatically following the marriage of Henry Plantagenet and Eleanor of Aquitaine. The marriage made the province of Aquitaine part of the Angevin Empire, and thenceforth the wine of Bordeaux was exported to England. At this time, Graves was the principal wine region of Bordeaux, and the principal style was clairet. This accounts for the ubiquity of claret in England, though this is now used to refer to all red wine rather than the clairet style specifically. The export of Bordeaux was interrupted by the outbreak of the Hundred Years' War between France and England in 1337. By the end of the conflict in 1453 France had repossessed the province, thus taking control of wine production in the region. As part of the Auld Alliance, the French granted Scottish merchants a privileged position in the trade of claret—a position that continued largely unchanged after the Treaty of Edinburgh ended the military alliance between France and Scotland. Even when the by then Protestant kingdoms of England and Scotland, both ruled by the same Stuart king by this point, were trying to militarily aid the Huguenot rebels in their fight against Catholic France in La Rochelle, Scots trading vessels were not only permitted to enter the Gironde, but the French navy escorted them safely to the port of Bordeaux to protect them from Huguenot privateers. In the seventeenth century, Dutch traders drained the swampy ground of the Médoc so it could be planted with vines, and this gradually surpassed Graves as the most prestigious region of Bordeaux. Malbec was the dominant grape here, until the early 19th century, when it was replaced by Cabernet Sauvignon. In 1855, the châteaux of Bordeaux were classified; this classification remains widely used today. From 1875 to 1892 almost all Bordeaux vineyards were ruined by phylloxera infestations. The region's wine industry was rescued by grafting native vines on to pest-resistant American rootstock.  Climate and geography  Vineyards of Blaye on the \\"right bank\\" of Bordeaux Pauillac on the \\"left bank\\" of Bordeaux The major reason for the success of winemaking in the Bordeaux region is an excellent environment for growing vines. The geological foundation of the region is limestone, leading to a soil structure that is heavy in calcium. The Gironde estuary dominates the regions along with its tributaries, the Garonne and the Dordogne rivers, and together irrigate the land and provide an Atlantic Climate, also known as an oceanic climate, for the region.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible p. 118 Workman Publishing 2001 Bordeaux lies at the center of the confluence of the Dordogne and Garonne Rivers, which flow into the Gironde. These rivers define the main geographical subdivisions of the region: * \\"The right bank\\", situated on the right bank of Dordogne, in the northern parts of the region, around the city of Libourne. * Entre-Deux-Mers, French for \\"between two seas\\", the area between the rivers Dordogne and Garonne, both of which are tidal, in the centre of the region. * \\"The left bank\\", situated on the left bank of Garonne, in the west and south of the region, around the city of Bordeaux itself. The left bank is further subdivided into: **Graves, the area upstream of the city Bordeaux. ** Médoc, the area downstream of the city Bordeaux, situated on a peninsula between Gironde and the Atlantic at the Left Bank of the Gironde. In Bordeaux the concept of terroir plays a pivotal role in wine production with the top estates aiming to make terroir driven wines that reflect the place they are from, often from grapes collected from a single vineyard.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible p. 120 Workman Publishing 2001 The soil of Bordeaux is composed of gravel, sandy stone, and clay. The region's best vineyards are located on the well-drained gravel soils that are frequently found near the Gironde river. An old adage in Bordeaux is the best estates can \\"see the river\\" from their vineyards. The majority of land facing riverward is occupied by classified estates.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible p. 122 Workman Publishing 2001  Grapes  Cabernet Sauvignon grapes in Médoc Sémillon grapes in Barsac = Reds = Red Bordeaux is generally made from a blend of grapes. Permitted grapes are Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and rarely Carménère.Stephen Brook, The Complete Bordeaux: The Wines, the Châteaux, the People p. 41. Octopus Publishing Group Ltd. 2007 Today Carménère is rarely used, with Château Clerc Milon, a fifth growth Bordeaux, being one of the few to still retain Carménère vines. As of July 2019, Bordeaux wineries authorized the use of four new red grapes to combat temperature increases in Bordeaux. These newly approved grapes are Marselan, Touriga Nacional, Castets, and Arinarnoa. As a very broad generalisation, Cabernet Sauvignon (Bordeaux's second-most planted grape variety) dominates the blend in red wines produced in the Médoc and the rest of the left bank of the Gironde estuary. Typical top-quality Châteaux blends are 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cabernet Franc and 15% Merlot. This is typically referred to as the \\"Bordeaux Blend\\". Merlot tends to predominate in Saint-Émilion, Pomerol and the other right bank appellations. These Right Bank blends from top-quality Châteaux are typically 70% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes p. 129 Harcourt Books 2001 = Whites = White Bordeaux is predominantly, and exclusively in the case of the sweet Sauternes, made from Sémillon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle. Typical blends are 80% Sémillon and 20% Sauvignon blanc. As with the reds, white Bordeaux wines are usually blends, most commonly of Sémillon and a smaller proportion of Sauvignon blanc. Other permitted grape varieties are Sauvignon gris, Ugni blanc, Colombard, Merlot blanc, Ondenc and Mauzac. Recently permitted by Bordeaux wineries, three new white grapes have been added. These grapes are Alvarinho, Petit Manseng, and Liliorila. In the late 1960s Sémillon was the most planted grape in Bordeaux. Since then it has been in constant decline although it still is the most common of Bordeaux's white grapes. Sauvignon blanc's popularity on the other hand has been rising, overtaking Ugni blanc as the second most planted white Bordeaux grape in the late 1980s and now being grown in an area more than half the size of that of the lower yielding Sémillon. Wineries all over the world aspire to making wines in a Bordeaux style. In 1988, a group of American vintners formed The Meritage Association to identify wines made in this way. Although most Meritage wines come from California, there are members of the Meritage Association in 18 states and five other countries, including Argentina, Australia, Canada, Israel, and Mexico.  Viticulture and winemaking  Merlot grapes being sorted at Château Kirwan = Viticulture = The red grapes in the Bordeaux vineyard are Merlot (62% by area), Cabernet Sauvignon (25%), Cabernet Franc (12%) and a small amount of Petit Verdot, Malbec and Carménère (1% in total). The white grapes are Sémillon (54% by area), Sauvignon blanc (36%), Muscadelle (7%) and a small amount of Ugni blanc, Colombard and Folle blanche (3% in total). Because of the generally humid Bordeaux climate, a variety of pests can cause a problem for the vigneron. In the past, this was counteracted by the widespread use of pesticides, although the use of natural methods has recently been gaining in popularity. The vines are generally trained in either single or double guyot. Hand-picking is preferred by most of the prestigious châteaux, but machine- harvesting is popular in other places. = Winemaking = Following harvest, the grapes are usually sorted and destemmed before crushing. Crushing was traditionally done by foot, but mechanical crushing is now almost universally used. Chaptalization is permitted, and is fairly common-place. Fermentation then takes place, usually in temperature controlled stainless steel vats. Next the must is pressed and transferred to barriques (in most cases) for a period of ageing (commonly a year). The traditional Bordeaux barrique is a 225-litre oak barrel. At some point between pressing and bottling the wine is blended. This is an integral part of the Bordeaux wine making process, as scarcely any Bordeaux wines are varietals; wine from different grape varieties is mixed together, depending on the vintage conditions, so as to produce a wine in the château's preferred style. In addition to mixing wine from different grape varieties, wine from different parts of the vineyard is often aged separately, and then blended into either the main or the second wine (or sold off wholesale) according to the judgment of the winemaker. The wine is then bottled and usually undergoes a further period of ageing before it is released for sale.  Wine styles  Château Pichon-Longueville-Baron in Pauillac Château d'Yquem in Sauternes Château Cheval Blanc in Saint-Émilion Château Pétrus in Pomerol The Bordeaux wine region is divided into subregions including Saint-Émilion, Pomerol, Médoc, and Graves. The 60 Bordeaux appellations and the wine styles they represent are usually categorized into six main families, four red based on the subregions and two white based on sweetness:Bordeaux.com (CIVB): The 60 Appellations , read on May 28, 2010 * Red Bordeaux and Red Bordeaux Supérieur. Bordeaux winemakers may use the two regional appellations throughout the entire wine region; however, approximately half of the Bordeaux vineyard is specifically designated under Bordeaux and Bordeaux Supérieur AOCs. With the majority of châteaux located on the Right Bank in the Entre-Deux-Mers area, wines are typically Merlot- dominant, often blended with the other classic Bordeaux varieties. There are many small, family-run châteaux, as well as wines blended and sold by wine merchants under commercial brand names. The Bordeaux AOC wines tend to be fruity, with minimal influence of oak, and are produced in a style meant to be drunk young. Bordeaux Superieur AOC wines are produced in the same area, but must follow stricter controls, such as lower yields, and are often aged in oak. For the past 10 years, there has been strong, ongoing investment by the winemakers in both the vineyards and in the cellar, resulting in ever increasing quality. New reforms for the regional appellations were instituted in 2008 by the Bordeaux and Bordeaux Supérieur Winemakers' Association. In 2010, 55% of all Bordeaux wines sold in the world were from Bordeaux and Bordeaux Supérieur AOCs, with 67% sold in France and 33% exported (+9%), representing 14 bottles consumed per second.Bordeaux & Bordeaux Supérieur Press Kit, 2011, CIVB Economie et Etudes Nov 16, 2010. * Red Côtes de Bordeaux. Eight appellations are in the hilly outskirts of the region, and produce wines where the blend usually is dominated by Merlot. These wines tend to be intermediate between basic red Bordeaux and the more famous appellations of the left and right bank in both style and quality. However, since none of Bordeaux's stellar names are situated in Côtes de Bordeaux, prices tend to be moderate. There is no official classification in Côtes de Bordeaux.Bordeaux.com (CIVB): The 60 Appellations – Côtes de Bordeaux , read on May 28, 2010 In 2007, 14.7% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family. * Red Libourne, or \\"Right Bank\\" wines. Around the city of Libourne, 10 appellations produce wines dominated by Merlot with very little Cabernet Sauvignon, the two most famous being Saint-Émilion and Pomerol. These wines often have great fruit concentration, softer tannins and are long-lived. Saint-Émilion has an official classification.Bordeaux.com (CIVB): The 60 Appellations – Saint-Emilion, Pomerol, Fronsac , read on May 28, 2010 In 2007, 10.5% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family. * Red Graves and Médoc or \\"Left Bank\\" wines. North and south of the city of Bordeaux, which are the classic areas, produce wines dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, but often with a significant portion of Merlot. These wines are concentrated, tannic, long-lived and most of them meant to be cellared before drinking. The five First Growths are situated here. There are official classifications for both Médoc and Graves.Bordeaux.com (CIVB): The 60 Appellations – Médoc and Graves , read on May 28, 2010 In 2007, 17.1% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family. * Dry white wines. Dry white wines are made throughout the region, using the regional appellation Bordeaux Blanc, often from 100% Sauvignon blanc or a blend dominated by Sauvignon blanc and Sémillon. The Bordeaux Blanc AOC is used for wines made in appellations that only allow red wines. Dry whites from Graves are the most well-known and it is the only subregion with a classification for dry white wines. The better versions tend to have a significant oak influence.Bordeaux.com (CIVB): The 60 Appellations – Dry white wines , read on May 28, 2010 In 2007, 7.8% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family. * Sweet white wines. In several locations and appellations throughout the region, sweet white wine is made from Sémillon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle grapes affected by noble rot. The best-known of these appellations is Sauternes, which also has an official classification, and where some of the world's most famous sweet wines are produced. There are also appellations neighbouring Sauternes, on both sides of the Garonne river, where similar wines are made. These include Loupiac, Cadillac, and Sainte Croix du Mont. The regional appellation for sweet white wines is Bordeaux Supérieur Blanc.Bordeaux.com (CIVB): The 60 Appellations – Dry white wines , read on May 28, 2010 In 2007, 3.2% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family. The vast majority of Bordeaux wine is red, with red wine production outnumbering white wine production six to one.Hugh Johnson, \\"The World Atlas of Wine\\"  Wine classification  There are four different classifications of Bordeaux, covering different parts of the region:J. Robinson (ed), \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\", Third Edition, pp. 175–177, Oxford University Press 2006, J. Robinson (ed), \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\", Third Edition, pp. 212–216, Oxford University Press 2006, * The Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, covering (with one exception) red wines of Médoc, and sweet wines of Sauternes-Barsac. * The 1955 Official Classification of St.-Émilion, which is updated approximately once every ten years, and last in 2006. * The 1959 Official Classification of Graves, initially classified in 1953 and revised in 1959. * The Cru Bourgeois Classification, which began as an unofficial classification, but came to enjoy official status and was last updated in 2003. However, after various legal turns, the classification was annulled in 2007. As of 2007, plans exist to revive it as an unofficial classification. 78 producers took legal action against the 2003 classification. In September 2010 a new list of Crus Bourgeois was unveiled as a recognition of quality, with a yearly reappraisal. It is no longer a recognized classification. * The Cru artisan Classification was recognized by the European Union in June 1994 and published on January 11, 2006. The classification is to be revised every 10 years. The initial list of 44 Cru Artisans was extended to 50 in 2012; see . The 1855 classification system was made at the request of Emperor Napoleon III for the Exposition Universelle de Paris. This came to be known as the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, which ranked the wines into five categories according to price. The first growth red wines (four from Médoc and one, Château Haut- Brion, from Graves), are among the most expensive wines in the world. Château Margaux The first growths are: * Château Lafite Rothschild, in the appellation Pauillac * Château Margaux, in the appellation Margaux * Château Latour, in the appellation Pauillac * Château Haut-Brion, in the appellation Péssac- Leognan * Château Mouton Rothschild, in the appellation Pauillac, promoted from second to first growth in 1973. At the same time, the sweet white wines of Sauternes and Barsac were classified into three categories, with only Château d'Yquem being classified as a superior first growth. In 1955, St. Émilion AOC were classified into three categories, the highest being Premier Grand Cru Classé A with two members: * Château Ausone * Château Cheval Blanc In the 2012 classification, two more Châteaux became members: * Château Angélus * Château Pavie There is no official classification applied to Pomerol. However some Pomerol wines, notably Château Pétrus and Château Le Pin, are often considered as being equivalent to the first growths of the 1855 classification, and often sell for even higher prices.  Wine label  Château l'Angélus 1978 Bordeaux wine labels generally include:B. Sanderson \\"A Master Class in Cabernet\\" pg 62 Wine Spectator May 15, 2007 # The name of the estate (Image example: Château L'Angelus) # The estate's classification (Image example: Grand Cru Classé) This can be in reference to the 1855 Bordeaux classification or one of the Cru Bourgeois. # The appellation (Image example: Saint-Émilion) Appellation d'origine contrôlée laws dictate that all grapes must be harvested from a particular appellation for that appellation to appear on the label.

Claret derives from the French clairet, a now uncommon dark rosé, which was the most common wine exported from Bordeaux until the 18th century. The name was anglicised to \\"claret\\" as a result of its widespread consumption in England during the period in the 12th–15th centuries that Aquitaine was part of the Angevin Empire and continued to be controlled by Kings of England for some time after the Angevins. It is a protected name within the European Union, describing a red Bordeaux wine, accepted after the British wine trade demonstrated over 300 years' usage of the term.winepros.com.au. Claret is occasionally used in the United States as a semi-generic label for red wine in the style of the Bordeaux, ideally from the same grapes as are permitted in Bordeaux. The French themselves do not use the term, except for export purposes. The meaning of \\"claret\\" has changed over time to refer to a dry, dark red Bordeaux. It has remained a term associated with the English upper class, and consequently appears on bottles of generic red Bordeaux in an effort to raise their status in the market. In November 2011, the president of the Union des Maisons de Négoce de Bordeaux, announced an intention to use the term claret de Bordeaux for wines that are \\"light and fruity, easy to drink, in the same style as the original claret when it was prized by the English in former centuries\\". In Britain and Australia, \\"claret\\" has also been a slang term for blood.  Commercial aspects  Bordeaux red wine Bordeaux dry white Many of the top Bordeaux wines are primarily sold as futures contracts, called selling en primeur. Because of the combination of longevity, fairly large production, and an established reputation, Bordeaux wines tend to be the most common wines at wine auctions. Market reports released in February 2009 showed that the market had increased in buying power by 128% while the prices had been lowered for the very best Bordeaux wines.Aarash Ghatineh, WineInvestment.org = Syndicat des AOC de Bordeaux et Bordeaux Supérieur = Syndicate des Vins de Bordeaux et Bordeaux Supérieur is an organization representing the economic interests of 6,700 wine producers in Bordeaux, France. The wine lake and other economic problems have increased the salience of the winemakers' association, whose members are facing increasing costs and decreasing demand for their product. As the largest appellation producing fine wines, and the strong foundation of the pyramid of Bordeaux wines, Bordeaux AOC & Bordeaux Supérieur AOC today account for 55% of all Bordeaux wines consumed in the world. = Plan Bordeaux = Plan Bordeaux was an initiative introduced in 2005 by ONIVINS, the French vintners association, designed to reduce France's wine production in order to improve profitability for the remaining producers. Part of the plan was to uproot 17,000 hectares of the 124,000 hectares of vineyards in Bordeaux. The wine industry in Bordeaux has been experiencing economic problems in the face of strong international competition from New World wines and declining wine consumption in France. In 2004, exports to the U.S. plummeted 59% in value over the previous year. Sales in Britain dropped 33% in value during the same period. The UK, a major market, now imports more wine from Australia than from France. Amongst the possible causes for this economic crisis are that many consumers tend to prefer wine labels that state the variety of grape used, and often find the required French AOC labels difficult to understand. Christian Delpeuch, president emeritus of Plan Bordeaux hoped to reduce production, improve quality, and sell more wine in the United States. However, two years after the beginning of the program, Mr Delpeuch resigned, \\"citing the failure of the French government to address properly the wine crisis in Bordeaux.\\" Delpeuch told journalists assembled at the Bordeaux Press Club \\"I refuse to countenance this continual putting off of decisions which can only end in failure.\\" \\"Delpeuch said he was shocked and disappointed by the failure of his efforts—and by the lack of co-operation from winemakers and négociants themselves—to achieve anything concrete in terms of reforms to the Bordeaux wine industry over the last 24 months.\\" The future of Plan Bordeaux is uncertain.

He is best known for serving as the 17th President of the University of Iowa from 1987 until 1995 and as the 10th President of Cornell University from 1995 until 2003. He also served as Cornell's interim president in 2005–2006 and again from 2016–2017. Currently, Rawlings is Professor and University President Emeritus at the Department of Classics. Rawlings served as President of the Association of American Universities from June 1, 2011, until April 2016. He has served as chair of both the Association of American Universities and the Ivy Council of Presidents. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and he serves on the boards of the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, Haverford College, and the National Academy Foundation. Early life, family and career Originally from Norfolk, Virginia,http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/presidents/view_item.php?sec=3⊂=17 Rawlings received his B.A. with honors in classics from Haverford College in 1966. From there he moved to Princeton University, where he received a Ph.D. in classics in 1970. After graduating from Princeton, he joined the faculty at the University of Colorado at Boulder, rising to full professor in 1980. Rawlings began his career in academic administration at Colorado, serving as chairman of the classics department and later as associate vice chancellor for instruction. In 1988, Rawlings was named president of the University of Iowa, a position he held until 1995. Rawlings is married to Elizabeth T. Rawlings (née Trapnell), who is a professional translator with a master's degree in French from the University of North Carolina and a Master of Fine Arts degree in Literary Translation from the University of Iowa. She has translated and collaborated in translating a number of books from French to English, particularly in the fields of Greek and Latin literature and ancient history. The Rawlingses have four children and five grandchildren. His eldest daughter, also Elizabeth, works for the Department of Homeland Securityhttps://www.lawyer.com/elizabeth-rawlings.html and his eldest son, Hunter Rawlings IV is New York Times Bestselling author and a former U.S. Marine Corps reconnaissance officer.https://riprawlings.com/bio/https://www.1stmardiv.marines.mil/Leaders/1st- Marine-Division-Leaders/Article/578806/lieutenant-colonel-rawlings/ President of Cornell University Rawlings came to Cornell University, becoming its 10th president, serving from 1995 until 2003. At Cornell, he was an effective fundraiser, presiding over several large capital campaigns. Rawlings created several new positions and programs to support undergraduate education, began the construction of several new dormitories, centralized the location of freshmen on campus (initially protested by Al Sharpton and others due to alleged racial implications), and promoted stronger undergraduate admissions standards. Rawlings began initiatives in certain areas of science and engineering that he considered especially important to the future (such as bioinformatics, computational biology, computer and information sciences, genomics, and materials science), and began plans for Weill Hall, a large new life sciences building which houses the Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology. He encouraged interdisciplinary exchanges in the humanities and social sciences. He also presided over an agreement to establish a branch of Cornell's medical school in Qatar, the Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar. While President of Cornell, Rawlings also held the rank of professor of classics, and continued to hold this position after he left the presidency. Notably, during the last two years of his presidency, he taught an undergraduate course in classics. At the same time, Rawlings faced criticism from many students and alumni leaders for his hands-off approach toward the student body and his focus on the business operations of Cornell. After the sudden resignation of his successor as president, Jeffrey Lehman, effective June 30, 2005, Rawlings agreed to reassume the presidency on an interim basis until a permanent replacement could be found. On January 21, 2006, David J. Skorton was announced as the next president of Cornell. Skorton took office on July 1. (Like Rawlings, Skorton was previously President of the University of Iowa.) After the sudden passing of Skorton's successor, President Elizabeth Garrett, in March 2016, Rawlings was appointed interim president. He began on April 25, 2016. Research Rawlings' research focuses on Greek history and historiography. His scholarly publications include a book, The Structure of Thucydides' History (Princeton University Press, 1981).

Early life Sadanobu was born in Edo Castle on January 15, 1759, into the Tayasu branch of the Tokugawa house. The Tayasu was one of the gosankyō, the senior- most of the lesser cadet branches of the Shōgun's family, which still bore the name Tokugawa (instead of the greater cadet branches which had the Matsudaira surname).Ooms, Herman. (1975). Charismatic Bureaucrat: A Political Biography of Matsudaira Sadanobu, 1758–1829, p. 17. His father was Tayasu Munetake, the son of the reform-minded eighth shōgun Tokugawa Yoshimune.Ooms, p. 17. The Tayasu house stood apart from the other cadet branches resident in Edo Castle, living a more austere lifestyle, following the example set by Yoshimune—in Munetake's words, the praise of manly spirit (masuraoburi) as opposed to feminine spirit (taoyameburi).Ooms, p. 19. It also set itself apart from the other branches due to its history of thwarted political ambition—the founder, Munetake, had hoped to become his father's heir but was passed over for Yoshimune's eldest son, Ieshige. As a result, Sadanobu was brought up from a very young age with the hopes of being placed as the next shogunal heir. His education was very thorough, being done along Confucian lines, and by his teens Sadanobu had already read and memorized much of the Confucian canon. As he matured, there was a further onus on Sadanobu for success as several members of the Tayasu house began to die young. Further attempts were made by the family to place Sadanobu as the next shogunal heir, but they were thwarted by the political clique of Tanuma Okitsugu, who was then in power as the chief rōjū. Career Following the last failed attempt at adoption by the shōgun, Sadanobu was adopted by Matsudaira Sadakuni, head of one of the Hisamatsu- Matsudaira houses (another Tokugawa cadet branch), which ruled the Shirakawa Domain in southern Mutsu Province (with an assessment of 110,000 koku), succeeding to headship in late 1783 following his stepfather's protracted illness.Ooms, pp. 17, 50. He was immediately faced with his domain's economically disastrous position: of 110,000 koku that it was supposed to be able to produce, 108,600 had been reported \\"lost\\".Ooms, p. 50. Sadanobu worked ceaselessly to fix the economic situation in Shirakawa, finally saving it and bringing its finances and agriculture back to stability. These reforms, coupled with Sadanobu's continued political maneuvering, brought him fame, and he was named chief councilor of the Shogunate in the summer of 1787, and regent to the 11th shōgun Tokugawa Ienari early the following year.Totman, Conrad. (1988) Politics in the Tokugawa Bakufu, 1600–1843, p. 224. This period of Sadanobu's strengthening of the already faltering Tokugawa regime is known as the Kansei Reforms. His policies could as well be construed as a reactionary response to the excesses of his predecessor under Shōgun Ieharu.Hall, J. (1955). Tanuma Okitsugu: Forerunner of Modern Japan, 1719–1788. pp. 131–142. He recovered the finances of the Shogunate to some extent, and had some success in rescuing its reputation. However, following the Title Incident and the visit of Adam Laxman, Sadanobu's credibility and popularity in the Tokugawa bureaucracy became overtaxed, and true to the suggestion in his autobiography that \\"one should retire before discontent sets in\\", he resigned.Ooms, p. 152. Literature Aside from his political reforms, Sadanobu was also known as a writer and a moralist, working under the pen name Rakuō (楽翁). Some of his notable texts include Uge no Hitokoto, Tōzen Manpitsu, Kanko-dōri, Kagetsutei Nikki, Seigo, and Ōmu no Kotoba, among others.Ooms, p. 25. Some time after his death, it was discovered that he had written a satirical text parodying daimyō life, titled Daimyō Katagi. Scholars have since been somewhat taken aback by this discovery, since the text falls into the category of gesaku, which Sadanobu officially opposed. Later years Though Sadanobu resigned from his position on the senior council, he continued to keep up with political affairs, especially keeping in close touch with Matsudaira Nobuaki (his successor in the senior council), as well as the rector of the Shogunate's college, Hayashi Jussai, whom he had personally installed in that position.Ooms, p. 144. During these last few years of his rule in Shirakawa, he was also involved in matters of national defense, taking up security duties on the Bōsō Peninsula in 1810 together with Matsudaira Katahiro of Aizu.Ooms, pp. 151–152 In domainal matters, Sadanobu continued to devote himself to the reforms he had established, as well as to education. He retired from the family headship in 1819, and was succeeded by his son Sadanaga. Sadanobu died in 1829, and according to his will, his son petitioned the Yoshida family in Kyoto to grant him the deified title of Shukoku- daimyōjin. This was granted in three stages, in 1833, 1834, and 1855.Ooms, p. 44n; 155. Sadanobu was enshrined together with the Hisamatsu founder Sadatsuna, Sugawara no Michizane, and two other figures, in the Chinkoku- Shukoku shrine.Ooms, p. 44n This shrine has branches both in Kuwana, where Sadanaga was transferred, and in Sadanobu's former fief of Shirakawa, where the shrine was built in 1918. One of Sadanaga's sons, Itakura Katsukiyo, became almost as famous as his grandfather in the late Edo era, due to his attempted reforms of the Shogunate. References Bibliography * Backus, Robert L.

In the northern part of the area settlements slowly formed. Eventually, a ribbon shaped village formed between the 1621 lock in the Slikkerdijk and the ditch named De Kolk. This village was named after the polder. After a new lock was constructed on the other side of De Kolk, at the Pishoek and the Waardkanaal, a settlement center arose there. This center was named Nieuwesluis. In 1742, on top of the Noorderdijk, a windmill was built. The settlement center which arose there was named De Molens, and five other windmills appeared around the same time and ensured the draining of the polder. More houses appeared around these mills than in the ribbon shaped village. With the construction of the church in 1812, that tendency became stronger, and \\"Wieringerwaard\\" meant the village round the mills, and the placename De Molens disappeared. In 1949, the lock in the Slikkerdijk, which had already been renewed twice, was demolished, which was a reason for the village not to be extended in that direction.  Curiosities  As well as het Witte Kerkje there are more curiosities in Wieringerwaard, such as many monumental farms. The windmill named De Hoop, which was built in 1742 and which was converted to a corn mill in 1972, is open for visitors every Saturday, weekday only on appointment. Wieringerwaard also has a water tower. Every year at the beginning of May the flower days are held. Flower mosaics made of hyacinths are to be seen in the village on these days.

The symptoms of a hemothorax include chest pain and difficulty breathing, while the clinical signs include reduced breath sounds on the affected side and a rapid heart rate. Hemothoraces are usually caused by an injury but may occur spontaneously: due to cancer invading the pleural cavity, as a result of a blood clotting disorder, as an unusual manifestation of endometriosis, in response to a collapsed lung, or rarely in association with other conditions. Hemothoraces are usually diagnosed using a chest X-ray, but can be identified using other forms of imaging including ultrasound, a CT scan, or an MRI scan. They can be differentiated from other forms of fluid within the pleural cavity by analysing a sample of the fluid, and are defined as having a hematocrit of greater than 50% that of the person's blood. Hemothoraces may be treated by draining the blood using a chest tube, but may require surgery if the bleeding continues. If treated, the prognosis is usually good. Complications of a hemothorax include infection within the pleural cavity and the formation of scar tissue.  Signs and symptoms  The symptoms of a hemothorax depend on the quantity of blood that has been lost into the pleural cavity. A small hemothorax usually causes little in the way of symptoms, while larger hemothoraces commonly cause breathlessness and chest pain, and occasionally lightheadedness. Other symptoms may occur in association with a hemothorax depending on the underlying cause. The clinical signs of a hemothorax include reduced or absent breath sounds and reduced movement of the chest wall on the affected side. When the affected side is tapped or percussed, a dull sound may be heard in contrast to the usual resonant note. Large hemothoraces that interfere with the ability to transfer oxygen may cause a blue tinge to the lips (cyanosis). In these cases the body may try to compensate for the loss of blood, leading to a rapid heart rate (tachycardia), and pale, cool, clammy skin.  Causes  = Traumatic = A hemothorax is often caused by an injury, either blunt trauma or wounds that penetrate the chest, and these cases are referred to traumatic hemothoraces. Even relatively minor chest injuries can lead to significant hemothoraces. Injuries often cause the rupture of small blood vessels such as those found between the ribs. However, if larger blood vessels such as the aorta are damaged, the blood loss can be massive. = Iatrogenic = Hemothorax can also occur as a complication of heart and lung surgery, for example the rupture of lung arteries caused by the placement of catheters. = Non-traumatic = Less frequently, hemothoraces may occur spontaneously. A hemothorax can complicate some forms of cancer if the tumour invades the pleural space. Tumours responsible for hemothoraces include angiosarcomas, schwannomas, mesothelioma, and lung cancer. Hemothoraces are more likely to occur in response to very minor trauma when blood is less able to form clots, either as result of medications such as anticoagulants, or because of bleeding disorders such as haemophilia. Rarely, hemothoraces can arise due to endometriosis, a condition in which tissue that normally covers the inside of the uterus forms in unusual locations. Endometrial tissue that implants on the pleural surface can bleed in response to the hormonal changes of the menstrual cycle, causing what is known as a catamenial hemothorax as part of the thoracic endometriosis syndrome. It represents 14% of cases of thoracic endometriosis syndrome. Those with an abnormal accumulation of air within the pleural space (a pneumothorax) can bleed into the cavity, which occurs in about 5% of cases of spontaneous pneumothorax. The resulting combination of air and blood within the pleural space is known as a hemopneumothorax. Rarely, hemothoraces can occur following spontaneous tearing of blood vessels such as in an aortic dissection, although bleeding in these circumstances is usually into the pericardial space. Spontaneous tearing of blood vessels is more likely to occur in those with disorders that weaken blood vessels such as some forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or in those with malformed blood vessels as is seen in Rendu-Osler- Weber syndrome. Other rare causes of hemothorax include neurofibromatosis type 1 and extramedullary haematopoiesis. Mechanisms Autopsy specimen showing a large clotted hemothorax filling the entire pleural cavity. The thoracic cavity is a chamber within the chest, containing the lungs, heart, and numerous major blood vessels. Thin sheets of tissue known as the pleural membranes or pleura line the chest and cover the lungs - the chest wall is lined by the parietal pleura, while the visceral pleura covers the outside of the lungs. The visceral and parietal pleura are normally separated by only a thin layer of fluid, forming the pleural cavity. When a hemothorax occurs, blood enters the pleural cavity. The blood loss has several effects. Firstly, as blood builds up within the pleural cavity, it begins to interfere with the normal movement of the lungs, preventing one or both lungs from fully expanding and thereby interfering with the normal transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide to and from the blood. Secondly, blood that has been lost into the pleural cavity can no longer be circulated. Hemothoraces can lead to very significant blood loss - each half of the thorax can hold more than 1500 milliliters of blood, representing more than 25% of an average adult's total blood volume. The body may struggle to cope with this blood loss, and in order to compensate tries to maintain blood pressure by forcing the heart to pump harder and faster, and by squeezing or constricting small blood vessels in the arms and legs. These compensatory mechanisms can be recognised by a rapid resting heart rate and cool fingers and toes. If the blood within the pleural cavity is not removed, it will eventually clot. This clot tends to stick the parietal and visceral pleura together and has the potential to lead to scarring within the pleura, which if extensive leads to the condition known as a fibrothorax. Following the initial loss of blood, a small hemothorax may irritate the pleura, causing additional fluid to seep out, leading to a bloodstained pleural effusion. Furthermore, as enzymes in the pleural fluid begin to break down the clot, the protein concentration of the pleural fluid increases. As a result, the osmotic pressure of the pleural cavity increases, causing fluid to leak into the pleural cavity from the surrounding tissues. Diagnosis Hemothoraces are most commonly detected using a chest X-ray, although ultrasound is sometimes used in an emergency setting. However, plain X-rays may miss smaller hemothoraces while other imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging may be more sensitive. In cases where the nature of an effusion is in doubt, a sample of fluid can be aspirated and analysed in a procedure called thoracentesis.167x167px = Chest X-ray = 160x160px153x153px A chest X-ray is the most common technique used to diagnosis a hemothorax. X-rays should ideally be taken in an upright position (an erect chest X-ray), but may be performed with the person lying on their back (supine) if an erect chest X-ray is not feasible. On an erect chest X-ray, a hemothorax is suggested by blunting of the costophrenic angle or partial or complete opacification of the affected half of the thorax. On a supine film the blood tends to layer in the pleural space, but can be appreciated as a haziness of one half of the thorax relative to the other. A small hemothorax may be missed on a chest X-ray as several hundred milliliters of blood can be hidden by the diaphragm and abdominal viscera on an erect film. Supine X-rays are even less sensitive and as much as one liter of blood can be missed on a supine film. = Other forms of imaging = left Ultrasonography may also be used to detect hemothorax and other pleural effusions. This technique is of particular use in the critical care and trauma settings as it provides rapid, reliable results at the bedside. Ultrasound is more sensitive than chest x-ray in detecting hemothorax. Computed tomography (CT or CAT) scans may be useful for diagnosing retained hemothorax as this form of imaging can detect much smaller amounts of fluid than a plain chest X-ray. However, CT is less used as a primary means of diagnosis within the trauma setting, as these scans require a critically ill person to be transported to a scanner, are slower, and require the subject to remain supine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to differentiate between a hemothorax and other forms of pleural effusion, and can suggest how long the hemothorax has been present for. Fresh blood can be seen as a fluid with low T1 but high T2 signals, while blood that has been present for more than a few hours displays both low T1 and T2 signals. MRI is used infrequently in the trauma setting due to the prolonged time required to perform an MRI, and the deterioration in image quality that occurs with motion. = Thoracentesis = alt= Although imaging techniques can demonstrate that fluid is present within the pleural space, it may be unclear what this fluid represents. To establish the nature of the fluid, a sample can be removed by inserting a needle into the pleural cavity in a procedure known as a thoracentesis or pleural tap. In this context, the most important assessment of the pleural fluid is the percentage by volume that is taken up by red blood cells (the hematocrit), which can be estimated by dividing the red blood cell count of the pleural fluid by 100,000. A hemothorax is defined as having a hematocrit of at least 50% of that found in the affected person's blood, although the hematocrit of a chronic hemothorax may be between 25 and 50% if additional fluid has been secreted by the pleura. Thoracentesis is the test most commonly used to diagnose a hemothorax in animals. Management The management of a hemothorax depends largely on the extent of bleeding. While small haemothoraces may require little in the way of treatment, larger hemothoraces may require fluid resuscitation to replace the blood that has been lost, drainage of the blood within the pleural space using a procedure known as a tube thoracostomy, and potentially surgery in the form of a thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) to prevent further bleeding. Additional treatment options include antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection and fibrinolytic therapy to break down clotted blood within the pleural space. = Thoracostomy = A tube thoracostomy unit Blood in the cavity can be removed by inserting a drain (chest tube) in a procedure called a tube thoracostomy. This procedure is indicated for most causes of haemothorax, but should be avoided in aortic rupture which should be managed with immediate surgery. The thoracostomy tube is usually placed between the ribs in the sixth or seventh intercostal space at the mid-axillary line. It is important to avoid a chest tube becoming obstructed by clotted blood as obstruction prevents adequate drainage of the pleural space. Clotting occurs as the clotting cascade is activated when the blood leaves the blood vessels and comes into contact with the pleural surface, injured lung or chest wall, or the thoracostomy tube. Inadequate drainage may lead to a retained hemothorax, increasing the risk of infection within the pleural space (empyema) or the formation of scar tissue (fibrothorax). Thoracostomy tubes with a diameter of 24–36 F (large-bore tubes) should be used, as these reduce the risk of blood clots obstructing the tube. Manual manipulation of chest tubes (also referred to as milking, stripping, or tapping) is commonly performed to maintain an open tube, but no conclusive evidence has demonstrated that this improves drainage. If a chest tube does become obstructed, the tube can be cleared using open or closed techniques. Tubes should be removed as soon as drainage has stopped, as prolonged tube placement increases the risk of empyema. An emergency thoracotomy = Surgery = 10–20% of traumatic hemothoraces require surgical management. Larger hemothoraces, or those that continue to bleed following drainage, may require surgery. This surgery may take the form of a traditional open-chest procedure (a thoracotomy), but may be performed using video-associated thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). While there is no universally accepted cutoff for the volume of blood loss required before surgery is indicated, generally accepted indications include more than 1500 mL of blood drained from a thoracostomy, more than 200 mL of blood drained per hour, hemodynamic instability, or the need for repeat blood transfusions. VATS is less invasive and cheaper than an open thoracotomy, and can reduce the length of hospital stay, but a thoracotomy may be preferred when hypovolaemic shock is present. The procedure should ideally be performed within 72 hours of the injury as delay may increase the risk of complications. In clotted hemothorax, VATS is the gold standard procedure to remove the clot, and is indicated if the hemothorax fills 1/3 or more of a hemithorax. The ideal time to remove a clot using VATS is at 48–96 hours, but can be attempted up to nine days after the injury. = Other = Resuscitation with intravenous fluids or with blood products may be required. In fulminant cases, transfusions may be administered before admission to the hospital. Clotting abnormalities, such as those caused by anticoagulant medications, should be reversed. Prophylactic antibiotics should be given for 24 hours in the case of trauma. Blood clots may be retained within the pleural cavity despite chest tube drainage. Such retained clots should be removed, preferably with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). If VATS is unavailable, an alternative is fibrinolytic therapy such as streptokinase or urokinase given directly into the pleural space seven to ten days after the injury. Residual clot that does not dissipate in response to fibrinolytics may require surgical removal in the form of decortication. Prognosis The prognosis following a hemothorax depends on its size, the treatment given, and the underlying cause. While small hemothoraces may cause little in the way of problems, in severe cases an untreated hemothorax may be rapidly fatal due to uncontrolled blood loss. If left untreated, the accumulation of blood may put pressure on the mediastinum and the trachea, limiting the heart's ability to fill. However, if treated, the prognosis following a traumatic hemothorax is usually favourable and dependent on other injuries that have been sustained at the same time. Hemothoraces caused by benign conditions such as endometriosis have a good prognosis, while those caused by neurofibromatosis type 1 has a 36% rate of death, and those caused by aortic rupture are often fatal. = Complications = Complications can occur following a hemothorax, and are more likely to occur if the blood has not been adequately drained from the pleural cavity. Blood that remains within the pleural space can become infected, and is known as an empyema. The retained blood can also irritate the pleura, causing scar tissue to form. If extensive, this scar tissue can encase the lung, restricting movement of the chest wall, and is then referred to as a fibrothorax. Other potential complications include atelectasis, lung infection, intrathoracic hematoma, wound infection, pneumothorax, or sepsis.  Epidemology  There are about 300,000 cases of hemothorax in the U.S every year. Polytrauma (injury to multiple body systems) involves chest injuries in 60% of cases and commonly leads to hemothorax. About 37% of people hospitalized for blunt chest trauma have traumatic hemothorax.

Background Simkanin owned a company in Bedford, Texas, called Arrow Custom Plastics, Inc. In 1993, an accountant advised Simkanin that a required change in the accounting method for the company would result in greater corporate income tax. Simkanin then began to question the validity of the federal income tax. On his 1994 and 1995 personal tax returns, he made notations to indicate that the returns were filed under protest, and he did not file personal returns for years 1996 through 2001.United States v. Simkanin, 420 F.3d 397, 2005-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 50,507 (5th Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1911 (2006). Simkanin told his accountant he was not required to file returns because he lived off his savings and had no income. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in affirming his conviction, stated that this assertion was false and that Simkanin had received a salary from his company. The Court also stated that Simkanin had received payments from Arrow for his personal expenses and that those payments were booked as \\"repair and maintenance\\". In reviewing the case, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals stated: :In 1996, Simkanin surrendered his Texas driver's license, and when stopped by the police while driving, he showed a card styled \\"British West Indies International Motor Vehicle Qualification Card\\" which he had acquired from a mail-order business in Connecticut. He also mailed the U.S. Treasury Secretary a statement that he had expatriated himself from the United States and repatriated to the Republic of Texas. He posted the same statement on Arrow's internet website, where he also vowed to ignore the laws of the United States. :In 1997, Simkanin removed his name from Arrow's checking and credit card accounts, replacing his name with the name of Arrow's bookkeeper [...] Simkanin told [the bookkeeper] that he did not want his name to appear on documents requiring his social security number. Simkanin then listed [the bookkeeper] as Arrow's president on various legal documents, although he retained complete de facto responsibility for the company's affairs and continued to make all of the decisions regarding finances and taxes. :By May 1999, Simkanin had become involved with an organization called We The People Foundation for Constitutional Education (\\"WTP\\"), which promotes the view that, despite common misconceptions, there is actually no law that requires most Americans to pay income taxes or most companies to withhold taxes from employees' paychecks. WTP also espouses the view that the Sixteenth Amendment was fraudulently declared to have been ratified. In accordance with these views, Simkanin told [his] accountant [...] and others that he was not required to pay taxes and that filing returns was purely voluntary. [The accountant] advised Simkanin that filing returns was not voluntary and that Simkanin could get into trouble if he did not file. Simkanin rejected this advice, and he began to pressure Arrow's employees to attend seminars sponsored by WTP. Advertisement in USA Today On March 2, 2002, a photograph of Simkanin and four other people appeared in a full-page advertisement in USA Today which announced that he had not withheld income taxes from the paychecks of his company's employees because he believed the income tax to be voluntary. The advertisement also requested donations for the We the People Foundation. Arrest, trial and conviction In June 2003, Simkanin was arrested and arraigned on various tax charges . On January 7, 2004, he was convicted by a United States federal court on ten counts of willfully failing to collect and pay over employment taxes under , fifteen counts of knowingly making and presenting false, fictitious or fraudulent claims for refund of employment taxes under and , and four counts of willfully failing to timely file federal income tax returns under . His convictions were upheld on appeal. Simkanin was sentenced to seven years in federal prison. After the sentencing, the Houston Chronicle reported: \\"U.S. District Judge John McBryde said during the sentencing that Simkanin was 'entrenched' in a 'cultlike' anti-government group that 'holds nothing but contempt for the laws of the United States. McBryde ordered Simkanin to pay the government $302,076 in restitution.\\"Houston Chronicle, \\"Businessman gets 7-year term for tax protest\\" by Thomas Korosec; Saturday, May 1, 2004, 3 star ed., section A, page 33. The Houston Chronicle also reported that a prosecutor indicated that Internal Revenue Service agents and prosecutors had given Simkanin \\"repeated opportunities to reconsider his position and begin paying taxes\\" before the government began criminal prosecution. Assistant United States Attorney David Jarvis was quoted as saying \\"I guess he just figured we wouldn't do anything.\\" Simkanin was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution at Texarkana, Texas. He was released on June 18, 2010. However, on June 23, 2010, he was order jailed again, pending a hearing to be held on July 1, 2010, regarding alleged violations of his terms of release.Order, entry 349, June 23, 2010, United States v.

For the purposes of local government, the town is part of the Dundalk Municipal District. It is situated on the southern shore of Carlingford Lough with Slieve Foy mountain as a backdrop, sometimes known as Carlingford Mountain, It is the main town on the Cooley Peninsula. Located on the R176/R173 roads between Greenore and Omeath village, Carlingford is approximately 27 km north east (by road) from Dundalk (15.6 km directly), 90 km north of Dublin and 11 km south of the border with Northern Ireland. Carlingford won the Irish Tidy Towns Competition in 1988. Carlingford still retains its medieval layout noticeable by the narrow lanes and small streets. Tholsel Street is where the last of the medieval walled town's gates can still be seen, called \\"The Tholsel\\" which apparently was also used as a gaol, on Tholsel Street itself there is still a 16th-century Town House known as the Carlingford Mint. History =Foundation= Carlingford was occupied in the 12th century by Norman knight Hugh de Lacy after laying the foundation stone for a castle on a strategic outcrop of rock. A settlement sprang up close to this fortress. The castle is known by the name of King John's Castle following a visit in the year 1210. The castle is an extensive ruin seated on a solid rock - the sides of which are enclosed by the sea. Mountains rise on the inland side, at the foot of which is a narrow pass which was formerly commanded by the fortress. =Prosperous years= Carlingford's strategic position on the east coast of Ireland (along with Carrickfergus and Drogheda) made it an important trading port. This trade led to its relative prosperity during the 14th, 15th and early 16th centuries. Carlingford's early prosperity faltered when, in 1388, the town was burnt to the ground, by a Scots force under the command of Sir William Douglas of Nithsdale. This was a punitive raid, following Irish attacks on Galloway, the Lord of which was Nithsdale's father, Archibald the Grim. Carlingford received five charters in total; the first in 1326 by Edward II and the last in 1619 under James I. The increased trade encouraged a mercantile class to build in the area, the results of which can be seen today in the remains of the Mint and Taffe's Castle. In 1637, the Surveyor General of Customs issued a report compiled from accounts of customs due from each port and their \\"subsidiary creeks\\". Of the Ulster ports on the list, Carrickfergus was first, followed by Bangor, Donaghadee, and Strangford. Carlingford and Coleraine each had £244 customs due and had equal ranking. Carlingford was regarded for its green finned oysters, which remained its main employment source, alongside herring fishing. The oysters were renowned throughout Britain and Europe while also gaining responses when mentioned in related texts. =War and ruin= The 1641 Rising by the Irish of Ulster, the Cromwellian Conquest of 1649, and the subsequent Williamite wars of the 1690s all took their toll on the local economy. As recorded in the Journal of Isaac Butler, Carlingford the town was in a \\"state of ruin\\" by 1744. However, the final nail in the coffin was the desertion to open water of the prosperous herring shoals that occupied the lough by the early 18th century. =Modern era= Carlingford's inability to develop a heavy industry allowed its mediaeval layout and archaeological artefacts to remain relatively intact. The area was opened up to tourism in the 1870s by the Dundalk, Newry and Greenore railway, which passed through Carlingford. This line closed in 1951. These transport links led to tourism being a key source of employment. Fishing was also important economically; particularly oysters and crabs from the nearby harbour. The town hosts the annual Carlingford Oyster Festival usually held in August. A passenger ferry operates daily out of the village of Omeath, away, during the summer months. On the day of the 1918 Irish general election, the Camlough Company of the Irish Volunteers travelled by train from Newry to Carlingford. On arrival, they found large numbers of Carlingford inhabitants wearing Union Jacks. The Volunteers ordered all the Royal Irish Constabulary men they saw on duty on the streets or at the polling booths to return to their barracks and to remain in them whilst the Volunteers were in Carlingford. A series of attacks were made on the Volunteers from by mobs on the streets. The Volunteers took control and sought to protect voters going to record their votes until the polling booths closed. Seamus Lyang from Dundalk was polling clerk in Carlingford and when the booths closed the Volunteers had to take Lyang under their protection and escort him out of the Carlingford. All the pubs and shops in Carlingford were hostile to the Volunteers and refused to serve them. After the closing of the poll, the Volunteers marched back to Camlough. =Cultural references= The Irish singer-songwriter Tommy Makem wrote a melancholy song about the town, \\"Farewell to Carlingford\\", covered by The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem and The Dubliners. In the Dublin Penny Journal they advised that in AD 432 St Patrick's second landing in Ireland was according to some authorities effected here. Places of interest The Tholsel * King John's Castle. Despite the western part being commissioned by Hugh de Lacy before 1186, the castle owes its name to King John (Richard the Lionheart's brother) who visited Carlingford in 1210. The eastern part was constructed in the mid 13th century with alterations and additions occurring in the 15th and 16th centuries. In the 1950s the Office of Public Works (OPW) undertook conservation work to stabilise the structure. A view of the north pier and lough can be had from the viewing area on the eastern side of the castle, though the castle itself is closed to the general public for safety reasons. * Taaffe's Castle / Merchant House. A fortified town house that according to local tradition belonged to the rich mercantile Taaffe family who became Earls of Carlingford in 1661. However, there is no evidence to suggest that it was built or in fact owned by the Taaffes. Early topographical maps provide evidence that it was in existence before the Taaffe family were provided with their Earl of Carlingford title, The Taaffes mainly resided in Sligo. The castles close proximity to the harbour would suggest a trading depot on the ground floor with the upper floors reserved for residence. The construction suggests two phases—the main tower built in the early 16th century while the extension to the side occurred later. * The Tholsel. The Tholsel or \\"town-gate\\" is the only remaining example of its nature in Carlingford and one of the few left in Ireland. Originally it was three stories high—the present appearance due to alteration made in the 19th century. The original function was to levy taxes on goods entering the town—the murder-holes on the side of the walls are testaments to that fact. In 1834 it was used by the Corporation of Carlingford for meeting and a Parliament is said to have used it to make laws for \\"The Pale\\". It was also used as a town gaol (jail) in the 18th century. * The Mint. A fortified three- storey townhouse belonging to a wealthy merchant family in the centre of Carlingford. While the right to mint coinage was not granted to Carlingford until 1467, it is unlikely that it was actually used as a mint. Its features include five highly decorated limestone windows. The patterns and motifs are an example of the influence of the Celtic Renaissance on art during the 16th century. * Dominican Friary. The Dominican Order was established in Carlingford in 1305 primarily because of their patron Richard Óg de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster, with the friary itself being dedicated to St. Malachy. Dissolved in 1540 by Henry VIII, it became the centre of a repossession struggle between the Dominicans and Franciscans in the 1670s. It was resolved in favour of the Dominicans by Oliver Plunkett. However, the friary itself was subsequently abandoned in the 18th century by the Dominicans to their present location of Dundalk. The remains today consist of a nave and chancel divided by a tower. Also, there are possible remains of some domestic buildings to the south like a mill, mill race and mill pond. * Town Wall. Established by charter in 1326 by Edward II to the Bailiffs of Carlingford it allowed them to levy murage for its building. Not much remains however but the little that does has some externally splayed musket loops that would indicate the arrival of firearms to Ireland in the late 15th century. It is likely that the wall had an external ditch to strengthen its defences. Its purpose was to serve as a barrier to ensure that goods entering the town had to pass through a town gate (and hence could be taxed) but it also had the purpose of creating a boundary between Gael and Norman. * Ghan House. A Georgian House built by William Stannus in 1727 it is surrounded by castellated walls and a guard tower. The first floor contains the drawing room which has a decorative ceiling of rococo plasterwork of flower garlands and medallion busts reputed to be of Stannus ladies. The basement contains two underground passageways (now blocked) that led to the Heritage Centre and the bakers (now chemist). The latter tunnel was reportedly used by a silent order of monks who once lived on the site and apparently supplied the local bakery but wished to avoid contact with townspeople. Today Ghan House is used as a guest house (with wine bar), ballroom, meeting room and cookery school. * Church of the Holy Trinity. Donated by the Church of Ireland to Carlingford this restored medieval church is also known as the Holy Trinity Heritage Centre. Exhibits inside display the history of Carlingford from Viking times to the present period. Musical recitals are common. The grounds outside contain a graveyard. * Market Square. Now the main street of Carlingford, this was the area where a weekly market was held with records of its layout going back to 1358. It is now the intersection of Dundalk Street and the beginning of River Lane. Transport Carlingford railway station opened on 1 August 1876, but finally closed on 1 January 1952 when the Dundalk, Newry & Greenore Railway ceased operations. In 1948 the film 'Saints and Sinners' used various locations around Carlingford including a scene at the beginning at the station of a DN&GR; train arriving. Bus Éireann route 161 operates Monday to Saturday, providing seven journeys to Dundalk via Greenore and four journeys to Newry via Omeath. This service does not operate on Sundays or Bank Holidays. On Sundays, Local Link Louth Meath Fingal route 701, operated by Halpenny Travel, provides three journeys to Dundalk, and three journeys to Newry via Omeath. Former railway station on the Dundalk, Newry and Greenore Railway. Carlingford also has a marina. People *Thomas D'Arcy McGee (13 April 1825, Carlingford - 7 April 1868, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) was the first Canadian politician to be assassinated, reportedly by a Fenian. A formerly radical politician, McGee became a moderate and urged Irish Catholics to address grievances via parliamentary rather than physical force methods. *Peter Boyle (26 Apr 1876, Carlingford - 24 Jun 1939, Doncaster, in Yorkshire, England) was a footballer. Capped five times for Ireland, played for FA Cup Winners Sheffield United in 1899 and 1902. *Arthur Moore, recipient of the Victoria Cross *Hans Moore (1834–89), British Army Major who received the Victoria Cross during the Cape Frontier Wars *Rev.

Kovalevsky saw that the notochord (1) and gill slit (5) are features shared by tunicates and vertebrates. Kowalevsky showed that all animals go through a period of gastrulation. Kovalevsky discovered that tunicates were not molluscs, but that their larval stage had a notochord and pharyngeal slits, like vertebrates. Further, these structures developed from the same germ layers in the embryo as the equivalent structures in vertebrates, so he argued that the tunicates should be grouped with the vertebrates as chordates. 19th century zoology thus converted embryology into an evolutionary science, connecting phylogeny with homologies between the germ layers of embryos, foreshadowing evolutionary developmental biology.

Life Born at Fairnilee House, in the Scottish Borders, between Galashiels and Selkirk, she was the daughter of Robert Rutherfurd of Fairnalee. She married an impoverished advocate, Patrick Cockburn of Ormiston in 1731. Unable to afford a home of their own they lived for 4 years in the house of her elderly father-in-law, \\"an old Presbyterian of the deepest dye\\" who condemned as ungodly cards, plays, and dancing. On the death of the old man they moved to Edinburgh, and she began to mix in society where her liveliness and wit made her welcome in spite of her relatively lowly status. In 1745 during the Jacobite rising she vented her Whiggism in a squib upon Bonnie Prince Charlie, and narrowly escaped being taken by the Highland guard as she was driving through Edinburgh in the family coach of the Keiths of Ravelston, with the parody in her pocket. This cites her Letters and Memorials ... with notes by T. Craig Brown (1900). Her husband died on 29 April 1753, and left her a small income. She continued to mix in artistic and intellectual circles from her home in Bristo Street, on Castle-hill, Edinburgh. Despite the added loss of her only son in infancy we are told of, \\"her insatiable love of mischief, mockery and match-making, everywhere welcome, both in town and country, a good companion, a wise friend, ready to jest over her own ailments.\\" In 1765 she published her lyrics to the traditional Border Ballad the Flowers of the Forest beginning \\"I've seen the smiling of Fortune beguiling\\". It is said to have been written before her marriage in 1731 and concerns a financial crisis that had ruined the fortunes of a number of the Selkirk Lairds. Later biographers, however, think it probable that it was written on the departure to London of a certain John Aikman, with whom Alison appears to have had an early attachment. Another later set of lyrics to the song by Jean Elliot of Minto written in 1756 is also in circulation and should not be confused with Rutherford's. In 1777 she remarked of a young Walter Scott that he was \\"the most extraordinary genius of a boyo.\\" She befriended Robert Burns in 1786, whom she described as having \\"a most enthusiastic heart of love\\". She was a great friend of the philosopher David Hume. She was an indefatigable letter-writer and a composer of parodies, squibs, toasts and \\"character sketches\\", then a favourite form of composition. The \\"Flowers of the Forest\\" however is considered the only thing she wrote that possesses lasting literary merit. At her house on Castlehill, and afterwards in Crichton Street, she received many illustrious friends, among whom were Henry Mackenzie, William Robertson, David Hume, John Home, Lord Monboddo,Betteridge, R. & McLean, R. (2019), Northern Lights: The Scottish Enlightenment, National Library of Scotland, p. 10 the Keiths of Ravelston, the Balcarres family and Lady Anne Barnard, the author of \\"Auld Robin Gray.\\" As a Rutherfurd she had a connexion with Sir Walter Scott's mother, and was her intimate friend. Lockhart quotes a letter written by Mrs Cockburn in 1777, describing the conduct of little Walter Scott, then scarcely six years old, during a visit which she paid to his mother, when the child gave as a reason for his liking for Mrs Cockburn that she was a \\"virtuoso like himself.\\" Cockburn died on 22 November 1794. She is buried in the kirkyard of St. Cuthbert's Chapel of Ease in Edinburgh.

He is best known for his work documenting the history of the silent era, having become interested in silent film at the age of eleven. This interest grew into a career spent documenting and restoring film. Brownlow has rescued many silent films and their history. His initiative in interviewing many largely forgotten, elderly film pioneers in the 1960s and 1970s preserved a legacy of early mass-entertainment cinema. He received an Academy Honorary Award at the 2nd Annual Governors Awards given by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on 13 November 2010.https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100825/ap_on_en_mo/us_film_honorary_oscars_4 This was the first occasion on which an Academy Honorary Award was given to a film preservationist. Early life Brownlow was born in Crowborough, Sussex, the only child of Thomas Brownlow, an Irish commercial artist making film posters for The Rank Organisation and Disney, and his wife Ninya (née Fortnum), also an artist, who was the daughter of a Governor of Trinidad and Tobago. He grew up in Finchley Road, north London. His first exposure to films came at prep school, where films rented from Wallace Heaton were screened. He attended Haileybury, where his contemporaries included John Howard Davies. He was rejected from national service due to short-sightedness. He began collecting silent films at the age of 11, and at age 15 he began apprenticing in the British film industry - he began as an office boy, and within five days was assigned as a trainee assistant editor, becoming an editor in 1958, working on a string of documentaries. Writing fan letters to silent film directors, he began to strike up a correspondence with figures from silent-era cinema.[Tony Fletcher, 'Face to Face with Kevin Brownlow' interview, 2018 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeA1c1WaD8]  It Happened Here and Winstanley  Brownlow's interest in the Second World War prompted the creation of his alternative-history film It Happened Here, premised upon the Nazis having conquered Britain. Brownlow began work on the film at the age of 18 and soon began to collaborate with a 16-year-old friend, Andrew Mollo. After eight years of struggle, during which the film's content changed dramatically, it was completed in 1964 with the last-minute aid of Tony Richardson.Robinson, David (1968). \\"Introduction\\", pp. 11–20. In Kevin Brownlow, How It Happened Here. London & Japan: UKA Press 2007, . The film was widely seen in the UK at film festivals, and it was picked up for major distribution by United Artists (UA). There were negative reactions in the media to parts of the film, complaints from some Jewish groups, and in October 1965 UA's American president, Arthur B. Krim, said the film would not see theatrical release unless the offending parts were cut out. Brownlow and Mollo tried to convince UA to run the film complete, but they were outmanoeuvred. The film finally began its theatrical run in May 1966, minus the disputed scenes. It was seen in London, New York, Copenhagen, Paris, Stockholm, Los Angeles and Haifa, and was reviewed positively. After the run, UA reported to Brownlow and Mollo that all of the box-office receipts had been used to pay the advertising and distribution costs. The two filmmakers did not make any money from the film. In 1968, Brownlow published a book, How It Happened Here, which described the making of the film, and the reception it received. Not only does it explain how two teenage boys made a feature film, it also explores the provocative social issues raised by the film. Brownlow had allowed genuine British Fascists to play themselves in the film, which angered some Jewish organizations. The book contained almost 100 pictures, mostly stills from the film and an introduction by film critic and author David Robinson. A new edition was published by UKA Press in 2007. After this cinematic feat Mollo and Brownlow began another project, Winstanley, about Gerrard Winstanley and the Diggers' commune following the English Civil War. The duo spent several years trying to gain support and following a long and difficult shoot, the film was released in 1975. In 2009 UKA Press published Winstanley: Warts and All, a making-of book. Brownlow had written it shortly after completing work on the film, but the manuscript sat on the shelf for 34 years before being published.  Cinema history and preservation  Brownlow's first book on silent film, The Parade's Gone By..., was published in 1968. The book features many interviews with the leading actors and directors of the silent era, and began his career as a film historian. He spent many years gaining support for the restoration of Abel Gance's French epic, Napoléon (1927), a then-mutilated film that used many novel cinematic techniques. Brownlow's championing of the film succeeded, and the restored version, with a new score by Carl Davis, was shown in London in 1980, and again in London in 2013 with the Philharmonia Orchestra. Gance lived to see the acclaim for his restored film. The San Francisco Silent Film Festival presented the complete 2000 restoration of the film, with Davis conducting his score, at the Paramount Theatre Oakland in March 2012. Brownlow also began a collaboration with David Gill, with whom he produced several documentaries on the silent era. The first was Hollywood (1980), a 13-part history of the silent era in Hollywood, produced by Thames Television. This was followed by Unknown Chaplin (1983) (Charlie Chaplin), Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow (1987) (Buster Keaton), Harold Lloyd: The Third Genius (1989) (Harold Lloyd) and Cinema Europe: the Other Hollywood (1995), among others. They also restored and released many classic silent films through the Thames Silents series (later via Photoplay Productions) in the 1980s and 1990s, generally with new musical scores by Carl Davis. The Search for Charlie Chaplin (2005; new version: 2010, UKA Press), a making-of book for Unknown Chaplin, was published in 2010. Since David Gill died in 1997, Brownlow has continued to produce documentaries and conduct film restoration with Patrick Stanbury. These include Lon Chaney, A Thousand Faces (2000), Garbo, a documentary produced for Turner Classic Movies to mark the centenary of actress Greta Garbo's birth, and I Am King Kong (2005) about filmmaker Merian C. Cooper. In August 2010, Brownlow received an Honorary Academy Award for his role in film and cinema history preservation. On 13 November 2016, Brownlow was featured in an episode of The Film Programme entitled 'Napoleon and I', dedicated to Abel Gance's masterpiece, the 1927 film, Napoléon on BBC Radio 4, the UK network. It tells how Brownlow has spent 50 years of his life, piecing together the lost sequences into the latest restoration of the silent movie and about his meeting the dapper Gance, when still a schoolboy. On 9 August 2018, Brownlow again featured on The Film Programme on BBC Radio 4, where he discussed the making of and initial responses to It Happened Here. In April 2019, Brownlow was honored at the Turner Classic Movie Festival in Hollywood at a screening of It Happened Here at the Egyptian Theatre.TCM Festival website, festival program Filmography =Directorial credits= Feature films *It Happened Here (1964, co- director, co-writer, cinematographer, editor) *Winstanley (1975, co-director, co-producer, co-writer) Cinema documentaries *The World of Josef Von Sternberg (Episode of BBC TV series The Movies, aired 16 January 1967) *Abel Gance: The Charm of Dynamite (1968) *Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film (TV series, 13 episodes, 1980) *Unknown Chaplin (TV series, 3 episodes, 1983) *Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow (TV series, 3 episodes, 1987) *Harold Lloyd: The Third Genius (TV series, 2 episodes, 1989) *D.

Kaū was one of the six original districts of ancient Hawaii on the island, known as moku. It includes the areas of South Point (Ka Lae), Hawaiian Ocean View Estates (HOVE), Hawaiian Ocean View Ranchos (HOVR), now together known as Ocean View, Nīnole, Waiōhinu, Naālehu and Pāhala.Kaū Chamber of Commerce official web site The district contains much of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, including the volcanoes Kīlauea and Mauna Loa, and Punaluu Black Sand Beach, Papakōlea (Green Sand) Beach and Kamilo Beach. To the east of Kaū is the Puna District, and to the west is the South Kona District.Juvik and Juvik editors, 1998, Atlas of Hawaii, University of Hawaii Press, The Sugar Cane Era: The Beginning. The largest commerce in Ka'u was sugar and leading the industry during its prime was Hawaiian Agriculture Co and Hutchinson Sugar Plantation Co. Hawaiian Agriculture Co was established in 1876 but did not start producing sugar cane until 1880. Locally, it was known as the Pahala Plantation but legally the corporation was filed as the Hawaiian Agricultural Co. The company employed many locals including immigrants from Philippines, Japan, Portugal, and others. Corporate housing projects were built to provide living quarters for staff and added to the community of Pahala. The founders were Peter C. Jones, Charles R. Bishop, J.D. Brewer, and H.A.P. Carter. The Hutchinson Sugar Plantation Co was established in 1868 by Alexander Hutchinson and it was one of the oldest sugar companies on the Big Island. Shortly, the plantation was renamed Naalehu Sugar Plantation. In his honor, following Hutchinson's death in 1873, William G. Irwin and Claus Spreckels purchased the plantation and renamed it Hutchinson Sugar Plantation. The company purchased Hilea Sugar Plantation in 1890. In 1910, it was purchased by C. Brewer & Co. Just like its competitor, Hawaiian Agriculture Co, the company employed many locals including immigrants from Philippines, Japan, Portugal, and others. Corporate housing projects were built to provide living quarters for staff and added to the community of Na'alehu. The Sugar Cane Era: The Conclusion. In 1972, Hawaiian Agricultural Co. merged with Hutchinson Sugar Plantation Co. The merged companies were renamed Kau Sugar Co and was now the only sugar plantation in Ka'u. However, this unified industry was short lived. After twenty four years, the sugar cane era finally came to an end with the Ka'u Sugar Co closing operation in 1996. The coffee industry has been low profile since the early 1900s. However, after the closure of the Ka'u Sugar co, interest in growing coffee has surged. Many of Ka'u Sugar co staff were given the option to acquire a land lease in five acre increments to engage in agriculture commerce. From the lease lots along with private owned lots, coffee were being grown. The most popular varietals that are grown in the area is Typica and Caturra. Over the years, the coffee industry has been growing in importance,Kaū Coffee Growers Cooperative web site with the Kaū Coffee Festival held in Pāhala.Kaū Coffee Festival official web site Southernmost point The southernmost point of any state in the United States is at Ka Lae Point in the Kaū District.

(Black areas are empty, red areas are nonempty.) In first-order logic the empty domain is the empty set having no members. In traditional and classical logic domains are restrictedly non-empty in order that certain theorems be valid. Interpretations with an empty domain are shown to be a trivial case by a convention originating at least in 1927 with Bernays and Schönfinkel (though possibly earlier) but oft-attributed to Quine 1951. The convention is to assign any formula beginning with a universal quantifier the value truth while any formula beginning with an existential quantifier is assigned the value falsehood. This follows from the idea that existentially quantified statements have existential import (i.e. they imply the existence of something) while universally quantified statements do not. This interpretation reportedly stems from George Boole in the late 19th century but this is debatable. In modern model theory, it follows immediately for the truth conditions for quantified sentences: *A\\\\models\\\\exists x\\\\phi(x) \\\\text{ iff there is an } a\\\\in A\\\\text{ such that }A\\\\models\\\\phi[a] *A\\\\models\\\\forall x\\\\phi(x) \\\\text{ iff every } a\\\\in A\\\\text{ is such that }A\\\\models\\\\phi[a] In other words, an existential quantification of the open formula φ is true in a model iff there is some element in the domain (of the model) that satisfies the formula; i.e. iff that element has the property denoted by the open formula. A universal quantification of an open formula φ is true in a model iff every element in the domain satisfies that formula. (Note that in the metalanguage, \\"everything that is such that X is such that Y\\" is interpreted as a universal generalization of the material conditional \\"if anything is such that X then it is such that Y\\". Also, the quantifiers are given their usual objectual readings, so that a positive existential statement has existential import, while a universal one does not.) An analogous case concerns the empty conjunction and the empty disjunction. The semantic clauses for, respectively, conjunctions and disjunctions are given by *A\\\\models \\\\phi_1\\\\land\\\\dots\\\\land\\\\phi_n \\\\iff \\\\forall\\\\phi_i (1\\\\leq i\\\\leq n), A\\\\models \\\\phi_i *A\\\\models \\\\phi_1\\\\lor\\\\dots\\\\lor\\\\phi_n \\\\iff \\\\exists\\\\phi_i (1\\\\leq i\\\\leq n), A\\\\models \\\\phi_i. It is easy to see that the empty conjunction is trivially true, and the empty disjunction trivially false. Logics whose theorems are valid in every, including the empty, domain were first considered by Jaskowski 1934, Mostowski 1951, Hailperin 1953, Quine 1954, Leonard 1956, and Hintikka 1959. While Quine called such logics \\"inclusive\\" logic they are now referred to as free logic.

Note: For clarity, signal periods are not shown to scale. A class-D amplifier or switching amplifier is an electronic amplifier in which the amplifying devices (transistors, usually MOSFETs) operate as electronic switches, and not as linear gain devices as in other amplifiers. They operate by rapidly switching back and forth between the supply rails, being fed by a modulator using pulse width, pulse density, or related techniques to encode the audio input into a pulse train. The audio escapes through a simple low-pass filter into the loudspeaker. The high-frequency pulses are blocked. Since the pairs of output transistors are never conducting at the same time, there is no other path for current flow apart from the low-pass filter/loudspeaker. For this reason, efficiency can exceed 90%. History The first Class-D amplifier was invented by British scientist Alec Reeves in the 1950s and was first called by that name in 1955. The first commercial product was a kit module called the X-10 released by Sinclair Radionics in 1964. However, it had an output power of only 2.5 watts. The Sinclair X-20 in 1966 produced 20 watts, but suffered from the inconsistencies and limitations of the germanium-based BJT (bipolar junction transistor) transistors available at the time. As a result, these early class-D amplifiers were impractical and unsuccessful. Practical class-D amplifiers were later enabled by the development of silicon-based MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) technology. In 1978, Sony introduced the TA-N88, the first class-D unit to employ power MOSFETs and a switched-mode power supply. There were subsequently rapid developments in VDMOS (vertical DMOS) technology between 1979 and 1985. The availability of low-cost, fast-switching MOSFETs led to Class-D amplifiers becoming successful in the mid-1980s. The first class-D amplifier based integrated circuit was released by Tripath in 1996, and it saw widespread use. Basic operation Class-D amplifiers work by generating a train of rectangular pulses of fixed amplitude but varying width and separation, or varying number per unit time, representing the amplitude variations of the analog audio input signal. It is also possible to synchronize the modulator clock with an incoming digital audio signal, thus removing the necessity to convert it to analog. The output of the modulator is then used to gate the output transistors on and off alternately. Great care is taken to ensure that the pair of transistors are never allowed to conduct together, as this would cause a short circuit between the supply rails through the transistors. Since the transistors are either fully \\"on\\" or fully \\"off\\", they spend very little time in the linear region, and dissipate very little power. This is the main reason for their high efficiency. A simple low-pass filter consisting of an inductor and a capacitor provides a path for the low frequencies of the audio signal, leaving the high- frequency pulses behind. In cost sensitive applications the output filter is sometimes omitted. The circuit then relies on the inductance of the loudspeaker to keep the HF component from heating up the voice coil. The structure of a class-D power stage is somewhat comparable to that of a synchronously rectified buck converter (a type of non-isolated switched-mode power supply (SMPS)), but works backwards. Whereas buck converters usually function as voltage regulators, delivering a constant DC voltage into a variable load, and can only source current (one-quadrant operation), a class-D amplifier delivers a constantly changing voltage into a fixed load, where current and voltage can independently change sign (four-quadrant operation). A switching amplifier must not be confused with linear amplifiers that use an SMPS as their source of DC power. A switching amplifier may use any type of power supply (e.g., a car battery or an internal SMPS), but the defining characteristic is that the amplification process itself operates by switching. Unlike a SMPS, the amplifier has a much more critical job to do, to keep unwanted artifacts out of the output. Feedback is almost always used, for the same reasons as in traditional analog amplifiers, to reduce noise and distortion. Theoretical power efficiency of class-D amplifiers is 100%. That is to say, all of the power supplied to it is delivered to the load, none is turned to heat. This is because an ideal switch in its “on” state would conduct all the current but have no voltage loss across it, hence no heat would be dissipated. And when it is off, it would have the full supply voltage across it but no leak current flowing through it, and again no heat would be dissipated. Real-world power MOSFETs are not ideal switches, but practical efficiencies well over 90% are common. By contrast, linear AB-class amplifiers are always operated with both current flowing through and voltage standing across the power devices. An ideal class-B amplifier has a theoretical maximum efficiency of 78%. Class A amplifiers (purely linear, with the devices always \\"on\\") have a theoretical maximum efficiency of 50% and some versions have efficiencies below 20%. Terminology The term \\"class D\\" is sometimes misunderstood as meaning a \\"digital\\" amplifier. While some class-D amplifiers may indeed be controlled by digital circuits or include digital signal processing devices, the power stage deals with voltage and current as a function of non-quantized time. The smallest amount of noise, timing uncertainty, voltage ripple or any other non-ideality immediately results in an irreversible change of the output signal. The same errors in a digital system will only lead to incorrect results when they become so large that a signal representing a digit is distorted beyond recognition. Up to that point, non-idealities have no impact on the transmitted signal. Generally, digital signals are quantized in both amplitude and wavelength, while analog signals are quantized in one (e.g. PWM) or (usually) neither quantity. Signal modulation The 2-level waveform is derived using pulse-width modulation (PWM), pulse density modulation (sometimes referred to as pulse frequency modulation), sliding mode control (more commonly called \\"self-oscillating modulation\\" in the trade.The generic analysis of sliding mode control is quite math heavy. The specific case of 2-state self-oscillating class-D amplifiers is much more intuitive and can be found in Globally Modulated Self-Oscillating Amplifier with Improved Linearity, 37th AES Conference) or discrete-time forms of modulation such as delta-sigma modulation.The Analog Devices AD1990 class-D audio power amplifier is an example. The most basic way of creating the PWM signal is to use a high speed comparator (\\"C\\" in the block-diagram above) that compares a high frequency triangular wave with the audio input. This generates a series of pulses of which the duty cycle is directly proportional with the instantaneous value of the audio signal. The comparator then drives a MOS gate driver which in turn drives a pair of high-power switches (usually MOSFETs). This produces an amplified replica of the comparator's PWM signal. The output filter removes the high-frequency switching components of the PWM signal and recovers the audio information that the speaker can use. DSP-based amplifiers which generate a PWM signal directly from a digital audio signal (e. g. SPDIF) either use a counter to time the pulse lengthSandler et al., Ultra-Low Distortion Digital Power Amplification, Presented at the 91st AES convention or implement a digital equivalent of a triangle-based modulator. In either case, the time resolution afforded by practical clock frequencies is only a few hundredths of a switching period, which is not enough to ensure low noise. In effect, the pulse length gets quantized, resulting in quantization distortion. In both cases, negative feedback is applied inside the digital domain, forming a noise shaper which has lower noise in the audible frequency range. Design challenges =Switching speed= Two significant design challenges for MOSFET driver circuits in class-D amplifiers are keeping dead times and linear mode operation as short as possible. \\"Dead time\\" is the period during a switching transition when both output MOSFETs are driven into cut-off mode and both are \\"off\\". Dead times need to be as short as possible to maintain an accurate low-distortion output signal, but dead times that are too short cause the MOSFET that is switching on to start conducting before the MOSFET that is switching off has stopped conducting. The MOSFETs effectively short the output power supply through themselves in a condition known as \\"shoot-through\\". Meanwhile, the MOSFET drivers also need to drive the MOSFETs between switching states as fast as possible to minimize the amount of time a MOSFET is in linear mode—the state between cut-off mode and saturation mode where the MOSFET is neither fully on nor fully off and conducts current with a significant resistance, creating significant heat. Driver failures that allow shoot-through and/or too much linear mode operation result in excessive losses and sometimes catastrophic failure of the MOSFETs.Analytical and numerical analysis of dead-time distortion in power inverters There are also problems with using PWM for the modulator; as the audio level approaches 100%, the pulse width can get so narrow as to challenge the ability of the driver circuit and the MOSFET to respond. These pulses can get down to just a few nanoseconds and can result in the above undesired conditions of shoot-through and/or linear mode. This is why other modulation techniques such as pulse density modulation can get closer to the theoretical 100% efficiency than PWM. =Electromagnetic interference= The switching power stage generates both high dV/dt and dI/dt, which give rise to radiated emission whenever any part of the circuit is large enough to act as an antenna. In practice, this means the connecting wires and cables will be the most efficient radiators so most effort should go into preventing high-frequency signals reaching those: * Avoid capacitive coupling from switching signals into the wiring. * Avoid inductive coupling from various current loops in the power stage into the wiring. * Use one unbroken ground plane and group all connectors together, in order to have a common RF reference for decoupling capacitors * Include the equivalent series inductance of filter capacitors and the parasitic capacitance of filter inductors in the circuit model before selecting components. * Wherever ringing is encountered, locate the inductive and capacitive parts of the resonant circuit that causes it, and use parallel RC or series RL snubbers to reduce the Q of the resonance. * Do not make the MOSFETs switch any faster than needed to fulfil efficiency or distortion requirements. Distortion is more easily reduced using negative feedback than by speeding up switching. =Power supply design= Class-D amplifiers place an additional requirement on their power supply, namely that it be able to sink energy returning from the load. Reactive (capacitive or inductive) loads store energy during part of a cycle and release some of this energy back later. Linear amplifiers will dissipate this energy, class-D amplifiers return it to the power supply which should somehow be able to store it. In addition, half-bridge class D amplifiers transfer energy from one supply rail (e.g. the positive rail) to the other (e.g. the negative) depending on the sign of the output current. This happens regardless of whether the load is resistive or not. The supply should either have enough capacitive storage on both rails, or be able to transfer this energy back. =Active device selection= The active devices in a Class D amplifier need only act as controlled switches, and need not have particularly linear response to the control input. Bipolar transistors or field effect transistors are usually used. Vacuum tubes can be used as power switching devices in Class-D power audio amplifiers. Rampin M., 2015. AmpDiVa White Paper - On the use of vacuum tubes as switching devices in Class-D power audio amplifiers Error control The actual output of the amplifier is not just dependent on the content of the modulated PWM signal. The power supply voltage directly amplitude-modulates the output voltage, dead time errors make the output impedance non-linear and the output filter has a strongly load-dependent frequency response. An effective way to combat errors, regardless of their source, is negative feedback. A feedback loop including the output stage can be made using a simple integrator. To include the output filter, a PID controller is used, sometimes with additional integrating terms. The need to feed the actual output signal back into the modulator makes the direct generation of PWM from a SPDIF source unattractive.Putzeys et al. All Amplifiers etc., Presented at the AES 120th convention Mitigating the same issues in an amplifier without feedback requires addressing each separately at the source. Power supply modulation can be partially canceled by measuring the supply voltage to adjust signal gain before calculating the PWMBoudreaux, Randy, Real-Time Power Supply Feedback Reduces Power Conversion Requirements For Digital Class D Amplifiers and distortion can be reduced by switching faster. The output impedance cannot be controlled other than through feedback. Advantages The major advantage of a class-D amplifier is that it can be more efficient than a linear amplifier, with less power dissipated as heat in the active devices. Given that large heat sinks are not required, Class-D amplifiers are much lighter weight than class A, B, or AB amplifiers, an important consideration with portable sound reinforcement system equipment and bass amplifiers. Output stages such as those used in pulse generators are examples of class-D amplifiers. However, the term mostly applies to power amplifiers intended to reproduce audio signals with a bandwidth well below the switching frequency. Boss Audio mono amp. The output stage is top left, the output chokes are the two yellow toroids underneath. Uses * Home theater in a box systems. These economical home cinema systems are almost universally equipped with class-D amplifiers. On account of modest performance requirements and straightforward design, direct conversion from digital audio to PWM without feedback is most common. * Mobile phones. The internal loudspeaker is driven by up to 1 W. Class D is used to preserve battery lifetime. * Hearing aids. The miniature loudspeaker (known as the receiver) is directly driven by a class-D amplifier to maximise battery life and can provide saturation levels of 130 dB SPL or more. * Powered speakers * High-end audio is generally conservative with regards to adopting new technologies but class-D amplifiers have made an appearance * Active subwoofers * Sound reinforcement systems.

In addition to extended study abroad, he held an A. B. degree and an honorary A. M. degree conferred by Princeton University. Colonel Jones was for 14 years the directing head of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey (USC&GS;) and in that capacity used his talent and energy to promote scientific work and investigation. Much of the increased activity and interest in hydrography, geodesy, seismology, and terrestrial magnetism may be traced directly to his influence. Colonel Jones had a long and notable career. Early in his Washington experience, he achieved recognition through his leadership in the settling of the boundary dispute between the United States and Canada, concerning Alaska (See Alaska Boundary Dispute). He was appointed head of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1915. In addition to his work with that body, he was a member of a number of important government and scientific missions. He served as a delegate to the International Geographic Survey of 1928, at Cambridge, England, where he delivered an address that was translated into many languages and printed in periodicals all over the world. Colonel Jones inaugurated the movement that eventually ended in the organization of the American Legion. He was its first post and first department commander and was also instrumental in the formation of the Legion abroad. Through his influence in its work, he secured positions for thousands of veterans of the World War I. Colonel Jones was an enthusiastic member of the Society of American Military Engineers, and rendered valuable services both to the Washington post and to the national organization. He served as Vice-President of the Post in 1924, and as a member of the Board of Directors of the National Society in 1925, 1926, and 1928. Career Ernest Lester Jones, the son of Charles Hopkins and Ida (Lester) Jones was born in East Orange, New Jersey on April 14, 1876, and was a descendant of Mayflower passenger William Brewster. He received his educational training at the High School in Orange, New Jersey and at Newark Academy. Later he matriculated to Princeton University in the Class 1898, from which institution he received the Bachelor of Arts Degree. On September 28, 1897, he was married to Virginia Brent Fox, of Louisville, Kentucky. Following the completion of his studies at Princeton University, Mr. Jones was engaged in research, secretarial work, and business for a number of years. Early in 1913 he entered the service of the United States Government. President Wilson having appointed him Deputy Commissioner of the United States Bureau of Fisheries. He remained in this position until April 14, 1915, when he became Superintendent (title changed to Director in 1919) of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, which position he held until his death. During his residence in Washington, D.C., Colonel Jones served in the District of Columbia Militia, from Private to Major. During a portion of 1918 and 1919 he was on furlough from the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and was commissioned a Lieutenant-Colonel, U.S. Signal Corps. Later, he became Colonel, Division of Military Aeronautics, and served with the American forces in France in World War I. For exceptional services during the war period he was decorated by the King of Italy as Officer of the Order of S.S. Maurizio and Lazzaro, and Fatigue de Guerre (Italy); he was also an Officer of the Legion of Honor (France). Immediately following the cessation of the war, when men's minds everywhere were turned toward matters of rehabilitation, Colonel Jones was among the first to consider the welfare of those who had been at the battle front in Europe and thus it came about that he was the organizer of the first post of the American Legion (George Washington Post, Washington, D.C.), and also an organizer and incorporator of the National Legion. As the efficient administrator of a Federal Bureau, Colonel Jones early came to see the need for better conditions and more adequate salaries for employees in the Federal Service, and his advocacy of their cause in bringing these urgent needs to the attention of the proper authorities had an important part in securing remedial legislation. The great improvement in the efficiency of the personnel of the Federal Service, as a result of this legislation, has amply justified the wisdom of his efforts. It was a part of his philosophy of human affairs that the best work can be done only when men have the best tools and appliances for doing it and so it was among his basic endeavors while Director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey that the Bureau's engineers be supplied with adequate ships and modern instruments and equipment. These things he achieved in a large measure, the good effects of which are reflected in a larger and better volume of work and a finer spirit of performance by the entire personnel, so that the Bureau now meets the purposes of its being with a growing satisfaction and increased efficiency. Throughout his administration of the Bureau, Colonel Jones exemplified high executive ability. He was outstanding in his loyalty to the work of the organization and to his associates and subordinates, and in turn he engendered in them such sentiments toward himself. He worked constantly for the improvement of the Service under his direction so that the public might thereby be better served. He was positive in responding personally to whatever seemed necessary to advance each class of work and always cooperated with those of his associates who were making progress. He spared himself no amount of effort and toil to attain the things he thought were right and needful to be done. He had a humane and sincere sympathy for all who requested his assistance. Although firm in his opinions, yet he was considerate of the views of others. He was loyal alike to those whom he served and to those who served under him, and also to his own promises and obligations in that he gave the best that was in him in all his endeavors. In addition to his duties as Director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, Colonel Jones was also Commissioner of the International Boundary between the United States and Canada and Alaska and Canada, from February 1921 until his death. He was a member of the Aerial Patrol Commission of the United States, and a member of a number of Government and scientific missions, one of the last of which was a delegate to the International Geographic Congress in Cambridge, England in 1928. His death was attributed to the effects of his war service as a colonel in the division of military aeronautics in France and Italy (where he was decorated by King Victor Emanuel). He was badly gassed and had been receiving treatment for the last 10 years of his life. Memberships Colonel Jones was a member of a large number of organizations and societies, which included scientific, engineering, social, patriotic, and outdoor recreations purposes, showing thereby a wide range of active human interest of usefulness. Among the organizations of which he was an active member may be mentioned in the Washington Academy of Sciences; the Philosophical Society of Washington; the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Washington Society of Engineers; the National Geographic Society; the Meteorological Society; the American Fisheries Society; the National Association of Audubon Societies; the Society of American Military Engineers; the Military Order of the World War; and the General Society of Mayflower Descendants. Colonel Jones was elected an Associate Member of the American Society of Civil Engineers on April 3, 1922, and a member on October 12, 1925. His membership in various clubs and civic organizations, also eloquent evidence of his wide interest in his fellow man, included the National Press Club, the Explorers Club (New York), the Aero Club of America, and Cosmos Club, and the Federal Club. Works He was the author of the following Government publications: \\"Alaska Investigations,\\" \\"Hypsometry,\\" Elements of Chart Making,\\" Safeguard the Gateways of Alaska,\\" Earthquake Investigations in the United States,\\" and The Neglected Waters of the Pacific.\\" In addition, he also was the author of the following (unofficial) papers: \\"Evolution of the National Chart,\\" Science and the Earthquake Perils,\\" and \\"Aerial Surveying.\\" Honorary degree In 1919, he was granted the honorary degree of Master of Arts from Princeton University with the following citation: \\"Ernest Lester Jones, Director, United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, the oldest scientific agency of our Government, writer on our coastal waterways bordering the Pacific Ocean, a resourceful administrator, increasing largely our supply of reliable maps and supervising the use of new devices for making our waters safer, notably by detecting the perilous submerged pinnacle rocks; a Colonel in the Army during the war, on active service in France and Italy, decorated by the King of Italy, awarded the Diploma of Merit by the Aerial League of America, recommended for the French Croix de Guerre; most recently instrumental in helping to form the American Legion to perpetuate American Liberty.\\" Commemoration The United States Coast and Geodetic Survey auxiliary survey vessel USC&GS; Lester Jones (ASV-79), in service from 1940 to 1967, was named for Jones.NOAA History – Tools of the Trade/Ships/C&GS Ships/LESTER JONES at www.history.noaa.gov Notes Sources Category:1876 births Category:1929 deaths Category:Princeton University alumni Category:American geodesists Category:People from East Orange, New Jersey Category:United States Coast and Geodetic Survey personnel Category:Cosmos Club members Category:Mathematicians from New Jersey Category:Military personnel from New Jersey ","title":"Ernest Lester Jones"},{"id":"2166812","text":"Wayne Gould (高樂德法官) (born 3 July 1945 in Hawera, New Zealand) is a retired Hong Kong judge, most recently known for helping to popularise sudoku puzzles in the United Kingdom, and thereafter in the United States.

It was opened by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) in 1860 and is now operated by South Western Railway which provides services on the West of England Main Line. It is down the line from . History The station was opened by the LSWR on 19 July 1860, along with its Exeter Extension from to Exeter Queen Street. The station was designed by William Tite with the main building on the westbound platform, even though this is the side furthest from the town centre. The station was on an embankment on the west side of New Street and the goods yard with a small goods shed was on the south side beyond the station building. Further sidings were provided on the north side of the line opposite the main goods yard. Goods facilities were withdrawn on 8 May 1967. In August 2009, a new footbridge was erected at Honiton Railway Station replacing an older footbridge. The location of the footbridge moved towards the Exeter end of the station. It was announced in early December 2010 that Honiton Railway Station was to undergo a phase of several improvements. This phase of £1.4 million improvements set out to provide the station with a brighter enlarged booking hall, new toilets and changing facilities; and also a retail unit. In addition, both platforms were fitted with accessible ramps along with a new waiting shelter to make it easier for all passengers to use the station. The project, funded by South West Trains, Devon County Council, Network Rail and the National Station Improvement Programme has made the station more accessible. As part of South West Trains’ commitment to deliver greener travel, the station was also equipped with shelters, additional CCTV and 1000 new bicycle spaces. Work on the improvement scheme started in early December 2010 and the completed refurbishment was officially unveiled on Thursday 23 June 2011. To mark the completion, Andy Pitt, Managing Director for South West Trains along with Councillor Stuart Hughes from Devon County Council gathered at the station for a photo and unveiling. Roundball Halt There was, for a few years, a second station in Honiton. It was opened in September 1906 about half a mile from the town station to allow soldiers to reach a rifle range at Roundball Hill, south west of the town centre. It was never advertised in timetables and was demolished early in 1921. Signalling The 1957 signal box which has since been demolished. A signal box was built in 1875 at the Exeter end of the station on the south side of the line. This was replaced by a new building on 16 June 1957 which was on the opposite side of the tracks. On 11 June 1967 the line from to was reduced to a single track but a loop line was retained at Honiton to allow trains to pass midway on this section. The westbound platform was signalled to allow eastbound trains to use it when they are not crossing a train coming in the opposite direction. In December 2009 a new loop was installed at Axminster to break up the section towards Chard. One siding was retained to the west of the signal box, worked by a ground frame rather than from the signal box itself, however this has now also been lifted. Another signal box was provided at Honiton Incline. This was situated on the north side of the line beyond the Honiton Tunnel. The line climbs from towards Honiton at 1 in 100 (1%) and then continues up to the tunnel mouth a slightly steeper gradients, it then drops at 1 in 80 (1.25%) down to the former . In 2012 signalling for the Salisbury- Exeter line transferred to the new signalling centre at Basingstoke. Signals previously controlled by Gillingham, Templecombe, Yeovil Junction and Honiton boxes all now have the prefix SE. Description A modern station building stands on the main platform which is on the southern side of the line. A footbridge to the west of this links the northern platform which has a small waiting shelter. The signal box is at the Exeter end of this platform and the main station car park is situated behind this, however the 1957 signal box closed and was knocked down in late spring of 2012. Honiton Railway Station has recently seen a refurbishment, providing a new booking hall, more CCTV, shelters and increased accessibility. Work was completed on Thursday 23 June 2011.

The story centers on two con artists who meet and decide to cooperate in a major scam. The film was nominated for 28 awards and won 21 of them, and is now considered a classic in Argentine film history. Plot At a convenience store early in the morning, Juan (Gastón Pauls), a con artist, successfully scams the cashier, and attempts the same scam again on the very next shift. Marcos (Ricardo Darín), who has been observing him, pretends to be a police officer and takes Juan away. As soon as they are far enough, Marcos reveals he is a fellow con man. Juan asks Marcos to teach him his ways, because his father, who is also a con man, is in jail and he needs to raise money quickly in order to bribe a judge into reducing his father's sentence from ten years to six months. Soon after, an elaborated scheme seemingly falls into their laps: Sandler (Oscar Nuñez), a former business associate of Marcos, needs his help to sell counterfeit copies he made of some rare stamps called \\"The Nine Queens\\". The potential mark is Gandolfo (Ignasi Abadal), a rich Spaniard facing deportation and desperate to smuggle his wealth out of the country. Gandolfo has no time to fully check if the stamps are authentic but he hires an expert (Leo Dyzen) to do a quick check and is satisfied. He offers $450,000 for the stamps, with the exchange agreed to take place that evening. In the intervening time, the stamp expert demands a cut from Juan and Marcos, as he knows the stamps were forged. The fake stamps are then stolen out of Juan and Marcos' hands by thieves on motorcycles who, unaware of their value, toss them into a river. To salvage the scheme, Marcos approaches Sandler's widowed sister Berta (Elsa Berenguer), the owner of the real stamps, who agrees to sell them for $250,000. Marcos can put up $200,000 and asks Juan to contribute the remaining $50,000. Juan becomes suspicious since Marcos seems to need exactly the amount that Juan has saved up, but as the $50,000 is not enough to help his father, Juan reluctantly agrees. They buy the real stamps and go to Gandolfo's hotel, but he says he has changed his mind and will now only buy the stamps if he also gets to sleep with Marcos' sister Valeria (Leticia Brédice), a hotel employee. Valeria's price is that Marcos must confess to their younger brother Federico (Tomás Fonzi) how Marcos cheated him out of their family inheritance in Italy. After he does so, Valeria spends the night with Gandolfo, who pays for the stamps with a certified check the next morning. Juan and Marcos rush to bank, but learn it has crashed, making the check worthless. A disillusioned Juan walks away as Marcos gets back into the bank. In the final scene, Juan arrives at a warehouse, where he greets the motorcycle thieves, Gandolfo, Sandler and his sister Berta, and his fiancée Valeria – revealing that the real con was to swindle Marcos out of $200,000 as revenge for all the times he cheated his family and his partners.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 92% approval rating based on 95 reviews, with an average rating of 7.45/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Deliciously twist-filled, Nine Queens is a clever and satisfying crime caper.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 80/100 based on 30 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Roger Ebert, in his review of Nine Queens for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film a score of three out of four stars, commending its screenplay and calling the film \\"an elegant and sly deadpan comedy.\\" Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune awarded the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, and called it \\"One of the most clever, most enjoyable thrillers in years.\\" Orlando Sentinel film critic Roger Moore gave the film four stars out of five, writing, \\"the laughs are dark, the puzzle steadily more engrossing and the surprises, just like Heist, are doozies, up to the finale.\\" Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle also gave the film a positive review, writing: \\"Fast-paced and unerringly surprising, Nine Queens is nicely performed by a large cast [...] David Mamet plowed this con-the-con turf in Heist, House of Games and The Spanish Prisoner, but Bielinsky, in his directing debut, makes it seem sassy and reinvented.\\" Geoff Pevere of The Toronto Star wrote in his review of the film: \\"If Nine Queens draws you on a journey that eventually leads up a garden path toward your own suckerhood, it's all the more pleasurable for having done so with such slick expertise.\\" BBC film critic Tom Dawson called the film \\"a welcome addition to the genre\\" and a \\"taut thriller a powerful allegorical resonance.\\" Awards Wins * Argentine Film Critics Association Awards: Silver Condor; Best Actor, Ricardo Darín; Best Cinematography, Marcelo Camorino; Best Director, Fabián Bielinsky; Best Editing, Sergio Zottola; Best Film; Best Original Screenplay, Fabián Bielinsky; Best Supporting Actress, Elsa Berenguer; 2001. * Biarritz International Festival of Latin American Cinema: Best Actor, (tie) Ricardo Darín and Gastón Pauls; for Nueve reinas; 2001. * Bogotá Film Festival: Audience Award, Fabián Bielinsky; Golden Precolumbian Circle, Best Director, Fabián Bielinsky; 2001. * Lima Latin American Film Festival: Elcine First Prize, Fabián Bielinsky; 2001. * Lleida Latin-American Film Festival: Audience Award, Fabián Bielinsky; Best Director, Fabián Bielinsky; 2001. * Oslo Films from the South Festival: Audience Award, Fabián Bielinsky; 2001. * Cognac Festival du Film Policier: Grand Prix, Fabián Bielinsky; Premiere Award, Fabián Bielinsky; 2002. * Fantasporto: Directors' Week Award, Best Screenplay, Fabián Bielinsky; 2002. * Portland International Film Festival: Audience Award Best First Film, Fabián Bielinsky; 2002. * Sant Jordi Awards: Best Foreign Actor, Ricardo Darín.

(株式会社デジキューブ; Kabushiki-gaisha Dejikyūbu) was a Japanese company established as a subsidiary of software developer Square on February 6, 1996 and headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. The primary purpose of DigiCube was to market and distribute Square products, most notably video games and related merchandise, including toys, books, and music soundtracks. DigiCube served as a wholesaler to distributors, and was noteworthy for pioneering the sale of video games in Japanese convenience stores and vending machine kiosks. History At its peak in 1998, DigiCube recorded sales of 8.6 million units, equaling ¥46.8 billion JPY. On February 2, 2000, Digicube announced it would start carrying the PlayStation 2 the following month, and expected sales of 100,000 consoles and 400,000 games. By May 2000, the company offered thirty- one software titles from fourteen different companies. In February 2001, after a thaw in relations between Nintendo and Square, Digicube began distributing Game Boy games for the first time. In the following years; however, sales declined precipitously. Although ownership of DigiCube was passed to the newly created Square Enix following the merger of Square with its former rival Enix in early 2003, it was already approximately 9.5 billion yen in debt. Following the announcement that the much-anticipated Final Fantasy XII would be delayed until sometime in 2004 (eventually released in 2006), DigiCube filed for bankruptcy liquidation at the Tokyo District Court on November 26, 2003. The bankruptcy would cost the newly merged Square Enix ¥760 million JPY. The bankruptcy also caused a 3.6% drop in Square Enix’s stock with the announcement, and other Japanese stocks were affected. Releases =Music= Starting with Tobal No. 1 Original Sound Track in 1996, DigiCube published soundtracks of Square and Square Enix video games, as well as a few soundtracks of video games from other companies and a few non-video game- related albums. The last release was Piano Collections: Final Fantasy VII in 2003. The planned release of Front Mission 4 Plus 1st Original Soundtrack was cancelled following DigiCube's demise, although it and most of DigiCube's catalog was eventually re-printed by Square Enix. Digicube released 80 video game soundtrack albums during its existence, generally from games developed or published by Square/Square Enix, as well as 8 other albums. =Perfect Works= Perfect Works is a series of video game-related books published by DigiCube. Only three books were published: the first was dedicated to Xenogears and printed in October 1998 in Japan. One book dedicated to SaGa Frontier 2 and another one dedicated to Front Mission 3 were released in 1999. These books contain artwork, timelines and detailed descriptions of events of the related games. The Xenogears Perfect Works notably contains detailed information of the world where the game is set, giving indepth descriptions of the characters, creatures, geographical and historical settings, covering all the intended six episodes of Xenogears. =Ultimania= The Final Fantasy XII Scenario Ultimania is a series of video game books originally published in Japan by DigiCube and written by Studio BentStuff. Although they are primarily known as a resource for the Final Fantasy series, there have also been Ultimania guides published for several other Square Enix titles, including the SaGa series, Legend of Mana, Chrono Cross, Vagrant Story and the Kingdom Hearts series. In addition to providing information on how to complete their respective games, the guides primarily focus on commentary from the staff, original art designs and extended information about the game's storyline and characters. After DigiCube's bankruptcy, Square Enix has published the books directly.

Mookini means \\"many lineages\\" or \\"many Moo\\" in the Hawaiian Language.lookup of Mookini on Hawaiian place names web site Moo are large reptile goddesses honored by Hawaiians since before the time of Paao. This heiau is a living spiritual temple and not just an historic artifact of the Hawaiian culture. Oral histories indicate the original temple on the site may be 1500 years old: the genealogy chant of the heiau's kahuna tells of Kuamo'o Mo'okini arriving here in 480, not from Samoa or Tahiti, but from the Persian Gulf of Middle East.Allan Seiden, in Cooperation with Momi Mo'okini Lum, \\"Mookini Luakini Heiau, A Living Part of Hawai'i's Spiritual Heritage\\" (Honolulu: Legacy Archive Press, 2014), Chapter 2Leimomi Mo'okini Lum, \\"The Legend of Kuamo'o Mo'okini and Hamumu, the Great Whale\\" (Honolulu: Bishop Museum Press, 2004) Evidence suggests the current temple was built on the site of this smaller older one by Paao, who brought the Hawaiian Religion to the islands sometime between 1100 and 1300 A.D. The current site includes the remains of the heiau measuring 250' x 130' with an open stone paved court enclosed by 20'-high stone walls, and the sacrificial stone. The heiau is constructed of stones that are said to have been passed from hand to hand from the Pololū Valley, over away. One tradition states that the heiau was completed by the menehune (mythical Hawai'ian little people) in one night.All about Hawaii, published by Honolulu Star-Bulletin, 1891, page 117 Google Books For centuries a strict set of rules (kapu) were enforced at the heiau. It was a closed heiau reserved exclusively for the Alii Nui (the highest chiefs) for praying and offering human sacrifices, primarily to the war god Kū. In Kohala Mookini Heiau was the focus of religious life and order. In November 1978 Kahuna Nui Leimomi Mookini Lum rededicated the Mookini Luakini to the \\"Children of the Land\\" (kama aina) and lifted the restrictive kapu. In doing this she made the site safe for all persons to enter the heiau and created a place of learning for future generations to discover the past. Her family has been taking care of the temple for centuries. A few hundred yards away is Kamehameha Akahi ʻĀina Hānau, the birthplace of Kamehameha the Great. He is said to have been born here in 1758 as Halley's Comet passed overhead. The entrance to the site is on the south side.

He also used the pen name \\"Amoy Ku\\". Life Gu Hongming was born in Penang, British Malaya (present day Malaysia), the second son of a Chinese rubber plantation superintendent, whose ancestral hometown was Tong'an, Fujian province, China, and his Portuguese wife. The British plantation owner was fond of Gu and took him, at age ten, to Scotland for his education. He was then known as Koh Hong Beng (the Min Nan pronunciation of his name). In 1873 he began studying Literature at the University of Edinburgh, graduating in the spring of 1877 with an M.A. He then earned a diploma in Civil Engineering at the University of Leipzig, and studied law in Paris. Gu Hongming (1857–1928) in his old age. He returned to Penang in 1880, and soon joined the colonial Singapore civil service, where he worked until 1883. He went to China in 1885, and served as an advisor to the ranking official Zhang Zhidong for twenty years. Leo Tolstoy, whom he had befriended, and Gu were both opposed to the Hundred Days' Reform, which was led by prominent reformist intellectuals of the time, including Kang Youwei.Lee 2005, p. 10. From 1905 to 1908, he was the director of the Huangpu River Authority (上海浚治黃浦江河道局) in Shanghai. He served in the Imperial Foreign Ministry from 1908 to 1910, then as the president of the Nanyang Public School, the forerunner of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. He resigned the latter post in 1911 as a sign of his loyalty to the fallen imperial Qing government. In 1915, he became a professor at Peking University. Beginning in 1924 he lived in Japan and Japanese-administered Taiwan for three years as a guest lecturer in Oriental cultures. Then he returned to live in Beijing until his death on 30 April 1928 at the age of 72. An advocate of monarchy and Confucian values, preserving his queue even after the overthrow of Qing Dynasty, Gu became a kind of cultural curiosity late in his life. In 1934, writer Wen Yuan-ning wrote: \\"That ostentatious display of his queue is very symptomatic of the whole man. He is cross-grained: he lives by opposition.\\"\\"The Late Mr. Ku Hung-Ming,\\" in Wen Yuan-ning, and others, \\"Imperfect Understanding: Intimate Portraits of Modern Chinese Celebrities,\\" edited by Christopher Rea (Amherst, MA: Cambria Press, 2018), p. 72. Many sayings and anecdotes have been attributed to him, few of which can be attested. Literary figures as diverse as Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, Somerset Maugham and Rabindranath Tagore were all drawn to visit him when they were in China. No scholarly edition of his complete works is available. He was fluent in English, Chinese, German, Russian and French, and understood Italian, Ancient Greek, Latin, Japanese and Malay. He acquired Chinese only after his studies in Europe, and was said to have a bad Chinese hand-writing. However, his command of the language is far above average. He penned several Chinese books, including a vivid memoir recollecting his days as an assistant for Zhang Zhidong. His character appeared in the drama \\"Towards the Republic\\".

Early life, education and career Abdallah ibn Yasin was from the tribe of the Jazulah (pronounced Guezula), a Sanhaja sub-tribe from the Sous. He was a Maliki theologian, he was a disciple of Waggag ibn Zallu al-Lamti and studied in his Ribat, \\"Dar al-Murabitin\\" which was located in the village of Aglu, (near present-day Tiznit). In 1046 the Gudala chief Yahya Ibn Ibrahim, came to the Ribat asking for someone to promulgate Islamic religious teachings amongst the Berber of the Adrar (present-day Mauritania) and Waggag ibn Zallu chose to send Abdallah ibn Yasin with him. The Sanhaja were at this stage only superficially Islamicised and still clung to many heathen practices, and so Ibn Yasin preached to them an orthodox Sunnism. After a revolt of the Godala he was forced to withdraw with his followers. In alliance with Yahya ibn Umar, the leader of the Lamtuna tribe, he managed to quell the rebellion. Ibn Yasin now formed the Almoravid alliance from the tribes of the Lamtuna, the Masufa and the Godala, with himself as spiritual leader and Yahya ibn Umar taking the military command. In 1054 the Maghrawa-ruled Sijilmasa was conquered. Ibn Yasin introduced his orthodox rule - amongst other things wine and music were forbidden, non- Islamic taxes were abolished and one fifth of the spoils of war were allocated to the religious experts. This rigorous application of Islam soon provoked a revolt in 1055. Death Yahya ibn Umar was killed in 1056 in a renewed revolt of the Gudala in the Sahara, upon which Ibn Yasin appointed Yahya's brother Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar (1056–1087) the new military leader. Abu Bakr destroyed Sijilmasa, but was not able to force the Gudala back into the Almoravid league. He went on to capture Sūs and its capital Aghmat (close to where is now Marrakech) in 1058. Ibn Yasin died while attempting to subjugate the Barghawata on the Atlantic coast in 1059. He is replaced by Sulaiman ibn Haddu, who, killed in turn, will not be replaced.Abdallah Laroui, L'histoire du Maghreb, 1982, p.151, .

The story describes a German invasion of British India and the reaction of the Nazi occupation authorities to the nonviolent resistance and pacifism of Mahatma Gandhi and his followers. This story was later reprinted in Turtledove's short-story collection Kaleidoscope in 1990, and the variety showcase The Best Military Science Fiction of the Twentieth Century in 2001. Plot summary Germany's success in World War II has led to their invasion of the British Raj in 1947, resulting in the British Indian Army being decisively defeated. Rather than struggling for independence from the Crown, Gandhi and his friend Jawaharlal Nehru find themselves in the position of resisting Nazi occupation using the techniques that were successfully employed against the British. Although Nehru has a general concept of the inherently immoral nature of Nazi ideology, Gandhi thinks they still can be persuaded, not heeding the warning from an Austrian Jew named Simon Wiesenthal, who was able to flee occupied Poland to India. The Nazis, however, led by Field Marshal Walther Model, are completely unmoved by Gandhi's strategy. They view themselves as a master race and have no moral qualms about killing those who resist non-violently (or even those who do not resist at all, if they are of a certain race). In the end the movement collapses as it proves unable to deal with the savagery of Nazism. Themes Gandhi assumes a moral equivalence between the Nazi and British imperialists, naively dismissing reports otherwise; the story makes clear that this is a lethal mistake stemming from Gandhi's reluctance to entertain the idea that his moral and ethical assumptions are not shared in common among all human groups. Loyalty is explored as a powerful but amoral force. Gandhi is loyal to his concepts of passive resistance, however poorly they fit the situation or inevitably they lead to violence; the Indians are loyal to Gandhi, and some die for it; Model is loyal is to his rank and volk; the British are loyal to their ideas of decency and mercy and defend them to the last, through the medium of war. The story illustrates the weakness inherent in Gandhi'sand later Martin Luther King Jr.'snonviolence movement, the success of which depends on a reasoned appeal to the enemy's conscience—that is, on the ability to arouse shame and remorse in the oppressor, who eventually relents. This was a plausible strategy against British imperialism or American institutional racism, as the notion of oppression clashes unpleasantly with the values espoused by these nations. Historically, ideals of freedom, justice, and equality for all citizens are at the root of the British and American political system and, perhaps more important, the religion and national self-image of the people. The story explores the strategic difference between opposing a tolerant competitor, such as the British, and opposing a remorselessly violent foe, suggesting that violent resistance to malign forces like Nazism, such as the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, is more likely to succeed than a pacifistic approach. Violence does not guarantee success, however; the Warsaw uprising is indicated as a failure. Field Marshal Model compares the Nazi empire with the Roman Empire facing the early Christians, pointing out that Rome's collapse came as a result of its tolerance of a force that sought to undermine it. The story does not characterize Model as a bloodthirsty savage; rather, he is a merely a professional doing his job. Turtledove provides an appearance by Jurgen Stroop, the SS officer responsible for the Warsaw Ghetto massacre, to contrast Stroop's mindless savagery and Model's workmanlike, impassive decimation of the Indian resistance. Connections to other works It has been speculated that the story takes place in the same universe as In the Presence of Mine Enemies by the same author, but he has never confirmed this.

The butterfly is also known as the common yellow swallowtail or simply the swallowtail (a common name applied to all members of the family, but this species was the first to be given the name). It is the type species of the genus Papilio. This widespread species is found in much of the Palearctic (it is the only swallowtail in most of Europe) and in North America. Etymology Named for Machaon (ancient Greek: Μαχάων) a figure in Greek mythology. He was a son of Asclepius. Taxonomy Papilio machaon was named by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae in 1758, alongside nearly 200 other species of butterfly. Later, Pierre André Latreille designated it as the type species of the genus Papilio. Papilio appalachiensis and Papilio xuthus are also of the same genus. The specific epithet ' refers to Machaon, son of Asclepius in the works of Homer. Subspecies There are 41 recognized subspecies, that include: Trailing edges of the hindwings resemble the tails of swallows * P. m. aliaska Scudder, 1869 (Chukot Peninsula, Alaska to northern British Columbia) * P. m. annae Gistel, 1857 * P. m. archias Fruhstorfer, 1907 (southern Sichuan) * P. m. asiaticus Ménétriés, 1855 * P. m. baijangensis Huang & Murayama, 1992 (China: Xinjiang) * P. m. bairdii Edwards, 1866 (Nevada to Kansas, Arizona, Colorado) * P. m. birmanicus Rothschild, 1908 (southern Shan States) * P. m. britannicus (Seitz, 1907) (Great Britain) * P. m. brucei Edwards, 1893 (Alberta, Saskatchewan to Nebraska, Utah) * P. m. centralis Staudinger, 1886 (Turan, western Tian-Shan, Ghissar, Darvaz, Alai, western Pamirs) * P. m. chinensis Verity, 1905 (Sichuan) * P. m. gorganus Fruhstorfer, 1922 (southern Europe, Ural, Caucasus Major) * P. m. hippocrates C. & R.

In Asia, it is reported as far south as Saudi Arabia, Oman, the high mountains of Yemen, Lebanon, Iran and Israel. In southern Asia, it occurs in Pakistan and Kashmir, northern India (Sikkim, to Assam, and Arunachal Pradesh), Nepal, Bhutan, and northern Myanmar. This butterfly is widespread in Europe. In the United Kingdom, it is limited to a few areas in the Norfolk Broads of East Anglia. It is the UK's largest resident butterfly. The monarch (Danaus plexippus) is slightly larger, but is only a rare vagrant. As P. machaon is widespread throughout Eurasia and often common, it is not threatened as a species. It is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" in the South Korean and Austrian Red Data Books, and in the Red Data Book of the former Soviet Union. In Armenia the species demonstrates stable population trend and is assessed as Least Concern. In some countries, P. machaon and its subspecies are protected by law. Papilio machaon machaon is protected by law in six provinces of Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova. The species is protected in the United Kingdom, and subspecies verityi is protected in India. Description The imago typically has yellow wings with black vein markings, and a wingspan of . The hindwings of both sexes have a pair of protruding tails which give the butterfly its common name from the resemblance to the birds of the same name. Just below each tail is one red and six blue eye spots. In the caterpillar stage, P. machaon has a length of . When young, the caterpillar resembles a bird dropping, giving it camouflage. The caterpillar also protects itself using a large orange fork which protrudes behind its head. It can be distinguished from Papilio hospiton, which occurs sympatrically with it on Corsica and Sardinia, by the longer \\"tails\\" on the hindwings. It can be told apart from the Algerian species Papilio saharae only by counting the segments on the antennae. File:Papilio machaon MHNT CUT 2013 3 11 Cahors Female.jpgTop (L) and bottom (R) sides, male (MHNT) Ecology Caterpillar on wild carrot The butterfly has a strong and fast flight, but frequently pauses to hover over flowering herbs and sip nectar. It frequents alpine meadows and hillsides, and males are fond of 'hilltopping', congregating near summits to compete for passing females. At lower elevations, it can be seen visiting gardens. Unlike other swallowtails which specialise on Rutaceae, this species mostly feeds on plants of family Umbelliferae, females laying eggs singly. Milk parsley (also known as marsh hog's fennel) is normally the only food plant used by the caterpillars of the British subspecies. The food plants of the swallowtail in Europe, Asia, and North America are more varied than in the UK. It uses a wide variety of umbellifers including wild carrot (Daucus carota), wild angelica (Angelica sylvestris), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), and hogweeds (Heracleum). In the Maltese Islands, the caterpillar feeds on plants such as rue (Ruta chalepensis) in addition to Umbelliferae such as fennel. In Kashmir, the common yellow swallowtail, as Papilio machaon is called there, inhabits alpine meadows in the Himalayas occurring from in Kashmir valley to in the Garhwal Himalayas. In India, in Himachal Pradesh, it is found over only and in Sikkim over only. At lower elevations, these butterflies fly from March to September; at higher elevations, they are limited by the short summer seasons. The British subspecies P. m. brittanicus is less mobile than its European continental counterpart and stays within, or close by, its fenland habitat. Life cycle There are usually two to three broods in a year, but in northern areas, the species may be univoltine. In some places such as the UK, some will pupate and emerge in the same year and others will overwinter as pupae before emerging the following year, a situation known as being partially bivoltine. The caterpillar spends the first part of its life with the appearance of a bird dropping, an effective defense against predators. As the caterpillar grows larger, it becomes green with black and orange markings. It has a defense against predators in the form of an osmeterium, which consists of retractable, fleshy projections behind its head that can release a foul smell if disturbed, which deters insects, but not birds. Breeding Old World swallowtails can easily be bred in captivity. Butterflies can be lured to lay eggs in a backyard garden by keeping plenty of caterpillar food plants in it. Common rue plants are highly appropriate for this. Movie of Papilio machaon caterpillar Once eggs or young caterpillars have been collected, they can be kept in a pot with holes on its top to allow air circulation. More than one caterpillar may be kept in a single pot since they do not attack each other (although they might sometimes get frightened by other caterpillars moving). They can be fed any of their food plants. Fennel is one of the easiest to find in the wild. Care must be taken with fennel as well as dill, though, because they will not eat hard, woody stems; they need to be fed the tender leaves. They can also be fed rue or milk parsley. Feeding them with unsuitable plants will lead to death from starvation. Caterpillars are very fast eaters; they will spend their time eating or resting before they resume their eating again. Once a sufficient size has been attained, they will attach themselves to any available structure with their silky threads. They will then stay still until they become pupae. This will take about a day. Once in the pupa stage, they can be very carefully removed from the pot and placed in a warm location. The time the butterfly takes to form and come out depends on the temperature. If kept in warm summer temperatures, it will take about one or two weeks to form. On the other hand, if the temperature is lower, it might take as long as several months until it feels the weather is warm enough. Pupae should not be kept on an impermeable surface, since when they eclose a bit of liquid will be released, this means the butterfly would stay wet and might not be able to fly. Absorbing paper such as the one used in kitchens is advisable.

In physics, a Fano resonance is a type of resonant scattering phenomenon that gives rise to an asymmetric line-shape. Interference between a background and a resonant scattering process produces the asymmetric line-shape. It is named after Italian-American physicist Ugo Fano, who in 1961 gave a theoretical explanation for the scattering line-shape of inelastic scattering of electrons from helium;\\" A. Bianconi Ugo Fano and shape resonances in X-ray and Inner Shell Processes\\" AIP Conference Proceedings (2002): (19th Int. Conference Roma June 24–28, 2002) A. Bianconi arXiv: cond-mat/0211452 21 November 2002 however, Ettore Majorana was the first to discover this phenomenon. Because it is a general wave phenomenon, examples can be found across many areas of physics and engineering.  History  The explanation of the Fano line-shape first appeared in the context of inelastic electron scattering by helium and autoionization. The incident electron doubly excites the atom to the 2s2p state, a sort of shape resonance. The doubly excited atom spontaneously decays by ejecting one of the excited electrons. Fano showed that interference between the amplitude to simply scatter the incident electron and the amplitude to scatter via autoionization creates an asymmetric scattering line- shape around the autoionization energy with a line-width very close to the inverse of the autoionization lifetime.  Explanation  The Fano resonance line-shape is due to interference between two scattering amplitudes, one due to scattering within a continuum of states (the background process) and the second due to an excitation of a discrete state (the resonant process). The energy of the resonant state must lie in the energy range of the continuum (background) states for the effect to occur. Near the resonant energy, the background scattering amplitude typically varies slowly with energy while the resonant scattering amplitude changes both in magnitude and phase quickly. It is this variation that creates the asymmetric profile. For energies far from the resonant energy the background scattering process dominates. Within 2\\\\Gamma_\\\\mathrm{res} of the resonant energy, the phase of the resonant scattering amplitude changes by \\\\pi. It is this rapid variation in phase that creates the asymmetric line-shape. Fano showed that the total scattering cross-section \\\\sigma assumes the following form, \\\\sigma \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\left(q\\\\Gamma_\\\\mathrm{res}/2 + E - E_\\\\mathrm{res}\\\\right)^2}{\\\\left(\\\\Gamma_\\\\mathrm{res}/2\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(E-E_\\\\mathrm{res}\\\\right)^2} where \\\\Gamma_\\\\mathrm{res} describes the line width of the resonant energy and q, the Fano parameter, measures the ratio of resonant scattering to the direct (background) scattering amplitude. (This is consistent with the interpretation within the Feshbach–Fano partitioning theory.) In the case the direct scattering amplitude vanishes, the q parameter becomes zero and the Fano formula boils down to the usual Breit–Wigner (Lorentzian) formula: \\\\frac{\\\\left(E - E_\\\\mathrm{res}\\\\right)^2}{\\\\left(\\\\Gamma_\\\\mathrm{res}/2\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(E-E_\\\\mathrm{res}\\\\right)^2}  Examples  Examples of Fano resonances can be found in atomic physics, nuclear physics, condensed matter physics, electrical circuits, microwave engineering, nonlinear optics, nanophotonics, magnetic metamaterials, and in mechanical waves. Fano can be observed with photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The phenomenon can be also observed at visible frequencies using simple glass microspheres, which may allow enhancing the magnetic feld of light (which is typically small) by a few orders of magnitude.

Some commentators called the launch “Europe’s worst performing IPO of 2014”. eDreams moved quickly, asking their shareholders for authorization to “Discharge to Mr. James Otis Hare for the exercise of his mandate as director of the Company until his resignation as of 25 March, 2015.” eDreams issued the following announcement: “Effective March 25, 2015, eDreams ODIGEO (“the Company”) accepts the resignation of Mr. James Hare as an Independent member from the Board of Directors”. In June 2015, CEO Dana Dunne introduced a new strategy focusing on mobile, revenue diversification and customer experience improvements, which led to a strong turnaround in business performance.  Criticism  Opodo.com and opodo.co.uk have a “poor” rating of 2 stars out 5 on the online review platform Trustpilot, and a rating of 1.2 out of 5 on the review platform Reviewcentre. The majority of customer complaints focus on a serious lack of responsiveness from the Opodo customer care team, for instance not receiving a reply to an email in over a month, for them being \\"unreachable by phone,\\" as well as many instances in which tickets booked and confirmed through Opodo are never actually reserved with the airline.

Specifically, it aggregates multiple channels of information including voice and data across a single shared access link to a carrier or service provider PoP (Point of Presence). The access link may be a T1 line, a DSL connection, a cable (CATV) network, a broadband wireless link, or a metro-Ethernet connection. At the PoP, the customer's aggregated information is typically directed into an Add- drop multiplexer or an MSPP (multiservice provisioning platform), which are complex and expensive devices that sit between customers and the core network. They manage traffic streams coming from customers and forward those streams to the PSTN (voice) or appropriate wide area networks (ATM, frame relay, or the Internet). An IAD is sometimes installed by the service provider to which a customer wishes to connect. This allows the service provider to control the features of the access link and manage its operation during use. Competitive service providers are now offering access services over a variety of access technologies, including wireless optical (i.e., Terabeam) and metro-Ethernet networks. Old telco protocols and transport methods (T1 lines and time- division multiplexing) are replaced with access methods that are appropriate for the underlying transport. Because of this, the provider will usually specify an appropriate IAD or install an IAD. SIAD will aggregate its IP data traffic and GSM ATM traffic at the cellsite passing it along to the multi- service routers sitting in front of mobile switching center (MSC). It will aggregate the cell site traffic and forward to the MSN. An Integrated Access Device (or IAD) allows customers to continue using their legacy TDM voice equipment (PBX, Channel Bank, etc...) without the need to invest in new Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) capable equipment. This also allows customers in locations where legacy TDM services are no longer available to delay expensive equipment upgrades required to move to a pure Voice over IP (VoIP) solution. There are other cost saving benefits of moving to an Integrated Access Device (or IAD) since a Primary Rate Interface (PRI) which is typically required for Private Branch Exchange (PBX) equipment requires 23 voice (bearer) channels and 1 signaling (data) channel. By purchasing an IAD instead and connecting to a VoIP service provider, customers can purchase only the number of voice channels that are actually required at their location. Since the VoIP service allows internet access to be used for both voice and data, moving to a VoIP solution allows customers to remove the local access charges associated with the T1 local loop that was required to deliver the legacy PRI service. This allows customers to realize a significant cost savings by removing unused voice channels and access costs. Some companies estimate a 30%–75% cost savings can be realized by moving to VoIP. Another benefit in moving to a VoIP solution over TDM is that additional security can be added to the voice service since MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS or Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections can be used for voice access. This is especially important in the legal and healthcare industry where confidential information is routinely shared during phone calls. The only caveats to sharing Voice and data on the same connection are that proper Quality of Service (QoS) must be added to the circuit to ensure that the voice traffic takes priority over the data traffic and that enough bandwidth is available for the number of sessions (AKA concurrent call paths, channels, etc..) of voice service that are needed at the site. A good rule of thumb (and to make for easy math) for a home phone quality (G.711) VoIP codec is to assume 100 kbit/s per session multiplied by the number of sessions required at the location. For example 10 sessions of VoIP would require 1 Mbit/s of available bandwidth and 1 Mbit/s of premium QOS to ensure a quality call experience.

It is used to refer to a family of protocols that mediate network access. Two network protocols providing this functionality are particularly popular: the RADIUS protocol,C. Rigney, S. Willens, A. Rubens, W. Simpson, \\"Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)\\", IETF RFC 2865, June 2000. and its newer Diameter counterpart.P. Calhoun, J. Loughney, E. Guttman, G. Zorn, J. Arkko, \\"Diameter Base Protocol\\", IETF RFC 3588, September 2003.Sasu Tarkoma, \\"Mobile Middleware: Architecture, Patterns and Practice\\", John Wiley and Sons, 2009, pp. 248–251. .  Usage of AAA in Diameter  In some cases, the term AAA has been used to refer to protocol-specific information. For example, Diameter uses the URI scheme AAA, which stands for Authentication, Authorization and Accounting, and the Diameter-based Protocol AAAS, which stands for Authentication, Authorization and Accounting with Secure Transport. These protocols were defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force in RFC 6733 and are intended to provide an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) framework for applications, such as network access or IP mobility in both local and roaming situations. While the term AAA has been used in such a narrow context, the concept of AAA is more widely used within the industry. As a result, it is incorrect to refer to AAA and Diameter as being one and the same.  Usage of AAA servers in CDMA networks AAA servers in CDMA data networks are entities that provide Internet Protocol (IP) functionality to support the functions of authentication, authorization and accounting. The AAA server in the CDMA wireless data network architecture is similar to the HLR in the CDMA wireless voice network architecture. Types of AAA servers include the following: *Access Network AAA (AN-AAA): Communicates with the RNC in the Access Network (AN) to enable authentication and authorization functions to be performed at the AN. The interface between AN and AN-AAA is known as the A12 interface. *Broker AAA (B-AAA): Acts as an intermediary to proxy AAA traffic between roaming partner networks (i.e., between the H-AAA server in the home network and V-AAA server in the serving network). B-AAA servers are used in CRX networks to enable CRX providers to offer billing settlement functions. *Home AAA (H-AAA): The AAA server in the roamer’s home network. The H-AAA is similar to the HLR in voice. The H-AAA stores user profile information, responds to authentication requests, and collects accounting information. *Visited AAA (V-AAA): The AAA server in the visited network from which a roamer is receiving service. The V-AAA in the serving network communicates with the H-AAA in a roamer’s home network. Authentication requests and accounting information are forwarded by the V-AAA to the H-AAA, either directly or through a B-AAA. Current AAA servers communicate using the RADIUS protocol. As such, TIA specifications refer to AAA servers as RADIUS servers. However, future AAA servers are expected to use a successor protocol to RADIUS known as Diameter. The behavior of AAA servers (radius servers) in the CDMA2000 wireless IP network is specified in TIA-835.

It is a civil parish. East Ketley is currently being re-developed as part of the Telford Millennium Community, part of the Millennium Communities Programme. It will consist of around 750 new homes and some live/work units, a new primary school, some small offices and retail and leisure services in a masterplan designed by Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands. The site originally consisted of just a small terrace of Victorian houses amid old mineshafts, colliery spoil, a golf course (which was later used as a driving range) and playing fields. Most of the site has been left fallow for many years and some areas have become locally important habitats for wildlife. Ketley was formerly the home of Ketley Ironworks. William Reynolds (the ironmaster of the works in the late 18th century) undertook the construction of three tub boat canals: the Wombridge Canal, the Ketley Canal and the Shropshire Canal with the first successful inclined planes in Great Britain. He lived at Ketley Hall, a grade II listed building which has now been converted into three separate dwellings. A small stretch of the Ketley Canal still survives and can be seen within Ketley Paddock Mound, a nature reserve and former colliery spoil tip. Immediately to the north of Ketley is Hadley.

Club career =Player= Born in Sarilhos Pequenos, Moita, Setúbal District, Fernandes started his career with local Grupo Desportivo da CUF, scoring 38 goals in five years. In 1975 he got his first break, joining Primeira Liga (the only tier he competed in in a career which spanned almost two decades) club Sporting Clube de Portugal, netting more than 250 times in official matches and only trailing legendary Fernando Peyroteo who totalled over 500. In the 1985–86 season, at the ripe age of 34/35, Fernandes produced his best individual season, scoring 30 goals – and winning the Bola de Prata – for the eventual third-placed side, behind FC Porto and S.L.

It is the UK’s longest running organisation for professional leaders, having been founded in 1903 and incorporated by Royal Charter in 1906. The IoD, per its mission statement, stands for \\"free enterprise, entrepreneurialism, wealth creation and good corporate governance,\\" and represents \\"the views of businesses and IoD members in the media and with government.\\" The IoD is located in a Grade I-listed building at 116 Pall Mall, formerly the United Service Club. Members of the IoD also gain access to co-working spaces around the UK, bespoke market intelligence, tailored tax and legal support, exclusive member-only events along with discounts on IoD professional development courses and events. From a high of 55,000 members in 2005, the IoD currently has just over 25,000 full members with membership continuing to decline year on year. Members of the IoD come from companies of all sizes and from all industries . Around 70% work for small and medium-sized enterprises and are typically in senior management and boardroom-level positions, while 78% of FTSE 100 companies have an IoD member on their board or in a senior management position. History and royal charter The IoD was founded in 1903 and incorporated by royal charter in 1906.IoD Royal Charter Retrieved 29 June 2015 The royal charter compels the IoD to: * Promote for the public benefit high levels of skill, knowledge, professional competence and integrity on the part of directors * Represent the interests of members and the business community to government and in the public arena * Encourage and foster a climate favourable to entrepreneurial activity and wealth creation * Promote the study, research and development of corporate governance Membership The IoD represents individual members. Every member’s voice carries equal weight within the organisation, and members retain their membership of the IoD throughout their career. This allows the IoD free rein to speak out on behalf of the business community and discuss individual companies in public. There are currently over 25,000 IoD members in the UK and overseas, with an additional 2,500 student members. Anybody who has an interest in business, is running a business, sits on a board or runs their own company can join the IoD. To help address declining membership, the IoD 99 was established in 2014 and ended in 2018. This initiative offered a substantial discount on membership to business founders between the ages of 18 and 40. Additionally IoD Advance was launched in March 2016, which gives additional benefits in return for a higher annual subscription. Policy The IoD represents its members and makes the case for enterprise, entrepreneurialism and business in the public and to government. Working with various stakeholders, the IoD campaigns on issues of importance to its members and the wider business community to build an environment in the UK which supports businesses and makes is easy to start, grow and run a company. The IoD has experts on tax, infrastructure, law, Europe, corporate governance, financial services, technology, education, skills and regulation, and campaigns on all of these issues. Activities =Business support= The IoD’s Information and Advisory Services offer members tailored and bespoke business advice on all aspects of running a business, including unbiased and confidential legal, financial, HR, marketing, and tax support. Full members of the IoD can access the support through online, telephone or face-to-face consultations, and are allowed up to 25 different consultations each year. =Training and development= The IoD provides training, with courses to suit business leaders at different stages of their career. There are role-specific training courses to equip directors with new skills to take on different roles along with the flagship Chartered Director course. Training courses are open to both members and non-members, and around 5,000 people take part in an IoD course every year. The IoD networks also provide executive coaching, mentoring services and online learning zones. =Initiatives and events= The IoD hosts hundreds of networking, policy and social events throughout the year and across the country. Annual Convention Julia Gillard delivers the inaugural Mackworth Lecture at the IoD, 2015 The Annual Convention is the flagship IoD event and a fixture of the business calendar and has historically taken place at the Royal Albert Hall each year. It draws some of the biggest business names and politicians and leaders from across the world. The convention has taken place every year since 1950. Nine different prime ministers have addressed the convention on more than eighteen occasions along with pioneers such as Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, and Richard Branson, serial entrepreneur, and members of the British royal family, including the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and the Charles, Prince of Wales. The last Annual Convention took place in September 2016 and included former Greece finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, Lord Norman Lamont of Lerwick, global economist Dambisa Moyo, and Nicola Sturgeon. Because of declining ticket and sponsorship revenues the Annual Convention took a year's break in 2017. The event in March 2018 was billed as \\"IoD Open House\\", a three-day business festival held at 116 Pall Mall. Rhondda Lecture In 2015, the IoD launched the annual Rhondda Lecture, in honour of Margaret Mackworth, 2nd Viscountess Rhondda, the first female President of the IoD. The lecture celebrates radical thought, leadership, bold ideas and activism. Julia Gillard, former Australian prime minister, delivered the inaugural lecture in June 2015 at 116 Pall Mall to an audience of politicians, academics, and business leaders. Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservative party, gave the 2016 lecture and was interviewed by BBC journalist Laura Kuenssberg at 116 Pall Mall in December. =Director magazine= Director is a business and lifestyle magazine for business leaders. It is circulated bi-monthly, is free to IoD members and available to purchase through subscription. It contains interviews with business leaders and politicians, updates from the IoD, debates on topical issues, reviews and features. In April 2017 it was announced that the editorial, advertising and production functions of the magazine will be transferred over to SevenC3, a contract publisher. As a result, a number of members of staff were made redundant. This was followed by an announcement in October 2017 that the magazine would be cut back to only six issues per year. Structure and key people The IoD is made up of regional divisions and branches across the UK which serve as the local point of contact for IoD members. At the national level, the IoD is governed by a board and a council, which serves as the voice of IoD members. Stephen Martin was the director-general until early 2019, having succeeded Simon Walker in October 2016. Following Stephen Martin's departure, Anna Daroy became interim director-general for operations and Edwin Morgan director-general for external affairs. In October 2019 Jonathan Geldart was appointed as the IoD's new director-general.IoD Announces Jonathan Geldart As New Director General Retrieved 10 January 2020.

In September 2018, she left the organisation under controversial accusations of racism and bullying. She was succeeded by Charlotte Valeur who stood down in August 2020 due to constraints on her time and rumours regarding opposition to a plan to quit the Pall Mall headquarters. John Watson was appointed Interim Chair while the IoD seeks a permanent replacement. 116 Pall Mall The IoD occupy the Grade I listed 116 Pall Mall in London, which is open to members of the IoD, and has rooms and function suites available for commercial hire. The building is owned by the Crown Estate, along with the large collection of artwork that decorates the rooms. Until 1978, the building was run by the United Service Club. The building was designed by John Nash, the 19th-century architect who also designed the Brighton Pavilion and Marble Arch, and constructed between 1826 and 1828. Between 2001 and 2014, members also had use of 123 Pall Mall. This was opened as a contemporary meeting space in contrast with the more traditional 116 Pall Mall, and the interiors were created by noted designers Wayne and Geraldine Hemingway. Despite its popularity with members, the building was closed in 2014 as part of cost- saving measures. 116 Pall Mall has been used as a location for many films and TV programmes, including Gandhi, Foyle's War, Downton Abbey, The Ali G Show, Parks and Recreation and The Dark Knight.

Biography Simon Bainbridge was born in London. He had his first major break with Spirogyra, written in 1970 while he was still a student. This work displays a passion for intricate and sensuous textures that remain the hallmark of Bainbridge's style today. He was educated at Highgate School and the Royal College of Music. After graduating from the Royal College of Music, he studied with Schuller at Tanglewood; his fondness for American culture is occasionally portrayed in works such as Concerto in Moto Perpetuo (1983), which contains echoes of American minimalism, and the be-bop inspired For Miles (1994). In the 1990s his work took on a new expressive dimension such as in Ad Ora Incerta (1994) which earned him the prestigious Grawemeyer Award in 1997. Bainbridge was Head of Composition at the Royal Academy of Music from 1999 to 2007, and was one of the first four Professors to be appointed in 2000 with the Academy's status as a constituent college of the University of London.

The new museum was open to the public on July 17, 2007, and hosts visiting shows from national and international collections.  Collections  The Akron Art Museum features of gallery space dedicated to the display of its collection of art produced since 1850. The museum also hosts visiting shows from national and international collections. 1850–1950Akron Art Museum - Museum Collection: On View Now Western art created between 1850 and 1950 graces the first floor of the museum's 1899 Italian Renaissance revival style building. The first two rooms feature examples of turn-of-the-century realism and American impressionism. Two rooms explore modernism and regionalism in northeast Ohio from 1910 through 1950. A final room is dedicated entirely to the work of William Sommer, a northeast Ohio artist. These galleries include paintings by Thomas Wilmer Dewing and Frederick Carl Frieseke. Akron Art Museum with lighted roof cloud 1950 to Now Art since 1950 is featured in eight rooms located in the museum's 2007 Knight building. These galleries reflect the eclectic style of late twentieth-century art through examples of postmodern painting and sculpture, photorealism and Pop Art. On view are Chuck Close’s Linda, an oversize early painting; Andy Warhol’s silk-screened Single Elvis and Brillo Boxes; and Ohio carver and preacher Elijah Pierce’s animated relief sculpture The Wise and Foolish Virgins and Four Other Scenes.  Temporary exhibitions  Major temporary exhibitions are housed on the second floor of the Knight Building. These exhibitions include traveling shows, such as American Chronicles: The Art of Norman Rockwell, and shows organized by the museum, such as A Shared Vision: The Fred and Laura Ruth Bidwell Photography Collection. The museum also features more than used for intimate exhibitions of emerging or mid-career artists, community-based art projects and changing exhibitions of photographic media.  Knight Building  Frontal view of the Akron Art Museum The John S. and James L. Knight Building was designed by the Viennese architectural firm Coop Himmelb(l)au following an international competition. The firm was chosen in part for its adaptive use of historic buildings, and the Knight Building is the firm’s first project in the Americas.Akron Art Museum - Architecture Ground breaking for the new building was held on May 22, 2004. Coop Himmelb(l)au’s design integrates additional gallery space, an auditorium and café with the museum’s 1899 building utilizing contrasting, surprising and fanciful visual elements: The “Crystal”,Akron Art Museum - Building the Akron Art Museum a three-story glass lobby that serves as the public entry and as the focal visual space connecting the museum's artistic, educational, administrative, and public programming; the “Gallery Box”,Akron Art Museum - Building the Akron Art Museum comprising the Arnstein, Haslinger, Bidwell and Isroff Galleries, accommodates the museum's collection and temporary exhibitions; and the “Roof Cloud”, a -long cantilevered steel and aluminum armature extends over the old and the new, creating a striking landmark for Akron's downtown which a critic once described as \\"a mechanical alligator snarfing down a Beaux Arts post office.\\" The expansion dramatically increased the museum's ability to present traveling exhibitions and to organize its own distinctive exhibitions. The expansion also allows for the display of major, rarely seen works, including Elliot Torrey’s Surf, the first work to enter the Akron Art Institute’s collection in 1923.Tannenbaum, B., Kahan, M., & Grove, J.

He was a first baseman and left fielder, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Houston Astros, Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, and Atlanta Braves, from 1966 to 1984. Watson was a two-time All-Star during his playing career. After retiring as a player, Watson coached for the Oakland Athletics and served as general manager for the Astros from 1993 through 1995 and Yankees from 1995 through 1998, during which time the team won the 1996 World Series. He served as MLB's vice president in charge of discipline and vice president of rules and on-field operations, from 2002 to 2010. Early life and amateur career Watson was born in Los Angeles on April 10, 1946. His parents separated prior to his birth, and his grandparents raised him. Watson attended John C. Fremont High School, where he played for the school's baseball team as a catcher. Fremont won the 1963 city championship; Watson's high school teammates included future major-leaguers Willie Crawford and Bobby Tolan. Watson went on to attend Los Angeles Harbor College. Professional playing career The Houston Astros signed Watson as an amateur free agent in January 1965. He nearly quit baseball while playing in Minor League Baseball for an affiliate based in Savannah, Georgia, due to segregation in restaurants and hotels. Nicknamed \\"Bull\\", Watson converted to first base and the outfield by the time he made his major league debut with the Astros on September 9, 1966. Watson was a dependable hitter whose home run numbers were somewhat hurt by the fact that he played the majority of his career in the Astrodome, which had a reputation for being a pitcher-friendly ballpark. From 1966 through 1970, Watson appeared in less than 100 games each season for the Astros, batting .259, with 14 home runs, and 74 runs batted in (RBI) overall. From 1971 through 1978, Watson appeared in at least 129 games each season, batting .303, with 122 home runs, and 690 RBI altogether. He was selected as an All-Star twice; in 1973 and 1975. On June 24, 1977, Watson hit for the cycle in a 6–5 win over the San Francisco Giants. In total, during his 14 seasons with the Astros, Watson appeared in 1,381 games, batting .297, with 139 home runs, and 781 RBI. Watson, circa 1977 On June 13, 1979, the Astros traded Watson to the Red Sox in exchange for Pete Ladd, cash, and a player to be named later (who turned out to be Bobby Sprowl). Watson played 84 games for the Red Sox through the remainder of the season. He batted .337 with 13 home runs and 53 RBI. On September 15, 1979, Watson again hit for the cycle. Having already hit for the cycle with the Astros in 1977, he became the first player to accomplish this feat in both the National League (NL) and American League (AL). Following the season, Watson signed as a free agent with the New York Yankees. With the Yankees, he reached the post-season for the first time in his career, losing to the Kansas City Royals in the 1980 American League Championship Series. A year later, Watson reached the World Series for the only time in his career. Watson hit two home runs and batted .318 with seven RBIs, but the Yankees lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games. On April 23, 1982, the Yankees traded Watson to the Atlanta Braves for Scott Patterson. Watson helped propel the Braves to the 1982 National League West title. In 1983, Watson hit .309 mostly as a pinch hitter. He retired after the 1984 season. In his MLB career — 19 years and 1,832 regular season games played — Watson batted .295, with 184 home runs, and 989 RBI. He batted .371 in 17 postseason games. =Millionth run= Watson was credited with scoring the 1,000,000th run in major league history on Sunday, May 4, 1975, at 12:32 in the afternoon. Watson scored from second base on a three-run homer by teammate Milt May at San Francisco's Candlestick Park. It was known that the 999,999th run had already scored, with sponsored updates being provided by and to every ballpark. Despite the lack of in-game urgency, Watson ran at full speed, reaching home plate approximately four seconds before Dave Concepción, who had just homered in Cincinnati and was also racing around the basepaths. \\"I never ran so fast in my entire life,\\" said Concepcion. But it was Watson who won $10,000 and one million Tootsie Rolls provided by the event's sponsor. The 1,000,000th run total only included runs scored in the National and American Leagues (not \\"third\\" major leagues, such as the Federal League). Watson joked that in the aftermath of the event, his fan mail doubled—from four letters to eight. Later, more accurate recalculations of baseball's record-keeping showed that neither Watson nor Concepcion scored baseball's actual millionth run, and it is not known who did.The Machine: The Story of the 1975 Cincinnati Reds by Joe Posnanski Post-playing career =Coach and general manager= After retirement, Watson moved into coaching and was the hitting coach for the Oakland Athletics for four years. The Astros hired Watson as their assistant general manager after the 1988 season. At the end of the 1993 season, Watson was named general manager of the Astros, becoming the second African American (following the Atlanta Braves' Bill Lucas) to serve as a GM in the major leagues. After the 1995 season, the Yankees hired Watson away from Houston to serve as their general manager. He served as GM for the Yankees from October 23, 1995, to February 2, 1998. The 1996 team won the World Series, the first Yankee team to do so since 1978. Thus, Watson became the first African American general manager to win a World Series championship. =MLB executive= After the 1997 season, Watson retired from the Yankees. He served as MLB's vice president in charge of discipline and vice president of rules and on-field operations, beginning in 2002. In 2007 he was under consideration for a return engagement as the Astros general manager. In 2000, Watson worked with USA Baseball to select the team roster competing in baseball at the 2000 Summer Olympics. The United States national baseball team won the gold medal. Watson drew criticism late in the 2007 season. Under his watch, MLB mandated that managers could no longer wear a team issued pullover instead of a uniform jersey top. This caused particular friction between MLB and Red Sox manager Terry Francona, who prefers to wear a pullover due to circulation problems. During the second inning of a Red Sox-Yankees game on August 28, an MLB representative arrived to verify that Francona was wearing a uniform jersey. The Boston media saw this as frivolous, or even biased, due to the public's alleged indifference toward the issue, the specific use of Francona as an example, and the fact that the representative appeared during an important in- division matchup. Watson retired from his position with MLB in 2010. Personal life Watson and his wife, Carol, had two children. While playing for Houston, Watson, along with several teammates, had a cameo appearance in the 1977 movie The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training. Watson was diagnosed with prostate cancer in March 1994, which was successfully treated. Watson wrote about his experience with prostate cancer in his 1997 book, Survive To Win, and spoke regularly at cancer awareness conferences and with players and staff in Major League Baseball. Watson's advocacy has been credited with detecting and treating many MLB personnel, including Joe Torre. In 1999, Watson completed a Bachelor of Science degree with a concentration in sports management at New York's Empire State College. Watson was diagnosed with stage 4 kidney disease in 2016. He died on May 14, 2020, from that illness at the age of 74.

Canal Inclined Plane It was once the site of an inclined plane connecting the now-abandoned Shrewsbury Canal and a smaller canal, the Wombridge Canal, higher in elevation and part of the east Shropshire canal network. The Trench Inclined Plane ceased operations in 1921 having been built in 1793. It was the last working canal inclined plane. Etymology The area is believed to get its name from a clearing in woodland (Horton Wood). Roads and development Trench Road is an ancient byway and was previously known as Trench Way (before 18th Century) and for a period Trench Lane. This byway connected the towns of Newport and Wellington and was a well known route by 1288. Trench road was the southern boundary of the village of Horton and the northern boundary of Wrockwardine Wood. Hence Trench was split into the two townships. Trench Farm was located along this road and by 17th Century the road developed with various shops and public houses appearing. Following World War I the area of Trench started to develop. Woodhouse Crescent had been built by the early 1920s, the area from Trench Road going south (between present Wombridge Road and Church Road) was an army camp and then during the 1960s and 70s the area from Trench Road to Teagues Bridge Lane had turned into a housing estate. Notable people Aston Villa footballer Dalian Atkinson (1968-2016) was brought up in Trench, where he died after an incident with police outside his father's house there.

Its first production under the name was believed to have been in 2001 with the involvement of Adam Yahiye Gadahn. As- Sahab \\"produces documentary-quality films, iPod files and cellphone video.\\" In 2007, it released 97 original videos, a sixfold increase from 2005. Production The organization uses modern technology to produce its video statements. In addition to being released in Arabic, some published videos come with English or other language subtitles. More recently, the release of the \\"5 years after tribute\\", The Manhattan Raid demonstrated a standard comparing favorably with the production quality obtained by major television networks some 10 years ago. Video and audio are (depending on the source material, much of which is decades old) usually crisp, and subtitles are by and large free of grammatical and spelling errors and sometimes explain Islam- specific concepts. It is unknown whether this indicates a general increase in capability or a tapping of additional resources to produce what seems to be a kind of \\"special release\\" video. An August 2002 study by an independent researcher has revealed that As-Sahab may be using a technology similar to greenscreen (Chroma key) to accomplish backdrop effects. U.S. and British intelligence officials believe it to be run by former Orange County California resident Adam Gadahn, who left America to join al Qaeda in Pakistan in 1998. In 2005 a CBC programme based on a documentary originally produced in Japan by NHK Television and was updated by the Discovery Times Channel, was released called Media Jihad - As-Sahab Foundation which traces the origins of As-Sahab. Method of delivery Previously al Qaeda preferred to deliver its videos via a dead drop method using couriers. However, the method of delivery was changed in January 2006 after the Damadola airstrike on an al Qaeda meeting near Damadola, Pakistan. The current method of delivery, which appears to be handled by As-Sahab, is an internet delivery of video or audio materials. 2007 Osama bin Laden video On 6 September 2007, Osama bin Laden's image was posted at a banner advertisement on an Islamic militant website, where As- Sahab posts messages. In the image, the man purported to be bin Laden had a beard that appeared to have been dyed.

It was prepared in anticipation of the end of World War II and the reconstruction after bomb damage and large movements of population. It focused on five defects, for which it proposed remedies: * traffic congestion * depressed housing * inadequacy and maldistribution of open spaces * jumble of houses and industries * sprawl, and suburbanisation of surrounding country towns Ring roads One of the solutions was ring roads around the capital. Construction would have involved considerable disruption, even through parts of the city damaged by bombs, and the roads were not built, but the \\"C Ring\\" (the third ring out from the city centre) was to include what is now the South Circular Road. The plan to build a high-quality road was not realised but the semi-circular route was assigned to existing roads through the southern suburbs. A similar plan was revisited in the 1960s under the name of the London Ringways. =Predecessors= In 1905, the Royal Commission on London Traffic issued a report recommending improvements to road, tram and rail services including a \\"circular road about 75 miles in length at a radius of 12 miles from St Paul's\\". In 1937, the Ministry of Transport published The Highway Development Survey by Sir Edwin Lutyens and Sir Charles Bressey, which reviewed London's road needs and recommended the construction of many miles of roads and the improvement of junctions at key congestion points. Among the proposals was a series of orbital roads around the city with the outer ones built as American-style parkways - wide, landscaped roads with limited access and grade-separated junctions. Rail services Map showing the County of London Plan's four deep level rail routes The report recommended electrification of all rail routes and removal of viaducts, with the elimination of rail bridges over the Thames a key priority. It was hoped that the removal of the river bridges would enable the redevelopment of the South Bank. The proposals included a highly ambitious system of two-track bored rail tunnels in loop-shaped routes beneath built-up areas, large enough to handle main-line trains. These tunnels would provide tube-like service but without the need to change from a main-line train to a tube train. As a result, some tube routes would be transformed into freight-only routes, with the northern portion of the Circle line specifically mentioned in this regard. The proposed railway tunnels would have been as follows: * North Bank Loop: along the north bank of the Thames, from Battersea, to Victoria, Charing Cross, Cannon Street, Shadwell (where a segment would run at surface level using existing tracks), and thence by tunnel to Wapping, Surrey Docks, and Deptford. The various mainline stations on the north bank of the Thames would no longer be served by open-air tracks over viaducts and bridges. * South-east, City and West End Loop: proposed as a means of eliminating the railway bridges across the Thames and associated viaducts. It would connect Charing Cross, Cannon Street, Waterloo Junction, and London Bridge, rising to the surface in the vicinity of Surrey Canal, where it would connect with existing mainline tracks. * North- South Tunnel: from Herne Hill in the south through Blackfriars, connecting with King’s Cross in the north. Blackfriars and Elephant and Castle would be replaced by sub-surface stations. * Northern Arc: connecting Paddington, Marylebone, Euston, King’s Cross, and Liverpool Street. an “Inner Ring” and an “Outer Ring” of freight-only railways was proposed: * Inner Goods Ring: the northern segments of the Inner Circle (today the Circle line) would be converted to freight only, and a continuation through the southern areas of London (Battersea is mentioned) to form a circular line. * Outer Goods Ring: an arc across the northern parts of London, running substantially to the north of, and parallel to, Euston Road. It is not clear whether this would be at surface level or in tunnel, although there is mention of a tunnel under the Thames at Greenwich. These proposals were further reported on in May 1946 by the Railway (London Plan) Committee, which had been appointed by the Minister of War Transport in February 1944. It was chaired by Sir Charles Inglis. The committee concluded that the cost and time required to carry out the recommendations of the London plan meant that the proposals would not be achievable in a short period of time and could not be carried out until adequate alternative capacity could be provided. Of the four central proposals the one supported by the committee was the North-South Tunnel. The 1946 report recommended a dozen new routes totalling over 100 miles, estimated to cost ₤230m and take at least 30 years to build. Among them were 'route 8', from East Croydon to Finsbury Park, in tunnel from Norbury via Streatham, Brixton and the Victoria line route, except Victoria-Hyde Park Corner-Bond St- Euston.Railway Magazine July 1946 p. 248  See also  *Roads.org.uk (Scroll down to 'Wartime planning') *Greater London Plan * Park system * Landscape planning * North Circular Road- the north London counterpart of the South Circular Road * M25 London Orbital Motorway- the outermost London ring, completed in 1986 References Category:1940s in the United Kingdom Category:1940s in London Category:1943 in London Category:Regional planning in London Plan Category:Aftermath of World War II in the United Kingdom Category:United Kingdom home front during World War II ","title":"County of London Plan"},{"id":"2166984","text":"David and Saul (1878) Nationalmuseum Strömkarlen (1882-1884) Prins Eugens Waldemarsudde Ernst Abraham Josephson (1851-1906) was a Swedish painter and poet. He specialized in portraits, genre scenes of folklife and folklore. Background He was born to a middle-class family of merchants of Jewish ancestry. His uncle, Ludvig Josephson (1832-1899) was a dramatist and his uncle Jacob Axel Josephson (1818-1880) was a composer. When he was ten, his father Ferdinand Semy Ferdinand Josephson (1814-1861) left home and he was raised by his mother, Gustafva Jacobsson (1819-1881) and three older sisters. Career At the age of sixteen, he decided to become an artist and, with his family's support, enrolled at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts. His primary instructors there were Johan Christoffer Boklund and August Malmström. He was there until 1876, when he received a Royal Medal for painting. After leaving the Academy, he and his friend and fellow artist Severin Nilsson (1846-1918) visited Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, where they copied the Old Masters. His breakthrough came in Paris, where he was able to study with Jean-Léon Gérôme at the École des Beaux-Arts. He soon began concentrating on portraits, including many of his friends and fellow Swedes in France. For a time, he shared a studio with Hugo Birger (1854–1887). His personal style developed further during a trip to Seville with his friend, Anders Zorn, from 1881 to 1882.Svensk uppslagsbok, Vol. 14, pg.641 (1933) His private life did not go well, however. By his late twenties, he was afflicted with syphilis. His romantic life suffered as a consequence, as he was forced to break off a promising relationship with a young model named Ketty Rindskopf. In the 1880s, a painting that is now considered one of his masterpieces, Strömkarlen (1882-1884) was rejected by the Nationalmuseum. It was eventually purchased by Prince Eugen (1865-1947), himself a skilled amateur artist and art patron, who hung it at his home, Waldemarsudde, now a museum on Djurgården in Stockholm. In total Ernst Josephson is also represented at the museum with ten other oil paintings and a large number of drawings.Guido Valentin, Det hände 1893 - Stora och små händelser samlade ur årets tidningar och tidskrifter, AB Bokverk, Stockholm (1943) pg.21 In 1881, his mother died. They had been very close and it affected him deeply. There was one bright spot; in 1883 he obtained the patronage of Pontus Furstenberg (1827-1902), a wealthy merchant and art collector. In 1885, he became a supporter of the \\"\\", a group that was protesting the outmoded teaching methods at the Swedish Academy. But his interest in the group diminished when he failed to win election to their governing board. By the summer of 1888, he was beginning to have delusions and hallucinations, brought on by the progression of his illness. He installed himself on the Île-de-Bréhat in Brittany, where he had spent the previous summer with painter and engraver Allan Österlind (1855-1938) and his family. There, he became involved in spiritism, possibly inspired by Österlind's interest in occult phenomena. While in his visionary states, he wrote poems and created paintings that he signed with the names of dead artists. Some of his best known and most influential works were created during this period. Shortly after, Österlind took him back to Sweden and he was admitted to , a mental institution in Uppsala. He remained there for several months. The diagnosis was paranoia, but his condition would now most likely be called schizophrenia. After being released, he continued to associate with his old friends, who did what they could to help him. His paintings had become rather distorted, but his earlier works were shown at exhibitions in Paris and Berlin, thanks to arrangements made by Richard Bergh and Georg Pauli, and he received several medals for them. As the years progressed, his physical health declined. First he suffered from rheumatic problems, which prevented him from painting. Then he was diagnosed with diabetes, which was the cause of his death in 1906. Legacy A street, \\"Ernst Josephsons väg\\" in Södra Ängby is named after him. His works may be seen at the Nationalmuseum, Prins Eugens Waldemarsudde and the Göteborgs konstmuseum.

Although not exposed to many international games at the time, Lefebvre is considered as one of the very few players from outside the Test-playing nations to achieve a significant career in the professional game. Domestic career Lefebvre made his first-class debut with Somerset against Oxford University in 1990, then took 5/30 on his first County Championship appearance the following week. Later that year he claimed 7/15 (at the time the equal fifth-best return in List A cricket) in Somerset's record 346-run victory against Devon in the NatWest Trophy. He spent the winter in New Zealand playing for Canterbury, where he achieved his career-best first-class bowling of 6/45, then back in England in 1991 scored his only first-class hundred, making exactly 100 against Worcestershire. Lefebvre was signed by Glamorgan for 1993 and proved particularly effective in one-day cricket where his consistent accuracy made him difficult for batsmen to dominate, as evidenced by a superb bowling analysis of 11-5-13-2 in the quarter-final of the NatWest Trophy game against Worcestershire. Lefebvre's bowling was a significant factor in Glamorgan's Sunday League triumph in 1993. International career A bad groin injury in 1995 forced Lefebvre to retire from professional cricket, but he continued to appear for his country in the ICC Trophy, a competition for which he holds several career records: most appearances (43), most wickets taken (71 at just 11.64) and most catches by an outfielder (26).

All of the components of the fire door assembly must bear a listing agencies label (with the exception of ball-bearing hinges which meet the basic build requirements of ANSI 156.2 and NFPA 80) to ensure the components have been tested to meet the fire rating requirements. =Door hardware= Door hardware includes: * Automatic closing devices or objects * Ball-bearing hinges * Gas seals * Positive latching mechanisms * Smoke seals =Seals= Edges of a fire door usually need to have fire rated seals which can be composed of: * An intumescent strip, which expands when exposed to heat * Gaskets to prevent the passage of smoke * Neoprene weatherstripping When intumescent seals are used in the door design, use of the correct seal is crucial in the fire rating performance the door assembly. Seals may vary in chemical composition, expansion rate, expansion volume, and/or charring characteristics. =Windows= Some fire doors are equipped with integral windows which also have a rating, or have been incorporated at the time of the door test and be subject to the overall door's product certification. Fire-resistive windows must remain intact under fire conditions and hose stream impact resistance, and can include: * Wire mesh glass - usually Georgian wired * Liquid sodium silicate fills between two window panes * Ceramic glasses * Borosilicate glass Wired glass typically withstands the fire, whereas the sodium silicate liquid also acts to insulate heat transfer, due to the endothermic action of this chemical. Fire door rating label Regulations All components are required to adhere to product certification requirements that are acceptable to the local Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) by meeting the requirements of the local building code and fire code. The regulatory requirement change from country to country. For example, in Australia, the National Construction Code dictates that all fire doors must be tested to certain specifications in order to meet resistance approvals and certification. In the United Kingdom a fire resisting doorset should be subjected to either a British Standard Fire Test BS 476 Part 22 1987, or a BS/EN 1634-1 2000 test. The results are recorded by the test agency and provided in a report which detail such things as constructional details, distortion data and pressure readings. The numerical fire resistance rating that is required to be installed in a particular building is provided in the Building Regulations approved Document B, or British Standards such as the BS 5588 series (e.g., 30 minutes FD30, or FD30(S) if cold smoke resistance is also required). Similar technical guidance documents and building regulations are in effect in other countries. =Combustibility= Fire doors are not necessarily noncombustible. It is acceptable for portions of the door to be destroyed by combustion during exposure to a fire as long as the door assembly meets the fire test criteria of limiting temperature on the non-fire side of the assembly. This is in accordance with the overall performance goal of a fire rated door to slow fire propagation from one fire rated compartment to another for only a limited amount of time, during which automatic or manual fire fighting may be employed to limit fire spread, or occupants can exit the building. Fire door failure Fire doors are sometimes rendered unable to provide their listed fire resistance by ignorance of the intended use and associated restrictions and requirements, or by improper use. For example, fire doors are sometimes blocked open, or carpets are run through them, which would allow the fire to travel past the fire barrier in which the door is placed. The door's certification markings are displayed both on the door leaves and the fire door frames, and should not be removed or painted over during the life of the building. Sometimes fire doors have apparently very large gaps at the foot of them, an inch or two even, allowing air movement, such as in dormitory facilities. This can lead the occupants of a building to question their status as 'real' fire doors. NFPA 80 allows a maximum door undercut of 3/4 inch however fire doors are tested with smaller clearances in accordance with NFPA 252.NFPA 80 Standard for Fire Doors and Other Opening Protectives 2007 Edition, section 4.8.4.1 Corridors have a fire rating of one hour or less, and the fire doors in them are required by code to have a fire rating of 1/2 or 1/3 hour, the intent of which is mainly to restrict smoke travel.NFPA 80 Standard for Fire Doors and Other Opening Protectives 2007 Edition, Annex D Fire Door and Fire Window Classifications, section D.5 Normal operation Fire door held open by an electromagnet Most fire doors are designed to be kept closed at all times. Some doors are designed to stay open under normal circumstances, and close automatically in the event of a fire. Whichever method is used, the door's movement should never be impaired by a doorstop or other obstacle. The intumescent and smoke-seal bounding of fire doors should be routinely checked, as should the action of the door closer and latch. Some fire doors are held open by an electromagnet, which may be wired to a fire alarm system. If the power fails or the fire alarm is activated, the coil is de-energized, and the door closes. Wireless, battery operated fire door retainers can also be used to safely and legally hold fire doors open. Rated fire doors are tested to withstand an ASTM E119 standard time-temperature curve for a specified period.http://www.astm.org/Standards/E119.htm, \\"ASTM E119 - 12 Standard Test Methods for Fire Tests of Building Construction and Materials,\\" Retrieved 9/21/12 There are 20, 30, 45, 60, and 90-minute-rated fire doors that are certified by an approved laboratory designated as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL, e.g., Underwriters Laboratories). The certification only applies if all parts of the installation are correctly specified and installed. For example, fitting the wrong kind of glazing may severely reduce the door's fire resistance period. Installation As well as ensuring the door is hung properly and squarely, it is also very important that where a fire door is installed, any gaps left in the opening between the wall and the door frame must be properly filled with fire resisting material. Fire doors are normally installed by a carpenter. Annual inspection In the United States, the NFPA requires annual inspections of fire-resistance rated door and frame assemblies.NFPA 80, 2007 Edition, Standard for Fire Doors, Frames and Other Opening Protectives (5.2.4) Local Authorities Having Jurisdiction must adopt the new edition for this requirement to take effect. Most jurisdictions in the US will be adopting the IBC (International Building Code) model code, which references the NFPA 80 2007 edition requirement, as their local codes. NFPA 80 5.2.4.requires the following items shall be verified, at minimum: # No open holes or breaks exist in surfaces of either the door or frame. # Glazing, vision light frames & glazing beads are intact and securely fastened in place, if so equipped. # The door, frame, hinges, hardware, and noncombustible threshold are secured, aligned, and in working order with no visible signs of damage. # No parts are missing or broken. # Door clearances at the door edge of the door frame (Wood Door), on the pull side of the door, do not exceed clearances listed in 4.8.4 (the clearance under the bottom of the door shall be a maximum of 3/4\\") and 6.3.1 (top & edges 1/8\\") Metal door (top & edges up to 3/16\\") # The self-closing device is operational; that is, the active door completely closes when operated from the full open position. # If a coordinator is installed, the inactive leaf closes before the active leaf. # Latching hardware operates and secures the door when it is in the closed position. # Auxiliary hardware items that interfere or prohibit operation are not installed on the door or frame. # No field modifications to the door assembly have been performed that void the label. # Gasketing and edge seals, where required, are inspected to verify their presence and integrity. According to building and fire codes, annual fire door inspections is the responsibility of the building owner. However, as with other mandatory fire inspections, such as the inspection of fire dampers, the fire door inspections are often omitted and many facilities are out of compliance. The final say on the acceptance of any inspection requires the approval of the AHJ (Authority Having Jurisdiction). Modifications NFPA 80 includes guidelines concerning field modifications of listed hardware, including frames, builder's hardware, doors, thresholds etc. The growing field of access control and electronic entry systems has resulted in some fire doors being field modified without proper listing agency approval. Field modifications of fire listed assemblies must either be inspected by a listing agency representative, or the modification must be performed by personnel certified to perform such work.

They were developed by George Marsaglia over several years and first published in 1995 on a CD-ROM of random numbers.  Test overview  * Birthday spacings: Choose random points on a large interval. The spacings between the points should be asymptotically exponentially distributed.Renyi, 1953, p194 The name is based on the birthday paradox. * Overlapping permutations: Analyze sequences of five consecutive random numbers. The 120 possible orderings should occur with statistically equal probability. * Ranks of matrices: Select some number of bits from some number of random numbers to form a matrix over {0,1}, then determine the rank of the matrix. Count the ranks. * Monkey tests: Treat sequences of some number of bits as \\"words\\". Count the overlapping words in a stream. The number of \\"words\\" that do not appear should follow a known distribution. The name is based on the infinite monkey theorem. * Count the 1s: Count the 1 bits in each of either successive or chosen bytes. Convert the counts to \\"letters\\", and count the occurrences of five-letter \\"words\\". * Parking lot test: Randomly place unit circles in a 100×100 square. A circle is successfully parked if it does not overlap an existing successfully parked one. After 12,000 tries, the number of successfully parked circles should follow a certain normal distribution. * Minimum distance test: Randomly place 8000 points in a 10000×10000 square, then find the minimum distance between the pairs. The square of this distance should be exponentially distributed with a certain mean. * Random spheres test: Randomly choose 4000 points in a cube of edge 1000. Center a sphere on each point, whose radius is the minimum distance to another point. The smallest sphere's volume should be exponentially distributed with a certain mean. * The squeeze test: Multiply 2³¹ by random floats on (0,1) until you reach 1. Repeat this 100000 times. The number of floats needed to reach 1 should follow a certain distribution. * Overlapping sums test: Generate a long sequence of random floats on (0,1). Add sequences of 100 consecutive floats. The sums should be normally distributed with characteristic mean and variance. * Runs test: Generate a long sequence of random floats on (0,1). Count ascending and descending runs. The counts should follow a certain distribution. * The craps test: Play 200000 games of craps, counting the wins and the number of throws per game. Each count should follow a certain distribution.  Test descriptions  * The birthday spacings test: Choose m birthdays in a year of n days. List the spacings between the birthdays. If j is the number of values that occur more than once in that list, then j is asymptotically Poisson distributed with mean m ÷ (4n). Experience shows n must be quite large, say n ≥ 2, for comparing the results to the Poisson distribution with that mean. This test uses n = 2 and m = 2, so that the underlying distribution for j is taken to be Poisson with λ = 2 ÷ 2 = 2. A sample of 500 js is taken, and a chi-square goodness of fit test provides a p value. The first test uses bits 1–24 (counting from the left) from integers in the specified file. Then the file is closed and reopened. Next, bits 2–25 are used to provide birthdays, then 3–26 and so on to bits 9–32. Each set of bits provides a p-value, and the nine p-values provide a sample for a KSTEST. * The overlapping 5-permutation test: This is the OPERM5 test. It looks at a sequence of one million 32-bit random integers. Each set of five consecutive integers can be in one of 120 states, for the 5! possible orderings of five numbers. Thus the 5th, 6th, 7th, ... numbers each provide a state. As many thousands of state transitions are observed, cumulative counts are made of the number of occurrences of each state. Then the quadratic form in the weak inverse of the 120×120 covariance matrix yields a test equivalent to the likelihood ratio test that the 120 cell counts came from the specified (asymptotically) normal distribution with the specified 120×120 covariance matrix (with rank 99). This version uses 1000000 integers, twice. This test may have unresolved bugs resulting in consistently poor p-values.https://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php * The binary rank test for 31×31 matrices: The leftmost 31 bits of 31 random integers from the test sequence are used to form a 31×31 binary matrix over the field {0,1}. The rank is determined. That rank can be from 0 to 31, but ranks < 28 are rare, and their counts are pooled with those for rank 28. Ranks are found for 40000 such random matrices and a chi-square test is performed on counts for ranks 31, 30, 29 and ≤ 28\\\\. * The binary rank test for 32×32 matrices: A random 32×32 binary matrix is formed, each row a 32-bit random integer. The rank is determined. That rank can be from 0 to 32, ranks less than 29 are rare, and their counts are pooled with those for rank 29. Ranks are found for 40000 such random matrices and a chi square test is performed on counts for ranks 32, 31, 30 and ≤ 29\\\\. * The binary rank test for 6×8 matrices: From each of six random 32-bit integers from the generator under test, a specified byte is chosen, and the resulting six bytes form a 6×8 binary matrix whose rank is determined. That rank can be from 0 to 6, but ranks 0, 1, 2, 3 are rare; their counts are pooled with those for rank 4. Ranks are found for 100000 random matrices, and a chi square test is performed on counts for ranks 6, 5 and ≤ 4\\\\. * The bitstream test: The file under test is viewed as a stream of bits. Call them b, b, … . Consider an alphabet with two \\"letters\\", 0 and 1, and think of the stream of bits as a succession of 20-letter \\"words\\", overlapping. Thus the first word is bb…b, the second is bb…b, and so on. The bitstream test counts the number of missing 20-letter (20-bit) words in a string of 2 overlapping 20-letter words. There are 2 possible 20-letter words. For a truly random string of 2 + 19 bits, the number of missing words j should be (very close to) normally distributed with mean 141,909 and sigma 428. Thus (j-141909) ÷ 428 should be a standard normal variate (z score) that leads to a uniform [0,1) p value. The test is repeated twenty times. * The tests OPSO, OQSO and DNA: OPSO means overlapping-pairs-sparse-occupancy. The OPSO test considers 2-letter words from an alphabet of 1024 letters. Each letter is determined by a specified ten bits from a 32-bit integer in the sequence to be tested. OPSO generates 2 (overlapping) 2-letter words (from 2 + 1 \\"keystrokes\\") and counts the number of missing words – that is 2-letter words which do not appear in the entire sequence. That count should be very close to normally distributed with mean 141909, sigma 290. Thus (missingwrds-141909) ÷ 290 should be a standard normal variable. The OPSO test takes 32 bits at a time from the test file and uses a designated set of ten consecutive bits. It then restarts the file for the next designated 10 bits, and so on. OQSO means overlapping-quadruples-sparse-occupancy. The test OQSO is similar, except that it considers 4-letter words from an alphabet of 32 letters, each letter determined by a designated string of 5 consecutive bits from the test file, elements of which are assumed 32-bit random integers. The mean number of missing words in a sequence of 2 four-letter words, (2 + 3 \\"keystrokes\\"), is again 141909, with sigma = 295. The mean is based on theory; sigma comes from extensive simulation. The DNA test considers an alphabet of 4 letters C,G,A,T, determined by two designated bits in the sequence of random integers being tested. It considers 10-letter words, so that as in OPSO and OQSO, there are 2 possible words, and the mean number of missing words from a string of 2 (overlapping) 10-letter words (2 + 9 \\"keystrokes\\") is 141909. The standard deviation sigma = 339 was determined as for OQSO by simulation. (Sigma for OPSO, 290, is the true value (to three places), not determined by simulation. * The count-the-1's test on a stream of bytes: Consider the file under test as a stream of bytes (four per 32-bit integer). Each byte can contain from none to eight 1s, with probabilities 1, 8, 28, 56, 70, 56, 28, 8, 1 over 256. Now let the stream of bytes provide a string of overlapping 5-letter words, each \\"letter\\" taking values A, B, C, D, E. The letters are determined by the number of 1s in a byte 0, 1, or 2 yield A, 3 yields B, 4 yields C, 5 yields D and 6, 7 or 8 yield E. Thus we have a monkey at a typewriter hitting five keys with various probabilities (37, 56, 70, 56, 37 over 256). There are 5⁵ possible 5-letter words, and from a string of 256000 (overlapping) 5-letter words, counts are made on the frequencies for each word. The quadratic form in the weak inverse of the covariance matrix of the cell counts provides a chisquare test Q5–Q4, the difference of the naive Pearson sums of (OBS-EXP) ÷ EXP on counts for 5- and 4-letter cell counts. * The count-the-1's test for specific bytes: Consider the file under test as a stream of 32-bit integers. From each integer, a specific byte is chosen, say the leftmost bits 1 to 8. Each byte can contain from 0 to 8 1s, with probabilities 1, 8, 28, 56, 70, 56, 28, 8, 1 over 256. Now let the specified bytes from successive integers provide a string of (overlapping) 5-letter words, each \\"letter\\" taking values A, B, C, D, E. The letters are determined by the number of 1s, in that byte 0, 1, or 2 → A, 3 → B, 4 → C, 5 → D, and 6, 7 or 8 → E. Thus we have a monkey at a typewriter hitting five keys with various probabilities 37, 56, 70, 56, 37 over 256. There are 5 possible 5-letter words, and from a string of 256000 (overlapping) 5-letter words, counts are made on the frequencies for each word. The quadratic form in the weak inverse of the covariance matrix of the cell counts provides a chisquare test Q5 – Q4, the difference of the naive Pearson sums of (OBS − EXP) ÷ EXP on counts for 5- and 4-letter cell counts. * The parking lot test: In a square of side 100, randomly \\"park\\" a car – a circle of radius 1. Then try to park a 2nd, a 3rd, and so on, each time parking \\"by ear\\". That is, if an attempt to park a car causes a crash with one already parked, try again at a new random location. (To avoid path problems, consider parking helicopters rather than cars.) Each attempt leads to either a crash or a success, the latter followed by an increment to the list of cars already parked. If we plot n: the number of attempts, versus k the number successfully parked, we get a curve that should be similar to those provided by a perfect random number generator. Theory for the behavior of such a random curve seems beyond reach, and as graphics displays are not available for this battery of tests, a simple characterization of the random experiment is used: k, the number of cars successfully parked after n = 12000 attempts. Simulation shows that k should average 3523 with sigma 21.9 and is very close to normally distributed. Thus (k − 3523) ÷ 21.9 should be a standard normal variable, which, converted to a uniform variable, provides input to a KSTEST based on a sample of 10. * The minimum distance test: It does this 100 times choose n = 8000 random points in a square of side 10000. Find d, the minimum distance between the (n − n) ÷ 2 pairs of points. If the points are truly independent uniform, then , the square of the minimum distance should be (very close to) exponentially distributed with mean 0.995. Thus should be uniform on [0,1) and a KSTEST on the resulting 100 values serves as a test of uniformity for random points in the square. Test numbers = 0 mod 5 are printed but the KSTEST is based on the full set of 100 random choices of 8000 points in the 10000×10000 square. * The 3D spheres test: Choose 4000 random points in a cube of edge 1000. At each point, center a sphere large enough to reach the next closest point. Then the volume of the smallest such sphere is (very close to) exponentially distributed with mean 120 ÷ 3\\\\. Thus the radius cubed is exponential with mean 30. (The mean is obtained by extensive simulation). The 3D spheres test generates 4000 such spheres 20 times. Each min radius cubed leads to a uniform variable by means of 1 − exp(−r ÷ 30), then a KSTEST is done on the 20 p-values. * The squeeze test: Random integers are floated to get uniforms on [0,1). Starting with k = 2 = 2147483648, the test finds j, the number of iterations necessary to reduce k to 1, using the reduction k = ceiling(k×U), with U provided by floating integers from the file being tested. Such js are found 100000 times, then counts for the number of times j was ≤ 6, 7, ..., 47, ≥ 48 are used to provide a chi-square test for cell frequencies. * The overlapping sums test: Integers are floated to get a sequence U(1), U(2), ... of uniform [0,1) variables. Then overlapping sums, S(1) = U(1) + ... + U(100), S(2) = U(2) + ... + U(101), ... are formed. The Ss are virtually normal with a certain covariance matrix. A linear transformation of the Ss converts them to a sequence of independent standard normals, which are converted to uniform variables for a KSTEST. The p-values from ten KSTESTs are given still another KSTEST. * The runs test: It counts runs up, and runs down, in a sequence of uniform [0,1) variables, obtained by floating the 32-bit integers in the specified file. This example shows how runs are counted: 0.123, 0.357, 0.789, 0.425, 0.224, 0.416, 0.95 contains an up-run of length 3, a down-run of length 2 and an up-run of (at least) 2, depending on the next values. The covariance matrices for the runs-up and runs-down are well known, leading to chi-square tests for quadratic forms in the weak inverses of the covariance matrices. Runs are counted for sequences of length 10000. This is done ten times. Then repeated. * The craps test: It plays 200000 games of craps, finds the number of wins and the number of throws necessary to end each game. The number of wins should be (very close to) a normal with mean 200000p and variance 200000p(1 − p), with p = 244 ÷ 495\\\\. Throws necessary to complete the game can vary from 1 to infinity, but counts for all > 21 are lumped with 21. A chi-square test is made on the no.-of-throws cell counts. Each 32-bit integer from the test file provides the value for the throw of a die, by floating to [0,1), multiplying by 6 and taking 1 plus the integer part of the result. Most of the tests in DIEHARD return a p-value, which should be uniform on [0,1) if the input file contains truly independent random bits. Those p-values are obtained by p = F(X), where F is the assumed distribution of the sample random variable X – often normal. But that assumed F is just an asymptotic approximation, for which the fit will be worst in the tails. Thus you should not be surprised with occasional p-values near 0 or 1, such as 0.0012 or 0.9983. When a bit stream really FAILS BIG, you will get ps of 0 or 1 to six or more places. Since there are many tests, it is not unlikely that a p < 0.025 or p > 0.975 means that the RNG has \\"failed the test at the 0.05 level\\". We expect a number of such events ps happen among the hundreds of events DIEHARD produces, even conditioned on the random number generator being perfect.

He is best known for creating the diehard tests, a suite of software for measuring statistical randomness.  Research on random numbers  Visual demonstration of Marsaglia's theorem George Marsaglia established the lattice structure of linear congruential generators in the paper \\"Random numbers fall mainly in the planes\\", later termed the Marsaglia's theorem. This phenomenon means that n-tuples with coordinates obtained from consecutive use of the generator will lie on a small number of equally spaced hyperplanes in n-dimensional space. He also developed the diehard tests, a series of tests to determine whether or not a sequence of numbers have the statistical properties that could be expected from a random sequence. In 1995 he published a CD-ROM of random numbers, which included the diehard tests. His diehard paper came with the quotation \\"Nothing is random, only uncertain\\" attributed to Gail Gasram, though this was simply the reverse of Marsaglia G. He also developed some of the most commonly used methods for generating random numbers and using them to produce random samples from various distributions. Some of the most widely used being the multiply-with- carry, subtract-with-borrow, xorshift, KISS and Mother methods for random numbers, and the ziggurat algorithm for generating normally or other unimodally distributed random variables.  Life  He was Professor Emeritus of Pure and Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at Washington State University and Professor Emeritus of Statistics at Florida State University.

The character also starred in two spin-off movies, Highlander: Endgame and Highlander: The Source. Portrayed by British actor Adrian Paul, Duncan is born in the Scottish Highlands in 1592, a member of the Clan MacLeod, and later discovers he is an immortal, a person born with the power of the Quickening, unable to die unless beheaded. Some immortals hunt down others of their kind in order to absorb the power and knowledge of those they behead, a Game where \\"in the end, there can be only one\\" and the winner will gain the power and knowledge of all immortals who ever lived. Trained by his elder cousin Connor, another immortal born decades earlier (and the original hero of the Highlander franchise), Duncan MacLeod travels the world in search of friendship and adventure, helping people when he can, sometimes fighting alongside or against other immortals.Episode \\"The Gathering\\", in Highlander: The Series (season 1) (DVD, Davis-Panzer Productions, 2001), disc 1. The series follows his adventures in the present day, while regular flashbacks reveal earlier adventures across the centuries. At the start of the series, he lives in the fictional city of Seacouver, Washington, but at different points in the show he also lives on a barge in Paris, France. This is because production regularly switched filming between Vancouver, British Columbia and Paris, France. The sixth and final season was filmed entirely in Paris. Originally, Highlander: The Series was created to star Connor MacLeod and carry on directly from the events of the original 1986 film Highlander. The film had ended with Connor MacLeod becoming the last immortal in 1985, ending the Game and earning him \\"The Prize\\" (the power of all immortals who ever lived). Rather than ignore the film entirely, the series took place in a new timeline where the events of the film still happened but Connor's final battle did not earn him the Prize because there were still many immortals still alive on Earth. While the TV series followed this idea, it was suggested by actor Adrian Paul to create a new immortal Scottish Highlander instead to avoid critical comparisons with the original. Character biography =TV series background= Duncan MacLeod was born in 1592 in Glenfinnan, Scotland. Raised as the son of the clan chieftain, he would later learn that he was actually adopted by them, a child to replace one who had died in stillbirth. He would never learn the identity of his biological parents, but the woman who raised him assured him that he was her son as far as she was concerned.Episode \\"Family Tree\\", in Highlander: The Series (season 1) (DVD, Davis-Panzer Productions, 2001), disc 1 As a child, Duncan hears stories about Connor MacLeod, a man who had died in battle in 1536 only to revive later, fully healed, leading the clan to banish him for witchcraft. Young Duncan believes this story is a myth. At thirteen-years-old, Duncan encounters Cassandra, \\"the Witch of Donal Woods.\\" Cassandra, secretly an immortal, prophesies that Duncan will be a great warrior against evil and possibly destroy an enemy of hers.Highlander: The Series Season 5 - \\"Prophecy.\\" In 1622, the adult Duncan is fatally wounded in battle against the Clan Campbell.Episode \\"Family Tree\\", Bonus Material, Watcher Chronicle, article: Duncan MacLeod-1622, in Highlander: The Series (season 1) (DVD, Davis-Panzer Productions, 2001), disc 1. When his wounds heal and he awakens alive and well, he believes it is a miracle but his father disowns him, believing it is witchcraft. Duncan is banished and forced to live in exile. He unknowingly fights another immortal and recovers from fatal wounds again after another battle. Connor finally finds him in 1625, having heard stories of yet another member of the Clan MacLeod being exiled for unnatural powers.The date is from the Watcher Chronicle in Highlander: The Series (DVD, Davis-Panzer Productions, 2001), disc 1, episode \\"The Gathering\\", bonus materials. Connor befriends Duncan and teaches him his true nature, explaining there are rare people born with a power that, along with making them unable to produce children, activates if the person suffers the shock of violent death. After this First Death, they become ageless and invincible to death unless beheaded (though the head is more vulnerable to injury and limbs cannot be regrown). Connor explains that other immortals can take Duncan's Quickening if they kill him, absorbing his knowledge and power. The Game says that \\"in the end, there can be only one\\" and has only a few rules, such as no conflict on holy ground and only one on one duels. Connor spends years with Duncan, training him how to survive, and the two come to regard each other as brothers. Preferring friendship, art, and the exchange of knowledge to violence and killing, Duncan travels the world and becomes allies with other immortals if they don't feel the need to challenge him. Close immortal friends include Hugh \\"Fitz\\" Fitzcairn and the thief Amanda, the latter of whom Duncan has an on-again, off-again relationship. Duncan joins fights and wars when he believes he follows a just cause, leading him to become an experienced warrior. Originally taking pride in being reckless and a little uneducated, he matures into a worldly person, becoming knowledgeable in many fields and martial arts, and learning many languages. He comes to appreciate the practices and wisdom of other cultures. In the Middle East, Duncan trains with an Arabian immortal named Hamza el Kahir.Highlander: The Series Season 3 - \\"Finale: Part 1.\\" In Europe, he trains with an immortal named Tjanefer (calling himself \\"Graham Ashe\\"), who had taught Connor's own mentor Juan Sánchez-Villalobos RamírezHighlander: The Series Season 5 - \\"The End of Innocence.\\", and then another named Pierre Segur.Highlander: The Series Season 2 - \\"Prodigal Son.\\" All three of these friendships are cut short when each teacher is challenged and killed by other immortals. In 1778, he befriends and trains under the samurai Hideo Koto in Japan. When Koto sacrifices himself for MacLeod, the Highlander inherits his katana and swears to protect the man's family for as long as he lives.Highlander: The Series Season 3 - \\"The Samurai.\\" After leaving Japan, Duncan meets May-Ling Shen, a Chinese immortal warrior, and former courtesan, in 1780. Surprised that the warrior \\"Master Shen\\" is a woman, Duncan becomes her student in martial arts.Highlander: The Series Season 3 - \\"They Also Serve.\\" Briefly, they are lovers as well before parting as friends. Duncan later becomes involved in the Napoleonic Wars, during which he befriends the immortal priest Darius. As the war draws to a close, Duncan decides to relocate to America, hoping to find a more peaceful life in the \\"New World.\\"Highlander: The Series Season 1 - \\"Band of Brothers.\\" In America, Duncan lives with the Sioux people, taking a lover Little Deer and helping raise her child Kahani, whom he loves as his own. When the tribe is later murdered by white colonials and a bigoted immortal named Kern, Duncan temporarily leaves society and the Game by living in isolation on holy ground. By 1847, Duncan leaves and returns to Europe for a time. In 1851, he learns new sword fighting techniques from Otavio Corsone, a former student of Ramírez. Their friendship ends when Duncan realizes the noble-born sees the Scottish Highlander as a barbarian beneath his class.Highlander: The Series Season 5 - \\"Duende.\\" Years later, Duncan joins the American Civil War, becoming a scout for the Union Army and a conductor on the Underground Railroad. He spends some time in a Confederate prison camp. After the war, he travels between the U.S. and Europe, having different adventures and professions. During World War I, he works as an army medic in Europe. During World War II, he is in London for a time before joining the French Resistance. Afterward, he aids Jewish refugees before returning to North America. = TV series modern day adventures = In 1980, Duncan meets and falls in love with French artist and sculptor Tessa Noël. After three years, he explains his true nature to her, though he does not explain that immortals battle each other for power in the Game. To his relief, she decides to remain at his side. Over the next several years, he occasionally battles other immortals but does not tell Tessa, not wishing to worry her. By 1992, they move to Seacouver and open a shop called MacLeod and Noël Antiques. One night, while a thief named Richie Ryan breaks into the shop, MacLeod is confronted by an evil immortal named Slan Quince. Tessa at last learns about the Game and that certain immortals are determined to win the Prize, the collected power of all immortals who ever lived. Though angry that Duncan kept this from her and now fearful that life with him will regularly involve violence, Tessa decides to remain. Witnessing Duncan's fights with Quince, Richie Ryan learns about the existence of immortals. Duncan decides to take him in, saying the 17-year-old needs guidance so he doesn't return to his criminal life. Richie is hired to work at the antique shop and becomes a younger brother of sorts to Duncan and Tessa, adding enthusiasm and comic relief to their adventures. For a time, Duncan and Tessa relocate to Paris, living on a barge the Highlander purchases near Notre Dame. Richie joins them. MacLeod later learns that there is a group of mortals who have been secretly documenting the lives and actions of immortals for thousands of years, an organization called The Watchers. While most are benevolent and don't interfere, a sub-group called the Hunters goes rogue, hunting down immortals so that none of them who win the Prize may use that power to rule humanity. Horton, leader of the Hunters, becomes a hated enemy to Duncan. Meanwhile, Joe Dawson, a Watcher assigned to observe Duncan, attempts to forge a friendship with the Highlander and openly aids him at times. Duncan is later shocked to learn that one of Joe's Watcher colleagues is secretly the legendary immortal Methos, over 5000 years old and believed to be oldest living immortal. The two forge their own friendship. After returning to Seacouver, Duncan proposes to Tessa. Immediately afterward, Tessa is kidnapped by a Hunter. Duncan frees her and then sends her home with Richie while he investigates the man's files. But outside, a mugger robs and fatally shoots Richie and Tessa. Duncan cradles Tessa's body as Richie awakens, now realizing what the Highlander had sensed since they first met: he is also immortal.Highlander: The Series Season 2 - \\"The Darkness.\\" Grief-stricken and feeling responsible for Tessa's death, Duncan becomes a more somber and introverted character. He has Richie sell the antique shop and then purchases a gym called DeSalvo's Martial Arts. He keeps former owner Charlie DeSalvo on as the manager and befriends him. Together, Charlie and Duncan teach Richie martial arts and sword fighting. When Richie repeatedly seems motivated by emotion rather than reason in his battles, Duncan decides he has taught the young man enough and they must go down different paths now.Highlander: The Series Season 2 - \\"Under Color of Authority.\\" They resume a friendship later but repeatedly clash in regards to morality, whom to trust, and how to deal with enemies. A year after Tessa's death, MacLeod next major relationship in the series is with trauma surgeon Anne Lindsey.Highlander: The Series Season 3 - \\"Rite of Passage.\\" Duncan later realizes she is being targeted by his enemies and believes it might be best that they go separate ways.

The series was originally going to team-up Duncan with his sometimes love Amanda, who had become the star of her spin-off show Highlander: The Raven. The spin-off only lasted one season and plans changed so that the film would now feature Connor and Duncan once again uniting. Highlander: Endgame establishes that Duncan has killed at least 176 immortals by the year 2000. The film got mixed reviews with many feeling negatively about it. The film's flashbacks give further details regarding Connor training Duncan when they were younger. It also reveals that Duncan married a pre-immortal Irish woman named Kate Devaney in 1715. While Connor advises that Kate be allowed to simply age and die naturally, Duncan decides to activate her immortality by giving her a fatal stab wound. Hating her new immortality, Kate leaves and resents Duncan for condemning her to an ageless life. The film introduces Jacob Kell, an evil immortal with a grudge against Connor who ignores the rules of the Game, overpowering other immortals with the help of henchmen.Duncan reunites with Connor and discovers that one of Kell's soldiers, the woman called Faith, is his immortal former wife Kate. Sickened of his unending life of violence and believing that neither he nor Duncan can defeat Kell alone, Connor duels Duncan and demands the younger Highlander take his head and power. Seeing Connor won't be swayed, Duncan tells Connor he loves him and considers him a brother. He then beheads Connor, absorbing his power and knowledge. When Duncan later battles Kell, he briefly speaks with Connor's face and voice. An extended ending on the DVD release reveals that after beheading Kell, Duncan discovers that Faith is still alive. Willing to re-establish at least a friendship with Duncan, Faith once again calls herself Kate. Highlander: The Source (2007) - Made for broadcast by the Syfy channel (then still called \\"the Sci-Fi Channel\\"), this TV-movie aired at 9 PM Eastern on Saturday, September 15, 2007 as a \\"Sci-Fi Original Movie\\".Schedule. scifi.com Continuing Duncan's adventures several years after Highlander: Endgame, the story takes place in a possible future version of Earth where human society has fallen into chaos. Duncan has married a mortal woman named Anna Teshemka but separated from her when she decided they couldn't stay together if she couldn't have a family with him. With her and other allies, he investigates an energy well in Eastern Europe that may be the legendary Source of Immortality. The closer he approaches the Source, the more mortal he becomes. During their quest, Duncan and his allies are hunted by the Guardian, an immortal with enhanced abilities. At the end of the film, Duncan defeats the Guardian but does not behead him. He and Anna then seem to merge with the Source and she reveals they will have a child. The film met with largely negative reviews. Plans to follow it up with further TV films were canceled. In 2008, a short film called \\"Reunion\\" was released in the DVD collection of Highlander: The Series. The film, written by series producer David Abramowitz and directed by Don Paonessa, did not acknowledge the events of Highlander: The Source. The story revolved around Joe Dawson adjusting to retirement, Methos deciding he wished to get married, and Amanda reconsidering her lifestyle. Duncan was mentioned but not seen. At the Highlander Worldwide Convention the next year, TV series producer David Abramowitz referred to Highlander: The Source as a \\"bad dream\\" Duncan had, leading many fans to dismiss it from canon. =Books= A series of nine licensed novels were released from October 1995 to February 1999: The Return of the Immortal, The Element of Fire, Scimitar, Scotland the Brave, Measure of a Man, The Path, Zealot, Shadow of Obsession, The Captive Soul, White Silence, and An Evening at Joe's. These novels detail additional events in Duncan's life. The Element of Fire features more adventures of Duncan and Connor fighting alongside each other. A German language novel entitled Highlander: Die Rückkehr des Unsterblichen (Highlander: The Return of the Immortal) was also released. The novel deals with Duncan wishing to leave the Game and takes place during the season one episode \\"Deadly Medicine.\\" RK Books published a series called Highlander Imagine. Although technically a fan fiction series written by W.L. Jones and L. Bordini, the series is authorized by Davis-Panzer Productions and StudioCanal Films Ltd. The books depict an alternate continuity where Tessa did not die at the end of the episode \\"The Darkness\\" and explores Duncan's life afterward. The books include Highlander Imagine - For Love's Sake, Highlander Imagine - Beyond Infinity, and Highlander Imagine - Code Name: Immortal. =Comics= Duncan also appears in the Highlander comics. In the fifth issue of the comics he comforts Connor after Brenda Wyatt is injured in a car accident on New Year's Eve in 1986. In another story, collected as Highlander: Dark Quickening, Duncan helps Connor deal with the aftereffects of absorbing the Kurgan's Quickening. Another story, collected as Highlander: Armageddon, Duncan is captured by a renegade Watcher group called the Eye and forced to compete in against other immortal warriors. =Audio plays= Adrian Paul reprises his role as Duncan MacLeod in audio plays produced by Big Finish Productions: The Lesson, Love and Hate, The Secret of the Sword, and Kurgan Rising. One story features a sexually transmitted disease deadly to immortals. In another, an immortal being killed on holy ground seems to upset reality, resurrecting both the Kurgan and Connor MacLeod. Duncan also appears in Highlander: A Celtic Opera, an opera jointly composed by Roger Bellon and Harlan Collins. The opera follows Duncan's banishment from his clan, his relationship with a mortal woman named Aurora who becomes his first wife, and his encounters with an immortal Visigoth named Fritagern. In the end, Duncan beheads Fritagern in the 21st century after the man murders a cloned Aurora on their wedding day. Character development The TV series originally intended to feature Connor MacLeod as the protagonist, picking up seven years after his battle with his enemy the Kurgan at the end of the original Highlander movie. When, film actor Christopher Lambert turned down an offer to reprise the role of Connor for the series, the producers decided to simply recast the role. Adrian Paul auditioned and was cast but then suggested that since Lambert's portrayal of Connor was popular with fans it would be better to create a new character rather than try to replace him. The production agreed that doing this would allow the show more freedom to create its own hero and so it was decided that Adrian Paul would now be playing Connor's student and kinsman Duncan MacLeod. Lambert guest- starred in the show's first episode to show his approval of the new Highlander and to establish their relationship to the audience.Interview With Adrian Paul Like Connor, Duncan shares a love of antiques, collecting mementos from different lifetimes and cultures, and learning about the art and history of different cultures. Connor had been portrayed in the films as someone who had a good sense of humor and cared deeply for some people, but was largely introverted and tried to live quietly without drawing much attention to himself. In contrast, Duncan was made to be more of a swashbuckler, often volunteering to help friends and even sometimes strangers with their problems and protect them from others. With a strong sense of honor and a sometimes stubborn determination to protect and avenge his friends, he is sometimes called a boy scout or compared to a superhero by other characters.Episode \\"Free Fall\\", in Highlander: The Series (season 1) (DVD, David-Panzer Productions, 2001), disc 2. Along with this, he holds harsh judgment against those he considers corrupt or dangerous, even after years or centuries have passed unless he sees proof that they have changed. According to Executive Producer William Panzer, \\"once you've hurt him, he doesn't forget. And immortals have a long time to remember, and sooner or later you will cross his path.\\"Episode \\"For Evil's Sake\\", Bonus Material, Bill Panzer's interview, in Highlander: The Series (season 1) (DVD, David-Panzer Productions, 2001), disc 5. Duncan is more open to love than Connor and the movies reveal he has married or hoped to marry on multiple occasions. He does not take the Game as seriously as Connor and continually hopes he can simply retire from it and never have to worry that one day he may fight his friends. Duncan is often haunted by the loss of those he comes to care for. In the first episode, he remarks, \\"No matter how many years go by or how many times you say goodbye to those you care most about, when they leave, you... When they die, you're naked and alone.\\" Actor Alexandra Vandernoot who played Tessa thought \\"the relationship between Tessa and MacLeod was very deep because very soon, he told her about himself... because he trusted her, and I think trust is a very good definition of their relationship. She trusted him entirely and he trusted her.\\"Alexandra Vandernoot, in Highlander: Counterfeit, Bonus Material, Interviews with Cast and Crew (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2004). Reviewer Rob Lineberger said, \\"Together, they are a model couple. They have healthy banter, intense arguments, plenty of romance, and an easy comfort with each other.\\" Following the death of Tessa, Duncan becomes noticeably more somber and more guarded. Further deaths throughout the series bring him increased feelings of guilt and grief. Associate Creative Consultant Gillian Horvath said, \\"it changed the tone of the show. It made Highlander the show where you couldn't be positive that the characters were safe because they were in the credits.\\"Gillian Horvath, in Tessa's death also gave the show a pessimistic tone that influenced the remaining characters. Lineberger said, \\"Richie and Duncan relate to each other differently from now on, and Duncan is bereft of much of his joy [and] moodier as well. Tessa is no longer around to lighten him.\\" Reception TV Guide ranked Duncan MacLeod # 11 on its \\"25 Greatest Sci-Fi Legends\\" list.

Participants build automotive vehicles to achieve the highest possible fuel efficiency. There are two vehicle classes within Shell Eco-marathon: Prototype and UrbanConcept. There are three energy categories within Shell Eco-marathon: battery-electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and internal combustion engine (gasoline, ethanol, or diesel). Prizes are awarded separately for each vehicle class and energy category. The pinnacle of the competition is the Shell Eco-marathon Drivers' World Championship, where the most energy- efficient UrbanConcept vehicles compete in a race with a limited amount of energy. Shell Eco-marathon competitions are held around the world with nine events as of 2018. The 2018 competition season includes events held in Singapore, California, Paris, London, Istanbul, Johannesburg, Rio de Janeiro, India, and China. Participants are students from various academic backgrounds including university teams such as past finalists University of British Columbia, Duke University, University of Toronto, and University of California, Los Angeles. In 2018, over 5,000 students from over 700 universities in 52 countries participated in Shell Eco-marathon. The digital reach of Shell Eco-marathon is approximately several million. History In 1939, a group of Shell scientists based in a research laboratory in Wood River, Illinois, USA, had a friendly bet to see who could drive their own car furthest on one gallon of fuel. The winner managed a fuel economy of . A repeat of the challenge yielded dramatically improved results over the years: * with a 1947 Studebaker in 1949 * with a 1959 Fiat 600 in 1968 * with a 1959 Opel in 1973. A world record was set by a French team in 2003 called Microjoule with a performance of . The current record is , set in 2005 by the PAC-Car II. The world record in Diesel efficiency was achieved by a team from the Universitat Politècnica de Valencia (Politechnical University of Valencia, Spain) in 2010 with 1396.8 kilometres per litre. In contrast, the most efficient production Diesel passenger cars achieve , and some high-powered sports cars achieve as little as . The current European Shell Eco-marathon record for a combustion engine entry was set in 2004 by the team from Lycée La Joliverie (France) at 3,410 km on the equivalent of a single litre of fuel. Prototype vehicles using fuel cells are capable of greater energy efficiency. In 2005, a hydrogen-powered vehicle built by Swiss team ETH Zurich achieved a projected 3,836 km on the equivalent of a single litre of fuel. This is equivalent to the distance between Paris and Moscow. In 2013, ethanol efficiency world record was set by Toulouse Ingenerie Multidisciplinarie with 3100 km of a single litre of ethanol. This is equivalent to the distance between Toulouse and Istanbul.  Event  The Eco-Marathon has different classes of competition, according to the energy source used: Fuel cells, solar cells, gasoline, Diesel fuel and LPG. During the competition, cars must attain an average speed of at least 15 mph (23 km/h) over a distance of 10 miles (16 km). The course is typically a motor racing track or closed-off city streets. The fuel is strictly measured out for each entrant at the start and end of the course. The difference is used to calculate the vehicle's average fuel consumption. Solar-powered vehicles are not eligible for the grand prize for fuel efficiency. In 2017, more than 100 student teams from many countries across the Americas competed in the Shell-Eco Marathon Americas to a crowd of over 20,000 throughout the competitions at the Cobo Center in Detroit, Michigan. Entrants The top performing vehicles are purpose designed for high efficiency. Some vehicles use a coast and burn technique whereby they briefly accelerate from 10 to 20 mph (from 16 to 32 km/h) and then switch the engine off and coast until the speed drops back down to 10 mph (16 km/h). This process is repeated resulting in average speed of 15 mph for the course. Typically the vehicles have: * Automobile drag coefficients (Cd) below 0.1 * Rolling resistance coefficients less than 0.0015 * Weight without driver under 45 kg * Engine efficiency under 200 specific fuel consumption (cc/bhp/hr) The vehicles are highly specialized and optimized for the event and are not intended for everyday use. The designs represent what can be achieved with current technology and offer a glimpse into the future of car design based on minimal environmental impact in a world with reduced oil reserves. The work of the participants can be used to show ways manufacturers could redesign their products.

China Daily, May 22, 2018. Although not a member of the Qing royal family, Der Ling was given the title of Princess while serving as the first lady-in-waiting for Empress Dowager Cixi. She was a writer of several memoirs, books, and magazine articles. Early life Der Ling's father Yü Keng was a member of the Hanjun Plain White Banner Corps (), and according to his daughter he was a Lord. This is of some doubt. After serving as Chinese minister to Japan, he was appointed minister to the French Third Republic for four years in 1899. He was known for his progressive, reformist views; for his determination to educate his children, including the girls, in western schools, which was highly unusual in their generation; and for his unvarying support of the Empress Dowager Cixi. In 1905, Yü Keng died in Shanghai. Yü Keng's story is told in the movie Dai noi kwan ying. According to Der Ling's biographer, Der Ling's mother had an American father and a Chinese mother. However, in the book, whatever her background, she is repeatedly referred to by other people as a Manchu. Yü Keng's daughters Der Ling and Rong Ling (1889–1973, the future Madame Dan Paochao of Beijing) received a western education, learning French and English, and studying dance in Paris with Isadora Duncan. Lady-in-waiting and later life Upon their return to China, Der Ling became the first lady-in-waiting to the Empress Dowager Cixi, as well as interpreting for her when she received foreign visitors. Der Ling stayed at court until March 1905. In 1907, Der Ling married Thaddeus C. White, an American. Der Ling had a brother, Xunling (ca. 1880–1943), who studied photography in France and later took the only photographs of Empress Dowager Cixi still in existence.PowerPlay: China's Empress Dowager, exhibition at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, September 24, 2011–January 29, 2012 Using the title of Princess, which would create controversy for her in both China and the United States in the future, Der Ling wrote of her experiences in court in her memoir Two Years in the Forbidden City, which was published in 1911. She states in her book that the status of Princess, which the Empress Dowager had given her, was valid only within the palace. As the Guangxu Emperor, who was under a form of house arrest, never confirmed the title, it was not valid in the outside world. Two Years provides unique insights into life at the Manchu court and the character of the Empress Dowager Empress, a world that ended abruptly with the 1911 revolution that overthrew the Manchu or Qing dynasty. Der Ling continued to write and published seven more books. Der Ling was not a member of the Qing royal family. Although Der Ling claimed to be an ethnic Manchu, her father Yü Keng was actually a Han Chinese Bannerman and not part of the ethnic Manchu Banners. Her father was not royal but was a bannerman, just as Der Ling claimed she was a Manchu while she was actually a Chinese Bannerwoman. Death Princess Der Ling, a.k.a. Mrs. Thaddeus C. White, died in Berkeley, California, as a result of being struck by a car while crossing an intersection. She had recently taught Chinese at University of California, Berkeley.\\"Princess Der Ling Dies in Berkeley of Car Injuries\\" (obituary). Los Angeles Times, November 23, 1944. Memoirs and writings Princess Der Ling beside Cixi After Cixi's death in 1908, Der Ling professed to be so angered by what she saw as false portraits of Cixi appearing in books and periodicals that she wrote her own account of serving \\"Old Buddha\\", which she called \\"Two Years in the Forbidden City\\". This book appeared in 1911, just before the fall of the Qing dynasty, and was a popular success. In this book, Cixi is not the monster of depravity depicted in the popular press and in the second and third hand accounts left by foreigners who had lived in Beijing, but an aging woman who loved beautiful things, had many regrets about the past and the way she had dealt with the many crises of her long reign, and apparently trusted Der Ling enough to share many memories and opinions with her. Der Ling would go on to write seven more books about this relatively brief period in her youth when she had been close to the heart of declining imperial Chinese power, and sharing this personal history and her habit of promoting herself and her writings caused most of her family to turn against her. All of this has made it difficult to assess Der Ling's contribution to late Qing historiography. But the fact remains that she was the first woman of Cixi's own ethnic background to live with and observe her and then write about what it was like; if many of Der Ling's recollections smack of the every day minutiae of a court that thrived on details and form, her writings are no less valuable for focusing on them, particularly as life within the Forbidden City and the Summer Palace was a closed book for most people in China, let alone in the rest of the world. Her opinion was that it was misunderstanding of much of what emanated from the throne that created so many of the problems Cixi has been wholly blamed for; historians. =Works= Books * Two Years in the Forbidden City (1911) *Old Buddha (1928), with preface by Arthur J.

As in an earlier book, The Alchemist, The Zahir is about a pilgrimage. The book touches on themes of love, loss and obsession. The Zahir was written in Coelho's native language, Portuguese, and it has been translated into 44 languages. The book was first published in Iran, in Persian translation, by Caravan publishing. Iran has never signed any international copyright agreements. By being published first in Iran, the book falls under the national copyright law of Iran. This copyright measure created an unusual situation where a book is first published in a language other than the author's native language. However, the book was banned in Iran a few months after its publication, during the 18th Tehran International Book Fair.Iran 'bans author Coelho's novel', BBC News Intended as a work of fiction, the story has strong autobiographical features, which led to an attack on the book's shallow egotism in the English press.Paulo Coelho hurtling towards stupidity as he reaches for wisdom in The Zahir - The Observer. Coelho named British war correspondent and author Christina Lamb as the inspiration for the character Esther in The Zahir.  Plot  The Zahir means 'the obvious' or 'conspicuous' in Arabic. The story revolves around the life of the narrator, a bestselling novelist, and in particular his search for his missing wife, Esther. He enjoys all the privileges that money and celebrity bring. He is suspected of foul play by both the police and the press, who suspect that he may have had a role in the inexplicable disappearance of his wife from their Paris home. As a result of this disappearance, the protagonist is forced to re-examine his own life as well as his marriage. The narrator is unable to figure out what led to Esther's disappearance. Was she abducted or had she abandoned the marriage? He encounters Mikhail, one of Esther's friends, during a book launch. He learns from Mikhail that Esther, who had been a war correspondent against the wishes of her husband (the protagonist), had left in a search for peace, as she had trouble living with her husband. The author eventually realizes that in order to find Esther he must first find his own self. Mikhail introduces him to his own beliefs and customs, his mission of spreading love by holding sessions in restaurants and meeting homeless people living in the streets. He tells the narrator about the voices he hears, and his beliefs related to them. The narrator, who only too frequently falls in love with women, consults with his current lover, Marie, about his encounters with Mikhail. She warns him that Mikhail could be an epileptic. However, she also advises him to search for the Zahir as is his desire, even though she would prefer him to stay with her. The narrator eventually decides to go in search of his Zahir. As it was Esther who had initially brought Mikhail from Kazakhstan to France, the protagonist suspects that she may in fact be in Kazakhstan. At first, he is curious about what made Esther leave, but later he realizes that troubles in her relationship with her husband may have been a major reason. As he discovers, she was interested in getting to know herself through the making of carpets. Eventually the narrator meets his Zahir and the outcome of this meeting constitutes the climax of the book. Through the narrator's journey from Paris to Kazakhstan, Coelho explores the various meanings of love and life. In a recurring theme in the book, CoelhoPaulo Coelho's official site compares marriage with a set of railway tracks which stay together forever but fail to come any closer. The novel is a journey from a stagnant marriage and love to the realization of unseen but ever increasing attraction between two souls.

The canvases were produced in 1732–1734, then engraved in 1734 and published in print form in 1735.For the prints, see Ronald Paulson, Hogarth's Graphic Works, 3rd edition (London: The Print Room 1989), nos. 132-139. The series shows the decline and fall of Tom Rakewell, the spendthrift son and heir of a rich merchant, who comes to London, wastes all his money on luxurious living, prostitution and gambling, and as a consequence is imprisoned in the Fleet Prison and ultimately Bethlem Hospital (Bedlam).Bindman, David. Hogarth, Thames and Hudson, 1981. The original paintings are in the collection of Sir John Soane's Museum in London, where they are normally on display for a short period each day. The filmmaker Alan Parker has described the works as an ancestor to the storyboard.Life: The Observer Magazine – A celebration of 500 years of British Art – 19 March 2000 Paintings =I – The Heir= In the first painting, Tom has come into his fortune on the death of his miserly father. While the servants mourn, he is measured for new clothes. Although he has had a common-law marriage with her, he now rejects the hand of his pregnant fiancée, Sarah Young, whom he had promised to marry (she holds his ring and her mother holds his love letters). He pays her off, but she still loves him, as becomes clear in the fourth painting. Evidence of the father's miserliness abound: his portrait above the fireplace shows him counting money; symbols of hospitality (a jack and spit) have been locked up at upper right; the coat of arms shows three clamped vises with the motto \\"Beware\\"; a half-starved cat reveals the father kept little food in the house, while lack of ashes in the fireplace demonstrates that he rarely spent money on wood to heat his home. The engraving (right), which is reversed left-to-right compared to the painting, shows the father went so far as to resole his shoes with a piece of leather cut from a Bible cover. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  The Heir  The Heir (engraving) } =II – The Levée= In the second painting, Tom is at his morning levée in London, attended by musicians and other hangers-on all dressed in expensive costumes. Surrounding Tom from left to right: a music master at a harpsichord, who was supposed to represent George Frideric Handel; a fencing master; a quarterstaff instructor; a dancing master with a violin; a landscape gardener, Charles Bridgeman; an ex-soldier offering to be a bodyguard; a bugler of a fox hunt club. At lower right is a jockey with a silver trophy. The quarterstaff instructor looks disapprovingly on both the fencing and dancing masters. Both masters appear to be in the \\"French\\" style, which was a subject Hogarth loathed. Upon the wall, between paintings of roosters (emblems of cockfighting), there is a painting of the Judgement of Paris. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\" The Levée The Levée (engraving) } =III – The Orgy= The third painting depicts a wild party or orgy underway at a brothel. The prostitutes are stealing the drunken Tom's watch. On the floor at bottom right is a night watchman's staff and lantern — souvenirs of Tom's 'wild night' on the town. The scene takes place at the Rose Tavern, a famous brothel in Covent Garden. The prostitutes have black spots on their faces to cover syphilitic sores. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\" The Orgy The Orgy (engraving) } =IV – The Arrest= In the fourth, he narrowly escapes arrest for debt by Welsh bailiffs (as signified by the leeks, a Welsh emblem, in their hats) as he travels in a sedan chair to a party at St. James's Palace to celebrate Queen Caroline's birthday on Saint David's Day (Saint David is the patron saint of Wales). On this occasion he is saved by the intervention of Sarah Young, the girl he had earlier rejected; she is apparently a dealer in millinery. In comic relief, a man filling a street lantern spills the oil on Tom's head. This is a sly reference to how blessings on a person were accompanied by oil poured on the head; in this case, the 'blessing' being the 'saving' of Tom by Sarah, although Rakewell, being a rake, will not take the moral lesson to heart. In the engraved version, lightning flashes in the sky and a young pickpocket has just emptied Tom's pocket. The painting, however, shows the young thief stealing Tom's cane, and has no lightning. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\" The Arrest The Arrest (engraving) } =V – The Marriage= In the fifth, Tom attempts to salvage his fortune by marrying a rich but aged and ugly old maid at St Marylebone. In the background, Sarah arrives, holding their child while her indignant mother struggles with a guest. It looks as though Tom's eyes are already upon the pretty maid to his new wife's left during the nuptials. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\" The Marriage The Marriage (engraving) } =VI – The Gaming House= The sixth painting shows Tom pleading for the assistance of the Almighty in a gambling den at White's club in Soho after losing his reacquired wealth. Neither he nor the other obsessive gamblers seem to have noticed a fire that is breaking out behind them. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\" The Gaming House The Gaming House (engraving) } =VII – The Prison= All is lost by the seventh painting, and Tom is incarcerated in the notorious Fleet debtors' prison. He ignores the distress of both his angry new wife and faithful Sarah, who cannot help him this time. Both the beer-boy and jailer demand money from him. Tom begins to go mad, as indicated by both a telescope for celestial observation poking out of the barred window (an apparent reference to the longitude rewards offered by the British government) and an alchemy experiment in the background. Beside Tom is a rejected play; another inmate is writing a pamphlet on how to solve the national debt. Above the bed at right is an apparatus for wings, which is more clearly seen in the engraved version at the left. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\" The Prison The Prison (engraving) } =VIII – The Madhouse= Finally insane and violent, in the eighth painting he ends his days in Bethlem Hospital (Bedlam), London's infamous mental asylum. Only Sarah Young is there to comfort him, but Rakewell continues to ignore her. While some of the details in these pictures may appear disturbing to 21st-century eyes, they were commonplace in Hogarth's day. For example, the fashionably dressed women in this last painting have come to the asylum as a social occasion, to be entertained by the bizarre antics of the inmates. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\" The Madhouse The Madhouse (engraving) } Engravings Hogarth published engravings of the paintings on 25 June 1735, the day that the Engravers' Copyright Act became law. The composition of several of the engravings is reversed from the paintings, due to the printing process. Adaptations Gavin Gordon composed a 1935 ballet titled The Rake's Progress, based directly on Hogarth's paintings. It was choreographed by Ninette de Valois, designed by Rex Whistler, has been recorded several times, and remains in the repertoires of various ballet companies. The 1945 British comedy-drama film The Rake's Progress, released in the US as Notorious Gentleman, is loosely based on the paintings. The 1946 RKO film Bedlam, produced by Val Lewton and directed by Mark Robson, was inspired by A Rake's Progress. Hogarth received a writing credit for the film. Igor Stravinsky's 1951 opera The Rake's Progress, with a libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is loosely based on the story from Hogarth's paintings. In 1961, David Hockney created his own print edition version of The Rake's Progress; he has also created stage designs for the Stravinsky Opera. In 2012, English artist Grayson Perry created a series of tapestries named The Vanity of Small Differences, an adaptation of Hogarth's originals. In 2014 Ulrike Theusner created a version Ulrike Theusner: A Rake’s Progress (drawings) on the website of the artist ulrike-theusner.de. with eight paintings accompanied by copper engravings on the same themes. The British artist Henry Hudson depicted the rake in his 2015 show at the Sotheby's S2 gallery.

In an extreme example, it could literally be a flashing arrow pointing at the object, but the term is usually metaphorical, referring to visual focus and/or accompanying sound effects or music. The term is often used disapprovingly, in reference to works for unsophisticated audiences.https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1036&context;=communication_diss Example of this include: a camera close-up in a horror movie that suggests information such as danger from an unlocked door; a scene in an action film in which the hero is in a difficult-to-escape situation, a brief cut to a shot of the item they will use to save themselves; and recurring mundane shots of a person or thing, with the repetition indicating that it will become important later. An example of repetition as a form of flashing arrow is in the film Natural Born Killers during a scene in which the protagonist stabs to death a young woman with a pencil; the pencil shows up in nearly every cut scene before the girl's death. In the film Stranger than Fiction, the child with a bike and the bus driver appear in numerous scenes before both of them become a factor in Harold Crick's \\"death\\". A literal flashing arrow is used occasionally, such as in the 1981 film Student Bodies to mock it as a cliché. http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/public/tv-smarter-johnson.html This is mentioned in Everything Bad Is Good for You, where the authors says works that have little use of this and require figuring things out yourself have a more deductive viewer base. Another example is in the anime Ouran High School Host Club, where it is used repeatedly, for instance in the first episode, in which a flashing arrow and high-pitched beeping noise indicate a vase that a character breaks later in the scene. The technique is sometimes used in other media as well. With the more limited cinematic framing options of video games, the important object or clue may itself glow or flash to draw attention to it. In comics, the technique may be performed by including a single panel focusing on the object, or by a literal arrow pointing to it.

Walid, his father and uncle were the three champions of the Meccan army in duel against Hamza ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib, Ali ibn Abi Talib, and Ubaydah ibn al-Harith. In the combat duel, Walid was killed by Ali, Walid's father was killed by Hamza, and then his uncle Shaibah was killed by Ubaydah.

She was inducted into both the Canadian and American Racing Halls of Fame. Bred in Ontario by Ernie Samuel's Sam-Son Farm, Dance Smartly was a bay mare with a distinctive white star on her forehead that earned her the nickname Daisy. She was by Danzig, one of Northern Dancer's most influential sire sons. Her dam was the Canadian Hall of Fame mare Classy 'n Smart by Smarten. She was trained by Jim Day. Racing career As a two-year-old, Dance Smartly won three of five races, including the Natalma Stakes, and finished third in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies. She won the Sovereign Award for Canadian champion two-year- old filly. At age three, she developed into one of the top Thoroughbreds in North America, going undefeated in the 1991 racing season. In her first two starts of the year, she was ridden by Brian Swatuk to easy victories in the Star Shoot and Selene Stakes. In the remainder of her three-year-old campaign, she was ridden by American Hall of Fame jockey Pat Day. Her victory in the Canadian Oaks, Canada's most important race for three-year-old fillies, was so dominant that her owner decided to race her next against the colts. Dance Smartly became the second filly (after Queensway in 1932) to capture the Canadian Triple Crown by winning the Queen's Plate, the Prince of Wales Stakes, and the Breeders' Stakes by a combined eighteen lengths. She next won the Molson Export Million, earning her first graded stakes victory as her previous races had been restricted to Canadian-bred horses. Preparing for the Breeders' Cup Distaff at Churchill Downs, Dance Smartly started favouring her front hoof and missed several weeks of training. Despite coming into the race with only one workout in six weeks, she won easily, defeating champion older mare Queena and Versailles Treaty. Track announcer Tom Durkin called her \\"undefeated this year, and the undisputed queen of racing on this continent.\\" For her 1991 performances, Dance Smartly was voted the Eclipse Award as North America's best three-year-old filly plus two Sovereign Awards as Canada's best three-year-old filly and the Horse of the Year. Despite being hampered by an injury to the suspensory ligament of her right foreleg, Dance Smartly raced four more times at age four, winning once against colts in the Canadian Maturity Stakes. She also finished second by a nose in the King Edward Cup Handicap and third in the Grade I Beverly D. She then retired as the number one money-winning filly in the world, having won on both turf and dirt, and at distances of up to miles. Stud record As a broodmare at Sam-Son Farm, Dance Smartly produced a number of top horses, including the back-to-back Queen's Plate winners Scatter the Gold and Dancethruthedawn (who also won the Go For Wand Handicap), both by Mr. Prospector. She was named the 2001 Canadian Broodmare of the Year. Dance Smartly was euthanized in August 2007 after suffering an irreparable injury related to an arthritic stifle in her paddock at Sam-Son Farm. She was 19 years old and not in foal at the time. \\"Dance Smartly was a once in a lifetime horse,\\" said Tammy Samuel-Balaz, the daughter of Dance Smartly's owner. \\"She was magic and gave us incredible thrills as both a racehorse and a broodmare. While we were fortunate enough to have bred and owned her, she was truly Canada's horse.\\" Honours Dance Smartly was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 1995 and into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame at Saratoga Springs, New York in 2003. In 1996, the Dance Smartly Stakes was created in her honour. Pedigree Dance Smartly was by Danzig, the leading sire in North America from 1991 to 1993. Her dam was Classy 'n Smart, who won the Canadian Oaks and was named the Canadian champion three-year-old in 1984. Classy 'n Smart produced several other stakes winners including Smart Strike, a grade I winner and two-time leading sire in North America. Dance Smartly's second dam No Class was the foundation mare of Sam-Son Farms, producing six stakes winners and four champions including Sky Classic. No Class, Classy 'n Smart and Dance Smartly were each named Canadian Broodmare of the Year.

It is the junction where the line splits into the line to Aberystwyth and the Cambrian Coast Line to Pwllheli. Passenger services are provided by Transport for Wales. There is a single island platform. The station is in Powys, about NE of the junction of three counties: the current principal areas of Ceredigion, Powys and Gwynedd, corresponding to the traditional counties of Cardiganshire, Montgomeryshire and Merionethshire. The station is in the midst of the large Dyfi National Nature Reserve, near the Cardigan Bay coast. There is no settlement here but, contrary to common belief, it is not completely isolated: a footpath provides passenger access to and from the hamlet of Glandyfi in Ceredigion and a main road (the A487). History The station was opened in 1863 as Glandovey Junction. It was renamed Dovey Junction in 1904. The station has been rebuilt twice in recent years: the original Cambrian Railways buildings were first replaced in the 1970s by a flat-roofed station building. This building was subsequently replaced in the 1990s by a simple bus shelter, having fallen into a state of disrepair and being far larger than required at this remote location. The station platforms were raised in 2008 in conjunction with raising of the tracks, to reduce the likelihood of closure of this section of line due to flooding. The work was part of a major programme of work on the Cambrian Line, including ERTMS signalling to replace the previous RETB system and an extended (dynamic) passing loop at Welshpool to permit running an hourly service from Shrewsbury-Aberystwyth in the future. Dovey Junction is often quoted as a defining feature of the Great Western Railway in Wales: its inheritance of junctions in unlikely and inconvenient locations. Other examples are Moat Lane Junction, Talyllyn Junction, Afon Wen and Barmouth Junction (renamed Morfa Mawddach in 1960). Services Trains call at least every two hours in each direction throughout the day (Mon–Sat), rising to once an hour during the morning and afternoon peaks and into the early evening. Platform 2 (east side) is used by services to/from and and platform 1 (west side) by trains along the coast to and . Most trains serve both branches, with units joining or dividing at to make a 4-coach set east of there, though some trains (especially on Sundays) run between Birmingham or Shrewsbury and Aberystwyth only (some trains on both branches also start or end at Machynlleth). On Sundays, there is a 2-hourly service between Shrewsbury and Aberystwyth all year, plus 3 trains each way in summer to/from Pwllheli but just a single train each way in the winter months.

It is long and carries the Cambrian Line. It is the longest timber viaduct in Wales and one of the oldest in regular use in Britain. Barmouth Bridge was designed by and constructed for the Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway on its line between Aberystwyth and Pwllheli. Work was authorised in 1861 and commenced in 1864. On 10 October 1867, the completed bridge was officially opened. Following the discovery of severe corrosion on underwater sections of ironwork, an intensive restoration programme was performed between December 1899 and late 1902. By 1980, the viaduct was under attack by marine woodworm, which led to concerns that it would have to be closed and demolished. Because of its value to tourism, it was repaired between 1985 and 1986 when it was closed for six months. Since 2005, weight restriction on the bridge have been relaxed, allowing locomotive-hauled trains to cross for the first time in two decades. The bridge between and in Gwynedd, is used by rail, cyclists and pedestrians and is part of the National Cycle Network. To allow the passage of tall ships, the bridge incorporated a drawbridge, which was replaced between 1899 and 1902 by a swing bridge which is no longer operational due to a lack of demand. There is no provision for road traffic. Tolls were collected for foot and cycle traffic up to 2013 but this has been voluntary since 2017. Location The north end of the crossing has a swing bridge section to allow tall ships to pass, though it has not seen regular use since testing in the 1980s. Barmouth Bridge crosses the estuary of the River Mawddach between Morfa Mawddach near Arthog on the south and Barmouth. The line was operated by Arriva Trains Wales until 2018, and is now operated by Transport for Wales, which provides connecting services south to Aberystwyth and east to Welshpool and Shrewsbury. The bridge is on the Cambrian Coast railway between Machynlleth and Pwllheli. It is long, and is made up of 113 wooden trestles, supported by cast iron piers. It is one of the longest timber viaducts standing in Britain, and is a Grade II* listed structure. Most of the bridge is built on top of a gravel bed, covered by shifting sand. The northern end of the viaduct, where the swing bridge is located, is next to Figle Fawr a rock at the base of the Rhinogydd mountain. Water passing through the channel flows at up to 9 knots (16.7 km/h). The first two spans at this end are built on the rock on cast iron cylindrical piers. The steel swing bridge section, which replaced the original drawbridge, was last opened (for testing) in April 1987. The installation of continuous rail across the movable section now prevents its movement, and the passage of tall ships in and out of the estuary. The nearest road across the Afon Mawddach is the toll bridge at Penmaenpool about upstream, which can carry vehicles up to 2.5 tonnes. Heavier vehicles must use the first public road bridge, at Dolgellau, about from Barmouth. Pedestrians, cyclists and motorcycles can cross the estuary via the footbridge on the bridge's eastern side. Since 1996, the footbridge has been part of the National Cycle Route linking North and South Wales. The footbridge is owned by Network Rail, and Gwynedd County Council contributes 10 per cent of its annual maintenance in exchange for a licence to use it. History =Background and construction= Illustration of the estuary and bridge, circa 1869 A bridge across the Mawddach Estuary at Barmouth was proposed by the Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway, who constructed a line between Aberystwyth and Pwllheli. Authorisation for the railway was received in 1861 - 2 and the detailed design of the bridge was started. Barmouth Bridge was designed by the civil engineers Benjamin Piercy and Henry Conybeare. Conybeare wanted a timber viaduct because it was about four times cheaper to import wood from the Baltic by sea than to construct an iron bridge. The decision was influenced by the incorrect belief that the estuary was free from marine borers, which attack and weaken the timber over time. During this era, timber pile viaducts were commonplace on coastal railways, particularly in Wales, although the bridge at Barmouth would be longer than most. Construction began in 1864. The contractor was Thomas Savin, and the ironwork was produced by John Cochrane & Sons. Early on, progress was hindered by strong tidal currents which caused multiple failed attempts to sink the bridge's piers from barges. Between March and June 1866, staging was built from the northern abutment for the bridge, and the piers were dropped into the water and filled with concrete. A steam-hauled train traversing Barmouth Bridge, circa 1921 Wooden trestles were built on screw piles - wide with screw discs in diameter in groups of three piles per pier. Timber trellis girders, long and deep, supported the deck, with driven piles as fenders. The water around the trestles had a maximum depth of at spring tides but the river bed was raised by tipping stones to protect the piles. The viaduct had a wooden drawbridge near its northern end allowing tall ships to pass upstream. The drawbridge span, which was carried on top of wrought iron piles, opened by tilting and rolling back over the track on four wheels, spaced apart, and nine steel rollers. When opened, there was a gap between the fenders. The drawbridge never regularly used as the opening of the railway effectively eliminated the need for traditional boat traffic. On 3 June 1867, horse-drawn carriages crossed the viaduct. On 10 October, the bridge was officially opened, and steam-hauled services started. =Operational life= Underside view of the bridge and its piers. Note the concrete reinforcement towards the base of the wooden piers In August 1899, Alfred Jones Collin, the chief engineer of the Cambrian Railways ordered underwater inspections to check the integrity of the drawbridge span’s ironwork. They discovered that the supports were severely corroded, undermining its structural integrity and requiring the replacement of all the ironwork except for two piers. A temporary speed limit of , later reduced to , was put in place while repairs were made. Repairs started that December and were completed by the end of 1902. The drawbridge was replaced with a swing bridge with a single steel swing span, 41.5 meters long, which rotated around a central pivot, adjacent to a 36 meter-long fixed span. The spans are hogback lattice trusses, supported by pairs of cylindrical iron piers, and the turntable rests on a cluster of four piers. In 1946, the bridge was nearly destroyed after a live naval mine was washed ashore close to it during stormy weather. According to reports, the mine had swept past one of the pillars, but did not detonate and the bridge escaped unscathed. View of the bridge from the northwest in 2014 Following the Beeching cuts of the 1960s, passenger train services declined after the closure of the Ruabon to Barmouth line via Llangollen and Dolgellau in 1965, causing all traffic to take the longer and slower route from Shrewsbury via Machynlleth and Dovey Junction. The old trackbed from Morfa Mawddach railway station to Dolgellau now forms the Mawddach Trail, a walking and cycle trail. By 1980, the bridge was under attack from marine woodworm and the resulting damage was serious enough to threaten its closure. British Rail discovered that woodworm had eaten into 69 of the supporting pillars and estimated that it would cost around £2.5 million to repair. Locomotive-hauled trains were banned, which resulted in the loss of traffic from Tywyn, including explosives traffic to and from the factory at Penrhyndeudraeth which was re-routed via Maentwrog Road railway station and the Conwy Valley Line. Gwynedd County Council opposed closing the bridge as 40% of all railway traffic in the area was tourist related. The government applied for a £2.5 million grant from the European Economic Community (EEC) to finance repairs, and £4.6 million was spent on signalling improvements upon the line. The bridge was closed to traffic for six months during the repair works and 30 of the piles were replaced. Barmouth Bridge toll prices in 2007, before the toll was removed. On 13 April 1986, a British Rail Class 37 diesel locomotive number 37427 was named \\"Bont Y Bermo\\" to celebrate the re-introduction of locomotive-hauled trains following repairs in 1985–1986. Locomotive-hauled trains were forbidden shortly afterwards after weight restrictions were imposed upon all bridge traffic. After major repairs in 2005, the weight restriction was relaxed and locomotive-hauled trains are allowed to cross. In March 2013, the Barmouth Viaduct Access Group (B-VAG), was established to investigate an alternative route from the town centre to the bridge, as the walkway is steep, narrow, and unsuitable for buggies or wheelchairs. In June, the bridge toll was removed after the collectors left and were not replaced. The council is undecided as to how to pay for maintenance costs, which were £39,405 for the year. This is problematic as revenue from tolls is insufficient to cover the council's share of costs, and there is no budget to employ staff to collect payments. Gwynedd Council proposed closing the bridge to pedestrians and cyclists for cost reasons, as it needed to find £9 million of savings by April 2016. Closing the bridge is one of over 100 cost saving options totalling £13 million that were put to a public consultation in Autumn 2015. The council pays Network Rail £30,800 per year towards maintenance costs. A petition calling on the council to \\"cease considerations of closing this much loved walking and cycling route\\" attracted 20,000 signatures in a week. In February 2016, it was reported that the bridge would not close. On 4 October 2016, Barmouth Bridge was closed to traffic for a week following a fire on the structure.\\"Fire on Barmouth Bridge viaduct leads to rail disruption.\\" BBC News, 4 October 2016. The following day, MP Liz Saville Roberts lobbied for its speedy renovation as a matter of urgency.\\"Fire-hit Barmouth Bridge 'Renovations Urgent' says MP.\\" Daily Post, 5 October 2016. The viaduct celebrated its 150th anniversary in October 2017 with a fireworks display and special charter trains were run. The same month, Bill Kelly, the chief operating officer of Network Rail Wales, spoke of unapproved ambitions to spend around £20 million to secure the long-term future of Barmouth Bridge between 2019 and 2024. In late 2017, an \\"honesty toll\\" of £1 for adults and 50p for children was introduced with a troll mascot, and the old toll house rebranded as a \\"troll house\\". In December 2018 it was reported that the future of the bridge is once again in doubt. In May 2020, a £25m restoration was announced by Network Rail.https://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/news/network-rail-begins- biggest-restoration-of-barmouth-viaduct-in-its-history See also * List of bridges in Wales * Pont Briwet, a former 19th-century timber viaduct built by the Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway.

Roosevelt East River Drive) is a limited-access parkway on the east side of the New York City borough of Manhattan. It starts near South and Broad Streets, just north of the Battery Park Underpass, and runs north along the East River to the 125th Street / Robert F. Kennedy Bridge / Willis Avenue Bridge interchange, where it becomes the Harlem River Drive. All of the FDR Drive is designated New York State Route 907L (NY 907L), an unsigned reference route. The FDR Drive features a mix of below-grade, at-grade, and elevated sections, as well as three partially covered tunnels. The parkway is mostly three lanes in each direction, with the exception of several small sections. By law, the current weight limits on the FDR Drive from 23rd Street to the Harlem River Drive in both directions is posted . Buses are not allowed to use the roadway north of 23rd Street because they exceed the road's maximum clearance and weight (although some do). All commercial vehicles (including trucks) are banned from all sections of the FDR Drive, except for a short section just north of the Battery Park Underpass where the northbound lanes temporarily merge with South Street. Route description The East River Greenway runs below, beside, or above the FDR Drive along nearly its entire length, except for a section between 38th and 60th Streets. A plaque dedicating the East River Drive is visible on the southbound roadway before entering the Gracie Mansion tunnel at 90th Street. =Downtown= FDR Drive approaching the Brooklyn Bridge FDR Drive starts at the southern tip of Manhattan at South and Whitehall Streets in the Financial District. It rises from the underground Battery Park Underpass to an elevated viaduct above South Street, with an at-grade connection to South Street at exit 1. The elevated viaduct continues northeast, with an interchange at Brooklyn Bridge at exit 2. The elevated road, also known as the South Street Viaduct, continues until Gouverneur Slip, near the Manhattan Bridge interchange (exit 3), where there is a southbound exit and northbound entrance. From here, the road is at-grade, with a southbound exit/entrance at Grand Street, exit 4. The FDR Drive continues north through Lower East Side and Alphabet City, and dips under Houston Street at exit 5, in a three-way interchange. It continues north as an at-grade road. Between 14th and 15th Streets, the FDR Drive passes a large Con Edison substation. The substation is surrounded by ramps for the former exit 6, a southbound exit and entrance which was closed after September 11, 2001. By 18th Street, the FDR Drive curves north onto an elevated viaduct above Avenue C. The elevated viaduct continues until 25th Street in order to serve the 23rd Street interchange at exit 7. This exit serves the neighborhood of Kips Bay. At 23rd Street, Avenue C continues as the northbound service road for the FDR Drive, while the southbound lanes split from the main highway at 25th Street. =Midtown= FDR Drive northbound approaching the NY 25 (Queensboro Bridge) interchange The FDR Drive continues north as an at-grade road, with the Waterside Plaza complex located along the East River to the east of the parkway. The southbound lanes ascend to a viaduct at 28th Street, and the southbound lanes ascend at 30th Street. There is a southbound entrance and northbound exit at ground level at 28th-30th Streets, where the southbound service road begins again. The northbound exit, labeled exit 8, serves 34th Street in Murray Hill, which is located four blocks north; the FDR Drive service road curves underneath the main highway until 36th Street. Another southbound entrance is located at 34th Street itself, and rises to the viaduct level. At 38th Street, the northbound-only exit 9 for 42nd Street, serving Turtle Bay, splits from FDR Drive. Exit 9 continues as an elevated ramp until the intersection of 42nd Street and First Avenue, where it becomes the westbound lanes of 42nd Street. The FDR Drive dips onto street level and merges with the northbound service road. The southbound service road continues parallel to the FDR Drive, and the southbound exit 8 splits from the parkway near 41st Street. The southbound service road then becomes the eastbound lanes of 42nd Street. The headquarters of the United Nations was constructed on a platform above the at-grade FDR Drive from 42nd to 48th Streets. The southbound roadway is inside a later structure resembling a tunnel while the northbound roadway is located just outside of the tunnel. This section is often referred to as the United Nations Tunnel, even though only the westernmost lane of the northbound roadway is under the structure. At 48th Street, the FDR Drive emerges from the United Nations tunnel. A northbound ramp from First Avenue merges onto the northbound roadway. The southbound roadway contains two exits: exit 10 at 49th Street, and exit 11 at 53rd Street. At 54th Street, the road enters the Sutton Place Tunnel, which passes under apartment buildings on the east side of Sutton Place and York Avenue until 60th Street. In this tunnel, the southbound roadway is raised and runs over the northbound roadway for northbound access to and from the Queensboro Bridge interchange (exit 12). As part of the design in this area, numerous homes on the river were demolished and rebuilt or otherwise modified to accommodate the highway. At 63rd Street, the southbound lanes descend to ground level, at the same elevation as the northbound lanes. =Uptown= From 63rd to 71st Streets, the FDR Drive passes under a series of interconnected at-grade tunnels. The segment from 63rd to 68th Street runs under an annex constructed by Rockefeller University, while the section of roadway between 68th and 71st Streets runs underneath the pilotis of the NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital. Afterward, the FDR Drive continues north at ground level. There is a southbound-only entrance and exit, labeled exit 13, at 71st–73rd Streets, serving Lenox Hill on the Upper East Side. Another southbound-only entrance exists at 79th Street; there is no exit from either direction, nor is there any exit number reserved for this interchange. FDR Drive at night From 81st to 90th streets runs a final, enclosed double-decker structure. The southbound roadway is again raised over the northbound roadway in a short segment of the tunnel between 81st and 86th Streets. The promenade of Carl Schurz Park was built over the highway in 1939, near Gracie Mansion, the New York City mayor's residence. There is a southbound entrance to the FDR Drive at the intersection of 92nd Street and York Avenue. York Avenue then parallels the FDR Drive until 96th Street, where York Avenue ends. The FDR Drive ascends onto a short elevated viaduct over the 96th Street interchange (exit 14) then descends to street level again. The remaining portion of the FDR Drive to the 125th Street interchange (exit 19) is at grade, passing through East Harlem. There is a southbound-only entrance at 102nd Street, as well as a southbound-only exit at 106th Street, labeled exit 15. At 116th Street, there is another southbound- only exit and entrance numbered exit 16. When the FDR Drive reaches 120th Street, there are three northbound exits in quick succession: exit 17 for the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, exit 18 for the Willis Avenue Bridge, and exit 19 for 125th Street. Exit 17 also contains a southbound exit and entrance to and from the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, and exit 19 also hosts a southbound entrance. The FDR Drive transitions into the Harlem River Drive and continues north after 125th Street. History Looking north from 6th Street overpass A shorefront parkway in Manhattan along the East River was first proposed by Manhattan Borough President Julius Miller in 1929. The parkway would extend from South Street to 54th Street. The first sections of the East River Drive were constructed in the 1930s and were designed by Robert Moses. Moses faced the difficulties of building a parkway/boulevard combination along the East River while minimizing disruptions to residents. Many property owners along the East River Drive, especially in Midtown, opposed the boulevard unless noise mitigation measures were added. The section from 125th Street and the Triborough Bridge ramp south to 92nd Street was completed in 1936. The sections from 92nd Street down to Battery Park (with the exception of a section from 42nd to 49th Streets, located underneath the headquarters of the United Nations) were built as a boulevard running at street level. The first \\"downtown\\" section of the boulevard, between Grand and 12th Streets, was completed in June 1937. Two more downtown sections, from 12th to 14th Streets and then from 14th to 18th Streets, were opened in 1939. A short connector from Grand to Montgomery Street was completed in May 1940, which meant that the boulevard was now continuous from Montgomery to 30th Streets. The next month, a large stretch from 49th to 92nd Streets opened. By this point, the only contiguous section that remained to be completed was the stretch between 30th and 49th Streets. Around this time, city officials started making plans for reconstructing existing sections of the boulevard so that several intersections would be grade-separated or double-decked. A plan to build a three-level section from 81st to 89th Streets was released in April 1940, followed by an East River Drive overpass over 96th Street in June. Due to a bulkhead restriction, a section from 51st to 60th Streets was already being built with two decks. The section of the East River Drive from 23rd to 34th Streets was completed in October 1941. It was built on wartime rubble dumped by cargo ships returning from Bristol, England, during World War II. The German Luftwaffe bombed Bristol heavily. After delivering war supplies to the British, the ships' crews loaded rubble onto the ships for ballast, then sailed back to New York, where construction crews made use of it. The final part of the original boulevard, between 34th and 49th Streets, opened in May 1942. Future reconstruction designs from 1948 to 1966 converted the FDR Drive into the full parkway that is in use today. Upon the death of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1945, the East River Drive was renamed the FDR Drive in June of that year. The drive is now commonly called the \\"FDR Drive\\". An elevated ramp between 18th and 25th Streets, serving as an extension of the highway south of 23rd Street, was completed in 1949, replacing an at-grade section. Another elevated highway above South Street, connecting the at-grade parkway north of Grand Street to the Battery Park Underpass and Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel at the southern tip of Manhattan, was completed in May 1954. Southbound viaduct at 28th Street in Kips Bay In Kips Bay, the FDR Drive is located on a viaduct between 30th and 37th Streets. The southbound and northbound roadways rise onto a viaduct separately between 28th and 30th Streets; the southbound roadway ascends onto the viaduct at 28th Street, followed by the northbound roadway at 30th Street, and the two roadways merge into a single structure at 32nd Street. At this point there is a two-lane shoulder on the left side of the northbound roadway, with one of the lanes cordoned off by a short concrete barrier. There is a provision for a southbound exit and northbound entrance at 30th Street, which was built in 1967 and would have connected to the Mid- Manhattan Expressway. However, after plans for the expressway were abandoned, this exit was never used, largely because there was already an exit four blocks north, at 34th Street. The unused exit was then blocked with a semi- permanent concrete barricade. Exit 6, at 15th Street, formerly passed through a Con Edison substation, which handles most of the electricity for lower Manhattan. It was closed after the September 11, 2001 attacks after city and ConEd officials concluded it was too risky to allow such easy access to such a critical piece of infrastructure. The exit was permanently removed in 2014 after the New York State Department of Transportation received notification from the New York City Police Department that the exit would not be re-opened since the ConEd facility was deemed a potential terrorist target. East 15th Street, as well as a corresponding entrance ramp from 14th Street, were also closed east of Avenue C, except to ConEdison and law enforcement vehicles. All signage of exit 6 was removed in early 2016.  Transportation  The express buses use the FDR Drive between its start in Lower Manhattan and 23rd Street.

Introduced in the Hewlett-Packard HP 9000 Series 500 workstations and servers (originally launched as the HP 9020 and also, unofficially, called HP 9000 Series 600), the single-chip CPU was used alongside the I/O Processor (IOP), Memory Controller (MMU), Clock, and a number of 128-kilobit dynamic RAM devices as the basis of the HP 9000 system architecture. It was a 32-bit implementation of the 16-bit HP 3000 computer's stack architecture, with over 220 instructions (some 32 bits wide, some 16 bits wide), a segmented memory model, and no general purpose programmer- visible registers. The design of the FOCUS CPU was richly inspired by the custom silicon on sapphire (SOS) chip design, HP used in their HP 3000 series machines. Because of the high density of HP's NMOS-III IC process, heat dissipation was a problem. Therefore, the chips were mounted on special printed circuit boards, with a ~1 mm copper sheet at its core, called \\"finstrates\\". The Focus CPU is microcoded with a 9,216 by 38-bit microcode control store. Internal data paths and registers are all 32-bit wide. The Focus CPU has a transistor count of 450,000 FETs.

Along with the similarly large dinocephalia, the bradysaurs constituted the herbivorous megafauna of the late Middle Permian Period. In life they were probably slow, clumsy and inoffensive animals, that had evolved a covering of armoured scutes to protect them against their predators, the gorgonopsians. Description B. baini B. seeleyi Bradysaurus was 2.5 meters in length and half a tonne to a tonne in weight. The skull was large (about 42 to 48 centimeters long), broad and rounded at the front. It was coarsely sculptured and knobby, with the sutures between the bones not clearly visible. The marginal teeth were high-crowned, with only a few cusps, which is a primitive characteristic. The feet were short and broad, the phalangeal count being 2,3,3,3,2 on the fore-foot and 2,3,3,4,3 on the hind. The whole body is protected by dermal scutes, although these are not as thick or heavy as in more advanced forms. Classification and species Bradysaurus is the only member of the subfamily Bradysaurinae. It is the most primitive known pareiasaur and can be considered a good ancestral type from which the others developed. Its large dimensions show that, even very early in their evolutionary history, these strange animals had already attained an optimal size. Even later, more advanced forms, like Scutosaurus, were no larger. The advantage of large size was to provide defense against predators and to maintain a stable body temperature (gigantothermy). Kuhn 1969 lists no fewer than nine species for this genus, but this is certainly an excessive number. Boonstra 1969 distinguishes only four species on the basis of tooth structure, two of which Kuhn places in the genus Embrithosaurus. The genera Brachypareia, Bradysuchus, Koalemasaurus, and Platyoropha are synonyms of Bradysaurus. B. baini (Seeley, 1892) is from the Tapinocephalus zone, Lower Beaufort Beds, Karoo basin, South Africa. This is the type species for the genus. The quadra- jugal region (cheek-bones) were only moderately developed. The snout was broad and rounded and there were 15 or 16 pairs of overlapping teeth in each jaw. This animal could be considered a generic early pareiasaur. According to Lee, 1997, the available material of B. baini lacks distinguishing autapomorphies or characteristics. B. seeleyi (Haughton and Boonstra, 1929) is from the Tapinocephalus zone, Lower Beaufort Beds, Karoo basin, South Africa. This is a less common form. Boonstra, 1969, considered this a valid species of Bradysaurus and Lee, 1997, considers this animal a sister group to more advanced pareiasaurs. B. seelyi seems to be closely related to Nochelesaurus and Embrithosaurus. In contrast to the more numerous but similarly sized B. baini, the cheekbones were heavy and greatly enlarged. There were 19 or 20 pairs of strongly overlapping teeth on each jaw.  References * Boonstra, L. D. 1969, \\"The Fauna of the Tapinoephalus Zone (Beaufort Beds of the Karoo),\\" Ann. S. Afr.

The series aimed to revitalize the moribund variety television genre, which had been in a downward spiral for several years. The Big Show took its title seriously, using a huge stage set (complete with a live audience and an ice rink and swimming pool) and filling a 90-minute time-slot (one of the only variety programs in American television history to run this length), with at least one two-hour installment broadcast. It was in many respects a revival and television adaptation of The Big Show, which had aired on the NBC Radio Network from 1950 to 1951 and likewise was a big-budget, 90-minute weekly variety show designed to prevent old-time radio from fading into history. Although the first broadcast received high ratings, poor reviews and low ratings of succeeding episodes (typical of NBC during the Fred Silverman era) resulted in the program being cancelled after only a few months on May 8, 1980. The series nonetheless was nominated for six Emmy Awards, winning for Outstanding Costume Design. Regular performers included Joe Baker, Mimi Kennedy, Shabba-Doo and Pamela Myers. Guest hosts included Steve Allen, Nell Carter, Graham Chapman, David Copperfield, Geoffrey Holder, Gary Coleman, and Sid Caesar.

She served from April 21, 2005 until April 10, 2010. Hanson, like all Inuit born between the 1940s and the 1970s, was labelled with a disc number by the Government of Canada, which, in her case was E7-121. She spent the first 11 years of her life speaking only Inuktitut and living in Qakutut and Kimmirut. She attended schools in Iqaluit, Baker Lake (Qamanituaq), and Toronto, where she was known as Annie Cotterill. She studied community development at Saint Francis Xavier University, geography at the University of Windsor and received a diploma with honors in journalism from Nunavut Arctic College. Hanson's career has been diverse. She has been a civil servant, broadcaster, journalist and author. She has used her skills in Inuktitut throughout her career. Joining the federal government in 1964, she served as a secretary and interpreter/translator in the office of Northwest Territories MP Eugène Rhéaume. Hanson appeared, credited under a pseudonym \\"Pilitak\\", as the character Neevee in the 1974 film The White Dawn, which featured many Inuit actors speaking Inuktitut. She later said that the experience for the Frobisher Bay (now Iqaluit) community was \\"a renaissance back to our language\\". She joined the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as a receptionist, later becoming an announcer and producer in Inuktitut broadcasting. Hanson was the first editor of the Iqaluit community newspaper Inukshuk, which later became Nunatsiaq News. She is the author of Show Me, a book written in Inuktitut and English. In addition to her work in journalism, Hanson also served with the government of the Northwest Territories as a community development worker, counsellor and deputy commissioner. Hanson has spent considerable time as a volunteer, helping to start a number of organizations in Iqaluit. These organizations include the Juvenile Court Committee, the Elders Group, the Inuit Cultural Group, and the Quinuajuaq Society.

He was called Phyi-glin-gi-grwa-pa in Tibetan, meaning \\"the foreign pupil\\", and was declared a bosatsu or bodhisattva by the Japanese in 1933. He was born in Kőrös, Grand Principality of Transylvania (today part of Covasna, Romania). His birth date is often given as 4 April, although this is actually his baptism day and the year of his birth is debated by some authors who put it at 1787 or 1788 rather than 1784. The Magyar ethnic group, the Székelys, to which he belonged believed that they were derived from a branch of Attila's Huns who had settled in Transylvania in the fifth century. Hoping to study the claim and to find the place of origin of the Székelys and the Magyars by studying language kinship, he set off to Asia in 1820 and spent his lifetime studying the Tibetan language and Buddhist philosophy. Csoma de Kőrös is considered as the founder of Tibetology. He was said to have been able to read in seventeen languages. He died in Darjeeling while attempting to make a trip to Lhasa in 1842 and a memorial was erected in his honour by the Asiatic Society of Bengal. Biography =Youth in Transylvania= Csoma de Kőrös was born into a poor Székely family,Parish register record of 4 April 1784 was noted by Duka, however others think this might be the date of baptism and the year 1787/1788 is also suggested by certain authors. the sixth child of András Csoma and his wife, Krisztina Getse (or Ilona Göcz?). His name in English would be written Alexander Csoma of Koros and in Hungarian Kőrösi Csoma Sándor where Kőrösi means \\"of Koros\\" (i.e., a praedicatum of nobility) and alternate continental forms include \\"Sándor Csoma de Koros\\". His father served with the Székely Border Guards. His early schooling was at the local village school. In 1799, he went to Nagyenyed (present-day Aiud) to join the boarding school Bethlen Kollégium. The education was free (so called gratistae) in return for manual labor. Here he was influenced by the professor Samuel Hegedüs. He left the school in 1807 and continued university studies, taking an interest in history, a subject made popular by Professor Ádám Herepei. In 1815 he passed the public rigorosum in his studies at Bethlen Kollégium. A scholarship allowed him to continue to Göttingen, where he began to learn English under Professor Fiorillo. Csoma de Kőrős also came under the influence of Professor Johann Gottfried Eichhorn. =Studies in Göttingen= Bust presented by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences to the Asiatic Society of Bengal Between 1816 and 1818 he studied Oriental languages. In Göttingen, he was noted for being literate in thirteen languages including Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, German, and Romanian apart from his native Hungarian. In his Calcutta years he also mastered Bengali, Marathi and Sanskrit. He returned to Transylvania in 1818. On 7 February 1819, Csoma met Hegedűs and informed him of his intent to learn Slavonic in Croatia. He left on foot for Agram and spent a few months there. He received the aid of one hundred florins from Michael de Kenderessy to help him in this journey. =Eastward bound= The journey that Csoma undertook after leaving Croatia is reconstructed mainly from to a letter that Csoma wrote introducing himself to the British Captain Kennedy who detained him on entry at Sabathu on suspicion of being a spy. Csoma did not apply for an Imperial passport and obtained a Hungarian passport at Nagy Enyed and visited Bucharest. He had it signed by the General Commandant in Hermanstadt and went to Romania (then called Wallachia) at the end of November 1819. He attempted to go to Constantinople but not finding the means he left Bucharest on 1 January 1820 and passed the Danube by-Rustchuk and reached Sofia and then after five days to Philipopolis. =Middle East, Central Asia= Route taken by Csoma yak Csoma de Kőrös arrived in Edirne (Adrianopolis) and he wished to go from there to Constantinople but was forced by a plague outbreak to move to Enos. He left Enos on 7 February 1820 and reached Alexandria on a Greek ship. He reached on the last day of February but had to leave soon due to a plague epidemic. He boarded a Syrian ship to Larnaca in Cyprus and then took another ship to Tripoli and Latakia. From here he travelled on foot and reached Aleppo in Syria on 13 April. He left on 19 May, joining various caravans and by raft along the river going through Urfa, Mardin and Mosul to arrive in Baghdad on 22 July. He wrote to the British resident Mr. Rich and sought help in his travels. He was provided a European dress and money through a Hungarian friend Mr. Swoboda with whom he stayed. He left Baghdad on 4 September and travelled with a caravan through Kermanshah and Hamadan and reached Tehran on 14 October 1820. He sought help from Henry Willock who made it possible for him to stay on for about four months. He left Tehran on 1 March 1821, leaving behind his passport and papers and changing from a European costume to a Persian one apart from writing notes in Hungarian which were to be passed on in the event that he died on his way to Bukhara. He reached Meshed on 18 April and due to the troubles in the area he could not continue until 20 October. He reached Bukhara on 18 November. He initially intended to spend the winter in Bukhara but fearing the Russian army he left after five days and joined a caravan that passed through Balk, Kulm, and Bamian to reach Kabul on 6 January 1822. He left Kabul on 19 January and headed towards Peshawar. On 26 January he met two French officers at Daka, Messrs. Allard and Ventura, who joined him to Lahore. He reached Lahore on 11 March and left on the 23rd passing through Amritsar, Jammu to reach Kashmir on 17 April. Finding company to travel with he left on 9 May to reach Leh on 9 June. Finding the route to Yarkand risky, he decided to return to Lahore and on the way to Kashmir, on 16 July 1822 he met William Moorcroft, the famous English explorer. He decided to stay on with Moorcroft and joined him to Leh. Here Moorcroft introduced Csoma to George Trebeck. He also lent Csoma a copy of Alphabetum Tibetanum by Agostino Antonio Giorgi. He also helped Moorcroft by translating a Russian letter (from Count Nesselrode Petersburgh dated 17 January 1820) addressed to Ranjeet Singh into Latin. Before Moorcroft left Leh, Csoma requested him that he wished to stay on with Trebeck in Leh. He then joined Trebeck back to Srinagar on 26 November. He stayed on here for five months and six days during which time he took an interest in the Tibetan language and discussed with Moorcroft an interest in examining the contents of the books found in the local monasteries. =In Ladakh= Moorcroft recommended Csoma and wrote to obtain subsistence and support from the chief officer at Leh and the Lama of Yangla at Zanskar. Csoma left Kashmir on 2 May 1823 and reached Leh on 1 June 1823. From here he travelled to Yangla on the 9th and stayed in Zanskar from 20 June to 22 October 1824. At Zanskar he studied under a Lama. Towards winter he decided to move to Kullu and reached Subathu on 26 November. Here he was detained by Captain Kennedy who suspected him of being a spy. A letter of introduction and testimony from Moorcroft however clarified his position. It was not until May that the government response from Calcutta reached Subathu which absolved him of any suspicion from the British government. On 6 June 1825, he left Subathu and reached Pukdal or Pukhtar in Zanskar. He returned to Subathu only on 17 January 1827 with some regret that his Lama instructor was not able to give enough time and attention. On his return to Subathu, Captain Kennedy wrote to Horace Hayman Wilson at the Asiatic Society of Bengal that he wished to discuss literary subjects and Tibet. He also noted that Csoma was not in need of money, having saved Rs. 150 from the Rs. 500 advanced to him by the Government two years ago. He also noted that Csoma \\".. declines any attention that I would be most happy to show him, and he lives in the most retired manner.\\" During this period at Zanskar (he was the first European to visit the valley), he was immersed in an intense sixteen-month study of the Tibetan language and the Indo-Tibetan Buddhism at the core of its literature, with a local lama, Sangs-rgyas-phun-tshogs. He was one of the first Europeans to master the Tibetan language and read two of the great encyclopedias of Indo- Tibetan Buddhist literature the Kangyur (100 volumes) and the bsTan-'gyur (224 volumes) which contained translations of Buddhist books brought from India.Saint-Hilaire, J.-B. Buddha and his Religion. Twickenham: Tiger Books International, 1998 p19 From May 1827 to October 1830 he resided in Kanum in Upper Bashahr in the Simla Hill States where he studied the collection of Tibetan manuscripts he had amassed in Ladakh, living on a monthly stipend of Rs. 50/- from the British. With his dictionary and grammar complete, Csoma went to Calcutta to oversee its publication. In the course of his travels Csoma used various names modified for local use. These included Sikander (from Alexander) with the Beg or Mulla suffix and Rumi, Roome, modified into Tibetan as Rumpa as a prefix indicating he was from Rome. He sometimes signed as Secunder Roome. =In Calcutta and Darjeeling= Memorial at Darjeeling In 1831 Csoma joined the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal in Calcutta. In 1833 he was unanimously elected as an honorary member of the Asiatic Society. In 1834 he was made an honorary member of the Royal Asiatic Society. From 1837 to 1841, he worked as Librarian of the Asiatic Society.Journal of The Asiatic Society, Vol.XLVII, No.1, Kolkata: The Asiatic Society, 2005, p.236 In 1842 he planned to travel to Lhasa, but contracted malaria while traveling in the Terai and died in Darjeeling. Personal life Csoma lived as an ascetic. He often slept on bare earth and ate a diet of bread, curd cheese, fruit and salad or boiled rice and tea.Ligeti, Lajos. (1984).

A tablet was placed by the Hungarian government with the words of Count Istvan Szechenyi : \\"A poor lonely Hungarian, without applause or money but inspired with enthusiasm sought the Hungarian native country but in the end broke down under the burden\\". A project has been started to restore the old royal palace (Kharkongma) of Zangla where Csoma de Kőrös lived and compiled his Tibetan–English dictionary.Csoma's Room Project He was declared as a Bodhisattva (canonized as a Buddhist saint) on 22 February 1933 in Japan. A statue of him in lotus posture by the Hungarian sculptor Géza Csorba was placed on the occasion at the shrine in the Tokyo Buddhist University. On his 200th birth anniversary in 1984, the Hungarian government released a postal stamp depicting him and his travel.

This approach allows us to define rigorously the concept of resonance in quantum mechanics. In general, the partitioning formalism is based on the definition of two complementary projectors P and Q such that :P + Q = 1. The subspaces onto which P and Q project are sets of states obeying the continuum and the bound state boundary conditions respectively. P and Q are interpreted as the projectors on the background and the resonant subspaces respectively. The projectors P and Q are not defined within the Feshbach–Fano method. This is its major power as well as its major weakness. On the one hand, this makes the method very general and, on the other hand, it introduces some arbitrariness which is difficult to control. Some authors define first the P space as an approximation to the background scattering but most authors define first the Q space as an approximation to the resonance. This step relies always on some physical intuition which is not easy to quantify. In practice P or Q should be chosen such that the resulting background scattering phase or cross-section is slowly depending on the scattering energy in the neighbourhood of the resonances (this is the so-called flat continuum hypothesis). If one succeeds in translating the flat continuum hypothesis in a mathematical form, it is possible to generate a set of equations defining P and Q on a less arbitrary basis. The aim of the Feshbach–Fano method is to solve the Schrödinger equation governing a scattering process (defined by the Hamiltonian H) in two steps: First by solving the scattering problem ruled by the background Hamiltonian PHP. It is often supposed that the solution of this problem is trivial or at least fulfilling some standard hypotheses which allow to skip its full resolution. Second by solving the resonant scattering problem corresponding to the effective complex (energy dependent) Hamiltonian :H_\\\\mathrm{eff} (E) = QHQ + \\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon \\\\to 0} QHP{1 \\\\over E + i \\\\varepsilon -PHP}PHQ = QHQ + \\\\Delta(E) - i \\\\Gamma(E)/2, \\\\, whose dimension is equal to the number of interacting resonances and depends parametrically on the scattering energy E. The resonance parameters E_\\\\mathrm{res} and \\\\Gamma_\\\\mathrm{res} are obtained by solving the so-called implicit equation :\\\\det[H_\\\\mathrm{eff}(z)-z]=0 \\\\, for z in the lower complex plane. The solution :z_\\\\mathrm{res} = E_\\\\mathrm{res}-i\\\\Gamma_\\\\mathrm{res} \\\\, is the resonance pole. If z_\\\\mathrm{res} is close to the real axis it gives rise to a Breit–Wigner or a Fano profile in the corresponding cross section. Both resulting T matrices have to be added in order to obtain the T matrix corresponding to the full scattering problem : :T_\\\\mathrm{total}=T_\\\\mathrm{background}+T_\\\\mathrm{resonances}. \\\\, Category:Scattering theory ","title":"Feshbach–Fano partitioning"},{"id":"2167231","text":"Wilmington is a village and civil parish in the Borough of Dartford in Kent, England. It is located 2.7 miles south of Dartford, 3.5 miles north of Swanley and 4.3 miles south east of Bexleyheath, adjacent to the Kent border with Greater London. History Wilmington is believed to have been the site of a major Celtic settlement and a place where the Cantii tribe fought Roman invaders near Leyton Cross and Joyden's Wood. In the reign of Edward IV, a manor house in the village was a residence of the king-making Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick. In the 19th century Wilmington was noted for being surrounded by gardens and cherry orchards. In the 1970s the village was bisected by the A2 dual carriageway. Notable residents Wilmington is perhaps most famous for being the childhood home of Mick Jagger, lead singer with the Rolling Stones. An earlier resident was Sir James Whitehead, whose family grave is in the village churchyard. He was Lord Mayor of London c.1888-9 and he lived for a number of years in the Manor, which was an early part of the girls' school. Two daughters, Leila and Florence, lived at Hazlewood in Rowhill and they founded the mission in Broad Lane. Transport =Rail= The nearest National Rail stations to Wilmington are Dartford, Bexley & Swanley. =Buses= Wilmington is served Go Coach route 429, Arriva Kent Thameside route 477 & London Buses route B12. These connect it with Bexleyheath, Bluewater, Dartford, Erith, Orpington & Swanley. Sport Wilmington Cricket Club has been a part of the village for over 100 years and has had many successes in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, playing at Lords twice and winning many competitions over the years. They currently play in the Kent Regional Cricket League and the home ground is in Oakfield Park. Wilmington used to have a successful football club whose history, in the form of trophies and shields, is displayed in the Wilmington Pavilion on Oakfield Lane. In 2014, Richard Moore, a resident of Wilmington, started a new Wilmington FC team playing in the North Kent Sunday League. In their first season they won the League Three title as well as the League A cup. Schools Wilmington Primary School There are three secondary schools within the parish: Wilmington Grammar School for Boys (WGSB), whose students wear blue blazers, white shirts, grey trousers and different ties for each house within the school (these colours are red, green, white, black and purple); Wilmington Grammar School for Girls (WGSG) formally The Grammar School for Girls Wilmington (GSGW), where the uniforms are maroon jumpers and skirts and a sky-blue revere collar blouse; and the mixed-sex Wilmington Academy (formerly Wilmington Hall), whose pupils wear black blazers. Wilmington Academy and 'Wilmington Boys' are situated near Common Lane While 'Wilmington Girls' is situated on the nearby Parsons Lane. The Academy was built in the mid-1970s on the site of Wilmington Hall Manor and is a specialist centre of excellence for both business and vocational courses. Wilmington Grammar School for Boys has engineering specialist status. Wilmington Grammar School for Girls specialises in mathematics and computing. There is one primary school in the village and another in Joydens Wood Estate; a nursery school is situated next to Wilmington Academy. The Dartford Campus of North West Kent College is accessed via Oakfield Lane, Wilmington,Only the westbound lane and properties to the south of the road lie within Wilmington parish but its grounds lie within Dartford.

Life Bell was the son of an Irish magistrate, born at Cork on 16 January 1800. He was a student at Trinity College, Dublin, where he founded the Dublin Historical Society, in place of the old Historical Society which had been suppressed. He is said to have obtained early in life a government appointment in Dublin, and to have edited for a time the Patriot, a government organ. He is also described as one of the founders of and contributors to the Dublin Inquisitor, and as the author of two dramatic pieces, Double Disguises and Comic Lectures. In 1828, Bell settled in London, around the time he authored a pamphlet on catholic emancipation. At this period he was appointed editor of The Atlas, then one of the major London weekly papers, and ran it for many years. In 1829, at a time when press prosecutions were rife, he was indicted for a libel on Lord Lyndhurst, a paragraph in the Atlas having stated that either he or his wife had trafficked in the ecclesiastical patronage vested in the lord chancellor. The indictment would have been withdrawn if Bell had revealed the name of his source, but he refused. The jury found him guilty of publishing a libel, but virtually acquitted him of malicious intention. The attorney-general expressed satisfaction with the verdict, and Bell seems to have escaped punishment. A member of the committee of the Royal Literary Fund, Bell helped struggling and unsuccessful men of letters, and his death on 12 April 1867 was much regretted. In accordance with his request he was buried near the grave of his friend William Makepeace Thackeray, in Kensal Green Cemetery. Works He edited The Story-teller, 1843, and in 1849 the concluding volumes of the Correspondence of the Fairfax Family. In 1846 had appeared his popularly written Life of Canning. Bell's major work was his annotated edition of the English Poets (24 vols., 1854–1857; new ed., 29 vols., 1866), the works of each poet being prefaced by a memoir. For Lardner's, Cabinet Cyclopaedia he wrote History of Russia (3 vols., 1836–1838) and Lives of English Poets (2 vols., 1839). Bell wrote also a continuation, with W. Wallace, of Sir James Mackintosh's History of England (vols. iv.-x., 1830–1840); and the fifth volume (1840) of the Lives of the British Admirals, begun by Robert Southey. Bell was a member of the Percy Society, and in 1846 the society published Ancient Poems, Ballads and Songs of the Peasantry of England edited by Bell.

Rindge responded in July 1887 with an offer of land and full funding for Cambridge's public library. Later that year he enlarged his offer to include three additional buildings: a new city hall (now the Cambridge City Hall), the Rindge Technical School, and a proposed high school (not built). He also paid the bulk of the costs for the Harvard- Epworth United Methodist Church. Today Rindge is commemorated in Cambridge through the high school, Rindge Avenue, Rindgefield Street, and Rindge Towers, low-income apartment buildings. Southern California Rindge moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1887. In 1892 Rindge purchased the 13,315.7-acre Spanish land grant Rancho Topanga Malibu Sequit or \\"Malibu Rancho\\", in Malibu, California. He later expanded it to as Rindge Ranch. He and his wife, May, first stayed in a small cabin on it that had been built by one of the ranch's previous owners, Matthew Keller, naming it Oak Cottage.

His investments included land near Stockton, California and real estate holdings in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, and the state of Sinaloa, Mexico. He was President of the Harvard Club of Los Angeles and a member of many historical, archaeological, patriotic, and religious organizations which mirrored his interests. A supporter of the temperance movement, Rindge reimbursed the city of Santa Monica for the loss of license fees when Santa Monica abolished saloons. He established the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Santa Monica. He wrote several self-published books which were spiritual and meditative in nature. Personal life In 1887 Rindge married 22-year-old Rhoda May Knight (1864–1941) of Michigan. They moved to Wilshire and Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica and then built a home at 2263 Harvard Boulevard in Los Angeles, known today as the Frederick Hastings Rindge House; weekends and summers were spent at their Malibu estate. They had three children: Samuel Knight Rindge (1888–1968), Frederick Hastings Rindge, Jr. (1890–1952), and Rhoda Agatha Rindge (1893–1962). Samuel Knight Rindge married Agnes Marion Hole, daughter of Willits J. Hole. Rhoda Agatha Rindge married Merritt Adamson,Rindge Adamson Family and they built the Adamson House, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. The Rindges also had a vacation home in Marblehead, Massachusetts. Frederick H. Rindge died on a Tuesday at sunrise. He had fallen ill while visiting a silver mine in Yreka, California. His body was transported via train back to Southern California. A service was held at the Rindge home in West Adams Heights, followed by another short service after his funeral procession to his place of burial, Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery.

She was one of the founders of the Japanese Red Cross Society, whose charity work was known throughout the First Sino-Japanese War. Lady Ichijō The former Lady Masako in traditional clothes. Year 1872. Lady Masako Ichijō was born on 9 May 1849, in Heian-kyō, Japan. She was the third daughter of Tadaka Ichijō, former Minister of the Left and head of the Fujiwara clan's Ichijō branch. Her adoptive mother was one of Prince Fushimi Kuniie' s daughters, but her biological mother was Tamiko Shinbata, the daughter of a doctor from the Ichijō family. Unusually for the time, she had been vaccinated against smallpox. As a child, Masako was somewhat of a prodigy: she was able to read poetry from the Kokin Wakashū by the age of 4 and had composed some waka verses of her own by the age of 5. By age seven, she was able to read some texts in classical Chinese with some assistance and was studying Japanese calligraphy. By the age of 12, she had studied the koto and was fond of Noh drama. She excelled in the studies of finances, ikebana and, Japanese tea ceremony.Keene, Donald. (2005). Emperor of Japan:Meiji and His World, pp. 106-108. The major obstacle to Lady Masako's eligibility to become Empress consort was the fact that she was 3 years older than Emperor Meiji, but this issue was resolved by changing her official birth date from 1849 to 1850.Keene, Donald. (2005). Emperor of Japan:Meiji and His World, pp. 106-108. They became engaged on 2 September 1867, when she adopted the given name , which was intended to reflect her serene beauty and diminutive size. The Tokugawa Bakufu promised 15,000 ryō in gold for the wedding and assigned her an annual income of 500 koku, but as the Meiji Restoration occurred before the wedding could be completed, the promised amounts were never delivered. The wedding was delayed partly due to periods of mourning for Emperor Kōmei, for her brother Saneyoshi, and the political disturbances around Kyoto between 1867 and 1868.

The Emperor and the Empress ride a horse-drawn carriage to attend the constitutional celebration on February 12, 1890 (Meiji 22). Lady Haruko and Emperor Meiji's wedding was finally officially celebrated on 11 January 1869. She was the first imperial consort to receive the title of both nyōgō and of kōgō (literally, the emperor's wife, translated as \\"empress consort\\"), in several hundred years. However, it soon became clear that she was unable to bear children. Emperor Meiji already had 12 children by 5 concubines, though: as custom in Japanese monarchy, Empress Haruko adopted Yoshihito, her husband's eldest son by Lady Yanagihara Naruko, who became Crown Prince. On 8 November 1869, the Imperial House departed from Kyoto for the new capital of Tokyo.Keene, p. 188. In a break from tradition, Emperor Meiji insisted that the Empress and the senior ladies-in-waiting should attend the educational lectures given to the Emperor on a regular basis about national conditions and developments in foreign nations.Keene, p. 202. =Influence= On 30 July 1886, Empress Haruko attended the Peeresses School's graduation ceremony in Western clothing. On 10 August, the imperial couple received foreign guests in Western clothing for the first time when hosting a Western Music concert.Donald Keene, Emperor of Japan: Meiji and His World, 1852-1912, 2010 From this point onward, the Empress' entourage wore only Western style clothes in public, to the point that in January 1887 Empress Haruko issued a memorandum on the subject: traditional Japanese dress wasn't only unsuited to modern life, but Western style dress was closer than the kimono to clothes worn by Japanese women in ancient times.Keene, p. 404. In the diplomatic field, Empress Haruko hosted the wife of former US President Ulysses S. Grant during his visit to Japan. She was also present for her husband's meetings with Hawaiian King Kalākaua in 1881. Later that same year, she helped host the visit of the sons of future British King Edward VII: Princes Albert Victor and George (future George V), who presented her with a pair of pet wallabies from Australia.Keene, pp. 350-351. On 26 November 1886, Empress Haruko accompanied her husband to Yokosuka, Kanagawa to observe the new Imperial Japanese Navy cruisers Naniwa and Takachiho firing torpedoes and performing other maneuvers. From 1887, the Empress was often at the Emperor's side in official visits to army maneuvers.Keene, p. 411. When Emperor Meiji fell ill in 1888, Empress Haruko took his place in welcoming envoys from Siam, launching warships and visiting Tokyo Imperial University.Keene, pp. 416. In 1889, Empress Haruko accompanied Emperor Meiji on his official visit to Nagoya and Kyoto. While he continued on to visit naval bases at Kure and Sasebo, she went to Nara to worship at the principal Shinto shrines.Keene, p. 433. Known throughout her reign for her support of charity work and women's education during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–95), Empress Haruko worked for the establishment of the Japanese Red Cross Society. She participated in the organization's administration, especially in their peacetime activities in which she created a money fund for the International Red Cross. Renamed \\"The Empress Shōken Fund\\", it is presently used for international welfare activities. After Emperor Meiji moved his military headquarters from Tokyo to Hiroshima to be closer to the lines of communications with his troops, Empress Haruko joined her husband in March 1895. While in Hiroshima, she insisted on visiting hospitals full wounded soldiers every other day of her stay.Keene, p. 502. =Death= After Emperor Meiji's death in 1912, Empress Haruko was granted the title by her adoptive son, Emperor Taishō. She died in 1914 at the Imperial Villa in Numazu, Shizuoka and was buried in the East Mound of the Fushimi Momoyama Ryo in Fushimi, Kyoto, next to her husband. Her soul was enshrined in Meiji Shrine in Tokyo. On 9 May 1914, she received the posthumous name Shōken Kōtaigō.大正3年宮内省告示第9号 (Imperial Household Ministry's 9th announcement in 1914) Her railway-carriage can be seen today in the Meiji Mura Museum, in Inuyama, Aichi prefecture.

It commenced on 16 November, when the Austro-Hungarians under the command of Oskar Potiorek reached the Kolubara River during their third invasion of Serbia that year, having captured the strategic town of Valjevo and forced the Serbian Army to undertake a series of retreats. The Serbs withdrew from Belgrade on 29–30 November, and the city soon fell under Austro-Hungarian control. On 2 December, the Serbian Army launched a surprise counter-attack all along the front. Valjevo and Užice were retaken by the Serbs on 8 December and the Austro-Hungarians retreated to Belgrade, which 5th Army commander Liborius Ritter von Frank deemed to be untenable. The Austro-Hungarians abandoned the city between 14 and 15 December and retreated back into Austria- Hungary, allowing the Serbs to retake their capital the following day. Both the Austro-Hungarians and the Serbs suffered heavy casualties, with more than 20,000 dead on each side. The defeat humiliated Austria-Hungary, which had hoped to occupy Serbia by the end of 1914. On 22 December, Potiorek and von Frank were relieved of their respective commands, and the 5th and 6th armies were merged into a single 5th Army of 95,000 men. Background On 28 June 1914, Bosnian Serb student Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo. The assassination precipitated the July Crisis, which led Austria-Hungary to issue an ultimatum to Serbia on 23 July on suspicion that the assassination had been planned in Belgrade. The Austro- Hungarian government made the ultimatum intentionally unacceptable to Serbia, and it was indeed rejected. The Austro-Hungarians declared war on Serbia on 28 July and that same day the Serbs destroyed all bridges on the Sava and Danube rivers in order to prevent the Austro-Hungarians from using them during any future invasion. Belgrade was shelled the following day, marking the beginning of World War I. Fighting in Eastern Europe began with the first Austro- Hungarian invasion of Serbia in early August 1914, under the command of Oskar Potiorek. The number of Austro-Hungarian troops assigned to the invasion was far smaller than the 308,000-strong force intended when war was declared. This was because a large portion of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army had moved to the Russian Front, reducing the number of troops involved in the initial stages of the invasion to approximately 200,000. On the other hand, the Serbs could muster some 450,000 men to oppose the Austro-Hungarians upon full mobilization. The main elements to face the Austro-Hungarians were the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and Užice armies, with a combined strength of approximately 180,000 men. The Serbian Army was commanded by Crown Prince Alexander, with the chief of the Serbian general staff, Radomir Putnik, as his deputy and de facto military leader. Petar Bojović, Stepa Stepanović, Pavle Jurišić Šturm and Miloš Božanović commanded the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and Užice armies, respectively. Serbian soldiers marching through the countryside, . The Balkan Wars had only just concluded and Serbia was still recovering. Over 36,000 Serbian soldiers had been killed and 55,000 seriously wounded. Few recruits had been gained from the newly acquired territories, and the Serbian Army had been stretched by the need to garrison them against Albanian insurgents and the threat of Bulgarian attack. To compound matters, the Serbs were dangerously short of artillery, and had only just begun to replenish their ammunition stocks. Their supply problems also extended to more basic items. Many soldiers lacked any uniform other than a standard issue greatcoat and a traditional Serbian cap known as a šajkača. Rifles were also in critically short supply. It was estimated that full mobilization would see some 50,000 Serbian soldiers with no equipment at all. The Austro-Hungarians, on the other hand, possessed an abundance of modern rifles and had twice as many machine guns and field guns as the Serbs. They also had better stocks of munitions, as well as much better transport and industrial infrastructure behind them. The Serbs had a slight advantage over the Austro-Hungarians as many of their soldiers were experienced veterans of the Balkan Wars and better trained than their Austro- Hungarian counterparts. Serb soldiers were also highly motivated, which compensated in part for their lack of weaponry. The Serbs beat back an Austro- Hungarian invasion in August, at the Battle of Cer. It marked the first Allied victory over the Central Powers in World War I. Potiorek was humiliated by the defeat and was determined to resume the assault against the Serbs. He was given permission in September to launch another invasion of Serbia provided that he \\"[did not] risk anything that might lead to a further fiasco.\\" Under pressure from the Russians to launch their own offensive and keep as many Austro-Hungarian troops as possible away from the Eastern Front, the Serbs invaded Bosnia in September with the help of Chetnik irregulars but were repulsed after a month of fighting in what came to be known as the Battle of the Drina. Bojović was wounded during the battle and was replaced by Živojin Mišić as commander of the Serbian 1st Army. Prelude =Austro-Hungarian plans= Aftermath of the Austro-Hungarian bombardment of Šabac, October 1914. The Armeeoberkommando (AOK) acknowledged that an undefeated Serbia severed Austria-Hungary's connection to the Ottoman Empire and prevented the completion of the Berlin–Baghdad railway. The AOK also realized that the Austro-Hungarian army's inability to defeat Serbia would discourage neutral countries—such as Bulgaria, Romania and Greece—from joining the Central Powers and would tempt Italy to open up a third front against Austria-Hungary. Nevertheless, the AOK was hesitant to authorize a third invasion of Serbia. This changed in September 1914, when Austro-Hungarian troops discovered a map in an abandoned Semlin bookshop, titled The New Division of Europe. Originally printed in a Russian newspaper, the map was widely sold in Serbia and depicted the borders of Europe as they would appear following the war. Germany was to be divided into northern and southern confederations and Austria-Hungary was to be abolished, its eastern provinces given to Russia, Romania, the Czechs and the Hungarians, and its southern provinces divided between Serbia and Italy. Alarmed by the prospect of Austria-Hungary's disintegration, Emperor Franz Joseph personally authorized a third invasion of Serbia in early October 1914. Having just repelled the Serbian incursion into Bosnia, the Austro- Hungarian Army regrouped and positioned itself for one final invasion before winter set in. Potiorek was again placed in charge of Austro-Hungarian forces and was given command of the Austro-Hungarian 6th Army. The Austro-Hungarian 5th Army was commanded by Liborius Ritter von Frank. In total, the Austro- Hungarians had 450,000 troops at their disposal. The Serbian Army had 400,000 soldiers ready to face the Austro-Hungarian advance. Potiorek appeared confident. \\"Soldiers of the 5th and 6th armies,\\" he said. \\"The goal of this war is nearly attained—the complete destruction of the enemy. The three-month campaign is almost over; we must only break the enemy's last resistance before the onset of winter.\\" The Serbs were exhausted and demoralized. In a telegram to Putnik dated 27 October 1914, Stepanović complained that the 2nd Army did not have enough shells to resist the Austro-Hungarians effectively and requested that he be removed from his command; Putnik denied the request, but ordered all units to resist the Austro-Hungarian advance for as long as possible before retreating. This strategy had worked in Putnik's favour during the summer months, but heavy rainfall in September and early October had reduced all of Serbia's roads to \\"muddy quagmires\\" that made movement of troops, guns and wagons extremely difficult. Potiorek recognized that the Serbian Army was in a difficult situation; he was certain that a third invasion would bring him the decisive victory that he so desperately wanted. In Vienna and Sarajevo, Austro-Hungarian officials began planning for the occupation and dismantling of Serbia. The country was to be plundered and its territory used to bribe the neutral Balkan states into joining the Central Powers, with the Romanians getting the region of the Timok Valley and the Bulgarians getting Macedonia and southeastern Serbia. The Austro-Hungarians intended to annex everything west of the Morava River, as well as the cities of Scutari (Shkodër) and Durazzo (Durrës) in northern Albania. The Serbs living west of the Morava—or \\"the compact masses of the Serbian element\\", as the Austro-Hungarians called them—were to be expelled and replaced with Austrian settlers (colonisten), who would \\"change the psychology [of the region], making Serbia more Habsburg [and] less Serbian in outlook.\\" Ludwig Thallóczy, section chief of the Austro-Hungarian Finance Ministry, wrote Potiorek in October, recommending \\"the West Europeanization of the Serbs with a strong hand\\" as soon as Serbia was occupied. Potiorek planned to launch a converging attack across northern and western Serbia; the 5th Army was to capture Valjevo and envelope the Kolubara River from the north, and the 6th Army was to secure the Jagodnja plateau and outflank Serbian units on the Kolubara from the south. The capture of the southeastern Serbian city of Niš was Potiorek's main objective; Niš had been Serbia's capital since July and was a crucial transportation hub for its military. It also acted as a clearing house for munitions produced at the arsenal in nearby Kragujevac. The city's capture would effectively cut Serbia in two and scatter the Serbian Army. =Third Austro-Hungarian invasion of Serbia= All of the valleys of northwestern Serbia were swamped by constant rainfall. The mountains had been covered in snow since early October. Acknowledging the opportunity that such conditions presented, Putnik told his closest advisors: \\"All my strategy consists in placing the 'Serbian national mud' between the enemy's fighting line and his supplies.\\" On 31 October, von Frank's 5th Army pushed down into the region between the Sava and Drina rivers while Potiorek's 6th Army drove west across the Drina and into the Jagodnja plateau. Austria-Hungary's third invasion of Serbia commenced on 6 November 1914, with intense artillery fire strafing a series of Serbian border towns. On 7 November, the Austro-Hungarian 5th and 6th armies attacked across the Drina. Outnumbered and in desperate need of ammunition, the Serbian Army offered fierce resistance but was forced to retreat. The 3rd Army fell back against a road by the Jadar River in an effort to block the Austro-Hungarian advance towards Valjevo, while the 1st Army retreated southward into the Serbian interior and the Užice Army managed to prevent the Austro-Hungarians from crossing the Drina. On 8 November, the Austro-Hungarians attacked the Serbian 2nd Army near Cer Mountain and came within of the Serbian frontline, entrenching themselves at the foot of the mountain. The 2nd Army was given orders to hold the Austro-Hungarians down for as long as possible and, if its position became untenable, retreat towards the right bank of the Dobrava River and position itself so as to block the approach to Valjevo. Elsewhere, the Austro-Hungarians drove a wedge between the 1st and 3rd Army and forced another Serbian retreat. Later that day, the Serbian Government held a joint session with the Serbian Supreme Command with regard to Serbia's worsening military position. Putnik stressed that it was critical for Serbia to hold the Kolubara and the towns within its vicinity and suggested that the Serbs make a separate peace with Austria-Hungary if this proved impossible. This notion was rejected by the Prime Minister of Serbia, Nikola Pašić, who urged further resistance to the Austro-Hungarians and threatened the resignation of his government if peace discussions began. The session ended with the Serbian Government and Supreme Command agreeing to fight on. =Serbian retreat= Austro-Hungarian soldiers stand beside captured Serbian artillery. Putnik reasoned that Austro-Hungarian supply lines would become overstretched as their forces pressed deeper into Serbia while the Serbs would continue to hold the railheads in the Serbian interior. On 10 November, he ordered a general retreat from the Jadar and withdrew the Serbian 2nd Army to Ub and positioned the 1st and 3rd armies north and west of Valjevo. Meanwhile, the Užice Army took up positions to defend the town from which it took its name. The Austro-Hungarians pressed after the Serbs, hoping to capture the Obrenovac–Valjevo railroad. Clashes ensued and the Serbian Army managed to prevent the Austro-Hungarians from taking the railroad for a time. It quickly became clear to Putnik that he had underestimated the Austro- Hungarians, who managed to bring their heavy artillery through the muddy Serbian country roads. They established firing positions on the Serbian side of the Drina and began targeting the Serbian Army, which suffered heavy casualties. Morale plummeted amongst the Serbs, who were already significantly demoralized due a lack of cold-weather clothing and ammunition and exhausted by the long retreat towards the Serbian interior. Putnik realized that his forces would need to regroup if they were to provide effective resistance. He ordered that Valjevo be abandoned and had the Serbian Army take up positions on the Kolubara. The retreat towards the river was long and excruciating, with the Serbs being forced to destroy all bridges and telephone lines so that they would not fall into Austro-Hungarian hands. The Serbian Army also abandoned most of its heavy equipment to speed up the withdrawal. Seeing that the situation was critical and that Serbian forces were lacking artillery, ammunition and supplies, Pašić sought the help of the Triple Entente. He sent a telegram to his envoys abroad, which read: \\"Urgent help is required. Beg and plead.\\" France provided the Serbs with munitions and supplies. Representatives of Russia and the United Kingdom \\"expressed understanding\\", but those countries failed to deliver weapons and munitions. The Austro-Hungarians entered Valjevo on 15 November, prompting wild public celebrations in Vienna. Franz Joseph praised Potiorek for seizing the town; cities across the empire made Potiorek an honorary citizen and Sarajevo even named a street after him. Valjevo's capture led the Austro-Hungarians to believe that they were on the verge of defeating Serbia and that the Serbian Army was no longer a coherent fighting force, but the scorched earth tactics employed by the Serbs during their withdrawal complicated the Austro-Hungarian advance. Although the Austro-Hungarians were right in assuming that the Serbian Army was exhausted, its defensive positions along the Kolubara had been prepared months in advance. Putnik's carefully timed withdrawals had ensured that the losses of the Serbian Army were lighter than if it had stood and fought pitched battles with the Austro-Hungarians. Moreover, the geography of northwestern Serbia favoured defensive operations since the approaches to the Kolubara did not offer any cover to armies invading from the direction of Austria-Hungary and the river itself was surrounded by mountainous terrain. In October, the Serbs had fortified the Jeljak and Maljen mountain ranges in anticipation of an Austro-Hungarian attack. This gave them an advantage over the Austro- Hungarians as it placed them in control of all roads leading to Kragujevac. The Serbs also established a series of field fortifications blocking the approach to Niš. The extensive series of fortifications and the difficulty of the terrain which they faced left the Austro-Hungarians with no choice but to conduct operations in the gruelling Serbian countryside with almost no lines of communication. Battle =16–26 November= The Kolubara River in Valjevo. The Austro-Hungarians reached the Kolubara on 16 November and launched an assault against Serbian defensive positions there the following day. The Serbs managed to force the Austro-Hungarians back and over the course of the next five days, the two armies fought a series of battles under heavy rain and snowfall. Both sides suffered heavy casualties, with a large number of soldiers succumbing to frostbite and hypothermia. The Austro-Hungarian assault began at Lazarevac, a strategically located town just south of Belgrade whose capture would have given them access to the Mladenovac railway line and the ability to outflank the Serbian forces holding the road to Belgrade. Further south, the Austro-Hungarians attacked the Serbian 1st Army. During this assault, they made the mistake of attacking its stronger right flank and were met with determined Serbian resistance which prevented them from gaining any ground. Military historian David Jordan notes that had the Austro-Hungarians attacked the junction splitting the 1st and Užice armies, they might have been able to split the Serbs down the centre and gotten hold of an unimpeded passage to the Morava River. The Serbian 1st Army was quick to reinforce its left flank, realizing that any subsequent attack against it would be far less easy to repel. During the night of 18 November, the Austro- Hungarians moved into position to carry out a further assault, which began the following morning. The Austro-Hungarians' main goal was to break through the defenses of the Serbian 2nd Army, concentrated primarily around Lazarevac, and to drive the Serbian 1st Army back towards the town of Gornji Milanovac while simultaneously assaulting Serbian positions around the villages of Čovka and Vrače Brdo which threatened the Austro-Hungarian flank. The Austro-Hungarians gained a foothold at Vrače Brdo by the evening of 19 November, and seized higher ground from the Serbs further to the south. The Serbian 1st Army was forced to retreat the following day, giving the Austro-Hungarians the ability to advance down the main routes leading to Kragujevac. Potiorek believed it was possible that Putnik was trying to lure the Austro-Hungarians deeper into Serbia for the purpose of encircling them and then attacking their flanks, but correctly assessed that the Serbian Army was in no position to carry out such an attack. The Austro-Hungarians made a renewed attack against the 1st Army on 21 November, forcing the Serbs back after a series of brutal engagements. The Austro-Hungarians then advanced towards Mount Maljen, aiming to drive the 1st Serbian Army from its positions there. The Serbs withdrew from the mountain after three days of heavy fighting; Potiorek decided not to pursue, allowing them to make an orderly withdrawal. The Austro-Hungarians had suffered heavy casualties and the intensity of the fighting caused them to lose cohesion. As they advanced deeper into Serbia, the terrain became increasingly difficult and exhausted the already tired Austro-Hungarian soldiers. While the Serbian 1st Army withdrew, the 2nd and 3rd armies fiercely resisted the Austro- Hungarian advance. This led Potiorek to reinforce his positions around Lazarevac, which he aimed to capture and use as a pivot from which to attack Kragujevac while his right flank pushed down the West Morava valley. Austro- Hungarian advances convinced Potiorek that his army had the upper hand. He envisaged that his forces would pursue the surviving soldiers from the Serbian 2nd and 3rd Armies and predicted that the Serbian 1st and Užice armies would be forced to manoeuvre towards Belgrade and Lazarevac, where they would be encircled and destroyed. Combat on the outskirts of Lazarevac intensified once again as a result, and the Serbian Army managed to repulse every Austro- Hungarian assault despite a lack of ammunition. The Serbs began to run out of shells and Stepanović asked the Serbian Supreme Command that the artillery of the 2nd Army be redirected to its rear, as he felt that its failure to contribute to the defense of Lazarevac frustrated his troops and was bad for morale. Putnik instructed Stepanović to keep the artillery of the 2nd Army on the front and told him that the Russians had sent artillery shells for its guns. Stepanović was skeptical, but kept the artillery on the front line as instructed. By 24 November, Potiorek was predicting that Serbia would be defeated within a matter of days and appointed Stjepan Sarkotić to be the country's governor once it was occupied. The Austro-Hungarians made further gains on 25 November, forcing the Serbian Army from Čovka and Vrače Brdo with an intense artillery bombardment. On 26 November, they attempted to cross the Kolubara at its junction with the Sava River and managed to do so in their initial attack. The Serbs soon counterattacked and forced the invaders back, inflicting 50 percent casualties on the Austro-Hungarians and causing their offensive to grind to a halt. On 27 November, the Serbian Army attacked Čovka and Vrače Brdo and succeeded in forcing the Austro-Hungarians out. =Fall of Belgrade= Serbian soldiers on the island of Ada Ciganlija, in Belgrade Although the Serbian Army had put up fierce resistance and inflicted heavy casualties on the Austro-Hungarians, Putnik became concerned that his lines were over-extended. He began contemplating another strategic withdrawal, one in which Belgrade would have to be evacuated. On the night of 26–27 November, the Austro-Hungarian 6th Army attacked all along the front and pushed deeper into the Serbian interior. Defending along an over-extended front, the Serbian Supreme Command decided to abandon Belgrade. The city was evacuated on 29/30 November. The Austro-Hungarians entered the city on 1 December, prompting yet more celebrations in Vienna. The Serbian people withdrew alongside their army and many retreated to Niš, where news of Belgrade's fall was greeted \\"impassively\\", as it had been \\"expected since the beginning of the war\\". Albin Kutschbach, a German agent in Niš, reported: \\"More refugees are arriving by the day, and despite many people being sent on south, there are certainly still 60,000 people here.\\" Germany responded to the capture of Belgrade with delight and sent a congratulatory telegram to the Austro-Hungarian leadership. The Austro-Hungarians ascertained that their war with Serbia would soon be over and began preparing for the country's occupation. On 2 December, the anniversary of Franz Joseph's 66th year on the throne, Potiorek wrote that he was \\"laying town and fortress Belgrade at His Majesty's feet\\". =Serbian counterattack= It became increasingly clear to both Potiorek and Putnik that Austro-Hungarian supply lines were over-extended and so, on 1 December, Potiorek ordered the Austro-Hungarian 6th Army to stop and wait for the 5th Army to secure its supply lines east of the Valjevo railway, resulting in a short pause to all Austro-Hungarian military operations. Mišić exploited this brief respite by withdrawing the Serbian 1st Army a full from the front line and ensured that his soldiers had an opportunity to rest. The Serbian Army then converged around Mount Rudnik, where it received long-promised supplies from its allies via the Niš–Salonika railroad. Putnik's confidence in the ability of his army to launch a counterattack was restored. On 2 December, he ordered his forces to attack the Austro-Hungarians all along the front and informed his officers that the offensive was to have the specific purpose of improving Serbian morale. Determined to play his part, the aging Serbian king, Peter I, took a rifle and accompanied his troops to the front. The Serbian offensive caught the Austro-Hungarians by surprise, and at the time that the attack was launched they were holding a large military parade through the streets of Belgrade. The Austro-Hungarians now found themselves defending along an over-extended front as Potiorek had just begun strengthening his left flank, leaving the front line very lightly held. Potiorek knew that he could avoid a serious reversal on the battlefield by preventing the Serbian 1st Army from reaching the watershed of the Kolubara and Morava rivers, but the Serbs were confident. They discovered that the Austro-Hungarians had failed to adequately prepare for a Serbian counterattack, as their artillery was positioned well behind the front line. This meant that the Austro-Hungarian defenders would be unable to use their heavy guns to break up any Serbian advance. Rested and resupplied, the Serbs pushed forward towards Belgrade. By the night of 2 December, the Serbian 1st Army pushed several kilometres past Austro-Hungarian lines, taking a large number of prisoners and inflicting heavy casualties on the Austro-Hungarians. The 2nd and 3rd armies captured a number of important positions on high ground, while the Užice Army met fierce resistance but was ultimately able to push the Austro-Hungarians back. The offensive's initial success served to greatly enhance the morale of Serbian troops, just as Putnik had wanted. Significantly weakened, the Austro- Hungarians did not have time to recover before the offensive resumed the following morning and they were forced into retreat by the end of the day. On 6 December, the British ambassador to Serbia informed the British Government that the Serb offensive was \\"progressing brilliantly\\". That day, the Serbian Army had broken the Austro-Hungarians at their centre and on their right flank. Outmanoeuvred, the Austro-Hungarians were forced into a full retreat, abandoning their weapons and equipment as they went. Meanwhile, the Austro- Hungarians attempted to consolidate control around Belgrade. On 7 December, they attacked the right flank of the Serbian Army in the city's outskirts. On 8 December, the Austro-Hungarians fell back against Užice and Valjevo. The Serbs anticipated that their opponents would entrench themselves and attempt to block the Serbian Army's advance, but the Austro-Hungarians had failed to construct any defensive networks and, as such, were in no position to block the Serbian offensive. The Austro-Hungarians had ensured that Valjevo's defenses were fortified and had laid down artillery plans for the town's defense, but their lack of prior preparation meant that the hills surrounding the town were devoid of any significant defensive positions. The Serbs exploited this weakness by manoeuvring around the hills and encircling the Austro-Hungarians, suffering minimal casualties. The Serbian 3rd Army then broke through the defenses of the 6th Army at Mount Suvobor and stormed Valjevo. In Niš, the Bulgarian ambassador to Serbia reported: \\"The most improbable news from the battleground, sweet to the Serb ear, has been going around since this morning.\\" He wrote that, in the last three to four days, the Serbian Army had captured one Austro-Hungarian General, 49 officers and more than 20,000 troops, as well as 40 cannon and \\"huge quantities of war matériel\\". By 9 December, the Austro-Hungarian counter-offensive around Belgrade lost its momentum and the Austro-Hungarians began to retreat back towards the city centre. One Austro-Hungarian soldier wrote: \\"We could not have imagined that the Serbs were on our heels, after all we had recently been victorious.\\" On 10 December, the Serbian Army captured the lower reaches of the Drina, forcing the majority of surviving Austro-Hungarian troops to flee across the river. They did not stop until they had crossed the Sava and the Danube and entered the Banat. Very few Austro-Hungarian soldiers made it back into Bosnia. On 13 December, von Frank informed Potiorek that he considered it impossible for Austro-Hungarian forces to remain in Belgrade for much longer. As a result, Potiorek ordered the Austro-Hungarian forces in the city to withdraw. The Austro-Hungarians left Belgrade on 14 and 15 December and retreated back into Austria-Hungary under the cover of their river monitors on the Sava and the Danube. The Serbian Army re-entered Belgrade on 15 December and was in full control of the city by the end of the following day. Aftermath The battle ended in a decisive Serbian victory. A directive issued by the Serbian Supreme Command on 16 December reported: \\"The recapture of Belgrade marks the successful end of a great and magnificent period in our operations. The enemy is beaten, dispersed, defeated and expelled from our territory once and for all.\\" Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, the Austro-Hungarian Chief of the General Staff, attributed the defeat to a Serbian \\"thunder bolt from the south\\". The battle did not achieve any of Austria-Hungary's objectives: it failed to knock Serbia out of the war, it failed to induce Bulgaria to join the Central Powers and it failed to convince Romania to stay neutral. Austro-Hungarian historians concluded after the battle that defeat by Serbia constituted \\"a serious diminution in the Dual Monarchy's prestige and self-confidence\\". The battle, like the Battle of Cer before it, drew considerable attention to Serbia and many foreigners came to the country in late 1914 to offer political and humanitarian aid or to fight alongside the Serbian Army. German publicist Maximilian Harden wrote: \\"Serbia has risen from its grave on the field of Kosovo. From the source of the Kolubara River it will draw courage for the greatest battles of the whole century.\\" The Austro- Hungarians suffered about 225,000 casualties, including 30,000 killed, 173,000 wounded and 70,000 taken prisoner. They reported that 200 of their officers were taken prisoner during the battle and more than 130 cannon, 70 heavy machine-guns and a large quantity of matériel were captured. The Serbs also suffered heavy casualties, with 22,000 killed, 91,000 wounded and 19,000 missing or captured. The Western press was appalled with the scale of atrocities committed by the Austro-Hungarian troops against Serbian civilians, including women and children. William Shepard, of the United Press, confirmed as an eyewitness that at least eighteen towns were fully abandoned, and the whole of northwestern Serbia was nearly depopulated. Mišić was promoted to the rank of vojvoda for his command during the battle. Potiorek, on the other hand, was relieved of command on 22 December for \\"this most ignominious, rankling and derisory defeat\\". The decision reportedly made him suicidal. He was replaced by Archduke Eugen of Austria, who the Austro-Hungarians hoped would \\"restore Habsburg forces to the glory days of Prince Eugene\\". Von Frank was dismissed as commander of the 5th Army and replaced by Karl Tersztyánszky von Nádas, who had commanded the 4th Corps at the Battle of Cer. The 5th and 6th armies were then merged into a single 5th Army consisting of 95,000 men. Dobrica Ćosić's novel A Time of Death revolves around the battle. It was adapted into a stage play in 1983, titled The Battle of Kolubara.

History =First World War= No. 100 was established on 23 February 1917 at Hingham in Norfolk as the Royal Flying Corps' first squadron formed specifically as a night bombing unit and comprised elements of the Home Defence Wing. The unit was mobilised and crossed from Portsmouth on 21 March 1917 to France and was first based at St Andre-aux-Bois, where it received twelve Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2Bs aircraft on complement. These aircraft had been withdrawn from other units where they had operated in daylight, so modifications were required to adapt them for 100 Squadron's operational role.Stamford, Lincs., U.K.: FlyPast, Key Publishing Ltd 'The Boneyard' , April 2007 No. 309 Pages 15-18 On 1 April 1917, the unit moved to Izel-le-Hameau and took a further four aircraft on complement, in the form of BE2es. The squadron began operations on the night of 5/6 April 1917, when eleven FE2b aircraft attacked La Brayelle Airfield, Douai, where Manfred von Richthofen's 'Flying Circus' was based; Richthofen referred to this raid in his book, 'Der Rote Kampfflieger'. One hundred and twenty-eight 20 lb (9 kg) and four 40 lb (18 kg) bombs were dropped; four aircraft hangars were reported as having been set on fire and one of the attacking aircraft was lost. On 17 November 1918, 100 Squadron moved to RAF Saint Inglevert. On 4 March 1918, the squadron was sent to Ochey, near Nancy, to form the nucleus of the Independent Air Force under Major General Hugh Trenchard. In August of that year, the unit converted to Handley Page 0/400 heavy bombers and therefore longer range sorties over industrial sites in Germany became possible. The squadron conducted these raids throughout the rest of the war; an aircraft from the unit was the last in war-time to return to base (on the night before the Armistice) from a raid. =Inter war period= After the end of the war, the squadron remained on the continent until September 1919 as a cadre before transferring to RAF Baldonnel, near Dublin and re-forming to full strength, re-equipping with Bristol F.2 Fighters for army co-operation. Close air support operations were flown during the Irish War of Independence. Following the end of hostilities the squadron was moved to Spitalgate, Lincs. in February 1922 and converted to bombing, this time with Vickers Vimys and DH9As.Stamford, Lincs., U.K.: FlyPast, Key Publishing Ltd 'The Boneyard' April 2007 No. 309 Page 18 In May 1924, the unit was re-equipped with the Fairey Fawn. With these aircraft, the squadron performed air-mail carrying services breaking the General Strike of 1926. In September of that year, the squadron took Hawker Horsley aircraft on complement and in November 1930 moved to Donibristle, Fife, converting to torpedo-bombing. Its revised official designation as 'No. 100 (Torpedo-Bomber) Squadron' came later, in 1933. A further re-equipment came in November 1932, when the Vickers Vildebeest came on complement and with this aircraft the squadron was deployed as part of the operation to defend Singapore, arriving at Seletar in January 1934. =Second World War= Vickers Vildebeest Mark III torpedo bombers of 100 Squadron approaching left The squadron was put at readiness shortly after war was declared but, for the period to December 1941, there was little involvement operationally whilst still based at Seletar. In November and December 1941 detachments were sent to Fisherman's Bend, in Victoria, Australia. Intended replacement aircraft (Bristol Beauforts) for the remaining squadron were not forthcoming and, as part of operations against advancing Japanese forces, the unit's obsolete Vildebeest aircraft were used in strikes against enemy shipping. Because of this, during January 1942, the squadron lost most of its aircraft in engagements with Japanese fighters. Despite several attempts to remain operational as a combined unit along with No. 36 Squadron RAF, as Japan made advances in the Far East theatre, most personnel eventually became prisoners of war.Stamford, Lincs., U.K.: FlyPast, Key Publishing Ltd 'The Boneyard' , April 2007 No. 309 Pages 15-19 On 15 December 1942, No. 100 Squadron RAF proper was re-formed in the UK, at RAF Grimsby, near Waltham, as a night-time heavy bomber squadron and was part of No. 1 Group RAF, RAF Bomber Command. In January 1943, the squadron received the first of its new complement of Avro Lancasters; the first operation of the squadron was on 4 March 1943 against a U-boat base at St Nazaire. A few days later the squadron was involved in a raid against Nuremberg in Germany and from then on, as part of Bomber Command's strategic role against Germany, took part in every major raid.Stamford, Lincs., U.K.: FlyPast, Key Publishing Ltd 'The Boneyard' , April 2007 No. 309 Pages 20-21 At the end of 1943, the squadron had completed the second largest number of successful operations of units within No. 1 Group Bomber Command and had the lowest 'loss' rate. On the night of 16/17 December 1943, the squadron received orders to attack Berlin. The raid became known as 'Black Thursday' as Bomber Command lost 25 aircraft on the raid and 28 in crashes at fog-shrouded airfields. That night, 100 Squadron lost their commanding officer, David Holford, who crashed landed approaching RAF Grimsby. On the night of 5 June 1944, the squadron bombed heavy gun batteries in support of the D-Day invasion. For the last month of the war, the squadron moved to Elsham Wolds in Lincolnshire. In the latter stages of the war and post-war, the squadron was involved in the humanitarian Operations Manna and Exodus. At the end of December 1945 the squadron moved to RAF Scampton, being the last squadron on that station to operate the Avro Lancaster The squadron then departed for RAF Lindholme in May, 1946.Aviation Classics, March 2013 page 115 =Cold War= Between 1946 and 1950 the squadron was based at RAF Hemswell operating Avro Lancasters and later Avro Lincolns. The squadron left Hemswell in 1950, relocating to Malaysia where it was involved with Operations Firedog and Musgrave. In January 1954, the unit deployed to Eastleigh in Kenya during the Mau Mau Uprising. Returning two months later, the squadron was re-equipped with English Electric Canberras, moving to Wittering in Cambridgeshire. It was disbanded on 1 September 1959 but re-formed at Wittering on 1 May 1962, equipped with Handley Page Victor B.2s, which, from early 1964, carried the Blue Steel missile nuclear weapon. =Target Facilities role= 100 Squadron Hawk over Yorkshire, the flag can be seen below the cockpit.Disbanded again on 30 September 1968, the squadron was re-formed as a target facilities unit in 1972, utilising Canberra aircraft at RAF West Raynham, in Norfolk. 100 Sqn combined with 85 and 98 Squadrons and operated 26 Canberra aircraft from RAF Marham before moving in 1982 to RAF Wyton in Cambridgeshire. In 1991, the squadron converted to the Hawker Siddeley Hawk T1, which are now used for training and front-line support roles. On 31 August 1994, the squadron moved to RAF Finningley in South Yorkshire. After the news that RAF Finningley would be shut, 100 Squadron moved without its ground crew to RAF Leeming. =Flying training= In January 2019, it was announced that, as No. 100 Squadron has a degree of spare capacity in terms of its operations, it would take on an additional role of fast jet flying training. This was undertaken owing to limited capacity in the RAF's existing operation using the Hawk T.2 aircraft, and came three years after fast jet training using the Hawk T.1 was officially ended with the disbanding of 208 Squadron in 2016. The squadron is expected to retire its Hawk T1 aircraft in 2027. The aircraft's role was to be replaced by the Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) programme, which was intended to provide aggressor training to all three British armed services. However, in March 2019, the ASDOT programme was cancelled. Notable personnel *Wing Commander R V McIntyre, Commanding Officer of the squadron from April to November 1943.

It was later embellished with the squadron name and the motto Blood and Bones. The original flag disintegrated while being looked after by a Flight Lieutenant Trillwood during his time as a Japanese prisoner of war.

Naval career Hughes joined the Royal Navy in 1735, and four years later, was present at the capture of Portobelo, Panama.Sir Edward Hughes at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography In 1740, he was promoted to lieutenant and served in the Cartagena expedition of 1741, and at the indecisive Battle of Toulon in 1744. In HMS Warwick, he participated in the action against the Glorioso, but without proper support from the Lark (which was sailing with the Warwick), the enemy escaped. The commander of the Lark was subsequently tried and condemned for his conduct, and Hughes received the vacated command. Captain Hughes was with Edward Boscawen at Louisburg and with Charles Saunders at Quebec. Captain Sir Edward Hughes, circa 1720-94 by Violante Beatrice Siries from the collection of the National Maritime Museum. He was in continual employment during the peace, and as commodore, commanded the East Indies Station from 1773 to 1777. Before long, he returned to the East Indies Station as a rear-admiral, with an overwhelming naval force. On his outward voyage, he took Gorée from the French, and he was called upon to conduct only minor operations for the next two years, as the enemy could not muster any force fit to meet the powerful squadron Hughes had brought from the Channel. With Spain and Great Britain at war, Spanish authorities in Chile received a warning that Hughes was heading to Chilean coasts for an imminent attack. In 1782, at the reopening of hostilities in the East Indies, he stormed Trincomalee a few days before the squadron of Suffren arrived in the neighbourhood. For the next year, these Indian waters were the scene of one of the most famous of naval campaigns. Suffren was perhaps the ablest naval commander that France ever produced, but his subordinates were factious and unskilful; Hughes on the other hand, whose ability was that born of long experience rather than genius, was well supported. No fewer than five fiercely contested general actions were fought by the two fleets, neither of them gaining a decisive advantage. In the end, Hughes held his ground. After the peace, he returned to England, and, though further promotions came to him, he never again hoisted his flag. He had accumulated considerable wealth during his Indian service, which for the most part he spent in unostentatious charity. He died at his seat of Luxborough in Essex in 1794. His second wife Ruth died in 1800. Hughes' fortune went to Edward Hughes Ball Hughes (c. 1798 – 1863), her grandson by a previous marriage, who became the dandy and wastrel known as \\"The Golden Ball\\". Tribute The British East India Company ship the Sir Edward Hughes launched in 1784, was named after him.

They were large herbivores that flourished during the Permian period. Parareptiles form a sister clade to reptiles and birds. Description Restoration of Bradysaurus Pareiasaurs ranged in size from long, and may have weighed up to . They were stocky, with short tails, small heads, robust limbs, and broad feet. The cow-sized species Bunostegos, which lived 260 million years ago, is the earliest known example of a tetrapod with a fully erect posture as its legs were positioned directly under its body.Pre- reptile may be earliest known to walk upright on all fours Pareiasaurs were protected by bony scutes called osteoderms that were set into the skin. Their heavy skulls were ornamented with multiple knobs and ridges. The leaf-shaped multi-cusped teeth resemble those of iguanas, caseids, and other reptilian herbivores. This dentition, together with the deep body, which may have housed an extensive digestive tract, are evidence of a herbivorous diet. Most authors have assumed a terrestrial lifestyle for pareiasaurs, but bone microanatomy suggests a more aquatic, plausibly amphibious lifestyle. Evolutionary history Pareiasaurs appear very suddenly in the fossil record. It is clear that these animals are parareptiles.Gauthier, J., Kluge, A.G. and Rowe, T. (1988). \\"The early evolution of the Amniota.\\" Pp. 103–155 in Benton, M.J. (ed.), The phylogeny and classification of the tetrapods, Volume 1: amphibians, reptiles, birds. Oxford: Clarendon Press. As such, they are closely related to Nycteroleterids. Like Rhipaeosaurs, they may have filled the large herbivore niche (or guild) that had been occupied early in the Permian period by the Caseid pelycosaurs and, before them, the Diadectid amphibians and Edaphosaur reptiles. They are much larger than the diadectids, more similar to the giant caseid pelycosaur Cotylorhynchus. Although the last Pareiasaurs were no larger than the first types (indeed, many of the last ones became smaller), there was a definite tendency towards increased armour as the group developed. Classification Some paleontologists considered that pareiasaurs were direct ancestors of modern turtles. Pareiasaur skulls have several turtle-like features, and in some species the scutes have developed into bony plates, possibly the precursors of a turtle shell. Jalil and Janvier, in a large analysis of pareiasaur relationships, also found turtles to be close relatives of the \\"dwarf\\" pareiasaurs, such as Pumiliopareia. However, the discovery of Pappochelys argues against a potential pareisaurian relationship to turtles. =Associated clades= Hallucicrania (Lee 1995): This clade was coined by MSY Lee for Lanthanosuchidae + (Pareiasauridae + Testudines). Lee's pareiasaur hypothesis has become untenable due to the diapsid features of the stem turtle Pappochelys and the potential testudinatan nature of Eunotosaurus. Recent cladistic analyses reveal that lanthanosuchids have a much more basal position in the Procolophonomorpha, and that the nearest sister taxon to the pareiasaurs are the rather unexceptional and conventional looking nycteroleterids (Müller & Tsuji 2007, Lyson et al. 2010) the two being united in the clade Pareiasauromorpha (Tsuji et al. 2012). Pareiasauroidea (Nopcsa, 1928): This clade (as opposed to the superfamily or suborder Pareiasauroidea) was used by Lee (1995) for Pareiasauridae + Sclerosaurus. More recent cladistic studies place Sclerosaurus in the procolophonid subfamily Leptopleuroninae (Cisneros 2006, Sues & Reisz 2008), which means the similarities with pareiasaurs are the result of convergences. Pareiasauria (Seeley, 1988): If neither Lanthanosuchids or Testudines are included in the clade, the Pareiasauria only contains the monophyletic family Pareiasauridae. It's a traditional linnaean term. =Phylogeny= Below is a cladogram from Tsuji et al. (2013): References * Carroll, R. L., (1988), Vertebrate Paleontology and Evolution, W.H. Freeman & Co.

Lechón is a Spanish word referring to a roasted baby piglet which was still fed by suckling its mother’s milk (a suckling pig). Lechón is a popular food in Spain, Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and other Spanish- speaking nations in Latin America. The dish features a whole roasted suckling pig cooked over charcoal. It has been described as a national dish of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Spain. Additionally, it is popular in the Philippines and other Austronesian regions, whose pig-roasting traditions have native pre- colonial origins. Although it acquired the Spanish name as a general term for “roasted pig“, in these regions it more often refers to adult roasted pigs, not lechones (milk suckling pigs). It is also sometimes considered as one of the unofficial national dishes of the Philippines, with Cebu being asserted by American chef Anthony Bourdain as having the best pigs. Variants by country =Philippines= In most regions of the Philippines, lechón (also spelled litson or lichon) is prepared throughout the year for special occasions, festivals, and the holidays. Although it acquired the Spanish name, Philippine lechón has pre-Hispanic origins as pigs are one of the native domesticated animals of all Austronesian cultures and were carried throughout the Austronesian Expansion all the way to Polynesia. It is a national dish of the Philippines. There are two major types of preparing lechon the Philippines, the \\"Manila lechon\\" (or \\"Luzon lechon\\"), and the \\"Cebu lechon\\" (or \\"Visayas lechon\\"). As the usage of the Spanish loanword evolved over the years in the languages of the Philippines, \\"lechón\\" has come to refer to roasted pig in general (including suckling pigs). Roasted suckling pigs are now referred to in the Philippines as “lechón de leche” (which in Spanish would be a linguistic redundancy, though corresponding to the term cochinillo in Spain). Lechón being roasted in Cadiz, Negros Occidental, Philippines Visayan lechon is prepared stuffed with herbs which usually include scallions, bay leaves, black peppercorn, garlic, salt, and distinctively tanglad (lemongrass) and/or leaves from native Citrus trees or tamarind trees, among other spices. A variant among Hiligaynon people also stuffs the pig with the sour fruits of batuan or binukaw (Garcinia binucao). It is usually cooked over charcoal made from coconut husks. Since it is already flavored with spices, it is served with minimal dipping sauces, like salt and vinegar or silimansi (soy sauce, calamansi, and labuyo chili). Luzon lechon on the other hand, is typically not stuffed with herbs. When it is, it is usually just salt and pepper. Instead, the distinctiveness of Manila lechon comes from the liver-based sauce, known as the \\"lechon sauce\\". Lechon sauce is made from vinegar, brown sugar, salt, pepper, mashed liver (or liver spread), breadcrumbs, garlic and onion. Manila lechon is also typically cooked over woodfire. Most lechon can either be cooked based on the two main versions, or mix techniques from both. Both variants also rub salt or spices unto the skin to make it crispier, as well as continually baste the lechon as it cooks. Sometimes carbonated drinks may also be used. They are cooked on a bamboo spit over charcoal for a few hours with constant (traditionally manual) turning. The pig is roasted on all sides for several hours until done. The process of cooking and basting usually results in making the pork skin crisp and is a distinctive feature of the dish. Leftover parts from the lechon, such as the head and feet, are usually cooked into another popular dish, lechon paksiw. Like lechon itself, lechon paksiw also differs based on whether it is prepared Luzon-style or Visayas-style, with the former using liver sauce as an essential ingredient, while the latter does not. In some cases, these parts or stale lechon can be repurposed into another dish, such as Sisig. =Puerto Rico= The dish has been described as a national dish of Puerto Rico. The name of the dish in Puerto Rico is lechon asado. It is a traditional dish served at festivals and holidays.

It follows the adventures of three companions, Lief, Barda, and Jasmine, as they journey across the magical land of Deltora to awaken the last seven dragons and destroy the Four Sisters (creations of the evil Shadow Lord, which have been poisoning Deltora's crops causing the people and creatures of the land to starve). It comprises four books which were first published in Australia in 2004 and 2005 in the United States by Scholastic. The Dragons of Deltora series is preceded by two other series that take place in the same fictional world and feature the same characters and continues the story. These series are Deltora Quest and Deltora Quest 2 (also known as Deltora Shadowlands). Collectively, these three series are known as the Deltora Quest series or the Deltora series. The novels in this series are Dragon's Nest, Shadowgate, Isle of the Dead, and The Sister of the South. Characters The Guardians of the Four Sisters Just as the gems of Deltora had guardians in Deltora Quest, the Four Sisters each had a guardian to defend them. These guardians included: =Rolf= A Capricon and servant of the Shadow Lord, Rolf is the Guardian of the East who is first encountered in the Os-Mine Hills. In series three, he is captured by Granous and saved by Lief and his companions. Proclaiming that he is a prince, he is taken into Lief's party out of pity and later on believed to have been killed by a ruby dragon, though this is false. He is the one that takes the form of a ruby dragon and destroys the companions' escort. He tries to destroy the companions when they reach Dragon's Nest, but is defeated by the true Ruby Dragon and Lief. =Kirsten the Masked One= A woman that Lief, Barda, and Jasmine discover in a castle in the mountains. She was Mariette's sister and Bede's girlfriend until Bede chose Mariette over her. This made Kirsten bitter with resentment and so she allied herself with the Shadow Lord for vengeance. The Shadow Lord gave Kirsten magical powers and thus she became the Masked One, now a sorceress with the appearance of a black-cloaked figure with a green mask and pale hands that could kill others just by touching them. She used her power to enslave Bede and imprison Mariette in her locket. She also had the power to conjure phantoms of herself in Deltora, a technique she used to try to kill her enemies. In return she was given the task of guarding the Sister of the North. When Lief, Barda and Jasmine went to her castle, they at first thought that she is under Bede's power, however Bede was able to clue them in with his song. Kirsten almost killed Barda and Jasmine when she caused the walls of her castle to swallow them. However, as Lief jumped into the snake pit that the Sister of the North was contained within. The snakes in the pit latched onto Kirsten and bit her, killing her with their venom very slowly because Kirsten was protected by an enchanted spell. =Doran the Dragonlover= Also known as \\"Dragonfriend\\" by the dragons, Doran is Deltora's greatest explorer and was a kind and noble man. He developed everlasting friendships with Deltora's dragons and even explored Deltora's underworld and befriended the Pirran people that had sheltered themselves there. When the Ak- Baba killed nearly all of the dragons of Deltora, Doran went to each of the remaining dragons and had them go into a deep hibernation until they were woken by Adin's heir wearing the Belt. Doran then found out too late that the Dragons were an obstacle to the Shadow Lord's plan to plant the Four Sisters throughout Deltora and by having the dragons go into hibernation, Doran had removed this obstacle once and for all. Doran then drew a map to where the Four Sisters were located and asked the map to be delivered to the King, but the people of Deltora thought he was mad. His map was found by the Shadow Lord and torn into four pieces. Doran then went into the wilderness to find another way to get rid of the Sisters and was never seen again. Later it was revealed that the Shadow Lord had captured Doran and as punishment for resisting him, Doran was forced to become the immortal vessel of the Sister of the West (having the Sister contained inside his own body) and thus he was unwillingly forced to become the Guardian of the Sister of the West. He became situated in the Kobb's lair on the Isle of the Dead. Lief and his group managed to finally meet him and Doran was saddened to discover that the diamond dragon was dead, but was overcome with joy when he found out her daughter still lived. Veritas, the amethyst dragon, was forced to destroy Doran by stealing his breath in order to destroy the Sister of the West that he guarded, but knowing that the diamond dragon species still lived and that there was still hope for Deltora, Doran died a peaceful death as he disintegrated into dust. =Paff= When Ranesh left to Tora, this young girl took his place as assistant librarian to Josef, but it is revealed she is a servant of The Shadow Lord and guardian of The Sister of the South. She was made such in the Shadowlands, while her dark Master concocted his plan. As one of the cruelest guardians, she pumped Josef for information, and, when she had no further use for him, poisoned him. Far from punishing her, Doom and Lief pity her as she dies. Paff had gone willingly, it seems, to the Shadow Lord, partly because she hated everybody who did not appear to love her. Riddles & Codes There are many riddles, poems and codes throughout the books. These are a few of them: =Map pieces= The four map pieces (East, North, West, and South) that were made by Doran the Dragonlover and helped Lief find the four sisters each had a fourth of a poem. > Sisters four with poisoned breath/ Bring to the land a long slow death. > But death comes swiftly if you dare/ To find each sisters hidden lair. > Their songs like secret rivers flow/ To hold the peril deep below. > And if at last their voices cease/ The land will find a final peace. The companions thought that meant after they defeated all four Sisters the Shadow Lord might give up on trying to rule all of Deltora. =Sisters' warning stones= At the entrance to each Sister's lair there is an inscribed stone with a poem warning travelers away. At the entrance to Dragon's Nest the stone inscription said: > Travellers do not pass this way, all are doomed who disobey. > Turn your faces to the west, death awaits in Dragon's Nest. At the entrance to Kirsten's castle the poem was: > Do not enter this domain, flee this realm of fear and pain. > Death and terror both await, those who enter Shadowgate. At the foot of the rock bridge on the Isle of the Dead the inscription said: > If you pass your fate is sealed, ahead pure evil lies concealed. > Turn while you have life and breath, flee this realm of living death. Under the chapel altar in the palace the carved stone was different than the other three. Instead of a warning to travelers and passerby, it was a taunt to Lief himself. It read: > Lose and win? Or win and lose? Royal coward, you must choose. > Bow your head and creep away, or you and yours will curse this day. =Codes= The first code was from Fa-Glin. The code was just two paragraphs separated into groups of four letters. The code's translation said: I grieve to tell you that the new crop we pinned our hopes has been disappointing. The vines were sickly from the first, and only six baskets of small, sour fruit resulted from all our care. the yam harvest was also very bad, many of the yams having rotted in the ground. Hunting is poor. There are few fish in the stream. If only we could eat the fruit like our neighbours the Kin! The boolong trees thrive like the weeds they are, but all parts of them disagree with us. It will be another hard winter on Dread Mountain, I fear.

As president of the MPAA, he abbreviated the organization's name, convened the closed-door meeting of motion picture company executives at New York City's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel that led to Waldorf Statement in 1947 and the Hollywood blacklist (including firing of the Hollywood Ten), and discreetly liberalized the production code. He served as president of the MPAA until his death in 1963. Background Johnston studied at the University of Washington (here, aerial view, circa 1922) An Episcopalian, Johnston was born \\"Eric Johnson\\" in Washington, D.C. His father, a pharmacist, moved the family to Marysville, Montana, when Johnston was a year old. In 1905, the family moved to Spokane, Washington. The Johnsons divorced in 1911, and Eric's mother, Ida, changed her and her son's last name to \\"Johnston.\\" He attended the University of Washington, where he joined the Theta Delta Chi fraternity and graduated in 1917. During this time, he worked as a stevedore, newspaper sports columnist, library clerk, and shoe salesman. Career To pay for college, Johnston worked in many jobs, including stevedore (here, longshoremen on a New York dock load barrels of corn syrup onto a barge on the Hudson River, photographed by Lewis Hine circa 1912) When the United States entered World War I, Johnston enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He was commissioned a second lieutenant, and became a Reserve Officers' Training Corps commander at the University of Washington in 1918. He was promoted to captain, fought with the American Expeditionary Force Siberia in the Russian Revolution, and was named military attaché in Peking. Johnston acquired some Mandarin, traveled widely in Asia, and successfully speculated in Chinese currency. While in Beijing, Johnston was assaulted by an unknown person. His skull was fractured, which led to sinus infections and lung ailments and his discharge from the Corps in 1922 for medical reasons. Johnston returned to Spokane for its dry climate, where he married his long- time girlfriend, Ina Hughes. He became a vacuum-cleaner salesman, and bought the Power Brown Co., the Pacific Northwest's largest independent appliance distribution business. In 1924, the newly renamed Brown-Johnston Company purchased the Doerr-Mitchell Electric Co., a manufacturer of electrical appliances, ironwork and glassware.\\"Milestones\\", Time, August 30, 1963. Johnston was elected president of the Spokane Chamber of Commerce in 1931. He became managing trustee of the bankrupt Washington Brick and Lime Co., led it out of bankruptcy, and became its chairman. Johnston also became president of the Wayne-Burnaby Company, a regional electrical contractor. =US Chamber of Commerce= Johnston was president of the United States Chamber of Commerce (here, circa 2008) from 1942 through 1945 As a rising regional businessman, Johnston became active in the national Chamber of Commerce. He was appointed to its tax committee in 1933, elected a director in 1934, and elected vice president in 1941. Johnston became head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce after a revolt by younger, moderate business executives pushed several older, conservative candidates aside. He refused to antagonize the American Federation of Labor or the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and advocated labor-management cooperation. Johnston persuaded the labor federations to make a no-strike pledge during World War II. In 1940, Johnston ran in the Republican primary for Senator from Washington state, but placed a distant second place with only 18 percent of the vote. In 1941, Johnston became the youngest person ever elected as president for its one-year term, re-elected three times. In 1942, Johnston took over as president of the US Chamber of Commerce. He served on several wartime commissions for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, including the Committee for Economic Development, the War Manpower Commission, and the War Mobilization and Reconversion Committee. In 1943, President Roosevelt named him chairman of the United States Commission on InterAmerican Development. He traveled widely in Latin America, reassuring heads of state that the United States intended to protect them in the event of war. In 1944, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin invited Johnston to tour Russia. Johnston agreed, and Roosevelt appointed him an emissary of the United States. Johnston spent nearly a month in the Soviet Union, and was the first American diplomat to tour the Central Asian Republics of the Soviet Union. He met with Stalin for three hours at a time when Ambassador W. Averell Harriman had yet to present his credentials to the premier.Lawrence, \\"Soviet Is Pictured As Big U.S. Market\\", New York Times, June 20, 1944; Reston, \\"Johnston Extols Soviet Peace Aim\\", New York Times, July 14, 1944. Johnston retired as Chamber of Commerce president in 1945. =MPAA= Johnston was named president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association (MPPDAA), the predecessor of the MPAA, in 1946. He immediately changed the name of the organization to its current title, the Motion Picture Association of America. Hollywood blacklist In September 1947, the motion picture industry came under sharp criticism by the House Un-American Activities Committee for allegedly permitting known communist sympathizers to include pro-communist messages in motion pictures. Spurred by Red-baiting members of the MPAA as well as a fear of government censorship, Johnston agreed to institute a blacklist. On November 25, 1947, Johnston was part of a closed-door meeting with 47 motion picture company executives at New York City's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel that resulted in the \\"Waldorf Statement\\". Johnston issued a two-page press release that marked the beginning of the Hollywood blacklist. Production code During his tenure at the MPAA, Johnston quietly liberalized the production code.Canby, \\"A New Movie Code Ends Some Taboos\\", New York Times, September 21, 1966; \\"Old Movie Taboos Eased in New Code For Film Industry\\", New York Times, December 12, 1956. He also engaged in major initiatives to secure a significant American share of the overseas motion picture market, and to reduce restrictions on the screening of American films in foreign markets.After World War II, many nations placed limits on the number of foreign-produced films which could be shown. These restrictions were designed to promote domestic film production. Since Hollywood produced more motion pictures than most of the world combined, these restrictions severely limited foreign distribution of American films. See Zeiler, Free Trade, Free World: The Advent of GATT, 1999; \\"Heads Film Export Unit\\", Associated Press, October 2, 1945. =Government appointments= In January 1951, Johnston was appointed administrator of the Economic Stabilization Agency by President Harry S. Truman, replacing Alan Valentine. He lasted only a few months in the job.Loftus, \\"Johnston Is Named Stabilizing Chief\\", New York Times, January 20, 1951; \\"Johnston Leaving Defense Job Nov. 30\\", New York Times, November 16, 1951. In 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Johnston a \\"Special Representative of the President of the United States\\" to deal with the water conflict between Israel, Jordan, and Syria. He worked to solve the Middle East's water problems by negotiating the Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan.Cronin, p. 189.The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) commissioned a plan for the development of the Jordan River; this became widely known as \\"The Johnston plan\\". The plan was modelled on the Tennessee Valley Authority development plan for the development of the Jordan River as a single unit. See: Shapland, p. 14. In 1958, Johnston traveled to the Soviet Union and met Premier Nikita Khrushchev. In 1959, he hosted Khrushchev in both Washington, D.C., and California during Khrushchev's 18-day visit to the United States.Frankel, \\"U.S., Soviet Agree to Film Exchange\\", New York Times, October 10, 1958; Schumach, \\"Khrushchev Sets Hollywood Agog\\", New York Times, September 10, 1959. Jack Valenti succeeded Johnston as MPAA president Johnston continued at MPAA until his death in 1963. He was succeeded at the MPAA by Jack Valenti in 1966 after a three-year search.Crowther, \\"New Czar on the Job\\", New York Times, May 1, 1966. Personal life and death Johnston supported Wendell Wilkie (here, 3 March 1940) during the 1940 Republican Party presidential primaries. Johnston married Ina Harriet Hughes; they had two daughters.

He graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Medical School and spent the early part of his career at Beth Israel Hospital (now Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center). He was the founder of Blood, the prime core clinical journal of hematology, in 1946. He is also credited with describing the concept of myeloproliferative diseases in 1951. In addition, he participated in the first studies of nitrogen mustard in various hematological malignancies, widely considered the first uses of chemotherapy in malignant diseases. Dr Dameshek was also the first one who described chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a common form of leukemia in adults. Dr. Dameshek served as president of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in 1964. He made numerous contributions to ASH as well as the field of hematology and was the first editor of its journal Blood. Given Dr. Dameshek's accomplishments, ASH has named the Dameshek Prize in his honor. Each year the Dameshek Prize is awarded to an individual who has made an outstanding contribution in hematology.

She set a women's record for the 12-hour time-trial which exceeded the men's record for two years. Early life Burton was born Beryl Charnock in the Halton area of Leeds, West Yorkshire and lived in the nearby Morley area throughout her life, racing mainly for Morley Cycling Club and later Knaresborough CC. In childhood, she suffered chronic health problems which included 15 months in hospital and a convalescent home due to rheumatic fever. Cycling She was introduced to cycling through her husband, Charlie, whom she married in 1955. Charlie described her development as a cyclist as follows: > \\"First of all, she was handy but wasn’t that competent: we used to have to > push her round a bit. Slowly she got better. By the second year, she was > ‘one of the lads’ and could ride with us. By the third year, she was going > out in front and leading them all. By then it was 1956 and she decided to do > a bit of time trialling because I was dabbling at it.\\" In 1957, she took her first national medal, a silver in the national 100-mile individual time trial championship, and before the decade was out was competing internationally. Despite receiving offers from sponsors, she remained an amateur throughout her career, working on a rhubarb farm during much of it. =International honours= Burton competing on the track in 1967 Burton won the women’s world road race championship in 1960 and 1967 and was runner-up in 1961. On the track, she specialised in the individual pursuit, winning world championship medals almost every year across three decades. She was world champion five times (1959, 1960, 1962, 1963 and 1966), silver- medallist three times (1961, 1964 and 1968), and winner of bronze in 1967, 1970, 1971 and 1973. =Domestic domination= In domestic time trial competition, Burton was almost unbeatable. She won the Road Time Trials Council’s British Best All-Rounder Competition for 25 consecutive years from 1959 to 1983. In total, she won 72 national individual time trial titles; she won four at 10 miles (the championship was inaugurated in 1978), 26 at 25 miles, 24 at 50 miles and 18 at 100 miles. Her last national solo time trial titles were achieved in 1986 (at 25 and 50 miles; she was part of the fastest team, Knaresborough CC, in the 50 mile event in 1969). She also won a further 24 national titles in road racing and on the track: twelve road race championships, and 12 pursuit titles. =Record-breaker= In 1963, Burton became the first woman to break the hour barrier for the 25-mile time trial, subsequently also going below two hours for the 50-mile TT and four hours for 100 miles against the clock. In 1967, she set a new 12-hour time trial record of 277.25 milesCTT Competition Records – Women . Cyclingtimetrials.org.uk. Retrieved on 11 January 2013. – a mark that surpassed the men’s record of the time by 0.73 miles and was not superseded by a man until 1969.CTT Competition Records – Men . Cyclingtimetrials.org.uk. Retrieved on 11 January 2013. While setting the record she caught and passed Mike McNamara who was on his way to setting the men's record at 276.52 miles and winning that year's men's British Best All-Rounder. She is reputed to have given him a liquorice allsort as she passed him.Woodland, L. (2005), This Island Race, Mousehold Press, p. 174, She also set about 50 new national records at 10, 15, 25, 30, 50 and 100-mile distances; her final 10, 25 and 50-mile records each lasted 20 years before being broken, her 100-mile record lasted 28 years, and her 12-hour record stood for 50 years until 2017. Her prowess led to the rare distinction, for a woman, of an invitation to compete in the Grand Prix des Nations in 1967. In 1982, with her daughter Denise, Burton set a British 10-mile record for women riding a tandem bicycle: 21 minutes, 25 seconds. Awards Recognition of her sporting achievements came with her appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1964 and an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1968. Burton also won UK cycling's top accolade, the Bidlake Memorial Prize, a record three times, in 1959, 1960 and 1967. Personal life Her daughter, Denise, was also a top cyclist, winning a bronze in the 1975 world individual pursuit championship. Mother and daughter were both selected to represent Great Britain in the 1972 world championship. In 1973 Beryl won the national road title ahead of Denise. Three years later their positions were reversed - Beryl refused to shake hands with Denise on the podium afterwards, later explaining the incident in her autobiography Personal Best: \\"I thought Denise had not done her whack in keeping the break away and once again I had ‘made the race'… It was not a sporting thing to do… I can only plead I was not myself at the time\\". Burton, who had always had a somewhat odd heart arrhythmia, died of heart failure during a social ride, when she was out delivering birthday invitations for her 59th birthday party. Her daughter also suggested that Burton's competitive spirit and drive eventually just wore her body out. Legacy A memorial garden, Beryl Burton Gardens, was established in her home town of Morley. Morley Cycling Club also donated a trophy (previously won 20 times by Burton) to the RTTC for a Champion of Champions competition for women of all ages: the Beryl Burton trophy. The Beryl Burton Cycle Way allows cyclists to travel the 2.8 km between Harrogate and Knaresborough without using the A59 road. In 2009, she was inducted into the British Cycling Hall of Fame. In 2018 she was named as one of the first two inductees into the Rouleur Hall of Fame, alongside Eddy Merckx. =Golden Book= Burton's career achievements were first celebrated in 1960 when Cycling Weekly awarded her a page in the Golden Book of Cycling. By 1991 her career had developed so far that she was accorded the unique honour of a second 'Golden Book' page. =Play= On 27 November 2012 a radio play, Beryl: A Love Story On Two Wheels, about Burton, written by actress Maxine Peake, was broadcast by BBC Radio 4, with Peake playing Burton. It included interview snippets with Charlie Burton, and his and Burton's cycling champion daughter, Denise Burton Cole. The radio play was adapted by Peake for the stage to coincide with the start of the Tour de France in Leeds, and shown at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in June and July 2014 titled simply Beryl. The play returned for a second run at the West Yorkshire Playhouse a year later in June and July 2015, followed by an autumn 2015 tour around England. A production of the show is scheduled to take place at the Octagon Theatre, Bolton in September and October of 2019.

They were written to cash in on the explosive popularity of such books, spawned by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone's Fighting Fantasy and later Joe Dever's Lone Wolf series. The books allow the reader to become a lone adventurer on a planet called Skyfall which was colonized by humans who were fugitives from a dying planet. Although the population of humans on the planet has grown over an undisclosed period of time (hinted at being a few hundred years) to the point where they now outnumber indigenous races, the planet remains largely untamed. The humans themselves are largely hemmed in to a small Kingdom known as Delta. The series' major deviation from others of the genre was a unique system for organizing combat. Whereas most gamebooks and Role-Playing Games involve the use of dice to create randomness, the Skyfall series adopted a system of coin tosses.

In 1983, while a student at the University of Southern California's School of Engineering (currently the Viterbi School of Engineering), he wrote a program for a parasitic application that seized control of computer operations, one of the first computer viruses, in Leonard Adleman’s class. He wrote a short program, as an experiment, that could \\"infect\\" computers, make copies of itself, and spread from one machine to another. It was hidden inside a larger, legitimate program, which was loaded into a computer on a floppy disk. One of the few solid theoretical results in the study of computer viruses is Cohen's 1987 demonstration that there is no algorithm that can perfectly detect all possible viruses.An Undetectable Computer Virus (academic paper) Cohen also believed there are positive viruses and he had created one called the compression virus which spreading would infect all executable files on a computer, not to destroy, but to make them smaller.Burger, Ralph, 1991. Computer Viruses and Data Protection, pp. 19-20 During the past 10 years of his research work, Fred Cohen wrote over 60 professional publications and 11 books.

He is globally recognized as an innovative expert in management, particularly related to information technology and risk. He supports strategic enterprise- wide decision-making ranging from restructuring to litigation support. His team approach involves an in-depth study of key issues and the development of unique strategies and solutions. Results are often leveraged behind the scenes to support research and advisory firms like Gartner and Burton, government initiatives like standards development and capacity building, University education and training programs on five continents, and global cooperative research and development programs.

Lipids are universally recognized as major components of human and animal meibum. An update in 2009 on the composition of human meibum and on the structures of various positively identified meibomian lipids was published. Currently, the most sensitive and informative approach to lipidomic analysis of meibum is mass spectrometry, either with direct infusion or in combination with liquid chromatography. Proteins In humans, more than 90 different proteins have been identified in meibomian gland secretions. Clinical significance Meibomian glands in the lower eyelid imaged under amber light to show vasculature support and the gland structure. Dysfunctional meibomian glands often cause dry eyes, one of the more common eye conditions. They may also contribute to blepharitis. Inflammation of the meibomian glands (also known as meibomitis, meibomian gland dysfunction, or posterior blepharitis) causes the glands to be obstructed by thick waxy secretions. Besides leading to dry eyes, the obstructions can be degraded by bacterial lipases, resulting in the formation of free fatty acids, which irritate the eyes and sometimes cause punctate keratopathy. Meibomian gland dysfunction is more often seen in women and is regarded as the main cause of dry eye disease. Factors that contribute to meibomian gland dysfunction can include things such as a person's age and/or hormones, or severe infestation of Demodex brevis mite. Treatment can include warm compresses, or expression of the gland by a professional. Lifitegrast and Restasis are topical medication commonly used to control the inflammation and improve the oil quality. In some cases topical steroids and topical/oral antibiotics are also prescribed to reduce inflammation. Intense pulsed light (IPL) treatments have also been shown to reduce inflammation and improve gland function. Meibomian gland probing is also used on patients who experience deep clogging of the glands. Meibomian gland dysfunction may be caused by some prescription medications, notably isotretinoin.

In 1990s he ran the UK comics titles Judge Dredd Megazine (1991–2002) and 2000 AD (1995–2000). He has since become a prolific author and received his first drama scriptwriting credit when BBC Radio 4 broadcast his radio play Island Blue: Ronald in June 2006. In 2007, he won the PAGE International Screenwriting Award in the short film category for his script Danny's Toys, and was a finalist in the 2009 PAGE Awards with his script The Woman Who Screamed Butterflies. Biography Bishop was sub-editor of the Judge Dredd Megazine and of Crisis,Crisis #54, editorial, January 1991 before becoming the editor of the Megazine from 1991 to 2002. He became the editor of 2000 AD just before Christmas 1995, staying four and a half years before resigning to become a freelance writer in the summer of 2000. Bishop was responsible for discovering many new British talents, including: *Andy Diggle *Robbie Morrison *Siku *Frank Quitely *Dean Ormston *Chris Halls (comics pseudonym of video director Chris Cunningham) *Simon Fraser *Jim Murray He also, with collaborator Roger Langridge, contributed the insane asylum-set strip The Straitjacket Fits. Since leaving 2000 AD in the year 2000, Bishop has enjoyed a successful career as a freelance writer, working on novels of Doctor Who, Judge Dredd, Heroes and Nikolai Dante, as well as comic strip adventures of The Phantom. His Doctor Who novel Who Killed Kennedy, a journalist's point-of-view on the early Third Doctor stories, is highly popular with fans. Despite his successes as a comics editor and as a writer of prose, Bishop scripted many extremely unpopular comic strips in 2000 AD and the Megazine, including the comics adaptation of A Life Less Ordinary, with art by Steve Yeowell. The Spacegirls, a badly executed parody of the Spice Girls, is on the list of 2000 AD's 20 Worst Strips as chosen by fan rating on the official website.2000AD Online - thrill zone His most recent effort — a Fiends of the Eastern Front series for the Megazine — has proven much more popular with readers. Away from British comics, his work on The Phantom has won awards for the \\"Best Phantom story of the year\\" for Egmont on several occasions. Bishop introduced several new important characters to the Phantom mythos, such as the pirate queen Kate Sommerset, which grew so popular with readers that Bishop was able to make her the main character of five stories. In 2006, Bishop also signed on to participate in the writing of stories for American publisher Moonstone Books' two collections of Phantom short stories, called Phantom Prose Anthologies. Bishop's history of 2000 AD, in a series of articles under the banner name of Thrill Power Overload, is the most comprehensive currently available. A revised, expanded and updated book version was published in the summer of 2007 to coincide with the 30th anniversary of 2000 AD. After that sold out, a paperback edition was issued in February 2009. An expanded edition with new material by Karl Stock was released in 2017. In 2008, he appeared on 23 May edition of the BBC One quiz show The Weakest Link, beating eight other contestants to win more than £1500 in prize money. In 2010, Bishop received his first TV drama credit on the BBC medical drama series Doctors, writing an episode called A Pill For Every Ill, broadcast on 10 February.

Victoria Park lies approximately two miles south of Manchester city centre, between Rusholme and Longsight. History and description In 1836, a unique enterprise was undertaken by Richard Lane and Partners, architects. This was to establish a residential area to the east of Wilmslow Road, an \\"estate\\" of substantial houses in spacious grounds, where prosperous business and professional families could live. Lane was already noted for his public work in the neo- classical style, for example his town hall building at Chorlton on Medlock. The facade of this building remains on the Manchester Metropolitan University All Saints' Campus and formed part of the Mabel Tylecote Building. The early years of the 'Victoria Park Company' were of mixed fortune. The original plans to develop land in a slightly different area, did not reach complete fruition, largely due to the fraud which led to the Foss v. Harbottle case. A cul-de-sac of villas was built opposite Whitworth Park, and these were later demolished for the construction of the Royal Infirmary. The fraud, or rather a complex connected series of frauds, related to the original development along Moss Lane East. Drainage techniques of the time were insufficient to support the developers' ambitions, and the large tranche of land they owned was not built on until several decades later. Some of the original villas remain on the southern side of Moss Lane East, between Wilmslow Road and Monton Street. They are attractive and spacious buildings. The focus of the second, successful phase shifted to the better-quality land now known as Victoria Park. Professional people moved into the large houses, and from the earliest days a wide variety of nationalities was represented, notably a wealthy Prussian and Chinese merchant community. It had its own tollgates, walls and police. By 1850 about 50 houses by various architects had been built. Some villas and the sedate atmosphere of the area began to change at the beginning of the 20th century. After a long period of social disintegration, which began as early as 1920, the area has become more established and is now made up of a mixture of university residences, and rented and private accommodation. In March 1972, Manchester City Council designated a Conservation Area in Victoria Park. =Individual buildings= The area has over 20 listed buildings and among its many significant buildings is the notable Grade I listed First Church of Christ, Scientist (now the Edgar Wood Centre) in Daisy Bank Road, the work of the Middleton architect Edgar Wood. Also of significance are Summerville on Daisy Bank Road; Hirstwood by Edward Salomons; Alfred Waterhouse's Xaverian College; and St Chrysostom's Church, the Anglican parish church designed by George T Redmayne at the corner of Oxford Place and Anson Road. St Chrysostom's Church backs onto the University of Manchester's oldest hall of residence, Dalton-Ellis Hall. Redmayne was the architect of the original Dalton Hall. The Chinese Consulate-General is also located in a large mansion in Victoria Park, as is that of Pakistan. Victoria Park Campus of the university comprises several halls of residence. Among these are St Anselm Hall with Canterbury Court, Dalton-Ellis Hall, Hulme Hall (including Burkhardt House), St Gabriel's Hall and Opal Gardens Hall. St Anselm Hall is the only all-male hall left in the United Kingdom. =Church history= A church was included in the line drawings issued by Lane in 1836. The building was started in the 1840s but was abandoned because the Victoria Park Company went bankrupt. Victoria Park was from 1850 included in the parish of St James, Birch, until 1878, when the new parish of St John Chrysostom was created from parts of the parish of St James and other parishes.

It is notable as the home of the artist Stanley Spencer. It lies north-north-east of Maidenhead on the county border with Buckinghamshire, opposite the village of Bourne End. Cookham forms the southernmost and most rural part of the High Wycombe Urban Area. Cookham and its adjoining villages of Cookham Rise and Cookham Dean (locally known as \\"The Cookhams\\") had a combined population of 5,779 at the 2011 Census. In 2011 The Daily Telegraph deemed Cookham Britain's second richest village. Geography The parish includes three settlements: *Cookham Village – the centre of the original village, with a high street that has changed little over the centuries *Cookham Dean – the most rural village in the parish *Cookham Rise – the middle area that grew up round the railway station The ancient parish of Cookham covered all of Maidenhead north of the London and Bath Road until this was severed in 1894, including the hamlets of Furze Platt and Pinkneys Green. There were several manors: Cookham, Lullebrook, Elington, Pinkneys, Great Bradley, Bullocks, White Place and Cannon Court. The neighbouring communities are Maidenhead to the south, Bourne End to the north, Marlow and Bisham to the west and Taplow to the east. The River Thames flows past Cookham on its way between Marlow and Taplow. Several Thames islands belong to Cookham, such as Odney Island, Formosa Island and Sashes Island which separates Cookham Lock from Hedsor Water. The Lulle Brook and the White Brook are tributaries of the River Thames which flow through the parish. A good amount of common land remains in the parish, such as Widbrook Common, Cookham Dean Common and Cock Marsh. Winter Hill affords views over the Thames Valley and Chiltern Hills. Cookham has a site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) just to the north of the village, called Cock Marsh. History The area has been inhabited for thousands of years. There were several prehistoric burial mounds on Cock Marsh which were excavated in the 19th century and the largest stone axe ever found in Britain was one of 10,000 that has been dug up in nearby Furze Platt. The Roman road called the Camlet Way is reckoned to have crossed the Thames at Sashes Island, now cut by Cookham Lock, on its way from St. Albans to Silchester. By the 8th century there was an Anglo-Saxon abbey in Cookham and one of the later abbesses was Cynethryth, widow of King Offa of Mercia. It became the centre of a power struggle between Mercia and Wessex. Later King Alfred made Sashes Island one of his burhs to help defend against Viking invaders. There was a royal palace here where the Witan met in 997. It is recorded in the Domesday Book as Cocheham. The name may be from the Old English cōc + hām, meaning 'cook village', i.e. 'village noted for its cooks', although the first element may be derived from the Old English cōc(e) meaning 'hill'. Although the earliest stone church building may date from 750, the earliest identifiable part of the current Holy Trinity parish church is the Lady Chapel, which was built in the late 12th century on the site of the cell of a female anchorite who lived next to the church and was paid a halfpenny a day by Henry II. In the Middle Ages, most of Cookham was owned by Cirencester Abbey and the timber-framed 'Churchgate House' was apparently the Abbot's residence when in town. The \\"Tarry Stone\\" – still to be seen on the boundary wall of the Dower House – marked the extent of their lands. In 1611 the estate at Cookham was the subject of the first ever country house poem, Emilia Lanier's \\"Description of Cookham\\". In the poem Lanier pays tribute to her patroness, Margaret Clifford, Countess of Cumberland, through a description of her residence as a paradise for literary women. The estate at Cookham did not actually belong to Margaret Clifford, but was rented for her by her brother while Clifford was undergoing a dispute with her husband. The town people have resisted many attempts to enclose parts of the common land, including by the vicar, Rev. Thomas Whateley in 1799, Miss Isabella Fleming in 1869 (who wanted to stop nude bathing at Odney) and the Odney Estates in 1928 who wanted to enclose Odney Common. The Maidenhead and Cookham Commons Preservation Committee was formed and raised £2,738 to buy the manorial rights and the commons which were then donated to the National Trust by 1937. These included Widbrook, Cockmarsh, Winter Hill, Cookham Dean Commons, Pinkneys Green Common and Maidenhead Thicket. Economy Cookham is also home to the Chartered Institute of Marketing, based in Moor Hall. The John Lewis Partnership, a retailer, which runs John Lewis department stores and Waitrose supermarkets, has a subsidised hotel and conference centre based at Odney for Partners and their guests. The Partnership has four other subsidised hotels, at Ambleside (Lake District), Bala (north Wales), Brownsea Island (Poole Harbour) and Leckford (Hampshire). Local government Cookham's municipal services are provided by the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead and forms part of the Bisham and Cookham ward. As of May 2019 the village has 2 Borough Councillors, Cllr Mandy Brar (Lib Dem) and Cllr Gerry Clark (Conservative). Cookham also has a Parish Council with fifteen councillors in three wards, Cookham (2 Councillors), Cookham Rise (9 Councillors) and Cookham Dean (4 Councillors). As of May 2019 there are 5 Conservative, 9 Lib Dem and 1 Independent Councillors. The Council has a part-time Parish Clerk, an Assistant Clerk and a website, http://www.cookhamparishcouncil.org.uk/crbst_1.html The local health services are managed by the East Berkshire PCT (Primary Care Trust) – NHS Services. Transport Cookham railway station Cookham village is on the A4094 between Maidenhead and Bourne End. The A404 from Maidenhead to High Wycombe is just to the west of Cookham Dean. Cookham railway station, at Cookham Rise, is on the Marlow to Maidenhead branch line. There are two direct trains to and from London Paddington during the morning and evening rush hour. The rest of the trains require a change at Maidenhead. An hourly bus service to Maidenhead, Bourne End and High Wycombe is provided by Arriva Shires & Essex six days a week; The river has a long stretch of moorings above Cookham Bridge. Attractions The village is a tourist destination as it is a convenient base for a number of walks along the Thames Path and across National Trust property. There is a selection of restaurants and pubs in the High Street. The Stanley Spencer Gallery, based in the former Methodist chapel, also has a permanent exhibition of the artist's works. =Arts and literature= Stanley Spencer's birthplace and home in Cookham *Kenneth Grahame is said to have been inspired by the River Thames at Cookham to write The Wind in the Willows, as he lived at 'The Mount' in Cookham Dean as a child and returned to the village to write the book. Quarry Wood in Bisham, adjoining, is said to have been the original 'Wild Wood'. He later lived in Winkfield, Blewbury and Pangbourne. *The English painter Sir Stanley Spencer was born here and most of his works depict villagers and village life in Cookham. His religious paintings usually had Cookham as their backdrop and a number of the landmarks seen in his canvases can still be seen in the village. A number of his works can be seen at the small Stanley Spencer Gallery in the centre of the village, close to where he lived. He also painted frescoes in at least one of the private houses in Cookham; however, they are not open to public viewing. His ashes are buried in the churchyard in the village. *In Noël Coward's play Hay Fever, retired actress Judith Bliss and her family live in Cookham. *Cookham is mentioned in Harold Pinter's short play Victoria Station which premiered at the National Theatre with Paul Rogers and Martin Jarvis. =Historic figures= Water- colour Society's Exhibition, London, 1873. *Simon Alleyn, supposed Singing Vicar of Bray *Maidie Andrews (1893-1986), actress and singer, lived here for some years *Dr. William Battie (died 1776), editor of Isocrates and founder of the University Scholarship at Cambridge *Margaret Clifford, Countess of Cumberland, to whom tribute was paid in the 1611 country house poem \\"Description of Cookham\\" by Emilia Lanier. *Henry Dodwell (1641–1711), scholar and theologian *Benjamin Ferrers (1667-1732), deaf portraitist whose family held the local manor of Lullebrook (or Cookham) for about 70 years *Dorothy Hepworth (1894–1978), painter and the life partner of Patricia Preece *Kenneth Grahame (1859-1932), writer of Wind in the Willows, spent his childhood in Cookham and moved back after early retirement. *Nathaniel Hooke (died 1763), historian *Guglielmo Marconi, wireless pioneer, lived on Whyteladyes Lane, and is reputed to have conducted experimental transmissions from there in 1897 *Isaac Pocock (1782–1835), artist and dramatist buried in Cookham *Patricia Preece (1894–1966), artist associated with the Bloomsbury Group and the second wife of Stanley Spencer *Henry Thomas Ryall (1811–1867), engraver *Frank Sherwin, railway poster artist *Sir Stanley Spencer (1891-1959), artist, who throughout his life set many of his intense religious paintings in and around Cookham. *Ralph Thompson, animal artist and illustrator *Frederick Walker ARA *Rev.

Example The longest common substring of the strings \\"ABABC\\", \\"BABCA\\" and \\"ABCBA\\" is string \\"ABC\\" of length 3. Other common substrings are \\"A\\", \\"AB\\", \\"B\\", \\"BA\\", \\"BC\\" and \\"C\\". ABABC  BABCA  ABCBA Problem definition Given two strings, S of length m and T of length n, find the longest string which is substring of both S and T. A generalization is the k-common substring problem. Given the set of strings S = \\\\\\\\{S_1, ..., S_K\\\\\\\\}, where S_i=n_i and \\\\Sigma n_i = N. Find for each 2 \\\\leq k \\\\leq K, the longest strings which occur as substrings of at least k strings. Algorithms One can find the lengths and starting positions of the longest common substrings of S and T in \\\\Theta(n+m) time with the help of a generalized suffix tree. Finding them by dynamic programming costs \\\\Theta(nm). The solutions to the generalized problem take \\\\Theta(n_1 + ... + n_K) space and \\\\Theta(n_1·...·n_K) time with dynamic programming and take \\\\Theta(N * K) time with generalized suffix tree. =Suffix tree= Generalized suffix tree for the strings \\"ABAB\\", \\"BABA\\" and \\"ABBA\\", numbered 0, 1 and 2. The longest common substrings of a set of strings can be found by building a generalized suffix tree for the strings, and then finding the deepest internal nodes which have leaf nodes from all the strings in the subtree below it. The figure on the right is the suffix tree for the strings \\"ABAB\\", \\"BABA\\" and \\"ABBA\\", padded with unique string terminators, to become \\"ABAB$0\\", \\"BABA$1\\" and \\"ABBA$2\\". The nodes representing \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"AB\\" and \\"BA\\" all have descendant leaves from all of the strings, numbered 0, 1 and 2. Building the suffix tree takes \\\\Theta(N) time (if the size of the alphabet is constant). If the tree is traversed from the bottom up with a bit vector telling which strings are seen below each node, the k-common substring problem can be solved in \\\\Theta(NK) time. If the suffix tree is prepared for constant time lowest common ancestor retrieval, it can be solved in \\\\Theta(N) time. Pseudocode The following pseudocode finds the set of longest common substrings between two strings with dynamic programming: function LCSubstr(S[1..r], T[1..n]) L := array(1..r, 1..n) z := 0 ret := {} for i := 1..r for j := 1..n if S[i] = T[j] if i = 1 or j = 1 L[i, j] := 1 else L[i, j] := L[i − 1, j − 1] + 1 if L[i, j] > z z := L[i, j] ret := {S[i − z + 1..i]} else if L[i, j] = z ret := ret ∪ {S[i − z + 1..i]} else L[i, j] := 0 return ret This algorithm runs in O(n r) time. The variable \`z\` is used to hold the length of the longest common substring found so far. The set \`ret\` is used to hold the set of strings which are of length \`z\`. The set \`ret\` can be saved efficiently by just storing the index \`i\`, which is the last character of the longest common substring (of size z) instead of \`S[i-z+1..i]\`. Thus all the longest common substrings would be, for each i in \`ret\`, \`S[(ret[i]-z)..(ret[i])]\`. The following tricks can be used to reduce the memory usage of an implementation: * Keep only the last and current row of the DP table to save memory (O(\\\\min(r, n)) instead of O(n r)) * Store only non- zero values in the rows. This can be done using hash tables instead of arrays. This is useful for large alphabets.

Holmesburg was named for the descendants of Judge John Holme (1632–1704) who immigrated to Philadelphia in the 1680s and had no apparent relation to Surveyor General Thomas Holme. John Holme's descendants acquired land in Lower Dublin, north and south of Frankford Avenue and west of the Pennypack Creek. At the turn of the 19th century they began selling numerous small parcels of their holdings in what became a real estate boom. Also at this time, John Holme, the great grandson of the first John Holme, renamed his lumber yard the Holmesburg Lumber Yard. This renaming coupled with the multitude of Holme family real estate transactions identified this area as 'Holmesburg', the title surviving more than two hundred years later. It is bordered to the west by Brous Ave. to Ryan Ave. to Sandy Run/Pennypack Creek to Holme Ave. to Holme Circle to Ashton Rd. to Willits Rd, the Delaware River to the east, and Sheffield Street to the south. The border shared with Torresdale to the north is Welsh/Willits/Academy Road and then over to Linden Ave. Holmesburg's zip code is 19136. History The area around Holmesburg was first inhabited by the Lenape. In 1683 William Penn purchased from the Indians the land between the Pennypack and Neshaminy Creeks. In November 1682, Thomas Holme received a grant from Penn of 1,646 acres on either side of Pennypack Creek to establish Wellspring Plantation. In 1790, his decedents divided the land, and this 26-acre section became known as the Village of Holmesburg.\\"Holmesburg\\", Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia Penn had the King's Highway Bridge erected over the Pennypack Creek in 1697 to connect his mansion with the new city of Philadelphia. Downstream from the bridge Peter Dale and John Holme built a grist mill. A dam was constructed upstream at \\"Rocky Falls\\"; water to turn the mill-wheels was brought from the dam through a long mill-race. Welsh farmers from Gwynedd built a road to bring their grain to the mill. At the end of Welsh Road is Mill Street, which leads to where the mills once stood. When Robert Lewis came into ownership, he added a cooperage for the production of barrels and hogsheads, and this required construction of a sawmill, and probably a cider mill. A bit upstream from the sawmill, David Lewis built a textile mill which was burned during the War of 1812, but subsequently rebuilt.Eleanor P., \\"Historical Northeast Philadelphia\\", Friends of the Holmesburg Branch Free Library, 1994 The mills contributed to the growth of Holmesburg. Frankford Avenue bridge over the Pennypack Creek The first stagecoach service was established in 1756 between Philadelphia and New York. As the trip took three days, this required rest stops. A a blacksmith shop and an inn were established where Welsh Road met the Kings Highway. The Green Tree opened in 1799. U.S. Route 13 between Philadelphia and Morrisville was known as the Frankford and Bristol Turnpike. Ferries had operated near the mouth of the Pennypack from early time. Ferry Lane, (now Pennypack Street) was built to access the Frankford-Bristol Road. In 1803 Holmesburg got its own toll-house and toll-gate, to cover maintenance. In 1834 the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad opened. By 1862 a was established at Delaware Avenue (now Rhawn Street). In 1863, the Frankford and Holmesburg Railroad was incorporated to build a line from Frankford to Holmesburg. State Road was opened in 1870. In 1895, the Holmesburg, Tacony and Frankford Company established trolley service; and the road was renamed Frankford Avenue. Holmesburg native George A. Castor became a successful merchant tailor with large establishments in New York City, Boston, and Philadelphia. He built the eighteen bedroom mansion \\"Stoneyhurst\\" on Solly Avenue overlooking the Pennypack Creek. As of 2018, the site was occupied by the motherhouse of the sisters of the Missionary Servants of the Most Blessed Trinity, a Roman Catholic women's congregation, that relocated there in 1931.Baldwin, Lou. \\"Phila.-based Trinitarian sisters continue work for poor, immigrants\\", Catholic Philly, September 20, 2018 The congregation was founded by Vincentian Father Timothy A. Judge, for whom Father Judge High School is named. Shakespearean actor Edwin Forrest purchased 100 acres of land along Frankford Avenue for a country estate. After his death in 1872, his executors turned it into the Forrest Home for retired actors. It operated from about 1876 to 1927. By 1905 lands along the Pennypack had been acquired for parkland. =Act of Consolidation= Around 1701, Lower Dublin Township was established. In 1853, about half the area of the township was separated out into Delaware Township, which comprised Torresdale and Holmesburg. It was superseded the following year by the 1854 Act of Consolidation, 1854 and incorporated into Philadelphia. Thomas Holme Library Thomas Holme Branch Library Completed in 1906, the Thomas Holme Library is the smallest of the Philadelphia branch libraries. It was built through an endowment from industrialist Andrew Carnegie. The funds for construction were contingent on the municipality providing the land. The lot was donated by the local Lower Dublin Academy through an endowment established by the Holme family for educational purposes. While originally providing for a school, a library was considered by the trustees and the community to be a significant educational contribution, a concept shared by the Carnegie Corporation. The Thomas Holme Branch was designed by architect Horace W. Castor, of the firm of Sterns & Castor, in the Beaux Arts style.\\"Free Library of Philadelphia, Thomas Holme Branch, 7810 Frankford Avenue, Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, PA\\", Historic American Buildings Survey, Library of Congress The Free Library of Philadelphia operates the Holmesburg Branch.\\"Holmesburg Branch.\\" Free Library of Philadelphia.

Holmesburg contains one of the longest continuous African-American communities in the nation, having been founded by runaway slaves prior to and during the Civil War. Holmesburg is the location of the historic Pennypack Theatre building, built in 1929 in the Art Deco style with a 1,364-seat capacity and designed by acclaimed 20th century theater architect William Harold Lee. The Frankford Avenue Bridge and Joseph H. Brown School were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Recreation and transportation Recreational facilities include Holmesburg Recreation Center at Rhawn and Ditman Streets, James Ramp Memorial Playground, Pennypack Park and Pennypack on the Delaware. Transportation to Center City Philadelphia is provided by SEPTA's Trenton Line commuter train, which affords a quick 25-minute ride into the urban center. Interstate 95 is also an easy 10-15 minute drive into downtown, accessible either by the Cottman Avenue (PA-73) entrance to the south or Academy Road entrance to the north. Holmesburg's main thoroughfare, Frankford Avenue (U.S. Route 13), is a historic byway in use for centuries. Frankford Avenue was used as a route from Philadelphia to points north as far back as the 17th century. The Frankford Avenue Bridge across Pennypack Creek, built in 1697, is the oldest stone arch bridge in continuous use in the country.

She is a South Korean citizen, and has represented Thailand in junior team competition, but she has spent much of her life in the United States. Early life and amateur career Song was a child prodigy, setting a number of \\"youngest\\" age records. She won the 1999 U.S. Girls' Junior Championship (held at Green Spring Valley Hunt Club in Owings Mills, Maryland) at thirteen years old, becoming the youngest player to win any United States Golf Association championship. In 2000, she tied for 10th place in the Kraft Nabisco Championship, at the age of thirteen. The same year, a few months after her fourteenth birthday, she became the youngest ever semi-finalist at the U.S. Women's Amateur. In 2001, she was the recipient of the Nancy Lopez Award, which is presented to the best female amateur golfer of the year. The next year she placed first individually at the World Amateur Team Championships (Espirito Santo Trophy) and helped Thailand to a second- place finish. She won a number of adult amateur events in 2002 and 2003 and in the latter year she placed fifth at the U.S. Women's Open. Professional career Song turned professional in August 2003 at the age of 17 and 3 months. She was granted an exemption from the LPGA's minimum age rule to allow her to enter the 2003 LPGA Final Qualifying Tournament where she finished fifth to earn membership on the LPGA Tour for 2004. In her rookie season, she finished second at the Kraft Nabisco Championship and ended the year 28th on the money list. Song eagled the 72nd hole at the Kraft Nabisco to tie for the lead but lost by one shot when Grace Park birdied the final hole. In 2007, Song suffered a lack of energy and continued to struggle, dropping to 88th place on the official LPGA money list. She sat out all of 2008 due to health problems including severe irritable bowel syndrome and adrenal insufficiency. Song returned to the LPGA Tour in 2009 and was on the leaderboard at the LPGA Championship in June before a final-round 78 pushed her back in the pack.

Freshwater prawn farming shares many characteristics with, and many of the same problems as, marine shrimp farming. Unique problems are introduced by the developmental life cycle of the main species (the giant river prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii).New, M. B.: Farming Freshwater Prawns; FAO Fisheries Technical Paper 428, 2002. ISSN 0429-9345. The global annual production of freshwater prawns (excluding crayfish and crabs) in 2003 was about 280,000 tons, of which China produced some 180,000 tons, followed by India and Thailand with some 35,000 tons each. Additionally, China produced about 370,000 tons of Chinese river crab (Eriocheir sinensis).Data extracted from the FAO Fisheries Global Aquaculture Production Database for freshwater crustaceans. The most recent data sets are for 2003 and sometimes contain estimates. Accessed June 28, 2005.  Species  All farmed freshwater prawns today belong to the genus Macrobrachium. Until 2000, the only species farmed was the giant river prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii, also known as the Malaysian prawn). Since then, China has begun farming the Oriental river prawn (M. nipponense) in large quantities, and India farms a small amount of monsoon river prawn (M. malcolmsonii). In 2003, these three species accounted for all farmed freshwater prawns, about two-thirds M. rosenbergii and one-third M. nipponense. About 200 species in the genus Macrobrachium live in the tropical and subtropical climates on all continents except Europe and Antarctica.  Biology of Macrobrachium rosenbergii  Giant river prawns live in turbid freshwater, but their larval stages require brackish water to survive. Males can reach a body size of 32 cm; females grow to 25 cm. In mating, the male deposits spermatophores on the underside of the female's thorax, between the walking legs. The female then extrudes eggs, which pass through the spermatophores. The female carries the fertilized eggs with her until they hatch; the time may vary, but is generally less than three weeks. A large female may lay up to 100,000 eggs. From these eggs hatch zoeae, the first larval stage of crustaceans. They go through several larval stages before metamorphosing into postlarvae, at which stage they are about 8 mm long and have all the characteristics of adults. This metamorphosis usually takes place about 32 to 35 days after hatching. These postlarvae then migrate back into freshwater. There are three different morphotypes of males. The first stage is called \\"small male\\" (SM); this smallest stage has short, nearly translucent claws. If conditions allow, small males grow and metamorphose into \\"orange claw\\" (OC) males, which have large orange claws on their second chelipeds, which may have a length of 0.8 to 1.4 times their body size. OC males later may transform into the third and final stage, the \\"blue claw\\" (BC) males. These have blue claws, and their second chelipeds may become twice as long as their body.Wynne, F.: Grow-out Culture of Freshwater Prawns in Kentucky, 2000. Last accessed July 4, 2005. Male M. rosenbergii prawns have a strict hierarchy: the territorial BC males dominate the OCs, which in turn dominate the SMs. The presence of BC males inhibits the growth of SMs and delays the metamorphosis of OCs into BCs; an OC will keep growing until it is larger than the largest BC male in its neighbourhood before transforming. All three male stages are sexually active, though, and females which have undergone their premating molt will cooperate with any male to reproduce. BC males protect the females until their shells have hardened; OCs and SMs show no such behavior.  Technology  Freshwater prawn farm in Bangladesh. Giant river prawns have been farmed using traditional methods in Southeast Asia for a long time. First experiments with artificial breeding cultures of M. rosenbergii were done in the early 1960s in Malaysia, where it was discovered that the larvae needed brackish water for survival. Industrial-scale rearing processes were perfected in the early 1970s in Hawaii, and spread first to Taiwan and Thailand, and then to other countries. The technologies used in freshwater prawn farming are basically the same as in marine shrimp farming. Hatcheries produce postlarvae, which then are grown and acclimated in nurseries before being transferred into growout ponds, where the prawns are then fed and grown until they reach marketable size. Harvesting is done by either draining the pond and collecting the animals (\\"batch\\" harvesting) or by fishing the prawns out of the pond using nets (continuous operation). Due to the aggressive nature of M. rosenbergii and the hierarchy between males, stocking densities are much lower than in penaeid shrimp farms. Intensive farming is not possible due to the increased level of cannibalism, so all farms are either stocked semi-intensively (4 to 20 postlarvae per square metre) or, in extensive farms, at even lower densities (1 to 4/m²). The management of the growout ponds must take into account the growth characteristics of M. rosenbergii: the presence of blue-claw males inhibits the growth of small males, and delays the metamorphosis of OC males into BCs. Some farms fish off the largest prawns from the pond using seines to ensure a healthy composition of the pond's population, designed to optimize the yield, even if they employ batch harvesting. The heterogeneous individual growth of M. rosenbergii makes growth control necessary even if a pond is stocked newly, starting from scratch: some animals will grow faster than others and become dominant BCs, stunting the growth of other individuals. The FAO considers the ecological impact of freshwater prawn farming to be less severe than in shrimp farming. The prawns are cultured at much lower densities, meaning less concentrated waste products and a lesser danger of the ponds becoming breeding places for diseases. The growout ponds do not salinate agricultural land, as do those of inland marine shrimp farms. However, the lower yield per area means that the income per Ha is also lower and a given area can support fewer humans. This limits the culture area to low value lands where intensification is not required. Freshwater prawn farms do not endanger mangroves, and are better amenable to small-scale businesses run by a family.FAO: Cultured Species Fact Sheet M. rosenbergii; accessed June 30, 2005.

However, like marine farmed shrimp, M. rosenbergii is also susceptible to a variety of viral or bacterial diseases,Tonguthai, K.: Diseases of the Freshwater Prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii , AAHRI Newsletter 4(2), Aquatic Animal Health Research Institute, Bangkok University; December 1997. including white tail disease,Sahul Hameed, A.

Economics  The global annual production of freshwater prawns in 2003 was about 280,000 tonnes, of which China produced some 180,000 tonnes, followed by India and Thailand with some 35,000 tonnes each. Other major producer countries are Taiwan, Bangladesh, and Vietnam. In the United States, only a few hundred small farms for M. rosenbergii produced about 50 tonnes in 2003.This made been more demand for the foreign culture but not for Indian.It was a big export trade in India from major producer countries.

It was first described in Ecuador during the summer of 1992. In March 1993, it returned as a major epidemic and was the object of extensive media coverage. Retrospective studies have suggested a case of Taura syndrome might have occurred on a shrimp farm in Colombia as early as 1990 and the virus was already present in Ecuador in mid-1991. Between 1992 and 1997, the disease spread to all major regions of the Americas where whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) is cultured. The economic impact of TS in the Americas during that period might have exceeded US$2 billion by some estimates. Overview Healthy Litopenaeus vannamei (above); L. vannamei infected with Taura syndrome virus (below) The 1992 Ecuadorian TS epidemic occurred concurrently with an outbreak of black leaf wilt disease in banana plantations. The outbreak of black leaf disease led to an increase in fungicide usage within the Taura River basin district near the city of Guayaquil. The fungicides propiconazole (Tilt, Ciba-Geigy) and tridemorph (Calixin, BASF) used to control black leaf, ran off into nearby ponds and were initially thought to be responsible for the disease. Analytical data demonstrated propiconazole in water, sediments and hepatopancreas tissues of shrimp harvested from affected farms in Ecuador. No other pesticides were discovered. In January 1994, at the request of Ciba-Geigy, a workshop on Taura syndrome was held at the Aquaculture Pathology Laboratory of the University of Arizona. Experts from several countries with expertise in shrimp and insect pathology, shrimp nutrition, toxicology, mycology, water quality and farm management participated in the workshop. Industry representatives also participated. The group developed recommendations as to the standardization of the research on TS and suggested that studies be done to evaluate whether fungicides or as-yet unrecognized agents were responsible for the syndrome. Dr. Jim Brock, the aquatic disease specialist for the State of Hawaii during this period, first demonstrated the disease could be transmitted by feeding Taura victims to healthy shrimp in early 1994. The dying test shrimp were then fed to a new set of shrimp, which was dying at the same rate. Rivers' postulates were fulfilled in 1994 by Dr. Ken Hasson and co-researchers at the University of Arizona. This proved the viral etiology of the syndrome. The virus was named Taura syndrome virus, often referred to as TSV. The virus is referred to by the name infectious cuticular epithelial necrosis virus (ICENV) by some authors in Latin America. Taura syndrome is a notifiable disease by the Office international des Épizooties (OIE), which reflects the serious nature and devastating impact of the disease. Identification and description of the virus Taura syndrome virus was first classified as a possible member of the family Picornaviridae based on biological and physical characteristics. It was later reclassified in the Dicistroviridae family, genus Cripavirus. It has since been reassigned to a second genus in the same family - the Aparavirus. TSV is a 32 nm nonenveloped particle with an icosahedral morphology and a buoyant density of 1.338g/ml. The genome is single-stranded positive-sense and has 10,205 nucleotides (excluding the 3' poly-A tail). The capsid consists of three major proteins: CP1 (40 kDa), CP2 (55 kDa) and CP3 (24 kDa) alongside a minor protein of 58 kDa. Audelo-del-Valle in 2003 reported certain primate cell lines could be used to culture TSV. Later studies demonstrated their report was based on misinterpreted data. TSV does not appear to be a potential zoonosis. All virus amplifications require the use of live shrimp, as there is no continuous cell line that supports the growth of shrimp viruses. Variants of the virus RNA viruses such as TSV have high rates of spontaneous mutation. These very high rates might be due to the lack of proofreading function of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and have resulted in the emergence of several genetic variants of the virus. As of May 2009, four genetic clusters are recognized: Belize (TSV-BZ), America (TSV-HI), Southeast Asia and Venezuela. The Belize strain is considered the most virulent. Point mutations in TSV capsid proteins might provide specific isolates with selective advantages such as host adaptability, increased virulence or increased replication ability. Even small variations in the TSV genome can result in substantial differences in virulence. All TSV variants are similar in shape and size, with light variations. The average size of TSV- BZ virus particles is 32.693+/- 1.834 nm compared to TSV-HI with a size of 31.485 +/- 1.187 nm. The region of highest genetic difference is within the capsid protein CP2, with pairwise comparison of nucleotide showing a 0 to 3.5% difference amongst isolates. The most variations in CP2 occur at the 3'-terminal sequence; this may be because it is less constrained by structural requirements and more exposed than other regions of the protein. Geographic distribution TSV has been reported from virtually all shrimp-growing regions of the Americas, including Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Costa Rica, and Venezuela, as well as from the states of Hawaii, Texas, Florida and South Carolina. Until 1998, it was considered to be a Western Hemisphere virus. The first Asian outbreak occurred in Taiwan. It has more recently been identified in Thailand, Myanmar, China, Korea, and Indonesia, where it has been associated with severe epizootics in farmed Penaeus vannamei and Penaeus monodon. The wide distribution of the disease has been attributed to the movement of infected host stocks for aquaculture purposes. This might have been helped by the highly stable nature of the virus. Importation of TSV- infected P. vannamei from the Western Hemisphere is thought to have been the origin of the outbreak in Taiwan. This was further suggested by the genomic similarity of the Taiwan and Western Hemisphere isolates. TSV appeared in Thailand in 2003. Due to the similarities in deduced CP2 amino acids sequence and the chronology of the disease outbreaks in relation to imported stocks, at least some of the Thai isolates likely originated from Chinese stocks. Taura syndrome can spread rapidly when introduced in new areas. A shrimp farmer described the 1995 outbreak in Texas as, \\"This thing spread like a forest fire... There was no stopping it. I just sat there and watched it and in a matter of three days, my shrimp were gone. Dead!\\" (reported in Rosenberry: Shrimp news international in 1995). Species of susceptible shrimp TSV is known to affect many shrimp species. It causes serious diseases in the postlarval, juvenile and adult stages of Penaeus vannamei. It also affects severely P. setiferus, P. stylirostris, P. schmitti, and Metapenaeus ensis. P. chinensis is highly susceptible to the disease in experimental bioassays. Variation occurs within species, and TSV-resistant strains of shrimp have been developed. Wild stocks are showing increased resistance, perhaps through intense natural selection. Reports of TS in the wild are limited, but in February 1995, the Mexican Fisheries Ministry reported the presence of TSV in wild-type shrimp captured on the border of Mexico and Guatemala. As of 2007, no confirmed reports indicated TSV is infectious to other groups of decapod or nondecapod crustaceans. Pathology and disease cycle In farm situations, TS often causes high mortality during the first 15 to 40 days of stocking into shrimp ponds. The course of infection may be acute (5–20 days) to chronic (more than 120 days) at the pond and farm level. The disease has three distinct phases that sometimes overlap: acute, transition and chronic. The disease cycle has been characterized in detail in P. vannamei. After the initial infection, the acute phase develops. Clinical signs can occur as early as 7 hours after infection in some individuals and last for about 4–7 days. Infected shrimp display anorexia, lethargy and erratic swimming behavior. They also present opacification of the tail musculature, soft cuticle and, in naturally occurring infection, a red tail due to the expansion of the red chromatophores. Mortality during this phase can be as high as 95%. The acute phase is characterized histologically by multifocal areas of nuclear pyknosis/karyorrhexis and numerous cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in the cuticular epithelium and the subcutis of the general body surface, all appendages, gills, hindgut, esophagus and stomach. The pyknosis and karyorrhexis give a “buckshot” appearance to the tissue and are considered pathognomonic for the disease. In severe infections the antennal gland tubule epithelium, the hematopoietic tissues and the testis are also affected. This occurs mainly in severe infection following injection of viral particles and has not been reported from naturally infected P. vannamei. Shrimp that survive the acute stage enter a transitional stage. Shrimp in the transitional phase show randomly distributed, melanized (brownish/black) lesions within of the cuticle of the cephalothorax and tail region. These foci are the sites of acute lesions which have progressed onto subsequent stages of hemocytic inflammation,hemocytic – Biology Online cuticular epithelium regeneration and healing and which might be secondarily infected with bacteria. These foci are negative for TSV by in situ hybridization (ISH) using a TSV-specific cDNA probe. Histologically, these shrimp present focal active acute lesions and the onset of lymphoid organ spheroids (LOSs) development. By ISH with TSV-specific probes, a diffuse positive signal can be observed within the walls of the lymphoid organ of normal appearance with or without focal probe signals within developing LOSs. These shrimp will be lethargic and anorexic, possibly because of the redirection of their energy and metabolic resources toward wound repair and recovery. If the shrimp undergo another successful moult following the transitional phase, they will cast off the melanized lesions and enter the chronic phase. The chronic phase is first seen six days after infection and persist for at least 12 months under experimental conditions. This phase is characterized histologically by the absence of acute lesions and the presence of LOS of successive morphologies. These LOSs are positive by ISH for TSV. A low prevalence of ectopic spheroids can also be observed in some cases. LOSs are not by themselves characteristic of TSV infection and can be found in other viral diseases of shrimp such as lymphoid organ vacuolization virus (LOVV), lymphoid parvo-like virus (LPV), lymphoid organ virus (LOV), rhabdovirus of penaeid shrimp (RPS) and yellowhead virus (YHV). Diagnosis of the disease during the chronic phase is problematic, as shrimp do not display any outward signs of the disease and do not show mortality from the infection. Survivors may become carriers for life. Shrimp with chronic TSV infection are not as vigorous as uninfected shrimp, as demonstrated by their inability to tolerate a salinity drop as well as uninfected shrimp. A 2011 study by Laxminath Tumburu looked at the relationship between an environmental stressor (pesticide Endosulfan) and Taura syndrome virus (TSV) and their interactions on the susceptibility and molting of marine penaeid shrimp L. vannamei and found the interference of endosulfan-associated stress led to increasingly higher susceptibility at postmolt stage during the acute phase of the TSV disease cycle. Routes of transmission The most likely route for transmission of TSV is cannibalism of dead infected shrimp. The virus can be spread from one farm to another by seagulls and aquatic insects. Infectious TSV has been found in the feces of laughing gulls that fed on infected shrimp during an epizootic in Texas. Controlled laboratory studies have documented that TSV remains infectious for up to one day after passage through the gut of white leghorns chicken (Gallus domesticus) and laughing gulls. Although, vertical transmission is suspected this has not been experimentally confirmed. Shrimp surviving a TSV infection are lifelong carriers of the virus and are a significant source of virus for susceptible animals. It has been hypothesized that TSV was introduced to Southeast Asia with chronically infected shrimp imported from the Western Hemisphere. The ability of TSV to remain at least partly infectious after one or several freeze-thaw cycles might be a contributing factor facilitating its spread in the international commerce of frozen commodity products. Mechanisms by which infected frozen shrimp could spread the virus include: reprocessing of shrimp at processing plants with release of infectious liquid wastes, disposal of solid wastes in landfills where seagulls could acquire the virus and then spread it, the use of shrimp as bait by sport fishermen and the use of imported shrimp as fresh food for other aquatic species. Diagnostic methods A presumptive diagnosis of acute TSV infection can be established by the presence of dead or dying shrimp in cast nets used for routine evaluation. Predatory birds are attracted to diseased ponds and feed heavily on the dying shrimp. The unique signs of infection caused by TS, such as the cuticular melanized spots, can provide a strong presumptive diagnosis, but care must be taken as these can be confused with other diseases, such as bacterial shell disease. In general pathognomonic histopathological lesions are the first step in confirmatory diagnosis. Discrete foci of pyknotic and karyorhectic nuclei and inflammation are seen within the cuticular tissues. The lymphoid organ might display spheroids, but is otherwise unremarkable. The genome of the virus has been cloned and cDNA probes are available for diagnosis. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods have been developed for detection of TSV and are very sensitive. Real-time techniques allow for quantification of the virus. The IQ2000TM TSV detection system, a RT-PCR method, is said to have a detection limit of 10 copies per reaction. RNA-based methods are limited by the relative fragility of the viral RNA. Prolonged fixation in Davidsons' fixative might result in RNA degradation due to fixative-induced acid hydrolysis. An alternative for virus detection is the use of specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against the relatively stable proteins in the viral capsid. Rapid diagnostic tests using MAbs are now in common use for white spot syndrome virus and are being marketed under the commercial name of Shrimple. Similar tests for TSV, yellowhead virus and infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus are currently under development. Methods of control Management strategies for the disease have included raising more resistant species such as the Western blue shrimp (Penaeus stylirostris) and stocking of specific pathogen free (SPF) or specific pathogen resistant (SPR) shrimp. Relatively simple laboratory challenges can be used to predict the performance of selected stocks in farms where TSV is enzootic. The resistant shrimp lines currently raised have reached nearly complete resistance to some TSV variants and further improvement due to breeding for TSV-resistance is expected be minor for these variants. Significant improvements in TSV survival were made through selective breeding despite low to moderate heritability for this trait. A management strategy used to reduce the impact of TS has been the practice of stocking postlarval shrimp at increased stocking density. Following this strategy, farms would experience mortality due to TS at an early stage of the production cycle, before substantial feeding had begun and the surviving shrimp would be resistant to further TSV challenges. Other techniques used with limited efficacy have been the polyculture of shrimp with tilapia and maintenance of near-optimal water quality conditions in the grow- out ponds with reduction of organic loading. Transgenic shrimp expressing an antisense TSV coat protein (TSV-CP) exhibited increased survival in TSV challenges. The public perception of transgenic animals, as well as current technical limitations, limit the use of transgenic animals as a mean of disease control.

It appears to have been popular in Norfolk and other parts of East Anglia. Of all the traditional forms of football played in Europe, it appears to have been one of the toughest and most dangerous. This probably explains why it died out during the early 19th century. The first-ever English-Latin dictionary, Promptorium parvulorum (c. 1440), offers the following definition of camp ball: \\"Campan, or playar at foott balle, pediluson; campyon, or champion\\" The game was originally played in the middle of town, where the objective was to take the ball to the opposing side of town. It was later played in the country, often in a special field set aside for the purpose known as a camping-place, camping close or camping pightle. A reminder of this old game can be found in Swaffham where, behind the market place lies the Camping land where the game was played. The custom in medieval times was to play games after church services, and often camping fields were sited near the church. Although this game was rough, it was not without rules. In fact there is evidence from Moore (1823) that there were teams, goals, rules and even ball passing between team members (a development often attributed to much later): If the game described by Moore in 1823 was substantially the same as medieval camping, then it is noteworthy that despite the Promptorium's definition of it as a form of \\"foott balle,\\" the game apparently involved no kicking and was rather reminiscent of the passing game in rugby. Matches were often between rival parishes and stirred local passions. According to the historian Moore, writing in 1823, \\"amid shouting and roaring of the population the players were not disposed to treat one another gently.\\" Some games even turned so nasty that there was serious injury and loss of life. It was recorded that a match at Diss Common in the early nineteenth century was so brutal that nine men were killed or died of their injuries. While some people thought that camping was a combination of all athletic excellence others saw it as little more than a stand up fight. The contest for the ball 'never ends without black eyes and bloody noses, broken heads or shins, and some serious mischief,' a writer said in 1830 when camping popularity was at its height. A modified game called \\"civil play\\" banned boxing as a component of the game. The game was played by passing the ball from hand to hand. To score, a player had to carry the ball through his own goal. Matches were usually for the best of seven or nine goals or snotches which normally took two or three hours, but a game of fourteen hours had been recorded in a county match. A feature of so- called friendly matches were prizes for those who played well. These consisted of money, hats, gloves or shoes. Incidents of violence seem in the end to have turned public opinion against camping and it was gradually replaced by a gentler kicking game. This game had roused great scorn amongst camping enthusiasts when it first began to make its influence felt in the 1830s.

The term most commonly applies to a three-grid amplifying vacuum tube (thermionic valve), which was invented by Gilles Holst and Bernhard D.H. Tellegen in 1926.G. Holst and B.D.H. Tellegen, \\"Means for amplifying electrical oscillations\\", US Patent 1945040, January 1934. The pentode consists of an evacuated glass envelope containing five electrodes in this order: a cathode heated by a filament, a control grid, a screen grid, a suppressor grid, and a plate (anode). The pentode (called a \\"triple-grid amplifier\\" in some early literature\\"RCA Receiving Tube Manual, 1940\\"; p118) was developed from the tetrode tube by the addition of a third grid, the suppressor grid. This served to prevent secondary emission electrons emitted by the plate from reaching the screen grid, which caused instability and parasitic oscillations in the tetrode. The pentode is closely related to the beam tetrode. Pentodes were widely used in industrial and consumer electronic equipment such as radios and televisions until the 1960s, when they were replaced by transistors. Their main use now is in high power industrial applications such as radio transmitters. The obsolete consumer tubes are still used in a few legacy and specialty vacuum tube audio devices.  Types of pentodes  * Variable transconductance (\\"variable-mu\\", \\"remote-cutoff\\" or \\"super-control\\") tubes in general are those with a non-uniform grid wire spacing to allow them to handle a wide range of input signal levels without excessive cross-modulation distortion, and so useful in radio frequency stages where automatic gain control is applied to the pentode. The first commercial variable-mu tubes were the 550 and 551 developed by Stuart and Snow around 1929.Stuart, B & Snow, H. A. (1930). Reduction of Distortion and Cross-Talk in Radio Receivers by Mean of Variable-Mu Tetrodes. Proc IRE, Vol 18, Issue 12, pp2102 - 2127 Other examples include: EF50, 1T4, 6K7, 6BA6, and the EF83 (while perhaps the EF85/6BY7, and certainly the 6JH6, could be described as \\"semiremote-cutoff\\" pentodes). * Sharp-cutoff (\\"high slope\\" or ordinary) pentodes have the more ordinary uniform spacing of grid wires, and so mutual conductance decreases in an essentially uniform manner with increasing negative bias, and has a more abrupt cutoff. These pentodes are more suitable for audio amplifiers. Examples include: EF37A, EF86/6267, 1N5GT, 6AU6A, 6J7GT. Often, but not always, in the European valve naming scheme for pentodes an even number indicated a sharp-cutoff device while odd indicated remote-cutoff; the EF37 was an exception to this general trend, perhaps due to its history as an update to the EF36 (\\"The Mullard EF36, EF37 and EF37A\\" at the National Valve Museum). * Power output pentodes, The EL34, EL84, 6CL6, 6F6, 6G6, SY4307A and 6K6GT are some examples of true pentodes used for power amplification, using a suppressor grid rather than the higher efficiency beam- forming plates used in beam tetrodes. (Beam tetrodes were also sometimes referred to as \\"beam pentodes\\",\\"Sylvania Receiving Tubes Technical Manual, 14th Edition\\" p 143 and include the Sylvania (and possibly GE) 6CA7 version of EL34, 6V6GT and the GEC KT66 and KT88. Other sources preferred names such as \\"beam power amplifier\\" or \\"beam power tube\\", possibly due to caution regarding the Philips pentode patent). Power output pentodes for specific television requirements, efficient for their job but possibly not linear enough for audio, were named: ** video output pentodes, e.g. 15A6/PL83, PL802 ** frame output or vertical deflection pentodes, such as the PL84 and the pentode sections of the 18GV8/PCL85. ** line output or horizontal deflection pentodes, such as the PL36, 27GB5/PL500, PL505 etc. * A \\"triode-pentode\\" is a single envelope containing both a triode and a pentode, such as an ECF80 or ECL86.  Advantages over the tetrode  The simple tetrode or screen-grid tube offered a larger amplification factor, more power and a higher frequency capability than the earlier triode. However, in the tetrode secondary electrons knocked out of the anode (plate) by the electrons from the cathode striking it (a process called secondary emission) can flow to the screen grid due to its relatively high potential. This current of electrons leaving the anode reduces the net anode current Ia. As the anode voltage Va is increased, the electrons from the cathode hit the anode with more energy, knocking out more secondary electrons, increasing this current of electrons leaving the anode. The result is that in the tetrode the anode current Ia is found to decrease with increasing anode voltage Va, over part of the characteristic curve. This property (ΔVa/ΔIa < 0) is called negative resistance. It can cause the tetrode to become unstable, leading to parasitic oscillations in the output, called dynatron oscillations in some circumstances. The pentode, as introduced by Tellegen, has an additional electrode, or third grid, called the suppressor grid, located between the screen grid and the anode, which solves the problem of secondary emission. The suppressor grid is given a low potential—it is usually either grounded or connected to the cathode. Secondary emission electrons from the anode are repelled by the negative potential on the suppressor grid, so they can't reach the screen grid but return to the anode. The primary electrons from the cathode have a higher kinetic energy, so they can still pass through the suppressor grid and reach the anode. Pentodes, therefore, can have higher current outputs and a wider output voltage swing; the anode/plate can even be at a lower voltage than the screen grid yet still amplify well.\\"RCA Receiving Tube Manual, 1940\\"; p8.  Comparisons with the triode  * Pentodes (and tetrodes) tend to have a much lower feedback capacitance, due to the screening effect of the second grid. * Pentodes tend to have higher noise (partition noise) because of the random splitting of the cathode current between the screen grid and the anode, * Triodes have a lower internal anode resistance, and hence higher damping factor when used in audio output circuits, compared with pentodes, when negative feedback is absent. That also reduces the potential voltage amplification obtainable from a triode compared with a pentode of the same transconductance, and usually means a more efficient output stage can be made using pentodes, with a lower power drive signal. * Pentodes are almost unaffected by changes in supply voltage, and can thus operate with more poorly stabilized supplies than triodes. * Pentodes and triodes (and tetrodes) do have essentially similar relationships between grid (one) input voltage and anode output current when the anode voltage is held constant, i.e. close to a square-law relationship.  Usage  A General Electric 12AE10 double pentode Pentode tubes were first used in consumer-type radio receivers. A well-known pentode type, the EF50, was designed before the start of World War II, and was extensively used in radar sets and other military electronic equipment. The pentode contributed to the electronic preponderance of the Allies. The Colossus computer and the Manchester Baby used large numbers of EF36 pentode tubes. Tony Sale. \\"The Colossus Rebuild Project\\" Tony Sale. \\"The Colossus: its purpose and operation\\". Michael Saunby. \\"Small signal audio pentodes\\" . B. Jack Copeland. \\"Colossus: The secrets of Bletchley Park's code-breaking computers\\". Later on, the 7AK7 tube was expressly developed for use in computer equipment. Sylvania. Engineering Data Service. 7AK7. July 1953. After World War II, pentodes were widely used in TV receivers, particularly the successor to the EF50, the EF80. Vacuum tubes were replaced by transistors during the 1960s. However, they continue to be used in certain applications, including high-power radio transmitters and (because of their well-known valve sound) in high-end and professional audio applications, microphone preamplifiers and electric guitar amplifiers. Large stockpiles in countries of the former Soviet Union have provided a continuing supply of such devices, some designed for other purposes but adapted to audio use, such as the GU-50 transmitter tube.  Triode-strapped pentode circuits  A pentode can have its screen grid (grid 2) connected to the anode (plate), in which case it reverts to an ordinary triode with commensurate characteristics (lower anode resistance, lower mu, lower noise, more drive voltage required). The device is then said to be \\"triode-strapped\\" or \\"triode- connected\\". This is sometimes provided as an option in audiophile pentode amplifier circuits, to give the sought-after \\"sonic qualities\\" of a triode power amplifier. A resistor may be included in series with the screen grid to avoid exceeding the screen grid's power or voltage rating, and to prevent local oscillation. Triode-connection is a useful option for audiophiles who wish to avoid the expense of 'true' power triodes.

Brookland takes as its basis Thomas Pope's \\"Rainbow Bridge\\", a bridge that was proposed for the East River nearly a hundred years before the construction of John Roebling's Brooklyn Bridge, but which was never actually built.Benfey, Christopher, The View From The Bridge, The New York Review of Books, August 10, 2006, available online at http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19214 In Brookland, the bridge is the brainchild not of Pope but of a character invented by Barton: Prudence (\\"Prue\\") Winship, the proprietor of a successful gin distillery she inherited from her father. The novel is the story of the costs, both financial and personal, that the planning, construction, and ultimate destruction of the bridge exact from Prue and her community. Upon its publication, Brookland received widespread praise; in a review in the New Yorker magazine, Joan Acocella wrote that Prue Winship \\"is not a 'good-models' feminist heroine, nor is she one of the bad-girl heroines of second-stage feminism. She is a thorny, struggling soul. Together with the book's profound treatment of the spiritual ills born of the Enlightenment, this wonderful character is Barton's main gift to us.”Acocella, Joan, Big River, New Yorker, April 3, 2006.
