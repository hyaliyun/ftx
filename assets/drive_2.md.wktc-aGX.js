It drains into the Sogod Bay at the municipality of Sogod. The river's name means \\"big river\\" or \\"wide river\\" in Cebuano. For years, following the flooding of the river, it created an issue over the province. It has been quarried and re- channeled which caused the incidents. After many attempts, the issue remained unsolved. Formation By description, it can be considered as a braided river composed of several channels from near areas that divide and again reunite in a certain area forming an alluvial fan with very wide floodplain. As such, the river usually became hazardous during typhoon after a heavy rain. The river has been meandering its natural course. The occurrence is being observed by natives living along the river every time a flood occurs. Environmental issues The ecology of the Subangdaku River has been disturbed by human activity, such as: a) noise such as those caused by grinding of rocks during quarrying operations; b) fragmentation of river system preventing travel of aquatic organisms through a continuous river channel; c) silt deposited in the bay which is facilitated by rechanneling activities. The resulting fragmentation and siltation of Sogod Bay may have disturbed the life cycle of some organisms that require movement between the sea and the freshwater ecosystem such as Subangdaku. For instance, the behavior of a certain crab named locally as ‚ÄúKamwa‚Äù, has been reported by one of the local inhabitant who followed the crab upstream and found that the path the young traveled from the sea to upstream of Subangdaku reached until Barangay San Juan about above sea level. The behavior of this crab was that the adult laid eggs in the sea and when the eggs are hatched, the baby crabs traveled upstream. Other species observed and/or reported downstream were Katang, Ulang (freshwater shrimp), a small mollusk (a gastropod) having some spines on its shell locally known as Odianga and two kinds of freshwater fishes. Quarrying activities had been frequent in the area. Several companies have exploited and extracted sand and gravel in the area that are being accumulated by the river's current every time it floods. The extraction of sand and gravel weakens the river bed and makes the river vulnerable to flood and environmental occurrences such as erosion. After a typhoon strikes the area, because it has many channels, the current of the river easily gets so strong that it becomes hazardous to nearby villages. In 2001, part of the Philippine National Road was devastated. A 1994 study by Silliman University identified sand and gravel mining, rechanneling, and sand harvest near the river's mouth, as causes of degraded habitats and major water quality issues of the area. The same report mentioned mining as one of the harmful practices that Sogod Bay should be protected from, and it recommended regulating quarrying and rechanneling with competent planning based on scientific evidence and monitoring as a way to protect the Subangdaku River.

Sources The source of the word is Plato's dramatic work Phaedo ( in Attic Greek), which presents the final hours and execution of Socrates, ultimately, by those who were offended by his philosophical pursuit. Plato‚Äôs Phaedo tells the story of Phaedo of Elis recalling the death and final hours of Socrates some time afterwards to Echecrates, who had heard tell of Socrates' execution but has no detailed account and is curious to hear of it. Phaedo, being one of those present at Socrates' execution, begins and explains that he and others had gathered early to visit Socrates on the day of his execution. There, Simmias and Cebes had begun a discussion with Socrates on the afterlife, and Cebes in particular had questioned Socrates on his belief that the soul must be immortal. Phaedo recalls that Socrates had just presented an argument to this effect, when both Simmias and Cebes presented excellent objections. Phaedo breaks from his story and says to Echecrates: Phaedo then tells Echecrates that before replying to Simmias and Cebes' argument Socrates, having no doubt seen the disquiet that their objection had caused among all those present, which Phaedo himself evidenced above to Echecrates, breaks from his argumentation to make an important point: that they must not lose heart because of this objection and reject philosophy as a result. Phaedo says that Socrates begins thus: Plato's Socrates is warning the reader that, just as one should not hate his fellow man because they themselves were poor in judging character, they should not hate argumentation and reason ‚Äî partake in \\"misology\\" ‚Äî just because they may not be skilled enough to discern the flaws and strengths of an argument:  Modern provenance  The word misology itself is first attested in English in 1833, and was used in Benjamin Jowett's 1871 translation of Plato's work, Dialogues: \\"as there are misanthropists or haters of men, there are also misologists or haters of ideas.\\" The term was also used by Immanuel Kant in a passage from his 1785 work, Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten): \\"Misologie, d. i.

It is sometimes called the tiger spider due to its markings which look similar to a tiger. This species has historically been confused with Nephila clavipes, with the main distinguishing visual difference being significantly smaller black hair tufts on the legs. As with other spiders from the genus Nephila, they have a distinctive golden web. Studies have shown that orb-weaving spiders grow bigger and can produce more eggs in highly urbanised places due to more food being available, warmer temperatures, fewer predators such as birds, and no pesticide chemicals. These spiders are commonly found in both urban and natural landscapes.

It consisted mostly of men of Scandinavian descent and it had an initial strength of 3,000 housecarls and a fleet of 40 ships, which was subsequently reduced. Its last remnant was disbanded by Edward the Confessor in 1051.Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, pp. 171-3 In the 11th century, three courts outside Scandinavia were particularly prominent in recruiting Scandinavian troops:Pritsak 1981:386 Novgorod-Kiev (Kievan Rus') c. 980-1060, Constantinople (the Varangian Guard) 988-1204,Although after 1066, the Varangian Guard mostly consisted of Englishmen, see Pritsak 1981:386 and England 1018-1051. Scandinavia was however also a recruiting area for attacks against England and this is why a defence needed to be organized by the Danish king Cnut the Great.Pritsak 1981:410Pritsak 1981:411Pritsak 1981:410 refers here to the runestone U 617. The Thingmen attracted Swedish mercenaries, and probably some Norwegian as well. History =Formation and structure= In 1012 King √Üthelred the Unready of England ended several years of devastating attacks by a Danish army led by Thorkell the Tall by making a huge payment of Danegeld. Most of the raiders dispersed, but Thorkell himself entered English service with 45 ships and their crews. This force, based at Greenwich, was paid with money collected through the tax system established to raise Danegeld. They remained loyal to √Üthelred during the Danish invasion led by King Swein Forkbeard in 1013, which eventually drove √Üthelred to flee the country. When √Üthelred was restored to power in England in 1014, after the death of Swein, he retained or regained the services of Thorkell and his men, who continued to receive large sums of money.Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, pp. 139-45 However, in 1015 Thorkell, accompanied by 9 ships, joined the fresh invasion of England being prepared by Swein's son Cnut. According to a later saga tradition this defection was due to the massacre of a separate force of Danish troops brought to England by Swein and commanded by Thorkell's brother Hemming.Stenton 1971, p. 388 The chronicle of Florence of Worcester claims that the 40 ships which deserted √Üthelred to join Cnut's invasion force after its arrival in England, under the leadership of Ealdorman Eadric Streona of Mercia, were manned by Danish crews. If so, these may have been the residue of Thorkell's former followers who had remained in √Üthelred's service when their leader left.Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, p. 146 While the upheavals of 1015 thus ended, this experiment of keeping a standing, tax-funded force of Scandinavian mercenaries in England set a precedent which was followed by Cnut after his conquest of England, completed in 1016. Most of his invasion army was dismissed and returned home, but 40 ships and their crews were retained in the king's service. The 12th century Danish chronicler Sven Aggesen told a story of how these men were selected. According to this tale, Cnut had attracted a large number of men and many had not had the opportunity to distinguish themselves in battle.Enoksen 1998:117 Consequently, he decided to select those that were the most prominent in origin or wealth in order to form a royal bodyguard.Enoksen 1998:118 Therefore, he had a herald proclaim that only those who had especially valuable weapons would have the distinction of counting themselves among the king's housecarls. After this proclamation, those who were less affluent retired while the successful warriors, who had gathered considerable amounts of spoils of war, used their wealth to embellish their weaponry with gold and silver. He selected 3,000 men who were thenceforth the Thingmen. The Thingmen had their own laws, which enforced quality within the unit, even going so far as to make the men equal to the king. =Later development and dissolution= Under Cnut, the system of direct taxation in silver, based on an assessment of land value, which had been used as an occasional expedient by √Üthelred to raise individual lump sums of Danegeld, became a regular annual form of levy to support this standing force, a payment now known as heregeld (army-tax). Each man was paid 8 marks of silver, 12 marks for the helmsman who commanded each ship. As the new Danish dynasty consolidated its position, the number of troops employed was considerably diminished. By the reign of Cnut's son Harold Harefoot, who came to power in 1035, only 16 ships were kept in service.Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, p. 161 Harold's half-brother Harthacnut, who succeeded him in 1040 and arrived with a fleet from Denmark, dramatically increased the tax burden to pay for 60 or 62 ships in the first year of his rule in England, but reduced this force to 32 ships in 1041. This tax increase provoked violent unrest.Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, pp. 160-3 Under Edward the Confessor, who came to the throne in 1042, the standing force was further reduced and by 1050 he was employing only 14 ships. In that year 9 of these were dismissed and in 1051 the remaining force was disbanded and the heregeld was abolished.Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, pp. 171, 173 Runestones Several of its members are commemorated on runestones, such as the Viking Runestones and the England Runestones. One example is the Komstad Runestone which was raised in memory of the marshall Vr√°i, who had served in England with his brother Gunni, something that Vr√°i reported himself on the S√§vsj√∂ Runestone. Other examples are the K√•lsta Runestone, where two sons report that their father was a member of the Assembly Retinue,Jansson 1980:34 and the G√•singe Runestone which was raised in memory of a warrior who served Canute the Great.

The first female Lord Mayor of Perth, Scaffidi became mayor following the October 2007 council elections, after the retirement of her predecessor, Peter Nattrass, who served a record twelve years in the position. Scaffidi and the rest of the City of Perth council were suspended on 2 March 2018, while the state government investigated the council's operations. Early life Scaffidi was educated at Churchlands Primary School and Methodist Ladies' College after which she graduated as a dental therapist from the Western Australian Institute of Technology (now Curtin University). She served as an air hostess with TAA in 1980, worked in the hospitality industry in a marketing capacity and, in the 1990s, helped to promote export of semi-precious stones. She was the WA State Director of the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) for over ten years. She served two terms as a councillor before successfully contesting the lord- mayoralty.  Corruption and Crime Commission  In October 2015, the Corruption and Crime Commission of Western Australia found that Scaffidi had \\"signally failed in her duties\\" as lord mayor by accepting and failing to declare a $31,000 travel package to the 2008 Beijing Olympics from BHP, and other gifts from private companies that have dealings with the City of Perth. The commission found that Scaffidi had committed acts of \\"serious misconduct\\" but believed she had not acted corruptly. In 2016, Scaffidi insulted journalist Liam Bartlett on social media and was criticised by journalists for refusing to answer his questions about the undeclared travel and gifts while the matter was before the State Administrative Tribunal. Further investigation and suspension In May 2017 Western Australia's State Administrative Tribunal ruled that Scaffidi had committed 45 \\"serious breaches\\" of local government laws by failing to disclose gifts and overseas travel. The tribunal had the power to disqualify her from office for up to five years. In the previous month Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan called on Scaffidi to step aside and stated that he would look at the means to sack the lord mayor if she did not resign. He also called on the City of Perth councillors to move a motion of no confidence in the lord mayor. On 8 September, Scaffidi agreed to step aside pending a court appeal into the ruling. In early December 2017, the Court of Appeal set aside the Tribunal's orders, and Scaffidi announced that she would return to her statutory duties on 8 January 2018. On 2 March 2018, the Minister for Local Government, David Templeman, indefinitely suspended the entire City of Perth council, including Scaffidi, while a government panel investigates its operation and conduct. The move came after years of infighting between factions on council. The panel will make a recommendation as to whether the council should be permanently sacked. A government-appointed commission will oversee the city's operations while the investigation is underway. In October 2019, Scaffidi's term as Lord Mayor expired and the office was declared vacant until new elections could be scheduled in October 2020.

Life Pet≈ëcz began his career in literary life in 1981. He was the chief editor for over two years of the art periodical Jelenl√©t (Presence), \\"The journal \\"Presence\\" started again in 1981 with Andr√°s Pet≈ëcz as chief editor.\\" which was published by the Faculty of Humanities at the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University of Sciences in Budapest, and soon became a significant forum on contemporary literature. \\"The 80s are therefore eminently important in the literature of the recent past, for the changes that took place at that time laid the foundations for the literary life of our day. Very typically, one of the first such initiatives was taken at the University of Budapest, where some of us started a literary and art review, Jelenl√©t (Presence). The political powers classified it as a student paper and as such they did not ban it; indeed, they could not have done so easily at a time when strikes were common in Poland. One of the first privately initiated periodicals, Jelenl√©t presented the latest distinctive literary, artistic and, if only covertly, political endeavours. The period was far from being uneventful--we participated in the student movements demanding an autonomous student forum and independent teaching, and created the \\"independent peace movement\\" which, unlike the official peace movement, urged disarmament not only for the US but also for the Soviet Union.\\" He graduated from E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University of Sciences in 1986 where he studied Hungarian Literature and Language-History. After obtaining his degree he was an assistant at Gorkii State Library for a short time, and then worked as an editor for longer and shorter periods on literary magazines. Since then he has been working as a professional writer. Pet≈ëcz has taken part in several international literary and art festivals, e.g. in Paris (1986), in Tarascon (France, 1988), in Marseille (1995). He has been working as a university and college lecturer for seven years. Work =Poetry= Andr√°s Pet≈ëcz: Letter \\"A\\" (concrete poem, 1989) Pet≈ëcz has published around 25 books, including poems for adults and children, essays, fiction and reviews. Pet≈ëcz poetry volumes include the book A tenger d√≠cs√©rete (1994, ), and the poetry collections Meduza (2000, ) and A naps√ºt√∂tte s√°vban (2001, ). He also published a \\"collected poems book\\" under the title Majdnem minden (Almost everything, 2002, ). He also edited several volumes of avant-garde literature and worked as organizer for a variety of events showcasing experimental literature. He also was the editor of \\"Medium Art\\", a Selection of Hungarian Experimental Poetry. \\"Petocz has made an anthology for the Hungarian Experimental Poetry in 1990, the 'Medium Art'.\\" In the eighties he was one of the \\"leaders\\" of Hungarian avant-garde poetry, \\"Petocz was the leader of the New Wave of the Hungarian Avant-garde\\" having begun to work on sound poetry during the period. \\"Andras Petocz began to work with sound poetry in the 1980s, as one of the (then) young poets inspired by the more and more assiduous presence of Magyar Muhely in Hungary. Petocz's poetry essentially is based on the tradition of French phonetic poetry: the strong role of repetition is combined with a poetic language constructed of phonemes, syllables and relatively few words. He has been collaborating with the outstanding Hungarian composer, Laszlo Sary.\\" His visual and concrete poetry is well known. B√©la Vilcsek writes about his poetry: \\"Legends and extremes accompany Andr√°s Pet≈ëcz on his home ground. He always has a dichotomy, either wanting to pay respects to classicism or to modernity, conservatism or avant-garde, sonnet or free verse, tradition or the new. In his mid-thirties, he already commands an authoritative reputation with his life-work, in both its quantity and quality. There are few writers like this among those in his field.\\"B√©la Vilcsek: Afterword (In: Andras Petocz: In Praise of the Sea, cover, 1999, )\\" =Prose= The more than six prose books Andr√°s Pet≈ëcz has published contain essays and reviews such as Idegenk√©nt, Eur√≥p√°ban (As a Stranger in Europe, 1997, ), a series of short stories called Egykor volt h√°zibar√°taink (Once We Had House Friends, Chapters from a Family Saga, 2002, ), and two novels A sz√ºlet√©snap (The Birthday, 2006, ) and Idegenek (Strangers, 2007, ). The Birthday The Birthday is a novel that tells a family story spanning 30 years. Tony the little boy narrator is special in that he does not get older. He remains a child as he looks at events around him. Everyone is preparing for the birthday of the head of the family while they look at the Big Photo Album. The 30 years of the novel brings to life what happened from the early sixties to the nineties, how people lived in Central Europe and refers to the change of system in Hungary in 1989. The little boy narrator, still waiting in vain for his father at the beginning of the celebrations, becomes a man due to his missing father and his memories. He tells the family stories \\"in one breath\\" using spoken expressions and personal remarks. K√°roly D. Balla writes about A sz√ºlet√©snap: ‚ÄúThe author, who is himself on the threshold of dreams, redeems historical and family tragedies with angelic good humour, and what might make an adult grumpy and ill is rendered tolerable by the imagination of childhood memories and the genuineness of the hope in them.‚Äù Strangers In this novel, an eight- year-old girl learns to lie in order to survive. It is not clear exactly where and when Strangers takes place. Somewhere in Europe, or the edges of Europe, but it could be somewhere in America or Asia. Perhaps in the 20th century, but it could be the first decade of the 21st century. As the subtitle says, the story takes place \\"thirty minutes before the war\\". The little girl maintains human values even in a world of terror and oppression. Terrible things happen to small children on a daily basis. Across the border is the free world where there are no soldiers in charge, where you can travel freely. The free world might be reached through a rat infested tunnel. The novel deals with events that have already taken place in the 21st century and turns concrete events into fiction. It elaborates the terrorist atrocity of Beslan in Russia. Gy√∂rgy C. K√°lm√°n writes about Idegenek: ‚ÄúIn the world of the novel ‚Äì it is difficult to interpret Pet≈ëcz‚Äôs work any other way ‚Äì everyone is an outsider. As they are in the outside world (suggests the novel). For in this world (in the novel and outside) the fact of being an outsider means to be vulnerable to a deadly threat (or is itself a threat), it means oppression, helplessness and determined opposition. Being an outsider is not just about a different use of language (or using a different language), clothes, skin colour or customs, but is embodied primarily in oppression and power ‚Äì wherever the outsider may be. To be more precise, the defenceless and those in power are both outsiders for each other, and no matter who is in either position, for everyone else too.‚ÄùGy√∂rgy C.

Pet≈ëcz's poem \\"Eur√≥pa metafor√°ja\\" (Europe, metaphorically) won the Robert Graves Prize for best Hungarian poem of the year 1990.

Participations Andr√°s Pet≈ëcz has been to numerous writers‚Äô residences and has been a guest at numerous international writers' meetings. He spent three months in the United States in 1998, where he took part in an international writers‚Äô seminar within the framework of the International Writing Program (IWP) in Iowa City. While there, he took part in events with about 25 writers from all over the world, including Israeli prose writer Igal Sarna and the brasilien writer Bernardo Carvalho. From the IWP invitation, Pet≈ëcz contributed to several readings, including in New York, San Francisco and Portland, Maine. Similarly, he spent a month in 2001 at the Yaddo Art Center in Saratoga Springs, New York, where, among others, he met Rick Moody, the American prose writer.

Origin  The Dadheech Brahmin caste has a myth of origin which appears first to have been recorded in the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries with the publication of the Dadhimathi Puranam, a Sanskrit text comprising 966 verses. The publication was typical of its time, when many castes in India were forming organisations and promoting mythical origins as a response to the social and economic changes under the British Raj administration. Prior to this, the only records of Dadheech people were those of traditional geneaologist communities. The work attempts to fuse the creation of the caste itself, based on a genealogy of Hindu mythology, with the origin and deeds of Dadhimati as recounted both in well-known Hindu texts and regional story- telling. It is, according to Lawrence Babb, \\"a manifestation of an effort on the part of an educated and activist element among the Dadhich Brahmins to reconfigure their identity as a community in a way that diverged significantly from older traditions\\". Further, it contains problematic logic that undermines the claim to be Brahmin.  History  The Dadheech are named after their patron goddess, Dadhimati, and were once prevalent around the Dadhimati Mata Temple that lies between the villages of Goth and Manglod in Nagaur district, Rajasathan. An inscription dating from 608 CE at that temple refers to a community called the Dadhya, whom the Dadheech believe to be ancestors of their own community. They have both gotras and khampas as subdivisions. Examples of the latter include Gothecha, Mangalodya, Asopa, Inanya, Khatoda, Borada, and Didawanya, all of which refer to ancient villages or localities. The temple inscription mentions gotras but not khampas, which may suggest the khampas were a later development. The Puranam mythology notes 144 Hindu sages who originate the alleged 144 exogamous and patrilineal clans of the Dadheech, although in fact there have never been 144 such clans. Few Dadheech live in the Nagpaur area nowadays, with many of them having already begun a process of moving away from it by the time that the Puranam was published. They were relatively well educated and so could get work as professionals or in service jobs, and it may have been their gradual dispersal that in part gave rise to the publication. Babb refers to it was a \\"window into the mindset of the caste's identity theorists as they found themselves confronting certain problems\\", including maintaining caste unity in the face of this dispersal and potential challenges to their claimed Brahminic status once they moved into more cosmopolitan areas. A Dadheech caste association was formed in 1910. It soon ran into difficulties with other castes who worshipped Dadhimati, who is a goddess for many, perhaps all, castes of the region even though little known elsewhere. Thus, probably in 1912, a dispute evolved between the Dadheech and the Parasar community, who were priests of the Dadhimati Mata Temple and probably had been for at least a century. The Parasars attempted to obtain legal recognition of their rights regarding custodianship of the temple, perhaps in reaction to a sensing that the Dadheech were becoming a more organised, mobilised community. This led to a court ruling in 1918 that they had no such rights. The inscription dating from 608 CE, which mentions the Dadhya, may have been significant evidence in the Dadheech victory but at least equally important was the relative sophistication of the Dadheech, who by then were already entering their cosmopolitan phase and had contacts that the less privileged Parasars could not match. There is a significance to control of the temple that goes beyond the building itself, since control of that also gives control of the land surrounding it and income from shops and stalls. This appears to have been the cause of another dispute involving the Dadheech, this time with a clan of the Jat people called the Bidyasar, who also claim Dadhimati as an ancestor in an origin myth. Much of the history of this comes from word-of-mouth. As with the Parasars, the Bidyasars were initially at a disadvantage due to their rustic status but nonetheless seem to have become embroiled in a struggle for control from some time in the early twentieth century. This struggle became more evident in the 1950s, by which time the Jats had emerged as a significant political force in the state. Nathuram Mirdha, who was a prominent Jat politician, failed in his attempt to establish a boarding school in the temple grounds during the 1950s, then the Jats were upset in the early 1970s when the Dadheech set up a trust to run the temple. The latter incident appears eventually to have been settled in the Dadheech's favour after a protracted legal battle. , Jats continue to protest about the temple management but the Dadheech community remains dominant and in control, coming together both physically and emotionally from a distance in defence of their origin myth as ancestors of the goddess.  Culture  One of the inconsistences in the Puranam noted by Babb is the imposition of a gotra system. He says that few Dadheech even now know of which gotra they belong and that their patriclan exogamy predates it in marriage customs. Gotra knowledge seems never to have previously been a prerequisite for marriage but the imposition of a gotra system was seen by the Puranam intellectuals as a necessary part of the claim to be Brahmin. The temple of Dadhimati is remotely situated and usually sparsely visited but many Dadheech people, and others, attend it around the time of the spring and autumn melas. Dadhichi-Jayanti, the birth date of Dadhichi, is celebrated each year among Dadheech Brahmins by the offering of prayers to the gods, the organisation of kirtans and havans in temples and also sports events for children.

Early life and career  Ventilation shaft of the Wapping Tunnel, Liverpool Woods was born in London on 28 April 1814, the son of Samuel Woods, a merchant. After education at private schools, and some training at Bristol, he became in 1834 an assistant to John Dixon, recently appointed chief engineer of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Woods was placed in charge of the section, 15 miles in length, between Liverpool and Newton-le-Willows, including Wapping Tunnel between the Cavendish cutting and Park Lane goods stations; and in 1836 he succeeded Dixon as chief engineer, taking also charge of the mechanical department. The Liverpool and Manchester railway was amalgamated with the Grand Junction Railway in 1845. Woods remained until the end of 1852 in charge of the works appertaining to the Liverpool and Manchester section, including the construction of the Victoria Tunnel (completed 1848) between Edge Hill station and the docks, a large goods station adjoining the West Waterloo Dock, and a line between Patricroft and Clifton, opened in 1850. In 1853 he established himself in London as a consulting engineer.  Academic works  During his eighteen years' work on the Liverpool and Manchester line Woods took a prominent part in various early experimental investigations into the working of railways. In 1836 he made observations on the waste of fuel due to condensation in the long pipes conveying steam a quarter of a mile to the winding engines used for hauling trains through the Edge Hill tunnel, the gradient of which was then considered too steep for locomotives. He was a member of a committee appointed by the British Association in 1837 to report on the resistance of railway trains. In 1838 he presented to the Institution of Civil Engineers a paper 'On Certain Forms of Locomotive Engines,' which contains some of the earliest accurate details of the working of locomotives, and for which he was awarded a Telford Medal in silver. The consumption of fuel in locomotives was the subject of a paper presented by him to the Liverpool Polytechnic Society in 1843 (published in 1844), and of a contribution to a new edition of Thomas Tredgold's Steam Engine in 1850. In 1853 Woods carried out, with W. P. Marshall, some experiments on the locomotives of the London and North Western Railway, between London and Rugby, and three joint reports were made to the general locomotive committee of the railway, recommending certain weights and dimensions for various classes of engines. These were followed, in 1854, by a joint report on the use of coal as a substitute for coke, which had been used hitherto.  Work in South America  From 1854 onwards his practice was chiefly connected with the railways of South America, including the Central Argentine Railway, the Copiap√≥ extension, Santiago and Valparaiso, and Coquimbo railways in Chile, and the Mollenda-Arequipa and Callao-Oroya lines in Peru. He was responsible not only for surveys and construction, but also for the design of rolling stock to meet the somewhat special conditions. Other engineering work included a wrought-iron pier, 2400 feet long, built in 1851 on screw piles at Pisco on the coast of Peru, and a quay-wall built at Bilbao in 1877. In the 'battle of the gauges' he favoured the Irish gauge (5 feet 3 inches) or the Indian gauge (5 feet 6 inches). He regarded break of gauge as a mistake.  Professional institutions  In 1877, as president of the mechanical science section of the British Association, he delivered an address on 'Adequate Brake Power for Railway Trains.' Elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 7 April 1846, he became a member of its council in December 1869, and was president between November 1886 and November 1887. His presidential address contains much information as to the early history of railways. In 1884 he was president of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers.  Later life  He died at his residence, 45 Onslow Gardens, London, on 14 June 1903, and was buried at Chenies, Buckinghamshire. His portrait in oils, by Miss Porter, is in the possession of the Institution of Civil Engineers. He married in 1840 Mary, daughter of Thomas Goodman of Birmingham, by whom he had three sons and two daughters. Among their descendants are a number of senior clergymen, including Theodore Woods (1874-1932), Bishop of Winchester, Edward Woods (1877-1953), Bishop of Lichfield, Frank Woods (1907-1992), Archbishop of Melbourne, and Robin Woods (1914-1997), Bishop of Worcester.

Museum origins Pallot Heritage Steam Museum Lyndon Pallot (known as Don) amassed a large collection of Jersey's mechanical, agricultural, and transport heritage, with a view to preserving the artefacts, and eventually exhibiting them. This ambition was realised in 1990, when the Pallot Steam Museum was opened. Items were purchased or acquired on long-term loan, and railway locomotives were brought to Jersey from Great Britain, Belgium, and Alderney. Members of the Pallot family, and other volunteers working with them, also carried out extensive repair and restoration work on most of the exhibits, restoring their original appearance through cosmetic restoration, or (in many cases) restoring items to full working condition. The L C Pallot Trust was established in 1985 with the object of promoting the permanent preservation of steam engines, farm machinery, vehicles, and other exhibits. Since the death of the museum's founder, the Trust has continued to work according to his original vision. The current trustees are Don Pallot's surviving children. Expansion into new premises Shortly after the opening of the museum, the trustees began planning for expansion. On the same site as the original museum buildings they were able to lease a larger and more modern exhibition hall from a property company also owned by the Pallot family. This building now houses the main collection. A Church Pipe organ and Compton Theatre organ were amongst a large collection of musical instruments, farm machinery, motor cars, other road vehicles, and steam locomotives housed in the new premises. Display cases were installed for the demonstration of models and memorabilia. The official opening ceremony of the new premises took place on Liberation Day 2002, when Michael Wilcock, owner of the former Jersey Motor Museum, cut the ceremonial ribbon. Railways at the museum =Standard gauge demonstration railway= A train running on the standard gauge railway. A railway operates around the perimeter of the museum site. A Victorian style station was re-constructed using surviving elements of Snow Hill railway station, St Helier, and officially opened on Liberation Day 1996 by Senator Dick Shenton. More recently a lean-to shed has been constructed over the main running line, and adjacent to the exhibition hall, to house the standard gauge service train. The railway usually operates on Thursdays when the museum is open, and visitors are able to purchase travel tickets to ride on the train. A ride consists of two circuits of the railway, and the duration of the journey is approximately ten minutes. Passengers are conveyed in two restored Victorian railway carriages, originally built and operated by the North London Railway in England. The two carriages were discovered at Stratford and were transferred to the Pallot museum in 1989 for restoration. Their original wheels had not survived, but were replaced from the Woodham Brothers scrapyard at Barry Docks in Wales. The museum owns five standard gauge locomotives. One diesel shunting engine is stored out of use, awaiting restoration. Two steam locomotives are housed as museum exhibits, but are not suitable for use on the railway, owing to its tight radius curves. These engines are * 0-6-0T \\"La Meuse\\", built in Belgium in 1931, with outside cylinders and Walschaerts valve gear. * 0-4-0ST \\"Foleshill\\", built in Bristol, England, by Peckett and Sons, works number 2085, in 1948. The other two steam locomotives are available for use on the demonstration railway, and are: * 0-4-0ST \\"Kestrel\\", built at Bristol, England, by Peckett and Sons, works number 2129, in 1952. * 0-4-0ST \\"J T Daly\\", built at Stafford, England, by W.G. Bagnall, works number 2450, in 1931. \\"Kestrel\\" is currently the main locomotive operating the demonstration railway. \\"J T Daly\\" previously operated on the Foxfield Light Railway and the Alderney Railway before coming to the Pallot Museum in 1993. Following restoration the locomotive operated the demonstration railway for several years, but is now awaiting overhaul and renewal of the boiler ticket. =Narrow gauge demonstration railway= The Simplex locomotive on the narrow gauge railway. A narrow gauge railway forms a simple loop around a large paddock behind the main exhibition hall of the museum. This railway is equipped with four open passenger coaches for providing pleasure rides to visitors. Motive power is provided by an 0-4-0 steam-outline Simplex locomotive. This railway is operationally complete, but currently out of use. Funding On the platform The Museum premises are leased to the Trust by the family owned property company. The Museum's only source of income is from admission charges, sales of souvenirs, donations and profits from the two annual Steam Fayres which are held in May and the Autumn, with more than ¬£40,000 donated to charities from Steam Fayre profits. No other financial support is available. Two full-time members of staff are employed and undertake a variety of jobs. Administration and supervision duties are undertaken voluntarily by the trustees in order to keep running costs to a minimum. Don Pallot The museum was founded by Lyndon Charles Pallot, (known as ‚ÄòDon'), who was born in Trinity and educated at the parish school.Pallot Steam, Motor & General Museum He developed an interest in mechanics from an early age and, after leaving school at the age of 14, started remaking bicycles until he became a trainee engineer at Jersey Railways where he developed his enthusiasm for steam. In the early 1930s Pallot opened Central Motor Works at Sion, Trinity, an agricultural works. He was a gifted engineer, and invented several agricultural implements which were employed on Jersey farms, and are now displayed in the museum, including the Pallot elevator digger, the last furrow reversible plough, the single furrow reversible plough, the tractor mounted C√¥til winch, and the tractor mounted 2 point linkage transport box. His ability to improvise proved invaluable during the difficult years of the Occupation of Jersey by Nazi Germany during World War II. Pallot lived at Sion in Jersey, with his wife Dolly, and had a large family of 6 sons and 5 daughters. The Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies traction engine \\"Dolly May\\", a prominent exhibit in the museum, and still operational, was named in hour of his wife. He died in 1996 at the age of 85.

Its capital was Blankenburg, it was located in and near the Harz mountains. History =County of Blankenburg= About 1123 Lothair of Supplinburg, then Duke of Saxony, had Blankenburg Castle erected in the Eastphalian Harzgau region. His vassal Poppo I of Blankenburg, a relative of Lothair's wife Richenza of Northeim, is documented as count over the Eastern Harzgau since 1128. He later also appeared as a ministerialis of the Welf duke Henry the Lion. After Poppo's death around 1161, his sons divided their heritage: Conrad took his residence at Regenstein Castle, north of Blankenburg, and became the ancestor of the noble House of Regenstein, while his brother Siegfried I retained Blankenburg Castle. In 1180 Henry the Lion was deposed by an intervention of his Hohenstaufen cousin Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, allied with many Saxon vassals and former supporters of Duke Henry. However, the then ruling Counts of Blankenburg, Henry and Siegfried II, remained true liensmen of their liege lord, until Prince-Bishop Dietrich of Halberstadt, newly raised to Imperial immediacy by the emperor, besieged Blankenburg Castle and defeated them with his troops in 1182. After swearing allegiance to Dietrich, the brothers could maintain their county, their descendants laid out the Blankenburg settlement beneath the castle about 1200. The estates remained under suzerainty of the Halberstadt prince-bishops, strongly contested by the Welf dukes of Brunswick- L√ºneburg. Blankenburg Castle In 1599 the comital family became extinct, and the fief was reverted to the Prince-Bishopric, which at that time was held by the Welf administrator Duke Henry Julius of Brunswick and Lunenburg. Even though the Bishopric was secularised as the Principality of Halberstadt and given to the \\"Great Elector\\" Frederick William of Brandenburg by the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, the Welfs kept the fief of Blankenburg, which became an eastern exclave of their Principality of Wolfenb√ºttel. In 1690, the county was given to the younger son of Duke Anthony Ulrich of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, Prince Louis Rudolph. =Principality of Blankenburg= In 1707 Prince Louis Rudolph managed to betroth his daughter Elisabeth Christine to Charles VI of Habsburg and to get Charles' elder brother Emperor Joseph I to raise his county to an immediate principality, thus ending Halberstadt's mediate liege lordship. Since 1731 Prince Louis Rudolph of Blankenburg upon the death of his elder brother Augustus William also inherited the Principality of Wolfenb√ºttel, both principalities were ruled in personal union, however, the princes of Blankenburg moved to Wolfenb√ºttel, the capital of the inherited bigger principality. After the defeat of Duke Charles William Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel by Napol√©on Bonaparte at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, the Principality of Blankenburg was annexed to the newly established Kingdom of Westphalia in 1807, which in turn was dissolved after the Battle of Leipzig and Blankenburg was restituted. Charles William's son and successor, the \\"Black Duke\\" Frederick William of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, returned from British exile and entered into fighting the French expansion in Europe, dying at the Battle of Quatre Bras in 1815. =District of Blankenburg= Duchy of Brunswick (1914), with southeastern Blankenburg district In 1815 the principalities of Wolfenb√ºttel and Blankenburg were de jure united as Duchy of Brunswick, with the former Principality of Blankenburg becoming an administrative district within the new duchy. The duchy became the Free State of Brunswick after the abdication of the dukes in 1918. After the apportionment of assets and liabilities between the states of the Weimar Republic and the abdicated regnal houses in 1924 the ducal family maintained - among other estates - its castle in Blankenburg am Harz and Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick, and his family returned from their Austrian exile in 1930 in order to live there. In 1942 the District of Blankenburg, until then a Brunswickian exclave between the Free State of Anhalt and the Prussian provinces of Hanover and Saxony became territorially connected with mainland Brunswick in the course of a territorial redeployment between the Free State of Brunswick and the Free State of Prussia. According to the London Protocol (September 1944) all of the Free State of Brunswick was supposed to become part of the future British zone of occupation in Germany. So after US forces had conquered the region in April 1945 the District of Blankenburg was handed over to the Britons on 1 July. However, on July 22 the Britons put into effect a territorial redeployment between their zone and the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, shortening the zonal border by assigning exclaves and salients along the border to the respective other zone (mostly) surrounding them. Thus the District of Blankenburg was divided at its narrowest section into a western third, remaining with the British zone and the eastern two thirds, including the eponymous capital, becoming part of the Soviet zone to the dismay of the population there. The British army helped the ducal family to evacuate their chattels with 30 army trucks, a favour which other unfortunate families, not related to the British royal family, could not enjoy. At uniting the Free State of Brunswick, except of the seized eastern exclaves and salients, and further German states to become Lower Saxony in 1946, the western third of the former Principality or District of Blankenburg, respectively, became part of that state. Until 1 July 1972 it formed a district of its own, named District of Blankenburg (), with the capital in Braunlage. Then - by an administrative redeployment - the western district was divided between the districts of Goslar and Osterode. The eastern two thirds became first part of the Province of Saxony and then of the state of Saxony- Anhalt, founded in 1946. The eastern District of Blankenburg () was dissolved on 30 June 1950, with its territory divided between the districts of Quedlinburg and Wernigerode. Since 1 July 2007 its former territory is included in the new Hartz mountains district. Geography As of 1789, the Principality of Blankenburg was surrounded by (from the north clockwise): Brandenburg (County of Stolberg-Wernigerode and Principality of Halberstadt), Anhalt-Bernburg, Brandenburg (County of Hohnstein), and Brunswick-Grubenhagen. Cities were Blankenburg am Harz and Hasselfelde. As of 1932, the District of Blankenburg was surrounded by (from north clockwise): Prussian Province of Saxony, Free State of Anhalt, Province of Saxony, Prussian Province of Hanover. Cities were Blankenburg am Harz, Braunlage and Hasselfelde.

Marseille was the first band to win the \\"UK Battle of the Bands\\" competition at Wembley Arena in 1977. History Marseille formed in Liverpool in early 1976, and released their debut album, Red, White and Slightly Blue on the Mountain Records label in 1978. Original members were Paul Dale (vocals), Neil Buchanan (guitar), Andy Charters (second guitar), Keith Knowles (drums) and Steve Dinwoodie (bass). Marseille were the first band to win \\"UK Battle of the Bands\\" with the finals judged by Brian May and Roger Taylor of Queen at Wembley Arena on 31 October 1977. Marseille gathered a small fan base while promoting their first album as support for other groups such as Judas Priest, Nazareth, Whitesnake and UFO. Keith Knowles - 4 years ago stated on You Tube, and it is still on there - \\"I was the drummer on all albums and an original member of Marseille. We took the name because 'Marseille' was a French rough seaport like Liverpool and to be honest we were struggling to rename ourselves as we were originally called AC/DC but had to change for obvious reasons. All tracks on this album were recorded 'live' so what you hear is not manufactured in any way. We all have great memories of touring with UFO who were absolutely brilliant with us and made sure we had sound-checks every night. Phil Mogg and Pete Way were like a double act and such great blokes.........to stand in the wings listening to Schenker's lead break on Love to Love will live with me forever....and what a nice person he was.\\" Their debut album contained very raunchy lyrics but suffered somewhat from lack of promotion and limitation of release. The single \\"Kiss Like Rock 'n' Roll\\" was produced by Nazareth guitarist Manny Charlton. Their second album release, the eponymous Marseille, received radio airplay, extending their fanbase in the UK. Several tracks off this album featured in the \\"Alternative Top 20 Charts\\" published in Sounds magazine with other emerging new wave of British heavy metal bands such as Saxon, Def Leppard and Iron Maiden.NWOBHM#List of NWOBHM artists Marseille were the first NWOBHM band to tour and have an album released in the U.S. on RCA Records. The band promoted their Marseille album on tour in the U.S. with Scottish rock band Nazareth and American south coast boogie band, Blackfoot during the summer of 1980. Unfortunately, the band arrived back in the UK to witness the demise of Mountain, their record and management company. With all their equipment still stranded in the U.S., the band were forced off the road and into a two-year legal battle with liquidators, which precluded them pursuing another recording contract. During this time, Paul Dale, Andy Charters and Neil Buchanan left the band. Charters moved to the U.S. and Buchanan started a career in television. The two remaining members, Keith Knowles and Steve Dinwoodie later recruited vocalist Sav Pearse and guitarist Marc Railton from local Liverpool band Savage Lucy to complete a third album entitled Touch the Night on the Ultra Noise label in 1984. However, lack of industry interest in the band caused this iteration of Marseille to split up soon after. Touch the Night was labeled by Kerrang! magazine as a closet classic that should have taken the band to higher ground. In 2003, a two-disc CD aptly titled Rock You Tonight became the Marseille Anthology and was released by Castle Communications, a subsidiary division of Sanctuary Records Group. The album, containing material from all three of Marseille's previous albums, garnered some critical acclaim being hailed \\"The best box set of 2003\\" by George Smith of Village Voice magazine. The original line-up reunited for a handful of gigs in 2008, however, Paul Dale soon left the band and was replaced in February 2009 by Nigel Roberts. The band recorded an EP, FourPlay which was released on the Gas Station Music label in 2009. In 2010, Keith Knowles and Steve Dinwoodie stepped down to be replaced by Gareth Webb (drums) and Lee Andrews (bass). The band recorded their first full album in 25 years, Unfinished Business in early 2010. The album was unveiled at the band's appearance at the Hard Rock Hell festival in December 2010. A full UK tour supported by Exit State followed. In April 2011, Gareth Webb stepped down and was replaced by Ace Finchum (also a member of Tigertailz) on drums. The band continued a heavy gig schedule throughout 2011 and worked on new material for a release in 2012 but this never materialised and the band slowly faded.

It was formerly an orphan receptor, GPR154, until the discovery of neuropeptide S as the endogenous ligand. Increased expression of this gene in ciliated cells of the respiratory epithelium and in bronchial smooth muscle cells is associated with asthma. This gene is a member of the G protein- coupled receptor 1 family and encodes a plasma membrane protein. Mutations in this gene have also been associated with this disease.  Clinical significance  In the CNS, activation of the NPSR by NPS promotes arousal and anxiolytic-like effects. In addition, mututations in NPSR have been linked to a susceptibility to asthma (rs3249801, A107I). Hence NPSR has also been called GPRA (G protein-coupled receptor for asthma susceptibility). Activation of NPSR in the airway epithelium has a number of effects including upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases which are involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. It has been shown that activation of NPSR by NPS affects both gastrointestinal motility and mucosal permeability simultaneously. Aberrant signaling and upregulation of NPSR1 could potentially exacerbate dysmotility and hyperpermeability by local mechanisms in gastrointestinal functional and inflammatory reactions. The very rare NPSR mutation Y206H, which makes the receptor more sensitive to NPS, is found in human families that need less sleep time than normal ones. It has similar effects in transgenic mice, making them resistant to memory impairment caused by lack of sleep.

They occur naturally in some eukaryotic organelle genomes. In the mitochondria-derived kinetoplast of trypanosomes, minicircles encode guide RNAs for RNA editing. In Amphidinium, the chloroplast genome is made of minicircles that encode chloroplast proteins.  In vitro experimentally-derived minicircles  Minicircles are small (~4kb) circular plasmid derivatives that have been freed from all prokaryotic vector parts. They have been applied as transgene carriers for the genetic modification of mammalian cells, with the advantage that, since they contain no bacterial DNA sequences, they are less likely to be perceived as foreign and destroyed. (Typical transgene delivery methods involve plasmids, which contain foreign DNA.) The smaller size of minicircles also extends their cloning capacity and facilitates their delivery into cells. Their preparation usually follows a two-step procedure: * production of a 'parental plasmid' (bacterial plasmid with eukaryotic inserts) in E. coli * induction of a site-specific recombinase at the end of this process but still in bacteria. These steps are followed by the ** excision of prokaryotic vector parts via two recombinase-target sequences at both ends of the insert ** recovery of the resulting minicircle (vehicle for the highly efficient modification of the recipient cell) and the miniplasmid by capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) The purified minicircle can be transferred into the recipient cell by transfection or lipofection and into a differentiated tissue by, for instance, jet injection. Conventional minicircles lack an origin of replication, so they do not replicate within the target cells and the encoded genes will disappear as the cell divides (which can be either an advantage or disadvantage depending on whether the application demands persistent or transient expression). A novel addition to the field are nonviral self- replicating minicircles, which owe this property to the presence of a S/MAR- Element. Self-replicating minicircles hold great promise for the systematic modification of stem cells and will significantly extend the potential of their plasmidal precursor forms (\\"parental plasmids\\"), the more as the principal feasibility of such an approach has amply been demonstrated for their plasmidal precursor forms.

It is just north of the town of Saltillo off U.S. Highway 45. History Barrett Ridge was founded in 1858 by Edmond Barrett. He was an Irish Catholic immigrant who left Ireland in 1848, during the great famine. The community was centered around the St. Thomas Aquinas, which burned in 2009. Edmond (Ned) and one of his sisters, Briget, joined other immigrants fleeing the Great Famine and went to America in search of a way to provide for their family. On the way over, Briget fell from the boat while sleepwalking and drowned. Ned worked hard when he got to America and sent money home to the family in Ireland. He worked his way south and then moved westward into Mississippi in 1852. Ned married Mary Vina Warren on December 29, 1858 and they settled into a log cabin on a gentle rolling hill near Saltillo. On March 10, 1866 Edmond (Ned) Barrett had made enough money to purchase that land, which became known as Barrett Ridge. Ned and Mary had 11 children, whom they raised in the log cabin on Barrett Ridge. Most of them established homes there and raised their own children on the Ridge. The Ridge is located 10 miles north of Tupelo and 4 miles northwest of Saltillo in Lee County and now consists of descendants of Edmond Barrett: the Barrett, Larkin, Bishop, Poppelreiter, Greenwood, Gusmus, Long, and Brown families and more.

Biography =Early life= Yossi Peled was born Jozef (Jeffke) Mendelevich in Belgium. (\\"Jeffke,\\" or Little Joe, is the diminutive form of the Flemish nickname for Jozef/Joseph). During World War II, he and his sister were adopted by a Catholic family. All of his family except his mother died in Auschwitz concentration camp during the Holocaust. After the war, his mother reclaimed him, and they made aliyah to what became Israel with the assistance of the Jewish Brigade. Peled studied history at Tel Aviv University, gaining a BA, and later settled in kibbutz Negba. He is divorced and the father of two children. =Military career= Peled served in the Israel Defense Forces for 30 years. During the Six-Day War, Peled was a company commander in the 9th Battalion of the 7th Armored Brigade of the 84th Armored Division, under General Israel Tal. In the War of Attrition, he served as a battalion commander on the Suez Canal. In the Yom Kippur War, Peled was in command of the reservist 205th Armored Brigade, under Moshe Peled's division. His brigade moved from Jerusalem to the Golan Heights and engaged the Syrian Army on the northern front. Later in the 1970s, Peled was placed in command of the 252nd Division in the Sinai Peninsula. In the First Lebanon War, he commanded a provision unit nicknamed Yossi's Force, east of Lake Qaraoun. Peled's final military position was the command of the IDF's Northern Command, which he held from 1986 to 1991. =Government and political career= After serving as the CEO of Tadiran Telecom, Peled has held numerous positions in government offices, not officially entering politics. In 1993, he served as head of the Second Israeli Broadcasting Authority, as well as heading several government- appointed committees, including: *Formulation of a plan for a government policy regarding communications (1996) *Investigation of the causes and failures which led to the kidnapping of 3 soldiers by Hezbollah in Shebaa farms in October 2000 *Formulation of a policy for the treatment of South Lebanon Army personnel in Israel *Investigation of the railway incident which left 5 dead near Beit Yehoshua (2006) In 1996, Peled joined the Likud party and was a major supporter of Binyamin Netanyahu. For the 2009 elections he won fifteenth place on the Likud list, and entered the Knesset as the party won 27 seats. He was later appointed Minister without Portfolio in Netanyahu's government. However, he resigned from the Knesset on 16 September 2012, and left his ministerial post on 27 September. During his term as a minister, Peled reiterated his support for the Migron Bill, a bill that would give outposts in the West Bank immunity from destruction. On another occasion, he expressed his support for the South Lebanon Army, saying that \\"we have a moral obligation to 600 families of South SLA in Israel\\".

Total annual average production is 950 GWh. Operations The company operates the power stations of Nyg√•rd, H√•kvikelva, Sildvik, S√∏rfjord I, S√∏rfjord II, Sirkevann and Taraldsvik. The power grid is through the Narvik Energinett, that is owned 49% by HelgelandsKraft. The company owns its windfarms through the 50% owned companies Nordkraft Vind (that operates Nyg√•rdsfjellet), Vester√•lskraft Vind and Lofotkraft Vind. History On 21 December 1913 the Narvik Kommunale Elektrisitetsverk was established by the municipality. The same year the first power station, H√∏ybakkfoss, was opened and street lighting was established in Narvik, while Silvannfos was built two years later. The company also established an electrical article store and installation division, but these were closed in 1995 and 1990, respectively. In 1922 M√∏lnfoss was opened, and in 1923 the Norwegian State Railways announced that Ofotbanen was to be electrified, and NKE built Nyg√•rdsvassdraget to cover the need, opening in 1932. In 1949 H√•kvikvassdraget was rebuilt with one new power station. In 1995 the company, that had been a municipal agency, was transformed to a limited company with the municipality as sole owner. From 1998 to 2001 Narvik Energi increased its ownership in Nordkraft from 17% to 100%, but at the same time HelgelandsKraft and Vester√•lskraft bought part of Narvik Energi. In 2002 the Danish state enterprise Energi E2 (now DONG) bought a third of the company, through buying out Vester√•lskraft, part of HelgelandsKrafts ownership and through an issue. In 2003 the power grid was demerged into a Narvik Energinett and 49% sold to HelgelandsKraft. In 2005 the wind farm at Nyg√•rdsfjellet was opened.

He was the older brother of the team's principal owner and managing general partner Hal Steinbrenner. Early life Steinbrenner was born in Culver, Indiana, the older son of George and Elizabeth Joan Steinbrenner (n√©e Zieg), both of German descent. He had two sisters, Jessica Steinbrenner and Jennifer Steinbrenner (formerly Swindal). Hank was named for his grandfather, Henry George Steinbrenner II, who made the family fortune in the shipping business. Steinbrenner attended Culver Academy and Central Methodist College, where he played soccer and earned a degree in history and political science. Career In the 1980s, Steinbrenner worked for the New York Yankees, which his father bought while he attended Culver Academy, gaining experience in baseball working with executives Lou Piniella, Woody Woodward, and Clyde King. In 1990, when George was suspended from baseball, the Yankees initially suggested Hank would succeed George as the team's managing partner. The other MLB owners indicated they would not approve Hank, and Hank stepped away from the team. Steinbrenner left baseball to run Kinsman Stable, the Steinbrenner-owned horse stable in Ocala, Florida. He also coached soccer at Vanguard High School in Ocala, became vice president and director of Bay Farms Corporation in 1985, and chairman of Minch Transit Company in 1987, and vice president of the Mid-Florida Hotels Corporation in 1990. He also served on the board of directors for the Ocala Breeders Sales Company. In 2000, he partnered with Gwynn Racing to field a car in the National Hot Rod Association. From 2007 onward, George ceded most day-to-day control of the Yankees to Hal and Hank due to failing health. During his stewardship of the Yankees, Hank, like his father, gained a reputation for being outspoken. He was at times criticized by many New York sports columnists for his off-the-cuff remarks that seemed to lack forethought. Despite his outspoken persona, Steinbrenner was not frequently seen around the team and instead did most of his work from the Yankees offices in Tampa, Florida. He did make a rare appearance in February 2015 to examine Yoan Moncada. =Controversial statements= Steinbrenner voiced his displeasure with the term Red Sox Nation in a 2008 interview: In response, Red Sox principal owner John W. Henry inducted him into Red Sox Nation, complete with a membership card giving him access to an array of options, including the group newsletter, bumper stickers, pins, Green Monster seats, and a hat personally autographed by David Ortiz. Concerning the Yankees' spring training feud with the Tampa Bay Rays in 2008, Steinbrenner stated, \\"I don't want these teams in general to forget who subsidizes a lot of them, and it's the Yankees, the Red Sox, Dodgers, Mets ... I would prefer if teams want to target the Yankees that they at least start giving some of that revenue sharing and luxury tax money back. From an owner's point of view, that's my point.\\" Regarding former Yankees manager Joe Torre, Steinbrenner said that his father did not get enough respect for hiring Torre in 1995, and that Joe Girardi has \\"... a little more fire in his belly\\" compared to Torre when it comes to managing. Steinbrenner went on to say that he would \\"support everything [Girardi] does\\" and \\"[Girardi] was the manager I wanted, and that's not anything towards Joe Torre. That's the manager we wanted at the time. Times change.\\" In September 2008, after the Yankees were eliminated from playoff contention for the first time since 1993, Steinbrenner penned an article in Sporting News criticizing Major League Baseball's divisional format. Personal life Steinbrenner and his wife divorced in 2004. They had four children. His son, George Michael Steinbrenner IV, owns the IndyCar team Steinbrenner Racing, which fields a full-time entry in the IndyCar Series in partnership with Harding Racing under the banner of Harding Steinbrenner Racing. Steinbrenner died on April 14, 2020, twelve days after his 63rd birthday, of complications related to a longstanding, unspecified liver issue.

It was first published in 2006 by Gallimard, and has appeared in their \\"folio\\" series as no. 4588. , it has been translated into Russian. Plot The middle-aged composer Ann Hidden has traced her partner of many years, Thomas, to the house where he is conducting an affair with a younger woman. At the scene she meets, for the first time since their adolescence, an old school friend from her childhood in Brittany, Georges Roehl. She takes the decision to end her former life, and in the space of a few months she leaves her part-time job as a music editor, ends her relationship with Thomas, visits her mother (from whom she is estranged) in Brittany but is not reconciled to her, sells the house in Paris that she has shared with Thomas, and asks Georges to create a place where she can live and compose in the grounds of his house near Sens in Burgundy, and leads him to believe that she will live there. Georges is eager to re- establish a relationship with her, since he is mourning the death of his gay partner. However, once the sale of her Paris house has been finalised, she leaves without giving any indication of her destination, and after some travelling establishes herself on the Italian island of Ischia near Naples, eventually renting and renovating an old house on a headland. The house is called Villa Amalia and gives the book its name. While on Ischia she begins an affair with a doctor called Leonhardt Radnitzky, who has recently divorced and has part-time custody of his four-year-old daughter Magdalena (Lena). She spends much of her time swimming in the sea, and on one occasion becomes exhausted and is rescued by a couple in a yacht, Charles and his much younger partner Juliette (also known as Giulia). They are on the point of splitting up, and eventually Ann and Giulia form a profound relationship and live together in the Villa Amalia, and Lena lives with them when Leonhardt's work means that he cannot look after her. While Ann is out one day, and Giulia is asleep, Lena suffocates on a peanut. Giulia leaves and Ann's life disintegrates. Shortly afterwards, her mother dies; she returns to Brittany for the funeral, which is also attended by Thomas, by her father (a musician of Romanian Jewish origin, who left the family when she was a child) and by her school friend V√©ri, who has maintained contact between Ann and her mother. Ann refuses to be reconciled with Thomas, is rejected by her father, and quarrels with V√©ri. She returns to Burgundy and lives with Georges though they have no sexual relationship; at the end of the book he dies, with the implication that he has been suffering from AIDS though this is not stated. Style The style of the book reflects the bleakness of its plot. The writing is exceptionally sparse. The scene moves abruptly between different locations, and not all the shifts are represented in the summary above. Dialogue is typically brusque and characters take actions and either make no attempt to explain them or refuse to do so. The author himself renounced a career as a professional cellist and it may be assumed that both the experience of renunciation and his knowledge of the world of professional music played a part in the formation of the book.

The miniseries received very positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, it received a score of 80 out of 100 based on 27 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Entertainment Weekly gave the series an \\"A-\\" rating, and critic Ken Tucker remarked favorably on its avoidance of clich√©, self-consciousness, and agenda-driven storytelling, and praised its execution, nuance, and verisimilitude. Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote: \\"the seven-part Generation Kill is what you'd hope for from the people behind The Wire: an honest, barely adorned, sometimes painfully vivid representation of life as we live it now. It's journalism converted to art, with both benefiting\\". Austin Smith of the New York Post, however, was not as impressed; he described the series \\"as dull and throbbing as a severe headache\\". A red carpet screening of Generation Kill was held for U.S. Marines at Camp Pendleton in California, where the series was favorably received. On Rotten Tomatoes, the miniseries has an approval rating of 86% based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 9.1/10. The critical consensus reads, \\"Generation Kill plunges the viewer into war with a visceral force that's still somehow reined in by masterful storytelling and a strong command of period details.\\" References External links  Category:2008 television films Category:Iraq War in television Category:War television series Category:2000s American television miniseries Category:Television shows about the United States Marine Corps Category:HBO original programming Category:Television shows written by David Simon Category:Television series by All3Media Category:Television shows set in Iraq Category:American military television series ","title":"Generation Kill (miniseries)"},{"id":"14052264","text":"Steven F.

Welt in Waldoboro, Maine. It was part of William F. Palmer's fleet of white- hulled vessels active in the New England coal trade. The fleet was sold to J. S. Winslow and Company in 1911. After departing Rockport, Maine on Friday, June 13, 1913 under the command of Capt. Howard B. Allen and destined for Newport News, VA where she would pick up a load of coal for the return voyage, Paul Palmer caught fire on 15 June 1913 for unknown reasons. Attempts to douse the flames with the vessel's own pumps were not successful, and the crew abandoned ship. The Paul Palmer burned down to the waterline and then sank. There were 11 passengers and crew on board, including the captain's wife and a female guest. The passengers of the Palmer took to lifeboats and were picked up later on by the fishing schooner Rose Dorothea, bringing them to Provincetown, Massachusetts. The cutter Androscoggin was dispatched from Portland, Maine to destroy the remnants of the wreck so as to avoid a hazard to other ships. In 2000, researchers at the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary discovered the wreck and documented it, locating artifacts that proved the ship's identity in 2002. The wreck was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.

A major business figure of his era, Farrell expanded US Steel by a factor of five during his presidency, turning it into America's first billion-dollar company. Farrell was also a champion and early pioneer of export markets, who massively expanded US steel exports to the world with the help of the shipping subsidiary he founded, the Isthmian Steamship Company. Biography He was born in New Haven, Connecticut on February 15, 1863 to John Guy Farrell and Catherine Whalen. In 1889 he married Catherine McDermott of Brooklyn, New York and their children include: John J. Farrell, the chairman of the board of the American South African Line; Mrs. Joseph P. Murray; Mrs. Luke D. Stapelton; James Augustine Farrell Jr. the president of the American South African Line; and Mrs. Richard J. Buck. A classic example of the self-made man, Farrell rose from humble beginnings as a salesman with US Steel and Wire - US Steel's export division - to become the firm's manager by 1899. Under his leadership. US Steel and Wire massively expanded its exports to foreign markets from 200,000 tons per year to 1.5 million tons by 1903. The son of a ship's captain who was lost at sea, Farrell never lost his interest in maritime affairs and in 1910 established the Isthmian Steamship Company, a subsidiary of US Steel. Farrell believed that if US Steel exported using its own ships instead of leasing cargo space from other shipping companies, it could achieve substantial savings. His assessment proved correct and Isthmian became a highly lucrative subsidiary of the parent firm. =President of US Steel= Cognizant of his obvious talents, the board of US Steel appointed Farrell President of the company in 1911, a position he would be destined to hold for another 22 years until his retirement at the age of 70 in 1932. During his time at the helm, Farrell presided over a five-fold expansion of US Steel, turning it into America's first billion dollar company and the US steel industry's number one player by the mid-1920s. The scale of his achievement can be measured by the fact that in the 74 years since his retirement, US Steel has not significantly increased its share of the US steel industry. =Globalization prophet= Farrell was a pioneer of export markets and believed passionately in the importance of foreign trade. He was particularly keen on increasing trade with Asia. In a 1932 speech, Farrell said: > West of you lies the Orient with the teeming millions of hard-working > thrifty people, the great majority of whom, unfortunately are still existing > on a standard of life materially below that of some of their neighbors. It > is apt to be forgotten...when viewing the current cessation of trade, that > the Pacific area is perhaps the most rapidly developing market in the world. > Even during the decline of the past two years the interchange of goods > between the countries bordering on the Pacific has continued to increase in > volume, even though declining in value. All other trade areas have declined > in both volume and value. It is significant to note that this growth of > trade was not accompanied by a corresponding increase in population. It was, > however, accompanied by a striking development in communication and > transportation, the constant companions of commercial progress.Farrell > speech, History of Metropolitan Vancouver website. =Death= He died on March 28, 1943 in Manhattan, New York City. 1,500 people attended the funeral mass at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on March 30, 1943 in Manhattan. Other activities Farrell was the inaugural chairman of the National Foreign Trade Council, an institution he helped to set up and which he would continue to chair for many years. He also tried to promote interest in foreign trade by supporting institutions such as the School of Foreign Service. Farrell opposed trade unionism and refused to negotiate with unions in the 1919 steel industry strike.Extract from A Catholic Cold War: Edmund A.

Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division, 450 U.S. 707 (1981), was a caseThomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Sec. Div., . in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that Indiana's denial of unemployment compensation benefits to petitioner violated his First Amendment right to free exercise of religion, under Sherbert v. Verner (1963)..  Background  Thomas, a Jehovah's Witness, was initially hired to work in his employer's roll foundry, which fabricated sheet steel for a variety of industrial uses, but when the foundry was closed, he was transferred to a department that fabricated turrets for military tanks. Since all of the employer's remaining departments were engaged directly in the production of weapons, petitioner asked to be laid off. When that request was denied, he quit, asserting that his religious beliefs prevented him from participating in the production of weapons. He was denied unemployment compensation benefits under the Indiana Employment Security Act.  Prior history  At an administrative hearing, Thomas testified that he believed that contributing to the production of arms violated his religion, but he could, in good conscience, engage indirectly in the production of materials that might be used ultimately to fabricate arms. The hearing referee found that petitioner had terminated his employment because of his religious convictions but held that petitioner was not entitled to benefits because his voluntary termination was not based upon a \\"good cause [arising] in connection with [his] work,\\" as required by the Indiana statute. The Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division affirmed, but the Indiana Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Indiana statute, as applied, improperly burdened petitioner's right to the free exercise of his religion. The Indiana Supreme Court vacated on petitioner's free exercise right, the burden justified by legitimate state interests. Decision The majority held that Indiana's denial of unemployment compensation violated Thomas' right to free exercise of religion.

The Independent. www.theindependent.co.uk Published December 19, 2005. Accessed October 24, 2017. Bogart graduated from Brooklyn College in 1941, then became a U.S. Army Intelligence officer in World War II. After the war he engaged himself in the new communications sciences. During the 1960s, Bogart was among the first to analyze the declines in newspapers' readerships, television news viewerships, and radio news listenerships. He criticized the print media industry lack of marketing analysis to stop the trend. Author of more than a dozen books and hundreds of articles, Bogart was best known for scientific analysis on the editorial content of newspapers, magazines, and television and relating the results to readership and viewership. He wrote a column for Presstime Magazine for many years. He served as the executive vice president and general manager of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau; taught marketing at New York University, Columbia University and the Illinois Institute of Technology; and was a senior fellow at the Center for Media Studies at Columbia and a Fulbright research fellow in France. Bogart served as president of the American Association of Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) and also the World Association of Public Opinion Research (WAPOR). He was an advocate for journalists to understand the opinion polls better that the media use.Handle opinion polls the way you would any story: Do a credibility check At the time of his death in from babesiosis in 2005, Bogart was a director and senior consultant for Innovation, an international media consulting firm, and wrote a column for Presstime, the magazine of the Newspaper Association of America.  Controversies  In 1991, Bogart criticized German public opinion research and political advisor Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann, who had served as WAPOR president before him. He made her the center of controversy while she was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago, as he published \\"The Pollster and the Nazis\\" in the August 1991 issue of Jewish heritage and cultural magazine Commentary, accusing her of anti-Semitic passages in her dissertation and articles she wrote for Nazi newspapers. In fact, when young journalist and sociologist Elisabeth Noelle published her 1940 dissertation \\"Opinion and mass research in the USA\\" in Germany, having spent a year at the University of Missouri to research George Gallup's methodology, Goebbels called the 24-year-old woman as an adjutant and intended for her to build up, for the ministry of propaganda, Germany's first public opinion research organization. She declined, falling sick, and angering Goebbels; she later became a newspaper journalist with Nazi publications where she wrote some articles on Jewish influence over U.S. news and elite opinion. Bogart suggested there is a direct line from Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels to Noelle's theory of the \\"spiral of silence\\" and \\"public opinion as our social skin,\\" which interpreted the group pressure band-wagon effect and the domination of leading mass media over public opinion. The accused wrote a letter of apology to the magazine, explaining that the passages served alibi functions under the dictatorship and were not meant to be harmful.

The village of Vestbygd lies on the southwest side of the airport and the small village of Ore lies on the northeast side. The airport features a concrete runway aligned 14/32. Previously it also had a runway aligned 09/27. Farsund Airport, Lista is the civilian sector of the now closed Lista Air Station. Previously a regional airport, it is now only used for general aviation. The airbase was built by the Luftwaffe during the German occupation of Norway, opening in steps between 1941 and 1944. It was taken over by the Royal Norwegian Air Force from 1945. Civilian operations originally commenced in 1955 when Braathens SAFE started services with their de Havilland Heron. Nordsj√∏fly and its successor Norving flew from 1980 to 1988. The air station was closed in 1996 and the aerodrome privatized. Air Stord operated flights from 1996 to 1999 and since there have been no scheduled services. History Construction of Lista Air Station began was started by Luftwaffe in September 1940. It was part of a major investment in defenses built in Lista, known as Lista Fortress and was part of the Atlantic Wall.Ettrup: 64 The base opened in April 1941, consisting of a wooden runway.Ettrup: 65 The second phase of construction was completed in 1944 and resulted in an array of support infrastructure and a concrete runway.Ettrup: 66 Three of the hangars from the Second World War still stand The airport was taken over by the Royal Norwegian Air Force in November 1945. It was initially proposed closed, but in 1948 it was decided that the facility should be reopened. Lista never received any permanent stationing of squadrons, instead supporting various training schools and missions. From 1951 to 1953 and important part of the air station was the shooting field Marka. Between 1955 and 1959 the base underwent a major redevelopment. Through funding from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), List was designated a full-scale reserve base. This involved the construction of a new, runway and taxiway and stands for two squadrons of fighter jets, each in a designated area.Arheim: 227 Braathens SAFE was the first airline to operate out of Farsund Airport, Lista. Starting on 6 June 1955, Braathens SAFE started landing some of the Oslo‚ÄìStavanger planes at Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik and Farsund Airport, Lista. The route, nicknamed the \\"Milk Route\\", operated Stavanger ‚Äì Farsund ‚Äì Kristiansand ‚Äì T√∏nsberg ‚Äì Oslo in the morning, with a return in the evening. It was flown using the de Havilland Heron.Tjomsland & Wilsberg: 106 Braathens terminated its services on 15 May 1959 when the Herons were retired. The airport did not generate sufficient patronage to support the larger successor aircraft, the Fokker F27 Friendship.Tjomsland & Wilsberg: 118 Braathens resumed services during the 1960s, later using the Fokker F28 Fellowship. The twice-daily stopover on a Stavanger to Oslo flight was loss- bringing for Braathens, but part of their concession which secured them a monopoly on several profitable domestic services. For a period in 1977 the services were terminated when there was no fire-fighting service available at the airport. Braathens wet leased some flights from Busy Bee using a Short Skyvan, as the F28s were often too large for the services to Stavanger. The Ministry of Transport and Communications gave Braathens permission to withdraw from the Lista service at the end of the summer schedule of 1980, which the airline did.Tjomsland & Wilsberg: 272 Hangar and redeveloped building With Braathens' withdrawal, both Nordsj√∏fly and Norving skirmished to apply for a concession. Nordsj√∏fly was awarded the privilege.Melling: 171 Norving bought Nordsj√∏fly in 1982 and incorporated it into its operations, taking over the Farsund route.Melling: 181 Busy Bee and Norving applied to operate services from Stavanger to Sandefjord Airport, Torp and Skien Airport, Geiteryggen, respectively. Both were granted their requests, on the condition they make a stop-over at Lista. Busy Bee protested by not starting the route, while Norving started flying in May 1983 with a Cessna Conquest.Melling: 200 The route was terminated in February 1988 when Norving pulled out of all scheduled services in Southern Norway.Melling: 289 Due to the restructuring of the military in the 1990s, Parliament voted on 8 June 1994 to close Lista Air Station. Effective from 1 June 1996, the military was set to retain ownership of the facility for ten years.Hjelmeland Parliament granted the Defence Estates Agency the right to sell the air station for market price as part of a large-scale sale of defunct military estates. The condition was that any other state or public uses be given priority and that the sale take place through an open sales process.Office of the Auditor General of Norway: 3 Lista Airport Development was established on 16 September 1994 and it established Lista Lufthavn on 3 May 1996. In June 1996 the Defence Estates Agency signed a ten- year lease on the entire air station with the latter company for an annual rent of 10,000 Norwegian krone per year. The agency retained the responsibility to maintain the property. Lista Lufthavn received an option for the company to buy the entire facility for NOK 25 million.Office of the Auditor General of Norway: 2 Ugland Air aircraft at Lista in 1997 Air Stord commenced scheduled services twice a day from Lista to Oslo and Stavanger from 24 June. Initially they used a ten-passenger Beechcraft King Air 200, later increasing to a nineteen-passenger Beechcraft 19. This was secured through two local shipping companies and the municipalities buying a significant portion of the airline. The Stavanger route was later cut. Air Stord's Oslo-route was terminated on 20 February 1999 when the company filed for bankruptcy. In 1999 the agency were in talks with Farsund Municipality, but stipulated a sales price of NOK 200 million. The municipality therefore withdrew their interest.Office of the Auditor General of Norway: 5 The agency sold the air station to Lista Flypark. They took over ownership on 9 December 2002. The air station was valuated at NOK 11 million, yet sold for NOK 3.5 million. There was no documentation for why this discount was given. Both Lista Lufthavn and Lista Flypark's contracts were such structured that they had incentives to delay any commercial development of the property. The sale was carried out without public announcement. Eight sections were also sold between 1998 and 2003 without announcement.Office of the Auditor General of Norway: 4 Avinor asked to take over the control tower and the Directorate for Nature Management asked to take over Slevdalsvannet, but both of these requests were ignored. All in all the military spent NOK 53 million on the process of selling the property. Subtracted the sales price, this was what the military spend on operating the base after closure, maintaining it and in various discounts to purchasers for them to fix up the base after the sale took place. The scandal resulted in Parliament changing the sales procedures so that they had to be approved of by the government. Lista Lufthavn signed an agreement with CHC Helikopter Service to use Lista as a reserve airport should Sola become unavailable. There was limited use of the airport and CHC terminated the agreement in March 2007.Ettrup: 68 However, this status allowed the aerodrome flight information service (AFIS) service to be retained. This was closed on 1 September 2007.Gustavsen: 2 Slevdalsvannet Nature Reserve was established in 2005 and in 2014 three small lakes were artificially recreated. The site was bought by the Ministry of the Environment in 2013. Lista Air Show, presenting veteran military aircraft, was organized annual three times from 2009 through 2011, drawing up to 4,000 spectators. Lista Flyklubb was founded on 3 May 2010 and is based at the airport with two aircraft. The summer camp and skating park Flipside opened in a former hangar in 2013. It has a capacity for 1000 children and youth throughout the summer. Facilities The interior of one of the hangars, since redeveloped to a skating park Farsund Airport, Lista is situated on the flat section of the Lista peninsula in Farsund, Norway. It is situated between the villages of Vanse and Vestbygd,Gustafsen: 15 and from Farsund.Hjelmeland: 40 The airport lacks a manned control tower and services are limited to visual flight rules in daylight with a maximum take-off weight of and a maximum nine passengers.Gustafsen: 14 The airport has a reference elevation of above mean sea level. It consists of one operative and one closed concrete runway. The main runway measures and is aligned 14/32. Parallel to this runs a concrete taxiway. There is a closed runway long which is aligned 09/27. Most of the base has been listed as a cultural heritage. This includes the runways, the taxiway and the road network, the remaining buildings from the Second World War and Marka. An important aspect when listing was that many of the structures had not been modified since the war.Hjelmeland: 43 Slevdalsvannet Nature Reserve is situated southwest of the runway. A former lake, it has since been drained. It remains an important wetland area for migratory birds and is part of a Ramsar site. Airlines and destinations Lista has a primary catchment area covering Lister, the traditional district covering the western-most parts of Agder county, and a population of 35,000. This includes the towns of Farsund, Lyngdal and Flekkefjord. Lista is situated 80 minutes drive from Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik. For international flights, people living in Lister often instead use Stavanger Airport, Sola. The proximity to Kjevik has therefore severely limited the demand for an airport in Farsund. Farsund Airport's main advantage is the long runway. This allows for large cargo aircraft and the occasional charter flight with large passenger aircraft. Lista can also be used in case of a closing of Kjevik. However, these uses occur only sporadically. There were also plans to use the airport for offshore helicopter transport to oil platforms in the North Sea. However, the lack of infrastructure, lack of a freeway to Kristiansand and lack of scheduled flights caused these plans to be terminated. Kjevik has also received a similar airport competitor to the east, Arendal Airport, Gullknapp. Avinor, the state-owned operator of Kjevik, has stated that both Lista and Gullknapp, should then become operative with scheduled flights, would take away patronage from Kjevik and critical mass to establish new routes from Agder. On the contrary, some have called for the closing of Kjevik and instead that Agder be served by Lista and Gullknapp. References Bibliography   * Category:Airports in Agder Category:Farsund Category:1955 establishments in Norway Category:Airports established in 1955 ","title":"Farsund Airport, Lista"},{"id":"14052612","text":"Rainer K√ºchl is an Austrian violinist who was born in Waidhofen an der Ybbs, Austria, in August 1950.

The stations then broadcast the Real Country satellite classic country format from ABC Radio, and added WBGK at 99.7FM in 2001.http://www.fccinfo.com/CMDProEngine.php?sCurrentService=FM&tabSearchType;=Appl&sAppIDNumber;=554593 WLFH was later acquired by Clear Channel Communications and left Bug Country to join the \\"Sports Stars\\" network of WADR/WUTQ and WRNY. In 2004, WBUG left Bug Country to become talk-formatted WVTL, leaving WBGK and WBUG-FM as the only two stations in the Bug Country network. In November 2009, WBGK and WBUG- FM dropped Real Country and swapped it with a continuous automated selection of country Christmas music. After the holidays, their current format of mainstream country was launched and the station returned to local production. WBGK had been providing live play-by-play high school football games but that ended in 2011. On March 30, 2015, Roser Communications moved the studios of all their stations, including WBGK/WBUG-FM, to new facilities located at the Canal Park off Leland Avenue. Prior to this, Roser Communications had been leasing space at the Adirondack Bank building on Genesee Street.

It features a concrete runway aligned 14/32, and a runway aligned 09/27. The facility was shared with Farsund Airport, Lista, which remains in operation. The airbase was built by Luftwaffe between 1941 and 1944, during the German occupation of Norway. Throughout the Second World War it was predominantly used for fighter aircraft and served as part of the Atlantic Wall. Most of the buildings at the station date from this period. It was taken over by the Royal Norwegian Air Force in 1946. It was at first closed and then reopened, originally serving a weapon-technical school and a shooting and bombing school. The latter utilized the shooting area at Marka. Lista received North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) funding for a runway extension, which was built between 1955 and 1959. Lista was designated a reserve airbase throughout the Cold War. The RNoAF's recruit school was located at Lista from 1963 to 1984. Thereafter it was mostly used for conferences. Lista Air Station was closed on 6 June 1996. The sale of the base, in which the military paid to the new owners to buy the property, resulted in a series of investigations and a change to the way the military sold properties. History =Establishment= The Norwegian Armed Forces never considered the suitability of Lista as an air base prior to the Second World War, despite its natural suitability in a flat, open landscape.Arheim: 227 The German occupation of Norway started on 9 April 1940 as part of Operation Weser√ºbung.Ettrup: 12 Lista was initially not prioritized by the Wehrmacht. The first landing of fifteen troops took place on 24 April, in an action to secure Lista Lighthouse.Ettrup: 16 Nordberg Fort was located just north of the aerodrome Lista was regarded as crucial to secure the safe transport of convoys along the coast. By 22 May 60 men had been stationed in Farsund. The first work on establishing defenses in Lista commenced later in the summer by the Kriegsmarine in what would later develop into Nordberg Fort and part of the Atlantic Wall. Guns were installed by October, making the coastal artillery operative. The Luftwaffe's took control over Kjevik Air Station and Sola Air Station upon the occupation. They quickly assessed that there would be need for an additional airfield located between Kristiansand and Stavanger. Work therefore commenced on building Mandal Airport, which was completed in August 1940. By then Lista had been assessed as a more suitable location. Planning started in August and surveying was completed by the end of the month. The work was carried out by German personnel through Luftwaffe Bau- Batalionen and German contractors who hired Norwegian workers.Ettrup: 64 Construction began on 2 September.Hjelmeland: 42 The runway was built in the area around Lang√•ker and Stave. After leveling, a runway was built with prefabricated wooden elements. It measured and westwards it reached the beach at Verev√•gen. It was at the time the longest wooden runway in Norway. The runway was completed in April 1941, allowing the first aircraft to land. Mandal Airport was closed and the aircraft transferred to Lista.Ettrup: 65 The first anti-aircraft defenses arrived on 27 December 1940, originally placing 88 mm guns at V√•gsvold, Lista Lighthouse and at Stave. Four more positions were established in 1941. This was reorganized in 1943, when some of the units were moved out of Lista.Ettrup: 97 The officer's mess hall Next work started on the main part of the air station. Contracted to Ed Zublin, the first part of the work was to drain the vast mires located throughout the peninsula. The terraforming proved difficult and work ran gradually for three years. Several smaller hills were demolished and moved to fill up where necessary. The landscape was dug out to create a series of drainage passages. The work resulted in a concrete runway, in addition to of taxiways and associated hangars, barracks and other buildings.Ettrup: 66 The work employed more than 10,000 Norwegian workers and several thousand Eastern Europeans. An industrial railway, the Lunde Line, was completed in April 1943. Two W√ºrzburg radars and a Freya radar were installed at Lista from May 1943, along with one at Flekker√∏y.Ettrup: 87 Meanwhile, a bearing station and jamming station were also installed.Ettrup: 89 =Luftwaffe operations= Lista Air Station was primarily used by fighter aircraft throughout the Second World War. Its main task was to provide support for the North Sea and Skagerrak areas along the coastline. The squadrons and aircraft stationed and dispatched to Lista varied over time, and often Lista was one of several airbases in Southern Norway used by a division at any given time.Ettrup: 82 Hangar The 2nd Group of Jagdgeschwader 77 (2./JG 77) was the first unit based at Lista, from March 1941. It became 2./JG 5 in January 1942. Lista was one of several bases used by the ad hoc Jagdgruppe Losigkeit to escort the German cruisers Prinz Eugen and Admiral Scheer along the coast in February. From August 1942 to March 1943 Lista was regularly used by 8./JG1, operating Messerschmitt Bf 109F and Focke- Wulf Fw 190A. From August to October 1943 the base was used for 10./JG11 to escort convoys along Skagerrak using the Bf 109T. From October the base was used by a detachment of Seenotgruppe 5 using Dornier Do 24 seaplanes. From November 1943 to June 1944 Lista was the base of 11./JG 11 with Bf 109T. They were replaced in June with 10./JG 5 Messerschmitt Bf 110G and Nachtjagdstaffel Norwegian with Junkers Ju 88G and Messerschmitt Bf 110G, who remained until March 1945. These were sometimes supplemented with Zerst√∂rergeschwader 26, also with Bf 100G. 13./JG 5 and 15./JG 5 and their Bf 109Gs were moved to Lista in November 1944. Luftflotte 1/120 used Lista for its Junkers Ju 88D and Junkers Ju 188F reconnaissance duties from December.Ettrup: 83 =Royal Norwegian Air Force operations= Lista Air Station remained under German control until Royal Air Force troops arrived on 22 May 1945. The RAF retained control of the facility in November 1945, when it was transferred to the Royal Norwegian Air Force.Ettrup: 68 During the RAF period their troops cleaned up the site, including minesweeping and destruction of ammunition and aircraft. Three hangars form the Second World War remain today The Norwegian military had no use for the entire encampment and defensive structures, and therefore most of the area was quickly returned to civilian use. However, the air station itself was of interest to the air force and was kept as a military installation. In December 1946 the military concluded that there was no need for the aerodrome and started the process of closing the facility. The wooden runway was dismantled and given as building supplies to the local population. Most of buildings were dismantled and moved elsewhere. The concrete runway was kept as an emergency airfield for civilian aircraft. Two of the major hangars burned down in 1947. The air force concluded in 1948 that it needed to upgrade eight of the rudimentary bases which they had abandoned after the end of the war, including Lista. This was part of a strategy to spread out the squadrons in more locations.Arheim: 50 In particular, Lista was selected as a suitable site for parts of the air force's schools. This consisted of a shooting- and bombing school and a weapon-technical school. The latter opened in 1948 and the former the following year. They used existing German barracks for their quarters and two hangars for their classrooms. The artillery range Marka was designated as part of the reopening, which was used both by the artillery and by the air force. It was commissioned on 1 March 1951. The artillery range was found to be unsuitable and instead the sand dunes of J√¶ren were preferred. The shooting- and bombing school was therefore moved to Sola in 1953.Arheim: 240 A former RNoAF building Between 1955 and 1959 the base underwent a major redevelopment. Through funding from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), List was designated a full-scale reserve base. This involved the construction of a new, runway and taxiway and stands for two squadrons of fighter jets, each in a designated area. An anti-aircraft defense was established as part of the runway extension, manned by reserves and equipped with a Bofors 40 mm gun. The reserve status was never removed and the base was never home to any squadrons. The air force's recruit school was moved to Lista in 1963, replacing the weapon-technical school, which moved to Kjevik. The latter was gradually closed down between 1982 and 1984 and moved to Gardermoen Air Station. However, due to the then large amount of new buildings at the station, it was used for courses and conferences within the military. It peaked at 12,000 guest-days. From 1988 to 1993 the Air Force's fire protection assistants were trained at Lista. This consisted of five courses per year, each of 25 to 30 pupils.Arheim: 228 Hangar and redeveloped building As part of the Oslo Airport location controversy, a 1988 report proposed that Lista be upgraded as an active air station, should Gardermoen be chosen as the new main airport. However, these plans were rejected by the Chief of Defence. Instead the base was upgraded to take in recruits for the Home Guard. Lista was upgraded Four new quarters were built, along with upgrades to the canteens, kitchens, storage facilities and classrooms. From 1990 it had a capacity for 232 recruits at a time, training them for six months before transferring them to reserve service in the Home Guard. =Closing= Due to the restructuring of the military in the 1990s, Parliament voted on 8 June 1994 to close Lista Air Station. Effective from 1 June 1996, the military was set to retain ownership of the facility for ten years. Parliament granted the Defence Estates Agency the right to sell the air station for market price as part of a large-scale sale of defunct military estates. The condition was that any other state or public uses be given priority and that the sale take place through an open sales process.Office of the Auditor General of Norway: 3 In June 1996 the Defence Estates Agency signed a ten-year lease on the entire air station with the latter company for an annual rent of 10,000 Norwegian krone per year. The agency retained the responsibility to maintain the property. Lista Lufthavn received an option for the company to buy the entire facility for NOK 25 million.Office of the Auditor General of Norway: 2 In 1999 the agency were in talks with Farsund Municipality, but stipulated a sales price of NOK 200 million. The municipality therefore withdrew their interest.Office of the Auditor General of Norway: 5 The agency sold the air station to Lista Flypark. They took over ownership on 9 December 2002. Military building since redeveloped to civilian use The air station was valuated at NOK 11 million, yet sold for NOK 3.5 million. There was no documentation for why this discount was given. Both Lista Lufthavn and Lista Flypark's contracts were so structured that they had incentives to delay any commercial development of the property. The sale was carried out without public announcement. Eight sections were also sold between 1998 and 2003 without announcement.Office of the Auditor General of Norway: 4 Avinor asked to take over the control tower and the Directorate for Nature Management asked to take over Slevdalsvannet, but both of these requests were ignored. All in all the military spent NOK 53 million on the process of selling the property. Subtracted the sales price, this was what the military spend on operating the base after closure, maintaining it and in various discounts to purchasers for them to fix up the base after the sale took place. The scandal resulted in Parliament changing the sales procedures so that they had to be approved of by the government. The Defence Estates Agency retrospectively admitted their mistake and restructured their processes and organization to better handle sales and avoid future scandals. Most of the base has been listed as a cultural heritage. This includes the runways, the taxiway and the road network, the remaining buildings from the Second World War and Marka. An important aspect when listing was that many of the structures had not been modified since the war.Hjelmeland: 43 Slevdalsvannet Nature Reserve is situated southwest of the runway. A former lake, it has since been drained. It remains an important wetland area for migratory birds and is part of a Ramsar site. The nature reserve was established in 2005 and in 2014 three small lakes were artificially recreated. The site was bought by the Ministry of the Environment in 2013. Facilities Farsund Airport, Lista is situated on the flat section of the Lista peninsula in Farsund, Norway. It is situated between the villages of Vanse and Vestbygd, and from Farsund.Hjelmeland: 40 The aerodrome has a reference elevation of above mean sea level.Gustafsen: 15 =Second World War= The interior of one of the hangars, since redeveloped to a skating park During the Luftwaffe period the airport was gradually built out, changing character over time. The main runway was concrete and measured , aligned 09/27. It was connected via a network of taxiways which measured a total . Their width was . The runway was thick, while the taxiways were thick. A further of taxiways were made of shingle. Aircraft stands were covered in shingle and wood. Around the airport there were twenty small protective hangars. In the western part of the aerodrome was a wooden runway. Most of the buildings at Lista Air Station were built during the Second World War. They were modernized by the RNoAF, but retained their original structure. Most of the buildings were of standard German design and were found both at other Norwegian and other Luftwaffe airports from the era.Ettrup: 259 The operative headquarters were located at the eastern end of the wooden runway.Ettrup: 77 Most of the buildings were located on the west side of the main runway. The facilities included offices, quarters, mess halls, storage buildings, a cinema and storage areas.Hjelmeland: 40 The most elaborate building is the officer's mess, which remains today as a listed building. The two-story building features a roofed colonnade, a hipped roof and cob-worked log walls.Hjelmeland: 41 The entire base consisted of about 300 buildings. The airbase and surrounding area were connected by a narrow-gauge railway, the Lunde Line. Remaining barracks The location of the anti-aircraft defenses varied throughout the Second World War. Flak positions were at various times situated at V√•gsvold, Dyngvold, Tj√∏vrenes, Lista Lighthouse, Venneim, Steinodden, Torp, √òstre Hauge, Tj√∏rveneset, Stave and Farsund. These were predominantly 8.8 cm guns, supplemented with 3.7 cm guns and 2.0 cm guns. The various flak positions were built with bunkers serving as quarters and support. The site had a radar complex named \\"Wolf\\" situated in Marka. It consisted of two W√ºrzburg radars, one Freya radar and a Wassermann radar, situated on the site of Farsund Radio. A second Wassermann radar was located at Grimsby. These were used both for detection and to aid fighters during night operations. Communications with fighters took place by a transmitter at Vere, which had a range of .Ettrup: 88 The site also featured a bearing station and a jamming station. =Cold War= Following the NATO expansion in the late 1950s, a new concrete runway was built, aligned 14/32. Parallel to this runs a concrete taxiway. This is a rebuilding and extension of the former wooden runway. The German concrete runway was kept, although relegated to serve as a secondary runway. The shooting field of Marka was located southeast of the aerodrome. It features twenty-four bunkers, including a commando bunker from the Second World War. The facilities which have remained since the war and were still used at the end of the air station's operation were the hangars, the officer's mess hall and Mark. Three of the six main hangars have survived. These were standard German types. The one consisted of a lean-to roof supported by a truss. The other two had a semicircular arch roof. Both were built with wooden walls and roofs. Civilian sector Air Stord Dornier Do 328 at Lista in 1996 Given the readiness of the infrastructure, Lista was selected as a suitable location for a civilian airport. Prior to the privatization the civilian operations were limited, typically with two trips each day to Oslo Airport, Fornebu and Stavanger Airport, Sola, and operations were carried out by the air force. Braathens SAFE started flights on 6 June 1955.Tjomsland & Wilsberg: 106 With a few periods without services, they retained flights until 1980.Tjomsland & Wilsberg: 272 Nordsj√∏fly,Melling: 171 and its successor Norving, took over the routes,Melling: 200 which lasted until February 1988.Melling: 289 After the privatization, Air Stord operated services from 1996 to 1999. An aerodrome flight information service was retained until 2007, although the airport saw very limited use. The main client was CHC Helikopter Service, who used it as a reserve base for flights to the North Sea. The main challenge for Farsund Airport has been the proximity to Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik and the limited catchment area which only covers Lister.

Hanfried Lenz was the eldest son of Fritz Lenz an influential German geneticist, who is associated with Eugenics and hence also with the Nazi racial policies during the Third Reich. He started to study mathematics and physics at the University of T√ºbingen, but interrupted his studies from 1935-37 to do his military service. After that he continued to study in Munich, Berlin and Leipzig. In 1939 when World War II broke out in Europe, he became a soldier in the western front and during a vacation he passed the exams for his teacher certification. He married Helene Ranke in 1943 and 1943-45 he worked on radar technology in a laboratory near Berlin. After World War II Hanfried Lenz was classified as a \\"follower\\" by the denazification process. He started to work as a math and physics teacher in Munich and in 1949 he became an assistant at the Technical University of Munich. He received his PhD in 1951 and his Habilitation in 1953. He worked as a lecturer until he became an associate professor in 1959. In 1969 he finally became a full professor at the Free University of Berlin and worked there until his retirement in 1984. He was also politically active and in connection with his opposition to the rebuilding of the German army in the early 50s, he became a member of the Social Democratic Party(SPD) in 1954. Later, partially due to being alienated by the student movement of the '60s, his leanings became more conservative again and in 1972 he left the SPD to join the Christian Democratic Union. Hanfried Lenz is known for his work on the classification of projective planes and in 1954 he showed how one can introduce affine spaces axiomatically without constructing them from projective spaces or vector spaces. This result is now known as the theorem of Lenz. During his later years he also worked in the area of combinatorics and published a book on design theory (together with Dieter Jungnickel and Thomas Beth). In 1995 the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications awarded the Euler Medal to Hanfried Lenz. References *Christoph Kaiser: Lernen hei√üt irren d√ºrfem.

The Maesteg Harlequins were founded in 1899, their first captain being Tom Hopkins. They have reformed under different guises but for the majority of their 113 years they have been known as Maesteg Harlequins. The club is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union having been made full members in 1987. Club badge The club badge consists of a central shield surrounded by an elaborate gold border. The shield contains the traditional image of Maesteg a burning castle (Castell Coch which was sited in the nearby village of Llangynwyd and home to the ruling earls of the area). The burning castle shows the historical rejection of Norman rule by local Welsh people. Above the castle is the traditional emblem of Wales a red dragon rampant.

U 161. U 336. Ulf of Borresta (Old Norse: Ulfr √≠ B√°rist√∂√∞um, modern Swedish: Ulf i Borresta) was a runemaster in the eleventh century Uppland, Sweden, and a successful Viking who returned from England three times with a share of the Danegeld. He is named after his estate which in modern Swedish is called Borresta or B√•rresta (Old Norse: B√°rista√∞irRundata or B√°rasta√∞i ÄNordisk runnamslexikon by Lena Peterson at the Swedish Institute for Linguistics and Heritage (Institutet f√∂r spr√•k och folkminnen).). Ulf's clan Ulf belonged to a clan in what is today the parish of Orkesta, located in present-day Vallentuna Municipality, and he was the paternal nephew and successor of a man named √ìn√¶mr,Pritsak 1981:389 a name which means \\"slow learner\\". √ìn√¶mr is mentioned on several runestones, U 112, U 336 and probably U 328 (which is an example of the Ringerike style.Fuglesang, S.H. Swedish runestones of the eleventh century: ornament and dating, Runeninschriften als Quellen interdisziplin√§rer Forschung (K.D√ºwel ed.). G√∂ttingen 1998, pp. 197-218. p. 202). The name of Gu√∞laug's father on U 328 is interpreted as √ìn√¶mr, and Gu√∞laug had a son named Holmi who fell in Italy which is mentioned on the runestone U 133.Pritsak 1981:392 Another cousin of Ulf named Ragnvaldr was the commander of the Varangian Guard in Constantinople and made the runestone U 112 in memory of himself and his mother, √ìn√¶mr's daughter. Runestones made by Ulf Ulf made the runestone U 328 and also the runestone U 336 in memory of his uncle √ìn√¶mr which today is raised at the church of Orkesta. He also made the runestones U 160 and 161 for his kinsmen-by-marriage in Sk√•lhammar (Old Norse: Skulhamarr). Runestones in Ulf's memory There were seven runestones (runestone U 344 and runestone U 343) which were raised in Ulf's memory and they were raised together as a monument at Ytterg√§rde. U 343 has disappeared but U 344 is now raised at the church of Orkesta. The runestone U 344, in the style Pr3, was found in 1868, at Ytterg√§rde, by Richard Dybeck.Enoksen 1998:122 It can be dated to the first half of the 11th century because of its use of the ansuz rune for the a and √¶ phomenes, and because of its lack of dotted runes.Enoksen 1998:124 This stone is notable because it commemorates that Ulf had taken three danegelds in England. The first one was with Skagul Toste in 991,Pritsak 1981:392 the second one with Thorkel the High in 1012 and the last one with Canute the Great in 1018. Since there were many years between the danegelds, it is likely that Ulfr returned to Sweden after each danegeld to live as a wealthy magnate.Enoksen 1998:125 It is a remarkable feat in itself to summarize Ulf's adventurous life in so few unsentimental words.Jansson 1980:36 The runestone U 343 reports Ulf's death and it was raised in his memory by his sons Karsi and Karlbj√∂rn.Jansson 1980:36 References Other sources *Enoksen, Lars Magnar.

The United Artists release was filmed at the Cinecitt√† Studios in Rome. It served as the basis for the unsuccessful 1979 stage musical Carmelina. Some critics have also speculated that the 1999 stage musical Mamma Mia!‚Äîand, by extension, its 2008 film adaptation‚Äîare based on Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell, although the musical's book writer, Catherine Johnson, has denied any connection. Plot  Carla \\"Campbell\\" (Gina Lollobrigida) is an Italian woman who‚Äîduring the American occupation of Italy‚Äîslept with three American GIs in the course of 10 days, Cpl. Phil Newman (Phil Silvers), Lt. Justin Young (Peter Lawford), and Sgt. Walter Braddock (Telly Savalas). By the time she discovers she is pregnant, all three have moved on, and she, uncertain of which is the father, convinces each of the three (who are unaware of the existence of the other two) to support \\"his\\" daughter Gia financially. To protect her reputation, as well as the reputation of her unborn child, Carla has raised the girl to believe her mother is the widow of a non-existent army captain named Eddie Campbell, a name she borrowed from a can of soup (otherwise he would have been Captain Coca-Cola, the only other term she knew in English at the time). The film opens 20 years after the end of World War II in the village of San Forino, where the three ex-airmen attend a unit-wide reunion of the 293rd Squadron of the 15th Air Force in the village where they were stationed. The men are accompanied by their wives, and in the Newmans' case, three obnoxious children. Carla is forced into a series of comic situations as she tries to keep them‚Äîeach one anxious to meet his daughter Gia (Janet Margolin) for the first time‚Äîfrom discovering her secret while at the same time trying to keep Gia from running off to Paris to be with a much older married man who will take her to Brazil. When confronted, Mrs. Campbell admits she does not know which of the three men is Gia's father. She challenges the men by asking them what kind of father each would have been, particularly because they have never been there for all the small but important life events of their daughter. Provoked by this, the potential fathers talk to Gia and insist that she cannot run off. The \\"fathers\\" cease the support payments, and the Braddocks, who cannot have children of their own, agree to have Gia stay with them while she studies in the U.S. Cast  * Gina Lollobrigida as mother Carla Campbell ** Janet Margolin as daughter Gia Campbell ** Philippe Leroy as mother's boyfriend Vittorio ** Naomi Stevens as housekeeper Rosa * Phil Silvers as American Cpl.

CPT first designed, manufactured, and marketed the CPT 4200, a dual-cassette-tape machine that controlled a modified IBM Selectric typewriter to support text editing and word processing. The CPT 4200 was followed in 1976 by the CPT VM (Visual Memory), a partial-page display-screen dual-cassette-tape unit, and shortly thereafter by the CPT 8000, a full-page display dual-diskette desktop microcomputer that drove stand-alone daisy wheel printers. Subsequent products included (1) variants on the 8000 series; (2) the CPT 6000 series, which had a lower capacity, smaller screen, and was less expensive; (3) the CPT 9000 series, which had a larger capacity and could run IBM personal computer software; (4) the CPT Phoenix series, which had a graphical capabilities; (5) CPT PT, a software-only reduced version that ran on IBM personal computers and clones; and (6) other related products. The CPT logooriginally three letters chosen to sound well togetherbegan to be taken as an acronym for \\"cassette powered typewriting,\\" and subsequently for \\"computer processed text,\\" and numerous other variants. Major competition was IBM, Wang, Lanier, Xerox, and other word processing vendors. CPT Corporation was fifth in size among Minnesota-based top high-tech companies, after 3M, Honeywell, Control Data, and Medtronic. Corporate revenues grew to approximately a quarter-billion dollars per year in the mid-1980s, then declined with the proliferation of personal computers. CPT ultimately ceased major manufacturing late in the 20th century. Selected products =Cassette based= The CPT 4200 was a dual- cassette-tape unit with a small built-in keyboard that controlled a modified IBM Selectric typewriter. Keystrokes entered on the typewriter appeared on the paper as they were recorded on the output cassette, which formed a magnetic replica of the characters printed on the page. That output cassette could later be used as an input cassette, where it would be played back to the typewriter along with new keystrokes to accomplish text editing. The keyboard of the CPT 4200 had action keys for \\"skip\\", \\"read\\" and \\"stop\\", mode keys for \\"word\\", \\"line\\", \\"paragraph,\\" and \\"page.\\" Pressing \\"read\\" transferred a word, line, paragraph, or page (depending on which mode key had been selected) from the input tape to both the typewriter and the output tape. Line boundaries (aka printer margins) recorded on the input tape were ignored or retained depending on whether or not the \\"adjust\\" key had been selected. Alternatively, pressing \\"skip\\" moved past the corresponding amount of text on the input tape without sending it to the typewriter or to the output tape. The Selectric's keyboard was active for any new typing, which would appear on the paper and transferred to the output tape. Thus a document was edited by reading back those parts of the text to be retained and skipping those parts to be discarded, with new typing added from the Selectric's keyboard. Price: approx. $5000, 1980-era values. The CPT Communicator was an add-on to the CPT 4200 that allowed data to be transferred from one text-editing machine to another, or between a text-editing machine and a remote computer, via phone lines. Price: not available. =Microprocessor based= CPT 8000 series The CPT 8000 was the company's first microcomputer product, exhibited in spring of 1976. It was a self-contained desktop machine with two 8 inch floppy diskette drives, a movable keyboard, and a full-page vertically oriented CRT display with black characters on a white background, for a view of text on paper. It was promoted as familiar and easy to use for those experienced with typewriters. The CPT 8000 had dual-window editing, where text was assembled in an upper window from text entered at the keyboard or from one or more files brought successively into the lower window. Words, lines, paragraphs, and pages could be slid from the lower window to the upper, as in the cassette tapes of the CPT 4200, or they could be deleted from the lower window. In addition the two screens could lock and scroll up or down together. The machine used two processors, an 8080 microprocessor and a custom display processor. 65,536 bytes of main memory were standard and were used jointly by both processors for executable code, program data, and video memory. Price: approx. $15,000, 1980-era values. An RS-232 serial communication option was available for the 8000 series that allowed the electronic transfer of documents. CPT Phoenix series The CPT Phoenix had a separate adjustable display, a separate curved keyboard promoted as ergonomically comfortable, and circuitry in a separate box. It included a custom bit-block- transfer (BitBlt) graphics processing unit (GPU) together with a dual-CPU multiprocessor. Eight of the keys on the keyboard were \\"soft keys\\" whose meaning changed with the operation being performed and whose current definitions were maintained at the bottom of the display screen. Price: approx. same as CPT 8000. =Storage Systems= CPT WordPak The CPT WordPak series was CPT's first external document storage system that enabled multiple 8000 series workstations to store documents in an electronic filing cabinet. Prior to WordPak, all documents were stored on removable 8 inch floppy diskettes. Sharing documents involved handing off the original disk, or copying the document to a second disk and 'sneaker-net-ing' (walking it over) to the second 8000. But this resulted in two copies of the document, one at each workstation. A circuit card with the proprietary cable connector was installed in the 8000 series workstations and connected to the WordPak by a multi-conductor cable. (This was before the Ethernet standard was developed.) WordPak 1 consisted of a single Shugart Associates 14\\" diameter hard disk drive with a capacity of 5 megabytes. WordPak 2 added a 2nd drive for a total of 10 megabytes. WordPak was designed to support the 8000 series 'fixed font pitch' documents, which did not support imbedded graphics. It was the forerunner of the SRS product. CPT SRS The CPT SRS was a \\"shared resource system\\" consisting of a 35-million-byte hard disk drive that would be shared simultaneously by up to eight CPT word processing machines. At that time photographs and videos were not commonly stored digitally and a disk drive of that size could hold a shared document of up to 10,000 pages or more. =Personal-computer based= CPT PT software CPT PT was a reduced a version of the software that ran under MS-DOS as an application on IBM PC compatible computers. The corporation intended it as a bridge to allow data to flow in and out of personal computer packages, as well as providing a personal-computer word processing application for those familiar with standalone CPT equipment or who preferred the CPT style of dual-window text editing. Price: approx. $200, 1980-era values. CPT Genius Display The Genius display was a stand-alone vertically oriented (portrait) configuration monochrome grey-scale CRT monitor unit and an IBM PC form factor display card to allow high resolution full page text & graphics on IBM PC compatible computers. A special MS-DOS driver was required, but allowed a text screen to be 80 characters wide and 66 lines tall (a normal printed page parameters). The display unit looked similar to that of the Phoenix monitor (minus the keyboard) shown in Figure 6 above. Text editors such as Quicksoft's PC-Write, WordPerfect, WordStar, VolksWriter (and more) supported the full page mode. Lotus Symphony and 1-2-3 would support full page as well as dual screen mode (2 'regular' landscape screens, one in the top half of the screen with the other below. Windows 3.0 drivers were also developed for this product that allowed for full page screen presentations, just like their dedicated word processors, but with the addition of monochrome graphics. Some specifications: 9x15 pixel character cell 8x12 pixel character matrix, includes 3 scan line for descenders (i.e. letters g,j,p...) 13th scan line for underscore progressive scan, 60 Hz vertical refresh rate 64 kHz horizontal scan rate 100 MHz video bandwidth 15\\" diagonal, 110 degree deflection, paper white, long persistence phosphor (from at-the-time marketing literature) The product was originally developed by Micro Display Systems of Hastings Minnesota as the VHR-400. Price: unknown =Hardcopy Printers= Daisy Wheel Printers Daisy wheel printers from Qume Corporation and Diablo Systems could be connected to the 8000 and 8500 series word processors.

Opened by the Brighton, Lewes and Hastings Railway in 1846 as part of what became the East Coastway Line, it was the first permanent station to serve the area and became part of a feud between two rival railway companies over access to nearby Hastings. Although ultimately inconvenient for local services, the station became an important goods railhead and the location of a motive power depot for locomotives working express services to London. The station was closed in 1967 and subsequently demolished, although in 2011 remnants of the down platform could still be seen.  History  =Opening= On 27 June 1846, the Brighton, Lewes and Hastings Railway (BL&H;) opened an eastward extension of its Brighton-Lewes line to a temporary station at . Once a bridge over the River Asten had been completed, Bulverhythe was replaced on 7 November 1846 by a permanent station named Hastings & St Leonards which was situated a short distance to the east, from the centre of St Leonards-on-sea. =LB&SCR; and SER feud= The BL&H; had powers to extend the line to a junction with the South Eastern Railway (SER) at Ashford, thereby creating a coastal route from to Dover of strategic military importance to the government. The SER took advantage of the government's desire for the line by offering to construct the section between Hastings and Ashford in return for powers to build the North Kent Line, which resulted in the government agreeing to authorise the Hastings-Ashford line provided the SER extended its Tonbridge-Tunbridge Wells line to Hastings. In view of the low revenue earning potential of a Hastings- Ashford line with Rye the largest settlement to be served, the BL&H; agreed to transfer ownership of the section to the SER whilst retaining the right to exercise running powers as far as Hastings. The BL&H; had been taken over by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR;) on 27 July 1846, which decided to exercise the right to run as far as Hastings. This would give it a route from to St Leonards of , somewhat shorter than the SER's circuit of travelling via Redhill and Tonbridge and then Ashford. A crisis was therefore triggered when the SER's line to Hastings and the short stretch from St Leonards opened simultaneously on 13 February 1851. The SER made it difficult for LB&SCR; services to use the new line by holding up a train for so long at Bo-peep junction that it was obliged to return to St Leonards and unload its passengers. Later, the SER tore up track at Bo-Peep and obstructed the line with wagons filled with earth. A 1914 Railway Clearing House map of lines around St Leonards. An injunction obtained by the LB&SCR; ensured the reopening of the line and the two companies began to share traffic receipts, culminating in an agreement in 1866 by which , the SER's intermediate station between Hastings and the LB&SCR;'s St Leonards station, became a joint station and facilities were provided here and at Hastings to allow joint SER/LB&SCR; operation of the line. LB&SCR; services were nevertheless not allowed to call at Warrior Square until December 1870, at which point the LB&SCR; changed the name of its own St Leonards station to St Leonards West Marina. =Post-feud to closure= West Marina was inconveniently situated for local traffic but as it was the only station in the area under the LB&SCR;'s exclusive control, the station was retained and even developed to become a railhead for goods traffic. The LB&SCR; tried to improve access in 1882 when a new station was built on an adjacent site to the east. The station was provided with a coal yard with sidings, freight sheds and a turntable. The station's stock fell after the 1921 grouping, although it retained a certain importance until the late 1950s as a locomotive depot. Following electrification of the East Coastway line in 1935 by the Southern Railway, the service pattern introduced from May saw express trains from call at all stations except West Marina. Nevertheless, the station became the terminus for London services in November 1949 when it was necessary to close Bopeep Tunnel for repairs; buses ferried passengers from West Marina to St Leonards Warrior Square. Normal services through the tunnel resumed on 5 June 1950. Remarkably the now dilapidated station remained open to passengers until 10 July 1967, the station's goods yard already having closed on 26 November 1962. For several years after closure the station platforms remained available for use of railway staff requiring access to the depot. =Motive power depot= Platform remains in 2007. A motive power depot was established at the station by the LB&SCR; in 1846 on the Down side of the line to the west of the Bo-Peep tunnel. The depot served the Hastings area and was a small two-road shed, constructed in brick with a turntable on the northern side. This was replaced by a second larger 4-road shed in 1872, which was enlarged in 1898 and again by British Railways in 1949. In 1926, the shed had 62 staff including 20 drivers and firemen. Following the demolition of the ex-SER shed at Hastings, West Marina shed grew in importance as it took over the former shed's entire allocation in 1929. A new wheel drop facility was fitted in the same year to assist with the increased workload, as were additional carriage sidings. The first of 12 SR V Schools class locomotives arrived in 1931, adding to the shed's 20-odd 4-4-0s, F1s, Ls and a handful of tank and 0-6-0s. The Schools class were used to work Hastings Line expresses to London. As of January 1947, its allocation consisted of 30 locomotives: 20 4-4-0s, 5 0-4-4Ts and 5 0-6-0s. Following nationalisation, the shed was given the code 74E and it received a new asbestos roof with brick gables. However, by 1957 the depot's role was much reduced as a result of the first stages of dieselisation which had led to the closure of the servicing point at Hastings station and the withdrawal of most of St Leonards' engines. Further dieselisation resulted in the depot's effective closure in June 1958, although engines continued to be serviced and stabled until 10 November 1967. The bulk of the shed's remaining allocation was transferred to Ashford, Brighton, Tonbridge and . The depot has now been completely demolished. A new diesel depot was opened to the west of the old steam motive power depot.  Present day  The station buildings were demolished following closure and the site is now the car park of a TK Maxx warehouse store. Where the engine sheds stood, is now a train washing facility which was built in 1958; TK Maxx and a row of houses now stand where the coal yard and freight sheds once stood. The remains of both platforms can also still be seen.

Acting career Maria Dinulescu studied acting at the National University of Cinema and Drama in Bucharest, Romania. She came to international attention in 2003, when one of the first shorts she played in, \\"Traffic\\", won the Palme d'Or in Cannes. She came back to Cannes in 2007, as the lead female actress in the full-feature \\"California Dreamin' (endless),\\" the winner of the \\"Un Certain Regard\\" section. Her performance in this movie won her a few other awards including the Best Actress Prize at BIAF Georgia and Arte Mare from France. Maria subsequently played the lead role in \\"Hooked\\", a film that had its world premiere at the 65th Venice film Festival. Her performance in \\"Hooked\\" was described as \\"bewitching\\" (Hollywood Reporter) and \\"bubbly (in a difficult role)\\" (Variety) and was rewarded with the Best Actress Prize at the Thessaloniki Film Festival and the Buenos Aires Film Festival. Of the 12 full- length feature films that Maria has starred in, she has played the lead 7 times. She also has several television credits, including the HBO-produced Romanian version of the \\"In Treatment\\" HBO series. She has acted in more than 10 successful short films, commercials, and was the lead in the music video, \\"Peace\\" by Depeche Mode.

Maria has a master in Japanese theater and culture, is member of European Film Academy and speak Romanian, English and Italian. What others have to say about Maria: Jay Weissberg (Variety), met Ms. Dinulescu at Cannes in 2007 and he writes: \\". . .it is very rare that jaded critics stand up and take notice, but quite a number of us remarked at the time that Dinulescu was an actress to watch.\\" \\"She has chosen roles wisely and has been fortunate in that several films she‚Äôs starred in have been screened at the world‚Äôs most important festivals, including Cannes, Venice and Toronto. This exposure has broadened her name recognition far beyond Romania‚Äôs borders, and she is currently one of the most recognizable and watched actresses in the Romanian film industry ‚Äì an industry, I should add, whose extraordinary renaissance in recent years has meant that every major International film festival actively seeks out Romanian films for their roster.\\" Yale University Professor, David Chambers, states: \\"As an actress, Maria Dinulescu is uncommonly protean, absolutely distinct and different in each role she plays. Her range of abilities as an actress is simply astounding: here a beguiling gamine, there an androgynous mystery woman, next a rebellious fury, then a delightfully comic trickster with a twinkle in her eye.\\" Columbia University Professor, Andrei Serban, states: \\"Maria Dinulescu is an extremely gifted actress with love for her craft and enthusiasm for her profession. I am impressed with her ardor and devotion to the classic roles as well as new characters she plays so charmingly on the big screen, which brought her impressive awards. Without hesitation I can declare that Maria Dinulescu is an outstanding actress with a skilled potential and upcoming career.\\" Guillermo Arriaga, Writer & Director, Cannes Palme d'Or Winner and Oscar Nominated, writes: \\"She is an extraordinary actress with a bright future ahead of her due to her great talent. She is sought after by several of the top directors for difficult roles.

It is composed of cortex and medulla. The cortex is also divided into outer cortex and inner cortex (also known as the paracortex). The outer cortex is composed of follicles of B cells so that it is called the B-cell zone. Similarly, the inner cortex has T cells and is called the T-cell zone. Follicular hyperplasia Follicular hyperplasia is a stimulation of the B cell compartment. It is caused by an abnormal proliferation of secondary follicles and occurs principally in the cortex without broaching the lymph node capsule. The follicles are cytologically polymorphous, are often polarized, and vary in size and shape. Follicular hyperplasia must be distinguished from follicular lymphoma (bcl-2 protein is expressed in neoplastic follicles, but not reactive follicles). Paracortical hyperplasia Paracortical hyperplasia is the preferential stimulation of the T cell compartment. It is caused by an abnormal expansion of the interfollicular zones but is confined within the lymph node capsule. The population of the compartment is cytologically polymorphous. Paracortical hyperplasia may be accompanied by vascular proliferation. Must be distinguished from monomorphous T cell lymphoma. Sinus hyperplasia Sinus hyperplasia is the preferential stimulation of the histiocytic (tissues macrophage) compartment. Histological features include distention or engorgement of both subscapular and inatraparenchymal sinuses by benign histiocytes which may be hemophagocytic. Sinus hyperplasia may be associated with non-hematolymphoid malignancy. Other features include presence of white spaces and lymphocytes (large cells) within sinuses. Complications It is one common source of appendicitis, as it may cause an obstruction of the appendiceal lumen, resulting in the subsequent filling of the appendix with mucus, causing it to distend and internal pressure to increase.

Confidence in the school and its future has seen a rise in student numbers over the last two years and many of these students from out- lying areas. This creates a strong impetus for NDSC to be competitive and provide a high-quality education for all students as well as enhancing the opportunities for our top students. Our vision is to provide a point of need education for all students, maximising their ability to achieve the best possible outcomes. We see our school as a community that cares for and respects one another. We pride ourselves on staff working as a cohesive unit to support students and families to achieve their goals. We have high expectations for our students and believe that all students can achieve excellence in their educational pursuits. NDSC is a Positive School Wide Behaviours school.

Respect - We have due regard for the feelings, wishes and/or rights of others. Perseverance - We admire and encourage others to continue to persevere in spite of barriers. Leadership ‚Äì We strongly encourage students to undertake leadership roles but also to take on leadership behaviours. Fundamental to these values is a belief that everyone has something to contribute, hence tolerance and understanding are core to the way students and staff operate at NDSC. The College has had a strong focus on improving literacy and has had some success with NAPLAN writing and reading growth. 2019 Year 9 benchmark growth was really strong in literacy and numeracy, placing us well above state and national levels.

Mendota, a sidewheel gunboat, was launched 13 January 1863 by F. Z. Tucker, Brooklyn, New York; acquired by the Navy 1 February 1864; and commissioned 2 May 1864, Comdr. Edward T. Nichols in command.  Assigned to the North Atlantic Blockade on the James River  From the day of her commissioning in 1864, Mendota was assigned to the James River Division, North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. The first ten months she served as a picket ship near Four Mile Creek. Her guns were used to prevent the establishment of Confederate batteries or entrenchments which would threaten river communications or imperil a small Union Army base camp. Action on 28 July was particularly intense. During her last two months of service, she directed ship movements at Hampton Roads, Virginia, and also at the mouth of the Delaware River.  Post- war decommissioning and disposal  After the war, Mendota decommissioned 12 May 1865 and was laid up at League Island, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, until sold 7 December 1867.

He was best known for being one of the lead guitarists for the thrash metal band Defiance throughout their entire recording career. Harrington was born October 1, 1966 in Massachusetts, and moved in his early childhood to Oakland, California, where he was raised. Doug joined Defiance in 1984, left in 1985 and rejoined again the same year in a turn of events where he and his replacement Jim Adams ended up sharing the lead guitar position. Doug was an integral member of Defiance as soon as he joined the band, composing the bulk of the band's music on all three of their albums, Product of Society, Void Terra Firma and Beyond Recognition. Around 1993, Defiance folded and Harrington, along with his former bandmates Jim Adams and bassist Mike Kaufmann formed a new band, Inner Threshold, with ex- Heathen vocalist Dave White. This band played a more groove oriented traditional metal style. After the departure of Adams and White, Harrington and Kaufmann formed Under, which also eventually folded after an EP. Harrington married his wife Adrianne in May 1996. Their daughter Grace was born on August 25, 2002. No longer a professional musician, Harrington went back to school and went into Marketing and Sales. He played in a cover band called Fat Freddie's Cat which also featured Dave White, Mike Kaufmann and Jim Adams. Defiance reunited in 2004 with Harrington, Adams, Kaufmann, vocalist Steev Esquivel, and new drummer James Raymond (later replaced by Mark Hernandez), but at the time Harrington was secretly battling cancer. Harrington spent the last few years of his life recording and writing for the new Defiance album, but died in late 2006. The remaining four members of Defiance have carried on as Harrington requested and their last album was dedicated to him. A park bench at Montclair part in Oakland, California was also dedicated to Harrington.

The original National Gallery of Rhodesia was designed and directed by Frank McEwen, a British citizen credited with bringing Shona Sculpture to the spotlight. The Gallery was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother on 16 July 1957 and Queen Elizabeth II attended the sixth Zimbabwe Heritage Exhibition there in October 1991.Zimbabwe Heritage 91: Commemorative Catalogue (1991); Printed by Interpak (Pvt) Ltd McEwen was curator of the Gallery from 1957 until his resignation in 1973. The next curator was Roy Guthrie, who founded the Chapungu Sculpture Park in 1970. In 2007, the gallery celebrated its fiftieth anniversary: its current (2014) Executive Director is Doreen Sibanda, with curator Raphael Chikukwa. The well-known Zimbabwean sculptor Dominic Benhura is a member of the Board of Trustees. Regional galleries =National Gallery of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo= The National Gallery in Bulawayo is a branch of the NGZ opened in 1970 in Zimbabwe's second city, Bulawayo. It was located for some years in an old market building behind City Hall, but since 1993 has occupied Douslin House on Main Street, an elegant two-storey building of 1901. Directors of the National Gallery in Bulawayo include Stephen Williams, Yvonne Vera, Addelis Sibutha, Voti Thebe and Butholezwe Kgosi Nyathi. =National Gallery of Zimbabwe in Mutare= The National Gallery of Zimbabwe in Mutare was opened in 1999 at Kopje House, which was built in 1897 and was the first hospital in Mutare. It was declared a Monument in the late 1970s and thereafter became a Culture House under the custody of the National Museums and Monuments. The National Gallery of Zimbabwe in Mutare has five members of staff under the leadership of the Regional Director, Elizabeth Muusha. The gallery runs an annual exhibitions programme showing a selection of work from the Harare gallery, while offering local artists the opportunity to show their work. History The National Gallery of Zimbabwe has been in existence since 1957, witnessed the shift from colonialism to independence, and has been central to the rise of Zimbabwean artists in the world art market. The Gallery was initially planned in the 1930s, but the outbreak of the Second World War impeded the colonial government's involvement in its progress. However, the idea was given new life when in 1943, Sir James McDonald, a friend and colleague of Cecil John Rhodes, left a bequest of ¬£30,000 \\"in trust for the people of the colony\\" to establish an art gallery and art museum in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia. At the end of 1953, the Inaugural Board of the Gallery was established, chaired by the Governor of Southern Rhodesia. The passing of the National Gallery Act by the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly in early 1952 saw the dissolution of the Inaugural Board and the establishment of the Board of Trustees. Major (later Sir) Stephen Courtauld presided as Chairman of the Board until 1962. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the Gallery from its inception, and after his departure from the Board he and his wife became the first patrons of the Gallery. The Gallery was conceived as a national institution, representing Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, and Nyasaland, governed from 1953 to 1963 as a united Federation. Salisbury City Council agreed to take full responsibility for overseeing the building, establishment and administration of the Gallery, and the Mayor of Salisbury was made a fixed appointee to the Board of Trustees. The first responsibilities of the Board were to establish funds for the building, to select the building design, and to appoint a Director. They next established funds for the running and administration costs of the Gallery, and made provision for an endowment fund for the acquisition of a permanent collection. At that time, the building funds consisted only of the McDonald bequest and a further ¬£150,000 had yet to be raised. It was decided that an appeal should be launched among local businesses in support of building a gallery in Southern Rhodesia. \\"In all great countries of the world art galleries have their place in the cultural life of the community, and it is the firm belief of the Trustees that a National Art Gallery is essential to the progress of the people of this land,\\" stated Sir Stephen Courtauld in the annual report of 1954, giving voice to the Board's support of the establishment of the Gallery.

Life  David James Hendricks was born in Morton Grove and raised in Oak Park, Illinois. He was a member of the Exclusive branch of the Plymouth Brethren, a conservative Christian denomination. He started and ran a highly successful business in Bloomington, Illinois, selling an orthopedic back-brace he had patented.Cult Help and Information - Roots of Hendricks' religion traced He later bought a large house at a then-new development in Bloomington and moved his family there. On November 7, 1983, while Hendricks was out of state on a business trip, his wife Susan, 30, and the couple's three children -- Rebekah, 9; Grace, 7; and Benjamin, 5 -- were found murdered in that home by a police officer performing a welfare check, requested after Hendricks was unable to reach them by phone. An axe and a butcher's knife were the murder weapons and had been left at the scene. Hendricks was interviewed immediately on return from his trip and became the primary suspect due to his relationship with the victims and the police detectives' initial dissatisfaction with his demeanor.  Trial and afterward  Hendricks was tried the following year. The trial was moved from Bloomington to Rockford, Illinois, 133 miles away, where he was found guilty in a jury trial. The judge took the unusual step of indicating publicly that while he was not criticizing the jury for performing their duty, he was not personally convinced beyond reasonable doubt. Hendricks' guilt was questioned due to the prosecution's reliance on circumstantial evidence and the possible prejudicial effect of statements made about his religious beliefs. Among other factors, the prosecution attempted to link the murders to Hendricks' belief that divorce was a sin. Hendricks had recently hired female models to demonstrate his product for marketing materials. Some of these women gave testimony for the prosecution that Hendricks asked them to remove clothing and made intimate contact with their upper bodies during private test-fittings. Since the brace was normally worn externally, expert witnesses were called to testify that regular clothing and a brief fitting time were more typical, emphasized with an in-court demonstration. The prosecution used these to form a circumstantial case for Hendricks being dissatisfied with his marriage and argued that since Hendricks did not believe in divorce, he had a motive to kill his wife and children. The prosecution argued for Hendricks' sole guilt, although no direct evidence of guilt was found on Hendricks, including a lack of blood contamination. His lawyers failed to challenge some other key pieces of the prosecution's evidence, such as how the order of killings was dubious for a sole killer acting on Hendricks' schedule that evening, and that the weapons and blood spatter suggested two perpetrators. There were signs of carelessly-handled evidence by the investigating team, such as containers identified as the children's stomach contents containing material inconsistent with their known preferences. The contents had been used by an expert witness to establish a time of death prior to Hendricks leaving on his business trip. Hendricks was sentenced to four consecutive life sentences. He served seven years in Menard Correctional Center in Illinois. While incarcerated Hendrick befriended his cellmate, convicted murderer and prison fugitive Henry Hillenbrand. Using a tape recorder and with Hillenbrand's blessing Hendricks used his jail time to pen a novel about Hillenbrand's life. Hendricks married a second time while in prison. In 1991, the Illinois Supreme Court overturned the conviction and Hendricks was granted a retrial at the McLean County Law and Justice Center in Bloomington. A surprise prison witness for the prosecution claimed Hendricks had confessed the crime while incarcerated, but a jury was unconvinced and he was acquitted and released. Shortly afterward he renounced his fundamentalist religious ties and moved to Florida to start another orthopedic business. He presently lives in Orlando, Florida with his fourth wife, Gazel. He recently sold his last business and is presumed retired.

Primarily renowned as a novelist and short fiction writer in the cyberpunk milieu, Gibson invented the metaphor of cyberspace in \\"Burning Chrome\\" (1982) and emerged from obscurity in 1984 with the publication of his debut novel Neuromancer. Gibson's early short fiction is recognized as cyberpunk's finest work, effectively renovating the science fiction genre which had been hitherto considered widely insignificant. At the turn of the 1990s, after the completion of his Sprawl trilogy of novels, Gibson contributed the text to a number of performance art pieces and exhibitions, as well as writing lyrics for musicians Yellow Magic Orchestra and Debbie Harry. He wrote the critically acclaimed artist's book Agrippa (a book of the dead) in 1992 before co-authoring The Difference Engine, an alternate history novel that would become a central work of the steampunk genre. He then spent an unfruitful period as a Hollywood screenwriter, with few of his projects seeing the light of day and those that did being critically unsuccessful.Johnny Mnemonic at Rotten Tomatoes. Retrieved 2008-01-15. Although he had largely abandoned short fiction by the mid-1990s, Gibson returned to writing novels, completing his second trilogy, the Bridge trilogy at the close of the millennium. After writing two episodes of the television series The X-Files around this time, Gibson was featured as the subject of a documentary film, No Maps for These Territories, in 2000. Gibson has been invited to address the National Academy of Sciences (1993) and the Directors Guild of America (2003) and has had a plethora of articles published in outlets such as Wired, Rolling Stone and The New York Times.

M., \\"Local Compositions in Thermodynamic Excess Functions for Liquid Mixtures\\", AIChE J., 14(1), S.135‚Äì144, 1968 (abbreviated NRTL model) is an activity coefficient model that correlates the activity coefficients \\\\gamma_i of a compound with its mole fractions x_i in the liquid phase concerned. It is frequently applied in the field of chemical engineering to calculate phase equilibria. The concept of NRTL is based on the hypothesis of Wilson that the local concentration around a molecule is different from the bulk concentration. This difference is due to a difference between the interaction energy of the central molecule with the molecules of its own kind U_{ii} and that with the molecules of the other kind U_{ij}. The energy difference also introduces a non-randomness at the local molecular level. The NRTL model belongs to the so-called local-composition models. Other models of this type are the Wilson model, the UNIQUAC model, and the group contribution model UNIFAC. These local-composition models are not thermodynamically consistent for a one-fluid model for a real mixture due to the assumption that the local composition around molecule i is independent of the local composition around molecule j. This assumption is not true, as was shown by Flemr in 1976.McDermott (Fluid Phase Equilibrium 1(1977)33) and Flemr (Coll. Czech. Chem.Comm., 41 (1976) 3347) However, they are consistent if a hypothetical two-liquid model is used. Derivation Like Wilson (1964), Renon & Prausnitz (1968) began with local composition theory, but instead of using the Flory‚ÄìHuggins volumetric expression as Wilson did, they assumed local compositions followed :\\\\frac{x_{21}}{x_{11}} = \\\\frac{x_2}{x_1} \\\\frac{\\\\exp(-\\\\alpha_{21} g_{21}/RT)}{\\\\exp(-\\\\alpha_{11} g_{11}/RT)} with a new \\"non-randomness\\" parameter Œ±. The excess Gibbs free energy was then determined to be :\\\\frac{G^{ex}}{RT} = \\\\sum_i^N x_i \\\\frac{\\\\sum_j^N \\\\tau_{ji} G_{ji} x_j}{\\\\sum_k^N G_{ki} x_k}. Unlike Wilson's equation, this can predict partially miscible mixtures. However the cross term, like Wohl's expansion, is more suitable for H^\\\\text{ex} than G^\\\\text{ex}, and experimental data is not always sufficiently plentiful to yield three meaningful values, so later attempts to extend Wilson's equation to partial miscibility (or to extend Guggenheim's quasichemical theory for nonrandom mixtures to Wilson's different-sized molecules) eventually yielded variants like UNIQUAC. Equations for a binary mixture For a binary mixture the following functionReid R. C., Prausnitz J. M., Poling B. E., The Properties of Gases & Liquids, 4th Edition, McGraw-Hill, 1988 are used: : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix} \\\\ln\\\\ \\\\gamma_1=x^2_2\\\\left[\\\\tau_{21}\\\\left(\\\\frac{G_{21}}{x_1+x_2 G_{21}}\\\\right)^2 +\\\\frac{\\\\tau_{12} G_{12}} {(x_2+x_1 G_{12})^2 }\\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ln\\\\ \\\\gamma_2=x^2_1\\\\left[\\\\tau_{12}\\\\left(\\\\frac{G_{12}}{x_2+x_1 G_{12}}\\\\right)^2 +\\\\frac{\\\\tau_{21} G_{21}} {(x_1+x_2 G_{21})^2 }\\\\right] \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right. with : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix} \\\\ln\\\\ G_{12}=-\\\\alpha_{12}\\\\ \\\\tau_{12} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ln\\\\ G_{21}=-\\\\alpha_{21}\\\\ \\\\tau_{21} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right. Here, \\\\tau_{12} and \\\\tau_{21} are the dimensionless interaction parameters, which are related to the interaction energy parameters \\\\Delta g_{12} and \\\\Delta g_{21} by: : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix} \\\\tau_{12}=\\\\frac{\\\\Delta g_{12}}{RT}=\\\\frac{U_{12}-U_{22}}{RT} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\tau_{21}=\\\\frac{\\\\Delta g_{21}}{RT}=\\\\frac{U_{21}-U_{11}}{RT} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right. Here R is the gas constant and T the absolute temperature, and Uij is the energy between molecular surface i and j. Uii is the energy of evaporation. Here Uij has to be equal to Uji, but \\\\Delta g_{ij} is not necessary equal to \\\\Delta g_{ji} . The parameters \\\\alpha_{12} and \\\\alpha_{21} are the so-called non-randomness parameter, for which usually \\\\alpha_{12} is set equal to \\\\alpha_{21}. For a liquid, in which the local distribution is random around the center molecule, the parameter \\\\alpha_{12}=0. In that case the equations reduce to the one- parameter Margules activity model: : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix} \\\\ln\\\\ \\\\gamma_1=x^2_2\\\\left[\\\\tau_{21} +\\\\tau_{12} \\\\right]=Ax^2_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ln\\\\ \\\\gamma_2=x^2_1\\\\left[\\\\tau_{12}+\\\\tau_{21} \\\\right]=Ax^2_1 \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right. In practice, \\\\alpha_{12} is set to 0.2, 0.3 or 0.48. The latter value is frequently used for aqueous systems. The high value reflects the ordered structure caused by hydrogen bonds. However, in the description of liquid- liquid equilibria the non-randomness parameter is set to 0.2 to avoid wrong liquid-liquid description. In some cases a better phase equilibria description is obtained by setting \\\\alpha_{12}=-1.Effective Local Compositions in Phase Equilibrium Correlations, J. M. Marina, D. P. Tassios Ind. Eng. Chem. Process Des. Dev., 1973, 12 (1), pp 67‚Äì71 However this mathematical solution is impossible from a physical point of view, since no system can be more random than random (\\\\alpha_{12} =0). In general NRTL offers more flexibility in the description of phase equilibria than other activity models due to the extra non-randomness parameters. However, in practice this flexibility is reduced in order to avoid wrong equilibrium description outside the range of regressed data. The limiting activity coefficients, also known as the activity coefficients at infinite dilution, are calculated by: : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix} \\\\ln\\\\ \\\\gamma_1^\\\\infty=\\\\left[\\\\tau_{21} +\\\\tau_{12} \\\\exp{(-\\\\alpha_{12}\\\\ \\\\tau_{12})} \\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ln\\\\ \\\\gamma_2^\\\\infty=\\\\left[\\\\tau_{12} +\\\\tau_{21}\\\\exp{(-\\\\alpha_{12}\\\\ \\\\tau_{21})}\\\\right] \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right. The expressions show that at \\\\alpha_{12}=0 the limiting activity coefficients are equal. This situation that occurs for molecules of equal size, but of different polarities. It also shows, since three parameters are available, that multiple sets of solutions are possible. General equations The general equation for \\\\ln(\\\\gamma_i) for species i in a mixture of n components is:http://users.rowan.edu/~hesketh/0906-316/Handouts/Pages%20from%20SimBasis%20appendix%20A%20property%20packages.pdf : \\\\ln(\\\\gamma_i)=\\\\frac{\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{x_{j}\\\\tau_{ji}G_{ji}}}{\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n}{x_{k}G_{ki}}}+\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{\\\\frac{x_{j}G_{ij}}{\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n}{x_{k}G_{kj}}}}{\\\\left ({\\\\tau_{ij}-\\\\frac{\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{m=1}^{n}{x_{m}\\\\tau_{mj}G_{mj}}}{\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n}{x_{k}G_{kj}}}}\\\\right )} with : G_{ij}=\\\\exp\\\\left ({-\\\\alpha_{ij}\\\\tau_{ij}}\\\\right ) : \\\\alpha_{ij}=\\\\alpha_{ij_{0}}+\\\\alpha_{ij_{1}}T : \\\\tau_{i,j}=A_{ij}+\\\\frac{B_{ij}}{T}+\\\\frac{C_{ij}}{T^{2}}+D_{ij}\\\\ln{\\\\left ({T}\\\\right )}+E_{ij}T^{F_{ij}} There are several different equation forms for \\\\alpha_{ij} and \\\\tau_{ij}, the most general of which are shown above. Temperature dependent parameters To describe phase equilibria over a large temperature regime, i.e. larger than 50 K, the interaction parameter has to be made temperature dependent. Two formats are frequently used. The extended Antoine equation format: :\\\\tau_{ij}=f(T)=a_{ij}+\\\\frac{b_{ij}}{T}+c_{ij}\\\\ \\\\ln\\\\ T+d_{ij}T Here the logarithmic and linear terms are mainly used in the description of liquid-liquid equilibria (miscibility gap). The other format is a second-order polynomial format: :\\\\Delta g_{ij}=f(T)=a_{ij}+b_{ij}\\\\cdot T +c_{ij}T^{2}  Parameter determination  The NRTL parameters are fitted to activity coefficients that have been derived from experimentally determined phase equilibrium data (vapor‚Äìliquid, liquid‚Äìliquid, solid‚Äìliquid) as well as from heats of mixing. The source of the experimental data are often factual data banks like the Dortmund Data Bank. Other options are direct experimental work and predicted activity coefficients with UNIFAC and similar models. Noteworthy is that for the same liquid mixture several NRTL parameter sets might exist. The NRTL parameter set to use depends on the kind of phase equilibrium (i.e. solid‚Äìliquid (SL), liquid‚Äìliquid (LL), vapor‚Äìliquid (VL)). In the case of the description of a vapor‚Äìliquid equilibria it is necessary to know which saturated vapor pressure of the pure components was used and whether the gas phase was treated as an ideal or a real gas. Accurate saturated vapor pressure values are important in the determination or the description of an azeotrope. The gas fugacity coefficients are mostly set to unity (ideal gas assumption), but for vapor-liquid equilibria at high pressures (i.e. > 10 bar) an equation of state is needed to calculate the gas fugacity coefficient for a real gas description. Determination of NRTL parameters from LLE data is more complicated than parameter regression from VLE data as it involves solving isoactivity equations which are highly non- linear. In addition, parameters obtained from LLE may not always represent the real activity of components due to lack of knowledge on the activity values of components in the data regression. For this reason it is necessary to confirm the consistency of the obtained parameters in the whole range of compositions (including binary subsystems, experimental and calculated lie-lines, Hessian matrix, etc.).Li, Z.; Smith, K. H.; Mumford, K. A.; Wang, Y.; Stevens, G. W., Regression of NRTL parameters from ternary liquid‚Äìliquid equilibria using particle swarm optimization and discussions.

Function  This gene encodes a transcription factor that contains four zinc finger motifs at the C-terminus and a proline / glutamine- rich DNA-binding domain at the N-terminus. It has an essential role in the normal development of the urogenital system, and it is mutated in a subset of patients with Wilms' tumor, the gene's namesake. Multiple transcript variants, resulting from alternative splicing at two coding exons, have been well characterized. There is also evidence for the use of non-AUG (CUG) translation initiation site upstream of, and in-frame with the first AUG, leading to additional isoforms.  Structure  The WT1 gene product shows similarity to the zinc fingers of the mammalian growth regulated early growth response protein 1 (EGR1) and (EGR2) proteins.  Clinical significance  Mutations of Wilms' tumor suppressor gene1 (WT1) are associated with embryonic malignancy of the kidney, affecting around 1-9 in 100,000 infants. It occurs in both sporadic and hereditary forms. Inactivation of WT1 causes Wilms tumour, and Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS), leading to nephropathy and genital abnormalities. The WT1 protein has been found to bind a host of cellular factors, e.g. p53, a known tumor suppressor. Despite the name, WT1 mutation is found in only about 5-10% of Wilms Tumor cases. Some other genes associated with this disease are BRCA2 and GPC3 WT1 is mutated in a mutually exclusive manner with TET2, IDH1, and IDH2 in acute myeloid leukemia. TET2 can be recruited by WT1 to its target genes and activates WT1-target genes by converting 5mC into 5hmC residues at the genes‚Äô promoters, representing an important feature of a new regulatory WIT pathway linked to the development of AML. The serine protease HtrA2 binds to WT1 and it cleaves WT1 at multiple sites following the treatment with cytotoxic drugs. Using immunohistochemistry, WT1 protein can be demonstrated in the cell nuclei of 75% of mesotheliomas and in 93% of ovarian serous carcinomas, as well as in benign mesothelium and fallopian tube epithelium. This allows these tumours to be distinguished from other, similar, cancers, such as adenocarcinoma. Antibodies to the WT1 protein, however, also frequently cross-react with cytoplasmic proteins in a variety of benign and malignant cells, so that only nuclear staining can be considered diagnostic. Mutation in WT1 causes predisposition to hernias. =As a drug target= WT1 has been ranked by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) as the Number 1 target for cancer immunotherapy.SELLAS Life Sciences Announces Positive WT1 Cancer Vaccine (galinpepimut-S) Clinical Results at the 13th International Conference of the International Mesothelioma Interest Group (iMig)Pleural mesothelioma WT1 vaccine is renamed \\"galinpepimut-S\\" A vaccine that induces an acquired immune response against WT1 is in clinical trials for various cancers. T cell therapies (TCR-T) are also being tested in clinical trials for leukemia. = Disease monitoring = WT1 gene is overexpressed in case of hematological malignancies. This fact is widely used for disease monitoring - evaluations of treatment success, as well as relapse or remission post-treatment checks. Preferably quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is used to establish the levels of WT1 expression. The rising level of WT1 expression is significantly connected with disease progression and relaps of the proliferative disorder. WT1 as a marker is used as a \\"golden standard\\" for monitoring of acute myeloid leukemia, however other hematological malignancies such as chronic myeloid leukemia or myeloproliferative syndrome can manifest with overexpressed WT1 and for in specific cases WT1 monitoring can be used even in patients diagnosed with those types of cancer.  Interactions  WT1 has been shown to interact with TET2, U2AF2, PAWR, UBE2I and WTAP. In combination with Cited2 activates WT1 the Steroidogenic factor 1  RNA editing  There is some evidence for RNA editing of human WT1 mRNA. As with alternative splicing of the gene RNA editing increases the number of isoforms of this protein. Editing is tissue specific and developmentally regulated. Editing shown to be restricted in testis and kidney in the rat. Editing of this gene product has been found to occur in mice and rats as well as humans. = Editing type = The editing site is found at nucleotide position 839 found in exon 6 of the gene. It causes a codon change from a Proline codon (CCC) to a Leucine codon (CUC) The type of editing is a Uridine to Cytidine( U to C) base change .The editing reaction is thought to be an amidation of uridine which converts it to a Cytidine.The relevance of this editing is unknown as is the enzyme responsible for this editing.The region where editing occurs like that of other editing sites e.g. ApoB mRNA editing is conserved.Mice, rat and humans have conserved sequences flanking the editing site consisting of 10 nucleotides before the editing site and four after the site. = Effects of editing = RNA editing results in an alternative amino acid being translated. The changes in amino acid occur in a region identified as a domain involved in transcription activation function. Editing has been shown to decrease repressive regulation of transcription of growth promoting genes in vitro compared to the non edited protein. Although the physiological role of editing has yet to be determined, suggestions have been made that editing may play a role in the pathogenesis of Wilms tumour.  Experimental models  WT1 gene can be found as well in the genome of mice. The mouse model with a WT1 knock-out shows symptoms corresponding to human pathophysiology. The mice were observed to have defects of urogenital tract similar to cases patients when WT1 signalling has been malfunctionig. The mouse had absent kindeys as their development failed during embryonic stages. This suggests that WT1 is unconditionally required for a proper kidney formation and development. Apart from that, the WT1 knock-out mice lacked several types of glands, such as gonads or adrenal glands. The effect of the knock-out was as well visible on heart and blood circulation - several abnormalities concerning heart and diaphragm, as well as troubles with swelling and lymph circulation were described. Due to those defects, the mouse died before it was even born. Mouse model is used to study some specific disorder connected with WT1 expression, too, such as acute myeloid leukemia.< To examine the expression levels and localisation of WT1, a mouse model using WT1-GFP (green fluorescent protein) knock-in has been made. This model showed, that WT1 is significantly overexpressed in leukemic cells compared to none or minor expression in normal untransformed cells from bone marow, either hematopoietic stem cells or hematopoietic progenitors and precursors.

Johnson was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the second round of the 1982 MLB Draft. He made his debut with the Braves in 1985, compiling a record of 4‚Äì4 with a 4.10 earned-run average. He had a solid 1986 season, going 13‚Äì9 with both the Braves and the Toronto Blue Jays, to whom he was traded on July 6 for fellow pitcher Jim Acker.

While some features included a fan catching his first foul ball, coverage from inside the Green Monster in Fenway Park, a rare inside the park grand slam in Oakland. For the Toronto game, a sportswriter spent the day with Johnson, the scheduled starting pitcher for that day, and his family. Johnson had been struggling for the Blue Jays that year and in the game gave up three runs in three innings raising his ERA for the season to 5.13, but avoided the loss as the Blue Jays came back to win the game 7‚Äì6. Johnson was sent down to the minors after the game. It was expected to be a short term demotion so that he could work on his mechanics, but it turned out to be the last time he would ever pitch in the majors.

Built in 1853 for a predominantly Irish congregation founded in 1831, it is one of the oldest Catholic parishes north of Boston in the United States. The building, a fine example of Gothic Revival architecture designed by the noted ecclesiastical architect Patrick C. Keely, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. History The original Saint Patrick's church was a wooden structure, built in 1831 to support the Irish workmen who had moved to Lowell, largely to work on the Pawtucket and Merrimack Canals. Prior to its construction, they were attended by Rev. John Mahoney, a Catholic clergyman from a nearby town. By 1830 there were over 400 Roman Catholics in Lowell, and on July 3, 1831, St Patrick's Church was consecrated, led by Mahoney. Mahoney left in 1836 to work in Boston, and was succeeded by E.J. McCool. The current stone structure dates to 1853, although a fire in 1904 caused much of the church to be rebuilt by 1906. Today Today, the church is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In addition to the traditional Irish and French Canadian congregations, the parish, including its school, serves local Southeast Asians, specifically with Vietnamese and Cambodian native-language Masses. Architecture St. Patrick's is located on the eastern edge of the Lowell neighborhood known as The Acre, an area where Irish immigrants originally settled in squatters' camps to work in Lowell's mills. The church overlooks one the city's power canals, at the junction of Suffolk and Cross Streets. It is built in a cruciform plan out of coursed rubblestone with ashlar granite trim. A tower in height projects from the front facade, with stone buttresses flanking the main church entrance at its base. The entrance, as well as flanking entrances on either side, are set in Gothic lancet-arched openings. Above the main entrance is a three-part lancet-arched window, with the tall first stage of the tower completed by a smaller lancet window. The second tower stage houses a belfry with louvered lancet-arch openings, and it is topped by an octagonal steeple ornamented with lancet dormers.

It is constructed as a sloped wall of ceramic or concrete blocks with hexagonal holes on the slope, which makes it look like a honeycomb, hence the name of the unit. Its role is to capture sand and to discharge wave energy. Ceramic honeycomb sea wall units usually have 6 or 7 holes and are safer to walk on. These are placed as a revetment over gravel or rock.Allen, Richard Thomas Lingen, Concrete in Coastal Structures, page 47 During strong storms, surging sea water loses energy as it travels down the holes and through the underlayer. The water returns to the sea by upward flow through holes at levels below the transient phreatic surface in the underlayer, causing the downslope disturbing drag force to be reduced. Water that does not go through the holes is redirected by the concrete wall back into the path of oncoming waves, creating more turbulence. Cost comparisons between various seawalls are always site specific, but Seabees use approximately 22% the mass of rock for the same exposure. As the area of the unit is sensibly independent of height [aspect ratios in use vary from 0.4 to 2.5] the mass of the unit can be optimised for all stages of the production and construction process. Surface roughness may also be determined by using combinations of different height units. Allowance for wear is easily allowed [e.g. Shoreham, 1989-90 & various Lincolnshire Seawalls].

A church existed on this location circa the 12th century, but was extensively modified and enlarged. According to the listing summary, \\"the crossing tower, north and south transepts and aisles were added\\" in the 14th century; additional modifications were made in the next two centuries before a restoration in 1867-1868.CHURCH OF ST PETER The plan is cruciform and the site is in the former park of the Earls of Bath. The collection of church monuments is particularly fine: most of the persons commemorated are members of the family of the Earls, connections of theirs, or household officers. Features of interest include the 16th century gallery, the manorial pew of the Earls of Bath (Renaissance in style) and two ceilings of Italian plasterwork. The tomb of Lady Fitzwarren and the monument of Rachel, Countess of Bath (with figure by Burman) are in the south chancel aisle.Betjeman, John, ed.

She learned English and graduated from Hillhouse High School, then attended Vassar College, the first nonwhite student at that fledgling women's university. She graduated with the Vassar College class of 1882, earning a B.A., magna cum laude. After graduation, she remained a few more months to study nursing, and finally returned to Japan in October 1882. When she first returned to Japan, Yamakawa looked for educational or government work, but her options were limited, especially because she could not read or write Japanese. In April 1882, she accepted a marriage proposal from ≈åyama Iwao, a wealthy and important general, despite the fact that he had fought on the opposing side of the Battle of Aizu. As her husband was promoted, she was elevated in rank to become Countess, Marchioness, and finally Princess ≈åyama in 1905. She was a prominent figure in Rokumeikan society, advising the Empress on Western customs. She also used her social position as a philanthropist to advocate for women's education and volunteer nursing. She assisted in the founding of the Peeresses' School for high-ranking ladies, and the Women's Home School of English, which would later become Tsuda University. She died in 1919 when the 1918 flu pandemic reached Tokyo. Early life Yamakawa Sakiko was born on February 24, 1860, in Aizu, an isolated and mountainous region in what is now the Fukushima Prefecture. She was the youngest daughter of , a kar≈ç (senior retainer) of the lord of Aizu, and his wife T≈çi of another kar≈ç family, the . Yamakawa had five siblings: three sisters‚Äî, Misao, and Tokiwa; and two brothers, and . Yamakawa was raised in a traditional samurai household in the town of Wakamatsu, in a several-acre compound near the northern gate of Tsuruga Castle. She did not attend school, but was taught to read and write at home, as part of a rigorous education in etiquette and obedience based on the eighteenth-century neo- Confucian text Onna Daigaku (Greater Learning for Women). =Battle of Aizu= In 1868‚Äì1869, Yamakawa's family was on the losing side of the Boshin War. The Boshin War was a civil war at the end of Japan's bakumatsu (\\"end of military government\\"), in which pro-shogunate forces resisted the new imperial rule that began with the 1867 Meiji Restoration. The conflict reached Yamakawa's home town with the Battle of Aizu in late 1868. On October 8, 1868, when Yamakawa was eight, imperial forces invaded and burned her home town of Wakamatsu. Yamakawa took shelter within the walls of Tsuruga Castle with her mother and sisters. Several hundred people from other samurai families instead committed ritual suicide, in what would become a famous instance of mass suicide. This invasion marked the beginning of a monthlong siege, which came to be a symbol of \\"heroic and desperate resistance.\\" It was during the Battle of Aizu that the Byakkotai (White Tiger Brigade), a group of teenage fighters, famously committed mass suicide under the mistaken belief that the castle had fallen. Battered Tsuruga Castle, Aizu, Fukushima (1868) The 600 women and children inside the castle, led by Matsudaira Teru, formed work groups to cook, clean, and make gun cartridges, as well as nursing nearly 1,500 wounded soldiers. One of Yamakawa's sisters attempted to join Nakano Takeko's , but on her mother's orders remained inside the castle making gun cartridges. Yamakawa herself, age eight, carried supplies for the cartridge makers. Toward the end of the siege, Yamakawa's mother sent her and other girls to fly kites as a gesture of defiance while imperial cannons bombarded the castle and the women smothered the shells with wet quilts. One shell which was not smothered in time exploded near her, wounding Yamakawa's neck with shrapnel, and killing her sister-in-law Toseko. =After the battle= The siege ended with the castle's surrender on November 7, 1868. Yamakawa was taken to a nearby prisoner camp with her mother and sisters, where they were held for a year. In the spring of 1870, they were exiled to the newly created Tonami District (an area that is now part of the Toyama Prefecture). The 17,000 refugees exiled there had no experience of farming, and the winter saw shortages of food, shelter, and firewood which threatened Yamakawa's family with starvation. Yamakawa, turning eleven, spread night soil on the fields and scavenged for shellfish. In the spring of 1871, Yamakawa was sent to Hakodate, without her family, where she was lodged with Takuma Sawabe and then with French missionaries. Education in America = Departure with the Iwakura Mission = Kiyotaka Kuroda, who arranged to send the girls to study in America In December 1871, when she was eleven years old, Yamakawa was sent to the United States for study, as part of the Iwakura Mission. Yamakawa was one of five girls sent to spend ten years studying Western ways for the benefit of Japan, after which she was to return and pass on her knowledge to other Japanese women and to her children, in accordance with the Meiji philosophy of \\"Good Wife, Wise Mother\\". The other girls were Yoshimasu Ryo (age 14), Ueda Tei (14), Nagai Shige (10) and Tsuda Ume (6). All five girls were from samurai families on the losing side of the Boshin War. The initiative was a \\"pet project\\" of Kiyotaka Kuroda, who initially received no applicants in response to his recruitment efforts, despite the generous funding offered: all the girls' living expenses would be paid for the decade, plus a generous stipend. In response to Kuroda's second call for girls to be educated in America, Yamakawa's eldest brother Hiroshi, acting as head of the household, nominated her. Hiroshi was familiar with Kuroda, since his and Yamakawa's brother Kenjiro had recently left for his own education in America in January 1871, with Kuroda's assistance. Hiroshi may have nominated his sister due to her independent spirit and academic strengths, or out of simple financial need. The five girls chosen were the only applicants. At this time, Yamakawa's mother changed her given name from (\\"little blossom\\") to . The meaning of the new name could indicate disappointment that Yamakawa was being sent away from Japan, with the first character meaning , as if Yamakawa had been thrown away. But the name could also indicate a positive hope: is one of the Three Friends of Winter which flourish even in harsh conditions, and it sounds like , suggesting that her mother her youngest daughter to the government mission while awaiting her safe return. Before leaving Japan, Yamakawa and the others were the first samurai-class girls to be granted an audience with the Empress Haruko, on November 9, 1871. They departed with the rest of the Iwakura Mission on December 23, 1871 aboard the steamship America, chaperoned by Elida DeLong (wife of the American diplomat Charles E. DeLong), who spoke no Japanese). After a stormy and difficult journey, they arrived in San Francisco on January 15, 1872. Yamakawa and the other girls spent two weeks in San Francisco, largely solitary in their hotel room but the subjects of intense newspaper coverage. Americans typically spelled her name as Stemats Yamagawa, and referred to her and the other girls as \\"Japanese princesses\\". After two weeks in San Francisco, the Iwakura Mission embarked on a monthlong cross- country train tour, arriving in Washington, DC on February 29, where Charles Lanman (secretary to Arinori Mori) took custody of the girls. Yamakawa lived briefly with Mrs. Lanman's sister, a Mrs. Hepburn, then in May 1872 all five girls were moved to their own house with a governess, to study English and piano. Leonard Bacon, who acted as an adoptive father to Yamakawa for her decade in America. By October, however, they had separated: Yoshimasu and Ueda returned to Japan, Tsuda moved in with the Lanmans, and on October 31, 1872 Nagai and Yamakawa were moved to New Haven, Connecticut. In New Haven, Yamakawa's elder brother Kenjir≈ç was studying at Yale University. To ensure that Nagai and Yamakawa practiced their English, they were placed in separate households, Nagai living with the minister John S. C. Abbott and Yamakawa living with the minister Leonard Bacon. Yamakawa would spend the next ten years as part of the Bacon family, growing particularly close with his youngest daughter of fourteen children, Alice Mabel Bacon. Likely due to the Bacons' influence, Yamakawa converted to Christianity. Yamakawa attended Grove Hall Seminary, a primary school for girls, with Alice Bacon. In 1875, Yamakawa passed the entrance exam for Hillhouse High School, a prestigious public school, and began her studies there. She attended the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia with both Nagai and Tsuda, a rare reunion. In April 1877, Yamakawa graduated from Hillhouse High School. = Vassar = Yamakawa began her studies at Vassar College in September 1878, the fourteenth year of the still-new women's college. To her regret, the Bacons couldn't afford to send Alice to college, but she was reunited with Nagai. The two of them were the first nonwhite students at the school, and the first Japanese women to enroll in any college. Nagai enrolled as a special student in the music department, while Yamakawa pursued a full four-year bachelor's degree. Yamakawa Sutematsu, Nagai Shige, and their friend from Vassar Martha Sharpe. While at school, Yamakawa began styling her name as Stematz Yamakawa, using the American name order and a spelling which matched the pronunciation of her name. Her teachers included Henry Van Ingen and Maria Mitchell. During her time at Vassar, she studied Latin, German, Greek, math, natural history, composition, literature, drawing, chemistry, geology, history, and philosophy. She also mastered chess and whist. Yamakawa was a reserved and ambitious student, whose marks were among the highest in the class. She was also well- liked by her classmates. Around this time, Yamakawa's sister Misao moved from Japan to Russia; Misao wrote letters in French to Yamakawa, which Yamakawa's classmates translated and helped her reply to. Yamakawa was elected class president for 1879, and invited to join the literary club of the Shakespeare Society, which was \\"reserved for students of formidable intellect.\\" In 1880, she was a marshal for the college's Founder's Day celebration. In June 1881, Nagai returned to Japan. The ten-year period of the girls' educational mission had ended, but Yamakawa extended her stay to complete her degree. In her senior year, she was named president of the Philalethean Society, the largest social organization at Vassar. Yamakawa graduated from Vassar College with a B.A., magna cum laude, on June 14, 1882. Her thesis was on \\"British Foreign Policy Toward Japan,\\" and she was chosen to give a commencement speech on the topic at her class's graduation. After graduation, Yamakawa studied nursing at the Connecticut Training School For Nurses in New Haven in July and August. She and Tsuda (who had also extended her stay, to complete a high school degree) finally departed for Japan in October 1882. They travelled by rail to San Francisco, whence they left aboard the steamship Arabic on October 31. After a rough three-week journey across the Pacific, Yamakawa arrived in Yokohama on November 20, 1882.  Marriage and family  When she first returned to Japan, Yamakawa looked for educational or government work, but her options were limited, especially because she could not read or write Japanese. Yamakawa initially expressed in her letters a resolution to remain unmarried and pursue an intellectual life, turning down at least three proposals. As she struggled to find work, however, she wrote that Japanese culture made marriage necessary, and gave more serious consideration to her suitors. ≈åyama Iwao in his middle age. In January 1882, Yamakawa wrote to Alice Bacon that one of the marriage proposals she had declined was from someone \\"I might have married for money and position but I resisted the temptation,\\" whom she later revealed to have been ≈åyama Iwao. At this time, ≈åyama was 40 years old, with three young daughters from a first marriage which had just ended with his wife's death in childbirth. He was also a wealthy and important general in the Imperial Japanese Army who had lived in Europe for three years, spoke French, and sought an intelligent and cosmopolitan wife. As a former Satsuma retainer, his military activity included serving as an artilleryman during the bombardment of Yamakawa's hometown of Aizu. He later liked to joke that Yamakawa had made the bullet which struck him during that battle. In February 1882, Yamakawa played Portia in an amateur production of the final two acts of The Merchant of Venice at a large party, which inspired Iwao to repeat his proposal. This time, he sent a formal request to her brothers, who were shocked. They immediately rejected him on Yamakawa's behalf because, as a Satsuma man, he was an enemy of Yamakawa's Aizu family. After several personal visits from Tsugumichi Saigo, a ranking Satsuma leader, Yamakawa's brothers were persuaded to let her decide. In April 1882, Yamakawa decided to accept him. They married in a small ceremony on November 8, 1883. At her marriage, Yamakawa became known as ≈åyama Sutematsu or Madame ≈åyama. ≈åyama Iwao and ≈åyama Sutematsu in their later years ≈åyama Iwao left Japan to study Prussian military systems early in 1884, relieving ≈åyama Sutematsu of the social duties of a minister's wife for the year he was away. In July 1884, the Peerage Act of 1884 made them Count and Countess ≈åyama. ≈åyama Iwao left Japan again in 1894, at the head of Japan's Second Army, for the First Sino-Japanese War. When the war concluded eight months later, the American press credited ≈åyama Sutematsu's influence for Japan's superiority to China. After the war, ≈åyama Iwao was promoted, and the couple became Marquess and Marchioness ≈åyama. ≈åyama Iwao served again in the Russo-Japanese War beginning in 1904, commanding troops in Manchuria. At the end of the war in 1905, his rank was raised again, to Prince, and ≈åyama Sutematsu finally became the \\"Japanese princess\\" which the American newspapers had once mistakenly called her, with her title becoming Princess ≈åyama. In 1915, the ≈åyamas attended the enthronement of Emperor Taish≈ç and received a memorial badge as guests to the ceremony of accession. During the ≈åyamas' marriage, they had two daughters, Hisako (born November 1884, later Baroness Ida Hisako) and Nagako (born prematurely in 1887, lived only two days), and two sons, Takashi (winter 1886 ‚Äì April 1908) and Kashiwa (born June 1889). ≈åyama Sutematsu was also a step-mother to ≈åyama Iwao's three daughters from his first marriage: Nobuko (c. 1876 ‚Äì May 1896) and two younger girls. Despite the fact that ≈åyama Sutematsu was not motivated by love when she accepted ≈åyama Iwao's proposal, her biographer Janice P. Nimura calls their marriage \\"unusually happy,\\" with ≈åyama Sutematsu as the intellectual equal and helpmeet of her husband. = Depiction in The Cuckoo = Beginning in 1898, a personal tragedy in ≈åyama's household became the subject of a bestselling novel, in which ≈åyama was depicted as a wicked stepmother. Author Kenjir≈ç Tokutomi's novel , or Nami-ko, written under the pen name R≈çka Tokutomi, is based on the marriage and death of ≈åyama Nobuko, one of ≈åyama Iwao's daughters with his first wife. ≈åyama Nobuko married Mishima Yatar≈ç in 1893, a love match which also united two powerful families. The winter after their marriage, Nobuko became ill with tuberculosis. Mishima's mother insisted that he divorce her, although he felt it was wrong, on the grounds that Nobuko would no longer be healthy enough to bear the heir which was necessary for an only son. While Nobuko was being nursed in the countryside, her parents agreed to a divorce, and the marriage was dissolved in the fall of 1895. Nobuko was moved back to her parents' house in Tokyo, where they built a new wing of their house for her to prevent transmission of the illness. ≈åyama Sutematsu was the subject of unsympathetic gossip for isolating her stepdaughter, which was seen as a punishing exile. Nobuko died in May 1896, age twenty. Tokutomi published his story based on these events in the newspaper Kokumin shinbun from November 1898 to May 1899. Tokutomi revised the story, and published it as a standalone book in 1900, which is when it became one of the most successful novels at the time, a major bestseller popular across many social groups for its elegant language and tear-jerking scenes. The novel is \\"most often remembered as a novel that protests the victimization of women, particularly the victimization of young brides,\\" blaming the Meiji era family system known as ie for the tragedy. In presenting this moral, the novel depicts the young couple in idealized terms, and is moderately sympathetic toward the character based on ≈åyama Iwao, but demonizes the characters based on Mishima's mother and on ≈åyama Sutematsu. ≈åyama Sutematsu's character is presented as jealous of her own stepdaughter, and a corrupting Western influence in her family.  Promotion of women's education and nursing  Tsuda Ume, Alice Mabel Bacon, Ury≈´ Shige, and ≈åyama Sutematsu (from left to right), c. 1901. After her marriage, ≈åyama took on the social responsibilities of a government official's wife, and advised the Empress on western customs, holding the official title of \\"Advisor on Westernization in the Court.\\" She also advocated for women's education and encouraged upper-class Japanese women to volunteer as nurses. She frequently hosted American visitors to advance Japanese-American relations, including Alice Bacon, the geographer Ellen Churchill Semple and the novelist Fannie Caldwell Macaulay. In 1888, ≈åyama was the subject of negative press from Japanese conservatives, and withdrew somewhat from public life. Positive press in 1895, at the conclusion of the First Sino-Japanese War (in which her husband had military victories and she had philanthropic success), returned her to the public eye. = Education = ≈åyama assisted Tsuda and Hirobumi Ito in establishing the Peeresses' School in Tokyo for high-ranking ladies, which opened on October 5, 1885. It was overseen by the new minister of education, Arinori Mori, who had frequently met with the girls of the Iwakura Mission while in America. In its first years, the school was a relatively conservative institution, where aristocratic students dressed in formal court dress and studied Japanese, Chinese literature, English or French, and history alongside the less academic subjects of morals, calligraphy, drawing, sewing, tea ceremony, flower arrangement, household management, and formal etiquette. From 1888‚Äì1889, Alice Bacon joined the school as an English teacher. At this point, the school began requiring Western dress for students. In 1900, she was a co-founder with Bacon and Tsuda Ume of the Women's Home School of English (or Joshi Eigaku Juku), to teach advanced studies and progressive Western ideals in English. At that time, women's only option for advanced study was the Women's Higher Normal School in Tokyo, which taught in Japanese and provided a more conservative curriculum. While Tsuda and Bacon worked as teachers, ≈åyama served as a patron of the school. Countess ≈åyama Sutematsu and her daughter ≈åyama Hisako at the first fundraising bazaar for Takaki Kanehiro's , 1887. Yamakawa discussed with Takaki the founding of training course and increase female healthcare workers, which would become . = Philanthropy = ≈åyama also promoted the idea of philanthropy (not a typical part of aristocratic Japanese life) to high- ranking Japanese ladies. In 1884, she hosted the first charity bazaar in Japan, raising funds for Tokyo's new Charity Hospital. Despite skepticism of the concept in the Japanese press, and suggestions that the activity was not ladylike, the bazaar was a financial success and became an annual event. In addition to promoting monetary charity, ≈åyama was active in volunteer nursing. She was Director of the Ladies Relief Association and the Ladies Volunteer Nursing Association, President of the Ladies Patriotic Association, and Chairman of the Japanese Red Cross Society. At the outbreak of the First Sino- Japanese War in 1894, she formed a committee of sixty aristocratic ladies to raise funds and gather supplies for the troops. ≈åyama herself rolled bandages for the Red Cross during this war, and worked again as a volunteer nurse during the Russo-Japanese War from 1904 to 1905. Death At ≈åyama Iwao's death on December 10, 1916, ≈åyama Sutematsu made her final retreat from public life, retiring to live in their son Kashiwa's household. She was not involved with the Red Cross during World War I. When the 1918 flu pandemic reached Tokyo in early 1919, ≈åyama sent her family to the countryside in Nasushiobara, but remained in Tokyo herself to oversee the Women's Home School of English (Joshi Eigaku Juku) and seek a replacement president after Tsuda's retirement. She fell ill on February 6, and died of related pneumonia on February 18, 1919.

Description Skull of modern Acinonyx jubatus. The giant cheetah was similar (note the small canines and domed frontal bone over large nasal passages). The lifestyle and physical characteristics of the giant cheetah were probably similar to those of its modern relative, except the giant cheetah was the height of a lion at the shoulder (but, due to its light build, it weighed considerably less than a lion). It was roughly twice the size of today's cheetahs, putting it at around , and about from head to rump, not including a tail. Its reconstructed shoulder height was at . Like the modern cheetah, the giant cheetah was likely a sprinter, but based on its proportions, was probably slower than the modern cheetah species. Just as with the modern cheetah, almost every aspect of Acinonyx pardinesis was specialized for running, though not as fast. The muzzle is short and the nasal passage large for increased air intake during a strenuous sprint. To make room for the enlarged nasal passage, the maxilla was reduced and the anchorage for the canine roots was less, resulting in shorter canine roots and a shorter, more stout external canine, a characteristic seen in the modern cheetah. As evidenced by Marco Cherin, Denis Geraads et al, the giant cheetah may have also had a stronger bite than modern cheetahs, perhaps enough to crush bone. To lighten the weight of the animal, bone girth is reduced and the skeleton is lean and light, excellent for running, but probably not for fighting or coping with injuries, severe or minor. Its thoracic cavity was consumed by large lungs and a powerful heart. The intestines were probably shorter, to lighten the animal, and muscles not used for running were reduced. The diaphragm was likely connected to the movement of its gait and with the stretching phase of a stride, the expansion of space in the abdominal cavity pulled the diaphragm down and forced the animal to inhale, while the contractile phase compressed the lungs and forced air out, so it had no control over its breathing while running, a commonality of most quadruped sprinters. Analysis of its skeleton indicates that the giant cheetah was intermediate in morphology between the swift-moving cheetahs and slower big cats; for one, its head was more proportionate to that of the cheetah's cougar-like ancestors in appearance and its limbs were relatively more robust than the modern cheetah. Indeed, the giant cheetah may have less resembled its modern cousin and instead have had more in common in regards to morphology with the modern snow leopard, whose skeletal proportions are very similar. Despite its longer legs and potential as a sprinter, the giant cheetah was overall less suited to speed than its modern relatives due to its intermediate build and greater mass One of the most complete skulls of this species is from the French site of Saint-Vallier, but the best collection of postcranial bones came from the older site of Perrier in the Massif Central, including vertebral column and long bones of one individual were found. However, the metacarpals were not recovered, so subsequent reconstructions depict them at the same length as the modern Acinonyx.Alan Turner (1997). The Big Cats And Their Fossil Relatives; An Illustrated Guide To Their Evolution And Natural History: 87 Distribution and habitat Giant cheetahs were present in Europe during the Early and Middle Pleistocene. The giant cheetah was found in Germany, France, and also in China and India. European cheetahs occurred alongside European jaguars and leopards at some Middle Pleistocene localities, and competition among the three possibly contributed to the cheetah's decline. Its large mass and more worn claws (when compared to modern cheetahs) suggest it was less adapted to climbing, an ability that would continue to evolve until modern-day cheetahs appeared. Paleobiology Restoration Within the same species, as shown in the modern South American jaguar (Panthera onca) and the Asian tiger (Panthera tigris), individuals in higher and colder areas grow to larger sizes. The fossil record for cheetahs is scarce. In contrast to Smilodon fatalis, severe injuries lead to death and there is no sign of cooperation as seen in the latter species of machairodont. Fossils suggest a lifestyle similar to the modern cheetah species: solitary, except for mothers and cubs and possibly siblings as seen with cheetah brothers, more specialized hunting tactics that narrow the number of species being hunted and therefore increasing the size of a territory and causing the species to be spread out more thinly than the much more adaptable modern leopard (Panthera pardus). Vertebrate paleontologist Alan Turner suggests, \\"since it had the bodily proportions of the living cheetah, and since running speed is a reflection of stride length for a given stride frequency, such large animals may also have been capable of running somewhat faster than their living relatives, although greater weight may have countered any advantage of greater size. Whether they needed to run faster is less clear.\\" The reason for A. pardinensis achieving large size could be to keep warm, to move faster, to subdue larger prey, or a combination of the three. On the same field as the modern cheetah, it would have been a relatively successful hunter, very wary of injuries, and rarely came into contact with others of its species. It would have been cautious, preferring fleeing to fighting, and would have been wary of large prey capable of injuring the cheetah. Cooperative hunting would generally have been unused, and mortality rates in the young would have been high. The modern cheetah must stop running after about 60 seconds, or when its body temperature rises over , and this large species would likely have had these confines, as well. =Hunting= Fossils, Paris It could have preyed upon anything from small, contemporary muntjac deer and mountainous ibex, to elk and possibly sambar, prey that was considerably larger than the modern cheetah's ideal prey, the Thomson's gazelle. The modern cheetah uses a specific hunting style seen nowhere else in the cat family: on open plains, it locates prey and walks directly towards a group or individual, without crouching, with head and tail down. When it comes within suitable distance (usually 50 yards,) it sprints forward. The chase is fast and takes many turns until the cheetah uses an enlarged dew claw to hook the hind leg of the prey or smack its flanks to either knock it off balance or damage its Achilles tendon. When the prey falls to the ground, the cheetah suffocates it with a throat clamp, and after resting, eats as much as it can on the spot before being chased off by larger predators or occasionally having eaten all it can. This sequence of a chase over an open area and the hooking of the back leg is unique and often necessary for the cheetah: prey that does not flee is addressed with a great deal of confusion on the cheetah's part and is often left unharmed if it cannot be coaxed to flee. . Depicting the possible forced inhalation and exhalation of Acinonyx while sprinting by shifting of abdominal (green) and thoracic (red) cavities beneath the skeleton (blue) Due to the skeletal structure of Acinonyx pardinensis, the larger species very likely used a similar approach to hunting; it, too, bore a large dew claw and the lean form was definitely built for running. A stalk, sprint, trip, and kill was probably a commonality of the large species' hunting tactics. The modern cheetah almost always uses a throat clamp to suffocate prey and this species of Acinonyx likely used this method of killing. Due to the small canines and weaker jaw muscles of both species, a muzzle clamp (seen in lions) or severing of the spinal cord (seen in jaguars) is generally not an option, so a throat clamp would have been used most prominently. The giant cheetah, being more powerful and possessed of a stronger set of jaws as evidenced by Geraads et al., probably was also able to crush the bones in the neck and skull of its victims. As it was heavier too, it would likely have been a slower runner than modern cheetahs, despite its longer legs. The giant cheetah, like the modern cheetah, seemed to avoid eating bone based on the evidence of its carnassial teeth, and it was a fast eater that likely could consume a great deal of flesh before another predator, such as hyenas, the machairodont Homotherium, or wolves arrived to drive the cat from its kill.

The area is part of greater Fort Washington. The area was settled by Europeans in the 1660s and the town was created in 1706 when the colonial Maryland Legislature authorized surveying and laying out the towns of Queen Anne Town, Nottingham, Mill Town, Piscataway, Aire (also known as Broad Creek) and Upper Marlboro (then known as Marlborough Town). In 1747, the legislature tried to improve the quality and the method of marketing tobacco, then the major crop of the area, and established a formal system of tobacco inspection and quality control. The town was home to one of seven state tobacco warehouses built in Prince George's County. The site is located south of the U.S. Capitol building on the Potomac River. Today, this \\"first footprint\\" of settlement in the capital area is a Prince George's County Historic District, with three 17th century homesites and an 18th-century Episcopal Church structure.

Edmond Beales Biography Edmond Beales was the son of Samuel Pickering Beales, a merchant of Newnham, Cambridgeshire and was born on 3 July 1803. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, gaining a B.A. in 1825 and an M.A. in 1828. He became a barrister in 1830. He married Elizabeth, the daughter of James Marshall, manager of the Provincial Bank of Ireland. Beales is best known as the President of the Reform League who campaigned for representation of the working classes in parliament and whose efforts culminated in the Reform Act 1867. The League is principally remembered for two great demonstrations in Hyde Park both of which were banned by the Government. At the first, on 23 July 1866, the League resolved to assemble at Marble Arch outside the Park and attempt to enter. A massive crowd assembled at the Arch and Beales attempted to enter the Park. The police prevented this amid scuffles. Part of the crowd then pulled down the railings and entered the Park. Three days of what are variously described as \\"skirmishes\\" or \\"riots\\" ensued.Foot, Paul. The Vote. Penguin. 2006 pp 148-9Harrison Royden. Before The Socialists. Routledge and Keegan Paul. 1965 p 82 The disturbances ceased after Beales met with the Home Secretary and offered to talk the revellers into leaving the Park. The second great Hyde Park rally was on 6 May 1867. The rally was again banned by the Government but they were unable to stop it taking place due to the massive numbers who turned out. The procession started off from the Reform League's headquarters, at 8 Adelphi Terrace, headed by a cab containing Beales, his friend Colonel Dickson and a few other aristocratic supporters. As they headed up Regent Street it was decided that these gentlemen would visit Gunter's Tea Shop in Berkeley Square and so left the procession. This left John Bedford Leno and a few others, at the head of the procession who proceeded to face the police at Marble Arch and to hold the famous 1867 Hyde Park demonstration. Edmond died at Osborne House, Bolton Gardens South, Brompton, Middlesex on 26 June 1881. Professor Harrison wrote of Beales that he was \\"one of the revising barristers for Middlesex until he was deprived of his appointment. He enjoyed an unequalled prestige among all sections of working class reformers. It was correctly said that 'he lost his practice, his office, his voice, his health in the people's cause.'\\",Harrison p 140 Career * 25 Jun 1830 - Barrister M.T.

Several of Sir Percy's descendants adopted the identity of the Black Knight: Sir Raston, active during the late 6th and early 7th century, who eventually became an agent of the time traveler Kang the Conqueror; and Sir Eobar Garrington, a 12th-century knight serving under Richard the Lionheart during the Third Crusade.

The screenplay by Herbert Sargent was adapted from the 1964 novel To an Early Grave by Wallace Markfield. Plot When idealistic minor author Leslie Braverman dies suddenly from a heart attack at the age of 41, his four best friends decide to attend his funeral. The quartet of Jewish intellectuals drawn from the four corners of Manhattan consists of public relations writer Morroe Rieff from the Upper East Side, poet Barnet Weinstein from the Lower East Side, book reviewer Holly Levine from the Lower West Side, and Yiddish writer (and chronic complainer) Felix Ottensteen from the Upper West Side. The men have been friends since their youth. They agree to meet at Christopher Park on Sheridan Square, a Greenwich Village landmark, from which they travel in Levine's cramped Volkswagen Beetle. Due to confusion and bad directions from Braverman's widow, the men attend the wrong funeral but finally arrive at the cemetery in time for the burial. There is an extensive running discussion along the way about everything from philosophical observations regarding death to the relative merits of classic comic book characters, all while maintaining a strongly Jewish comedic tone emphasizing irony and sarcasm. Rieff, who emerges as the central character, periodically experiences absurdist fantasy episodes or daydreams involving his own mortality, eventually delivering a soliloquy to a vast array of gravestones bringing the dead up to date on what they have missed lately. The character Leslie Braverman never actually appears, by flashback or otherwise, and is known only through descriptions and references to him by other characters. (Braverman's coffin is shown briefly, with him presumably inside, at the cemetery.) While Braverman is dead from the outset in both the book and the movie, there are occasions in the book but not the movie where his own words are quoted, often at considerable length as from a letter. Production The Warner Bros.-Seven Arts release was filmed on location in Manhattan, the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, and Cedar Grove Cemetery in Flushing. The movie is notable for its gritty but romanticized and picturesque portrayal of New York City as it was in the 1960s, showing elevated train tracks and bodegas and using numerous aerial shots. In the meeting scene at Sheridan Square, the office of The Village Voice newspaper, a landmark there for decades until a later move, is visible. A scene where the mourners stop to use a pay telephone takes place in front of one of the legendary Big Daddy's Restaurants then located on Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn. The scene of a traffic accident between the Volkswagen Beetle and a Checker cab takes place at the intersection of Eastern Parkway and Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn, and the Town Hill Restaurant nightclub on the corner, notable at the time for its live entertainment, can be seen prominently in the background. Literary inspirations and allusions Dalkey Archive Press editor Jeremy M. Davies, in connection with reprints of Markfield's books, has called him \\"The Joyce of Brighton Beach,\\" suggesting by analogy a comparison between Markfield and this quintessentially Jewish neighborhood and the essential literary synergy between James Joyce and his native Dublin, but also suggesting other connections. The structure of Markfield's To an Early Grave, and therefore of the movie based upon it, is to some extent a comic parallel of Joyce's novel Ulysses, specifically \\"Episode 6\\" (which is commonly known as the \\"Hades\\" chapter) where protagonist Leopold Bloom and three friends travel in a carriage to attend the funeral of Patrick \\"Paddy\\" Dignam who has died in a drunken stupor. The fantasy or flashback experiences of Morroe Rieff mirror Joyce's stream of consciousness writing style. In turn, Joyce's Dignam character is generally regarded as an echo of Elpenor in the Odyssey from ancient Greece. Stanford University professor Steven J. Zipperstein, writing about the author Isaac Rosenfeld, has stated that the character of Leslie Braverman was modeled on the real-life Rosenfeld, who died of a heart attack at age 38 in 1956. Zipperstein notes that Rosenfeld's premature death in failed circumstances is mentioned prominently in the memoirs of many who, like Markfield, were in the Partisan Review literary circle, including Alfred Kazin, Irving Howe, and William Phillips. Rosenfeld has also been acknowledged, according to Zipperstein, as the model for the character of King Dahfu in the 1959 novel Henderson the Rain King by Saul Bellow; Rosenfeld and Bellow had been friends since their teenage years.

It hardly ever works in fiction, and it does not seem the best vehicle for his movies at all.\\"The New York Times review Pauline Kael described it as \\"a crudely affectionate comic romp.

But what picture there is for stealing is burgled by Wiseman with his portrayal of a stereotypical litterateur.\\"Time review According to the Time Out London Film Guide, the film is \\"a little unfocused but bristles with Jewish wit and fine performances.\\"Time Out London Film Guide Home media The film was released on DVD in April 2009 as part of the Warner Archive series.

The entire wedding process is concluded through a song 'Madarangiyalli' and the story moves on to Akash going on to spend his first night with Anjali. However, the story takes a dramatic twist here when Anjali right away demands divorce from Akash. Akash, instead of showing any kind of frustration, calmly agrees to give Anjali her divorce, on the condition that only after they move to Bangalore. Akash also requests Anjali to keep this as a secret from his parents, as he fears they wouldn't be able to handle it. Anjali agrees, and it is shown that Anjali was never interested in the wedding as she was already in love with Hemant (Dilip Raj), whom she is also struggling to find after her father forbade her to see him again. The story shifts to Bangalore where it is shown that Akash is a popular Radio Jockey for the station Radio Mirchi. As the days pass, Akash and Anjali face off on various fronts, clearly letting the viewer know that their marriage is on the rocks. However, when Akash rescues his neighbor from a local rowdy (Shobaraj) Anjali realizes that Akash is not such a bad person after all. She requests Akash to help her find Hemant, to which he agrees. Soon, Akash manages to locate Hemant, and also keeps his word by applying for divorce, and as per the rules, the court grants them 6 (six) months time if they want to reconsider their application.

Post this event, Akash and Anjali undergo a transformation where Akash manages to win Anjali's respect, and soon they become the best of friends. Soon enough, Anjali realizes that she has fallen in love with Akash, who has helped her through so much of hardships. However, she realizes that she cannot express her love to him as it would make her look small in Akash's eyes. Caught in a perpetual emotional dilemma, she struggles to hide her feelings from Akash. A few days later, the court summons them and approves their divorce. Anjali is once again devastated as Akash feels no remorse in signing the papers.

It covers an area of 392 hectares (970 acres) and lies about south-west of Exeter and north-east of Bovey Tracey. The parish, with a population of 262 in 2001, lacks a compact village, but consists of scattered dwellings. The name Dunchideock is of Celtic origin. Recorded in Domesday as Donsedoc, the two parts of the name derive from dun (fort) and coediog (wooded), which, according to W. G. Hoskins, refer to the nearby Iron Age hill fort of Cotley Castle, though the Roman fort at , near Ide, is closer. The parish church is dedicated to St Michael and is Grade I listed. It originated in 1308 at the latest, but the present church building, built of red sandstone, was started in the late 14th century. It has been partially rebuilt and restored many times. There is a good font dated to around 1400, some notable carved bench-ends, roof-bosses and rood-screen; and several memorials, most notably to Aaron Baker, who rebuilt the chancel aisle in 1669, and Stringer Lawrence. The theological writer Bourchier Wrey Savile was rector of Dunchideock with Shillingford St. George from 1872 to his death in 1888. Within the parish was the former Haldon House which was the home of Sir Robert Palk, 1st Baronet. Mostly demolished in the 1920s, the remaining wing is now the Best Western \\"Lord Haldon Hotel\\". Also in the parish is Haldon Belvedere, a triangular tower on top of Haldon that was built by Palk in 1788 in memory of his friend General Stringer Lawrence. Archie Winckworth, the former owner of Dunchideock House, posted a memoir about the village and its history, including an account of its buried treasure.

The 2011 Census recorded the population as 540. History The Domesday Book of 1086 records the toponym as Tatituna or Tatistuna. It the location of Tattingstone Place and the folly known as the Tattingstone Wonder. The parish has three distinct settlements. The main settlement includes the church, Tattingstone Park and the former Samford House of Industry, or Workhouse (1766‚Äì1930). This site was used as St Mary's hospital until it was redeveloped for housing in 1991. Tattingstone Heath is located on the A137, whilst a small hamlet close to the White Horse is connected to the rest of the parish by Lemons Hill bridge over the western end of Alton reservoir. The Tattingstone Estate was bequeathed to Mr Western by his father's first cousin Thomas White in 1808. Tattingstone Church (OS grid TM1337) has a vault dedicated for Thomas Western (died 1814) and his wife Guilietta Roman (died 1850) and Thomas White (died 1808). The church was robbed on Thursday, 16 October 2008. =Tattingstone suitcases murder= In 1967 the remains of murder victim Bernard Oliver were found in suitcases in a field in Tattingstone on 16 January 1967, 10 days after his family reported him missing. Nobody was ever charged, though two now deceased doctors were considered prime suspects. Reservoir The village was split into two halves in the 1970s when the valley was flooded to make a reservoir. Alton Mill which once stood in the way of the development was dismantled and re-erected at the Museum of East Anglian Life in Stowmarket. However, Tattingstone Alton Hall was not preserved and disappeared into the water. Over twenty houses and two farms were flooded to make way for the reservoir. The pavilion which resides on the playing field in the village was constructed using the doors and some of the structural timbers from the boat house that was situated on the lakes that were in the valley prior to the flooding. The pavilion was built by five local men who used to live in the village. The reservoir is managed by Anglian Water and is known as Alton Water or Alton Reservoir. It is now a haven for wildlife and is used by cyclists, walkers and fishermen and for other watersports. Notable buildings There are twenty listed buildings in the parish, two of which are grade II* listed; the church of St Mary and the Tattingstone Wonder. The Tattingstone Wonder is a strange folly built in about 1790 for local Squire, Edward White, who then lived in the Hall. Originally a pair of cottages, a third was added together with a mock church tower and facade to give his neighbours \\"something to wonder at\\". Tattingstone Folly from rear The village has two pubs, the Wheatsheaf and the White Horse but the Orange Box (formally called the Waterloo House, opposite the school) was closed and demolished in 2000 along with village shop and post office which were part of the same building.

Biography Helen Naha was the daughter-in-law of Paqua Naha (the first Frog Woman). Helen was married to Paqua‚Äôs son Archie. She was mostly self-taught, following the style of her mother-in-law and sister-in-law Joy Navasie (second Frog Woman). Her designs are often based on fragments found at the Awatovi ruins near Hopi. Her hallmark style was finely polished, hand- coiled pottery finished in white slip with black and red decorations. She would often take the extra step to polish the inside of a piece as well as the outside. She signed her pottery with a feather glyph. This resulted in her being called ‚ÄúFeather Woman‚Äù by many collectors. Both of her daughters, Sylvia and Rainy (Rainell), as well as her granddaughter Tyra Naha are well known potters. Today, her medium to larger pots typically sell for several thousand dollars. She has been recognized by the Southwestern Association for Indian Arts for her body of work through the creation of the Helen Naha Memorial Award - For Excellence in Traditional Hopi Pottery.

In 2001, 563 people lived within the civil parish, decreasing to 531 at the 2011 census. Geography The River Tamar forms the eastern boundary of the civil parish, as well as the Cornish boundary with Devon. Parish church The parish church is dedicated to St Swithin: nearby, in the wooded valley is the holy well of St Swithin. There are two aisles but the arcades differ: while the north is of granite the south is of older Polyphant stone. The fine series of over 60 benchends is from the same workshop as those of Kilkhampton and Poughill. Other features of interest are the medieval wall painting and the tomb of Sir John Chamond, 1624.Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall, 2nd ed. Penguin Books; p. 95 The church also features an unusual post-Reformation wall painting which has been dated between 1680-1690. The Ringers of Launcells Tower; painting by Frederick Smallfield Charles Henderson writing in 1925 gives the dedication as to St Andrew. The origin of the name Launcells is probably from Lan- and a personal name Kellys. In the early Middle Ages the church belonged to Hartland Abbey and there are records of a dispute over the building of the chancel in 1382 which required episcopal intervention.

Cah√©n is best known as a member of Painters Eleven, a group of abstract artists active in Toronto from 1953-1960, and for his fifteen years of work as an illustrator of Canadian magazines. Early Years Cah√©n was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. His parents were Eugenie Caroline Auguste Stamm and Fritz Max Cah√©n, a well known anti- Nazi activist. Cah√©n was trained in Europe at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts from March 1932 to August 1933 in the academy studio of Max Frey. In 1938 he taught in Prague at the Rotter-Schule f√ºr Werbegrafik before escaping the Nazi occupation by traveling to England in 1939. He worked as an editorial illustrator during the war and began painting, moving to abstract works that were described at the time as expressing modern life. Considered German by the British, he was interned in Britain and sent to Canada in 1940 as an enemy alien with other Europeans of Jewish descent. His artistic contacts in Canada secured his release in October 1942, and he worked in Montr√©al at advertising firm Rapid, Grip and Batten before moving to Toronto in late 1944 to become art editor for Magazine Digest. Cah√©n subsequently worked as a freelance illustrator for magazines such as Maclean's, Chatelaine and New Liberty. As an illustrator, Cah√©n won five medals and six awards of merit from the Toronto Art Directors Club, 1949‚Äì1957. Painters Eleven In the late 1940s he met Walter Yarwood, Harold Town and others involved in avant-garde art in Toronto, and Cah√©n was included in the Abstracts at Home display held in 1953 at the Robert Simpson Company, Toronto. He formed Painters Eleven with ten other abstract painters (most of whom had also been in the Abstracts At Home event) soon after. In Canada's conservative art world their early exhibitions were met with disdain. Nevertheless, Painters Eleven attracted U.S. exposure with a successful exhibition, Twentieth Annual Exhibition of American Abstract Artists with 'Painters Eleven' of Canada in 1956, with the American Abstract Artists at the Riverside Museum in New York, and were praised by the influential critic Clement Greenberg on a visit he paid to the group in Toronto in 1957. In the Canadian press, the group's most ardent supporter was art critic Robert Fulford. Cah√©n was killed in a car accident in Oakville, Ontario in 1956 and the group formally disbanded in 1960. Painting Technique and Colour Sense Cah√©n had an unusual ability to move from one medium to another and from representational to abstract idioms with equal success. Perhaps his most original contribution was a technique he called ‚Äúmonoetching,‚Äù which involved applying a thin layer of wax to an illustration board which he then scratched through with a needle. He would then apply a water-based pigment overtop which would seep through the scratches into the exposed board beneath. However, more than any other of his talents, Cah√©n is probably best remembered today for his colour sense, as his best known works often combined orange and pink along with reds, blues and greens.

In his work, he often used a high horizon line as a structural element. Early life and career Born in Watford, United Kingdom, Mead studied under John Nash and Randolph Schwab at the Slade School of Art in London, graduating in 1939. During World War II, he moved to New York where he trained American pilots in combat flying. Sometime around 1943, he went to New York and first saw American abstraction in the work of Stuart Davis. In 1946 he moved to Hamilton, Ontario, where he befriended Hortense Gordon, who with him became a member of Painters Eleven. Later, in Toronto, he worked for Maclaren Advertising as art director. In 1958, Mead moved to Montreal to work at the Maclaren\`s branch there, and became associated, through the dealer of his Montreal gallery, Denyse Delrue, with Quebec abstract artists such as Guido Molinari and Claude Tousignant who also showed their work with her. These artists had an influence on him, as did Robert Motherwell. Mead\`s finely-tuned work has been called \\"a dry-martini sort of art\\". Having returned to Toronto in 1967, he worked continuously until his death in 1998 in Toronto. A posthumous retrospective of his work was held at the Howard Scott Gallery in New York City in 1998.

He is best known as a member of Painters Eleven a group of abstract artists active in Toronto from 1954-1960. Town coined the name of the group, which was based simply on the number of artists that were present the first meeting.Fulford, \\"Introduction\\" He also worked as an illustrator, a profession he credited with imparting a sense of discipline that would last throughout his entire artistic career. His early illustrative appeared in magazines such as Maclean's and Mayfair. Life and work Harold Town was trained at Western Technical-Commercial School and Ontario College of Art, both in Toronto. The Royal Ontario Museum was an early source of inspiration, especially its East Asian prints and ceramics, and the Mesopotamian and Egyptian antiquities. His exposure to the diverse artistry of these works gave Town what he called a global horizon, a new outlook, which would influence his work as a commercial artist and inspire his first attempts at abstract art. His early work also reflected his interest in Pablo Picasso and Willem de Kooning.Harold Town, The Canadian Encyclopedia, accessed August 29, 2019 Town developed his own innovative collage technique, which was highly acclaimed His collages have been described by Gerta Moray in Harold Town: Life & Work as similar to his paintings in the way they resemble areas of drawing in ink or paint. He also juxtaposed contrasting or unexpected textures and fragments taken from everyday sources, that lead the viewer to unexpected viewing. Known as an unpredictable painter Town's work moved quickly from a dark expressionist style to abstraction which contrasted vivid colours.Fulford, \\"Introduction\\" Highly eclectic, Town‚Äôs work rigorously explored a wide range of contemporary and historical styles, anticipating postmodern practices. His pluralistic artistic method incorporated a variety of media and styles simultaneously, and assimilated complex artistic traditions, which he used to reflect his own personal experience. In the 1960s, Town developed a style of prints which he called Single Autographic Prints, a phrase he never explained. These monotype prints were colourful and delicate, winning Town awards in Ljubljana, Yugoslavia and Santiago, Chile, where the prints were acquired by the Solomon Guggenheim Museum and the Museum of Modern Art. Alfred Barr, the director of Museum of Modern Art at the time, called Town one of the world's greatest printmakers. Roald Nasgaard describes these prints as being of great finesse and subtlety.Roald Nasgaard, Abstract Painting in Canada, p.104 Described as a Canadian loyalist, Harold Town was unwavering in his commitment to proving that internationally important and innovative art could develop in Toronto. Through his early success and his insistence on maintaining his roots in Toronto, Town helped foster a new confidence and maturity in the Canadian art scene of the late 1950s. Honours Town was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. In 1956, works by Town along with those of Jack Shadbolt and Louis Archambault represented Canada at the Venice Biennale. In 1964, Town and Elza Mayhew were chosen to represent Canada in the Venice Biennale. Town's work also represented Canada at the S√£o Paulo Art Biennial in 1957 and 1961. He was recognized with the Biennale de S√£o Paulo‚Äôs Arno Award in 1957. York University granted him an honorary doctorate in 1966. He was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1968. Town had retrospective exhibitions at the Art Gallery of Windsor in 1975 and the Art Gallery of Ontario in 1986. The Harold Town Conservation Area in Peterborough ON is named after Town, who owned this property from the mid 1970s until the early 1990s; it was previously referred to as, Old Orchard Farm. Town enjoyed this property as his personal retreat until his passing. On April 11, 1994, the property was donated to Otonabee Conservation by Town‚Äôs estate. The property was then named in his memory and was dedicated as a park for public purposes, as requested by the estate. https://www.otonabeeconservation.com/camping-outdoor- recreation/harold-town/ Painters Eleven In the late 1940s Town met Walter Yarwood and others involved in avant-garde art in Toronto and although he was not included in the Abstracts at Home exhibition held in 1953 at the Robert Simpson Company, Toronto, he joined Painters Eleven when the group was formed later that year.

Johnson. It was the first book exclusively on the theory of NP-completeness and computational intractability. The book features an appendix providing a thorough compendium of NP-complete problems (which was updated in later printings of the book). The book is now outdated in some respects as it does not cover more recent development such as the PCP theorem. It is nevertheless still in print and is regarded as a classic: in a 2006 study, the CiteSeer search engine listed the book as the most cited reference in computer science literature. Open problems Another appendix of the book featured problems for which it was not known whether they were NP-complete or in P (or neither). The problems (with their original names) are: # Graph isomorphism #:This problem is known to be in NP, but it is unknown if it is NP-complete. # Subgraph homeomorphism (for a fixed graph H) # Graph genus # Chordal graph completion # Chromatic indexNP- complete: # Spanning tree parity problemIn P: # Partial order dimension # Precedence constrained 3-processor scheduling #:This problem was still open as of 2016. # Linear programming # Total unimodularityIn P: # Composite number #:Testing for compositeness is known to be in P, but the complexity of the closely related integer factorization problem remains open. # Minimum length triangulationIs NP-hard: #: Problem 12 is known to be NP-hard, but it is unknown if it is in NP. Reception Soon after it appeared, the book received positive reviews by reputed researchers in the area of theoretical computer science. In his review, Ronald V. Book recommends the book to \\"anyone who wishes to learn about the subject of NP-completeness\\", and he explicitly mentions the \\"extremely useful\\" appendix with over 300 NP-hard computational problems.

In many respects it is hard to imagine a better treatment of the subject.\\" Also, he considers the appendix as \\"unique\\" and \\"as a starting point in attempts to show new problems to be NP-complete\\".Harry R.

Publication history Professor Nathan Garrett debuted as the modern-day supervillain Black Knight in Tales to Astonish vol. 1, #52 (Feb. 1964). This villainous Black Knight appeared in The Avengers vol. 1, #6, 14-15 (July 1964, March‚ÄìApril 1965), and in the \\"Iron Man\\" feature in Tales of Suspense vol. 1, #73 (Jan. 1966), in which he was mortally wounded. Fictional character biography Professor Nathan Garrett is the distant direct descendant of Sir Percy, and was born in London, England. He becomes a biologist, research scientist, and university professor. He then became the head of an espionage ring, and was captured by the hero Giant-Man. Garrett fled to Europe, where he found Sir Percy's tomb and the Ebony Blade. Garrett's evil tendencies make him unworthy of wielding the sword, and he is shunned by Sir Percy's ghost. The embittered Garrett then devises an arsenal of medieval weapons that employ modern technology (including a lance that fired bolts of energy) and genetically engineers and creates a winged horse called Aragorn. Calling himself the \\"Black Knight\\", Garrett embarks on a career as a professional criminal to spite his ancestor.

Bacon. From the Liljenquist Family Collection of Civil War Photographs, Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress USS Midnight (1861) was a steamer purchased by the Union Navy during the American Civil War. She was planned by the Union Navy for use as a gunboat stationed off Confederate waterways to prevent their trading with foreign countries. Midnight was purchased as Dawn by the Navy at New York City 31 July 1861 and commissioned at New York Navy Yard 19 October 1861, Acting Volunteer Lt. James Trathen in command.  Assigned to the Gulf Blockade  Assigned to the Gulf Blockading Squadron 2 November 1861, Midnight operated primarily along the southwestern coast of Texas, from time to time engaging Confederate coastal batteries as she served the Union blockade.  Faithful service deserves faithful comments by Farragut  Her faithful performance of duty in an area remote and neglected by war correspondents, illustrates the hardship often suffered by American sailors during the Civil War, in August 1862, as he reported sending Midnight home, Admiral Farragut commented: > The Midnight has been most active on the west coast of Texas and has been > now constantly on blockade 9 months, during which time she has only had > fresh provision 24 days ... Forty cases of scurvy, and dysentery [make it] > impossible for such a crew to recruit in this climate.  Overhauled, Midnight is assigned to the South Atlantic Blockade  Overhauled and her crew restored to health, Midnight arrived Port Royal, South Carolina, 16 October for service in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. For almost 2 years she continued this duty, a strong link in the chain which the Union Navy had forged and was drawing ever tighter around the Confederacy. On 3 February 1864 she captured British schooner Defy off Doboy Light, Georgia, sailing from Nassau to Beaufort, North Carolina with a cargo of salt for the South. Midnight was ordered to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 2 August for repairs.  Reassigned to the East Gulf Blockade  Midnight's last tour of duty took her to the East Gulf Blockading Squadron early in the fall. Besides serving in the blockade, she from time to time sent landing parties ashore in the vicinity of St. Andrews Bay, to gather information and to destroy Confederate resources.  The value and necessity of salt  Salt works were Midnight's favorite targets. Vast quantities of salt were needed by the South to preserve meat, fish and other perishable foods; to cure hides; and to bolster the Southern munitions industry. The Union Navy's systematic attacks on salt works seriously impaired the Confederacy's ability to remain at war. Midnight's most successful expedition began 1 February when a party landed at St. Andrews Bay. Three days later they returned to the ship, after destroying beyond repair several large salt plants and dumping tons of the precious chemical into the sea. Midnight served at St. Andrews Bay through the end of the war. She sailed north early in July and was sold at public auction in Boston, Massachusetts, to C. H. Miller 1 November 1865.

The reaction is a strongly acid- catalyzed carbonylation using carbon monoxide, and typically occurs at high pressures ranging from 50 to 5,000 kPa, often requiring temperatures several hundred degrees higher than room temperature. Generally the reaction is conducted with strong mineral acids such as sulfuric acid, HF or BF3.Koch, H.; Haaf, W. Ann. 1958, \\"618\\", 251‚Äì266.() Large scale operations for the fine chemical industry produce almost 150,000 tonnes of Koch acids and their derivatives annuallyWeissermel, K., Jargen-Arpe, H.

() but also generate a great deal of waste, motivating ongoing attempts to use metal, solid acid, and other novel catalysts to enable the use of milder reaction conditions. Formic acid, which readily decomposes to carbon monoxide in the presence of acids or relatively low heat, is often used instead of carbon monoxide directly; this procedure was developed shortly after the Koch reaction and is more commonly referred to as the Koch‚ÄìHaaf reaction. This variation allows for reactions at nearly standard room temperature and pressure. Some commonly industrially produced Koch acids include pivalic acid, 2,2-dimethylbutyric acid and 2,2-dimethylpentanoic acid. The Koch reaction Mechanism When standard acid catalysts such as sulfuric acid or a mix of BF3 and HF are used, the mechanismLi, J. J. In \\"Koch‚ÄìHaaf carbonylation\\"; Name Reactions, 4th ed.; Springer, Berlin, 2009; p. 319. () begins by protonation of the alkene, followed by carbon monoxide attack of the resulting carbocation. The subsequent acylium cation is then hydrolysed to the tertiary carboxylic acid. If the substrate is an alcohol, it is protonated and subsequently eliminated, generating a carbocation that is converted to an acylium cation by carbon monoxide and then hydrolysed. Tertiary carbocation formation is typically thermodynamically favored when considering hydride or alkyl shifts in the carbocation. Catalyst usage and variations Industrial large scale application of the Koch reaction using strong mineral acids is complicated by equipment corrosion, separation procedures for products and difficulty in managing large amounts of waste acid. Several acid resinsTsumori, N., Xu, Q., Souma, Y., Mori, H. J. Mol. Cat. A, 2002, 179, 271‚Äì77. ()Xu, Q., Inoue, S., Tsumori, N., Mori, H., Kameda, M., Fujiwara, M., Souma, Y. J. Mol. Cat.

() have been investigated in order to discover if Koch acids can be synthesized in more mild environments. Although the use of acidic ionic liquids for the Koch reaction requires relatively high temperatures and pressures (8 MPa and 430 K in one 2006 study), acidic ionic solutions themselves can be reused with only a very slight decrease in yield, and the reactions can be carried out biphasically to ensure easy separation of products. A large number of transition metal catalyst carbonyl cations have also been investigated for usage in Koch-like reactions: Cu(I),Souma, Y. Sano, H., Iyoda, J. J. Org. Chem., 1973, 38, 2016.

() carbonyl cations catalysts dissolved in sulfuric acid can allow the reaction to progress at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Usage of a Nickel tetracarbonyl catalyst with CO and water as a nucleophile is known as the Reppe carbonylation, and there are many variations on this type of metal- mediated carbonylation used in industry, particularly those used by Monsanto and the Cativa processes, which convert methanol to acetic acid using acid catalysts and carbon monoxide in the presence of metal catalysts. Side reactions Koch reactions can involve a large number of side products, although high yields are generally possible (Koch and Haaf reported yields of over 80% for several alcohols in their 1958 paper). Carbocation rearrangements, etherization (in case an alcohol is used as a substrate, instead of an alkene), and occasionally substrate CN+1 carboxylic acids are observed due to fragmentation and dimerization of carbon monoxide-derived carbenium ions, especially since each step of the reaction is reversible.Stepanov, A. G., Luzgin, M. V., Romannikov, V. N., Zamaraev, K. I. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1995, 117, 3615‚Äì16.

The family originated with Ivon Vane, who was a Welsh landowner and mercenary captain in the service of the Black Prince. Ivon Vane or John Fane, as he was known in English, was one of three captains who captured King John II of France at the battle of Poitiers 1356. He was knighted and shared in the ransom monies, which made him very wealthy. He settled in Kent and founded the two notable families of Fane, whose members became the Earls of Westmoreland, and Vane, who became the Earls of Darlington. Both families have golden gauntlets on their crest in memory of the surrender of King John. The family were Kentish gentry until Sir Thomas Fane (d 1589) made one of the most advantageous marriages of the Tudor period when he made his second wife Mary, daughter of Henry Nevill, 6th Baron Bergavenny. Mary was one of the great Tudor heiresses, she was the last heiress to the mediaeval House of Neville and one of England's largest landowners. Mary inherited the titles of Baron le Despenser and Baron Bergavenny from her father, whilst her son choose the title of Earl of Westmoreland when he was raised to that rank by James I of England. The original Neville Earldom of Westmoreland had been confiscated in 1571 from Mary Fane's cousin Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland for his part in the Rising of the North. The family went on to produce over 50 Members of Parliament, as well soldiers, bankers, imperial administrators as well as some notable writers. The family married judiciously and inherited estates in Northamptonshire, Lincolnshire, Dorset, Somerset, Devon, Oxfordshire as well as retaining their original lands in Kent. Sir Francis Fane of Fulbeck was one of the founding investors in the Virginia Company that settled the new world and the family were also large landowners in Canada, mainly on Prince Edward Island, and South Africa, as well as having extensive business interests in India. The family were much involved in India as administrators, employees of the East India company as well as soldiers. Two Indian regiments were raised by family members, including Fane's Horse, as well as producing a Commander- in-Chief of all British forces in India and the West Indies. The family owned a number of family seats, including: * Apethorpe Hall Northamptonshire * Mereworth Castle Kent * Fulbeck Hall Lincolnshire * Fulbeck Manor Lincolnshire * Wormsley Park Oxfordshire * Basildon Park Berkshire * Osterley Park Middlesex * Brympton d'Evercy Somerset * Clovelly Devon * Avon Tyrell Hampshire See also * Fane (surname) * Vane (surname) References * The Gentleman's magazine, Volume 94, Part 1 p. 180 * Collins's peerage of England; genealogical, biographical, and ..., Volume 4 * Collins's peerage of England; genealogical, biographical, and ..., Volume 3 * Debrett's complete peerage of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland * Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: or, A dictionary of arts, sciences, and ..., Volume 10 * London Gazette: no. 28469, p. 1470, 24 February 1911. * Calendar of Sales at Sotheby's retrieved 10 May 2007 Category:English families ","title":"Fane family"},{"id":"14054853","text":"The 2006 Northwestern Wildcats football team represented Northwestern University in the Big Ten Conference during the 2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season.

This has resulted in the river being straightened and canalized between ramparts of dredge material making access to the river difficult and compromising its value as a public amenity. The river is an important spawning channel for salmon and trout and a noted fishery in its own right for both species. Many young teenagers also swim in it during the summer.

Following Musharraf's resignation, the judiciary was restored in 2009. On 31 July 2009, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled that the taking oath on PCO was not legal and that Justice Dogar was never a Constitutional Chief Justice of Pakistan as the office of the Chief Justice of Pakistan was never vacant by the de jure Chief Justice, hence treated him the de facto Chief Justice of Pakistan by protecting his all administrative, financial acts and any oath made before him in the ordinary course of affairs of the office of the Chief Justice of Pakistan, except the recommendations made by him in respect of appointments and reappointments for the offices of the superior judges. Following the Proclamation of Emergency by General Pervez Musharraf as Chief of Army Staff, on 3 November 2007., Justice Dogar took oath on Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) and was administered the oath of office of Chief Justice of Pakistan. Life Justice Dogar was born in the village of Gaarhi Mori, in Khairpur District, Sindh province. He passed LL.B. from Law College, Punjab University, Lahore in 1969. He was enrolled as Advocate in 1970 and practiced law for 25 years before his elevation to judiciary.

Judicial career Mr Dogar joined the judicial service on 10 April 1995 with an appointment to the Sindh High Court. He was elevated to the Supreme Court on 28 April 2000. Following the Proclamation of Emergency by Chief of Army Staff General Pervez Musharraf, Dogar was appointed as Chief Justice of Pakistan. He took oath on Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) on 3 November 2007. Earlier a 7-member bench of the Supreme Court had overturned the PCO. Dogar was one of the only four sitting judges in Supreme Court who immediately took oath under the PCO 2007 on 3 November 2007, when the majority of Supreme Court judges refused to take oath under the PCO. The others judges who took the PCO oath with him were Muhammad Nawaz Abbasi, Faqir Muhammad Khokhar and M. Javed Buttar. Later in the evening, in Karachi Saiyed Saeed Ashhad also took oath on PCO on 3 November 2007. Chief Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar took a new oath on 15 December 2007, this time on the constitution. He retired from Supreme Court on 21 March 2009. On 31 July 2009, in a landmark verdict, the Supreme Court of Pakistan termed as illegal and unconstitutional the appointment of Abdul Hammed Dogar as Chief Justice. url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/updates.asp?id=84013 date=31 July 2009 url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/updates.asp?id=84013 Controversies =Oath on PCO 1999= On 26 January 2000 the higher judiciary was asked to take fresh oath of office under the PCO 1999 by the Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf. Justice Dogar as the sitting judge of Sindh High Court took oath. On 31 July 2009 the Supreme court of Pakistan unanimously declared in a judgement that Musharff's act of 3 November 2007 to impose the emergency as a Chief of Army Staff was unconstitunal and unlawfull. Consequently, in the absence of consulations made by the Dejure Chief Justice of Pakistan, all the nominations made by the De facto Chief Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar during his tenure were held to be null and void. =PCO 2007 Oath and Appointment as Chief Justice of Pakistan= On 3 November 2007, the then Chief of the Army Staff Gen. Pervez Musharaf declared emergency in Pakistan and issued a Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO). A seven bench supreme court bench headed by the Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry issued an order that declared emergency illegal and ordered that no judge shall take oath on PCO. Mr. Dogar along with 3 other judges immediately took the oath under PCO. Mr Dogar was appointed as the Chief Justice of this newly constituted Supreme Court. On 23 November 2007, Mr Dogar and the newly constituted bench consisting of Ijaz-ul-Hassan Khan, Muhammad Qaim Jan Khan, Musa K. Leghari, Ch. Ijaz Yousaf, Muhammad Akhtar Shabbir and Zia Pervez declared that all judges, including the then Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, who did not take oath on PCO, are deemed to have been removed from the bench . In a later development, on 3 December 2007 federal government issued notification of removal of three justices of Supreme Court without any retirement privileges. They were: Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, Justice Rana Bhagwandas and Justice Khalil-ur-Rehman Ramday. On 21 March 2009 when Mr. Justice Dogar retired from the bench as the Chief Justice of Pakistan, the Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, who was declared to have ceased to hold the office by the bench headed by Chief Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar, was notified as restored to bench as Chief Justice. Since Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry after 3 November 2007 was not re-appointed as Justice and also never re-took oath of office, legality of appointment of Mr Dogar as Chief Justice is questionable and Mr Dogar is considered as a De facto Chief Justice rather than De Jure. =Bank loan= Mr. Justice Dogar Purchased a house which was already on loan granted to earlier owner.

Basidiocarps (fruit bodies) are thin, effused and web-like. The species is tropical to sub-tropical and is mainly known as a plant pathogen, the causative agent of \\"kole-roga\\" or black rot of coffee and various blights of citrus and other trees. Taxonomy The fungus responsible for kole-roga of coffee was sent from India to Mordecai Cubitt Cooke at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew who named it Pellicularia koleroga in 1876. Cooke, however, described only hyphae and some small warted spores, later presumed to be from a contaminating mould. As a result Donk, when reviewing Pellicularia in 1954, dismissed both the genus and P. koleroga as \\"nomina confusa\\", later (1958) substituting the new name Koleroga noxia for the species. Based on a re- examination of specimens, Roberts (1999) considered Koleroga to be a synonym of Ceratobasidium, hence the current name Ceratobasidium noxium. \\"Koleroga\\" means \\"rot disease\\" in the Kannada language of Karnataka. Description Fruit bodies are effused, thin, and whitish. Microscopically they have colourless hyphae, 3 to 8 Œºm wide, without clamp connections. The basidia are ellipsoid to broadly club-shaped, 10 to 12 by 7 to 8 Œºm, bearing 4 sterigmata. The basidiospores are narrow and fusiform, 9 to 13 x 3 to 5 Œºm. Habitat and distribution Ceratobasidium noxium has only been collected as a plant pathogen on living stems and leaves of commercial crops (including coffee, citrus, and persimmon) on which it causes a web blight. It has been reported from Asia (including India and Vietnam) and from the Americas (including Colombia, Guatemala, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Trinidad, United States, and Venezuela).

Plot The film is the story of a depressed man who comes into a town with no future. The title character (Slater) wanders into a small sleepy town with the intent to kill himself. When the townspeople learn of his plan, Julian becomes a minor celebrity, and is offered all sorts of free perks since this is the most exciting thing to ever happen in that town. However, Julian gets attached to the town and decides life is worth living after all, much to the annoyance of the townspeople who decide to set into motion plans for his suicide, assisted or forced if need be, as long as he keeps his word and carries through with his original plans, much to his desperation and anger. Julian is a man with no goals except to kill himself at the beginning of the film. He is treated with suspicion, then sympathy once he explains his goal. Then, he meets Sarah (Robin Tunney), who says that she has been waiting her entire life for him. She rekindles within him the desire to live and experience love. After they make love, however, Julian awakens to find the bed empty and a letter from Sarah. He rushes to the bridge out of town, knowing that it is too late: Sarah has committed suicide, explaining that she wants to see Julian \\"on the other side\\". Heartbroken, Julian's mental condition is not helped by the townsfolks' cruelty, forcing him to \\"keep his promise\\" on killing himself. Before this, many of the townspeople have tried to \\"assist\\" him with his suicide; the barber offering a quick, bloody death with a straight razor, the hotel manager showing off his multiple rifles, and the town sheriff expounding on the joy of death and killing. The film ends with Julian walking out of town, dressed in a suit and tie, \\"supervised\\" by the town sheriff, mayor and barber so as to make sure he does not run away. It is assumed that he kills himself shortly afterwards, fulfilling his dream of \\"going to the sea\\".

Gazz. Chim. Ital. 1911, 41, 20. The product is similar to that of the Einhorn-Brunner reaction, but the mechanism itself is not regioselective. :An overview of the Pellizzari reaction Mechanism The mechanism begins by the nitrogen in the hydrazide attacking the carbonyl carbon on the amide to form compound 3. The negatively charged oxygen then abstracts two hydrogens from neighboring nitrogens in order for a molecule of water to be released to form compound 5. The nitrogen then performs an intramoleculer attack on the carbonyl group to form the five-membered ring of compound 6. After another proton migration from the nitrogens to the oxygen, another water molecule is released to form the 1,2,4-triazole 8. :Pellizzari reaction mechanism Uses The synthesis of the 1,2,4-triazole has a wide range of biological functions. 1,2,4-triazoles have antibacterial, antifungal, antidepressant and hypoglycemic properties. 3-benzylsulfanyl derivates of the triazole also show slight to moderate antimycobacterial activity, but are considered moderately toxic. Problems and variations The Pellizzari reaction is limited in the number of substituents that can be on the ring, so other methods have been developed to incorporate three elements of diversity. Liquid-phase synthesis of 3-alkylamino-4,5-disubstituted-1,2,4-triazoles by PEG support has given moderate yields with excellent purity. In practice, the Pellizzari reaction requires high temperatures, long reaction times, and has an overall low yield. However, adding microwave irradiation shortens the reaction time and increases its yield.

According to the company's website, it is the first African-owned and African- managed business to be listed in the Resources sector of the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market. Asa was founded in 1987. History =2003-2015: Beginning of the company= ASA founded in 2003 by a consortium of businesspeople, including Kalaa Katema Mpinga, David Fish, Tim Wadeson, Oliver Mandishona Chidawu and Douglas Tawanda Munetsi. Then Mwana Africa, in 2003 ASA became the majority shareholder in Bindura Nickel Corporation after acquiring it from Anglo American Corporation. The following year, it acquired the majority share in Freda Rebecca Gold Mine. It is based in the United Kingdom. China International Mining Group Corporation (CIMGC) became an ASA shareholder in 2012 when it injected $21 million into restarting BNC. In 2012, ASA injected $23 million into BNC, allowing it to refurbish its Trojan Mine. Between 2003 and 2015, ASA loaned $11 million to Freda Rebecca Gold Mine, with ASA placed under administration in the United Kingdom. The firm had a poor financial performance in 2013, with losses totaling $42.5 million, more than $35 million more than the previous year. This was due to a $43.7 million impairment charge for its Bindura Nickel Corporation (BNC) operations in Zimbabwe. In October 2013, Asa appointed Yim Chiu Kwan as its finance director.

He had been appointed executive chairman in mid-2015. In July 2017 as well, ASA's shares on the London exchange were suspended, after alleged improper accounting of assets among subsidiaries. In 2017, a manhunt was triggered by Zimbabwean authorities for two former ASA Resource Group executives, over allegations of fraud. At the time, the former CEO and finance director had been missing for several months.\\"Missing ASA Resource Group bosses in ¬£3,2m mining scandal\\", Nehanda Radio (December 29, 2017) $4.3 million were reported unaccounted for, but the company said operations would continue.\\"ASA Resources says $4.3m unaccounted for, but operations continue\\", Megan Van Wyngaardt, Mining Weekly (April 19, 2017) It was reported that Asa was facing a hostile takeover by Rich Pro, a Chinese firm allegedly connected to the two missing executives.

Its main proponent was Sir Frederick Haultain, the premier of the North-West Territories. However Haultain's frosty relations with then-prime minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier did not help his cause, and the proposed province was divided into Alberta in the west, and Saskatchewan in the east in 1905. History The Province of Buffalo was one of several proposals for the area of what would become Alberta and Saskatchewan. Haultain proposed the idea in 1904, stating that \\"One big province would be able to do things no other province could.\\"Quoted in D. Owram, ed., The Formation of Alberta: A Documentary History (Calgary: Alberta Records Publication Board, 1979), 115. At the time the majority of Calgarians and Edmontonians disagreed with the proposal, since Haultain thought the capital of the new province should be Regina, but the two major western cities each had their own ambitions to be a capital city (Edmonton eventually becoming the capital of Alberta). Laurier eventually decided to carve two provinces out of that section of the North-West Territories by dividing the land up with a north‚Äìsouth line. This created Alberta in the west, and Saskatchewan in the east. In 2005 Canadian Geographic magazine ran a cover story, \\"How the West was divided\\", on Haultain's proposal.

Function  Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and retinoic acid receptors (RARs), are nuclear receptors that mediate the biological effects of retinoids by their involvement in retinoic acid-mediated gene activation. These receptors exert their action by binding, as homodimers or heterodimers, to specific sequences in the promoters of target genes and regulating their transcription. The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the steroid and thyroid hormone receptor superfamily of transcription factors. In the absence of ligand, the RXR-RAR heterodimers associate with a multiprotein complex containing transcription corepressors that induce histone deacetylation, chromatin condensation and transcriptional suppression. On ligand binding, the corepressors dissociate from the receptors and associate with the coactivators leading to transcriptional activation. The RXRA/PPARA heterodimer is required for PPARA transcriptional activity on fatty acid oxidation genes such as ACOX1 and the cytochrome P450 system genes.

Born in Birmingham, Alabama, Redmond served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War and worked as a forklift operator for Ford Motor Company before joining the Tiger Stadium grounds crew in 1969. Redmond entertained the crowd with a trademark jig he danced while sweeping the infield during the fifth inning of nearly every Detroit Tigers' home game from 1969-1989. While he and the grounds crew dragged brooms across the infield to smooth the dirt, Redmond would break into a soft shoe routine, shaking his hips, and then wave his cap to the cheering crowd as he exited. The routine was variously known as the \\"broom dance,\\" \\"The Herbie Redmond Show,\\" or the \\"Herbie Shuffle.\\" In a 1986 interview with the Detroit Free Press, Redmond described the \\"Herbie Shuffle\\" this way: \\"First you strut to third ... they you wave your cap ... next you shake those hips ... and jump for joy ... then kiss that cap ... and salute the team.\\" Redmond had a number of variations on his shuffle, including a country version to John Denver's \\"Thank God I'm A Country Boy,\\" a limbo version, and a polka version that was also a big hit with the crowd. According to Redmond, the tradition began when he spontaneously began dancing after a Jim Northrup home run. The next day, Redmond was called to the front office and thought he was going to be fired. Instead, they said: \\"Herbie, just keep doing what you want to do.\\" During the Tigers' win-starved years of the 1970s, Redmond got the crowd cheering when there was not much else to cheer for, and the \\"Herbie Redmond Show\\" became one of the most popular and anticipated features of a visit to Tiger Stadium. In October 2006, Sports Illustrated chose Redmond for its list of the \\"10 Greatest Characters in Tigers History,\\" along with Mark Fidrych, Norm Cash, Boots Poffenberger, and Dave Rozema. * Sports Illustrated's 10 Greatest Characters in Detroit Tigers History. Archived from the original. In 1984, the Tigers (under the new ownership of Tom Monaghan) banned Redmond from continuing his dance, calling it \\"distracting.\\" Detroit fans booed and reacted so negatively that the team relented and allowed Herbie to resume his fifth inning performances. Head groundskeeper Frank Feneck said some members of the crew didn't like the routine, \\"but I never heard a fan say anything bad about him.\\"Mike Dodd, Stadium staffers who gave parks personality, USA Today, May 27, 1993. In a 1985 interview, Redmond said: \\"I just get a little rhythm going, get the feet moving and have a little fun. I try to lighten up the people ... If I get loose, maybe they'll get loose, too.\\" Redmond was also quoted as saying: \\"I loved baseball and here I was getting paid to watch it. Seemed like God couldn't have made a better job.\\"Obituary of Herbert Redmond, United Press International, April 4, 1990. Hall of fame broadcaster Ernie Harwell called Redmond \\"an original.\\" Harwell added: \\"The irony is that the (New York) Yankees tried to hire a man to imitate him, and he failed. You couldn't imitate Herbie. ... It was all spontaneous.\\" Bob Buchta, a founder of the Tiger Stadium Fan Club, said Redmond was \\"a symbol to baseball lovers in Detroit. For a lot of us, Herbie captured the democratic spirit of the ballgame. He brought people together in laughter and made the experience more special and more fun. Some of his bosses apparently wished he'd do his job unnoticed, but Herbie was determined to assert his individuality and a lot of us appreciated him for that.\\" Redmond's sister, Ernestine Ben, described her brother as \\"a crowd pleaser.\\" She said: \\"When the Tigers were in a slump, Herbie would always tip his cap and do his bump. The fans adored him.\\"Obituary of Herbert Redmond, United Press International, April 4, 1990. Redmond died of liver disease at Detroit Receiving Hospital on April 4, 1990. For several months, the ground crew dragged the field in the fifth inning in a \\"missing broom\\" formation in Redmond's honor.

Subsequently, Fridovich's research group also discovered the manganese- containing and the iron-containing SODs from E coli and the mitochondrial MnSOD (SOD2), now known to be an essential mammalian protein. He spent the rest of his career studying the biochemical mechanisms of SOD and of biological superoxide toxicity, using bacteria as model systems. Fridovich was also Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry at Duke University. Academic career  From 1951 to 1952, Fridovich served as a medical research associate at Cornell Medical College. He held junior teaching positions in biochemistry at Duke University 1956 to 1961 and was a visiting research associate at Harvard University from 1961 to 1962. He became an assistant professor in biochemistry at Duke University in 1961 and a full professor in 1971. He was appointed as James B. Duke Professor of Biochemistry in 1976 and held the position as professor emeritus since 1996 until his death. Awards and honors Fridovich received numerous awards and recognitions for his work, including membership in the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Elliott Cresson Medal of the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia. According to Google Scholar, he has over 51,000 citations in the scientific literature, including 7 papers with >1000 citations, and an H-index of 97. His discovery of the superoxide dismutase reaction essentially started the field of oxygen free radicals in biology and medicine, and that influence is shown by his election as president of the American Society of Biological Chemists (for 1982‚Äì83), the Oxygen Society (1987‚Äì1990), and the Society for Free Radical Research (1992‚Äì94), as well as award of the Science & Humanity Prize at the 2000 Oxygen Club World Congress.

This see continues the old Diocese of Elne,Or diocese of Elna, Catalan name. which was renamed and had its see relocated at Perpignan, in 1601 after a papal bull of Pope Clement VIII.Perpignan-Elne (Diocese) [Catholic-Hierarchy] Its territory brought together the Diocese of Elne, part of the Spanish Diocese of Urgel known as French Cerdagne, three cantons of the Diocese of Alet, and two villages of the Diocese of Narbonne. The Diocese of Elne was a suffragan of the Diocese of Narbonne until 1511. Pope Julius II made the Diocese of Elne directly subject to the Holy See in 1511, but on 22 January 1517 Pope Leo X reversed the policy, and the Diocese of Elne became again a suffragan of the Diocese of Narbonne.Gallia christiana VI (1739), Instrumenta, pp. 492-497. In 1482, by virtue of a Decree of the Council of Trent, Pope Gregory XIII made it a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Tarragona.Gallia christiana VI (1739), p. 1030. After 1678 it was again a suffragan of the Diocese of Narbonne. The department of Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales was united in 1802 to the Diocese of Carcassonne. The diocese was to be reestablished by the Concordat of 11 June 1817, but the French Parliament did not approve the treaty. The Diocese of Perpignan was therefore re-established by papal bull in 1822, and was made suffragan to the Archdiocese of Albi. Its see is the Perpignan Cathedral (French: Basilique-Cath√©drale de Saint-Jean- Baptiste de Perpignan; Catalan: Catedral de Sant Joan Baptista de Perpiny√†). History The Diocese of Elne is created in the 6th century. The first known Bishop of Elne is Dominus, mentioned in 571 in the Chronicle of John of Biclarum. Among others are Cardinal Ascanio Maria Sforza (1494‚Äì95), Cardinal Caesar Borgia (1495‚Äì98), Cardinal Francisco Lloris y de Borja (1499-1506), Cardinal Jacques de Serra (1506‚Äì12), Cardinal Girolamo Doria (1530‚Äì33); and Bishop Olympe-Philippe Gerbet (1854‚Äì64). The Cathedral of Elne (eleventh century) and the adjoining cloister are rich examples of elaborate medieval ornamentation. In the later Middle Ages, and under the influence of Roman Law, Roussillon witnessed revivals of slavery; this is proved by numerous purchase deeds of Muslim and Christian slaves, dating back to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The diocese honours especially St. Vincent de Collioure, martyr (end of the third century); and St. Eulalia and St. Julia, virgins and martyrs (end of third century). In memory of former ties with the metropolis of Tarragona, the Church of Perpignan honours several Spanish saints: St. Fructuosus, Bishop of Tarragona, and his deacons Augurius and Eulogius, martyred at Tarragona in 259; some martyrs of the Diocletian persecution (end of third century); Justa and Rufina of Seville; Felix and Narcissus of Gerona; Aciselus and Victoria of Cordova; Leocadia, of Toledo; St. Ildefonsus (607-67), Archbishop of Toledo. After becoming Bishop of Elne in 1495, Caesar Borgia decides to raise the taxes on the clergy, resulting in an uprising in 1497. Those same taxes are cut in two the following year, after the clergy complained to the king. The Benedictine Dom Briard (1743-1828), who continued the series of Historiens de France, belonged to Perpignan. At Perpignan Pope Benedict XIII (Pedro de Luna) held a council 1 November 1408, to rally his partisans; they gradually melted away and on 1 February 1409, the eighteen remaining bishops advised the antipope to send ambassadors to Pisa to negotiate with Pope Gregory XII. Numerous councils were held at Elne: in 1027 (the Synod of Toulouges), 1058, 1114,The meeting, which was a judicial assembly, summoned by mandate of Pope Paschal II, and presided over by Bishop Petrus Bernardi of Elne, was held on 2 January 1114: J. D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio Tomus XXV, pp. 90-91. 1335, 1337, 1338, 1339, 1340, and 1380. The council held in 1027 decreed that no one should attack his enemy from Saturday at nine o'clock to Monday at one; and that Holy Mass be said for the excommunicated for a space of three months, to obtain their conversion. The author of l'Art de verifier les Dates wrongly maintains that the Council of Elvira was held at Elne. The chief places of pilgrimage of the diocese are: Notre-Dame du Ch√¢teau d'Ultr√©ra, at Sor√®de; Notre-Dame de Consolation, at Collioure; Notre-Dame de Font Romeu, at Odeillo; Notre-Dame de Forca-R√©al, near Millas; Notre-Dame de Juigues, near Rivesaltes; the relics of Sts. Abdon and Sennen at Arles on the Tech.

Reactive nitrogen species are also continuously produced in plants as by-products of aerobic metabolism or in response to stress.  Types  RNS are produced in animals starting with the reaction of nitric oxide (‚Ä¢NO) with superoxide (O2‚Ä¢‚àí) to form peroxynitrite (ONOO‚àí): * ‚Ä¢NO (nitric oxide) + O2‚Ä¢‚àí (superoxide) ‚Üí ONOO‚àí (peroxynitrite) Superoxide anion (O2‚àí) is a reactive oxygen species that reacts quickly with nitric oxide (NO) in the vasculature. The reaction produces peroxynitrite and depletes the bioactivity of NO. This is important because NO is a key mediator in many important vascular functions including regulation of smooth muscle tone and blood pressure, platelet activation, and vascular cell signaling. Peroxynitrite itself is a highly reactive species which can directly react with various biological targets and components of the cell including lipids, thiols, amino acid residues, DNA bases, and low-molecular weight antioxidants. However, these reactions happen at a relatively slow rate. This slow reaction rate allows it to react more selectively throughout the cell. Peroxynitrite is able to get across cell membranes to some extent through anion channels. Additionally peroxynitrite can react with other molecules to form additional types of RNS including nitrogen dioxide (‚Ä¢NO2) and dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) as well as other types of chemically reactive free radicals. Important reactions involving RNS include: * ONOO‚àí \\\\+ H+ ‚Üí ONOOH (peroxynitrous acid) ‚Üí ‚Ä¢NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) + ‚Ä¢OH (hydroxyl radical) * ONOO‚àí \\\\+ CO2 (carbon dioxide) ‚Üí ONOOCO2‚àí (nitrosoperoxycarbonate) * ONOOCO2‚àí ‚Üí ‚Ä¢NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) + O=C(O‚Ä¢)O‚àí (carbonate radical) * ‚Ä¢NO + ‚Ä¢NO2 N2O3 (dinitrogen trioxide) = Biological targets = Peroxynitrite can react directly with proteins that contain transition metal centers. Therefore, it can modify proteins such as hemoglobin, myoglobin, and cytochrome c by oxidizing ferrous heme into its corresponding ferric forms. Peroxynitrite may also be able to change protein structure through the reaction with various amino acids in the peptide chain. The most common reaction with amino acids is cysteine oxidation. Another reaction is tyrosine nitration; however peroxynitrite does not react directly with tyrosine. Tyrosine reacts with other RNS that are produced by peroxynitrite. All of these reactions affect protein structure and function and thus have the potential to cause changes in the catalytic activity of enzymes, altered cytoskeletal organization, and impaired cell signal transduction.

Development The origin of the Polish BWP-2000 is the MT-S( –ú–¢-–° ) tracked transporter developed jointly by Poland, Soviet Union and East Germany in late 1980s.Jane's That vehicle was mainly developed by the Soviet OKB-40 design bureau in Mytischi and by the Polish OBRUM (O≈õrodek Badawczo- Rozwojowy UrzƒÖdze≈Ñ Mechnicznych - Institute of Research and Development of Mechanical Devices) from Gliwice. The OBRUM developed the BWP-2000 with help from Polish experts on IFVs. Poland is gradually replacing the former Soviet designs with Western-type systems. Two prototypes were made and in 1997 one of them was fitted with a fully developed and tested Italian Oto Melara T60/70A turret. This turret was developed as a private venture by Oto Melara and as of mid-2005 it has remained in prototype stage. By mid-2005, there were no plans for the Polish BWP-2000 IFV to enter production for the Polish Army. The main priority of the Polish Army is the introduction of the KTO Rosomak. If the BWP-2000 ever enters production it is going to be produced by Bumar ≈Çabƒôdy. In December 2009 Polish Minister of Defence Bogdan Klich announced that BWP-1M \\"Puma\\" modernization program has been canceled due to both tested OWS not standing up to the requirements. Currently Polish Land Forces are considering a new multipurpose platform UPG-NG (\\"Universalne Podwozie GƒÖsienicowe-Nowej Generacji\\" which stands for \\"Universal Tracked Chassis-of New Generation\\") as the replacement for the aging BMP-1 fleet as well as the basis for new light/medium tank with 120 mm unmanned turret and autoloader. The platform is currently under development by OBRUM and could be put into full-scale production by 2015. Its potential competitor is a licensed build CV90 offered by BUMAR Group. Description The BWP-2000 has a typical IFV layout. The steering compartment with the driver's station is located on the left hand side of the front of the hull. The engine compartment is located on the right hand side of the front of the hull. The fighting compartment is located along with the turret in middle of the hull. The troop compartment is located in back. The vehicle has a three men crew consisting of a driver, a gunner and a commander. The vehicle uses a number of chassis components from the MT-S transporter. The chassis was called Kalina. The hull made entirely out of welded steel. It protects the vehicle against APFSDS-T projectiles of up to 35 mm in calibre over the frontal arc. The roof and sides protect it against 12.7 mm rounds fired from a range of 100 m. The other parts of the armour protect it against 7.62 mm rounds from any distance and angle. Both the hull and the turret can be fitted with additional passive of explosive reactive armour. The driver has a single-piece hatch cover that lifts and opens to the right (like in the BWP-1). In front of the driver's hatch is located a wide-angle periscope which can be replaced by a passive night vision device for use during night conditions. The power pack an air inlet/outlet louvres in the roof and the exhaust outlet on the right hand side. The turret is the Italian Oto Melara T60/70A which is normally armed with a stabilized 60 mm rifled autocannon, a 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun and 12.7 mm anti-aircraft heavy machine gun. Inside the turret are the stations of both the gunner and the commander. The 60 mm autocannon can be replaced by a variety of guns from 25 mm autocannons to 105 mm guns. The turret is equipped with two clusters of four electrically operated smoke grenade launchers on each side. The troop compartment can transport up to eight fully equipped soldiers. Like in the BWP-1 the troops enter and leave the vehicle through the rear of the vehicle but in BWP-2000 they do this via a power-operated ramp. The engine comes from the T-72.

Paris, Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs. Madonna Worshipping the Child and an Angel (c. 1475). (S√£o Paulo Museum of Art, S√£o Paulo). Biagio d‚ÄôAntonio Tucci (1446 ‚Äì 1 June 1516) was an Italian Renaissance painter active in Florence, Faenza and Rome. Biography Biagio was born in Florence. It is not known with whom he trained, but his early style reflects the influence of Filippo Lippi, Andrea del Verrocchio and Domenico Ghirlandaio. The latter two were also Biagio's collaborators. With the former Biagio painted the Madonna and Child with Saints for the church of San Domenico del Maglio, now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest. By 1472 he was in a partnership with Jacopo del Sellaio, with whom he painted two great chests, the Morelli Nerli Cassoni (London, Courtauld Institute). Like Sellaio, Biagio was prolific in the art of cassone painting for the duration of his career. By 1476 Biagio was simultaneously operating workshops in Florence and Faenza. The first work he painted for Faenza was the Ragnoli Altarpiece for the church of San Michele. The central panel of this picture, depicting the Nativity with Saints and the Ragnoli Family as Donors, is now in the Kress Collection at the Philbrook Museum of Art, Tulsa, Oklahoma. The lunette, depicting Saint Michael Liberating Souls, is at the Mus√©e du Petit Palais, Avignon. Biagio's style continued to reflect Florentine innovations. His paintings also demonstrate influences‚Äîparticularly in the decorative elements‚Äîfrom early Netherlandish painting. In 1481‚Äì82 he assisted Cosimo Rosselli on frescoes in the Sistine Chapel, including the Last Supper and probably the Crossing of the Red Sea. In 1484 he was contracted to helped Pietro Perugino with some frescoes in the Palazzo della Signoria, Florence, which were never executed. In 1487 he collaborated with Bartolomeo di Giovanni, Pietro del Donzello and Domenico Ghirlandaio on a set of panels (a tondo by Ghirlandaio and three wainscot panels by the others) for the wedding chamber of Lorenzo Tornabuoni and Giovanna degli Albizzi. Biagio's panel from this cycle, depicting the Betrothal of Jason and Medea, is now at the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs, Paris. Later works by Biagio d'Antonio include the Madonna and Child with Saints Francis and Mary Magdalene for San Pancrazio, Florence (now at San Francesco in San Casciano in Val di Pesa; the predella of this work is at the Accademia Etrusca, Cortona) and a number of altarpieces for churches in Faenza, now in that city's picture gallery. Among these, the most important is the Madonna and Child with Saints John the Evangelist and Anthony of Padua for the Bazzolini chapel in San Francesco, completed in 1502. Biagio died in Florence in 1516. Selected works * Madonna and Child, Angels and Saints Dominic, Andrew, John the Evangelist and Thomas Aquinas.

Biography  Noble was born in Bromley, Kent to parents of modest circumstances. His father, John, worked variously as a civil servant, an unpublished novelist and as a caterer, running a caf√© in Battersea Park. Noble entered King's College School (KCS) in Wimbledon in 1939 on a scholarship in what would now be considered an unconventional way: having \\"tied\\" in the examination with another boy, they were given the same puzzle each to complete: whoever finished it first, would win the scholarship. Suffering from asthma, Noble was excused sport and used his time to discover model aeroplanes, literature, music and languages. Hospitalised for his asthma, he found himself sharing a ward with a young German airman; he left KCS in 1946 to read German and French at Trinity College, Oxford where he had won an open scholarship. His contribution to the war effort was working as aeroplane mechanic at RAF Desford Aerodrome in Leicestershire. Noble was awarded a First Class Degree in French in 1949 and embarked on a thesis on Jean-Jacques Rousseau's philosophical method, first at Oxford and then as Assistant Lecturer at the University of Manchester. In 1956 he finally abandoned the project in order \\"to seek a post of contemporary urgency, being tired of living in the past\\", as he wrote to one potential employer. He taught in a school in Switzerland briefly before finding employment as a Lecturer in English at the University of Baghdad. In 1959 he went to Beirut for a summer holiday where he worked on his translation of Max Scheler's On the Eternal in Man and where he met and married Amy Jalkh. He then found a position as Assistant Professor of English and Humanities at the Beirut College for Women (now the Lebanese American University and, in 1961, the year his first son, Bruno, was born, became Translator-Reviser and later Deputy Head, Press and Publications at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in Beirut. He found himself translating into English from French and, occasionally, German, Spanish, Italian and Dutch and revising translations into English from Arabic. In 1967, the family moved to The Hague in the Netherlands where Noble had been appointed First Secretary to the International Court of Justice and where his second son, Marc, was born. Noble‚Äôs work at the Court had some of the same multi-lingual, multi-cultural aspects as his work with UNRWA but now involved judges and staff from more than a dozen nations. It took on more of a legal hue, as Noble found himself ever more involved with the complexities of international law; he translated numerous books on the subject from French and Dutch into English. In 1987, he was elected Deputy Registrar to the Court, a position from which he retired in 1994. He was awarded an OBE for services to the International Court of Justice in 1995. Noble spent the first few years of his retirement writing three broadly biographical books: The Chocolate Tram tells the story of a boy growing up in South London before the war; Young Mortality (cf. Old Mortality) recounts the life of a boy attending KCS in Wimbledon during the war; Talismen is about a student at Oxford after the war. The trilogy is titled Echoes. Noble developed a love of classical music, of the classical romantics and Wagner in particular, and built a large collection of LPs and CDs many of which were given to KCS who named their new music library after him. His elder son established the Bernard Noble Sculpture Foundation in commemoration of him. Noble died on 5 October 2004 in The Hague.

Galactic Protectorate =Duck Dodgers= Captain Duck Edgar Dumas Aloysius Eoghain Dodgers, the star of the show, was played by the fictional character Daffy Duck. He was voiced by Joe Alaskey. Duck Dodgers was accidentally frozen for over three centuries. He was revived by Dr. I.Q. Hi in the middle of the 24th century. Through scheming and lies, he managed to trick everyone into believing he was a 21st-century hero. In reality, he was only a water boy for a football team. He is arrogant, selfish, greedy, lazy, cowardly, gullible, and not particularly intelligent. He occasionally displays surprisingly high levels of heroism and competence, suggesting that he is not quite as daft as he appears to be, although he mostly succeeds through dumb luck and the work of the Eager Young Space Cadet. Ironically, Commander X-2 actually caused Dodgers to become a minor football star in the final game of the season, which is what he used to parlay himself into captaincy in the Protectorate, meaning that he is, technically, not lying when he claims he won a championship football game in his own time. His running gag tends to be that he develops crushes on various women, who almost always hate him. =Cadet= The Eager Young Space Cadet, the faithful sidekick of Duck Dodgers, was played by the fictional character Porky Pig. He was voiced by Bob Bergen.http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Duck-Dodgers/ Cadet looks up to Dodgers, seeing him as a father-figure in many ways. He is utterly loyal to Dodgers and doesn't doubt a word he says. Despite being much smarter than his so-called hero, Cadet lets Dodgers give all the orders. Dodgers cares deeply for Cadet, though he rarely shows it. Dodgers relies heavily on the Cadet's assistance and would likely fail most missions without it; he often tries to take credit for the Cadet's work. Cadet is also fairly successful as a ladies man, often being the one who gets the girl Dodgers swoons over. He graduated summa cum laude from the Protectorate Academy. Very little else is known about his past, though one episode portrays him as being the Prince and Ruler of his home planet of Swinus 9. Another episode reveals that Cadet's sister was sold to the sausage factory (by Dodgers), and villains trying to dethrone or otherwise eliminate him. However, Cadet reveals this background by telling a story to his overly rambunctious niece and nephews who expressed no prior knowledge of this. It is unknown whether or not this is true or just his attempt to impress his relatives. He claimed to Count Muerte that he ended world hunger, though this could be seen as bragging to a stranger. =I.Q. Hi= Dr. Ignatius Q. \\"I.Q.\\" Hi is the scientist that revives Dodgers after being frozen for three centuries. He is the Chief Scientist for the Galactic Protectorate and usually acts as a representative on Earth on behalf of the World President. Hi is responsible for giving missions to the team. Serious and hard-working, he is often irritated and frustrated with Dodgers's incompetent side, and doubts that Dodgers truly was a 21st-century hero. Once a year, he serves as a cadet for one flight on Dodger's ship in order to evaluate Dodger's command. In college, he majored in Pointless Minutiae, which his mother warned him against. He also has a slight potassium deficiency. I.Q. Hi first appeared in Duck Dodgers in the 24¬Ωth Century, as the Secretary of the Stratosphere who briefs Duck Dodgers. He also appeared in the sequel, Duck Dodgers and the Return of the 24¬Ωth Century. In both cartoons, he was voiced by Mel Blanc. His overall design was changed in the TV series. In the shorts, he was originally fat and wore a blue laboratory coat. In the new series Hi wears a traditional white lab coat and is rarely seen without gloves that extend to his elbow and leave a gap between his fingertips and the glove's tips. He also has a higher-pitched, more throaty voice which was provided by Richard McGonagle. Hi is bald beneath his lightbulb-hat. Later episodes also show that I.Q. Hi owns an old castle inherited from his ancestors (which is later destroyed by Dodgers), enjoys lattes, fishing, and despite their rivalries, appears to be on friendly terms with Queen Tyr'ahnee. He also has a brother named Psy Q. Hi, who is a psychiatrist. Dr. I.Q. Hi may be loosely based on the character of Dr. Huer in the Buck Rogers comic strip that Dodgers parodies. Hi's physical appearance mimics that of Larry Fine. In addition to the Duck Dodgers series, I.Q. Hi also made a guest cameo on Tiny Toon Adventures in the segment \\"Duck Dodgers, Jr.\\", featured in the episode \\"The Return to the Acme Acres Zone\\". Here, he briefs Dodgers and Plucky Duck (appearing as Dodgers' sidekick) on the matter transmogrifier that Marvin is using to suck up the universe; he is then sucked up himself by the transmogrifier. In this cameo, I.Q. Hi's appearance, voiced by Jeff Bergman, was closer to that of the original cartoons. Dr. I.Q. Hi also appeared in the Super Nintendo Entertainment System title Daffy Duck: The Marvin Missions in which he appeared briefly in some in-between stage newspaper headline photos and (possibly) briefs Dodgers on his mission before each stage. He later appears as a boss, brainwashed by Marvin the Martian and strapped into a large war machine on the third planet's final area. The newspaper headline after the battle depicts I.Q. Hi (still under the effects of being brainwashed) being recruited as Dodgers' new cadet. =Captain Star Johnson= Captain Star Johnson is a member of the Space Protectorate who serves as a rival to Duck Dodgers. Johnson is a rival captain of Dodger's in the Galactic Protectorate. Johnson has a University education and played collegiate rocketball. His personality is like that of Flash Gordon. Johnson once took Dodgers to court over Dodger's incompetence. Since then, Johnson has been involved in freeing Mars from the military coup by General Z9 and searching for gangsters when Dodgers went missing for a brief period of time. =Captain Long= Captain Long is a member of the Galactic Protectorate. He appeared in \\"The Fudd\\" where he was one of the victims of the Mother Fudd. He was voiced by Michael Dorn. =Captain Dallas Rodman= Captain Dallas Rodman is a member of the Galactic Protectorate. Rodman appeared in only one episode, \\"The Best of Captains, The Worst of Captains\\" where he was nominated for Captain of the Year at the Galactic Protectorate's Captainee Awards. He closely resembled Buzz Lightyear. Rodman was voiced by Frank Welker. =Captain Aurora Soleil= Captain Aurora Soleil served as a lieutenant in the Galactic Protectorate. At the Captainee Awards, Duck Dodgers and Star Johnson competed for her attention. At the awards, she was promoted to Captain for her heroic actions. Cadet voted for her in the \\"Captain of the Year\\" category. Soleil is based on Wilma Deering. =Master Sergeant Emily Dickinson Jones= Master Sergeant Emily Dickinson Jones works at the Galactic Protectorate Training Academy on Earth. He is responsible for monitoring Duck Dodgers during his annual Protectorate Training Test, which Dodgers routinely avoids taking. He takes great pride in molding lazy Captains (like Dodgers) into decent shape to fight for the Protectorate, enjoying their suffering during training. However, he respects individuals who can think out of the box which is why Sgt. Jones let Dodgers pass the test despite the fact Dodgers managed to fail every one of the tests. Jones was voiced by Randy Savage. =Bigfoot= In \\"The Six Wazillion Dollar Duck\\" (a parody of The Six Million Dollar Man), it was revealed that Bigfoot worked for the Protectorate as a Maintenance Supervisor and was also the first being to receive cyborganic implants. Due to enhanced combat abilities, as he was able hold off several centurions before they baited and trapped him with pie. He seems not to be very educated, as the only two words he says are \\"Duck\\" and \\"Stereo\\". When Dodgers thwarted the Martians, Dr. Maniac escaped with Bigfoot and were seen in the fast food business. On the \\"Bonafide Heroes\\" show, Dr. Maniac and Bigfoot were seen being interviewed in jail. Bigfoot was voiced by Michael Patrick McGill. Martian Empire =Queen Tyr'ahnee= Queen Tyr'ahnee 19-20 year old is the ruler of Mars. She is shown as a competent ruler who, much unlike the rival President of Space, actually leaves the safety of the government buildings at times. Though at times she dislikes him, she is in love with Dodgers and, just like Cadet, believes him to be a true hero. She and Dodgers planned to marry until X-2 persuaded Dodgers to leave the Queen. She never quite got over her feelings for Dodgers, to the point of deserting Commander X-2 at their own wedding. She is shown to be good friends with I.Q. Hi, knowing and calling him by his first name, Ignatius, on many occasions. Tyr'ahnee is something of a female version of X-2 and wears outfits reminiscent of ancient Egyptian royal garb. Her name is pronounced similar to \\"tyranny.\\" Like all Martians, she has a British accent. She was voiced by Tia Carrere. =Martian Commander X-2= Martian Commander X-2 is the commander of the Martian military. He is never named outside his official capacity as the Commander (possibly High Commander) of the fleet of Mars. He essentially created Duck Dodgers by going back in time and making Dodgers a hero so as to not be proven wrong by the queen. X-2 is Duck Dodgers' archenemy, though X-2 considers Dodgers more of a nuisance than a true enemy. X-2 serves the Martian Queen Tyr'ahnee, with whom he is infatuated and loyal to. His crush is not requited for most of the series, until in the end of the second season, when the Queen kissed X2 in the cheek after learning of his crush, something he found so delighted. Even at their wedding, the Queen chooses Dodgers over X-2, even after X-2 risks his life to save Dodgers from the Legion of Duck Doom. Also, despite their rivalry with each other, both Dodgers and X-2 have worked together in several occasions to fight against more evil villains in general; Dodgers even manages to rescue X-2 from the wrath of the treacherous Martian General Z-9. X-2's interests include piano music, singing, cooking, and possibly linguistics. He is also shown to be obsessively tidy and an avid worker. X-2 is also an avid scientist and inventor, creating many machines that assist the stories. He is also shown to have a fear of heights due to childhood trauma and to be very protective of his mother, apparently calling or sending her messages up to five times a day. X-2 is also the constant target of the centurions' robot jokes, who imply several times in the series that X-2 is not alright in his head and has issues with \\"strong independent women\\" (ie. the Martian Queen).

K-9's vocal effects were provided by Frank Welker. =Martian General Z-9= Martian General Z-9 is a well-known general of the Martian military. He serves as the villain of the final two episodes of the second season. He initially served for the Martian Queen and Martian Commander X-2, but secretly plotted to take over both Earth and Mars as their new ruler after a peace meeting between Earth and Mars went off bad thanks to Dodgers' antics. To start off, Z-9 managed to capture Star Johnson after the latter learns of the general's plot. Z-9 then staged a military coup on Mars by taking the Martian Queen as prisoner and sending X-2 on the run as a wanted criminal, declaring himself the new Martian King and Commander. Z-9 then plans to get hold of the shut-down codes of Earth's shield system by staging up a false peace treaty between Mars and Earth to finalize his invasion on Earth. Fortunately, Duck Dodgers manages to rescue Cadet, X2, and Captain Johnson and they collaborated to keep the codes away to safety and save the Queen from Z-9's grasp during a battle between Z-9's forces and Earth. Following the aftermath of the battle between Earth and Mars which ended in ceasefire, Z-9 is arrested for his treason and crimes against Mars and Earth, and sacked of his ranks. He is currently incarcerated and sharing a cell with the Andromeda Annihilator, who subjects the former general to painful torture, much to his dismay.

In a battle between Earth's forces and Z-9's forces, Dish attempts to fire at the Protectorate HQ under Z-9's orders, but the Martian Queen, being freed by Dodgers and X-2, stops her by chopping her head off, killing her for good. Cadet then uses Dish's head to knock Z-9 out into the ship's console, thus leading to the general's defeat and imprisonment for his war crimes. =Martian Centurion Robots= The Martian Centurion Robots are robotic servants of the Mars Empire.

Created by the writers to expand on the characterization of demons within the series, she first appears in the third season, wherein she assists series protagonists Sam and Dean Winchester in fighting her fellow demons. By the fourth season, she has won Sam's trust and begins training him to kill demons with his psychic powers, though Dean remains fearful of ulterior motives. The character is killed at the end of the fourth season. In the fifteenth season, Ruby returns through flashbacks and a visit to the Empty, the angels' and demons' afterlife. Though the fans at first reacted negatively towards Cortese replacing Cassidy after the third season, Cortese and creator Eric Kripke felt that they became more accepting as the fourth season progressed. While fan response to the character was mixed overall, critical reception was generally negative. A common criticism was underwhelming performances by Cassidy and Cortese. Plot Debuting in the third season premiere \\"The Magnificent Seven\\", Ruby (Katie Cassidy) trails Sam Winchester--a hunter of supernatural creatures--and eventually rescues him from a group of demons, whom she kills with her unique demon-killing knife. She reveals her identity to Sam in \\"The Kids Are Alright\\", but claims to be different from other demons and wants to help Sam fight them. In return for his cooperation, she promises to save his brother Dean from the Faustian deal he had made to resurrect Sam in the second season finale \\"All Hell Breaks Loose: Part 2\\". However, she refuses to tell Sam her motives. Though he distrusts her and Dean wants to kill her before she can harm them, Sam decides to let her continue to help him with both saving Dean and fighting the hundreds of other demons who‚Äîlike Ruby‚Äîescaped Hell in the second season finale. Ruby's credibility builds throughout Season 3. In \\"Sin City\\", she restores power to the Colt for the Winchesters to use in their war against demons. The episode \\"Malleus Maleficarum\\" provides her backstory, revealing that she had been a witch during the Plague who sold her soul to a demon. She confides in Dean that, unlike other demons, she still remembers what it is like to be human, citing this trait as the reason she is helping the brothers against other demons. She returns in \\"Jus in Bello\\" to save the brothers from an attacking horde of demons. Upon learning that they have lost the Colt, she decides to perform a spell that will destroy all the demons in the area, including herself. However, because the spell requires a human virgin's heart, Dean does not allow her to perform it. Although the plan he comes up with instead saves himself and his brother, the people they leave behind get killed by demons pursuing Sam and Dean, which Ruby uses to rebuke the brothers for not listening to her. Contrary to her promise to Sam, Ruby tells Dean that she cannot actually save him from Hell and that she had lied to Sam to get him to listen to her. However, in the season finale \\"No Rest for the Wicked\\", she tells Sam that she had lied to Dean and that she truly can help Sam save him. Her plan is to train Sam to harness his latent demonic abilities so that he can use them to kill Lilith, the demon who holds the contract for Dean's soul. Believing that Ruby is trying to manipulate Sam into giving in to his dark side, Dean tricks her into a devil's trap--a mystical symbol capable of rendering demons powerless--and leaves with Sam to face Lilith. Ruby frees herself and tracks the brothers down during their campaign, but gets expelled from her host body by Lilith and thus is not present at the confrontation between Lilith and the brothers, with her whereabouts at the time unclear. The fourth season episode \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\" states that she had been sent back to Hell. Eventually, Ruby returns and offers Sam her help in taking revenge on Lilith for Dean's death in \\"No Rest for the Wicked\\" as well as in stopping Lilith's apocalyptic plans. To appease Sam, who dislikes her using a living host against the host's will, Ruby takes possession of a body recently declared to be dead (Genevieve Cortese). They have sex together at least once, and she brings him out of his downward spiral towards self-destruction. Consequently, Sam now trusts Ruby implicitly. Ruby begins training Sam in using his demonic abilities to exorcise (and later, kill) demons, and continues to do so in secret following Dean's resurrection by the angel Castiel in the fourth season premiere. The episode \\"On the Head of a Pin\\" reveals that she is feeding Sam her demonic blood to boost his powers, and by \\"The Rapture\\", he has become addicted to drinking her blood. In the following episode \\"When the Levee Breaks\\", Sam and Dean have a heated confrontation over Sam's trust in her and the negative influence she has on him, leading to a vicious fight which ends in Sam strangling Dean and Dean severing ties with Sam. In the season finale \\"Lucifer Rising\\", Ruby insists that she and Sam must murder a demonically-possessed woman despite the woman being alive and pleading for them to let her go, as Ruby argues that Sam needs to also drink the woman's blood in order to be able to kill Lilith; Sam eventually agrees. In the episode's climax, Ruby keeps Dean from interfering while Sam succeeds in killing Lilith. Afterward, Ruby reveals that she is a double-agent working for Lilith who has just tricked Sam into setting the demons' revered god Lucifer free with Lilith's death. With Sam's help, she is killed by Dean with her own knife. In season 15's \\"Destiny's Child,\\" the Winchesters learn from the angel Anael that she and Ruby occasionally worked together when they had common interests and Anael gave Ruby the Occultum, supposedly to sell it for a lot of money. Anael claims that Ruby hid it in Hell and was killed before she could sell it off, but this proves to be a trap as Anael hires demons to kill Sam and Dean. Needing the Occultum to continue with their plan to kill God, Castiel has Jack send him into the Empty so he can ask Ruby herself where to find it. The Shadow, the being the rules the realm, reluctantly allows Castiel to talk to Ruby who takes on the form she had when she died. Ruby reveals that, in reality, Anael approached her with the suggestion that they hide in the Occultum until the Apocalypse was over. Ruby never told the angel where she hid the Occultum, but offers Castiel the location in exchange for his help in getting out of the Empty which would effectively resurrect Ruby. Sympathetic with Ruby due to his own time in the realm, Castiel agrees to at least try which the demon accepts. Ruby whispers the Occultum's location in Castiel's ear before disappearing. However, Ruby fails to mention the hellhounds she left to guard the Occultum, causing Dean to think Ruby was trying to kill them like Anael did before they decipher Ruby's clues and locate the artifact. Characterization Prior to Ruby's introduction in the third season, series creator Eric Kripke summarized the character as \\"ruthless and a little crazy and rough around the edges\\", calling her \\"[a] little unhinged\\" because she lacks the \\"moral conscience\\" that Sam and Dean have. Katie Cassidy, the actress who portrayed Ruby in the third season, described her as a \\"kick-ass, bad-ass\\" ally of Sam and Dean's who \\"also likes to stir up a little trouble.\\" According to Cassidy, Ruby is \\"mysterious\\", \\"manipulative\\", and in control of her situation, being \\"always 10 steps ahead of everybody else\\". On this, Cassidy proclaimed that Ruby \\"knows what she wants, and she's out to get it\\". Actress Genevieve Cortese, who played the character in the fourth season, deemed Cassidy's incarnation \\"very tough\\" and \\"hard to get close to\\".Issue 9, From Hell, by Bryan Cairns, p.42 In taking over the role, Cortese felt \\"conflicted over where Ruby is now versus where she's come from\\" and explained that her own portrayal of the character was a \\"total 180 from [how she was] last season\\", being calmer and \\"more fear-driven\\"; after a discussion with Kripke on the character's mindset, Cortese saw Ruby as being in a \\"lonely, desperate\\" situation. She tried to make Ruby seem \\"as innocent as possible\\" to make viewers question her true allegiance,Knight 4, p.136 and to \\"bring more of a humanity\\" to Ruby than Cassidy had.Issue 9, From Hell, Bryan Cairns, p.43 For example, taking from the third season finale in which Dean is sent to Hell, Cortese portrayed the character as having some guilt over his death, even though Ruby was not responsible for it. The actress also acknowledged that Ruby was likely manipulating Sam when she claimed to remember how it felt to be human, but suggested that there was also an element of truth to her character's words. Cortese believed that Ruby fell in love with Sam over the course of the season, though she questioned whether this was \\"true love\\" or her being \\"in love with what he can do\\". As Cortese noted, \\"He has something she can nurture. It's almost like a mother bear and her cub [in terms of] how protective she is... Sam's all [Ruby has], so it's almost like giving birth, in a weird, messed-up way.\\" She stated that the sex scene between her character and Sam was \\"about two people who are so broken and sad\\" and compared it to similar sex scenes from the film Monster's Ball. Although Ruby eventually reveals herself as a traitor, Kripke wrote her final scene with the intention of depicting Ruby as \\"the opposite of evil\\" and to show that Ruby does care about Sam, despite her manipulation of him to free Lucifer; Kripke explained that, in Ruby's mind, she had to lead Sam down that path because \\"it was for his own good\\". Development Ruby was described as a \\"demon hunter\\" in press releases prior to her debut so that her true demonic nature would surprise the audience. The writers created Ruby to change the perception of demons into more of a grey area, rather than the \\"black and white\\", \\"They're evil, we're good\\" approach previously used in the series. However, the writers also planned for Ruby to impact the brothers negatively by facilitating the story arc of Sam falling into evil--which had been set up in the second season, but without follow-through--and causing a fracture in their relationship. Knowing this, the writers were amused by fans questioning why they were \\"trying to make [Ruby] likable\\". Despite Ruby's overall betrayal of the brothers, writer Sera Gamble commented, \\"[Ruby] brought the idea that you can't just dismiss demons as things that need to be killed right away. They could be useful, and while fundamentally untrustworthy, there might be cause to trust them in a given situation.\\" Fearing that introducing the character as an \\"[accessory] to the boys\\" would hinder their chances of successfully integrating her into the series, the writers intended that Ruby should be \\"a character in [her] own right\\" and deemed her an antagonist \\"with [her] own interests and [her] own motives\\" rather than a love interest to Sam or Dean, which they felt had been their mistake in their introduction of the widely disliked Jo Harvelle in the second season. While they were not planning on a romance between Ruby and either of the Winchesters in the third season, however, they were open to the possibility in the future, with Kripke saying, \\"If the chemistry is there, and we see the sparks, and we want it to happen, and the fans want it to happen, it'll happen.\\" Due to \\"protective and occasionally nervous\\" fans, Kripke meant to introduce Ruby in \\"small doses\\". Wanting fans to know the show would always be about Sam and Dean, and nothing else, he stated, \\"[Ruby and Bela are] there for important plot elements, but it's not the Ruby and Bela show, nor is it about the four of them cruising around in the Impala together. It's about the guys.\\" Cassidy originally auditioned for the role of Bela Talbot, but ultimately received the part of Ruby. As opposed to using traditional demonic abilities such as telekinesis, Ruby instead relies on conventional martial arts and her demon-killing knife. Cassidy trained in kickboxing alongside Bela's actress Lauren Cohan to be able to perform Ruby's martial arts skills, prompting her to attempt as many of the fight scenes as she could rather than rely on her stunt double. Before filming for the third season began, she and Cohan decided to watch previous seasons together to catch up on the show. Cassidy also prepared by looking to Sharon Stone's performance in the film Basic Instinct for inspiration due to Ruby's manipulative ways. As Cassidy explained, \\"[Stone's character] always has the power, and there's this mystery about her.\\"Knight 4, p.116 Costume designer Diane Widas had Ruby dressed in dark colors so that she would blend into shadows, also giving her pleather jackets and narrow jeans to allow Cassidy to be more active. Because of Cassidy's height difference with the lead actors‚Äîshe is 5'7\\" while Sam's actor, Jared Padalecki, is 6'4\\"‚Äîshe had to wear tall, spiky high heels that at times made her lose balance. Kripke cited budgetary reasons for Cassidy's departure after the third season.Issue 7, Tales from the Kripke, Nicholas Knight, p.24 According to Cassidy, however, Warner Bros.'s uncertainty about what direction to take Ruby in prompted her to leave when the opportunity to star in the series Harper's Island arose. To \\"make the best out of a bad situation\\", Kripke and the writers planned for Ruby to take on a new host every few episodes for the fourth season. They believed this would \\"keep [viewers] guessing\\", and provide a \\"cool character that most shows don't have the ability to do\\". Auditions for an unnamed \\"love interest\\" were held to recast Ruby with a new actress, and Cortese was hired for the part. She was then informed that she would actually be playing Ruby. Before the first episode she was in aired, however, she was said to be playing \\"a small-town waitress\\" named Kristy who had become \\"romantically involved\\" with Sam after Dean's death. Cortese played the first of what was expected to be many incarnations of Ruby, but an impressed Kripke ultimately chose to keep her in the role because she \\"brought a lot of the different colors and vulnerabilities to Ruby that [he] was really looking for\\".Knight 4, p.119 Although Cortese viewed DVDs of Cassidy's portrayal, she tried to make the character her own at the producers' request rather than emulate Cassidy. She was not as concerned with how Ruby was received by the audience‚Äîstating \\"if people don't like her, they don't like her\\"‚Äîas much as she was with using her performance to \\"answer questions\\" about Ruby and her relationship with the Winchester brothers, such as why Sam and Dean were continuing to work with Ruby in the fourth season. Reception BuddyTV staff columnist Don Williams felt the addition of Ruby was a \\"cheap ploy\\" to attract teen male viewers, that the character distracted viewers from the \\"brotherly bond that made the show so special in the first place,\\" and that Cassidy \\"was cast more for her looks than her acting prowess.\\" However, he later admitted Ruby \\"remains one of the more interesting and ambiguous evildoers on the series.\\" Although IGN's Diana Steenbergen had looked forward to Ruby's introduction, she ultimately found the third-season incarnation a \\"wasted\\" character who did little to improve the series. Her main concerns consisted of Ruby's \\"unlikable and manipulative\\" qualities and her tendency to make the Winchesters \\"look stupid.\\" Cassidy \\"never quite [pulled off]\\" the \\"tough chick\\" persona of Buffy the Vampire Slayers Faith or Battlestar Galacticas Six. TV Guide's Tina Charles, however, liked Ruby's action-packed introduction in \\"The Magnificent Seven.\\" She was \\"intrigued\\" by the character in \\"The Kids Are Alright,\\" and felt Cassidy was \\"doing a good job.\\" Ruby made a \\"plausible addition\\" to \\"Malleus Maleficarum,\\" with Charles finding it \\"cool\\" to learn Ruby's backstory due to its implications for Dean's storyline. Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune thought Cassidy \\"wasn't awful\\" in \\"The Magnificent Seven.\\" Though \\"not great enough for Ackles to really play off of\\" in \\"Malleus Maleficarum,\\" the actress was \\"good enough to make her weaker acting chops kind of work for her.\\" While under the impression that Ruby had been killed off in \\"No Rest for the Wicked,\\" Peterson wrote that the character \\"got gone just as [she was] getting interesting\\" and deemed her a \\"decent traveling [companion].\\" In her debut, Cortese impressed Peterson \\"even less than the old Ruby.\\" While Peterson was accepting of the sexual relationship between Ruby and Sam, she felt the \\"seduction came out of nowhere\\" in \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer.\\" Contributing to this problem was Cortese's inability to \\"pull it off,\\" making the \\"whole thing [feel] gratuitous and clumsy.\\" Conversely, Peterson enjoyed the performances of actresses Anna Williams and Michelle Hewitt-Williams as Ruby's temporary hosts in the episode; the former was \\"great,\\" while she found the latter \\"sassy\\" and \\"[missed] her already.\\" She \\"loved\\" Ruby's death in the finale, describing it as \\"a beautiful thing.\\" Similar to Peterson, BuddyTV's Williams considered Cortese's acting \\"a bit distracting,\\" but noted she improved over time. Steenbergen considered Cortese an \\"acceptable Ruby,\\" but wrote that the actress' portrayal was often \\"too girlish to connect with the previous incarnations of the character.\\" In contrast to Williams, Steenbergen felt that Cortese \\"seemed out of her depth in the acting department\\" towards the end of the season. Ruby's seeming betrayal of Anna Milton in \\"Heaven and Hell\\" would \\"have added some welcome layers to her character\\" in Steenbergen's opinion, but the character's true intentions made the character development \\"less exciting.\\" However, Steenbergen deemed Ruby's overall deceit of Sam a \\"great revelation.\\" Like BuddyTV's Don Williams, fans were very wary at first of bringing in female characters to the male-dominated show. To make matters worse, Kripke wrote a lackluster scene intended solely for the audition process. Fans quickly came across it on casting sites, and developed the feeling that the character \\"really [looks like she sucks].\\" However, Kripke believed that fans would change their minds about Ruby after learning that she was a demon. By the middle of the third season, Kripke felt enough fans were \\"responding positively to vindicate the character,\\" and that most were \\"finally embracing her\\" by the third season finale, with Cassidy's version of Ruby even being dubbed a \\"fan favorite\\" later on. When the character returns in the fourth season, she is much different than her third season counterpart. Cortese felt that while the drastic change made fans angry, the flashbacks provided in \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\" shed some light on Ruby's new mindset and made fans more accepting of the character. However, the overall criticisms towards Cortese's performance made her reluctant to return for an episode in the sixth season, although she eventually accepted when she learned she would be portraying herself. Despite the generally negative reception to Cortese in the role, fans voted her version of Ruby the 32nd sexiest female character in fantasy and science fiction film and television in a 2012 poll by SFX for the Top 200 Sexiest Characters In Sci-Fi, making her the highest-placing female Supernatural character in the list, beating out Jo Harvelle at number 53 and Ellen Harvelle at number 77.

Rea joined the team during the 1964 championship and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1974 championship. During that time he won one All- Ireland medal and two Munster medals. Rea was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. At club level Rea was a three-time county club championship medalist with Faughs. He began his career with Effin. He attended St Munchin's College, Limerick. His brother, Gerry Rea, was also an inter-county hurler, while his granduncle, Matt Rea, was an All-Ireland medal winner as a Gaelic footballer with Dublin. Playing career =Club= Rea began his club hurling career with Effin before joining Dublin club Faughs in 1968. It was with the latter club that he enjoyed his greatest success. After losing the 1969 championship decider, Faughs were back in the final again the following year. A defeat of St. Vincents gave Rea his first championship medal. Faughs surrendered their title the following year but went on to win back-to-back titles in 1972 and 1973, bring Rea's championship medal tally to three. =Inter-county= Rea's performances at club level brought him to the attentions of the inter-county selectors and he soon joined the Limerick senior team. In 1973, after eighteen years in the doldrums, Limerick finally made the provincial breakthrough. A last-gasp free by Richie Bennis secured a narrow 6-7 to 2-18 defeat of Tipperary in the provincial decider and a first Munster medal for Rea. Limerick later lined out as underdogs in Croke Park for an All-Ireland showdown with reigning champions and injury-ravaged Kilkenny. A Mossie Dowling goal eight minutes after half-time, together with play from Richie Bennis powered Limerick to a 1-21 to 1-14 victory and secured an All-Ireland medal for Rea. In 1974 Limerick maintained their provincial dominance. Rea captured a second Munster medal following a 6-14 to 3-9 trouncing of Clare. This victory allowed Rea's side advance directly to the All-Ireland final where Kilkenny provided the opposition once again. The Cats were back to full strength and set out for revenge. In spite of this Limerick stormed into an early lead, however, this was diminished as Pat Delaney, Eddie Keher and Mick Brennan scored goals.

Early life Ouderland was born in Amsterdam on 6 December 1917. He left his studies when he was 17 to work as a shoe-shiner and later joined Bata Shoe Company. In 1936, Ouderland enlisted in the Dutch National Service before the Nazi invasion in Netherlands. Later, he became a sergeant of the Royal Signal Corps and his team had 36 members.

He sat in the House of Commons from 1721 to 1737. He was married to the half-niece of Sir Isaac Newton, whom Conduitt succeeded as Master of the Mint. Early life The son of Leonard and Sarah Conduitt, John was baptised at St Paul's, Covent Garden, London, on 8 March 1688. In June 1701 he was admitted to St Peter's College, Westminster School, as a King's scholar. In 1705, while at Westminster, he was elected a Queen's scholar to Trinity College, Cambridge, with three others. He was admitted there in June of that year and matriculated to the University, but did not graduate, staying only two years. Career By 1707, based on his own account, he was \\"travelling\\" in Holland and Germany. In September 1710, he became judge advocate with the British forces in Portugal. He was a \\"very pretty gentleman\\" according to James Brydges.Letter to Capt Leigh 3 October 1710, Huntingdon Library, California, ms 57, vol 4, folder 169 From October 1710, he acted as the Earl of Portmore's secretary when the latter arrived in Portugal (N&Q;). During this time, he kept the Earl of Dartmouth informed about the Portuguese court. He returned to London by October 1711 with Lord Portmore. During the following year, he was made a captain in a regiment of the dragoons serving in Portugal, but by September 1713 he had been appointed Deputy Paymaster General to the British forces in Gibraltar. Those posts appear to have been remunerative, and in May 1717 he returned home to England a rich man. In 1720, Conduitt acquired the estate and house at Cranbury Park, near Winchester. Parliament and Mint In June 1721, Conduitt was elected, on petition, as a Member of Parliament for Whitchurch, Hampshire, which he represented during the 1720s as a loyal supporter of Robert Walpole's Whig government. Conduitt took an active interest in the running of Isaac Newton's office of Master of the Mint in the latter years of Newton's life, and after Newton's death in March 1727 Conduitt succeeded him to the post. Isaac Newton having died intestate, Conduitt was appointed by Newton's heirs to serve as executor of Newton's estate. Conduitt collected materials for a life of Newton, some of which he forwarded to Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle, who used them to prepare Newton's obituary as a foreign member of the French Academy of Sciences. John Newton, who as his most direct living descendant was heir to Isaac Newton's real estate, had to resort to the Chancery courts to get satisfaction from Conduitt.PRO, Chancery depositions By the early 1730s, Conduitt had become a relatively prominent parliamentary speaker, defending the government on a number of issues, including Walpole's maintenance of the Septennial Act. In 1734, he was re-elected to his seat, but chose to represent Southampton. On 12 January 1736, he introduced a successful bill repealing an early 17th-century act against conjuration and witchcraft. Personal life Shortly after his arrival back in England, he became acquainted with Sir Isaac Newton and his half-niece Catherine Barton. After what must have been a whirlwind romance, they applied to the Faculty Office for a licence, which was granted on 23 August 1717, to marry at St Paul's, Covent Garden. Catherine, then aged 38 years, described herself as 32 years old, Conduitt more correctly as about 30. Despite the licence, they instead married three days later on 26 August in her uncle's parish in the Russell Court Chapel in the church of St Martin in the Fields. Perhaps in an effort to dignify himself for his impending marriage to one of London's famous daughters, Conduitt obtained for himself a grant of arms from the College of Heralds on 16 August. The couple had one daughter, named after her mother, born 23 May 1721 and baptised in the same parish of St Martin's on 8 June. Partly as a result of his antiquarian interests, Conduitt was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 1 December 1718, proposed by the president, and his uncle by marriage, Sir Isaac Newton. Sir Isaac Newton took up residence at Cranbury with his niece and her husband until his death in 1727 towards the end of his life. Death and descendants Conduitt died on 23 May 1737 and was buried on 29 May in Westminster Abbey, next to Sir Isaac Newton.'The Abbey Scientists' Hall, A.R. p12: London; Roger & Robert Nicholson; 1966 His wife Catherine died in 1739 and was buried with him. In his will, dated 1732, he had left his estate to his wife and made her guardian of their underage daughter Catherine. Upon his death, the trustees sold the estate at Cranbury Park as well as estates at Weston and Netley, near Southampton, to Thomas Lee Dummer, who succeeded Conduitt as MP for Southampton. In 1740 his daughter Catherine married John Wallop, Viscount Lymington, the eldest son of the Earl of Portsmouth. Catherine's son John Wallop succeeded his grandfather to the peerage.

Military psychiatry encompasses counseling individuals and families on a variety of life issues, often from the standpoint of life strategy counseling, as well as counseling for mental health issues, substance abuse prevention and substance abuse treatment; and where called for, medical treatment for biologically based mental illness, among other elements. A military psychiatrist is a psychiatrist‚Äîwhether uniformed officer or civilian consultant‚Äîspecializing in the treatment of military personnel and military family members suffering from mental disorders that occur within the statistical norm for any population, as well as those disorders consequent to warfare and also stresses associated with military life.

Career =High school= Born in La Belle, Pennsylvania, Jansante first played his first game of football, in 1939, under Alex Ufema at Bentleyville High School in Bentleyville, Pennsylvania . Which was his senior year in high school. . He played running back and end and racked up 9 touchdowns. Three TDs were against Ellsworth High all for more than 40 yards per score. Jansante also was a star basketball player and was awarded the prestigious top athlete award of the area known as the Mid-Mon Valley Award due to his success in both sports. =College= In college, Jansante was one of Buff Donelli‚Äôs star pupils at Duquesne University. He played on the team during its 26 game winning streak. Duquesne was undefeated in 1941. At that time, Duquesne University played big time Division I football. Because of World War II, Jansante went into the Navy in 1943 and was discharged in 1945 and joined the Steelers. During part of his service time Jansante spent a semester as a student at Harvard University in Massachusetts. In 1943, Jansante was a student and varsity football player at Villanova University. Perhaps his biggest game of his career, the game that changed his future, was when Villanova was scrimmaging the ‚ÄúSteagles‚Äù (combined Steelers and Philadelphia Eagles due to World War II) and Jansante sacked the quarterback five times and caught seven receptions. Bert Bell, from the Steelers‚Äô front office, immediately put Jansante on the NFL draft list. Then, he played for the Naval Base Fleet City team stationed out of Oakland, California. The Fleet City team played against professional teams that were still in existence during the war. Jansante‚Äôs first 6 pass receptions were for touchdowns in 1945, and the unbeaten Fleet City football team won the championship. =NFL= Jansante was a tenth round draft pick in 1944 but because of his service in World War II, did not join the team until 1946. Immediately Jansante led the team in receptions, but he needed only 10 to earn that distinction in 1946. A year later, in 1947, he set club records with 35 catches for 599 yards and 5 touchdowns, leading the Eastern Division in receiving until the last game of the season. That was the first year the Steelers went to a postseason game, with an 8-4 record. It would be their only postseason competition until Franco Harris' ‚ÄúImmaculate Reception‚Äù of 1972. Jansante broke his mark in 1948 with 39 receptions for 623 yards. In addition, he led the Steelers in pass receptions in 1949 and 1950. Also in 1950, Jansante led the entire NFL with 8.5 quarterback sacks from the defensive end position. Jansante was a two-way starter for the Pittsburgh Steelers from the first day he stepped onto the field in 1946. He played six seasons with the Steelers in which he was named First Team and Second Team All-Pro. With 154 receptions in six seasons, Jansante held the reception record for a while and was among the top 10 pass catchers for a number of years for the Steelers. There were two games in which he caught 10 passes. The first was in 1949 in a game against Philadelphia; the quarterback attempted a total of 10 passes and Jansante caught all ten. The second game with 10 receptions was against Los Angeles in 1950. In the 75 year Steelers‚Äô history, Val is eighth on the all- time list for most receptions in a single game. In 1951, while leading the club with 15 receptions in mid-season, following the 6th game, he left the Steelers to join the Green Bay Packers as a running back. He played 3 games for the Packers, and was listed by the team as an end. Jansante played for conservative coaches Dr. Jock Sutherland and John Michelosen. It was both coaches‚Äô style not to throw the football. He was the first of the Steelers to catch double-digit (10) passes in a single game, so it is a surprise that even 10 passes were thrown in Jansante‚Äôs big days. Retirement After retiring from football, Jansante was a teacher and head football coach at Central Catholic High School in Pittsburgh, Mon Valley Catholic High School in Monongahela, and Bentworth High School in Bentleyville. He coached both boys and girls athletics in the WPIAL (Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League, District 7) for more than 25 years. Jansante resided in Bentleyville, Pennsylvania until his death. Legacy In 1983 when the Steelers were celebrating the 50th year in the National Football League, Jansante was on the All Time Greatest Steelers Ballot. Art Rooney, Sr., founder of the team, said he had fond memories of Jansante. ‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt any better than Jansante,‚Äù he recalled. Jansante is also listed as one of the All Time Greatest Steelers in the 1998 book, Total Steelers, ‚ÄúThe Official Encyclopedia of the Pittsburgh Steelers.‚Äù In 1999, he had the distinction of being listed as one of only six receivers to be considered on the ballot for the Pittsburgh Steelers All Century Team. In 2001, he was honored with the opening of the new Heinz Field by being one of 12 members of the 1947 first playoff team. Again in 2007, he was the honorary team captain for the coin toss when the Steelers played the San Francisco 49ers as one of the players from the 1940s decade. He has been honored by being placed in the Duquesne University Sports Hall of Fame, the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame, the Italian-American Sports Hall of Fame, and in 2000 he was inducted into the Mid Mon Valley Sports Hall of Fame at the same time as the NFL Great Joe Montana. Until 2006, Jansante was the only Steeler in the history of the club to lead the team 5 consecutive years in receiving; Super Bowl XL MVP, Hines Ward broke his 50 + year record. This is quite and accomplishment considering the forward pass wasn‚Äôt nearly as popular or effective when Val Jansante played. In the Single Wing that Pittsburgh played at the time, Jansante was considered the best pass catcher in Steelers history and was often compared to Pro Football Hall of Fame player, Don Hutson of the Green Bay Packers.

The synod oversees sixteen presbyteries covering all of Pennsylvania, most of West Virginia, and a portion of eastern Ohio.  History  The Presbyterian Church in the United States of America has its roots in the territory of the Synod of the Trinity, which was founded as the Synod of Philadelphia in 1717 following the division of the Presbytery of Philadelphia into three presbyteries (Philadelphia, New Castle, and Long Island), with the synod as a superior body. After the Presbytery of New Brunswick was expelled from the synod in 1741 during a major division in the church, Jonathan Dickinson left the synod in 1745 to form the Synod of New York. An advocate of the Great Awakening, Dickinson founded a seminary that later became Princeton University.Jonathan Dickinson, Princeton The synod was reunited as the Synod of New York and Philadelphia in 1758.

When the General Assembly decided in 1973 to create regional judicatories, the synod was merged with the Synod of West Virginia to form the Synod of Pennsylvania-West Virginia. Finally, when church reunion occurred in 1983, presbyteries in a portion of eastern Ohio were joined to the synod and the name was changed to the Synod of the Trinity.

Paul Masquelier, critic for the controversial review El√©ments El√©ments is one of the reviews of the ethnonationalist Groupement de recherche et d'√©tudes pour la civilisation europ√©enne. has pointed out the narcissistic or regressive aspects of his paintings, while conceding their social commentary and the feeling of joie de vivre they convey. However, the core of his artistic practice is elsewhere. Bicha Gallery outlined it as follows: \\"Eric's work is more drawing than painting. It is a game with lines, first drawn in a spontaneous manner, random ‚Äì much like a child doodling ‚Äì then worked and reworked again and again until something new, a precise figure, character, emerges from this chaos.

Six years later he published a dark psychological thriller, Les Voleurs d'Enfant (The Child Thieves),'Editions de la M√©duse' (Lille, France). depicting a cult against the cults.

For example in the self-referential verse: \\"All scripture is given by inspiration of God [...]\\" (2 Timothy 3:16). It entails, but is not exhausted by, questions raised by biblical inerrancy, biblical infallibility, biblical interpretation, biblical criticism, and Biblical law in Christianity. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, a debate over biblical authority arose between Jack B. Rogers and Donald K. McKim, on the one hand, and John D. Woodbridge, on the other. Rogers and McKim, in their 1979 book, The Authority and Interpretation of the Bible: An Historical Approach, advanced the view that the Bible has authority over social endeavors (issuing imperatives for conduct, for church organization, and for articles of faith) but isn't necessarily reliable in its reportage of historical events and scientific facts. The belief that Scripture is \\"inerrant\\" in matters of history and science, argued Rogers and McKim, constituted a 19th-century innovation. Woodbridge challenged this thesis in his 1982 book Biblical Authority: A Critique of the Rogers/McKim Proposal, arguing that for each of those categories, God's Word has authority and is without error. Moreover, Woodbridge asserted that this particular view of biblical authority had been the normative, orthodox position throughout the history of Christianity.

[:U. glabra] in some Armenian and Russian plant lists.agbina.com/site.xp/053051057124049053049048.html For a time, the Sp√§th nursery, Berlin, distributed a disputed cultivar, U. Heyderi, as a synonym of U. elliptica Koch (see Cultivation below). Description U. elliptica was said by Henry to resemble U. glabra in size, form, leaf, petiole and branchlets, but to resemble U. rubra in its samara, pubescent only over the seed. Henry noted one other difference from U. glabra ‚Äì a smooth leaf ‚Äì and two differences from U. rubra, the samara of the latter being \\"much smaller\\" than that of U. elliptica, and the branchlets of the latter having tubercles where those of U. elliptica are smooth. Bean added that U. elliptica differed from U. glabra in the \\"rusty hairs on the buds and the ciliate leaves\\" and from U. rubra in having less fissured bark, thinner and more sharply toothed leaves, and \\"more elongate\\" samarae. Kr√ºssman gives the leaf-size of U. elliptica as 8‚Äì14 cm long. Image:Ulmus elliptica samara.jpgU. elliptica samara Pests and diseases Unknown. Cultivation U. Heyderi, Sp√§th's cultivar name for U. elliptica Koch, appeared in the nursery's catalogues from 1883. It was described as having \\"large, long, rough, downy leaves\\". One tree was planted in 1896 as U. elliptica, Koch; syns. U. Heyderi, Spaeth; U. sibirica, Hort., at the Dominion Arboretum, Ottawa, Canada. Sp√§th supplied the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1902 with three specimens each of U. fulva [:U. rubra] and U. Heyderi. The latter may survive in Edinburgh, as it was the practice of the Garden to distribute trees about the city (viz. the Wentworth Elm); the current list of Living Accessions held in the Garden per se does not list the plant. A tree listed as U. elliptica stood in the Ryston Hall arboretum, Norfolk,rystonhall.co.uk/ in the early 20th century. Henry, stressing the differences between U. elliptica and U. rubra, held (1913) that Sp√§th's U. Heyderi was, by some error, U. rubra. He believed that U. elliptica Koehne (1893) was described from Sp√§th's U. Heyderi, not from the Caucasus species, and that the U. elliptica of Koehne (1893), of Schneider (1904), and of Ascherson and Graebner (1911), was U. fulva [: U. rubra]. Sp√§th's 1903 catalogue, indeed, queried whether U. Heyderi was after all synonymous with U. elliptica Koch. By 1930 he had removed U. Heyderi from his catalogue but added U. elliptica Koch, as a tree from the Causasus. Krussman (1983) concluded that the cultivation status of U. elliptica Koch / U. Heyderi was uncertain, since it had been confused with U. rubra. Green in his 'Registration of cultivar names in Ulmus' ignored U. Heyderi, as a species synonym.

Heyderi and U. fulva [:U. rubra] Etymology The origin of the cultivar name 'Heyderi' is unknown, though the tree may be named for Edward Heyder (1808-1884) of Berlinhttps://books.google.am/books?id=gf3uCAAAQBAJ&pg;=PA108&dq;=Eduard+Heyder+(1808-1884)+of+Berlin&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjxwu7tu8_pAhXKMZoKHUdgAuIQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q;=Eduard%20Heyder%20(1808-1884)%20of%20Berlin&f;=false. In the Armenian language (one the common languages of Caucus region Koch visited) adding ’´ (pronounced as long 'ƒì' sound) to a proper noun makes that noun possessive. So 'Heyderi' or '’Ä’•’µ’§’•÷Ä’´' would be the possessive form, making Ulmus Heyderi loosely translate to Heyder's Elm.

The British Schools Museum is an educational museum based in original Edwardian and Victorian school buildings in Hitchin in Hertfordshire, England.British Schools Museum, Culture 24, UK. The museum complex is made up of Grade II listed school buildings housing infants, girls and boys schools with houses for Master and Mistress.British Schools Museum , UK School Museums Group , UK. It includes a monitorial schoolroom based on the educational theories of Joseph Lancaster for 300 boys, which opened in 1837, and a rare galleried classroom, dating from 1853. History of the school The school buildings of 1853 (left), 1837 (centre) and 1904 (right). The first school on the site was a schoolroom for 200 boys and 100 girls. It was founded in 1810 by local lawyer William Wilshere in a disused malthouse. This schoolroom was the first monitorial school for the sons of the poor in Hertfordshire. Teaching was based on Joseph Lancaster's methods of monitorial teaching. He developed a system in which large numbers of younger scholars could be taught by older scholars under the supervision of the master (for boys) or mistress (for girls). This method continued until the Revised Code of 1862 that brought in the Pupil Teacher method of teaching.Richard Aldrich, An Introduction to the History of Education (London, 1982), p.55. The monitorial system was changed as it was the general consensus that having children teach other children, when they are not well educated themselves, proved to be problematic. The Pupil Teacher method involved an older scholar being given training and being paid to teach. The government hoped that this would increase the number of teachers in the future, using a system that could be described as an apprenticeship in teaching.P.H.J.H. Gosden, How They Were Taught (Oxford, 1969), p.16. The school grew steadily and to such an extent that in 1837 a new schoolroom was built that could hold 300 boys. This was completed in 1838, and the original school in the converted malthouse then included an infants school as well as the girls'. HM Inspector of Schools Matthew Arnold visited the school in 1852 and reinforced the 1849 recommendation of inspector J D Morrell that the boys' school would benefit from a new classroom. A new Gallery classroom for 110 pupils was completed in February 1854. The 1857 school building with the houses for the Master and Mistress to the left. In 1857, it was decided by the School's Board of Trustees to completely rebuild the Girls' and Infants' School. The new building was completed in 1858 together with adjoining houses for the Master and Mistress. When Matthew Arnold paid a return visit to the school in 1867 he reported that the new buildings were \\"excellent\\". By 1904 additional classrooms were needed because of the growing number of pupils, and these were built in 1905, but by 1929 the school was too small (and quite worn out!) and the Boys' and Girls Schools transferred to the new Wilshere Dacre School in the town. The Infants School carried on in the original buildings, but because of the number of evacuees who were sent to Hitchin at the outbreak of World War II the school reverted to a Junior Mixed Infants School in 1940. This school continued on the site until 1969, when it closed, but the buildings were taken over by North Hertfordshire College as the Queen Street Activities Centre. Recent years The buildings were listed as Grade II in 1975 for their importance as a site of historic school architecture. Mrs Jill Grey, a local educational historian, opened a small museum in one of the Edwardian classrooms. In July 1990 North Herts College left the site and Hertfordshire County Council put the buildings up for sale. The Hitchin British Schools Trust was formed and by 1994 were successful in purchasing the buildings. The Trust, mainly through the efforts of volunteers, has restored the schoolrooms to reflect their original condition, and work continues to improve them. The museum is visited by adults and groups of children from all over the country who are interested in seeing how their ancestors were taught. The BBC filmed scenes from the 2010 children's television series Just William at Hitchin.

Actin alpha 1 which is expressed in skeletal muscle is one of six different actin isoforms which have been identified. Actins are highly conserved proteins that are involved in cell motility, structure and integrity. Alpha actins are a major constituent of the contractile apparatus. Skeletal actin gene expression Skeletal alpha actin expression is induced by stimuli and conditions known to cause muscle formation. Such conditions result in fusion of committed cells (satellite cells) into myotubes, to form muscle fibers. Skeletal actin itself, when expressed, causes expression of several other \\"myogenic genes\\", which are essential to muscle formation. One key transcription factor that activates skeletal actin gene expression is Serum Response Factor (\\"SRF\\"), a protein that binds to specific sites on the promoter DNA of the actin gene. SRF may bring a number of other proteins to the promoter of skeletal actin, such as androgen receptor, and thereby contribute to induction of skeletal actin gene expression by androgenic (often termed \\"anabolic\\") steroids.

His father, John Bard Hymer (1875 or 1876-1953) was a playwright (with nine Broadway plays to his credit, according to the Internet Broadway Database), vaudeville writer and actor, while his mother, Eleanor Kent, was an actress. He appeared in 129 films between 1929 and 1946, as well as the 1928 Broadway play The Grey Fox. Despite his typical screen persona as an unsophisticated tough guy with a Brooklyn accent, he actually attended Yale University. In the late 1930s, Columbia Pictures head Harry Cohn had him removed from the studio after he showed up for work drunk. Hymer responded by breaking into Cohn's office and urinating on his desk. Cohn then blackballed him in the film industry, making it hard for him to find work. He died in Los Angeles, California, of a \\"stomach ailment\\".

Operation Iraqi Freedom Upon return from deployment to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) 1, the 4th Infantry Division immediately began reorganization into the \\"modular brigade\\" structure of the new US Army. The 4th Infantry Division was again deployed to OIF in late 2005, replacing 3rd Infantry Division in Baghdad. The 3rd Brigade was attached to the 101st Airborne Division and the 1‚Äì68 was sent to Baqubah, Iraq. Before recent deployment, it was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel George S Dotson. The 1st Battalion, 68th Armor Regiment was deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom from 1 December 2007 to 1 March 2009. Alpha Company was sent to FOB Prosperity attached to 3-29 FA manning coalition checkpoints in central Baghdad's International Zone. Headquarters and Headquarter Company (HHC) was set in at COP Callahan, a converted shopping mall. COP Callahan also housed Delta, Echo, and Fox Companies while Charlie Company occupied COP Ford. At the end of February Alpha Company rejoined the battalion and was sent to JSS Ur. Alpha Company along with elements of 4/64, 3 ID began conducting combat patrols in the Hy Ur and Sadr City districts as a mechanized infantry company. On 8 July members of the Jaysha Madi and Hezbollah successfully deployed 10 Improvised Rocket Assisted Mortars directed at Alpha Company at JSS Ur. 9 of the 10 IRAMs exploded inside the JSS, destroying the Aerostat Balloon which had coverage over most important routes and checkpoints in the area. Alpha company was then sent to FOB Apache(Gunner's Palace) while 3rd Platoon Alpha company was detached to Delta company for the remainder of the deployment and sent to JSS Shaab. COP Callahan was abandoned for COP Bastintine at the end of 2008. All 1-68 soldiers returned to Ft. Carson, CO by the end of March 2009 being relieved by the 1st Cavalry Division. After being reorganized, the 1st Battalion, 68th Armor Regiment became known as the 1st Combined Arms Battalion, 68th Armor Regiment. HHC became known as Havoc with scouts, snipers, mortars and medics and staff positions. Alpha company, known as Attack, and Bravo, known as Blackhawk, were designated as infantry companies with M2A3 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. Charlie company, known as Steel, and Delta, known as Destroyer, were set up as tank companies with 14 M1A2 Main Battle Tanks each. Echo company, known as Exile, became an engineering company. Foxtrot company, known as Forerunner, was attached from 64th Brigade Support Battalion to provide dining facility (DFAC), maintenance/recovery and a supply distribution platoon. The final company is Golf Company which is the rear-detachment company for the battalion when deployed.

Avoiding paradoxes in the standard black hole model  For a black hole to physically exist as a solution to Einstein's equation, it must form an event horizon in finite time relative to outside observers. This requires an accurate theory of black hole formation, of which several have been proposed. In 2007, Shuan Nan Zhang of Tsinghua University proposed a model in which the event horizon of a potential black hole only forms (or expands) after an object falls into the existing horizon, or after the horizon has exceeded the critical density. In other words, an infalling object causes the horizon of a black hole to expand, which only occurs after the object has fallen into the hole, allowing an observable horizon in finite time. This solution does not solve the information paradox, however.  Alternative black hole models  Nonsingular black hole models have been proposed since theoretical problems with black holes were first realized. Today some of the most viable candidates for the end result of the collapse of a star with mass well above the Chandrasekhar limit include the gravastar and the dark energy star. While black holes were a well-established part of mainstream physics for most of the end of the 20th century, alternative models received new attention when models proposed by George Chapline and later by Lawrence Krauss, Dejan Stojkovic, and Tanmay Vachaspati of Case Western Reserve University showed in several separate models that black hole horizons could not form. Such research has attracted much media attention, as black holes have long captured the imagination of both scientists and the public for both their innate simplicity and mysteriousness. The recent theoretical results have therefore undergone much scrutiny and most of them are now ruled out by theoretical studies. For example, several alternative black hole models were shown to be unstable in extremely fast rotation, which, by conservation of angular momentum, would be a not unusual physical scenario for a collapsed star (see pulsar). Nevertheless, the existence of a stable model of a nonsingular black hole is still an open question. =Hayward metric= The Hayward metric is the simplest description of a black hole which is non-singular. The metric was written down by Sean Hayward as the minimal model which is regular, static, spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat.

The larva is 0.35 mm long Glochidia of the mussel Lampsilis higginsii The glochidium (plural glochidia) is a microscopic larval stage of some freshwater mussels, aquatic bivalve mollusks in the families Unionidae and Margaritiferidae, the river mussels and European freshwater pearl mussels. This larva form has hooks, which enable it to attach itself to fish (for example to the gills of a fish host species) for a period before it detaches and falls to the substrate and takes on the typical form of a juvenile mussel. Since a fish is active and free-swimming, this process helps distribute the mussel species to potential areas of habitat that it could not reach any other way. Before the origin of this larval form was understood, it used to be described as \\"parasitic worms\\" on the fish host, although under normal circumstances, glochidia do not harm fish. Overexposure or heavy infections of glochidia may however greatly decrease the host's ability to respire. This is because the tissue which is heavily covered in glochidia will eventually convert to scar tissue and lose functionality. Some mussels in the Unionidae, such as Ptychobranchus fasciolaris and P. greenii, release their glochidia in mucilaginous packets called conglutinates. The conglutinate has a sticky filament that allows it to adhere to the substrate so it is not washed away. There is also an even more specialized way of dispersal known as a super-conglutinate. The super- conglutinate resembles an aquatic fly larva or a fish egg, complete with a dark area that looks like an eyespot, and it is appetizing to fish. When a fish consumes it, it breaks up, releasing the glochidia. Mussels that produce conglutinates and super-conglutinates are often gill parasites, the glochidia attaching to the fish gills to continue their development into juveniles.

He was best known for portraying drug kingpin Proposition Joe on the HBO drama series The Wire. Early life Chew was born on December 28, 1960 in Baltimore. He graduated from Patterson Park High School and then studied music at Morgan State University. Career Chew starred in the HBO drama series The Wire as drug kingpin Proposition Joe on all five seasons of the show. The role had drawn acclaim for Chew both for his ability to handle the character's verbose dialogue and the sympathy he drew while playing a \\"bad guy.\\" Chew recalled that when he auditioned, the other actors were all well groomed, well dressed and thinner than he was. He later learned that the real-life inspiration for the character was a charming and debonair drug dealer so he was surprised to have received the role. He was initially unsure as to how long the character would remain in the series and so he was pleased to be one of the few characters from the drug world who appeared in all five seasons. Chew also appeared on HBO's The Corner (created by David Simon, as was The Wire) and NBC's Homicide: Life on the Street (based on a book by Simon). He received all three roles through the Pat Moran casting agency. Simon has described Chew as a \\"smart, elegant actor\\" and stated that he has one of the most authentic Baltimore accents on the show. Chew also worked with children's theatre companies throughout his career including Playworks USA and later the Arena Players. Through his association with the Arena Players, Moran began to turn to Chew for help in casting local young actors for the show. He provided more than twenty actors and more than six have had recurring roles including Melvin Russell (who plays Jamal) and brother and sister Rashad Orange (who plays Sherrod) and Rakiya Orange who plays Charlene Young. Chew worked as an acting coach with several of the young actors joining the show in the fourth season and with non-professional actor Felicia \\"Snoop\\" Pearson. As acting coach Chew was responsible for preparing the core of four new young actors Tristan Wilds, Julito McCullum, Maestro Harrell and Jermaine Crawford for their major roles in the fourth season. Chew described his aim as helping the young actors find the roles within themselves and looking for what is real. Chew worked with Wilds to perfect the internalized build-up of emotion in his character, Michael Lee, and to convey the character through looks and physical acting rather than dialogue. Chew remarked that he was also impressed with Wilds' professionalism and commitment, McCullum's natural ability as Namond Brice, Harrell's charm as Randy Wagstaff and Crawford's honesty of performance as Duquan \\"Dukie\\" Weems. Chew found working with young people rewarding because it allowed him to see them develop and bring them to their full potential. Chew also appeared in HBO films' Something the Lord Made. Chew appeared on Homicide, in the three part episode \\"Blood Ties\\", playing Wilkie Collins, a drug kingpin who hates violence. Death Chew died from a heart attack at his Baltimore home on January 17, 2013, at the age of 52.

Since the sport's inception in 1999, stunt scooters have significantly evolved. For example, the scooter company Razor shifted from only producing standard Razor A models to also making custom- built scooters and incorporating parts from other companies. As the sport grew, businesses and systems were created to support the growth of the scootering community. An example of an early support system is the Scooter Resource (SR) forums, which helped grow the scootering community by connecting people interested in scootering in 2006. As scootering became more popular, there was a demand for stronger aftermarket parts and for scooter shops to carry those parts.

For the most part of the series, Hibari is portrayed as an anti- hero, taking little to no interest in the events that surround the protagonist, Tsuna Sawada. He is introduced as the leader of the Disciplinary Committee at Tsuna's school, Namimori Middle. Despite his status, he is a delinquent who uses violence to create his own form of order in school, as well as enforcing it throughout certain parts of the town of Namimori. Apart from the manga and anime, Hibari has also appeared in other media from the Reborn! franchise including video games and novels. Hibari's character has been well received by readers since his introduction. He has ranked as one of the most popular characters in every official Shonen Jump poll of the series, taking the top spot twice. In an annual survey conducted by Japanese music distributor Recochoku, Hibari has been named the number one anime character that people would like to marry for two consecutive years. Also, his and Mukuro Rokudo's character CD entitled \\"Sakura addiction\\" became the most successful Reborn! character CD, peaking at seventh place on the Oricon charts. Their performance earned each of their voice actors a Seiyu Awards' nomination for \\"Best Musical Performance\\". Merchandise based on his appearance has also been released including key chains and action figures.  Character outline  =Personality= Head of the Middle School's Discipline Committee of Prefects,who are actually all delinquents, Hibari is known for using his status to enforce his own order throughout all of Namimori Town. Despite the students' and other residents' fear of him, they respect and rely on him since his presence acts as a deterrent to other forms of trouble. Having great pride in his school, even using its anthem as his ringtone, Hibari is especially protective of it and dislikes it when the \\"peace\\" in Namimori is disrupted. The only thing greater than his school pride is his own self pride, opting to ignore the damage inflicted on the school building just for a chance to fight Mukuro Rokudo, whom defeated him before, once more. He dislikes crowds, preferring to be alone, and often says to anyone in his way. He is very confident in his abilities but since he cares little about the events surrounding the other characters, he only involves himself when there is a worthy opponent to fight. Though he has a preference for strong opponents, taking a special interest in the Arcobaleno baby, Reborn, he has no qualms in beating down those he deem weak, whom he calls \\"herbivores\\". These traits make him an optimal candidate for the Vongola's Cloud Guardian, who is the one who protects the family from outside opposition while remaining a standalone force. Despite his cold and violent exterior, he actually has soft spot for small animals such as Hibird and Roll, and small children such as I-Pin. His future self embodies this as he is stated to be the Vongola X's strongest guardian yet his allegiance remains a mystery to his enemies. His present self eventually comes to terms with his role but dislikes it when others associate him with Tsuna's group. = Weapons and abilities = Throughout the series, Hibari has displayed amazing feats of speed, reflexes, and strength. He is ranked as the strongest Namimori student by the young statistician, Futa, and is also remarked to have an unlimited potential for growth by the Chiavarone's Mafia boss, Dino. His primary weapons are a pair of collapsible steel tonfas which have several hidden compartments containing chains and different types of spikes. After becoming a Vongola Guardian, he acquires the \\"Vongola Cloud Ring\\", a special high level ring that helps in manifesting his cloud wave energy into purple flames which possess propagation characteristics. Hibari possesses strong amounts of wave energy, so much so that when his future self uses normal rings, they shatter shortly after. Future Hibari has also acquired special boxes which release flame covered tonfas or hedgehogs when activated by his rings. Using his flame's characteristics, the hedgehogs can multiply, expand its spikes, or grow into a huge spiked sphere that can either damage everything it touches or encase people within an airtight space. When Hibari uses his Vongola Ring with his Vongola Box, it releases a hedgehog he later names \\"Roll\\". When in its Cambio Forma state, Roll transforms into the \\"Alaude Handcuffs\\". Hibari is able to trap his opponents by multiplying the amount and size of the handcuffs until they become physical restraints. The handcuffs and chains can then tighten until his opponent is squeezed to death. After his Vongola Ring is shattered, he acquires its upgraded form, the Vongola Gear's \\"Bracelet of the Clouds\\". When he uses the bracelet to summon Roll and activates its Cambio Forma state, Hibari's uniform and tonfas are altered. It also makes it possible for him to still materialize the Alaude Handcuffs as well. Plot overview Adult Hibari as depicted in the future. After his introduction, he rarely appears, and his few appearances usually end violently. During an encounter with Dr. Shamal, however, he gets infected with the Sakura-kura disease, which makes him weak around cherry blossoms. When he later faces Mukuro Rokudo, the latter quickly defeats him by using his weakness to cherry blossoms. Soon after, he receives the cure and fights Mukuro again, dealing a critical blow before collapsing due to his previous injuries. Iemitsu Sawada later chooses Hibari to be the holder of the Vongola's Cloud Ring. After training with Dino, Hibari appears during the Vongola Tournament and swiftly defeats the Varia's Gola Moska. He then challenges Xanxus, but is interrupted by a malfunctioning Moska. During the group battle, Hibari cures himself of a paralyzing poison injected into him and briefly fights Belphegor. Hibari becomes the Vongola's Cloud Guardian after Tsuna's side reigns victorious. In the story's alternate future (nearly ten years later), after future Hibari defeats the Millefiore member Gamma, he trains the past's Tsuna. He also explains to Tsuna's group about the special boxes, which Hibari had been researching, having even started an organization called \\"The Foundation\\". After acting as a decoy when the Millefiore raids their base, Hibari infiltrates the enemy's Melone Base. He engages Genkishi in battle, but is replaced by his younger self in the midst of it. Though the past's Hibari is able to open a box weapon that releases a hedgehog, it goes berserk after injuring Hibari and expands its spikes at great speed, separating his group from Genkishi. After reuniting and returning to Namimori, Hibari encounters future Dino, who teaches him how to control his box weapon. He returns to join the others in the battle against the Six Funeral Wreaths, where he manages to defeat Daisy using his Vongola Box. After returning to his own time, the arrival of the Shimon Family at Namimori results in him briefly clashing with one of its members, Adelheid Suzuki, who desired the disbandment of Hibari's Disciplinary Committee. When he attends Tsuna's Inheritance Ceremony, he is defeated by the Shimon's leader, Enma. Since his Cloud Ring is shattered in the fight, he acquires its upgraded form, the Vongola Gear's Bracelet of the Clouds. When he arrives on the Shimon's island, he proceeds to defeat Adelheid in battle.  Appearances in other media  Besides his appearance in the original manga series and its anime adaptation, Hibari has appeared in other Reborn! works, including all of the series' video games. In some games, his future self appears as a playable character. He also stars in one of the Hidden Bullet light novels called Extreme Memories, which is set before the start of the series. On November 7, 2007, Pony Canyon released a character CD entitled \\"Sakura addiction\\", which features the characters of Hibari and Mukuro. It contains duets and individual songs sung by both of their voice actors: Takashi Kond≈ç and Toshinobu Iida. The song \\"Sakura addiction\\", which was sung by both voice actors, is used as the fifth ending theme for the anime series.  Reception  Several pieces of merchandising based on Hibari's appearance have been released. These include key chains, action figures and cosplays. Hibari and Mukuro's character CD, \\"Sakura addiction\\", became the most successful Reborn! character CD, debuting in ninth place in the Oricon charts. The single reached its peak at seventh place, but remained in the chart's Top 40 till mid-January 2008. The second annual Seiyu Awards nominated both Takashi Kondo and Toshinobu Iida for \\"Best Musical Performance\\", but they did not win it. Hibari has been highly popular with the Reborn! reader base, ranking as the fourth most popular character with a total of 1769 votes in the official Shonen Jump poll of the series. In the second poll which was divided between heroes and villains, Hibari ranked as the second most popular hero losing to Tsuna Sawada. In the third poll of the series, Hibari ranked as the most popular male character, while in the fourth he ranked second, losing to Tsuna. In the fifth poll, he ranked as the second most popular overall character, while in the sixth, he ranks number one once again. The Japanese music distributor Recochoku has made two annual survey of which anime characters that people would like to marry. In both years, Hibari ranked number one in the category \\"The Character I Want to Be My Groom.\\" In the Animedia character popularity poll, Hibari has been featured as from the 2nd and 4th most popular anime character as well as the 2nd highest male character. Manga News noted that despite Hibari's introduced as an anti-hero, he is shown as a strong character who might become one of Tsuna's strongest allies thanks to this skills in combat. In another review, while liking the character, Manga News did not appreciate how Hibari and other supporting characters appeared in gag chapters. Although Sam Kusek from popcultureshock.com liked Hibari's fighting scenes in volume 9 from the series, he mentioned that the \\"real winners\\" were Tsuna and Mukuro Rokudo. While reviewing the Reborn! gashapon, Anime News Network's Rob Bricken commented he was confused why Hibari's figure is dressed as a policeman despite praising how it is done. In a review of a following arc, Manga News referred to Hibari as one of the most charismatic characters within the manga which generated positive response when he appeared to join the Vongola in the fight against the Varia. His next fight against Varia's Gola Mosca generated surprise to the reviewer due to how short it is due to Hibari defeating Mosca in only two pages which also shows a big impact in the characters.

It has a length of 56 km. The Rot runs in a northerly direction parallel to the river Iller to the east, and Westernach to the west. Both these rivers are also tributaries to the Danube.  Geography  The Rot originates in the district of Biberach in the vicinity of the village of Rot an der Rot, when two streams merge, the Paffenrieder Bach from the south and the Sendener Bach from the south-west. The Rot meanders north through its increasingly widening valley, the heights of which are covered by woods, whereas the river itself is embedded first by moorland and wet meadows, later by fields. Passing Rot an der Rot, where it is joined by the small river Haslach, the Rot flows through Eichenberg, Gutenzell-H√ºrbel, Schwendi, Burgrieden towards Achstetten and Stetten. From Schwendi onwards the river has been channelised, with a weir at Achstetten to slow down the flow of the water. Here the river forks, parts of the river are allowed to follow the original meandering bed whereas the main body of water follows the channelised route. After about 1,5 km the two merge again. The Rot then flows through Dellmensingen, situated in the Alb-Donau District. North of Dellmensingen most of the waters of the Rot flow through an artificially created channel into the reservoir of a hydroelectric plant near Donaustetten. The remaining waters of the Rot keep flowing in its original stream bed to empty into the Danube north of Donaustetten.

MIBA operate near Mbuji Mayi, in Kasai-Oriental Province in south central DRC. Approximately 80% of MIBA's stock is owned by the Congolese government, with 20% owned by former Umicore subsidiary Sibeka, which in turn is owned by Mwana Africa plc, which operates the mines. The MIBA employees went on strike several times for not being paid for approximately 2 years. The majority of the population in Congo believe that the company's money is being embezzled by the head of the Congolese government Joseph Kabila and his collaborators. This is the reason why employees suffer and haven't been paid for two years. History Diamond mining slag heaps in Bakwanga, Kasai, 1950 The company that is now known as MIBA was originally formed as La Societe Miniere du Beceka, in 1919, with the specific purpose of exploiting the mineral riches in the area of Mbuji-Mayi. In the 1950s, it was estimated that the city, then known as Bakwanga, and its surrounding area had the world's most important deposit of diamonds, with at least 300 million karats. Beceka transferred its assets to MIBA in 1961. Independence from Belgium did not necessarily slow the extraction of diamonds, but it did seriously affect MIBA's dominance of the region's diamond trade. In 1959, the year before Congolese independence, MIBA reportedly produced 14.1 million karats of diamonds, and in 1961 set a record production rate with 18 million karats of diamonds. But by 1963, the numbers had fallen dramatically in the wake of years of turmoil, including an attempt to establish the region as the independent Mining State of South Kasai. In that year, the company produced just 1.4 million karats of diamonds, almost all of them industrial diamonds. By contrast, between 4 million and 6 million karats of diamonds were produced by diamond smugglers who had previously been tightly controlled by the Belgian colonial administrators, to the benefit of the company's Belgian management. The company's profits were also commandeered by the South Kasai government of rebel leader Albert Kalonji. In 1961, those profits were estimated to be $12 million. Despite the smuggling and regional turmoil, the company was extremely dominant in the world's diamond trade. In 1963, MIBA produced 80 percent of the world's industrial diamonds and 57 percent of all diamonds.

The purpose of the committee was to promote the cause of Indian Independence. Initially called the Berlin‚ÄìIndian Committee, the organisation was renamed the Indian Independence Committee in 1915 and came to be an integral part of the Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy. Members of the committee included Virendranath Chattopadhyaya (alias Chatto), Chempakaraman Pillai, Dr Jnanendra Das Gupta, and Abinash Bhattacharya Background A number of Indians, notably Shyamji Krishna Varma, had formed the India House in England in 1905. This organisation, with the support of Indian luminaries like Dadabhai Naoroji, Lala Lajpat Rai, Madame Bhikaji Cama and others, offered scholarships to Indian students, promoted nationalistic work, and was a major platform for anti-colonial opinions and views. The Indian Sociologist, published by Krishna Varma, was a notable anti-colonial publication. Prominent Indian Nationalists associated with the India House included Vinayak Damodar Savarkar or Veer Savarkar, Virendranath Chattopadhyaya (alias Chatto), and Har Dayal. The British government kept track of India House because of the nature of its work and the increasingly inciting tone of The Indian Sociologist, which proposed killing British colonial officials. English detectives followed and watched the student leaders in India House. In 1909, Madan Lal Dhingra, closely associated with the India House, shot and killed William Hutt Curzon Wyllie, the political ADC to the Secretary of State for India. In the aftermath of the assassination, India House was rapidly suppressed. Evidence found showed that Browning pistols were being sent to India in order to bring about an armed revolution. Savarkar was deported while Krishna Varma fled to Europe. Those who continued the struggle, including Virendranath Chattopadhyaya, moved to Germany, while a number of the leadership moved to Paris. This set of fugitives would later coalesce in he Berlin Committee. World War I At the outbreak of World War I, Indian nationalists looked for ways to use the enmities to support their goals. As early as 1912, the German Foreign Office had considered supporting the Pan-Islamist and Bengali revolutionary movement in India to weaken the British position. The Kaiser had considered the option on 31 July 1914 when Russian mobilisation was confirmed, and the scope of British mobilisation against Germany was becoming evident. In September 1914, the German Chancellor, Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, was authorised by the Kaiser to sanction German activity against British India. The German effort was headed by Max von Oppenheim, an archaeologist and the head of the newly formed Intelligence Bureau for the East. He was to organize the Indian student groups into a cohesive group. Oppenheim also convinced Har Dayal of the feasibility of the project. A group of Indians resident in Germany, headed by M. Prabhakar (then teaching at D√ºsseldorf after graduating from Heidelberg), along with Abd ur Rahman and A Siddiqui, had issued statements condemning England and France for their support of the Czar in Russia. As these students were political novices, Oppenheim sought to find more prominent revolutionaries who would carry more weight in the community. Otto Gunther von Wesendonck, a young officer of the Ausw√§rtiges Amt, was given the task of organising revolutionary outbreaks along the Indian and Russian border. with the help of their close acquaintance Anna Maria Simon, Abhinash Bhattacharya and Virendranath Chattopadhyaya issued similar statements against Britain and France, which were distributed in Austria-Hungary, Switzerland and the Netherlands in addition to Germany, attracting editorial comments. The duo, with the help of Frau Simon, set up meetings with the Berlin Foreign office. =Berlin Committee= Arriving at Berlin, they were assigned a building in the Sch√∂neberg suburbs, as their new headquarters. In their first meeting with the foreign office liaison Max von Oppenheim, on 3 September 1915, Chattopadhyay (also known as Chatto) identified the goals and requirements of the committee: *For the Germans to provide money, arms, experts in military strategy *Facilitate repatriation of Indian patriots in Europe and provide asylum in case of failure (and not yield to pressure as had happened in the case of Savarkar) *train Indians at Spandau and other military bases, including on submarine mines *publish literature in Indian languages *provide aircraft for propaganda airdrops *provide 10 rupee banknotes for secret use *support with radio communication *no concession to Indian Principalities opposed to the plan to form a Socialist Republic With the help of Oppenheim, messages were sent out to Indian students in German universities, as well as Switzerland, Austria and the Netherlands, who were likely to share the same views. Among those who joined the organisation at the time were Dr. Dhiren Sarkar, Chanji Kersasp, N. S. Marathe, Dr. J. N. Dasgupta, and C. Padmanabhan Pillai, quickly joined by his brother, Champak Raman Pillai. The 'Champak- Chatto' Berlin Committee was founded. Although the group urged him, Oppenheim refused to approach Shyamji Krishnavarma, then in Geneva, nor did he try to reach Lala Lajpat Rai, then in the United States. The latter was suspected by British intelligence in the United States to be deeply involved in the seditionist movement although he personally refused to enter an alliance with another Imperialist Power. In 1915, Har Dayal and Barkatullah became actively involved in the Berlin Committee and its goals. The committee is known to have sent missions to the Middle Eastern cities of Istanbul and Baghdad, and Kabul, Afghanistan. Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy The committee soon established contacts with Indian revolutionaries, including Bagha Jatin. They visited armament and explosives factories to identify war material, and met with Indian prisoners-of-war held in Germany to recruit them to the nationalist cause. Lala Har Dayal, who had fled to Germany after his arrest in the United States, was convinced to lend his support to the committee's cause. They established contacts with the Ghadarite movement in the United States. Dr. Dhiren Sarkar and N.S. Marathe left for Washington, D.C. on 22 September 1915 and, through the German Ambassador, Johann von Bernstoff, established links with the Ghadar Party. The culmination of the American efforts was the Annie Larsen arms plot. =Kabul mission= The Berlin-Indian Committee (which became the Indian Independence Committee after 1915) created an Indo-German- Turkish mission to the Indo-Iranian border to encourage the tribes to strike against British interests. At this time, the Berlin Committee was in touch with the Khairi brothers (Abdul Jabbar Khairi and Abdul Sattar Khairi) who had settled in Istanbul at the onset of the World War I. In 1917 they had proposed to the Kaiser a plan to lead tribes in Kashmir and North-West Frontier Province against British interests. Another group, led by the Deobandi Maulana Ubaid Allah Sindhi and Mahmud al-Hasan (principle of the Darul Uloom Deoband), had traveled to Kabul in October 1915 with plans to initiate a Muslim insurrection in the tribal belt of India. Ubaid Allah proposed that the Amir of Afghanistan should declare war against Britain while Mahmud al Hasan sought German and Turkish help. Hasan proceeded to Hijaz. Ubaid Allah, in the meantime, established friendly relations with the Amir. At Kabul, Ubaid Allah, along with some students who had preceded him to Ottoman Turkey to join the Caliph's \\"Jihad\\" against Britain, decided that the pan-Islamic cause would be better served by focusing on the Indian Freedom Movement. This group was met by the Indo-German-Turkish mission to Kabul in December 1915, headed by Oskar von Niedermayer and including among its members Werner Otto von Hentig, the German diplomatic representative to Kabul; and Raja Mahendra Pratap, Barkatullah and other prominent nationalists from the Berlin group. Known as the Niedermayer‚ÄìHentig mission, it brought members of the Indian movement to India's border, and carried messages from the Kaiser, Enver Pasha, and Abbas Hilmi, the displaced Khedive of Egypt, expressing support for Pratap's mission. They asked the Amir to move against India. The mission's immediate goal was to rally the Amir against British India and to obtain a right of free passage for the conspirators from the Afghan Government. Although the Amir made no commitment to the group, they found support amongst the Amir's immediate and close political and religious advisory group, including his brother Nasrullah Khan, his sons Inayatullah Khan and AmƒÅnullƒÅh KhƒÅn, and religious leaders and tribesmen. Afghanistan's then most influential newspaper, the Siraj al-Akhbar, took Barkatullah as an officiating editor in early 1916. Its editor Mahmud Tarzi published a number of inflammatory articles by Raja Mahendra Pratap, as well as increasingly anti-British and pro-Central Powers articles and propaganda. By May 1916, the tone in the paper was deemed serious enough for the British Raj to intercept its issues. In 1916, the Berlin Committee established the Provisional Government of India in Kabul. Its formation infers the seriousness of intention and purpose of the revolutionaries. The government had Raja Mahendra Pratap as president, Barkatullah as Prime Minister, Ubaid al Sindhi as the Minister for India, Maulavi Bashir as War Minister and Champakaran Pillai as Foreign Minister. It tried to gain support from the Russian Empire, Republican China, and Japan. Galib Pasha joined them in proclaiming jihad against Britain. Following the February Revolution in Russia in 1917, Pratap's Government is known to have corresponded with the nascent Soviet Government. In 1918, Pratap met the Russian leader Leon Trotsky in Petrograd before meeting the Kaiser in Berlin; he urged both to mobillise against British India. Under pressure from the British, the Afghans withdrew their cooperation and the mission closed down. The Niedermayer‚ÄìHentig Expedition, with associated liaisons of the German mission had a profound effect on the political and social situation in Afghanistan. It catalyzed political change that ended with the assassination of Habibullah in 1919 and the transfer of power to Nasrullah and, subsequently, AmƒÅnullah; the Third Anglo-Afghan War began, which led to Afghan Independence. End of the Indian Independence Committee The committee was formally disbanded in November 1918, with most of the members shifting their attention to the nascent Soviet Russia. Between 1917 and 1920, most of the members became active Communists. Notes References *Newsletter of the Regional Office-South East Asia.

Long abducted, sexually assaulted, and murdered at least 10 women in the Tampa Bay Area in Florida during an eight-month period in 1984. He released one of his last victims, 17-year-old Lisa McVey, after raping her over a period of 26 hours. McVey provided information to the police that enabled them to track him down. Long was sentenced to death for two of the ten murders. He was executed by lethal injection on May 23, 2019. Early life Long was born on October 14, 1953 in Kenova, West Virginia to Joe and Louetta Long. Long was born with an extra X chromosome, also known as 46,XXY, a specific variant of Klinefelter syndrome. This condition results in excessive estrogen production yielding some female traits such as breast development. Long was teased as a child for his large breasts and underwent breast reduction surgery in adolescence. Long also suffered multiple head injuries as a child. Long had a dysfunctional relationship with his mother; he slept in her bed until he was a teenager, and resented her multiple short-term boyfriends. Long married his high school girlfriend in 1974, with whom he had two children before she filed for divorce in 1980. Prior to the Tampa Bay area murders, Long had committed at least 50 rapes as the \\"Classified Ad Rapist\\" in Fort Lauderdale, Ocala, Miami, and Dade County. Starting in 1981, Long answered classified ads for small appliances, and if he found a woman alone at home, he would rape her. Long was tried and convicted for rape in 1981 but requested a new trial, which was granted. The charges were later dropped. Before Long moved to Florida, he lived in Long Beach, California, on the 2500 Block of Eucalyptus Avenue, where he rented a room from a woman named Kathy. Long dated a 17-year-old girl across the street from his rented room. Long began contacting women through the Penny Saver and other classified ads. When Long found a woman alone, he asked to use the bathroom, took out his \\"rape kit\\" and brutally raped and robbed the woman. These crimes were never prosecuted by the local California authorities, in part because the statute of limitations had already expired by the time he was caught. Murders Long moved to the Tampa Bay area in 1983. Long‚Äôs first victim was discovered in May 1984, when the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office (HCSO) was called to a crime scene where the body of a nude woman had been found. This began an intensive investigation into the abduction, rape, and murder of at least 10 women in three counties in the Tampa Bay area (Hillsborough, Pasco, and Pinellas) involving the personnel from the HCSO, the FBI, the Tampa Police Department (TPD), the Pasco County Sheriff's Office (PCSO), and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE). The bodies of the victims were typically found in a state of decomposition long after the murders, having been dumped near a rural roadside and dragged into the woods. =Modus operandi= In 1984, while on probation for assault, Long began driving around, in a 1978 Dodge Magnum looking for victims in areas known for prostitution and in bars where women were found alone. Long claimed that his victims approached him, and he would persuade them to enter his car and took them to his apartment. Long would then bind the victims with rope and ligature collars he had fashioned, using a variety of rope knots. Long later confessed that he derived sadistic pleasure from the abduction, rape, and brutal murder of his victims, some of whom he strangled to death. Others he killed by slitting their throats or bludgeoning them. Long would then arrange his victims' bodies in unique positions, or \\"display.\\" Of Long's 10 known victims, five of the women were identified as known prostitutes, two as exotic dancers. The remaining three victims were a factory worker, a student, and one had an unknown occupation. Known victims * Artiss Ann Wick, 20 ‚Äì killed on March 27, 1984 * Ngeun Thi Long, 19 ‚Äì killed on May 13, 1984 * Michelle Denise Simms, 22 ‚Äì killed on May 27, 1984 * Linda Nuttall - assaulted in May 1984; survived * Elizabeth Loudenback, 22 ‚Äì killed on June 8, 1984 * Vicky Marie Elliott, 21 ‚Äì killed on September 7, 1984 * Chanel Devoun Williams, 18 ‚Äì killed on October 7, 1984 * Karen Beth Dinsfriend, 28 ‚Äì killed on October 14, 1984 * Kimberly Kyle Hopps, 22 ‚Äì killed on October 31, 1984 * Lisa McVey, 17 ‚Äì assaulted on November 3, 1984; survived * Virginia Lee Johnson, 18 ‚Äì killed on November 6, 1984 * Kim Marie Swann, 21 ‚Äì killed on November 11, 1984 Capture At the time of his capture, Long was wanted in three Tampa Bay area jurisdictions where investigators had collected multiple forms of forensic evidence, including clothing, carpet fibers, semen, ligature marks, and rope knots. Long was arrested outside a movie theater on November 16, 1984, and charged with the sexual battery and kidnapping of Lisa McVey. Long signed a formal Miranda waiver, and consented to questioning. After the detectives procured a confession for the McVey case, their questioning focused on a series of unsolved sexual battery homicides in the Tampa Bay area. As the detectives questioned Long about the murders, he replied, \\"I'd rather not answer that.\\" The detectives continued the interrogation, and handed Long photographs of the various murder victims. At this point, Long stated, \\"The complexion of things sure have [sic] changed since you came back into the room. I think I might need an attorney.\\" No attorney was provided, and Long eventually confessed to eight murders in Hillsborough County, and one murder in Pasco County. Fiber evidence analysis by the FBI linked Long's vehicle to most of his victims. Trial The Hillsborough County State Attorney's Office confronted Long with the evidence. The State Attorney and the Public Defender's Office of Hillsborough County reached a plea bargain for eight of the homicides and the abduction and rape of Lisa McVey. Long pled guilty on September 24, 1985, to all of these crimes, receiving 26 life sentences without the possibility of parole (24 concurrent and two to run consecutively to the first 24) and seven life sentences with the possibility of parole after 25 years. In addition, the State retained the option to seek the death penalty for the murder of Michelle Simms. In July 1986, the penalty phase of the Michelle Simms trial was held in Tampa. It lasted one week and received extensive media attention. Long was found guilty and was sentenced to die in Florida's electric chair. Although Long confessed to raping and killing women, his confession was thrown out. His trial proceeded straight to the penalty phase, which was possible in the 1980s. In early 1985, he received the death penalty. Long was convicted and appealed his first degree murder conviction and death sentence for crimes committed in Hillsborough County. Long appealed his first degree murder conviction and sentence of death in the death of Virginia Johnson. On appeal from the Circuit Court in and for Pasco County, in which Long's death sentence was vacated, his conviction reversed, and his case remanded to the trial court with directions to enter an order of acquittal for the murder of Virginia Johnson. On February 24, 1999, Long accused the Capital Collateral Regional Council (the state office defending death row inmates in their appeals) of revealing his private letters to a book author, thus violating attorney‚Äìclient privilege. He also accused the agency of running a \\"death pool,\\" betting on the dates on which inmates would be executed, and asked that the agency be removed from his case. An investigation concluded that these allegations were unfounded. Long's petition for a writ of mandamus to require Bob Dillinger, the public defender for the Sixth Judicial Circuit, to relinquish possession and control of his file in State v. Long, was denied. According to the Florida Department of Corrections, Long had one five-year sentence, four 99-year sentences, 28 life sentences, and one death sentence. Execution On April 23, 2019, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed Long's death warrant, this being the first death warrant signed by DeSantis since he took office in January 2019. Long's subsequent appeals were denied and he was executed by lethal injection on May 23, 2019, more than 30 years after his conviction. He ate his final meal at 9:30am local time; he requested roast beef, bacon, french fries and soda. He was pronounced dead at 6:55pm and made no last statement.

W. \\"Jay\\" Porter (January 17, 1933 ‚Äì October 11, 2020) was a Major League Baseball player who appeared with the St. Louis Browns (1952), Detroit Tigers (1955‚Äì1957), Cleveland Indians (1958), Washington Senators (1959), and St. Louis Cardinals (1959). Porter played in 229 major league games, 91 as a catcher, 62 as an outfielder, 16 as a first baseman, 3 at third base and was a career .228 hitter who had his best season in 1957 when he hit .250 in 58 games while with the Detroit Tigers. Porter was born in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and was signed as an 18-year-old \\"bonus baby\\" in 1951. Bobby Mattick was scouting Porter, when he noticed another prospect, Frank Robinson. Mattick wound up signing both Porter and Robinson, \\"with Porter signing for a much higher bonus.\\" (John Eisenberg, \\"From 33rd Street to Camden Yards\\" (McGraw-Hill 2001), p. 161.) Despite showing the early promise Porter played in only 33 games for the St. Louis Browns in 1952. On December 4, 1952, Porter was traded by the Browns with Owen Friend and Bob Nieman to the Tigers for Virgil Trucks (who threw two no-hitters in 1952), Hal White, and Johnny Groth. Porter did not make it to the Tigers' big league team until 1955 and played only 92 games for the Tigers from 1955‚Äì1957. Though he never became a starter in Detroit, he was selected by Sports Illustrated in October 2006 as one of the \\"10 Greatest Characters in Detroit Tigers History\\", along with Mark Fidrych, Norm Cash, Boots Poffenberger, and Herbie Redmond. Porter's favorite meal was \\"two dozen (eggs) over light\\", which he would eat all at once. This became a \\"favorite meal\\" when his teammates encouraged him to compete against the world champion for eating the most eggs in one sitting and Porter began his \\"training.\\" A date was set for the contest; however, the current world champion failed to arrive. On February 18, 1958, the Tigers traded Porter to the Cleveland Indians with Hal Woodeshick for Jim Hegan and Hank Aguirre. Porter learned of the trade while driving to Spring Training in Florida, driving from his home in Oregon, down the West Coast, stopping in Tucson, Arizona to visit friends in the Indians training camp. Later on, when he was an hour outside Lakeland, Porter heard on the car radio he had been traded to the Indians, made a U-turn and headed right back to Arizona. (Van Dusen, Ewald & Hawkins, \\"The Detroit Tigers Encyclopedia (Sports Publishing 2003), p. 94). While playing for Cleveland, Porter had the task of catching Baseball Hall of Fame knuckleballer Hoyt Wilhelm at which he was, reportedly, so baffled by Wilhelm's knuckleball he used a first baseman's glove. After his playing career ended, he served as a minor league manager in the Montreal Expos organization, including a stint with the West Palm Beach Expos in 1970 and also managed the Expos entry in the 1969 Florida Instructional League. At the date of his death, Porter was the youngest living former member of the remaining eight St. Louis Browns players who are still alive. His initials of J. W. do not represent any actual given names and he is referred to by all as either JW or Jay. He died on October 11, 2020, in Jupiter, Florida, from respiratory difficulties.

History =19th century= Gendarmes in Chalkis in 1835. The Greek Gendarmerie was established after the enthronement of King Otto in 1833 as the Royal Gendarmerie () and modeled after the French National Gendarmerie. It was at that time formally part of the army and under the authority of the Army Ministry. Several foreign advisers (particularly from Bavaria, who emphasized elements of centralization and authoritarianism), were also brought in to provide training and tactical advice to the newly formed force. The main task of the Gendarmerie under the army as a whole during this period was firstly to combat the extensive banditry which was endemic in the countryside throughout the 19th century and included kidnappings for ransom, the suppression of local revolts, and the establishment of a strong executive government. Dimitrios Deligeorgis was appointed commander in 1854. The army's links to the Gendarmerie and the nature of the structure of the force and its hierarchy (that of being similar to the army) was maintained throughout the 19th century for a number of reasons. Largely the socio-political unrest that characterized the period including disproportionate poverty, governmental oppression, sporadic rebellions and political instability. As a result of this, as well as the input of the armed forces, the Gendarmerie remained a largely conservative body throughout the period, there was also a certain amount of politicization during training as the Gendarmerie were trained in military camps. =20th century= Greek Gendarmerie at the turn of the 20th century Georgios Papandreou and Nikolaos Plastiras with Gendarmerie officers, 1950 In 1906 the Gendarmerie underwent its first major restructuring at an administrative level. It acquired its own educational and training facilities independent of those of the army (though still remaining a nominal part of the armed forces). Despite this the Gendarmerie still maintained a largely military based structure, based on its involvement in the Macedonian Struggle, and the Balkan and First World Wars. As a result, it tended to neglect civilian matters, something addressed with the establishment of a civilian city police force for Attica in 1920, which would eventually be expanded to urban centers in the entire country. Modernization of the country's police forces was stunted by the successive periods of political instability, which culminated in the regime of Ioannis Metaxas and the Second World War. After the war however, British experts were brought in to help reform the police along the lines of the British Police. As a result, after 1946 the police forces ceased to be a formal part of the Defence Ministry, although they retained several military features and were organized along military lines. Reflecting a new emphasis on civilian policing, in 1984 both the Gendarmerie and the city police were merged into a single unified Hellenic Police (IAW Law 1481/1-10-1984, Government Gazette 152 A) which however maintained elements of the former military structure and hierarchy.

Life His father was William Turner (and another William Turner was his son). He was born at Wakefield on 20 September 1761. He was educated at Warrington Academy (1777‚Äì81) and Glasgow University (1781‚Äì2). On 25 September 1782 he was ordained pastor of the Hanover Square congregation, Newcastle-on-Tyne. He ministered at Newcastle for fifty-nine years, retiring on 20 September 1841. He was a main founder (1793) of the Literary and Philosophical Society at Newcastle, and acted as secretary till 1833; he was also a founder of the Natural Historical Society (1824). He was a chief projector of the Newcastle branch of the Bible Society, and one of its secretaries till 1831. Every benevolent and scientific interest in the town owed much to him. From 1808 till his death he was visitor of Manchester College (then at York) and until 1840 he delivered the visitor's annual address. Among the subscribers to a volume of his sermons published in 1838 appeared the names of two bishops, who by their action incurred some censure (see Edward Maltby). He died at Lloyd Street, Greenheys, Manchester, on 24 April 1859, and was buried on 28 April in the graveyard of Upper Brook Street chapel. His portrait, by Morton, and his bust, by Bailey, were placed in the rooms of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle.

This rifle did not actually fire a cartridge, but shot out a forked probe that punctured a paper target barely an inch from the \\"muzzle\\". The system illustrated, to a recruit or trainee, the required sight picture and the correct hold of the rifle as well as the correct operation of the action, the finesse of trigger pull, and the importance of prevention of cant of the rifle. The device, in a transit case and with its associated target frame and targets, was sold mainly to the Royal Air Force to train recruits; whilst the army treated the system with a degree of unjustified, but perhaps typical, disdain. There were two main models of Swift training rifle made available over a period of about three war years. These were the A and B series, which were each loosely based on the Lee‚ÄìEnfield No.3 rifle ( P14 in .303\\" calibre and P17 in 30.06\\" calibre); there was also a later B Series Rifle more closely modelled on the British Lee‚ÄìEnfield No.4 rifle. A similar training rifle was manufactured in Canada at the Long Branch factory. It is arguable whether the latter was a better training rifle, but it was a far cheaper production item at a time when funds were needed to produce the real weapons for which these training rifles were simply economical teaching aids. The Swift Training Rifle came with a stand that folded out in \\"Deck Chair\\" fashion, and onto which was clipped the paper target. The rifle was held at a constant distance from the target by a steel rod bridle hinged from the target frame and hooked into a sling-swivel-like fitting under the rifle's fore-end woodwork. The targets were printed in a series of four different images, each illustrating a particular training scenario.

As a figurative artist and member of the National Academy of Design, Coughlin‚Äôs work is in many prominent collections including the Metropolitan Museum and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the National Collection of Fine Arts in Washington D.C., the Norfolk Museum of Arts and Sciences in Virginia, the Worcester Art Museum in Massachusetts, the University of Colorado, the Philadelphia Free Public Library, Staedelsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfort, Germany, and the New University of Ulster, Coleraine, Northern Ireland. Born in Greenwich, Connecticut Coughlin studied at the Rhode Island School of Design and the Art Students League of New York. Although Coughlin‚Äôs education coincided with the heyday of Abstract Expressionism, he has always been drawn to figurative traditions in European and American art. Art Coughlin's portraits are regularly commissioned for the New Republic magazineTHE NEW REPUBLIC  Masthead and have been published in several volumes of poetry in Ireland and the United States. However, in prints and drawings from the 1960s to the present, he has also pursued a vein of imagery that is much less naturalistic and that explores a range of sources, from the anatomical drawings of George Stubbs to the grotesque hybrids of European printmakers like Francisco Goya and Martin Schongauer. In many metamorphic, dream like images, absurd and mysterious juxtapositions of the human and animal join in an irrational evolutionary journey. Here his automatic drawing practice is akin to that of the Surrealists and is wed to his interests in the existential wordplay of Samuel Beckett. Teaching career Celebrated for his combinations of innovative and traditional techniques during the resurgence of intaglio, lithograph, and woodcut printmaking in the 1960s and 70s, Coughlin taught printmaking at University of Massachusetts Amherst from the foundation of its art department until his retirement over 35 years later. In 2005 Coughlin received the Gladys E. Cook prize at the 2005 annual exhibition at the National Academy of Design.

Coaching career Speckman took up coaching football after his playing career, first at the high school level. His first head coaching gig was at Livingston High School in Livingston, California in 1981, where he introduced the famous Fly offense that is primarily a run-based offense; the fullback and tailback are split behind the quarterback, while the Fly back runs in motion almost every play. His 1982 Wolfpack squad won a share of the Golden Valley League title, missing the Sac- Joaquin Section Division II playoffs by a coin flip. Speckman was picked to coach the 1983 Lions All-Star Football Game, one of many he coached in Central California from the early 1980s to the early 1990s. He left Livingston after two seasons to teach and become the head coach at Gilroy High School in Gilroy, California for the 1983 through 1985 seasons. In 1986, Speckman returned to Central California as Merced High School's head football coach, a position he held for eight seasons. At Merced, he led those teams to six consecutive Central California Conference titles, including quite a few of those where his teams went undefeated in the CCC. In 1990, Speckman's Bears went 14‚Äì0 that earned them the mythical state Division I crown. His 1989 and 1990 squads won back-to-back Sac-Joaquin Section D-I titles, and played in six section championship games from 1988 to 1993. During his tenure, his teams received numerous state and national rankings. Speckman left Merced after the 1993 season to teach and start the new football program at Golden Valley High School, Merced's second high school. His high school coaching record was 113‚Äì48‚Äì3. He also worked as a teacher at that time. During 17 years of coaching high school, he also ran a program targeted at helping disadvantaged kids.Anderson, Christopher P.

The Stanford Daily, April 28, 2005. =Willamette= In 1995, Willamette coach Dan Hawkins hired Speckman to serve as offensive coordinator and offensive line coach for the Bearcats. Willamette is a small liberal arts college in the Willamette Valley that competes at the NCAA Division III level. When Hawkins left the school to coach at Boise State University in Idaho, Willamette hired Speckman to serve as head coach of the team.

It was broadcast to Birmingham on 102.4 MHz, and was launched as the city's fourth radio station after BBC WM, BRMB and Xtra AM. The signal came from a transmitter which was located on the roof of Metropolitan House, a tall office block at Five Ways in the city's Edgbaston district. History The station began broadcasting on 14 May 1990 with a view to providing Birmingham with a locally orientated service that would give priority to the city. In addition, Buzz FM promised to offer listeners a wide range of music that it felt was being ignored by other stations. Daytime programming would be taken up with shows that catered for a multi-ethnic audience, while night time broadcasting would be given over to specialist shows. Listeners to Buzz FM could expect to hear music as diverse as easy soul, contemporary jazz, hip hop, reggae, calypso and classical music. The first show, the Breakfast Show, was hosted by Welsh broadcaster Mark Williams, and there were high hopes for Buzz, but within a year, the station was experiencing difficulties. A massive shortfall in advertising revenue meant that it was losing money, and there were also problems with reception. The frequency that had been specified by the Independent Broadcasting Authority coupled with the relatively low output of its transmitter (when compared to its rivals) made listening a frustrating business. Listeners living on the fringes of its catchment area could expect interference from stations in neighbouring areas, while motorists (part of the station's target-audience) also experienced difficulties in receiving the signal. A number of attempts were made to rectify the station's problems. After investing around one million pounds into the station Radio Clyde obviously could not make a go of things at Buzz either, the station was still losing hundreds of thousands of pounds, and so at the end of 1992 the station was once again sold on, this time to Chris Cary in December for one pound. Chris Cary was known for his previous work in the offshore (\\"pirate\\") radio scene. Under Chris Cary Lindsay Reid was Chief Engineer, Alistar Cochrane was Head Of Sales and Head Of News and Features was Sybil Fennell - well known for her longstanding work with London news station LBC. Birmingham native John Ryan was brought in from local radio in Ireland to present the breakfast show and by the middle of 1993 the financial losses were under control and Buzz FM started to go into profit. At this time Buzz FM sounded like a very slick, commercial and vibrant station in a radio market that was becoming increasingly competitive. But once again problems with reception were causing issues for its long term success. There were several management shake-ups, and Buzz was even sold on to the businessman Muff Murfin in 1993. However, audience figures and revenue failed to improve significantly. Not even the recruitment of some former BRMB presenters (including Brandan Kearney and Graham Torrington) helped to improve the station's fortunes, and the end finally came in 1994. The station's licence was due to expire at the end of 1994, but despite an application for it to be renewed, the Radio Authority declined the request. The licence was actually awarded to Choice FM, and Buzz FM ceased broadcasting at midnight on 31 December 1994. Choice FM began a few moments later. Because of the reception difficulties experienced by listeners to Buzz FM, a new frequency had been specified for its replacement (102.2 MHz) together with a stronger signal output. Choice FM Birmingham was on the air for four years before being taken over by the Chrysalis Group in January 1999, who changed the station's name to Galaxy Birmingham it is now known as 102.2 Capital FM Birmingham.

Description A diplurine spider, family Anamidae, of the mygalomorphs. The colour in mainly black, sometimes bluish on the underside, Legs are long. Lateral margins are rounded at the broad carapace, which is at least 6.5 and greater than 10 millimetres in length. They are most readily diagnosed by the form of its burrow, the non- surfacing annex is close to the entry; tightly woven silk lines this Y‚Äìshape and the annex may formed immediately next to the entry. The habit of the sexually matured males to roam in humid and sudden summer storms on the Swan Coastal Plain is also observed as a characteristic of this species. Ecology They are widespread in their distribution range, although rarely abundant. Males are encountered in urban environs during humid weather in summer, as this induces them to wander, but they are mostly sedentary and remain within their silk-lined accommodation. Observation of the aggressive, large and black individuals is often mistaken as a dangerous and unrelated species of funnel-web spider genus Atrax, Only one arm of the burrow reaches the surface, the other may function as a refuge for the spider if inundated by flooding. Taxonomy The species was first described as Dekana diversicolor by Henry Roughton Hogg in 1902. It was later assigned to the genus Aname, all of which are endemic to Australia, on the basis of morphological characters. The type locality of this description was given as \\"Deka Station\\", which the revising author was unable to locate, the type specimen was also unavailable. The second part of the location was recorded by Hogg as \\"Blackhall\\", and Main indicates this may have been a misspelling of the location Blackall in western Queensland. A new specimen was collected near Elliston, South Australia and this was assigned as the neotype for the species. They display a characteristic of a group the arachnologist Barbara York Main referred to as 'wishbone spiders', for the 'Y' or wishbone-shape of their burrows. This characteristic amongst some genera of Australian mygalomorph genera was regarded as convergent, rather than indicating a monophyletic alliance.

Kennedy presidential campaign began on March 16, 1968, when Robert Francis Kennedy ( RFK, Bobby), a United States Senator from New York who had won a Senate seat in 1964, entered an unlikely primary election as a challenger to incumbent Democratic United States President Lyndon B. Johnson (LBJ). After Johnson announced on March 31 that he would not seek re-election, Kennedy still faced two rival candidates for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination: the leading challenger United States Senator Eugene McCarthy and Vice President Hubert Humphrey. Humphrey had entered the race after Johnson's withdrawal, but Kennedy and McCarthy remained the main challengers to the policies of the Johnson administration. During the spring of 1968, Kennedy campaigned in presidential primary elections throughout the United States. Kennedy's campaign was especially active in Indiana, Nebraska, Oregon, South Dakota, California, and Washington, D.C.. He had been making progress in building Democratic support for his nomination when he was assassinated at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California, on June 5, 1968. Had Kennedy been elected, he would have been the first brother of a U.S. President (John F. Kennedy) to win the presidency himself. Announcement Kennedy speaking to a civil rights demonstration in Washington, D.C., June 14, 1963 Kennedy was a late entry in making a campaign announcement for the primary race in the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 1968. His political advisors had been pressuring him to make a decision, fearing Kennedy was running out of time to announce his candidacy. Although Kennedy and his advisors knew it would not be easy to beat the incumbent president, Lyndon B. Johnson, Kennedy had not ruled out entering the race. U.S. Senator Eugene McCarthy had announced his intention to run against Johnson for the Democratic nomination on November 30, 1967. Following McCarthy's announcement, Kennedy remarked to U.S. Senator George McGovern of South Dakota that he was, \\"worried about [McGovern] and other people making early commitments to [McCarthy].\\" Excerpt from The Last Campaign: Robert F. Kennedy and the 82 Days that Inspired America (New York, Henry Holt, 2008) by Thurston Clark. At a breakfast with reporters at the National Press Club on January 30, 1968, Kennedy once again indicated that he had no plans to run, but a few weeks later he had changed his mind about entering the race.Thomas, p. 356. In early February 1968, after the Tet Offensive in Vietnam, Kennedy received an anguished letter from writer Pete Hamill, noting that poor people in the Watts area of Los Angeles had hung pictures of Kennedy's brother, President John F. Kennedy, in their homes. Hamill's letter reminded Robert Kennedy that he had an \\"obligation of staying true to whatever it was that put those pictures on those walls.\\"Thomas, p. 357. There were other factors that influenced Kennedy's decision to enter the presidential primary race. On February 29, 1968, the Kerner Commission issued a report on the racial unrest that had affected American cities during the previous summer. The Kerner Commission blamed \\"white racism\\" for the violence, but its findings were largely dismissed by the Johnson administration. Concerned about President Johnson's policies and actions, Kennedy asked his advisor, historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr: \\"How can we possibly survive five more years of Lyndon Johnson?\\" Disagreement amongst Kennedy's friends, political advisors, and family members further complicated his decision to launch a primary challenge against the incumbent Johnson. Kennedy's wife Ethel supported the idea, but his brother Ted had been opposed to the candidacy. Ted did lend his support once Kennedy entered the race.Thomas, pp. 357‚Äì358. By late February or early March 1968, Kennedy had finally made the decision to enter the race for president. On March 10, Kennedy traveled to California, to meet with civil rights activist C√©sar Ch√°vez, at the end of a 25-day hunger strike. En route to California, Kennedy told his aide, Peter Edelman, that he had decided to run and had to \\"figure out how to get McCarthy out of it.\\" The weekend before the New Hampshire primary, Kennedy told several aides that he would run if he could persuade little-known Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota to withdraw from the presidential race. Kennedy agreed to McCarthy's request to delay an announcement of his intentions until after the New Hampshire primary. On March 12, when Johnson won an astonishingly narrow victory in the New Hampshire primary against McCarthy, who polled 42 percent of the vote, Kennedy knew it would be unlikely that the Minnesota senator would agree to withdraw. He moved forward with his plans to announce his candidacy.Thomas, p. 359. On March 16, Kennedy declared, \\"I am today announcing my candidacy for the presidency of the United States. I do not run for the presidency merely to oppose any man, but to propose new policies. I run because I am convinced that this country is on a perilous course and because I have such strong feelings about what must be done, and I feel that I'm obliged to do all I can.\\"Kennedy, Robert F., \\"Robert F. Kennedy's Announcement of his candidacy for president\\" (speech, Washington, DC, 1968-03-16). Retrieved 2012-05-17. Kennedy made this announcement from the same spot in the Senate Caucus Room where John F. Kennedy had announced his presidential candidacy in January 1960.Thomas, p. 360.On September 14, 2009, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution to rename the Senate Caucus Room in the Russell Senate Office Building (RSOB) to the Kennedy Senate Caucus Room in honor of the three Kennedy brothers who served in the Senate chamber. John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy announced their presidential campaigns in the room and their younger brother, the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who died of cancer in August 2009, chaired hearings in the room on a health-care bill that bore his name. McCarthy supporters angrily denounced Kennedy as an opportunist.Schlesinger, p. 898. With Kennedy joining the race, liberal Democrats thought that votes among supporters of the anti-war movement would now be split between McCarthy and Kennedy. On March 31, President Johnson stunned the nation by dropping out of the presidential race. He withdrew from the election during a televised speech, where he also announced a partial halt to the bombing of Vietnam and proposed peace negotiations with the North Vietnamese.Thomas, p. 365. Vice President Hubert Humphrey, long a champion of labor unions and civil rights, entered the race on April 27, with support from the party \\"establishment\\"‚Äîincluding the Democratic members of Congress, mayors, governors, and labor unions.Schlesinger, p. 923. Although he was a write-in candidate in some of the contests, Humphrey had announced his candidacy too late to be a formal candidate in most of the primaries. Despite late entry into the primary race, Humphrey had the support of the president and many Democratic insiders, which gave him a better chance at gaining convention delegates in the non-primary states.Solberg, pp. 327‚Äì328. In contrast, Kennedy, like his brother before him, had planned to win the nomination through popular support in the primaries. Because Democratic party leaders would influence delegate selection and convention votes, Kennedy's strategy was to influence the decision-makers with crucial wins in the primary elections. This strategy had worked for John F. Kennedy in 1960, when he beat Hubert Humphrey in the West Virginia democratic primary. Kennedy delivered his first campaign speech on March 18 at Kansas State University, where he had previously agreed to give a lecture honoring former Kansas governor and Republican Alfred Landon. At Kansas State, Kennedy drew a \\"record-setting crowd of 14,500 students\\" for his Landon Lecture. In his speech, Kennedy apologized for early mistakes and attacked President Johnson's Vietnam policy saying, \\"I was involved in many of the early decisions on Vietnam, decisions which helped set us on our present path.\\" He further acknowledged that \\"past error is not excuse for its own perpetration.\\" Later that day at the University of Kansas Kennedy spoke to an audience of 19,000‚Äîone of the largest in the university's history. During that speech he said, \\"I don't think that we have to shoot each other, to beat each other, to curse each other and criticize each other, I think that we can do better in this country. And that is why I run for President of the United States.\\"Kennedy, Robert F., \\"Remarks at the University of Kansas\\" (speech, Lawrence, KS, 1968-03-18), John F. Kennedy Library. Retrieved May 18, 2012. From Kansas, Kennedy went on to campaign in the Democratic primaries in Indiana, Washington, DC, Nebraska, Oregon, South Dakota, and California. Policy positions Kennedy's political platform emphasized racial equality, economic justice, non-aggression in foreign policy, decentralization of power and social improvement. A crucial element of his campaign was youth engagement. Kennedy identified America's youth with the future of a reinvigorated American society based on partnership and social equality. Kennedy's policy objectives were not popular with the business world, where he was viewed as a fiscal liability. Businesses were opposed to the tax increases that would be necessary to fund Kennedy's proposed social programs. During a speech given at the Indiana University Medical School, Kennedy was asked, \\"Where are we going to get the money to pay for all these new programs you're proposing?\\" Kennedy replied to the medical students, who were poised to enter lucrative careers, \\"From you.\\"Newfield, Jack. (1988 [1969]). Robert Kennedy: A Memoir. Plume =Vietnam War= Kennedy did not support an immediate withdrawal of U.S. military personnel from Vietnam or an immediate end to the war. He sought to end the conflict by strengthening the South Vietnamese military and reducing corruption within the South Vietnamese government. He supported a peace settlement between North and South Vietnam. =Job opportunities and welfare reform= Kennedy argued that increased government cooperation with private enterprise would reduce housing and employment woes in the United States. He also argued that the focus of welfare spending should be shifted more towards improving credit and income for farmers. =Law and order= In 1968, Kennedy expressed his strong willingness to support a bill that was under consideration for the abolition of the death penalty. He argued that rising crime rates could be countered with more job and educational opportunities.Robert F. Kennedy 1968 for President Campaign Brochure Accessed May 20, 2018. = Gun control = Kennedy supported laws that would reduce casual firearm purchases. He said he believed in keeping firearms away from \\"people who have no business\\" with them‚Äîspecifying criminals, individuals with mental health issues, and minors as classes of persons who should be prevented from purchasing firearms. =Tax reform= Kennedy argued for legislation, which would reform flagrant tax loopholes. Primary campaign In 1968, Kennedy was successful in four state primaries: Indiana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and California; as well as Washington D.C. McCarthy won six state primaries: Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Kennedy's native state of Massachusetts, Oregon, New Jersey, and Illinois. Of the state primaries in which they campaigned directly against one another, Kennedy won three (Indiana, Nebraska, and California) while McCarthy was only successful in one (Oregon).Cook, pp. 12‚Äì13. =Opinion polling= A Gallup poll conducted in the fall of 1965 showed 72% of respondents believed RFK wanted to become the president, and 40% of independents and 56% of Democrats stated their support for a possible bid.Shesol, p. 305. Harris and Gallup polls released in August 1966 showed RFK being favored over President Johnson for the nomination by 2% among Democrats and 14% by independents.Shesol, p. 344. A late March Gallup poll released shortly before RFK's entry into the primary showed him leading President Johnson by three points at 44% to 41%. A poll released in the early part of April featured Kennedy with a 26-point lead over McCarthy in the Indiana primary, at 46% to 19%.Richardson, pp. 87‚Äì89. Another April poll in Indiana, the Oliver Quayle survey, showed Kennedy with a three-to-one lead over McCarthy and the state's governor Roger D. Branigin; Schmitt noted the poll featured a large portion of respondents refuting the label that RFK was not trustworthy along with being \\"too tough and ruthless.\\"Schmitt, pp. 210‚Äì211. An April 28 Gallup poll showed Kennedy at 28% support by Democratic voters, Humphrey behind by three points and McCarthy ahead by five. A May 26 Associated Press poll showed RFK behind Humphrey among Pennsylvania national convention delegates, 1 to 27. A June 2 Gallup poll showed Kennedy at 19% support among Democratic county chairmen, Humphrey at 67% and McCarthy at 6%. A June 3 poll showed Kennedy leading McCarthy by nine points in the California primary, at 39% to 30%.Clarke, p. 262. The following day, CBS polls showed Kennedy leading McCarthy by seven points. =Indiana primary= On March 27, 1968, Kennedy announced his intention to run against McCarthy in the Indiana primary. His aides told him that a race in Indiana would be an extremely tight race and advised him against it. Despite the concerns of his advisors, Kennedy traveled to Indianapolis the following day and filed to run in the Indiana primary. At the Indiana Statehouse, Kennedy told a cheering crowd that the state was important to his campaign: \\"If we can win in Indiana, we can win in every other state, and win when we go to the convention in August.\\"Boomhower, p. 43. On April 4, 1968, Kennedy made his first campaign stop in Indiana at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, followed by a speech at Ball State University in Muncie. In his speech at Ball State, Kennedy suggested that the 1968 election would \\"determine the direction that the United States is going to move\\" and that the American people should \\"examine everything. Not take anything for granted.\\"Kennedy, Robert F., \\"Speech at Ball State University\\" (speech, Ball State University, Muncie, IN, 1968-04-04). Retrieved 2012-05-24. In addition, Kennedy enumerated his concerns about poverty and hunger, lawlessness and violence, jobs and economic development, and foreign policy. He emphasized that Americans had a \\"moral obligation\\" and should \\"make an honest effort to understand one another and move forward together.\\" After leaving the stage at Ball State, Kennedy boarded a plane for Indianapolis. When he arrived in Indianapolis he was informed of King's assassination.Boomhower, pp. 62‚Äì63. Later that evening, Kennedy made a brief speech on the assassination of King to a crowd gathered for a political rally at 17th and Broadway‚Äîan African American neighborhood near the north side of Indianapolis. He attempted to console the crowd with calls for peace and compassion.Boomhower, pp. 67‚Äì68. After attending King's funeral in Atlanta, Georgia, Kennedy turned his attention back to the primary campaign. He drew huge crowds at campaign stops across the country.Thomas, p. 369. Kennedy's Indiana campaign resumed on April 10.Boomhower, p. 76. Kennedy's campaign advisor John Bartlow Martin urged the candidate to speak out against violence and rioting, emphasize his \\"law enforcement experience\\" as former U.S. Attorney General, and promote the idea that the federal government and the private sector should work together to solve domestic issues. Martin also urged Kennedy to speak out on the war in Vietnam‚Äîsupport for the cessation of hostilities and reallocating war funds to domestic programs were ideas which \\"always got applause.\\"Boomhower, p. 78. To appeal to Indiana's more- conservative voters, Kennedy \\"toned down his rhetoric\\" as well. RFK delivered a speech before the Indianapolis real estate board on May 2, advocating for reliance on private enterprise instead of the federal government. During this speech, Kennedy argued that the national economy would be \\"restored\\" by the Vietnam War's conclusion. In the days before the Indiana primary, a battle ensued between Kennedy, McCarthy, and Indiana Governor Roger D. Branigin. Branigin was a \\"favorite son candidate\\" and stand-in for LBJ. He has been described as a \\"formidable foe who had enormous power over the distribution of the approximately seven thousand patronage jobs in the state.\\"Boomhower, pp. 35‚Äì36. Branigan campaigned in nearly all of the state's 92 counties, while McCarthy's campaign strategy concentrated on Indiana's rural areas and small towns. According to Kennedy's advisor, Martin, the campaign gained momentum with Kennedy's visits to central and southern Indiana on April 22 and 23, which included a memorable whistle-stop railroad trip aboard the Wabash Cannonball.Boomhower, pp. 83, 88, 91. The Indiana primary was held on May 7: Kennedy won with 42 percent of the vote; Branigan was second with 31 percent of the vote; and McCarthy, earning 27 percent, came in third.Thomas, p. 375. With this victory in Indiana, Kennedy's campaign gained momentum going into the Nebraska primary. =Nebraska and Oregon primaries= Campaigning vigorously in Nebraska, Kennedy hoped for a big win to give him momentum going into the California primary, in which McCarthy held a strong presence. While McCarthy made only one visit to Nebraska, Kennedy made numerous appearances. It was during this primary that Kennedy began enjoying himself as he was \\"open and uncomplicated\\".Tye, p. 425. Kennedy's advisors had been worried about his chances in Nebraska, given RFK's lack of experience with the issues of ranching and agriculture‚Äîsubjects of high importance to Nebraskans‚Äîand the short amount of time to campaign in the state after the Indiana primary.Clarke, pp. 194‚Äì195. RFK won the Nebraska primary on May 14, with 51.4 percent of the vote to McCarthy's 31 percent.Thomas, p. 377. Kennedy won 24 of the 25 counties that he visited ahead of the vote; of those, Mills noted that the sole county he lost harbored the University of Nebraska, where a plurality of students favored McCarthy, and that RFK had been defeated by \\"precisely two votes.\\"Mills, p. 428. After the results, Kennedy declared that he and McCarthy, both anti-war candidates, had collectively managed to earn over 80 percent of the vote. He described this as \\"a smashing repudiation\\" of the Johnson-Humphrey administration.Schlesinger, p. 929. Kennedy on a campaign plane (photo by Evan Freed) In contrast to Nebraska, the Oregon primary posed several challenges to Kennedy's campaign. His campaign organization, run by Congresswoman Edith Green, was not strong and his platform emphasizing poverty, hunger, and minority issues did not resonate with Oregon voters.Dooley, p. 129. Mills wrote the following about RFK's calls for unity amongst Americans: \\"As far as Oregonians were concerned, America had not fallen apart.\\" The Kennedy campaign circulated material on McCarthy's record; McCarthy had voted against a minimum wage law and repeal of the poll tax in the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The McCarthy campaign responded with charges that Kennedy illegally taped Martin Luther King, Jr. as United States Attorney General. Kennedy admitted these mentions of McCarthy's record did not bother his supporters. Ten days ahead of the primary, RFK recognized the uphill battle he faced in winning the primary: \\"This state is like one giant suburb. I appeal best to people who have problems.\\" During a speech he gave in California, Kennedy said, \\"I think that if I get beaten in any primary, I am not a very viable candidate.\\" The comment further intensified the importance of the Oregon primary.Gould, p. 73. Kennedy realized that losing the Oregon primary would pose a risk to his credibility and began what Dary G. Richardson dubbed an \\"Olympian-like pace\\". He campaigned for sixteen hours a day; in the weeks before the election, his campaign canvased 50,000 homes. On May 26, RFK was campaigning in Portland, accompanied by his wife Ethel and astronaut John Glenn. McCarthy was also campaigning in Portland and briefly encountered RFK's motorcade in Washington Park; Kennedy's campaign aides decided to hold his event in a different location. The following day, a spokesman for the RFK campaign accused the McCarthy and Humphrey campaigns of banding together against Kennedy. On May 28, McCarthy won the Oregon primary with 44.7 percent; Kennedy received 38.8 percent of votes.Thomas, p. 382. After Kennedy's loss was confirmed, RFK sent a congratulatory message to McCarthy in which he asserted that he would remain in the race. Larry Tye believes the defeat in Oregon had two effects: First, it proved to RFK that he needed to take risks in his campaigning. Second, the defeat convinced voters that Kennedy was vulnerable to electoral defeat. After the loss in Oregon, Kennedy's campaign moved on to California. =California, South Dakota, and New Jersey primaries= Robert Kennedy campaigns in Los Angeles (photo by Evan Freed). After victories in Nebraska and Indiana, Kennedy hoped to take the California and South Dakota primaries on June 4. California was \\"the perfect place for Kennedy to demonstrate his voter-appeal.\\"Dooley, p. 130. McCarthy's California campaign was well-funded and organized. For Kennedy, a defeat could have ended his hopes of securing the nomination. Kennedy was the weakest candidate in the South Dakota primary; McCarthy was a Senator in neighboring Minnesota and Humphrey had been raised in South Dakota.Clarke, p. 159. On June 1, during the final days of the California campaign, Kennedy and McCarthy met for a televised debate. Kennedy had hopes of denting McCarthy's strength in California, but the debate proved to be \\"indecisive and disappointing.\\"Dooley, p. 131. After the debate, undecided voters favored Kennedy to McCarthy 2 to 1, the first time in the primary that gains in undecided voters were found to mostly go to RFK.Mills, p. 443. On June 3, in what Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. dubbed a \\"final dash around the state\\", RFK traveled to San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Long Beach. RFK told Theodore H. White on June 4 that he could sway Democratic Party leaders with wins in both California and South Dakota.Clarke, p. 265. Kennedy won the South Dakota primary by a wide margin, beating McCarthy, 50 percent to 20 percent of the vote.Johnson's name still appeared on the ballot in South Dakota and received 30 percent of the vote, which was recognized as support for Humphrey. McCarthy beat out Kennedy in the NJ primary, which only permitted write-ins and separately elected a slate of uncommitted delegates composed of state elected officials, winning 38 percent to 33 percent over RFK with Humphrey getting 21 percent and Wallace 5% with LBJ picking up a paltry 380 write-ins for 1.5 percent. Dooley, p. 134. Kennedy won in California with 46 percent of the vote to McCarthy's 42 percent‚Äîthis was a crucial defeat to McCarthy's campaign and the biggest prize in the nominating process. Under the plurality voting system, Kennedy, despite having received only a plurality of the vote, was awarded all of the state's delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Around midnight on June 4, Kennedy addressed supporters at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, confidently promising to heal the many divisions within the country. =Assassination= After addressing his supporters during the early morning hours of June 5, in a ballroom at The Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, Kennedy left the ballroom through a service area to greet kitchen workers. In a crowded kitchen passageway, Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian-born Jordanian, opened fire with a .22 caliber revolver and mortally wounded Kennedy. Following the shooting, Kennedy was rushed to Central Receiving Hospital and then transferred to The Good Samaritan Hospital, where he died early in the morning on June 6.Dooley, p. 140. Robert Kennedy's grave in Arlington National Cemetery Kennedy's body was returned to New York City, where he lay in repose at St. Patrick's Cathedral for several days before the Requiem Mass was held there on June 8. His younger brother, U.S. Senator Edward \\"Ted\\" Kennedy, eulogized him with the words: \\"My brother need not be idealized or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life; to be remembered simply as a good and decent man, who saw wrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to heal it, saw war and tried to stop it.\\" Kennedy concluded the eulogy by paraphrasing George Bernard Shaw, \\"As he said many times, in many parts of this nation, to those he touched and who sought to touch him: 'Some men see things as they are and say why? I dream things that never were and say why not?' \\" Later that day, a funeral train carried Kennedy's body from New York to Washington, D.C., where he was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery.Thomas, p. 393.  Relationships with groups and people  = Black communities = Kennedy had been a supporter of the Civil Rights Movement. During the campaign, there were signs in black neighborhoods that read \\"Kennedy white but alright / The one before, he opened the door.\\" In the Indiana primary, RFK secured 86% of the black vote. His performance was strongest in cities with the largest black populations. Richardson noted that Kennedy was appealing to low-earning black voters. Kennedy had received support from blacks by \\"an overwhelming margin\\". Support amongst black voters was one of the key factors in Kennedy's victory in Indiana, where he gave a notable speech on the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in Indianapolis days before the primary took place. Samuel Lubell argued that the victory was partially inspired by RFK's support for corporate attempts to hire blacks; he wrote that Kennedy had largely won \\"the Negro wards\\". However, Indianapolis Star journalist Will Higgins noted that Kennedy got a boost from the King assassination speech, which, unlike many other American cities, aided Indianapolis in being spared of riots. Higgins also noted that the crowd which Kennedy spoke with that evening was estimated to be only 2,500 people. In the Nebraska primary, Kennedy ended his campaigning in the state with a speech in a black neighborhood in Omaha, Nebraska. While a late May poll showed that only 40% of overall respondents believed RFK embodied \\"many of the same outstanding qualities\\" of the late President Kennedy, 94% of black respondents agreed with the comparison.Cohen, p. 129. When McCarthy revealed that Kennedy had agreed to limited surveillance of Dr. King back in 1963, blacks in California considered switching their support to McCarthy. In Oakland, California, Kennedy met with Black Panthers amid other minority activists in a midnight session days before the California primary concluded. When he was shouted at, Kennedy prevented a black aide from intervening: \\"They need to tell people off. They need to tell me off.\\"Tye, p. 430. RFK won 90% of the black vote in the California primary. Larry Tye later said: \\"By the time of his death in June 1968, Bobby was the most trusted white man in black America.\\" On the other hand, Michael A. Cohen noted that RFK's popularity with blacks had a negative effect on his appeal to the remainder of the electorate: \\"Rather than create an espirit de corps between the races, his close relationship to the black community turned many whites off.\\"Cohen, p. 82. = Working class whites = Kennedy had broad support among blue-collar white voters during the campaign. Schmitt observed that \\"It was the allure of Kennedy as a bare knuckles advocate for their interests that led some of these same white voters to support the insurgent candidacy of George Wallace in the fall of 1968.\\" An internal memo released during the Indiana primary showed that Kennedy-backing voters had favorable opinions of Wallace. Samuel Lubell, though noting Kennedy's support among blacks, stated that he \\"had also carried the racially sensitive low-income white workers who come in from rural areas to settle in east Omaha.\\" = Farmworkers = Kennedy endeared himself to farmworkers through his support of the Delano grape strike and subsequent communications with Cesar Chavez, who told students in California that Kennedy was the candidate for farmworkers. Tye wrote that RFK became a hero to farmworkers by questioning local law enforcement methods.Tye, p. 359. RFK visited Delano during the campaign to display an endorsement for the grape strike, prompting Chavez to convince the United Farm Workers to begin voter turnout and registration campaigns. Marshall Ganz had arranged for Kennedy to speak to farmworkers after his victory speech in the California primary. Roger A. Bruns wrote the following about Kennedy's assassination: \\"For the country and especially for the farm workers community, the killing of Robert Kennedy was a profoundly tragic loss.\\" = Hispanics = Chavez claimed there were fifty Hispanics supporting the Kennedy campaign for every one that had backed his brother's campaign eight years prior. In the California primary, 95% of voting Hispanics supported RFK and he won 100% in several precincts. By the time of the primary, he had become \\"the leading candidate among Latinos in California\\". Hispanic input heavily impacted Kennedy's victory. = Lyndon B. Johnson = Even before Kennedy announced his candidacy, Lyndon B. Johnson (LBJ) was convinced that Kennedy wanted to challenge him. LBJ was convinced that his presidency would be \\"trapped forever between the two Kennedys\\" administrations. Jeff Shesol wrote that LBJ took the prospect of a contentious primary seriously, after having underestimated the political skillfulness of JFK in 1960.Shesol, p. 309. During a December 19, 1967 press conference, LBJ said the following about what he called the Kennedy-McCarthy movement: \\"I don't know what the effect of the Kennedy-McCarthy movement is having in the country ...I am not privileged to all of the conversations that have taken place ...I do know of the interest of both of them in the Presidency and the ambition of both of them.\\" Prior to RFK's announcement of his intentions to run, close friend Arthur Schlesinger wrote in a journal that he'd never seen Kennedy \\"so torn about anything...I think that he cannot bear the thought of consigning the country to four more years of LBJ, without having done something to avert this.\\"Smith, p. 235. Kennedy announced his candidacy after LBJ almost lost the New Hampshire primary. The day after announcing his candidacy, RFK predicted that Johnson would lose the general election if he was the party's nominee, if he continued to \\"follow the same policies we are following at the moment\\". Kennedy told reporters during a flight to Kansas City: \\"I didn't want to run for President. But when [Johnson] made it clear the war would go on, and that nothing was going to change, I had no choice.\\" Clarke wrote that Kennedy was conveying he had a moral obligation to do everything in his power to prevent a prolonging of the policies he opposed.Clarke, p. 29. In mid-March, during an appearance at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, RFK charged LBJ's leadership with leading to the divisiveness of the U.S.: \\"They are the ones, the President of the United States, President Johnson, they are the ones who divide us.\\" In late March, three days before LBJ announced that he would not be seeking the Democratic Party's nomination, James H. Rowe sent LBJ a memorandum charging that RFK's backers had said \\"the president would not run and that the best course for the Democrats was to 'Stay loose and stay committed.' \\" A late- March Gallup poll showed RFK defeating President Johnson in a national election.Bzdek, p. 136. RFK was at his apartment in the United Nations Plaza the night President Johnson announced his withdrawal from the primary, though unlike his supporters he was not optimistic about the news. He reportedly said, \\"The joy is premature.\\"Shesol, p. 439. Smith observed that Johnson's withdrawal meant Kennedy would have to shift the focus of his critiques from the administration's policies on the Vietnam War.Smith, p. 244. Shesol wrote that Kennedy moved to a praising tone of Johnson, crediting Johnson with fulfillment of \\"the policies of thirty years\\" during an April 1 appearance in New Jersey. While in Philadelphia, he called Johnson's withdrawal an \\"act of leadership and sacrifice\\".Shesol, pp. 446‚Äì447. On April 3, 1968, three days after President Johnson announced that he would not seek the nomination, RFK and the President met at the White House. When asked about his intentions for the primary, LBJ replied: \\"Stay out of it\\". Although Johnson's withdrawal from the race meant Vice-President Humphrey would enter, RFK had gained the president's declaration of neutrality. In comments to Henry Ford II and Gregory Peck, LBJ concluded that RFK won his June debate with McCarthy. = Eugene McCarthy = After the primaries, McCarthy claimed that RFK had promised in November 1967 that he would not run. Prior to entering the race, RFK worried McCarthy lacked a platform, as the latter had rarely spoken about domestic issues. In mid-March, Ted Kennedy attempted to broker \\"a political deal\\" where his brother would remain out of the race, if McCarthy spoke out on domestic problems. McCarthy declined and the refusal propelled Schlesinger's unsuccessful suggestion that RFK endorse McCarthy.Smith, p. 237. The day before RFK announced his entry into the primary, he told reporters Hayne Johnson and Jack Newfield: \\"I can't be a hypocrite anymore. I just don't believe Gene McCarthy would be a good president. If it had been George McGovern who had run in New Hampshire, I wouldn't have gotten into it. But what has McCarthy ever done for the ghettos or for the poor?\\" The day Kennedy announced his entry into the primary, McCarthy reversed his decision to not enter the Indiana primary; he didn't want to help RFK's chances of winning any primaries. According to Dominic Sandbrook, Kennedy's entry into the primary caused a shift in McCarthy's campaign‚ÄîMcCarthy was forced to further develop his own platform, instead of merely being antagonistic to the Johnson administration's policies.Sandbrook, pp. 187‚Äì188. Walter LaFeber believed that animosity between the Kennedy and McCarthy campaigns had grown by the end of March. Following President Johnson's withdrawal from the primary, McCarthy said: \\"Up to now Bobby was Jack running against Lyndon. Now Bobby has to run against Jack.\\"Cohen, p. 115. Mills wrote that Kennedy's focus on providing assistance for the poor and powerless during the Indiana primary was meant to highlight an issue that the McCarthy campaign had neglected.Mills, p. 401. After his Nebraska victory, Kennedy said that McCarthy supporters should support him to prevent the nomination of Humphrey at the Democratic National Convention. McCarthy rebuked RFK's proposals about fixing cities during a late May speech at University of California, Davis.Cohen, p. 123. The McCarthy campaign believed that if RFK did well enough to survive the California primary, it would lead to a fractured Democratic National Convention where McCarthy would be the alternative for those opposed to both RFK and Humphrey.Cohen, p. 136. After the California primary, some Kennedy advisors joined the McCarthy campaign with plans for supporting it toward gaining the nomination.Mills, p. 446. = Hubert Humphrey = Two days after RFK announced his candidacy, Vice President Humphrey said that RFK had supported the JFK administration's policies on the Vietnam conflict. Humphrey's office produced a statement from Kennedy, written six years prior, saying the U.S. would win in Vietnam. Kennedy was in Nebraska when Humphrey entered the race on April 27. Kennedy welcomed Humphrey into the race, saying Humphrey's candidacy offered \\"clear alternatives\\" between the Johnson administration's policies and those of the primary candidates. LaFeber wrote that Humphrey's entry seemed to be hinged entirely on President Johnson's distaste at the idea of Kennedy being the party's nominee in the general election.LaFeber, p. 122. RFK took direct aim at Humphrey's \\"politics of joy\\" line during his announcement speech while campaigning in Indiana: \\"It is easy to say this is the politics of happiness‚Äîbut if you see children starving in the Delta of Mississippi and despair on the Indian reservations, then you know that everybody in America is not satisfied.\\"Solberg, p. 333. Humphrey won 18% of write-in votes in the Massachusetts primary; it was seen as a victory over Kennedy's 28% vote total because Kennedy's Massachusetts campaign organization was significantly stronger than Humphrey's.Richardson, p. 81. The morning after his Oregon loss, Kennedy hosted a Los Angeles airport press conference in which he critiqued Humphrey for what he called an inability \\"to present his views to the voters of a single state.\\"Schlesinger, p. 907. Kennedy also emphasized that there would be no anti-war Presidential candidate, if Humphrey were the Democratic candidate in the general election against former Vice President Nixon.Mills, p. 438. After winning the California primary, RFK said that he intended to follow Humphrey \\"all over the country\\" in pursuit of the nomination. Reflecting on RFK's assassination, Humphrey said: \\"I was doing everything I could to get the nomination, but God knows I didn't want it that way.\\" Humphrey went on to become the Democratic Party's nominee in the general election. = Richard J. Daley = Shortly before entering the race, on February 8, 1968, RFK met with Richard J. Daley about the chances of usurping the nomination from the incumbent President Johnson. RFK wanted Daley to use his influence to sway delegates and the Democratic National Convention in his favor toward nomination. Daley stated that he would remain committed to Johnson. Savage wrote that Daley was worried about an RFK Presidency because he had, as Attorney General, prosecuted Democratic machine politicians in several states.Savage, pp. 308‚Äì309. = Richard Nixon = After President Johnson withdrew from the primary, Nixon commented that RFK seemed favored for the nomination.Gould, p. 48. When Richard Nixon heard that RFK had announced his candidacy, Nixon reportedly said, \\"We've just seen some very terrible forces unleashed. Something bad is going to come out of this.\\"Clarke, pp. 22‚Äì24. However, Nixon was relieved by RFK's entry into the Democratic primary‚Äîhe believed the divisions created by RFK's candidacy would be an advantage for Republicans. In April, Nixon proposed a debate between Kennedy and himself. Nixon, who during his own campaign for the presidency spoke about federal power to the states and economic empowerment for blacks in a late May speech, said: \\"Bobby and I have been sounding pretty much alike.\\" Kennedy tied with Nixon in polls conducted in the latter part of 1967. When Kennedy was announced the winner of the California primary, Nixon told his family: \\"It sure looks like we'll be going against Bobby.\\" = Kennedy family = Kennedy's wife, Ethel, regularly joined Kennedy when he was campaigning. His brother Ted and brother-in-law Steve Smith, were involved in the campaign as informal advisors.Bzdek, p. 133. Ted and his sisters Jean Kennedy Smith and Patricia Kennedy Lawford were in the entourage of the Kennedy campaign at the Ambassador Hotel after RFK won the California primary. RFK met with his father Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. ahead of making the announcement; the elder Kennedy dropped his head \\"to his chest in regret.\\" Bzdek wrote, \\"He no longer wished to see three sons as president; he only wished to see the last two alive.\\" Notes Bibliography  Category:Robert F.

Wrapped in Steel, a 90-minute PBS documentary, was part of the Southeast Chicago Historical Project funded by The National Endowment for The Humanities (NEH), Illinois Humanities Council (IHC) and Columbia College Chicago. The documentary focused on multi-ethnic SE Chicago Steel Mill neighborhoods at a critical time for urban America when cities were moving from dependence on a heavy industry economy.New York Times, July 22, 1984 Four years in the making, Wrapped In Steel was a part of the Southeast Chicago Historical Project which facilitated a community history project in which residents used various media to examine their past and present conditions. Project and documentary activities touched the 100,000-resident neighborhoods of South Chicago, South Deering, East Side and Hegewisch, where a large percentage of the community worked at the steel mills located in their area. In addition to the documentary film the community history project left tangible reminders of the history and culture of area residents in the neighborhood after the project ended. Some of the results of the project are two years of articles about the history of the area in The Daily Calumet (1982‚Äì1983), a multi-media exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago) and a revitalized local Southeast Chicago Historical Society. Prominent scholars and residents examined the culture and history of these working-class neighborhoods. Among those consultants were William Kornblum, Blue Collar Community, Sol Tax, anthropologist, Dominic Pacyga, historian, Tom Cottle, psychologist, Mike Alexandrof, President of Columbia College, Edward Sadlowski, United Steel Workers of America, and thousands of residents. Emmy Award-winning Fired-Up: Public Housing is my Home, a 60-minute PBS documentary, looks at an attempt to introduce the Tenant Management concept to Chicago Public Housing (CHA) developments including Cabrini‚ÄìGreen and other developments.

McSweeney was subsequently selected to represent the English University Football Team at the British University Games in 2007, helping the team win the gold medal. In tandem with this, McSweeney tasted success at a number of non-league clubs starting at Hucknall Town, where he spent half a season, under then manager Steve Burr, helping them win what was then the Northern Premier League title and achieve promotion to the Football Conference. The club declined their place in the higher league, however, and in the summer of 2004 McSweeney moved to Hednesford Town. He had a successful season with The Pitmen, scoring 15 goals and helping them gain promotion to the Conference North. He could not agree a new contract with the club, however, and so moved back to Hucknall Town in the summer of 2005, only to return to Hednesford Town again in December only to fail to save the club from relegation. The following summer McSweeney moved to Ilkeston Town under the guidance of former Nottingham Forest and Sheffield Wednesday striker Nigel Jemson. He spent one season there, scoring 12 goals. He graduated from Loughborough University in 2007 where he achieved a degree in Geography with Sport and Leisure Management. Return to Ireland =Cork City= McSweeney moved back to his hometown club, Cork City F.C., in the League of Ireland in the summer of 2007, where he worked under well renowned Irish manager Damien Richardson . He made his debut in the League Cup Quarter- Final away to Bohemians . He was an instant success at Turners Cross, playing predominantly as a right winger and played a key role in the club's successful 2007 FAI Cup campaign culminating in a 1‚Äì0 victory over Longford Town FC. At the end of the Irish 2007 season McSweeney was voted Cork City's \\"signing of the season\\" by an online poll at corkcity.ie, but contract talks stalled due to the infamous 'Arkaga' takeover and, despite interest from Bohemians, he crossed the Irish Sea again, signing an 18-month contract with Stockport County under the management of fellow Irishman Jim Gannon . Back to England =Stockport County= Success followed McSweeney to Edgeley Park, and at the end of the 2007‚Äì2008 season he played his part in helping 'The Hatters' gain promotion via the playoffs at the new Wembley Stadium, where they beat Rochdale 3‚Äì2 in a pulsating encounter in front of almost 40,000 spectators. McSweeney continued his fine form in Stockport's League 1 campaign in 2008/09 with some eye catching performances in his new role as right back, and the Hatters style of football under Gannon allowed McSweeney become a crowd favourite, as he weighed in with 5 goals and 8 assists in all competitions. He went on to make almost 50 appearances for the Cheshire side before administration forced the club to cut costs in the summer of 2009. =Hartlepool United= McSweeney was then snapped up by Hartlepool United in May 2009 by Hartlepool's then Director of Sport Chris Turner. He went on to make over 70 appearance for \\"the Monkey Hangers\\" playing as both a right back and a winger scoring 4 goals and 17 assists in all competitions. In May 2011 he was not offered a new contract by the club, along with nine other players from the 2010‚Äì11 squad. =Leyton Orient= On 16 June 2011, McSweeney signed for Leyton Orient, where he worked for a second time under Russell Slade. He signed a two-year contract. After a slow start to his Orient career due to injury caused in his debut game away at Walsall, McSweeney soon established himself as first choice right back. His adaptability proved a useful tool with Slade using McSweeney in both midfield and often as an accomplished left back to fill the club's problem position. After 73 appearances in all competitions, and with the team finishing three points outside the playoffs in 7th, McSweeney was released by Orient on 30 April 2013. =Carlisle United= Having not won in their opening six games of the 2013/2014 season, Carlisle United manager Greg Abbott took McSweeney north to Cumbria signing a four- month deal with Carlisle United on 4 September 2013. Abbott was dismissed as manager after McSweeney's first game, a 1-0 home defeat to Port Vale resulting in Graham Kavanagh becoming caretaker manager. McSweeney played a key role in the oncoming fixtures helping the team secure consecutive wins against Sheffield United, Notts County and Stevenage. As a result of this upturn in club fortunes Graham Kavanagh was appointed full-time manager. McSweeney went on to start 10 games for the Cumbrians, winning 6 and drawing 2, but was informed that his short term deal would not be extended beyond January as a result of budget overspending. =Northampton Town= McSweeney became one of new manager, Chris Wilder, first signings as manager of Northampton Town, signing him on a contract until the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season on 30 January 2014, with the team seven points adrift at the foot of the League two table. McSweeney instantly slotted in at right back for the struggling 'Cobblers' and went on to make 18 appearances in the remaining 20 games helping the team secure safety in the division on the last day of the season with victory over Oxford. A detailed account of Northampton's relegation battle, \\"Cobblers and the Great Escape\\", can be found at McSweeney's personal blog http://sweeneymc83blog.wordpress.com. Despite the club's survival, McSweeney was not offered a renewed contract and was released at the end of the 2014 season along with eight othershttp://www.football- league.co.uk/news/article/2014/northampton-town-bid-farewell-to- eight-1963527.aspx Honours Hucknall Town ‚Ä¢ Northern Premier League Winner (now Conference North): 2004 Hednesford Town ‚Ä¢ Southern Premier League Play- Off Winner: 2005 Cork City ‚Ä¢ FAI Cup Winner: 2007 Stockport County ‚Ä¢ League 2 Play-Off Winner: 2008 References External links * Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Cork (city) Category:Association football midfielders Category:Association football forwards Category:Republic of Ireland association footballers Category:Cork City F.C. players Category:Leicester City F.C. players Category:Hednesford Town F.C. players Category:Hucknall Town F.C. players Category:Ilkeston Town F.C.

While they are saying their goodbyes, Karen McCluskey alerts them that a tornado is on its way. Lynette goes to Karen McCluskey's house and asks her to let her and her family stay with her in her basement during the storm. Mrs. McCluskey reluctantly agrees. Katherine is taping up her windows when she spies Sylvia loitering outside her house. When she goes out to confront her, she finds out that Sylvia met with Adam the day before, and Adam didn't tell her. Katherine spits in Sylvia's face, a confrontation spotted by Bree, who is nearby. Bree, seeing a chance to find out something about Katherine, approaches Sylvia, and invites her in for tea. After learning that Orson has prescribed painkillers to Mike, Susan tells Bree that it may be time to tell Orson about Mike's drug problem. Bree informs Susan that she had already alerted Orson to the issue. While drinking tea, Sylvia tells Bree all about her affair with Adam and describes a tattoo he has. Bree begins feeling uncomfortable and asks her to leave, but Sylvia locks herself in Bree's bathroom, which Bree has outfitted as a safe-room in anticipation of the approaching storm. Susan interrupts Orson in his office while he's with a patient. She asks him why he would prescribe pills to Mike, knowing that he's an addict. She then threatens him with great pain if he gives Mike any more pills. Edie becomes angry when she finds out that Gaby and Carlos are getting ready to move. When Mike finds out that Susan has found and taken his stash of pills he confronts her and during the ensuing argument, he grabs her arm on the stairs, and when she pulls away from him, she falls down the stairs, necessitating a trip to the hospital. While at the hospital, Mike begins to show effects of withdrawal and becomes agitated when Susan, not considered an emergency case, is not seen quickly enough by doctors. In his anger, he assaults a hospital employee and is restrained by hospital security. When Adam gets home he is confronted by Katherine regarding Sylvia's arrival in Fairview. Their argument is interrupted by Bree, who comes to get Adam to help her with Sylvia, who is still locked in Bree's bathroom. While Adam attempts to talk Sylvia out of the bathroom, Katherine tells Bree that Sylvia is crazy, and that the story she told, about her relationship with Adam was untrue and never happened. While Ida and Karen play cards in the basement, they are invaded by the Scavos. Tom immediately begins having asthma symptoms, due to Ida's cat, which she has in a carrier in the basement, and has difficulty breathing. When Lynette asks if the cat can be put upstairs, Karen refuses and advises Lynette that Ida's cat can stay. Susan is seen by a doctor, who advises that her baby is fine, and she has a sprained ankle. She tells Mike that the Doctor says that the hospital has a great rehab program and she asks him to go. Mike initially refuses. Susan is then given some painkillers, which Mike, When a nurse gives Susan some pain medication for her ankle, Mike wants Susan to share them with him. Susan gets very angry and demands he go to rehab or she will leave him. He finally agrees. Carlos' accountant, Al, comes to Gaby's house to drop off the paperwork with the information to allow them to access Carlos' offshore Grand Cayman account. When he gets there, he meets Edie on the porch, who he mistakes for Gabrielle. He gives her the papers. When Edie reads them, she realizes what they are, and she takes the papers and runs off. Gaby sees her and takes off after her. In Karen McCluskey's basement, Tom's asthma symptoms are increasing and he is having significant problems breathing. Lynette sneaks the cat from the cage and takes it upstairs and attempts to put it in the closet, when she is caught by Karen. Lynette doesn't understand why Karen would allow Tom to go through this, when Karen informs Lynette that Ida is her friend and cares about her, and that she does not feel that Lynette treats her like a friend. Just then, the storm blows open the front door and the cat runs out. Karen runs out after the cat, and Lynette, after a momentary hesitation, runs out after Karen. Gaby breaks a window to gain entrance into Edie's house, where Edie is going through the paperwork from Al. Gaby gets hold of it and runs outside, chased by Edie. When Edie catches her, they struggle, and in the process, the paperwork blows away. As the tornado descends onto Wisteria Lane, Karen locates Ida's cat under a nearby car. Lynnette gets to her and attempts to get Karen to come back in the house, but before she can get Karen to come in, they both see the tornado coming. They run into Lynette's house where they hide in a bathtub covered with a mattress. Edie and Gaby get into the storm cellar in Edie's house, where they talk and Gaby apologizes for what she and Carlos did. Edie admits she does not really hate Gaby. Meanwhile, Adam is still arguing with Sylvia, trying to get her to open the bathroom door. They give up and he, Katherine, Bree, Orson and the baby go into a closet. While in there, Bree mentions Sylvia's comments about her and Adam having been lovers, and about Adam's tattoo, at which point, Katherine realized that Sylvia was telling the truth, as Adam had had a tattoo, which he had since had removed, and Sylvia could not have known about it unless her relationship had been as she had described. Carlos arrives at Gaby's house and begins frantically searching for her. He then spies Victor sitting in the front room. When Carlos asks Victor where Gaby is, Victor tells him that he doesn't know, but that they will have to wait for her together and pulls out a gun. When Carlos begins to explain to Victor that he never meant to hurt anyone, Victor starts shooting at him, leading Carlos to run out into the storm, with Victor chasing him. They run outside and in the midst of the storm begin fighting. Victor loses the gun, and Carlos manages to punch Victor, and to temporarily get away. Victor catches up with Carlos, and is killed when he is impaled by board from a white picket fence. Seconds later, a metal object knocks Carlos out cold. Meanwhile, Sylvia finally leaves the bathroom and begins wandering through Bree's house looking for Adam. She opens the front door and is sucked out by the tornado's strong winds. After the storm abates, there is destruction everywhere; the residents of Wisteria Lane emerge from their hiding places to complete and utter destruction. Lynette and Karen crawl through the mountains of debris in the street and Lynette screams in horror when she sees that Mrs. McCluskey's house has been completely demolished, with her family, and Ida Greenburg inside.

Aberdare RUFC play in the Welsh Rugby Union Division Two East Central and is a feeder club for the Cardiff Blues. Club History The first mention of an Aberdare club came in 1876, when on 30/11/1876 Aberdare played away to Merthyr, losing by two tries.https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4344986/4344992/64/football In September 1883 it was decided to \\"re-start\\" the Aberdare club.https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3026200/3026204/57/football Aberdare RUFC began as Aberaman Rugby Football Club, a team formed in 1890, though the earliest written conformation of their existence is from a match in 1895 against a team from Ferndale. In the early 1900s the team joined the Glamorgan league, playing other coal mining towns such as Maesteg, Treorchy and Treherbert. In 1907 Aberdare were involved in an early rugby scandal linked to professionalism. Local collier Dai 'Tarw' Jones was one of Aberdare's star players and captained the club from 1905 to 1907. For his services to the club he was paid 10 shillings a week along with meal costs and train fares. When the club cut the wage to 5 shillings, Jones switched allegiance to Treherbert, commuting from his home town of Aberdare on match days. Aberdare's ex-secretary E. Rees in 1907 made several allegations in the press that broke multiple union rules. Not only did he mention the wages but also stated that leading teams had been paid to visit the town and stated Aberdare was involved in match fixing. During the 1904/05 season, Aberdare won the Glamorgan League by beating Treorchy in the last match. Rees claimed that Treorchy had agreed to lose the game for ¬£15.Fields of Praise, The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union 1881-1981, David Smith, Gareth Williams (1980) pg 180 The resulting investigation from the WRU, at the time still called the Welsh Football Union, spread far further than the two clubs mentioned by Rees. The union saw 6 players temporarily suspended, including Welsh international Fred Scrine, Merthyr escaped with a warning but Treorchy and Aberdare saw the permanent suspension of their entire committees. The union also permanently suspended eight players, including Jones who switched to rugby league. The events of the investigation led to bad feeling in the rugby community of Aberdare, and was a major factor in Aberdare founding Aberdare RLFC, one of the first professional rugby league clubs and member of the Welsh League. This combination of the change to Northern League and the resultant 1908 team photo, which featured several players wearing 'snake belts' to hold up their shorts, gave rise to the nickname of \\"The Snakes\\". During the 2015/2016 season Aberdare RUFC were crowned champions of Welsh Rugby Union's Division 3 East Central A. Aberdare RUFC were confirmed champions on 27 April 2016 with a 47‚Äì30 victory over Cardiff based side Fairwater RFC with two games to spare. This was notably one of Aberdare's most successful seasons since the club's formation in 1890, being only the second side in the 125-year history to be crowned champions of their respective league. Fittingly Aberdare RUFC celebrated becoming league champions on their 125th Anniversary year. This side, that was led by Captain Daniel William Lewis was well known for the exciting brand of running rugby they brought to the table scoring over 100 tries during the season and notching up over 700 points in the \\"for\\" column, 200 points more than their closest competitors. There was only one recorded loss in the league during the campaign and this reflected the team's excellent defensive displays.

It is a low-budget spoof of the Sherlock Holmes detective series, as well as the mystery genre in general. Plot The film begins aboard a luxury aircraft as Dr. Gropinger (Ron Moody) travels on a goodwill tour. He misplaces his diary and is thrown into a panic as, without the diary, he no longer knows where he is or is supposed to be next. Stepping off the plane, he is shot dead after extending greetings in Hebrew to a congregation of Arabs. Soon after, the U.S. President (Joss Ackland in a caricature of Gerald Ford) receives a threatening letter signed only \\"Moriarty\\", claiming responsibility for the death. The letter also claims Moriarty has set in motion a plan that will allow him to gain control of the world. The president dispatches a top agent to London to work with the world's top law enforcement officials and find a strategy to combat Moriarty. Headed by an incompetent Englishman (Denholm Elliott), the committee settles on contacting the \\"present-day\\" Sherlock Holmes (John Cleese). He is enrolled by the Commissioner of Police (Stratford Johns) to lay plans for the capture of the descendant of Moriarty before he gains control of the world. Holmes reveals himself to be a great eccentric, with an affinity for certain addictive drugs (a nod to the literary Sherlock Holmes' experience with cocaine). He is accompanied by the descendant of Dr. Watson (Arthur Lowe), both a medical doctor and utter fool. Unfortunately, the commissioner is murdered before leaving the Holmes residence, his death mainly the result of Watson's rampant stupidity. The duo then proceed to Scotland Yard to discuss the situation with the committee. Before any plans can be made, much of the committee is murdered by a distant sniper. Without their help, Holmes dreams up a plan to invite all of the great detectives in the world to a party, with the hope of discovering the true identity of Moriarty. He reasons that Moriarty will be unable to pass up a chance at attacking all of them in one fell swoop. Many fictional detectives are parodied and handed gruesome deaths while Holmes and Watson wait in a suite. The murderer is revealed to be none other than an exact copy of Watson. Due to Watson's ineptitude and the impersonator's great skill in deception, Holmes is faced with a quandary in determining the real culprit (who is actually Moriarty).

At the invitation of Jacqueline Kennedy and Letitia Baldrige, he became a theatrical advisor to the John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson Administrations for White House dramatic and music presentations in the East Room (1961‚Äì1965). He was a founding member of the National Theatre Corporation (1974) and was Vice-President and then President and Executive Director of the National Theatre in Washington, D.C. from 1974 to 2010. Biography Born in San Antonio, Texas, Murphy grew up in Leavenworth, Kansas, where his father, Arthur Morton Murphy, a Knight of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, was president of Saint Mary College (now the University of Saint Mary (Kansas)). His mother, Claire Frances McCarthy Murphy, wrote children's stories. He graduated from Sacred Heart School and Immaculata High School in Leavenworth, and Saint Benedict's College (now Benedictine College) in Atchison, Kansas. He served three years in the National Guard, 174th Military Police Battalion, in Leavenworth, Kansas.

It is the national flower of Afghanistan. This tall, late-blooming species has a single blooming flower and linear or broadly lanceolate leaves. This is a complex hybridized neo-species, and can also be called Tulipa √ó gesneriana.Maarten J. M. Christenhusz, Rafa√´l Govaerts, John C. David, Tony Hall, Katherine Borland, Penelope S. Roberts, Anne Tuomisto, Sven Buerki, Mark W. Chase, Michael F. Fay, Tiptoe through the tulips ‚Äì cultural history, molecular phylogenetics and classification of Tulipa (Liliaceae). Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society 172, 2013, 312 Most of the cultivars of tulip are derived from Tulipa gesneriana. It has become naturalised in parts of central and southern Europe and scattered locations in North America.Illustration and excerpt of Tulipa gesneriana. This hybrid is widely believed to have originated in Turkey, from the collections of the sultan of the Ottoman Empire in Istanbul, as is the case with other species of tulips that came into Europe. In 1574, Sultan Selim II ordered the Kadi of A‚ÄòazƒÅz in Syria to send him 50,000 tulip bulbs. However, Harvey points out several problems with this source, and there is also the possibility that tulips and hyacinth (s√ºmb√ºll), originally Indian spikenard (Nardostachys jatamansi) have been confused. Sultan Selim also imported 300,000 bulbs of Kefe Lale (also known as Cafe-Lale, from the medieval name Kaffa, probably Tulipa schrenkii) from the port of Kefe in Crimea, for his gardens in the Topkapƒ± Sarayƒ± in Istanbul. They are hybridized with other species present in the collections. Tulipa schrenkii is genetically very closely related to Tulipa gesneriana, and sometimes classified in the same species. When the tulip originally arrived in Europe from the Ottoman Empire, its popularity soared and it quickly became a status symbol for the newly wealthy merchants of the Dutch Golden Age. As a mosaic virus began to infect bulbs, producing rare and spectacular effects in the bloom but weakening and destroying the already limited number of bulbs, a speculative frenzy now known as tulip mania was triggered between 1634 and 1637. Bulbs were exchanged for land, livestock, and houses, and the Dutch created futures markets where contracts to buy bulbs at the end of the season were bought and sold.Goldgar, Anne, Tulipmania: Money, Honor, and Knowledge in the Dutch Golden Age, University of Chicago Press, p. 322. A single bulb, the Semper Augustus, fetched 6,000 florins in Haarlem ‚Äî at that time, a florin could purchase a bushel of wheat. The flower and bulb can cause dermatitis through the allergen, tuliposide A, even though the bulbs may be consumed with little ill effect. The bulbs may be dried and pulverised and added to cereals or flour. The sweet-scented bisexual flowers appear during April and May. Bulbs are extremely resistant to frost and can tolerate temperatures well below freezing ‚Äî a period of low temperature is necessary to induce proper growth and flowering, triggered by an increase in sensitivity to the phytohormone auxin.Rietveld, Patrick L.; Wilkinson, Claire; Franssen, Hanneke M.; Balk, Peter A.; van der Plas, Linus H.W.; Weisbeek, Peter J.; de Boer, A.

Commissioner, 485 U.S. 212 (1988), is a United States Supreme Court decision that helps taxpayers classify whether or not the sale of an asset is an ordinary or capital gain or loss for income tax purposes..  Facts  Arkansas Best, a diversified holding company acquired a large percentage of the stock of the National Bank of Commerce in Dallas, Texas. When the real estate market in Dallas faltered, Arkansas Best sold a large portion of its stake in the Bank at a loss. Arkansas Best claimed a deduction for an ordinary loss of nearly $10 million from the sale. The Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service disallowed the deduction, finding that it was a capital, not ordinary loss.  Issue  Was the stock properly a capital asset as defined by I.R.C. ¬ß 1221? Should the Court read ¬ß 1221 broadly as it had in Corn Products Refining Co. v. Commissioner, 350 U.S. 46 (1955)?  Holding  The Eighth Circuit reversed the Tax Court's determination that the loss was an ordinary loss since the Bank stock fell within the general definition of ‚Äúcapital asset‚Äù in I.R.C. ¬ß 1221 and did not fall within any of the statutory exceptions in the section. A taxpayer's motivation in purchasing an asset is irrelevant to its classification.  Reasoning  *The broad definition of the term ‚Äúcapital asset‚Äù explicitly makes irrelevant any consideration of the property's connection with the taxpayer's business. The motive behind the purchase of the asset is not mentioned as a factor in ¬ß 1221. *Congress does not direct the Court to read ¬ß 1221 liberally. Congress intended the specific exceptions explicitly contained in ¬ß 1221. *The holding in Corn Products is that hedging transactions that are an integral part of a business‚Äô inventory-purchase system fall within the inventory exclusion of ¬ß 1221. This ruling does not apply to the facts of this case. *The capital stock held by Arkansas Best falls within the broad definition of a ‚Äúcapital asset‚Äù in ¬ß 1221 and is outside the classes of property excluded from capital-asset status.  Notes  = Corn Products Refining Co. v. Commissioner, 350 U.S. 46 (1955) = The Corn Products case involved discussion of whether income arising from the sale of corn futures by a company that refined corn into other forms and food products were entitled to capital gains treatment. The company bought corn futures to protect their future corn supply and pricing and would sell the futures if it had excess inventory corn for its processes. As the corn futures were essentially inventory, they were classified as such property which would ‚Äúproperly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer ‚Ä¶ in the ordinary course of his trade or business.‚Äù I.R.C. ¬ß 1221(a)(1). = IRC ¬ß 1221(a)(7) = Since the time of Corn Products, IRC ¬ß1221(a)(7) was added which specifically excludes from the definition of capital asset \\"any hedging transaction which is clearly identified as such before the close of the day on which it was acquired, originated, or entered into (or other such time as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe).\\" This is essentially a codification of the result in Corn Products and removes the necessity of classifying hedging transactions as \\"inventory\\" under IRC ¬ß 1221(a)(1).  Importance  This case signals that the Court will closely read the exclusions in I.R.C. ¬ß 1221 in classifying capital versus ordinary losses. By sticking with the explicit language of the section the Court clarifies this section for other courts and practitioners interpreting and implementing the Code.

In 1629, Franciscan friar Garc√≠a de Z√∫√±iga and a Capuch√≠n monk named Antonio de Arteaga planted the first wine grapes in Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico, in what would become the modern Middle Rio Grande Valley AVA. Today, wineries exist in the aforementioned Middle Rio Grande Valley, as well as the Mesilla Valley AVA and the Mimbres Valley AVA. Viticulture took hold since its 1629 introduction, in the middle Rio Grande and the surrounding area, and by the year 1880 grapes were grown on over , and wineries produced over of wine. The editor of the Socorro bulletin predicted in 1880 that \\"We see in the present attention given to grape culture, an important and growing industry which, in a few years, will assume proportions of no ordinary nature.\\"Socorro Bullion 1883-87. The wine industry in New Mexico declined in the latter decades of the nineteenth century in part due to flooding of the R√≠o Grande. Prohibition in the United States also forced many wineries to close, while others remained operational providing sacramental wine to primarily Catholic as well as other Christian churches. The modern New Mexico wine industry received significant support in 1978 when a government- sponsored study encouraged winegrowers to grow New Mexican heritage grapes, and to work in collaboration with Italian, Spanish and French wineries to make hybrid grape varieties. New Mexico now has more than 60 wineries producing of wine annually. History = Origins of viticulture in New Mexico = In 1598 Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico was founded, after Don Juan de O√±ate led Spanish colonists to the upper valleys of the Rio Grande near Espa√±ola, New Mexico. Santa Fe, New Mexico was established in 1610, and further south near the Mesilla Valley Franciscan monks followed the colonists to minister Christianity to the Native Americans and Hispanos of New Mexico. The Franciscan monks who settled along the Rio Grande needed to hold daily mass; central to each mass was Holy Communion, a sacrament that includes the consumption of wine, which upon transubstantiation, becomes the blood of Christ shed for the redemptions of sinners. The monks needed a local source for their sacramental wine since the next nearest supply was several months' travel away. In this region of the Upper R√≠o Grande is where grape vines were first introduced to New Mexico. Before grapevines were planted in New Mexico, the Franciscan monks had wine shipped from Spain. The sacramental wine was light pink in color, had a sherry-like taste, was 18% alcohol, and 10% sugar. The wine was transported in heavy jugs resembling those in Roman times. The stoneware jugs held approximately 2.6 to 3.6 gallons (9.8 to 13.6 liters) each and were sealed with a cork or wood plug. The jugs needed to be sealed with a green glaze, applied to the inside of the jug. This glaze would have contained lead that leaked out into the wine during prolonged exposure to heat or to the acid in the wine. Grapevine planting in New Mexico was initially hindered by Spanish law which in 1595 forbid the exportation of Spanish grapevines to protect the Spanish agriculture industry. At the time, Spanish wine exports provided one fourth of Spain's foreign trade revenue. Franciscan monks chose to ignore this economic law and smuggled vines out of Spain into New Mexico around 1629. Fray Garc√≠a de Z√∫√±iga, a Franciscan, and Antonio de Arteaga, a Capuch√≠n monk, planted the first vines at a Piro pueblo just south of modern- day Socorro. The cuttings brought by the missionaries were a Vitis vinifera grape variety known as the Mission grape. This variety is still grown in New Mexico today. As El Camino Real arrived in New Mexico, the city of Albuquerque was established to serve as an outpost for all of the towns and pueblos in the central Rio Grande. Wine was grown in these old towns, including near Barelas, Corrales, Old Town Albuquerque, Sandia Pueblo, Los Ranchos, and Isleta Pueblo. This region is now referred to as the Middle Rio Grande Valley AVA. Sparkling wine made in New Mexico =Expansion of the wine industry in New Mexico= Between 1633 and 1800, numerous events took place which threatened the wine industry in New Mexico. Several pueblo revolts and hard winters threatened the grapes, but by the 1800s New Mexico had emerged as wine country. In 1800, vineyards were planted from Bernalillo to Socorro in central New Mexico and from Las Cruces to El Paso, Texas in the southern part of the state. In 1850, New Mexico became a territory of the United States. In 1868, Jesuit priests settled in New Mexico and brought their Italian wine making techniques, founding a winery in 1872. In 1870, New Mexico produced of wine. By 1880, New Mexico produced . The 1880 census indicated that New Mexico had twice the grapevine area of New York, a more developed state. New Mexico was fifth in the nation in wine production. New Mexico State University has long played a part in the cultivation, expansion, and education of grape growing and winemaking in New Mexico. In 1920, at the beginning of Prohibition in the United States, Giovanni Giorgio Rinaldi took over production of Christian Brothers Winery in Bernalillo. He enlisted the help of faculty at New Mexico A & M College, in Las Cruces, now New Mexico State University. With their help, Rinaldi improved grape production and experimented with other grape varieties and grape growing styles. Zinfandel, a grape from Europe Primitivo, was the result of experimentation with grape varieties by Rinaldi and New Mexico A & M. Rinaldi remained Christian Brother's Winery manager until 1933 when prohibition ended. =Decline and rebirth= Grapevine nursery at the largest vineyard in Deming, New Mexico At the turn of the twentieth century, the R√≠o Grande and its tributaries experienced extensive flooding. In 1926, the first R√≠o Grande flood occurred that impacted the vineyards throughout the grape growing region, from Bernalillo to El Paso. Prohibition began in 1919, and only a small amount of medicinal alcohol could be legally produced and sold. Though the sale of wine was hindered, the grapevine acreage doubled between 1920 and 1930. In 1943, the largest R√≠o Grande flood of the century destroyed vineyards throughout New Mexico. Vineyards that had been producing wine for fifty years were destroyed. What remained of the old commercial wine industry in New Mexico never recovered from these floods. By 1977, small commercial wineries opened their doors, creating wine from mostly French-Hybrid grape varietals. These cold-hardy grapevines prospered in northern New Mexico. The first of these wineries to open was La Vi√±a Winery, now the oldest continually-operating winery in New Mexico. La Chiripada Winery, in Dixon, NM planted its vines in 1977, the first vines to be planted in Northern New Mexico since prohibition. They opened with their first vintage in 1981, and remains family-operated to this day. La Chiripada Winery is the oldest continuously-owned winery in New Mexico. In 1981, the Oppenheimer Corporation began marketing plots of \\"vineyard\\" land in the Armendariz Ranch, near Engle, which drew Herv√© Lescombes and his family from Burgundy, France. Many more European investors were to follow suit, attracted to the inexpensive land and underdeveloped wine market. Due to the lack of water rights, and the great distance for irrigation, the land was deemed unfit for farming and many investors went bankrupt or pulled-out. Herv√© Lescombes continued buying better-suited portions of land across southwest New Mexico, planting again in 1982. By 1984, St. Clair Winery opened their winery and first tasting room, quickly becoming the largest winery in New Mexico. Today, Herv√© Lescombes' sons, Florent and Emmanuel, own and operate 5 locations across New Mexico, with over 180 acres of family-owned vineyards. Between 1982 and 1983, of vineyards were planted around Las Cruces. By 1986, there were 7,000 acres across New Mexico, falling to 700 acres by 1989. Many more vineyards and extensive acres of grapes were planted until present day.

Reviewer: Douglas Levine, Gynecology Service/Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY. Asynclitic presentation is significantly different from a shoulder presentation, in which the shoulder is presenting first. Many babies enter the pelvis in an asynclitic presentation, and most asynclitism corrects spontaneously as part of the normal birthing process. Persistence of asynclitism can cause problems with dystocia, and has often been associated with cesarean birth. However, with a skilled midwife or obstetrician a complication-free vaginal birth can sometimes, though not necessarily, be achieved through movement and positioning of the birthing woman, and patience and extra time to allow for movement of the baby through the pelvis and moulding of the skull during the birthing process if this is safe in the circumstances. Where intervention is the safest option in asynclitic birth, Kielland forceps are preferable obstetric forceps used in asynclitic births, for example by their sliding mechanism, availing for more appropriate adjustment of the blades.

Chk1 coordinates the DNA damage response (DDR) and cell cycle checkpoint response. Activation of Chk1 results in the initiation of cell cycle checkpoints, cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and cell death to prevent damaged cells from progressing through the cell cycle. Discovery In 1993, Beach and associates initially identified Chk1 as a serine/threonine kinase which regulates the G2/M phase transition in fission yeast. Constitutive expression of Chk1 in fission yeast was shown to induce cell cycle arrest. The same gene called Rad27 was identified in budding yeast by Carr and associates. In 1997, homologs were identified in more complex organisms including the fruit fly, human and mouse. Through these findings, it is apparent Chk1 is highly conserved from yeast to humans.  Structure  Human Chk1 is located on chromosome 11 on the cytogenic band 11q22-23. Chk1 has a N-terminal kinase domain, a linker region, a regulatory SQ/TQ domain and a C-terminal domain. Chk1 contains four Ser/Gln residues. Chk 1 activation occurs primarily through the phosphorylation of the conserved sites, Ser-317, Ser-345 and less often at Ser-366.  Function  Checkpoint kinases (Chks) are protein kinases that are involved in cell cycle control. Two checkpoint kinase subtypes have been identified, Chk1 and Chk2. Chk1 is a central component of genome surveillance pathways and is a key regulator of the cell cycle and cell survival. Chk1 is required for the initiation of DNA damage checkpoints and has recently been shown to play a role in the normal (unperturbed) cell cycle. Chk1 impacts various stages of the cell cycle including the S phase, G2/M transition and M phase. In addition to mediating cell cycle checkpoints, Chk1 also contributes to DNA repair processes, gene transcription, embryo development, cellular responses to HIV infection and somatic cell viability. =S phase= Chk1 is essential for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Chk1 monitors DNA replication in unperturbed cell cycles and responds to genotoxic stress if present. Chk1 recognizes DNA strand instability during replication and can stall DNA replication in order to allow time for DNA repair mechanisms to restore the genome. Recently, Chk1 has shown to mediate DNA repair mechanisms and does so by activating various repair factors. Furthermore, Chk1 has been associated with three particular aspects of the S-phase, which includes the regulation of late origin firing, controlling the elongation process and maintenance of DNA replication fork stability. =G2/M transition= In response to DNA damage, Chk1 is an important signal transducer for G2/M checkpoint activation. Activation of Chk1 holds the cell in the G2 phase until ready to enter the mitotic phase. This delay allows time for DNA to repair or cell death to occur if DNA damage is irreversible. Chk1 must inactivate in order for the cell to transition from the G2 phase into mitosis, Chk1 expression levels are mediated by regulatory proteins. =M phase= Chk1 has a regulatory role in the spindle checkpoint however the relationship is less clear as compared to checkpoints in other cell cycle stages. During this phase the Chk1 activating element of ssDNA can not be generated suggesting an alternate form of activation. Studies on Chk1 deficient chicken lymphoma cells have shown increased levels of genomic instability and failure to arrest during the spindle checkpoint phase in mitosis. Furthermore, haploinsufficient mammary epithelial cells illustrated misaligned chromosomes and abnormal segregation. These studies suggest Chk1 depletion can lead to defects in the spindle checkpoint resulting in mitotic abnormalities.  Interactions  DNA damage induces the activation of Chk1 which facilitates the initiation of the DNA damage response (DDR) and cell cycle checkpoints. The DNA damage response is a network of signaling pathways that leads to activation of checkpoints, DNA repair and apoptosis to inhibit damaged cells from progressing through the cell cycle. =Chk1 activation= Chk1 is regulated by ATR through phosphorylation, forming the ATR-Chk1 pathway. This pathway recognizes single strand DNA (ssDNA) which can be a result of UV-induced damage, replication stress and inter-strand cross linking. Often ssDNA can be a result of abnormal replication during S phase through the uncoupling of replication enzymes helicase and DNA polymerase. These ssDNA structures attract ATR and eventually activates the checkpoint pathway. However, activation of Chk1 is not solely dependent on ATR, intermediate proteins involved in DNA replication are often necessary. Regulatory proteins such as replication protein A, Claspin, Tim/Tipin, Rad 17, TopBP1 may be involved to facilitate Chk1 activation. Additional protein interactions are involved to induce maximal phosphorylation of Chk1. Chk1 activation can also be ATR-independent through interactions with other protein kinases such as PKB/AKT, MAPKAPK and p90/RSK. Also, Chk1 has been shown to be activated by the Scc1 subunit of the protein cohesin, in zygotes. =Cell cycle arrest= Chk1 interacts with many downstream effectors to induce cell cycle arrest. In response to DNA damage, Chk1 primarily phosphorylates Cdc25 which results in its proteasomal degradation. The degradation has an inhibitory effect on the formation of cyclin-dependent kinase complexes, which are key drivers of the cell cycle. Through targeting Cdc25, cell cycle arrest can occur at multiple time points including the G1/S transition, S phase and G2/M transition. Furthermore, Chk1 can target Cdc25 indirectly through phosphorylating Nek11. WEE1 kinase and PLK1 are also targeted by Chk1 to induce cell cycle arrest. Phosphorylation of WEE1 kinase inhibits cdk1 which results in cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase. Chk1 has a role in the spindle checkpoint during mitosis thus interacts with spindle assembly proteins Aurora A kinase and Aurora B kinase. =DNA repair= Recently, Chk1 has shown to mediate DNA repair mechanisms and does so by activating repair factors such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), FANCE, Rad51 and TLK. Chk1 facilitates replication fork stabilization during DNA replication and repair however more research is necessary to define the underlying interactions. Clinical relevance Chk1 has a central role in coordinating the DNA damage response and therefore is an area of great interest in oncology and the development of cancer therapeutics. Initially Chk1 was thought to function as a tumor suppressor due to the regulatory role it serves amongst cells with DNA damage. However, there has been no evidence of homozygous loss of function mutants for Chk1 in human tumors. Instead, Chk1 has been shown to be overexpressed in numerous tumors including breast, colon, liver, gastric and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. There is a positive correlation with Chk1 expression and tumor grade and disease recurrence suggesting Chk1 may promote tumor growth. Chk1 is essential for cell survival and through high levels of expressions in tumors the function may be inducing tumor cell proliferation. Further, a study has demonstrated that targeting CHK1 reactivates the tumour suppressive activity of protein phosphtase 2A (PP2A) complex in cancer cells. Studies have shown complete loss of Chk1 suppresses chemically induce carcinogenesis however Chk1 haploinsufficiency results in tumor progression. Due to the possibility of Chk1 involvement in tumor promotion, the kinase and related signaling molecules may be potentially effective therapeutic targets. Cancer therapies utilize DNA damaging therapies such as chemotherapies and ionizing radiation to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest. Tumor cells with increased levels of Chk1 acquire survival advantages due to the ability to tolerate a higher level of DNA damage. Therefore, Chk1 may contribute to chemotherapy resistance. In order to optimize chemotherapies, Chk1 must be inhibited to reduce the survival advantage. Chk1 gene can be effectively silenced by siRNA knockdown for further analysis based on an independent validation. By inhibiting Chk1, cancer cells lose the ability to repair damaged DNA which allows chemotherapeutic agents to work more effectively. Combining DNA damaging therapies such as chemotherapy or radiation treatment with Chk1 inhibition enhances targeted cell death and provides synthetic lethality. Many cancers rely on Chk1 mediated cell cycle arrest heavily especially if cancers are deficient in p53. Approximately 50% of cancers possess p53 mutations illustrating the dependence that many cancers may have on the Chk1 pathway. Inhibition of Chk1 allows selective targeting of p53 mutant cells as Chk1 levels are more likely to highly expressed in tumor cells with p53 deficiencies. Even though this method of inhibition is highly targeted, recent research has shown Chk1 also has a role in the normal cell cycle. Therefore, off-target effects and toxicity associated with combination therapies using CHk1 inhibitors must be considered during development of novel therapies. Meiosis During meiosis in human and mouse, CHEK1 protein kinase is important for integrating DNA damage repair with cell cycle arrest. CHEK1 is expressed in the testes and associates with meiotic synaptonemal complexes during the zygonema and pachynema stages. CHEK1 likely acts as an integrator for ATM and ATR signals and may be involved in monitoring meiotic recombination. In mouse oocytes CHEK1 appears to be indispensable for prophase I arrest and to function at the G2/M checkpoint.

Function  FHIT is also known as human accelerated region 10. It may, therefore, have played a key role in differentiating humans from apes. supplement This gene, a member of the histidine triad gene family, encodes a diadenosine P1,P3-bis(5'-adenosyl)-triphosphate adenylohydrolase involved in purine metabolism. The gene encompasses the common fragile site FRA3B on chromosome 3, where carcinogen-induced damage can lead to translocations and aberrant transcripts of this gene. In fact, aberrant transcripts from this gene have been found in about half of all esophageal, stomach, and colon carcinomas. Though the exact molecular function of FHIT is still partially unclear, the gene works as a tumor suppressor as it has been demonstrated in animal studies. Furthermore FHIT has been shown to synergize with VHL, another tumor suppressor, in protecting against chemically - induced lung cancer. FHIT also acts as a tumor suppressor of HER2/neu driven breast cancer.  Interactions  FHIT has been shown to interact with UBE2I.

The distinction is that the surface gradient takes effect along a surface. For a surface S in a scalar field u, the surface gradient is defined and notated as : abla_S u = abla u - \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n} (\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n} \\\\cdot abla u) where \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n} is a unit normal to the surface.R. Shankar Subramanian, Boundary Conditions in Fluid Mechanics. Examining the definition shows that the surface gradient is the (conventional) gradient with the component normal to the surface removed (subtracted), hence this gradient is tangent to the surface. In other words, the surface gradient is the orthographic projection of the gradient onto the surface. The surface gradient arises whenever the gradient of a quantity over a surface is important. In the study of capillary surfaces for example, the gradient of spatially varying surface tension doesn't make much sense, however the surface gradient does and serves certain purposes.

He was the older brother of Jim Houston. Houston played with the Browns from their inception in 1946 through the 1953 season. Cleveland reached the league championship game in each of Houston eight seasons with the club, winning four times between 1946 and 1949 in the AAFC and once in the NFL in 1950. Houston played for coach Paul Brown during every phase of his football career: at Massillon (Ohio) High School, Ohio State and the Browns. He retired from football after the 1953 season and worked as an executive in the steel industry. He died in 1995. High school and college career Houston was born in Illinois, but his family moved to Ohio after a relative got a job at a steel mill in Massillon and convinced his father to move there. Houston had been a standout basketball player in Illinois, but Paul Brown, the head football coach at Massillon Washington High School, thought his combination of quickness and size would make him a good football player. He started as a middle guard on defense but was soon switched to an offensive guard, where he excelled. The Associated Press named him a first-team All-Ohio guard in 1938. After graduating from high school, Houston attended Ohio State University. He played as a guard on the school's varsity football team starting as a sophomore in 1941 under Paul Brown, who had by then been hired as the school's head football coach. Houston sat out for two weeks with a knee injury but returned to finish the season, and in 1942 became a regular starter at right guard. Collier's named him an All-American that season, when the Ohio State Buckeyes football team won the school's first national championship. Houston joined the U.S. Army in 1943. He stayed at Ohio State but was not allowed by the Army to play on the football team. In 1944, he played in the College All- Star Game against the Chicago Bears. Professional career Houston signed in 1946 with the Cleveland Browns, a professional team under formation in the new All-America Football Conference and coached by Paul Brown. Houston became a starter when Bill Willis was ill in 1946. The Browns won the AAFC championship that year. In later seasons, Houston rotated with Bob Gaudio as part of a system where Brown used guard substitutions to relay plays to his quarterback. The Browns won three more AAFC championships in 1947, 1948 and 1949 before the league dissolved and the Browns were absorbed by the more established National Football League. The Browns won the NFL championship in 1950, their first season in the league. Houston's job was to protect quarterback Otto Graham and open up running room for fullback Marion Motley. He was known for his toughness and durability. In a 1950 game against the Washington Redskins in which the Browns were ahead 24 points, he rushed through five Redskins players to make a tackle on a kickoff, risking injury. He played through a bad cold and injuries to his shoulder and face. Brown used him as a model to demonstrate blocking technique in training camp. The Browns reached the championship game in 1951 and 1952 but lost both times. Despite his reputation for durability, Houston suffered from numerous injuries during his career and announced he would retire after the 1952 season. He changed his mind, however, and returned in 1953, when the Browns again reached the championship game but lost to the Detroit Lions. He retired for good in 1954, after 12 years playing for Paul Brown's teams. He left the game to concentrate on his job at the Sharon Steel Products Company. Later life and death Houston spent much of his life after football as a steel executive. He died of cancer in 1995 and was inducted into the Stark County High School Football Hall of Fame in 2008.

The rodeo takes place the next day. Presumed the favourite to win by the town and himself, Cactus Kid realises he may have met his match in Lucky Luke, and resorts to foul play, sabotaging Luke's lasso and then trying to cut the strap of his saddle. This time, Lucky Luke takes him by the wayside and beats him up. Luke wins the rodeo but Cactus Kid takes revenge by grabbing the prize money. The sheriff and several men run after him, but it is Lucky Luke who succeeds in capturing him.

They quickly confront Luke who captures them during a stagecoach attack. However, the town is flooded with bandits, unwilling to accept the enforcement of the law, and Lucky Luke finds himself attacked from every direction. The undertaker is the boss of all these people who free the Pistol brothers and succeed in capturing Lucky Luke. He was barely saved from hanging by a panicked herd of cattle.

Caby was engaged in writing art critics and political articles, arranging concerts, creating surrealistic drawings and dealing with rare books and paintings. He had a wide circle of friends who were important musicians and artists of the time including Erik Satie, Darius Milhaud, Pablo Picasso, Francis Poulenc, Charles Koechlin and Henri Sauguet. In the mid-1960s he spent a considerable amount of time at the Biblioth√®que nationale, doing research and arrangements of Erik Satie's unpublished works from sketchbooks. In cooperation with Salabert he had all of them published posthumously, leading to an awakening public interest in the composer. Caby wrote almost 900 works, songs being in majority, with lyrics mostly by famous poets such as Guillaume Apollinaire. Some of his greatest influences were Erik Satie, Emmanuel Chabrier, Claude Debussy, Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert.

To be eligible for early release, the prisoner had to be affiliated to a paramilitary organisation that had established, and maintained, \\"a complete and unequivocal cease-fire\\". The Sentence Review Commission decided which prisoners should be released early and whether any were a threat to society and could re-offend.

He was imprisoned during the late 1930s and early 1940s by the Italian fascist regime for his anti-fascist activities. As a senior partisan of the Italian resistance movement after his release during World War II, Audisio was involved in the death of Benito Mussolini, and possibly personally killed the dictator and his mistress. After the war, he was elected to parliament for the Italian Communist Party, where he served for 20 years. Biography =Early activities= In school, Audisio rose to the top of his class, and first worked making Borsalino hats. He then worked for some years as an accountant before joining a clandestine anti-fascist group in 1931. The local group was discovered by the fascist secret police, the Organization for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism (Organizzazione per la Vigilanza e la Repressione dell'Antifascismo, or OVRA) and in 1934, Audisio was sentenced to five years confinement on the island of Ponza. Released during World War II, he resumed his activities against the government of Benito Mussolini, and in September 1943 he started to organize the first bands of partisans in Casale Monferrato. During this time he held jobs in the Fascist civil service. =Killing of Mussolini= During the war, he joined the Italian Communist Party and became the inspector of the Garibaldi Brigades, a faction of the National Liberation Committee (CNL), commanding the formations operating in the Province of Mantova and the Po Valley. By January 1945, he had become the principal figure of the Italian resistance movement in Milan. He used the nom de guerre \\"Colonnello Valerio\\", a name possibly also used by Luigi Longo. As an official of the National Liberation Committee, he received an order on 28 April 1945 to enter Dongo and execute Mussolini and others in the fascist hierarchy. The death of Mussolini remains shrouded in mystery today, but Audisio always claimed that he was the one who shot the dictator and his mistress, Claretta Petacci. =Post-war career= After the war Audisio continued working with the communist movement, and in 1948, was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies for Alessandria with the Italian Communist Party as part of the Popular Democratic Front. He supported the party until 1963, when he entered the Italian Senate. In 1968 he left to work for Italian gasoline company Eni. He died five years later in 1973 of a heart attack. His memoirs, titled In nome del popolo italiano, were published two years after his death, in 1975.

She is the founder and Chief Visionary Officer of AssistU, a Baltimore, Maryland-based organization committed to training, coaching, supporting, and certifying Virtual Assistants, and making referrals to the clients who want to work with them. History and philosophy In 1992, Brice moved out of the traditional employment world to establish a home-based business, providing travel planning and executive assistance. She subsequently began to formulate her vision of an archetypal administrative assistant; one who would work virtually using all available internet and more \\"usual\\" office technologies and who could, by virtue of the interwebs, work with clients who could be down the street or across the world. In 1996, she became involved with Coach U, first as Virtual Assistant to then owner, Thomas J. Leonard, and shortly afterward, as student, learning to coach women to have and live deeply authentic lives. In early '97, an article was published about her work as a Virtual Assistant in The Secretary (now Office Pro magazine), the trade publication of the International Association of Administrative Professionals. In the Spring of '97, Brice created the Virtual Assistance profession by founding AssistU‚Äì-an organization for Virtual Assistants, also known as VAs. It was designed to provide new Virtual Assistants with training, coaching, ongoing support through the life cycle of business, certification, community, and referrals to the members of the public who wanted to work with VAs. Brice's Virtual Training Program, a live, 20-week, intensive virtual training program that was offered from 1997-2011, contained more than 900 original pages of training content, and was delivered via teleclass so that it could be available to anyone anywhere there was a phone. It incorporated a feminine business model created by Brice which held at its core solid business-building principles, as well as inclusive support, teamwork, cooperation, collaboration, intuition, and a view to the long-term best interests of everyone involved. In 2011, Brice revamped the training to offer it as a self-study program with one-on- one mentoring, designed to meet the ever changing needs and preferred styles of adult learners. That program is called the Virtual Mentoring Program. Contributions and acknowledgments Brice was awarded the VACOC InnoVAtive Award in 2006 and 2007 for her pioneering work and leadership in the field. She was also named the first recipient of the Thomas Leonard International Virtual Assistant of Distinction Award (2006), but was disqualified when she was unable to be present for the award ceremony. In 2002, Brice was nominated for Fast Company's Fast 50. Brice is a past member of the Board of Directors of Women's U. She has served as the resident virtual work expert for The International Association of Solopreneurs. AllExperts.com, OfficePRO magazine, and Westaff's Ask Carmen Courtesy.

The import of proteins into the nucleus is a process that involves at least 2 steps. The first is an energy-independent docking of the protein to the nuclear envelope and the second is an energy-dependent translocation through the nuclear pore complex. Imported proteins require a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) which generally consists of a short region of basic amino acids or 2 such regions spaced about 10 amino acids apart. Proteins involved in the first step of nuclear import are members of the alpha importin family of karyopherins such as importin subunit alpha-2. These include the Xenopus protein importin and its yeast homolog, SRP1 (a suppressor of certain temperature-sensitive mutations of RNA polymerase I in Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which bind to the NLS.

The strike, which ran from March 7 to August 7, 1988, affected production on movies and TV shows. At 153 days, it remains the longest strike in the Guild's history, surpassing the 1960 Writers Guild of America strike by one week and the 2007‚Äì08 Writers Guild of America strike by seven weeks. Summary Formal negotiations between the writers guilds and producers began in January 1988. The main disagreementsThis Writers' Strike Feels Like a Rerun From 1988, The Wall Street Journal, November 12, 2007\\"Writers Strike Chronology,\\" from Los Angeles Times, 8/4/1988 included: * Residuals for hour- long shows (producers, claiming syndicated reruns of these shows were performing poorly in syndication, wanted a softened, percentage-based formula; writers wanted a residual hike) * Expanded creative rights (the writers wanted consultation on the choice of actors and directors for some projects) * Cost cuts in other areas (a producers' demand) The guilds' previous deal with producers expired on February 29, 1988. One day later, 96% of guild membership authorized a strike. On March 7, 1988, one day after rejecting a softened final offer from producers, 9,000 movie and television writers went on strike.Strike Announced By Writers For TV, New York Times, March 7, 1988 Negotiations took place during March and April under a federal mediator but broke off before resuming on May 23, again with a federal mediator. After intensive bargaining, producers made a \\"strike settlement offer\\" on June 16, 1988; the offer included an extended contract term (to four years) and expansion of creative rights, but still included the percentage-based residuals studios demanded and not a foreign residual increase writers demanded. The offer was turned down by the guilds' membership by a 3‚Äì1 margin. During July 1988, the Guild devised an interim contract. Membership approved it, and more than 150 smaller producers signed it. Major studios and outlets including Fox, Paramount, and the \\"Big Three\\" television networks refused projects from the independents who signed the deal, leading to the Guild filing an antitrust suit accusing 18 studios and networks of mounting an illegal boycott. Twenty-one dissident Guild members who still favored the June 16 offer filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board to seek invalidation of Guild rules that barred them from returning to work during a strike; some dissidents threatened to resign Guild membership and return to work if the strike was not settled by July 28. On July 23, 1988, formal bargaining resumed, again under the auspices of federal mediators; by July 30, however, talks collapsed, with studios threatening to not bargain any further and to concentrate on producing work with non-union scripts. Behind-the-scenes \\"shuttle diplomacy\\" involving Guild negotiators, studio heads, and emissaries began on July 31 in an effort to revive talks. Guild officials and studio representatives met on August 2 to discuss the proposals, and on August 3 announced a tentative deal. While the new deal gave studios the sliding residual scale they sought for hour-long reruns, writers won a modest financial gain when hour-long shows were sold internationally. The writers also gained creative rights regarding original screenplays and TV movies. The Guild board approved the deal by a 26‚Äì6 vote; Guild membership also approved the deal (2,111 in favor, 412 against), and the strike formally ended on August 7, 1988.\\"Writers Ratify Contract, Ending Longest Strike\\", The New York Times, August 8, 1988 Effects of the strike =Television= The writers' strike forced the major TV networks to hold off the start of their fall 1988 schedule later than usual; rather than the traditional late-September/early- October start, new and returning TV series' debuts were delayed until late October and into November (one NBC series, In the Heat of the Night, and one ABC series, Thirtysomething, did not start their second seasons until early December). In the interim, the networks had to rely on a hodgepodge of programming, including reruns, movies, entertainment and news specials, program-length political advertising, and unscripted original series (e.g. CBS' High Risk). Networks also benefited from sports programming, including NBC, which relied on the Summer Olympics in September and the World Series in October, and ABC, which in addition to its postseason baseball coverage, moved up the start time for the early weeks of Monday Night Football from 9 p.m. ET to 8 p.m. ET (MacGyver, which normally aired at 8 p.m., was not yet ready with new episodes). The 1988‚Äì89 television season was the first of three television seasons to have its start delayed due to issues outside of the control of the major networks; the next two instances occurred in the 2001‚Äì02 season (due to the networks' news coverage of the September 11 attacks) and the 2020‚Äì21 season (due to the suspension of television productions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic). While waiting for their fall seasons to begin, the networks still had access to scripted original series. Despite refusing earlier in the summer to accept new projects from independents who settled with the Guild, TV networks gained a benefit from the Guilds' decision to offer independent contracts to producers, with the offers beginning in late May 1988. The agreements would allow producers and writers of such shows as The Cosby Show, A Different World, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and Late Night with David Letterman to resume work. Johnny Carson actually resumed work on The Tonight Show before the agreement, returning with the Guild's blessing on May 11, 1988 (after Tonight was in reruns since the strike's start) without writers and with his own material; David Letterman would follow suit, returning to Late Night on June 29.news.bbc.co.ukusatoday.com/life The strike also led to a revival of Mission: Impossible; ABC, in search of original content for Fall 1988, used reworked scripts from the original version of M:I and filmed them in Australia (where production costs at the time were lower than that in the Hollywood area), making the new M:I one of the first American commercial network programs to be filmed there. NBC took a similar approach with its new sitcom Dear John, using some reworked episodes that were from the original version that aired on Britain's BBC. CBS revived The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, nearly 20 years after throwing the duo off the air for poor taste, and gave them carte blanche to perform their own existing material. Soap operas continued to air during the strike; however, without experienced script writers many suffered in quality. At first most stories were dragged out for as long as possible, then plots lurched forward that did not leave shows in the best of shape, including \\"Santa Barbara\\", which was already struggling in ratings as a result of Bridget and Jerome Dobson being fired. Saturday morning programming for the 1988‚Äì1989 season was mostly unaffected, as animation writers were not part of the strike; a notable exception was CBS' live-action series Pee-wee's Playhouse, which only had two new episodes and a prime-time Christmas special that season. The animation exemption also led to several animated specials being aired, including a new Peanuts miniseries (This Is America, Charlie Brown) and an adaptation of a Garfield book, Garfield: His 9 Lives. The strike significantly shrunk average television audiences, and had a lasting effect. The strike did not, as some later claimed, lead to the advent of reality television (which did not rise to its current level of popularity until over a decade later), mainly due to the fact that it began in the traditional summer \\"offseason\\" when little new scripted programming was being produced anyway.\\"The ...

One notable exception was COPS on the Fox television network, which was commissioned as the result of a strike and remained on Fox's Saturday night lineup until 2013 before moving to Spike, the current Paramount Network.

Writer Alan B. McElroy had only 11 days in which to come up with the film's story and subsequently write the script. McElroy did just this and managed to turn the script in just hours before the strike commenced.Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers, DVD Feature: Halloween 4 \\"Final Cut\\". Anchor Bay. The 1988 movie Earth Girls Are Easy was filmed during this strike; co-writer Charlie Coffey did not appear in the movie due to being on the picket lines. According to the Ultimate James Bond DVD Collection, the movie Licence to Kill, starring Timothy Dalton, lost one of its co-writers, Richard Maibaum, so his partner Michael G. Wilson elected to finish the screenplay on his own. Sam Hamm turned in his script for 1989's Batman just days before the writer's strike began, and was unable to write further drafts due to his involvement. Director Tim Burton and others liked the script, but thought \\"something\\" was missing. As such he brought in Beetlejuice co-writers Warren Skaaren and Charles McKeown for rewrite work. Jonathan Gems did a few weeks worth of rewriting as well.Salisbury, Burton, p.145 All three were British as just about every single writer in America was on strike. Their draft introduced the Joker's role as the killer of Bruce Wayne's parents, a revelation Burton wanted from the beginning. Hamm, staying true to the source material, had refused to use the idea. One of the primary reasons as to why the filmmakers brought in McKeown was that they felt he could come up with more creative jokes for The Joker.Salisbury, Burton, p.78-80  See also  * International Affiliation of Writers Guilds (IAWG) * WGA screenwriting credit system * WGA script registration service * 1960 Writers Guild of America strike * 1981 Writers Guild of America strike * 2007‚Äì08 Writers Guild of America strike * Residual (entertainment industry) * List of Hollywood strikes References Writers Guild Of America Strike, 1988 Writers Writers Guild of America strike Writers Guild of America strike Strike, 1988 Category:Entertainment industry labor disputes in the United States ","title":"1988 Writers Guild of America strike"},{"id":"14058738","text":"The military history of Uganda begins with actions before the conquest of the country by the British Empire. After the British conquered the country, there were various actions, including in 1887, and independence was granted in 1962. After independence, Uganda was plagued with a series of conflicts, most rooted in the problems caused by colonialism.Postcoloniality and the Postcolony Like many African nations, Uganda endured a series of civil wars and coup d'√©tats. Since the 2000s in particular, the Uganda People's Defence Force has been active in peacekeeping operations for the African Union and the United Nations. Pre-colonial Uganda Depiction of the Bugandan army marching in 1875. The region now known as Uganda is divided linguistically by Lake Kyoga into a Bantu south and Nilotic north. The pastoralist Nilotes of the north were organized by lineage into small clans. While cattle raiding was practiced extensively, the highly decentralized nature of northern societies precluded the possibility of large-scale warfare. By comparison, the introduction of plantain as a staple crop in the south around 1000 AD permitted dense populations to form in the area north of Lake Victoria. One of the early powerful states to emerge was Bunyoro. However, chronic weakness within the structure of Bunyoro resulted in a continual series of civil wars and royal succession disputes. According to legend, a refugee from a Bunyoro conflict, Kimera, became Kabaka of the contemporaneous kingdom of Buganda, on the shores of Lake Victoria.Uganda ‚Äì Library of Congress Country Studies Bagandan governance was based on a stable succession arrangement, allowing the kingdom to more than double in size by the mid-nineteenth century through a series of wars of expansion, becoming the dominant power in the region. As well as a force of infantry, Baganda also maintained a navy of large outrigger canoes, which allowed Baganda commandos to raid any shore on Lake Victoria. Henry Morton Stanley visited in 1875 and reported viewing a military expedition of 125,000 troops marching east, where they were to join an auxiliary naval force of 230 canoes. Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, Uganda began to lose its isolated status, mainly due to traders seeking new sources of ivory after the decimation of elephant herds along the coast. Arab traders from the coast began making trade agreements with the Kabaka of Uganda to provide guns and other items in exchange for a supply of ivory. In the north, Turkish Sudan under Khedive Isma'il Pasha sought to expand its control of the White Nile. In 1869, the khedive sent a force under British explorer Samuel Baker to establish dominion over the upper Nile. Encountering stiff resistance, Baker was forced to turn back after burning the Bunyoro capital to the ground.See Ismailia by Sir Samuel White Baker download, hosted by Project Gutenberg, in particular \\"Chapter XXI: Treachery\\" Depiction of war canoes used by the Kingdom of Buganda, ca. 1875. Foreign influences led to the eventual disruption of royal rule in Buganda. In 1877, the London-based Church Missionary Society sent Protestant missionaries, followed two years later by Catholic France-based White Fathers. The competition for converts in the royal court also included Zanzibar-based Muslim traders. When the new kabaka Mwanga II attempted to outlaw the divisive foreign ideologies (see Uganda Martyrs), he was deposed by armed converts in 1888. A four-year civil war erupted in which the Muslim forces initially declared victory, but were eventually defeated by an alliance of Christian groups. The conclusion of the civil war was also marked by various epidemics of foreign diseases, which halved the population in some localities and further weakened Baganda. The arrival of European colonial interests, in the persons of British captain Frederick Lugard and German Karl Peters, broke the Christian alliance. Protestant missionaries moved to put Uganda under British control, while French Catholics either supported the German claim or urged national independence. In 1892, fighting broke out between the two factions. Momentum remained with the Catholics until Lugard brought Maxim guns into play, resulting in the French Catholic mission being burnt to the ground and the Catholic bishop fleeing. With the support of Protestant Buganda chiefs secured, the British declared a protectorate in 1894 and began expanding its borders with the help of Nubian mercenaries formerly in the employ of the Egyptian khedive. Colonial period (1894‚Äì1962) In spite of the British declaration, actually taking control of the region was a prolonged affair. The British and their Buganda ally engaged in a bloody five-year conflict with Bunyoro, which boasted several regiments of rifle infantry under the firm rule of Kabarega. After defeating and occupying the Bunyoro, the British forces defeated the Acholi and other people of the north. Elsewhere, the Ankole kingdom and chiefdoms of Busoga signed treaties with the British, but the loosely associated kinship groups of the east and northeast resisted until they were finally conquered. The general outline of the modern state of Uganda thus took shape. However, in 1897 the Nubian mercenaries rebelled, resulting in a two-year conflict before they were put down with the help of units of the British Indian Army, transported to Uganda at great cost. The protectorate rewarded Buganda for its support during these wars of expansion by giving it privileged status within the protectorate and awarding it most of the historic heartland of Bunyoro, including the locations of several royal tombs. The Baganda offered their expertise in administration to the colonial rulers, resulting in Ganda administrators running much of the country's affairs in the name of the protectorate. The Banyoro, aggrieved by both the \\"lost counties\\" and arrogance of Baganda administrators, rose up in the 1907 Nyangire \\"Refusing\\" rebellion, which succeeded in removing the irksome Baganda civil servants from Nyoro territory. Two soldiers on Jinja Road, 1936 Despite these tensions, the protectorate was generally stable and prosperous, especially in comparison with Tanganyika, which suffered greatly during the East African Campaign of World War I. This began to change with the British decision to divest itself of its colonial properties and prepare Uganda for independence, embodied in the arrival of Andrew Cohen in 1952 to assume the post of governor. Various groups began to organize themselves in preparation for planned elections, which was given urgency by the announcement that London was considering joining Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika into an East African federation. Many politically aware Ugandans knew that the similar Central African Federation was dominated by white settlers and feared that an East Africa counterpart would be dominated by the racist settlers of the White Highlands in Kenya, where the Mau Mau Uprising was being bitterly fought. In the complete lack of popular confidence in his rule, Cohen was forced to agree to Buganda demands for a continued privileged status in the new constitution. The major dissenters were the Baganda Catholics, which had been marginalized since 1892 and were organized into the Democratic Party (DP) of Benedicto Kiwanuka, and the Uganda People's Congress (UPC), a coalition of non-Baganda groups, determined not to be dictated to by the Baganda, led by Milton Obote. After much political manoeuvering, Uganda entered independence in October 1962 under an alliance of convenience between the UPC and Kabaka Yekka (KY), a Buganda separatist party, against the DP. The Kabaka was named ceremonial head of state, while Obote became prime minister. Early independent Uganda (1963‚Äì1970) Idi Amin pictured in 1966, shortly after he led an attack on the Kabaka's palace and forced Mutesa II of Buganda into exile. In January 1964, several army units rebelled, demanding higher pay and more rapid promotion. Obote was forced to request the assistance of the British military in putting down the revolt, but ultimately caved in to all of the demands. The obvious lack of civilian control of the military resulted in the rapid expansion of the army and its resulting importance in political affairs. Obote also chose a young army officer, Idi Amin Dada, as his personal protege. Later that year, Obote made a deal with several DP ministers in which they would cross the floor to join the UPC if Obote could return the \\"lost counties\\". The kabaka opposed the planned referendum and sent 300 Baganda veterans to Bunyoro to intimidate voters. In response, 3,000 Banyoro soldiers massed on the Bunyoro-Buganda border. Civil war was avoided when the kabaka backed down, allowing the referendum in which the populations of the \\"lost counties\\" overwhelmingly expressed a desire to return to the Bunyoro kingdom. In early 1966, Obote consolidated central power by stripping the monarchs of the five kingdoms of their titles and forced them into exile. The UPC itself fell into disarray in 1966 after it was revealed that Obote and his associates, including Amin, were smuggling arms to a secessionist group in neighboring Congo in return for ivory and gold. Faced with nearly unanimous disapproval, Obote did not take the expected step of stepping down as prime minister, but instead had Amin and the army carry out what was in effect a coup d'√©tat against his own government. After suspending the constitution, arresting dissident UPC ministers and taking the powers of the presidency for his own, he announced the promulgation of a new constitution abolishing the autonomy of the kingdoms guaranteed by the former federal system. When the Baganda protested, now-President Obote sent the army under Amin to attack the palace of the kabaka. The Battle of Mengo Hill resulted in the palace being overrun, with the kabaka barely escaping into exile. With his opponents arrested, in flight, or co-opted, Obote secured his position with the creation of the General Service Unit, a system of secret police staffed mostly with ethnic kinspeople from the Lango region. Nevertheless, Obote narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in December 1969, apparently carried out by Baganda monarchists. In early 1970, the mysterious murder of Acap Okoya, the sole rival to Amin among the senior military officers, led Obote to grow suspicious of Amin. Later that year, Obote escaped another assassination attempt after the attackers mistakenly targeted the car of the vice-president. However, Obote could take no direct action as he was totally reliant upon the army that Amin led to keep him in power. In response, Obote increased the recruitment of ethnic Acholi and Langi to counter the recruitment by Amin of soldiers from his home West Nile sub- region. In October 1970, Obote put Amin under house arrest on charges of increasing military expenditure over budget, as well as continuing to support Sudan's Anyanya rebel group in the civil war against the government of Gaafar Nimeiry, after Obote had decided to switch his support to Nimeiry. Amin was close friends with several Israeli military advisors that were helping to train the army and there is much speculation that they had influenced him to continue supporting the Anyanya, which was also the recipient of Israeli military aid. Under Idi Amin (1971‚Äì1979) Despite protestations by Amin that he remained loyal, Obote decided to rid himself of the perceived threat in January 1971. While leaving on a foreign trip, Obote ordered Langi military officers to arrest Amin and his close supporters. However, word of the plot was leaked to Amin before it could be carried out, prompting Amin to carry out a pre-emptive coup. The successful coup is often cited as an example of \\"action by the military\\", where the Ugandan Armed Forces acted against a government whose politics posed more of a threat to the military privileges. One of the priorities of the new president was mass executions of Acholi and Langi troops, which owed their loyalty to Obote. In July 1971, Lango and Acholi soldiers were massacred in the Jinja and Mbarara Barracks,Sue Lautze, Research on Violent Institutions in Unstable Environments: The livelihoods systems of Ugandan army soldiers and their families in a war zone , Hertford College, Oxford University1 and by early 1972, some 5,000 Acholi and Lango soldiers had disappeared.Obituary: Idi Amin, Daily Telegraph, 17 September 2003. Amin's rule was welcomed by the Baganda, but tens of thousands of Obote supporters fled south into Tanzania. Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere would prove to be a strong opponent of the Amin government, an attitude mirrored by Kenya, South Africa and the Organisation for African Unity, though Israel, Great Britain and the United States were quick to recognize the legitimacy of the Amin government. The old terminal building of Entebbe International Airport (pictured in 1994). The terminal was the site of Israeli hostage- rescue mission in 1976. Bullet holes from the raid were still visible on the building. While the military had grown under Obote, it multiplied in size under Amin, who characterized the government in military terms. He renamed Government House \\"the Command Post\\", placed military tribunals over civil courts, appointed military commanders to head civilian ministries and parastatals, and informed civilian cabinet ministers that they were subject to military law. The commanders of barracks located around the country became the de facto rulers of their regions. Despite the characterization of the country in terms of a military command structure, the administration was far from well-organized. Amin, like many of the officers he appointed to senior positions, was illiterate, and thus gave instructions orally, in person, by telephone or in long rambling speeches. The regime was subject to deadly internal rivalries. One area of competition was a rivalry between British- trained officers and Israeli-trained officers, who both opposed the many untrained officers, resulting in many trained officers being purged. The purges also had the effect of creating promotion opportunities; commander of the air force Smuts Guweddeko began as a telephone operator. Another contest was religious in nature. In order to gain supplies from Libya, in early 1972 Amin expelled the Israeli advisers, who had helped put him in power, and became virulently anti-Zionist. To gain the favor of Saudi Arabia he embraced his Islamic heritage, raising hopes among Ugandan Muslims that their defeat in 1892 would be redressed. Amin deployed soldiers to aid Egypt and provided financial support to the Arab nations during the Yom Kippur War. When Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - External Operations and German Revolutionary Cells (RZ) terrorists hijacked a plane in 1976 and landed it at Entebbe International Airport, Israeli commandos carried out a raid that successfully freed most of the hostages.\\"Entebbe's unsung hero\\", Ynetnews, 2006 Criticism by the Church of Uganda of army abuses would lead to the murder of Archbishop Janani Luwum.

In 1978 he conferred the decoration Conqueror of the British Empire upon himself.\\"Obituary: Idi Amin\\", The Guardian, 2003-08-18. The government all but ceased to function as the constant purges of senior ranks by the increasingly paranoid Amin caused officials to refrain from making any decisions for fear of making the 'wrong' one. =Anti-Amin rebellion and the Ugandan-Tanzanian War= Milton Obote regained power in 1980, after Tanzanian forces aided by the Uganda National Liberation Front defeated Amin's forces in the Ugandan-Tanzanian War. Amin was also preoccupied with the dissident groups that Obote had gathered in exile in Tanzania. In late 1972, a small rebel force crossed the border with the apparent intention of capturing the army outpost at Masaka, but stopped short and instead waited in expectation of a popular uprising to overthrow Amin. The uprising did not materialize and the Obote-aligned force was expelled by the Malire Mechanical Regiment. The event prompted Amin to task the General Service Unit, now renamed the Special Research Bureau, and the newly formed Public Safety Unit with an intensified search for suspected subversives. Thousands of people were disappeared. Amin also retaliated by further purging the army of Obote supporters, predominantly those from the Acholi and Lango ethnic groups.\\"Biography: Idi Amin Dada\\", About.com The political environment became increasingly unstable and paranoia-inducing as the regime continued and Amin's circle of supporters grew smaller and smaller due to the purges and disappearances. In 1978, General Mustafa Adrisi, an Amin supporter, was injured in a suspicious automobile accident and units loyal to him, including the once-loyal Malire Mechanized Regiment, mutinied. Amin sent loyalist units to crush the uprising, causing some of the mutineers to flee south into Tanzania. Amin, seeking to deflect blame and rally the populace, then accused Tanzania's Nyerere of being the cause of the fighting and sent troops across the border to formally annex 700 miles of Tanzania known as the Kagera Salient on 1 November 1978. In response, Nyerere declared a state of war and mobilized the Tanzania People's Defence Force for a full-scale conflict. Within several weeks, the Tanzanian army was expanded from 40,000 to over 100,000 with the addition of police, prison guards, militia and others. They were joined by the various anti-Amin forces, who in March 1979 coalesced into the Uganda National Liberation Front (UNLF). The UNLF was composed of the Obote-led Kikosi Maalum and the Front for National Salvation, led by political newcomer Yoweri Museveni, as well as several smaller anti-Amin groups. The Tanzanian army, with the support of the UNLF, drove the Ugandan forces out of Tanzania and began an invasion of Uganda. The Ugandan army offered little resistance and retreated steadily, spending much of its energies looting the countryside. Libya's Muammar al-Gaddafi sent 3,000 troops to support the Ugandan defense, but these troops found themselves fighting on the front lines, as Ugandan units in the rear commandeered their supply trucks to carry their plunder away. On 11 April 1979, Kampala fell to the invaders and Amin fled into exile, marking the first time in the post-colonial era that an African nation successfully invaded another.\\"Rejoicing and Revenge in Kampala\\", Time, 23 April 1979 Disunity and the Ugandan Bush War (1979‚Äì1986) The lack of cohesion between the various Ugandan groups that formed the UNLF quickly became apparent as president Yusuf Lule was replaced by Godfrey Binaisa, a former minister in the UPC. While the UNLF force that helped overthrow Amin numbered only 1000, in 1979, Museveni and David Oyite-Ojok, a Langi like Obote, began a massive recruitment of soldiers into what were in-effect their personal armies. When Binaisa attempted to stop this rapid military expansion, he was deposed by Museveni, Oyite-Ojok and Obote-stalwart Paulo Muwanga. After Muwanga's rise to power, Obote returned to the country to stand in elections. In an intensely contested and highly compromised election held on December 10, 1980, Obote was re-elected president with Muwanga as his vice-president. In response, Museveni declared armed opposition to Obote's UNLF government. In 1980, Museveni merged his Popular Resistance Army (PRA) with Lule's Uganda Freedom Fighters, forming the National Resistance Army (NRA). As well as the NRA, two rebel groups based in Amin's home West Nile sub-region emerged: the Uganda National Rescue Front and the Former Uganda National Army.\\"Causes and consequences of the war in Acholiland\\", Ogenga Otunnu, from Lucima et al., 2002 The beginning of the Ugandan Bush War was marked by an NRA attack in the central Mubende District on 6 February 1981. The NRA insurgency was based largely in the anti-Obote strongholds of central and western Buganda and the former kingdoms of Ankole and Bunyoro.\\"A Country Study: The Second Obote Regime: 1981‚Äì85\\", Library of Congress Country Studies Fighting was particularly intense in the Luwero triangle of Buganda, where the bitter memory of the counterinsurgency efforts of the UNLF's Langi and Acholi soldiers against the populace would prove an enduring legacy. The NRA was highly organized, forming Resistance Councils in areas they controlled to funnel recruits and supplies into the war effort. In comparison, the inability of the UNLF government to defeat the rebels both in the west and West Nile proved devastating to the unity of the government, while the brutality of the counter-insurgency further inflamed anti-Obote sentiment in the occupied areas. Following the death of General Oyite-Ojok in a helicopter crash at the end of 1983, the Acholi-Langi alliance began to fracture. On 27 January 1985, Acholi troops under Brigadier Bazilio Olara-Okello staged a successful coup and put fellow Acholi General Tito Okello into the presidency as Obote once again fled into exile, this time for good. The Okello government had little policy besides self-preservation. After an Okello-Museveni peace agreement broke down, the NRA began a final offensive and entered Kampala in January 1986 as the Acholi troops fled north to their homeland. Yoweri Museveni declared the presidency on January 29, 1986. Estimates for the death toll for the 1981-5 period, which includes the Bush War, conflict in West Nile and internecine UNLF purges and fighting, range as high as 500,000. Under Museveni (1986-ongoing) =Internal conflicts= Northern Uganda A soldier in an internally displaced persons camp in northern Uganda in 2003. Northern Uganda saw a number of displaced civilians due to civil conflict in Uganda, as well as civil war in neighbouring Sudan. The new NRA government's occupation of the north was challenged by rebel groups formed among the former supporters of Obote. The Acholi coalesced into the Uganda People's Democratic Army (UPDA), largely composed of former army soldiers, in 1986 while a series of perceived outrages prompted the formation the following year of the similarly comprised Uganda People's Army (UPA) by the Iteso, who were closely allied with the Langi. Both the Acholi and Iteso were subject to a devastating series of cattle raids by Karamojong along their western border, which resulted in loss of much of the region's wealth. The UPA rebellion reached a height of intensity in the late 1980s, before a settlement was negotiated in 1992. The UPDA rebellion also soon faltered and resulted in a peace accord in 1988. However, the situation in Acholiland was compounded after spirit medium Alice Auma declared divinely inspired leadership of a Holy Spirit Movement to retake the capital and initiate a heaven on earth. While Auma's force was defeated in the forests near Kampala in August 1987, its relative success inspired Joseph Kony, also a self-proclaimed spirit medium, and a relative of Auma's, to form a new group that would come to be known as the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). One of Africa's longest-running military conflicts, the hostilities between the Ugandan military, renamed the Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF) following the promulgation of the new 1995 uganda constitution, and the insurgent LRA have been ongoing since 1987. In September 2006 a ceasefire was declared after peace talks. The LRA is accused of widespread human rights violations, including mutilation, torture, rape, the abduction of civilians, the use of child soldiers and a number of massacres. Operating in a vast swathe of northern Uganda, southern Sudan and the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the LRA has, at various times, caused the displacement of the majority of civilians in its areas of operations with the support of militias allied with the Sudanese government in its own civil war. West Nile The situation in West Nile, located in the northwestern corner of the country, also remained fluid. While many members of the Uganda National Rescue Front, formed by Amin supporters to oppose Obote, were integrated into the new NRA military, some joined the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF), formed by Juma Oris in 1986 to oppose the NRA government. The WNBF was, like the LRA, highly active along the porous Uganda-Sudan border until a counterinsurgency operation focused on civil-military cooperation was initiated by Major General Katumba Wamala in 1996, which, coupled with Ugandan-backed Sudan People's Liberation Army attacks upon the WNBF's rear areas in Sudan, resulted in the WNBF dwindling into obscurity by 1998. However, some rebels instead formed the Uganda National Rescue Front II, which operated with Sudanese support in Aringa County, Arua District, until it signed a formal ceasefire in 2002. Western Uganda In contrast to the endemic insecurity in West Nile and northern Uganda that continued well past the NRA's rise to power, much of the rest of the country remained stable and relatively peaceful. The one exception has been the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a rebel group formed in 1996 by puritanical Muslim Ugandans of the Tablighi Jamaat sect after a merger with the remnants of the rebel National Army for the Liberation of Uganda. The ADF based themselves in the Ruwenzori Range along Uganda's western border with the DRC and by 1998 had carried out attacks on civilians that resulted in tens of thousands of internally displaced persons, as well as thrown bomb attacks on restaurants and markets in Kampala and other towns. By 1999, military pressure by the UPDF forced the ADF into small uncoordinated bands. In December 2005, the Congolese government and United Nations mission carried out a military operation to finally destroy ADF bases in the DRC's Ituri Province. =External conflicts= Great Lakes region outflow of refugees after the Rwandan Civil War eventually led to the First Congo War. During his rebellion, Museveni recruited heavily from the Rwandan refugees located in the southwest of the country; of the 27 original members of the NRA, two were Tutsi refugees: Fred Rwigyema and Paul Kagame. Tutsi refugees formed a disproportionately large number of officers in the NRA for the simple reason that they joined early and had accumulated more experience. After his 1986 victory, Museveni rewarded their long service by appointing Rwigyema to the second-highest military post and Kagame to the post of acting head of military intelligence. Many Tutsi veterans were also members of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which was initially created as an intellectual forum. However, a nativist backlash resulted in the refugees feeling increasingly unwelcome. On 1 October 1990, the RPF invaded Rwanda, stating that they were fighting for a just government and the right to return, thus beginning the Rwandan Civil War. With the initial offensive repulsed, the RPF retrenched for a long guerrilla struggle. Museveni would later tacitly admit that he had not been consulted prior to the invasion but, faced with the choice of offering aid and sanctuary to his old comrades in the RPF or watching them defeated along Uganda's southern burden, chose to offer assistance. Rom√©o Dallaire, the head of United Nations Observer Mission Uganda-Rwanda (1993‚Äì1994), would later complain of the substantial restrictions the Ugandan government put on his efforts to discover military supplies surreptitiously transported to RPF-held areas in northern Rwanda.Rom√©o Dallaire, Shake Hands with the Devil, Carroll & Graf: New York, 2003, , pp. 93‚Äì96 The start of the Rwandan genocide in April 1994 reignited the civil war between the RPF and Rwandan government. The victory of the RPF in August 1994 prompted a massive outflow of refugees into neighboring countries, in particular Zaire. Zairean president Mobutu Sese Seko had been a strong supporter of the Hutu government of Rwanda, as well as having given Obote military aid in the Ugandan Bush War, and the refugee camps in Zaire quickly became militarized by Hutu insurgents and ex-Rwandan Armed Forces. In 1996, Rwanda sponsored the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Zaire (AFDL), led by Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila, with the support of Uganda. The first task of the AFDL was to break up the large refugee camps, after which it marched to Kinshasa, overthrew Mobutu and put Kabila into the presidency in 1997.\\"Explaining Ugandan intervention in Congo: evidence and interpretations\\", John F. Clark, The Journal of Modern African Studies, Vol. 39, pp. 267‚Äì268, 2001 (Cambridge Journals) Kabila renamed the country the \\"Democratic Republic of the Congo\\" (DRC). (See First Congo War.) Territory held by combatant during the Second Congo War, in 2003 Kabila attempted to sever his connections with his Rwandan backers in 1998, resulting in the deadliest conflict since World War II, which drew in eight nations and many more armed groups. Museveni apparently persuaded an initially reluctant High Command to go along with the venture. \\"We felt that the Rwandese started the war and it was their duty to go ahead and finish the job, but our President took time and convinced us that we had a stake in what is going on in Congo\\", one senior officer is reported as saying.Uganda and Rwanda: friends or enemies? , International Crisis Group, Africa Report No. 14, 4 May 2000 The official reasons Uganda gave for the intervention were to stop a \\"genocide\\" against the Banyamulenge in DRC in concert with Rwandan forces,New Vision, 26 and 28 August 1998 and that Kabila had failed to provide security along the border and was allowing the ADF to attack Uganda from rear bases in the DRC. In reality, the UPDF were not deployed in the border region but more than 1,000 kilometres (over 600 miles) to the west of Uganda's frontier with Congo\\"L'Ouganda et les guerres Congolaises\\", Politique Africaine, 75: 43‚Äì59, 1999 in support of the Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC), a Uganda- backed group formed in September 1998. The lack of Ugandan security forces in the border region allowed the ADF to successfully attack Fort Portal, a large western town, and capture a prison. The war ended in 2003 with the removal of foreign troops and the country's first election. Similar to many other African nations involved, the war has created several problems for Uganda. In 2000 the United States Military suspended the UPDF cooperation in the African Crisis Response Initiative until 2003. Several officers in the Ugandan Army have come under attack for their actions during the war.\\"Uganda army chief 'lied' over Congo\\", BBC News, 21 May 2002 The Ituri Conflict is an ongoing conflict between Lendu and Hema ethnic groups in the Ituri region.

Simrock is most noted for publishing most of the music of Johannes Brahms and Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k.

Simrock generally paid Brahms well for his music,David Brodbeck, Brahms: Symphony No. 1 New York: Cambridge University Press (1997): 28. \\"In his next letter, dated 25 April [1877], Simrock readily agreed to Brahms's request for the princely sum of 5,000 Talers (15,000 [Deutsche] Marks).\\" but with Dvo≈ô√°k he was often unwilling to publish orchestral pieces, for example, his Eighth Symphony.Dvo≈ô√°k Cello Concerto By Jan Smaczny, page 11 Cambridge University Press, 1999. Simrock was so involved in the lives of prominent musicians that Joseph Joachim came to believe that his wife Amalie was cheating on him with Simrock, and Brahms wrote a famous \\"lengthy letter\\" in support of Amalie's innocence, which \\"was cited in evidence at the [Joachims'] divorce proceedings.\\"Robert Anderson. \\"Brahms in Brief\\". The Musical Times, summer (1998): 69. The divorce was not granted. Per Brahms' advice, Simrock took a chance with the young Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k. After publishing only a few of Dvo≈ô√°k's works, his risk paid off‚ÄîDvo≈ô√°k quickly became one of the most popular composers in Europe. Simrock thus came to be the primary publisher of Dvo≈ô√°k's music for much of the composer's career, but their relationship was at times strained for a number of reasons. Among these were Simrock's stubborn insistence that Dvo≈ô√°k produce more light-hearted, miniature works (such as his wildly popular and extremely commercially successful Slavonic Dances, Op. 46) when the composer expressed desires to compose more large-scale orchestral works, which Simrock claimed didn't sell. Also, Simrock often confounded Dvo≈ô√°k with his blatantly anti-Czech sentiments, which were popular with ethnic Germans in the Habsburg Empire at the time. Dvo≈ô√°k, for his part, maintained his musical and moral integrity, responding calmly to Simrock's nationalistically tinged letters and admonishing him for trying to force his musical process, stating in a letter to the publisher regarding a second set of Slavonic Dances: \\"as long as I am not in the mood for it, I can do nothing.\\"Siepmann, Jeremy, and Sean Barrett. Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k. S.l: Naxos, 2004. However, as Dvo≈ô√°k's popularity grew, he began to receive commissions for large-scale works from other publishers, notably Novello & Co. in England, which looked increasingly tempting to the composer despite his long-term oral contract with Simrock specifying that Simrock would be his sole publisher. Despite this contract, Dvo≈ô√°k began to accept the commissions from Novello & Co, for which Simrock threatened, but did not follow through on, legal action.

Formed in elevated limestone rock, the system extends to of surveyed passage, on two levels. It is the 7th-longest cave system in the Republic of Ireland, and the 10th-longest in the whole of Ireland.  History of exploration  While the Geological Survey of Ireland in 1859 acknowledged the presence of \\"caves worn by water, some of which can be traversed for some distance,\\" cited in positive efforts at exploration were not made until 1981, when the upper part of the cave was explored to a sump, named the \\"Green Lake\\". When hydrological testing of water both in the cave's active streamway and in the sump showed that the two were chemically distinct from each other, it was postulated that the sump was only \\"perched\\" above the water table and that further dry passage might be found on the far side. The sump was dived by Martyn Farr in 1983, providing the first access to the large caverns beyond. A boulder obstruction nearby was passed, allowing a dry connection into the new chambers. Following the breakthrough, of passage was explored and surveyed. Between 1981 and 1985, further exploration and surveying brought the total length of the cave to , with a vertical range of approximately . The entire cave system runs under Castleisland itself, starting at Glounsharoon and ending on the far side of town at the Killarney Road.  Show cave  Around of the Crag Cave system was developed as a show cave by local residents Dr. Donal and Mrs Margaret Geaney, under whose land the cave was first discovered. The cave was developed between 1987 and 1989 by building a shaft (which is the only man-made entrance) and putting in pathways, railings, lights and a music system. Crag Cave attracts thousands of visitors every year. Tourists are given a guided tour of the cave which takes a half an hour. There are many chambers in the cave, including the Cathedral and the Crystal Gallery. Many of the features in the cave have been named after locations or characters from J.R.R.

This gene encodes a DNA topoisomerase, an enzyme that controls and alters the topologic states of DNA during transcription. This nuclear enzyme is involved in processes such as chromosome condensation, chromatid separation, and the relief of torsional stress that occurs during DNA transcription and replication. It catalyzes the transient breaking and rejoining of two strands of duplex DNA which allows the strands to pass through one another, thus altering the topology of DNA. Two forms of this enzyme exist as likely products of a gene duplication event. The gene encoding this form, alpha, is localized to chromosome 17 and the beta gene is localized to chromosome 3. The gene encoding this enzyme functions as the target for several anticancer agents and a variety of mutations in this gene have been associated with the development of drug resistance.

PPARGC1A is also known as human accelerated region 20 (HAR20). It may, therefore, have played a key role in differentiating humans from apes. PGC-1Œ± is the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. PGC-1Œ± is also the primary regulator of liver gluconeogenesis, inducing increased gene expression for gluconeogeneis.  Function  PGC-1Œ± is a transcriptional coactivator that regulates the genes involved in energy metabolism. It is the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. This protein interacts with the nuclear receptor PPAR-Œ≥, which permits the interaction of this protein with multiple transcription factors. This protein can interact with, and regulate the activities of, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and nuclear respiratory factors (NRFs) . It provides a direct link between external physiological stimuli and the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, and is a major factor causing slow- twitch rather than fast-twitch muscle fiber types. Endurance exercise has been shown to activate the PGC-1Œ± gene in human skeletal muscle. Exercise-induced PGC-1Œ± in skeletal muscle increases autophagy and unfolded protein response. PGC-1Œ± protein may be also involved in controlling blood pressure, regulating cellular cholesterol homoeostasis, and the development of obesity.  Regulation  PGC-1Œ± is thought to be a master integrator of external signals. It is known to be activated by a host of factors, including: # Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), both formed endogenously in the cell as by-products of metabolism but upregulated during times of cellular stress. # It is strongly induced by cold exposure, linking this environmental stimulus to adaptive thermogenesis. # It is induced by endurance exercise and recent research has shown that PGC-1Œ± determines lactate metabolism, thus preventing high lactate levels in endurance athletes and making lactate as an energy source more efficient. # cAMP response element-binding (CREB) proteins, activated by an increase in cAMP following external cellular signals. # Protein kinase B / Akt is thought to downregulate PGC-1Œ±, but upregulate its downstream effectors, NRF1 and NRF2. Akt itself is activated by PIP3, often upregulated by PI3K after G-protein signals. The Akt family is also known to activate pro-survival signals as well as metabolic activation. # SIRT1 binds and activates PGC-1Œ± through deacetylation inducing gluconeogenesis without affecting mitochondrial biogenesis. PGC-1Œ± has been shown to exert positive feedback circuits on some of its upstream regulators: # PGC-1Œ± increases Akt (PKB) and Phospho-Akt (Ser 473 and Thr 308) levels in muscle. # PGC-1Œ± leads to calcineurin activation. Akt and calcineurin are both activators of NF kappa B (p65). Through their activation PGC-1Œ± seems to activate NF kappa B. Increased activity of NF kappa B in muscle has recently been demonstrated following induction of PGC-1Œ±. The finding seems to be controversial. Other groups found that PGC-1s inhibit NF kappa B activity. The effect was demonstrated for PGC-1 alpha and beta. PGC-1Œ± has also been shown to drive NAD biosynthesis to play a large role in renal protection in Acute Kidney Injury.  Clinical significance  Recently PPARGC1A has been implicated as a potential therapy for Parkinson's disease conferring protective effects on mitochondrial metabolism. Moreover, brain-specific isoforms of PGC-1alpha have recently been identified which are likely to play a role in other neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Massage therapy appears to increase the amount of PGC-1Œ± which leads to the production of new mitochondria. PGC-1Œ± and beta has furthermore been implicated in polarization to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages by interaction with PPARŒ≥ with upstream activation of STAT6. An independent study confirmed the effect of PGC-1 on polarisation of macrophages towards M2 via STAT6/PPAR gamma and furthermore demonstrated that PGC-1 inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production. PGC-1Œ± has been recently proposed to be responsible for Œ≤-aminoisobutyric acid secretion by exercising muscles. The effect of Œ≤-aminoisobutyric acid in white fat includes the activation of thermogenic genes that prompt the browning of white adipose tissue and the consequent increase of background metabolism. Hence, the Œ≤-aminoisobutyric acid could act as a messenger molecule of PGC-1Œ± and explain the effects of PGC-1Œ± increase in other tissues such as white fat.  Interactions  PPARGC1A has been shown to interact with: * CREB-binding protein * Farnesoid X receptor * FBXW7 * MED1 MED12 MED14 MED17 * NRF1 * Estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRŒ±), Estrogen-related receptor beta (ERRŒ≤), Estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRŒ≥). * Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma * Retinoid X receptor alpha. * Thyroid hormone receptor beta ERRalpha and PGC-1Œ± are coactivators of both Glucokinase (GK) and SIRT3, binding to an ERRE elements in the GK and SIRT3 promoters.

Born to a family of farmers, his parents were Felipe P√©rez and Rosa Manosalbas. He died while in exile in Paris on August 5, 1900 at the age of 70.Arismendi Posada, Ignacio; Gobernantes Colombianos; trans. Colombian Presidents; Interprint Editors Ltd.; Italgraf; Segunda Edici√≥n; Page 100; Bogot√°, Colombia; 1983 He was buried in the Batignolles Cemetery in Paris and there he rested until 1952, when his remains were repatriated and buried in the Central Cemetery of Bogot√°. Early life The P√©rez de Manosalbas was not a family of means, and Santiago and his brother Felipe P√©rez went to the local public school in Zipaquir√°, but they excelled beyond their teachers‚Äô expectations. When the Director of Public Instruction Lorenzo Mar√≠a Lleras went to Zipaquir√° to visit the school, he was impressed by Santiago and Felipe‚Äôs talent and potential. Lleras decided to help them and took them with him to Our Lady of the Rosary University, where he was the rector. He later took them to the ‚ÄúColegio del Esp√≠ritu Santo‚Äù, a higher education school, which Lleras had founded. There, P√©rez studied jurisprudence and on May 23, 1830, he received his Law degree, although he never professed this occupation, as he was a man of letters and politics. Private life P√©rez was married to Tadea Triana Silva; together they had four children, Santiago, Paulina, Eduardo and Amelia. Amelia married Cl√≠maco Calder√≥n, future President of Colombia. Eduardo became a diplomat. Santiago followed in his fathers footsteps, becoming a writer, politician, diplomat, and journalist. Career as an educator P√©rez started his true calling as an educator working as a teacher in Spanish and Spanish literature while studying law in the Colegio del Esp√≠ritu Santo. In 1857 together with his brother Felipe, they established the Colegio P√©rez Hermanos, a learning institution that taught such people as the linguist Rufino Jos√© Cuervo. During the second administration of president Manuel Murillo Toro he was appointed Director of Public Instruction while also working as rector of the National University of Colombia. In his prominent role as Director of Public Instruction he fomented education and the construction of new schools. Comisi√≥n Corogr√°fica In 1852 P√©rez joined the Comisi√≥n Corogr√°fica, a state funded expedition led by Agustin Codazzi whose goal was to map out the entire country and collect information on its inhabitants. P√©rez worked as secretary of the expedition, replacing Manuel Anc√≠zar, who had fallen ill along the trip. His mission was to record events, places, descriptions, statistics, and other valuable information of the places they went to. During his time in the commission, he traveled to Neiva, Mariquita, Choc√≥, Casanare, Bogot√°, and the territory of the Caquet√°. He published his studies in the newspaper El Neo-Granadino, and wrote a memoir on the expedition entitled Apuntes de un viajero por Antioquia y el sur de la Nueva Granada.  Political career  P√©rez was elected MP and assisted to congress in several legislatures. In 1869, between June 23‚Äì30, he acted as interim president during the government of General Santos Guti√©rrez.Arismendi Posada, Ignacio; Gobernantes Colombianos; trans.

P√©rez, being considered an educator rather than a politician, chose education as his highest priority. He strengthened training facilities for teachers, ordered the construction of various primary schools, and consolidated the National University of Colombia.

It is based on a US novel by Evan Keliher. Made in Canada, most of the cast is obscure and in many cases uncredited. Plot The film starts as high school students return from spring break. Also, the new principal Edwin Swimper arrives after the last principal died from the stress the school gave him. With teachers teaching empty classes, a constant gang war in the hallway and male teachers wearing various armors, Swimper decides to implement an alternative school policy. As a result, classes such as math are abandoned in favor of classes such as archery. The hallways soon turn into archery ranges. When the gang leader Calvin burns down his office, Swimper abandons his plans and quits on the spot. The city council gives the teachers one more chance to find a new principal or else the teachers will lose their job as the school would turn into a profitable parking lot. The only candidate is Peckham. When he says he just returned from a long tenure in an African high school and is not up to date with inner city high schools in the west, the vice principal Relic hires him on the spot. In his first day, Packham is amazed to learn the true nature of the school and is especially determined to re-establish the library from its current form of smoke-filled room with no books. However, a gang gun fight in the hallway causes Peckham to lose his consciousness. Relic and another teacher hide him in the janitor's room but he is gone when they return to check on him. Relic assembles the teachers and they decide to hire Sgt. Major, a bearded man with an overcoat and a poodle for a tracking dog. The dog points to the men's toilets. Relic alone is willing to enter it. Once inside, a doorman asks him for a membership card. It is revealed Calvin used the money from the PTA (that never reached Relic's hands) to start a health club in the school's toilets. Relic ends up joining Calvin and his gang in the jacuzzi and shares their weed. The city council sends inspectors to rush the fate of the school. Knowing they will never pass, Relic goes back to the toilets/health club to make a deal with Calvin. Three inspectors arrive, one of whom is none other than the returning Edwin Swimper. Although they disapprove the illegality of the chained gates, once inside the school everything looks perfect. Students march in the hallways, the health club is now a fully equipped gym and the library is full of books and even video and audio tapes. Only the cafeteria was not renovated as according to Clavin it belongs to a rival gang. Calvin finds a way to trick the rival gang into a zoo truck, but he needs time. Therefore, Relic distracts the inspectors by taking them to inspect the guidance counselor Ms. Simpson. After she completely fails to help a female student, she suddenly notices Swimper. Mistaking him for her former lover, she runs over and throws herself all over him. Relic uses this chance to discredit him in the eyes of the other inspectors. Swimper claims he has never seen her in his life, but it is too late. The inspectors and Relic leave him behind while she touches his lower regions and tries to force herself on him. After she pulls him down to the floor, Swimper is seen running away from school with her chasing him in the street and shouting for him for the remainder of the movie. With Swimper and Calvin's rival gang both out of the way, the cafeteria is turned into a fully fledged restaurant. Waiters take orders from the remaining inspectors and unbeknownst to them order themselves from a real restaurant. Taking no chances, they also inject drugs in the food. With the city council outside ready with a construction crew, the inspectors are high enough to pass the school and thus abolish the city council's plan. Relic lives up to his part of the deal and lets Calvin's ever present gang finally graduate, even with good enough grades to get in a good college. Before Calvin leaves, he introduces to Relic his freshman little brother. The brother immediately blows up Relic's room with dynamite.

This domed ceiling is decorated with special decorative and constructing designs with plaster (Rasmibandi), and around this dome are beautiful decorations (Moaghali) that are a kind of Islamic decoration done by small tiles among bricks. From inside the vestibule we can access a small room that is used as a store room. In the south side of the courtyard lies a prayer hall whose roof comprises twenty domes with twelve columns, each made of a single piece of stone. These supporting columns are carved in a spinning form (pichi). On the top of the columns there are capitals, each elaborately made of a single piece of stone and engraved in the form of steps. The domes which are present on the roof of the prayer hall are decorated with picturesque decorations (Rasmibandi), some of which are special decorations (Moaghali). The Rostrum (a high, staired seat from which a mullah gives his sermon) is located in the middle of the south side of the prayer hall that is decorated with colored tile work. The tiles which are used in the rostrum are colored light brown, azure tile and white, separated from each other with black lines. The chambers of the mosque were places for teaching seminary students.

Nansouty began his military career in 1785, as a sub-lieutenant in the regiment Bourgogne-Infanterie, where his father had served during the wars of Louis XV. A cavalry officer at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792, Nansouty was commissioned as an aide-de-camp to Marshal Nicolas Luckner. During the First Coalition, he saw service as a lieutenant-colonel and squadron commander in the 9th (heavy) Cavalry Regiment, campaigning with the French armies on the Rhine and in Germany. Promoted to Colonel in 1793 and given the command of the 9th Cavalry, he was noted for several well-led cavalry actions. Finally made a Brigadier General in 1799, after he had refused the promotion several times in the past, Nansouty fought the next year under General Jean Victor Moreau in southern Germany, in a decisive campaign of the Second Coalition. Promoted to the top military rank of General of Division in 1803, Nansouty was called to the command of the 1st Heavy Cavalry Division in Emperor Napoleon I's newly created Grande Arm√©e. Commanding this division from 1804 to 1809, Nansouty was present at some of the most significant battles of the Third, Fourth and Fifth coalitions, leading cavalry actions at the battles of Austerlitz, Friedland, Eckm√ºhl, Aspern-Essling and Wagram. In 1812, during the campaign in Russia, Nansouty commanded the I Cavalry Corps, which he led with distinction at such battles as Ostrovno and Borodino, where he received a severe knee wound. The next year, he commanded the Imperial Guard cavalry, which he led at Dresden, Leipzig and Hanau, where he was again wounded. In 1814 he led his men in several engagements, including La Rothi√®re, Montmirail, Vauchamps and Craonne until his incapacitation from wounds that year. A member of the military elite of the First French Empire and a recipient of the Grand Aigle de la L√©gion d'Honneur, Comte de Nansouty was a member of the Military Household of the Emperor as First Squire of the Emperor, and also held the position of Colonel-General of Dragoons. During the Bourbon Restoration, Louis XVIII awarded him additional honours and commands, including one in the Military Household of the King of France. Nansouty died in February 1815 and is buried at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. His name is inscribed on the Arc de Triomphe and a street in the 14th arrondissement of Paris is named after him. Early life √âtienne de Nansouty was born on 30 May 1768 in Bordeaux. His father had served France for fifty years in Louis XV's wars of the Polish Succession and Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War, and had subsequently been appointed \\"major\\" (commander) of the Ch√¢teau-Trompette fortress in Bordeaux. Typically for a member of the minor nobility of the Ancien R√©gime, young √âtienne de Nansouty chose to follow his father's footsteps in the military.Thoumas, p. 4. He was admitted at the military school of Brienne-le-Ch√¢teau in 1779, aged ten, where he was noted for being a well-behaved and assiduous student. On 21 October 1782, he transferred to the √âcole Militaire in Paris,Courcelles, p. 140. where he obtained excellent grades. Two years later, Nansouty became a Chevalier (Knight) of the Order Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel and had the honour of being decorated by Monsieur, the future King Louis XVIII, in person. Upon his graduation on 30 May 1783, he was appointed sub-lieutenant and, on 26 May 1785, Nansouty was sent to the Bourgogne-Infanterie regiment, where his father had served with distinction. A modern photo of the √âcole Militaire in Paris. As a young cadet, Nansouty studied there, before becoming a junior officer in 1783. Throughout his childhood and youth, the Nansouty family led a tranquil yet modest life in Bordeaux, where his father held the position of commander of Ch√¢teau-Trompette, in which he lived with his family, additionally receiving a pension of 1000 livres. He was still holding the position as commander when he died suddenly in 1785, after more than 60 years of active service. His widow had no revenue with which to raise their son and two daughters. However, influential people such as the Duchess of Brancas and the wife of Marshal Beauvau contacted the Minister of War, Marshal de S√©gur, regarding the situation of the young Nansouty. As a result, in 1788, Nansouty was named interim captain in the light cavalry Franche-Comt√© Cavalerie Regiment (later rebaptised 4th Chasseurs √† Cheval). He was soon transferred to the Lauzun Hussar Regiment (which became the 6th Hussars in 1791, then the 5th Hussars in 1793). In 1791, Nansouty then left the regiment to fill two consecutive military staff positions, first as deputy aid to Adjutant General Poncet de la Cour Maupas in the Army of the Centre on 20 December, then as aide-de-camp of Marshal Luckner at the beginning of 1792. He was then promoted to lieutenant-colonel and took up the command of a squadron of the 2nd Chasseurs √† Cheval (on 5 March), before being transferred to the command of a squadron of the 9th Cavalry Regiment on 4 April, a regiment in which he would serve for the next seven and a half years.Thoumas, p. 5 Revolutionary Wars =War of the First Coalition= Officer in the 9th Cavalry A portrait of General Adam Philippe de Custine by Joseph-D√©sir√© Court. Nansouty saw military action for the first time as a young lieutenant-colonel of the 9th Cavalry Regiment, in Custine's Corps of the \\"Army of the Rhine\\". As the French Revolutionary Wars broke out, Nansouty soon found himself in the position of having to take provisional command of the whole 9th Cavalry Regiment, as he was the most senior chef d'escadron (Lieutenant-Colonel) of the regiment when the commander, Colonel Badda de Bodosalva, fell ill at the end of May 1792. His regiment was a part of the \\"Army of the Rhine\\" and was integrated in General Custine's Corps, which was to march towards the Palatinate, where the first military manoeuvres took place. As Colonel Badda de Bodosalva died at the end of October that year, Nansouty naturally expected to be appointed commander of the regiment in his place. However, Custine appointed the more senior Lieutenant-Colonel Loubat de Bohan as commander of the 9th Cavalry and, despite Nansouty's protestations, maintained his decision. With Loubat in command, the 9th saw action against the Prussians in an engagement at Ober- Fl√∂rsheim on 30 March 1793. After a first successful charge, Nansouty's 1st squadron was counter-charged by enemy hussars; the remaining squadrons under Loubat quickly caught up with Nansouty's squadron and together they broke the enemy. Corps commander Custine was then called up to command the Army of the North but, before leaving his command, he attempted a last daunting move against the Habsburg army. This required a night march, not usually undertaken by cavalry, and poorly coordinated manoeuvres of cavalry, infantry and artillery. This led to total failure of the action of 17 May. During this action, though, the initial charge of the corps cavalry, which included the 9th, successfully took a number of enemy guns. However, a Habsburg counter- charge forced them back in disorder, which spread panic among the ranks of oncoming infantry.Thoumas, pp. 6‚Äì7 Despite this setback, a few days later, Lobat de Bohan was promoted to the rank of General and Nansouty again took provisional command of the regiment. When General Alexandre de Beauharnais took command of the Army of the Rhine, he directed his troops towards Mainz. Some fighting took place near Landau and the 9th Cavalry charged several times. Just after this event, the commander of the 2nd Squadron of the regiment invoked the provision of an equivocal new law, demanding that he be given command of the regiment instead of Nansouty. His request was rejected and Nansouty's provisional command was confirmed. Commander of the 9th Cavalry Now holding the rank of chef de brigade (colonel) in command of the 9th Cavalry Regiment, Nansouty took part in several successful cavalry skirmishes around Strasbourg in November and December 1793. He then participated to the Battle of Geisberg, at the end of December. Following this battle, General of Division Donnadieu, who had commanded the cavalry division of which Nansouty's regiment was a part, was tried and executed for alleged cowardice in front of the enemy. Nansouty was not involved in the incident.Thoumas, p. 8. Furthermore, despite being a member of the Ancien R√©gime nobility, he was not harassed at any time during the radical phase of the French Revolution.Thoumas, p. 9. A French Revolutionary heavy cavalryman in 1795. Nansouty was in command of the 9th Cavalry from 1793 to 1799. During the campaigns of 1794, war continued in the Rhineland, with General Louis Desaix pushing back the Coalition forces. Nansouty's 9th Cavalry was brigaded together with the 17th Dragoon Regiment, with General Delmas de La Coste as commander. The brigade performed well against Austrian cavalry in two distinct actions at the end of May of that year. General of Division Michaud, the commander-in-chief of France's Army of the Rhine, noted in his report that Delmas's two regiments showed bravery and intrepidity every time they faced the enemy. In July, the 9th Cavalry was involved in several well-led cavalry actions and Nansouty acquired an excellent reputation, recognised as a disciplinarian and a commander who knew how to drill his men effectively.Thoumas, pp. 9‚Äì10. Beginning in December 1794, the French forces on the Rhine experienced a difficult period, marked by General Charles Pichegru's inability to take Mainz. General Jean Victor Marie Moreau replaced him as commander-in-chief. Moreau reorganised the army into three corps, plus a reserve, of which the 9th Cavalry was a part. The Reserve Cavalry, under Bourcier, intervened at the Battle of Ettlingen, with two squadrons of the 9th being committed and behaving most honourably.Thoumas, p. 10. The next significant moment of this campaign was the incident that occurred at dawn on 11 August 1796, while Nansouty and his men were temporarily attached to the \\"Corps of the Centre\\", under General Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr. Gouvion Saint-Cyr's cavalry exhausted after several days of continuous marching, it was decided that a squadron of the fresher Carabiniers-√†-Cheval would be posted as sentry, an unusual duty for such an elite heavy cavalry unit. At daybreak, as the Battle of Neresheim opened, Austrian cavalry charged the carabiniers, stunning the unprepared cavalrymen, who fled in panic. Their precipitate flight spread alarm among the ranks of the other cavalry regiments, who were used to seeing the Carabiniers-√†-Cheval triumph against the enemy on every occasion. Nansouty did his best to stop the rout of the cavalrymen and to reorganise the other panic-stricken regiments, but the morale of the cavalrymen remained very low throughout the day and Nansouty was forced to give ground in front of the enemy rather than attempt a risky charge with his demoralised troops. This elicited criticism from the Corps commander, General Gouvion Saint-Cyr, who sent his aide-de-camp to Nansouty with orders to charge, which the latter did after taking the necessary time to deploy his men. Under his direction, the four cavalry regiments (2nd and 20th Chasseurs √† Cheval and 2nd and 9th Cavalry Regiments), executed a superb charge, which halted the advance of the Austrian first infantry line. The next day, Archduke Charles of Austria retreated from the field.Thoumas, pp. 11‚Äì14 Nansouty's 9th Cavalry had numerous other opportunities to shine during the campaign of 1796 and rose to the occasion every time.Thoumas, p. 14. He became very fond of his regiment and refused the promotion to brigadier general several times, preferring to remain colonel of the 9th cavalry.Courcelles, p. 141. =War of the Second Coalition= The seasoned General of Division Jean-Joseph d'Hautpoul, Nansouty's direct commander in 1799 The signature of the Treaty of Campo Formio in October 1797 marked the end of the War of the First Coalition but the fleeting period of peace ended in 1798, with the formation of the Second Coalition against the French Republic. Nansouty's 9th Cavalry Regiment was successively attached to the Armies \\"of Germany\\", \\"of Mainz\\" and then to the \\"Army of the Danube\\", under the command of Jean-Baptiste Jourdan. In 1799, the regiment, with Nansouty commanding it, was integrated into General of Division Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul's Cavalry Reserve of the \\"Army of the Danube\\". This army was sharply defeated at the Battle of Stockach and most of its units merged with General Andr√© Mass√©na's \\"Army of Switzerland\\"; the cavalry was sent to the newly formed \\"Army of the Rhine\\".Thoumas, pp. 14‚Äì15. In 1799, France's political and military situation seemed perilous, especially after the losses in southwestern Germany culminating in the Battle at Stockach. By then a colonel, Nansouty accepted the promotion to brigadier general on 29 August and was given the command of a heavy cavalry brigade formed by the 8th and 9th Cavalry Regiments. Later, Nansouty's brigade was provisionally augmented to four regiments, which, alongside Brigadier General Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne's four regiments, was included in a 3,000-man- strong Cavalry Reserve (the 1st and 2nd Carabiniers-√†-Cheval and the 6th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 19th and 23rd Cavalry Regiments, with 14 cannons), under the command of the 45-year-old General d'Hautpoul. Overall command of the \\"Army of the Rhine\\" was given to the promising General Claude Lecourbe. Lecourbe believed his forces to be insufficient for offensive action, so he decided to fall back. During the retreat, a cavalry combat took place during the Battle of Wiesloch, where d'Hautpoul's men, and Nansouty's brigade in particular, were heavily engaged. With operations on the Rhine coming to an end, Lecourbe was replaced at the head of the army by Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers, who reorganised d'Hautpoul's Cavalry Reserve, reducing Nansouty's brigade to its initial strength of two regiments (the 8th and 9th Cavalry). Campaign in Germany Despite the improvement of the military situation on its borders, France remained in political turmoil. Upon his return from the campaign in Egypt, General Napoleon Bonaparte received a hero's welcome and was regarded by many as the saviour of France. Enjoying wide popular support and political backing, Bonaparte and his followers staged a coup and installed the French Consulate. Then, First Consul Bonaparte immediately drew up campaign plans against France's only remaining continental enemy, Austria. Nansouty was first called to serve in the First Consul's \\"Army of the Reserve\\" that was to operate in Italy, but General Jean Victor Marie Moreau insisted on retaining him in his own \\"Army of the Rhine\\", which was to operate in central Germany. Consequently, Nansouty received command of the cavalry (15th Cavalry, 11th Dragoons and 12th Chasseurs √† Cheval) of Lecourbe's \\"Right Wing Corps\\" of the \\"Army of the Rhine\\".Thoumas, p. 15-16. Nansouty's cavalry took part in several actions, beginning with the Battle of Engen, where the commander was noted for his able and daring manoeuvres, subsequently leading a successful charge against enemy infantry, whom he chased through the streets of the nearby city of Stockach, the locale of the French Army of the Danube's defeat a year earlier. He patrolled the Tyrol and there repulsed Prince Reuss-Plauen's forces in an action fought on 14 June 1800, the day when First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte was winning at Marengo further to the south. Nansouty served as a commander of an autonomous unit in the Tyrol until the end of the War of the Second Coalition, then under the successive command of Generals Molitor and Gudin. Nansouty's command included as many as five regiments, after the 6th and 8th Hussars were attached to his force. During this time, he enhanced his solid reputation as an able and adept cavalry commander; General Lecourbe stated that he wanted nobody else at the helm of his cavalry.Thoumas, p. 16. Years of peace 4th Hussars Regiment. This regiment was a part of Nansouty's division in 1803. The signing of the Treaty of Lun√©ville initiated a period of peace on the European continent. Meanwhile, however, with the Kingdom of Portugal allied to the Kingdom of Great Britain, First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte decided to make a military demonstration against the Lusitanian nation. He ordered the creation of the \\"Observation Corps of the Gironde\\". Chosen from a short list of nine men, Nansouty was named commander of the Corps cavalry. With orders to invade Portugal the \\"Observation Corps of the Gironde\\" entered Spanish territory, but it soon returned to France, after a treaty of peace was agreed with the Portuguese government. Nansouty then held various commands, before being named general of division on 24 March 1803. He was 35 years old. A military commander in the department of Seine-et- Oise, he was then sent to command the cavalry (5th Chasseurs √† Cheval, 2nd, 4th and 5th Hussar Regiments) of General √âdouard Mortier's \\"Army of Hanover\\", a position that he held until the Hanoverian army was disarmed and the French occupied the city. On 1 February 1804, Nansouty was called to a command in the cavalry reserve of the \\"Army of the Ocean coast\\". The reform of the French cavalry arm had already begun in September 1803, reorganising the first twelve regiments of heavy cavalry of the French Revolutionary army into regiments of cuirassiers. The reforms also established a powerful 6-regiment heavy cavalry division, comprising the 1st and 2nd Carabiniers-√†-Cheval, 2nd, 3rd, 9th and 12th Cuirassiers, with command given to Nansouty. On 29 August 1805 this division was renamed the 1st heavy cavalry division of the newly created Grande Arm√©e. Nansouty was also named Commander of the Legion of Honour on 14 June 1804. In 1805, Napoleon appointed him as First Chamberlain of the Empress,Thoumas, p. 17. but Nansouty disliked Court life and resigned from the position as soon as he was able to find an acceptable excuse.  Napoleonic Wars  =War of the Third Coalition= French cuirassiers preparing for a charge in 1805. Nansouty commanded cuirassiers in several actions throughout the campaigns of the War of the Third Coalition that year. Painting by Jean- Louis-Ernest Meissonier. At the outbreak of the War of the Third Coalition, a cavalry reserve corps was organised in the Grande Arm√©e, with command given to Marshal Joachim Murat. This cavalry reserve included Nansouty's heavy cavalry division, another heavy cavalry division under Jean-Joseph d'Hautpoul, three dragoon divisions, a foot dragoon division and a light cavalry brigade. Nansouty's six-regiment division soon acquired the reputation of being the best administered and most exact in its manoeuvres.Thoumas, p. 18. During the initial phase of the campaign, Nansouty's division was at first attached to Marshal Louis Nicolas Davout's III Corps, with which it crossed the Rhine and then the Danube, before rejoining Murat's cavalry reserve. Nansouty had a first opportunity to lead his men into combat at the Battle of Wertingen, where his men were noted for their excellent manoeuvring. Detaching his two Carabiniers-√†-Cheval regiments, which he had to leave with Murat, Nansouty and his reduced division followed the Emperor at Augsburg, where he was attached to Marshal Jean Lannes's V Corps. In this capacity, they supported Walther's division at the Battle of Sch√∂ngrabern. Then, at the Battle of Wischau on 25 November 1805, the 9th Cuirassiers participated in a major cavalry action, alongside d'Hautpoul's cuirassier division, Walther's dragoons and Bessi√®res's Grenadiers √† Cheval and Chasseurs √† Cheval of the Guard cavalry. Charge at Austerlitz Having advanced the bulk of his army deep into Austrian territory, Napoleon faced a massed enemy army of some 85,000 men in the vicinity of the town of Austerlitz. Combat began before dawn on 2 December 1805, and Nansouty had his entire division reunited under his command and again placed in the Cavalry Reserve, under Murat. Nansouty was positioned on the left wing of the army and his command included his usual six regiments of three-squadrons each: Brigadier General Piston's 1st and 2nd Carabiniers-√†- Cheval (205 and 181 men respectively), Brigadier General La Housaye's 2nd and 9th Cuirassiers (304 and 280 men respectively) and Brigadier General Saint- Germain's 3rd and 12th Cuirassiers (333 and 277 men respectively). Additionally, a horse battery from the 4th company of the 2nd horse artillery regiment was also a part of his division.Smith, p, 253. These men were at first positioned on two lines, behind Caffarelli's infantry division of Lannes's V Corps. Johann Josef I von Liechtenstein was in command of the cavalry reserve of the Austro-Russian army at Austerlitz. During this battle, his men came off worst from a series of encounters with Nansouty's 1st heavy cavalry division. At around 10:00, after battle had been joined all along the front, Russian General Pyotr Bagration, who had won the cavalry action a few days earlier at Wissau, pulled his forces back from the advancing enemy infantry from the V Corps. Meanwhile, the Austrian Prince Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein threw his 4,000-sabre Austro-Russian cavalry reserve into combat against Murat's 6,000 sabres. The Austro-Russians did not provide infantry or artillery support to the cavalry attack, while Murat's cavalrymen were able to cooperate with Lannes's infantry and artillery. Taking immense casualties after a first series of actions against Lannes's infantry, elements of the Coalition cavalry withdrew and were reformed by their commanders. Joined by Bagration's own cavalry, they set off again, this time aiming directly at Murat's command centre. As the Austro-Russian cavalry was closing in on its target, they were steadily met by four of Nansouty's regiments (the two Carabiniers regiments and the 2nd and 3rd Cuirassiers). The sounds of the two massed cavalries colliding could be heard some distance away. After a brief combat, the Austro-Russian horsemen broke and were driven off.Smith, pp. 56‚Äì57. However, Liechtenstein soon reformed his men and, seeing that all the French cavalry was positioned on the left of Caffarelli's infantry division, he launched his men against the right wing of this division, but was instantly met with sustained musket volleys that disorganised his cavalrymen. Seeing this development, Nansouty wheeled right with his men and crossed the infantry intervals by platoons, and then formed his men on two battle lines in front of the infantry. Three charges ensued in brief succession, with Nansouty skilfully committing the 1st and 2nd Carabiniers-√†-Cheval and the 2nd Cuirassiers from his first line, then the 9th Cuirassiers and Saint-Germain's brigade from his second line. The Austro-Russian cavalry was finally broken and repulsed for good.Thoumas, pp. 18‚Äì19. After another series of well- coordinated cavalry and infantry actions, Murat and Lannes were able to force Bagration's entire force to withdraw, with a loss 2,000 men (approximately half of the force) and 16 guns. On the French side, despite their repeated charges on this day, the 1st heavy cavalry division registered only relatively minor casualties, a testament to the skill of its commanders. Piston's 1st Brigade registered 2 killed and 41 wounded, La Houssaye's 2nd Brigade registered 1 man killed and 25 wounded, while Saint-Germain's 3rd Brigade registered 47 killed and 28 wounded. The regiment that suffered the highest casualty rate was by far the 3rd cuirassiers, with 44 killed and 27 wounded, for a casualty rate of 21 per cent. Nansouty's charge was rated \\"superb and brilliant\\" in the report drawn up by General Augustin Daniel Belliard, Murat's chief of staff, and Nansouty was subsequently mentioned in the army bulletin for this action and named Grand Officier de la L√©gion d'honneur on 25 December. Additionally, of the six colonels in his division, three were promoted to Brigadier General and three received the cross of Commandeur de la L√©gion d'honneur. Following the peace of Pressburg with the Austrian Empire in late December 1805, Nansouty's division was stationed in Bavaria, where they took winter quarters. =War of the Fourth Coalition= Campaign in Prussia The triumphal parade of the Grande Arm√©e in the Prussian capital of Berlin on 25 October 1806 As the War of the Fourth Coalition broke out in September 1806, Emperor Napoleon I took his Grande Arm√©e into the heart of Germany in a memorable campaign against Prussia. Comprising the same regiments as the year before (1st and 2nd Carabiniers-√†-Cheval, 2nd, 3rd, 9th and 12th cuirassiers), Nansouty's 1st heavy cavalry division was again a part of Joachim Murat's cavalry reserve. At first, due to the extraordinary speed of Napoleon's operations, the 1st heavy cavalry division and one of the two cuirassier brigades of d'Hautpoul's 2nd heavy cavalry division did not arrive at the front line in time to participate in the Battle of Jena. Beginning with the evening of 14 October, Nansouty's cavalry pursued the routed Prussian army, following an enemy corps of 10,000 infantrymen and 3 cavalry regiments into the streets of Erfurt on 15 October. With the enemy trapped in the city, Colonel Pr√©val of the 3rd cuirassiers negotiated the capitulation of Erfurt by nightfall,Thoumas, p. 20. which resulted in the capture of 12,000 prisoners of war (including 6,000 wounded) and 65 cannons.Pigeard, Dictionnaire des batailles..., p. 277. Resuming its pursuit of the Prussian army, Nansouty's division was at Potsdam beginning on 25 October, and two days later they participated to the triumphant parade of the Grande Arm√©e in Berlin, before being reviewed by the Emperor on 30 October. Beginning on 7 November, Nansouty and his division were with Murat, heading for the river Vistula, which they crossed on 22 December with the rest of the cavalry reserve. After a brief and successful cavalry action at the Lapazin bridge, they tried to get to the Battle of Golymin in time for the action, but were delayed by the thick mud and by the slower dragoon division that preceded them; they arrived after the battle. The division then took winter quarters in Warsaw, but with Murat on sick leave, Nansouty was soon called to replace him, taking command of Lasalle's light cavalry division and the dragoon divisions of Klein and Milhaud. These divisions were placed in the first line of the army, and Nansouty, although formally placed under the overall command of Marshal Jean- de-Dieu Soult, had orders to act independently and report directly to the Emperor if any unforeseen and extraordinary events should occur. Nansouty handled this new mission with care, personally patrolling the front line and deciding where to place the pickets of light cavalry that were to cover the infantry outposts.Thoumas, p. 21. Campaign in Poland: early manoeuvres Before 1810, the two heavy cavalry regiments of carabiniers-√†-cheval wore no cuirass. They were a part of Nansouty's heavy cavalry division between 1804 and 1809. With the news of the alarming Russian operations against the left wing of the army, Murat reassumed command of the cavalry reserve, ordering Nansouty to retake command of the 1st heavy cavalry division and follow the concentration of the army towards Eylau. Joining his men in Warsaw, Nansouty diligently led them towards his assigned destination, but did not arrive until 13 February 1807, five days after the Battle of Eylau and too late to take part in any action. On 14 February, Nansouty learned of the death of his comrade and former commander during the Revolutionary Wars, General d'Hautpoul, who had been fatally wounded during the heroic cavalry charges at Eylau. After the battle, the Emperor decided that the army was to take winter quarters. To ensure the safety of his outposts, he sent Murat with a powerful column, including Nansouty's men, with the mission of pushing back any enemy they might find. A short skirmish involving the 1st heavy cavalry division occurred at Wolfsdorf on 10 March, before it was decided that all the heavy cavalry would be sent to the lower Vistula, where they were to rest and be reinforced. With its ranks replenished after the winter actions, the six- regiment division under Nansouty numbered, on 1 June 1807, no less than 3,257 men. It was by far the most powerful heavy cavalry division of the Cavalry Reserve, which then included two other such divisions, the 2nd under Saint- Sulpice and a newly added 3rd, under Espagne.Garnier, p. 48. As military operation resumed later in 1807, Nasouty's division was hastily directed towards the town of Deppen, where Marshal Michel Ney had managed to retreat with his Corps, after energetically extricating himself from a dangerous situation, with surprisingly few losses.Thoumas, p. 22. With Ney's Corps, the Cavalry Reserve and the Guard, Napoleon moved towards Guttstadt, where on 9 June he found a large combined-arms enemy force. Murat took Lasalle's light horse and Nansouty's heavy cavalry and launched a series of charges that drove back the enemy force. Murat continued to press on and pushed the enemy into the streets of Guttstadt, where he penetrated with the cavalry at nightfall. Having fought well with his men, Nansouty was rested the next day, leaving all the action at the Battle of Heilsberg to Espagne's 3rd Heavy Cavalry division. At the beginning of June 1807, the Emperor reassessed his strategic situation and decided that he needed to move northeast, in order to prevent Bennigsen's Russian army from using the bridge at Friedland to cross the Alle river. If the Russians managed to cross the Alle river at Friedland, they could then move closer to their Prussian allies, who were based in K√∂nigsberg. Napoleon drew up a plan, giving Marshal Murat two army corps and a powerful cavalry reserve, with orders to march on K√∂nigsberg, while sending the rest of the troops towards Friedland. Leading the thrust towards Friedland was Marshal Jean Lannes's Reserve Corps (two infantry divisions and one cavalry brigade), with Grouchy's dragoons and Nansouty's horse carabiniers and cuirassiers temporarily attached. In Murat's absence, Grouchy was the senior cavalry commander and was to take overall command of all the cavalry that remained with the Emperor. Campaign in Poland: Friedland Nansouty's cuirassiers charging at the Battle of Friedland on 14 June 1807 Arriving with his corps at Friedland on 13 June after nightfall, Lannes found the position already occupied by Russian forces. Very early on 14 June, Lannes intrepidly attacked with an almost symbolic force (between 11,000 and 13,500 men) against the might of a massed enemy army of 85,000. His goal was to prevent the enemy from crossing the Alle and to give Napoleon enough time to arrive with the remainder of his forces. Nansouty's division arrived on the field of battle at Friedland after the first engagements and was directed towards the strategic village of Heinrichsdorf. This village needed to be held, as it protected Lannes's communications with the rest of Napoleon's army. Grouchy also directed his dragoon division towards the village and was shocked to find it in enemy hands and Nansouty's men retreating at a trot, without even attempting to contain the enemy or to cover the route that represented the corps' communication line.Garnier, pp. 50‚Äì51. In fact, Nansouty had arrived not long before and had been instructed to place himself at Heinrichsdorf, without further instructions and without being informed of what was happening on the right. As Russian infantry and cavalry were boldly pressing him, he became concerned with his own lines of communication and thus ordered his men back, to avoid being cut off.Thoumas, pp. 23‚Äì24. Napoleon giving orders for an attack at the Battle of Friedland. General Nansouty had an important role during this battle and is honoured by being depicted alongside the Emperor (on his left) in this painting by Horace Vernet. However, Nansouty's move compromised Lannes's entire plan, which counted on powerful reinforcements arriving through Heinrichsdorf. An alarmed Lannes immediately sent one of his aides de camp to Grouchy urging him to stop the enemy from cutting his communications with the Emperor, whatever the cost. Grouchy duly took command of Nansouty's leading squadrons, ordering them back to their initial position, then launched a desperate but successful charge with his own dragoons, arriving in the streets of the village and cutting off its Russian defenders. Grouchy's dragoons became disorganised and were badly positioned following this sudden charge, and the Russian cavalry countercharged them, but Nansouty arrived just in time and the French repulsed the Russian cavalry, momentarily securing the position.Garnier, pp. 51‚Äì52. A lively argument ensued between the two cavalry commanders. Grouchy invoked his seniority and position as commander of the cavalry and criticised Nansouty's earlier decision to withdraw. Nansouty countered by saying that he had superior experience at handling cavalry. When combat resumed, the quarrel did not prevent Nansouty from performing brilliantly under Grouchy's command during the dramatic series of events that followed. Having been repulsed earlier, the Russians decided to force the position at Heinrichsdorf, and they assembled a strong infantry force preceded by no less than 60 cavalry squadrons, plus around 2,000 Cossacks. To counter this move, Grouchy opted for deception, luring some of the enemy cavalry away from the infantry. Then, Grouchy charged the enemy horse from the front; simultaneously Nansouty hit them from the flank and together Grouchy and Nansouty repulsed them. Despite numerous charges and countercharges, the French cavalry maintained the upper hand.Thoumas, p. 25-27. After the arrival of the Emperor with significant reinforcements, the time was right for a general counterattack. The Emperor planned his main attack against the Russian left and he wanted to prevent the enemy from transferring reinforcements from their right wing to their battered left. To that effect, Grouchy received orders to incessantly harass the enemy before him, in order to prevent Bennigsen from redeploying them on the left wing. Orders also required Grouchy to silence the enemy guns pounding the French left. In this difficult task, Grouchy was perfectly seconded by Nansouty, and together they ended to the Russian cannonade in this sector. Later, Grouchy's report expressed admiration for Nansouty's actions, adding that the latter had \\"gloriously repaired\\" his earlier error. Nansouty was also mentioned in the 79th Bulletin of the Grande Arm√©e. After the battle, the 1st heavy cavalry division joined in the pursuit of the Russian army to the Nieman river, but the Treaties of Tilsit in July soon ended hostilities. =Count of the Empire, First Squire and the Peninsula= The Grand Aigle de la L√©gion d'Honneur decoration The numerous honours and endowments that General Nansouty received following the Battle of Friedland seem to suggest the Emperor's appreciation and the fact that Napoleon did not regard the early incident during this battle as Nansouty's fault. On 11 July 1807, General of Division Nansouty was named Grand Aigle de la L√©gion d'Honneur, the fifth and top rank of this order, reserved for the greatest general officers.Pigeard, Dictionnaire de la Grande Arm√©e, p. 368. This also brought an annual revenue of 20,000 Francs. His first endowment of 12,846 Francs was offered on 30 June 1807, and was paid by the Duchy of Warsaw. On 23 September, he received another 5,882 Francs on the Empire's Grand Livre. A count of the Empire from 10 March 1808, Nansouty was offered two additional endowments, one of 25,000 Francs, paid by the Kingdom of Westphalia, and the second of 10,000 Francs, paid by the Zeven domain in Hannover.Thoumas, p. 27. He also received an endowment of 100,000 Francs for the acquisition of a Parisian H√¥tel particulier; Nansouty bought the H√¥tel du Pr√©sident Duret in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, a neighbourhood inhabited by the new elite of Imperial France. Indeed, first-rate military figures such as the Viceroy of Italy Eug√®ne, Marshals Davout and Lannes and Generals Rapp and Legrand also acquired residences in Faubourg Saint- Germain.Tulard, vol. 2, p. 401.Gotteri, p. 198. Additionally, in 1808, he was offered the position of First Squire of the Emperor in Napoleon's Military Household, a dignity that offered an annual revenue of 30,000 Francs and which gained importance when the Grand Squire, General Armand Augustin Louis de Caulaincourt, was sent to Saint-Petersburg as ambassador. Napoleon allegedly chose Nansouty for his elegant manners and education, aristocratic posture and talent for administration. In his capacity as First Squire, Nansouty thus had to accompany the Emperor during the latter's short campaign in Spain (from November 1808 to early January 1809). There, he was in charge of several administrative tasks linked with managing the Emperor's stable services and suite and commanding his orderly officers. The Emperor's aides-de-camp had their own aides-de-camp, who were also placed under the command of the First Squire. Although never very far away from the Emperor in a campaign that included many battles, Nansouty himself never exercised a field command during this campaign, and in January 1809, he accompanied his master back to France, as the outbreak of the War of the Fifth Coalition was imminent.Thoumas, pp. 27‚Äì28. =War of the Fifth Coalition= With a large part of the French Empire's forces now entangled in the bloody Peninsular War, the Austrian Empire believed that its best opportunity to avenge the humiliating defeat of 1805 had finally come. The Austrians were looking to defeat France and regain their former influence in Italy and Germany. In early 1809, the Austrian war preparations were so intense that Napoleon was forced to leave Spain and head back to Paris to reorganise his main army in Germany.Castle, p. 7. In spring, Nansouty was therefore recalled to the command of 1st of the three heavy cavalry divisions of the Cavalry Reserve, placed this time under the command of Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessi√®res. As the War of the Fifth Coalition broke out, Nansouty's division was soon detached from the Reserve and temporarily attached to Marshal Louis Nicolas Davout's III Corps, the force that was assigned the most difficult tasks during the early military operations of this war. As Napoleon then ordered a concentration of the army at Ratisbon, Nansouty's division was once again put under the command of Bessi√®res and sent to serve with the Bavarian army. After his initial victories at Abensberg and Landshut, Napoleon concentrated the bulk of his army, including Nansouty's men, at Eckm√ºhl, where Davout was waiting.Thoumas, pp. 29‚Äì30. Eckm√ºhl and Ratisbon A French cuirassier in 1809, fully equipped for shock action Napoleon faced Archduke Charles's Austrian army at the Battle of Eckm√ºhl, on 21‚Äì22 April 1809. On 22 April, the second day of the battle, Nansouty was at first sent to the Schierling plain, in support of Bavarian General Deroy, who, after several failed attempts, managed to take the town of Eckm√ºhl from the enemy. Apart from the Schierling plain, the terrain at Eckm√ºhl was very uneven and hilly, with dangerously steep slopes, which made cavalry action here improper. Yet, it was here that one of the most memorable cavalry actions of the entire Napoleonic Wars was to take place. It all began on the slopes next to Eckm√ºhl, where a first brief cavalry engagement occurred, as Bavarian and W√ºrttemberger cavalry encountered and charged Austrian cavalry. The Austrians won out and the Bavarians and W√ºrttembergers retreated and reformed in the vicinity of the two French heavy cavalry divisions present. These two divisions, the 1st under Nansouty (1st and 2nd Carabiniers-√†-cheval, 2nd, 3rd, 9th and 12th Cuirassiers) and the 2nd under Saint-Sulpice (four regiments strong), were placed next to one another, forming five lines, with their regiments in column, one in front of the other. These men were ordered forward, up the slope and onto the plateau where the light cavalry had been repulsed moments earlier. Arriving on the plateau at a gallop, the cavalry overtook Marshal Lannes's infantry, who admiringly cheered \\"Vive les cuirassiers\\" (\\"Long live the cuirassiers\\") and applauded as the cavalry galloped past them,. With their two frontline regiments now deployed in line and with the German light cavalry protecting their flanks, the two heavy cavalry divisions clashed into whatever Austrian cavalry they could find on the plateau, repulsing them with ease. This was, however, only the prelude of a much larger cavalry combat.Thoumas, pp. 30‚Äì31. In order to protect his retreat, Archduke Charles of Austria reunited his entire cavalry reserve, 44 squadrons in all, on either side of the Ratisbon road,Thoumas, pp. 31‚Äì32. next to the village of Eggolsheim.Pigeard, Dictionnaire des batailles de Napol√©on, p. 266. Between 19:00 20:00 in the evening, Napoleon ordered his cavalry to disperse the enemy horse from this position. In preparation of the charge, Nansouty formed five of his regiments in two lines: three regiments in the first line and two in the second line, leaving his remaining regiment with Saint-Sulpice. Saint-Sulpice's division was on Nansouty's right and it remained formed in regiment column formations, while the light cavalry was protecting the flanks of the whole. In all, the French had 48 squadrons, and, as they advanced, they were met by intense artillery fire from the Austrian batteries and then vigorously charged by the Gottesheim cuirassier regiment. Seeing the enemy charging, Nansouty ordered his squadrons forward towards the enemy, but at a gentle trot. Then, as soon as the Austrians were at about one hundred paces, the frontline regiment of Carabiniers-√†-Cheval halted, loaded their carbines and fired a salvo from thirty or forty paces, then drew their swords and joined their fellow cuirassiers in an energetic charge. As Nansouty led, Saint-Sulpice followed and, despite the vigour and determination of the Austrian cavalry, they were repulsed after a brief hand-to-hand combat. Coming in support of the Gottesheim Cuirassiers, the Kaiser Cuirassier regiment shared the same fate, with the Stipsicz Hussars and Vincent Chevau-l√©gers also repulsed. A generalised and bloody m√™l√©e then occurred under the moonlight, with the sabre hits on the steel cuirasses producing sparkles in the night. Austrian General Andreas von Schneller was wounded during this action and General Karl Wilhelm von Stutterheim, commanding the entire Austrian cavalry, only just escaped capture. The Austrian cavalry was repulsed and pushed into the marshes beyond, subsequently retreating towards K√∂fering, with the bulk of Archduke Charles's forces retreating towards Ratisbon. The pursuit resumed the next day at dawn, and was followed by yet another action at the Battle of Ratisbon, where the Austrians tried to delay the French pursuit. After fierce fighting, during which Nansouty's and Saint-Sulpice's men successfully charged the enemy cavalry three times, the French captured the citadel at Ratisbon, but saw the Austrians skilfully retreating. Nansouty was left at Ratisbon with Davout, to observe the retreat of Archduke Charles.Thoumas, p. 32. Aspern- Essling French cuirassiers from the 3rd regiment during a charge. At the Battle of Aspern-Essling, the 3rd cuirassiers was a part of the brigade of General Antoine de Saint-Germain, under the overall command of General of Division Nansouty. On 21 May 1809, Napoleon crossed the Danube not far from Vienna and attacked Archduke Charles's Austrian army, situated on the northern bank of the river, in what became known as the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The French were nonetheless critically outnumbered and it soon became obvious that they would have a hard time just holding out. Nansouty could only get one of his brigades, Saint-Germain's 3rd and 12th cuirassiers, across the Danube for the action on 21 May. He found the heroic cuirassiers of General Jean-Louis- Brigitte Espagne charging, as they had done all day long, in a desperate attempt to stop Austrian attacks on the thin French battle line. Espagne had just been killed in action and his exhausted and depleted squadrons needed to be relieved. Nansouty at once brought forward Saint-Germain's squadrons and charged the enemy infantry, allowing the army to maintain itself on the position.Thoumas, p. 35. On the second day of the battle, 22 May, Nansouty received his second cuirassier brigade, Doumerc's 2nd and 9th regiments. During the morning, having received some reinforcements, Napoleon sent Marshal Lannes's Corps forward, in an attack against the enemy line. Nansouty's and Lasalle's cavalry protected the infantry columns, charging the enemy cavalry to clear their path. However, at around 21:00 in the morning, news that the great bridge over the Danube had broken, making the arrival of further reinforcements virtually impossible, forced Napoleon to call off his attack and order a phased retreat. The situation of the French army was critical, with Marshal Lannes fatally wounded, and a great number of losses in men. It took all the skill of Nansouty and the other cavalry commanders to contain the formidable Austrian onslaught in order to allow the rest of the army to gradually disengage. After most of the army had safely crossed an arm of the Danube onto the island of Lobau, Nansouty's men were also withdrawn from the battlefield during the night, with the French cavalry subsequently celebrated for their role in preventing a catastrophic defeat that day. Wagram Nansouty's cuirassiers charging at the Battle of Wagram. Painting by Guido Sigriste. After the bloody setback at Aspern-Essling, Napoleon took six weeks to carefully plan another crossing of the Danube. He launched this operation late on 4 July and, by the early hours of the next day, he had managed to get a substantial force across the river. Nansouty's division did not see any action during the first day of the Battle at Wagram and at night they camped behind the Imperial Guard. The next day, 6 July, Nansouty was at first directed to support Davout, on the French right, but when it became clear that the latter's sector was not threatened by the arrival of enemy reinforcements, they were ordered back into reserve in a central position on the battlefield, not far from the village of Aderklaa. Then, as the situation on the French left rapidly deteriorated, they were called into action, when Napoleon ordered Marshal Bessi√®res, commander of the Cavalry Reserve, to launch his men in a charge against the Austrians menacing his left. With time at the essence, Bessi√®res opted not to wait for the Guard cavalry and, with his other two heavy cavalry divisions assigned to other sectors of the battlefield, he decided to lead forward only Nansouty's men.Thoumas, p. 36. This division was indeed very strong: 24 squadrons, more than 4,000 men, including Brigadier General Defrance's 1st and 2nd carabiniers-√†-cheval, Brigadier General Doumerc's 2nd and 9th cuirassiers and Brigadier General Berckheim's 3rd and 12th cuirassiers.Castle, p. 23. Bessi√®res and Nansouty led these men forward, through a hail of cannonballs and case-shot, with the carabiniers-√†-cheval at the front. Finding a weaker spot in the Austrian line, they pierced it and stormed past the enemy infantry formed in squares, sabering the Georger Grenzer battalion as they went along their way. However, many of the French cavalry did not manage to penetrate through the formidable masses of Austrian infantry, so Nansouty was now commanding a much diminished force. Showing great skill in handling his men, Nansouty then wheeled right and charged Liechtenstein's artillery line. However, the Austrian cavalry promptly intervened, spearheaded by the Rosenberg chevaulegers and the Kronprinz cuirassier regiments, which caught the carabiniers-√†-cheval in flank and repulsed them, pursuing them back to their lines. The costly repulse of Nansouty's division did not dishearten Bessi√®res, who was preparing another rapid charge, now with the support of elements of the Guard cavalry. This charge never came, as the Marshal's horse was killed by a cannonball, with Bessi√®res also hit and carried unconscious behind the lines.Arnold, p. 149. With his commander presumed dead, Nansouty did not know what the Emperor's orders were and thus promptly decided to pull back his men, to avoid further damage to his already battered division.Thoumas, pp. 36‚Äì37. During the battle, Marshal Bessi√®res (pictured on the right) was wounded and thought dead when his horse was killed by a cannonball. Detail of a painting by Antoine-Jean Gros. This however was not to be the end of General Nansouty's action at the great Battle of Wagram. Although the great cavalry attack had done much to ease the pressure on Napoleon's left-centre, the latter's situation remained critical. The Emperor thus launched the Corps of General Jacques MacDonald in an attack against the Austrian right-centre.Pigeard, Dictionnaire des batailles..., p. 922. MacDonald's attack formation, formed by chance more than by any tactical forethought, was a huge infantry attack column or square, comprising all his divisions in a deep formation that was highly unusual for Napoleonic warfare.Sokolov, pp. 224‚Äì225. Four squadrons of Nansouty's carabiniers-√†-cheval were sent to support the flank of this attack, with the rest of his division further back.Thoumas, p. 37. Realising that his advance is hampered by intense Austrian artillery fire, MacDonald aimed to clear the enemy guns before him, asking for a cavalry charge from Walther's Guard cavalry on his right and Nansouty's 1st heavy cavalry division on his left. With no direct orders from the Emperor and his commander, Marshal Bessi√®res, out of action, Walther opted not to move,Sokolov, p. 455. while Nansouty did send his men forward but, having been positioned too far back, he arrived only after the enemy guns had moved away. Nansouty's division suffered a very high casualty rate at the Battle of Wagram, with more men and horses lost than the other two heavy cavalry divisions combined. Losses in horses were extremely high, with 1,141 animals killed or injured, while losses in men were also significant, despite the fact that only the carabiniers-√†-cheval really came into contact with the enemy. Overall, Nansouty's division lost 164 men killed and 436 wounded. Foremost of all, the highly battered two carabiniers-√†-cheval regiments had no more than 300 horses standing between themselves by the end of the day, for an equine casualty rate of 77 percent, with the 9th and 12th cuirassiers also suffering high casualties. Bessi√®res's charge, hastily organised with only the division of Nansouty, through murderous artillery fire and against masses of infantry prepared to receive them, had less tactical effect than at Aspern-Essling, but it did win Napoleon valuable time, allowing him to retake the initiative in this battle. =Interlude between two campaigns= Cuirasses were adopted in 1810 for both Carabiniers-√†-Cheval regiments, with Nansouty suggesting the idea. General MacDonald was very critical of both Walther and Nansouty, for their alleged failure to provide proper cavalry support during his attack. MacDonald went on to write in his memoirs that he was \\"taken aback by the slowness of General Nansouty [...] Nansouty did charge in the end, but too late to take advantage of the gaping hole that I had pierced in the centre of the Austrian army.\\"Naulet, p. 67. A few days after the Battle of Wagram, Napoleon confronted Nansouty over what he saw as being a failure to cooperate with MacDonald. Nansouty responded to the Emperor's lively reproaches by offering categorical explanations, saying that he had not been consulted in the placement of his division, rendering manoeuvres impossible during that action. As Napoleon insisted, Nansouty stood up to him, finally retorting: \\"After all, it is not Your Majesty at any rate who can teach me to lead cavalry...\\" Despite this remark, Nansouty would continue to be given significant commands in the coming years. It was shortly after this bloody battle that Nansouty insisted that the Carabiniers-√†-Cheval be given the steel cuirass, in a bid to cancel out what he saw as being a state of inferiority of these troops vis-√†-vis their fellow cuirassiers. Nansouty's initiative was approved and was enforced in 1810. With the peace of Vienna signed between the French Empire and the Austrian Empire in October, Nansouty was ordered to leave the command of his division to General Bruy√®res and retake his position of First Squire alongside the Emperor (17 October 1809).Thoumas, p. 38. However, with the return of the Grand Squire Armand Augustin Louis de Caulaincourt, the role of the First Squire was much diminished. As a result, in 1811 Nansouty was given an additional function, that of General Inspector of cavalry. Very active in exercising this function, he soon became reputed for his strictness and for his detailed knowledge and invaluable experience that he had of this arm. Nonetheless, war was, once more, not far away and, on 19 October 1811, Nansouty was called to the command of the 2nd and 4th cuirassier divisions of the \\"Observation Corps of the Elbe\\", under the command of Marshal Louis Nicolas Davout. Then, with the reorganisation of the Grande Arm√©e in April 1812, Nansouty was named at the command of the I Cavalry Corps . =Campaign in Russia= With the outbreak of the war with Russia in 1812, the Grande Arm√©e included, alongside the usual combined-arms Army Corps, four large Cavalry Reserve Corps, commanded respectively by Generals Nansouty (Ist), Montbrun (IInd), Grouchy (IIIrd) and La Tour Maubourg (IVth Corps). This innovation has been much criticised after this campaign and, in the words of Marshal Marmont, it had the only merit of \\"presenting an extraordinary spectacle that astonished the eye.\\" During this campaign, Nansouty's I Cavalry Corps was composed of: *General Bruy√®res's 1st light cavalry division (7th, 8th Hussars, 16th Chasseurs √† cheval, 9th Chevau- l√©gers lanciers, one Prussian and one Polish light horse regiments), *General Saint-Germain's 1st cuirassier division (2nd, 3rd, 9th Cuirassiers, 1st Chevau-l√©gers lanciers regiments), *General Valence's 5th cuirassier division (6th, 11th and 12th Cuirassiers, 5th Chevau-l√©gers lanciers regiments), *an artillery of 36 pieces. Nansouty's cuirassiers attack squares of Russian guardsmen to the left of Semyanovskaya (background) during the early stages of the Battle of Borodino. Detail from the Borodino Panorama by Franz Roubaud, 1912. Having crossed the Niemen river with his Corps, Nansouty would continuously march under the command of Joachim Murat during this campaign, preceding the advance of the army and taking Wilna as they advanced. Despite marching constantly alongside Murat and Emperor Napoleon, Nansouty's Ist Corps of cavalry reserve saw little action, combating brilliantly in a vanguard action at Ostrovno and then briefly at Vitebsk. An incident involving some of Nansouty's light cavalry occurred during the combat at Vitebsk, when the 8th Hussars and 16th Chasseurs √† cheval turned and fled before the Russian light horse. This was evidence that the division of Bruy√®res, of which they were a part, had been much used by always being placed at the vanguard of the army, resulting in the loss many of the best and bravest troopers. Despite Nansouty's best efforts, the extremely long and exhausting marches, the torrential rains and the absence of proper fodder took their toll on the Ist Cavalry Corps, with numbers reduced to half by this time. Additionally, just like the other Cavalry Corps commanders, Nansouty rarely had all his troops under direct control, which led to cavalry being used improperly at times.Thoumas, pp. 39‚Äì40. With his three divisions reunited on 7 September 1812, Nansouty's Ist Cavalry Corps saw action at the Battle of Borodino. He was placed on the French right, in second line, behind the Corps of Marshal Davout and, after Murat managed to take two of the redoubts on the Russian left, Nansouty placed his men on the right of this position and then supported the advance of the right wing of the army. With the Russians making an offensive comeback, Nansouty placed himself at the head of the heavy divisions of Saint-Germain and Valence and charged and while doing so a bullet pierced one of his knees. This was Nansouty's first battle wound and it was serious enough to end his active role during this campaign.Thoumas, pp. 39‚Äì41. He was transported to Moscow following the battle and although still wounded, on 10 October, he was entrusted with the mission of commanding the convoy that was to take the wounded generals and colonels, as well as the main trophies captured, behind the lines.Courcelles, p. 143. During this mission, he was exposed to great danger, to famine and extreme cold, which impacted his already frail health. He was then allowed to return to France and recover from his injury. =War of the Sixth Coalition= The remains of the French army had completely evacuated Russian territory by December 1812 but their defeat sparked anti-French sentiments in Germany and Prussia joined the Russians, forming a Sixth Coalition. Hostilities thus continued in early 1813 but Nansouty's wound did not yet allow him to return to action, so he was offered the prestigious position of Colonel-General of dragoons (16 January), in replacement of General Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers, who had just died of exhaustion.Thoumas, p. 41. Nansouty's wound was very serious but he had been very lucky: the bullet that pierced his knee only tore through flesh, leaving his kneecap intact. Having missed the first part of the campaign, General Nansouty was recalled to a field command once his knee wound was cured, towards mid-1813. He accepted to take the helm of the Guard cavalry, with a complement of 5,000 sabres, and including Guyot's Grenadiers-√†-cheval, Letort's Dragons, Lefebvre-Desnouettes Chasseurs-√†-cheval and √âdouard Colbert's Chevau-l√©gers lanciers. Campaign in Saxony In 1813, most military operations took part in Saxony, with the Chasseurs-√†-cheval and Colbert's Chevau-l√©gers lanciers encountering the enemy in several isolated cavalry actions, but the first serious action came only at the Battle of Dresden, where Nansouty's Guard cavalry supported Marshal Michel Ney's attack on the extreme left, in conjunction with Marshal √âdouard Mortier's \\"Young Guard\\" infantry divisions.Pigeard, Dictionnaire des batailles..., p. 252. Bavarian General Karl Philipp von Wrede tried to block Napoleon's retreat back to France, resulting in the Battle of Hanau. During the battle, the Austro- Bavarian cavalry was defeated by Nansouty's Imperial Guard cavalry. However, the Guard cavalry was not needed as a whole before the epic \\"Battle of Nations\\" at Leipzig. Placed in reserve at first, the Guard cavalry and artillery had to spring into action at once, after Napoleon received news of the Saxon defection. With the Saxons now in the Coalition camp and firing at the soldiers who moments before had been their allies, the situation of some of the French troops became desperate. The position of General Durutte's division, placed close to Saxon lines, was particularly tenuous and Napoleon soon came to its aid, with Nansouty in command of the Guard cavalry and horse artillery. Nansouty launched an impetuous charge with some of his regiments, the Grenadiers-√†-cheval, Dragons and Chevau-l√©gers and the Saxons were unable to hold out in this sector. However, the situation changed on 19 October, with the untimely explosion of a bridge over the Elster, the main retreat line for the French rearguard, which was now blocked in the city of Leipzig. The Guard cavalry extricated itself from the field of battle and was very useful in covering the retreat of the remaining French forces.Thoumas, p. 42. With the Grande Arm√©e in full retreat, another dangerous situation occurred on 29 October. With Bavaria now also in the camp of the Coalition, an Austro- Bavarian army of some 45,000 men, under General Karl Philipp von Wrede, who had fought under the command of the Emperor during the previous campaigns, tried to block the French retreat and delay the French force until the arrival of the rest of the Coalition forces. Wrede had the means necessary to achieve his goal, as he possessed a numerous artillery of about one hundred pieces and a powerful cavalry of 50 squadrons. In comparison, the French forces were much dispersed and only a few units remained cohesive and combat-capable.Mir, p. 12. During the ensuing Battle of Hanau, Wrede placed his troops in front of the forest of Lamboi, through which he expected that the French would retreat. He also positioned almost all of his cavalry on the left, placing it under the command of Field Marshal-Lieutenant Spleny. Despite his numeric inferiority, Napoleon sent forward a part of his men against Bavarians deployed in the forest before him, but the intervention of the Foot Guards was soon required. The Bavarians had fought alongside the French in the past and the sight of the fearsome Bearskins of French Guardsmen shook their morale and they abandoned their position in the forest after a brief fight. But, with the fire of a Bavarian grand battery upon them, the French infantry soon had to stop. Napoleon positioned General Le Noury's artillery in battery and brought in support General Drouot with the horse artillery of the Guard, as well as other pieces, constituting a grand battery of some 50 pieces that was soon able to respond adequately to the Austro-Bavarian cannonade. Nansouty, with the Guard Dragoons and Lancers, was instructed to protect this battery from the enemy and thus positioned his men behind the guns.Thoumas, p 43. General Nansouty (his back to the viewer, recognizable due to his powdered hair and ponytail) giving instructions during the defence of the Grand Battery against Austro- Bavarian cavalry. His Guard cavalry is seen charging in the background. Detail of a painting by Horace Vernet. Seeing this inauspicious development, Wrede sent his cavalry, no less than 7,000 men, to charge Drouot's grand battery. The steady French canister fire was devastating and many Coalition squadrons turned back to safety. Some of them did manage to get to the French guns and crossed the battery, with the Guard cavalry immediately countercharging and driving them off. With the gun line now out of danger, Nansouty, with the aid of Sebastiani's cuirassiers launched a pursuit of the repulsed enemy horse, encountering and breaking an Austrian cuirassier regiment, the Knesevich Dragoon regiment and two Bavarian chevaulegers regiments, all under the personal command of Field Marshal-Lieutenant Franz Spl√©ny de Mih√°ldy. Then, with a manoeuvre resembling that of Kellermann at Marengo, Nansouty wheeled his men left and rushed onto the enemy infantry, breaking them. The Grenadiers-√†-Cheval were in the thick of the fighting and, with an offensive comeback of the Bavarian cavalry, they were momentarily in a dangerous situation, but were duly rescued by the Gardes d'Honneur regiment. Nansouty then took his entire cavalry and broke the remaining enemy squares and cavalry, pushing some of these men into the Kinzig river. Meanwhile, Nansouty's action left Sebastiani free to silence the Bavarian grand battery, skilfully using Saint-Germain's cuirassier division and Exelmans's light division of his Corps.Thoumas, pp. 43‚Äì44.Mir, pp. 16‚Äì17. Nansouty received a light wound during this battle, but his role at Hanau is compared by a Russian author to that of Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz at the Battle of Zorndorf.Thoumas, p. 45. Campaign in France Nansouty's final campaign took place in 1814 on French soil, under bleak circumstances for the French, who saw huge Coalition armies invade France at the beginning of that year. During this campaign, his command, 5,000 Horse Guards, included the 1st and 2nd Chevau-l√©gers Lanciers regiments, under General √âdouard Colbert, the Chasseurs √† Cheval, under General Laferri√®re, the Grenadiers √† Cheval under General Guyot, the Dragons, under General Letort, as well as the entire Guard horse artillery. These men soon saw action on 27 January, at the Battle of Brienne. Here, two companies of horse artillery, under an officer called Marin, a veteran of the campaigns in Italy and Egypt and personal favourite of the Emperor, were almost completely destroyed, with their guns and commander captured by the enemy. Napoleon was extremely irritated about the failure of the heavy cavalry of the Guard to protect these gunners. A further loss of cannon of the Guard artillery occurred at the Battle of La Rothi√®re, a rare battlefield defeat for Napoleon. Here, a part of the Guard cavalry charged and was initially successful against enemy cavalry but, faced by steady ranks of the Russian and Prussian Guardsmen and with its flank threatened by enemy dragoons, it soon had to withdraw, leaving behind some of its cannon. After rejoining the Emperor at Champaubert, Nansouty took part to the Battle of Montmirail, where he was at first instructed to protect the artillery. He then joined in the attack of the Guard infantry on the farm of ƒñpine-au-Bois, where he suddenly wheeled left with his men and fell upon unprepared enemy infantry, charging home, routing these troops and subsequently pursuing the fugitives. This combined attack of the Guard resulted in a great number of prisoners and captured enemy guns, with Nansouty receiving a light wound in the process. A part of his men then took part to the Battle of Ch√¢teau-Thierry, where the Emperor ordered the Guard cavalry to make a turning move against the enemy left, and where Nansouty's subordinates General Letort and Colonel Cur√©ly brilliantly broke several enemy squares. Then, on 14 February, Nansouty personally led a brilliant charge at the Battle of Vauchamps, where he supported Grouchy in a cavalry action that decided the battle. Charging Bl√ºcher's men from the front, Nansouty allowed Grouchy to magnificently fall behind the enemy columns, which they both then sabred and crushed, with the Guard cavalry subsequently participating in a highly successful pursuit. Enemy losses reached a staggering 9,000‚Äì10,000 casualties, with 25 cannons lost. The Emperor was radiant following this battle, but, by nightfall, his mood changed when he found out of the loss of some Guard horse artillerymen. These men had been captured during their march and it was reported that their capture resulted from General Guyot (one of Nansouty's subordinates) failing to provide an escort and a guide for them. In Nansouty's presence, a fuming Napoleon summoned Guyot and then chastised him for the repeated losses in cannon during the previous battles, as well as for various other shortcomings, such as failing to properly escort the Emperor. After an angry tirade, Napoleon promptly axed Guyot and announced to Nansouty that General Exelmans would replace Guyot at the helm of his Old Guard heavy cavalry. This episode apparently strained relations between Emperor Napoleon and General Nansouty.Thoumas, pp. 46‚Äì51. Napoleon during the 1814 military campaign in France. Painting by Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier Always in the thick of the action during this campaign, on 24 February, Nansouty was present near the city of Troyes. Negotiations for an armistice were ongoing in a village nearby and, despite formal orders to continue the fighting, the two armies had ceased the combat. Nansouty then took his men and attacked enemy troops, charging into the streets of the village where the negotiations were taking place. The French envoy to the armistice talks, Monsieur de Flahaut saw this development and found Nansouty, bitterly protesting against the latter's action. Nansouty responded that the Emperor was doubtlessly aware that negotiations were indeed taking place there, but that he had orders to capture the position without further delay. On 27 February, the Emperor again moved against Bl√ºcher's Prussians, leaving a part of his forces near Troyes to observe the movement of Prince of Schwarzenberg's Austrian army. Nansouty, with the Guard cavalry, accompanied the Emperor, ensuring his protection and clearing his way after a bloody cavalry skirmish at Ch√¢teau-Thierry on 3 March. Another cavalry skirmish occurred on 5 March, with Nansouty repulsing a numerous enemy cavalry, 3,000‚Äì4,000 troopers, and capturing the bridge of Berry-au-Bac, over the Aisne, despite the enemy cannonade. Once across the Aisne with a few Polish lancer platoons, Nansouty launched a heroic pursuit, capturing enemy cannons and munitions, and taking a significant number of prisoners, among whom was the teenage Russian Prince Gagarin.Thoumas, pp. 52‚Äì56. On 7 March, at the Battle of Craonne, another incident occurred, seemingly indicating that there had been some sort of disagreement between the General and the Emperor. As the battle was raging, General Belliard from the Emperor's staff came to Nansouty and told him that he had orders to relieve him of command should his health prevent him from exercising his duties. Nansouty responded that he was indeed ill, but that he was able to retain command. Although in unusually bad humour after this incident, Nansouty subsequently led a most brilliant action at Craonne. He was ordered to cross bogged and broken terrain, and climb a steep incline with his cavalry and artillery, in order to fall on the enemy's right flank. Managing to bring his cavalrymen on the ridge, Nansouty formed them in line and launched them against the enemy, pushing back in disorder two Russian battalions. Nansouty was again wounded during this action, but this injury was not very serious and he continued to energetically lead his men. Napoleon then allegedly ordered Nansouty to assault a redoubt, under the most murderous fire. Nonetheless, Nansouty ordered his men to halt and advanced alone towards the position. Asked to explain his behaviour, he replied that he would not send his men to die in vain and that he would be attacking alone. Napoleon at once revoked his order.Courcelles, p. 145. This was to be the last military engagement of Nansouty's long career. On 8 March, on the eve of the Battle of Laon, Nansouty was at Chavignon, nine kilometres from Laon, where the Emperor was also present and, although the circumstances of Nansouty's departure are unclear, it is certain that he left this village, and his command, that very day. Two days later, Napoleon wrote to his War Minister to inform him that General Nansouty's health did not allow him to exercise his military duties and that he was authorised to take sick leave in Paris. General Belliard had taken interim command of the Guard cavalry during the battle of Laon, with General S√©bastiani subsequently given permanent command. Bourbon Restoration General Nansouty portrayed as Colonel-General of Dragoons, a position he held between January 1813 and until the Bourbon Restoration Having left his command to General Belliard on 8 March, three days later, Nansouty was a part of a convoy of several officers, heading to Paris. On the road to the capital, they were attacked by a pulk of Cossacks, which managed to disperse the convoy's escort. Nansouty and his officers fought their way out sabre in hand and made a run for it towards the river Aisne. Reaching the riverbanks, the General got isolated and, as he was preparing to cross the river on horseback, his horse was shot under him, throwing the General to the ground. Nevertheless, he stood up and swam to the other bank of the river and safety. This event, as well as his tireless activity during the campaign, seem to suggest that his health was not the main reason of his departure from the army. It is also unlikely that the Emperor himself decided to replace him, given Belliard's tentative approach at the Battle of Craonne and this General's subsequent provisional status as commander, after Nansouty's departure. It is thus more likely that Nansouty resigned, following his disputes with the Emperor.Thoumas, p. 56. General Nansouty arrived in Paris and there he remained during the Bourbon Restoration that followed Napoleon's abdication. He was one of the first general officers to swear allegiance to the new King of France, Louis XVIII, who would bestow a number of honours upon the General.Thoumas, p. 57. His gesture encouraged many other generals to also swear allegiance to the new regime. On 12 April 1814, Nansouty was named extraordinary commissioner of the King in the 2nd military division, then, on 20 April, became a member of the commission that was in charge of the dissolution of Napoleon's Imperial Guard. He was given the distinction of Knight of the Order of Saint Louis on 1 June and on 6 July he was called to a command in the Military Household of the King of France, as captain-lieutenant of the 1st company of musketeers (grey musketeers). Despite these positions, Nansouty's financial situation declined severely under the Restoration. The General had had a highly honourable behaviour during the Napoleonic Wars and, unlike some of his fellow Napoleonic Generals, had drawn no revenues from pillaging. He had also been living a lofty and very costly lifestyle, which he considered normal for a nobleman such as himself. Nansouty had been earning a high revenue from his various positions during the Empire and additionally Napoleon was constantly paying high endowments to his best generals. Napoleonic endowments aside, Nansouty's salaries during the first four months of 1814 had brought him no less than 104,000 Francs, but, under the Bourbons, his dignity as Colonel-General of dragoons had been suppressed and transformed into an honorific title of Inspector of dragoons, leaving him with only a 25,000 Francs salary as captain-lieutenant in the King's Military Household. Death and resting place By the second half of 1814, following his long and almost continuous campaigns throughout Europe during the last ten years, the health of General Nansouty badly deteriorated. He was suffering from his wounds, some of which were very recent, but, above all from war fatigue. On his death bed, he is recorded to have said: \\"I have carefully reflected upon all my action ever since I was born and in all my life, I have not done anyone wrong.\\" He is also said to have reasserted his Christian faith and to have asked that his son be recommended for the King's protection, as a favour for his services. Just before passing away, he told his son that his heritage would be to follow his example and live an honourable and blameless life.Courcelles, p. 146. General Count √âtienne-Marie-Antoine-Champion de Nansouty died on 12 February 1815 in Paris, leaving behind his wife and their only son. A pension of 6,000 Francs per year was granted to the General's widow by the King of France. His final resting place is at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, division 27.Amis et passionn√©s du P√®re Lachaise The engraving on his tombstone reads: Tomb stone of General Count Nansouty at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris The name NANSOUTY is inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Family The Nansouty family was ancient Burgundy nobility and it was intimately linked to the history of this region, to which it gave several esteemed magistrates and soldiers throughout the centuries. One of its illustrious members, Seigneur de Nansouty was instrumental in ensuring the allegiance of Burgundy to King Henri IV and was rewarded by the monarch for his fidelity by being named state counselor.Courcelles, p. 139. General Count de Nansouty was the first child of Jean-Baptiste-Pierre-Charles Champion de Nansouty (born 1718 in Dijon, died 1785 in Bordeaux) and his wife Antoinette H√©l√®ne Harpailler (born ca. 1740), who also had Pierrette-Ad√©la√Øde Champion de Nansouty (1771‚Äì1849).GeneaNet On 27 September 1802, General Nansouty married Jeanne-Fran√ßoise Ad√©la√Øde Gravier de Vergennes (1781‚Äì1849), the niece of a former minister of Louis XVI, Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes. Her parents were: Charles Xavier Gravier de Vergennes, 1751‚Äì1794, and Elisabeth Ad√©la√Øde Fran√ßoise de Bastard, 1763‚Äì1808. General Count de Nansouty and his wife had only one child, √âtienne Champion de Nansouty (1803‚Äì1865), who, having followed his father's and grandfather's footsteps in the military, rose to the rank of squadron commander, but then resigned from the army. General Count Nansouty also had a nephew, Charles-Marie-√âtienne Champion Dubois de Nansouty (1815‚Äì1895), who saw a successful military career and who later rose to the rank of general of division. Considerations As a commander, General Nansouty is reported to have been a man of spirit but also to have had an excessive inclination towards sarcasm, which was damaging to his reputation and made him a number of enemies. His few months spent in Spain in 1808, where he commanded the orderly officers of the Emperor and the aides- de-camp of the senior generals of the General Staff, seem to have acquired him an unwanted reputation for mockery on the service, to such a point that one of his subordinates reported that \\"no one ever knew when he was joking and when he was serious.\\" When it came to military matters though, Nansouty's posture became extremely imposing, concise and tough. A perfectionist, with a keen eye and impeccable knowledge of his arm, he was shocked whenever he saw his cavalry manoeuvres mishandled and then he became sarcastic, at times even insulting his subordinates. However, whenever he went too far with his reprimands, he was noticeably displeased with himself and remorseful, trying to offer reparation to the person he had insulted. This behaviour seems to have been recurrent.Thoumas, pp. 28‚Äì29. His mood seems to have been particularly bad during his last days of service, in 1814, after he had received a number of light wounds in a short period of time, and foremost, after he had fallen out with the Emperor. During this period, he severely mistreated one of his squadron commanders for not executing his order fast enough, and even sacked his chief of staff, Colonel de la Loy√®re, for a minor fault. General Nansouty depicted in Horace Vernet's painting \\"Napoleon at Friedland\\" Nansouty's character as a proud and independent commander was apparent throughout his career and his conceitedly assertive nature, quite typical of the great cavalry commanders of the time, led to several clashes with his peers. At least one such incident almost led to a duel with another senior cavalry commander, in front of their men. It occurred on 11 July 1809, a few days after the Battle of Wagram, and opposed him to General Arrighi de Casanova, the commander of the 3rd heavy cavalry division. Both Nansouty and Arrighi adamantly claimed for their respective troops exclusive rights to use a small farm pond that they had found. Both men refused to give way and engaged in a heated argument, to such a point that they almost came to a duel in order to settle the matter. In the end, the more senior Nansouty won out and just after the incident, one of Arrighi's cuirassiers erected a sign sarcastically saying \\"Nansouty's pond\\".Arnold, p. 175. Indeed, at times, his sarcasm was directed even at his superiors, with Nansouty clashing with the more senior Grouchy at the Battle of Friedland. Nevertheless, Grouchy later recognised that the actions of Nansouty's division throughout the battle were \\"glorious\\".Thoumas, p. 25. In 1809, Nansouty famously responded to Napoleon's criticism after the Battle of Wagram by saying: \\"It is not Your Majesty at any rate who can teach me how to handle cavalry.\\" Three years later, during the campaign in Russia, when Murat, King of Naples complained to him about the lack of resistance of the horses, Nansouty retorted: \\"Oh yes, Sire, this is because they lack patriotism.\\"Thoumas, p. 39. At the Battle of Craonne, in 1814, one day before resigning, he was recorded to have refused to execute Napoleon's order to assault a redoubt, a move which he saw as a death sentence to his men. Instead, Nansouty told the Emperor: \\"I am going alone. There is nothing but death there and I will not lead these brave soldiers to it.\\" His behaviour on campaign can only be described as perfectly honourable and at times humane, a trait which was illustrated during the French Revolutionary Wars, when he spared no effort to protect captured √©migr√©s from the wrath of the Revolutionary radicals in the army. He also showed respect for occupied populations and never tolerated pillaging nor violence from his men. As a sign a gratitude, he was offered gifts several times but he was often seen refusing and sending them back. While on campaign in Tyrol, he was recorded to have accepted a large sum of money but he immediately distributed it to the local hospitals. Further evidence of his humanity was the care that he displayed for the lives and well-being of his men, whom he was always reluctant to sacrifice for the sake of glory.Courcelles, pp. 146‚Äì147. Overall as a heavy cavalry commander, Nansouty was one of the best men available during the Napoleonic Wars. Precise, methodical, with perfect knowledge of cavalry tactics, he was better than any other in preparing his attack dispositions. He was however less daring than the likes of Lasalle, Montbrun or Kellermann, which did not prevent him from leading some of the most memorable cavalry charges of the Napoleonic Wars.Thoumas, p. 13. It has also been said that he reacted with \\"calculated slowness\\" when placed under the command of Murat. His talents for up-keeping and training his troops seemed to surpass that of his peers. This was illustrated right from the start of the Napoleonic Wars, with the organisation of the cavalry reserve in the Grande Arm√©e, under Marshal Murat. The command of the various units of this reserve was given to some of the best cavalry commanders available, including Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul, Louis Klein, Marc Antoine de Beaumont, Fr√©d√©ric Henri Walther, Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers and √âdouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud. Despite the fame and quality of these commanders, it was Nansouty's six-regiment division that acquired the reputation of being the best serviced and most exact in its manoeuvres. He was also a commander who had his men continually manoeuvre during a battle, believing that this would distract them from the danger that they were facing.Courcelles, p. 147. Nansouty's battlefield talents were demonstrated through superb charges at Austerlitz, Friedland, Eckm√ºhl, Essling, Borodino, Hanau, Montmirail, Vauchamps or Craonne, thus contributing to some of the most glorious victories of the French Empire and eliciting comparisons with the superb Prussian cavalry commander Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz.Thoumas, p. 58.

History Law Society of Ireland was established on 24 June 1830 with premises at Inns Quay, Dublin. In November 1830, the committee of the Society submitted a memorial to the benchers as to the ‚Äònecessity and propriety‚Äô of erecting chambers for the use of solicitors with the funds that solicitors had been levied to pay to King's Inns over the years.Talk:Law Society of Ireland#cite note-1 The committee requested that the hall and chambers for the use of solicitors should be erected away from the King's Inns, and apartments in the Four Courts were allotted by the King's Inns to solicitors in May 1841. However, the adequacy of that accommodation at the Four Courts was to be a bone of contention between the Society and the benchers for 30 years.‚ÄòLaw Society of Ireland ‚Äì 1852-2002: Portrait of a Profession‚Äô, by Dr Eamonn G Hall and Da√≠re Hogan, (Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2002)(pp32, 40) The first president, Josiah Dunn, was elected in 1842. In accordance with the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Ireland) 1877, anyone admitted as solicitors or attorneys were, from then on, to be referred to as solicitors of the Court of Judicature (although the title of attorney lives on in the designation of the chief law officer of the State as the Attorney General).Law Society of Ireland ‚Äì 1852-2002: Portrait of a Profession‚Äô, by Dr Eamonn G Hall and Da√≠re Hogan, (Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2002)(p59) Incorporation by Royal Charter Law Society building after a snowstorm. November 2010 The Law Society was incorporated by royal charter obtained from Queen Victoria on 5 April 1852 under the name of \\"the Incorporated Society of Attorneys and Solicitors of Ireland\\".

At the end of the 19th century, the legal functions of the Law Society were substantially increased by the Solicitors (Ireland) Act 1898, which repealed the act of 1866 and transferred control of education and important disciplinary functions from the direct supervision of the judges to that of the Society. In 1888, the constitution of the Council of the Society was changed by supplemental charter, which provided that the Northern Law Society and Southern Law Association would each be entitled to appoint members to the Council. This was further changed in 1960, when provision was made for the appointment to the Council of three members of the Dublin Solicitors‚Äô Bar Association Council.Law Society of Ireland ‚Äì 1852-2002: Portrait of a Profession‚Äô, by Dr Eamonn G Hall and Da√≠re Hogan, (Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2002)(p43-56) The professions of attorney and solicitor were fused under the Supreme Court of Judicature (Ireland) Act, 1877. As a consequence, the Law Society was granted a supplemental charter, again by Queen Victoria on 14 December 1888 under which the Law Society was styled the \\"Incorporated Law Society of Ireland\\". The current statutory basis for the Law Society is set out in the Solicitors Acts 1954 ‚Äì 2002. In 1994, the Law Society's name was changed once more, this time the word \\"Incorporated\\" (in Irish: \\"Corpraithe\\") being omitted from its title. Acquiring Blackhall Place By the middle of the 1960s, the solicitors‚Äô buildings at the Four Courts were proving inadequate for the expanding activities of the Society and outside premises were used for lectures for students. A special committee recommended the purchase of the premises of King's Hospital, Blackhall Place, described by renowned architectural historian, Maurice Craig, as \\"one of the most beautiful and, in its way, original\\" of Dublin's major buildings.Law Society of Ireland ‚Äì 1852-2002: Portrait of a Profession‚Äô, by Dr Eamonn G Hall and Da√≠re Hogan, (Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2002)(p123) Council member of the Law Society, Peter Prentice, proposed a motion at a special meeting of the Council on 3 July 1968 (seconded by John Jermyn) that the Society purchase the King's Hospital for the sum of IR¬£105,000.

Structure The governing body of the Law Society is its Council. It comprises both elected and nominated members, all of whom are solicitors. Over the years the Council has established a range of committees to which it delegates certain of its statutory functions. The Council may comprise not more than 48 persons. Of its membership, between 21 and 31 must be elected from among the Law Society's members. A delegate from each of the four provinces of Ireland must also be chosen. Up to five extraordinary members may be appointed from each of the Councils of the Southern Law Association and the Law Society of Northern Ireland while three may be appointed from the Council of the Dublin Solicitors' Bar Association. As of 2009, the Law Society's Council comprised forty-eight members, being the maximum permitted. Annually they select one of their number as president. That term of office runs from early November to early November of the following year. =List of presidents since 1842= { width=\\"95%\\" - valign=top  style= width=\\"33%\\"  *1842‚Äì1848 Josias Dunn *1848‚Äì1860 William Goddard *1860‚Äì1876 Sir Richard J.
