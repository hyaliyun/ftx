Early life Stark Young was born on October 11, 1881 in Como, Mississippi. His father, Alfred Alexander Young, was a physician. His mother, Mary Clark Starks, was a direct descendant of the McGehees, an old planter family; she died when he was nine years old. Shortly after her death, Young was sent to live at the McGehee Plantation in Senatobia, Mississippi. Young entered the University of Mississippi at the age of 15 and graduated from that institution in 1901. He completed his Master's Degree at Columbia University in New York in 1902. Career Young taught at the University of Mississippi in 1905-1907, and then moved to the University of Texas at Austin. There he established the Texas Review and became involved with theater. In 1915 he moved to Amherst College in Massachusetts, where he taught English until 1921. He resigned to pursue other interests and moved to New York City. In New York, he was appointed as an editor of Theater Arts Magazine and as drama critic for The New Republic. Young worked at The New Republic until his retirement in 1947. During this period he was also professionally involved with the theater in New York and wrote several plays. Young's plays include: Guenevere, Addio, Madretta, At The Shrine, The Star In The Trees, Twilight Saint, The Dead Poet, The Seven Kings and the Wind, and The Queen of Sheba, to name a few. In 1926 Stark Young wrote his first novel Heaven Trees. In 1930, Young contributed to the agrarian manifesto, I'll Take My Stand. He was one of 12 Southern writers, a group including Allen Tate, known as the Southern Agrarians. Young drew on the traditions of his Southern upbringing for inspiration. He wrote essays, journalistic articles, and collections of stories that drew on these sources. He also published four novels dealing with Southern themes. So Red the Rose (1934), perhaps Young's finest novel, had a brief period of popularity as the archetype of the Southern Civil War novel and dealt with the aftermath of the war. In 1935, his novel was adapted as a film of the same name directed by King Vidor and starring Margaret Sullavan. Described by its author as a novel of the affections, the book is still in print. The phenomenal successes of Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind (1936) and its film adaptation of 1939 pushed Young's book into the background. Young translated a number of plays by Anton Chekhov, including The Sea Gull, Uncle Vanya, The Three Sisters, and The Cherry Orchard, all of which were published in 1956 by The Modern Library as Best Plays by Chekhov. In the 1940s Young, a self-taught artist, began painting. He had two one-man exhibitions in New York. His paintings were shown in four important venues, including the Art Institute of Chicago, which purchased one of his works for its permanent collection. In 1951 Young published his memoir, The Pavilion, dedicated to his friend Allen Tate. Young was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame, as well as the New York University Hall of Fame. He was the recipient of Creative Arts Medallion from Brandeis University and the Southeastern Theatre Conference's Distinguished Career Award. Additionally, he received the Order of the Crown of Italy for a series of lectures on American theater. He gave them in Italian as a Westinghouse Lecturer in Italy. He served on the board of New York University and was a theater critic for the New York Times. Death Young suffered a stroke in May 1959 and died four years later. He was buried in Friendship Cemetery in Como, Mississippi. References External links Finding aid to Stark Young manuscripts at Columbia University.

He was one of the most prominent organists and composers of his generation. Biography Bruhns was born in Schwabstedt (Danish: Svavsted), a small settlement near Husum. He came from a family of musicians and composers. His grandfather, Paul Jakob Bruhns (died 1655), worked as lutenist in L√ºbeck. His three sons all chose musical careers; Bruhns' father, also named Paul (1640‚Äìc. 1689), became organist at Schwabstedt, possibly after studying with Franz Tunder. Nicolaus was apparently a child prodigy: according to Ernst Ludwig Gerber, he could play the organ and compose competent works for keyboard and voice already at an early age. He probably received his first music lessons from his father. At age sixteen, Bruhns, together with his younger brother Georg (1666-1742), was sent to L√ºbeck to live with their uncle Peter, who would teach Bruhns the violin and the viola da gamba. The two brothers also studied the organ and composition; Georg under Bernhard Olffen, organist of St. Aegidien, and Nicolaus under Dieterich Buxtehude. The latter, one of the best composers of his time, was so impressed with Bruhns' talents and progress that he considered him his best pupil and eventually recommended him for Copenhagen. There Bruhns worked as organist and violinist. On 29 March 1689 he competed for the position of organist of the Stadtkirche in Husum and was unanimously accepted. In a few months he was offered a position at Kiel, but declined when the authorities at Husum increased his salary. Bruhns remained in Husum until his untimely death in 1697, at the age of 31. His only son, Johan Paul, chose a career in theology. Bruhns was succeeded in Husum by his brother Georg. Works Bruhns' surviving oeuvre is unfortunately small: only 12 vocal and 5 organ pieces are extant. The vocal works include four sacred concertos that established a new level of virtuosity in the genre, and three sacred madrigal cantatas that represent a direct link with the next century and the work of Johann Sebastian Bach. Although the instrumental writing in most of these works suggests that Bruhns could only rely on musicians of average skill, there are movements, such as the opening sonatina of the solo cantata Mein Herz ist bereit, that feature highly developed, virtuosic textures. Bruhns almost certainly wrote chamber music, which may have been of the same high quality, but none of these works survive. The organ works comprise four praeludia and a chorale fantasia on the hymn \\"Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland\\". The most significant of these pieces is the larger of the two E minor praeludia, which is usually cited as one of the greatest works of the North German organ tradition. Although Johann Sebastian Bach's son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach claimed that his father admired and studied Bruhns' work, no direct influence has been traced by scholars.

He served President Richard Nixon in various capacities, including acting as deputy director of the president's 1972 re-election campaign, Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP). In August 1973, Magruder pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to wiretap, obstruct justice and defraud the United States. He served seven months in federal prison. Magruder later attended Princeton Theological Seminary and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister. He spoke publicly about ethics and his role in the Watergate scandal. In the 1990s and early 2000s, he gave interviews in which he changed his accounts of actions by various participants in the Watergate coverup, including claiming that President Richard Nixon ordered the break-ins. Early life Jeb Stuart Magruder was born and grew up on Staten Island, New York. His father, a Civil War buff, named him for Confederate general J.E.B. Stuart.Martin, Douglas \\"Jeb Magruder, 79, Nixon Aide Jailed for Watergate, Dies\\" https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/17/us/jeb-magruder-79-nixon-aide-jailed-for- watergate-dies.html He was an honor student at Curtis High School. Magruder was an excellent junior tennis player and swimmer, among the best in the greater New York area.Magruder, p. 17 He earned a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1958 from Williams College, where he competed on the varsity swimming team and set several regional records.Magruder, pp. 18-29 During an intermission from college, he served in the U.S. Army for 21 months, and was stationed in South Korea.Magruder, pp. 21‚Äì24 He earned a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Chicago.Magruder, p. 36 Magruder worked for IBM after college. He moved to San Francisco to take a position with the Crown Zellerbach firm, where he worked in its sales and marketing department. Later he started his own consumer products company. Marriage and family He married Gail Barnes Nicholas on October 17, 1959, in Brentwood, California.Magruder, pp. 29‚Äì33 The couple had four children. They were divorced in 1984. Magruder married Patricia Newton on February 28, 1987, in Columbus, Ohio. They were divorced in May 2003. Business career and politics In the late 1950s, Magruder moved to Kansas City with Jewel Tea, in a transfer for work. He became involved there as a campaign manager for the Republican Party during the 1960 election campaign, working as chairman of an urban ward.Magruder, p. 35 Magruder moved to Chicago for his MBA studies. Afterward he shifted from IBM to the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton. In Chicago he remained involved with the Republican Party. His first major political job was managing the successful 1962 primary campaign of Donald Rumsfeld for the Republican nomination to the United States House of Representatives, preparing for the election in Illinois' 13th congressional district. Rumsfeld won the primary and the seat in Congress, in a major upset in a ward traditionally dominated by Democrats and unions. The win catapulted Magruder into the early ranks of young political technocrats who used data and analytics to engineer campaigns, and it caught the attention of the Republican party machine.Magruder, pp. 37‚Äì39 In 1962 Magruder moved from Booz Allen Hamilton to Jewel, a regional grocery firm. During his nearly four years with them, he was promoted to merchandise manager.Magruder, pp. 41‚Äì43 Magruder became involved with the Illinois organization of the Barry Goldwater presidential campaign in late 1963, but became disillusioned with Goldwater's political views.Magruder, pp. 43‚Äì45 He worked briefly as campaign manager for Richard Ogilvie's 1966 campaign for president of the Cook County Board of Supervisors. The political workload, combined with work pressures, caused Magruder to end employment with Jewel. He relocated to California in mid-1966, to begin a higher level job with the Broadway Stores company.Magruder, pp. 46‚Äì51 Magruder's next political involvement started in mid-1967, when he served as Southern California coordinator for the Richard Nixon presidential campaign. He left early in 1968 due to internal organizational problems.Magruder, 51‚Äì54 Magruder entered partnership during early 1969 with two other entrepreneurs to start two new businesses, and became president and chief executive officer of these firms.Magruder, pp. 54‚Äì55 Joins White House staff Magruder, while working in Los Angeles as a business executive, was approached through Republican acquaintances and asked to interview to join the White House staff. He was appointed to the White House staff in 1969 at age 34, as special assistant to the president. He moved with his family to Washington, D.C.Magruder, pp. 9-10 He worked for Nixon operatives H.R. Haldeman and Herbert G. Klein, communications director for the Executive Branch. Magruder's formal title was deputy director of White House Communications. =Committee to Re-elect the President= Magruder served in the White House until the spring of 1971, when he left to manage the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP, also known as CREEP), first as director. By early 1972 in the election year, Attorney General John N. Mitchell took over as director of CREEP and Magruder acted as his deputy. As Mitchell became preoccupied with a scandal involving the ITT Corporation and by his efforts to restrain his outspoken wife Martha, Magruder took on more of the management of the CREEP.H.R. Haldeman, The Ends of Power, New York: New York Times Books, 1978, p.9 The campaign to re-elect the President was extraordinarily successful, winning 49 of 50 states; Nixon lost only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia to Democrat George McGovern. The final tally of Nixon's victory was 520 to 17 electoral votes, the second largest Electoral College (United States) margin in history up until then, after Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1936 victory over Alf Landon, (523 to 8). =Manages 1973 Inaugural= Magruder worked as inaugural director from October 1972 to arrange Richard Nixon's United States presidential inauguration ceremony and celebration in January 1973.Magruder, pp. 298‚Äì303 In March 1973, he began a job as director of policy planning with the United States Department of Commerce. He resigned soon afterward, as the Watergate scandal began to heat up and become scrutinized again by media following James McCord's disclosures of perjury during the original Watergate trial of the five burglars; the former Watergate burglar wrote about this to the Washington Star. Magruder, pp. 310‚Äì318 Watergate scandal Magruder, in his role with CREEP, was involved with the Watergate matters from an early stage, including its planning, execution, and cover-up. =Liddy plan= Magruder met with White House Counsel John Dean and John N. Mitchell (Attorney General of the United States and director of CREEP) on January 27 and February 4, 1972, to review preliminary plans by G. Gordon Liddy (Counsel to CREEP) for intelligence gathering ideas for the 1972 campaign. The Watergate burglaries would evolve from those meetings. From the day they met in December 1971, Magruder and Liddy (who had been hired by Mitchell and Dean) had a conflicted personal relationship.Magruder, pp. 185‚Äì197 =Cooperates with prosecutors= During April 1973, Magruder began cooperating with federal prosecutors. In exchange, Magruder was allowed to plead guilty in August 1973 to a one-count indictment of conspiracy to obstruct justice, to defraud the United States, and to illegally eavesdrop on the Democratic Party's national headquarters at the Watergate Hotel. On May 21, 1974, Magruder was sentenced by Judge John Sirica to ten months to four years for his role in the failed burglary of Watergate and the following cover-up. After his sentencing, Magruder said, \\"I am confident that this country will survive its Watergates and its Jeb Magruders.\\" In the end, he served seven months of his sentence (in a Federal prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania). Portrait of Jeb Stuart Magruder as a member of the Nixon Administration. Magruder originally testified that he knew nothing to indicate that President Nixon had any prior knowledge of the Watergate burglary. In his book, An American Life: One Man's Road to Watergate (1974), he wrote, > I know nothing to indicate that Nixon was aware in advance of the plan to > break into the Democratic headquarters. It is possible that Mitchell or > Haldeman told him in advance, but I think it's likelier that they would not > have mentioned it unless the operation had produced some results of interest > to him. This book was published before Magruder's sentencing on May 21, and before Nixon resigned as the president. Magruder had testified that he thought that he was helping establish a legal intelligence-gathering operation. In his book Magruder wrote about former attorney general John Mitchell and Fred LaRue meeting in late March 1972 in Key Biscayne, Florida. He wrote that Mitchell approved the plan to eavesdrop on the Watergate complex soon after this meeting.Magruder, pp. 210‚Äì215 After Watergate After his prison term, Magruder began a speaking tour on college campuses and in other public spaces, inspiring some critics to suggest he had profited from the scandal and his decision to turn state's evidence. He published a Christian-oriented memoir, From Power to Peace in 1976. He earned a Master of Divinity degree from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1981 and became ordained as a Presbyterian minister. He served as associate minister at the First Presbyterian Church in Burlingame, California and First Community Church of Columbus, Ohio. (While there, Magruder chaired that city's Commission on Ethics and Values for a time.) In May 1983, President Ronald Reagan denied a request from Magruder for a presidential pardon. In 1990 Magruder was called as senior pastor at the First Presbyterian Church of Lexington, Kentucky. In 1995, Kentucky Governor Brereton Jones reinstated Magruder's right to campaign for public office in the state. =Continued controversy= In 1990 Magruder consented to interviews with authors Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin while the two were conducting research for their 1991 book Silent Coup: The Removal of a President (St. Martin's Press). Magruder admitted that he had lied to prosecutors, to the Senate's Watergate Committee, and in his 1974 book An American Life: One Man's Road to Watergate, concerning aspects of the early cover-up. To Colodny and Gettlin, he said that he had called John Dean several hours after the (second) Watergate break-in was discovered, and that Dean set in motion several cover-up strategies. This version of events tallied closely with that of Gordon Liddy, as set out in his 1980 book Will. Books published earlier by others, however, such as Magruder's in 1974 and Dean's Blind Ambition (1976), had become the accepted 'truth' of the cover-up. These versions had very profound and damaging effects on the reputations of senior figures such as H.R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, and John N. Mitchell. To Colodny and Gettlin, Magruder admitted specifically instructing Liddy on the second Watergate break-in, something which he had earlier denied. At the time these interviews were conducted, Magruder was a Presbyterian minister in Columbus, Ohio.Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin, Silent Coup: The Removal of a President, New York: St. Martin's Press, 1991 In 2003 Magruder was interviewed again, by PBS researchers and the Associated Press. According to his account in a PBS documentary, Watergate Plus 30: Shadow of History, and in an interview with the Associated Press, he asserted that Nixon knew about the Watergate burglary early in the process, and well before the scandal broke. During the 2003 interviews, Magruder said that he had attended a meeting with Mitchell on March 30, 1972, at which he heard Nixon tell Mitchell by telephone to begin the Watergate plan. This account, however, has been contested by Fred LaRue. LaRue, who was the only other person present at the meeting in which the alleged telephone call from Nixon to Mitchell occurred, has said that no telephone call from Nixon to Mitchell took place during this meeting. Magruder was the only direct participant of the scandal to claim that President Nixon had specific prior knowledge of the Watergate burglary, and that Nixon directed Mitchell to proceed with the burglary. These statements contradicted Magruder's earlier accounts that the cover-up had reached no higher in the Administration than Mitchell. In his 1974 book, Magruder had said that the only telephone call from the White House during this meeting came from H.R. Haldeman's aide, Gordon C. Strachan. Sixteen years later, in the August 7, 1990 interview with Colodny and Gettlin, Magruder changed his account, claiming that the telephone call from the White House came from Haldeman himself. In 2003, Magruder changed his account again, saying that President Nixon had telephoned Mitchell at the Key Biscayne meeting. Later years On July 23, 2007, Magruder was hospitalized after crashing his car into a motorcycle and a truck on State Route 315 in Columbus Ohio. It was later reported that Magruder had suffered a stroke while driving. He was charged with failure to maintain an assured clear distance and failure to stop after an accident or collision. Magruder pleaded guilty in January 2008 to a charge of reckless operation stemming from the crashes with two vehicles in July. His license was suspended and he was fined $300. =Death= Magruder died in Danbury, Connecticut, at age 79 on May 11, 2014, due to complications from a stroke.

In mathematics, a reflection (also spelled reflexion)\\"Reflexion\\" is an archaic spelling. is a mapping from a Euclidean space to itself that is an isometry with a hyperplane as a set of fixed points; this set is called the axis (in dimension 2) or plane (in dimension 3) of reflection. The image of a figure by a reflection is its mirror image in the axis or plane of reflection. For example the mirror image of the small Latin letter p for a reflection with respect to a vertical axis would look like q. Its image by reflection in a horizontal axis would look like b. A reflection is an involution: when applied twice in succession, every point returns to its original location, and every geometrical object is restored to its original state. The term reflection is sometimes used for a larger class of mappings from a Euclidean space to itself, namely the non-identity isometries that are involutions. Such isometries have a set of fixed points (the \\"mirror\\") that is an affine subspace, but is possibly smaller than a hyperplane. For instance a reflection through a point is an involutive isometry with just one fixed point; the image of the letter p under it would look like a d. This operation is also known as a central inversion , and exhibits Euclidean space as a symmetric space. In a Euclidean vector space, the reflection in the point situated at the origin is the same as vector negation. Other examples include reflections in a line in three-dimensional space. Typically, however, unqualified use of the term \\"reflection\\" means reflection in a hyperplane. A figure that does not change upon undergoing a reflection is said to have reflectional symmetry. Some mathematicians use \\"flip\\" as a synonym for \\"reflection\\". Construction Point is the reflection of point through the line . In a plane (or, respectively, 3-dimensional) geometry, to find the reflection of a point drop a perpendicular from the point to the line (plane) used for reflection, and extend it the same distance on the other side. To find the reflection of a figure, reflect each point in the figure. To reflect point through the line using compass and straightedge, proceed as follows (see figure): * Step 1 (red): construct a circle with center at and some fixed radius to create points and on the line , which will be equidistant from . * Step 2 (green): construct circles centered at and having radius . and will be the points of intersection of these two circles. Point is then the reflection of point through line . Properties rotation around the point of intersection of the axes, by an angle twice the angle between the axes. The matrix for a reflection is orthogonal with determinant ‚àí1 and eigenvalues ‚àí1, 1, 1, ..., 1. The product of two such matrices is a special orthogonal matrix that represents a rotation. Every rotation is the result of reflecting in an even number of reflections in hyperplanes through the origin, and every improper rotation is the result of reflecting in an odd number. Thus reflections generate the orthogonal group, and this result is known as the Cartan‚ÄìDieudonn√© theorem. Similarly the Euclidean group, which consists of all isometries of Euclidean space, is generated by reflections in affine hyperplanes. In general, a group generated by reflections in affine hyperplanes is known as a reflection group. The finite groups generated in this way are examples of Coxeter groups. Reflection across a line in the plane Reflection across a line through the origin in two dimensions can be described by the following formula :\\\\operatorname{Ref}_l(v) = 2\\\\frac{v \\\\cdot l}{l \\\\cdot l}l - v, where v denotes the vector being reflected, l denotes any vector in the line across which the reflection is performed, and v\\\\cdot l denotes the dot product of v with l. Note the formula above can also be written as :\\\\operatorname{Ref}_l(v) = 2\\\\operatorname{Proj}_l(v) - v, saying that a reflection of v across l is equal to 2 times the projection of v on l, minus the vector v. Reflections in a line have the eigenvalues of 1, and ‚àí1. Reflection through a hyperplane in n dimensions Given a vector v in Euclidean space \\\\mathbb R^n, the formula for the reflection in the hyperplane through the origin, orthogonal to a, is given by :\\\\operatorname{Ref}_a(v) = v - 2\\\\frac{v\\\\cdot a}{a\\\\cdot a}a, where v\\\\cdot a denotes the dot product of v with a. Note that the second term in the above equation is just twice the vector projection of v onto a. One can easily check that *, if v is parallel to a, and *, if v is perpendicular to . Using the geometric product, the formula is :\\\\operatorname{Ref}_a(v) = -\\\\frac{a v a}{a^2} . Since these reflections are isometries of Euclidean space fixing the origin they may be represented by orthogonal matrices. The orthogonal matrix corresponding to the above reflection is the matrix whose entries are :R_{ij} = \\\\delta_{ij} - 2\\\\frac{a_i a_j}{ \\\\left\\\\ a \\\\right\\\\ ^2 }, where is the Kronecker delta. The formula for the reflection in the affine hyperplane v\\\\cdot a=c not through the origin is :\\\\operatorname{Ref}_{a,c}(v) = v - 2\\\\frac{v \\\\cdot a - c}{a\\\\cdot a}a.

The stated aim of the League was the development of its members into Communists, through studying Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and through active participation in the struggles of the American working class. The YCL recognized the Communist Party USA as the party for socialism in the United States and operated as the Party's youth wing.Constitution of the YCL Although the name of the group changed a number of times during its existence, its origins trace back to 1920, shortly after the establishment of the first communist parties in the United States. Although independent, in its final years the organization came under direct control of the CPUSA. After a backlash by members towards the suspension of elections and ideological shifts towards the right, membership plummeted. On November 14, 2015, the CPUSA's National Committee voted to suspend funding to the Young Communist League and the organization was subsequently dissolved. In 2019, in the 39th party convention, the organization was re-established.  History  =Early years= The 1920 split of the Socialist Party of America affected its youth section as well, the Young People's Socialist League (YPSL). The YPSL declared itself an independent organization in the fall of 1919, sympathetic to the left wing which had been expelled or left the party. A portion of this \\"Independent Young People's Socialist League\\" organization dropped out from activity during this period, while the group's officials, including in the first place Executive Secretary Oliver Carlson, attempted to steer the group to a position of neutrality between the two warring factions of American communism, the Communist Party of America and the Communist Labor Party of America. The underground period As early as 1920, a skeleton of a \\"Young People's Communist League\\" was in existence. This minuscule, largely paper organization sent a fraternal delegate to the 2nd Convention of the United Communist Party, held at Kingston, New York from December 24, 1920 to January 2, 1921. A report was delivered by this delegate on the youth situation in America and the convention at this time first decided to establish a serious youth section, to be called the Young Communist League. The resolution passed by the convention pledged the UCP would provide its youth section assistance by helping to produce and distribute its literature, by helping to gain control of existing units of the Independent YPSL and organizing them into communist groups, by helping to organize new units, by providing it financial assistance, by lending it speakers and teachers, and by allotting it space in the official party periodicals.Department of Justice/Bureau of Investigation Investigative Files, NARA collection M-1085, reel 940, document 679. Downloadable pdf The establishment of a parallel \\"aboveground\\" to the technically illegal YCL was called for. Owing to government pressure from the Palmer Raids of the first red scare, the entire communist movement in America had operated a clandestine model of organization, akin to that of the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party prior to the Russian Revolution. The YCL was no different, its leaders and members making use of pseudonyms and holding their meetings in secret. This did not mean that there was no national convention of the organization. The founding convention of the YCL was held early in May 1922, apparently in Bethel, Connecticut. It was a small and low key gathering, including just fourteen delegates from four of the Communist Party's twelve national districts. The gathering heard a report from Max Bedacht of the adult party dealing with the discussions and decisions of the 3rd World Congress of the Communist International and its February 1922 special conference. The convention adopted a constitution and a program for the YCL, as well as a resolution delineating the relationship of the youth league with the adult party. A governing National Executive Committee of five members was elected. The initiation fee to join the YCL was 50 cents and dues were 25 cents per month, receipted with stamps issued by the National Office. The basic unit of organization was the \\"group\\" consisting, ideally, of from five to ten members and meeting at least every other week. Groups elected their own captains to coordinate their activities with the center. Multiple groups were parts of a \\"section\\" of up to five groups; multiple sections were part of a \\"sub- district,\\" which was in turn a subdivision of the regular geographic \\"districts\\" of the Communist Party.Comintern Archive, RGASPI, f. 515, op. 1, d. 152, ll. 10, 12. The underground form of organization made it very difficult to attract and hold quality recruits ‚Äì recruiting had to be by word of mouth, literature distribution surreptitious, advertising of meetings non- existent. Accordingly, very little progress was made in building the size and effectiveness of the organization. This underground YCL continued in existence until early 1923, when it was terminated together with the underground adult Communist Party, leaving the \\"overground\\" youth and adult groups as the only remaining organizations. Establishment of the \\"overground\\" organization Logo of the YWL, established in 1922. For the young communist youth, this organization was the Young Workers League of America (YWL), established in 1922. As was the case with the corresponding adult organization, the \\"legal\\" YWL had a much easier time establishing itself. By removing from it literature some references to revolution, the YWL was able to meet in the open, to advertise its events, and to distribute its newspapers, leaflets, and pamphlets with only minimal interference from the legal authorities. Consequently, it was able to attract a steady stream of new devotees to the cause ‚Äì although, as was the case with the adult party, retention of its new recruits always remained problematic. The YWL was also bolstered, as was its adult counterpart, by the addition of a new mass of members coming into the organization from the Finnish Socialist Federation ‚Äì the largest foreign language federation of the Socialist Party, which had been biding its time as an independent organization since 1921, waiting for an end to the ineffectual underground form of organization. In the middle 1920s, the Workers Party of America was approximately 40% Finnish-American ‚Äì and its youth section was no exception to this trend. The founding convention of the YWL was held in Brooklyn, New York from May 13 to 15, 1922, held appropriately enough at Finnish Socialist Hall. Oliver Carlson delivered the keynote speech to the thirty regular and five fraternal delegates. Carlson claimed a presence for the nascent YWL in forty-six cities and a membership of \\"at the very least,\\" 2,200. The convention approved a manifesto, program, constitution, and various resolutions. Membership in the organization was said to be open to \\"all proletarians\\" between the ages of fourteen and thirty. The basic unit of organization of the YWL was the \\"branch,\\" consisting of at least five but no more than one hundred and fifty members. Two or more branches in a single large city were to form a \\"City Central Committee\\" to coordinate their activities, and all units were to be part of the regular array of districts used by the adult party. The initiation fee was 25 cents and dues 25 cents per month, with all initiation fees and 10 cents of every month's dues going to support the National Office.Oliver Carlson, \\"Our First Convention,\\" The Young Worker, v. 1, no. 4 (June‚ÄìJuly 1922), pg. 20. The organization was governed by a National Executive Committee of seven members, of whom at least five were to live in a single locale. Chicago was set as the headquarters city for the organization, a change from the group's provisional base of operations in New York. Martin Abern was elected as National Secretary of the organization, Oliver Carlson was named as editor, and the pair were joined on the NEC by business manager Harry Gannes, treasurer Gus Schulenburg, and future fixture of the 1930s American radical movement Herbert Zam. The name of the youth league ultimately followed the name of the adult party, becoming the Young Workers (Communist) League in 1926 when the Workers Party became the \\"Workers (Communist) Party\\" and to the Young Communist League, USA in 1929 when the adult party became the \\"Communist Party, USA.\\" =The depression decade and after= The turn toward the Popular Front initiated a period of the YCL's greatest growth and it may have had as many as 12,000 members in New York City alone by 1939. On October 17, 1943, the YCL convened in national convention in New York City, passed a resolution dissolving itself, and immediately reconvened under a new organizational name, the American Youth for Democracy (AYD).Special Committee on Un-American Activities, House of Representatives, Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix ‚Äî Part IX, Communist Front Organizations... Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1944; pg. 564. This predated a similar move transforming the adult Communist Party, USA into the \\"Communist Political Association\\" by seven months. The change of names proved to be strictly semantic, as all important positions within the \\"new\\" AYD were held by former members of the YCL. National Executive Secretary of the AYD at the time of its October 1943 launch was Carl Ross, the former head of the YCL for a period of more than five years. It followed the CPUSA into dissolution, reconstituting itself as American Youth for Democracy (AYD). It retained that name even after the CPUSA reformed in 1946, until contributing toward the youth organization of the Progressive Party, the Young Progressives of America. The CPUSA reestablished a youth organization in 1949 as the Labor Youth League, which dissolved in the dissension following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the 20th Congress of the CPSU. In 1965, after a period of mainly local activity, the DuBois Clubs were formed and later renamed the Young Workers Liberation League before reaffirming the original name Young Communist League in 1984. =The dissolution of the YCL= After the restoration of capitalism in the Warsaw Pact countries, the YCL and the Party experienced a decrease in membership. However, after the contested election of George W. Bush as president of the United States and the escalation of militarism, membership began to rise again. The YCL experienced a rapid growth in membership after the 2008 elections, largely due to the prominent role played by youth in the election of Barack Obama and the fact that his opponents criticized his pro- labor rhetoric as \\"socialist.\\" Membership has continued to grow with an increase of youth feeling disillusioned by a perceived lack of progress under the Obama administration. YCL members argued that the organization operated in cities and rural areas across the country. It organizes national schools and conferences based in Chicago, Illinois. According to its constitution, \\"The YCL is devoted to the interests of all young people and is dedicated to the revolutionary cause of the working class of our country, the transformation of the United States through mass democratic struggle into a socialist society.\\" In the years immediately preceding its dissolution, YCL members argued in the CPUSA and YCL press that the group had experienced a rapid rate of expansion and had thus opened chapters all over the country. This rapid influx of membership increasingly led towards a more radical and militant base which led to conflict with the CPUSA, which had a more liberal, pro-Democratic Party stance. In response, the CPUSA absorbed and dissolved the YCL, prompting many clubs to leave and become independent or realign with other communist groups, such as the Red Guards. = Re-establishment = In 2019 a resolution at the 31st National Convention of the CPUSA was passed which called to re-establish the Young Communist League. In 2020 the YCL was officially re-established by the CPUSA.  See also  * W.E.B.

This is termed poverty of speech or laconic speech. \\"laconic speech Condition characterized by a reduction in the quantity of spontaneous speech; replies to questions are brief and unelaborated, and little or no unprompted additional information is provided. Occurs in major depression, schizophrenia, and organic mental disorders. Also called poverty of speech.\\" The amount of speech may be normal, but conveys little information because the phrases are vague, empty, stereotyped, overconcrete, overabstract, or repetitive. \\"poverty of content of speech Speech that is adequate in amount but conveys little information because of vagueness, emptiness, or stereotyped phrases.\\" This is termed poverty of content or poverty of content of speech. Under Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms used in clinical research, thought blocking is considered a part of alogia, and so is increased latency in response. This condition is associated with schizophrenia, dementia, severe depression, and autism. \\"poverty of ideas a thought disturbance, often associated with schizophrenia, dementia, and severe depression. ....\\" As a symptom, it is commonly seen in patients suffering from schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder, and is traditionally considered a negative symptom. It can complicate psychotherapy severely because of the considerable difficulty in holding a fluent conversation. The alternative meaning of alogia is inability to speak because of dysfunction in the central nervous system, \\"alogia n. inability to speak because of dysfunction in the central nervous system. In a less severe form, it is sometimes referred to as dyslogia.\\" found in mental deficiency and dementia. \\"alogia Inability to speak because of mental deficiency or an episode of dementia.\\" In this sense, the word is synonymous with aphasia, and in less severe form, it is sometimes called dyslogia. The rest of the article focuses on the first meaning.  Characteristics  Alogia may be on a continuum with normal behaviors. People without mental illness may have it occasionally including when fatigued or disinhibited, when writers use language creatively, when people in certain disciplinessuch as politicians, administrators, philosophers, ministers, and scientistsuse language pedantically, or in people with intelligence or little education. Hence, deciding if an individual has alogia depends on contextual clues. Is the person in control? Can the person moderate the effect if asked to be speciÔ¨Åc or concise? Is it better with another topic? Are there other significant symptoms? Alogia is characterized by a lack of speech, often caused by a disruption in the thought process. Usually, an injury to the left side of the brain may cause alogia to appear in an individual. While in conversation, alogic patients will reply very sparsely and their answers to questions will lack spontaneous content; sometimes, they will even fail to answer at all. Their responses will be brief, generally only appearing as a response to a question or prompt. Apart from the lack of content in a reply, the manner in which the person delivers the reply is affected as well. Patients affected by alogia will often slur their responses, and not pronounce the consonants as clearly as usual. The few words spoken usually trail off into a whisper, or are just ended by the second syllable. Studies have shown a correlation between alogic ratings in individuals and the amount and duration of pauses in their speech when responding to a series of questions posed by the researcher. The inability to speak stems from a deeper mental inability that causes alogic patients to have difficulty grasping the right words mentally, as well as formulating their thoughts. A study investigating alogiacs and their results on the category fluency task showed that people with schizophrenia who exhibit alogia display a more disorganized semantic memory than controls. While both groups produced the same number of words, the words produced by people with schizophrenia were much more disorderly and the results of cluster analysis revealed bizarre coherence in the alogiac group. If the condition is assessed using a language other than the individual's primary language, the medical professional needs to make sure that the problem is not from language barriers. This condition is associated with schizophrenia, dementia, and severe depression. \\"poverty of ideas a thought disturbance, often associated with schizophrenia, dementia, and severe depression. ....\\" Example The following table shows an example of \\"poverty of speech\\" which shows replies to questions that are brief and concrete, with a reduction in spontaneous speech: { border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" + Example of \\"poverty of speech\\" \\"This is a restriction in the amount of spontaneous speech so that replies to questions tend to be brief, concrete, and unelaborated.

The girl is thirteen and the boy ten.\\" \\"Two\\" is all that is required to answer the question, and the rest of the reply is additional information. \\" ----- -----  align=\\"center\\"  Poverty of speech  align=\\"center\\"  Normal speech ----- valign=\\"top\\"  Q: Do you have any children?

Q: And the girl's? A: Alice.  Q: Do you have any children? A: Yes, a boy and a girl. Q: How old are they? A: Edmond is sixteen and Alice is six. } The following example of \\"poverty of content of speech\\" is a response from a patient when asked why he was in a hospital. Speech is vague, conveys little information, but is not grossly incoherent and the amount of speech is not reduced. \\"I often contemplate‚Äîit is a general stance of the world‚Äîit is a tendency which varies from time to time‚Äîit deÔ¨Ånes things more than others‚Äîit is in the nature of habit‚Äîthis is what I would like to say to explain everything.\\" Causes Alogia can be brought on by frontostriatal dysfunction which causes degradation of the semantic store, the center located in the temporal lobe that processes meaning in language. A subgroup of chronic schizophrenia patients in a word generation experiment generated fewer words than the unaffected subjects and had limited lexicons, evidence of the weakening of the semantic store. Another study found that when given the task of naming items in a category, schizophrenia patients displayed a great struggle but improved significantly when experimenters employed a second stimulus to guide behavior unconsciously. This conclusion was similar to results produced from patients with Huntington's and Parkinson's disease, ailments which also involve frontostriatal dysfunction. Treatment Medical studies conclude that certain adjunctive drugs effectively palliate the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, mainly alogia. In one study, Maprotiline produced the greatest reduction in alogia symptoms with severity reduction in 50% of patients (out of 10). Of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, alogia had the second best responsiveness to the drugs, surpassed only by attention deficiency. D-amphetamine is another drug that has been tested on people with schizophrenia and found success in alleviating negative symptoms. This treatment, however, has not been developed greatly as it seems to have adverse effects on other aspects of schizophrenia such as increasing the severity of positive symptoms. Relation to schizophrenia Although alogia is found as a symptom in a variety of health disorders, it is most commonly found as a negative symptom of schizophrenia. Previous studies and analyses conclude that at least three factors are needed to cover both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia; the three are: psychotic, disorganization, and negative symptom factors. Studies suggest that an inappropriate affect is strongly associated with bizarre behavior and positive formal thought disorder on a disorganization factor; attention impairment correlates significantly with psychotic, disorganization, and negative symptom factors. Alogia contains both positive and negative symptoms, with the poverty of content of speech as the disorganization factor, and poverty of speech, response latency, and thought blocking as the negative symptom factors. Alogia is a major diagnostic sign of schizophrenia, when organic mental disorders have been excluded. In schizophrenia, negative symptoms including flattening of affect, avolition, and alogia are responsible for the considerable morbidity of the disease compared with other psychotic disorders. Negative symptoms are common in the prodromal and residual phases of the disease and can be severe. During the first year, negative symptoms can progress, especially alogia, which may start off from a relatively low rate. Within 2 years, up to 25% of patients will have significant negative symptoms. Psychotic symptoms tend to diminish as the individuals age, but negative symptoms tend to persist. Prominent negative symptoms at disease onset, including alogia, are good predictors of worse outcomes. Negative symptoms can arise in the presence of other psychiatric symptoms. Positive symptoms are a common cause of apathy, social withdrawal, and alogia. Secondary causes of negative symptoms, such as depression and demoralization, often remit within a year, which helps distinguishing them from primary negative symptoms. Symptoms that don't diminish over a year with medications should be reconsidered as possible primary negative symptoms.

The initial reason for the formation of the choir was a wish, in the summer of 1845, to participate at the Nordic student meeting in Lund and Copenhagen. The students contacted Behrens a short time before their departure to Copenhagen. Behrens, at first, declined to assist in the formation of choir due to the limited amount of time they had left to rehearse. He was eventually persuaded and accepted on the condition that he had the final word on which songs were rehearsed well enough for performance. On July 10, 1845, the society's laws were signed. However, Behrens, wanting to focus on his studies, did not wish to continue as conductor; and passed on the job to Halfdan Kjerulf. =Chronology= 1845 \\"Studentertog\\" to Copenhagen results in formation of DnS.

Sometimes referred to as Arnulf of R≈ìulx, presumably after the village of R≈ìulx some 70km from his home village of Chocques, he was given the nickname Malecorne, meaning badly tonsured. Biography Arnulf was the illegitimate son of a Flemish priest, and studied under Lanfranc at Caen. In the 1070s he was a tutor to Cecilia, daughter of William I of England. He also taught Ralph of Caen, one of the later chroniclers of the First Crusade. He was also close to Odo of Bayeux, who he accompanied on the Crusade.Spear, David S. \\"The School of Caen Revisited\\" in The Haskins Society Journal: Studies in Medieval History Volume 4 ed. Robert B. Patterson Woodbridge, Suffolk:Boydell Press 1992 p. 57 He was the chaplain of the Norman crusader army led by Robert of Normandy, Cecilia's brother and William's son.Charles Homer Haskins, Norman Institutions, (New York, 1967), pp.74-5; The Gesta Tancredi of Ralph of Caen: A History of the Normans on the First Crusade, eds. Bernard S. Bachrach and David. S. Bachrach (Routledge, Oxford, 2016), p.1 He was most likely appointed a papal legate, under the authority of the overall legate Adhemar of Le Puy, and after Adhemar's death in 1098 he shared control of the clergy with fellow legate Peter of Narbonne. Some of the non-Norman knights in the other crusader armies believed he was corrupt, and they apparently sang vulgar songs about him, but most crusaders respected him as an eloquent preacher. He was one of the chief skeptics about Peter Bartholomew's claims to have discovered the Holy Lance in Antioch, and because of Arnulf's opposition Peter volunteered to undergo an ordeal by fire. Arnulf's opposition to Peter brought him into conflict with Raymond of St. Gilles, who believed Peter's story. To help ease the crisis among the crusaders over the issue, and also to lift spirits after Peter's death during the ordeal, Arnulf helped make a statue of Christ which was placed on one of the siege engines during the siege of Jerusalem. After the capture of Jerusalem he discovered the True Cross in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. This discovery was not as controversial as the discovery of the Lance, although it was just as suspicious. Arnulf may have been trying to make up for the problems he caused disproving the authenticity of the Lance, and the True Cross became the most sacred relic of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. After Raymond left Jerusalem on 1 August 1099, Arnulf was elected Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. He was supported by Godfrey of Bouillon, the first ruler of Jerusalem, and in turn he supported Godfrey's decision to make Jerusalem a secular kingdom rather than one ruled by the clergy. He accompanied Godfrey in the Battle of Ascalon, with a relic of the True Cross. Arnulf enforced the Latin rite among the crusaders, banning all others thus further alienating the disaffected Greeks. However, his election was soon subject to doubts concerning its canonicity, as he was not yet a deacon. Before he could be ordained, he was replaced in December by Dagobert of Pisa, whom Pope Paschal II had appointed legate. Arnulf was instead appointed archdeacon of Jerusalem. In 1112 he officially became Patriarch, though many of the other clerics distrusted him and found him unnecessarily harsh. He was especially unpopular with the Orthodox and Syriac Christians when he prohibited non-Latin masses at the Holy Sepulchre. He was accused of various crimes: sexual relations with a Muslim woman, simony, and most importantly condoning the bigamous marriage of King Baldwin I to Adelaide del Vasto while his first wife Arda of Armenia was still alive. He was briefly deposed by a papal legate in 1115, but appealed to Pope Paschal II and was reinstated in 1116, provided that he annul Baldwin and Adelaide's marriage. He remained Patriarch until his death in 1118. Arnulf married his niece Emma, also called Emelota, to Eustace Garnier, the Latin seigneur of Caesarea and Sidon. After his death, Emma married Hugh II of Le Puiset.

According to Norman DeWitt, the early Christians appropriated this practice from the Epicureans, a school whose founder Epicurus had instructed to keep summaries of the teachings for easy learning. The term catechumen refers to the designated recipient of the catechetical work or instruction. In the Catholic Church, catechumens are those who are preparing to receive the Sacrament of Baptism. Traditionally, they would be placed separately during Holy Mass from those who had been baptized, and would be dismissed from the liturgical assembly before the Profession of Faith (Creed) and General Intercessions (Prayers of the Faithful). Catechisms are characteristic of Western Christianity but are also present in Eastern Orthodox Christianity. In 1973, The Common Catechism, the first joint catechism of Catholics and Protestants, was published by theologians of the major Western Christian traditions, as a result of extensive ecumenical dialogue. Format Before the Protestant Reformation, Christian catechesis took the form of instruction in and memorization of the Apostles' Creed, Lord's Prayer, and basic knowledge of the sacraments. The word \\"catechism\\" for a manual for this instruction appeared in the Late Middle Ages. The use of a question and answer format was popularized by Martin Luther in his 1529 Small Catechism. He wanted the catechumen to understand what he was learning, so the Decalogue, Lord's Prayer, and Apostles' Creed were broken up into small sections, with the question \\"What does this mean\\" following each portion. The format calls upon two parties to participate, a master and a student (traditionally termed a \\"scholar\\"), or a parent and a child. The Westminster Shorter Catechism (1647) is an example: > Q. What is the chief end of man? > A. To glorify God and enjoy Him forever! > > Q. What rule hath God given to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy Him? > A. The word of God which is contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New > Testaments is the only rule to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy him. Protestant catechisms Jules-Alexis Meunier The catechism's question-and- answer format, with a view toward the instruction of children, was a form adopted by the various Protestant confessions almost from the beginning of the Reformation. Among the first projects of the Reformation was the production of catechisms self-consciously modelled after the older traditions of Cyril of Jerusalem and Augustine. These catechisms showed special admiration for Chrysostom's view of the family as a \\"little church\\", and placed strong responsibility on every father to teach his children, in order to prevent them from coming to baptism or the Lord's table ignorant of the doctrine under which they are expected to live as Christians. =Lutheran catechisms= Luther's Large Catechism (1529) typifies the emphasis which the churches of the Augsburg Confession placed on the importance of knowledge and understanding of the articles of the Christian faith. Primarily intended as instruction to teachers, especially to parents, the catechism consists of a series of exhortations on the importance of each topic of the catechism. It is meant for those who have the capacity to understand, and is meant to be memorized and then repeatedly reviewed so that the Small Catechism could be taught with understanding. For example, the author stipulates in the preface: Luther adds: Luther's Small Catechism, in contrast, is written to accommodate the understanding of a child or an uneducated person. It begins: =Reformed catechisms= The Catechism, painting by Edith Hartry Calvin's 1545 preface to the Genevan catechism begins with an acknowledgement that the several traditions and cultures which were joined in the Reformed movement would produce their own form of instruction in each place. While Calvin argues that no effort should be expended on preventing this, he adds: The scandal of diverse instruction is that it produces diverse baptisms and diverse communions, and diverse faith. However, forms may vary without introducing substantial differences, according to the Reformed view of doctrine. Genevan Catechism Title page of 1545 edition of the Genevan Catechism John Calvin produced a catechism while at Geneva (1541), which underwent two major revisions (1545 and 1560). Calvin's aim in writing the catechism of 1545 was to set a basic pattern of doctrine, meant to be imitated by other catechists, which would not affirm local distinctions or dwell on controversial issues, but would serve as a pattern for what was expected to be taught by Christian fathers and other teachers of children in the church. The catechism is organized on the topics of faith, law, prayer and sacraments. Heidelberg Catechism After Protestantism entered into the Palatinate, in 1546 the controversy between Lutherans and Calvinists broke out, and especially while the region was under the elector Otto Heinrich (1556‚Äì1559), this conflict in Saxony, particularly in Heidelberg, became increasingly bitter and turned violent. When Frederick III, Elector Palatine came into power in 1559 he put his authority behind the Calvinistic view on the Lord's Supper, which denied the local presence of the body of Jesus Christ in the elements of the sacrament. He turned Sapienz College into a school of divinity, and in 1562 he placed over it a pupil and friend of Luther's colleague, Philipp Melanchthon, named Zacharias Ursinus. In an attempt to resolve the religious disputes in his domain, Frederick called upon Ursinus and his colleague Caspar Olevianus (preacher to Frederick's court) to produce a catechism. The two collaborators referred to existing catechetical literature, and especially relied on the catechisms of Calvin and of John Lasco. To prepare the catechism, they adopted the method of sketching drafts independently, and then bringing together the work to combine their efforts. \\"The final preparation was the work of both theologians, with the constant co- operation of Frederick III. Ursinus has always been regarded as the principal author, as he was afterwards the chief defender and interpreter of the Catechism; still, it would appear that the nervous German style, the division into three parts (as distinguished from the five parts in the Catechism of Calvin and the previous draft of Ursinus), and the genial warmth and unction of the whole work, are chiefly due to Olevianus.\\" (Schaff, in. Am. Presb. Rev. July 1863, p. 379). The structure of the Heidelberg Catechism is spelled out in the second question; and the three-part structure seen there is based on the belief that the single work of salvation brings forward the three persons of the Trinity in turn, to make God fully and intimately known by his work of salvation, referring to the Apostles' Creed as an epitome of Christian faith. Assurance of salvation is the unifying theme throughout this catechism: assurance obtained by the work of Christ, applied through the sacraments, and resulting in grateful obedience to the commandments and persistence in prayer. The Heidelberg Catechism is the most widely used of the Catechisms of the Reformed churches. Westminster Catechisms Perth, 1785). Together with the Westminster Confession of Faith (1647), the Westminster Assembly also produced two catechisms, a Larger and a Shorter, which were intended for use in Christian families and in churches. These documents have served as the doctrinal standards, subordinate to the Bible, for Presbyterians and other Reformed churches around the world. The Shorter Catechism shows the Assembly's reliance upon the previous work of Calvin, Lasco, and the theologians of Heidelberg. It comprises two main sections summarizing what the Scriptures principally teach: the doctrine of God, and the duty required of men. Questions and answers cover the usual elements: faith, the Ten Commandments, the sacraments, and prayer. Other Reformed catechisms Oecolampadius composed the Basel Catechism in 1526, Leo Juda (1534) followed by Bullinger (1555) published catechisms in Zurich. The French Reformed used Calvin's Genevan catechism, as well as works published by Louis Cappel (1619), and Charles Drelincourt (1642). =Baptist catechisms= English Calvinistic Baptists typically adopted Reformed catechisms, modifying them to reflect their own convictions concerning the nature of the church and the sacrament of baptism. In 1680, the Baptist minister Hercules Collins published his own revision of the Heidelberg Catechism. Later, the General Assembly of 1677 adopted a catechism that was largely based on the Westminster Shorter Catechism. However, this catechism was not published until 1689, after the passing of the Act of Toleration 1689. =Pentecostal catechisms= While the Pentecostal movement has no one official catechism or confession, nevertheless Pentecostal authors have produced catechetical works. William Seymour, founder of the Azusa Street revival, included a catechism in the Doctrines and Disciplines of the Azusa Street Apostolic Faith Mission. Assemblies of God minister Warren D. Combs produced a catechism in the 1960s. In 2016 Henry Volk the host of the Theology in Perspective podcast authored a resource entitled, A Pentecostal Catechism. =Anglican catechism= The Anglican Book of Common Prayer includes a catechism. In older editions it is a brief manual for the instruction of those preparing to be brought before the bishop for confirmation: the baptised first professes his baptism, and then rehearses the principal elements of the faith into which he has been baptised: the Apostles' Creed, Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, and the sacraments. > Catechist: What is your Name? > Answer: N. or M. > Catechist: Who gave you this Name? > Answer: My Godfathers and Godmothers in my Baptism; wherein I was made a > member of Christ, the child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of > heaven. The \\"N. or M.\\" stands for the Latin, \\"nomen vel nomina\\", meaning \\"name or names\\". It is an accident of typography that \\"nomina\\" came to be represented by \\"m\\". The US-based Episcopal Church's 1979 prayer book has a considerably longer catechism intended as \\"an outline of instruction\\" and \\"a brief summary of the Church's teaching\\". =Methodist catechisms= The Catechism of the Methodist Episcopal Church is an official catechism for that denomination, now known as the United Methodist Church. A Catechism on the Christian Religion: The Doctrines of Christianity with Special Emphasis on Wesleyan Concepts by Mel-Thomas and Helen Rothwell is another popular catechism used to explicate Wesleyan-Arminian theology. More recent publications are A Catechism Prepared Especially for the Members of the Evangelical Wesleyan Church (printed in the United States), A Larger Catechism: For Members of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church (printed in the United States), and A Catechism for the Use of the People Called Methodists (printed in Great Britain). =Socinian and other sectarian catechisms= Besides the manuals of instruction that were published by the Protestants for use in their families and churches, there were other works produced by sectarian groups intended as a compact refutation of orthodoxy. For example, Socinians in Poland published the Racovian Catechism in 1605, using the question and answer format of a catechism for the orderly presentation of their arguments against the Trinity and the doctrine of Hell, as these were understood by the Reformed churches from which they were forced to separate. The Anabaptists have also produced catechisms of their own, to explain and defend their distinctives. Catholic catechisms A catechism lesson in a Madras Presidency village (India), 1939 The Catechism of the Catholic Church (see below) is the catechism that is in most widespread use among Catholics today. It is the official catechism of the Church. For Catholics, all the canonical books of the Bible (including the Deuterocanonical books), the tradition of the Church and the interpretation of these by the Magisterium (which may be outlined in a catechism, a compendium or a declaration) constitute the complete and best resource for fully attaining to God's revelation to mankind. Catholics believe that sacred scripture and sacred tradition preserved and interpreted by the Magisterium are both necessary for attaining to the fullest understanding of all of God's revelation. The term catechist is most frequently used in Catholicism, often to describe a lay catechist or layperson with catechetical training who engages in such teaching and evangelization. This can be in both parish church and mission contexts. =Roman Catechism= The Roman Catechism (also called, the Catechism of the Council of Trent or the Catechism of Pius V) was first published in 1566 under the authority of the Council of Trent. It was not intended for common use by the laity, but as a general use reference book for priests and bishops. (The online version is at http://www.cin.org/users/james/ebooks/master/trent/tindex.htm) =Catechism of Saint Pius X= The Catechism of Saint Pius X is a short catechism with questions and answers regarding the essentials of Catholic faith and doctrine. It was issued by Pope Pius X at the beginning of the 20th century in Italian, with the intention that all Catholics could easily understand their faith. (An online version is at http://www.cin.org/users/james/ebooks/master/pius/pindex.htm) =Baltimore Catechism= Various editions of the Baltimore Catechism were the de facto standard Catholic school text in America from 1885 to the late 1960s. It was often taught by rote. The most common edition has a series of questions with their answers, which are followed by explanations in more depth. These are often accompanied by biblical quotes. There is a test at the end of every chapter. (An online version is at http://www.cin.org/users/james/ebooks/master/baltimore/bindex.htm) =Catechism of Christian Doctrine (or \\"Penny Catechism\\")= A question and answer format catechism that was the standard catechetical text in Great Britain in the earlier part of the 20th century. Popularly called the Penny Catechism, as the original version only cost one penny. Various editions of the Penny Catechism were issued through the century and changes were made to the text. An online version is at http://www.proecclesia.com/penny%20catechism/index.htm. =Dutch Catechism (A New Catechism: Catholic Faith for Adults)= The hotly debated Dutch Catechism, De nieuwe katechismus (English translation: A New Catechism), of 1966 was the first comprehensive post-Vatican II Catholic catechism. It was commissioned and authorised by the Catholic hierarchy of the Netherlands, and in its foreword declares as its intention: \\"to make the message of Jesus Christ sound as new as it is.\\" The catechism, a bestseller, contained a number of problematic formulations. These were reviewed by a commission of cardinals, who detailed several significant shortcomings in the new catechism's presentation of Catholic doctrine. They were able, nonetheless, to \\"leave untouched by far the greatest part of the New Catechism,\\" while offering their support for \\"the laudable purpose of the authors of the Catechism, namely, to present the eternal good tidings of Christ in a way adapted to the understanding and the thinking of the present day man.\\" =Catechism of the Catholic Church= The current Catechism of the Catholic Church is the first complete systematic synthesis of faith issued since the Council of Trent in 1566. It contains articles on the classical topics of the official teaching of the Catholic Church on all matters of faith and morals. Since the official language of the Catholic Church is Latin, official teaching documents distributed in Latin are unlikely to change in perceived meaning over time. The Latin language version of the catechism, published 8 Sept 1997, is the editio typica‚Äîthe normative and definitive text. The principal source materials for this work are the Sacred Scriptures, the Church Fathers, the liturgy, and the Magisterium. This catechism is intended to serve \\"as a point of reference for the catechisms or compendia that are composed in the various countries.\\" ‚Äì Extraordinary Synod of Bishops 1985, Final Report II B a, 4. Fidei depositum is an Apostolic Constitution which states that the catechism of the Catholic Church is for the laity in its address to all the people of God. Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church It originated with a request of Pope John Paul II in February 2003 and was issued by his successor Pope Benedict XVI June 28, 2005. The English version was printed at Libreria Editrice Vaticana in 2006. Unlike the larger catechism, the Compendium is similar in format to the Baltimore Catechism with 598 questions and answers, providing an easier format with only the \\"essential\\" contents of the Catechism of the Catholic Church as the title suggests. =United States Catholic Catechism for Adults= The 1992 Vatican catechism had several aims, among them to be an \\"authentic reference text for teaching Catholic doctrine and particularly for preparing local catechisms\\". American bishops responded with the 2006 United States Catholic Catechism for Adults (USCCB, 2006) ‚Äì similar in format to a college textbook, targeting adults, contain seven elements that bring more depth to the material than the 'Compendium', providing more flexibility for diverse groups of people to study its contents. Each section or chapter contains the following: story or lesson of faith, foundation and application, sidebars, relationship to culture, discussion questions, doctrinal statements, and meditation and prayer. The lessons of faith stories are about individuals from the United States and allow the American reader to better relate to these individuals. This version of the catechism is available on audio CD-ROM as well. =Enchiridion symbolorum, definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum= The Enchiridion symbolorum, definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum also known as Enchiridion or Denzinger, is a compendium of all basic texts of Catholic dogma and morality since the apostles. Commissioned by Pope Pius IX, it has been in use since 1854, and has been updated periodically. It is a compendium of faith, like a catechism. By including all relevant teachings throughout history, it is at the same, more than a catechism. It is a search instrument for theologians, historians and anybody interested in Christian religion. The latest updates of the Enchiridion extend to the teachings of Pope John Paul II. The Archbishop of Baltimore Cardinal James Gibbons is quoted in earlier versions of the Enchiridion, that every theologian should have always two books at hand, the Holy Bible and this Enchiridion. =The Douay Catechism= The Rev Henry Tuberville, DD wrote this catechism in 1649 at the English College of Douay in Flanders. It is based on the Roman Catechism of the Council of Trent and was similarly written with the purpose of teaching Christian doctrine during the tumultuous English Reformation. It is a testament to Rev. Tuberville and his colleagues at Douay that it remains one of the clearest and most direct compendiums of Catholic teaching in the English language. = Catechism for Filipino Catholics = The Catechism for Filipino Catholics (CFC) is a contextualised and inculturated Roman Catholic catechism for Filipinos prepared by the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines and approved by the Holy See. The draft was produced by the Conference's \\"Episcopal Commission on Catechesis and Catholic Education,\\" and is an update of the late 16th century Doctrina Christiana en Lengua Espanola Y Tagala, which was a Hispano-Tagalog version of the earlier Hispano-Chinese Doctrina that was the first book printed in the Philippines using moveable type. The Doctrina Cristiana\\"Lessing J. Rosenwald Collection\\" Library of Congress. World Digital Library. Retrieved 10 November 2010. was written in Tagalog (both in a hispanised Latin script and the then-common indigenous Baybayin script), as well as Spanish. Amongst the contents of the Doctrina are the Spanish alphabet and phonics, archaic Tagalog translations of basic prayers shown in both languages and scripts, and a brief catechism in a question-and-answer format. = Christ ‚Äì Our Pascha (Eastern Catholic) = In 2012, this catechism was published by the Synod of the Ukrainian Greek- Catholic Church, one of the 23 Eastern Catholic churches. It is used by some of the other Eastern Catholic churches as well, as it provides a more Eastern perspective on the universal doctrines and practices of the Catholic Church, as well as delving into Eastern Christian practices and beliefs typically not emphasized in Western Catholicism. An English translation appeared in 2016. =A Catechism or Christian Doctrine= Laurence Vaux, B.D., a Catholic martyr, first published his catechism, also called The Catechism of Laurence Vaux or Vaux's Catechism, in Louvain in 1567. Six further editions in rapid succession, emanating from Antwerp and Li√®ge, testified to its widespread popularity and effectiveness. The 1583 Li√®ge issue was reprinted with biographical introduction for the Chetham Society by Thomas Graves Law in 1885. This edition contains also Vaux's paper \\"The Use and Meaning of Ceremonies,\\" and a few further pages of instruction added by the Li√®ge publisher. The catechism is practically formed on the same lines as its successor of today, explaining in sequence the Apostles' Creed, the Lord's Prayer and Hail Mary (excluding the second half beginning at \\"Holy Mary‚Ä¶\\"), the Ten Commandments (at considerable length), the Sacraments and the offices of Christian justice. The treatise on the ceremonies discusses the use of holy water, candles, incense, vestments and so forth. According to the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia, Laurence Vaux's Catechism was the first Reformation era Catholic Catechism in English when it was published in 1567. Reprints followed in 1574, 1583, 1599 and 1605. =The Catechetical Instructions of St. Thomas Aquinas= The catechetical instructions of Saint Thomas Aquinas were used generally throughout the 13th and 14th centuries as manuals and textbooks for priests and teachers of religion. \\"The Explanations of St. Thomas,\\" wrote Spirago, \\"are remarkable for their conciseness and their simplicity of language; they are especially noteworthy because the main parts of the catechetical course of instruction are brought into connection with one another so that they appear as one harmonious whole.\\" The influence of these works is especially prominent in the \\"Roman Catechism\\" which the Council of Trent ordered written for parish priests and for all teachers of religion. Many of the explanatory passages in both works are almost identical. =Ignorantia sacerdotum= Ignorantia Sacerdotum are the first words and the better-known title of De Informatione Simplicium, a catechetical manual drafted by Archbishop Pecham's provincial Council of Lambeth in 1281.Councils & Synods, with Other Documents Relating to the English Church, vol. 2: 1205-1313, ed. F. M. Powicke and C. R. Cheney (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1964), part 2, p. 900-905.Excerpts appear in William Lyndwood's Provinciale. It called for the memorisation of the Apostle's Creed, the Ten Commandments, and the two-fold injunction to \\"love the Lord thy God with all thy heart... and thy neighbour as thyself.\\". It also emphasised the Seven Virtues, the Seven Deadly Sins, the Seven Sacraments, and the Seven Works of Mercy. A 1357 translation into English is often called the Lay-Folk's Catechism.The Lay Folks‚Äô Catechism or the English and Latin Versions of Archbishop Thoresby‚Äôs Instructions for the People (London: Published for the Early English Text Society, by Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr√ºbner & Co., 1901). Non-Christian catechisms Catechisms represent an obvious, practical method of passing on instruction, and as such examples can be found in many traditions. For example, Asiatic schools of esoteric learning also used a catechetical style of instruction, as this Zodiac catechism shows: > Q. \\"Where is the animal, O Lanoo? and where the Man? > A. Fused into one, O Master of my Life. The two are one. But both have > disappeared and naught remains but the deep fire of my desire. In Zoroastrianism there is the \\"ƒåƒ™DAG ANDARZ ƒ™ P≈åRY≈åTKƒí≈†ƒÄN\\" also known as \\"Pand-nƒÅmag ƒ´ Zardu≈°t\\" (Book of the counsels of Zoroaster), which is a post- Sasanian compendium of apothegms intended to instruct every Zoroastrian male, upon his attaining the age of fifteen years, in fundamental religious and ethical principles, as well as in the daily duties incumbent upon him. In Robert Charles Zaehner's words, it \\"sums up succinctly the whole of Zoroastrian doctrine: it is what every boy and girl of fifteen must know before he or she is invested with the sacred girdle {kusti}.\\" Judaism does not have a formal catechism. While there have been several attempts to formulate Jewish principles of faith, and some of these have achieved wide acceptance, none can be described as being in the form of a catechism. The most widely recited formulation, Yigdal, is in the form of a hymn based on Maimonides' 13 Articles of Faith. Bhaktivinoda Thakur's book Jaiva Dharma is an example of Gaudiya Vaishnava catechism. It follows the usual question-answer format. In the Pali Canon of Theravada Buddhism a small bit of catechism appears as the fourth section of the Khuddakapatha, as well as the forty-third and forty- fourth suttas of the Majjhima Nikaya. Henry Steel Olcott introduced his own form of Buddhist catechism, appropriated from Christianity, to Ceylon when setting up his Buddhist education system during the late 19th century Buddhist revival on the island. Epicurean catechism may have originated from the practice of writing outlines of Epicurean doctrines for easy memorization. Epicurus' Letter to Herodotus is known as the \\"Little Epitome\\" which young students are instructed to memorize, and in antiquity they would move on to more advanced teachings with the \\"Large Epitome\\". The 40 Principal Doctrines also serve the role of a catechism. The philosopher Philodemus of Gadara instructed his students to keep an outline of the doctrines on wealth and economics, so that there are additional doctrines that advanced students may focus on. Islam teaches children and new Muslims the matters of faith, worship, and ethics in the form of a concise manual. They are popular in Turkish as Ilmihal (from the Arabic Ilm ul-Hal, Situation Science). It is also advised for every Muslim to have a basic knowledge of such matters of religion. The first chapter is the book of cleanliness and first to be taught are subjects such as: which are clean, what is clean and what is not clean, what people need to be cleansed from, how they should clean, and which water should they use to clean. Secular catechisms In the past, catechisms were written to rehearse the basic knowledge of a non-religious subject. Examples include numerous political catechisms published from the 18th to the 20th century in Europe as well as in North and South America.Jean-Charles Buttier, √âmilie Delivr√© (ed.),\\"Les cat√©chismes r√©publicains \\", La R√©volution fran√ßaise, Institut d'Histoire de la R√©volution Fran√ßaise, Paris, sept. 2009.

Friedrich Engels' 1847 work Principles of Communism was written as a catechism: Engels subsequently decided that the format was not suited to the addition of historical material which he felt was necessary, and he and Karl Marx restructured the material and used it as the nucleus of The Communist Manifesto. Some literary works have also taken the form of a catechism. The 17th episode of James Joyce's novel Ulysses, known as \\"Ithaca\\", is written in the form of a catechism, as is Ted Hughes' poem Examination at the Womb Door, from the collection Crow. In Henry IV, Part 1: Act V, Scene I, Line 141 Falstaff refers to his monologue as a catechism, explaining his view of the virtue of honor.

She mostly wrote essays, but also published novels; she published her first major work, the essay \\"Notes on 'Camp'\\", in 1964. Her best-known works include the critical works Against Interpretation (1966), Styles of Radical Will (1968), On Photography (1977), and Illness as Metaphor (1978), as well as the fictional works The Way We Live Now (1986), The Volcano Lover (1992), and In America (1999). Sontag was active in writing and speaking about, or travelling to, areas of conflict, including during the Vietnam War and the Siege of Sarajevo. She wrote extensively about photography, culture and media, AIDS and illness, human rights, and communism and leftist ideology. Although her essays and speeches sometimes drew controversy, she has been described as \\"one of the most influential critics of her generation.\\"\\"Susan Sontag\\", The New York Review of Books, accessed December 19, 2012 Early life and education Sontag was born Susan Rosenblatt in New York City, the daughter of Mildred (n√©e Jacobson) and Jack Rosenblatt, both Jews of Lithuanian and Polish descent. Her father managed a fur trading business in China, where he died of tuberculosis in 1939, when Susan was five years old. Seven years later, Sontag's mother married U.S. Army captain Nathan Sontag. Susan and her sister, Judith, took their stepfather's surname, although he did not adopt them formally. Sontag did not have a religious upbringing and said she had not entered a synagogue until her mid-20s. Remembering an unhappy childhood, with a cold, distant mother who was \\"always away\\", Sontag lived on Long Island, New York, then in Tucson, Arizona, and later in the San Fernando Valley in southern California, where she took refuge in books and graduated from North Hollywood High School at the age of 15. She began her undergraduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley but transferred to the University of Chicago in admiration of its famed core curriculum. At Chicago, she undertook studies in philosophy, ancient history and literature alongside her other requirements. Leo Strauss, Joseph Schwab, Christian Mackauer, Richard McKeon, Peter von Blanckenhagen and Kenneth Burke were among her lecturers. She graduated at the age of 18 with an A.B. and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.\\"A Gluttonous Reader\\", Interview with M. McQuade in Poague, pp. 271‚Äì278. While at Chicago, she became best friends with fellow student Mike Nichols. In 1951, her work appeared in print for the first time in the winter issue of the Chicago Review. At 17, Sontag married writer Philip Rieff, who was a sociology instructor at the University of Chicago, after a 10-day courtship; their marriage lasted eight years.Sontag, Susan. Reborn: Journals and Notebooks 1947‚Äì1963, ed. D. Rieff, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2008, p. 144. While studying at Chicago, Sontag attended a summer school taught by the sociologist who became a friend and subsequently influenced her study of German thinkers. Upon completing her Chicago degree, Sontag taught freshman English at the University of Connecticut for the 1952‚Äì53 academic year. She attended Harvard University for graduate school, initially studying literature with Perry Miller and Harry Levin before moving into philosophy and theology under Paul Tillich, Jacob Taubes, Raphael Demos and Morton White.See Susan Sontag, 'Literature is Freedom' in At the Same Time, ed.

After completing her Master of Arts in philosophy, she began doctoral research into metaphysics, ethics, Greek philosophy and Continental philosophy and theology at Harvard. The philosopher Herbert Marcuse lived with Sontag and Rieff for a year while working on his 1955 book Eros and Civilization.Rollyson and Paddock. Sontag researched for Rieff's 1959 study Freud: The Mind of the Moralist before their divorce in 1958, and contributed to the book to such an extent that she has been considered an unofficial co-author. The couple had a son, David Rieff, who went on to be his mother's editor at Farrar, Straus and Giroux, as well as a writer in his own right. Sontag was awarded an American Association of University Women's fellowship for the 1957‚Äì1958 academic year to St Anne's College, Oxford, where she traveled without her husband and son.Sante, Luc. \\"Sontag: The Precocious Years\\", Sunday Book Review, The New York Times, January 29, 2009, accessed December 19, 2012 There, she had classes with Iris Murdoch, Stuart Hampshire, A. J. Ayer and H. L. A. Hart while also attending the B. Phil seminars of J. L. Austin and the lectures of Isaiah Berlin. Oxford did not appeal to her, however, and she transferred after Michaelmas term of 1957 to the University of Paris (the Sorbonne).See Morton White, A Philosopher's Story, Pennsylvania University Press, 1999, p.148; and Rollyson and Paddock, pp. 43‚Äì45 In Paris, Sontag socialized with expatriate artists and academics including Allan Bloom, Jean Wahl, Alfred Chester, Harriet Sohmers and Mar√≠a Irene Forn√©s.Field, Edward.

It certainly provided the basis of her long intellectual and artistic association with the culture of France.\\"An Emigrant of Thought\\", interview with Jean-Louis Servan-Schreiber, in Poague, pp. 143‚Äì164 She moved to New York in 1959 to live with Forn√©s for the next seven years,Moore, Patrick. \\"Susan Sontag and a Case of Curious Silence\\", Los Angeles Times, January 4, 2005, accessed December 18, 2012 regaining custody of her son and teaching at universities while her literary reputation grew. =Fiction= Photo portrait of Sontag, 1966 While working on her stories, Sontag taught philosophy at Sarah Lawrence College and City University of New York and the Philosophy of Religion with Jacob Taubes, Susan Taubes, Theodor Gaster, and Hans Jonas, in the Religion Department at Columbia University from 1960 to 1964. She held a writing fellowship at Rutgers University for 1964 to 1965 before ending her relationship with academia in favor of full-time freelance writing. At age 30, she published an experimental novel called The Benefactor (1963), following it four years later with Death Kit (1967). Despite a relatively small output, Sontag thought of herself principally as a novelist and writer of fiction. Her short story \\"The Way We Live Now\\" was published to great acclaim on November 24, 1986 in The New Yorker. Written in an experimental narrative style, it remains a significant text on the AIDS epidemic. She achieved late popular success as a best-selling novelist with The Volcano Lover (1992). At age 67, Sontag published her final novel In America (2000). The last two novels were set in the past, which Sontag said gave her greater freedom to write in the polyphonic voice: She wrote and directed four films and also wrote several plays, the most successful of which were Alice in Bed and Lady from the Sea. The cover of Against Interpretation (1966), which contains some of Sontag's best-known essays =Nonfiction= It was through her essays that Sontag gained early fame and notoriety. Sontag wrote frequently about the intersection of high and low art and expanded the dichotomy concept of form and art in every medium. She elevated camp to the status of recognition with her widely read 1964 essay \\"Notes on 'Camp,'\\" which accepted art as including common, absurd and burlesque themes. In 1977, Sontag published the series of essays On Photography. These essays are an exploration of photographs as a collection of the world, mainly by travelers or tourists, and the way we experience it. In the essays, she outlined her theory of taking pictures as you travel: > The method especially appeals to people handicapped by a ruthless work > ethic‚ÄîGermans, Japanese and Americans. Using a camera appeases the anxiety > which the work driven feel about not working when they are on vacation and > supposed to be having fun. They have something to do that is like a friendly > imitation of work: they can take pictures. (p. 10) Sontag writes that the convenience of modern photography has created an overabundance of visual material, and \\"just about everything has been photographed.\\"Sontag, Susan, \\"On Photography\\", 1977 This has altered our expectations of what we have the right to view, want to view or should view. \\"In teaching us a new visual code, photographs alter and enlarge our notion of what is worth looking at and what we have the right to observe\\" and has changed our \\"viewing ethics.\\" Photographs have increased our access to knowledge and experiences of history and faraway places, but the images may replace direct experience and limit reality. She also states that photography desensitizes its audience to horrific human experiences, and children are exposed to experiences before they are ready for them. Sontag continued to theorize about the role of photography in real life in her essay \\"Looking at War: Photography's View of Devastation and Death,\\" which appeared in the December 9, 2002 issue of The New Yorker. There she concludes that the problem of our reliance on images and especially photographic images is not that \\"people remember through photographs but that they remember only the photographs ... that the photographic image eclipses other forms of understanding‚Äîand remembering. ... To remember is, more and more, not to recall a story but to be able to call up a picture\\" (p. 94). She became a role-model for many feminists and aspiring female writers during the 1960s and 1970s. Activism Sontag became politically active in the 1960s, opposing the Vietnam War.Rollyson and Paddock. In January 1968, she signed the \\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the war.\\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" January 30, 1968 New York Post. In May 1968, she visited Hanoi; afterwards, she wrote positively about North Vietnamese society in her essay Trip to Hanoi.Rollyson and Paddock. The former Sarajevo newspaper building during the Siege of Sarajevo, when Sontag lived in the city During 1989 Sontag was the President of PEN American Center, the main U.S. branch of the International PEN writers' organization. After Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa death sentence against writer Salman Rushdie for blasphemy after the publication of his novel The Satanic Verses that year, Sontag's uncompromising support of Rushdie was crucial in rallying American writers to his cause.Hitchens, Christopher. \\"Assassins of the Mind\\", Vanity Fair, February 2009, accessed December 18, 2012 A few years later, during the Siege of Sarajevo, Sontag gained attention for directing a production of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot in a candlelit theater in the Bosnian capital, cut off from its electricity supply for three and a half years. Sarajevo's besieged residents reaction was noted as: > To the people of Sarajevo, Ms. Sontag has become a symbol, interviewed > frequently by the local newspapers and television, invited to speak at > gatherings everywhere, asked for autographs on the street.

Gen. Phillippe > Morillon, to be so named. \\"It is for your bravery, in coming here, living > here, and working with us,\\" he said. Personal life Sontag's mother died of lung cancer in Hawaii in 1986. Sontag had a close romantic relationship with photographer Annie Leibovitz. They met in 1989, when both had already established notability in their careers. Leibovitz has suggested that Sontag mentored her and constructively criticized her work. During Sontag's lifetime, neither woman publicly disclosed whether the relationship was a friendship or romantic in nature. Newsweek in 2006 made reference to Leibovitz's decade-plus relationship with Sontag, stating, \\"The two first met in the late '80s, when Leibovitz photographed her for a book jacket. They never lived together, though they each had an apartment within view of the other's.\\" Leibovitz, when interviewed for her 2006 book A Photographer's Life: 1990-2005, said the book told a number of stories, and that \\"with Susan, it was a love story.\\" While The New York Times in 2009 referred to Sontag as Leibovitz's \\"companion,\\" Leibovitz wrote in A Photographer's Life that, \\"Words like 'companion' and 'partner' were not in our vocabulary. We were two people who helped each other through our lives. The closest word is still 'friend.'\\" That same year, Leibovitz said the descriptor \\"lover\\" was accurate. She later reiterated, \\"Call us 'lovers.' I like 'lovers.' You know, 'lovers' sounds romantic. I mean, I want to be perfectly clear. I love Susan.\\" Sontag died in New York City on 28 December 2004, aged 71, from complications of myelodysplastic syndrome which had evolved into acute myelogenous leukemia. She is buried in Paris at Cimeti√®re du Montparnasse.Wilson, Scott. Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons, 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Location 44249). McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition. Her final illness has been chronicled by her son, David Rieff. =Sexuality and relationships= Susan Sontag in 1994, painted by Bolivian artist Juan Fernando Bastos Sontag became aware of her bisexuality during her early teens and at 15 wrote in her diary, \\"I feel I have lesbian tendencies (how reluctantly I write this).\\" At 16, she had a sexual encounter with a woman: \\"Perhaps I was drunk, after all, because it was so beautiful when H began making love to me...It had been 4:00 before we had gotten to bed...I became fully conscious that I desired her, she knew it, too.\\"Susan Sontag: 'It was so beautiful when H began making love to me', Paul Bignell, The Independent on Sunday, 16 November 2008Reborn: Early Diaries, 1947‚Äì1964, Penguin, January 2009 Sontag lived with 'H,' the writer and model Harriet Sohmers Zwerling whom she first met at U. C. Berkeley from 1958 to 1959. Afterwards, Sontag was the partner of Mar√≠a Irene Forn√©s, a Cuban- American avant garde playwright and director. Upon splitting with Forn√©s, she was involved with an Italian aristocrat, Carlotta Del Pezzo, and the German academic Eva Kollisch.See Susan Sontag, As Consciousness is Harnessed to Flesh, p.262, 269. Sontag was romantically involved with the American artists Jasper Johns and Paul Thek.Paul Thek Artist's Artist ed. H. Falckenberg. During the early 1970s, Sontag lived with Nicole St√©phane, a Rothschild banking heiress turned movie actress,Leo Lerman, \\"The Grand Surprise: The Journals of Leo Lerman\\", NY: Knopf, 2007, page 413 and, later, the choreographer Lucinda Childs. She also had a relationship with the writer Joseph Brodsky.See Sigrid Nunez, Sempre Susan: A Memoir of Susan Sontag, p.31. With Annie Leibovitz, Sontag maintained a relationship stretching from the later 1980s until her final years.McGuigan, Cathleen. \\"Through Her Lens\\", Newsweek, 2 October 2006 In an interview in The Guardian in 2000, Sontag was quite open about bisexuality: Many of Sontag's obituaries failed to mention her significant same-sex relationships, most notably that with Annie Leibovitz. In response to this criticism, New York Times Public Editor, Daniel Okrent, defended the newspaper's obituary, stating that at the time of Sontag's death, a reporter could make no independent verification of her romantic relationship with Leibovitz (despite attempts to do so). After Sontag's death, Newsweek published an article about Annie Leibovitz that made clear references to her decade-plus relationship with Sontag. Sontag was quoted by Editor-in-Chief Brendan Lemon of Out magazine as saying \\"I grew up in a time when the modus operandi was the 'open secret.' I'm used to that, and quite OK with it. Intellectually, I know why I haven't spoken more about my sexuality, but I do wonder if I haven't repressed something there to my detriment. Maybe I could have given comfort to some people if I had dealt with the subject of my private sexuality more, but it's never been my prime mission to give comfort, unless somebody's in drastic need. I'd rather give pleasure, or shake things up.\\" Legacy Following Sontag's death, Steve Wasserman of The LA Times called her \\"one of America‚Äôs most influential intellectuals, internationally renowned for the passionate engagement and breadth of her critical intelligence and her ardent activism in the cause of human rights.\\" Eric Homberger of The Guardian called Sontag \\"the 'Dark Lady' of American cultural life for over four decades.\\" He observed that \\"despite a brimming and tartly phrased political sensibility, she was fundamentally an aesthete [who] offered a reorientation of American cultural horizons.\\" Writing about Against Interpretation (1966), Brandon Robshaw of The Independent later observed that \\"Sontag was remarkably prescient; her project of analysing popular culture as well as high culture, the Doors as well as Dostoevsky, is now common practice throughout the educated world.\\" In Critique and Postcritique (2017), Rita Felski and Elizabeth S. Anker argue that the title essay from the aforementioned collection played an important role in the field of postcritique, a movement within literary criticism and cultural studies that attempts to find new forms of reading and interpretation that go beyond the methods of critique, critical theory, and ideological criticism. Reviewing Sontag's On Photography (1977) in 1998, Michael Starenko wrote that the work \\"has become so deeply absorbed into this discourse that Sontag's claims about photography, as well as her mode of argument, have become part of the rhetorical 'tool kit' that photography theorists and critics carry around in their heads.\\" Criticism =White civilization as a cancer= Sontag drew criticism for writing in 1967 in Partisan Review: According to journalist Mark M. Goldblatt, Sontag later \\"recanted\\" the statement, saying that \\"it slandered cancer patients\\", but according to Eliot Weinberger, \\"She came to regret that last phrase, and wrote a whole book against the use of illness as metaphor.\\" =Allegations of plagiarism= Ellen Lee accused Sontag of plagiarism when Lee discovered at least twelve passages in In America (1999) that were similar to, or copied from, passages in four other books about Helena Modjeska without attribution.Marsh B. (2007) Plagiarism: Alchemy and Remedy in Higher Education, SUNY Press. Sontag said about using the passages, \\"All of us who deal with real characters in history transcribe and adopt original sources in the original domain. I've used these sources and I've completely transformed them. There's a larger argument to be made that all of literature is a series of references and allusions.\\"Carvajal, Doreen. (May 27, 2002) \\"So Whose Words Are They? Susan Sontag Creates a Stir.\\" New York Times Book Review. =On anti-Communism= At a New York pro-Solidarity rally in 1982, Sontag stated that \\"people on the left,\\" like herself, \\"have willingly or unwillingly told a lot of lies.\\" She added that they: Sontag's speech reportedly \\"drew boos and shouts from the audience.\\" The Nation published her speech, excluding the passage contrasting the magazine with Reader's Digest. Responses to her statement were varied. Some said that Sontag's current sentiments had been, in fact, held by many on the left for years, while others accused her of betraying \\"radical ideas.\\" =On the September 11 attacks= Sontag received angry criticism for her remarks in The New Yorker (September 24, 2001) about the immediate aftermath of 9/11.\\"Novelist, Radical Susan Sontag, 71, Dies in New York\\", The Washington Times, December 29, 2004, accessed December 19, 2012 In her commentary, she referred to the attacks as a \\"monstrous dose of reality\\" and criticized U.S. public officials and media commentators for trying to convince the American public that \\"everything is O.K.\\" Specifically, she opposed the idea that the perpetrators were \\"cowards,\\" a comment George W. Bush made among other remarks on September 11. Rather, she argued the country should see the terrorists' actions not as \\"a 'cowardly' attack on 'civilization' or 'liberty' or 'humanity' or 'the free world' but an attack on the world's self-proclaimed superpower, undertaken as a consequence of specific American alliances and actions.\\" =Criticisms from other writers= Tom Wolfe dismissed Sontag as \\"just another scribbler who spent her life signing up for protest meetings and lumbering to the podium encumbered by her prose style, which had a handicapped parking sticker valid at Partisan Review.\\" In \\"Sontag, Bloody Sontag\\", an essay in her 1994 book Vamps & Tramps, critic Camille Paglia describes her initial admiration and subsequent disillusionment. She mentions several criticisms of Sontag, including Harold Bloom's comment of \\"Mere Sontagisme!\\" on Paglia's doctoral dissertation, and states that Sontag \\"had become synonymous with a shallow kind of hip posturing.\\" Paglia also tells of a visit by Sontag to Bennington College, in which she arrived hours late and ignored the agreed-upon topic of the event. Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book Skin in the Game criticizes Sontag and other people with extravagant lifestyles who nevertheless declare themselves \\"against the market system\\". Taleb assesses Sontag's shared New York mansion at $28 million, and states that \\"it is immoral to be in opposition to the market system and not live (somewhere in Vermont or Northwestern Afghanistan) in a hut or cave isolated from it.\\" Taleb also argues that it is even more immoral to \\"claim virtue without fully living with its direct consequences.\\"New York: Random House. 2018. ., pages 183-4 Works =Fiction= * (1963) The Benefactor * (1967) Death Kit * (1977) I, etcetera (Collection of short stories) * (1991) \\"The Way We Live Now\\" (short story) * (1992) The Volcano Lover * (1999) In America ‚Äì winner of the 2000 U.S. National Book Award for Fiction\\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 2000\\", National Book Foundation, with essays by Jessica Hicks and Elizabeth Yale from the Awards' 60-year anniversary blog, accessed March 3, 2012 =Plays= * The Way We Live Now (1990) about the AIDS epidemic * A Parsifal (1991), a deconstruction inspired by Robert Wilson's 1991 staging of the Wagner opera * Alice in Bed (1993), about 19th century intellectual Alice James, who was confined to bed by illness *Lady from the Sea, an adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's 1888 play of the same name, premiered in 1998 in Italy.Curty, Stefano. \\"Sontag and Wilson's Lady from the Sea World Premieres in Italy, May 5 , Playbill, May 5, 1998, accessed December 26, 2012 Sontag wrote an essay about it in 1999 in Theatre called \\"Rewriting Lady from the Sea.\\" =Nonfiction= Collections of essays * (1966) Against Interpretation (includes Notes on \\"Camp\\") * (1969) Styles of Radical Will * (1980) Under the Sign of Saturn * (2001) Where the Stress Falls * (2003) Regarding the Pain of Others * (2007) At the Same Time: Essays & Speeches (edited by Paolo Dilonardo and Anne Jump, with a foreword by David Rieff) Sontag also published nonfiction essays in The New Yorker, The New York Review of Books, Times Literary Supplement, The Nation, Granta, Partisan Review and the London Review of Books.

Biography Fatema Mernissi was born on 27 September 1940 in Fez, Morocco. She grew up in the harem of her affluent paternal grandmother along with various female kin and servants.Fatima Mernissi obituary, The Guardian She received her primary education in a school established by the nationalist movement, and secondary level education in an all-girls school funded by the French protectorate. In 1957, she studied political science at the Sorbonne and at Brandeis University, gaining her doctorate there. She returned to work at the Mohammed V University and taught at the Facult√© des Lettres between 1974 and 1981 on subjects such as methodology, family sociology and psychosociology. Mernissi is known for her sociopolitical approaches towards discussing gender and sexual identities, specifically those of which are focused within Morocco. She became known internationally mainly as an Islamic feminist. Mernissi was a lecturer at the Mohammed V University of Rabat and a research scholar at the University Institute for Scientific Research, in the same city. Beyond the Veil: Male- Female Dynamics in Muslim Society was written for her PhD thesis and later published into a book which recognizes the power of Muslim women in relation to the Islam faith. She is seen as one of Morocco's influential feminist figures for she is a successful scholar, teacher, writer, and sociologist. She died in Rabat on 30 November 2015.  Career  Mernissi's first monograph, Beyond the Veil, was published in 1975. A revised edition was published in Britain in 1985 and in the US in 1987. Beyond the Veil has become a classic, especially in the fields of anthropology and sociology on women in the Arab World, the Mediterranean area or Muslim societies in general. As an Islamic feminist, Mernissi was largely concerned with Islam and women's roles in it, analyzing the historical development of Islamic thought and its modern manifestation. Through a detailed investigation of the nature of the succession to Muhammad, she cast doubt on the validity of some of the hadith (sayings and traditions attributed to him), and therefore the subordination of women that she sees in Islam, but not necessarily in the Qur'an. She contributed the piece \\"The merchant's daughter and the son of the sultan\\" to the anthology Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology (1984), edited by Robin Morgan. Her most famous book, as an Islamic feminist, The Veil and the Male Elite: A Feminist Interpretation of Islam, is a quasi-historical study of role of the wives of Muhammad. It was first published in French in 1987, and translated into English in 1991. The book was banned in Morocco, Iran, and Arab states of the Persian Gulf. As a sociologist, Mernissi mainly did field work in Morocco. On several occasions in the late 1970s and early 1980s, she conducted interviews in order to map prevailing attitudes to women and work. She did sociological research for UNESCO and ILO as well as for the Moroccan authorities. In the same period, Mernissi contributed articles to periodicals and other publications on women in Morocco and women and Islam from a contemporary as well as from a historical perspective. Her work has been cited as an inspiration by other Muslim feminists, such as those who founded Musawah. For Doing Daily Battle: Interviews with Moroccan Women (1991), she interviewed peasant women, women labourers, clairvoyants and maidservants. In 1994, Mernissi published a memoir, Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood (in the US, the book was originally titled The Harem Within: Tales of a Moroccan Girlhood, and is still known by that title in the UK). A recurring topic for multiple of her writings is Scheherazde and the digital sphere. Her article, The Satellite, the Prince, and Scheherazde: The Rise of Women as Communicators in Digital Islam explore cases in which women take part in online media outlets, while Digital Scheherazades in the Arab World covers the topics of online activities shifting cultural ways. In her essay, she mentions how technology is quickly spreading ‚Äì one of the main sources being the World Wide Web ‚Äì and analyses the roles and contributions of women in this movement. She wrote extensively about life within harems, gender, and public and private spheres. Size 6: The Western Women‚Äôs Harem, is an essay from her book, Scheherazade Goes West: Different Cultures, Different Harems and it discusses the repression and pressures women face merely based on their physical appearance. Whether it is women being analyzed in Moroccan society or in the West, it seems that they must live up to stereotypical standards such as dress sizes. Mernissi compares the clothing size 6 to harems and states that these practices isolate and mistreat women.  Awards and Legacy  Mernissi's works focus on providing a voice for the oppressed and marginalized women. She brings to light the contributions of women to the economy and acknowledges the roles that affect how females are viewed within Islamic cultures. Throughout her career Mernissi was an avid spokesperson regarding women's rights and equality while also embracing the Islamic faith. She uses historical religious research to make claims for her modern feminist stances. In 2003, Mernissi was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award along with Susan Sontag. Mernissi presented her speech, The Cowboy or Sinbad? covering the topic of globalization and was recognized for her pensive take considering both the issue and effects of the culture. In 2004, she was awarded the Erasmus Prize, alongside Sadik Al-Asm and Abdolkarim Soroush. She was recognized for her sociocultural impact since the award was dedicated to \\"Religion and Modernity\\". In 2017, The Middle East Studies Association created the Fatima Mernissi Book Award in her honour to recognize women and gender studies. Islamic Contributions to the Feminist Global Movement Fatima Mernissi‚Äôs legacy can be greatly attributed to her scholarly and literary contributions to the early feminist movement. Mernissi tackles issues such as Eurocentrism, intersectionality, transnationalism and global Feminism within her renowned publications, including: Beyond the Veil, The Forgotten Queens of Islam, Women‚Äôs Rebellion & Islamic Memory, and Islam and Democracy: Fear of the Modern World. = Beyond the Veil and Ethnocentrism = In 1975, Fatima Mernissi‚Äôs first book, Beyond the Veil, was published, and it was revolutionary.Khaleeli, H. (2011). Top 100 women: activists campaigners, Fatima Mernissi broke down the ethnocentric stereotypes Western society had developed towards Islam, especially Islamic women. She distinguished Islamic women from the homogenized group of ‚Äòthird- world women‚Äô that Western feminism had created. Mernissi also fought to overcome Western assumptions that Muslim women were helpless victims of both their religion and the men of their religion. Western stereotypes ostracized Muslim men who did not fit the white, masculine, hegemonic mold dominating the first world society, developing racist ideas towards a religion that was believed to oppress women. However, Mernissi pointed out that Muslim women were not victims of their religious practices any more than Western women were victims of the patriarchy; both groups of women were oppressed by specific social institutions within a religion or society created to profit off of the marginalization of others. Furthermore, Mernissi explained that Western women were veiled, just as Muslim women were, yet Western veils were much more discreet.Mernissi, F. (1975). Beyond the Veil: Male -Female Dynamics in a. Modern Muslim Society. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Schenkman Publishing Company. She argued that youth and beauty veiled Western women, and once a woman no longer had these, she was hardly recognized by society. Mernissi broke down the ethnocentric approach Western Feminism had been utilizing and wrote to bring more clarity to the diversity necessary within the global Feminine movement. Mernissi‚Äôs legacy is revolutionary because she created a space within an initially predominantly Western movement that allowed Muslim women to participate without compromising their religious practices. Mernissi‚Äôs work highlighted how Western feminism could be detrimental to the empowerment of women around the globe if it lacked an intersectional approach to women‚Äôs issues. = The Forgotten Queens of Islam and Intersectionality = In the book The Forgotten Queens of Islam, Fatima Mernissi uses an intersectional approach to understand the positions of women throughout early Islamic history through social and political identities that created modes of discrimination. Her aim was to bring to light the significant contributions that women had throughout early Islamic history and debunk the misconceptions about the absence of women as political and authoritative figures. She does this by exploring the leadership roles that women were involved in throughout Islamic history and alters the way women are portrayed in historiographies. She claims that women held powerful political positions despite religious titles that were given to men.Mernissi, F. (1994). Hidden from history: the forgotten queens of Islam. Lahore, Pakistan: ASR Publications. This is exemplified through the many historical accounts that she provides about fifteen women and the active roles that they played in pre-modern Islam politics. For instance, the role that female slaves played in leading slave revolts against religious rulers without the use of violence (Mernissi, 1994). Moreover, Mernissi distinguishes between ‚ÄúPolitical Islam,‚Äù the period where radical change occurred and women‚Äôs roles were disregarded or forgotten, and ‚ÄúRislala Islam,‚Äù where women‚Äôs lives were transformed (Mernissi, 1994). She was fundamental in contributing to the overall academic literature on women‚Äôs visibility in Islamic history outside of their traditional roles by highlighting their involvement in politics, religion, and cultural change. = Women‚Äôs Rebellion & Islamic Memory and Gender Roles = In the book Women‚Äôs Rebellion & Islamic Memory, Fatima Mernissi analyzes the role of women in relation to the world of contemporary Islam. In her work, she explores the idea of sexual identity and gender roles in the Islamic world and helps to redefine the narrative surrounding it. Mernissi discusses some of the most prominent issues to do with the status of Muslim women, such as the masking of women‚Äôs contribution to the economies of Arab states (Mernissi, 1996). Furthermore, Mernissi delves into different demographic, including education and literacy. She uses this to help explain the importance of these factors not only for the empowerment of women in Islam, but also for their health (Mernissi, 1996). Furthermore, Mernissi analyzes the role of the state in gender roles as well as the outcome of a state that ultimately supports inequality (Mernissi, 1996). Mernissi ultimately argues that the freedom from these controlling traditions and expectations of women is the only way for the Arab world to develop. Mernissi‚Äôs work is extremely influential in Islamic feminism, intersectionality, and global feminism, by focusing on issues surrounding Muslim women in the Arab world. This book, in specific, was able to bring light to specific issues that women deal with in the Islamic world, such as issues of sexual identity and gender roles, and the effects this can take on women‚Äôs empowerment and health. = Islam and Democracy: Fear of the Modern World = In her book, Islam and Democracy: Fear of the Modern World, Fatima Mernissi employs a transnational approach to analyse the socio-political context of the Arab- Islamic world shortly after the Gulf war. She debates whether the established fundamentalism dominating the Middle East could ever be compatible with the democratic processes used in Western societies. Mernissi raises questions around the uncertainty Muslims feel towards a form of government that is ‚Äúunislamic‚Äù and may compromise their Islamic way of life, including morals and values, such as modesty.Mernissi, F. (2002). Islam and democracy: fear of the modern world. Cambridge, MA: Perseus Pub. Moreover, she explores issues such as the fear of the Islamic religion, democracy, the United Nations Charter, freedom of thought and individualism (Mernissi, 2002). For instance, she looked at how fundamentalism controlled what a woman would be able to wear, so a democratic society that freed women to dress as they pleased could appear threatening to a hyper-masculine culture. She contests that a living democracy should allow for the legal and constitutional ability to disagree with the state. Mernissi then suggests ways in which progressive Muslims, including feminists, who choose to advocate for democracy and resist fundamentalism should draw from the same sacred texts as those who seek to oppress them, in order to prove that Islam is not fundamentally against women.

The latter term \\"vari-speed\\" is more commonly used for tape decks, particularly in the UK. Analog pitch controls vary the voltage being used by the playback device; digital controls use digital signal processing to change the playback speed or pitch. A typical DJ deck allows the pitch to be increased or reduced by up to 8%, which is achieved by increasing or reducing the speed at which the platter rotates. Turntable or CD playing speed may be changed for beatmatching and other DJ techniques, while pitch shift using a pitch control has myriad uses in sound recording.

With the possibility to change it to +/- 16% and some other values. By changing the pitch the DJ can alter the BPM of a record within a certain range. This is a key component for beatmatching, because the DJ is trying to get both of their records playing at the same BPM which will make it possible to keep them in sync once the beats are matched.

Archeologists have reconstructed methods of timekeeping that go back to prehistoric times at least as old as the Neolithic. The natural units for timekeeping used by most historical societies are the day, the solar year and the lunation. Calendars are explicit schemes used for timekeeping. The first historically attested and formulized calendars date to the Bronze Age, dependent on the development of writing in the ancient Near East. The Sumerian calendar was the earliest, followed by the Egyptian, Assyrian and Elamite calendars. A larger number of calendar systems of the ancient Near East appear in the Iron Age archaeological record, based on the Assyrian and Babylonian calendars. This includes the calendar of the Persian Empire, which in turn gave rise to the Zoroastrian calendar as well as the Hebrew calendar. Calendars in antiquity were usually lunisolar, depending on the introduction of intercalary months to align the solar and the lunar years. This was mostly based on observation, but there may have been early attempts to model the pattern of intercalation algorithmically, as evidenced in the fragmentary 2nd- century Coligny calendar. Nevertheless, the Roman calendar contained very ancient remnants of a pre-Etruscan 10-month solar year.\\"Religion in the Etruscan period\\" in Roman religion in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica The Roman calendar was reformed by Julius Caesar in 45 BC. The Julian calendar was no longer dependent on the observation of the new moon but simply followed an algorithm of introducing a leap day every four years. This created a dissociation of the calendar month from the lunation. In the 11th century in Persia, a calendar reform led by Khayyam was announced in 1079, when the length of the year was measured as 365.24219858156 days. Given that the length of the year is changing in the sixth decimal place over a person's lifetime, this is outstandingly accurate. For comparison the length of the year at the end of the 19th century was 365.242196 days, while today it is 365.242190 days. The Gregorian calendar was introduced as a refinement of the Julian calendar in 1582, and is today in worldwide use as the de facto calendar for secular purposes. Etymology The term calendar itself is taken from the calends, the term for the first day of the month in the Roman calendar, related to the verb \\"to call out\\", referring to the calling or the announcement that the new moon was just seen. Latin meant \\"account book, register\\", as accounts were settled and debts were collected on the calends of each month. The Latin term was adopted in Old French as and from there into Middle English as by the 13th century. The spelling calendar is from Early Modern English. An alternative hypothesis connects \\"calendar\\" with koledari in Slavic, pre-Christian tradition, which was later incorporated into Christmas. Kolo means \\"circle, cycle\\" and dar means \\"a gift\\".

Thus 'Srishtyaabda' starts on the New Moon Day of the month of Caitra and ends with the Full Moon Day of Faalguna Month. Sristyaabda is 'Luni-Solar' like Vikramaabda, but tithi start from 1st day of the Month and ends on the last day of the month, the Full Moon Day.] Prehistory A number of prehistoric structures have been proposed as having had the purpose of timekeeping (typically keeping track of the course of the solar year). This includes many megalithic structures, and reconstructed arrangements going back far into the Neolithic period. In Victoria, Australia, a Wurdi Youang stone arrangement could date back more than 11,000 years, with some estimates dating it to be older than 20,000 years. This estimate is based on the inaccuracy of the calendar, which is consistent with how the Earth's supposed orbit is thought to have changed during that time. The site is found near the world's oldest known site of permanent aquaculture. A ceramic artefact from Bulgaria, known as the Slatino furnace model, has been pronounced by local archeologists and media to be the oldest known calendar representation, a claim not endorsed in mainstream views.Bailey D., 2000, Balkan Prehistory: Exclusion, Incorporation and Identity, London:Routledge p. 325 A mesolithic arrangement of twelve pits and an arc found in Warren Field, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, dated to roughly 10,000 years ago, has been described as a lunar calendar and was dubbed the \\"world's oldest known calendar\\" in 2013. The Oldest European calendar is found near to Vukovar in modern-day Croatia. It is a ceramic vessel bearing inscribed ideograms of celestial objects. Ancient Near East The ancient Sumerian calendar divided a year into 12 lunar months of 29 or 30 days. Each month began with the sighting of a new moon. Sumerian months had no uniform name throughout Sumer because of the religious diversity. This resulted in scribes and scholars referring to them as \\"the first month\\", \\"the fifth month\\", etc. To keep the lunar year of 354 days in step with the solar year of 365.242 days an extra month was added periodically, much like a Gregorian leap year. There were no weeks in the Sumerian calendar. Holy days and time off from work were usually celebrated on the first, seventh and fifteenth of each month. In addition to these holy days, there were also feast days which varied from city to city. Antiquity =Babylonia and Persia= Although the earliest evidence of Iranian calendrical traditions is from the second millennium BC, predating the appearance of the Iranian prophet Zoroaster, the first fully preserved calendar is that of the Achaemenids. Throughout recorded history, Persians have been keen on the idea and importance of having a calendar. They were among the first cultures to use a solar calendar and have long favoured a solar over lunar and lunisolar approaches. The sun has always been a symbol in Iranian culture and is closely related to the folklore regarding Cyrus the Great.  Old Persian calendar  Old Persian inscriptions and tablets indicate that early Iranians used a 360-day calendar based on the solar observation directly and modified for their beliefs. Days were not named. The months had two or three divisions depending on the phase of the moon. Twelve months of 30 days were named for festivals or activities of the pastoral year. A 13th month was added every six years to keep the calendar synchronized with the seasons.  Zoroastrian calendar  The first calendars based on Zoroastrian cosmology appeared in the later Achaemenid period (650 to 330 BC). They evolved over the centuries, but month names changed little until now. The unified Achaemenid Empire required a distinctive Iranian calendar, and one was devised in Egyptian tradition, with 12 months of 30 days, each dedicated to a yazata (Eyzad), and four divisions resembling the Semitic week. Four days per month were dedicated to Ahura Mazda and seven were named after the six Amesha Spentas. Thirteen days were named after Fire, Water, Sun, Moon, Tiri and Geush Urvan (the soul of all animals), Mithra, Sraosha (Soroush, yazata of prayer), Rashnu (the Judge), Fravashi, Bahram (yazata of victory), Raman (Ramesh meaning peace), and Vata, the divinity of the wind. Three were dedicated to the female divinities, Daena (yazata of religion and personified conscious), Ashi (yazata of fortune) and Arshtat (justice). The remaining four were dedicated to Asman (lord of sky or Heaven), Zam (earth), Manthra Spenta (the Bounteous Sacred Word) and Anaghra Raocha (the 'Endless Light' of paradise).  Modifications by Parthians, Ardashir I, Hormizd I, Yazdgerd III  The Parthians (Arsacid dynasty) adopted the same calendar system with minor modifications, and dated their era from 248 BC, the date they succeeded the Seleucids. Their names for the months and days are Parthian equivalents of the Avestan ones used previously, differing slightly from the Middle Persian names used by the Sassanians. For example, in Achaemenid times the modern Persian month 'Day' was called Dadvah (Creator), in Parthian it was Datush, and the Sassanians named it Dadv/Dai (Dadar in Pahlavi). When in April of AD 224 the Parthian dynasty fell and was replaced by the Sasanid, the new king, Ardashir I, abolished the official Babylonian calendar and replaced it with the Zoroastrian. This involved a correction to the places of the gahanbar, which had slipped back in the seasons since they were fixed. These were placed eight months later, as were the epagemonai, the 'Gatha' or 'Gah' days after the ancient Zoroastrian hymns of the same name. Other countries, such as the Armenians and Choresmians, did not accept the change.  The formation of the current Persian calendar in the 11th century  Toghril Beg, the founder of the Seljuq dynasty, had made Esfahan the capital of his domains and his grandson Malik-Shah was the ruler of that city from 1073. An invitation was sent to Khayyam from Malik-Shah and from his vizier Nizam al-Mulk asking Khayyam to go to Esfahan to set up an Observatory there. Other leading astronomers were also brought to the Observatory in Esfahan and for 18 years Khayyam led the scientists and produced work of outstanding quality. During this time Khayyam led work on compiling astronomical tables and he also contributed to calendar reform in 1079. Cowell quotes the Calcutta Review No 59: Khayyam measured the length of the year as 365.24219858156 days. Two comments on this result. Firstly it shows an incredible confidence to attempt to give the result to this degree of accuracy. We know now that the length of the year is changing in the sixth decimal place over a person's lifetime. Secondly it is outstandingly accurate. For comparison the length of the year at the end of the 19th century was 365.242196 days, while today it is 365.242190 days. =Classical Greece= The Greeks, as early as the time of Homer, appear to have been familiar with the division of the year into the twelve lunar months but no intercalary month Embolimos or day is then mentioned. Independent of the division of a month into days, it was divided into periods according to the increase and decrease of the moon. Thus, the first day or new moon was called Noumenia. The month in which the year began, as well as the names of the months, differed among the states, and in some parts even no names existed for the months, as they were distinguished only numerically, as the first, second, third, fourth month, etc. The ancient Athenian calendar was a lunisolar calendar with 354-day years, consisting of twelve months of alternating length of 29 or 30 days. To keep the calendar in line with the solar year of 365.242189 days, an extra, intercalary month was added in the years: 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, 19 of the 19-years Metonic cycle. See About the structure of the Attic Calendar The Athenian months were called Hekatombion, Metageitnion, Boedromion, Pyanepsion, Maimakterion, Poseidon, Gamelion, Anthesterion, Elaphebolion, Munychion, Thargelion, and Skirophorion. The intercalary month usually came after Poseidon, and was called second Poseidon. See also: Athenian Calendar. A reconstruction of the Attic Calendar is given by Academy of Episteme. In addition to their regular, \\"festival\\" calendar, the Athenians maintained a second, political calendar . This \\"conciliar\\" calendar divided the year into \\"prytanies\\", one for each of the \\"phylai\\", the subdivisions of Athenian citizens. The number of phylai, and hence the number of prytanies, varied over time. Until 307 BC, there were 10 phylai. After that the number varies between 11 and 13 (usually 12). Even more confusing, while the conciliar and festival years were about the same length in the 4th century BC, such was not regularly the case earlier or later. Documents dated by prytany are frequently very difficult to assign to a particular equivalent in the Julian calendar. The table of Greek Olympiads, following the four-year cycles between the Olympic Games from 1 July 776 BC, continued until the end of the 4th century AD.Davies, p 267 The Babylonian Era of Nabonassar, beginning on 26 February 747 BC, was used by the Greeks of Alexandria. It was later known in the Middle Ages from the works of Ptolemy. =Hellenistic period= The Greek calendars were greatly diversified by the Hellenistic period, with separate traditions in every Greek state. Of primary importance for the reconstruction of the regional Greek calendars is the calendar of Delphi, because of the numerous documents found there recording the manumission of slaves, many of which are dated both in the Delphian and in a regional calendar. The Macedonian Era of the Seleucids, which began with the conquest of Babylon by Seleucus Nicator in 312 BC. It became widely used in the Levant. The Jews knew it as the \\"era of contracts\\", and used it in Europe until the 15th century. The Roman Republican calendar numbered years based on the sitting consuls. References to the year of consulship were used in both conversation and official records. Romans from the same family often had the same praenomen, which sometimes makes it difficult to distinguish them, and there were two consuls at any one time, each of whom might sometimes hold the appointment more than once, meaning that it was (and is) necessary to be well educated in history to understand the references. The Romans had an eight-day week, with the market-day falling every eight days. It was called a nundinum or 'nine-day' in inclusive counting. Most of the regional Hindu calendars are inherited from a system standardized in classical Hindu astronomy as adopted via Indo-Greek transmission in the final centuries BC, and reformed by Gupta era astronomers such as ƒÄryabha·π≠a and VarƒÅhamihira. =China= Before the Spring and Autumn period (before 770 BC), the Chinese calendars were solar calendars. In the so- called five-phase calendar, the year consists of 10 months and a transition, each month being 36 days long, and the transitions 5 or 6 days. During the Warring States period (~475-220 BC), the primitive lunisolar calendars were established under the Zhou Dynasty, known as the six ancient calendars (). The months of these calendars begin on the day with the new moon, with 12 or 13 months (lunations) in a year. The intercalary month is placed at the end of the year. In Qin China, the Qin calendar () was introduced. It follows the rules of Zhuanxu's calendar, but the months order follows the Xia's calendar. =Vedic and Pre-Vedic Era /Ancient India = Timekeeping was important to Vedic rituals, and Jyotisha was the Vedic-era field of tracking and predicting the movements of astronomical bodies in order to keep time, in order to fix the day and time of these rituals, which were developed around the end of 2nd millennium BC as mentioned in \\"Sathapatha Brahmana\\". This study was one of the six ancient Vedangas, or ancillary science connected with the Vedas ‚Äì the scriptures of Hinduism, which was quoted by 5th-century BC scholar Yaska.James Lochtefeld (2002), \\"Jyotisha\\" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A‚ÄìM, Rosen Publishing, , pages 326‚Äì327 The ancient extant text on Jyotisha is the Vedanga-Jyotisha, which exists in two editions, one linked to Rigveda and other to Yajurveda. The Rigveda version is variously attributed to sage Lagadha, and sometimes to sage Shuci. The Yajurveda version credits no particular sage, has survived into the modern era with a commentary of Somakara, and is the more studied version. The Jyotisha text Brahma-siddhanta, probably composed in the 5th century AD, discusses how to use the movement of planets, sun and moon to keep time and calendar. This text also lists trigonometry and mathematical formulae to support its theory of orbits, predict planetary positions and calculate relative mean positions of celestial nodes and apsides. The text is notable for presenting very large integers, such as 4.32 billion years as the lifetime of the current universe. Water clock and sun dials are mentioned in many ancient Hindu texts such as the Arthashastra. The Jyotisha texts present mathematical formulae to predict the length of day time, sun rise and moon cycles. Modern Hindu calendar, sometimes referred to as Panchanga, is a collective term for the various lunisolar calendars traditionally used in Hinduism. They adopt a similar underlying concept for timekeeping, but differ in their relative emphasis to moon cycle or the sun cycle, the names of months and when they consider the New Year to start. The ancient Hindu calendar is similar in conceptual design to the Jewish calendar, but different from the Gregorian calendar. Unlike Gregorian calendar which adds additional days to lunar month to adjust for the mismatch between twelve lunar cycles (354 lunar days), Quote: \\"the lunar year consists of 354 days\\". and nearly 365 solar days, the Hindu calendar maintains the integrity of the lunar month, but insert an extra full month by complex rules, every few years, to ensure that the festivals and crop related rituals fall in the appropriate season. The Hindu calendars have been in use in the Indian subcontinent since ancient times, and remain in use by the Hindus in India and Nepal, particularly to set Hindu festival dates. Early Buddhist and Jain communities of India adopted the ancient Hindu calendar, later Vikrami calendar and then local Buddhist calendars. Buddhist and Jain festivals continue to be scheduled according to a lunar system in the luni-solar calendar. =Roman Empire= The old Roman year had 304 days divided into 10 months, beginning with March. However the ancient historian Livy gave credit to the second early Roman king Numa Pompilius for devising a calendar of 12 months. The extra months Ianuarius and Februarius had been invented, supposedly by Numa Pompilius, as stop-gaps. Julius Caesar realized that the system had become inoperable, so he effected drastic changes in the year of his third consulship. The New Year in 709 AUC began on 1 January and ran over 365 days until 31 December. Further adjustments were made under Augustus, who introduced the concept of the \\"leap year\\" in 757 AUC (AD 4). The resultant Julian calendar remained in almost universal use in Europe until 1582, and in some countries until as late as the twentieth century. Marcus Terentius Varro introduced the Ab urbe condita epoch, assuming a foundation of Rome in 753 BC. The system remained in use during the early Middle Ages until the widespread adoption of the Dionysian era in the Carolingian period. In the Roman Empire, the AUC year could be used alongside the consular year, so that the consulship of Quintus Fufius Calenus and Publius Vatinius could be determined as 707 AUC (or 47 BC), the third consulship of Caius Julius Caesar, with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, as 708 AUC (or 46 BC), and the fourth consulship of Gaius Julius Caesar as 709 AUC (or 45 BC). The seven-day week has a tradition reaching back to the ancient Near East, but the introduction of the \\"planetary week\\" which remains in modern use dates to the Roman Empire period (see also names of the days of the week). Middle Ages =Christian Europe= Page of a 10th- century calendar from Einsiedeln Abbey (16 March to 9 April) The page for May in the Bedford Psalter and Hours ms. (British Library Add MS 42131, fol. 3r, early 15th century) The oldest calendar of saints of the Church of Rome was compiled in the mid-4th century, under Pope Julius I or Pope Liberius. It contained both pagan and Christian festivals. The oldest extant manuscript of the early Christian calendar is the so-called Calendar of Filocalus, produced in AD 354. A more extensive martyrology was compiled by Jerome in the early 5th century. Jean Mabillon published a calendar of the church of Carthage made in ca. AD 483. The Anno Domini epoch is introduced in the 6th century. Extant calendars of the early medieval period are based on Jerome's system of numbering of the years of the Metonic cycle, later called the Golden Numbers. A Carolingian-era calendar published by Luc d'Achery is entitled Incipit Ordo Solaris Anni cum Litteris a S. Hieronymo superpositis, ad explorandum Septimanae Diem, et Lunae Aetatem investigandam in unoquoque Die per xix Annos. (\\"here begins the order of the solar year with the letters placed by Saint Jerome, for the purpose of finding the day of the week and the age of the Moon for any day within [the cycle of] 19 years\\").R.T. Hampson, Medii Aevi Kalendarium (1841), 389ff. The Leiden Aratea, a Carolingian copy (dated 816) of an astronomical treatise of Germanicus, is an important source for the transmission of the ancient Christian calendar to the medieval period.Bruce S. Eastwood, The Revival of Planetary Astronomy in Carolingian and Post- Carolingian Europe (2002). In the 8th century, the Anglo-Saxon historian Bede the Venerable used another Latin term, \\"ante uero incarnationis dominicae tempus\\" (\\"the time before the Lord's true incarnation\\", equivalent to the English \\"before Christ\\"), to identify years before the first year of this era. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, even Popes continued to date documents according to regnal years, and usage of AD only gradually became common in Europe from the 11th to the 14th centuries. In 1422, Portugal became the last Western European country to adopt the Anno Domini system. The Icelandic calendar was introduced in the 10th century. While the ancient Germanic calendars were based on lunar months, the new Icelandic calendar introduced a purely solar reckoning, with a year having a fixed number of weeks (52 weeks or 364 days). This necessitated the introduction of \\"leap weeks\\" instead of the Julian leap days. In 1267, the medieval scientist Roger Bacon stated the times of full moons as a number of hours, minutes, seconds, thirds, and fourths (horae, minuta, secunda, tertia, and quarta) after noon on specified calendar dates.The Opus Majus of Roger Bacon, tr. Robert Belle Burke (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1928, reprinted 2000) table facing page 231, . Although a third for of a second remains in some languages, for example Arabic ÿ´ÿßŸÑÿ´ÿ©, the modern second is further divided decimally. Rival calendar eras to Anno Domini remained in use in Christian Europe. In Spain, the \\"Era of the Caesars\\" was dated from Octavian's conquest of Iberia in 39 BC. It was adopted by the Visigoths and remained in use in Catalonia until 1180, Castille until 1382 and Portugal until 1415. For chronological purposes, the flaw of the Anno Domini system was that dates have to be reckoned backwards or forwards according as they are BC or AD. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, \\"in an ideally perfect system all events would be reckoned in one sequence. The difficulty was to find a starting point whence to reckon, for the beginnings of history in which this should naturally be placed are those of which chronologically we know least.\\" For both Christians and Jews, the prime historical date was the Year of Creation, or Annus Mundi.Davies, p 268 The Eastern Orthodox Church fixed the date of Creation at 5509 BC. This remained the basis of the ecclesiastical calendar in the Greek and Russian Orthodox world until modern times. The Coptic Church fixed on 5500 BC. Later, the Church of England, under Archbishop Ussher in 1650, would pick 4004 BC. =Islamic calendar= The Islamic calendar is based on the prohibition of intercalation (nasi') by Muhammad, in Islamic tradition dated to a sermon held on 9 Dhu al-Hijjah AH 10 (Julian date: 6 March 632). This resulted in an observationally based lunar calendar shifting relative to the seasons of the solar year. During the Mughal rule, land taxes were collected from Bengali people according to the Islamic Hijri calendar. This calendar was a lunar calendar, and its new year did not coincide with the solar agricultural cycles. According to some sources, Mughal Emperor Akbar asked his royal astronomer Fathullah Shirazi to create a new calendar by combining the lunar Islamic calendar and solar Hindu calendar already in use, and this was known as Fasholi shan (harvest calendar). According to Amartya Sen, Akbar's official calendar \\"Tarikh-ilahi\\" with the zero year of 1556 AD was a blend of pre-existing Hindu and Islamic calendars. It was not used much in India outside of Akbar's Mughal court, and after his death the calendar he launched was abandoned. However, adds Sen, there are traces of the \\"Tarikh-ilahi\\" that survive in the Bengali calendar. Some historians attribute the Bengali calendar to the 7th-century Hindu king Shashanka. =Other= The ancient Taichu calendar of China was refined in the medieval period. The D√†m√≠ng Calendar (), created in the Liang dynasty by Zu Chongzhi, introduced the equinoxes. The use of a syzygy to determine the lunar month was first described in the Tang dynasty W√πy√≠n Yu√°n Calendar (). The Yuan dynasty (13th/14th century) Sh√≤ush√≠ calendar () used spherical trigonometry to find the length of the tropical year. This calendar had a 365.2425-day year, identical to the Gregorian calendar. A number of other epichoric calendars are tentatively reconstructed for the medieval period. Such reconstructions are mostly limited to a list of month names, as is the case with the pre-Christian Germanic calendar as well as with the Bulgar calendar, which was supposedly in use among the Bulgars in the 10th century, as reconstructed from the 15th- century Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans. Mesoamerica Of all the ancient calendar systems, the Maya and other Mesoamerican systems are the most complex. The Mayan calendar had two years, the 260-day Sacred Round, or tzolkin, and the 365-day Vague Year, or haab. Ahau, after which the 20th day of the tzolkin cycle was named The Sacred Round of 260 days is composed of two smaller cycles: the numbers 1 through 13, coupled with 20 different day names: Imix, Ik, Akbal, Kan, Chicchan, Cimi, Manik, Lamat, Muluc, Oc, Chuen, Eb, Ben, Ix, Men, Cib, Caban, Eiznab, Cauac, and Ahau. The Sacred Round was used to determine important activities related to the gods and humans: name individuals, predict the future, decide on auspicious dates for battles, marriages, and so on. The two cycles of 13 and 20 intermesh and are repeated without interruption: the cycle would begin with 1 Imix, then 2 Ik, then 3 Akbal and so on until the number 13 was reached, at which point the number cycle was restarted so 13 Ben would be followed by 1 Ix, 2 Men and so on. This time Imix would be numbered 8. The cycle ended after 260 days, with the last day being 13 Ahau. The Vague Year of 365 days is similar to our modern calendar, consisting of 18 months of 20 days each, with an unlucky five-day period at the end. The Vague Year had to do primarily with the seasons and agriculture, and was based on the solar cycle. The 18 Maya months are known, in order, as: Pop, Uo, Zip, Zotz, Tzec, Xuc, Yaxkin, Mol, Chen, Yax, Zac, Ceh, Mac, Kankin, Maun, Pax, Kayab and Cumku. The unlucky five-day period was known as Uayeb, and was considered a time which could hold danger, death and bad luck. The Vague Year began with the month of Pop. The Maya 20-day month always begins with the seating of the month, followed by days numbered 1 to 19, then the seating of the following month, and so on. This ties in with the Maya notion that each month influences the next. The Maya new year would start with 1 Pop, followed by 2 Pop, all the way through to 19 Pop, followed by the seating of the month of Uo, written as 0 Uo, then 1 Uo, 2 Uo and so on. These two cycles coincided every 52 years. The 52-year period of time was called a \\"bundle\\" and was similar to a modern-day century. Modern calendars While the Gregorian calendar is now in worldwide use for secular purposes, various medieval or ancient calendars remain in regional use for religious or social purposes, including the Julian calendar, the Hebrew calendar, the Islamic calendar, various Hindu calendars, the Zoroastrian calendar, etc. There are also various modern calendars that see limited use, either created for the use of new religious movements or reformed versions of older religious calendars, or calendars introduced by regionalist or nationalist movements. *Javanese calendar (1633) *J≈çky≈ç calendar (1685) *French Republican calendar (1793) *Bah√°'√≠ calendar (1873) *Solar Hijri calendar (1925) *Pataphysical calendar (1949) *Indian national calendar (1957) *Discordian calendar (1963) *Juche calendar (1997) See also * Week-day names * History of timekeeping devices References External links * \\"The Calendar\\", BBC Radio 4 discussion with Robert Poole, Kristen Lippincott and Peter Watson (In Our Time, 19 December 2002) Calendars Calendars ","title":"History of calendars"},{"id":"295891","text":"In Canada, the 1955 Governor General's Awards for Literary Merit were the nineteenth such awards.

Retrieved 10 November 2009, Dictionary.com. Zero-tolerance policies forbid people in positions of authority from exercising discretion or changing punishments to fit the circumstances subjectively; they are required to impose a pre- determined punishment regardless of individual culpability, extenuating circumstances, or history. This pre-determined punishment, whether mild or severe, is always meted out. Zero-tolerance policies are studied in criminology and are common in formal and informal policing systems around the world. The policies also appear in informal situations where there may be sexual harassment or Internet misuse in educational and workplace environments. In 2014, the mass incarceration in the United States based upon minor offenses has resulted in an outcry on the use of zero tolerance in schools and communities.Ben-Moshe, L., Chapman, C. & Carey, A.C.

In: Carey, A., Ben-Moshe, L., & Chapman, C., Disability Incarcerated: Imprisonment and Disability in the United States and Canada. NY, NY: Palgrave MacMillan. Little evidence supports the claimed effectiveness of zero-tolerance policies.Rowe & Bendersky, 2002 One underlying problem is that there are a great many reasons why people hesitate to intervene, or to report behavior they find to be unacceptable or unlawful. Zero-tolerance policies address, at best, only a few of these reasons.‚ÄòDealing with‚Äîor Reporting‚Äî\\"Unacceptable\\" Behavior ‚Äì with additional thoughts about the Bystander Effect‚Äô 2009 Mary Rowe MIT, Linda Wilcox HMS, Howard Gadlin NIH, JIOA, vol 2, no 1, p. 52. Etymology According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the first recorded use of the term \\"zero tolerance\\" was in 1972. It was originally used in politics in the United States. An earlier use of the term came in the mid-1960s, in reference to an absolute ban of the pesticide heptachlor by the United States Food and Drug Administration; for example, in an article that appeared in the June 1963 issue of Popular Mechanics, it is stated that \\"Heptachlor, though, is even more toxic and has been given a 'zero tolerance' by the FDA; that is, not even the slightest trace of heptachlor is permitted on food.\\"Clifford B. Hicks, \\"And Was It a Silent Spring?\\", Popular Mechanics 119 (6), June 1963, p. 87. History The idea behind zero-tolerance policies can be traced back to the Safe and Clean Neighborhoods Act, approved in New Jersey in 1973, which has the same underlying assumptions.Tonello 2007.Wacquant, Lo√Øc 1999.Marshall 1999, p. 2. The ideas behind the 1973 New Jersey policy were later popularized in 1982, when a US cultural magazine, The Atlantic Monthly, published an article by James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling about the broken windows theory of crime.Wilson & Kelling 1982. Their name for the idea comes from the following example: According to scholars, zero tolerance is the concept of giving carte blanche to the police for the inflexible repression of minor offenses, homeless people, and the disorders associated with them. A well- known criticism to this approach is that it redefines social problems in terms of security,Wacquant, Lo√Øc 1999: \\"une comparaison m√©thodique montrerait tout de suite que la pr√©tendue ¬´ mont√©e inexorable ¬ª des ¬´ violences urbaines ¬ª est avant tout une th√©matique politico-m√©diatique visant √† faciliter la red√©finition des probl√®mes sociaux en termes de s√©curit√©\\", Eng.: \\"A comparison would show immediately that the so-called \\"inexorable rise\\" of the \\"urban violence\\" is first and foremost a political-media theme aimed at facilitating the redefinition of social problems in terms of security\\". it considers the poor as criminals, and it reduces crimes to only \\"street crimes\\", those committed by lower social classes, excluding white-collar crimes.Wacquant, Lo√Øc 2002. On the historical examples of the application of zero tolerance kind of policies, nearly all the scientific studies conclude that it didn't play a leading role in the reduction of crimes, a role which is claimed by its advocates. On the other hand, large majorities of people who are living in communities in which zero tolerance policing has been followed believe that in fact it has played a key, leading role in reducing crime in their communities. It has been alleged that in New York City, the decline of crimes rate started well before Rudy Giuliani came to power in 1993, and none of the decreasing processes had particular inflection under himFagan et al. 1998. and that in the same period, the decrease in crime was the same in the other major US cities, even those with an opposite security policy. But the experience of the vast majority of New Yorkers led them to precisely the opposite conclusion and allowed a Republican to win and retain the Mayor's office for the first time in decades in large part because of the perception that zero tolerance policing was key to the improving crime situation in New York City. On the other hand, some argue that in the years 1984‚Äì87 New York already experienced a policy similar to Giuliani's one, but it faced a crime increase instead. Two American specialists, Edward Maguire, a Professor at American University, and John Eck from the University of Cincinnati, rigorously evaluated all the scientific work designed to test the effectiveness of the police in the fight against crime. They concluded that \\"neither the number of policemen engaged in the battle, or internal changes and organizational culture of law enforcement agencies (such as the introduction of community policing) have by themselves any impact on the evolution of offenses.\\"Eck & Maguire 2000. They argue that crime decrease was due not to the work of the police and judiciary, but to economic and demographic factors. The main ones were an unprecedented economic growth with jobs for millions of young people, and a shift from the use of crack towards other drugs.Bowling 1999. An alternative argument comes from Kelling and William Bratton, Giuliani's original police chief, who argue that broken windows policing methods did contribute to the decrease in crime, but that they were not a form of zero tolerance: Sheldon Wein has set out a list of six characteristics of a zero tolerance policy:, Centre for Research on Reasoning, Argumentation, and Rhetoric (CRRAR) publishing. #Full enforcement (all those for whom there is adequate evidence that they have violated the rule are to be identified) #Lack of prosecutorial discretion (for every plausibly accused person, it is determined whether the person has in fact violated the policy) #Strict constructivist interpretation (no room for narrow interpretation of the rule) #Strict liability (no excuses or justifications) #Mandatory punishment (not under a mandatory minimum penalty) #Harsh punishment (mandatory minimum penalty is considered relatively harsh given the nature of the offence). Wein sees these points as representing \\"focal meaning\\" of the concept, namely, that not each one need be met literally, yet that any policy that clearly meets all six of these conditions would definitely be seen as a case of a zero tolerance policy. Applications =Bullying in the workplace= Various institutions have undertaken zero-tolerance policies, for example, in the military, in the workplace, and in schools, in an effort to eliminate various kinds of illegal behavior, such as harassment. Proponents hope that such policies will underscore the commitment of administrators to prevent such behavior. Others raise a concern about that use of zero-tolerance policies, a concern that derives from analysis of errors of omission versus errors of commission. The reasoning is that failure to proscribe unacceptable behavior may lead to errors of omission, and too little will be done. However, zero tolerance may be seen as a kind of ruthless management, which may lead to a perception of \\"too much being done.\\" If people fear that their co-workers or fellow students may be fired, terminated, or expelled, they may not come forward at all when they see behavior deemed unacceptable. (That is a classic example of Type I and type II errors.) Too stringent a policy may actually reduce reports of illegal behavior.\\"Workplace Justice, Zero Tolerance and Zero Barriers: Getting People to Come Forward in Conflict Management Systems,\\" with Corinne Bendersky, in Negotiations and Change, From the Workplace to Society, Thomas Kochan and Richard Locke (editors), Cornell University Press, 2002. =Narcotics= In the United States, zero tolerance, as an approach against drugs, was originally designed as a part of the War on Drugs under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, ostensibly to curb the transfer of drugs at the borders. Law enforcement was to target the drug users rather than the transporters or suppliers under the assumptions that harsh sentences and strict enforcement of personal use would reduce demand and strike at root cause of the drug problem. The policy did not require additional laws; instead, existing law was enacted with less leniency.See zero tolerance in Similar concepts in other countries, such as Sweden,UNODC: Sweden's successful drug policy, 2007 Italy, Japan, Singapore China, India, and Russia have since been labeled zero tolerance. A consistence of zero tolerance is the absolute dichotomy between the legality of any use and no use, equating all illicit drugs and any form of use as undesirable and harmful to society. That is contrasting to viewpoints of those who stress the disparity in harmfulness among drugs and would like to distinguish between occasional drug use and problem drug use. Although some harm reductionists also see drug use as generally undesirable, they hold that the resources would do more good if they were allocated toward helping problem drug users, instead of combating all drug users.Ming-sum Tsui \\"The harm reduction approach revisited: An international perspective\\" International Social Work 2000, vol 43, page 243 For example, research from Switzerland indicates that emphasis on problem drug users \\"seems to have contributed to the image of heroin as unattractive for young people.\\" More generally, zero-tolerance advocates holds the aim at ridding the society of all illicit drug use and that criminal justice has an important role in that endeavor. The Swedish parliament for example set the vision a drug-free society as the official goal for the drug policy in 1978. The visions were to prompt new practices inspired by Nils Bejerot, which were later called zero tolerance. In 1980, the Swedish attorney general dropped the practice of giving waivers for possession of drugs for personal use after years of lowering the thresholds. The same year, police began to prioritize drug users and street-level drug crimes over drug distributors. In 1988, all non-medicinally prescribed usage became illegal, and in 1993, the enforcement of personal use was eased by permitting the police to take blood or urine samples from suspects. The unrelenting approach towards drug users, together with generous treatment opportunities, has received UNODC's approval, and it is cited by the UN as one of the main reasons for Sweden's relatively low drug prevalence rates. However, that interpretation of the statistics and the more general success of Sweden's drug policies are disputed.Cohen, Peter (2006). Looking at the UN, smelling a rat. Amsterdam: CEDRO. =Driving= The term is used in the context of driving under the influence of alcohol to refer to a lower illegal blood alcohol content for drivers under the age of 21. In the US, the legal limit in almost all states is .08%. Utah is the exception, with .05% being the limit. For drivers under 21, the prohibited level in 16 states is .01% or .02%, which is also true in Puerto Rico, despite its drinking age of 18. In Europe, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, and Sweden have zero- tolerance laws for drugs and driving, as opposed to the other main legal approach in which laws forbidding impaired driving are enacted instead. Legislation varies in different countries that practice zero tolerance on drug use for drivers. Only a limited set of (common) drugs is included in the zero- tolerance legislation in Germany and Belgium, but in Finland and Sweden, all controlled substances fall into the scope of zero tolerance unless they are covered by a prescription.P. Lillsunde, T. Gunnar \\"Drugs and driving: The Finnish perspective\\" Bulletin on Narcotics, vol. LVII, Nos. 1 and 2, 2005 page 214] In Argentina, the Cordoba State Highway Patrol enforces a zero-tolerance policy. In Asia, Japan also practices zero-tolerance, and people will receive a fine and can be fired for DUI, even the next morning if there are still traces of alcohol. Foreigners may even be deported. =In schools= Zero- tolerance policies have been adopted in schools and other education venues around the world. The policies are usually promoted as preventing drug abuse, violence, and gang activity in schools. In schools, common zero-tolerance policies concern possession or use of drugs or weapons. Students and sometimes staff, parents, and other visitors, who possess a banned item or perform any prohibited action for any reason are automatically punished. School administrators are barred from using their judgment, reducing severe punishments to be proportional to minor offenses, or considering extenuating circumstances. For example, the policies treat possession of a knife identically, regardless of whether the knife is a blunt table knife being used to eat a meal, a craft knife used in an art class, or switchblade with no reasonable practical or educational value. Consequently, the policies are sometimes derided as \\"zero-intelligence policies\\". There is no credible evidence of zero tolerance reducing violence or drug abuse by students.Russell J. Skiba Zero Tolerance, Zero Evidence: An Analysis of School Disciplinary Practice Policy Research Report #SRS2 August, 2000Are Zero Tolerance Policies Effective in the Schools? An evidentiary review and recommendations. American Psychologist, December 2008.Zero Tolerance Policies: no substitute for good judgment Summary of the APA Task Force Report at everydaypsychology.com The unintended negative consequences are clearly documented and sometimes severe: school suspension and expulsion result in a number of negative outcomes for both schools and students. Although the policies are facially neutral, minority children are the most likely to suffer the negative consequences of zero tolerance. The policies have also resulted in embarrassing publicity for schools and have been struck down by the courts and by Departments of Education, and they have been weakened by legislatures. Criticism Some critics have argued that zero-tolerance policing violates the Law Enforcement Code of Conduct passed by the International Association of Chiefs of Police: \\"The fundamental duties of a police officer include serving the community, safeguarding lives and property, protecting the innocent, keeping the peace and ensuring the rights of all to liberty, equality and justice\\"Robinson, 2002>. The code requires that police behave in a courteous and fair manner, treat all citizens in a respectable and decent manner, never use unnecessary force. As Robinson (2002: 206) explains: Critics say that zero-tolerance policing fails because it destroys several important requisites for successful community policing; police accountability, openness to the public, and community cooperation (Cox and Wade 1998: 106). Zero tolerance violates principles of health and human services and standards for the education and healthy growth of children, families and communities. Even traditional community service providers in the 1970s aimed for \\"services for all\\" (such as zero reject), instead of 100% societal exclusion (zero tolerance). Public administration and disabilityhas supported principles that include education, employment, housing, transportation, recreation, and political participation in the community.Racino, J. (2014). Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US. London: CRC Press, Francis and Taylor. which zero-tolerance groups claim are not a right in the US. Opponents of zero tolerance believe that such a policy neglects investigation on a case- by-case basis and may lead to unreasonably harsh penalties for crimes that may not warrant such penalties in reality. Another criticism of zero-tolerance policies is that it gives officers and the legal system little discretion in dealing with offenders. Zero-tolerance policies may prohibit their enforcers from making the punishment fit the crime. It also may cause offenders to go farther since they know that if the punishment is the same for a little or a lot. That phenomenon of human nature is described in an adage that dates back to at least the 17th century, \\"might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb\\". Until 1820, the English law prescribed hanging for stealing anything worth more than one shilling, whether it was a low-value lamb or a whole flock of sheep.Christine Ammer (1997) The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms. Houghton Mifflin. p. 279. In the kids for cash scandal, Judge Mark Ciavarella, who promoted a platform of zero tolerance, received kickbacks for constructing a private prison that housed juvenile offenders and then proceeded to fill the prison by sentencing children to extended stays in juvenile detention for offenses as minimal as mocking a principal on Myspace, scuffles in hallways, trespassing in a vacant building, and shoplifting DVDs from Walmart. Critics of zero-tolerance policies argue that harsh punishments for minor offences are normalized. The documentary Kids for Cash interviews experts on adolescent behaviour who argue that the zero-tolerance model has become a dominant approach to policing juvenile offences after the Columbine shooting. Recently, argumentation theorists (especially Sheldon Wein) have suggested that, frequently, when people advocate adopting a zero tolerance policy, they commit what he has called the \\"zero tolerance fallacy\\".\\"Intolerance and the Zero Tolerance Fallacy\\", What do We Know about the World? Rhetorical & Argumentative Perspectives (edited by Gabrijela Ki≈°iƒçek and Igor ≈Ω. ≈Ωagar), co-published by the Digital Library Dissertationes (Educational Research Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia) and the Centre for Research on Reasoning, Argumentation, and Rhetoric, Windsor Studies in Argumentation, University of Windsor Press, 2013 (pages 132 to 144). Subsequently, Wein has proposed standards which arguments for zero tolerance policies must meet in order to avoid such fallacious inferences.For more on the virtues and vices of zero tolerance arguments, see , Centre for Research on Reasoning, Argumentation, and Rhetoric (CRRAR) publishing, 2014.

Carl Hilty (28 February 1833 ‚Äì 12 October 1909) was a Swiss philosopher, professor, politician, writer, and lawyer. He famously said: \\"Peace is only a hair's breadth away from war.\\" Although a Christian, he was no pacifist, and expected the coming world war. He also served as a high officer in the Swiss Army. He was married to a German wife named Johanna Gaertner. Hilty was a spokesman for women's rights to vote and to be elected, several decades before the subject became mainstream. Hilty argued that Switzerland, as a nation-state comprising several nationalities and languages, had a unique mission of demonstrating that a nation-state could transcend tribal tendencies. Carl Hilty was born in Ort Werdenberg, Switzerland, and studied at the Universities of G√∂ttingen and Heidelberg. To improve languages and see the world, he also spent some time in London and Paris. He then began his work as a lawyer in Chur, where he lived for almost 20 years. In 1874, he became a professor of constitutional law (Staats- und Volkerrecht) at the University of Bern. From 1886, he edited Politisches Jahrbuch der schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft (The Journal of Swiss Jurisprudence). In 1890, he became a member of the Nationalrat, the Swiss parliament. Hilty's philosophical concern was practical in nature. He wrote about happiness, the meaning of life and work, developing good habits, time management, and winning the battles of life. He became famous from his writings about happiness, which first appeared in three volumes in 1891, 1895 and 1899. These essays were eventually collected into a single volume entitled: \\"Happiness: Essays on the Meaning of Life\\". In this work, Hilty combines ancient stoic thought with Christian beliefs. The work was translated into English by Prof. Francis Greenwood Peabody, Professor of Christian Morals at Harvard University, and first appeared in the United States in 1903. Hilty supported the Salvation Army, which opened their services in Zurich. At first he made jokes about their noisy appearance, but only a few years later, he recognized them as one of the few groups who were able to put the words of Jesus in practice. Hilty was in his time one of the few intellectuals who still believed in the Gospel, while many other intellectuals dedicated themselves to the so-called \\"monastic\\" philosophy following the new sciences after Darwin. He believed in a new reformation beyond the dogmas of churches and politics, after the time of materialism. Hilty's work influenced the thinking of William James. He died in Clarens in 1909.

Chapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code provides an individual the opportunity to propose a plan of reorganization to reorganize their financial affairs while under the bankruptcy court's protection. The purpose of chapter 13 is to enable an individual with a regular source of income to propose a chapter 13 plan that provides for their various classes of creditors. Under chapter 13, the Bankruptcy Court has the power to approve a chapter 13 plan without the approval of creditors as long as it meets the statutory requirements under chapter 13. Chapter 13 plans are usually three to five years in length and may not exceed five years. Chapter 13 is in contrast to the purpose of Chapter 7, which does not provide for a plan of reorganization, but provides for the discharge of certain debt and the liquidation of non-exempt property. A Chapter 13 plan may be looked at as a form of debt consolidation, but a Chapter 13 allows a person to achieve much more than simply consolidating his or her unsecured debt such as credit cards and personal loans. A chapter 13 plan may provide for the four general categories of debt: priority claims, secured claims, priority unsecured claims, and general unsecured claims. Chapter 13 plans are often used to cure arrearages on a mortgage, avoid \\"underwater\\" junior mortgages or other liens, pay back taxes over time, or partially repay general unsecured debt. In recent years, some bankruptcy courts have allowed Chapter 13 to be used as a platform to expedite a mortgage modification application. Choice of chapter An individual who is badly in debt can typically file for bankruptcy either under Chapter 7 (liquidation, or straight bankruptcy) or Chapter 13 (reorganization). In some cases options may also include Chapter 12 (family farmer reorganization) and Chapter 11 (reorganization of a company, or an individual debtor whose debts exceed the limits for a Chapter 13 filing). As a Chapter 11 bankruptcy is considerably more complex and expensive than a Chapter 13 case, few debtors will choose Chapter 11 if a Chapter 13 bankruptcy is an option. Debtors may also be forced into bankruptcy by creditors in the case of an involuntary bankruptcy, but only under Chapters 7 or 11. However, in most instances the debtor may choose under which chapter to file. In the case of an involuntary bankruptcy, the debtor may also choose to convert from the forced Chapter 7 or 11 proceeding into a proceeding under another chapter. The debtor's financial characteristics and the type of relief sought plays a tremendous role in the choice of chapters. In some cases the debtor simply cannot file under Chapter 13, as he or she lacks the disposable income necessary to fund a viable Chapter 13 plan (see below). Furthermore, Section 109(e) of Title 11, United States Code sets forth debt limits for individuals to be eligible to file under Chapter 13: unsecured debts of less than $394,725.00, and secured debts of less than $1,184,200.00. Under Chapter 13, the debtor proposes a plan to pay his or her creditors over a 3-to-5 year period. This written plan details all of the transactions (and their durations) that will occur, and repayment according to the plan must begin within 30 to 45 days after the case has started. During this period, his or her creditors cannot attempt to collect on the individual's previously incurred debt except through the bankruptcy court. In general, the individual gets to keep his property, and his or her creditors end up with less money than they would, were the amount given to the debtor to continue collecting interest, allowing the debtor to find a way to pay the amount owed without losing their assets entirely. =Disadvantages= The disadvantage of filing for personal bankruptcy is that, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a record of this stays on the individual's credit report for up to 7 years (up to 10 years for Chapter 7). But it is possible to obtain new debt or credit (credit cards, Auto, or consumer loans) after 12‚Äì24 months, and a new FHA mortgage loan 25 months after discharge and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan after 36 months. But during the pendency of a Chapter 13 case the debtor is not permitted to obtain additional credit without the permission of the bankruptcy court. Moreover, creditors may not be willing to risk lending money to such an individual. However, this disadvantage is not unique to Chapter 13; it may also apply to individuals currently in a Chapter 11 case, Chapter 12 case or those who are in or have recently been in a Chapter 7 case. =Advantages= The advantages of Chapter 13 over Chapter 7 include the ability to: stop foreclosures although a foreclosure would be reinstated upon completion of the bankruptcy; achieve a super discharge of debts of kinds not dischargeable under Chapter 7;The BAPCPA amendments diminished the extent of the super discharge, but discharges under chapter 13 remain broader than those under 7. They include the ability to discharge some tortious damage claims, untimely filed tax claims, marital settlement debts, and some others. See 11 U.S.C. 1328. value collateral; bifurcate the security interest of creditors in certain property that creditors are either charging too much interest for, or are over-secured, or both, and leading to a cram down modification of the debt; prevent collection activities against non-filing co-signers (co-debtors) during the life of the case. Chapter 13 plan A Chapter 13 plan is a document filed with or shortly after a debtor's Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. The plan details the treatment of debts, liens, and the secured status of assets and liabilities owned or owed by the debtor in regard to his bankruptcy petition. In order for plans to take effect, it must meet a number of requirements. These are specified in ¬ß 1325 and include: * providing that unsecured creditors will receive at least as much through the chapter 13 plan as they would in a chapter 7 liquidation * either not be objected to, repay all creditors in full, or commit all of the debtor's disposable income to the Chapter 13 plan for at least three years (or five years for a debtor who makes an above median income) References Further reading External links * United States Bankruptcy Code via Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute * National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys * United States Courts, Bankruptcy United States bankruptcy legislation Title 11 of the United States Code ","title":"Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code"},{"id":"295917","text":"Noncommutative geometry (NCG) is a branch of mathematics concerned with a geometric approach to noncommutative algebras, and with the construction of spaces that are locally presented by noncommutative algebras of functions (possibly in some generalized sense). A noncommutative algebra is an associative algebra in which the multiplication is not commutative, that is, for which xy does not always equal yx; or more generally an algebraic structure in which one of the principal binary operations is not commutative; one also allows additional structures, e.g. topology or norm, to be possibly carried by the noncommutative algebra of functions. Motivation The main motivation is to extend the commutative duality between spaces and functions to the noncommutative setting. In mathematics, spaces, which are geometric in nature, can be related to numerical functions on them. In general, such functions will form a commutative ring. For instance, one may take the ring C(X) of continuous complex-valued functions on a topological space X. In many cases (e.g., if X is a compact Hausdorff space), we can recover X from C(X), and therefore it makes some sense to say that X has commutative topology. More specifically, in topology, compact Hausdorff topological spaces can be reconstructed from the Banach algebra of functions on the space (Gelfand‚ÄìNaimark). In commutative algebraic geometry, algebraic schemes are locally prime spectra of commutative unital rings (A. Grothendieck), and schemes can be reconstructed from the categories of quasicoherent sheaves of modules on them (P. Gabriel‚ÄìA. Rosenberg). For Grothendieck topologies, the cohomological properties of a site are invariants of the corresponding category of sheaves of sets viewed abstractly as a topos (A. Grothendieck). In all these cases, a space is reconstructed from the algebra of functions or its categorified version‚Äîsome category of sheaves on that space. Functions on a topological space can be multiplied and added pointwise hence they form a commutative algebra; in fact these operations are local in the topology of the base space, hence the functions form a sheaf of commutative rings over the base space. The dream of noncommutative geometry is to generalize this duality to the duality between noncommutative algebras, or sheaves of noncommutative algebras, or sheaf-like noncommutative algebraic or operator-algebraic structures, and geometric entities of certain kinds, and give an interaction between the algebraic and geometric description of those via this duality. Regarding that the commutative rings correspond to usual affine schemes, and commutative C*-algebras to usual topological spaces, the extension to noncommutative rings and algebras requires non-trivial generalization of topological spaces as \\"non-commutative spaces\\". For this reason there is some talk about non-commutative topology, though the term also has other meanings. =Applications in mathematical physics= Some applications in particle physics are described in the entries Noncommutative standard model and Noncommutative quantum field theory. The sudden rise in interest in noncommutative geometry in physics follows after the speculations of its role in M-theory made in 1997. =Motivation from ergodic theory= Some of the theory developed by Alain Connes to handle noncommutative geometry at a technical level has roots in older attempts, in particular in ergodic theory. The proposal of George Mackey to create a virtual subgroup theory, with respect to which ergodic group actions would become homogeneous spaces of an extended kind, has by now been subsumed. Noncommutative C*-algebras, von Neumann algebras (The formal duals of) non-commutative C*-algebras are often now called non-commutative spaces. This is by analogy with the Gelfand representation, which shows that commutative C*-algebras are dual to locally compact Hausdorff spaces. In general, one can associate to any C*-algebra S a topological space ≈ú; see spectrum of a C*-algebra. For the duality between œÉ-finite measure spaces and commutative von Neumann algebras, noncommutative von Neumann algebras are called non-commutative measure spaces. Noncommutative differentiable manifolds A smooth Riemannian manifold M is a topological space with a lot of extra structure. From its algebra of continuous functions C(M) we only recover M topologically. The algebraic invariant that recovers the Riemannian structure is a spectral triple. It is constructed from a smooth vector bundle E over M, e.g. the exterior algebra bundle. The Hilbert space L2(M, E) of square integrable sections of E carries a representation of C(M) by multiplication operators, and we consider an unbounded operator D in L2(M, E) with compact resolvent (e.g. the signature operator), such that the commutators [D, f] are bounded whenever f is smooth. A recent deep theoremConnes, Alain, On the spectral characterization of manifolds, arXiv:0810.2088v1 states that M as a Riemannian manifold can be recovered from this data. This suggests that one might define a noncommutative Riemannian manifold as a spectral triple (A, H, D), consisting of a representation of a C*-algebra A on a Hilbert space H, together with an unbounded operator D on H, with compact resolvent, such that [D, a] is bounded for all a in some dense subalgebra of A. Research in spectral triples is very active, and many examples of noncommutative manifolds have been constructed. Noncommutative affine and projective schemes In analogy to the duality between affine schemes and commutative rings, we define a category of noncommutative affine schemes as the dual of the category of associative unital rings. There are certain analogues of Zariski topology in that context so that one can glue such affine schemes to more general objects. There are also generalizations of the Cone and of the Proj of a commutative graded ring, mimicking a theorem of Serre on Proj. Namely the category of quasicoherent sheaves of O-modules on a Proj of a commutative graded algebra is equivalent to the category of graded modules over the ring localized on Serre's subcategory of graded modules of finite length; there is also analogous theorem for coherent sheaves when the algebra is Noetherian. This theorem is extended as a definition of noncommutative projective geometry by Michael Artin and J. J. Zhang, who add also some general ring-theoretic conditions (e.g. Artin‚ÄìSchelter regularity). Many properties of projective schemes extend to this context. For example, there exists an analog of the celebrated Serre duality for noncommutative projective schemes of Artin and Zhang. A. L. Rosenberg has created a rather general relative concept of noncommutative quasicompact scheme (over a base category), abstracting Grothendieck's study of morphisms of schemes and covers in terms of categories of quasicoherent sheaves and flat localization functors.A. L. Rosenberg, Noncommutative schemes, Compositio Mathematica 112 (1998) 93--125, doi; Underlying spaces of noncommutative schemes, preprint MPIM2003-111, dvi, ps; MSRI lecture Noncommutative schemes and spaces (Feb 2000): video There is also another interesting approach via localization theory, due to Fred Van Oystaeyen, Luc Willaert and Alain Verschoren, where the main concept is that of a schematic algebra.Freddy van Oystaeyen, Algebraic geometry for associative algebras, - New York: Dekker, 2000.- 287 p. - (Monographs and textbooks in pure and applied mathematics, 232) Invariants for noncommutative spaces Some of the motivating questions of the theory are concerned with extending known topological invariants to formal duals of noncommutative (operator) algebras and other replacements and candidates for noncommutative spaces. One of the main starting points of Alain Connes' direction in noncommutative geometry is his discovery of a new homology theory associated to noncommutative associative algebras and noncommutative operator algebras, namely the cyclic homology and its relations to the algebraic K-theory (primarily via Connes‚ÄìChern character map). The theory of characteristic classes of smooth manifolds has been extended to spectral triples, employing the tools of operator K-theory and cyclic cohomology. Several generalizations of now- classical index theorems allow for effective extraction of numerical invariants from spectral triples. The fundamental characteristic class in cyclic cohomology, the JLO cocycle, generalizes the classical Chern character. Examples of noncommutative spaces * In the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics, the symplectic phase space of classical mechanics is deformed into a non-commutative phase space generated by the position and momentum operators. * The noncommutative standard model is a proposed extension of the standard model of particle physics. * The noncommutative torus, deformation of the function algebra of the ordinary torus, can be given the structure of a spectral triple. This class of examples has been studied intensively and still functions as a test case for more complicated situations. * Snyder space * Noncommutative algebras arising from foliations. * Examples related to dynamical systems arising from number theory, such as the Gauss shift on continued fractions, give rise to noncommutative algebras that appear to have interesting noncommutative geometries.

According to Anna Comnena's chronicle the Alexiad Hugh sent an 'absurd' message to her father, Eastern Roman Emperor Alexius I Comnenus, demanding a proper welcome: In response to this message the emperor sent 'urgent instructions' to his nephew John Komnenos, the doux (governor) of Dyrrhachium, and Nicholas Maurokatakalon, commander of the Byzantine fleet, to look out for Hugh and to inform him immediately when he arrived.Anna Komnene, The Alexiad, E.R.A. Sewter and Peter Frankopan eds. (London 2009), 279. The routes of the crusaders, with Hugh's coloured magenta Meanwhile Hugh had reached the coast of Longobardi and dispatched twenty-four envoys to the Doux of Dyrrhachium with the following message: 'Be it known to you, Doux, that our Lord Hugh is almost here. He brings with him from Rome the golden standard of St Peter. Understand, moreover, that he is supreme commander of the Frankish army. See to it then that he is accorded a reception worthy of his rank and yourself prepare to meet him.'Anna Komnene, The Alexiad, E.R.A. Sewter and Peter Frankopan eds. (London 2009), 280. Whilst sailing the Adriatic Sea from Bari towards Illyricum, Hugh's fleet was overtaken by a heavy storm and most ships were lost. His own ship was thrown upon the shore near Epirus. When Hugh was found and brought to Dyrrhachium John Komnenos treated him to a banquet and he was allowed to rest. By order of the emperor Hugh was closely escorted by Manuel Boutoumites. Eventually Hugh was given an audience by the emperor, who persuaded him to become his liegeman.Anna Komnene, The Alexiad, E.R.A. Sewter and Peter Frankopan eds. (London 2009), 280‚Äì281.Peter Frankopan, The First Crusade. The call from the east (Cambridge, Massachusetts 2012), 124‚Äì125. The German historian Hans Eberhard Mayer argued that Alexius was fortunate that the first contingent of the crusader army to arrive in Constantinople, led by Hugh, was very small and easy to control. Alexius 'discreetly but unmistakably' restricted Hugh's freedom of movement 'until he was ready to swear that all territories which had belonged to Byzantium before the Turkish invasions would be restored. Moreover any conquests made to the east [...] would be held as fiefs.'Hans Eberhard Mayer, The Crusades, translated by John Gillingham (Oxford 1972), 48. Anna Comnena recorded a conversation between Hugh and Godfrey of Bouillon, wherein Hugh tried to persuade Godfrey to pledge allegiance to Alexius. Godfrey however refused, saying: 'you left your own country as a ruler [...] with all that wealth and a strong army; now from the heights you've brought yourself to the level of a slave. And then, as if you had won some great success, have you come here to tell me to do the same?' Hugh replied: 'we ought to have stayed in our own countries and kept our hands off other people's [...] but since we've come thus far and need the emperor's protection, no good will come of it unless we obey his orders.'Anna Komnene, The Alexiad, E.R.A. Sewter and Peter Frankopan eds. (London 2009), 288. After the Crusaders had successfully made their way across Seljuk territory and, in 1098, captured Antioch, Hugh was sent back to Constantinople to appeal for reinforcements from Alexius. The emperor was uninterested,In \\"Urban's Crusade --Success or Failure\\" (Key, 1948) it is argued, indeed to the contrary, that the emperor was disturbed by Hugh's report and the disquieting rumors emitting from Antioch (on Bohemond's intent and conduct) and promptly set out to prepare another expedition: \\"...Alexius immediately began preparations for another expedition, and he furthermore sent envoys to the crusaders to announce its coming.\\" however, and Hugh, instead of returning to Antioch to help plan the siege of Jerusalem, went back to France. There he was scorned for not having fulfilled his vow as a Crusader to complete a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and Pope Paschal II threatened to excommunicate him. He joined the minor Crusade of 1101, but was wounded in battle with the Turks led by Kilij Arslan I at the second battle of Heraclea in September, and died of his wounds in October in Tarsus.

During Hamad's rule, Qatar hosted two US military bases. It also maintained close relations with Iran. He supported and funded rebel movements, particularly in Libya and Syria during the Arab Spring, while maintaining political stability at home. The Sheikh founded news media group Al Jazeera, through which he maintained his influence over the Arab world. He also played a part in negotiations between the US and the Taliban. In June 2013, Hamad, in a brief televised address, announced that he would hand power to his fourth son, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Qatar's Emir, Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani, Transfers Power To Crown Prince Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Early years and education Hamad was born in 1952. His mother died soon after the birth and he was raised by his uncle. He graduated from the British Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst in 1971 and commissioned as a lieutenant colonel. A few months later he returned to Qatar and was made commander of a mobile brigade, which later became a force called \\"Hamad Brigade\\". In 1972 Hamad had the rank of general, and became army chief of staff. Next he was appointed commander-in-chief of Qatar's armed forces with the rank of major general. In 1977 he was named minister of defense. Hamad was appointed Heir Apparent of Qatar in 1977 and held the post until 1995. In the early 1980s, he led the Supreme Planning Council, which sets Qatar's basic economic and social policies. From 1992 Hamad had a growing responsibility for the day-to-day running of the country, including the development of Qatar's oil and natural gas resources. On 27 June 1995, after deposing his father in a palace coup, Hamad became Emir of Qatar and was crowned on 20 June 2000. Reign In the early 1980s, Hamad led the Supreme Planning Council, which sets Qatar's basic economic and social policies. Starting in 1992, Hamad's father handed over responsibility for the day-to-day running of the country, including the development of Qatar's oil and natural gas resources, rendering him the effective ruler. However, his father ultimately retained control over state finances. With the support of his family, Hamad took control of the country in 1995 while his father was on vacation abroad. While his father Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani was in Geneva, Switzerland, Hamad bin Khalifa deposed him in a bloodless coup d'√©tat. Gale Biography in Context. The deposition came after a falling out between Hamad bin Khalifa and his father, who had tried regaining some of the authority he bestowed upon Hamad in early 1995. Thereafter, his father lived in exile in France and Abu Dhabi until he returned to Qatar in 2004. Hamad then engaged an American law firm to freeze his father's bank accounts abroad in order to deter a possible countercoup. However, a counter-coup was attempted against Hamad in February 1996 under the leadership of former Economy Minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani. The coup failed, and several of Qatar's traditional Arab allies were implicated in the plot, namely Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt.

His activism has enhanced the country's involvement and performance in a number of international competitions, including: winning an Olympic medal in track and field; hosting a wide variety of international sporting events such as the 15th Asian Games, GCC, Asian and World Youth soccer championships; and initiating the Qatar Open Tennis Championship which has grown to become one of two premier tennis competitions in the Middle East. Under his rule the Qatari government helped to fund the Al Jazeera news network by an emiri decree. In an analysis of Al Jazeera, Hugh Miles said that diplomats from other countries know that the Emir is the real power behind Al Jazeera but he also quotes a network spokesman denying 'countless times' this accusation, adding that many independent news sources also have subsidies from their respective governments without this implying editorial dabbling and explaining that trying to coerce the kind of journalists Al Jazeera has would be like trying to 'herd cats'. Sheik Hamad is a distant cousin of the network chairman, Hamad bin Thamer Al Thani, who was previously Minister of Information in the Emir Al-Thani government. Following the initial US$137 million grant from Emir Al-Thani, Al Jazeera had aimed to become self-sufficient through advertising by 2001, but when this failed to occur, the Emir agreed to several consecutive loans on a year-by-year basis (US$30 million in 2004, according to Arnaud de Borchgrave). At a 3 October 2001 press conference, Colin Powell tried to persuade Sheik Hamad to shut down Al Jazeera while the New York-based organization Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting commented that in those efforts, \\"Powell and other U.S. officials were reportedly upset by the channel re-airing old interviews with bin Laden and the inclusion of guests that are too critical of the United States on its programs.\\"Colin Powell, news conference with Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Thani, 3 October 2001, Washington D.C. The Washington Post reported in 2005 that Sheik Hamad was under pressure to privatize the network. In 2010, the country won its controversial bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Doha.\\"Qatar win 2022 World Cup bid\\", The Guardian, 2 December 2010. Abdication and later life On 25 June 2013 Hamad handed over power to his son Tamim in a televised speech. In regards to the shift in power, Hamad said: \\"The time has come to open a new page in the journey of our nation that would have a new generation carry the responsibilities.\\" Since his abdication, he is now popularly referred to as the Father Emir. His fourth son Sheikh Tamim, from his second wife Sheikha Moza, is now the eighth and current Emir of Qatar. Hamad is believed to have suffered from poor health for several years. In December 2015 he was flown to Z√ºrich, Switzerland, for treatment after breaking his leg while on holiday in Morocco's Atlas mountains.

Qatar expert Olivier Da Lage said: \\"When he came to power in 1995, Sheikh Hamad had a goal to place Qatar on the world map by exploiting the gas resources which his father did not develop for fear it would change the emirate's society.

He was a key person in the cease fire during the 2006 Lebanon War and contributed majorly in the relief of damaged areas. In 2012, the Emir proposed deploying Arab troops to reduce killings in the Syrian civil war. He provided two military bases for foreign troops, Al Udeid Air Base and Camp As Sayliyah. Despite the prevalence of anti-Israel sentiment within the Arab world, he had previously maintained friendly relations with Israel. He met Foreign Minister of Israel Tzipi Livni (25 September 2007) in New York City. This marked the first real attempt by any leader in the Persian Gulf to pursue dialogue with Israel.

He took a flight to Egypt before being driven into Gaza. While there, the emir was thought to be launching a $254 million reconstruction project in the territory, and giving an address to the Palestinian people.

This follows a series of endeavors by the Emir and other Qataris into the World Football community, following Qatar's successful bid for the 2022 World Cup, and the Qatar Foundation's recent ¬£125m shirt deal with FC Barcelona. In mid-June 2011, rumours resurfaced that Qatari Holdings were preparing a ¬£2 Billion takeover bid and that the funding, that the club had been using for transfers since the start of June, was actually supplied by the Qataris and not the Glazer Family. In 2012 it was rumoured that Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani was in bid for Rangers F.C.. On 30 March 2012 Sheik Al Thani offered to buy KF Tirana, although the details have yet to be published.

An English fleet led by William Longesp√©e, Earl of Salisbury accidentally encountered a large French fleet under the command of Savari de Maul√©on in the vicinity of the port of Damme, in Flanders. The French crews were mostly ashore, pillaging the countryside, and the English captured 300 French ships at anchor, and looted and fired a further hundred beached ships. The main French army, commanded by King Philip II of France, was nearby besieging Ghent and it promptly marched on Damme. It arrived in time to relieve the town's French garrison and drive off the English landing parties. Philip had the remainder of the French fleet burned to avoid capture. The success of the English raid yielded immense booty and ended the immediate threat of a French invasion of England. It is often considered the first great naval victory in English history. Background When King John of England () came to the throne he attempted to expand his territory, launching a campaign in Normandy in 1200. He was defeated by King Philip II of France () and had lost most of his overseas possessions by 1204. Subsequently, John repeatedly attempted to form alliances against Philip, with a view to recovering Normandy. In 1208 John's nephew, Otto, became Holy Roman Emperor. Prior to his accession Otto had promised to help John recover his lost possessions. By 1212 both John and Otto were engaged in power struggles against Pope Innocent III. In John's case his refusal to accept Innocent's candidate for Archbishop of Canterbury had led to Innocent placing an interdict on England, prohibiting clergy from conducting religious services (with limited exceptions), in 1208 and excommunicating John personally in 1209. Philip decided to take advantage of this situation, first in Germany, where he aided a German noble rebellion. John immediately threw England's weight behind Otto, and Philip saw an opportunity to launch an invasion of England. To secure the co-operation of all of his vassals in his plans for the invasion, Philip denounced John as an enemy of the Church, thereby justifying his attack as motivated by religious scruples. He summoned an assembly of French barons at Soissons, which was well attended with the exception of Ferdinand, Count of Flanders, who refused to attend. Philip was encouraged in all of this by the papal legate, Pandulf Verraccio. Verraccio, however, was also holding secret discussions with John, who agreed to accept the legate's decision in ecclesiastical disputes. In return, the Pope offered John the kingdom of England and the lordship of Ireland as papal fiefs, which John would rule as the Pope's vassal, and for which John would do homage to the Pope. Once the treaty confirming this had been ratified in May 1213 Verraccio announced to Philip that he would have to abandon his expedition against John, since to attack a faithful vassal of the Holy See would constitute a mortal sin. He suggested that as Ferdinand had denied Philip's right to declare war on England while John was still excommunicated, his disobedience needed to be punished. Philip accepted the advice, and marched with his army into the territory of Flanders. It is possible that Philip saw this as a preliminary to an invasion of England. John declared support for Ferdinand, starting the Anglo-French War of 1213‚Äì1214. Prelude At the time, galleys were used as purpose-built warships. They had long been used by the Mediterranean powers and had been adapted by the northern countries for use in the English Channel. Galleys could penetrate shallow harbours and were highly manoeuvrable, making them effective for raiding and ship-to-ship combat in meeting engagements. Operating the galleys was a specialist activity and called for highly trained crews. Both the English and the French relied on requisitioning cogs, the merchant vessels of the time, to supplement their navies. Cogs had a deep draught, a round hull and were propelled by a single large sail set on a mast amidships. Cogs were used as transports and could be converted into warships by the addition of wooden castlesraised fighting platformsat the bow and stern and the erection of crow's nest fighting platforms at the masthead. Cogs typically had a displacement of . Their high freeboard made them superior to the oared vessels in close combat, particularly when they were fitted with the castles, from which missiles could be fired or stones dropped on to enemy craft alongside. Contemporary chronicler William the Breton, the royal chaplain, who was in the French camp at the time, reported the French fleet as numbering some 1,700 ships. This number is considered improbably high by modern historians, who simply describe both fleets as \\"large\\". F. W. Brooks describes the figure of 1,700 ships for the French as \\"hopelessly exaggerated\\" and suggests that the actual size was less than 500, but of unknown breakdown between fighting ships and transports. Better figures are available for the English. In 1206 fifty galleys were recorded in royal service, operating in four squadrons. In 1211 there is a record of a fleet of over fifty ships, including twenty galleys. Building and maintaining fleets of this size was extremely expensive. In 1212 the fleet was costing over ¬£3,500 per year; perhaps a quarter of the total royal revenue. For the 1213 campaign John attempted to requisition every English merchant ship capable of carrying six or more horses. 19th century historian Smedley estimates the English fleet at 500 ships; 20th century historian Brooks that it was \\"much inferior in point of numbers to the French fleet\\". Battle The French fleet, originally assembled to carry troops to invade England, instead operated in a supporting role. It assembled at Boulogne, where Savari de Maul√©on, a French minor noble who had served John for the previous eight years, was appointed its commander. Heavily laden with supplies, largely wine and bacon, the army's pay chests, and the personal goods of the French barons, it proceeded to Gravelines and then to the port of Damme, \\"among the most important commercial ports of Europe\\". Damme is located on the estuary of the Zwyn, now largely silted up. At the time it was in the County of Flanders (now in Belgium) and was the port of the city of Bruges. Meanwhile, the army marched via Cassel, Ypres, and Bruges before laying siege to Ghent. In England John had assembled his own fleet, which he sent to Flanders, under the command of William Longesp√©e, Earl of Salisbury, to support his ally, Ferdinand, Count of Flanders, on 28 May 1213. An 1873 illustration of the English attack The English ships were carrying 700 English and Flemish men-at-arms and their attendants, and a large force of mercenaries. They entered the estuary of the Zwyn on 30 May, where they unexpectedly found the French armada. Most of the ships were pulled up on the beach. The French army was besieging Ghent, and many of the crews were pillaging the surrounding area. The English were surprised to discover the French fleet, at first believing them to be their Flemish allies. After scouting the roadstead to confirm the nationality and size of the fleet and discovering that the French ships were almost unmanned they attacked. They seized the 300 ships which were anchored and killed their crews. A further 100 ships were looted and then burnt on the beach after their crews had fled. The next day they attacked the rest of the ships and attempted an assault on Damme, which was repulsed. English and French chroniclers of the time all agree that the French lost approximately 400 ships. The Flemish forces which had accompanied the English now disembarked and reconnoitered Damme. Finding it strongly garrisoned they bypassed it and advanced on Bruges. When Philip heard the news of the disaster behind him he broke off the siege of Ghent and marched for Damme. Part of his army encountered the Flemish army near Bruges and drove them off. His army reached Damme on 2 June, in time to relieve the French garrison. There, Philip found that groups of English ships were looting and capturing or firing his remaining ships almost at will. He was furious at the performance of the fleet. He suspected the loyalty of the crews, who were almost all from Poitiers or Normandy, until recently English possessions; and the loyalty of their commander, who until recently had led troops for the English. He had the surviving ships burned to prevent them from falling into English hands, and ordered the town of Damme to be burned as well. Determined to make the Flemish pay for his retreat, Phillip ordered that all towns be razed in every district he passed through, and that the peasantry be either killed or taken prisoner and sold as slaves. He extracted 30,000 marks from the Flemish cities he had captured as a ransom for the release of the hostages he had taken. Aftermath The English fleet returned to England with the seized ships and a large booty; a contemporary writer claimed \\"never had so much treasure come into England since the days of King Arthur\\". The success at Damme dashed any French hopes of invading England that year and severely strained their resources, but did little to affect their army or its operations. Nevertheless, John began preparing for an invasion of France and a reconquest of his lost provinces. The English barons were initially unenthusiastic about the expedition, which delayed his departure, so it was not until February 1214 that he landed in France. John was to advance from the Loire, while his ally Otto made a simultaneous attack from Flanders, together with Ferdinand. John retook the county of Anjou, but was forced back after losing the Siege of Roche-au-Moine to Philip's son, Louis, on 2 July. Shortly after, Philip decisively defeated Otto and Ferdinand's army, which had assembled in the Low Countries, at the Battle of Bouvines. This ended John's hopes of regaining his continental lands. De Maul√©on returned to English service and in 1216 was appointed by John to the council of regency which governed England in the name of the new nine-year-old king, Henry III.

Jacquetta Hawkes & J B Priestley by Howard Coster, 1953, National Portrait Gallery Born Jessie Jacquetta Hopkins, she is perhaps best known for her book A Land (1951). She was a prolific writer of works about subjects that were quite removed from her principal field. She was above all interested in discovering the lives of the peoples that were revealed by scientific excavations. With Christopher Hawkes, she co-authored Prehistoric Britain (1943) and with J. B. Priestley she wrote Dragon's Mouth (1952) and Journey Down a Rainbow (1955). Her other works include The World of the Past (1963), Prehistory (History of Mankind: Cultural and Scientific Development, Volume 1 Part 1) (1963) prepared under the auspices of UNESCO, The Atlas of Early Man (1976) and The Shell Guide to British Archaeology (1986).  Early life and education  Hawkes was born on 5 August 1910 in Cambridge, the youngest child of Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins (1861‚Äì1947), biochemist and Nobel Prize winner, and his wife Jessie Ann (1869‚Äì1956), daughter of Edward William Stevens, ship's fitter, of Ramsgate. From 1921 to 1928 she attended Perse School, going on in 1929 to study the new degree of archaeology and anthropology at Newnham College, Cambridge, the first woman to do so. In her second year at university she took part in the excavation of a Roman site near Colchester, and there met Charles Hawkes (1905‚Äì1992), a young archaeologist. She graduated with first class honours. She married Hawkes on 7 October 1933 at Trinity College, Cambridge. Archaeologist In 1934 she published her first academic article \\"Aspects of the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods in western Europe\\" in the journal Antiquity. In 1939 she was involved with moving items from the British museum to the Aldwych tube station. In 1949 she produced the 'People of Britain: Origins of People' display at the Festival of Britain. In her general work on the Minoans (Dawn of the Gods, 1968), Hawkes was also one of the first archaeologists to suggest that the ancient Minoans might have been ruled by women; the idea had been discussed long before by historians of culture and religion (for instance, Joseph Campbell), and it had also been discussed outside the academic community, sometimes by feminists. Hawkes noted that very little if any evidence of a Minoan male ruler exists, whereas abundant evidence of such rulers existed among the Egyptians, Hittites, Assyrians and other Minoan contemporaries. Furthermore, images of strong and powerful women abound in Minoan art, where both men and women are shown provocatively and elegantly dressed and in some pictures they seem to move on equal terms; whereas in Egyptian, Assyrian and classical Greek art, human women (as distinct from goddesses) are never shown as the equals of males. Hawkes stated that \\"the absence of these manifestations of the all- powerful male ruler that are so widespread at this time and in this stage of cultural development as to be almost universal, is one of the reasons for supposing that the occupants of Minoan thrones may have been queens\\". She noted the evident love of nature, both wild and cultivated, in Minoan art and architecture. She also noted the lack of a striving for monumentality in Minoan palaces, and the absence of war and motives dramatizing a sense of destiny, guilt and brooding. She contrasts Minoan art and architecture to the heavy, foreboding and warlike architecture of Mycenae and the strong presence of themes of fate, martial heroism and moral guilt in later Greek mythology, some of the stories of which must, in an early form, already have existed at Mycenae (as well as similar motives in Babylonian literature, e.g., in the Gilgamesh epic). Although we do not know anything of the specific content of Minoan myth and folklore, themes of the kind mentioned‚Äîwar, destiny, guilt, curses‚Äîdo not even seem to be alluded to in the art of the period, as also noted by Hawkes. This perspective on the differences between Crete and Mycenaean Greece has remained controversial but has also spurred discussion about Minoan Crete, its religion, the nature of its monarchy and the wider set of relations between Minoan, Mycenaean and later Greek cultures. = Archaeological excavations and papers = * 1935, 'The Place Origin of Windmill Hill Culture' * 1938, 'The Significance of Channelled Ware in Neolithic Western Europe' * 1941 'Excavation of a Megalithic Tomb at Harristown, Waterford * 1951, 'A Quarter Century of Antiquity' * 1956 The Longstone, Mottistone, Isle of Wight, England * 1968 'The Proper Study of Mankind' =Awards and recognition= In 1971, Hawkes was elected Vice- President of the Council for British Archeology in recognition of her life's work. Creative communicator Hawkes was interested in communicating archaeology and art in new ways, including through writing creatively and through film. Writing with imagination and empathy in what became termed the 'archaeological imagination', was central to her practice. =Film= Hawkes wrote and featured in several documentary works. She wrote a script for a film Figures in a Landscape (1953), a documentary about the work of Barbara Hepworth. ='A Land'= 'A Land' is the work that Hawkes is most popularly known for. It is \\"an unconventional geological history\\" which was a post-war bestseller in the UK. Reviewed at the time as \\"literary expression ... rather than scientific description\\". =Poetry= For Hawkes, archaeology and the creative imagination were inextricably linked. In addition to her archaeological reports and articles, she also wrote emotionally about landscape and published a volume of poetry. 'Symbols and Speculations' was published in 1949 and recalls through poetry both mystical and physical experiences in her archaeological career. =Archive= Hawkes' papers are kept at the University of Bradford along with husband J B Priestley's. It includes: * diaries * letters * photographs * notebooks and drafts * poems, plays and articles * school reports * nature diaries This material shows how she developed as a thinker, from archaeology through journalism and poetry, as well as her work as an activist and details on her personal life. =Legacy= Hawkes' works have inspired many people. These are a few of the responses to her legacy: * 'Pots Before Words' - an exhibition of work by artist Kate Morrell at the University of Bradford exploring Hawkes' archive. Work from this was listed for the Jerwood Drawing Prize * 'The Sun Went in, the Fire Went Out' - an exhibition at Chelsea College of Art in 2016 by artists Annabel Nicolson, Carlyle Reedy and Marie Yates * 'Christine Finn: Back to a Land' - an exhibition at Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 2016 by biographer Christine Finn * Hawkes featured in the 'Isle of Wight: Hidden Heroes' exhibition at Carisbrooke Castle in 2018 Personal life Hawkes was the daughter of Nobel Prize-winning scientist Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins. She met Christopher Hawkes, her senior, on a dig during her studies at Cambridge, and married him when she was 22. Their only son, Nicholas, was born in 1937. A wartime affair with the poet Walter Turner was followed by a post-war romance with J. B. Priestley, whom she married in 1953 after both had divorced. Hawkes and Priestley remained physically, emotionally and intellectually close until their deaths.Judith Cook, Priestley, London: Bloomsbury, 1997, pp. 213‚Äì298. In 1958 she was involved with the founding of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Hawkes was President of the Warwickshire branch of the Campaign for the Preservation of Rural England and was a trustee of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. Hawkes was the subject of several photographers, including Lord Snowdon.

It was established in 1910, and existed as an independent technical university for 58 years, after which it was merged into the University of Trondheim as an independent college.About the establishment of the University of Trondheim (Norwegian) In 1996 NTH ceased to exist as an organizational superstructure when the university was restructured and rebranded. The former NTH departments are now basic building blocks of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). NTH was primarily a polytechnic institute, educating master level engineers as well as architects. In 1992 NTH had 7627 master and doctoral students and 1591 employees; it graduated 1262 chartered engineers (master level), 52 chartered architects, and 92 Dr.Ing. (PhD). The operating budget was equivalent to US$100M, and the total premises amounted to around 260,000 m2 (64 acres). Since the merger, it forms a part of the university campus commonly known as Gl√∏shaugen, from the geographical area in which it is situated. History Seal of the Institute The decision to establish a Norwegian national college of technology was made by the Norwegian parliament, the Storting, in 1900, after years of heated debate on where the institution should be located; many representatives felt that the capital Kristiania (now Oslo) was self-evident as the place for this nationally important seat of learning. However, eventually Den Tekniske H√∏gskole was located in the geographically central city of Trondheim, based on an emerging policy of decentralisation as well as the city's existing and highly esteemed technical college, Trondhjems Tekniske L√¶reanstalt. Hovedbygningen, the building of Norges tekniske h√∏gskole was designed by architect Bredo Greve. It was built of granite block construction in the National Romantic style of architecture. Five academical departments were originally present in the parliament's resolution of 31 May 1900: * Architecture and city planning * Civil engineering * Mechanical engineering (a. General and b.

Along with scheelite, the wolframite series are the most important tungsten ore minerals. Wolframite is found in quartz veins and pegmatites associated with granitic intrusives. Associated minerals include cassiterite, scheelite, bismuth, quartz, pyrite, galena, sphalerite, and arsenopyrite. This mineral was historically found in Europe in Bohemia, Saxony, and Cornwall. China reportedly has the world's largest supply of tungsten ore with about 60%. Other producers are Canada, Portugal, Russia, Australia, Thailand, South Korea, Rwanda, Bolivia, the United States, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Name The name \\"wolframite\\" is derived from German \\"wolf rahm\\", the name given to tungsten by Johan Gottschalk Wallerius in 1747. This, in turn, derives from \\"Lupi spuma\\", the name Georg Agricola used for the element in 1546, which translates into English as \\"wolf's froth\\" or \\"cream\\". The etymology is not entirely certain but seems to be a reference to the large amounts of tin consumed by the mineral during its extraction, the phenomenon literally being likened to a wolf eating a sheep. Wolfram is the basis for the chemical symbol W for tungsten as a chemical element. Use Extraction of tungsten from wolframite ore Wolframite is highly valued as the main source of the metal tungsten, a strong and quite dense material with a high melting temperature used for electric filaments and armor-piercing ammunition, as well as hard tungsten carbide machine tools. During World War II, wolframite mines were a strategic asset, due to its use in munitions and tools. Wolframite was considered to be a conflict mineral due to the unethical mining practices observed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, during the Congo Wars.

Others in the cast include Alastair Sim, Sybil Thorndike, Kay Walsh, Hitchcock's daughter Pat Hitchcock in her movie debut, and Joyce Grenfell in a humorous vignette. The story was adapted for the screen by Whitfield Cook, Ranald MacDougall and Alma Reville (the director's wife), with additional dialogue by James Bridie, based on the novel Man Running by Selwyn Jepson. Plot Eve Gill (Jane Wyman) is an aspiring actress at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. She is interrupted in rehearsal by her friend (and crush), actor Jonathan Cooper (Richard Todd), the secret lover of flamboyant stage actress/singer Charlotte Inwood (Marlene Dietrich). Via a flashback, he says Charlotte visited him after killing her husband; she was wearing a bloodstained dress. Jonathan claims he went back to her house for another dress but was seen by Nellie Goode (Kay Walsh), Charlotte's cockney maid/dresser. He escaped the police and needs help. Eve takes him to her father's house on the coast to hide. Commodore Gill (Alastair Sim, whose name is twice misspelled in the credits), notices that the blood on Charlotte's dress has been smeared on deliberately; he and Eve think that Charlotte framed Jonathan. Jonathan angrily destroys the dress and, thus, the most useful piece of evidence. Eve starts to investigate. She hears Charlotte's dresser Nellie Goode boasting about her newfound notoriety in a bar. While she is there, Eve meets Detective Inspector Wilfred O. Smith (Michael Wilding), and they become friendly. Eve then poses as a reporter; she bribes Nellie to tell Charlotte she is ill and introduce her cousin \\"Doris Tinsdale\\" as a replacement. Using her acting skills, Eve becomes \\"Doris\\" and starts working for Charlotte. Eve discovers Charlotte is having an affair with her manager Freddie Williams (Hector MacGregor). Eve and \\"Ordinary\\" Smith become more friendly. When Smith visits Charlotte, Eve has to disguise the fact that she is also \\"Doris,\\" the maid. Smith makes a courtship visit to Eve and her mother at home, where Commodore drops subtle hints that Jonathan has left the seaside house. Despite her widowed status, Charlotte continues to perform her West End musical show. Jonathan comes to her dressing room, asking her to accompany him abroad. She casually tells him, no, but he says he still has the bloodstained dress. The police search for Jonathan and Eve again helps him escape. He hides at the Gill's London residence. He is grateful to Eve, but she is starting to fall in love with Detective Smith. Smith and Eve kiss in a taxi on the way to the RADA garden party, where Nellie Goode confronts Eve, demanding more blackmail money. Eve does not have enough, so Eve's father comes to give Nellie more cash. Freddie Williams spots Eve (thinking she is \\"Doris\\") and orders her to help Charlotte, who is to sing on stage in a tent. During the performance, Commodore Gill gets a small boy to carry a doll wearing a bloodstained dress onto the stage as Charlotte sings \\"La Vie en Rose.\\" Charlotte collapses, and \\"Doris\\" has to help. Seeing this, Smith confronts Eve and Commodore, but Eve proclaims her true affection for Smith as well as Jonathan's innocence. They persuade Smith to set Charlotte up. Once the theatre has closed, they use a hidden microphone, and \\"Doris\\" tells Charlotte she has the bloodstained dress. Smith and his men listen using the theatre loudspeakers. Charlotte admits planning her husband's death but says that Jonathan actually committed the murder. Charlotte offers Eve 10,000 pounds to keep quiet. Eve sees that Jonathan has been brought to the theatre by the police, but he escapes. Charlotte realizes her conversation with Eve was broadcast to the detectives and that she will be charged as an accessory to murder. Detective Smith tells the commodore that Jonathan really did kill Mr. Inwood and that Jonathan killed before, though he got off on a plea of self-defense. Hiding below the stage, Jonathan confesses to Eve that Charlotte goaded him into killing her husband. His flashback story was all lies, and he was the one who smeared more blood onto the dress. He alludes to killing Eve to justify a plea for insanity in court. Eve pretends to help Jonathan escape but locks him onto the stage and alerts the police about his presence. As Jonathan is pursued from all directions and cornered, he is killed by the stage's falling safety curtain. Cast * Jane Wyman as Eve Gill * Marlene Dietrich as Charlotte Inwood * Michael Wilding as Wilfred \\"Ordinary\\" Smith * Richard Todd as Jonathan Cooper * Alastair Sim as Commodore Gill * Sybil Thorndike as Mrs. Gill * Kay Walsh as Nellie Goode * Miles Malleson as Mr. Fortesque * Hector MacGregor as Freddie Williams * Joyce Grenfell as 'Lovely Ducks' * Andr√© Morell as Inspector Byard * Patricia Hitchcock as Chubby Bannister * Ballard Berkeley as Sergeant Mellish * Gordon Bell as Chauffeur Production Though Hitchcock had lived and worked in Hollywood since 1939, this mystery/thriller, which is mixed with humour, was made in London locations. The only members of the cast who are not British are the two top-billed stars: Wyman and Dietrich. Featured is an original Cole Porter song, \\"The Laziest Gal in Town\\", performed by Dietrich in a sultry fashion. Dietrich also begins a performance of Edith Piaf's \\"La Vie En Rose\\", but is unable to finish it after being startled by a Boy Scout bringing a blood-stained doll to her. Dietrich's costumes were designed by Christian Dior. Dietrich was allowed an unprecedented control of her shots by Hitchcock during the filming. When asked during the filming about working with the famously controlling, and technically adept Dietrich, Hitchcock replied \\"Everything is fine. Miss Dietrich has arranged the whole thing. She has told them exactly where to place the lights and how to photograph her.\\" Later, he said of Dietrich \\"Marlene was a professional star. She was also a professional cameraman, art director, editor, costume designer, hairdresser, makeup woman, composer, producer and director.\\" Stage Fright garnered some adverse publicity upon its initial release due to the \\"lying flashback\\" seen near the beginning of the film. However, some film critics, including those of Cahiers du cin√©ma, see the flashback as simply being an illustration of one person's version of the events: the events as recounted by the character whose voice-over we hear, which was presumably Hitchcock's intention. The film has a few extra-long takes, reminiscent of those that Hitchcock used in Rope (1948) and Under Capricorn (1949), both films produced by Hitchcock for Transatlantic Pictures in partnership with Sidney Bernstein and released by Warner Brothers. Stage Fright was originally intended to be a Transatlantic release, but became a Warners release instead. The biography of Dietrich by her daughter said that Dietrich did not particularly like Jane Wyman, perhaps because they were such opposites. Howard Maxford, author of The A-Z of Hitchcock: [The Ultimate Reference Guide], notes that some aspects of the Edith Thompson and Frederick Bywaters case have similarities to the plot of Stage Fright. Differences between the film and the novel Although Stage Fright is based on Selwyn Jepson's short story \\"Man Running\\" (also known as \\"Outrun the Constable\\"), it differs in some ways. In the original story, Freddie Williams is the actual murderer. Hitchcock's cameo Alfred Hitchcock's cameo is a signature occurrence in most of his films. In Stage Fright, he can be seen 39 minutes into the film as a man on the street turning to look at Eve as she rehearses her scripted introduction speech to Mrs. Inwood. In the 4 June 1950 edition of the New York Times, Hitchcock stated: :\\"In Stage Fright, I have been told that my performance is quite juicy. I have been told this with a certain air of tolerance, implying that I have now achieved the maximum limits of directorial ham in the movie sandwich. It isn't true. There may have been a 'MacGuffin' in my film appearance, but not a ham.\\" Reception =Critical= Contemporary reviews were mixed. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote that Hitchcock \\"and his writers have contrived to give a fine cast of actors some slick and entertaining things to do. But we must quietly advise you that these things, while amusing separately, build up very little sustained excitement or suspense. They are simply a wild accumulation of clever or colorful episodes, tending for the most part to the comic, without any real anxiety.\\" John McCarten of The New Yorker agreed, writing that \\"the picture doesn't lack for comic touches, but none of its episodes ties in very closely with the succeeding one, and the result is disappointing.\\" Variety printed a more positive review, reporting that Hitchcock \\"has a choice cast to put through its paces, and there's not a bad performance anywhere. The dialog has purpose, either for a chuckle or a thrill, and the pace is good despite the 110 minutes of footage.\\" Harrison's Reports called it \\"a rambling murder thriller that wavers constantly between comedy that is delightfully funny and melodrama that is rarely more than moderately exciting. The overall result is a spotty entertainment that is too dragged out to keep one's interest constantly alive.\\" Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post wrote that there were \\"so many beguiling people and moments\\" in the film \\"that it's curious the picture as a whole isn't better.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote: \\"Stage Fright is not without effective moments, reminding us how Hitchcock once excelled in the simple melodrama with ordinary, naturalistic backgrounds; but too much of it has the heavy, corpulent quality that made Rope and in particular Under Capricorn so lifeless and unreal.\\" =Box Office= Trade papers called the film a \\"notable box office attraction\\" in British cinemas in 1950.Robert Murphy, Realism and Tinsel: Cinema and Society in Britain 1939-48 2003 p213 According to Kinematograph Weekly the 'biggest winners' at the box office in 1950 Britain were The Blue Lamp, The Happiest Days of Your Life, Annie Get Your Gun, The Wooden Horse, Treasure Island and Odette, with \\"runners up\\" being Stage Fright, White Heat, They Were Not Divided, Trio, Morning Departure, Destination Moon, Sands of Iwo Jima, Little Women, The Forsythe Saga, Father of the Bride, Neptune's Daughter, The Dancing Years, The Red Light, Rogues of Sherwood Forest, Fancy Pants, Copper Canyon, State Secret, The Cure for Love, My Foolish Heart, Stromboli, Cheaper by the Dozen, Pinky, Three Came Home, Broken Arrow and Black Rose.

Contract law, for example, can be divided into two kinds of rules: default rules and mandatory rules. Whereas the default rules can be modified by agreement of the parties, mandatory rules will be enforced, even if the parties to a contract attempt to override or modify them. One of the most important debates in contract theory concerns the proper role or purpose of default rules. The idea of a default rule in contract law is sometimes connected to the notion of a complete contract. In contract theory, a complete contract fully specifies the rights and duties of the parties to the contract for all possible future states of the world. An incomplete contract, therefore, contains gaps. Most contract theorists find that default rules fill in the gaps in what would otherwise be incomplete contracts. This is often stated pragmatically as whether a court will imply terms so as to save a contract from uncertainty.

He appears to have come from the East Midlands, possibly being born in Tattershall, Lincolnshire, but there is no indication of his parentage. According to one of his own letters, he was related to the Yerburghs, a well-to-do Lincolnshire family. The earliest information is that in 1524 Taverner travelled from Tattershall to the Church of St Botolph in nearby Boston as a guest singer.These initial details are from Benham 2003, 5. Two years later, in 1526, Taverner became the first Organist and Master of the Choristers at Christ Church, Oxford, appointed by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. The college had been founded in 1525 by Cardinal Wolsey, and was then known as Cardinal College. Immediately before this, Taverner had been a clerk fellow at the Collegiate Church of Tattershall. In 1528 he was reprimanded for his (probably minor) involvement with Lutherans, but escaped punishment for being \\"but a musitian\\". Wolsey fell from favour in 1529, and in 1530 Taverner left the college. He married a widow, one Rose Parrowe, probably in 1536, and she outlived him until 1553. During the last five months of the composer's life, he was an alderman in the town council of Boston. For about three years, previously, he was the treasurer of the Corpus Christi Gild, there in Boston. As far as can be told, Taverner had no further musical appointments, nor can any of his known works be dated to after that time, so he may have ceased composition. It is often said that after leaving Oxford, Taverner worked as an agent of Thomas Cromwell assisting in the Dissolution of the Monasteries, although the veracity of this is now thought to be highly questionable. He is known to have settled eventually in Boston, Lincolnshire, where he was a small landowner and reasonably well-off. He is buried with his wife under the belltower at Boston Parish Church. (In the few existing copies of his signature, the composer actually spelled his last name \\"Tavernor.\\") The 20th- century composer, Sir John Tavener claimed (even in his early teens), to be his direct descendant.  Works  Grave in St Botolph's, Boston Most of Taverner's music is vocal, and includes masses, Magnificats and motets. The bulk of his output is thought to date from the 1520s. His best-known motet is Dum Transisset Sabbatum. One of his best-known masses is based on a popular song called The Western Wynde (John Sheppard and Christopher Tye later also wrote masses based on this same song). Taverner's Western Wynde mass is unusual for the period because the theme tune appears in each of the four parts, excepting the alto, at different times. Perhaps his most celebrated work is his Missa Gloria tibi Trinitas, which Taverner probably composed during his years at Christ Church, Oxford. Commonly his masses are designed so that each of the four sections (Gloria, Credo, Sanctus-Benedictus and Agnus Dei) are about the same length, often achieved by putting the same number of repetitions of the thematic material in each. For example, in the Western Wynde mass, the theme is repeated nine times in each section. As the sections have texts of very different lengths, he uses extended melismata in the movements with fewer words. Several of his other masses use the widespread cantus firmus technique, where a plainchant melody with long note values is placed in an interior part, often the tenor. Examples of cantus firmus masses include Corona Spinea and Gloria Tibi Trinitas. Another technique of composition is seen in his mass Mater Christi, which is based upon material taken from his motet of that name, and hence known as a \\"derived\\" or \\"parody\\" mass. The Missa Gloria tibi TrinitasThe used cantus firmus is 'Gloria tibi Trinitas', an antiphon for the Vespers of Trinity Sunday. gave origin to the style of instrumental work known as an In nomine. Although this mass is in six parts, some more virtuosic sections are in reduced numbers of parts, presumably intended for soloists, a compositional technique used in several of his masses. The section at the words \\"in nomine ...\\" in the Benedictus is in four parts, with the plainchant in the alto. This section of the mass became popular as an instrumental work for viol consort. Other composers came to write instrumental works modelled on this, and the name In nomine was given to works of this type. The life of Taverner was the subject of Taverner, an opera by Peter Maxwell Davies.

Between 1964 and 1966, they charted with several hits documenting teen tragedies and melodramas. They remain known for their hits \\"Remember (Walking in the Sand)\\", \\"Give Him a Great Big Kiss\\", and in particular, \\"Leader of the Pack\\", which went to #1 in the US in late 1964. Early career The group was formed at Andrew Jackson High School in Cambria Heights, a neighborhood in Queens, New York City, in 1963. They were two sets of sisters: Mary Weiss (lead singer) (born December 28, 1948) and Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Weiss (born November 27, 1946), and identical twins Marguerite \\"Marge\\"/\\"Margie\\" Ganser (February 4, 1948 - July 28, 1996) and Mary Ann Ganser (February 4, 1948 - March 14, 1970). They began playing school shows, talent shows, and teen hops, coming to the attention of Artie Ripp, who arranged the group's first record deal with Kama Sutra. Their first recording in December 1963 was \\"Simon Says\\", later issued on the Smash label, on which Betty Weiss sang lead. They also recorded \\"Wishing Well\\" / \\"Hate to Say I Told You So\\", which became their first release in early 1964 when leased to the small Spokane label. Initially, the girls performed without a name; however, when they signed their first deal, they began calling themselves the Shangri-Las, after a Queens, New York restaurant. Some discographies list The Beatle-ettes and The Bon Bons, who both issued singles in 1964, as early versions of the Shangri-Las; however, they are different groups. Mary Weiss was the main lead singer; Betty, however, took lead on \\"Maybe\\" (the LP version), \\"Shout\\", \\"Twist and Shout\\", \\"Wishing Well\\", and a number of B-sides and album tracks. Mary Ann Ganser took lead on most of \\"I'm Blue\\", which is a cover of the Ikettes' biggest hit at the time, and was included on their 1965 album Shangri-Las 65!. Success at Red Bird Records In April 1964, when the girls were still minors, their parents signed with Red Bird Records; Mary was 15, Betty was 17, and the Ganser twins were 16. Having been hired by record producer George \\"Shadow\\" Morton, they had their first success with the summer hit \\"Remember (Walking in the Sand)\\" (U.S. #5, UK #14). Billy Joel, a then-unknown working as a session musician, played on the demo of \\"Remember (Walkin' in the Sand)\\". The demo was nearly seven minutes long, too long for Top 40 radio. Morton had hired the group to perform on the demo, but Red Bird released a re-recorded version. Morton faded the new version out around 2:16. The recordings for Morton featured lavish production with heavy orchestration and sound effects, and their next and biggest hit, \\"Leader of the Pack\\" (U.S. #1, UK #11), climaxes with roaring motorcycles and breaking glass. UK re-issues peaked at #3 in 1972 and #7 in 1976. The song epitomized the \\"death disc\\"; other examples include Ray Peterson's \\"Tell Laura I Love Her\\", Jan and Dean's \\"Dead Man's Curve\\", J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers's \\"Last Kiss,\\" Mark Dinning's \\"Teen Angel\\", Dickey Lee's \\"Laurie (Strange Things Happen\\"), Twinkle's \\"Terry\\" and Jody Reynolds' \\"Endless Sleep\\". The group as a trio in 1964. After the sudden success of \\"Remember (Walking in the Sand)\\", all the girls were called upon to make personal appearances, which required them to leave high school. Mary, however, stayed on for classes at a high school for young professionals in Manhattan. By the end of 1964, the group was an established act. They performed with the Beatles, a Fall 1964 tour with the Rolling Stones, R&B; artists such as The Drifters and James Brown (who, according to Mary Weiss, was surprised to discover the girls were white), and Cashbox magazine listed them as best new R&B; group. The group was also a fixture on the Murray the K shows at the Brooklyn Fox from 1964-66. They also promoted Revlon cosmetics. In March 1965, they toured the UK with Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders, Herman's Hermits, Del Shannon, and others. The Shangri-Las appeared as a quartet to promote \\"Remember\\", starting with their stint on the 1964 Labor Day Murray the K show in September. Shortly before the Shangri-Las went to the UK for the aforementioned promotional tour in Oct. 1964, Betty Weiss dropped out temporarily, leaving the group as a trio. She still is featured on the recording for \\"Leader of the Pack\\", which was recorded prior to the release of \\"Remember\\". The remaining trio went on to tour the US and also appeared on many TV shows, including Hullabaloo, Shindig!, Hollywood A-Go-Go, and Lloyd Thaxton. Many TV clips and photos of the group taken at this time (just Mary Weiss and the twins) circulated at the group's peak in popularity and beyond, which led many to recall the group being only a trio. Betty then rejoined the group in mid-1965 (her first return appearance with the Shangri-las was listed as a June 1965 Hollywood A-Go-Go Show episode hosted by Cousin Brucie in NYC), and the group appeared as a quartet once again until the start of 1966, when they permanently became a trio again (Mary Ann and Marge left at different times, replacing each other until the demise of the group). The group alternated between touring with their own band and local bands. Among the latter were the Sonics, as well as the Iguanas, featuring a young Iggy Pop. They also appeared as headliners on package tours such as Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars, and as stated previously, tours with R&B; acts like the Orlons and Joe Tex. Later in their career, the Shangri-Las did several college dates with bands like The Young Rascals, The Animals, and Vanilla Fudge. Public image The Shangri-Las' \\"tough girl\\" persona set them apart from other girl groups. Having grown up in a rough neighborhood of Queens, New York, they were less demure than their contemporaries. Rumors about supposed escapades have since become legend; for example, the story that Mary Weiss attracted the attention of the FBI for transporting a firearm across state lines. In her defense, she said someone tried to break into her hotel room one night and for protection she bought a pistol.Iain Aitch, \\"The Leader's Back\\", The Telegraph, April 14, 2007. Retrieved June 3, 2014. Whatever truth these stories may have, they were believed by fans in the 1960s, and they helped cement the group's bad-girl reputation. According to Weiss, that persona helped fend off advances from musicians on tours. The Shangri-Las continued to chart with fairly successful U.S. hit records, specializing in adolescent themes such as alienation, loneliness, abandonment, and premature death. Singles included \\"Give Him a Great Big Kiss\\", \\"Out in the Streets\\", \\"Give Us Your Blessings\\", the top ten hit \\"I Can Never Go Home Anymore\\", \\"Long Live Our Love\\" (a rare example of a song dedicated to the men at the time fighting overseas in Vietnam), \\"He Cried\\" and the spoken-word \\"Past, Present, and Future\\", featuring a musical backdrop inspired by Beethoven's \\"Moonlight Sonata\\". Noteworthy B-sides included \\"Heaven Only Knows\\", \\"The Train from Kansas City\\", \\"Dressed in Black\\" and \\"Paradise\\" (written by Harry Nilsson). Among titles in favorites lists is \\"I Can Never Go Home Anymore\\", the story of a girl who leaves home for a boy; her pride keeps her from returning to her mother who \\"grew so lonely in the end/the angels picked her for their friend\\". Lines from \\"Give Him a Great Big Kiss\\" include \\"When I say I'm in love, you best believe I'm in love, L-U-V\\", and \\"Well I hear he's bad.\\" \\"Hmm, he's good-bad, but he's not evil.\\" \\"Past, Present, and Future\\" has been said to be about rape, something Weiss disagrees with. She has said it is about \\"teenage angst,\\" heartbreak, and \\"being hurt and angsty and not wanting anyone near you.\\" Disintegration and retirement The group appeared on several TV shows and continued to tour the US, but in 1966, two of three releases on Red Bird failed to crack the U.S. top 50, though the group remained popular in England and Japan. Mary Ann Ganser left, but returned early in 1967 when Marge ‚Äì the most outspoken member, sometimes considered the leader ‚Äì left. Red Bird Records had folded. The group recorded more tracks with Shadow Morton producing (some of which remain unreleased) and signed with Mercury Records. However, Morton had begun working with Janis Ian and Vanilla Fudge, and Mercury had little enthusiasm for the group. During their Mercury stint, the Shangri-Las had no further hits; in 1968, they disbanded, amid litigation. All the Shangri-Las withdrew from the spotlight. Morton said, \\"The Shangri-Las vacated, they vanished\\". Reportedly, they were angry that they had received few royalties despite the millions of records they had sold. Mary Weiss moved to New York's Greenwich Village, then to San Francisco. Returning to Manhattan a few years later and prevented from recording because of lawsuits, she worked as a secretary while taking college classes. She then went into the architectural industry, working in the accounting department of a New York architectural firm. She moved up to be the chief purchasing agent and later ran the commercial furniture dealership. In the late eighties, she managed a furniture store and was an interior designer. By 2001, she was a furniture consultant to New York businesses. She married in 1974, but the marriage ended in 1988; she married again several years later, and her second husband now manages her music career. Betty Weiss had a daughter in 1964, necessitating her absence from the group during this period. She was the only member of the group to have a child (who was raised with the help of Betty's brother George Weiss, who died in 1998). She also married and held several jobs and now lives and works on Long Island. Mary Ann Ganser began having problems with drug and alcohol addiction in 1968. She died in Queens, New York on March 15, 1970, aged 22 , of a drug overdose. (This may either have been a heroin overdose as mentioned in a contemporary newspaper report NOTE: The New York Times published Mary Ann's sister's name in error. and on her death certificate, or a barbiturate overdose as related later by her mother to a journalist) Her death has been incorrectly reported as having been caused by encephalitis, or by a seizure disorder. Marge Ganser reportedly returned to school during the late 1960s. By the early 1970s, she married (becoming Marguerite Ganser Dorste), worked for NYNEX in Valley Stream, New York, and died of breast cancer on July 28, 1996, at age 48. The group declined offers to perform throughout the 1970s, although they did a few live performances. Following the successful re-issue of \\"Leader of the Pack\\" in the UK in 1976, which renewed interest in the group, Mary and Betty Weiss and Marge Ganser reunited. Contacting Seymour Stein of Sire Records, they spent summer 1977 in New York with producer Andy Paley. Paley said the sessions went well, but they weren't satisfied with all the material, and declined to release the record. The tapes are now owned by the Warner Music Group. They did, however, give a live performance at CBGBs; Paley put together a band, including Lenny Kaye, and after two hours of rehearsal, the Shangri-Las returned to the stage for the first time in a decade. Although the Sire sessions came to naught, the group toyed with signing to another label; however, they were put off by the insistence of record executives that they be a disco vocal group, the musical trend of the day. Mary said she envisioned the Shangri-Las like punk singer Patti Smith. Eventually, the Shangri-Las split up again. Since the 1980s, a trio has been performing under the name the Shangri-Las, although unconnected with the original group. The copycat act was put together by Dick Fox, who claimed to have bought the rights to the name, and resulted in legal action from both sides, largely due to a video tape of the new Shangri-Las claiming in public to be the original group. The original group performed for the last time at a reunion show hosted by Cousin Brucie (Bruce Morrow) in East Rutherford, New Jersey on June 3, 1989. In March 2007, Norton Records released a solo album by Mary Weiss (backed by garage rockers The Reigning Sound) titled Dangerous Game. She performed in the United States, Spain and France. Influence The streetwise image of the Shangri-Las ‚Äì initially a promotional device for \\"Leader of the Pack\\" ‚Äì contrasted with other \\"girl groups\\" of the 1960s, and they were cited as an influence by 1970s punk rock-era acts such as the New York Dolls and Blondie; the latter covered \\"Out in the Streets\\" twice. The Go-Go's have been performing \\"Remember (Walking in the Sand)\\" live ever since their early punk rock days in Los Angeles clubs. The line from \\"Give Him a Great Big Kiss\\" ‚Äì \\"When I say I'm in love, you best believe I'm in love, L-U-V\\" ‚Äì was used by the New York Dolls on their 1973 recording \\"Looking for a Kiss\\". It is also used by the English pop trio SOHO in the beginning of their song \\"Nuthin' on My Mind\\" from their album, Goddess. The New York Dolls' guitarist Johnny Thunders included a cover of \\"...Great Big Kiss\\" on his first solo album So Alone. Ian Svenonius also used the line at the beginning of \\"Today I Met the Girl I'm Going to Marry\\" by his band Nation of Ulysses on the album 13-Point Program to Destroy America. More recently, Ryan Adams (and the Cardinals) paid homage to that line in their song \\"Beautiful Sorta\\" off the album Cold Roses, but they changed it to \\"When I say L-U-V, you better believe me L-U-V. Give me a beer!\\" In 2005, Julian Cope parodied the famous line in \\"Dying to Meet You\\" from his album Citizen Cain'd. He's heard to say \\"When I say I'm dead, you best believe I'm dead, D-E-A-D\\" during the outro. In an outtake of \\"Careless\\" from their album Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash, The Replacements opened with the line \\"When I say I'm in debt, you best believe I'm in debt, D-E-T!\\" In 1972, \\"Leader of the Pack\\" was performed by Bette Midler on her debut album The Divine Miss M. The opening from \\"Leader of the Pack\\" ‚Äì \\"Is she really going out with him?\\" ‚Äì was recycled both as the opening lines of 1976's \\"New Rose\\" by the Damned, the first British punk rock single, and of \\"Kill\\" by the parody punk group Alberto Y Lost Trios Paranoias, as well as the title of the 1979 hit song by Joe Jackson. Aerosmith released a more rock-style version of \\"Remember (Walking in the Sand)\\" featuring uncredited backing vocals by Mary Weiss of the Shangri-Las as a single in 1980. It can be found on both their Greatest Hits album and on their Night in the Ruts album, and charted on the Hot 100 at 67. Scottish alternative rock band The Jesus and Mary Chain cited the Shangri-Las as an early influence. In 1985, the band's guitarist William Reid stated: \\"We all love the Shangri-Las, and one day we're going to make Shangri-Las records.\\" The Shangri-Las are referenced in John Mellencamp's 1985 single \\"R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.\\" from his third album Scarecrow. They were also referenced by Paul McCartney in a McCartney II sessions track, \\"\\"Mr H Atom\\" / \\"You Know I'll Get You Baby\\", recorded in 1979, but not released until 2011. Twisted Sister covered \\"Leader of the Pack\\" on their 1985 gold-selling album Come Out and Play. \\"Past, Present, and Future\\" was covered in 2004 by ex-ABBA singer Agnetha F√§ltskog on her album, My Colouring Book. The Johnny Thunders / Patti Palladin album Copy Cats (1988) features a version of \\"He Cried\\". Australian artist Rowland S. Howard included a version of \\"She Cried\\" on his album Teenage Snuff Film.. Although most covers and remakes of the Shangri-Las material focus on the hit singles, some express the group's influence on them by recording songs from the Shangri-Las which were never released as singles by the group. Among these, the Los Angeles rock group Redd Kross covered \\"Heaven Only Knows,\\" an album cut from the Shangri-Las' second album Shangri- Las '65. Superchunk, Belle and Sebastian, The Shop Assistants and Neko Case recorded versions of \\"The Train from Kansas City\\", which was a b-side, and an album cut from the Shangri-Las debut album, Leader of the Pack. British singer Amy Winehouse cited the Shangri-Las as an influence and occasionally integrated the hook lyrics from \\"Remember (Walkin' in the Sand)\\" into the bridge of her song \\"Back to Black\\" during live performances. Winehouse has called \\"I Can Never Go Home Anymore\\" the \\"saddest song in the world.\\" Faris Badwan of The Horrors has listed the Shangri-Las as an influence in The Horrors' sound and lyrics, and had added a reworked version of \\"He Cried\\" to \\"She Cried\\" into The Horrors' song, \\"Who Can Say,\\" using the lines, \\"And when I told her I didn‚Äôt love her anymore, she cried/and when I told her, her kisses were not like before, she cried/and when I told her another girl had caught my eye, she cried/and I kissed her, with a kiss that could only mean goodbye,\\" in spoken-word with a drum beat similar to that the Shangri-Las used. The song is also originally \\"She Cried\\" by Jay and the Americans, another (if slight) influence over The Horrors. Atlanta, Georgia band Black Lips called their 2007 album Good Bad Not Evil, after the line in \\"Give Him a Great Big Kiss\\". Sonic Youth referenced the \\"very, very close\\" lyric of \\"Give Him a Great Big Kiss\\" on the Kim Gordon/Kim Deal duet \\"Little Trouble Girl\\" in 1995. Early punk band The Slits also reference the song in \\"Love Und Romance\\" on the 1979 album Cut. The Bat for Lashes song \\"What's a Girl to Do?\\" has been widely acknowledged as a Shangri-Las pastiche. Kathleen Hanna of the electropunk group Le Tigre has mentioned that the \\"one girl calling another\\" motif and the opening sound of seagulls on the track \\"What's Yr Take on Cassavetes?\\" were inspired by the Shangri-Las. The Shangri-Las were imitated by groups like The Nu-Luvs, who had a hit with \\"So Soft, So Warm\\", which was originally recorded by the Shangri-Las as \\"Dressed In Black\\" and used as the b-side to Jay and the Americans' original, \\"He Cried\\". Others included the Pussycats and the Whyte Boots, who scored big with their single \\"Nightmare\\", originally intended for the Shangri-Las, and written, produced and performed by Lori Burton and Pam Sawyer. The Goodees had a hit in early 1969 with \\"Condition Red\\", a \\"Leader of the Pack\\"-inspired tale about a girl who wants to be with her long-haired, bearded boyfriend despite her parents' objections. The Detergents had hits with \\"Leader of the Laundromat\\" and \\"I Can Never Eat Home Any More\\", both of which were parodies of Shangri-Las records. Giddle Partridge and Boyd Rice recorded a cover of \\"Past, Present, and Future\\" in 1989. Alex Chilton often played it in concert. Brooklyn band Vivian Girls cite the Shangri-Las as one of their influences. Finnish rock band HIM used \\"Dressed in Black\\" as an intro song for their tour promoting their album Screamworks: Love in Theory and Practice. Marianne Faithfull released a cover of \\"Past, Present, and Future\\" on her 2011 album Horses and High Heels. The bridge of \\"Remember (Walking in the Sand)\\" and the background vocals of \\"Leader of the Pack\\" are heavily sampled in the track \\"No\\" from the 2012 album Dusty Rainbow from the Dark by French hip hop artist Wax Tailor. While recording her 2017 album Lust for Life, American singer Lana Del Rey was heavily influenced by The Shangri-Las. In the 2015 documentary Wider Horizons, David Gilmour, guitarist for Pink Floyd, cited the Shangri-Las as an influence, saying their music \\"painted aural pictures\\".

They are best known for a string of hits including their 1964 million-selling record \\"Chapel of Love\\", \\"People Say\\", and \\"Iko Iko\\". Career The group hit the top of the charts in 1964 with \\"Chapel of Love,\\" a song that Phil Spector, Jeff Barry, and Ellie Greenwich had originally written for The Ronettes.Bronson, Fred (2003).

New York: Delilah Books. pgs. 90‚Äì94. They first sang together in grade school. Originally, they were to be called Little Miss and the Muffets, but were named the Dixie Cups just prior to their first release. In 1963, the trio decided to pursue a professional career in music and began singing locally as the Meltones.Romanowski, Patricia (1995).The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll: Completely Revised and Updated (2nd edition). New York: Fireside Books. pp.271. Within a year Joe Jones, a successful singer in his own right with the Top Five 1960 single \\"You Talk Too Much,\\" became their manager.Whitburn, Joel (2008). Presents Across The Charts: The 1960s (first ed.). Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin: Record Research Inc. p.119. After working with them for five months, Jones took them to New York City, where record producers/songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller signed them to their new Red Bird Records. The Dixie Cups debut single was the release, \\"Chapel of Love,\\" which became their biggest hit reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart in June 1964. \\"Chapel of Love\\" sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. In 1987, the song \\"Chapel of Love\\" appeared on the Full Metal Jacket soundtrack and in the 1991 film, Father of the Bride. The hit single by The Dixie Cups was ranked No. 279 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The group also had several other hits including, \\"People Say\\" (#12, 1964), \\"You Should Have Seen the Way He Looked at Me\\" (#39, 1964), \\"Little Bell\\" (#51, 1965), and \\"Iko Iko\\" (#20, 1965). \\"Iko Iko\\", a New Orleans traditional song, was recorded in 1964 but later was released as a single early in 1965. Barbara Hawkins had heard her grandmother sing the song, first recorded in 1953 as \\"Jock-a-Mo\\" by James \\"Sugar Boy\\" Crawford. Barbara Hawkins: \\"We were just clowning around with it during a session using drumsticks on ashtrays. We didn't realize that Jerry and Mike had the tapes running\\". Leiber and Stoller overdubbed a bassline and percussion, and released it. It was The Dixie Cups' fifth and last hit. In 1965, the Dixie Cups moved to the ABC-Paramount record label before a recording hiatus in 1966 temporarily halted their careers. In 1974 the Hawkins sisters moved from New York to New Orleans, where they both began successful modelling careers. Barbara Ann and Rosa Lee also worked as make-up artists. The Dixie Cups continued to tour as a trio with another New Orleans singer, Beverly Brown, replacing Joan Johnson who became a Jehovah's Witness and left her music career. Brown who had recorded two solo discs in the early 1960s stayed as the third member until the early 80s when she became ill and was replaced by Dale Mickle. The Dixie Cups continue to perform and make personal appearances. The current line-up consists of the Hawkins sisters along with Athelgra Neville, sister of the singing Neville Brothers. On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina swept through Louisiana, flooding much of New Orleans and displacing Barbara and Rosa Hawkins, who subsequently relocated to Florida. Joan Johnson relocated to Texas. Two years later in April 2007, The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame honored The Dixie Cups for their contributions to Louisiana music by inducting them into The Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. Joan Marie Johnson died in New Orleans of congestive heart failure on October 3, 2016 at the age of 72.Blisten, John (2016) \\"Joan Marie Johnson, 'Chapel of Love' Singer, Dead at 72\\", Rolling Stone, October 11, 2016.

Some members of the critical legal studies movement ‚Äî primarily legal academics in the United States ‚Äî argued that the answer to this question is \\"no.\\" Another way to state this position is to suggest that disputes cannot be resolved with clear answers and thus there is at least some amount of uncertainty in legal reasoning and its application to disputes. A given body of legal doctrine is said to be \\"indeterminate\\" by demonstrating that every legal rule in that body of legal doctrine is opposed by a counterrule that can be used in a process of legal reasoning. The indeterminacy thesis emerged as a left reply to Ronald Dworkin's \\"right answer\\" thesis. In its strongest form it is an extreme version of legal realism. It argues that nothing is law until it has been promulgated by an official - either a judge or the legislature. For example, a statute that says \\"No person may smoke in a hospital\\" does not mean that \\"John Doe may not smoke in a hospital\\"; the second statement is the law only if a legitimate authority declares so. This is because one cannot describe a legal statement as right or wrong without making a normative value judgment about what the law should be. In the 1990s the indeterminacy thesis came under heavy attack by liberal and conservative defenders of the rule of law, and the debate, though its mantle is in the process of being taken up by a new generation of scholars, has left the intellectual spotlight for the time being. The thesis can be criticised because the concept of legal mistake is recognised in a determinative theory of law. While such a mistake necessarily involves a normative judgment, it is not truly subjective. A positivist Hartian theory contends that this judgment is conventionally objective because the rule of recognition fails to recognise the mistake as legally valid. According to a liberal theory such as Dworkin's, the normativity of the judgment is one of reason rather than of value.

The abbreviations \\"CLS\\" and \\"Crit\\" are sometimes used to refer to the movement and its adherents. History Although the intellectual origins of the critical legal studies (CLS) can be generally traced to American legal realism, as a distinct scholarly movement CLS fully emerged only in the late 1970s. Many first-wave American CLS scholars entered legal education, having been profoundly influenced by the experiences of the civil rights movement, women's rights movement, and the anti-war movement of the 1960s and 1970s. What started off as a critical stance towards American domestic politics eventually translated into a critical stance towards the dominant legal ideology of modern Western society. Drawing on both domestic theory and the work of European social theorists, the \\"crits\\" sought to demystify what they saw as the numerous myths at the heart of mainstream legal thought and practice. The British critical legal studies movement started roughly at a similar time as its American counterpart. However, it centered around a number of conferences held annually, particularly the Critical Legal Conference and the National Critical Lawyers Group. There remain a number of fault lines in the community; between theory and practice, between those who look to Marxism and those who worked on Deconstruction, between those who look to explicitly political engagements and those who work in aesthetics and ethics. In France, where the legal tradition had been closely guarded by law faculties and watched over by Napoleonic institutions such as the Court of Cassation, the Conseil d'Etat, and the Ecole Nationale De la Magistrature, famed sociologist Pierre Bourdieu caused an uproar when he released his \\"La Force De La Loi, Elements Pour Une Sociologie du Champ Juridique\\" in 1986 - translated as \\"The Force of Law: Toward a Sociology of the Juridical Field\\", in the Hastings Law Journal (1987). It heralded the beginning of continental Critical Legal Studies. Relation to American legal realism Critical legal studies had its intellectual origins in the American legal realist movement in the 1930s. Prior to the 1930s, American jurisprudence had been dominated by a formalist account of how courts decide cases, an account which held that judges decide cases on the basis of distinctly legal rules and reasons that justify a unique result. The legal realists argued that statutory and case law is indeterminate, and that appellate courts decide cases not based upon law, but upon what they deem fair in light of the facts of a case. Considered \\"the most important jurisprudential movement of the 20th century\\",Leiter, Brian, American Legal Realism. U of Texas Law, Public Law Research Paper No. 42. Available at SSRN. DOI, 10.2139/ssrn.339562. American legal realism sent a shock through American legal scholarship by undermining the formalist tenets that were long considered a bedrock of jurisprudence. The influence of legal realism unsettled American jurisprudence for decades. Alan Hunt writes that the period \\"between the realism of the 1930s and the emergence of critical legal studies in the late 1970s has been a series of unsuccessful attempts to recover from the shock of realism some basis for a legal theory which articulates an image of the objectivity of the legal process, even though the explanation offered by post-realism had to be more complex than that provided by a doctrine of rule-following.\\" As a literature and a network The critical legal studies movement emerged in the mid-1970s as a network of leftist law professors in the United States who developed the realist indeterminacy thesis in the service of leftist ideals. According to Roberto Unger, the movement \\"continued as an organizing force only until the late 1980s. Its life as a movement lasted for barely more than a decade.\\"Unger 2015, p. 24. Duncan Kennedy, a Harvard law professor who along with Unger was one of the key figures in the movement, has said that, in the early days of critical legal studies, \\"just about everyone in the network was a white male with some interest in 60s style radical politics or radical sentiment of one kind or another. Some came from Marxist backgrounds--some came from democratic reform.\\"Gerard J. Clark, \\"A Conversation with Duncan Kennedy,\\" The Advocate: The Suffolk University Law School Journal, Vol. 24, No. 2 (1994): 56-61. See . Kennedy has emphasized the twofold nature of critical legal studies, as both a network of leftist scholar/activists and a scholarly literature: > [C]ritical legal studies has two aspects. It‚Äôs a scholarly literature and it > has also been a network of people who were thinking of themselves as > activists in law school politics. Initially, the scholarly literature was > produced by the same people who were doing law school activism. Critical > legal studies is not a theory. It‚Äôs basically this literature produced by > this network of people. I think you can identify some themes of the > literature, themes that have changed over time. Scholars affiliated with critical legal studies often identified with the movement in several ways: by including in their articles an opening footnote mentioning the Conference on Critical Legal Studies and providing the organization‚Äôs contact information, by attending conferences of the CCLS, and by citing the work of fellow critical legal studies scholars. A 1984 bibliography of CLS works, compiled by Duncan Kennedy and Karl Klare and published in the Yale Law Journal, included dozens of authors and hundreds of works. A 2011 collection of four volumes edited by Costas Douzinas and Colin Perrin, with the assistance of J-M Barreto, compiles the work of the British Critical Legal Studies, including their philosophical mentors. It showcases scholarship elaborated since its origins in the late 1980s in areas such as legal philosophy, literature, psychoanalysis, aesthetics, feminism, gender, sexuality, post-colonialism, race, ethics, politics and human rights.Douzinas, Costas and Perrin, Colin. Critical Legal Theory, London: Routledge, 2011. See . Prominent participants in the CLS movement include Drucilla Cornell, Mark Kelman, Alan Hunt, Catharine MacKinnon, Duncan Kennedy, David Kennedy, Martti Koskenniemi, Gary Peller, Peter Fitzpatrick, Morton Horwitz, Jack Balkin, Costas Douzinas, Karl Klare, Peter Gabel, Roberto Unger, Renata Salecl, Mark Tushnet, Louis Michael Seidman, John Strawson and Martha Fineman. Today, a new perspective is born in Brazil, in the context of Latin America, so called the Theory of Realistic Humanism as a Critical Theory in the Theory of Law.Bittar, Eduardo C. B. Introdu√ß√£o ao Estudo do Direito: Humanism,o, Democracia e Justi√ßa, S√£o Paulo, Saraiva, 2018. Intellectual and political context Roberto Unger, a key member of critical legal studies whose influence had continued to be far-reaching in the decades following the movement‚Äôs decline, has written that the founders of critical legal studies \\"never meant it to become an ongoing school of thought or genre of writing. They wanted to intervene in a particular circumstance ...\\" That circumstance was the dominant practice of legal analysis which Unger calls the \\"method of reasoned elaboration\\".Unger 2015, p. 5. A close descendant of nineteenth-century doctrinal formalism, which sought through legal analysis to identify the \\"inbuilt legal content of a ... free society\\",Unger 2015, p. 8. the method of reasoned elaboration treated law materials as containing an \\"ideal element\\", an inherent legal substance underlying the contradictions and ambiguities in the law's text.Unger 2015, p. 6. Under the practice of reasoned elaboration, this inherent legal substance forms a prescriptive system that judges gradually uncover by reasoning through the policies and principles of law without questioning the \\"basic institutional arrangements of the market economy, of democratic politics, and of civil society outside the market and the state\\".Unger 2015, p. 7. Reasoned elaboration was a pernicious influence for several reasons, Unger and others argued: it de-emphasized the contingent nature of law as a product of deals and compromise, instead treating it as containing a coherent prescriptive system that needed simply to be uncovered by legal interpretation; it obscured how judges usurp authority by denying their own role in making law; and finally, reasoned elaboration inhibited the use of law as a mechanism of social change.Unger 2015, p. 11f. In addition to the context of legal interpretation, critical legal studies also emerged in response to its political context, namely a setting in which the social- democratic settlement that was finalized after World War II had become canonical,Unger 2015, p. 14. and active dispute over the organization of society severely declined, effectively enshrining a reigning consensus about social organization that Unger describes as including a \\"combination of neoliberal orthodoxy, state capitalism, and compensatory redistribution by tax and transfer.\\"Unger 2015, p. 15. Critical legal scholars challenged that consensus and sought to use legal theory as a means to explore alternative forms of social and political organization. In accordance with the Critical rationalism the German jurist Reinhold Zippelius uses Popper's method of \\"trial and error\\" in his 'Legal Philosophy'.Reinhold Zippelius, Die experimentierende Methode im Recht, Akademie Mainz, 1991, ; Rechtsphilosophie, 6. Aufl. 2011, ¬ß 11 III, Themes Although the CLS (like most schools and movements) has not produced a single, monolithic body of thought, several common themes can be generally traced in its adherents' works. These include: * A first theme is that contrary to the common perception, legal materials (such as statutes and case law) do not completely determine the outcome of legal disputes, or, to put it differently, the law may well impose many significant constraints on the adjudicators in the form of substantive rules, but, in the final analysis, this may often not be enough to bind them to come to a particular decision in a given particular case. Quite predictably, once made, this claim has triggered many lively debates among jurists and legal philosophers, some of which continue to this day (see further indeterminacy debate in legal theory). * Secondly, there is the idea that all \\"law is politics\\". This means that legal decisions are a form of political decision, but not that it is impossible to tell judicial and legislative acts apart. Rather, CLS have argued that while the form may differ, both are based around the construction and maintenance of a form of social space. The argument takes aim at the positivist idea that law and politics can be entirely separated from one another. A more nuanced view has emerged more recently. This rejects the reductivism of 'all law is politics' and instead asserts that the two disciplines are mutually intertwined. There is no 'pure' law or politics, but rather the two forms work together and constantly shift between the two linguistic registers. * A third strand of the traditional CLS school is that far more often than is usually suspected the law tends to serve the interests of the wealthy and the powerful by protecting them against the demands of the poor and the subaltern (women, ethnic minorities, the working class, indigenous peoples, the disabled, homosexuals, etc.) for greater justice. This claim is often coupled with the legal realist argument that what the law says it does and what it actually tends to do are two different things. Many laws claim to have the aim of protecting the interests of the poor and the subaltern. In reality, they often serve the interests of the power elites. This, however, does not have to be the case, claim the CLS scholars. There is nothing intrinsic to the idea of law that should make it into a vehicle of social injustice. It is just that the scale of the reform that needs to be undertaken to realize this objective is significantly greater than the mainstream legal discourse is ready to acknowledge. * Furthermore, CLS at times claims that legal materials are inherently contradictory, i.e. the structure of the positive legal order is based on a series of binary oppositions such as, for instance, the opposition between individualism and altruism or formal realizability (i.e. preference for strict rules) and equitable flexibility (i.e. preference for broad standards). * Finally, CLS questions law's central assumptions, one of which is the Kantian notion of the autonomous individual. The law often treats individual petitioners as having full agency vis-√†-vis their opponents. They are able to make decisions based on reason that is detached from political, social, or economic constraints. CLS holds that individuals are tied to their communities, socio-economic class, gender, race, and other conditions of life such that they cease to be autonomous actors in the Kantian mode. Rather, their circumstances determine and therefore limit the choices presented to them. People are not \\"free\\"; they are instead determined in large part by social and political structures that surround them. Increasingly, however, the traditional themes are being superseded by broader and more radical critical insights. Interventions in intellectual property law, human rights, jurisprudence, criminal law, property law, international law, etc., have proved crucial to the development of those discourses. Equally, CLS has introduced new frameworks to the legal field, such as postmodernism, queer theory, literary approaches to law, psychoanalysis, law and aesthetics, and post-colonialism. Continued influence CLS continues as a diverse collection of schools of thought and social movements. The CLS community is an extremely broad group with clusters of critical theorists at law schools and socio-legal studies departments such as Harvard Law School, Georgetown University Law Center, Northeastern University, University at Buffalo, Chicago-Kent College of Law, Birkbeck, University of London, University of Melbourne, University of Kent, Carleton University, Keele University, the University of Glasgow, the University of East London among others. In the American legal academy its influence and prominence seems to have waned in recent years. However, offshoots of CLS, including critical race theory continue to grow in popularity. Associated schools of thought, such as contemporary feminist theory and ecofeminism and critical race theory now play a major role in contemporary legal scholarship. An impressive stream of CLS-style writings has also emerged in the last two decades in the areas of international and comparative law. In addition, CLS has had a practical effect on legal education, as it was the inspiration and focus of Georgetown University Law Center's alternative first year curriculum, (Termed \\"Curriculum B\\", known as \\"Section 3\\" within the school). In the UK both Kent and Birkbeck have sought to draw critical legal insights into the legal curriculum, including a critical legal theory based LLM at Birkbeck's School of Law. Various research centers and institutions offer CLS-based taught and research courses in a variety of legal fields including human rights, jurisprudence, constitutional theory and criminal justice. In New Zealand, the University of Otago Legal Issues Centre was established at the University's law faculty in 2007. Law and Critique is one of the few UK journals that specifically identifies itself with critical legal theory. In America, The Crit and Unbound: Harvard Journal of the Legal Left are the only journals that continue to explicitly position themselves as platforms for critical legal studies. However, other journals such as Law, Culture and the Humanities, the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review, The National Lawyers Guild Review, Social and Legal Studies, and The Australian Feminist Law Journal all published avowedly critical legal research.

The original team was created by Roy Thomas and John Buscema, and derived from the previously created supervillain team Squadron Sinister. The core members of the Squadron Supreme are Hyperion, Nighthawk, Doctor Spectrum, Power Princess, and the Whizzer. These characters were pastiches of prominent members of rival publisher DC Comics' superhero team the Justice League. Many other characters were later added to the roster, not all of which were based on DC heroes. Publication history The Squadron Supreme has its roots in the Squadron Sinister, which first appeared in Avengers #70 as a pastiche of the Justice League. Roy Thomas later introduced a heroic version of the Squadron Sinister named the Squadron Supreme, which first appeared in Avengers #85‚Äì86 (February‚ÄìMarch 1971), and which was co-created with John Buscema. The team then had guest appearances on several more occasions, and in 1985 was featured in a self-titled twelve-issue limited series by Mark Gruenwald. In 2003, a reimagined Squadron Supreme appeared in an ongoing series entitled Supreme Power, published under the mature-audience MAX imprint. This version was created by writer J. Michael Straczynski and artist Gary Frank. Yet another Squadron Supreme was introduced in 2015, written by James Robinson and drawn by Leonard Kirk. Unlike the previous teams, which had appeared in alternate realities, this team was based in Marvel's main \\"Earth-616\\" reality, although the team members were from a variety of alternate universes that had been destroyed in the aftermath of the 2015 Secret Wars event. Fictional team biography =Earth-712 version= The Squadron Supreme are first encountered by four members of the Avengers ‚Äî the Vision, Quicksilver, the Scarlet Witch and Goliath ‚Äî who have arrived in the Earth-712 universe by mistake.Avengers #84 (January 1971) The Avengers are initially confused, since several members of the Squadron Supreme have identical names and powers to the Squadron Sinister, a group of previously encountered villains.Avengers #69‚Äì70 (October‚ÄìNovember 1969) After a brief battle, the Avengers assist the Squadron Supreme against the global threat posed by the mutant Brain-Child, before returning to their own universe.Avengers #85‚Äì86 (Feb‚ÄìMar 1971) The Squadron Supreme have another series of skirmishes with the Avengers engineered by the group the Serpent Cartel, but eventually they join forces and prevent the use of the Serpent Crown.Avengers #141‚Äì144 (November 1975 ‚Äì February 1976) & #147‚Äì149 (May‚ÄìJuly 1976) The team features briefly in the title Thor, when the evil version of Hyperion attacks the Earth-712 version and then the Earth-616 Thor.Thor #280 (February 1979) The Squadron appear in the title Defenders as mind-controlled pawns of the entities the Over-Mind and Null the Living Darkness, but are freed and aid the Defenders in defeating the villains.Defenders #112‚Äì114 (October‚ÄìDecember 1982) Earth-712, however, is left in a post-apocalyptic state. The Squadron Supreme were next featured in a self-titled 12-issue miniseries (Sep 1985 ‚Äì Aug 1986) by writer Mark Gruenwald,Squadron Supreme #1‚Äì12 (Sep 1985 ‚Äì Aug 1986) which picks up from where Earth-712 was last seen in Defenders #114. The Squadron, led by Hyperion, believe they have the knowledge and power to recreate the world and create a utopia. Nighthawk protests, believing that the Squadron should serve and not rule. The issue is put to a vote, with the so-called \\"Utopia Program\\" favored by the majority of the Squadron; Nighthawk, unable to agree with the decision in clear conscience, resigns from the team. The Squadron assume overall control of the government of the United States and remake the nation into a virtual utopia. The team implement a series of sweeping changes, including revealing their secret identities; instituting a program of behavior modification in prisons where inmates are forced to submit to a process that mentally inhibits their criminal instincts; enforcing a strict gun control policy; and developing medical technology to cryogenically preserve the dead. Despite the economic and technological advances, there are setbacks: Golden Archer abuses the behavior modification technology by forcing fellow member Lady Lark to love him, resulting in his eventual removal from the team; Amphibian becomes increasingly disgusted with the Squadron's methods and abandons the surface world altogether; Nuke inadvertently kills his parents via unnoticed and uncontrollable release of radiation and dies while battling Doctor Spectrum during a rampage; and Tom Thumb discovers he has cancer but chooses not to inform his teammates, eventually succumbing to the disease. At one point, the team is attacked by the Institute of Evil. The Squadron ultimately defeats the Institute and uses the behavior modification technology to reform them, adding the former supervillains as members. Three of them die or are incapacitated. In the meantime Nighthawk forms a new team he calls the America Redeemers, recruiting former villains and several previously unknown superhumans. The later infiltrate the Squadron and kidnap the surviving Institute members to reverse the behavior modification on them. Despite mixed feelings on the parts of several of the Institute members, they too join the Redeemers. Former Squadron member Golden Archer (now known as Black Archer) also joins. Eventually, the Redeemers confront the Squadron Supreme. A brutal battle ensues in which several members of both teams are killed, including Nighthawk. A horrified Hyperion realizes that Nighthawk was right: the Squadron, despite having good intentions, had inadvertently created a totalitarian state, with themselves as its dictators. The Squadron surrenders, disbands, and returns control of the United States to the government.Squadron Supreme #12. Marvel Comics. In a graphic novel sequel by Gruenwald, Ryan, and inker Al Williamson, Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe, remnants of the team reunite to battle the Nth Man. Although they succeed, several members of the Squadron are killed, with the remainder (Hyperion, Doctor Spectrum, Whizzer, Power Princess, Lady Lark (now known as Skylark), Arcanna, Haywire, and Shape) marooned in the mainstream Marvel universe.Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe (1989).

Marvel Comics. The Squadron come into conflict with a new government when an interdimensional team called the Exiles, traveling from the Earth-616 universe, reveal that the government had rigged the election through worldwide vote fraud. The Squadron and the Exiles depose the new government and attempt to allow society to progress without superhuman involvement.Exiles (vol. 2) #77‚Äì78 (Apr‚ÄìMay 2006). Marvel Comics. =Supreme Power= The series Supreme Power features the rebooted version of the superhero team Squadron Supreme and is set on Earth-31916.Supreme Power #1‚Äì18 (Jan. 2003 ‚Äì Oct. 2005) Alien Hyperion arrives on Earth as an infant, and is taken into custody by the US government and raised in a controlled environment. Army corporal Joseph Ledger is given a strange crystal removed from Hyperion's spaceship by the government that bonds to him causing him to fall into a coma for years. Discovering Hyperion has superhuman abilities, the government uses him as a secret weapon, and is eventually outed by the media. The government then announces and introduces Hyperion as a state-sponsored hero, which encourages other beings to appear, such as Blur, who can move at superspeed. Ledger awakens, and, harnessing the energy powers of the crystal, becomes Doctor Spectrum. Hyperion and Spectrum are initially hostile to one another, and they battle, with Hyperion accessing lost memories when coming in contact with Spectrum's crystal. Amphibian is seen on dry land for the first time, and Princess Zarda heals Hyperion after his battle. Nighthawk solicits the aid of Hyperion and the Blur to deal with a superpowered serial killer, who Hyperion now knows is actually the product of experimentation with his DNA. Although successful, Hyperion is outraged by the government exploitation and leaves, warning that he has no wish to be contacted by humankind again. The government gathers the remaining superhumans into a team to capture Hyperion. The story continues in the limited series Supreme Power: HyperionSupreme Power: Hyperion #1‚Äì5 (Nov. 2005 ‚Äì Mar. 2006) with new Squadron members Emil Burbank, Arcanna, Shape and Nuke tracking Hyperion to what they believe is an alternate reality. In this world, Hyperion and a version of the Squadron rule the world, with only Nighthawk and a small group of superhumans opposing their rule. Although the heroes locate the true Hyperion and convince him to return to their world, Burbank discovers that it was in fact not an alternate reality but their world two years from the present time. =Second Squadron Supreme title= The second volume of the series Squadron SupremeSquadron Supreme (vol. 2) #1‚Äì7 (May ‚Äì Nov. 2006) brings together all the superhumans (except a reluctant Nighthawk), who are split into two teams‚Äîone for international/public missions and another for covert operations. The President of the United States calls the group the Squadron Supreme. The Squadron meets with mixed success: an attempt to kill an African dictator is botched, and the target is murdered by local superhumans who state the group is not welcome in Africa, and a mission to Iran has member Inertia encouraging a victim to fight back and kill. China recruits Redstone, the superpowered serial killer created from Hyperion's DNA, in a bid to protect itself. The final issue is a battle to the death against Redstone (with the Blur recruiting Nighthawk to assist) who threatens to detonate a nuclear weapon. The outcome is not revealed, as the series concluded with issue #7. =Ultimate Power= An unrelated nine-issue series, Ultimate Power, written by J. Michael Straczynski; Brian Michael Bendis and Jeph Loeb with art by Greg Land,Ultimate Power #1‚Äì3 (Dec. 2006 ‚Äì Feb. 2007); #4‚Äì5 (June‚ÄìJuly 2007); #6‚Äì7 (Sep.‚ÄìOct. 2007); #8 (Dec. 2007) and #9 (Feb. 2008) features the Squadron in a crossover into the Ultimate Universe. Courtesy of a deception engineered by Nick Fury and the Ultimate villain Doctor Doom, the Squadron travel to the Ultimate universe, thinking that the Ultimate Reed Richards is responsible for releasing an organism that has destroyed much of the United States. A series of misunderstandings ensues, and after a series of battles between the Squadron, Ultimate Fantastic Four, Ultimates and the Earth-712 Squadron Supreme (whose world was also affected by the organism), the third culprit is revealed as Burbank, who was asked by the government to develop a weapon to kill Hyperion. Nick Fury is detained in custody in the Earth-31916 universe, while Squadron member Power Princess remains in the Ultimate universe to ensure that Doom (who escaped custody by using a Doombot) is captured. =Squadron Supreme: Hyperion vs. Nighthawk= An unrelated four-issue limited series, Squadron Supreme: Hyperion vs. Nighthawk, written by Marc Guggenheim and with art by Paul Gulacy, relates how Hyperion and Nighthawk, after an initial skirmish, join forces to try and alleviate the Darfur conflict in war- torn Sudan. Hyperion discovers Nighthawk has a prototype weapon built from stolen plans of Emil Burbank's journal that cannot actually injure him, but can convince him that he is being injured.Squadron Supreme: Hyperion vs. Nighthawk #1‚Äì4 (March‚ÄìJune 2007) =Third Squadron Supreme title= A third volume of the title Squadron Supreme, written by Howard Chaykin and with art by Greg Land (and other artists), is published,Squadron Supreme (vol. 3) #1‚Äì12 (Sep. 2008 ‚Äì July 2009) with the 12-issue series being set five years after the battle with Redstone. Most of the Squadron have disappeared, with Ultimate Nick Fury, Burbank and Arcanna now a team of intelligence officers working for the government and investigating a group of returning astronauts that exhibit strange abilities. The astronauts infect many people they come into contact with, also giving them superhuman abilities. Fury eventually leads a new version of the Squadron that features characters who are pastiches of long- time Marvel characters. The group eventually come into conflict with many of the original members of the Squadron who have been gathered by Hyperion. The heroes unite to stop a group of superhuman terrorists from the Middle East, but then, via a government device, apparently all lose their abilities. Arcanna secretly reveals to Fury that she, and likely many others, still possesses superhuman abilities. Fury later returns to the Ultimate universe. =Later appearances= Later, the members of Squadron Supreme are apparently killed by Namor and the Cabal after the villains raid the Squadron's universe.New Avengers (vol. 3) #24 Versions resembling these characters later appear on the Battleworld created by Doctor Doom during the Secret Wars event, only to be killed again at the hands of Squadron Sinister. Nighthawk is left as the group's only survivor.Squadron Sinister #1 =Earth-616 version= This team, set in Marvel's mainstream reality, features characters from numerous alternate universes, such as the Nighthawk from Supreme Power, a Hyperion from a reality that had been destroyed upon colliding with another universe, Doctor Spectrum from the world of the Great Society (which was destroyed by Namor to prevent it from colliding with the mainstream universe), Blur from the New Universe, and Warrior Woman from a Secret Wars tie-in (posing as the Earth-712 Squadron Supreme's Power Princess).Avengers (vol. 6) #0. Marvel Comics. The Squadron Supreme's first action was to get revenge on Namor for what happened to the worlds of some of its members. They attacked Atlantis where Hyperion beheaded Namor and Zarda killed Attuma. The fight ended with Hyperion lifting Atlantis above the ocean and throwing it onto the ground hard enough to kill the remaining Atlanteans present.Squadron Supreme (vol 4) #1. Marvel Comics.

Thundra sides with the Squadron Supreme, although she is unsure if she should help the Squadron Supreme protect the world or help protect the world from the Squadron Supreme.Squadron Supreme (vol. 4) #5. Marvel Comics. Through Modred the Mystic's magical modifications to Reed Richard's time machine, Hyperion and Doctor Spectrum are accidentally transformed into ephemeral \\"ghosts\\" caught in the past; specifically during the Squadron's attack on Atlantis and just before Hyperion kills Namor. They decide to change the past by dragging this past Namor back to the present, thereby resurrecting him. Although this action is easy for Hyperion, who has had second thoughts about the cutthroat methods the Squadron Supreme has been using, it is more difficult for Doctor Spectrum, as Namor destroyed her Earth. At the end of the story arc, Hyperion leads the action to disband the Squadron, and the team goes their separate ways.Squadron Supreme (vol. 4) #13‚Äì15. Marvel Comics. =Squadron Supreme of America= When the Avengers become a global peacekeeping force, Thunderbolt Ross meets with Phil Coulson to discuss the matter. Phil reveals that he has established the Squadron Supreme of America as the newest United States superhero team. The team consists of Hyperion, Power Princess, Nighthawk, Blur, and Doctor Spectrum as their leader.Avengers #700. Marvel Comics. With Doctor Spectrum as their leader, the Squadron Supreme of America were first used to fight Namor and his Defenders of the Deep, when they attacked a Roxxon oil rig that is off the coast of Alaska.Avengers (vol. 8) #10.

During the War of the Realms storyline, the Squadron Supreme of America were summoned to Washington D.C. by Phil Coulson, who brought them up to speed on Malekith's invasion. They are shown fighting Rock Trolls and Frost Giants. Their origin is fully shown, where its members are revealed to be simulacrums created by Mephisto and programmed by the Power Elite so that Phil Coulson can have them be a United States-sponsored superhero team. After the Squadron Supreme caused the Frost Giants to retreat, Phil Coulson sends them to Ohio which has become a battleground.Avengers (vol. 8) #18. Marvel Comics. The Squadron Supreme are summoned to confront Black Panther when he infiltrates the Pentagon and confronts Phil Coulson. Hyperion states that the Squadron Supreme are the United States' sanctioned superhero team in light of the Avengers becoming an anti-American team. As Nighthawk states to Blur that Black Panther won't run as he is under arrest, Black Panther states to them that he doesn't know how they got their powers and that they are not the Squadron Supreme as he even asked if they trust Phil Coulson. Before they can grab him, Black Panther contacts Broo to teleport him away. As he disappears, Black Panther states that Phil Coulson won't answer their questions and that the Avengers aren't their enemies unless they forced them to be.Avengers (vol. 8) #21. Marvel Comics.

In other media * The Squadron Supreme appears in the \\"Whom Continuity Would Destroy\\" episode of The Super Hero Squad Show. The members present are Nighthawk, Power Princess, and Hyperion. Thanos and Grandmaster pit Iron Man, Scarlet Witch, and Hulk against the Squadron members. * The Squadron Supreme also appears in the TV series Avengers Assemble. The group consists of Hyperion, Zarda, Nighthawk, Speed Demon, Doctor Spectrum, and Nuke. This version of the Squadron are aliens who attempted to rule their planet and destroyed it when the populace failed to blindly obey them. In the first-season episode \\"Hyperion\\", Hyperion arrives on Earth and plans to do the same to this new world that he had done to his. He is imprisoned by the Avengers, but later escapes and joins the Red Skull's Cabal. In the second season, the Squadron Supreme reunite and plan to become the \\"protectors\\" of Earth, which leads to them clashing with the Avengers. In the episode \\"Dark Avengers\\" they use the reality stone to make people believe they are heroes and turn the Avengers into villains.

The term is used to indicate the assumption that follows is chosen arbitrarily, narrowing the premise to a particular case, but does not affect the validity of the proof in general. The other cases are also proven by some symmetry ‚Äî or another equivalence or similarity. As a result, once a proof is given for the particular case, it is trivial to adapt it to prove the conclusion in all other cases. In many scenarios, the use of \\"without loss of generality\\" is made possible by the presence of symmetry. For example, if some property P(x,y) of real numbers is known to be symmetric in x and y, namely that P(x,y) is equivalent to P(y,x), then in proving that P(x,y) holds for every x and y, one may assume, \\"without loss of generality\\", that x ‚â§ y. There is no loss of generality in this assumption, since once the case x ‚â§ y ‚áí P(x,y) has been proved, the other case follows by y ‚â§ x ‚áífrom the just proved implication by interchanging x and y P(y,x) ‚áíby symmetry of P P(x,y), thereby showing that P(x,y) holds for all cases. On the other hand, if such a symmetry (or other form of equivalence) cannot be established, then the use of \\"without loss of generality\\" is incorrect and can amount to an instance of proof by example ‚Äî a logical fallacy of proving a claim by proving a non-representative example.  Example  Consider the following theorem (which is a case of the pigeonhole principle): A proof: Here, notice that the above argument works because the exact same reasoning could be applied if the alternative assumption, namely, that the first object is blue, were made.

In it he describes his conception of justice. It comprises two main principles of liberty and equality; the second is subdivided into Fair Equality of Opportunity and the Difference Principle. Rawls arranges the principles in 'lexical priority', prioritising in the order of the Liberty Principle, Fair Equality of Opportunity and the Difference Principle. This order determines the priorities of the principles if they conflict in practice. The principles are, however, intended as a single, comprehensive conception of justice‚Äî'Justice as Fairness'‚Äîand not to function individually. These principles are always applied so as to ensure that the \\"least advantaged\\" are benefitted and not hurt or forgotten. Rawls originally presented the theory in his 1971 book A Theory of Justice, subsequently expanding upon several of its themes in his later book titled Political Liberalism. First principle: the liberty principle The first and most important principle states that every individual has an equal right to basic liberties, Rawls claiming \\"that certain rights and freedoms are more important or 'basic' than others\\".Freeman, 2007:45 For example, Samuel Freeman argues, Rawls believes that \\"personal property\\"‚Äîpersonal belongings, a home‚Äîconstitutes a basic liberty, but an absolute right to unlimited private property is not.Freeman, 2007:50 As basic liberties, these rights are inalienable: no government can amend, infringe or remove such rights from individuals.Freeman 2007:51 Thomas Mertens says Rawls contends that principles for a society are just when chosen by representative citizens placed within \\"fair\\" conditions. In A Theory of Justice, Rawls articulates the Liberty Principle as the most extensive basic liberty compatible with similar liberty for others; he later amended this in Political Liberalism, stating instead that \\"each person has an equal claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic rights and liberties\\".Rawls 2005:5 Second principle: the equality principle The Equality Principle is the component of Justice as Fairness establishing distributive justice. Rawls awards the Fair Equality of Opportunity Principle lexical priority over the Difference Principle: a society cannot arrange inequalities to maximize the share of the least advantaged whilst not allowing access to certain offices or positions. =Fair equality of opportunity= This principle maintains that \\"offices and positions\\"Freeman, 2010:86 should be open to any individual, regardless of his or her social background, ethnicity or sex. It is stronger than 'Formal Equality of Opportunity' in that Rawls argues that an individual should not only have the right to opportunities, but should have an effective equal chance as another of similar natural ability.Werner, 2008: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/equal-opportunity/#2 =Difference principle= The Difference Principle regulates inequalities: it only permits inequalities that work to the advantage of the worst-off. This is often misinterpreted as trickle-down economics; Rawls' argument is more accurately expressed as a system where wealth \\"diffuses up\\".Freeman, 2010:291‚Äì92 & 222‚Äì23 By guaranteeing the worst-off in society a fair deal, Rawls compensates for naturally occurring inequalities (talents that one is born with, such as a capacity for sport). Rawls justifies the Difference Principle on the basis that, since Fair Equality of Opportunity has lexical priority, the Just choice from Pareto optimal scenarios which could occur would be that benefiting the worst-off rather than the best-off. Original position A key component of Rawls' argument is his claim that his Principles of Justice would be chosen by parties in the original position.Freeman, 2009: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/ This is a thought experiment in which the parties select principles that will determine the basic structure of the society they will live in. This choice is made from behind a veil of ignorance, which would deprive participants of information about their particular characteristics: his or her ethnicity, social status, gender and, crucially, their conception of the good. This forces participants to select principles impartially and rationally. See also *Justice as Fairness: A Restatement Notes References * Avineri, S. and de-Shalit, A. (ed.)

Internationally, telephone numbers are systematically organized by the E.164 standard, while the Internet uses the Domain Name System (DNS) for linking domain names to IP addresses and other resource information. Telephone number mapping systems provide facilities to determine applicable Internet communications servers responsible for servicing a given telephone number using DNS queries. The most prominent facility for telephone number mapping is the E.164 number to URI mapping (ENUM) standard. It uses special DNS record types to translate a telephone number into a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) or IP address that can be used in Internet communications. Rationale Being able to dial telephone numbers the way customers have come to expect is considered crucial for the convergence of classic telephone service (PSTN) and Internet telephony (Voice over IP, VoIP), and for the development of new IP multimedia services. The problem of a single universal personal identifier for multiple communication services can be solved with different approaches. One simple approach is the Electronic Number Mapping System (ENUM), developed by the IETF, using existing E.164 telephone numbers, protocols and infrastructure to indirectly access different services available under a single personal identifier. ENUM also permits connecting the IP world to the telephone system in a seamless manner. System details For an ENUM subscriber to be able to activate and use the ENUM service, it needs to obtain three elements from a Registrar: *A personal Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to be used on the IP part of the network, as explained below. *One E.164 regular personal telephone number associated with the personal URI, to be used on the PSTN part of the network. *Authority to write their call forwarding/termination preferences in the NAPTR record accessible via the personal URI. This works as follows: (1) the Registrar provides the Subscriber (or Registrant) with a domain name, the URI, that will be used for accessing a DNS server to fetch a NAPTR record, (2) a personal E.164 telephone number (the ENUM number). The URI domain name of (1) is biunivocally associated (one-to-one mapped) to the subscriber E.164 ENUM number of (2). Finally (3) the NAPTR record corresponding to the subscriber URI contains the subscriber call forwarding/termination preferences. Therefore, if a calling party being at the PSTN network dials a called party ENUM number by touch typing the E.164 called party number, the number will be translated at the ENUM gateway into the corresponding URI. This URI will be used for looking-up and fetching the NAPTR record obtaining the called party wishes about how the call should be forwarded or terminated (either on IP or on PSTN terminations) ‚Äì the so-called access information ‚Äì which the registrant (the called party) has specified by writing his/her choice at the NAPTR record (\\"Naming Authority Pointer Resource Records\\" as defined in RFC 3403), such as e-mail addresses, a fax number, a personal website, a VoIP number, mobile telephone numbers, voice mail systems, IP-telephony addresses, web pages, GPS coordinates, call diversions or instant messaging. Alternatively, when the calling party is at the IP side, the User Agent (UA) piece of software of the dialler will allow to dial a E.164 number, but the dialler UA will convert it into a URI, to be used for looking-up at the ENUM gateway DNS and fetch the NAPTR record obtaining the called party wishes about how the call should be forwarded or terminated (again, either on IP or on PSTN terminations). Calling by using a new personal E.164 number (the ENUM number) to look-up at a database is therefore an indirect calling support service. The ITU ENUM allocates a specific zone, namely \\"e164.arpa\\" for use with ENUM E.164 numbers on the IP side of the network. RFC 6116 defines how any E.164 number, such as +1 555 42 42 can be transformed into a URI, by reversing the numbers, separating them with dots and adding the e164.arpa suffix thus: 2.4.2.4.5.5.5.1.e164.arpa The URI can then be used for obtaining the Internet Protocol addresses for services such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) VoIP telephony. In the DNS, NAPTR records are used for setting the subscriber call forwarding/termination preferences. Therefore, the whole system can 'translate' E.164 addresses to SIP addresses. An example NAPTR record is: $ORIGIN 2.4.2.4.5.5.5.1.e164.arpa. IN NAPTR 100 10 \\"u\\" \\"E2U+sip\\" \\"!^.*$!sip:phoneme@example.net!\\" . IN NAPTR 102 10 \\"u\\" \\"E2U+mailto\\" \\"!^.*$!mailto:myemail@example.com!\\" . This example specifies that if you want to use the \\"E2U+sip\\" service, you should use sip:phoneme@example.net as the address. The regular expression can be used by a telephone company to easily assign addresses to all of its clients. For example, if your number is +15554242, your SIP address is sip:4242@555telco.example.net; if your number is +15551234, your SIP address is sip:1234@555telco.example.net. The following Figure illustrates how ENUM works by giving an example: Subscriber A sets out to call Subscriber B. Application scenario for Voice over IP (VoIP) with ENUM. * The user agent of an ENUM-enabled subscriber terminal device, or a PBX, or a gateway, translates the request for the number +34 98 765 4321 in accordance with the rule described in RFC 6116 into the ENUM domain 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.4.3.e164.arpa. * A request is sent to the DNS for the NAPTR record of the domain name 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.4.3.e164.arpa. * The query returns a result set of NAPTR records, as per RFC 3403. In the example above, the response is an address that can be reached in the Internet using the VoIP protocol SIP per RFC 3261. * The terminal application now sets up a communication link, and the call is routed via the Internet. The ENUM user does not notice anything of this reversal and the DNS database look-up, as this is done automatically behind the scenes using a user agent software in his PC or terminal, or at the PABX or Gateway. For instance, when the user types the telephone number in his web browser ENUM enabled agent and indicates what item of information he is looking for (email address, telephone number, web address, etc.) in the PC or terminal the number is converted to a domain name. This is sent to ENUM servers on the Internet, which send back the NAPTR records associated with the name. The access information and any priority indicated for them are stored in these. The user gets the requested address back on his PC or terminal. ENUM therefore in fact functions as a mechanism for translating a telephone number into a domain name with the requested address or number associated with it, but without the user viewing how this is done, just as he is currently unaware that he is using the DNS when he makes a connection with the Internet or what is going on at the telephone switch when he makes a call. Uses =Call forwarding= Call forwarding with ENUM One way of doing call forwarding with ENUM is illustrated in the next figure. The caller uses the telephone to dial the number of another subscriber, which leads to an ENUM lookup (such as is provided by SIP Broker). The DNS responds to the caller by returning a list with NAPTR records for VoIP communication, telephone numbers and email addresses. Next, an attempt will be made, using the VoIP record from this list, to establish a connection with the subscriber. If the subscriber is not online, the next record selected will be that for a connection to a PSTN or mobile telephone. If this attempt fails too, a voice message will be sent to the subscriber via a listed email address. Subdomains of e164.arpa are delegated on a country-code basis by the ITU. Each delegation is normally made to a regulatory body designated by the national government for the country code concerned. What happens at a country level is a National Matter. In general the conventional DNS registry-registrar model is used. The national ENUM registry manages and operates the DNS infrastructure and related systems for country-code.e164.arpa. It takes registration requests from registrars who are agents of the end users, the registrants. Registrars are typically VoIP providers and telcos who bundle an ENUM registration as part of a VoIP service package. People using an ENUM-enabled VoIP service can dial the registrant's existing number and be connected to the registrant's VoIP telephone over the Internet instead of using the PSTN. When they call someone who does not use ENUM, calls complete over the Public Switched Telephone Network or PSTN in the usual manner. Support for \`.e164.arpa\` varies widely between countries; many do not support it at all. Alternative ENUM-like registries have also emerged. These services verify PSTN numbers and can be used in addition to or as an alternative to e164.arpa. However, if the registry in which a callee's number is not known by the caller, the choice between registries can create confusion and complexity. Multiple DNS lookups may be needed and it is far from simple to know which E.164 numbers are registered in which of these alternate ENUM- like trees. It is also possible that if an E.164 number is registered in several of these trees, there can be inconsistencies in the information that is returned. Furthermore, the subscriber \\"owning\\" a particular E.164 number may not be aware that their number has been entered into one or more of these alternate ENUM-like trees or what information these alternate trees are returning for their E.164 number. =Called party facility= ENUM can also be viewed as a called party facility. Basically, it is an indirect dialling service designed to work seamlessly on PSTN and VoIP that builds on the great value of the E.164 numbers: billions of people knowing how to dial using numbers. If the called person has opted to use ENUM she/he will have published the ENUM number and have entered (via ENUM NAPTR) his/her wishes for how the call should be terminated. This might be a single VoIP identifier, but most likely it will be a list of how the call should be forwarded to various fixed- line, cellphones, secretarial or voice mail services, either at the IP or at the PSTN side of the network. It is the called party choice to opt-in ENUM and also to decide to let the calling party know her/his wishes. Today when a user places a regular phone call, he has to begin deciding how to establish the call with the other party: via VoIP, Fixed-line PSTN, cellphone, entering a URI or dialling a number. With ENUM indirect dialling it is the called party wishes that matter and solve that decision. Another benefit of indirect dialling is to free the user to change his phone telco, webpage, IMS, email or whatever telecom service he uses without having to tell all his contacts about that. A presence enhanced ENUM facility having various profiles could automatically change the called party wishes as a function of where he/she is available. This could be a mechanism to automatically switch between cellphone and VoIP to the most convenient (or the less costing) termination. ENUM varieties One potential source of confusion, when talking about ENUM, is the variety of ENUM implementations in place today. Quite often, people speaking of ENUM are really referring to only one of the following: * Public ENUM: The original vision of ENUM as a global, public directory-like database, with subscriber opt-in capabilities and delegation at the country code level in the e164.arpa domain. This is also referred to as user ENUM. * Open Enum: An effort of mobile carriers and other parties involved in mobile numbering plans to generate complete, public database of all international numbering plan, available via public dns. * Private ENUM: A carrier, VoIP operator or ISP may use ENUM techniques within its own networks, in the same way DNS is used internally to networks. * Carrier ENUM: Groups of carriers or communication service providers agree to share subscriber information via ENUM in private peering relationships. The carriers themselves control subscriber information, not the individuals. Carrier ENUM is also referred to as infrastructure ENUM, and is being the subject of new IETF recommendations to support VoIP peering..... Parties having a direct interest in ENUM Various parties are involved with ENUM. These include: ;The registrant or subscriber :The registrant is the person or subscriber that makes his access information available to others through ENUM. The registrant or subscriber is thus the person whose information has been included in ENUM and must not be confused with the person who uses the Internet to find an address through ENUM. ;The registrar :The registrar is the party who manages the registrant‚Äôs access information and ensures that it is publicly available on the Internet. ;The registry :The registry is the manager of a national ENUM zone. The registry forms, as it were, the top of the national ENUM hierarchy and ensures that reference is made to the registrars‚Äô servers on which the access information is located. :Because of the hierarchical structure of the DNS, there can only be one registry for every national ENUM zone. To prevent abuse of this position, requirements are strict with respect to the impartiality of the registry and the costs and quality of the service. In addition every registrant must receive equal and open access. ;The government or the regulator :Usually a governmental entity or a regulatory authority has control over the National zone of ENUM and will play a role in the appointment of the registry. ;The number holder operator :Telephony services or telecommunication services operators have been assigned blocks of numbers by the regulator. They subsequently enable their users to use individual telephone numbers from those number blocks. Examples are the numbers for fixed telephony and mobile telephony. The number holder operator will be interconnected to other operators and will receive from them calls to his assigned range of numbers, for the calls to be terminated. :In ENUM the number holder operator will typically be the gateway operator or, alternatively, will have an arrangement with a gateway operator, to whom he will transit the calls. :But ENUM is a personal number, meant to be valid for the registrant life. Consequently in ENUM once the operator number holder assigns a number to a registrant, the number belongs to that registrant during his/her entire life. :Hence, if the registrant wishes to change his initial number holder operator (that might also coincide being his gateway operator) there have to be provisions for the ENUM number to be ported from the initial operator to other number holder operators. You can find more information and further parties involved in the ENUM ecosystem in RFC 4725.

It once housed a car factory built by Italian automotive company Fiat and today houses the administrative headquarters of the manufacturer and a multipurpose centre projected by architect Renzo Piano.  History  View of Lingotto, with the test track on the roof, in 1928. Spiral roadway to move cars up to a higher level of the former Fiat Lingotto factory in Turin Construction of the building started in 1916 and it was inaugurated in 1923. The design by the young architect Giacomo Matt√©-Trucco, was unusual in that it had five floors, with raw materials going in at the ground floor, and cars built on a line that went up through the building. Finished cars emerged at rooftop level to go onto the test track. The construction was carried out by the company of G A Porcheddu. It was the largest car factory in the world at that time. For its time, the Lingotto building was avant-garde, influential and impressive--Le Corbusier called it \\"one of the most impressive sights in industry\\", and \\"a guideline for town planning\\". 80 different models of car were produced there in its lifetime, including the Fiat Topolino of 1936. By the late 1970s, the factory had become obsolete, and a decision was made to finally close it in 1982. The closure of the plant led to much public debate about its future, and how to recover from industrial decline in general. An architectural competition was held, which was eventually awarded to Renzo Piano, who envisioned an exciting public space for the city. The old factory was restored into a modern complex, with concert halls, theatre, a convention centre, shopping arcades and a hotel. The eastern portion of the building is the headquarters of the Automotive Engineering faculty of the Polytechnic University of Turin. The work was completed in 1989. The track was retained, and can still be visited today on the top floor of the shopping mall and hotel. Similar rooftop tests tracks exist, including; at Imperia in Nessonvaux in Belgium, and Palacio Chrysler in Buenos Aires, Argentina. From 1928 to 1958, Imperia had a track over 1 km long which was built partially on top of the factory. Lingotto public transport Torino Lingotto railway station is served by a number of regional train lines, as well as the Turin Metro (Lingotto M1). It is a central hub, located close to Turin's hospitals (such as CTO Hospital (Turin)), parks (Castello Valentino) and the Lingotto shopping district. The Lingotto M1 metro station was officially opened on March 6, 2011, connecting Lingotto with Porta Nuova M1 and other destinations. In popular culture The Lingotto building is featured extensively in the Alberto Lattuada film Mafioso (1962). The original Lingotto rooftop test track features briefly in the getaway sequence in the film The Italian Job (1969). Lingotto is the site of the Oval Lingotto, the speed skating venue for the 2006 Winter Olympics. The building is also featured in the fourth episode of the 20th season of The Amazing Race, originally aired in the US on March 11, 2012. The Building and test track was featured on the first episode of James May's Cars of the People.

Born in Athens, Critias was the son of Callaeschrus and a first cousin of Plato's mother Perictione. He became a leading and violent member of the Thirty Tyrants. He also was an associate of Socrates, a fact that did not endear Socrates to the Athenian public. Critias was noted in his day for his tragedies, elegies and prose works. Some, like Sextus Empiricus, believe that Critias wrote the Sisyphus fragment; others, however, attribute it to Euripides. His only known play is Peirithous, of which only a single 42-line fragment survives (Sextus Empir. p. 403, 1). In addition, eight shorter quotations from unidentified plays have come down to us. Life Critias gave an account of his ancestry which was later recorded in Plato's Timaeus. Critias's great-grandfather, Dropidas, was an intimate friend of Solon. Dropidas's son, also named Critias, was the grandfather and namesake of the author Critias.Jowett, Benjamin (1892). The dialogues of Plato. Vol. II. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Timaeus. P.516-517. Critias: Then listen, Socrates, to a strange tale which is, however, certainly true, as Solon, who was the wisest of the seven sages, declared. He was a relative and a great friend of my great-grandfather, Dropidas, as he himself says in several of his poems; and Dropidas told Critias, my grandfather, who remembered and told us: That there were of old great and marvellous actions of the Athenians, which have passed into oblivion through time and the destruction of the human race, and one in particular, which was the greatest of them all [...] Critias was once a student of Socrates. The two had a strained relationship. However, it is said that Critias was the one who saved Socrates from persecution during the terror of the Thirty Tyrants.http://www.iep.utm.edu/critias/#H4 However, Critias was very greedy, something that Socrates did not approve of. After the fall of Athens to the Spartans, Critias, as one of the Thirty Tyrants, blacklisted many of its citizens. Most of his prisoners were executed and their wealth confiscated. Critias was killed in a battle near Piraeus, the port of Athens, between a band of pro-democracy Athenian exiles led by Thrasybulus and members and supporters of the Thirty, aided by the Spartan garrison. In the battle, the exiles put the oligarchic forces to flight, ending the rule of the Thirty.Buck, Thrasybulus and the Athenian Democracy, pp. 71‚Äì79Xenophon, Hellenica 2.4 According to Sextus Empiricus, Critias asserted that \\"a shrewd and clever-minded man invented for mortals a fear of the gods, so that there might be a deterrent for the wicked...\\" The text from which this excerpt originates is known both as the Critias fragment and the Sisyphus fragment as its origins are disputed. Most historians attribute the quotation to the character of Sisyphus in a play by Euripides. Plato's description Critias appears as a character in Plato's dialogues Charmides and Protagoras, and, according to Diogenes La√´rtius, was Plato's great- uncle.Diogenes La√´rtius, Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, III:1 In the Charmides, Plato implies that Critias' philosophy was that temperance was the art of \\"doing our own business.\\" Socrates spends the rest of the dialogue challenging this definition as vague and meaningless.http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/charmides.html The Critias character in Plato's dialogues Timaeus and Critias is often identified as the son of Callaeschrus ‚Äì but not by Plato. Given the old age of the Critias in these two dialogues, he may be the grandfather of the son of Callaeschrus. In popular culture * A generally unflattering portrait of Critias is provided in Mary Renault's historical novel The Last of the Wine, a retelling of Athens' last years in the Peloponnesian War and its immediate aftermath. * Likewise in Alessandro Barbero's historical novel Le Ateniesi, another tale set in the latter years of the Peloponnesian War.

Schabowski gained worldwide fame in November 1989 when he improvised a slightly mistaken answer to a press conference question, raising popular expectations much more rapidly than the government planned, so that massive crowds gathered the same night at the Berlin Wall, forcing its opening after 28 years; soon after, the entire inner German border was opened. Background Schabowski was born in Anklam, Pomerania (then in the Free State of Prussia, now part of the federal state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern). He studied journalism at the Karl Marx University, Leipzig, after which he became editor of the trade union magazine, Trib√ºne. In 1952, he became a member of the SED. From 1967 to 1968, he attended the party academy of the CPSU. In 1978, he became the chief editor of the newspaper Neues Deutschland (\\"New Germany\\"), which as the official organ of the SED was considered to be the leading newspaper in the GDR. In 1981, he became a member of the SED Central Committee. In 1985, after leaving Neues Deutschland, he became the First Secretary of the East Berlin chapter of the SED and a member of the SED Politb√ºro. He also served as member of the Volkskammer from 1981 to 1990. In 2009, writer Christa Wolf called Schabowski \\"one of the worst\\" East German politicians before the Wende, saying: \\"I remember a few appearances of him in front of the writer's guild. You were scared of him.\\"  Press conference: the opening of the Berlin Wall  G√ºnter Schabowski at the Alexanderplatz demonstration on 4 November 1989 The press conference on 9 November 1989 by G√ºnter Schabowski (seated on stage, second from right) and other East German officials which led to the Fall of the Wall. Riccardo Ehrman is sitting on the floor of the stage with the table just behind him. In October 1989, Schabowski, along with several other members of the Politb√ºro, turned on longtime SED leader Erich Honecker and forced him to step down in favor of Egon Krenz. As part of the effort to change the regime's image, Schabowski was named the regime's unofficial spokesman, and he held several daily press conferences to announce changes. He had already been in charge of media affairs for the Politb√ºro before then. He was also reportedly named the number-two man in the SED, Krenz's old role. Schabowski had spent most of his career in Communist-style journalism, in which reporters were told what to write after events had already happened. He thus found it somewhat difficult to get used to Western-style media practice.Sarotte, p. 115 On 9 November 1989, shortly before that day's press conference, Krenz handed Schabowski a texttext prepared by Gerhard Lauter: https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/25-jahre-deutsche-einheit/mauerfall- am-9-november-1989-und-im-uebrigen-die-grenze-ist-auf-12654876.html containing new, temporary travel regulations. The text stipulated that East German citizens could apply for permission to travel abroad without having to meet the previous requirements for those trips, and also allowed for permanent emigration between all border crossings‚Äîincluding those between East and West Berlin. The text was supposed to be embargoed until the next morning.Sarotte, pp. 107‚Äì108 Schabowski had not been on hand when Krenz read the text earlier in the day to several Politb√ºro members during a cigarette break at that day's Central Committee plenum, nor had he been there when it was discussed before the full committee. However, he felt comfortable discussing it at the press conference; he later said that all one needed to do in order to conduct a press conference was be able to speak German and read a text without mistakes. Accordingly, he read the note aloud at the end of the press conference. One of the reporters asked when the regulations would come into effect. Schabowski assumed it would be the same day based on the wording of the note, and replied after a few seconds' pause: \\"As far as I know ‚Äî effective immediately, without delay.\\" () Accounts differ on who asked that question. Both Riccardo Ehrman, the Berlin correspondent of the ANSA news agency, and German Bild Zeitung (a tabloid) reporter Peter Brinkmann were sitting on the front row at the press conference, and claimed to have asked when the regulations would come into force.Walker, Marcus (Oct 21, 2009) \\"Did Brinkmannship Fell Berlin's Wall? Brinkmann Says It Did\\" The Wall Street Journal.You Tube Later, when asked whether the new regulations also applied to travel between East and West Berlin, Schabowski looked at the text again and discovered that they did. When Daniel Johnson of The Daily Telegraph asked what that meant for the Berlin Wall, Schabowski sat frozen before giving a rambling statement about the Wall being tied to the larger disarmament question.Sarotte, p. 118 After the press conference, Schabowski sat down for a live interview with NBC's Tom Brokaw. When Brokaw asked him if it was indeed true that East Germans could now travel without having to go through a third country, Schabowski replied in broken English that East Germans were \\"not further forced to leave GDR by transit through another country,\\" and could now \\"go through the border.\\" When Brokaw asked if this meant \\"freedom of travel,\\" Schabowski replied, \\"Yes of course,\\" and added that it was not \\"a question of tourism,\\" but \\"a permission of leaving GDR.\\"Sarotte, p. 129. The West German public national television channels showed parts of Schabowski's press conference in their main evening news reports at 7:17 PM on ZDF's heute and at 8 PM on ARD's Tagesschau; this meant that the news was broadcast to nearly all of East Germany, where West German television was widely watched, as well. The news then spread like wildfire with news reports continuing to repeat the news throughout the night. As the night progressed, thousands of East Berliners began proceeding to the six border crossings along the Berlin Wall. They demanded to be let through. Live TV reported on the gathering people which only increased the numbers of East Berliners coming to the gates. The crowds vastly outnumbered the border guards who initially tried to stall for time. However, no one was willing to order deadly force. Finally, at 11:30 pm, Stasi officer Harald J√§ger decided to open the gates at the Bornholmer Stra√üe border crossing and allow people into West Berlin. The fall of the Berlin Wall was the key event leading to the end of the East German regime, a state that had been crumbling for many weeks as citizens had been fleeing through intermediate countries surrounding East Germany. Indeed, Victor Sebestyen later wrote that when the gates were opened, for all intents and purposes, East Germany \\"ceased to exist.\\" He also wrote that many of Schabowski's colleagues suspected he was either an American or West German agent, and could not believe that he had made \\"a simple cock-up.\\" In 2014, his wife claimed that Schabowski had been well aware of the possible consequences of what he said in the press conference. In the following purges of the \\"party's old guard\\", Schabowski was quickly expelled from the Party of Democratic Socialism (successor to the SED), in an attempt to improve the party's image. Just months earlier, he had been awarded the country's prestigious Order of Karl Marx. Political life after reunification Schabowski in 2007 G√ºnter Schabowski's gravestone in Waldfriedhof Dahlem After German Reunification, Schabowski became highly critical of his own actions in the GDR and those of his fellow Politb√ºro members, as well as of Soviet-style socialism in general. He worked again as a journalist and, between 1992 and 1999, as editor for Heimat-Nachrichten, a weekly local paper that he co- founded with a West German journalist in Rotenburg an der Fulda. His campaign help for the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) prompted some of his former comrades to call him a wryneck (German term: Wendehals; a bird that can turn its head almost 180 degrees; popular term used to mock Communists who have turned capitalist). Together with other leading figures of the GDR regime, he was charged with the murders of East Germans attempting to flee the GDR. In January 1995, the Berlin prosecutors pressed charges against him. In August 1997, Schabowski was convicted along with Egon Krenz and G√ºnther Kleiber. Because he accepted his moral guilt and denounced the GDR, he was sentenced to only three years in prison. In December 1999, he began serving his sentence in Hakenfelde Prison in Spandau. However, in September 2000, he was pardoned by Governing Mayor Eberhard Diepgen and released in December 2000, having served only a year. He was critical of the PDS/Left Party (i.e., successor of the Socialist Unity Party); in 2001, he collaborated with B√§rbel Bohley as advisor of Frank Steffel (CDU). Death According to his wife, Schabowski resided in a Berlin nursing home during the last years of his life, after a number of heart attacks and strokes. He died in Berlin after a long illness on the morning of 1 November 2015, aged 86.

Upon Lysander's request, the Thirty were elected as a tyranical government, not just as a legislative committee.Krentz, Peter. The Thirty at Athens p. 50 (hardcover ) The Thirty Tyrants maintained power for eight months. Although brief, their reign resulted in the killing of 5% of the Athenian population, the confiscation of citizens' property, and the exile of other democratic supporters.Wolpert, Andrew.

The two leading members were Critias and Theramenes.Xenophon, Hellenica, 2.3.15‚Äì16 The rule of the Thirty With Spartan support, the Thirty established an interim government in Athens. The Thirty were concerned with the revision if not erasure of democratic laws inscribed on the wall next to the Stoa Basileios. Consequently, the Thirty reduced the rights of Athenian citizens in order to institute an oligarchical regime. The Thirty appointed a council of 500 to serve the judicial functions formerly belonging to all the citizens.Aristotle, Athenian Constitution, 35.1 (350 BCE). However, not all Athenian men had their rights removed. In fact, the Thirty chose 3,000 Athenian men \\"to share in the government\\".Krentz, The Thirty at Athens. p. 64 These hand-selected individuals had the right to carry weapons, to have a jury trial, and to reside within city limits.Xenophon, Hellenica, 3.4.1 The list of the selected 3,000 was consistently revised. Although little is known about these 3,000 men ‚Äí for a complete record was never documented ‚Äí it is hypothesised that the Thirty appointed these select few as the only men the Thirty could find who were devotedly loyal to their regime.Krentz, The Thirty at Athens. p. 65 Led by Critias, the Thirty Tyrants presided over a reign of terror in which they executed, murdered, and exiled hundreds of Athenians, seizing their possessions afterward. Both Isocrates and Aristotle (the latter in the Athenian Constitution) have reported that the Thirty executed 1500 people without trial.Nails, Debra. The People of Plato: A Prosopography of Plato and Other Socratics. Hackett Publishing, 2002. Critias, a former pupil of Socrates, has been described as \\"the first Robespierre\\"Stone, I.F. The Trial of Socrates. Anchor Books, reprinted edition 1989. because of his cruelty and inhumanity; he evidently aimed to end democracy, regardless of the human cost.Linder, 2002, p. 213 The Thirty removed criminals as well as many ordinary citizens whom they considered \\"unfriendly\\" to the new regime for expressing support for the democracy. One of their targets was one of their own, Theramenes, whom Xenophon depicts as revolted by Critias' excessive violence and injustice and trying to oppose him. Critias accused Theramenes of conspiracy and treason, and then forced him to drink hemlock.Xenophon, Hellenica, 2.3.56 Many wealthy citizens were executed simply so the oligarchs could confiscate their assets, which were then distributed among the Thirty and their supporters.Xenophon Hellenica 2.4.1 They also hired 300 \\"lash- bearers\\" or whip-bearing men to intimidate Athenian citizens. The Thirty's regime did not meet with much overt opposition, although many Athenians disliked the new form of government. Those who did not approve of the new laws could either fight ‚Äí risking exile or execution ‚Äí or accept the Thirty's rule.Krentz, The Thirty at Athens. p. 69 Some supporters of democracy chose to fight and were exiled, among them Thrasybulus, a trierarch in the Athenian navy and noted supporter of democratic government. The uprising that overthrew the Thirty in 403 BCE was orchestrated by a group of exiles led by Thrasybulus. Critias was killed in the fighting at the doors of Athens.Xenophon, Hellenica, 3.4.19.  Aftermath  The Thirty Tyrants' brief reign was marred by violence and corruption. Historians have argued that the violence and brutality the Thirty carried out in Athens was necessary to transition Athens from a democracy to an oligarchy.Lewis, Sian. Ancient Tyranny, p. 213. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006. Print. (Hardcover, ) However, the more violent the Thirty's regime became, the more opposition they faced. The increased level of opposition ultimately led to the overthrow of the Thirty's regime by Thrasybulus' rebel forces. After the revolution, Athens needed to decide the best way to govern the liberated city- state and to reconcile the atrocities committed by the Thirty. It was decided to give amnesty to all of the members of the selected 3,000, except for the Thirty themselves, the Eleven (a group of prison magistrates appointed by lot who reported directly to the Thirty), and the ten who ruled in Piraeus.Xenophon, Hellenica, 2.4.38 After the revolution that overthrew the Thirty Tyrants, Athens and its citizens struggled to reconcile and rebuild.  Mention of the Thirty  Plato, in the opening portion of his Seventh Letter, recounts the rule of the Thirty Tyrants during his youth. He explains that following the revolution, fifty-one men became rulers of a new government, with a specific group of thirty in charge of the public affairs of Athens. Ten of the fifty-one were to rule the city, and eleven were sent to rule Piraeus. Plato corroborates the general consensus found in other sources: the rule of the Thirty was \\"reviled as it was by many\\". The rule of the Thirty made the former democracy resemble a golden age in comparison. Plato also includes an account of the interaction between Socrates and the Thirty.Seventh Letter of Plato In The Republic, Plato mentions Lysias, one of the men from Athens who escaped the Thirty's reign of terror. Lysias' brother Polemarchus \\"fell victim to the Thirty Tyrants\\".Plato, The Republic Socrates and the Thirty Due to their desire to remain in complete control over Athens, the Thirty sought to exile or kill anyone who outwardly opposed their regime. Socrates remained in the city through this period, which caused the public to associate him with the Thirty and may have contributed to his eventual death sentence, especially since Critias had been his student. In Plato's Apology, Socrates recounts an incident in which the Thirty once ordered him (and four other men) to bring before them Leon of Salamis, a man known for his justice and upright character, for execution. While the other four men obeyed, Socrates refused, not wanting to partake in the guilt of the executioners. However, he did not attempt to warn or save Leon of Salamis. By disobeying, Socrates may have been placing his own life in jeopardy, and he claimed it was only the disbanding of the oligarchy soon afterward that saved his life: > \\"When the oligarchy came into power, the Thirty Commissioners in their turn > summoned me and four others to the Round Chamber and instructed us to go and > fetch Leon of Salamis from his home for execution. This was of course only > one of many instances in which they issued such instructions, their object > being to implicate as many people as possible in their crimes. On this > occasion, however, I again made it clear, not by my words but by my actions, > that the attention I paid to death was zero (if that is not too unrefined a > claim); but that I gave all my attention to avoiding doing anything unjust > or unholy. Powerful as it was, that government did not terrify me into doing > a wrong action. When we came out of the rotunda, the other four went to > Salamis and arrested Leon, but I simply went home.\\"Plato, Apology 32c-d Later on in his Seventh Letter, Plato describes the interaction between the Thirty and Socrates from his own point of view: > \\"They tried to send a friend of mine, the aged Socrates, whom I should > scarcely scruple to describe as the most upright man of that day, with some > other persons to carry off one of the citizens by force to execution, in > order that, whether he wished it, or not, he might share the guilt of their > conduct; but he would not obey them, risking all consequences in preference > to becoming a partner in their iniquitous deeds.\\" The Italian historian Luciano Canfora has inferred that another of Socrates' students, Xenophon, might have played an important part in the rule of the Thirty, as one of the two commanders of the cavalry, which were the Thirty's militia. Indeed, in his book Hipparchos (Commander of the cavalry), Xenophon mentions just one of the commanders (there were always two), only to revile him, while never mentioning the other.Luciano Canfora Storie di Oligarchi In his Memorabilia (Bk 1, Ch 2), Xenophon reports a contentious confrontation between Socrates and the Thirty, Critias included. Socrates is summoned before the group and ordered not to instruct or speak to anyone, whereupon Socrates mocks the order by asking sarcastically whether he will be allowed to ask to buy food in the marketplace. Xenophon uses the episode to illustrate both Socrates' own critique of the slaughtering of Athenian citizens by the Thirty, as well as make the case that the relationship between Critias and Socrates had significantly deteriorated by the time Critias obtained power.

For an overview of spoliation, see generally Michael Zuckerman, Yes, I Destroyed the Evidence -- Sue Me?, Journal of Computer and Information Law Spoliation has three possible consequences: in jurisdictions where the (intentional) act is criminal by statute, it may result in fines and incarceration (if convicted in a separate criminal proceeding) for the parties who engaged in the spoliation; in jurisdictions where relevant case law precedent has been established, proceedings possibly altered by spoliation may be interpreted under a spoliation inference, or by other corrective measures, depending on the jurisdiction; in some jurisdictions the act of spoliation can itself be an actionable tort. The spoliation inference is a negative evidentiary inference that a finder of fact can draw from a party's destruction of a document or thing that is relevant to an ongoing or reasonably foreseeable civil or criminal proceeding: the finder of fact can review all evidence uncovered in as strong a light as possible against the spoliator and in favor of the opposing party. However, in U.S. federal courts, updates to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 2015 have resulted in significant decline in spoliation sanctions. Theory The theory of the spoliation inference is that when a party destroys evidence, it may be reasonable to infer that the party had \\"consciousness of guilt\\" or other motivation to avoid the evidence. Therefore, the factfinder may conclude that the evidence would have been unfavorable to the spoliator. Some jurisdictions have recognized a spoliation tort action, which allows the victim of destruction of evidence to file a separate tort action against a spoliator. While spoliation of evidence most often shows up in civil cases with allegations that the defendant allowed videos, photos or physical evidence to be destroyed, spoliation is also an issue where a person claims he has been injured by a defective product which he then discarded or lost. In that circumstance, the defendant manufacturer or distributor may move to dismiss the case on the basis of spoliation (instead of just having to rely on the plaintiff's usual burden of proof, the argument being that any testimony of plaintiff's witnesses would not overcome the spoliation inference born of the lost evidentiary value of the missing product itself). Finally, some states have case law or code sections allowing parties to recover civil damages for the act of spoliation itself. Some states only allow it against third parties, where an insurance company allows a car involved in litigation to be crushed for example. Each state handles the issue in their own manner and case law is constantly evolving. Brookshire Brothers Ltd. v. Aldridge The use of a spoliation inference may be warranted depending on the circumstances, but not all cases of spoliation warrant this serious response by the court. In a 2013 case before the Texas Supreme Court named Brookshire Brothers Ltd. v. Aldridge, A man named Jerry Aldridge went into one of Brookshire Brothers' supermarkets, and after a few minutes in the store, slipped and fell. He went to a doctor approximately 90 minutes later, and returned to the store five days after the accident to complain of back injuries caused by the fall. The supermarket chain's security department only kept what it felt was the relevant part of that store's surveillance video consisting of just before to a few minutes after Mr. Aldridge slipped and fell. When he first filed suit against Brookshire Brothers without an attorney, Mr. Aldridge was able to get video evidence consisting of the 30 seconds before he slipped and fell, plus the next seven minutes. He attempted to obtain more of the store's video surveillance footage, but was refused. When he hired an attorney, the attorney was also unable to obtain footage from before or after the event (which might have been useful to prove negligence based on how long the spill was on the floor, or on the seriousness of Mr. Aldridge's injury). The store's surveillance system automatically writes over previously recorded video after 30 days, unless saved separately. Brookshire Brothers did not keep any additional footage from before or after the accident. The trial court judge found that the store's refusal to provide the additional video footage constituted spoliation, and gave the jury a \\"spoliation inference instruction\\". The jury was instructed that they may find the failure by the store to retain (and subsequently provide to the other party) the additional footage may be considered an attempt to hide evidence that Brookshire Brothers' management knew would be damaging to their case. The jury returned a verdict for Mr. Aldridge in excess of US $1 million. The Texas Twelfth District Court of Appeals upheld the verdict and the spoliation inference instruction. The Texas Supreme Court reversed, ordering a new trial, stating that it was abuse of discretion by the trial court to issue a spoliation inference instruction in this case, that the court should have imposed a different corrective measure on Brookshire Brothers (a less severe sanction), and that a spoliation inference instruction to the jury is only warranted in egregious cases of destruction of relevant evidence.Brookshire Brothers v. Aldridge, 10-0846, (retrieved 11 December 2014) Tampering with evidence A closely related concept to spoliation of evidence is tampering with evidence, which is usually the criminal-law version of the same concept, namely when a person alters, conceals, falsifies, or destroys evidence in an investigation by law enforcement or by a regulatory authority. An act of ruining or destroying evidence may sometimes be considered both spoliation of evidence and tampering with evidence. For example, when police destroy their own dashboard-camera footage or seize and destroy a citizen's video footage of an incident, it may constitute spoliation of evidence in a criminal case against the defendant if the footage tended to create reasonable doubt for the defendant, and also constitute tampering if the video were evidence of police misconduct in a criminal or regulatory investigation of the police's actions. The goal of spoliating or tampering with evidence is usually to cover up evidence that would be disfavorable to the doer in some way. Spoliation of evidence is often important in e-discovery matters, as oftentimes records in electronic form such as SMS messages may be difficult to retrieve, preserve, or monitor. Companies and organizations often attempt to avoid spoliation of evidence (or being accused or held liable therewith) by using a legal hold. Often, the legal departments of the company or organization will issue a prescribed order to the relevant employees to retain and preserve their discoverable materials (such as e-mails and documents).

The game released in 1985, Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?, started off both the video game series and the franchise as a whole, which has continued up to the present day. Each game of the series has a particular theme and subject, where the player must use their knowledge to find Carmen Sandiego or any of her innumerable henchmen. This series was originally owned by Broderbund, but is now owned by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Since its initial release the series has won over 125 awards and accolades.  Design  = Gameplay = The first game in the series released in 1985, Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?, was designed and written by Gene Portwood and Lauren Elliott, and programmed by Dane Bingham. It established an original formula that was followed very faithfully in all Carmen Sandiego games. This formula involves a series of missions in which the computer player tracks and apprehends each of Carmen Sandiego's underlings. Each case begins with the player being alerted that a spectacular theft has been committed. Immediately transported to the scene of the crime, the player must find clues to infer the suspect's next destination and to create an arrest warrant describing the guilty party's attributes. The culprit travels through a series of different destinations in an attempt to shake off any pursuers, so the player will have to continue tracking the thief for some time. The game continues in this manner until the player catches up with the culprit, at which point the thief is arrested, and if the warrant is correct, the player puts the thief in ACME prison. As more and more thieves are arrested, the player rises up through ACME's ranks, and the later cases assigned to the player will become more difficult. On the final case, the perpetrator is revealed to be Carmen Sandiego herself, and the game ends after the player successfully captures her and is inducted into the ACME Hall of Fame. With the release of Word Detective, Math Detective, and Great Chase Through Time, Broderbund began to abandon the original formula in 1997. Word Detective and Math Detective involves the player infiltrating V.I.L.E. hideouts around the world and therefore maintain the globe-hopping element of previous games. However, Great Chase Through Time completely abandoned the series' original formula and has the player spending each mission in one time period, where the goal is to create makeshift solutions to any historical problems that the theft has caused and find the thief whom Carmen Sandiego has dropped off. The final mission of the game involves the player to track down Carmen Sandiego similar to the traditional formula, although the player does not construct a warrant. =Name= The character of Carmen Sandiego was developed by David Siefkin, who drafted the first script of the game for Broderbund beside the Strawberry Canyon swimming pool of the University of California at Berkeley in 1984. Siefkin combined the character's first and last names from the Brazilian singer and actress Carmen Miranda and the city of San Diego, California. Carmen Sandiego was just one of several villains in the original script. She was chosen for the title role by the early project manager Katherine Bird because her name suggested mystery and exoticism, as well as humor. Siefkin departed the project shortly after writing the first script to become a Foreign Service Officer for the U.S. State Department, and served as a press and cultural attach√© in several of the countries featured in the game. = Style of humor = The games created by Broderbund featured silly humor with a distinctive style of word play with extensive use of puns, rhymes, and alliteration. This style of word play was also present, in varying degrees, in all three Carmen Sandiego television shows. Gag names (\\"Hardley Worthit\\", \\"Rob M. Blind\\", \\"Ruth Less\\", \\"Joy Ryder\\", \\"M. T. Pockets\\", etc.) were quite frequently used in the games, often to the point where Carmen herself seemed to be the only person without such a name. Clues about the suspect's next destination often used extended puns (example: \\"I pumped her for information, but her unrefined answer only suggested a crude plan to visit oil wells near Ahvaz.\\") or rhyming couplets. Even as the games began to abandon their original formula, this word play was still retained. For example, a news report on massive blackouts from Carmen Sandiego Math Detective quotes an official as saying, \\"We're taking a dim view of the situation.\\" Although Carmen's V.I.L.E. gang members were often portrayed as cartoonish buffoons, they seemed to be capable of \\"stealing\\" landmarks, cities, national parks, notable cultural exports (such as \\"stealing all the sushi from Japan\\") and the like. Her thieves have also been known to steal geographic features and even nonexistent map features such as the Mason‚ÄìDixon line. Some thefts were even non sequiturs based on word play, such as \\"robbing the banks of the Nile,\\" or plays on the word \\"steal\\" such as \\"stealing the show.\\" List of Carmen Sandiego characters  Video games by Broderbund  =Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (1985, 1996)= The original version was released in 1985. The goal of this game is to track Carmen's villains around the world and arrest them and later ultimately arrest Carmen herself. In order to make an arrest the user had to have a warrant for the correct villain. The player began the game by visiting the city and country where the crime took place, and then obtaining hints from the bystanders on where the thief went next, leading them on a chase around the world to find the thief before they \\"get away.\\" In the process, the player collected clues about the villain‚Äôs identity to determine who the culprit is. When the player reached their final destination, the player presented the accurate warrant to arrest the villain. The deluxe version was released in 1992 and featured additional animation and a reworked interface. Sarah Nade was added to this version of Carmen Sandiego Software. CD-ROM versions for DOS and Macintosh were released in 1993, and a Windows version was released in 1994. The Windows version was later re-released as Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? Classic Edition. The reboot version was released in 1996 with a new gameplay interface and animated characters. This version features QuickTime videos of Lynne Thigpen reprising her role as \\"The Chief\\" from the eponymous PBS game show, a role she would also play in the U.S.A. and Time reboot games released during that same period. =Where in the U.S.A. Is Carmen Sandiego? (1986, 1996)= This title was released in 1986. Similar to World, the goal of this game is to track Carmen's villains around the United States, and arrest them and later ultimately arrest Carmen herself. In order to make an arrest, the user must have a warrant and, obviously, it has to be the correct warrant. The user gets information from the bystanders on where the thief went next and what the thief looks like. When the user reaches his/her final destination where the villain is going to pass off the loot to Carmen, he/she have to arrest them. =Where in Europe Is Carmen Sandiego? (1988)= Title card for Where in Europe Is Carmen Sandiego? \\"Where in Europe Is Carmen Sandiego?\\" is one of the many games in the Carmen Sandiego series. It focuses on the European history and geography. The gameplay is very similar to that of \\"Where in the World\\", meaning that the player is sent to a location, has to find clues to lead them to the next location, and builds up a warrant along the way. This was the first of the games to have a database built into the crime computer, where players could narrow down their next stop by entering information such as flag colors, currency used, and languages mentioned. Production of the game was discontinued in 1990 due to the fall of the Eastern Bloc and drastic border and government changes that resulted. =Where in North Dakota Is Carmen Sandiego?= =Where in Time Is Carmen Sandiego? (1989, 1997)= The original version was released in 1989. The goal of this game is to track Carmen's villains through history and arrest them and later ultimately capture Carmen herself. The reboot version was released in 1997 and later renamed Carmen Sandiego's Great Chase Through Time. This version was heavily influenced by and features villains from the short-lived PBS game show. = Carmen Sandiego in Japan = =Where in America's Past Is Carmen Sandiego? (1991)= This game is widely considered the most informational game of the entire series. Though it may contain some minute differences from the main series, it remains true to it. This game's aim is to capture Carmen's gang of thieves, one by one until all of her henchmen have been caught. This is done by searching for clues, trailing them, identifying them and finally, bringing them in for trial. After all of the henchmen have been caught, the player must then go after Carmen herself. One of the main differences is that the player can receive in-game help. =Where in Space Is Carmen Sandiego? (1993)= Asking a witness for clues in Where in Space Is Carmen Sandiego? The intention of this game is to teach astronomy. The player flies in a rocket ship throughout the solar system, interrogating various alien lifeforms in order to solve the theft of an important part of the solar system (e.g. Saturn's rings). There was only a limited amount of fuel available for travel. So if the player did not ask the right questions on the right planets, or followed the wrong clues, the criminal(s) would get away, leaving the player to start anew with another crime. This version is somewhat similar to Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?. Kneemoi was introduced in this installment. =Junior Detective Edition (1995)= This title was released in 1995 and features characters from the Earth animated series. It uses a simplified version of the standard gameplay designed for younger players. =Carmen Sandiego Word Detective (1997)= This title was released in 1997. This game is intended to teach language arts for kids age 9-12. The game features Chase Devineaux. In the game Carmen Sandiego has invented a machine called the Babble-On Machine, and the user, playing the role of Agent 13, has to thwart her plans and free all the other agents that have been captured by Carmen. The game is very similar to Carmen Sandiego Math Detective. =Carmen Sandiego Math Detective (1998)= This title was released in 1998. This game is intended to teach Math for kids age 9-12. The game features Chase Devineaux. In the game, Carmen Sandiego has invented a machine called the Quantum Crystallizer, and the user, playing the role of Agent 9, has to thwart her plans and restore 12 landmarks that Carmen has shrunk with the machine. The game is very similar to Carmen Sandiego Word Detective. The Learning Company video games =Carmen Sandiego's ThinkQuick Challenge= This game teaches multiple subjects for kids ages 9‚Äì12. It was also the first title in the Carmen Sandiego series to be released by The Learning Company. The game features Chase Devineaux. In the game, Carmen Sandiego has invented KnowBots to steal knowledge and the player(s) have to try and thwart her plans. This game is set up much like the Carmen Sandiego game shows on PBS and is the only multiplayer game of the series. =Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? Treasures of Knowledge= This game was released in 2001. =Carmen Sandiego: The Secret of the Stolen Drums= This game, released in 2004, is the first in the series to give the player complete control of a character in a 3-dimensional world.

The date of release is unknown. =The ClueFinders: Mystery Mansion Arcade= This title was released in 2002. The game starts with the ClueFinders proceeding to walk towards a creepy house on a hill, with the dialogue explaining that the ClueFinders received an email from who they thought was Joni's Uncle Horace, stating that he was trapped in the house and needed to be rescued. It is revealed that it is actually a trap, however, and the four ClueFinders are separated. It is then shown to the user that four past ClueFinders enemies have joined forces with a mysterious new ally and created the trap to get revenge on the ClueFinders. At the game's conclusion, seeing that ClueFinders have outsmarted the villains again, their leader sends the villains into their own traps as punishment for failing. Afterward, she reveals herself to be Carmen Sandiego. Before anybody can do anything, Carmen escapes and leaves the ClueFinders.

The creator of the game had never played a Carmen Sandiego game, but was very familiar of the franchise due to its constant appearance in gaming magazines. He crafted a first person adventure game based on this premise and copied the naming scheme of the titles. The beginning of the plot is as follows: \\"You are a famous crimebuster hot on the trail of that world-renowned thief, Carmen Santiago (sic), and her latest gang. The rumors that she had died in a bizarre accident don't deter you; after all, it might just be misdirection.

It broke into revolt against the authority of the Caliph Ali after he agreed to arbitration with his rival, Muawiyah I, to decide the succession to the Caliphate following the Battle of Siffin (657). A Kharijite later assassinated Ali, and for hundreds of years, the Khawarij were a source of insurrection against the Caliphate. The Khawarij opposed arbitration as a means to choose a new ruler on the grounds that \\"judgement belongs to God alone\\". They considered arbitration a means for people to make decisions while the victor in a battle was determined by God. They believed that any Muslim‚Äîeven one who was not a Quraysh or even an Arab‚Äîcould be the Imam, the leader of the community, if he was morally irreproachable. If the leader sinned, it was the duty of Muslims to oppose and depose him. The only surviving sect of Khawarij are the Ibadis. Etymology The term al-Khariji was used as an exonym by their opponents from the fact that they left Ali's army. The name comes from the Arabic root , which has the primary meaning \\"to leave\\" or \\"to get out\\", as in the basic word \\"to go out\\". However, the group called themselves ash-Shurat \\"the Exchangers\\", which they understood within the context of Islamic scripture () and philosophy to mean \\"those who have traded the mortal life (al-Dunya) for the other life [with God] (al-Akhirah)\\". Origin The Kharijites originated during the First Fitna, the struggle for political leadership over the Muslim community, following the assassination in 656 of the third caliph Uthman. Ali, a cousin and son-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, was elected caliph but soon had to face with opposition, first from Talha ibn Ubayd Allah, Zubayr ibn al-Awam and Muhammad's widow A'isha, whom he was able to defeat (November 656), and later from Mu'awiya, the governor of Syria and cousin of Uthman. Ali and Muwaiya faced each other at the Battle of Siffin in July 657. On the verge of defeat, Mu'awiya ordered his soldiers to hoist Qur'an on their lances; a signal to stop the fight and negotiate peace. The pious group of Qur'an readers (Qura) in Ali's army were moved by the gesture, which they interpreted as an appeal to the Book of God, and demanded that Ali stop the fight immediately. Although unwilling, he had to yield under pressure and threats of violence against him. An arbitration committee was setup with representatives from both Ali and Mu'awiya's side with a mandate to settle the dispute in the light of the Qur'an. While most of Ali's army accepted the agreement, one group, mostly from the tribe of Tamim, vehemently objected to the arbitration and raised the slogan \\"judgment belongs to God alone\\". =Harura= As Ali marched back to Kufa, his capital, resentment against the arbitration became widespread in his army. Some 12,000 dissenters seceded from the army and went to a place called Harura. They thus became known as the Harurites. They held that the third caliph Uthman had deserved his death because of his faults, and that Ali was the legitimate caliph, while Mu'awiya was a rebel. They believed that the Qur'an clearly stated that as a rebel Mu'awiya was not entitled to arbitration, but rather should be fought until he repented, pointing to the verse: They held that in agreeing to arbitration Ali committed the grave sin of rejecting God's judgment (hukm) and attempted to substitute human judgment for God's clear injunction, which prompted their motto \\"judgement belongs to God alone\\" (la hukma illa li-llah). From this expression, which they were the first to use as a motto, they became known as Muhakkima. They also believed that Muslims owe allegiance only to the Quran and the sunna of Muhammad, Abu Bakr, and Umar, and denied that the right to the imamate should be based on close kinship with Muhammad. Ali, after some time, visited the Harura camp and in order to win back their support argued that it was them who forced him to accept arbitration proposal despite his warnings against it. They acknowledged that they had sinned but argued that they had repented and asked Ali to do the same, which he did in very general and ambiguous terms. They subsequently offered back their allegiance to him and returned to Kufa on the condition that war against Mu'awiya be resumed within six months. =Nahrawan= The arbitration proceedings continued however and after a few months (March 658), when Ali refused to denounce the arbitration and sent his arbitration delegation headed by Abu Musa Ash'ari to carry out the talks, Kharijites denounced Ali's caliphate and elected Abd Allah ibn Wahb al-Rasibi their caliph. In order to avoid being detected, they moved out of Kufa in small groups and went to a place called Nahrawan on the east bank of Tigris. Some five hundred of their Basran comrades were informed and they too joined them in Nahrawan, amounting to a total of 4,000 men. Following this exodus, they were called as Khawarij. They declared Ali and his followers apostates and killed several people who did not share their views. In the meantime, arbitrators declared that Uthman had been killed unjustly by the rebels. Other than that, however, they could not agree on anything substantial and the process collapsed. Ali now denounced the arbitrators and called on his supporters for renewed war against Mu'awiya. He invited Kharijites to join him in war against Mu'awiya as before. They refused to do so unless he would acknowledge that he had gone astray and repent. Ali consequently decided to depart for Syria without them. On the way, however, he received news of the Kharijites' murdering various people, and was urged by his followers, who feared for their families and property in Kufa, to deal with the Kharijites first. Kharijites refused to surrender the murderers and consequently Ali's attacked them in their camp, inflicting a heavy defeat on them at the Battle of Nahrawan (July 658), killing Ibn Wahb and most of his supporters. Some 1200 of them, however, surrendered and were spared. This bloodshed sealed the split of Kharijites from Ali's followers, and Kharijite calls for revenge ultimately led to Ali's assassination in 661 by a Kharijite.  Later history  For hundreds of years the Khawarij continued to be a source of insurrection against the Caliphate. Five small Kharijite revolts, involving about 200 men each, following Nahrawan were defeated during the caliphate of Ali. Under Mu'awiya, Basra replaced Kufa as the center of Kharijite disturbance. His governors of Iraq Ziyad ibn Abihi and Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad dealt with Kharijites with a heavy-hand and sixteen Kharijite revolts, with rebel numbers in individual revolts varying between 30 to 500, were suppressed. From now on, they started the practice of raiding undefended towns in the neighborhoods of Basra in rapid cavalry attacks whereby they would seem to appear from nowhere, pillage the towns and disappear quickly before the government forces could respond. If pursued, they would flee into mountainous regions of Iran. In Basra, Ibn Ziyad is reported to have been particularly hard on them. He jailed any Kharijite whom he suspected of being dangerous and executed several Kharijite sympathizers who had publicly spoken against him. Ziyad and Ibn Ziyad are said to have killed thirteen thousand Kharijites in total. To avoid suppression, Basran Kharijites fled to Arabia around 680 CE. =Second Fitna= After the death of Mua'wiya in 680, the empire fell to civil war over the question of leadership. The people of Hejaz (where Mecca and Medina are located) rebelled against the new caliph Yazid. When Yazid sent an army to end the Hijazi rebellion in 683 and Mecca was besieged, Kharijites assisted Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, who was based in Mecca and opposed Yazid, in defending the city. However, Yazid died in November 683 and Ibn al-Zubayr proclaimed himself caliph. Kharijites, after discovering that Ibn al-Zubayr had proclaimed caliphate and did not share their view of Uthman and condemned his murder, abandoned him and went to Basra. In the meantime, Basran tribal chiefs expelled Ibn Ziyad and the city fell to tribal warfare. Kharijites took over the city, killed the deputy appointed by Ibn Ziyad and broke 140 of their comrades free from Ibn Ziyad's prison. Soon afterwards, Basrans recognized Ibn al-Zubayr and he appointed Abd Allah ibn Harith, more commonly known as Babba, his governor there. Babba drove Kharijites out of Basra and they escaped to Ahwaz. Doctrinal differences led to split between two of their leaders: Najda ibn Amir al-Hanafi and Nafi ibn al-Azraq. Najdat Najda, with his followers, moved to Yamama and the faction became known as Najdat. There he took over, in 685, another Kharijite faction led by a certain Abu Talut whose followers were impressed by Najda's leadership abilities and deposed Abu Talut to appoint Najda as their chief. Najda started raiding towns in Ibn al- Zuabyr's domains and soon extended his control to entire Yamama and Bahrain and defeated a 14,000 strong Zubayrid army that was sent against him. Thereafter he went on to seize Hadhramawt and Yemen in 687 and later captured Taif, a town close to Ibn al-Zubayr's capital Mecca. Ibn al-Zubayr was consequently cornered in Hejaz and Najda controlled much of Arabia. He was later deposed for being too soft and was subsequently executed in 691 by his own fellow Kharijites. Abu Fudayk took over the leadership and defeated several Zuabyrid and later Umayyad attacks. He was finally killed along with 6,000 followers in 692 by Umayyad forces in Bahrain and the Najdat faction came to an end. Azariqa From Ahwaz area, Ibn Azraq, after whom his band became known as the Azariqa, raided Basran suburbs. These are described in the sources to be most fanatic of all the Kharijite groups for they approved of the doctrine of Isti'rad: indiscriminate killing of non-Kharijite Muslims including their women and children. An army sent against them by the Zubayrid governor of Basra in early 685 defeated the Azariqa and Ibn Azraq was killed. However, they chose new Emir, regrouped and forced the Zubayrid army to retreat and ransacking resumed. After a few more defeats, Ibn al-Zubayr sent Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra against them. Muhallab defeated them at the battle of Sillabra in May 686 and killed their Emir. They subsequently retreated to Fars. However, in late 686, Muhallab had to discontinue his campaign against the Azariqa as he was sent against the pro-Alid Mukhtar and later appointed governor of Mosul to defend against possible Umayyad attack. Azariqa consequently returned to Iraq and attacked Mada'in, in the neighborhood of Kufa, ravaged the town and after pursuit fled again to Iran and besieged Isfahan. They were driven away and fled to Fars and latter to Kirman. However, they returned to Basra area soon afterwards and Muhallab had to be sent against them. For a long time, the Azariqa held Fars and Kirman although Muhallab prevented them from advancing to Iraq. In the meantime, Umayyads recaptured Iraq from the Zubayrids in 691. Umayyad princes took over the command from Muhallab but suffered severe defeats at the hands of the Azariqa. In 694 Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, a Thaqafite, was made governor of Iraq and he reinstated Muhallab to lead the fight against the Azariqa. After a series of attacks, he pushed them back into Kirman. There they split into two groups and were subsequently destroyed in 698-699. =Sufriyya= This sect of the Kharijtes is generally attributed to a man called Abd Allah ibn Saffar or Asfar, who broke away from Ibn Azraq due to the latter's radical ideology. Sufriyya are thus described to have been a milder variety of the Kharijites. However, modern historians consider Ibn Saffar to be a legendary figure and assert that the name Sufriyya derives from sufr al-wujuh (yellow-faced), an appellation applied to the earliest Kharijites because their faces turned grey from excessive prostrating. Basran Kharijite leader, Abu Bilal al-Mirdas, a moderated Kharijite, is counted among their Imams. In early 680s, when the Kharijite activities surged, those who preferred remaining inactive (qa'ad), as opposed to the activists Najdat and Azariqa, were called Sufriyya. A split within Sufriyya in 683-684 resulted in emergence of Ibadiyya. During the entire period of the Second Fitna, Sufriyya remained idle. However, in mid-690s they also started militant activities in response to persecution by Hajjaj. The first of their revolts was led in 695 by a certain Salih ibn Musarrih, which was defeated and Ibn Musarrih was killed. It was after his death, however, that they became a serious threat to Kufa and its suburbs. The group was taken over by Shabib ibn Yazid al-Shaybani. With a small army of a few hundred warriors, he defeated on multiple occasions (in 695 and 696) Umayyad armies several-thousands-strong, attacked Kufa once and later took possession of Mada'in. He now prepared to advance on Kufa once mroe. Hajjaj had already requested Syrian troops from the caliph Abd al-Malik who sent 4,000-strong army which succeeded in defeating Shabib just outside Kufa and he drowned during flight. His band was destroyed, but the Sufriyya continued to exist in the Mosul area. Late Umayyad period Although small Sufriyya insurrections continued, all of them from Mosul area, it was during the last days of the Umayyad empire that a major Sufriyya revolt erupted (744). It was at first led by a certain Said ibn Bahdal al-Shaybani, and after his death from plague, Dahhaq ibn Qays al-Shaybani. Joined by many more Sufriyya from other parts of the empire, he advanced to Kufa and captured it in April 745 and later captured Wasit after a short siege. At this stage even Umayyad officials, including two sons of former caliphs (Sulayman ibn Hisham and Abd Allah ibn Umar II), recognized him caliph and joined his ranks. Later he went on to capture Mosul but was killed by the forces of the Umayyad caliph Marwan II in 746. His successor Shayban ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Yashkuri was driven out from Mosul by Marwan II and fled to Fars to join the Shi'ite leader Abd Allah ibn Mu'awiya, who ruled there in opposition to the Umayyads. Attacked there by the Umayyads, they dispersed and Shayban fled to Oman where he was killed by the local leaders around 751. By the mid 8th century, Kharijites, mainly Sufriyya, appeared in North Africa. They were mostly of Berber origin who were recruited through missionary activity. Around 740, Sufriyya under the leadership of Maysara al-Matghari revolted in Tangiers and captured the city from the Umayyads. Defeating Umayyad armies, they marched onto the capital Kairouan although were not able to capture it.Nevertheless, Sufriya disturbances in North Africa continued throughout the Umayyad period. Abbasid period Under the Abbasids, Sufriyya revolts in eastern parts of the empire continued for almost two centuries although at small scale and were easily put down. However, revolts led by Abd al-Hamid al-Bajali in 866‚Äì877 and by Harun ibn Abd Allah Bajali in 880‚Äì896 seized control of northern Mesopotemia from the Abbasids for a while and collected taxes. In North Africa, Sufriyya revolts continued for some time but were later replaced by the Ibadiyya into whom the remnants of the Sufriyya were later absorbed around 10th or 11th century. =Ibadiyya= This sect is attributed to Abd Allah ibn Ibad (or Abad), who like Ibn Saffar, is supposed to have been a moderate Kharijite and having disagreed with and separated from the more extreme Azariqa and Najdat during the Second Fitna. However, some historians, as discussed above, believe that all quietist Kharijites in the early 680s were called Sufriyya and the Ibadis later broke away from them. Ibn Ibad is said to have been the leader of the Basran moderates after the death of Abu Bilal. Ibn Ibad, or his successor Jabir ibn Zayd, was in communication with caliph Abd al-Malik and Jabir had friendly relations with Hajjaj, the governor of Iraq. Jabir, a respected scholar and traditionist, is considered as the real organizer of the Ibadiyya sect. Following the death of Abd al-Malik, the relations between Ibadiyya leaders and Hajjaj deteriorated as the former became inclined towards activism (khuruj). He consequently exiled some of them to Oman and imprisoned others. One of the imprisoned, Abu Ubayda Muslim ibn Abi Karima, who was released after the death of Hajjaj in 714, became next leader of the Ibadiyya. He at first attempted to win over the Umayyad caliphs to the Ibadi doctrine but was unsuccessful. He then sent missionaries to propagate the doctrine in different parts of the empire including Oman, Yemen, Hadramawt, Khurasan and North Africa. During the final years of the Umayyad caliphate, the Ibadi propaganda movement caused several revolts in the periphery of the empire, although the leaders in Basra adopted the policy of kitman, concealing beliefs so as to avoid persecution. Southern and eastern Arabia In 745, Abd Allah ibn Yahya al-Kindi established the first Ibadi state in Hadramawt and captured Yemen in 746. His lieutenant Abu Hamza Mukhtar ibn Aws al-Azdi later conquered Mecca and Medina. Umayyads defeated and killed Abu Hamza and Ibn Yahya in 648 and the first Ibadi state collapsed. The majority of the Omani population had converted to Ibadism by the end of the 7th century as a result of missionary activity initiated by Abu Ubayda. An Ibadi state was established in Oman in 750 after the fall of Abu Yahya but fell to the Abassids in 752. It was followed by the establishment of another Ibadi state in 793, but collapsed after the Abbasid recapture of Oman in 893. Abbasid influence was only nominal though and Ibadi Imams continued to wield considerable power and Ibadi Imamates were reestablished in subsequent centuries. Ibadis form the majority of the Omani population to date. Africa and elsewhere Ibadi missionary activity met with considerable success in North Africa. In 757 Ibadis seized Tripoli and captured Kairouan the next year. Driven out by the Abbasid army in 761, Ibadi leaders founded state in Tahart. It was overthrown in 909 by the Fatimids. Ibadi communities continue to exist in the Nafusa Mountains in northwestern Libya, Djerba island in Tunisia and M'zab valley in Algeria. In East Africa they are found in Zanzibar. Ibadi missionary activity also reached Persia, India, Egypt, Sudan, Spain and Sicily, although Ibadis communities in these regions ceased to exist. Beliefs and practices The earliest Kharijites held that any Muslim of whatever descent could become a caliph if he had credentials of belief and piety, a principle that was adhered to by all the subsequent Kharijite groups and sects. This differs from the position of both Sunnis, who later went on accept the leadership of those in power, and Shi'a, who were to assert that the leadership rightly belonged to Ali and his descendants. Kharijites considered the caliphate of Abu Bakr and Umar to be legitimate and had a high regard for them, but believed that Uthman had deviated from the path of justice and truth in the latter half of his caliphate and hence was liable to be killed or displaced. They also believed that Ali committed a grave sin when he agreed to the arbitration with Mu'awiya, although he too was legitimate caliph before the arbitration. Any leader was subject to deposition if he committed a sin and went off the right path. Kharijites also asserted that faith without accompanying deeds is useless and anyone who goes against injunctions of religion is an apostate and a polytheist and must repent to reenter the religion else he would be subject to death. They thus deemed Ali, Mu'awiya and all those who agreed to the arbitration as disbelievers, as they had breached the rules of the Qur'an. Azariqa held a more extreme position that such apostates could not reenter Islam and were to be killed along with their women and children. Azariqa also held non-activist Kharijites as apostates. Kharijites believed that Muslims had the duty to revolt against any ruler who deviated from their interpretation of Islam or failed to manage Muslim's affairs with justice and consultation or committed a major sin. Of the moderates, Sufriyya and Bayhasiyya considered all non-Kharijite Muslims polytheists but also refused to take up arms against them, unless necessary. Ibadiyya, on the other hand, did not declare non-Kharijites as polytheists rather as disbelievers of a lower degree. =Other doctrines= Many Khawarij groups believed that the act of sinning is analogous to kufr \\"disbelief\\" and that every grave sinner was regarded as a kafir unless they repent. They invoked the doctrine of free will, in opposition to that of predestination in their opposition to the Ummayad Caliphate, which held that Umayyad rule was ordained by God. Based on Kharijite poetry writings, scholar Ihsan Abbas finds three categories of focus among them: *the strong desire of Kharijites for martyrdom and dying for the sake of God *detailed descriptions of how Kharijites defined a just and pious ruler *their universal tendency to blame the self for failing to establish the previous two categories.Hussam S. Timani, Modern Intellectual Readings of the Kharijites, pgs. 84-85. Volume 262 of American University Studies, Series VII: Theology and Religion. Bern: Peter Lang, 2008. On the basis of women fighting alongside Muhammad, KhƒÅrijƒ´s have viewed fighting jihad as a requirement for women. One famous example is the warrior and poet LaylƒÅ bint ·π¨arƒ´f.Lori A. Allen, 'Jihad: Arab States', in Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures: Family, Law and Politics, ed. by Suad Joseph and AfsƒÅna Na«ßmƒÅbƒÅdƒ´ 319-21 (p. 319). Traditional Muslim view Non-Kharijite Muslims attribute several Hadiths to the Islamic prophet Muhammad prophesying the emergence of the Kharijites. After the Battle of Hunayn, a man named Dhu al-Khuwaysira is reported to have accused Muhammad of unjustly distributing the spoils. Umar reportedly asked for Muhammad's permission to kill the man, but the latter declined, saying: According to German orientalist Julius Wellhausen, the report is a fabrication and was invented retrospectively. Although he describes the content of the Hadith as the apt criticism of the Kharijtes. A similar Hadith attributed to Muhammad says: Other Hadiths with themes of \\"arrow through the target\\" or \\"Qur'an not going beyond throats\\" are reported. Though the Hadiths never name Kharijites or any particular Kharijite individual, these are generally seen by non- Kharijite Muslims to be referring to the Kharijites. Some Hadiths of this sort encourage Muslims to eliminate them. The Kharijites drew condemnation by traditional Muslim historians and heresiographers of subsequent centuries. The 14th-century historian Ibn Kathir wrote: \\"If they ever gained strength, they would surely corrupt the whole of the Earth, Iraq and Shaam ‚Äì they would not leave a baby, male or female, neither a man or a woman, because as far as they are concerned the people have caused corruption, a corruption that cannot be rectified except by mass killing.\\" Al-Shahrastani compares the Kharijite slogan of hukma to the traditional Islamic account of Iblis refusing God's command, for Islam demanded obedience to the ruler and by rebelling against the ruler they rebelled against God. The term Khawarij, which originally meant those who went out of Kufa to gather at Nahrawan during the time of Ali was subsequently understood as those who went out of the fold of Islam and the Muslim community. =Modern times= In the modern era, some of Muslim theologians and observers have compared the beliefs and actions of the Islamic State (IS), al-Qaeda, and like-minded groups to the Khawarij. In particular, the groups are alleged to share the Kharijites' radical approach whereby self- described Muslims are declared unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death and their disinterest in Quranic calls for moderation.The Balance of Islam in Challenging Extremism  Dr. Usama Hasan 2012 quilliam foundation However, IS preachers strongly reject being compared to the Khawarij. In the 18th century, Hanafi scholar Ibn Abidin declared the Wahhabi movement of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab as modern Khawarij although he does not consider them non-Muslims.

Modern historians' views on the origins At Siffin the people who supported arbitration were the same people who later vehemently objected to it and seceded from Ali‚Äôs army. The question as to what caused such a radical change in the same group of people has been discussed by various historians. According to Rudolf Ernst Br√ºnnow, Qurra supported the proposal because as pious believers in the Qur'an, they felt obliged to respond to the call of making Qur'an the arbitrator. The people who objected to the treaty were, in Br√ºnnow's view, Bedouin Arabs who had settled in Kufa and Basra following the wars of conquest. In his view, they had devoted themselves to the cause of Islam and perceived the arbitration by two people as an acute religious injustice, which drove them into secession and later into open rebellion. As such, he regards the Qurra and the Kharijites as separate groups. Wellhausen has criticized Br√ºnnow's hypothesis because all Basran and Kufan inhabitants were Bedouins, including Qurra, and since Br√ºnnow regards these Bedouins pious people anyway, it makes them little different from the Qurra in this regard. Wellhausen argues that the group that first favored and then rejected the arbitration was the same group. According to him, their contrasting behavior is not illogical from their point of view. They accepted arbitration of Qur'an but some of them later realized, based on religious grounds, that it was their mistake, acknowledged it as such, repented and demanded the same from Ali and other people in his army. In his view, the Kharijites thus emanated from the Qurra. Martin Hinds regards the Kharijites and the Qurra as the same group. In his view, they supported the arbitration because they assumed it would bring end to the war but Ali would remain caliph and would return to Medina, leaving the administration of Iraq in the hands of the local population including themselves. But they denounced it once they discovered that Ali was not recognized as caliph in the document and that the arbiters could also use their own judgment in addition to the Qur'anic principles. M. A. Shaban, although asserting that the Qurra and the Kharijites were the same group, does not recognize the Qurra as the Qur'an readers. According to him they were villagers who had gained status in Iraq during the caliphate of Umar, were dissatisfied with the economic policies of Uthman and saw Ali's caliphate as a means of restoring their status. When he agreed to talks with the cousin of Uthman (Mu'awiya) they felt their status threatened and consequently rebelled. According to him, main role in forcing Ali to accept the arbitration was not of the Qurra, but of the tribal chiefs under the leadership of Ash'ath ibn Qays, who had benefited from the policies of Uthman. They were not enthusiastic supporters of Ali and considered the prospect of continued war not in their interests. According to Fred Donner, one of the reasons may have been the contents of the treaty. When the agreement was drawn up, it stipulated that the arbitrators would decide on whether Uthman had been killed unjustly.

Ilya Ilyich Oblomov is the central character of the novel, portrayed as the ultimate incarnation of the superfluous man, a symbolic character in 19th-century Russian literature. Oblomov is a young, generous nobleman who seems incapable of making important decisions or undertaking any significant actions. Throughout the novel he rarely leaves his room or bed. In the first 50 pages, he manages only to move from his bed to a chair. The book was considered a satire of Russian intelligentsia. The novel was popular when it came out, and some of its characters and devices have imprinted on Russian culture and language.  Creation and Publication  Goncharov first thought of writing Oblomov in the mid-1840s, soon after publishing his first novel A Common Story. In 1849 he wrote ‚ÄúEpisode from an Unfinished Novel: Oblomov‚Äôs Dream‚Äù, a short story that was published in the literary journal Sovremennik. At that point Goncharov had just started writing his novel, and Oblomov was published ten years later, with ‚ÄúOblomov‚Äôs Dream‚Äù as Chapter 9 in Part 1. The character that would become Oblomov originally appeared in 1838 in the Maikovs‚Äô handwritten magazine written by Goncharov, as one of the protagonists in ‚ÄúLikhaia bolest.‚Äù Nikon Ustinovich Tiazhelemko, or the pre-Oblomov Oblomov, was a slothful but rather endearing man whose name evokes in Russian the attribute ‚Äúheavy‚Äù(tiazhelyi) and the expression ‚Äúslow to move‚Äù(tiazhel na pod\\"em). The work on Oblomov continued for several years after the publication of ‚ÄúOblomov‚Äôs Dream‚Äù but was first interrupted by the death of Goncharov's mother, and then his decision to join the around the world voyage of the naval frigate Pallas. When Pallas finally ended its journey in August 1854 in Russia's far east, Goncharov spent another half a year getting acquainted with Siberia and slowly making his way back to St. Petersburg. Although Goncharov was not working on Oblomov during his long journey it appears he was thinking about the book, as Oblomov shows up in many of his letters home. When he tried to begin writing again in February 1855, he blamed his delays and inability to write on exhaustion, loss of momentum, and a new and more demanding job as a censor. The summer of 1857 finally found Goncharov, alone in Marienbad, completely exhilarated and writing Oblomov in full swing. By the end of August the novel was complete. He spent the following year revising and rewriting the novel until finally on January 14, 1859, Oblomov was published in Otechestvennye zapiski. Plot summary The novel focuses on the life of the main character, Ilya Ilyich Oblomov. Oblomov is a member of the upper middle class and the son of a member of Russia's nineteenth-century landed gentry. Oblomov's distinguishing characteristic is his slothful attitude towards life. Oblomov raises this trait to an art form, conducting his little daily business from his bed. The first part of the book finds Oblomov in bed one morning. He receives a letter from the manager of his country estate, Oblomovka, explaining that the financial situation is deteriorating and that he must visit to make some major decisions. But Oblomov can barely leave his bedroom, much less journey a thousand miles into the country. As he sleeps, a dream reveals Oblomov's upbringing in Oblomovka. He is never required to work or perform household duties, and his parents constantly pull him from school for vacations and trips or for trivial reasons. In contrast, his friend Andrey Stoltz, born to a German father and a Russian mother, is raised in a strict, disciplined environment, and he is dedicated and hard-working. Stoltz visits at the end of Part 1, finally rousing Oblomov from sleep. As the story develops, Stoltz introduces Oblomov to a young woman, Olga, and the two fall in love. However, his apathy and fear of moving forward are too great, and she calls off their engagement when it is clear that he will keep delaying their wedding and avoiding putting his affairs in order. Oblomov is swindled repeatedly by his \\"friends\\" Taranteyev and Ivan Matveyevich, his landlady's brother, and Stoltz has to undo the damage each time. The last time, Oblomov ends up living in penury because Taranteyev and Ivan Matveyevich are blackmailing him out of all of his income from the country estate, which lasts for over a year before Stoltz discovers the situation and reports Ivan Matveyevich to his supervisor. Meanwhile, Olga leaves Russia and visits Paris, where she bumps into Stoltz on the street. The two strike up a romance and end up marrying. However, not even Oblomov could go through life without at least one moment of self-possession and purpose. When Taranteyev's behavior at last reaches insufferable lows, Oblomov confronts him, slaps him around a bit and finally kicks him out of the house. Sometime before his death he is visited by Stoltz, who had promised to his wife a last attempt at bringing Oblomov back to the world. During this visit Stoltz discovers that Oblomov has married his widowed landlady, Agafia Pshenitsina, and had a child - named Andrey, after Stoltz. Stoltz realizes that he can no longer hope to reform Oblomov, and leaves. Oblomov spends the rest of his life in a second Oblomovka, continuing to be taken care of by Agafia Pshenitsina as he used to be taken care of as a child. She can prepare the food he likes, meal, and makes sure that Oblomov does not have a single worrisome thought. By then Oblomov had already accepted his fate, and during the conversation he mentions \\"Oblomovitis\\" as the real cause of his demise. Oblomov dies in his sleep, finally fulfilling his wish to sleep forever. Stoltz adopts his son upon his death. Characters * Ilya Ilyich Oblomov is the eponymous character of the novel. Raised to never worry about his education or the running of his inherited estate, Oblomov spends the novel attempting to recreate his childhood idyll. By the beginning of the story, his inactivity and fear of responsibility have led to the disrepair of his estate and personal affairs. Part I of the novel follows Oblomov's morning, as he refuses to take care of his estate and apartment in favor of sleeping and dreaming about his childhood home. Only Stoltz can get him out of bed, but cannot convince Oblomov to revisit his estate. Oblomov gradually falls in love with Stoltz's friend Olga and the two become engaged as she attempts to continue Stoltz's mission of improving Oblomov. Olga eventually breaks off the engagement when she realizes that Oblomov is unable to change his ways. While he sincerely attempts to follow Stoltz's and Olga's advice throughout the novel, he ultimately resists their changes and lives out the rest of his life with Agafia Pshenitsina and their children, having never gone back to Oblomovka. * Andrey Ivanovich Stoltz is Oblomov's best friend from childhood, and is married to Olga by the end of the novel. The only child of a German father and Russian mother, Stoltz went to the same school as Oblomov and frequently visited Oblomov's family. While Stoltz's father instilled ideals of efficiency and practicality, Stoltz's mother often attempted to ease her husband's lessons by pampering Stoltz and teaching him music. The influence of Stoltz's father leaves him a practical and work-oriented man, but his childhood days in Oblomovka cause him to be lifelong friends with Oblomov. Stoltz spends much of the novel attempting to help Oblomov, both by solving Oblomov's financial and other problems and trying to mold Oblomov in his image. His efforts center mainly around getting Oblomov to regain control of his estate. Ultimately Stoltz himself handles Oblomovka's renovation, modernizing it and investing in new infrastructure. His final attempt to bring Oblomov back to Oblomovka fails when he realizes that Oblomov has married Agafia Pshenitsina, and instead he adopts Oblomov's son upon Oblomov's death. * Olga is introduced to Oblomov by Stoltz and is included in Stoltz's attempts to reform Oblomov. Olga spends much of her time throughout the novel determined to change Oblomov's ways. She and Oblomov fall in love, and her efforts seem to be successful for a time, as Oblomov reads more novels and attends more social events. The two become engaged, but Oblomov's deep-set fear of moving forward prevent him from taking necessary steps toward actual marriage, and Olga breaks off the engagement. Olga then travels to Paris with her aunt, where she runs into Stoltz. The two fall in love and marry, moving to the Crimea. * Zakhar is Oblomov's servant. He constantly tries to get Oblomov to get his life in order by reminding him about the dues of his estate. He is an ineffective servant but extremely devoted to his master, and he holds the Oblomov family in high esteem. He becomes a beggar after Oblomov's death until Stoltz finds and takes care of him. * Agafia Pshenitsina is Oblomov's widowed landlady, who falls in love with him and holds him in high regard as a nobleman. She is also Ivan Matveyevich's sister. At the end of the story, it is revealed to Stoltz that Oblomov and Agafia are married with a son. * Taranteyev and Ivan Matveyevich are Oblomov's ‚Äúfriends‚Äù, who repeatedly swindle him. Taranteyev and Ivan end up blackmailing Oblomov out of all of his income from the country estate. This stunt lasts for over a year before Stoltz discovers the situation and reports Ivan Matveyevich and Taranteyev to his supervisor. When Taranteyev's behavior at last reaches insufferable lows, Oblomov confronts him, slaps him around a bit and finally kicks him out of the house. Style = Narrator = The narrator of Oblomov appears as a rather traditional third person narrator. In the beginning of the novel he is largely invisible and lets the characters do the talking. As the novel progresses he comes far less neutral and actually begins to not only describe the characters but he begins to judge them, like criticizing Oblomov's family for being overly protective of Ilya as a child, or calling Oblomov's false friends ‚Äúparasites.‚Äù The narrator's strongly developed moralizing tendencies are constantly upset by an equally strong note of ambivalence that undermines his judgements. The narrator seems to be someone who may wish he knew the answers but is honest enough to admit that he does not. Goncharov is eager by the end of the novel to make a distinction between himself and the narrator by making the narrator an invented character. However, Goncharov chooses to reveal the identity of the narrator only when the revelation would not affect our reading of the novel. There are many moments when the narrator reveals himself to be uncharacteristically chatty, digressive, and not entirely ‚Äúreliable.‚Äù The sentiments expressed in the opening of Oblomov's dream are so much like Oblomov's own, that if it after all his dream the narrator may have to be Oblomov himself or at least his point of view. = Characterizations and Depictions = Goncharov used a lot of dialogue within his works. Therefore, the characters in Oblomov reveal themselves primarily through their own speech, with very limited comments by the author. The ‚Äúcolloquial exchanges here coexist with long passages that characterize the novel‚Äôs inhabitants more directly.‚Äù Themes = Stages of Life = Goncharov wrote three novels over the course of his life: Oblomov, A Common Story and The Precipice. Each novel was based heavily on autobiographical material, focusing on different epochs of life - specifically, infancy and childhood as influenced by the mother, then the ‚Äúawakening of adolescence‚Äù, and finally adulthood as associated with St. Petersburg, government work, and marriage. The main characters of all three books share multiple important similarities: their fathers have either been absent or largely insignificant in their upbringings, they rely heavily on their mothers even past childhood, and they travel to St. Petersburg during their university years. Goncharov himself lost his father at the age of seven, and worked in St. Petersburg as a translator after graduating from Moscow State University. Aduev, the protagonist of A Common Story, also isolates himself from reality and prefers to live within his imagination much like Oblomov does. With these thematically linked protagonists, Goncharov envisioned Oblomov as part of a thematic ‚Äútrilogy‚Äù, fitting between his other two novels. Goncharov imagined his novels as different reflections of a single personality; ‚Äúthey are but one tremendous structure, one mirror reflecting in miniature three epochs: Old Life, Sleep, and Awakening.‚Äù Aduev, Oblomov, and Rajskij therefore form ‚Äúbut one personality in its successive rebirths.‚Äù Oblomov represents the epoch of ‚ÄúSleep‚Äù in Goncharov's vision. Yet many literary critics have found Goncharov's vision to be lacking. Belinski and Dobroljubov, two well-known literary critics who wrote famous reviews of Goncharov's works, failed to recognize a larger connection between Oblomov and Goncharov's other novels.  Childhood  Oblomov spends much of his adult life attempting to remain within his childhood, a time that he remembers for its peacefulness and the safety provided by his mother. His memory of childhood in Oblomovka is dominated by its cyclical time, with ‚Äúbirths, celebrations, feasts...new faces take the places of the old, baby boys grow into marriageable young men who duly marry and reproduce themselves. Such is the pattern according to which life weaves itself this seamless length of identical fabric to be snipped gently only at the grave itself.‚ÄùGoncharov, Ivan A, and Stephen Pearl. Oblomov. New York: Bunim & Bannigan, 2006. Print. The Oblomovka of his childhood keeps track of time through the cyclical events of birth, death, and natural seasons, relying on the repetition of events to pass through life. Even Oblomov's name and patronymic, Ilya Ilyich, reveal him as a repeat of his father instead of just a son. This instilling of contentment through repetition renders Oblomov ill-equipped for the expectations placed on his adulthood in a rapidly changing society.  Adulthood  Adulthood constantly discourages Oblomov, whose main desire is to retreat into the safety of his childhood sense of time. He attempts to take on jobs and responsibilities for Oblomovka, but upon realizing the tasks these require, he becomes easily defeated and retreats into metaphorical and literal sleep. Even his desire to return to Oblomovka cannot be realized, as the estate has fallen into disarray and has now become a responsibility instead of a safe haven. His main foray into adulthood comes about through Olga, who attempts to motivate him to take on responsibilities out of love for her. Particularly for Oblomov, adulthood means changing his cyclical sense of time to continually look forward instead of back. Yet he remains stuck within his childhood desire for things to stay put; loving Olga means that he does not wish to change her like she wishes to change him, but his sense of time prevents him from thinking of the future, and he therefore cannot progress into adulthood by marrying her. Stoltz, in contrast, exemplifies society's expectations for adulthood in his eagerness to move forward. His own childhood is marked heavily by his father's insistence on treating him as an adult and teaching him the importance of accomplishment, which carries into his adulthood. Stoltz, unlike Oblomov, sees his life as a straight line and is therefore driven by the desire to continually move forward. = Oblomovism = The words Oblomovism and Oblomovitis (translations of oblomovshchina) refer to the fatalistic slothfulness that Oblomov exhibits. Nikolai Dobrolyubov, in his 1859 article \\"What is Oblomovism?\\", described the word as an integral part of Russian avos'. Stolz suggests that Oblomov's death was the result of \\"Oblomovism\\". However, Elaine Blair argues in \\"The Short Happy Life of Ilya Ilyich Oblomov\\" that Oblomov is ‚Äúnot merely lazy.‚Äù She simply says, ‚Äúour hero favors very short-term pleasures over long-term ones,‚Äù ‚Äúhe is self-conscious in a way that no farcical character or Rabelaisian grotesque would be,‚Äù and ‚Äúto Oblomov, to be absorbed in any task is to lose something of oneself; a person can maintain his full dignity only in repose.‚Äù A character named \\"Oblomov\\" in art patron Peggy Guggenheim's memoir Out of This Century was identified by poet Stephen Spender as Samuel Beckett, her one-time lover. = Social Changes in Russia = Oblomov's place in the context of Russian history became the focus of much literary criticism when it was first published. Goncharov himself thought of Oblomov more as a treatise on human nature than as commentary on Russian society, but Dobrolyubov focused heavily on Oblomov and Stoltz as social and ethical antitheses; Oblomov became an allegory for superfluity of Russian aristocracy in a time when serfdom was soon to be abolished. As a member of the old nobility, Oblomov's inertia and fear of change represent old socioeconomic ideals that become out of place throughout the 19th century. Stoltz and Olga become Oblomov's main connections to present Russia, but Oblomov ultimately rejects the social changes they represent when he marries Agafya and lives the rest of his life in a second Oblomovka. Despite Oblomov's own inertia, Oblomovka successfully integrates into present Russia thanks to Stoltz's efforts at modernization. Stoltz introduces new infrastructure and education for the peasants at Oblomovka, and revitalizes its profits. Yet just as Russia no longer has a place for Oblomov, Russia similarly does not yet have a place for Stoltz as a leader of social change, and Stoltz continuously travels to different countries instead of staying in Russia for business. Olga, therefore, becomes the link between past and future Russia, in her love for Oblomov and her marriage to Stoltz.  Literary criticism  Almost immediately upon its release in 1859, Oblomov became the subject of much discussion and literary criticism, due in large part to Dobrolyubov's essay ‚ÄúWhat is Oblomovism?‚Äù. Today it is still seen as a classic of 19th century Russian literature, and a quintessential Russian novel. ‚ÄúWhat is Oblomovism?‚Äù focused heavily on the social significance of the novel, interpreting Stoltz and Olga as social ideals in contrast to Oblomov's reliance on the past. Dobrolyubov, a follower of Vissarion Belinsky and a leading literary critic, believed strongly that literature should promote positive change, and his essay praised Oblomov as an effective warning against the Russian social disease of ‚ÄúOblomovism‚Äù. Aside from introducing Oblomov to a large literary circle, the essay catalyzed Oblomov‚Äôs presence as a novel of social significance and became Dobrolyubov's best-known work. Goncharov himself was happy with Dobrolyubov‚Äôs interpretation, writing that ‚Äúthere is nothing left to be said about Oblomovism, that is its meaning, after the publication of this article.‚Äù Another critic, Alexander Druzhinin, focused on the psychological and literary aspects of Oblomov, instead of the historical context. Rather than interpreting characters as either warnings or ideals of society, Druzhinin praised the portrayal of Stoltz and Olga as psychological and artistic foils to Oblomov. Druzhinin believed that Oblomov, not oblomovism, was the focus of the novel; characters and readers alike loved Oblomov, making him deserving of recognition as a unique character within Russian literary canon. Adaptations Son of Oblomov, a comedy adaptation for the theatre, opened at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, in 1964 and transferred to the Comedy Theatre in the West End the same year. It starred Spike Milligan, who used less and less of the original script until eventually the entire piece was improvised farce; also in the cast were Joan Greenwood, Bill Owen, and Valentine Dyall. Oblomov was adapted to the cinema screen in the Soviet Union by Nikita Mikhalkov in 1980, as A Few Days from the Life of I.I. Oblomov. This film was later named Best Foreign Language Film for 1981 by the U.S. National Board of Review. In 1989 BBC TV made an English language dramatisation of the novel, with George Wendt in the title role. In this version, Oblomov was a lazy modern-day Communist Party boss. In 2005 BBC Radio 4 made a two-part English language dramatisation, heralding the lead character as a tragic-comic hero for a couch potato generation. It was adapted by Stephen Wyatt, produced and directed by Claire Grove and starred Toby Jones as the lead, supported by Trevor Peacock, Claire Skinner, Clive Swift, Gerard McDermott, Nicholas Boulton, and Richenda Carey. Olga's singing voice was provided by Olivia Robinson, with Helen Crayford on piano. In 2008 an adaptation was produced for the English service of the Russian national broadcaster, the Voice of Russia. English translations *C. J.

The defining characteristics of libertarian legal theory are its insistence that the amount of governmental intervention should be kept to a minimum and the primary functions of law should be enforcement of contracts and social order, though social order is often seen as a desirable side effect of a free market rather than a philosophical necessity. Historically, the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek is the most important libertarian legal theorist. Another important predecessor was Lysander Spooner, a 19th-century American individualist anarchist and lawyer. John Locke was also an influence on libertarian legal theory (see Two Treatises of Government). Ideas range from anarcho-capitalism to a minimal state providing physical protection and enforcement of contracts. Some advocate regulation, including the existence of a police force, military, public land and public infrastructure. Geolibertarians oppose absolute ownership of land on Georgist grounds.

He maintained the large and unstable borders through his martial prowess. Biography He was the son of Joscelin I, Lord of Courtenay, born in 1034, and wife Isabella (or Elizabeth), daughter of Guy I of Montlh√©ry. He arrived in the Holy Land during the Crusade of 1101 after the First Crusade, and entered first into the service of his cousin Count Baldwin II of Rethel (in the army of Godfrey of Bouillon), who invested him with the lordship of Turbessel, and later in the army of Stephen of Blois. In 1104 he was captured at the Battle of Harran. By 1113, he had carved out a semi-autonomous state around Turbessel to the west of the Euphrates, where the land was prosperous, while Baldwin II controlled the territory east of the Euphrates around Edessa itself, which was depopulated and continually harassed by the Turks. That year, Baldwin dispossessed him of Turbessel, and Joscelin travelled to Jerusalem, where he was given the title of Prince of Galilee. In 1118, Baldwin II succeeded Baldwin I as king of Jerusalem. Despite their former hostility, Joscelin fully endorsed Baldwin II, over the candidacy of Baldwin I's brother Eustace III of Boulogne. Joscelin was rewarded with the County of Edessa. As count, he was taken prisoner along with Waleran of Le Puiset, in 1122 near Saruj by Belek Ghazi. Later he was joined in captivity at Kharput, by Baldwin II, king of Jerusalem, who had been captured in April 1123. They were rescued by fifty Armenian soldiers, who disguised themselves as merchants and infiltrated the fortress where the prisoners were kept. They killed the guards and freed the hostages. However, the castle was soon besieged by a large Turkish force and it was decided that Joscelin should seek assistance. Baldwin stayed in the fortress and after some time it was reclaimed by the Turks. After returning to Edessa he was able to enlarge the territory of the county, and in 1125 he participated in the Battle of Azaz, a Crusader victory against the atabeg of Mosul, who were led by Aq-Sunqur il-Bursuqi. In 1131, during the siege of a small castle north-east of Aleppo, a sapper's mine collapsed and Joscelin was gravely injured. Shortly thereafter, he received word that emir G√ºm√ºshtigin Gazi was marching against the fortress town of Kaysun. When Joscelin's own son, the future Joscelin II, refused to aid the town, he commanded that his own army should decamp and Joscelin was borne on a litter before the army. When Ghazi heard of Joscelin's approach, perhaps mistakenly believing him already dead, he lifted the siege and retreated, and thus the warrior prince won a final battle before dying shortly thereafter on the roadside. Joscelin married an Armenian noblewoman named Beatrice, daughter of Constantine I of Armenia. Beatrice was the mother of his son Joscelin II, Count of Edessa. In 1122, after Beatrice died (d. 1119), Joscelin married Maria, daughter of Richard of Salerno and sister of Roger, regent of the Principality of Antioch. Notes  References   Runciman, Steven.

Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. ; ‚Äì ) was a Russian novelist best known for his novels A Common Story (1847), Oblomov (1859), and The Precipice (1869). He also served in many official capacities, including the position of censor. Goncharov was born in Simbirsk into the family of a wealthy merchant; as a reward for his grandfather's military service, they were elevated to gentry status.Oblomov, Penguin Classics, 2005. p. ix. He was educated at a boarding school, then the Moscow College of Commerce, and finally at Moscow State University. After graduating, he served for a short time in the office of the Governor of Simbirsk, before moving to Saint Petersburg where he worked as government translator and private tutor, while publishing poetry and fiction in private almanacs. Goncharov's first novel, A Common Story, was published in Sovremennik in 1847. Goncharov's second and best-known novel, Oblomov, was published in 1859 in Otechestvennye zapiski. His third and final novel, The Precipice, was published in Vestnik Evropy in 1869. He also worked as a literary and theatre critic. Towards the end of his life Goncharov wrote a memoir called An Uncommon Story, in which he accused his literary rivals, first and foremost Ivan Turgenev, of having plagiarized his works and prevented him from achieving European fame. The memoir was published in 1924. Fyodor Dostoevsky, among others, considered Goncharov an author of high stature. Anton Chekhov is quoted as stating that Goncharov was \\"...ten heads above me in talent.\\"  Biography  =Early life= Ivan Goncharov was born in Simbirsk (now Ulyanovsk). His father Alexander Ivanovich Goncharov was a wealthy grain merchant and a state official who served several terms as mayor of Simbirsk. The family's big stone manor in the town center occupied a large area and had all the characteristics of a rural manor, with huge barns (packed with wheat and flour) and numerous stables.Mashinsky, S. Goncharov and His Legacy. Foreword to The Works of I.A.Goncharov in 6 Volumes. Ogonyok's Library. Pravda Publishers. Moscow, 1972. Pp. 3‚Äì54 Alexander Ivanovich died when Ivan was seven years old. He was educated first by his mother, Avdotya Matveevna, and then his godfather Nikolay Nikolayevich Tregubov, a nobleman and a former Russian Navy officer. Tregubov, a man of liberal views and a secret Masonic lodge member, who knew some of the Decembrists personally, and who was one of the most popular men amongst the Simbirsk intelligentsia, was a major early influence upon Goncharov, who particularly enjoyed his seafaring stories. With Tregubov around, Goncharov's mother could focus on domestic affairs. \\"His servants, cabmen, the whole household merged with ours; it was a single family. All the practical issues were now mother's, and she proved to be an excellent housewife; all the official duties were his,\\" Ivan Goncharov remembered. =Education= Plaque on the house in 20 Goncharova street in Ulyanovsk where Goncharov was born in 1812 In 1820‚Äì1822 Goncharov studied at a private boarding-school owned by Rev. Fyodor S. Troitsky. It was here that he learned the French and German languages and started reading European writers, borrowing books from Troitsky's vast library. In August 1822 Ivan was sent to Moscow and entered the College of Commerce. There he spent eight unhappy years, detesting the low quality of education and the severe discipline, taking solace in self-education. \\"My first humanitarian and moral teacher was Nikolai Karamzin,\\" he remembered. Then Pushkin came as a revelation; the serial publication of his poem Evgeny Onegin captured the young man's imagination. In 1830, Goncharov decided to quit the college and in 1831 (having missed one year because of a cholera outbreak in Moscow) he enrolled in Moscow State University's Philology Faculty to study literature, arts, and architecture. At the University, with its atmosphere of intellectual freedom and lively debate, Goncharov's spirit thrived. One episode proved to be especially memorable: when his then idol Alexander Pushkin arrived as a guest lecturer to have a public debate with professor Mikhail T. Katchenovsky on the authenticity of The Tale of Igor's Campaign. \\"It was as if sunlight lit up the auditorium. I was enchanted by his poetry at the time...it was his genius that formed my aesthetic ideas ‚Äì although the same, I think, could be said of all the young people of the time who were interested in poetry,\\" Goncharov wrote.Goncharov, I.A. The Works of... Moscow, 1980. Vol. 7. P. 241). Unlike Alexander Herzen, Vissarion Belinsky, or Nikolay Ogaryov, his fellow Moscow University students, Goncharov remained indifferent to the ideas of political and social change that were gaining popularity at the time. Reading and translating were his main occupations. In 1832, the Telescope magazine published two chapters of Eugene Sue's novel Atar-Gull (1831), translated by Goncharov. This was his debut publication. In 1834, Goncharov graduated from the University and returned home to enter the chancellery of Simbirsk governor A. M. Zagryazhsky. A year later, he moved to Saint Petersburg and started working as a translator at the Finance Ministry's Foreign commerce department. Here, in the Russian capital, he became friends with the Maykov family and tutored both Apollon Maykov and Valerian Maykov in the Latin language and in Russian literature. He became a member of the elitist literary circle based in the Maykovs' house and attended by writers like Ivan Turgenev, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Dmitry Grigorovich. The Maykovs' almanac Snowdrop featured many of Goncharov's poems, but he soon stopped dabbling in poetry altogether. Some of those early verses were later incorporated into the novel A Common Story as Aduev's writings, a sure sign that the author had stopped taking them seriously. =Literary career= Portrait of Goncharov by Kirill Gorbunov, 1847 Goncharov's first piece of prose appeared in an issue of Snowdrop, a satirical novella called Evil Illness (1838), ridiculing romantic sentimentalism and fantasizing. Another novella, A Fortunate Blunder, a \\"high- society drama\\" in the tradition set by Marlinsky, Vladimir Odoevsky and Vladimir Sollogub, tinged with comedy, appeared in another privately published almanac, Moonlit Nights, in 1839. In 1842 Goncharov wrote an essay called Ivan Savvich Podzhabrin, a natural school psychological sketch. Published in Sovremennik six years later, it failed to make any impact, being very much a period piece, but later scholars reviewed it positively, as something in the vein of the Nikolay Gogol-inspired genre known as the \\"physiological essay\\", marked by a fine style and precision in depicting the life of the common man in the city. In the early 1840s Goncharov worked on a novel called The Old People, but the manuscript has been lost. A Common Story Goncharov's first novel, A Common Story, was published in Sovremennik in 1847. It dealt with the conflict between the excessive romanticism of a young Russian nobleman who has recently arrived in Saint Petersburg from the provinces, and the sober pragmatism of the emerging commercial class of the capital. A Common Story polarized critics and made its author famous. The novel was a direct response to Vissarion Belinsky's call for exposing a new type, that of the complacent romantic, common at the time; it was lavishly praised by the famous critic as one of the best Russian books of the year. The term aduyevschina (after the novel's protagonist Aduyev) became popular with reviewers who saw it as synonymous with vain romantic aspirations. Leo Tolstoy, who liked the novel, used the same word to describe social egotism and the inability of some people to see beyond their immediate interests. In 1849 Sovremennik published Oblomov's Dream, an extract from Goncharov's future second novel Oblomov, (known under the working title The Artist at the time), which worked well on its own as a short story. Again it was lauded by the Sovremennik staff. Slavophiles, while giving the author credit for being a fine stylist, reviled the irony aimed at patriarchal Russian ways.Moskvityanin. 1849. No.11. Vol.1. Section 4. The novel itself, though, appeared only ten years later, preceded by some extraordinary events in Goncharov's life. In 1852 Goncharov embarked on a long journey through England, Africa, Japan, and back to Russia, on board the frigate Pallada, as a secretary for Admiral Yevfimy Putyatin, whose mission was to inspect Alaska and other distant outposts of the Empire, and also to establish trade relations with Japan. The log-book which it was Goncharov's duty to keep served as a basis for his future book. He returned to Saint Petersburg on 25 February 1855, after traveling through Siberia and the Urals, this continental leg of the journey lasting six months. Goncharov's travelogue, Frigate \\"Pallada\\" (\\"Pallada\\" is the Russian spelling of \\"Pallas\\"), began to appear, first in Otechestvennye Zapiski (April 1855), then in The Sea Anthology and other magazines. In 1858 Frigate \\"Pallada\\" was published as a separate book; it received favourable reviews and became very popular. For the mid-19th century Russian readership the book came as a revelation, providing new insights into the world, hitherto unknown. Goncharov, a well-read man and a specialist in the history and economics of the countries he visited, proved to be a competent and insightful writer. He warned against seeing his work as any kind of political or social statement, insisting it was a subjective piece of writing, but critics praised the book as a well-balanced, unbiased report, containing valuable ethnographic material, but also some social critique. Again, the anti-romantic tendency prevailed: it was seen as part of the polemic with those Russian authors who tended to romanticize the \\"pure and unspoiled\\" life of the uncivilized world. According to Nikolay Dobrolyubov, The Frigate Pallada \\"bore the hallmark of a gifted epic novelist.\\" Oblomov Title page of the 1915 English translation of Oblomov Throughout the 1850s Goncharov worked on his second novel, but the process was slow for many reasons. In 1855 he accepted the post of censor in the Saint Petersburg censorship committee. In this capacity, he helped publish important works by Ivan Turgenev, Nikolay Nekrasov, Aleksey Pisemsky, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky, a fact that brought resentment from some of his bosses. According to Pisemsky, Goncharov was officially reprimanded for permitting his novel A Thousand Souls to be published. Despite all this, Goncharov became the target of many satires and received a negative mention in Herzen's Kolokol. \\"One of the best Russian authors shouldn't have taken this sort of job upon himself,\\" critic Aleksander Druzhinin wrote in his diary. In 1856, as the official publishing policy hardened, Goncharov quit. In the summer of 1857 Goncharov went to Marienbad for medical treatment. There he wrote Oblomov, almost in its entirety. \\"It might seem strange, even impossible that in the course of one month the whole of the novel might be written... But it'd been growing in me for several years, so what I had to do then was just sit and write everything down,\\" he later remembered. Goncharov's second novel Oblomov was published in 1859 in Otechestvennye Zapiski. It had evolved from the earlier \\"Oblomov's Dream\\", which was later incorporated into the finished novel as Chapter 9. The novel caused much discussion in the Russian press, introduced another new term, oblomovshchina, to the literary lexicon and is regarded as a Russian classic. In his essay What Is Oblomovshchina? Nikolay Dobrolyubov provided an ideological background for the type of Russia's 'new man' exposed by Goncharov. The critic argued that, while several famous classic Russian literary characters ‚Äì Onegin, Pechorin, and Rudin ‚Äì bore symptoms of the 'Oblomov malaise', for the first time one single feature, that of social apathy, a self-destructive kind of laziness and unwillingness to even try and lift the burden of all-pervading inertia, had been brought to the fore and subjected to a thorough analysis. Fyodor Dostoyevsky, among others, considered Goncharov a noteworthy author of high stature. Anton Chekhov is quoted as stating that Goncharov was \\"...ten heads above me in talent.\\"Gayla Diment's introduction to Stephen Pearl's translation of Oblomov. New York: Bunim & Brown, 2006) Turgenev, who fell out with Goncharov after the latter accused him of plagiarism (specifically of having used some of the characters and situations from The Precipice, whose plan Goncharov had disclosed to him in 1855, in Home of the Gentry and On the Eve), nevertheless declared: \\"As long as there is even one Russian alive, Oblomov will be remembered!\\"Quoted in N. F. Budanova's \\"The confessions of Goncharov. The Unfinished Story. Literaturnoe Nasledstvo, 102 (2000), p. 202. The Precipice Portrait of Goncharov by Ivan Kramskoi, 1865 A moderate conservative at heart, Goncharov greeted the Emancipation reform of 1861, embraced the well-publicized notion of the government's readiness to \\"be at the helm of [social] progress\\", and found himself in opposition to the revolutionary democrats. In the summer of 1862 he became an editor of Severnaya Potchta (The Northern Post), an official newspaper of the Interior Ministry, and a year later returned to the censorship committee. In this second term Goncharov proved to be a harsh censor: he created serious problems for Nekrasov's Sovremennik and Russkoye Slovo, where Dmitry Pisarev was now a leading figure. Openly condemning 'nihilistic' tendencies and what he called \\"pathetic, imported doctrines of materialism, socialism, and communism\\", Goncharov found himself the target of heavy criticism. In 1863 he became a member of the State Publishing Council and two years later joined the Russian government's Department of Publishing. All the while he was working on his third novel, The Precipice, which came out in extracts: Sophia Nikolayevna Belovodova (a piece he himself was later skeptical about), Grandmother and Portrait. In 1867, Goncharov retired from his censorial position to devote himself entirely to writing The Precipice, a book he later called \\"my heart's child\\", which took him twenty years to finish. Towards the end of this tormenting process Goncharov spoke of the novel as a \\"burden\\" and an \\"insurmountable task\\" that blocked his development and made him unable to advance as a writer. In a letter to Turgenev he confessed that, after finishing Part Three, he had toyed with the idea of abandoning the whole project. In 1869 The Precipice, a story of the romantic rivalry among three men, condemning nihilism as subverting the religious and moral values of Russia, was published in Vestnik Evropy. Later critics came to see it as the final part of a trilogy, each part introducing a character typical of Russian high society of a certain period: first Aduev, then Oblomov, and finally Raisky, a gifted man, his artistic development halted by \\"lack of direction\\". According to scholar S. Mashinsky, as a social epic, The Precipice was superior to both A Common Story and Oblomov. The novel had considerable success, but the leftist press turned against its author. Saltykov-Shchedrin in Otechestvennye Zapiski (\\"The Street Philosophy\\", 1869), compared it unfavorably to Oblomov. While the latter \\"had been driven by ideas assimilated by its author from the best men of the 1840s\\", The Precipice featured \\"a bunch of people wandering to and fro without any sense of direction, their lines of action having neither beginning nor end,\\" according to the critic. Yevgeny Utin in Vestnik Evropy argued that Goncharov, like all writers of his generation, had lost touch with the new Russia.Utin, Ye.I. Literature Debates of Our Times. Vestnik Evropy. 1869, No. 11. The controversial character Mark Volokhov, as leftist critics saw it, had been concocted to condemn 'nihilism' again, thus making the whole novel 'tendentious'. Yet, as Vladimir Korolenko later wrote, \\"Volokhov and all things related to him will be forgotten, as Gogol's Correspondence has been forgotten, while Goncharov's huge characters will remain in history, towering over all of those spiteful disputes of old.\\" =Later years= Goncharov in 1886 Goncharov planned a fourth novel, set in the 1870s, but it failed to materialize. Instead he became a prolific critic, providing numerous theater and literature reviews; his \\"Myriad of Agonies\\" (Milyon terzaniy, 1871) is still regarded as one of the best essays on Alexandr Griboyedov's Woe from Wit. Goncharov also wrote short stories: his Servants of an Old Age cycle as well as \\"The Irony of Fate\\", \\"Ukha\\" and others, described the life of rural Russia. In 1880 the first edition of The Complete Works of Goncharov was published. After the writer's death, it became known that he had burnt many later manuscripts. Towards the end of his life Goncharov wrote an unusual memoir called An Uncommon Story, in which he accused his literary rivals, first and foremost Ivan Turgenev, of having plagiarized his works and prevented him from achieving European fame. Some critics claimed that the book was the product of an unstable mind, while others praised it as an eye- opening, if controversial piece of writing. It wasn't published until 1924.D. S. Mirsky, A History of Russian Literature (New York: Vintage, 1958) Goncharov, who never married, spent his last days absorbed in lonely and bitter recriminations because of the negative criticism some of his work had received. He died in Saint Petersburg on 27 September 1891, of pneumonia. He was buried at the Novoye Nikolskoe Cemetery of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra. In 1956 his ashes were moved to the Volkovo Cemetery in Leningrad.

Thornhill lies along the northern border of the North York area of the City of Toronto and immediately south of the City of Richmond Hill . Once a police village, Thornhill is now a community and postal designation, although its lower tier municipal governance is split between the City of Vaughan (its western portion) and the City of Markham (its eastern portion). As of 2016, the total population of Thornhill, both its Vaughan and Markham sections, was 112,719. History The corner of Old Yonge Street and Centre Street =Early history= Thornhill was founded in 1794.For a fuller account of Thornhill's early history, see Isabel Champion, ed., Markham: 1793‚Äì1900 (Markham, ON: Markham Historical Society, 1979), 297‚Äì301; 70f., 97f., 140f., 170, 335. Its first settlers on Yonge Street in Thornhill were Asa Johnson (who settled on the Vaughan side) and Nicholas Miller (c.1760‚Äì1810; who settled on the Markham side). Of particular importance was the arrival of Benjamin Thorne (January 4, 1794 ‚Äì July 2, 1848) in 1820 from Dorset, England, who was operating a gristmill, a sawmill, and a tannery in the community. The settlement came to be known as Thorne's Mills, and later, Thorne's Hill, from which its current name is derived. (Thorne committed suicide in 1848, after a serious wheat market crash.) Metropolitan line Between 1830 and 1848, Thornhill experienced a period of continued growth and prosperity. The business district of Thornhill developed on its portion of Yonge Street, between Centre Street and John Street. Stagecoaches travelled between Holland Landing (Lake Simcoe) and York (Toronto) as Yonge Street's road conditions improved with new stonework. During this prosperous period, several churches, many of which are still standing today, were constructed. Thornhill's location along Yonge Street, a major transportation route, proved beneficial to the community's growth throughout much of the twentieth century. The implementation of the electric radial Metropolitan line along Yonge Street in 1898 running north to Sutton and south to Toronto meant that, for the first time, people could reside in Thornhill and work in Toronto. By the 1920s, automobiles also facilitated travel along Yonge Street. =20th and 21st centuries= In 1931, Thornhill became a \\"Police Village\\"; before that time, Thornhill had no independent status and was split between the townships of Vaughan and Markham along Yonge Street, since the creation of municipal government in 1850. Before 1931, each township administered its half of the village. The creation of the Police Village gave Thornhill its own political boundaries. The village was headed by a reeve. In 1971, York Region was created, part of a wave of municipal re-organization which converted many townships into towns and eliminated many of the municipal forms of organization which had existed within those townships. The establishment of a regional administration effectively eliminated the Police Village of Thornhill. Thornhill's administration reverted to Markham and Vaughan, which were enlarged in territory and upgraded to Town status at this time. However, many social institutions remained organized around the former municipal entities eliminated in 1971. Like neighbouring communities such as Woodbridge, Maple, and Unionville ‚Äì and more so than was the case for historic suburban communities within the City of Toronto ‚Äì community organizations such as local newspapers, and sports teams continued to operate under a Thornhill administrative structure. As an example, until the mid-1990s residents of Thornhill who wanted to play high-level hockey were required to play for a Thornhill team. While the old village of Thornhill revolved around Yonge Street between Centre and John Streets, the neighbourhood is typically thought to be between Dufferin Street to the west, Highway 7 to the north, Steeles Avenue to the south, and Highway 404 to the east. =Suburbanization= Thornhill's growth since the 1960s and 1970s has been largely connected to its location bordering what is now the City of Toronto. Growth has continued apace. Developments have sprung up across various areas of Thornhill in each of the municipal districts which encompass Thornhill, following the development patterns of the Greater Toronto Area. Demographics =Ethnicity= Thornhill has a very ethnically diverse population. It is home to a significant number of Jewish, Chinese, Korean, Iranian, and Italian people. According to 2001 Federal Census data, the electoral district of Thornhill (which is not entirely congruent with the neighbourhood) consists of Chinese, the largest visible minority, accounting for almost 11% of total residents (12,610), followed by South Asian (6,595), Black (2,665), Korean (2,660), Filipino (2,535), and West Asian (2,355). According to the 2009 Report of Canada's Demographic Task Force, Thornhill-Vaughan is home to more than 33,000 members of the Jewish community. Government Thornhill is split into Wards 4 and 5 in the City of Vaughan and Ward 1 in the City of Markham. It is represented by Sandra Yeung Racco (Vaughan Ward 4), Alan Shefman (Vaughan Ward 5), and Keith Irish (Markham Ward 1). Thornhill is also a federal and provincial riding. The Member of Parliament for Thornhill is Peter Kent (Conservative), and the Member of Provincial Parliament is Gila Martow (Progressive Conservative). Infrastructure =Healthcare= There are no general hospitals in Thornhill, but a private hospital, Shouldice Hernia Centre, is located there. =Thornhill Community Centre= Located at Bayview and John Street, the community centre features a double arena (home to the Thornhill Skating Club, Markham Majors and Islanders hockey clubs with east rink named for Bib Sherwood in 1999), therapy pool, gym room, running track, multi use rooms and Markham Public Library branch. The complex was opened in 1975. The community centre hosted the Markham Thunder of the Canadian Women's Hockey League from 2017 to 2019. Thornlea Pool is public swimming pool located further north of the community centre.

She is a member by birth of the princely family of F√ºrstenberg and a former member by marriage of the princely family of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. Background The daughter of Prince Tassilo zu F√ºrstenberg and his first wife, Clara Agnelli, she was born in Rome, Italy. Her paternal grandparents were Prince Karl Emil von F√ºrstenberg (1867‚Äì1945) and the Hungarian Countess M√°ria Matild Georgina Festetics von Tolna (24 May 1881‚Äì 2 March 1953), who was the daughter of Prince Tassilo Festetics von Tolna and Lady Mary Victoria Douglas-Hamilton. Her maternal great-grandmother was an American heiress, Jane Bourbon del Monte, Princess di San Faustino, born Campbell, and the elder of her two brothers was Prince Egon von F√ºrstenberg, a fashion designer. She also has a younger brother, Prince Sebastian. Her former sister-in-law is the fashion designer Diane von F√ºrstenberg, and an uncle was Gianni Agnelli, the chairman of FIAT. She is a first cousin of Prince Karl von Schwarzenberg, a former Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic. She speaks several languages, including Italian, French, German, Spanish and English. She was reportedly an occasional companion and potential wife of the widowed Prince Rainier III of Monaco, but premature speculation in the press by her son about the marriage apparently dissuaded the Prince from making a proposal. Like the late ruler of Monaco, who was her second cousin, she is a great-grandchild of the Scottish aristocrat Lady Mary Victoria Hamilton, the first wife of Prince Albert I of Monaco. However, Princess Ira is descended from Lady Mary's second marriage with Tassilo Festetics von Tolna, a Hungarian Count and later Prince. Tassilo's sister, Countess Georgine Ernestine Festetics von Tolna , was the great-grandmother of the current ruler of Liechtenstein, making Princess Ira a third cousin of Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein. The princess is patron of a number of charities, including the Children of Africa Foundation set up by Dominique Ouattara. First marriage Ira von F√ºrstenberg with her brothers in 1955 Her first husband, whom she married at Venice, Italy, on 17 September 1955, was Prince Alfonso of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (1924‚Äì2003), who founded the Marbella Club, a Spanish resort. At the time of the wedding, the bride was 15 and the groom was 31. They were divorced in 1960, and the marriage was annulled in 1969.

The coherer was a primitive form of radio signal detector used in the first radio receivers during the wireless telegraphy era at the beginning of the 20th century. Its use in radio was based on the 1890 findings of French physicist √âdouard Branly and adapted by other physicists and inventors over the next ten years. The device consists of a tube or capsule containing two electrodes spaced a small distance apart with loose metal filings in the space between. When a radio frequency signal is applied to the device, the metal particles would cling together or \\"cohere\\", reducing the initial high resistance of the device, thereby allowing a much greater direct current to flow through it. In a receiver, the current would activate a bell, or a Morse paper tape recorder to make a record of the received signal. The metal filings in the coherer remained conductive after the signal (pulse) ended so that the coherer had to be \\"decohered\\" by tapping it with a clapper actuated by an electromagnet, each time a signal was received, thereby restoring the coherer to its original state. Coherers remained in widespread use until about 1907, when they were replaced by more sensitive electrolytic and crystal detectors. History The behavior of particles or metal filings in the presence of electricity or electric sparks was noticed in many experiments well before √âdouard Branly's 1890 paper and even before there was proof of the theory of electromagnetism.L. W. Turner, Electronics Engineer's Reference Book, Butterworth-Heinemann - 2013, pages 2-3, 2-4 In 1835 Swedish scientist Peter Samuel MunkPeter Samuel Munk af Rosenschold lecture assistant in Chemistry at the University of Lund was born at Lund in 1804 and died in 1860 (Michael Faraday, Christian Friedirich Schoenbein, The letters of Faraday and Schoenbein 1836-1862: With notes, comments and references to contemporary letters, Williams & Norgate - 1899, page 54) noticed a change of resistance in a mixture of metal filings in the presence of spark discharge from a Leyden jar.Eric Falcon and Bernard Castaing, Electrical conductivity in granular media and Branly‚Äôs coherer: A simple experiment, page 1 In 1850 Pierre Guitard found that when dusty air was electrified, the particles would tend to collect in the form of strings. The idea that particles could react to electricity was used in English engineer Samuel Alfred Varley's 1866 lightning bridge, a lightning arrester attached to telegraph lines consisting of a piece of wood with two metal spikes extending into a chamber. The space was filled with powdered carbon that would not allow the low voltage telegraph signals to pass through but it would conduct and ground a high voltage lightning strike.T. K. Sarkar, Robert Mailloux, Arthur A. Oliner, M. Salazar-Palma, Dipak L. Sengupta, History of Wireless, John Wiley & Sons - 2006, pages 261-262 In 1879 the Welsh scientist David Edward Hughes found that loose contacts between a carbon rod and two carbon blocks as well as the metallic granules in a microphone he was developing responded to sparks generated in a nearby apparatus. Temistocle Calzecchi-Onesti in Italy began studying the anomalous change in the resistance of thin metallic films and metal particles at Fermo/Monterubbiano. He found that copper filings between two brass plates would cling together, becoming conductive, when he applied a voltage to them. He also found that other types of metal filings would have the same reaction to electric sparks occurring at a distance, a phenomenon that he thought could be used for detecting lightning strikes. Calzecchi-Onesti's papers were published in il Nuovo Cimento in 1884, 1885 and 1886. Branly's electrical circuit tube filled with iron filings (later called a \\"coherer\\") In 1890, French physicist √âdouard Branly published On the Changes in Resistance of Bodies under Different Electrical Conditions in a French Journal where he described his thorough investigation of the effect of minute electrical charges on metal and many types of metal filings. In one type of circuit, filings were placed in a tube of glass or ebonite, held between two metal plates. When an electric discharge was produced in the neighbourhood of the circuit, a large deviation was seen on the attached galvanometer needle. He noted the filings in the tube would react to the electric discharge even when the tube was placed in another room 20 yards away. Branly went on to devise many types of these devices based on \\"imperfect\\" metal contacts. Branly's filings tube came to light in 1892 in Great Britain when it was described by Dr. Dawson Turner at a meeting of the British Association in Edinburgh.Sungook Hong, Wireless: From Marconi's Black-box to the Audion, page 4E C Green, The Development of the Coherer And Some Theories of Coherer Action, Scientific American: Supplement, Volume 84 - 1917, page 268 The Scottish electrical engineer and astronomer George Forbes suggested that Branly's filings tube might be reacting in the presence of Hertzian waves, a type of air-borne electromagnetic radiation proven to exist by German physicist Heinrich Hertz (later called radio waves). Marconi's 1896 coherer receiver, at the Oxford Museum of the History of Science, UK. The coherer is on right, with the decoherer mechanism behind it. The relay is in the cylindrical metal container (center) to shield the coherer from the RF noise from its contacts. In 1893 physicist W.B. Croft exhibited Branly's experiments at a meeting of the Physical Society in London. It was unclear to Croft and others whether the filings in the Branly tube were reacting to sparks or the light from the sparks. George Minchin noticed the Branly tube might be reacting to Hertzian waves the same way his solar cell did and wrote the paper \\"The Action of Electromagnetic Radiation on Films containing Metallic Powders\\". These papers were read by English physicist Oliver Lodge who saw this as a way to build a much improved Hertzian wave detector. On 1 June 1894, a few months after the death of Heinrich Hertz, Oliver Lodge delivered a memorial lecture on Hertz where he demonstrated the properties of \\"Hertzian waves\\" (radio), including transmitting them over a short distance, using an improved version of Branly's filings tube, which Lodge had named the \\"coherer\\", as a detector. In May 1895, after reading about Lodge's demonstrations, the Russian physicist Alexander Popov built a \\"Hertzian wave\\" (radio wave) based lightning detector using a coherer. That same year, Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi demonstrated a wireless telegraphy system using Hertzian waves (radio), based on a coherer. The coherer was replaced in receivers by the simpler and more sensitive electrolytic and crystal detectors around 1907, and became obsolete. One minor use of the coherer in modern times was by Japanese tin-plate toy manufacturer Matsudaya Toy Co. who beginning 1957 used a spark-gap transmitter and coherer- based receiver in a range of radio-controlled (RC) toys, called Radicon (abbreviation for Radio-Controlled) toys. Several different types using the same RC system were commercially sold, including a Radicon Boat (very rare), Radicon Oldsmobile Car (rare) and a Radicon Bus (the most popular). Operation The circuit of a coherer receiver, that recorded the received code on a Morse paper tape recorder. Unlike modern AM radio stations that transmit a continuous radio frequency, whose amplitude (power) is modulated by an audio signal, the first radio transmitters transmitted information by wireless telegraphy (radiotelegraphy), the transmitter was turned on and off (on-off keying) to produce different length pulses of unmodulated carrier wave signal, \\"dots\\" and \\"dashes\\", that spelled out text messages in Morse code. As a result, early radio receiving apparatus merely had to detect the presence or absence of the radio signal, not convert it to audio. The device that did this was called a detector. The coherer was the most successful of many detector devices that were tried in the early days of radio. The operation of the coherer is based on the phenomenon of electrical contact resistance. Specifically as metal particles cohere (cling together), they conduct electricity much better after being subjected to radio frequency electricity. The radio signal from the antenna was applied directly across the coherer's electrodes. When the radio signal from a \\"dot\\" or \\"dash\\" came in, the coherer would become conductive. The coherer's electrodes were also attached to a DC circuit powered by a battery that created a \\"click\\" sound in earphones or a telegraph sounder, or a mark on a paper tape, to record the signal. Unfortunately, the reduction in the coherer's electrical resistance persisted after the radio signal was removed. This was a problem because the coherer had to be ready immediately to receive the next \\"dot\\" or \\"dash\\". Therefore, a decoherer mechanism was added to tap the coherer, mechanically disturbing the particles to reset it to the high resistance state. Coherence of particles by radio waves is an obscure phenomenon that is not well understood even today. Recent experiments with particle coherers seem to have confirmed the hypothesis that the particles cohere by a micro-weld phenomenon caused by radio frequency electricity flowing across the small contact area between particles.E. Falcon, B. Castaing, and M. Creyssels: Nonlinear electrical conductivity in a 1D granular medium, Laboratoire de Physique de l‚ÄôEcole Normale Sup'erieure de Lyon UMR 5672 -46 all'ee d‚ÄôItalie, 69007 Lyon, France The underlying principle of so-called \\"imperfect contact\\" coherers is also not well understood, but may involve a kind of tunneling of charge carriers across an imperfect junction between conductors. Application The coherer used in practical receivers was a glass tube, sometimes evacuated, which was about half filled with sharply cut metal filings, often part silver and part nickel. Silver electrodes made contact with the metal particles on both ends. In some coherers, the electrodes were slanted so the width of the gap occupied by the filings could be varied by rotating the tube about its long axis, thus adjusting its sensitivity to the prevailing conditions. In operation, the coherer is included in two separate electrical circuits. One is the antenna- ground circuit shown in the untuned receiver circuit diagram below. The other is the battery-sounder relay circuit including battery B1 and relay R in the diagram. A radio signal from the antenna-ground circuit \\"turns on\\" the coherer, enabling current flow in the battery-sounder circuit, activating the sounder, S. The coils, L, act as RF chokes to prevent the RF signal power from leaking away through the relay circuit. A radio receiver circuit using a coherer detector (C). The \\"tapper\\" (decoherer) is not shown. One electrode, A, of the coherer, (C, in the left diagram) is connected to the antenna and the other electrode, B, to ground. A series combination of a battery, B1, and a relay, R, is also attached to the two electrodes. When the signal from a spark gap transmitter is received, the filings tend to cling to each other, reducing the resistance of the coherer. When the coherer conducts better, battery B1 supplies enough current through the coherer to activate relay R, which connects battery B2 to the telegraph sounder S, giving an audible click. In some applications, a pair of headphones replaced the telegraph sounder, being much more sensitive to weak signals, or a Morse recorder which recorded the dots and dashes of the signal on paper tape. A coherer with electromagnet- operated \\"tapper\\" (decoherer), built by early radio researcher Emile Guarini around 1904. The problem of the filings continuing to cling together and conduct after the removal of the signal was solved by tapping or shaking the coherer after the arrival of each signal, shaking the filings and raising the resistance of the coherer to the original value. This apparatus was called a decoherer. This process was referred to as 'decohering' the device and was subject to much innovation during the life of the popular use of this component. Tesla, for example, invented a coherer in which the tube rotated continually along its axis. In later practical receivers the decoherer was a clapper similar to an electric bell, operated by an electromagnet powered by the coherer current itself. When the radio wave turned on the coherer, the DC current from the battery flowed through the electromagnet, pulling the arm over to give the coherer a tap. This returned the coherer to the nonconductive state, turning off the electromagnet current, and the arm sprang back. If the radio signal was still present, the coherer would immediately turn on again, pulling the clapper over to give it another tap, which would turn it off again. The result was a constant \\"trembling\\" of the clapper during the period that the radio signal was on, during the \\"dots\\" and \\"dashes\\" of the Morse code signal. An automatic braking system for rail locomotives, patented in 1907, used a coherer to detect electrical oscillations in a continuous aerial running along the track. If the block ahead of the train were occupied the oscillations were interrupted and the coherer, acting through a relay, showed a warning and applied the brakes. Imperfect junction coherer There are several variations of what is known as the imperfect junction coherer. The principle of operation (microwelding) suggested above for the filings coherer may be less likely to apply to this type because there is no need for decohering. An iron and mercury variation on this device was used by Marconi for the first transatlantic radio message. An earlier form was invented by Jagdish Chandra Bose in 1899.Bose article by Varun Aggarwal The device consisted of a small metallic cup containing a pool of mercury covered by a very thin insulating film of oil; above the surface of the oil, a small iron disc is suspended. By means of an adjusting screw the lower edge of the disc is made to touch the oil-covered mercury with a pressure small enough not to puncture the film of oil. Its principle of operation is not well understood. The action of detection occurs when the radio frequency signal somehow breaks down the insulating film of oil, allowing the device to conduct, operating the receiving sounder wired in series. This form of coherer is self-restoring and needs no decohering. In 1899, Bose announced the development of an \\"iron- mercury-iron coherer with telephone detector\\" in a paper presented at the Royal Society, London.Bondyopadhyay (1988) He also later received , \\"Detector for electrical disturbances\\" (1904), for a specific electromagnetic receiver. Anticoherer Limitations of coherers Because they are threshold voltage detectors, coherers had difficulty discriminating between the impulsive signals of spark-gap transmitters, and other impulsive electrical noise:quoted in on Stay Tuned website Coherers were also finicky to adjust and not very sensitive. Another problem was that, because of the cumbersome mechanical \\"decohering\\" mechanism, the coherer was limited to a receiving speed of 12 - 15 words per minute of Morse code, while telegraph operators could send at rates of 50 WPM, and paper tape machines at 100 WPM. More important for the future, the coherer could not detect AM (radio) transmissions. As a simple switch that registered the presence or absence of radio waves, the coherer could detect the on-off keying of wireless telegraphy transmitters, but it could not rectify nor demodulate the waveforms of AM radiotelephone signals, which began to be experimented with in the first years of the 20th century. This problem was solved by the rectification capability of the hot wire barretter and electrolytic detector, developed by Reginald Fessenden around 1902. These were replaced by the crystal detector around 1907, and then around 1912-1918 by vacuum tube technologies such as John Ambrose Fleming's thermionic diode and Lee De Forest's Audion (triode) tube.

It is sometimes described as duty-, obligation-, or rule-based ethics.Waller, Bruce N. 2005. Consider Ethics: Theory, Readings, and Contemporary Issues. New York: Pearson Longman. p. 23. Deontological ethics is commonly contrasted to consequentialism,Flew, Antony. 1979. \\"Consequentialism.\\" Pp. 73 in A Dictionary of Philosophy (2nd Ed.). New York: St. Martin's. virtue ethics, and pragmatic ethics. In this terminology, action is more important than the consequences. The term deontological was first used to describe the current, specialised definition by C. D. Broad in his 1930 book, Five Types of Ethical Theory.Beauchamp, Tom L. 1991. Philosophical Ethics: An Introduction to Moral Philosophy (2nd ed.). New York: McGraw Hill. p. 171. Older usage of the term goes back to Jeremy Bentham, who coined it prior to 1816 as a synonym of dicastic or censorial ethics (i.e., ethics based on judgement).Bentham, Jeremy. 1816. Chrestomathia. London. p. 213‚Äì14: \\"For a synonym, Dicastic Ethics may have the single-worded appellative Deontology.*\\" Corresponding footnote: \\"*[Deontology.] From two Greek words, the first of which signifies fit, fitting, right, becoming, proper. Deontology‚Äîan account or indication of that which, on the occasion in question, whatsoever it be, is‚Äî(i.e. by him who speaks or writes, is regarded as being)‚Äîfit, fitting, becoming, proper. It is in sound only, and not in signification, that it has any connexion with the word [ontology], employed above. Applied to every branch of Ethics, taken in the largest sense of the word Ethics, the use of such a word as Deontology affords a promise of being attended with considerable convenience. It will accord equally well with every system which ever has been, or ever can be, devised, in relation to the foundation of moral obligation :‚Äîin the use of it, no such incongruity and presumption is involved, as that which is called petitio principii‚Äîi.e. a begging of the question‚Äîan assumption of the matter in dispute.\\"Bentham, Jeremy. 1834. Deontology or, The Science of Morality, edited by J. Bowring. London: Longman, Rees, Orme, Browne, Green, and Longman. p. 21: \\"Deontology is derived from the Greek words, (that which is proper) and , knowledge ‚Äì meaning the knowledge of what is right and proper; and it is here specially applied to the subject of morals, or that part of the field of action which is not the object of public legislation. As an art, it is the doing what is fit to be done; as a science, the knowing what is fit to be done on every occasion.\\" The more general sense of the word is retained in French, especially in the term code de d√©ontologie (ethical code), in the context of professional ethics. Depending on the system of deontological ethics under consideration, a moral obligation may arise from an external or internal source, such as a set of rules inherent to the universe (ethical naturalism), religious law, or a set of personal or cultural values (any of which may be in conflict with personal desires). Much of definitions on deontological ethics is found in an ancient Tamil literature Thirukural, which is believed to be written in between 300 BCE and 5th century CE. Deontological philosophies There are numerous formulations of deontological ethics. =Kantianism= right Immanuel Kant's theory of ethics is considered deontological for several different reasons.Orend, Brian. 2000. War and International Justice: A Kantian Perspective. West Waterloo, ON: Wilfrid Laurier University Press. p. 19.Kelly, Eugene. 2006. The Basics of Western Philosophy. Greenwood Press. p. 160. First, Kant argues that in order to act in the morally right way, people must act from duty (Pflicht). Abbott, Thomas Kingsmill, trans. 1889. The Metaphysical Elements of Ethics. [Preface and Introduction to Metaphysische Anfangsgr√ºnde der Tugendlehre, 1797]. Abbott's deontology translates Kant's . Second, Kant argued that it was not the consequences of actions that make them right or wrong, but the motives of the person who carries out the action. Kant's first argument begins with the premise that the highest good must be both good in itself and good without qualification.Kant, Immanuel. 1785. \\"Transition from the Common Rational Knowledge of Morals to the Philosophical.\\" ¬ß 1 in Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals. Something is \\"good in itself\\" when it is intrinsically good; and is \\"good without qualification\\" when the addition of that thing never makes a situation ethically worse. Kant then argues that those things that are usually thought to be good, such as intelligence, perseverance, and pleasure, fail to be either intrinsically good or good without qualification. Pleasure, for example, appears not to be good without qualification, because when people take pleasure in watching someone suffer, this seems to make the situation ethically worse. He concludes that there is only one thing that is truly good: Kant then argues that the consequences of an act of willing cannot be used to determine that the person has a good will; good consequences could arise by accident from an action that was motivated by a desire to cause harm to an innocent person, and bad consequences could arise from an action that was well-motivated. Instead, he claims, a person has a good will when he \\"acts out of respect for the moral law.\\" People \\"act out of respect for the moral law\\" when they act in some way because they have a duty to do so. Thus, the only thing that is truly good in itself is a good will, and a good will is only good when the willer chooses to do something because it is that person's duty, i.e. out of respect for the law. He defines respect as \\"the concept of a worth which thwarts my self-love.\\"Kant, Immanuel. 1785. Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals (10th ed.), translated by T. K. Abbott. Project Gutenberg. p. 23. Kant's three significant formulations of the categorical imperative are: * Act only according to that maxim by which you can also will that it would become a universal law; * Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end; and * Every rational being must so act as if he were through his maxim always a legislating member in a universal kingdom of ends. Kant argued that the only absolutely good thing is a good will, and so the single determining factor of whether an action is morally right is the will, or motive of the person doing it. If they are acting on a bad maxim, e.g. 'I will lie', then their action is wrong, even if some good consequences come of it. In his essay, \\"On a Supposed Right to Lie Because of Philanthropic Concerns\\", arguing against the position of Benjamin Constant, Des r√©actions politiques, Kant states that:\\"√úber ein vermeintes Recht aus Menschenliebe zu l√ºgen\\", Berlinische Bl√§tter 1 (1797), 301‚Äì314; edited in: Werke in zw√∂lf B√§nden, vol. 8, Frankfurt am Main (1977), zeno.org/nid/20009192123. > Hence a lie defined merely as an intentionally untruthful declaration to > another man does not require the additional condition that it must do harm > to another, as jurists require in their definition (mendacium est > falsiloquium in praeiudicium alterius). For a lie always harms another; if > not some human being, then it nevertheless does harm to humanity in general, > inasmuch as it vitiates the very source of right [].‚Ä¶ All practical > principles of right must contain rigorous truth.‚Ä¶ This is because such > exceptions would destroy the universality on account of which alone they > bear the name of principles. =Divine command theory= Although not all deontologists are religious, some believe in the divine command theory, which is actually a cluster of related theories that essentially state that an action is right if God has decreed that it is right.Wierenga, Edward. 1983. \\"A Defensible Divine Command Theory.\\" No√ªs 17(3):387‚Äì407. According to English philosopher Ralph Cudworth, William of Ockham, Ren√© Descartes, and 18th-century Calvinists all accepted various versions of this moral theory, as they all held that moral obligations arise from God's commands.Cudworth, Ralph. [1731] 1996. A Treatise Concerning Eternal and Immutable Morality, edited by S. Hutton. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. The divine command theory is a form of deontology because, according to it, the rightness of any action depends upon that action being performed because it is a duty, not because of any good consequences arising from that action. If God commands people not to work on Sabbath, then people act rightly if they do not work on Sabbath because God has commanded that they do not do so. If they do not work on Sabbath because they are lazy, then their action is not, truly speaking, \\"right\\" even though the actual physical action performed is the same. If God commands not to covet a neighbour's goods, this theory holds that it would be immoral to do so, even if coveting provides the beneficial outcome of a drive to succeed or do well. One thing that clearly distinguishes Kantian deontologism from divine command deontology is that Kantianism maintains that man, as a rational being, makes the moral law universal, whereas divine command maintains that God makes the moral law universal. =Contemporary deontology= Contemporary deontologists (i.e., scholars born in the first half of the 20th century) include J√≥zef Maria Boche≈Ñski, Thomas Nagel, Thomas Scanlon, and Roger Scruton. Boche≈Ñski (1965) makes a distinction between deontic and epistemic authority:Boche≈Ñski, J√≥zef. 1965. \\"Analysis of authority.\\" Pp. 162‚Äì73 in The Logic of Religion. New York: New York University Press. . * A typical example of epistemic authority in Boche≈Ñski's usage would be \\"the relation of a teacher to his students.\\" A teacher has epistemic authority when making declarative sentences that the student presumes is reliable knowledge and appropriate but feels no obligation to accept or obey. * An example of deontic authority would be \\"the relation between an employer and his employee.\\" An employer has deontic authority in the act of issuing an order that the employee is obliged to accept and obey regardless of its reliability or appropriateness.Bro≈ºek, Anna. 2013. \\"Boche≈Ñski on authority.\\" Studies in East European Thought 65(1):115‚Äì33. . Scruton (2017), in his book On Human Nature, is critical of consequentialism and similar ethical theories, such as hedonism and utilitarianism, instead proposing a deontological ethical approach. He implies that proportional duty and obligation are essential components of the ways in which we decide to act, and he defends natural law against opposing theories. He also expresses admiration for virtue ethics, and believes that the two ethical theories are not, as is frequently portrayed, mutually exclusive. =Deontology and consequentialism=  Principle of permissible harm  Frances Kamm's \\"Principle of Permissible Harm\\" (1996) is an effort to derive a deontological constraint that coheres with our considered case judgments while also relying heavily on Kant's categorical imperative.Kamm, Frances M. 1996. Morality, Mortality Vol. II: Rights, Duties, and Status. New York: Oxford University Press. The principle states that one may harm in order to save more if and only if the harm is an effect or an aspect of the greater good itself. This principle is meant to address what Kamm feels are most people's considered case judgments, many of which involve deontological intuitions. For instance, Kamm argues that we believe it would be impermissible to kill one person to harvest his organs in order to save the lives of five others. Yet, we think it is morally permissible to divert a runaway trolley that would otherwise kill five innocent, immobile people, onto a sidetrack where only one innocent and immobile person will be killed. Kamm believes the Principle of Permissible Harm explains the moral difference between these and other cases, and more importantly expresses a constraint telling us exactly when we may not act to bring about good ends‚Äîsuch as in the organ harvesting case. In 2007, Kamm published Intricate Ethics, a book that presents a new theory, the \\"Doctrine of Productive Purity\\", that incorporates aspects of her \\"Principle of Permissible Harm\\".Kamm, Frances M. 2007. \\"Toward the Essence of Nonconsequentialist Constraints on Harming.\\" Ch. 5 in Intricate Ethics: Rights, Responsibilities, and Permissible Harm. Oxford: Oxford University Press. . Like the \\"Principle\\", the \\"Doctrine of Productive Purity\\" is an attempt to provide a deontological prescription for determining the circumstances in which people are permitted to act in a way that harms others.Waugh, Laurence Francis Hogan. 2015. \\"Harming the innocent to save lives A critique of the Doctrine of Productive Purity\\" (Masters Research thesis). School of Historical and Philosophical Studies - Theses. University of Melbourne. .  Virtues and consequences  Attempts have been made to reconcile deontology with virtue-based ethics and consequentialism. Iain King's 2008 book How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time uses quasi-realism and a modified form of utilitarianism to develop deontological principles that are compatible with ethics based on virtues and consequences. King develops a hierarchy of principles to link his meta-ethics, which are more inclined towards consequentialism, with the deontological conclusions he presents in his book. Page 220 of this book lists 14 deontological principles, which King describes as \\"The first fourteen principles of right and wrong.\\" See also * Convention (norm) * Categorical imperative * Deontic logic * Deontological libertarianism * Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development * Meta-ethics * Moral responsibility * Norm (philosophy) * Rule according to higher law Notes =Bibliography= * Beauchamp, Tom L. 1991.

The vacuum expectation value of an operator O is usually denoted by \\\\langle O\\\\rangle. One of the most widely used examples of an observable physical effect that results from the vacuum expectation value of an operator is the Casimir effect. This concept is important for working with correlation functions in quantum field theory. It is also important in spontaneous symmetry breaking. Examples are: *The Higgs field has a vacuum expectation value of 246 GeV This nonzero value underlies the Higgs mechanism of the Standard Model. This value is given by v = 1/\\\\sqrt{\\\\sqrt 2 G_F^0} = 2M_W/g \\\\approx 246.22\\\\, \\\\rm{GeV}, where MW is the mass of the W Boson, G_F^0 the reduced Fermi constant, and the weak isospin coupling, in natural units. *The chiral condensate in Quantum chromodynamics, about a factor of a thousand smaller than the above, gives a large effective mass to quarks, and distinguishes between phases of quark matter. This underlies the bulk of the mass of most hadrons. *The gluon condensate in Quantum chromodynamics may also be partly responsible for masses of hadrons. The observed Lorentz invariance of space-time allows only the formation of condensates which are Lorentz scalars and have vanishing charge. Thus fermion condensates must be of the form \\\\langle\\\\overline\\\\psi\\\\psi\\\\rangle, where œà is the fermion field. Similarly a tensor field, GŒºŒΩ, can only have a scalar expectation value such as \\\\langle G_{\\\\mu u}G^{\\\\mu u}\\\\rangle. In some vacua of string theory, however, non- scalar condensates are found. If these describe our universe, then Lorentz symmetry violation may be observable.

It is the view that jurisprudence should emulate the methods of natural science, i.e., rely on empirical evidence. Hypotheses must be tested against observations of the world. Legal realists believe that legal science should only investigate law with the value-free methods of natural sciences, rather than through philosophical inquiries into the nature and meaning of the law that are separate and distinct from the law as it is actually practiced. Indeed, legal realism asserts that the law cannot be separated from its application, nor can it be understood outside of its application. As such, legal realism emphasizes law as it actually exists, rather than the law as it ought to be. Locating the meaning of law in areas like legal opinions issued by judges and their deference or dismissal of the past precedent and the doctrine of stare decisis, it stresses the importance of understanding the factors involved in judicial decision making. Overview Legal realism is associated with American jurisprudence during the 1920s and 1930s, particularly amongst federal judges and lawyers within the Roosevelt administration. Notable jurists associated with legal realism include Felix Cohen, Morris Cohen, Arthur Corbin, Walter Wheeler Cook, Robert Hale, Wesley Hohfeld, Karl Llewellyn, Underhill Moore, Herman Oliphant and Warren Seavey, many of whom were associated with Yale Law School. As Keith Bybee argues, \\"legal realism exposed the role played by politics in judicial decision-making and, in doing so, called into question conventional efforts to anchor judicial power on a fixed, impartial foundation.\\" Contemporary legal scholars working within the Law and Society tradition have expanded upon the foundations set by legal realism to postulate what has been referred to as new legal realism. As a form of jurisprudence, legal realism is defined by its focus on the law as it actually exists in practice, rather than how it exists on the books. To this end, it was primarily concerned with the actions of judges and the factors that influenced processes of judicial decision making. As Karl Llewellyn argues, ‚Äú[b]ehind decisions stand judges; judges are men; as men they have human backgrounds.‚Äù The law, therefore, did not exist in a metaphysical realm of fundamental rules or principles, but was inseparable from human action and the power of judges to determine the law. In order to understand the decisions and actions of legal actors, legal realists turned to the ideas of the social sciences in order to understand the human behavior and relationships that culminated in a given legal outcome.For example, Jerome Frank frequently turned to the insights of psychoanalysis (which were then authoritative regarding human psychology) to understand the behavior and decisions of legal parties. See American legal realists believe that there is more to adjudication than the \\"mechanical\\" application of known legal principles to uncontroversial fact-finding in line with the arguments of legal formalism. Some realists believe that one can never be sure that the facts and law identified in the judge's reasons were the actual reasons for the judgment, whereas other realists accept that a judge's reasons can often be relied upon, but not all of the time. Realists believe that the legal principles that legal formalism treat as uncontroversial actually hide contentious political and moral choices. Due to their value-free approach, legal realists are opposed to natural law traditions. Legal realists contend that these traditions are historical and/or social phenomena and that they should be explained by a variety of psychological and sociological hypotheses, conceiving of legal phenomena as determined by human behavior that should be investigated empirically, rather than according to theoretical assumptions about the law. As a result, legal realism stands in opposition to most versions of legal positivism. Realism was treated as a conceptual claim for much of the late 20th century due to H. L. A. Hart's misunderstanding of the theory. Hart was an analytical legal philosopher who was interested in conceptual analysis of concepts such as the concept of 'law'. This entailed identifying the necessary and sufficient conditions for the use of the concept 'law'. When realists such as Oliver Wendell Holmes pointed out that individuals embroiled in the legal system generally wanted to know what was going to happen, Hart assumed that they were offering the necessary and sufficient conditions for the use of the concept 'law'. Nowadays, legal theorists tend to recognise that the realists and the conceptual lawyers were interested in different questions. Realists are interested in methods of predicting judges with more accuracy, whereas conceptual lawyers are interested in the correct use of legal concepts. Legal realism was primarily a reaction to the legal formalism of the late 19th century and early 20th century, and was the dominant approach for much of the early 20th century. It succeeded in its negative aspiration of casting doubt upon formalist assumptions that judges always did what they said so that it is often said that 'we are all realists now.' However, realism failed in its positive aspiration of discovering a better way of predicting how judges would behave than relying on the reasons given by judges. A theory of law and legal reasoning that arose in the early decades of the twentieth century broadly characterized by the claim that law can be best understood by focusing on what judges actually do in deciding cases, rather than on what they say they are doing. The central target of legal realism was legal formalism: the classical view that judges don't make law, but mechanically apply it by logically deducing uniquely correct legal conclusions from a set of clear, consistent, and comprehensive legal rules. American legal realism has aptly been described as \\"the most important indigenous jurisprudential movement in the United States during the twentieth century\\". Forerunners Although the American legal realist movement first emerged as a cohesive intellectual force in the 1920s, it drew heavily upon a number of prior thinkers and was influenced by broader cultural forces. In the early years of the twentieth century, formalist approaches to the law had been forcefully criticized by thinkers such as Roscoe Pound, John Chipman Gray, and Benjamin Cardozo. Philosophers such as John Dewey had held up empirical science as a model of all intelligent inquiry, and argued that law should be seen as a practical instrument for advancing human welfare. Outside the realm of law, in fields such as economics and history, there was a general \\"revolt against formalism,\\" a reaction in favor of more empirical ways of doing philosophy and the human sciences.See generally, But by far the most important intellectual influence on the legal realists was the thought of the American jurist and Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. =Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.= Holmes is a towering figure in American legal thought for many reasons, but what the realists drew most from Holmes was his famous prediction theory of law, his utilitarian approach to legal reasoning, and his \\"realist\\" insistence that judges, in deciding cases, are not simply deducing legal conclusions with inexorable, machine-like logic, but are influenced by ideas of fairness, public policy, and other personal and conventional values. All these themes can be found in Holmes's famous 1897 essay, \\"The Path of the Law\\". There Holmes attacks formalist approaches to judicial decision making and states a pragmatic definition of law: \\"The prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law\\".Holmes, Oliver Wendell Jr., \\"The Path of the Law\\", 10 Harvard Law Review 457 (1897). If law is prophecy, Holmes continues, we must reject the view of \\"text writers\\" who tell us that law \\"is something different from what is decided by the courts of Massachusetts or England, that it is a system of reason that is a deduction from principles of ethics or admitted axioms or what not, which may or may not coincide with the decisions\\". Holmes next introduces his most important and influential argument, the \\"bad-man\\" theory of law: \\"[I]f we take the view of our friend the bad man we shall find that he does not care two straws\\" about either the morality or the logic of the law. For the bad man, \\"legal duty\\" signifies only \\"a prophecy that if he does certain things he will be subjected to disagreeable consequences by way of imprisonment or compulsory payment\\". The bad man cares nothing for legal theorizing and concerns himself only with practical consequences. In the spirit of pragmatism, Holmes suggests that this is a useful way of laying bare the true meaning of legal concepts. The utilitarian or instrumentalist flavor of \\"The Path of the Law\\" also found favor with the realists. The purpose of the law, Holmes insisted, was the deterrence of undesirable social consequences: \\"I think that the judges themselves have failed adequately to recognize their duty of weighing considerations of social advantage.\\" Before the Civil War, this conception of adjudication as a form of social engineering had been widely shared by American judges, but in the late nineteenth century it had fallen out of favor. One of the aspirations of both Holmes and the realists was to revive it. Key themes Drawing upon Holmes and other critics of legal formalism, a number of iconoclastic legal scholars launched the legal realist movement in the 1920s and 30s. Among the leading legal realists were Karl Llewellyn, Jerome Frank, Herman Oliphant, Underhill Moore, Walter Wheeler Cook, Leon Green, and Felix Cohen. Two American law schools, Yale and Columbia, were hotbeds of realist thought. Realism was a mood more than it was a cohesive movement, but it is possible to identify a number of common themes. These include: * A distrust of the judicial technique of seeming to deduce legal conclusions from so-called rules of law. The realists believed that judges neither do nor should decide cases formalistically. Law is not, as the formalists claimed, a system of rules that is clear, consistent, and complete. Rather, the law is riddled with ambiguities, contradictions, gaps, vague terms, and conflicting rules of interpretation. As a result, there is often (perhaps always) no uniquely correct answer to any hard case that appellate judges decide. Law is incurably \\"indeterminate\\". * A belief in the instrumental nature of the law. Like Dewey and Pound, the realists believed that law does and should serve social ends. Judges unavoidably take account of considerations of fairness and public policy, and they are right to do so.According to legal scholar Brian Leiter, the \\"core claim\\" of legal realism is that judges do not decide cases on purely legal grounds; other factors play a significant and in fact predominant role. Leiter, American Legal Realism, p. 53. * A desire to separate legal from moral elements in the law. The realists were legal positivists who believed that law should be treated scientifically. A clear distinction should be drawn between what the law is and what it should be. Law can only be viewed as an empirical science, as it ought to be, if moralistic notions are either excluded or are translated into empirically verifiable terms. The idea that legal talk of \\"duty\\", \\"right\\", etc. is really just talk about how judges are likely to decide cases, is a clear example of how many realists tried to purge law of moralistic language and translate everything into \\"realistic\\" talk of actual consequences and testable predictions. Criticisms Legal realism had its heyday from the 1920s to the 1940s. In the 1950s, legal realism was largely supplanted by the legal process movement, which viewed law as a process of \\"reasoned elaboration\\" and claimed that appeals to \\"legislative purpose\\" and other well-established legal norms could provide objectively correct answers to most legal questions. In his 1961 book The Concept of Law, British legal theorist H. L. A. Hart dealt what many scholars saw as a \\"decisive blow\\"Leiter, American Legal Realism, p. 61. Leiter argues that Hart's criticism was off the mark, and that it was wrongly assumed to have refuted legal realism. to legal realism, by attacking the predictive theory of law that many realists had taken over from Holmes. Hart pointed out that if a law is just a prediction of what courts will do, a judge pondering the legal merits of a case before him is really asking, \\"How will I decide this case?\\" As Hart notes, this completely misses the fact that judges use legal rules to guide their decisions, not as data to predict their eventual holdings. Many critics have claimed that the realists exaggerated the extent to which law is \\"riddled\\" with gaps, contradictions, and so forth.See, e.g., The fact that most legal questions have simple, clear-cut answers that no lawyer or judge would dispute is difficult to square with the realists' strong claims of pervasive legal \\"indeterminacy\\". Other critics, such as Ronald Dworkin and Lon Fuller, have faulted legal realists for their attempt sharply to separate law and morality. Influence and continuing relevance Though many aspects of legal realism are now seen as exaggerated or outdated, most legal theorists would agree that the realists were successful in their central ambition: to refute \\"formalist\\" or \\"mechanical\\" notions of law and legal reasoning. It is widely accepted today that law is not, and cannot be, an exact science, and that it is important to examine what judges are actually doing in deciding cases, not merely what they say they are doing. As ongoing debates about judicial activism and judicial restraint attest, legal scholars continue to disagree about when, if ever, it is legitimate for judges to \\"make law\\", as opposed to merely \\"following\\" or \\"applying\\" existing law.See, e.g., (contending that law is frequently indeterminate and that judges often do, and should, make law by employing a variety of legal methods and sources, especially \\"purposive\\" interpretation); and (arguing that law is not highly indeterminate and that there is little legitimate leeway for judicial policymaking). But few would disagree with the realists' core claim that judges (for good or ill) are often strongly influenced by their political beliefs, their personal values, their individual personalities, and other extra-legal factors.Leiter, American Legal Realism, p. 60 (noting that \\"[t]he paradigm of scholarship established by the Realists‚Äîcontrasting what courts say they are doing with what they actually do‚Äîis one that has become so much the norm that distinguished scholars practice it without even feeling the need, any longer, to self-identify as Realists\\"). Legal realism and the European Court of Human Rights A statistical natural language processing method has been applied to automatically predict the outcome of cases tried by the European Court of Human Rights (violation or no violation of a specific article) based on their textual contents, reaching a prediction accuracy of 79%. A subsequent qualitative analysis of these results provided some support towards the theory of legal realism. The authors write: \\"In general, and notwithstanding the simplified snapshot of a very complex debate that we just presented, our results could be understood as lending some support to the basic legal realist intuition according to which judges are primarily responsive to non-legal, rather than to legal, reasons when they decide hard cases.\\" See also * Critical legal studies * Legal positivism * New legal realism * Scepticism in law References Further reading  External links *Brian Leiter, American Legal Realism, in The Blackwell Guide to Philosophy of Law and Legal Theory (W.

He became extremely popular, and the nearby town of Semmes, Alabama was named after him. Semmes also maintained a home in Josephine, Alabama on Perdido Bay. He was promoted to the rank of commander in 1855 and was assigned to lighthouse duties until 1860. Following Alabama's secession from the Union, Semmes was offered a Confederate naval appointment by the provisional government; he resigned from the U.S. Navy the next day, February 15, 1861.Fox, p. 38. =Confederate service= Semmes and John McIntosh Kell After appointment to the Confederate Navy as a commander and a futile assignment to purchase arms in the North, Semmes was sent to New Orleans to convert the steamer Habana into the cruiser/commerce raider .Luraghi, pp. 8, 78 In June 1861, Semmes, in Sumter, outran the , breaching the Union blockade of New Orleans, and then launched a brilliant career as one of the greatest commerce raider captains in naval history.John D. Winters, The Civil War in Louisiana, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1963, , p. 48 Semmes's command of CSS Sumter lasted only six months, but during that time he ranged wide, raiding U.S. commercial shipping in both the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean; his actions accounted for the loss of 18 merchant vessels, while always eluding pursuit by Union warships. By January 1862, Sumter required a major overhaul. Semmes's crew surveyed the vessel while in neutral Gibraltar and determined that the repairs to her boilers were too extensive to be completed there. Semmes paid off the crew and laid up the vessel.Fox, p. 47 U.S. Navy vessels maintained a vigil outside the harbor until she was disarmed and sold at auction in December 1862, eventually being renamed and converted to a blockade runner.Silverstone, p. 162 Semmes and several of his officers traveled to England where he was promoted to captain. He then was ordered to the Azores to take up command and oversee the coaling and outfitting with cannon of the newly built British steamer Enrica as a sloop-of-war, which thereafter became the Confederate commerce raider . Semmes sailed on Alabama from August 1862 to June 1864. His operations carried him from the Atlantic to the Gulf of Mexico, around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, and into the Pacific to the East Indies. During this cruise, Alabama captured 65 U.S. merchantmen and quickly destroyed the , off Galveston.Luraghi, p. 228. 1864 engraving of the sinking of CSS Alabama Alabama finally sailed back to the Atlantic and made port in Cherbourg, France, for a much-needed overhaul; she was soon blockaded by the pursuing Union steam sloop-of-war, . Captain Semmes took Alabama out on June 19, 1864, and met the similar Kearsarge in one of the most famous naval engagements of the Civil War. The commander of Kearsarge had, while in port at the Azores the year before, turned his warship into a makeshift partial ironclad; of the ship's port and starboard midsection were stepped-up-and-down to the waterline with overlapping rows of heavy chain armor, hidden behind black wooden plank covers.Holloway, Don, \\"High Seas Duel\\", Civil War Quarterly, 2014 Alabamas much-too-rapid gunnery and misplaced aim, combined with the deteriorated state of her gunpowder and shell fuses, enabled a victory for both of Kearsarges Dahlgren smoothbore cannon. While Alabama opened fire at long range, Kearsarge steamed straight at her, exposing the Union sloop-of-war to potentially devastating raking fire. In their haste, however, Alabama's gunners fired many shells too high. At , Kearsarge turned broadside to engage with deliberate fire. Soon the heavy cannon began to find their mark. After receiving a fatal Dahlgren shell to the starboard waterline, which tore open a portion of Alabamas hull, causing her steam engine to explode from the shell's impact, Semmes was forced to order the striking of his ship's Stainless Banner battle ensign and later to display a hand-held white flag of surrender to finally halt the combat. As the commerce raider was going down by the stern, Kearsarge stood off at a distance and observed at the orders of her captain (John Ancrum Winslow); Winslow eventually sent rescue boats for survivors after taking aboard Alabama survivors from one of the raider's two surviving longboats. As his command sank, the wounded Semmes threw his sword into the sea, depriving Kearsarges Captain Winslow of the traditional surrender ceremony of having it handed over to him as victor. Semmes was eventually rescued, along with forty-one of his crewmen,Canon, Jill. Civil War Heroes. Bellerophon Books, Santa Barbara, Calif., 2002, p. 39. by the British yacht Deerhound and three French pilot boats. He and the forty- one were then taken to England where all but one recovered; while there they were hailed as naval heroes, despite the loss of AlabamaFox, pp. 230-1 Raphael Semmes From England, Semmes made his way back to America via Cuba and from there a safe shore landing on the Texas gulf coast; it took his small party many weeks of journeying through the war-devastated South before he was finally able to make his way to the Confederate capital. He was promoted to rear admiral in February 1865, and during the last months of the war he commanded the James River Squadron from his flagship, the heavily armored ironclad . With the fall of Richmond, in April 1865, Semmes supervised the destruction of all the squadron's nearby warships and was then acted as a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army with the implication that he was appointed to that grade.Allardice, Bruce S.

That appointment was not and could not have been submitted to or confirmed by the Confederate Senate, since the Second Confederate Congress adjourned for the last time on March 18, 1865. Historian Bruce Allardice notes that Semmes was vague about this appointment in his memoirs and considered his naval rank to be the equivalent of a brigadier general. After the destruction of the naval squadron, Semmes's sailors were turned into an infantry unit and dubbed the \\"Naval Brigade.\\" Semmes was then placed in command; Semmes intention for the brigade was to join Lee's army after burning their vessels. Lee's army, however, was already cut off from Richmond, so most of Semmes's men boarded a train and escaped to join General Joseph E. Johnston's army in North Carolina.Spencer, W. \\"Raphael Semmes: The Philosophical Mariner, Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1997, , p. 185 A few men of the Naval Brigade were able to join with Lee's rear guard and fought at the Battle of Sailor's Creek. Semmes and the Naval Brigade were surrendered to Union Major General William T. Sherman with Johnston's army at Bennett Place near Durham Station, North Carolina, on April 26, 1865, and subsequently were paroled on May 1, 1865. Semmes's parole notes that he held commissions as both a brigadier general and rear admiral in the Confederate service when he surrendered with General Johnston's army. He insisted on his parole being written to include the brigadier general commission in anticipation of being charged with piracy by the United States government.Spencer, W. \\"Raphael Semmes: The Philosophical Mariner, Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1997, , p. 186.Spencer, W. \\"Raphael Semmes: The Philosophical Mariner, Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1997, , p. 189, 194 =After the war= Raphael Semmes House on Government Street in Mobile, Alabama, listed on the National Register of Historic Places The U.S. briefly held Semmes as a prisoner after the war, but released him on parole, then later arrested him for treason on December 15, 1865. After a good deal of behind-the-scenes political machinations, all charges were eventually dropped, and he was finally released on April 7, 1866. After his release, Semmes worked as a professor of philosophy and literature at Louisiana State Seminary (now Louisiana State University), as a county judge, and then as a newspaper editor; his controversial military service always played a part in forcing his job changes. Semmes later returned to Mobile and resumed his legal career. In October 1866 the Louisiana State Seminary offered Semmes a position as Professor of Moral Philosophy and English Literature. The position paid $3,000 per year. Semmes assumed this role on January 1, 1867. His fellow faculty- members described him as \\"dignified and easy to talk with\\". His teaching method in classes incorporated mainly formal lectures, with very little discussion. In May 1867 Semmes resigned from academia to take over as editor of a newspaper, the Memphis Bulletin. He defended both his actions at sea and the political actions of the southern states in his 1869 Memoirs of Service Afloat During The War Between the States. The book was viewed by some, including Putnam's Magazine, as one of the most cogent but bitter defenses written about the South's \\"Lost Cause\\".Fox, pp. 247‚Äì249. Semmes is credited with helping to popularize the phrase ‚ÄúWar Between the States\\" to refer to the American Civil War. In 1871 the citizens of Mobile presented Semmes with what became known as the Raphael Semmes House, and it remained his residence until his untimely death in 1877 from complications that followed food poisoning from eating contaminated shrimp. Semmes was then interred in Mobile's Old Catholic Cemetery. Legacy Semmes's Confederate ensign Semmes is a member of the Alabama Hall of Fame. One of the streets on the current Louisiana State University campus once carried his full name in his honor, as does Semmes Avenue in Richmond, Virginia. There was a life-sized statue of Admiral Semmes in Mobile, but it was taken down early in the morning on June 5, 2020. A suburban area of western Mobile County is named for him, as well as a hotel in downtown Mobile named The Admiral Hotel. When Semmes returned to the South from England, he brought a ceremonial Stainless Banner (a version of the Confederate flag) with him. It was inherited by his grandchildren, Raphael Semmes III and Mrs. Eunice Semmes Thorington. After his sister's death, Raphael Semmes III donated the ensign to the state of Alabama on September 19, 1929. Today, the battle ensign resides in the collection of the Alabama Department of Archives and History among its Confederate Naval collection, listed as \\"Admiral Semmes' Flag, Catalogue No. 86.1893.1 (PN10149-10150)\\". Their provenance reconstruction shows that it was presented to Semmes in England sometime after the sinking of the Alabama by \\"Lady Dehogton and other English ladies\\".

The tunnelling shield used for the construction of the Xinyi Line on the Taipei Metro system in Taiwan. A tunnelling shield is a protective structure used during the excavation of large, man-made tunnels. When excavating through ground that is soft, liquid, or otherwise unstable, there is a health and safety hazard to workers and the project itself from falling materials or a cave-in. A tunnelling shield functions as a temporary support structure. It is in place for the usually short time from when the tunnel section is excavated until it can be lined with a permanent support structure. The permanent structure may be made up of, depending on the period, bricks, concrete, cast iron, or steel. Although modern shields are commonly cylindrical, the first \\"shield\\", designed by Marc Isambard Brunel, was actually a large, rectangular, scaffold-like iron structure with three levels and twelve sections per level and a solid weight-bearing top. The structure nevertheless protected the men from cave-ins as they laboured within it, digging the tunnel out in front of themselves. History The first successful rectangular tunnelling shield was developed by Marc Isambard Brunel and patented by him and Lord Cochrane in January 1818. Marc Brunel and his son Isambard Kingdom Brunel used it to excavate the Thames Tunnel beginning in 1825 (though the tunnel was not opened until 1843).Becket, Derrick (1980). Brunel's Britain. Newton Abbot: David & Charles. . Chapter 10: \\"Tunnels\\". Brunel is said to have been inspired in his design by the shell of the shipworm Teredo navalis, a mollusc whose efficiency at boring through submerged timber he observed while working in a shipyard. The shield was built by Maudslay, Sons & Field of Lambeth, London, who also built the steam pumps for de-watering the tunnel. In 1840, Alfred Ely Beach, editor of Scientific American journal, suggested a circular shield design would be better than rectangular, and in 1868 Beach built a circular shield - a picture of which was printed in a New York news article about his pneumatic tunnel system idea. The design was based upon Brunel's shield lattice and screw-jacked forwards as the face advanced manually. Brunel's original design was substantially improved by James Henry Greathead in the course of the construction of the Tower Subway under the River Thames in central London in 1870. Whilst many attribute the design shift from rectangular to cylindrical to Barlow, Greathead was the first to ever build a patented cylindrical tunnelling shield. It has become clear that Beach was the first to suggest a circular design would be superior. Probably the most crucial innovation of Peter W. Barlow's 1864 patented design was that it had a circular cross- section (unlike Brunel's, which was of rectangular construction), which at once made it theoretically simpler in construction and better able to support the weight of the surrounding soil; theoretically because Barlow never built his patented idea whereas Greathead did. The Greathead Shield was in diameter. The 1864 Barlow patent was further improved and given a provisional patent in 1868 but never ratified as Barlow died a short time afterwards. Greathead independently came up with his own designs and was granted two successive patents for different shield designs of which one was for the construction of the City and South London Railway (today part of London Underground's Northern line) in 1884, with tunnels in diameter. Greathead's system was also used in the driving of the diameter running tunnels for the Waterloo & City Railway which opened in 1898; Barlow was joint Engineer [with Greathead?] to the project until his death. The station tunnels at the City station (now known as Bank) were the largest diameter tunnelling shields in the world at the time, measuring . Most tunnelling shields are still loosely based on Greathead Shields' design.John C Gillham, The Waterloo & City Railway, The Oakwood Press, Usk, 2001, Greathead patented three shield designs which are documented in the article in his name. Additionally, he invented the concept of sprayed concrete grout to stabilise earthworks with shot concrete. This is evidenced by his patent of his second tunnelling shield design with a gritting pan that hydraulically injected reinforcing grout between the constructed lining and the tunnel wall. An original Greathead Shield used in the excavation of the deep London Underground lines remains in place in disused tunnels beneath Moorgate station. In any competent history of tunnel design using shields, there ought to be recognition of three men by name for their built designs: Brunel, Beach and Greathead. Whilst Barlow had an idea, he never actually built either his patented shield design or his later provisional patent design which was never ratified. While this is not a complete history of tunnel shields as more evidence is coming to light each year from digital archives around the world of older publications, the timeline of their development is becoming more coherent and clear than ever before as a result. Manual shield tunnelling The Greathead tunnelling shield in use on the Waterloo & City Railway In early shield tunnelling, the shield functioned as a way to protect labourers who performed the digging and moved the shield forward, progressively replacing it with pre-built sections of tunnel wall. The early deep tunnels for the London Underground were built in this way. The shield divided the workface into overlapping portions that each worker could excavate. Modern tunnel boring machines A tunnel boring machine (TBM) consists of a shield (a large metal cylinder) and trailing support mechanisms. A rotating cutting wheel is located at the front end of the shield. Behind the cutting wheel there is a chamber where the excavated soil is either mixed with slurry (so-called slurry TBM) or left as-is (earth pressure balance or EPB shield), depending on the type of the TBM. The choice of TBM type depends on the soil conditions. Systems are also present for removal of the soil (or the soil mixed with slurry). Behind the chamber there is a set of hydraulic jacks supported by the finished part of the tunnel which are used to push the TBM forward. Once a certain distance has been excavated (roughly ), a new tunnel ring is built using the erector. The erector is a rotating system which picks up precast concrete segments and places them in the desired position. Several support mechanisms can be found behind the shield, inside the finished part of the tunnel, which are part of the TBM: dirt removal, slurry pipelines if applicable, control rooms, rails for transport of the precast segments, etc. Lining The tunnel lining is the wall of the tunnel. It usually consists of precast concrete segments which form rings. Cast iron linings were traditionally used in the London Underground tunnels, while steel liners were sometimes used elsewhere. The concept of using precast moulded lining sections is not new and was first patented in 1874 by James Henry Greathead. Shields in Japan In Japan there are several innovative approaches to shield tunnelling, e.g. the Double-O-Tube or DOT-tunnel. This tunnel looks like two overlapping circles. There are also shields with computerized arms which can be used to dig a tunnel in virtually any shape.

The concept implicitly excludes certain assumptions or motivations that are considered improper as a basis for public decision making, even as a person may apply them in personal decisions that do not have a significant impact on the public. This is understood within the view that the members of the public are rationalized counterparts of real moral agents, considering possible moral rules and reason when making decisions. Immanuel Kant The phrase \\"public use of one's reason\\" (Vernunft in allen St√ºkken √∂ffentlichen Gebrauch) was used by Immanuel Kant in his 1784 editorial piece responding to the question \\"What Is Enlightenment?,\\" where he distinguished it from private usage of reason, by which he meant reasoning offered from a specific civic office or post. This Kantian conception was further developed by American philosopher John Rawls to refer to the common reason of all citizens in a pluralist society and identified it as a component of political liberalism. Although Rawls cited the Kantian origin of his concept, his understanding is distinguished by the way he explained how public reason embodies the shared fund of beliefs and reason of those who constitute a democratic polity‚Äîthose who are concerned with the good of the public and matters of basic justice. Public reason giving, in the Rawlsian sense, involves justifying a particular position by way of reasons that people of different moral or political backgrounds could accept. Although in his later writings he added what is known as the proviso, meaning that non-public reasons could be given assuming that public reasons would be provided in due course. In order to accomplish this, however, one must overcome what he refers to as the burdens of judgment, which can produce disagreement among reasonable citizens. These burdens include conflicting evidence, giving differing weights to considerations, conceptual indeterminacy, differing experiences and value conflicts. Private reason, by contrast, is the exercise of an individual's reason to the constrained norms and interests of some sub-set of the public as a whole (such as a business, a political party, the military or the family). Rawls also classified the concept into public reason for \\"liberal peoples\\" and public reason for \\"society of peoples\\". The former involves public reason of free and equal liberal peoples who debate their mutual relations while the latter involves equal citizens of domestic society debating political issues and justice concerning their government.

King Henry acknowledged William as his son and gave him the honour of Appleby, Lincolnshire, in 1188. Eight years later, his half brother King Richard I married him to a great heiress, Ela of Salisbury, 3rd Countess of Salisbury, and granted him the title and lands of the earldom. During the reign of King John, Salisbury was at court on several important ceremonial occasions and held various offices: High Sheriff of Wiltshire; lieutenant of Gascony; constable of Dover; and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports; and later warden of the Welsh Marches. He was appointed sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire about 1213. Military career William was sent to Poitou to command a small force of knights alongside John's bastard son, Geoffrey, in 1205 after John's plans for a full scale expedition were squashed.wendover; coggeshall Salisbury was a commander in the king's Welsh and Irish expeditions of 1210‚Äì1212 and was appointed Viceroy of Ireland, jointly with John de Gray, Bishop of Norwich, when the king left for England in 1210. The king also granted him the honour of Eye in Suffolk. In 1213, Salisbury led a large fleet to Flanders, where he seized or destroyed a good part of a French invasion fleet anchored at or near Damme. This ended the invasion threat but not the conflicts between England and France. In 1214, Salisbury was sent to help Otto IV of Germany, an English ally, who was invading France. Salisbury commanded the right wing of the army at their disastrous defeat in that year at the Battle of Bouvines, where he was captured. By the time he returned to England, revolt was brewing amongst the barons. Salisbury was one of the few who remained loyal to John, except for a few months in 1216. In the civil war that took place the year after the signing of the Magna Carta, Salisbury was one of the leaders of the king's army in the south. He was made High Sheriff of Wiltshire again, this time for life. After raising the siege of Lincoln with William Marshall he was also appointed High Sheriff of Lincolnshire (in addition to his current post as High Sheriff of Somerset) and governor of Lincoln castle. However, after the French prince Louis (later Louis VIII) landed as an ally of the rebels, Salisbury went over to his side. Presumably, he thought John's cause was lost. Tomb of William Longesp√©e in Salisbury Cathedral After John's death and the departure of Louis, Salisbury, along with many other barons, joined the cause of John's young son, now Henry III of England. He held an influential place in the government during the king's minority and fought in Gascony to help secure the remaining part of the English continental possessions. He was appointed High Sheriff of Devon in 1217 and High Sheriff of Staffordshire and Shropshire in 1224. Salisbury's ship was nearly lost in a storm while returning to England in 1225, and he spent some months in refuge at a monastery on the French island of R√©. Death Salisbury died not long after his return to England at Salisbury Castle. Roger of Wendover alleged that he was poisoned by Hubert de Burgh. One reliable source, however, states that \\"there is little evidence [of murder] aside from Roger of Wendover‚Äôs account in Flores Historiarum\\".William Longsword, 3rd earl of Salisbury Encyclopedia Britannica He was buried at Salisbury Cathedral in Salisbury, Wiltshire, England. Salisbury's tomb was opened in 1791. Bizarrely, the well-preserved corpse of a rat which carried traces of arsenic, was found inside his skull.

Dark blobs appear at the intersections A grid illusion is any kind of grid that deceives a person's vision. The two most common types of grid illusions are the Hermann grid illusion and the scintillating grid illusion. Hermann grid illusion The Hermann grid illusion is an optical illusion reported by Ludimar Hermann in 1870. The illusion is characterized by \\"ghostlike\\" grey blobs perceived at the intersections of a white (or light-colored) grid on a black background. The grey blobs disappear when looking directly at an intersection. Scintillating grid illusion An example of the scintillating grid illusion. Dark dots seem to appear and disappear at intersections. The scintillating grid illusion is an optical illusion, discovered by E. and B. Lingelbach and M. Schrauf in 1994. It is often considered a variation of the Hermann grid illusion but possesses different properties. It is constructed by superimposing white discs on the intersections of orthogonal gray bars on a black background. Dark dots seem to appear and disappear rapidly at random intersections, hence the label \\"scintillating\\". When a person keeps his or her eyes directly on a single intersection, the dark dot does not appear. The dark dots disappear if one is too close to or too far from the image. Differences between the scintillating and Hermann grid illusions The difference between the Hermann grid illusion and the scintillating illusion is that scintillating illusions have dots already in place at the intersection, whereas there are no dots already in place at the intersections of Hermann grid illusions. Since they are so similar, the two names are commonly used interchangeably. But the scintillating illusion does not occur with an isolated intersection, as in the case of the Hermann grid; observations suggest that a minimum of evenly spaced intersections with superimposed discs are required to produce the effect. This requirement suggests the participation of global processes of the kind proposed for the linking and grouping of features in an image, in addition to local processes. Theories The effect of both optical illusions is often explained by a neural process called lateral inhibition. The intensity at a point in the visual system is not simply the result of a single receptor, but the result of a group of receptors which respond to the presentation of stimuli in what is called a receptive field. A retinal ganglion cell pools the inputs of several photoreceptors over an area of retina, the area in physical space to which the photoreceptors respond is the ganglion cell's \\"receptive field\\". In the center of the receptive field the individual photoreceptors excite the ganglion cell when they detect increased luminance. The photoreceptors in the surrounding area inhibit the ganglion cell. Thus, since a point at an intersection is surrounded by more intensity than a point at the middle of a line, the intersection appears darker due to the increased inhibition. There is strong evidence that the retinal ganglion cell theory is untenable. For example, making the lines of the grid wavy rather than straight eliminates both the Hermann grid and scintillating grid illusions. The Baumgartner / RGC theory does not predict this outcome. Lateral inhibition theory also can not account for the fact that the Hermann grid illusion is perceived over a range of bar widths. Lateral inhibition theory would predict that decreasing the size of the grid (and therefore decreasing the amount of inhibition at the intersection) would eradicate the illusory effect.

The company's operations were acquired by the Toronto-Dominion Bank in 2000, and merged into Toronto- Dominion's existing retail banking operations, forming the current TD Canada Trust division. History Founded in London, Ontario, in 1864 as Huron and Erie Savings and Loan Society, Canada Trust was a trust company that offered the same services as a bank. It was one of Canada's largest non-bank financial institutions, with $38 billion in deposits and $176 billion in assets. It had 11,000 employees and 3.5 million customers and operated a network of 413 branches across Canada; and almost 1,000 automated banking machines. Its banking machines were, at one point in the late 1980s to early 1990s, called \\"Johnnycash\\" machines. They were even promoted with lifesize cutouts of Johnny Cash asking the question, \\"Why walk the line?\\", a reference to one of his hit songs. In the United States, CT Financial operated through First Federal Savings and Loan Association. First Federal was founded in 1896, and operated through 82 branches throughout New York State. CT Financial also operated other divisions including Truscan Realty Limited (d/b/a Canada Trust Realty), CT Insurance Limited and Canada Trust Bank N.V. During the 1980s and 1990s, CT Financial was controlled by Imasco, a conglomerate which at that time also owned Imperial Tobacco Canada and Shoppers Drug Mart. Imasco was publicly traded, although it was controlled by British American Tobacco. During the late 1990s, some synergy between the companies manifested in the form of Canada Trust ATMs appearing in or adjacent to Shoppers Drug Mart locations (most if not all have since been removed). In 1999, BAT moved to take Imasco private, but had no interest in the company's non-tobacco assets, which put Canada Trust in play. CIBC had long indicated its interest in Canada Trust, but ultimately BAT accepted an $8 billion offer from the Toronto-Dominion Bank. Following the completion of this deal on February 1, 2000, Canada Trust's retail banking operations were integrated into TD's similar operations, now collectively known as TD Canada Trust. TD continues to operate The Canada Trust Company as a subsidiary entity (having been amalgamated with the aforementioned Canada Trustco Mortgage Company, as well as the bank's existing subsidiary TD Trust Company). That company now primarily provides traditional trust company services, and also services Canada Trust accounts opened prior to the merger with TD (other existing TD Canada Trust-branded accounts are actually issued by TD Bank itself).

He serves as the Carmack Waterhouse Professor of Legal Theory at Georgetown University, where he teaches constitutional law, contracts, and legal theory. He writes about the libertarian theory of law, contract theory, constitutional law, and jurisprudence and has argued cases in front of the Supreme Court. After attending Northwestern University and Harvard Law School, Barnett worked as a prosecutor in Chicago. Barnett's first academic position was at the Chicago-Kent College of Law of the Illinois Institute of Technology. He later became the Austin B. Fletcher Professor of Law at Boston University, where he served as the faculty adviser for the Federalist Society. He joined the faculty of Georgetown University Law Center in 2006. Barnett is a Senior Fellow of the Cato Institute and the Goldwater Institute. His book The Structure of Liberty won the Ralph Gregory Elliot Book Award in 1998. In 2008 he was awarded a Fellowship in Constitutional Studies by the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. Life and career Randy Barnett was born on February 5, 1952, in Chicago, Illinois. After high school, he attended Northwestern University, graduating in 1974 with a B.A. in philosophy. He then studied law at the Harvard Law School, graduating with a J.D. in 1977. After law school, Barnett returned to Chicago and worked as an Illinois state prosecutor for Cook County, Illinois. He spent the 1981‚Äì82 academic year as a research fellow at the University of Chicago Law School, then in the fall of 1982 began his academic career as an assistant professor of law at the Chicago-Kent College of Law. In 1993, Barnett was hired as a professor of law at the Boston University School of Law. In 2006, Barnett left Boston and began teaching at the Georgetown University Law Center, where he remains today.  Jurisprudence  In The Structure of Liberty, Barnett offers a libertarian theory of law and politics. Barnett calls his theory \\"the liberal conception of justice\\" and emphasizes the relationship between legal libertarianism and classical liberalism. He argues private adjudication and enforcement of law, with market forces eliminating inefficiencies and inequities, to be the only legal system that can provide adequate solutions to the problems of interest, power, and knowledge. He discusses theories of constitutional legitimacy and methods of constitutional interpretation in Restoring the Lost Constitution. There have been several criticisms and reviews of his theory, including Stephan Kinsella, Richard Epstein, David N. Mayer, Lawrence B. Solum and John K. Palchak and Stanley T. Leung. Supreme Court Cases Barnett was also lead lawyer for the plaintiffs in Ashcroft v. Raich (later Gonzales v. Raich), which won a victory before the Ninth Circuit, which ruled that federal action against legal marijuana patients violated the Commerce Clause. Barnett's side, however, lost on appeal at the Supreme Court, which ruled that Congress had the power to enforce federal marijuana prohibition in states that had legalized medical marijuana. He was also involved in the famous Affordable Care Act case National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius. Constitutional theory Barnett has also done work on the theory of the United States Constitution, culminating in his books Restoring the Lost Constitution and Our Republican Constitution. He argues for an originalist theory of constitutional interpretation and for constitutional construction based on a presumption of liberty, not popular sovereignty. Barnett also focuses on the history and original meaning of the Second and Ninth Amendments to the United States Constitution. He has advanced the Standard Model interpretation that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms, subject to federal regulation under Congress's power to organize the militia in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. =Ninth Amendment= Barnett is a proponent of the view that the Ninth Amendment's rights \\"retained by the people\\" should be vigorously enforced by the federal judiciary. In a 2006 article, Barnett wrote:Randy Barnett, The Ninth Amendment: It Means What It Says, 85 Texas Law Review 1 (2006) Regarding what stature and force natural rights had before some of them were enumerated, Barnett says that federal courts did not have authority to enforce such rights against the states. He wrote in the same 2006 article: A related issue is whether the original unamended Constitution gave federal courts authority to enforce unenumerated natural rights against congressional regulation of the federal district. Barnett has indicated that federal courts had such authority and that enumerated rights \\"had the same stature and force\\" in the district even before they were enumerated. He has indicated that the case of Bolling v. Sharpe (dealing with integration of public schools in the District of Columbia) is hard to justify textually from the Constitution, and if it were to be overturned, Congress would create more laws desegregating the district, which would be justified in his view of the Constitution.Legal Affairs Debate Club, Constitution in Exile? Cass Sunstein and Randy Barnett Debate. (May 4, 2005) The question of what constitutional rights citizens possessed in the federal district has ramifications for the meaning of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In 2003, Professor Barnett wrote:Randy Barnett, Proper Scope of the Police Power, 79 Notre Dame Law Review 429 (2004) If no such federal constitutional protection of unenumerated rights existed in the federal district prior to the Fourteenth Amendment, only enumerated rights may have been extended by it. =Repeal Amendment= Barnett has proposed a Repeal Amendment to the United States Constitution, which would give two thirds of the states the power to repeal any federal law or regulation.Barnett, Randy and Howell, William J. (2010-09-16) [The Case for a \\"Repeal Amendment\\"], Wall Street Journal According to Barnett, the proposed amendment \\"provides a targeted way to reverse particular congressional acts and administrative regulations without relying on federal judges or permanently amending the text of the Constitution to correct a specific abuse.\\" He described the intent of the amendment as follows: Barnett's proposal has received interest from many politicians and academics, even those who do not share his libertarian beliefs. \\"[A] number of congressional Republicans, including soon-to-be House Majority Leader Eric Cantor\\" have endorsed the proposal,Kinsella, Stephan (2010-12-03) Randy Barnett's Federalism Amendment, Mises.org as has Attorney General of Virginia Ken Cuccinelli.Letter from Ken Cuccinelli to State Attorneys General, December 1, 2010 Republican Congressman Rob Bishop of Utah introduced the amendment in the House of Representatives.Elliot, Philip (2010-11-30) Conservatives push amendment for repeal, Washington Post University of Texas Law Professor Sanford Levinson has said that the Repeal Amendment \\"ha[s] the merit of recognizing that structures matter.\\".Levinson, Sanford (2010-12-09) It's the Constitution, stupid, Balkinization =Bill of Federalism= The Bill of Federalism is a list of ten proposed amendments to the United States Constitution by Barnett. It would enshrine in the Constitution certain ideas based on states' rights and free market libertarianism. Barnett drafted the bill in response to the Tea Party movement's emphasis on limiting federal powers. The present draft of the document was published on May 13, 2009 and incorporated much of the feedback that Barnett had received in response to the previous draft. The document is an expansion of an earlier 'Federalist Amendment' that Barnett composed as part of an article he wrote in the Wall Street Journal. Barnett advocates for the states to call for a Constitutional Convention in which they would propose the amendments comprising the bill. Alternatively, the United States Congress could propose the amendments to the states, as they have done every time a Convention to propose amendments has been called for. The amendments, summarized by number below, would do the following; # Disallow federal income taxes (repeal Sixteenth Amendment), as well as gift, estate, and consumption taxes; allow FairTax; require a three- fifths supermajority to raise or set new taxes # Set limits on the Interstate Commerce Clause # Disallow unfunded mandates and conditions on funding. # Close a constitutional loophole that allows treaties to override established limits on power # Extend free speech consideration to campaign contributions and to cover any medium of communication (including the Internet) # Allow a resolution of three fourths of the states to rescind any federal law or regulation. # Establish term limits for Senators and Representatives. # Provide the President with a line-item veto to balance the budget on any year in which it is unbalanced. # Reinforce the Ninth Amendment by specifying additional rights and by providing a process for any person to prove the existence of an unenumerated right. # Restrict judicial activism by mandating an originalist method of interpretation. History On April 16, 2009, Barnett appeared on the Glenn Beck Show to address the question, \\"What redress do states have who are tired of getting kicked around by the federal government?\\" Barnett proposed the idea of passing a constitutional amendment and argued that by threatening to hold a constitutional convention, the states could force Congress to propose the amendment to them. Barnett then wrote an article for the Wall Street Journal, \\"The Case for a Federalism Amendment.\\" It was published in the editorial section on April 24, 2009. In it he expounded on his idea for forcing Congress to propose an amendment to the states, and included a draft for a five-sectioned \\"Federalist Amendment\\", which would strengthen states' rights and restrict federal power. According to an interview he gave to PJTV, Barnett utilized the great volume of constructive feedback to further refine his ideas for the amendment. He also decided to disaggregate the amendment into multiple parts so that opposition to a few of the ideas would not sink the entire amendment. He decided to add some popular proposed constitutional amendments, addressing such issues as the fairtax, the line item veto, balanced budgets, and judicial activism to build a broad coalition of groups that may advance the amendments. He hopes to have the Tea Party movement rally around this bill. He claims to have deliberately avoided some amendments that might be seen as 'kooky' such as the repeal of the Seventeenth Amendment, which effected the direct election of senators rather than their selection by the state legislatures, to protect the rest of the project. On May 13, 2009, Barnett released the intended final draft. Barnett removed amendment 3, which declared the existence of police powers of states. He condensed amendments 4 and 5, which disallowed income and estate taxes respectively, into one amendment now listed as number 1. That made room for two additional amendments not present in the earlier draft. One prevents treaties from enlarging Congress' power in what might be thought of as a Constitutional loophole. Another applies the right to free speech to any medium, including the Internet, and also makes campaign contribution a form of protected free speech. The Bill of Federalism Project has been incorporated as a nonprofit agency in the State of Tennessee. Ratification strategy Barnett would like the States to call for a Constitutional Convention. That was his main proposition when he appeared on the Glenn Beck show, with the actual amendments being drafted later. He has drafted a resolution to call for a convention. He believes that to be a necessary step, as Congress would not voluntarily propose amendments that largely weaken its power. Gerard N. Magliocca has written an article supporting the idea of calling for a Convention. Criticism The John Birch Society has criticized the idea of calling for a constitutional convention, calling it a \\"dangerous temptation\\" and a \\"threat to our Constitution.\\" Barnett has countered that historically, whenever the states have called for a Constitutional Convention, Congress has responded by proposing the amendments themselves. He also notes that even in the case of a constitutional convention, the proposed amendments still need to be ratified by three fourths of the states. Amendments of the Bill of Federalism =Amendment I ‚Äì Restrictions on Tax Powers of Congress= Section 1 of the amendment would disallow federal income, gift, estate, and consumption taxes. It would explicitly permit a national sales tax, an idea which has been proposed in the United States as the FairTax. Section 2 would require a supermajority of three-fifths of both houses of Congress for any new tax or tax increase. Section 3 repeals the Sixteenth Amendment and delays the implementation of the whole amendment for five years after it is ratified to give Congress time to dismantle the IRS. The amendment is partially a combination of the fifth and sixth amendments of the previous draft. =Amendment II ‚Äì Limits of Commerce Power= The Constitution grants Congress the power to \\"regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes.\\" That is amplified by the additional power \\"To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers. ... \\" The amendment would overrule the current interpretation of the commerce clause by removing three applications of the interstate commerce clause: the regulation of an activity having effects outside of a state, the regulation of instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and regulation as part of a broader regulatory scheme. # In Wickard v. Filburn, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress could regulate the production of wheat by a farmer named Roscoe Filburn despite the fact that Filburn did not intend to sell any of the wheat across state lines. The court ruled that since in the aggregate, unregulated wheat could have an effect on interstate commerce, it was covered by the commerce clause.Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 125 (1942) # The Court has held, \\"Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities.\\"Perez v. United States, 402 U.S. 146, 150 (1971) In one instance, the Court upheld federal safety regulations of vehicles used in intrastate commerce, on the grounds that they run on highways of interstate commerce.Southern R. Co. v. United States, 222 U.S. 20 (1911) # In Gonzales v. Raich, the court ruled that the commerce clause extended to noneconomic regulatory schemes of congress. =Amendment III ‚Äì Unfunded Mandates and Conditions on Spending= The first clause of the amendment would disallow unfunded mandates so Congress could not make laws, even within its power, if they would require the states or their political subdivisions, such as cities, to spend money unless they were fully reimbursed by Congress. The court has ruled in Printz v. United States that the federal government cannot directly force a state to pass any law or regulation.Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997) However, by the precedent set in South Dakota v. Dole,South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203 (1987) Congress can make routine, unrelated funding conditional upon state compliance with regulation that Congress cannot itself enact. The National Minimum Drinking Age Act was the subject of Dole and uses such a mechanism, as did the National Maximum Speed Law while it was still law. The second clause of the amendment would prevent Congress from using conditional funding to induce the states to enact any law if it would \\"restrict the liberties of its citizens.\\" =Amendment IV ‚Äì No Abuse of the Treaty Power= The Constitution grants to the president the Treaty Clause power \\"by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur.\\" The Constitution also grants to the Congress the power \\"To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\\" Based on that clause, the Supreme Court held in Missouri v. Holland that Congress can make laws implementing a treaty even if such laws would otherwise be outside of Congress' power to enact. Many thought the decision to be unwise and feared that the federal government could essentially bypass any Constitutional limits by simply enacting treaties granting itself any powers that itit saw fit. Such concerns led to the Bricker Amendment of the 1950s, designed to restrict the treaty power. The Bricker Amendment came up a single vote short of the two thirds majority it needed. The amendment would similarly overturn Missouri, preventing any treaty from enlarging Congress' power. However, the Supreme Court's 1957 Reid v. Covert decision reversed Missouri in that treaties must respect the Constitution, to be valid. =Amendment V ‚Äì Freedom of Political Speech and Press= The amendment would expand the scope of the right to free speech to apply to campaign contributions, thereby making it illegal for charges or imprisonment in terms of campaign finance laws. It would make laws such as McCain-Feingold illegal. McCain-Feingold made it illegal for anybody not directly connected with a campaign to voice issues related to that campaign within 30 days of a primary election and 60 days within a general election. The amendment also extends freedom of speech rights to the internet. =Amendment VI ‚Äì Power of States to Check Federal Power= The amendment would provide for the states to have a collective veto power over congress without having to go through the courts. At least 38 of the 50 states would disapprove of an act of congress. It continues to attract political support as the \\"Repeal Amendment.\\"\\"In Tea Party speech, McDonnell backs 'repeal amendment',\\" http://hamptonroads.com/2010/10/tea-party-speech-mcdonnell-backs-repeal- amendment (October 11, 2010). =Amendment VII ‚Äì Term Limits for Congress= The amendment would simply limit the terms of any representative or senator. A representative would be limited to six terms, plus one year of a previous representative's term. Meanwhile, senators would be limited to two terms, plus three years of a previous senator's term. That is based on the 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution which limits the President to two terms in office and two years of another President's term, for a total of ten years. =Amendment VIII ‚Äì Balanced Budget Line Item Veto= The amendment requires a line-item veto to be established for the President. Section 1 establishes a definition of an unbalanced budget by stating that it is when public debt at the end of one fiscal year (September 30 of the calendar year) is greater than the preceding one. Section 2 allows the President to approve or disapprove of any part of any separate legislation except one that allows for the operation of Congress or the judiciary. Section 3 simply sends the disapproved items to the US House for separate consideration. Section 4 forces Congress to pass a line-item veto law after the amendment is ratified. The amendment is a direct result of an overturned law that Bill Clinton had in his second term as President. =Amendment IX ‚Äì The Rights Retained by the People= The amendment is a direct cousin of the Tenth Amendment, but it applies to the people of the U.S. and not the states. Section 1 puts the Declaration of Independence into coded law. That includes its preamble, which allows for people to live their lives the way they see fit. The proposed right of \\"making binding contracts of their choosing\\" would appear to resurrect the legal doctrine of economic due process, which during the Lochner era, was used by the Supreme Court to strike down a wide variety of state and federal laws affecting business, including child-labor and minimum-wage laws. Section 2 allows all legal persons of the United States to challenge any law that restricts their rights, and puts the burden of proof (fact) on federal, state, and local governments to argue otherwise. Any attempt to establish the constitutionality of any law is thus rested within the government. =Amendment X ‚Äì Neither Foreign Law nor American Judges May Alter the Meaning of Constitution= The amendment establishes a strict interpretation of the Constitution as written and bans the practice of some judges having a broad interpretation including establishing foreign laws into their decisions, which could change the meaning of an article or section of the Constitution.  Contract theory  Barnett also writes about contract theories. He has advanced a theory of contract formation that emphasizes the intention to be bound as the key to contract law. He also has worked on the idea of a default rule, a rule of contract law that binds the parties if their contract does not cover the eventuality or condition that is the subject of the default rule.  Criticism  Austrian School economist and libertarian legal theorist Walter Block has criticized Barnett's arguments for the inalienability of certain rights.Block, Walter. \\"A Libertarian Theory of Inalienability: A Critique of Rothbard, Barnett, Smith, Kinsella, Gordon, and Epstein.\\" Journal of Libertarian Studies.

In operation from 1952 until January 14, 2018, and headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, the company began as Simpsons-Sears‚Äîa joint venture between the Canadian Simpsons department store chain and the American Sears chain‚Äîwhich operated a national mail order business and co-branded Simpsons-Sears stores modelled after those of Sears in the U.S. After the Hudson's Bay Company purchased Simpsons in 1978, the joint venture was dismantled and Hudson's Bay sold its shares in the joint venture to Sears; with Sears now fully owning the company, it was renamed Sears Canada Inc. in 1984. In 1999, Sears Canada acquired the remaining assets and locations of the historic Canadian chain Eaton's. From 2014, Sears Holdings owned a 10% share in the company. ESL Investments was the largest shareholder of Sears Canada. In 2016, Sears Canada had a network that included 140 corporate stores (including full-line, Sears Home, and Sears Outlet stores), 71 Hometown stores, over 900 catalogue, and online merchandise pick-up locations, 69 Sears Travel offices, and a nationwide repair and service network. The company also published a general merchandise catalogue until the last quarter of 2016 and offered shopping online at sears.ca until October 19, 2017. After filing for creditor protection in June 2017, Sears Canada announced it would close 20 full-line locations, 15 Home stores, 10 Outlet stores, and 14 Sears Hometown stores. The closings resulted in 2,900 employee layoffs. These stores officially closed on Sunday, October 1, 2017. In September 2017, Sears Canada announced the closing of 10 additional stores, in addition to the 59 store closings previously announced in June. On October 10, 2017, Sears Canada announced that it would seek court approval to shut down all of its remaining stores in Canada and lay off 11,240 remaining staff. The approval was granted by the Ontario Superior Court on October 13, 2017. Liquidation sales began on October 19, 2017. The remaining Sears stores closed on January 14, 2018. Store fixtures and equipment from the closed stores were sold until January 26, 2018.https://www.thestar.com/business/2018/01/12/final- sears-stores-close-sunday-marking-the-end-of-an-era.html  Operations during 20th century  = Simpsons-Sears = Sears Canada began its operations as Simpsons-Sears Limited, a catalogue and mid-market suburban retailer that was a joint venture between the Robert Simpson Company Limited, a Canadian department store chain, and Sears, Roebuck and Co. of the United States. In 1952, Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood sent a letter to Simpsons President Edgar G. Burton, proposing a partnership between their two companies in order to serve the Canadian market. The deal to create Simpsons-Sears Limited, a Canadian catalogue and department store chain separate from the Simpson's chain, was signed on September 18, 1952. The new company would be a 50-50 partnership; Simpsons and Sears both invested $20 million and had equal representation on Simpsons-Sears' Board of Directors. The new company had two main objectives: to expand Simpson's mail-order business (which was sold to the new company) and to build a string of stores modelled on Sears' format across the country. The agreement also contained a provision that would become a major challenge in later years. Under its terms, Simpsons-Sears could not open a retail store within 25 miles of Simpsons' existing stores in Toronto, Montreal, Halifax, Regina, and London. In return, Simpsons promised not to build any stores outside of those five cities. Simpsons-Sears' mail-order business, however, was free to operate anywhere in Canada, as was the new Simpsons-Sears Acceptance Company, the credit arm of the operation. The business operations of Simpsons-Sears began when the first Simpsons-Sears Spring/Summer Catalogue was printed by Photo-Engravers and Electrotypers, Ltd. and delivered to 300,000 Canadian homes in early 1953. On September 17, 1953, the first Simpsons-Sears retail store opened in Stratford, Ontario; the second store opened in Kamloops, British Columbia in December of that year. In 1954, Simpsons-Sears opened Canada‚Äôs first large suburban department store, in Vancouver ‚Äì Burnaby, BC, based on new the modern Sears, Roebuck model, spreading across the U.S. Simpsons-Sears introduced the slogan ‚ÄúWe Service What We Sell‚Äù in 1955, backed up by a highly trained nationwide corps of service technicians. In 1963, Simpsons-Sears opened its first full-line store in Quebec, in Quebec City‚Äôs Fleur de Lys complex. The company made its public debut on the Toronto and Montreal stock exchanges on April 5, 1965, with the listing of its Class ‚ÄúA‚Äù non-voting shares. That year, Sears began its long- standing partnership with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada, to support its youth programming. In 1968, Simpsons-Sears became the first Canadian retailer to begin buying products from Mainland China. In 1971, Simpsons-Sears opened a new head office building in downtown Toronto. In 1972, Simpsons and Simpsons- Sears agreed to end the 25-mile restriction and permit Simpsons and Simpsons- Sears stores anywhere. The following year Simpsons-Sears opened a store in the city of Mississauga, approximately west of Toronto. To avoid confusing customers used to Simpsons, new stores were opened under the \\"Sears\\" banner. All existing Simpsons-Sears stores were rebranded to the Sears banner as well. However, the name of the company remained Simpsons-Sears Limited. Also in 1973, Sears achieved its first billion-dollar sales year. In 1974, Simpsons- Sears opened a Sears store at Hillcrest Mall in Richmond Hill, Ontario, its first location in a mall that had a Simpsons store. = Divestiture by Simpsons = In 1978, Simpsons and Simpsons-Sears put forward a plan to merge their businesses. This plan had to have the approval of the Foreign Investment Review Agency, as Sears, Roebuck would become the prime shareholder. Before approval could be attained, the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company made a counter bid and acquired Simpsons Limited. Simpsons‚Äô shares in Simpsons-Sears taken over by The Bay were eventually sold back to Sears, Roebuck. The company was renamed Sears Canada Inc. in 1984 to reflect its independence. The Sears store in Fairview Mall, Toronto, one of the stores acquired from Simpsons in 1991 The paths of Hudson‚Äôs Bay and Sears crossed again in 1991. The Hudson's Bay Company merged its remaining Greater Toronto Simpsons stores into its The Bay division in 1991, and the Simpsons name disappeared from Canada's retail landscape. As a result of this move, Sears Canada took over eight former Simpsons and Bay stores and finally gained a major foothold in Greater Toronto, a market from which it had been excluded by the 1952 agreement with Simpsons. These new stores featured a new 60:40 fashions; hardlines mix and introduced new boutique shop arrangements and fashion lines, such as Le Chateau, Sung, and Rouie. Sears announced, \\"The Store of the Future\\" in 1983. It represented a complete transformation and remodelling of stores along a new product-focused and customer-friendly merchandising program. The first remodelled store, in Mississauga, Ontario, was unveiled in 1985. Stores would be fully retrofitted over the following three years. The Sears Catalogue Club points program began in 1986. The next year, it changed to \\"Sears Club\\" to incorporate all the company's trading channels. The points of the program could no longer be earned from June 22, 2017. = Acquisition of Eaton's = In 1999, Sears Canada acquired the assets and the trademark name of the bankrupt chain The T. Eaton Company Limited. For the first time in its history, Sears Canada gained the leases to a number of prime downtown locations in Toronto (Eaton Centre), Vancouver, Victoria, Winnipeg, Ottawa, and Calgary, all former Eaton's flagship stores. The Simpsons-Sears agreement had largely shut out Sears from the urban core, and that remained so even when the restriction was lifted, as The Bay and Eaton's long held a duopoly in the downtowns of major Canadian cities. Sears Canada had also entertained notions of obtaining the former Eaton downtown Montreal store but that location was eventually occupied by Quebec retailer Les Ailes de la Mode.  Operations during 21st century  = 2000-2009 = Sears relaunched \\"Eatons\\" (rendered with the lowercase \\"e\\" logo) in November 2000 as a seven-store upscale mini- brand, with locations in Vancouver, Victoria, Calgary, Winnipeg, Toronto (Eaton Centre and Yorkdale) and Ottawa, all of which had been flagship Eaton stores. At Yorkdale and Winnipeg's Polo Park, this meant that Sears Canada managed two anchor stores (Eatons and Sears) in those malls for a short time. This operation was unsuccessful, however, and Sears converted the Eatons stores to the Sears brand in 2002. Many said that the Eatons stores were too upscale and/or too thinly scattered across the country for the mini-chain to have ever been profitable and worthwhile. The retail environment has changed with more of the population shopping at big box outlets and specialty stores squeezing out the middle market which is the base of the traditional department store.A National Institution: The Eaton's Chronology The Globe and Mail. February 19, 2002 (table reprinted by Western Libraries) In 2005, Sears Card financial services were outsourced to JPMorgan Chase. Sears received C$3 billion for the sale, and the Sears Club points system was retained by the retailer. Sears also paid a special dividend upon the completion of the transaction. CEO Brent Hollister said that the move would allow Sears to refocus on its retail operations. Sears Canada announced it would end its credit card partnership with JPMorgan Chase when the agreement expires in November 2015. In January 2006, Sears Holdings, the parent company and majority shareholder of Sears Canada, made a bid to purchase the remaining shares to take the company private. Some members of the board opposed the move. A ruling by the Ontario Securities Commission, made in August 2006, stalled progress the attempted privatization by its parent company, Sears Holdings Limited. While the ruling did not dispel the future possibility of the privatization of Sears Canada, it posed a significant obstacle by ruling three major shareholding blocks ineligible to vote as the blocks were given extraordinary privileges by Sears Holdings Limited. On November 14, 2006 Sears Holdings' move to privatize Sears Canada at a bid of $17.97/share fell through by voting amongst the minority shareholder groups. On March 31, 2005, the majority ownership stake was transferred to Sears Holdings, which then owned 73.1% of Sears Canada common shares, while Pershing Square Capital held 17.3%, and the remainder of the shares were publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. On September 26, 2007, Sears Canada announced the sale of its 222 Jarvis Street headquarters to the Government of Ontario. The company relocated its head office to surplus space at its flagship store in the Toronto Eaton Centre. = 2010-2016 = Same-store sales were down 4% in 2010, compared to 6.8% in 2009. In December 2011, after slow sales over the holiday season, Sears laid off 70 employees from its head office after losing nearly $47 million in the previous quarter. In June 2011, Calvin McDonald, formerly of Loblaw Companies, was named president and CEO of Sears Canada. McDonald planned to restructure the company's operations under a three-year plan, in the wake of increased competition and economic uncertainties. He explained that \\"we are in the situation that we are in because we stopped doing the things that make great retailers great. We traded ourselves into this challenge and we will trade ourselves out of it.\\" The company had posted a $44.1 million loss in 2010 but had recovered to $21.9 million by the third quarter of 2011. Among the planned changes were to build upon market segments where Sears had historically performed well (including appliances, dresses, children's wear and related products, and mattresses), and introduce a new store format with a more \\"engaging\\" layout. In 2012, Sears sold three stores in Calgary, Ottawa, and Vancouver (Chinook Centre, Rideau Centre, and Pacific Centre) back to Cadillac Fairview for $170 million. Sears also sold its Deerfoot Mall location in Calgary, as well as its locations at Square One Shopping Centre and Yorkdale Mall. Sears Holdings also distributed shares in the company to Sears Canada's shareholders, reducing its holdings to 51%. Sears Holdings Corporation's chairman and CEO, Edward Lampert, has a 27% stake in Sears Canada. In April 2013, the company began to scale back some of its product offerings, dropping electronics and window coverings, and making toys online-only. In September 2013, Douglas C. Campbell took over as Sears Canada's COO. The following month, Sears Canada announced that it would close five of its major urban stores and sell them back to their respective landlords, including its flagship Toronto Eaton Centre location, as well as two other locations in Toronto, one in London, and one in Richmond, British Columbia. Campbell explained that \\"Unlocking the value of assets is one of the three levers we have said we will use as a way to create total value for the company. When proposals such as this one are presented to us, we must weigh the value of the transaction against the value we will obtain from continuing to operate those stores in their current locations\\". Campbell left Sears Canada in October 2014 and was replaced by Ronald Boire, who served until June 2015. Brandon Stranzl was appointed Executive Chairman in July 2015, continuing in his role as chairman of the board and also assuming the duties of the CEO. In November 2015, Carrie Kirkman was appointed President and Chief Merchant, a role she held until July 2016. In late 2013, SHS Services Management, a Markham, Ontario-based contract partner, went into receivership, but Sears Canada promised to honour home improvement warranty through services offered by SHS on behalf of Sears Canada. On August 24, 2016, Sears Canada unveiled a new corporate logo, consisting of a black wordmark and a red outline of a maple leaf, to replace the blue striped wordmark that had previously been used by the U.S. Sears chain. Company representatives described the new logo as being \\"bold\\" and \\"confident\\". In its second quarter earnings report, Sears Canada announced that it was developing a new store concept dubbed \\"Sears 2.0\\", which it planned to test at several of its current locations. In September 2016, Sears officially unveiled the new store format at its Promenade and Mapleview Centre locations, with a media launch day on September 27, 2016. The new format was designed to have a more open layout with fewer permanent displays and partitions, providing more flexibility in how departments are arranged and stocked. The footwear department was also moved to the centre of the store and switched to a \\"self-serve\\" concept, with product boxes accessible by customers (thus reducing the need for dedicated associates). Stranzl stated that the new format was meant to \\"take ideas from the best in the business, whether it's in shoes, outerwear or appliances\\", and return the chain to a \\"price-focused\\" strategy. The new format was also being implemented as a renovation of the Stone Road Mall location in Guelph. In December 2016, Sears Canada announced plans to add grocery sections in three- to-five remodelled stores in 2017. The selection would be primarily organic, with a focus on low cost and e-commerce.  Bankruptcy and liquidation  On June 13, 2017, citing \\"material uncertainties\\" over whether the company would have enough cash flow to meet its financial obligations over the next year, and \\"significant doubt as to the company's ability to continue as a going concern\\", Sears Canada announced that it had hired advisors to explore a potential restructuring or sale of the company. On June 22, 2017, Sears Canada got court protection from its creditors and announced that it had commenced court-supervised restructuring proceedings under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act, and that it would close a total of 59 stores (including 20 department stores, 15 Sears Home stores, 14 Sears Hometown stores, and 10 Sears Outlet stores) over an unspecified time period. These closures resulted in the loss of 2,900 employees. The company had also been reducing its product assortment to have a larger focus on fashion and home decor, downplaying its automotive, electronics, and tool businesses. The company stated that its new strategies and positioning were \\"starting to resonate with consumers\\", citing increasing same-store sales over the previous two quarters. On July 18, 2017, Sears Canada received court approval to begin liquidating the inventory of the 59 closing locations on July 21, 2017, appointing Gordon Brothers and Merchant Retail Solutions to manage the liquidation of the department and Sears Home stores. Per the formal plan submitted in court documents, the terms \\"bankruptcy\\", \\"going out of business\\", or \\"liquidation\\" could not be used to promote these sales. Liquidation of the Hometown stores was managed by their franchisees. The move to close Hometown stores was criticized by several of their owners; the owners of five Alberta dealers reported that most of their locations were still profitable, and stated that due to the restructuring proceedings, they were losing out on compensation prescribed by their contracts with Sears if the retailer terminates them early. Amid the restructuring, Sears Canada was criticized for its treatment of the laid-off employees, including that the company planned to issue a total of $7.6 million in retention bonuses to 43 executives and senior managers, and $1.6 million to senior employees at stores that are closing, but did not plan to offer severance pay to the laid-off employees. These concerns resulted in calls over social media to boycott the company. Sears Canada defended the decisions, stating that the retention payments were a common practice during these processes, intended to maintain the morale of senior staff as they wind down their stores and that key executives remain with the company through the insolvency process. On August 15, 2017, the company announced that it planned to seek authorization from the Ontario Superior Court to siphon $500,000 from the retention bonuses into an \\"Employee Hardship Fund\\", which would be available to eligible employees. A company representative stated that Sears Canada \\"shares everyone's concerns about the plight faced by some of its former employees, and is glad to see a solution, pending court approval, that can at least help those most in need.\\" The Globe and Mail noted that this arrangement was not a true substitute to severance pay, as affected employees \\"would have collected far more had Sears followed the typical path of giving a few weeks of pay per year of service for terminated employees.\\" On October 2, 2017, Sears Canada announced its intent to seek extended bankruptcy protection as well as the closure of 11 additional stores. A management group led by the company's executive chairman Brandon Stranzl had hoped to take over the retailer but that attempt failed. \\"Following exhaustive efforts, no viable transaction for the company to continue as a going concern was received,\\" Sears Canada announced on October 10, 2017. On the same day, the company stated that it was seeking court approval to liquidate the approximately 130 remaining locations and assets. Sears Canada received Ontario Superior Court approval on October 13, 2017, since there was no viable buyer for the operation; the liquidation process was expected to be completed in 10 to 14 weeks after the beginning of liquidation on October 19, 2017. The closure of all operations led to a loss of jobs for nearly 12,000; roughly three-quarters were part-time employees. Since the pension plan was underfunded by nearly $270 million, the annual benefits received by 17,000 pension plan members was likely to be reduced. In an attempt to moderate the hardship for retirees, a judge had previously ordered payments to other Sears creditors frozen until the pension issue was resolved. While Ontario offers a plan to financially aid such pensioners under its Pension Benefits Act, no other province has a similar program.

Eaton Co. (Eaton's) location A former Sears outlet store in Markham, Ontario =Full-line stores= Simpsons-Sears began operating full-line (department) stores in 1953. Internally, these have been classified by size, volume, and the extent of merchandise selection. In the early decades, classifications were based on a letter designation, mirroring founding American parent, Sears, Roebuck, and Co.: 'A' Stores were large full-line stores, 'B' stores were smaller full- lines, serving more-mid-sized markets, while 'D' stores were early stores serving small markets, normally offering mostly hard-line and home departments, with a catalogue desk. the 'D' stores were phased out in the early 1960s. Small stores, denoted 'S.S.' and serving similar markets to the original 'D' Stores, were introduced in the 1980s. In latter decades, stores have been classified by more descriptive terms, such as 'Select,' 'Core', and 'Small.' When Hometown Dealer Stores were introduced, they mirrored the assortments of the early 'D' stores. =Clearance centres and outlet stores= In 1971, adjacent to its new Kenmore Catalogue Service Centre in Toronto, Simpsons-Sears opened its first new concept \\"Clearance Centre\\", to assist in the rotation of its off-season and marked down catalogue merchandise. The concept was eventually expanded nationwide, offering consumers an off-priced selection of in-house and brand name products. In the 2000s, these stores were renamed \\"Outlet Stores\\" to reflect a broader assortment as well as channel- specific merchandise. Sears full-line stores in some markets were converted to this format in 2014. As of Fall 2016, Sears Canada operated 17 outlet locations. In June 2017 Sears announced 10 remaining outlet stores would also close. =Hometown (Dealer) stores= In 1994, Sears Canada opened its first Hometown Dealer Store in Pembroke, Ontario. The \\"Hometown Stores\\". were designed to serve smaller-sized markets and bring a displayed selection of big ticket merchandise, along with the convenience of a local Catalogue counter, to consumers not near larger Sears stores nor other large retail firms. Stores of this format are operated predominantly in partnership with local community franchisers. =Home stores= In 1995, Sears Canada launched a chain of specialty stores called \\"Sears Whole Home\\" in order to better showcase its home decor offerings. Furniture stores were located in power centres. they were renamed \\"Sears Furniture and Appliances\\" stores in 1999, to reflect the addition of major appliances. In 2003, the Furniture and Appliances stores were renamed \\"Sears Home\\" stores. This change was intended to reflect their broader appeal for customers seeking a one-stop experience for re-making their home decor. The stores' product line was expanded to include home-installed products and services such as floor coverings, customer drapery, and other installed home related products in many locations. In 2004, new off-mall specialty formats were introduced, including four Sears Appliances and Mattresses stores and two Sears (Floor) Coverings Stores. =Online shopping= In 1998, Sears Canada's website, sears.ca, became an active channel, allowing customers to order from a selection of over 500 products. In 2016, the company launched Initium, an initiative to overhaul existing legacy platforms into a new cohesive, functional, adaptable and user-friendly online retail enterprise for consumers. This new site provided for omni-channel availability of orders, integrated logistics and improved search and checkout experiences for customers. In a related move, Sears Canada entered into an agreement with CGI to support Sears strategy to reengineer its technology platforms, with the goal of reducing costs and improving efficiency. After October 19, 2017, the website was no longer available for online purchases and directed shoppers to the remaining stores undergoing liquidation, with a message of thanks to customers. Sears Canada website ceased operations after December 13, 2018, but their social media links with Twitter and Facebook can still be reached despite no activity since the retailer ceased operating. Sears offers options for Canadian cross border shoppers to purchase from US site and pickup at the nearest US stores. International deliver option is not available to Canadians. = Corbeil Appliances = Founded in 1949, Corbeil √âlectrique Inc., better known as Corbeil Appliances, was acquired by Sears Canada in 2005. Corbeil had 26 locations in Quebec, but closed its four locations in Toronto and Ottawa. As a part of the bankruptcy protection process, Corbeil was sold to Am-Cam √âlectrom√©nagers Inc., headquartered in Montreal, for an undisclosed amount. Am-Cam is the parent company of Distinctive Appliances and the sale was completed in December 2017.

The headquarters moved there from 222 Jarvis Street after that building was sold in 2007. The lower four floors of the Eaton Centre location remained in use for retail, including a three-floor Nordstrom store from fall 2016 onwards, while the upper four floors continued as Sears Canada headquarters. This headquarters remained active until the retailer completed liquidation on January 14, 2018.

For Canadian and overseas vendor suppliers, it maintained a Vendor Code of Conduct which, amongst other things, prohibits the use of child labour. Among some of Sears house brands over time: Craftsman was Sears' line of hardware, lawn and garden equipment, and work wear. In 2009, readers of Popular Mechanics named Craftsman their favourite brand of hand tools in their Reader's Choice Awards. The Craftsman trademark was registered by Sears, Roebuck and Co. on May 20, 1927. Arthur Barrows, head of the company's hardware department, liked the name Craftsman and reportedly bought the rights to use it from the Marion-Craftsman Tool Company for $500. The line has been carried in Canada since Simpsons-Sears began operating in 1953, first alongside such Simpson‚Äôs hardware brands as Beaver. Sears tool line, like many of its other product lines, uses a \\"good, better, best\\" pricing structure, with the Craftsman brand as the middle tier and Craftsman Professional or Craftsman Industrial as the highest tier. The lower, value-priced tier was branded Sears. The \\"Dunlap\\" name was also used for from the late 1930s until the late 1950s. The Sears tool line was discontinued in the late 1980s and replaced by the \\"Companion\\" tool line. The Companion tool line was discontinued and replaced by the \\"Evolv'\\" tool line in 2008, with a focus on homeowners and do-it-yourselfers. Kenmore was Sears Canada's primary line of household appliances. The first Kenmore branded product was a washing machine marketed by Sears, Roebuck and Co. in 1927. The first Kenmore vacuum cleaners were sold in the U.S. in 1932. Simpsons-Sears began selling the Kenmore line in Canada in 1953. Kenmore's upscale line of appliances is known as the Elite line. Kenmore also has a professional line of appliances called Kenmore Pro. In the 1960s and 1970s, many housewares and personal electrics in the line were branded ‚ÄúLady Kenmore‚Äù but its use was discontinued with the rise of sexism sensitivities. Silvertone was the brand name used by Sears, Roebuck and Co. for its line of sound, radio, stereo and home entertainment equipment from 1915 to 1972 and by Simpsons-Sears in Canada from 1953 to 1972. Probably best known for the line of inexpensive guitars, the brand became popular with novice musicians. Jerry Garcia, Chet Atkins, Bob Dylan, John Fogerty, Jack White, Mark Knopfler, and Brad Paisley had a Silvertone for their first electric, bass, or acoustic guitar. The Canadian band Chad Allan and The Silvertones, which became The Guess Who, took its name from this line of instruments. Pete Townshend would employ them in live performance with The Who for the purposes of smashing them. The name was placed on guitars from several different manufacturers over the years, including Danelectro, National, Harmony, Kay, and Teisco. The guitars, especially the 1960s models, are prized by collectors. 'Coldspot was a Sears brand that existed from 1928 to 1976. The brand was created for a line of refrigerators. Other products sold under the Coldspot brand included freezers, dehumidifiers, and window air conditioning units. Sears, Roebuck had supplied this brand to Eaton‚Äôs for distribution in Canada, but the line switched it to Simpsons-Sears upon its founding. Jessica was Sears Canada‚Äôs primary private label brand of women‚Äôs apparel and accessories, catering to the modern woman. It was introduced in 1987 and was the top-selling ladies‚Äô fashion label in Canada. The brand was later renamed Jess near the closure of the brand. Attitude was a fashion-forward ladies‚Äô fashion collection appealing to fashion conscious women. It had been an Eaton‚Äôs exclusive house brand and Sears continued the name. In 2010, when Canadian fashion designer Jay Manuel became its exclusive designer, the line became Attitude by Jay Manuel. Manuel also added a men‚Äôs dresswear line to the collection. In 2013, Sears entered into a strategic alliance with the ALDO Group to design and manufacture Sears entire line of Attitude and Nevada footwear for men and women. 'Nevada was Sears Canada‚Äôs main line of denim and casual wear for both children and adults. Introduced along with a revamp of apparel house brands in 1987. It followed in the footsteps of another long- popular but more utilitarian Sears jeans line, \\"Toughskins\\", which dominated in the 1970s. In 2013, Sears entered into a strategic alliance with Buffalo International Inc. to design and manufacture Sears' entire line of Nevada denim-based apparel (cited above). In 2016, with the rollout of the Sears 2.0 concept, Sears Canada amalgamated most of its house brands into the Sears Woman, Sears Man, Sears Kids and Sears Home labels. In 2017, Canadian Tire agreed to acquire rights to the Viking appliance brand, but eventually Viking Range, LLC ended up owning the brand and Indigo Books and Music acquired the Calgary Distribution Centre.

Name  The name Dogrib is an English adaptation of their own name, (or ) - ‚ÄúDog-Flank People‚Äù, referring to their fabled descent from a supernatural dog-man. Like their Dene neighbours they called themselves often simply (\\"person\\", \\"human\\") or (\\"People, i.e. Dene People\\"). The T≈Çƒ±Ã®ch«´'s land is known as (or , or ). On the 1682 Franquelin map, Dogrib was recorded as \\"Alimousp[i]goiak\\" (from Cree , \\"Dog-Flanks\\").

Fort Rae in 1937 The or Dogrib language belongs to the Athabaskan languages, which are part of the Na-Den√© languages family. The dialect spoken in the communities of Dettah and Ndil«´ developed from intermarriage between Yellowknives and T≈ÇƒØch«´.  Treaty Process  = Yellowknife B Band (Treaty No. 8 Dogrib) = In June 1899, negotiation began on Treaty No. 8, which covered 840,000 square kilometers in the Northwest Territory. It was an agreement between the Canadian Government and the Dene groups in the area in question; in return for their willingness to share their land with non-Natives, the Dene would receive medical and educational assistance, as well as treaty payments. The Canadian Government and the various Dene groups, including Yellowknives and T≈ÇƒØch«´ under chief Drygeese with headmen Benaiyah and Sek'eglinan, signed the treaty in 1900 at Fort Resolution (called by the T≈ÇƒØch«´ ƒÆnd√†√†). After the signing, the group that signed the treaty was called the \\"Yellowknife B Band\\" (Helm, 7: 1994). At that point in history, Treaty No.8 was the largest land settlement the Canadian Government had ever made (PWNHC, Historical).The Dogrib = Dog Rib Rae Band (Treaty No. 11 Dogrib) = Twenty years after Treaty No. 8 was signed, oil was discovered in the Mackenzie River Valley. Upon the discovery, the Canadian Government proposed another treaty that would clear the way for miners and development of the area. The treaty was greatly debated, as the Natives did not want to lose their right to hunt, fish, gather, and trap in the area. They also opposed being \\"confined to Indian reserves.\\" Many Dene felt that Treaty No. 8 was not honored by the Canadian Government, and some were afraid that this treaty would turn out similarly. Nevertheless, Treaty No. 11 was signed by the T≈ÇƒØch«´ trading chief Monfwi in the summer of 1921. The T≈ÇƒØch«´ groups that signed this treaty were then known as the \\"Dog Rib Rae Band\\" (Helm, 7: 1994), constituting the majority of the T≈ÇƒØch«´ population. Both Treaty No. 8 and Treaty No. 11 overlap in several of their boundaries, and continue to cause conflict between the two separate treaty bands (nowadays two First Nations). Not all members of the Dene and T≈ÇƒØch«´ communities agreed with or signed these treaties. In the fall of 1992, the T≈ÇƒØch«´ submitted their own regional claim to the Canadian government. Negotiations were scheduled to begin in 1994 between the Yellowknife B Band (Treaty No. 8 Dogrib) and the Dog Rib Rae Band (Treaty No. 11 Dogrib), but the Yellowknife B Band refused to enter into negotiations. This complicated matters, as both treaty groups had land boundaries that overlapped each other. Self-governance seemed to be the issue between the two groups, as both wanted to have their say in the agreement. This halted the negotiations in 1994 while the Canadian government explored the boundary and self-government issue. A new mandate in April 1997 allowed negotiation of a \\"joint land claims and self-government agreement with the Dogrib Treaty 11 Council\\" (Treaty No. 11 Dogrib). In 1999, the Agreement- in-Principle was available for Dogrib approval and was accepted on January 7, 2000. Ninety-three percent of the Dog Rib Rae Band (Treaty No. 11 Dogrib) turned out to vote with over 84% voting for the agreement. After several community discussions and revisions, in March 2003 the Chief Negotiators initialed the agreement.  T≈ÇƒØch«´ First Nations  = Yellowknives Dene First Nation (formerly Yellowknife B Band) = The Yellowknife B Band (Treaty No. 8 Dogrib) formed the Yellowknives Dene First NationYellowknivesYellowknives Dene First Nation in 1991 following the collapse of this territorial-wide comprehensive land claim negotiation.

The Yellowknives Dene First Nation (known by themselves as Weledeh Yellowknives Dene)History and Culture of Weledeh Yellowknives Dene is the umbrella organization for the Dettah Yellowknives Dene First Nation (or - 'Burnt Point' in T≈ÇƒØch«´, referring to a traditional Dene fishing camp) and Ndil«´ Yellowknives Dene First Nation ( ). They speak the Dettah-Ndil«´ dialect of T≈ÇƒØch«´ and are descendants of T≈ÇƒØch«´, Yellowknives and Chipewyan. = Tlicho Government (formerly Dog Rib Rae Band) =  The Tlicho Agreement  The act of signing the agreement began the ratification process for the Tlicho Agreement. On Thursday, August 4, 2005, the Tlicho Agreement went into full effect, \\"The first official day of the Tlicho Government and the Tlicho community governments\\" (Tlicho Effective Date). On August 25, 2003, they signed a land claims agreement, also called T≈ÇƒØch«´, as the Tlicho Government, with the Government of Canada. The agreement will cede a area between Great Bear Lake and Great Slave Lake in the NWT to T≈ÇƒØch«´ ownership. The territory includes the communities of Behchok«´ÃÄ,History and Culture of Behchoko Gam√®ti,History and Culture of Gam√®ti WekweetiHistory and Culture of Wekweeti and What√¨History and Culture of Whati along with Diavik Diamond Mine and Ekati Diamond Mine. The four T≈ÇƒØch«´ bands, Dog Rib Rae First Nation, Wha Ti First Nation, Gameti First Nation and Dechi Laot'i First Nations, as well as their umbrella Dogrib Treaty 11 Council, ceased to exist on August 4, 2005 and have been succeeded by the Tlicho Government. The T≈ÇƒØch«´ will have their own legislative bodies in the area's four communities, of which the chiefs must be T≈ÇƒØch«´, though anyone may run for councillor and vote. The legislatures will have, among other authorities, the power to collect taxes, levy resource royalties, which currently go to the federal government, and control hunting, fishing and industrial development. The T≈ÇƒØch«´ will also receive payments of $152 million over 15 years and annual payments of approximately $3.5 million. The federal government will retain control of criminal law, as it does across Canada, and the NWT will control services such as health care and education. This land-claims process took twenty years to conclude. A similar process with the Inuit in the NWT brought about the creation of the new territory of Nunavut. Though T≈ÇƒØch«´ will not be a separate territory, the extent of its powers has invited comparisons both with the birth of Nunavut and with the creation of the NWT government in 1967.

During his career, he obtained 129 patents covering a variety of electric devices. In 1913, he also patented an all-steel vacuum bottle, and formed the Stanley Bottle Company. Early life Stanley was born November 28, 1858 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of William Stanley and Elizabeth A. Parsons Stanley. William Jr. attended Williston Seminary and later graduated from Yale University with the class of 1881. Career Stanley was as an electrician working with tele keys and fire alarms of an early manufacturer. In Philadelphia, Stanley designed one of the first electrical installations (at a Fifth Avenue store). Shortly thereafter, George Westinghouse hired Stanley as his chief engineer at his Pittsburgh factory. In 1885, Stanley built the first practical alternating current transformer based on Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs' prototype of 1881. This device was the precursor to the modern transformer. In December, under a new contract with Westinghouse, Stanley moved his operations to Great Barrington, Massachusetts. In 1886, on March 20, Stanley demonstrated the first complete system of high voltage Alternating Current transmission, consisting of generators, transformers and high-voltage transmission lines. His system allowed the distribution of electrical power over wide areas. He used the system to light offices and stores along the main street of Great Barrington - the location of his West Avenue family home. Stanley's transformer design became a prototype for future transformers, and his AC distribution system formed the basis of modern electrical power distribution. His work in the electrification of Great Barrington's Main Street was named an IEEE Milestone. Agreeing that the AC system had arrived, Westinghouse further tested the system in summer 1886 in Pittsburgh; it transmitted over a distance of 3 miles, and used an alternator designed by Stanley to replace the Siemens model, which regulated voltage poorly. Satisfied with the pilot system, Westinghouse began commercial production and shipped his company's first commercial to Buffalo NY, where a local utility placed it in service. Orders for 25 alternating-current plants followed within months.Thomas Parke Hughes, Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society, 1880-1930, p.103-104, (1993) In 1890, Stanley founded the Stanley Electric Manufacturing Company in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. In 1903 the General Electric Corporation purchased a controlling interest in the firm. The land on which the company once stood is now the site of the William Stanley Business Park of the Berkshires in Pittsfield.William Stanley Business Park =Patents= The practical coil circuits were the prototypes for the modern transformers.

Its final hosts were Beverly Thomson and Marci Ien, with Jeff Hutcheson presenting the weather forecast and sports. The program aired on weekdays, and was produced from CTV's facilities at 9 Channel Nine Court in Scarborough, Toronto. In addition to CTV's local owned-and-operated stations (O&Os;) in Eastern Canada as well as affiliate station CITL-DT Lloydminster, the program also aired on independent station CJON-DT (NTV) in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as CTV News Channel, the network's 24-hour national news service. The program previously aired on CTV's O&Os; in Western Canada, until they launched their own all-local morning news programmes called CTV Morning Live in August 29, 2011. History CTV's first attempt at a morning show, Bright and Early, launched in 1966 and was cancelled the next year; among the presenter lineup was future federal Liberal cabinet minister Jim Fleming, who read the news headlines.Nolan, p.84 Ray Peters, the head of Vancouver's CTV affiliate CHAN-TV, had been an avid viewer of NBC's Today Show, and lobbied CTV to reinstate a morning program in order to compete with the American networks.Nolan, p.160 Peters had intended the show to be produced out of Vancouver, but agreed to a Toronto-based production in order to bring CFTO-TV's owner John Bassett on board. The 90-minute program launched under the title Canada AM on September 11, 1972, with Carole Taylor and Percy Saltzman as hosts,Nolan, p.161Gittins, p.108 and Dennis McIntosh as newsreader. Taylor left the show in 1973 to host W5, and was succeeded by Elaine Callei; however, Callei left the program within a few months, and was in turn succeeded by Helen Hutchinson,Gittins, p.110 who for a time hosted concurrently with her tenure as co-host of the evening newsmagazine series, W5. Long-time host Norm Perry joined in 1975 and would remain with the programme until 1990, making him the longest-running co-host in the show's history.http://canadaam.ctvnews.ca/40 =Prior to 2008= For most of the 1990s and 2000s, Canada AM had a consistent running time of two and a half hours, airing between 6:30 and 9:00 a.m. local time, with most affiliates repeating the previous night's late local news at 6:00 a.m. As the program is produced live for the Eastern Time Zone, the program would be \\"delayed\\" in Atlantic Canada to 7:30-10:00 AT / 8:00-10:30 NT. The first half-hour would typically consist of a rundown of news headlines, sports, and weather, followed by a lengthy business news segment currently produced by Business News Network; for a few years the 6:30 half-hour was in fact a semi-autonomous program known as AM Business. From 7:00 on, the program used a format more in line with its U.S. counterparts. In its final seasons as CTV's Vancouver affiliate, CHAN-TV (known on air as BCTV) would pre-empt the first 30 minutes in favour of its own morning newscast, and eventually delayed the remainder of Canada AM by an hour, i.e. 8 to 10 a.m. (it did not carry the additional hour discussed below). The program also includes opt-outs for news updates from a local anchor at each station at the end of each half-hour. The network would always produce an alternate national segment for stations not using the opt- outs, as well as CTV News Channel. In fall 2000, CTV decided to match NBC's expansion of Today by adding another hour of Canada AM from 9:00 to 10:00 a.m. local, which aired on O&Os; and some affiliates. This would include a \\"coffee talk\\" segment as well as other lifestyle features. As a result, CTV dropped the recently renamed Live with Regis and Kelly. As Live continued to have strong ratings stateside, the Canadian network re-added the talk show in fall 2001, bumping the \\"coffee talk\\" hour to 10:00 a.m. in most areas, before abandoning the final hour entirely later in the season. During the early to mid-1990s, Canada AM also aired a one-hour weekend edition, although this was essentially a \\"best-of\\" package of that week's regular shows. Another weekend program, Good Morning Canada, was launched in the early 2000s but was also pre-taped using segments from local stations; it was cancelled in 2009. Canada AM underwent a format change on January 28, 2008, which saw the show expand to six hours of live programming between 6 a.m. and noon ET every weekday.Canada AM moving to unique six-hour format , CTV.ca, January 9, 2008 Local CTV stations across the country aired Canada AM live between 6 and 9 a.m. local time (7 and 10 a.m. Atlantic Time, 7:30 and 10:30 a.m. Newfoundland Time), while the complete six-hour, live edition aired on CTV Newsnet. Between 6:00 and 6:30 am ET was Early Edition, originally aired only in the Eastern, Atlantic and Newfoundland time zones, while it still aired on CTV Newsnet. The format change was marked by the addition of a second on-air team from CTV British Columbia in Western Canada, consisting of host Mi-Jung Lee and weather presenter Rena Heer in Vancouver, and news anchor Omar Sachedina in Toronto. The shift from the Eastern to Western hosting teams took place at 7 a.m. PT (10 a.m. ET), meaning that only viewers in Alberta, British Columbia and part of Saskatchewan saw the western team on their local CTV station, although all other Canadians could watch the western team on CTV Newsnet or out-of-market CTV stations carried by cable providers. On June 6, 2008, CKNW in Vancouver reported the cancellation of the Vancouver-based portions of Canada AM. Biographies of Mi-Jung Lee and Rena Heer were taken off the show's website the same day. CTV announced that it would revert to the program's original format (the additional 6:00-6:30 half-hour will continue as well), stating that the decision was in response to viewer feedback from western Canada indicating a preference for the prior format.CTV press release , June 6, 2008 A few weeks prior, CTV cancelled the extra local news segments that appeared at :00 and :30 minutes past the hour, reverting to updates only at :25 and :55 minutes past the hour. Following the cancellation of the western edition, CTV continued to produce the 9:00 ET hour of Canada AM until September 2008. During those three months, CTV Newsnet aired 4 hours of Canada AM from 6:00-10:00 ET (3:00-7:00 PT), and 2 hours of its own news content from 10:00 a.m. to noon ET to replace the cancelled western edition. CTV British Columbia also reverted to its original local updates (until they were cancelled in March 2009). The 9:00 ET hour of Canada AM was handled differently on the main network depending on the time zone: * Eastern, Atlantic and Newfoundland Time Zone viewers did not notice a schedule difference at all because the 9:00 ET edition was only available on cable. * Pacific Time Zone viewers were able to see the second and third hour of the eastern edition, but the first hour was preempted with the live 9:00 ET edition at 6:00 PT. The first hour of the eastern edition could only be viewed on CTV Newsnet between 3:00-4:00 a.m. PT. After the 9:00 ET hour of Canada AM was cancelled, CTV Newsnet (later rebranded as CTV News Channel) began airing an extra hour of its own news content, presented by Marci Ien. From that point onward, the program aired without deviations in every time zone, including Early Edition at 6:00 AM. =2009 to 2016= In March 2009, CTV stopped producing local opt-out news updates in most markets in order to reduce costs at its local stations.CTV cuts 24 staff at Canada AM across the country, axes Montreal morning newscast, Canadian Press, March 10, 2009 The two exceptions are CTV Toronto (where Canada AM is produced) and CTV Atlantic (which reuses the staff already on hand for sister channel CTV Two Atlantic's morning show). Private affiliate NTV also continues to utilize the opt-out for local news updates. As part of Bell Canada's re-acquisition of CTV in 2011, CTV's new owner Bell Media announced the launch of new all-local morning newscasts (titled CTV Morning Live) to be produced at the network's stations in Winnipeg, Regina, Saskatoon, Edmonton, Calgary, and Vancouver effective fall 2011. (In the latter three markets, local morning newscasts on Global stations usually had higher ratings than Canada AM at that point.) As a result, Canada AM no longer aired on CTV's owned-and-operated stations in Western Canada, and is instead available only via CTV News Channel, or out-of-market CTV stations from Lloydminster or Eastern Canada. The new programs complement existing local morning shows produced under the Bell Media corporate umbrella in Eastern Canada, namely CP24 Breakfast in Toronto, and CTV Morning Live in Ottawa and Atlantic Canada. However, the existing programs did not replace Canada AM on the CTV stations in their respective markets; instead they air on co-owned local outlets (CP24, CTV Two Ottawa and CTV Two Atlantic respectively) in competition with the national show. Seamus O'Regan left the show on November 24, 2011 to become a correspondent for CTV National News. Marci Ien took over as co-host upon returning from maternity leave on January 9, 2012. No replacement for Ien's previous position as newsreader was named, and the duty of reading the news headlines at the top of each half-hour alternated between Thomson and Ien. On June 2, 2016, after nearly 44 years on the air, CTV announced that Canada AM had been cancelled, and would air a series finale the next day. The following Monday, June 6, the program's replacement, Your Morning, was announced. It is hosted by Anne-Marie Mediwake and Ben Mulroney. Ien soon joined The Social as a substitute cohost after Traci Melchor took a leave of absence, and became permanent cohost of the show in 2017,\\"Former 'Canada AM' host Marci Ien new co-host of 'The Social'\\".

On the horizon is Trellick Tower. The Westway is a elevated dual carriageway section of the A40 trunk road in West London running from Paddington in the east to North Kensington in the west. It connects the London Inner Ring Road to the West London suburbs. The road was constructed between 1962 and 1970 to connect the proposed London Ringways motorway scheme to Paddington, and opened as the A40(M). It was the first urban motorway project in London and attracted criticism for the lack of care over the environment, the well-being of local residents and communities, and handling those whose homes would be demolished. Road protests increased following its opening. In 2000, the Westway was downgraded to an all-purpose road after the formation of Transport for London. The road has become a significant London landmark and has been noted in several works of popular culture. Route Walking Man and Standing Man near Paddington. The Westway with the westbound carriageway of the Harrow Road (A404) on the lower tier. The road is long and is located in the City of Westminster and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. At its eastern end, the Westway starts to the west of the Marylebone Flyover (A501), which takes traffic over the junction of Edgware Road (A5) and Marylebone Road (part of the London Inner Ring Road). Between the Westway and the flyover, a section of surface-level road allows westbound traffic from the flyover to turn-off on to the Harrow Road (A404) or eastbound traffic from the Harrow Road to access the flyover. Eastbound traffic from the Westway cannot exit here to reach the Edgware Road and continues on to the flyover. Heading west, the Westway rises as it passes Paddington Green and crosses the Grand Union Canal branch to Paddington Basin. As the road passes Westbourne Green on the north and Royal Oak Underground Station on the south, it gains a lane from a climbing slip-road from Gloucester Terrace. Eastbound, one lane diverges from the mainline to a sliproad crossing the railway to Paddington station via Westbourne Bridge. The bridge once carried traffic from Harrow Road to Bishops Bridge Road but was blocked at the north end and appropriated for the Westway scheme. Continuing westward, the Westway runs parallel with the Great Western main line, before turning south-west at Westbourne Park and crossing the railway to run immediately adjacent to London Underground's Hammersmith & City line as far as Ladbroke Grove station. The road then returns to an east-west alignment to the elevated roundabout junction with the West Cross Route (A3220) and flyover above this, crossing the Central line and Wood Lane (A219) before returning to ground level and continuing to the junction with Old Oak Common Lane where Westway connects end-on to the eastern end of Western Avenue. From the elevated road between Westbourne Park and Ladbroke Grove, Trellick Tower is visible to the north; east of the roundabout, the site of Grenfell Tower is visible to the south. With the extension westward of the London Congestion Charge Zone between 19 February 2007 and 4 January 2011, the part of the road between Westbourne Park and the Westway roundabout that passed through the zone was designated as a \\"free through route\\" that allowed vehicles to cross the zone without paying the charge. Background The elevated roundabout connecting the Westway with the West Cross Route, 1970 The Westway was built as an extension of Western Avenue to form a link from Paddington to Ringway 1, the innermost circuit of the London Ringways network, part of a complex and comprehensive plan for a network of high speed roads circling and radiating out from central London designed to manage and control the flow of traffic. This plan had developed from early schemes prior to World War II through Patrick Abercrombie's County of London Plan, published in 1943, and the following year's Greater London Plan, to a 1960s Greater London Council (GLC) scheme that would have involved the construction of motorway- standard roads across the city, requiring substantial demolition. The elevated roundabout junction with the West Cross Route was built with the capability to be extended once the planned northern continuation of the latter road was constructed to Harlesden. Two stubs on the roundabout's north side were built for the connection of slip roads and the alignment of the slip roads between the West Cross Route and the roundabout avoided the planned line of the road to the north. Proposed Motorways in Central London scheme from the mid-1960s, showing the Westway Construction The Westway running above a rerouted Harrow Road as a double-decked road structure The Westway was funded by the GLC with a 25% grant from central government. The main contractor was John Laing & Sons, while the flyovers at the eastern end were engineered by Sir Bruce White and Partners. The road was planned to support three lanes in each direction, but was upgraded to include hard shoulders in 1966. The route was chosen to follow the easiest path from Western Avenue to Paddington which paralleled existing railway lines. To the east, the GLC had purchased slums between Harrow Road and the Grand Union Canal for redevelopment, and the Westway was planned to run along the southern edge of this. An elevated road was cheaper to construct and required less land to be directly built on, and had worked well for previous road construction projects, such as elevated section of the M4 from Chiswick to Langley and the Five Ways interchange at Hendon. However, passing an eight lane elevated motorway through a densely populated area involved the clearance of a large number of buildings adjacent to the railway, particularly in the area west of Westbourne Park, where several roads were truncated or demolished to make way for the concrete structures. London County Council architect Hubert Bennett speculated that some sections of the road viaduct would pass within of people's homes. Compulsory purchases of properties began in 1962, with an estimated 3,356 people needing to be rehoused. Many properties on the line of the route were put on short-term rental or left derelict. The local area was disrupted by the flow of heavy goods traffic moving materials to the construction site and taking spoil away. The road was mostly constructed from pre-stressed and post- tensioned concrete, which was cast offsite and moved into position as required. Tensioning cables were then passed through conduits cast into the sections and tightened to achieve the bearing capacity necessary to carry the weight of traffic. Joints between sections were minimised in order to provide a smoother journey. The road was designed with a main speed of aside from the sliproads, which were designed for . All elevated sections of the road were designed to support HA loading plus 45 units of HB loading in any direction. Prince Charles visited the construction work in 1968, aged nineteen. The road was opened to traffic by the Minister of Transport John Peyton and junior transport minister Michael Heseltine on 28 July 1970 at a total cost of ¬£30 million (¬£ million in ), and classified A40(M). At its opening the road was the largest continuous elevated structure in Europe and was constructed with some advanced features, such as heating grids on slopes to control the formation of ice. After completion a corridor of wasteland remained below the motorway, which the government had no plans to develop. Environment Route of Westway, West Cross Route and Marylebone Flyover overlaid on 1957 Ordnance Survey map showing areas which were demolished for the roads' construction The Westway was planned and constructed in an era before environmental impacts were routinely considered, and it caused controversy at the time for the effects it and the vehicles it carried had upon the local community and the environment. At the opening ceremony, Heseltine was jeered by protesters armed with placards. A group of squatters moved into vacant houses on Freston Road near to those demolished for the Westway, forming a so-called \\"independent state\\" of Frestonia. Acklam Road was redeveloped as flats following residents' complaints about noise from the Westway. Residents on Acklam Road, which ran parallel to the Westway between Ladbroke Grove and Westbourne Park, draped a large banner across several houses reading \\"Get us out of this hell! Rehouse us now!\\" Locals complained about having to use Westbourne Terrace and Gloucester Terrace, both residential streets with several listed buildings, as access roads for the Westway. Shortly after opening, a group of residents planned to blockade the motorway and stop traffic in protest at the excessive noise of the road. Eight houses on Walmer Road, North Kensington, severed by the construction of the Westway, were planned to be demolished and their residents re-homed, but there were no plans for other nearby properties. Until 1973, there was no legal obligation to compensate anyone living outside the boundaries of the highway, no matter how close their property was or what nuisance the road may have caused. Attempts have been made to regenerate the once-abandoned land. On 9 August 1970, the Westway was closed for an hour after a group of 80 protesters marched along the road carrying placards. Four people were arrested. The following month, the GLC announced that a further 28 homes on Walmer Road would be compulsory purchased and the residents moved, in order to build a new school. In March 1971, it was announced that all 41 homes on Acklam Road would be demolished. By 1972, it had been estimated approximately 5,000 families had lost their homes for each mile of the Westway constructed. In 1974, the GLC announced of land in Notting Hill to the north of the Westway would be compulsory purchased and redeveloped with new apartments and screening walls to reduce noise from the motorway. The project has since been condemned for the negative effect it had on local communities and housing, and contributed to the increased interest in anti-road protesting. The British Road Federation called the Westway \\"one of the insensitive and socially unacceptable examples of motorways.\\" The North Kensington Playspace Group was established in 1966 by Adam Ritchie, who strongly criticised the Westway, saying \\"a more inappropriate and negative use for the space could not be imagined\\". The North Kensington Amenity Trust (now Westway Development Trust), was founded in 1971 to develop the land for local community use. Since 2000, local charity Urban Eye has initiated a programme of cleaning, painting, and lighting to improve the visual appearance and safety of the areas under the flyover structure. Aftermath Because of the construction costs and public opposition of the Westway, most of the London Ringways scheme was cancelled in 1973. The Westway, the West Cross Route and East Cross Route in east London were the only significant parts to be built. Other parts of the Ringway network were later built as all-purpose roads, including the M11 link road from Hackney to Redbridge, which drew major protests and opposition. Westway lost its motorway status in May 2000 when responsibility for trunk roads in Greater London was transferred from the Highways Agency to the Greater London Authority. In 2013, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, announced parts of the Westway would be reconstructed to allow a separated cycleway to be built on it. The space required would be provided by reducing vehicle capacity. Cultural references The Westway running through the streetscape of London. The Westway is referred to in J. G. Ballard's 1973 novel Crash. The following year's Concrete Island was set in a junction between motorways, one of which is the Westway. In the novel, the protagonist has an accident on the road while speeding and is consequently stranded in waste ground between motorways with nobody able to help. The 1997 murder mystery A Certain Justice by P. D. James was set in an area being demolished for the Westway, referring to houses \\"rising in great choking clouds of ochre dust\\". Chris Petit's 1979 road movie Radio On includes several shots of the Westway. The land underneath the road was used as a setting for riots in the films Breaking Glass and Sammy and Rosie Get Laid. Westway was a BBC World Service radio series that ran from 1997 until 2005. It featured the community surrounding the road. The Westway has featured in songs by several British rock bands. The Clash referred to the road in \\"London's Burning\\", and the group's Joe Strummer described their music as \\"the sound of the Westway\\". The group's documentary Westway to the World is named after the road. The cover for The Jam's 1977 album This Is the Modern World was taken under the Westway. Blur's 1993 song \\"For Tomorrow\\" mentions that the protagonist couple in the song are \\"lost on the Westway\\", and the road is mentioned in two other songs by the band, \\"Fool's Day\\" and \\"Under the Westway\\". Dirty Pretty Things refer to the Westway in the song \\"Truth Begins\\"; the opening lyrics are \\"The Westway walls so tall and bleak / Reflect the words we dare not speak\\". Local group Hawkwind played several free benefit and charity concerts underneath the motorway, pictures of which appeared on the inner sleeve of their second album In Search of Space. The opening track on Sky's 1979 debut album is entitled \\"Westway\\". The Westway is referenced in Pete Doherty's \\"Broken Love Song\\", in the line \\"By the Westway, Inside The Scrubs\\", as he claimed to have once lived beside the Westway in a caravan. It is also featured on the front cover of A Weekend in the City by Bloc Party. The picture, part of A Modern Project was taken by German photographer Rut Blees Luxemburg. Judi Dench‚Äôs character, Jean Pargetter, was late to a job interview in season 3, episode 7 (1994) of the Britcom ‚ÄúAs Time Goes By;‚Äù Jean attributed her tardiness to a traffic jam on the Westway. The job candidate, Sally Curtis, snarkily stated that she had arrived (on time) via the Westway but that she had checked the radio for traffic conditions prior to departing thus allowing herself plenty of time.

It also refers to an error made during a live radio or TV broadcast or news report, usually in terms of misspoken words or technical errors. The term blooper was popularized in the 1950s and 1960s in a series of record albums produced by Kermit Schafer entitled Pardon My Blooper, in which the definition of a blooper is thus given by the record series' narrator: \\"Unintended indiscretions before microphone and camera.\\" Bloopers are often the subject of television programs and may be shown during the closing credits of comedic films or TV episodes. Prominent examples of films with bloopers include Cheaper by the Dozen and Rush Hour. Jackie Chan and Burt Reynolds are both famous for including such reels with the closing credits of their movies. In recent years, many CGI-animated films have also incorporated bloopers, including a mix of faked bloopers, genuine voice-actor mistakes set to animation, and technical errors. Examples can be found in A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters, Inc., Valiant, some Barbie films, and the Indian film Roadside Romeo. Humorous mistakes made by athletes are often referred to as bloopers as well, particularly in baseball.  Origins  =United States= The term \\"blooper\\" was popularized in America by television producer Kermit Schaefer in the 1950s; the terms \\"boner\\" (meaning a boneheaded mistake) and \\"breakdown\\" had been in common usage previously. Schaefer produced a long- running series of Pardon My Blooper! record albums in the 1950s and 1960s which featured a mixture of actual recordings of errors from television and radio broadcasts and re-creations. Schaefer also transcribed many reported bloopers into a series of books that he published up until his death in 1979. Schaefer was by no means the first to undertake serious study and collection of broadcast errata; NBC's short-lived \\"behind-the-scenes\\" series Behind The Mike (1940‚Äì41) occasionally featured reconstructions of announcers' gaffes and flubs as part of the \\"Oddities in Radio\\" segment, and movie studios such as Warner Brothers had been producing so-called \\"gag reels\\" of outtakes (usually for employee-only viewing) since the 1930s. As recently as 2003, the Warner Brothers Studio Tour included a screening of bloopers from classic films as part of the tour. =United Kingdom= Jonathan Hewat (1938‚Äì2014), who had a vast personal collection of taped broadcasting gaffes, was the first person in the UK to broadcast radio bloopers, on a bank holiday show on BBC Radio Bristol at the end of the 1980s. He subsequently produced and presented a half-hour show on that station called So You Want to Run a Radio Station?. This was nominated for a Sony Award. The transmission of humorous mistakes, previously considered private material only for the ears of industry insiders, came to the attention of BBC Radio 2. They commissioned a series of six fifteen-minute programmes called Can I Take That Again?, produced by Jonathan James Moore (then Head of BBC Light Entertainment, Radio). The success of this series led to a further five series on Radio 2 (the programme ran from 1985 to 1990), as well as a small number of programmes (called Bloopers) on BBC Radio 4. Some of the earliest clips in Hewat's collection went back to Rudy Vallee \\"corpsing\\" (giggling uncontrollably) during a recording of \\"There Is a Tavern in the Town\\" in one of the very earliest OBs (Outside Broadcasts) of The Illumination of the Fleet. Television shows Comedian Dick Emery showcased his own out-takes as an epilogue entitled \\"A Comedy of Errors\\" to his BBC shows in the mid-1970s. The later ITV show It'll Be Alright on the Night (originally hosted by Denis Norden) showed out-takes from film and TV. The BBC's answer to the show, Auntie's Bloomers and its spin-off, Auntie's Sporting Bloomers, ran until 2001. It was replaced by Outtake TV, which began as a series of one-off specials in 2002, hosted by Paul O'Grady, before a series was commissioned for BBC One in 2004, hosted by Anne Robinson. Special Weakest Link themed editions were common during Robinson's tenure, which lasted until 2009. Rufus Hound took over in 2010. Outtake TV now appears as occasional one-off specials, much in the same way as It'll Be Alright on the Night. ITV has produced two other shows, TV Nightmares, and TV's Naughtiest Blunders. Both were presented by Steve Penk, before the latter was changed to show continuous clips with voice-over by Neil Morrissey. Nightmares presented TV personalities relating some of their most hair-raising moments, and Naughtiest Blunders presented more risqu√© mistakes. The latter has also been criticised for being used as a simple schedule filler, often with ridiculously titled editions (e.g. All New TV's Naughtiest Blunders 18). During the 1982‚Äì83 season, TV producer Dick Clark revived the bloopers concept in America for a series of specials on NBC called TV's Censored Bloopers. This led to a weekly series which ran from 1984 through 1992 (co-hosted by Clark and Ed McMahon) and was followed by more specials that appeared on ABC irregularly until 2004, still hosted by Clark. These specials and a record album of radio bloopers produced by Clark in the mid-1980s were dedicated to the memory of Kermit Schaefer. After Clark suffered a stroke, the blooper shows went on hiatus until 2007, when John O'Hurley hosted a special for ABC that was packaged by Dick Clark Productions. The success of both Clark's and Norden's efforts led to imitators on virtually all American and Australian TV networks, as well as scores of home video releases; many American productions are aired to fill gaps in prime time schedules. The ABC Network aired Foul-Ups, Bleeps & Blunders hosted by Steve Lawrence and Don Rickles in direct competition with the Clark TV series. With the coming of DVD in the 1990s, it became common for major film releases to include a \\"blooper reel\\" (also known as a \\"gag reel\\" or simply \\"outtakes\\") as bonus material on the disc. In 1985, Steve Rotfeld began compiling stock footage of various sports-related errors and mistakes and compiled them into a program known as Bob Uecker's Wacky World of Sports. In the early 1990s, that series eventually evolved into The Lighter Side of Sports and continued in limited production through the early 2000s. NFL Films, the official production arm of the National Football League, has produced a line of blooper reels known as the Football Follies for both television and direct-to-video consumption since 1968. Causes Bloopers are usually accidental and humorous. Where actors need to memorize large numbers of lines or perform a series of actions in quick succession, mistakes can be expected. Similarly, newsreaders have only a short time to deliver a large amount of information and are prone to mispronounce place names and people's names, or switch a name or word without realizing it, as in a slip-of-the-tongue or Freudian slip. Some common examples include: *Uncontrollable laughter (called, in television and acting circles, corpsing); *Unanticipated incidents (e.g. a prop falling or breaking, or a child/animal failing to behave as expected); *Forgotten lines; *Deliberate sabotage of an actor's performance by a fellow actor; a prank or practical joke (to evoke laughter from cast and crew). The famous old chestnut of show business \\"Never work with children or animals\\" demonstrates two other causes of out-takes: Children, especially those who have no acting experience, often miss cues, deliver the wrong lines or make comments which are particularly embarrassing. (The \\"Kids Say the Darndest Things\\" series, conceived by Art Linkletter, deliberately sought these kinds of remarks.) Similarly, animals are very likely to do things not in the script, generally involving bodily functions. A third type of blooper is caused by failure of inanimate objects. This can be as simple as a sound effect being mistimed or a microphone not working properly, but frequently involves doorknobs (and doors) not working or breaking, props and sets being improperly prepared, as well as props working in ways they should not work. In recent years, mobile phones have been a new source of bloopers with them frequently going off. Many of them belong to actors, presenters, and contestants who may have forgotten to turn them off or put them in silent mode. The effect is especially pronounced when the film setting is before the modern era (e.g., ancient Greece or Rome). However, this blooper is rarely seen in recent films (most productions enforce 'no cellphone' rules while on- set to prevent plot or production details from leaking) but commonly used in fake bloopers for animations. The reaction to bloopers is often intensified in the stressful environment of a movie or television set, with some actors expressing extreme annoyance while others enjoy the stress relief brought on by the unexpected event. Examples One of the earliest known bloopers that existed long before movies and TV, is attributed to 1930s radio broadcaster Harry Von Zell, who accidentally referred to then-US President Herbert Hoover as \\"Hoobert Heever\\" during an introduction. Reportedly it was upon hearing of this mistake that Kermit Schafer was inspired to begin collecting bloopers, although the exact circumstances of the event have been debated. A similar situation occurred decades later when then-new president Gerald Ford was introduced as \\"Gerald Smith\\", the same name as an American Fascist leader from the 1930s. On an episode of The Red Skelton Show in the 1950s, a skit involving Red's \\"country bumpkin\\" character \\"Clem Kadiddlehopper\\", had him leading a cow onto the stage. Several seconds into the skit, the cow defecated on-stage during the live broadcast. Whereupon the audience laughed uncontrollably, and Skelton resorted to the use of the ad-lib, saying \\"Boy, she's a great cow! Not only does she give milk, {pause} she gives Pet-Ritz Pies!\\" He followed up with, \\"Why didn't you think of that earlier?\\", \\"You have bad breath too!\\" and finally, \\"Well, it's like in psychiatry... {long pause} Get it out of your system!\\" Red then finally broke into laughter, and the network cut to a commercial. A much-bootlegged recording of Bing Crosby has him singing to a recording of a band playing \\"Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams\\", when he realizes that the master tape had not been fully rewound, and ad- libbed vocals to the truncated music. He begins, \\"Castles may tumble, that's fate after all/ Life's really funny that way.\\" Realizing the shortened music, he ad-libs, \\"Sang the wrong melody, we'll play it back/ See what it sounds like, hey hey/ They cut out eight bars, the dirty bastards/ And I didn't know which eight bars he was gonna cut/ Why don't somebody tell me these things around here/ Holy Christ, I'm going off my nut\\". This recording was first made available to the public by Kermit Schaefer in Volume 1 of his Pardon My Blooper album series for Jubilee Records in the late 1950s. On the Wild Bill Hickok radio series in the early 1950s, a newsflash caused an unexpected blooper when it broke into the show. With sound effects providing the sound of horses' hoofs galloping and guns firing, Guy Madison spoke the line \\"Cut him off at the pass, Jingles!\\" Whereupon an announcer interrupted with, \\"We interrupt this program to bring you a bulletin from the Mutual newsroom in New York! According to an announcement from Moscow radio, Lavrenti Beria, former head of the Soviet secret police, has just been executed! We now return you to Wild Bill Hickok.\\" At this point, Andy Devine (as Jingles) was delivering the line \\"Well, that oughta hold him for a little while, Bill!\\" In a similar vein, New York children's radio show host \\"Uncle Don\\" Carney supposedly delivered the ad-libbed line \\"Are we off? Good...well, that oughta hold the little bastards\\" after signing off on his show one night, thinking his studio microphone was switched off. As a discredited urban legend has it, the remarks went to air, eventually leading to the show's cancellation and \\"Uncle Don\\"'s disgrace; apparently, Carney himself would tell the story of his blooper, especially once it became popular after the release of Schaefer's records. However, according to the debunking website Snopes.com, not only did the alleged incident never happen, the much distributed recording of the incident was a fabrication. (The alleged incident was even parodied in the 1993 Simpsons episode \\"Krusty Gets Kancelled\\".) An episode of the radio drama Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons was presumably introduced as \\"Mr. Keen, Loser of Traced Persons.\\" (Bob and Ray once did their own parody of this program under the title \\"Mr. Trace, Keener Than Most Persons\\".) A popular story among Texas broadcasting circles has it that a station manager's late change in programming from Les Brown's orchestra to a religious programme marking the somber Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur led to the staff announcer's billboard urging his listeners to \\"Stay tuned for the dance music of Yom Kippur's Orchestra.\\" (Many gentile DJs have urged their Jewish listeners to \\"Have a happy Yom Kippur!\\") A radio commercial for A&P; food stores ended with the announcer excitedly blurting out \\"...and be sure to visit your nearby A & Food P Store!\\" In much the same vein was an ad for instant tea as came out in the end \\"Instant White Rose, hot or cold ‚Äì Orange Tekoe Pee\\" and a bakery advertising itself as having \\"the breast bed and rolls you ever tasted; I knew that would happen one night, friends,\\" all the while breaking out in fits of uncontrollable laughter trying to get the line right. During the Davy Crockett mania of the mid-1950s, a radio ad for children's bedding cashing in on same had the line \\"...with scenes of Davy Crockett in action on the mattress,\\" a clear example of how unintentional double-entendre can translate into blooper material. Afrikaans news anchor Riaan Cruywagen made several live-bloopers during his long career, most notably: where the normally very composed and highly professional Cruywagen burst into uncontrollable laughter while covering story about a record-breaking frog; as well as when co-anchor Mar√Øetta Kruger asked what the word \\"dysentery\\" meant while covering a story related to the topic, to which he responded with \\"spuitpoep\\" (it translated as \\"spray poo\\"), which resulted in Kruger going into a fit of uncontrollable laughter. A public service announcement urging young women to volunteer as nurses during a critical shortage thereof ended with the appeal \\"Volunteer to be one of America's white-clapped angels of mercy,\\" confusing a slang term for infection with gonorrhea with \\"white-clad.\\" The announcer of a radio ad for the 1948 Bob Hope film The Paleface, which costarred buxom actress Jane Russell, enthusiastically promised: \\"Bob Hope, America's favorite comedian, and Jane Russell...what a pair!\\" A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio announcer's station-identification message once allegedly came out \\"This is the Dominion Network of the Canadian Broadcorping Castration,\\" in turn coining an oft-used sarcastic term for the public broadcaster. Like other blooper recordings distributed by Schaefer, a recreation was created as the original recording was not preserved, leading to debate over whether the event actually happened. A radio adaptation of Don Quixote over the BBC had one episode ending with the announcer explaining where \\"I'm afraid we've run out of time, so here we leave Don Quixote, sitting on his ass until tomorrow at the same time.\\" In US English, ass could refer either to the buttocks or to a jackass. However, this would not have been seen as a blooper in the UK in the period when it was transmitted, since the British slang word for buttocks is arse, pronounced quite differently. It is only since it has become permissible for ass in the sense of buttocks to be used in US films and on television, and syndicated to the UK, that most Brits have become aware of the buttocks usage. Indeed, since the King James Bible translation is now rarely used, and since the word jackass is very rare in the UK, much of British youth is now unaware that ass can mean donkey. As with the word gay, its usage has completely changed within a few years. The announcer was merely making a joke of the character being frozen in place for 24 hours waiting for us, rather like Elwood in the opening minutes of Blues Brothers 2000, or like toys put back in the cupboard in several children's films. =Contemporary examples= The American sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air had a tradition of airing outtakes over the closing credits, though blooper reels were not shown during the closing credits of the show during the first, fifth (except for one episode) and sixth seasons. Many of these involved malapropisms on the part of the cast, often lampooned by Will Smith, who would chime in on the mistakes made by the rest of the cast. An example of this is when Uncle Phil (James L. Avery Sr.) comments, \\"Well, the silverware's obviously not in the house. It must been stolen\\", before realizing the line was \\"It must have been stolen\\" and correcting himself. Smith appears in the shot and, in an exaggerated accent, responds, \\"It must been stolen. Feet, don't fail me now!\\" Another sitcom, Home Improvement, also showcased outtakes over its closing credits; however, some episodes featured a tag scene over the credits in lieu of a blooper reel. Star Trek produced many famous out-takes, which were shown to the delight of fans at gatherings over the years and have been extensively bootlegged. One famous example shows actor Leonard Nimoy, who plays the supposedly emotionless Mr. Spock, breaking into laughter when, in the first-season episode \\"This Side of Paradise\\", instead of saying the line \\"The plants act as a repository\\", says \\"The plants act as a suppository\\". In another out-take, series star William Shatner breaks character during a scene and starts complaining about the food served in the studio commissary. A third example begins with the third-season episode \\"Is There in Truth No Beauty?\\", in which guest actress Diana Muldaur recited the line, \\"We've come to the end of an eventful... trip\\", to which Shatner replies, \\"I don't know what you've been taking...\\" ‚Äì a reference to the then-topical issue of drug-induced hallucinations or \\"trips\\". People bumping into supposedly automatic doors when the backstage personnel mistimed opening them was a common accident depicted. Similarly there were also mishaps while filming in exterior, with aircraft flying over supposedly alien planets. Hee Haw often showed bloopers in the show itself, usually with the actor or actors requiring several tries to get a line right, ending in most cases with the correctly delivered line. Many theatrical motion pictures feature bloopers during the end credits. For example, many Jackie Chan movies end with footage of failed stunts, blown dialogue, and other mishaps; Chan was inspired to do this by Burt Reynolds' films of the early 1980s (in particular Smokey and the Bandit II and The Cannonball Run) that also featured end-credits bloopers. As an homage to its inspiration, the closing-credits blooper reel for Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy actually featured one outtake from Smokey and the Bandit II. Pixar also has a tradition of including blooper-like material during the end credits of such films as A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2 and Monsters, Inc.; the latter was at one point reissued to theatres with a major selling feature being the addition of extra \\"bloopers\\". Since Pixar's films are painstakingly computer-animated, making actual blunders of this sort is impossible, these scenes are in fact staged to provide additional audience enjoyment. The makers of another computer-animated film, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, likewise also created a faux blooper reel showing the characters playing practical jokes and, in one case, bursting into laughter when one \\"sneezes\\" during a dramatic sequence. However, the movie Shrek has actual bloopers that were released on DVD. These bloopers are technical errors within the system, causing blurred characters or the characters bodies going through objects, such as a bush or the crown Lord Farquaad wears. Going back decades earlier, in 1939 Warner Bros. cartoon director Bob Clampett produced a short \\"blooper\\" film (for the studio's annual in-house gag reel) of Looney Tunes character Porky Pig smashing his thumb with a hammer and cursing. The television show, Full House, had various bloopers in television specials but unreleased bloopers were leaked containing cast members using profanity to express their mistakes in a family-friendly program. The fishing television series Bill Dance Outdoors has produced four videos (two VHS and two DVD) focusing entirely on bloopers occurring during production of the show and associated commercials, often showing various mishaps such as missed lines (which sometimes take several takes to finally deliver correctly), accidents during filming (including falling into the water, being impaled with a fish hook, or equipment malfunctions), as well as practical jokes played on the host by his guests and film crew (and vice versa). Some of the outtakes shown on these videos would sometimes be shown over the end credits. The Discovery Channel series MythBusters will often keep some bloopers included in the actual episodes, usually various mishaps that occur on the show, such as minor injuries suffered by the cast, or various other accidents and malfunctions, which are usually quite spectacular and/or embarrassing when they do occur. In Asia, variety shows, which is broadcast in a live-like format, would sometimes air bloopers titled NG's, which stands for no good/not good. These NG's would usually feature hosts forgetting their words by mistake and admit they make mistakes on occasion. The Disney Channel Original Series Sonny with a Chance season 1 episode \\"Sonny So Far\\" included bloopers where actress Demi Lovato had uncontrollable laughter while suffering from hiccups during a supposedly \\"serious\\" scene, and several other scenes where the cast-members either humorously messed-up their lines, or props where forgotten. A recent example of a well-publicized live blooper occurred during the March 2, 2014 telecast of the 86th Academy Awards. In introducing the singer Idina Menzel's performance of one of the Best Song nominees, actor John Travolta accidentally announced her as \\"Adele Dazeem\\". Acceptance of out-takes The proliferation of out-takes/gag reels/blooper reels, especially on recent DVD releases, has received mixed response by actors and directors. While many do not mind the extra publicity offered by such material being shown to the public and others simply enjoy seeing the mistakes, other actors complain that out-takes are demeaning to themselves and/or the craft and refuse to allow them to be made public. Director Hal Ashby's decision to include a blooper reel of star Peter Sellers in his 1979 film Being There, for example, is sometimes blamed for Sellers' failure to win that year's Academy Award for Best Actor (for which he was nominated). Sellers had reportedly urged Ashby not to include the outtakes in the final edit of the film, to no avail. Among his other issues with Star Treks producer Gene Roddenberry, Leonard Nimoy was not happy that Roddenberry showed the show's blooper reels to fans at conventions in the early 1970s. He felt actors needed to be free to make mistakes without expecting that they would be shown to the public, and wrote a letter to Roddenberry asking him to stop. Roddenberry's answer was to send Nimoy a blooper reel of his own should he have wished to show it at conventions. Conversely, actors and crew on many productions treat the creation of gag reels as part of the filmmaking process, with innumerable examples of commercially released outtakes in which an actor can be heard remarking that a failed take was likely destined for a gag or blooper reel. Film producer Sam Raimi went so far as to commission veteran composer Vic Mizzy to create unique scores for the gag/blooper reel special features for the DVD releases of the films Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3. Alternative definitions The term \\"blooper\\" or \\"flub,\\" is often applied to describe continuity errors and other mistakes that have escaped the notice of film editors and directors and have made it into a final, televised or released product, where these errors are subsequently identified by viewers. For example, in a film taking place in the Old West, a viewer might spot a twentieth century vehicle driving in the distance of one shot, or in a film taking place in ancient Greece, an actor may have forgotten to remove his wristwatch and it was caught on film. Or it might be a piece of clothing, such as shoes, that change for one shot then change back with no explanation. Strictly speaking, however, these are film errors, and not \\"bloopers\\" since they did not occur in outtake footage or a live broadcast. The Internet Movie Database website uses the term goofs instead. In the mid-1990s, author Phil Farrand published a series of Nit-Picker's Guides books in which he collected continuity errors and other on-screen \\"bloopers\\" from various Star Trek series that had been identified by either himself or fans; the listing of such information is commonplace on wiki-style websites devoted to TV and film production. In baseball, the term is used to describe a Texas leaguer, or a short fly ball that lands just past the infield, eluding both infielders and outfielders alike. The Vietnam-era M79 grenade launcher also has the nickname \\"Blooper\\" due to its distinctive firing noise. Gustav Hasford refers to this in his novel, The Phantom Blooper: A Novel of Vietnam (1990).

Its capital is Tagum. The province also includes Samal Island to the south in the Davao Gulf. Before 1967, the five provinces--Davao de Oro, Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur, Davao Occidental, and Davao Oriental-- were administered as a single province named Davao. The present-day Davao Region is coterminous with this former province. Davao del Norte is also known as \\"The Banana Capital of the Philippines.\\" History Davao del Norte and Davao de Oro, together with Davao Oriental, Davao Occidental and Davao del Sur used to be a whole province simply known as Davao. This original province was split into three: Davao del Norte, Davao Oriental, and Davao del Sur when Republic Act No. 4867 (authored by Representative Lorenzo S. Sarmiento, Sr.) was signed into law on May 8, 1967 by President Ferdinand Marcos. Davao del Norte originally comprised thirteen municipalities: Asuncion, Babak (now in Samal), Compostela, Kapalong, Mabini, Mawab, Monkayo, Nabunturan, Panabo, Pantukan, Samal, Santo Tomas and Tagum. On May 6, 1970, six more municipalities were created: Carmen, Kaputian (now in Samal), Maco, Montevista, New Bataan, and New Corella. The passage of Republic Act No. 6430 on June 17, 1972 changed the name of the province from Davao del Norte to Davao. By 1996, Davao had a total of twenty-two municipalities with the creation of San Vicente (now Laak) in 1979, Maragusan in 1988, and Talaingod in 1991. On January 31, 1998, President Fidel V. Ramos signed Republic Act No. 8470, which split the province into two, creating the province of Davao de Oro (Compostela Valley). In the meantime, Davao was renamed back to Davao del Norte. Together with the creation of the new province, two cities and one municipality were created: the municipality of Tagum, capital of Davao del Norte, was converted into a city (R.A. 8472); Samal, Babak, and Kaputian were joined into the city of Samal (R.A. 8471); and the municipality of Braulio E. Dujali was created out of several barangays in Panabo and Carmen (R.A. 8473). The province then had 8 municipalities and 2 cities. Republic Act No. 9015, signed into law on March 5, 2001 by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, converted the municipality of Panabo into a city. Republic Act No. 9265, approved on March 15, 2004 created the municipality of San Isidro from Asuncion and Kapalong. Geography Davao del Norte covers a total area of occupying the north-central section of the Davao Region. The province borders Agusan del Sur to the north, Bukidnon to the west, Davao de Oro to the east, and Davao City to the south. Samal is the only municipality or city in the province not situated on Mindanao island. The city covers the entire Samal and Talikud Islands within the Davao Gulf. =Administrative divisions= Davao del Norte comprises eight municipalities and three cities. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background- color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border-collapse:collapse;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" colspan=2  City municipality ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  District ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" colspan=3  Population ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" colspan=2  Area ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" colspan=2  Density ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Coordinates - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-top:none;\\" colspan=2  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-top:none;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-style:hidden hidden solid solid;\\" colspan=2  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-style:hidden solid solid hidden;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-top:none;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-style:hidden hidden solid solid;\\"  km2 ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-style:hidden solid solid hidden;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-style:hidden hidden solid solid;\\"  /km2 ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-style:hidden solid solid hidden;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-top:none;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-top:none;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:left;background-color:#FDFDFD;\\" colspan=2  Asuncion  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  1st   55,844     style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  20  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:left;background-color:#FDFDFD;\\" colspan=2  Braulio E.

Economy Davao del Norte is a primarily agricultural, but also engages in mining, forestry, and commercial fishing. The principal crops of the province include rice, maize, banana, coconut, abac√°, ramie, coffee, and a variety of fruit and root crops. Davao del Norte is the country's leading producer of bananas, with many plantations run by multinationals Dole and Del Monte, and local producers such as Lapanday, TADECO, and Marsman. Davao del Norte is also one of Mindanao's leading producer of rice. Davao Gulf, to the south of the province, provides a living for many fishermen. Some of the fish products include brackish water milkfish, tilapia, shrimp, and crab; and freshwater catfish and tilapia. Davao del Norte is a major producer of gold, and its mining resources include silica, silver, copper and elemental sulfur. Small- scale gold mining activities thrive in several areas. There are also numerous active quarries of commercial quantities of gravel, sand, and pebbles for construction. Tourism is also a major part of the economy of Davao del Norte. There are a lot of beaches on Samal Island, the most famous of which is Pearl Farm Beach Resort. Banana Beach Resort is the most famous beach outside of Samal Island. Commerce is also a major part of the economy of Davao del Norte. There are lot of shopping malls in Tagum.

The Copernican System on the near side of the moon The Copernican System on the far side of the moon Copernican age deposits are mostly represented by crater ejecta, but a small area of mare basalt has covered part of (and is thus younger than) some of the rays of the Copernican crater Lichtenberg, and therefore the basalt is mapped as Copernican age. Definition The base of the Copernican period is defined based on the recognition that freshly excavated materials on the lunar surface are generally \\"bright\\" and that they become darker over time as a result of space weathering processes. Operationally, this period was originally defined as the time at which impact craters \\"lost\\" their bright ray systems. This definition, however, has recently been subjected to some criticism as some crater rays are bright for compositional reasons that are unrelated to the amount of space weathering they have incurred. In particular, if the ejecta from a crater formed in the highlands (which is composed of bright anorthositic materials) is deposited on the low albedo mare, it will remain bright even after being space weathered.

Headquartered in Brampton, Ontario, Loblaws is a subsidiary of Loblaw Companies Limited, Canada's largest food distributor. History Loblaws at Empress Walk, Toronto, Ontario, 2007 Loblaws at Yonge and Bernard, Richmond Hill, Ontario Loblaws was founded by Theodore Loblaw and John Milton Cork in 1919. In 1947, Garfield Weston struck a deal to acquire a block of 100,000 shares of Loblaw Groceterias Co. Limited, one of the country's leading supermarket chains By 1953, George Weston Limited had established majority control. Loblaws stores used to operate across Canada until the early 1960s when most locations in western Canada were rebranded as SuperValu, and later as Real Canadian Superstore. The company also once operated stores in upstate New York, Northwest Pennsylvania and Northeast Ohio. These were sold to Bells Markets in the mid-1970s. Some of the Loblaws stores in northwestern Pennsylvania continued operation into the early 1990s. What is likely the final empty Loblaws building in New York, in Johnstown/Gloversville, was demolished in 2015, having been standing empty since the chain's departure in the 1970s, even with the name still on the sign, showing no reuse of the site. Retail sales and earnings were in decline in the 1970s as Loblaws' aging chain of supermarkets looked increasingly uncompetitive. The company also initiated a broad marketing strategy that saw a prototype store renovated and remodelled in new colours and a new Loblaws logo. Actor William Shatner did a number of television commercials for Loblaws in the 1970s, and finished the ad spots by saying originally \\"Come on over to Loblaws\\" and \\"At Loblaws, more than the price is right; but, by gosh the price is right!\\", later shortened to \\"At Loblaws, more than the price is right.\\" In 1996, in addition to revitalizing the look of its stores, Loblaw management earmarked $40 million for the development of its in-house, private label program. Beginning in 2008, some new and renovated Loblaws stores were given a new store format and were named \\"Loblaw Great Food\\", dropping the red-orange curved-L logo. Stores under this banner are also subject to slightly different collective-agreement terms with the United Food and Commercial Workers, the union representing Loblaw employees. The chain's location on the site of the former Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, opened in late 2011, is promoted as simply Loblaws and uses the familiar \\"L\\" logo, but is officially named \\"Loblaws Great Food\\", indicating that similar terms are in place at that store. On July 19, 2013, Loblaws introduced their new concept \\"Loblaws CityMarket\\" in British Columbia (in North Vancouver, Richmond and Vancouver). Loblaws CityMarkets are now operational in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta. On July 23, 2015, Loblaws announced the planned closure of 52 non- profitable stores over the following year. In January 2018, Loblaws was implicated in price-fixing the cost of bread in Canada, taking part from 2001 until 2015.https://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/14-years-of- loblaws-bread-price-fixing-may-have-cost-you-at-least-400/ The company admitted its involvement in the scheme. In response to the price-fixing, in January 2018, all consumers were offered the chance to receive a $25 gift card for bread. Previously, the company had estimated between 3 and 5 million Canadians would sign up.https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/loblaws-gift- card-1.4477357 There was some criticism for the Loblaws policy of requiring an ID for the gift cards,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/after-overcharging-for- bread-should-loblaws-demand-id-for-a-25-gift-card-1.4577502 which was investigated by the privacy commissioner of Canadahttps://www.cbc.ca/news/business/privacy-commissioner-loblaws-gift-card- investigation-1.4574960 and resulted in protests.https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/loblaws-25-gift-card-personal- information-1.4569422 Also in 2018, Loblaws was ordered to pay back taxes of $368 million in relation to a banking subsidiary in the Caribbean.

(2014). Horns, Strings, and Harmony, p.83. Courier, Dover Books on Music. . , , , , or A combination tone (also called resultant or subjective tone)\\"Combination Tone\\", Britannica.com. Accessed September 2015. is a psychoacoustic phenomenon of an additional tone or tones that are artificially perceived when two real tones are sounded at the same time. Their discovery is credited to the violinist Giuseppe Tartini (although he was not the first, see Georg Andreas Sorge) and so they are also called Tartini tones. There are two types of combination tones: sum tones whose frequencies are found by adding the frequencies of the real tones, and difference tones whose frequencies are the difference between the frequencies of the real tones. \\"Combination tones are heard when two pure tones (i.e., tones produced by simple harmonic sound waves having no overtones), differing in frequency by about 50 cycles per second [Hertz] or more, sound together at sufficient intensity.\\" Combination tones can also be produced electronically by combining two signals in a circuit that has nonlinear distortion, such as an amplifier subject to clipping or a ring modulator. Explanation One way a difference tone can be heard is when two tones with fairly complete sets of harmonics make a just fifth. This can be explained as an example of the missing fundamental phenomenon.Beament, James (2001). How We Hear Music, p.81-2. The Boydell Press. . If f is the missing fundamental frequency, then 2f would be the frequency of the lower tone, and its harmonics would be 4f, 6f, 8f, etc. Since a fifth corresponds to a frequency ratio of 2:3, the higher tone and its harmonics would then be 3f, 6f, 9f, etc. When both tones are sounded, there are components with frequencies of 2f, 3f, 4f, 6f, 8f, 9f, etc. The missing fundamental is heard because so many of these components refer to it. The specific phenomenon that Tartini discovered was physical. Sum and difference tones are thought to be caused sometimes by the non-linearity of the inner ear. This causes intermodulation distortion of the various frequencies which enter the ear. They are combined linearly, generating relatively faint components with frequencies equal to the sums and differences of whole multiples of the original frequencies. Any components which are heard are usually lower, with the most commonly heard frequency being just the difference tone, f_2-f_1, though this may be a consequence of the other phenomena. Although much less common, the following frequencies may also be heard: :2f_1 - f_2, 3f_1 - 2f_2, \\\\ldots, f_1 - k(f_2 - f_1) For a time it was thought that the inner ear was solely responsible whenever a sum or difference tone was heard. However, experiments show evidence that even when using headphones providing a single pure tone to each ear separately, listeners may still hear a difference tone. Since the peculiar, non-linear physics of the ear doesn't come into play in this case, it is thought that this must be a separate, neural phenomenon. Compare binaural beats. Heinz Bohlen proposed what is now known as the Bohlen‚ÄìPierce scale on the basis of combination tones,Max V. Mathews and John R. Pierce (1989). \\"The Bohlen‚ÄìPierce Scale\\", p.167. Current Directions in Computer Music Research, Max V. Mathews and John R. Pierce, eds. MIT Press. as well as the 833 cents scale. Resultant tone A resultant tone is \\"produced when any two loud and sustained musical sounds are heard at the same time.\\"Maitland, J. A. Fuller; ed. (1909). Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Volume 4, p.76. Macmillan. . In pipe organs, this is done by having two pipes, one pipe of the note being played, and another harmonically related, typically at its fifth, being sounded at the same time. The result is a pitch at a common subharmonic of the pitches played (one octave below the first pitch when the second is the fifth, 3:2, two octaves below when the second is the major third, 5:4). This effect is useful especially in the lowest ranks of the pipe organ where cost or space could prohibit having a rank of such low pitch. For example, a 32' pipe would be costly and take up as much as 16' of vertical space (if capped) or more commonly 17-32' (if open-ended) for each pipe. Using a resultant tone for such low pitches reduces the cost and space factor, but does not sound as full as a true 32' pipe. The effect can be enhanced by using further ranks in the harmonic series of the desired resultant tone. This effect is most often used in the lowest octave of the organ only.

Founded in Ottawa, Ontario, Loeb expanded across Canada, and into parts of the United States. The company was acquired by the Quebec-based supermarket chain Metro in 1999, and its stores were converted to the Metro brand in 2008. History Loeb began in 1912 when Moses Loeb opened a small wholesale confectionery house in Ottawa. By 1950, Loeb grew into two large warehouses, and the following two decades were those of lucrative business ventures. Through partnerships with other companies into the 1980s, Loeb continued to serve the needs of people throughout Canada and the United States. In 1990, Loeb launched its own brand of private label products, called 'Loeb Made Today', followed by 'Loeb Ready' products. =Acquisition by Metro= In June 1999, Loeb became part of the Metro Foods corporate group. At the time, it was owned by Provigo, which was sold the previous year to Loblaw Companies, who was required to resell Loeb for competitive reasons. Following the purchase, Metro began putting products from its own house brands, Merit/Selection and Irresistibles, on the shelves of Loeb stores. In 2006, following Metro's acquisition of The Great Atlantic & Pacific Company of Canada, Loeb became a subsidiary of A&P; Canada. New products and services were introduced to Loeb stores, and the Merit, Econochoix, and Irresistible lines were dropped in favour of A&P; Canada‚Äôs own Master Choice, Equality and Baker‚Äôs Oven products, along with Fresh Obsessions produce. On August 7, 2008, Metro announced it would invest $200 million consolidating the company's conventional food stores under the Metro banner. Over a period of 15 months, all Loeb stores were converted to the Metro name. The rebranding also saw the Irresistibles and Selection brands return to the stores, replacing those inherited from A&P.;CBC News, \\"Metro to dump A&P;, Dominion names\\", 7 August 2008 =Advertising slogans= *1998‚Äì2002: Real Values (Get Real...

The group has released 22 studio albums, several EPs and compilations, and over 40 singles. Outside Japan, they are best known as the group responsible for the soundtrack to the FLCL OVA series. History =Formation and early years (1989‚Äì1994)= In 1989 Kenji Ueda, bassist for Kenzi & The Trips, left the band with former Kenzi's drummer Shinichiro Sato and invited The Coin Locker Babies vocalist Sawao Yamanaka to form a new band. Since Yamanaka was not able to play the guitar well yet, Yoshiaki Manabe, the guitarist of the hair metal band Persia, joined them. The Pillows were formed on September 16, 1989. The story as to where the band's name came about is that allegedly Sawao Yamanaka was hanging out at Yoshiaki Manabe's place and an English post-punk compilation record entitled Pillows & Prayers hanging on Manabe's wall inspired him. Ueda and Yamanaka were the main songwriters and The Pillows released their first EPs, Pantomime and 90's My Life in 1990 under Captain Records. In 1991 they contracted with major label Pony Canyon and released their debut single, \\"Ame ni Utaeba\\" in May and their first full-length record Moon Gold in June. In 1992 The Pillows visited England to record their second full-length album, White Incarnation, and filmed the promotional video for their second single, \\"Kanojo wa Shisuta\\". Shortly after the release of White Incarnation, Ueda left The Pillows due to disagreements with other members and musical differences. After a year with no activity or leadership, Sawao Yamanaka took over Ueda's leadership role and recruited Tatsuya Kashima as a replacement on bass, restarting the band. Out of respect for Ueda, Kashima was labeled as a guest musician on releases on which he performed and Ueda's bassist post has never been officially replaced. The extremely rare The Pillows Presents Special CD, released only to The Pillows fanclub, contained their first recordings with Kashima. In 1994 The Pillows changed to King Records and the band wildly experimented between varying genres. In July The Pillows released their first album as a trio, Kool Spice, and one month later the single \\"Daydream Wonder\\" was released. =Breakthrough and FLCL (1995‚Äì2000)= Yamanaka performing in Seattle during the Delicious Bump Tour, 2008. In March 1995 The Pillows released their fourth album, Living Field. Their subsequent single, \\"Girlfriend\\", was used in the romance movie Love Letter. In the following year, after the release of their fifth single \\"Tiny Boat\\", The Pillows would release a series of singles such as \\"Strange Chameleon\\", \\"Swanky Street\\", and \\"Trip Dancer\\" that were featured on their breakthrough and acclaimed album Please Mr. Lostman. In March of the same year, due to the success of Please Mr. Lostman The Pillows released one of the album's tracks, \\"Kanojo wa Kyou\\" as a single. Later that year, two new singles were released, \\"One Life\\" in June and \\"Hybrid Rainbow\\" in November, which became one of The Pillows' most recognizable songs, being largely featured on concert set lists. In January 1998, The Pillows released their twelfth single \\"Another Morning\\" and their first concert DVD \\"Hello, Welcome to Bubbletown's Happy Zoo\\". The last three singles were featured on their sixth album Little Busters, which came out in February and became one of their most well known and commercial records. Two more singles followed, \\"Instant Music\\" and \\"No Self Control\\" would both be used on their 1999 album Runners High. The year of 1999 started with the release of Runners High and to celebrate their 10th anniversary, The Pillows released their first video clips compilation DVD, \\"We Have a Theme Song\\", followed by two new singles (\\"Carnival\\" and \\"Rush\\"), both featured on the second studio album release of that year, Happy Bivouac. This record pays tribute to the Pixies in songs such as \\"Back Seat Dog\\" and \\"Kim Deal\\" and it is the first album to feature support bassist Jun Suzuki as a replacement for Kashima. In the same year, The Pillows were approached by the anime studio Gainax, which licensed The Pillows' three previous albums for the soundtrack of the original video animation FLCL. The Pillows also composed two new songs for the show, \\"Ride on Shooting Star\\" and \\"I Think I Can\\", which were later included on their greatest hits compilation album Fool on the Planet. Due to their participation in FLCL's soundtrack, The Pillows enjoyed a popularity increase, making their western fan base grow. This allowed them to release their \\"Ride on Shooting Star\\" single in the United States in 2000 and later tour that country. =Early 2000s, 15th anniversary and US debut (2001‚Äì2006)= The Pillows performing at Shibuya Club Quattro in 2003. After their participation on FLCL's soundtrack, The Pillows released their first greatest-hits compilation album Fool on the Planet in 2001 and also a live DVD called Busters on the Planet and a new album, Smile. In 2002, the FLCL anime became available in the United States, giving the band more notoriety outside of their native country. In October of the same year Thank You, My Twilight, The Pillows' tenth studio album, was released alongside a double-CD collection of B-sides entitled Another Morning, Another Pillows, following the promotional single \\"White Summer and Green Bicycle, Red Hair with Black Guitar\\". In 2003, The Pillows released their second video clips DVD Dead Stock Paradise, one single, \\"Terminal Heaven's Rock\\" and one more studio album, Penalty Life, which was later released in the US by Geneon in 2005. To commemorate the band's 15th anniversary, The Pillows re-released their 90's My Life EP with additional tracks and released a string of new material, including a new EP with re-recorded tracks previously published between 1990 and 1996, Turn Back, one document DVD, Walkin' on The Spiral, one new studio album, Good Dreams, a new single, \\"Sono Mirai wa Ima\\" and finally a tribute album, Synchronized Rockers, including covers of The Pillows played by artists such as Mr. Children, Straightener and Noodles.

In September, the band released a live DVD entitled Delicious Bump Tour in USA, featuring footage of their first tour in America with fellow band Noodles and also a new single, \\"Non Fiction\\". In November they released their second single of the year,\\"The Third Eye\\". Both singles were used on their subsequent 2006 album, My Foot. In February 2006 to help promote the My Foot tour, one track of the album, \\"Gazelle City\\" was released as the album's third single. The album was released in the United States in July 2006 by Geneon, with a growing international fan-base and growing domestic sales of their albums and singles over the past four years. In June, The Pillows returned to North America during their tour in support of the album My Foot, with several more dates in the U.S. and a show in Mexico City. =Move to Avex Trax, 20th and 25th anniversaries (2007‚Äì2014)= In 2007, The Pillows released their 25th single, \\"Scarecrow\\" which was used in the anime series Moonlight Mile, being included on their next album, Wake Up! Wake Up! Wake Up!. This album marks their first release on the Avex Trax label. In August, the band released one more single, \\"Ladybird Girl\\", which is being used as the theme song for the Japanese version of the children's animated series Ben 10. In November, the band released a five-disc singles collection, Lostman Go to Yesterday, featuring all the band's singles released under the King Records label and 21 music videos on a DVD in the same collection. On the same day they also released their fifth live DVD, Lostman Go to America featuring footage of their 2006 American tour in support for the album My Foot.

Tour of 2007 and a single, \\"Tokyo Bambi\\". On May a new single came out, \\"New Animal\\", and along with their previous two singles, it is featured on their fifteenth studio album, Pied Piper. The band returned to the US starting with Los Angeles, followed by other appearances at SXSW, San Francisco, Seattle, New York City, and Anime Boston, where the band played for a crowd of more than 5,000 people. Still in 2008, legendary English rock band Oasis extended an offer for The Pillows to play as the opening act at their concert in Japan, but frontman Sawao Yamanaka refused their offer. In a January interview for Japanzine, Yamanaka joked that he \\"turned down the offer in order to have a fun story to tell\\". In 2009, in order to celebrate their upcoming 20th anniversary, The Pillows issued a series of releases called \\"Late Bloomer Series\\". It includes two DVDs: Pied Piper Go to Yesterday and Blue Song With Blue Poppies, two best-of compilation albums, Rock Stock & Too Smoking the Pillows and Once Upon a Time in the Pillows, a single \\"Ameagari ni mita Maboroshi\\" (featured on their 16th studio album OOPArts (Out of Place Artifacts)) and later the DVD of their anniversary concert, Lostman Go to Budokan, released in the following year. On September 16, The Pillows gave their first concert in the legendary Nippon Budokan arena commemorating their 20th anniversary. The footage of the concert was later released in 2010 as their ninth live DVD, Lostman Go to Budokan, which came out in both regular and limited edition formats. The limited edition included the concert, a documentary DVD and a special 60-page photo album of the band. In 2010, The Pillows recorded Rodeo Star Mate, their 30th single and opening theme song for the series, Stitch - Itazura Alien no Daibouken.

In October they released a live DVD, Born Again, containing footage of their 2011 Horn Again Tour, and in December they released the single, \\"Energia\\". On January 18, 2012 The Pillows released their album, Trial and, on the same day, a live DVD entitled We Are Friends, which included footage of their 2011 NAP Tour in America with Noodles. In June, following their Trial tour, the band released the DVD Real Trial containing the last live performance of the tour at Zepp Tokyo. In a similar fashion to the \\"Late Bloomer Series\\" celebrating the band's 20th anniversary, The Pillows issued a string of releases over 2013 and 2014 in honor of their 25th anniversary. Entitled \\"Never Ending Story\\", this series of releases comprised a new tribute album, DVDs and Blu-ray's (including a nine disc Blu- ray box set), three new singles (\\"Future\\", \\"Happy Birthday\\" and \\"About a Rock'n'Roll Band\\") and finally, The Pillows' 19th studio album Moondust. The band also performed three shows in 2014 representing each era (\\"movement\\") of their sound: their period with original bassist Kenji Ueda, their experimentation with jazz as heard on the Kool Spice and Living Field albums, and their current style from Please Mr. Lostman onward. These shows saw the band playing old songs for the first time in decades, with Ueda being invited to play bass at a single show where The Pillows performed songs from his time with the band. On October 4, 2014 the band concluded the \\"Never Ending Story\\" campaign with the \\"Don't Forget Today\\" show at Tokyo Dome City Hall and, on the same date, released Bootleg the Pillows 1992-1993, a compilation featuring various previously unreleased recordings. Around this time, The Pillows also began issuing merchandise that featured the slogan \\"4th Movement is coming\\", potentially signalling a new \\"era\\" for the band. =FLCL new seasons and 30th Anniversary (2015‚Äìpresent)= Following the end of the \\"Never Ending Story\\" campaign, The Pillows began the Moondust Light for You tour at the beginning of 2015 in support of the Moondust album. In May 2015, the band announced that longtime bassist Jun Suzuki had been fired from the band due to \\"bad conduct\\" that had been going on for some time. In this announcement, Yamanaka also discussed the possibility of continuing on without a \\"fixed\\" bass player. In place of Suzuki, who went on to form the band SABAH, The Pillows played with various different bassists for their remaining 2015 live shows. These included several appearances with original Pillows member Kenji Ueda and former \\"support member\\" Tatsuya Kashima, as well as Tomoyuki Miyakawa (of HiGE), and Yoshinori Arie (of Vola and the Oriental Machine). By 2016, the band had named Arie as their official replacement for Suzuki. Book-ending The Pillows' Lostman Go to City tour at the end of 2015 were two announcements of upcoming releases: on the day of the tour's first show (December 4), The Pillows revealed a new B-sides compilation entitled Across the Metropolis, which comprises 22 tracks over two CDs, as well as a DVD featuring seven music videos. The set was released on March 2, 2016, about a month before the release of the band's 20th studio album, which was announced on December 26, the final day of the Lostman Go to City tour. Entitled Stroll and Roll, the album includes a new version of \\"Radio Telegraphy\\"‚Äîoriginally recorded as a collaboration with Ryosuke Sasaki of A Flood of Circle‚Äîand \\"One Flew Under the Cuckoo's Nest\\", which the band had included on setlists for the Lostman Go to City tour. The album was released on April 6, and features bass tracks performed by Kenji Ueda, Tatsuya Kashima, Yoshinori Arie, Tomoyuki Miyakawa, and Yamanaka's bandmate in The Predators, Jiro (of Glay). Additionally, The Pillows announced that Stroll and Roll would not be released on Avex Trax, as the band had signed to Yamanaka's Delicious Label with distribution by The Pillows' previous label King Records. The Across the Metropolis compilation was the band's last release with Avex Trax. The Pillows embarked on a 27-date tour in support of Stroll and Roll spanning from May 6 to July 22, with the last show at Zepp Tokyo being recorded for Stroll and Roll Band, a live DVD/Blu-ray released on November 23. On July 3, 2016, it was announced that The Pillows would be providing the soundtrack for the anime FLCL over two new seasons set to air in late 2017 and early 2018, respectively. At the band's final date of the Stroll and Roll tour on July 22 at Zepp Tokyo, Yamanaka announced that he had eight new Pillows songs written at the time, including one that had already been recorded, and the band would be contributing new music to the upcoming FLCL series. Casablanca, a new band featuring Yamanaka alongside Yoko of Noodles and Kusube Shinya of Radio Caroline made their debut at the 13th anniversary show of the Red Cloth venue in Shinjuku on August 29, the same day that their first album entitled Another Story was released. The album was only available for purchase at live shows, via online mail-order, or at the Tower Records Sapporo store. A new Pillows song entitled \\"Be Wild\\" was featured in a commercial for wrestler Eri Tosaka, who won the gold medal in the women's freestyle 48 kg event at the 2016 Summer Olympics (Tosaka herself is a Pillows fan, utilising their song \\"Funny Bunny\\" as her fight song). On November 11, 2016, The Pillows announced the upcoming release of a digital single entitled \\"Be Your King\\". as well as the announcement of a new album entitled Nook in the Brain‚Äîset for release on 8 March 2017‚Äîand a tour in support of the album spanning from 5 May to 22 July 2017. Nook in the Brain features \\"Be Your King\\" and \\"Be Wild\\" as part of its ten-song tracklist. Yamanaka commented that the album would showcase an alternative rock sound different from that of the band's past few albums. With the announcement of FLCL Seasons 2 & 3 in mid 2016 it was expected that The Pillows would return to reprise their role as lead music for the cult anime FLCL. Following the release of FLCL season 2 Adult Swim sponsored and presented a seven city tour across the USA alongside a band on the same label called Noodles, as well as Cullen Omori formerly of the Smith Westerns. On September 5, 2018, Toho released the fourth soundtrack from the anime series FLCL entitled \\"Fool on Cool Generation\\".

It was released on July 24th. In May 2019, it was announced that The pillows‚Äô new song ‚ÄúHappy Go Ducky!‚Äù will be used as the opening theme for the anime series Ahiru no Sora premiering in October. To celebrate the band's 30th anniversary, a feature film entitled Ousama ni Nare (\\"Become the King\\") with music and original story by Sawao Yamanaka was released in Japan in the Fall season of 2019. Sh√ªji Okui is responsible for the script and direction. The film stars actor Amane Okayama as Yuusuke, a young man who works in a ramen shop frequented by numerous Japanese rock bands. Yuusuke dreams of being a photographer, and he decides to follow his dreams by becoming a cameraman for live concert events. Ousama ni Nare also features appearances by numerous musicians, including: Teru and Jiro of GLAY; Atsushi Horie, Hidekazu Hinata and Shinpei Nakayama of Straightener; Hirotaka Takahashi of The Predators; Ryosuke Sasaki, Tomoya Tabuchi, Hiroaki Arai and Hiroyuki Suzuki of THE KEBABS; Yoko and Shinya Kusube of Casablanca; Hirata Panda, Beat Ryo, Hoshikawa Don't Let Me Down, Honma Domino and Chiba O'Reilly of THE BOHEMIANS; Eiichi Miyamoto of syurispeiloff; Ena Fujita, Asako Miyazaki, Aya Matsuoka and Misaki Yoshikawa of SHISHAMO. To celebrate 30 years of the pillows' existence, the band also held their own temporary museum. Titled \\"the pillows museum: Buster's Diner\\" the event took the form of a vintage american diner filled with memorabilia related to the band. The shop also sold FLCL themed collaboration goods. The museum ran from August 30 to September 8 at Shibuya Tower Records, followed by a run from September 13-22 in Osaka. Logo and mascot The band's logo, as it has appeared on their releases since the 1998 album Little Busters. Buster-kun Buster-kun has been The Pillows' mascot since about 1998, when on a visit to London, the band saw a doll of a \\"grotesque and creepy-looking teddy bear\\" in a shop window. Since then it has been constantly used in promotional videos, album artwork and goods such as T-shirts and bracelets. Buster-kun was named after the Little Busters album and the group also uses the term \\"little busters\\" for its fans. The original doll can be seen in the promotional video for the song \\"Hybrid Rainbow\\" and on the DVD video and artwork cover of the Hello, Welcome to Bubbletown's Happy Zoo (Instant Show) DVD. In an interview, Sawao commented on the reason why they adopted Buster-kun and what it represents to the band's music: \\"The original doll was made out of really dirty old leather and had a real-looking eye and tongue, but one of the eyes was a button and it was displayed in a window, shaking like it was being electrocuted. We still don't know what it was and why it was there, because it wasn't in a store display window and it didn't look like it was for commercial purposes, but it just seemed like someone's idea of a prank or some artist's work that we thought was interesting. So we used it in our jacket booklet and while we were on tour, we thought of placing that bear image on T-shirts, so we sent the picture to a designer to arrange it. At first it looks cute, but once you get up close, it has sharp teeth like it's ready to bite any minute. So that kind- of-cute but kind-of-scary look fits right in with The Pillows music perfectly.\\".

In a March 2020 press release, Metro announced that it will invest about $420 million within next 5 years for the construction of a new automated distribution center for fresh and frozen products, which they hope to open in 2023. History The company was founded in 1947 in Verdun, Quebec by Rolland Jeanneau. Many independent grocery stores joined the company to form Magasins Lasalle Stores Lt√©e. In 1952, Magasins Lasalles Stores Lt√©e change its name to √âpiceries Lasalle Groceteria. The company had 43 affiliated grocery stores at the time. In 1955, they were 50 franchised stores and the company with a revenue of $2 million. The company gained fame in 1956 through an advertisement in La Presse which showed turkeys sold for 39 cents. That year, mayor Jean Drapeau was already talking about implementing in Montreal a rapid transit system to be called the Montreal Metro. This inspired the company to create a division called Metro. Other grocery stores joined the company bringing its number of stores to 73 in 1957 with revenue of $10 million. Because of the success of the Metro division, the company renamed itself Metro-Lasalle in 1963. In 1972, Metro-Lasalle changed its name to Metro-Lt√©e. Metro merged with the March√© Richelieu grocery chain in 1975 to become Groupe Metro-Richelieu Inc in 1976. In the early 1980s, Metro went through harder times due to fierce competition from Provigo and the recession. Metro merged with Epiciers Unis Inc. and took on the name Metro- Richelieu Inc. (dropping the \\"Groupe\\" from its name). During the rest of the 1980s, it fared better and entered the Montreal Stock Exchange in 1986. Metro suffered from the early 1990s recession. A restructuring plan was established, a new logo was created and changes were brought in the management team. Metro acquired 48 of 112 Steinberg supermarkets when that company went bankrupt in 1992. These stores were rebranded as Super C and Metro stores. Metro entered the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1993. It acquired Loeb Stores from Loblaws in 1999. The Metro Plus banner was established in the early 2000s. Some of the stores were converted to Super C, while others continued to operate as Loeb. The Super C stores in Ontario were converted to Food Basics. In 2009, the company converted all Loeb stores to Metro. =Mergers and acquisitions = On July 19, 2005, Metro, Inc. announced that it had reached an agreement with The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, Inc. and its subsidiary, A&P; Luxembourg S.√†.r.l., to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of A&P; Canada, for an acquisition price of $1.7 billion, consisting of $1.2 billion in cash and $500 million in the form of treasury shares of Metro.Metro Inc. in deal to buy A&P; Canada for $1.7B The purchase was completed on August 15, 2005,Metro Inc. corporate website and after beating out Sobeys in a bidding war, Metro now has a network in Quebec and Ontario of 573 conventional and discount food stores, and 256 pharmacies.

Food Basics stores were not affected as it competes in the discount food segment.Baker section of a Metro store in Brampton.Metro now holds the second largest market share in the food distribution and retailing business in Quebec and Ontario with nearly $11 billion in sales and more than 65,000 employees. Its stores operate under the banners Metro, Metro Plus, Super C, Food Basics, March√© Ami, Les 5 Saisons and March√© Adonis. Its pharmacies operate under the banners Brunet, The Pharmacy, Clini-Plus, and Drug Basics. In 2017, Metro acquired Canadian meal kit service, Miss Fresh. In May 2018, Metro closed a $4.5 billion (CAD) acquisition of the Quebec drug chain Jean Coutu Group, making it one of Canada‚Äôs largest retailers and distributors of food and drugs. Loyalty programs Stores under the Metro and Metro Plus banners offer one of the following loyalty programs: * Stores in Ontario, excluding those in Thunder Bay, participate in the Air Miles program. Customers earn 1 reward mile for every $20 spent cumulatively each week (Sunday to Saturday). Points may be redeemed for a variety of items, including in-store grocery redemptions (95 miles can be redeemed for $10 in groceries). * Due to Metro's Ontario stores (then A&P; Canada) joining Air Miles after Safeway, which has locations in Thunder Bay, Metro's locations in that city have their own loyalty program called Thunder Bucks. Similar to Air Miles, customers earn 1 Thunder Point for every $20 spent, and bonus-points promotions are generally equivalent to those offered for Air Miles in the rest of the province. However, points are automatically redeemed for gift certificates at the rate of 125 points per $20 gift certificate. * For similar reasons (Air Miles has a partnership with Sobeys/IGA in Quebec), locations in Quebec have their own program, metro&moi; (Metro and Me). Customers earn 1 point for every $1 spent; points are automatically converted to rewards vouchers which are mailed every three months at a rate of $1 per 125 points accumulated (with a minimum balance of 500 points required for vouchers to be mailed). In spring 2015, Metro agreed to drop its exclusivity on the Air Miles program in Ontario; as a result, Sobeys stores throughout that province now offer Air Miles rewards in parallel with Metro. However, Sobeys (which now also owns Safeway Canada) did not reciprocate, and Metro continues to be unable to offer Air Miles in either Quebec or Thunder Bay.

The old province is coterminous with the present-day Davao Region or Region XI. It was divided into three provinces of Davao del Norte, Davao Oriental, and Davao del Sur with the passage of Philippine Republic Act No. 4867 on May 8, 1967. Two more provinces, Compostela Valley (now Davao de Oro) and Davao Occidental, were carved out of the territories of Davao del Norte and Davao del Sur respectively. The descendant provinces were reorganized into the current region in 2001. It was one of the largest, most populous and prosperous provinces in the country during its time, being settled by immigrants from the Luzon and the Visayas. Existence The province was established after the dissolution of Moro Province in 1914. Before the province broke up, massive waves of immigrants from Visayas and Luzon island groups are already settling in the province. Japanese immigrants, mostly rich businessmen and pioneers, also settled in its capital Davao in large numbers, making it the Philippines' Little Japan. Having an area of more than 20,000 square kilometers, its borders were almost identical to its predecessor, the province of Nueva Guip√∫zcoa that existed from 1849 to 1858, which also covered parts of what are now Cotabato, South Cotabato, Sarangani, Bukidnon and the region of Caraga during the Spanish era. After the dissolution of Nueva Guipozcoa, it was then converted into the Politico-Military Commandancia of Davao (District of Davao) for many years before it was incorporated into the Moro Province. It was converted into a regular province and was made a district of Department of Mindanao and Sulu from 1914 until 1920. Its capital town, Davao, became a city on March 16, 1936 as the provincial congressman Romualdo Quimpo filed Bill 609 (passed as Commonwealth Act 51), paving the creation of the city from the merger of the town of Davao (Mayo) and Guianga District. The bill called for the appointment of local officials by Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon. By then, it was the only city in the province throughout the latter's existence. What is now the Davao City Legislative Building served as the capitol for the governor and other provincial officials in the province. On 1942, during the outbreak of World War II in the Philippines, forces of the Imperial Japanese Army invaded the province, becoming one of the territories in the country to be first taken by Japan. Guerrilla parties were then organized in the province to battle Japanese garrison forces there. It was in late 1944 when the Allies began liberating the island of Mindanao, and earlier the next year the dreadful Battle of Davao was fought to eliminate any Japanese resistance in the province. The province was one of the few provinces in the country to recover quickly from the war. Its capital city resumed its role as the main economic center of Mindanao. Though some local Japanese inhabitants in the provinces were expelled from the country due to enmity after the war, most have been integrated to the local Filipino population. After the war, migration to the province has steadily increased due to the great employment and agricultural opportunities the province have, especially in its capital city. In 1948, all municipal districts in the country have been abolished. This paved the way for the creation of several towns in the province, such as Digos, Padada, Compostela, and many others. To reorganize governance in the country, President Ferdinand E. Marcos signed the Republic Act No. 4867 on May 8, 1967, dividing the province into three. The then-Davao Province is currently a region consisting of five provinces: Davao del Sur, Davao del Norte, Davao Occidental, Davao Oriental and Davao de Oro. The province of Davao del Norte bore this name from 1972 until 1998, when Compostela Valley (now Davao de Oro) seceded as a separate province. Davao Occidental was created by virtue of Republic Act 10360 enacted on July 23, 2013; the province is the newest in the country, carved out from the southern part of Davao del Sur. The Act was passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate on November 28, 2012, and December 5, 2012, respectively, and signed by President Benigno Aquino III on January 14, 2013. A plebiscite was held on October 28, 2013 along with the Barangay elections, and the majority of votes cast were \\"Yes\\", ratifying the province.

It is produced when two tones that are an octave apart are repeatedly played in alternation (\\"high-low-high-low\\") through stereo headphones. The same sequence is played to both ears simultaneously; however when the right ear receives the high tone, the left ear receives the low tone, and conversely. Instead of hearing two alternating pitches, most subjects instead hear a single tone that alternates between ears while at the same time its pitch alternates between high and low. PDF Document First experiment The two tones used were pitched at 400 Hz and 800 Hz, corresponding roughly to G4 and G5 in modern pitch notation. Each tone was played for 250 ms before switching ears. No gaps were allowed between tones. Both tones were therefore always present during the experiment; only the ears perceiving the high and the low tone at any one time changed repeatedly. After the initial test, the headphones were reversed, and the test was repeated. Results Model of the octave illusion in terms of separate \\"what\\" and \\"where\\" decision mechanisms 86 subjects were tested, and none perceived the tonal pattern correctly. Most subjects heard a single tone that alternated in pitch by an octave as it alternated between ears. When the earphones were reversed, the ear that initially heard the high tone continued to hear the high tone, and the ear that initially heard the low tone continued to hear the low tone. Some subjects only heard a single tone that moved between ears but did not change in pitch, or changed very slightly. Several subjects heard various \\"complex\\" illusions, such as two alternating pitches in one ear and a third pitch that sporadically occurred in the other ear. Handedness also played an important role in the results. 58% of right-handed subjects and 52% of left-handed subjects heard a single pitch that switched between octaves as it switched between ears. Of the remaining subjects, nearly three times as many right-handers than left-handers heard a tone that switched ears but not pitch. Left-handed subjects were varied in their localization of the high and low tones, while right-handed subjects were much more likely to hear the high tone localized to their right ear during both tests. Deutsch proposed that when a single tone that alternates between octaves is heard, this illusion results from the combined operation of two decision mechanisms. First, to determine the tone's location, high pitches are given precedence; second, to determine the tone's pitch, tones in the dominant ear are given precedence over tones in the non-dominant ear. (PDF). This is known as the two-channel model, since it is proposed that the operation of two separate \\"what\\" and \\"where\\" decision mechanisms combine to produce the illusion. The model is illustrated here. Further experiments In a further experiment, Deutsch examined the effect of handedness and familial handedness background on perception of the octave illusion. PDF Document The subjects were 250 students, who were classified both according to their handedness and also according to whether they had a left-handed parent or sibling. It was found that right-handers were more likely to hear the high tone on the right (and the low tone on the left) than were mixed-handers, and mixed-handers were more likely to do so than left-handers. And for all three handedness groups the tendency to hear the high tone on the right was greater for subjects with only right-handed parents and siblings than for those with left- or mixed-handed parents or siblings. In another experiment, Deutsch and Roll explored the two- channel model in further detail. PDF Document They played 44 right-handed subjects a repeating pattern of tones pitched at 400 Hz and 800 Hz. This time the right ear was given three 800 Hz pitches alternating with two 400 Hz pitches, while the left ear simultaneously heard three 400 Hz pitches alternating with two 800 Hz pitches. A 250 ms pause was added between each successive tone combination. Subjects were asked to report how many high tones and how many low tones they heard, and in which ears they heard the tones. The results were consistent with the initial experiment. In further experiments based on the same model Deutsch asked subjects to report whether the pattern was of the \\"high-low-high-low\\" type or the \\"low-high-low-high\\" type. From this it could be determined which ear the subject was following for pitch. The amplitude of the unheard pitch was then manipulated in order to determine how large it needed to be, in order to counteract the effect, and it was found that a significant amplitude disparity was sometimes needed. It was also determined that, when both tones were not present at the same time, the illusion was broken. PDF Document In yet other experiments, Deutsch varied the relative amplitudes of the high and low tones and asked subjects whether the pattern was of the \\"right-left-right-left-\\" type or the \\"left-right-left- right\\" type. From this it could be determined whether the subject was localizing the tone to the high or low pitch. Again, it was found that a large amplitude disparity was sometimes needed to counteract the effect. PDF Document PDF Document \\"Deutsch illusion\\" Brancucci, Padulo, and Tommasi argue that the octave illusion should be renamed the \\"Deutsch illusion\\", since, according to their findings, the illusion is not limited to the octave. They performed an experiment similar to Deutsch‚Äôs original, except the two tones that were used ranged in interval from a minor third to an eleventh. The tones were presented initially for 200 ms before switching ears, then again for 500 ms. While the illusion was present for several people at all intervals, the illusion occurred more often with wider intervals. Criticism and rebuttal  Chambers, Moss, and Mattingley believe that the illusion is caused by a combination of harmonic fusion and binaural diplacusis, a condition in which a pitch is perceived slightly differently between ears. In experiments employing a few subjects, none reported the percept most commonly obtained by Deutsch‚Äôs subjects. This does not necessarily conflict with other studies, as the number of subjects used in this experiment was small and there are individual differences in perception of the illusion. The authors also argued that experiments conducted by others did not clarify whether the high tone and low tones were perceived as being an octave apart. They claimed, therefore, that their results were not consistent with those of Deutsch in relation to hand dominance and ear dominance versus location of pitch. These criticisms were rebutted in two articles. Deutsch (2004a) (PDF). used a new procedure, which provided more explicit documentation of the octave illusion; here musically trained subjects notated precisely what they heard. The experiment confirmed that subjects, on listening to the illusion, perceive an octave difference between the ears. This result cannot be explained by diplacusis, which refers to a difference of a fraction of a semitone between the ears. The article also documented that Chambers et al. used problematic procedures. In a further article, Deutsch (2004b) (PDF). showed that Chambers et al. made inappropriate comparisons with other phenomena of sound perception, and failed to consider several key findings that support Deutsch‚Äôs model. In addition, the octave illusion, in which an octave difference between the ears is perceived, has been replicated in several other laboratories. For example, Oehler and Reuter recently replicated the handedness correlate in a study of 174 subjects Lamminmaki and Hari (2000) and Lamminmaki et al. (2012) in MEG studies provide an explanation of the illusion at the neurophysiological level that is in accordance with Deutsch‚Äôs two-channel model.

The game was released in 2000, and has been re-released through the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita consoles. Vagrant Story was primarily developed by the team responsible for Final Fantasy Tactics, with Yasumi Matsuno serving as producer, writer and director. The game takes place in the fictional kingdom of Valendia and the ruined city of Le√° Monde. The story centers on Ashley Riot, an elite agent known as a Riskbreaker, who must travel to Le√° Monde to investigate the link between a cult leader and a senior Valendian Parliament member, Duke Bardorba. In the prologue, Ashley is blamed for murdering the duke, and the game discloses the events that happen one week before the murder. Vagrant Story is unique as a console action-adventure role- playing game in that it features no shops and no player interaction with other characters; instead, the game focuses on weapon creation and modification, as well as elements of puzzle-solving and strategy. The game received critical acclaim from gaming magazines and websites. Gameplay Vagrant Story is a solo action role-playing game, in which the player controls Ashley Riot from a third-person perspective while exploring Le√° Monde and the catacombs underneath. The player may also switch into first-person perspective to allow for a 360¬∞ view using the START button or right analog stick on the game controller. Characters and sprites are proportionate with each other, and the player navigates Ashley on a three-dimensional field map. Navigation is in real-time, and areas accessed by the player are stored in an in-game map menu. Ashley can run, jump, and push crates and cubes to navigate around obstacles, adding puzzle and platforming elements to gameplay. During the game, the player must sometimes solve block puzzles to advance the story. When the player returns to a completed block puzzle room, a time-attack mode called \\"Evolve, or Die!!\\" begins. Players must reach the end of the room in the shortest time possible, after which they are ranked. This stage is optional and can be turned off from the menu. In the field map, players may engage the enemy as soon as they enter Battle Mode, which uses a pausable real-time combat system, much like Square's Parasite Eve (1998). In Battle Mode, when the player taps the attack button, a spherical grid appears around Ashley. Individual body parts within this sphere can be targeted. The battle system involves the player chaining different attacks known as Chain Abilities to achieve large combos and deal damage to the enemy. This is done by pressing buttons in timely succession, making combat resemble a rhythm game. In addition to Chain Abilities, Defensive Abilities allow Ashley to reduce or reflect damage or avoid status ailments. Ashley also gains Break Arts, which exchange his hit points (HP) for increased damage. Ashley attacks a Crimson Blade soldier. The exclamation mark indicates the point where the player can chain attacks; reflexes must be keen to inflict higher damage to the enemy. Magic in Vagrant Story is learned later in the game using Grimoires that are dropped by enemies. Once a Grimoire is used, the magic spell associated with the Grimoire will remain in the menu, and players only need to spend magic points (MP) to cast a learned spell. Magic spells can be used to attack, heal, create status effects, and manipulate Ashley's elemental and enemy affinities. Certain magic spells allow the player to affect multiple targets by using a small sphere positioned within the Battle Mode wire frame. Unlike physical attacks however, magic attacks cannot be chained. Risk is an essential element in the battle system. A Risk bar is placed below the HP and MP bar, representing the Risk Points the player has accumulated. Risk Points affect Ashley's concentration; the longer Ashley attacks a target, the more his Risk Point accumulates, lowering his accuracy and defenses. Chain and Defensive Abilities increase Risk faster than regular attacks, while Break Arts do not increase Risk at all. Enemy attacks and spells deal more damage if the player has high Risk. The advantage, however, is the higher chances for the player to score critical hits and restore higher HP. Vagrant Storys crafting system allows the player to create and customize weapons and armor in designated \\"workshop\\" areas, inputting various ranges, strengths, and statistics. Weapons fall into one of three main damage types: blunt, piercing, and edged. Equipment are influenced by their material and affinity to enemy classes and elements. Affinities influence the effectiveness of weapons and armor; however, equipment might lose one form of affinity when it gains another type. Weapons and armor can be combined, merging their affinities and sometimes creating a new type of blade or armor in the process. Different weapon types have different ranges, such as a crossbow having a longer range than melee weapons such as a mace. Like several Square titles, the New Game Plus option is made available to the player upon first completing the game. In Vagrant Story, selecting \\"New Game+\\" enables the player to replay the story using their end-game weapons, items, and statistics instead of the defaults. This option allows players to access a hidden level, which features more intimidating enemies and more powerful equipment. The story does not change, and original enemy statistics will remain at default. Plot =Setting= The Rood of Iocus, mystic symbol of the game. Vagrant Story is set in the fictitious city of Le√° Monde, while the kingdom of Valendia is engulfed in civil war. Le√° Monde is an old town with a history spanning more than two millennia. Located on an island surrounded by reefs, the walls have been the \\"witness of many battles\\" and are \\"stronger than the mightiest forts of Valendia\\". In its golden years, Le√° Monde was a thriving community until an earthquake struck the town 25 years before the game, destroying the city and leaving the ground unstable. The Grand Cathedral and the Temple of Kiltia are at the center of the city. This area is surrounded by the west and east districts, both in fairly good shape, as well as the massive, fortress-like City Walls. Beneath the ground are an abandoned mineshaft and limestone quarry, the shadowy labyrinths of an \\"Undercity\\", and the dark Iron Maiden dungeon. The maze-like Snowfly Forest, named for the so-called snowflies that can be found within, covers part of the city. Other locations include the Graylands, the setting for the prologue event; and Valnain, the city where the Valendia Knights of Peace's Headquarters is located. While Valendia and Le√° Monde are fictitious, the game's scenery is inspired by real-life landscapes of the southwest of France, including the city of Saint-√âmilion. =Characters= The protagonist is Ashley Riot, a male member of the Valendia Knights of the Peace (VKP) in pursuit of a cult leader named Sydney Losstarot. Sydney, leader of the religious cult M√ºllenkamp, laid siege to Duke Bardorba's manor in search of a key and kidnapped Bardorba's son, Joshua. Ashley's partner is Callo Merlose, an agent of the VKP Inquisitors. Also attempting to capture Sydney is Romeo Guildenstern of the Crimson Blades, whose mission was undertaken without the approval of the VKP.VKP Officer: Furthermore, we must find out why the Cardinal sent his blades to deal with this incident without our approval. Ashley is a Riskbreaker, a militant division of the VKP responsible for upholding state security and law.Rosencrantz: We were always the champions of justice, true, but a justice that served the state alone. Although Callo accompanies him, Ashley does not accept her as a combat partner due to her lack of combat experience.Ashley: An agent with no combat experience would just be a liability. Callo ends up being Sydney's hostage and discovers the truth of M√ºllenkamp's activities. Another Riskbreaker, Rosencrantz, appears during Ashley's battles in Le√° Monde, briefing him on the plans of the VKP, Sydney and the Cardinal, and subsequently his take on Ashley's past. This casts suspicion on Ashley's behalf, as Riskbreakers always work alone. The Crimson Blades, under direct orders of Cardinal Batistum, are a group that is part of the Cardinal's Knights of the Cross, in charge of seeking heretics and quelling cults.Ashley: Are cults not the Templars' concern? Romeo Guildenstern, their leader, is a pious man, deeply faithful to his belief and consequently immune to the Dark's powers. Under orders of the Cardinal, he pursues Sydney with a small army in his command and his captains: Samantha, Duane, Grissom, Tieger and Neesa.Guildenstern: Grissom, gather our remaining men. Join with Tieger's knights, and crush M√ºllenkamp. Go! / Grissom: By your command. M√ºllenkamp is a cult based in Le√° Monde.Rosencrantz: However, Le√° Monde has strong ties to the Dark, for this is the Dark city of the ancient Kildean priestess M√ºllenkamp. The city suffered a catastrophe when the population was killed in an earthquake.Narrator:At its height, Le√° Monde was a thriving community more than 5,000 people strong. Twenty-five years ago, a great earthquake brought that chapter in Le√° Monde's history to a close. The city, filled with corpses controlled by Darkness, is the cult's stronghold. Sydney and his accomplice, Hardin, survive the pursuit of the Crimson Blade, though Hardin sometimes doubts Sydney's intentions. =Story= The plot of Vagrant Story, titled \\"The Phantom Pain\\", is presented as the prelude to the \\"story of the wanderer\\".Narrator: And so began the story of the wanderer, the vagrant./ Title Card: \\"The Phantom Pain\\". Beginning in the Graylands, Ashley and Callo are sent by the VKP to Duke Bardorba's manor to investigate the Duke's involvement with M√ºllenkamp and the Cardinal's interest in Sydney Losstarot.VKP Officer: Our Inquisitors have found that M√ºllenkamp's coin comes from the captive duke himself. Ashley infiltrates the manor and encounters Sydney, witnessing his powers first hand.Ashley: What's going on? You were most certainly dead! Leave the back-from-the-grave stuff to faerie tales... Duke Bardorba: The fool Sydney used his wyvern. We can't have witnesses telling the world, can we? Sydney escapes with his accomplice Hardin and the Duke's son Joshua, leaving Ashley with a clue to his whereabouts.Sydney: I...I'm the one you want. Hardin...go quickly...go...to Le√° Monde. This event was dubbed the \\"Graylands Incident\\". Ashley Riot faces a wyvern during the opening sequence. The game directly switches between event cutscenes and gameplay using the same character models. Ashley and Callo arrive in Le√° Monde and a lone Ashley infiltrates the city through the underground wine cellars. Along the way, he learns of objects holding magical power known as Grimoires and the city's power to spawn the undead and mythological creatures.Crimson Blade: ...with a Grimoire, your fattest sow could outfly my swiftest falcon - if ye believe the chroniclers. He encounters Guildenstern and his lover Samantha, and learns of the condition known as incomplete death and the Cardinal's true intention for his pursuit of Sydney: immortality.Guildenstern: Trapped in purgation, they yearn for life. Thus they seek bodies without souls...and the \\"corpses that walk\\" are born. Guildenstern: There is one who has found the true undeath. Immortality, my love. The Crimson Blades confront Ashley and reveals his presence to Guildenstern. Escaping unharmed, Ashley encounters Rosencrantz who intends to join him, though Ashley declines.Ashley: You must know, Riskbreakers always work alone. And a change of plans mid-mission is unthinkable. Rosencrantz tells him of the VKP and the Parliaments' knowledge of the dark powers of Le√° Monde, and that the hidden powers deep within a person can be unleashed with the help of the Dark. In his encounters with Sydney, Ashley is shown visions of his past, where his wife Tia and his son Marco are killed by rogues. Meeting Rosencrantz again, Ashley is told that they were not his family, but mistaken targets he killed during a mission of theirs. Ashley's guilt over their deaths was manipulated by the VKP to turn Ashley into a loyal Riskbreaker.Sydney: You were an assassin and a saboteur in an elite squad. Mistaking them for your target, you murdered an innocent family. For country and justice you would take any life without thinking, until you sent that family to their deaths. The VKP saw the opportunity to turn your guilt to patriotic zeal. They twisted your very soul, Ashley. Ashley recalls his hidden battle skills and experiences \\"clairvoyance\\", seeing the progress of the Crimson Blades, which leads him to the Great Cathedral. Sydney had captured Callo earlier and brought her with them. Callo learned that Hardin was skeptical of Sydney's plans.Hardin: Were the duke's betrayal, the cardinal's meddling...and a Riskbreaker strong as a bloody titan all part of your precious plan, too, Sydney? She begins to develop the powers of \\"heart- seeing\\", a form of telepathy, as they continue their escape deeper into Le√° Monde.Hardin: As I can scrye on distant locales, so the talent of the heart- seers has flowered in you. With her powers, she learned of Sydney's intentions and Hardin's reason to join M√ºllenkamp and his closeness to Joshua.Hardin: The key-bearer, the duke, will soon die. If he dies without a successor, all is lost. The duke thinks he can cut off the cursed M√ºllenkamp bloodline, but that must not be allowed to happen. We will assume the legacy. Hardin: There was an investigation into an incident. I was part of a special team, entrusted with delivering blades to rebels in a neighboring kingdom. Apparently, some did not reach their destination. They claimed some of us were making coppers selling the steel on the black market. ...We were all guilty, I was not the only one. They presented me with an offer. Betray my friends, and I would walk free.Hardin: ...I had a brother, half my age. He was gravely ill, and we knew not when he would leave us. I wanted money...I wanted my freedom. I sold my friend, my brother. But they did not set me free. When I escaped from prison, my brother was dead. Sydney left them to stop the others from advancing; taunting Guildenstern and Samantha, and provoking Ashley to follow him as he intends to bestow his powers upon Ashley.Sydney: I give you the city, Riskbreaker! All its power - all to you! Make haste! Join me! Already, your powers are close to readiness! Come! Ashley was not interested in inheriting the powers of Darkness; seeing that Callo had been captured, his only intention is to rescue her.Ashley: Keep your accursed city! Where's Merlose!? While discussing the Gran Grimoire, a powerful source of magic, Guildenstern and Samantha discover ancient Kildean letterings carved throughout the city walls.Samantha: The Gran Grimoire...the ultimate codex of sorcery. Rosencrantz reveals that the city is the Gran Grimoire and its power lies at the city center: the Grand Cathedral. As Guildenstern leaves for the Grand Cathedral, Rosencrantz searches for Ashley and Sydney. Finding them, Rosencrantz, confident in his immunity against Darkness, tries to force Sydney to surrender his powers.Rosencrantz: It is time. I will carry on the legacy in your name. Now, the rites! Name me your successor!! Rosencrantz also assaults Ashley to prove that he is not a suitable candidate for the powers of Darkness.Rosencrantz: This...This is your \\"successor\\"? Open your eyes, Sydney. I am the one! Sydney refuses to listen and kills Rosencrantz by using a possessed statue, leaving Ashley to once again prove himself as his chosen successor. Guildenstern continues on to the Great Cathedral in the center of the city, leading him to Callo, Hardin and Joshua. Interrogating Hardin about a certain \\"key\\" known as the Blood-Sin,Guildenstern: The Blood-Sin, you say? It has a familiar ring... Years past, during the Inquisition of the heretics, the \\"Rood Inverse\\" was carved on them, an abjuration of the flesh... Those who bore this tattoo called it the Blood-Sin. Guildenstern: Good God! Sydney held the key all along! The tattoo on his back, it is the Blood-Sin! He has the key! He has played you false! Guildenstern reveals his intentions in acquiring the Dark's powers.Guildenstern: ...the nobility! They do nothing and blame others for their failure; they steal men's dreams and twist them to nightmares...We must cleanse this corruption. There must be strong, unwavering justice. And there must be fear to enforce that justice. Sydney arrives to teleport Hardin and the rest away, leaving him to Guildenstern. Guildenstern acquires the \\"key\\" from him and murders Samantha as his sacrifice for the powers of darkness. Ashley arrives later and listens as Sydney reveals his true intentions.Sydney: I wanted to help father, as he helped me when I was born. He wanted the city destroyed, even if it meant his own death. Then, he implored me. Ashley then confronts Guildenstern and manages to defeat him. Upon Guildenstern's defeat, Ashley, now bearing the \\"key\\", carries Sydney out of the collapsing city. The creatures spawned within the city begin to disappear. Callo, Hardin and Joshua escape the city, though Hardin dies and the fate of Callo and Joshua remains unknown. In the epilogue, Ashley goes to visit the ailing Duke Bardorba in his manor, although once they were alone, it was Sydney who was in the room. Sydney tells the duke that he had found a suitable heir to the Darkness in Ashley, and that their plan to inherit the powers of Darkness was successful.Duke Bardorba: So, it is done...You have suffered much. I, too, have played my part. Let us leave the rest to this Ashley. He is the one you have chosen.. The duke then proceeds to kill Sydney, and he himself died soon after of unknown causes. In a report received by the VKP a week after the Graylands Incident, the duke was believed to be murdered, and Ashley became the prime suspect, though he was never found again. Development Matsuno, the game's producer and director, preferred to create a new game title from scratch and use design ideas from staff collaborations, rather than reusing popular characters and designs that are found in sequels. Vagrant Story is regarded as a mixture of genres, as it contains elements of role-playing in its battles and platform games when in the field map. Matsuno explained that the development team was not eager to place Vagrant Story into a specific genre, preferring to create the game with a genre of its own. Saint-√âmilion. During the design phase, Matsuno was shown photographs from France, particularly Saint-√âmilion in the region of Bordeaux. This region was visited by one of Matsuno's colleagues, who was a wine enthusiast and favored Saint-√âmilion, one of the largest vineyards of Bordeaux. Captivated by this small town's architecture, the design team went on a trip to France to adopt these styles into the game. A team of five people was formed in September 1998, including Matsuno and the principal persons in charge of graphics and decorations, to realize the game's setting. Development of the game began in January 1998, spanning two years with manpower that steadily increased from 20 to 50 at peak development phase. The storyline conceived for the game follows Ashley Riot's origins as a dedicated government agent prior to being the titular \\"vagrant\\" who is \\"involved in many incidents\\" after the events in Le√° Monde. Inspiration for the plot is derived from Hollywood \\"classic and blockbuster\\" films as well as European and Asian films. The gameplay was conceived to cater to hardcore gamers who do not \\"ask for hints and read through strategy guides\\". However, Matsuno revealed that over half of the game's story was cut due to capacity and development time constraints. Memory issues was considered the most challenging aspect of the game development, with the team forced to adjust the game's interface, texture mapping and polygon mesh in maps, as well as removing gaming elements such as AI-controlled supporting non-player characters that would have joined Ashley in the middle of the game. Vagrant Story was conceived during a time when most games had made the transition into three-dimensional graphics. Games with real-time polygons were the mainstream, and it was decided for Vagrant Story to follow this trend. Murata, the main programmer, expressed his concerns in working towards a large-scale three-dimensional game for the first time. To avoid discrepancies in the frame rate caused by the large number of polygon models, the modeling team had to select an aspect of each character to focus their attention. Art director Minagawa mentioned that painstaking detail were given to each individual model, even to characters that only appear for a few seconds in the game. The same character models were used throughout the game to create a seamless transition between event cutscenes and actual gameplay. The sound effects of Vagrant Story are credited to Minoru Akao, the game's sound programmer; and Tomohiro Yajima, the sound editor and engineer. =Releases= A demo disc of Vagrant Story was included in the packaging of Seiken Densetsu: Legend of Mana in Japan. During the Square Millennium Event held by Square in Tokyo, movies of Vagrant Story such as the opening sequence and the weapon crafting system were presented to onlookers. Matsuno stated that a normal playthrough would take the player five to six hours to complete. In North America, Vagrant Story was released as part of Square's \\"Summer of Adventure\\" that lasted from May to September 2000. Vagrant Story was released with two discs; the first disc is the game itself, while the second disc is a demo disc released by Square to give the player a preview of seven titles. The seven titles include three interactive demos and four non-interactive demos; the former being Chocobo Racing, Front Mission 3 and Threads of Fate, and the latter Chrono Cross, SaGa Frontier 2, Chocobo's Dungeon 2 and Legend of Mana. Both discs were included in the North American release on May 15, 2000. Due to a ruling by the Quebec government that video game titles in Canada should be sold with both French and English-language instructions, Vagrant Story's release was delayed in Canada. In the European PAL release, the game did not feature the additional demo disc. =Merchandise= On April 13, 2000, DigiCube published the Vagrant Story Ultimania, the official 496-page strategy guide for the game with the . The contents include staff interviews, a detailed background story, and information on monsters and items. On July 20, 2006, the book was republished by Studio BentStuff and Square Enix. Other merchandise include jewellery, T-shirts, cigarette lighters and posters featuring character artwork and CG renders. For the North American release, a 16-page comic-book tie-in with art by Steve Firchow, Clarence Lansang and Michael Turner of Witchblade fame was published by Eruptor Entertainment and Squaresoft. The comic was freely distributed at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2000 and included an interview between Matsuno and Square Electronic Arts assistant product manager Andrew Shiozaki. =Music= The original score for Vagrant Story was composed, arranged, and produced by Hitoshi Sakimoto, whose previous video game works included the soundtracks to Radiant Silvergun and Final Fantasy Tactics, with additional arrangement by Takeharu Ishimoto for Track 2‚Äì30 and Hirosato Noda for Track 2‚Äì31. A Japanese orchestra ensemble, Shinozuka Group, performed for the orchestral piece of Track 2‚Äì29. All synthesizing operations are led by Takeharu Ishimoto with assistance from Hidenori Iwasaki for Track 1‚Äì1 and Hirosato Noda for Track 2‚Äì18. Sakimoto noted that during the initial phase, he composed \\"bright and cheerful\\" tunes similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, but Matsuno emphasized music that was \\"more deep and heavy\\". Matsuno also advised him to listen to music from The X-Files for ideas on ambient scores, and Sakimoto pointed out influences of James Horner and Hans Zimmer in his compositions. Sakimoto was impressed with the dedication of the development team to the game, and expressed uneasiness trying to come up with music during the game previews. Sakimoto created themes for each character and monster, and made several changes in their melody to reflect their relationships, feelings as well as antagonistic views. The soundtrack for Vagrant Story remains to be one of Sakimoto's favorite compositions. The album was first released on two Compact Discs by DigiCube on March 8, 2000 bearing the catalog number SSCX-10042. It was subsequently re- released by Square Enix on March 24, 2006 with the catalog number SQEX-10068/9; the re-release removed some of the original PlayStation synth reverb, yielding a slightly different version of the audio. The CDs contain 57 tracks, including two remixes and tracks that were not used in the game. Packaged with it is a small booklet featuring interviews with the composer and character artworks. Reception In May 2000, Vagrant Story was the fifth best-selling PlayStation title of the month. 100,000 units were sold in the first 20 days of the game's release, despite being overshadowed by other Square titles like Final Fantasy IX and Chrono Cross. Vagrant Story was the third of twenty games to date, and the only game on the PlayStation, to receive a perfect score of 40 from Famitsu magazine.„Éó„É¨„Ç§„Çπ„ÉÜ„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥ - „Éô„Ç§„Ç∞„É©„É≥„Éà„Çπ„Éà„Éº„É™„Éº. Weekly Famitsu. No.915 Pt.2. Pg.15. 30 June 2006. Reviews were generally positive‚Äîmultimedia news websites IGN and GameSpot praised the gameplay and story. IGN described the story as \\"so deep and intuitive that it'll likely please fans\\", and said the battle system maintains \\"a needed element of strategy and balance\\". The graphics were seen as a breakaway from the clich√©s of Square's contemporary titles. Extensive detail was given to the background settings and character expressions. The game's sound effects have been praised as \\"well done and impressive, straying from Square's synthed noise\\", as details such as the background audio help create a believable world for the player. The battle system, however, was described by GameSpot as too complex for beginner players, as even hard-core players require a \\"comprehensive understanding\\" of the weapon customization system. IGN pointed out that enemy encounters can be more difficult than boss battles. 1UP.com noted that the game's inventory was too limited for the vast number of customizations possible; this was considered particularly troublesome because some boss enemies are only vulnerable to certain types of weapons. Eric Bratcher reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Vagrant Story moves slowly, but with a compelling plot, great graphics, and a groundbreaking combat system, it rewards those with the patience to master its intricacies.\\" Alexander O. Smith is responsible for the English localization of Vagrant Story, using archaic English as compared to its straightforward Japanese version. His effort on translating Vagrant Story was described by Andrew Vestal as an \\"unparalleled‚Äîand unprecedented‚Äîwork\\" of Japanese to English video game translation, \\"in spite of the occasional typo or grammatical hiccup\\", as quoted by IGN. Vagrant Story was awarded \\"Best PlayStation Game\\" in the E3 2000 IGN Awards and was nominated for Best Console Action/Adventure in the 4th Annual Interactive Achievements Awards held by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. =Legacy= Three years after its 2000 release, Vagrant Story was selected as one of Sony's Greatest Hits. Games released as Greatest Hits were sold at a lower price, often increasing units sold. Vagrant Story is also part of Ultimate Hits, Square Enix's main budget range. The game was later made playable on Sony's PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3 consoles when Square Enix announced the title's release on the PlayStation Stores in Japan, Europe and North America. The 2006 role-playing video game Final Fantasy XII contains several references to Vagrant Story. Terms such as Riskbreaker, Le√°monde and Kildea (albeit with different spellings in the localizations), are commonly used in both games. According to an interview with Joypad, a French gaming magazine, in 2004, Yasumi Matsuno claimed during its development that Ivalice, the game world he created when he joined Square in 1995, is a complex world with a very long history and the stories of Vagrant Story, Final Fantasy Tactics, and Final Fantasy XII are said to unfold quite close on the Ivalice map. The original plan, however, was not to place Vagrant Story in the Ivalice universe. Matsuno stated in 2011 via his Twitter account that the plot elements of Final Fantasy Tactics found in Vagrant Story were meant to be intertextual reference to the Ivalice title as a form of \\"fan service\\". Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood referenced the game further in 2017 through the Return to Ivalice raid series, most notably by including an alternate version of the city of Valnain and Le√° Monde as existing locations in its own world. Vagrant Story is acknowledged as a game with an \\"extreme popularity\\" outside Japan eight years after it was first released. In October 2007, during an interview with the development team responsible for the remake of Final Fantasy Tactics for the PlayStation Portable, Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions, Executive Producer Akitoshi Kawazu was asked about the possibility of a remake or port of the title to the PSP. Kawazu mentioned that it is \\"the next natural candidate for such an update\\", although there would be difficulty in porting the game, because it was a title that already pushed the original PlayStation to its technical limits. Kawazu also remarked that bringing the character Ashley Riot into other Ivalice titles would be difficult since, even in Vagrant Story, \\"there's really not that much learn(ed) about Ashley Riot\\".

The Fab Mab or The Mab) was a San Francisco nightclub located at 443 Broadway, on the Broadway strip of North Beach, an area best known for its striptease clubs. History The Mabuhay was in the lower level of the 435 Broadway building, which also housed the On Broadway Theater, known in 1984-1985 as \\"Rock on Broadway.\\" Originally a Filipino restaurant and club owned by the late Ness Aquino, it featured many Filipino celebrities, including Amapola (a.k.a. Amapola Cabase). Aquino and Amapola also co-hosted a weekly television program, The Amapola Presents Show on KEMO TV Channel 20. During the late 1970s, Jerry Paulsen was the first promoter of bands to appear at the Mab on a regular basis. He booked them on Mondays and Tuesdays to begin with so he could showcase the bands that he featured in Psyclone magazine to existing record executives. The scene became so popular that he was soon booking two bands a night seven days a week. Bay Area punk and New Wave bands performed there, and it was an important touring stop for bands from beyond the San Francisco Bay Area. Among the local bands that performed regularly at the Mabuhay were The Adaptors, Avengers, Dead Kennedys, The Nuns, Crime, Dils, Pearl Harbor and the Explosions, The Mortals, new wave band Judy Garland, the Tubes and Wall of Voodoo, to name a few. After he left, Dirksen (the \\"pope of punk\\") booked The Dead Boys, Nico, The Runaways, Devo, X, The Police, SVT, The Go-Go's, Mot√∂rhead, Sun Ra and his Arkestra, Patti Smith, The Jim Carroll Band, REM, The Fabulous Titans and others. Comedians such as Whoopi Goldberg and Robin Williams also made early appearances at the venue. Dirk Dirksen,http://www.angelfire.com/oh/liveperformances/Mabuhay.html nephew of Senator Everett Dirksen, had a unique style as emcee, deliberately baiting and trading insults with audience and band members, which had the effect of raising the energy of audience and performers alike. In order to maintain the show's fast pace, he would move past an encore to get to the next band and tell the audience, \\"Eat it.\\" Dirksen's abrasive persona (which was largely a performance) was a central part of the atmosphere of the Mabuhay. He was sometimes referred to as the \\"poor man's Bill Graham.\\" Dirksen was the sole person responsible for connecting the English punk rockers with those in the United States. By creating an exchange program, punk bands for England and NY came to the Mabuhay and vice versa, staying in each city performing a few nights at a time. This spread the \\"punk\\" scene globally making it a household word, thanks to Dirksen and Aquino. The alley located next to the Mabuhay is now named for him. The Mabuhay Gardens closed in 1987.S.F.

N. Shepard. Circularity in judgments of relative pitch. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 36(12):2346‚Äì2353, 1964. separated by an interval of a tritone, or half octave, is heard as ascending by some people and as descending by others.Deutsch, D. A musical paradox. Music Perception, 3:275‚Äì280, 1986. Different populations tend to favor one of a limited set of different spots around the chromatic circle as central to the set of \\"higher\\" tones. Roger Shepard in 1963 had argued that such tone pairs would be heard ambiguously as either ascending or descending. However, psychology of music researcher Diana Deutsch in 1986 discovered that when the judgments of individual listeners were considered separately, their judgments depended on the positions of the tones along the chromatic circle. For example, one listener would hear the tone pair C‚ÄìF as ascending and the tone pair G‚ÄìC as descending. Yet another listener would hear the tone pair C‚ÄìF as descending and the tone pair G‚ÄìC as ascending. Furthermore, the way these tone pairs were perceived varied depending on the listener's language or dialect. Each Shepard tone consists of a set of octave-related sinusoids, whose amplitudes are scaled by a fixed bell-shaped spectral envelope based on a log frequency scale. For example, one tone might consist of a sinusoid at 440 Hz, accompanied by sinusoid at the higher octaves (880 Hz, 1760 Hz, etc.) and lower octaves (220 Hz, 110 Hz, etc.). The other tone might consist of a 311 Hz sinusoid, again accompanied by higher and lower octaves (622 Hz, 155.5 Hz, etc.). The amplitudes of the sinusoids of both complexes are determined by the same fixed-amplitude envelope--for example, the envelope might be centered at 370 Hz and span a six-octave range. Shepard predicted that the two tones would constitute a bistable figure, the auditory equivalent of the Necker cube, that could be heard ascending or descending, but never both at the same time. Diana Deutsch later found that perception of which tone was higher depended on the absolute frequencies involved: an individual will usually find the same tone to be higher, and this is determined by the tones' absolute pitches. This is consistently done by a large portion of the population, despite the fact that responding to different tones in different ways must involve the ability to hear absolute pitch, which was thought to be extremely rare. This finding has been used to argue that latent absolute-pitch ability is present in a large proportion of the population. In addition, Deutsch found that subjects from the south of England and from California resolved the ambiguity the opposite way.Deutsch, D. The tritone paradox: An influence of language on music perception. Music Perception, 8:335‚Äì347, 1991. Also, Deutsch, Henthorn and Dolson found that native speakers of Vietnamese, a tonal language, heard the tritone paradox differently from Californians who were native speakers of English.Deutsch, D., Henthorn T. and Dolson, M.

As the name suggests, it serves as city hall to that city. It is named after Don √Ångel Rivera Rodr√≠guez, who was mayor of Bayam√≥n from 1934 to 1944. Bayam√≥n City Hall was inaugurated in 1980 by Mayor Ram√≥n Luis Rivera at the cost of $7.2 million. Rivera stepped down as mayor in 2000, giving way for his son Ram√≥n Luis Rivera, Jr., to become mayor. So far it has been occupied by mayors representing the Partido Nuevo Progresista (PNP). Located next to El Parque del tren, the city hall is considered a tourist attraction, as it was built over an existing avenue to use its air rights. Visitors park next to the building, walk to the avenue, and board an elevator to reach the offices. The second floor has a glass-window bridge, from where the visitors can cross from one side to the other, while looking at cars pass by. The upper levels are all for office activities, including citizen complaints, city planning, etc. The building includes a theatre presenting live drama.

Epstein is currently the Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law and director of the Classical Liberal Institute at New York University, the Peter and Kirsten Bedford Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, and the James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Law emeritus and a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago. Epstein's writings have extensively influenced American legal thought. In 2000, a study published in The Journal of Legal Studies identified Epstein as the 12th-most cited legal scholar of the 20th century. In 2008, he was chosen in a poll taken by Legal Affairs as one of the most influential legal thinkers of modern times. A study of legal publications between 2009 and 2013 found Epstein to be the 3rd-most frequently cited American legal scholar during that period, behind only Cass Sunstein and Erwin Chemerinsky. He has been a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1985. Life and career Richard A. Epstein was born on April 17, 1943, in Brooklyn, New York. His grandparents were Ashkenazi Jews who immigrated to the United States from Russia and Austria in the early 20th century. Epstein's father, Bernard Epstein (19081978), was a radiologist, and his mother, Catherine Epstein (n√©e Reiser; 19082004), managed his father's medical office.Frey (2009). He has two sisters. He attended elementary school at P.S.161, a school that is now one of the Success Academy Charter Schools. Epstein and his family lived in Brooklyn until 1954, when his father began working at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center and their family moved to Great Neck, Long Island. Epstein attended Columbia University as an undergraduate student in the early 1960s. He had wide-ranging academic interests and did not wish to select a traditional single major, and obtained special permission from the university to pursue a self-selected program of study across the three areas of sociology, philosophy, and mathematics. He graduated with a B.A. summa cum laude from Columbia College in 1964. Epstein's undergraduate performance earned him a Kellett Fellowship, an award at Columbia that pays for two of each year's top graduates to spend two years in England studying at either Cambridge University or Oxford University. Epstein chose to attend Oxford, where he was a member of Oriel College and earned a first-class honours B.A. in jurisprudence in 1966. He then returned to the United States to attend the Yale Law School, graduating with an LL.B. cum laude in 1968. After graduating from law school, Epstein was hired as an assistant professor of law at the University of Southern California (USC). He taught at USC for four years before moving to the University of Chicago Law School in 1972. Epstein taught at Chicago for 38 years, eventually holding the title of James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Law. Epstein formally retired from Chicago in 2010, but quickly came out of retirement to join the faculty of New York University as its inaugural Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law. He remains a professor emeritus and senior lecturer at Chicago, teaching courses there on an occasional basis. In 2013, New York University's School of Law established a new academic research center, the Classical Liberal Institute, and named Epstein as its inaugural director. Since 2001, Epstein has served as the Peter and Kirsten Bedford Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, a prominent American public policy think tank located at Stanford University. Epstein has served in many academic and public organizations and has received a number of awards. In 1983, Epstein was made a senior fellow at the Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at the University of Chicago Medical School, and in 1985 was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.Richard A. Epstein, University of Chicago. He was editor of the Journal of Legal Studies from 1981 to 1991, and was editor of the Journal of Law and Economics from 1991 to 2001. In 2003, Epstein received an honorary LL.D. degree from the University of Ghent, and in 2018 received an honorary doctorate in law from the University of Siegen. In 2005 the College of William & Mary awarded him the Brigham- Kanner Property Rights Prize for his contributions to the field of property rights, In 2011, he was awarded a Bradley Prize by the Bradley Foundation.Recipients ‚Äì The Bradley Prizes Writings Epstein became famous in the American legal community in 1985 with Harvard University Press' publication of his book Takings: Private Property and the Power of Eminent Domain. In Takings, Epstein argued that the \\"takings clause\\" of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitutionwhich reads, \\"...nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation\\", and is traditionally viewed as a limit on the governmental power of eminent domaingives constitutional protection to citizens' economic rights, and so requires the government to be regarded the same as any other private entity in a property dispute. The argument was controversial and sparked a great deal of debate on the interpretation of the \\"takings clause\\" after its publication. In 1991, during Clarence Thomas' Supreme Court Justice confirmation hearings, Senator Joe Biden \\"in a dramatic movement\\" held the book up and \\"repeatedly interrogated\\" Thomas regarding his position on the book's thesis. The book served as a focal point in the argument about the government's ability to control private property.News release The book has also influenced how some courts view property rights and has been cited by the U.S. Supreme Court four times, including the 1992 case Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council. At the height of the HIV pandemic in 1988, Epstein argued that companies ought to be able to discriminate against ‚ÄúAIDS carriers‚Äù and that anti-discrimination laws were unfair to employers. In place of such laws, Epstein argued that ‚ÄúAIDS carriers‚Äù ought to have their health insurance premiums subsidized via taxation so as to ‚Äúdiscipline the behavior of government and interests groups, here by requiring citizens to make choices about how much they individually are prepared to pay to subsidize AIDS carriers.‚Äù Furthermore, he argued that ‚Äú[t]here is no reason to suppose that any public benefit obtained from having employers and their insurers care for AIDS victims will be at some level that matches the additional costs that are imposed.‚Äù Instead, Epstein proposed that employers have the right to refuse to hire suspected ‚ÄúAIDS carriers.‚Äù Epstein is an advocate of minimal legal regulation. In his book Simple Rules for a Complex World (1995), Epstein consolidated much of his previous work and argues that simple rules work best because complexities create excessive costs. Complexity comes from attempting to do justice in individual cases. Complex rules are justifiable, however, if they can be opted out of. For instance, drawing on Gary Becker, he argues that the Civil Rights Act and other anti-discrimination legislation would be better if they were repealed. Consistent with the principles of classical liberalism, he believes that the federal regulation on same-sex marriage, the Defense of Marriage Act, should be repealed, stating: : Under our law, only the state may issue marriage licenses. That power carries with it a duty to serve all-comers on equal terms, which means that the state should not be able to pick and choose those on whom it bestows its favors. DOMA offends this principle in two ways. First, it excludes polygamous couples from receiving these marital benefits. Second, it excludes gay couples. Both groups contribute to the funds that support these various government programs. Both should share in its benefits. He has criticized the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges. In 2007, Epstein defended the intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical companies against the cheaper, generic production of AIDS drugs, claiming that \\"disregarding property rights in the name of human rights reduces human welfare around the globe.\\" Contributing to the anthology Our American Story (2019), Epstein addressed the possibility of a shared American narrative. Taking a decidedly skeptical approach, Epstein concluded that no new national narrative can be achieved \\"unless we engage in what I call American minimalism‚Äîa conscious reduction of the issues that we think are truly best handled as a nation and not better address by smaller subnational groups: states, local governments, and, most importantly, all sorts of small private organizations that are free to choose as they please in setting their own membership and mission.\\" In March and April 2020, Epstein wrote several essays published by the Hoover Institution giving a contrarian account of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, and warning against extensive containment and mitigation measures by the US government, which he identified as an \\"overreaction\\". In a piece published on March 16, he argued that the term pandemic is not one to be used lightly and that the virus should be allowed to run its course, predicting there would ultimately be 500 US deaths. In early June the US death total passed 100,000 persons. On March 24, when the fatality number had already passed 500, Epstein added a \\"Correction & Addendum\\", in which he raised his forecast to 5000 deaths, without changing the underlying model that had led him to his first death count estimate. On April 6, when the death toll had already far surpassed his earlier predictions, he again revised that figure, with the \\"Correction & Addendum\\" section now suddenly declaring (under the wrong datestamp \\"March 24, 2020\\") that the \\"original erroneous estimate of 5,000 dead in the US [was] a number 10 times smaller than [he had] intended to state\\", implying that both 500 and 5,000 in the earlier article versions had been misspellings of 50,000. After several news reports about Epstein's ever- increasing estimates, on April 21 an editor's note appeared on the website, which explained the latest changes as an \\"editing error\\" and clarified, that the author's original prediction had been 500 deaths. Epstein compared COVID-19 to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, and suggested that public health measures \\"are done better at the level of plants, hotels, restaurants, and schools than remotely by political leaders.\\" He argued that ‚Äúthe response of the state governors to the coronavirus outbreak has become far more dangerous than the disease itself‚Äù, claiming that the number of deaths had been exaggerated.https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/richard-epstein- coronavirus-500-5000-deaths.html His essays, containing a number of factual errors and misconceptions about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, circulated in conservative circles and in the White House upon their publication. In an article published on June 6 Epstein praised Republican-governed states like Florida for their crisis management, linking the at that time higher fatalities numbers in Democratic-governed states to their \\"interventionist policies\\". Influence In 2006, the American scholar James W. Ely Jr. wrote: \\"It is a widely accepted premise that Professor Richard A. Epstein has exercised a pervasive influence on American legal thought.\\" A study published in The Journal of Legal Studies in 2000 identified Epstein as the 12th-most cited legal scholar of the entire 20th century. In 2008, he was chosen in a poll taken by Legal Affairs as one of the most influential legal thinkers of modern times. A study of legal publications between 2009 and 2013 found Epstein to be the 3rd most frequently cited American legal scholar, behind only Cass Sunstein and Erwin Chemerinsky.2014 Scholarly Impact ‚Äì Leitner Rankings. Politics Epstein has said that when voting, he chooses \\"anyone but the Big Two\\" who are \\"just two members of the same statist party fighting over whose friends will get favors\\". He has voted Libertarian. Epstein says he is \\"certainly a Calvin Coolidge fan; he made some mistakes, but he was a small-government guy\\". Epstein served on The Constitution Project's Guantanamo Task Force. In early 2015, Epstein commented on his relationship to the modern American political landscape, stating: \\"I'm in this very strange position: I'm not a conservative when it comes to religious values and so forth, but I do believe, in effect, in a strong foreign policy and a relatively small domestic government, but that's not the same thing as saying I believe in no government at all.\\"\\"Special Edition: Epstein and Levin on Progressivism, Classical Liberalism, and Conservatism\\", The Libertarian Podcast, Hoover Institution, February 4, 2015. He has also been characterized as a libertarian conservative. During a debate with Chris Preble in December 2016, Epstein identified himself as being a \\"libertarian hawk.\\"\\"US INvolvement in War.,\\" Dec. 12, 2016 Personal life Epstein's wife, Eileen W.

The weapon was developed specifically for the use of the Fallschirmj√§ger airborne infantry in 1942 and was used in very limited numbers until the end of the war. It combined the characteristics and firepower of a light machine gun in a lightweight form slightly shorter (but considerably bulkier and heavier) than the standard-issue Karabiner 98k bolt-action infantry rifle. Considered one of the most advanced weapon designs of World War II, the FG 42 influenced post-war small arms development, and many features of its design, such as general shape, stock style, gas-rotating bolt operation (itself copied from the Lewis gun) and sheet metal and plastic construction were copied by the US Army when they developed the M60 machine gun. History Fallschirmj√§ger poses with his early model FG 42 (Ausf√ºhrung \\"C\\") in France, 1944. raid to free Benito Mussolini in September 1943. At the time of the Battle of Crete (Operation Mercury), German Fallschirmj√§ger (parachute infantry) were equipped with the same assortment of small arms as the Heer, carrying only 9√ó19mm Parabellum chambered pistols and hand grenades on them during parachute jumps, with 9√ó19mm Parabellum submachine guns, 7.92√ó57mm Mauser chambered rifles and crew-served weapons stored separately in containers that were dropped from the wing of the exit craft. The German RZ parachute harness, with one single riser and two straps attached to the body, making the paratrooper land on his hands and knees in a forward roll, did not allow for heavier equipment such as rifles and machine guns to be safely carried during jumps. At Crete, long-range rifle and machine gun fire from dug-in Commonwealth defenders inflicted heavy casualties on the outgunned German paratroopers in the early stages of battle as they attempted to retrieve their support weapons from containers scattered all over the battlefield. These combat experiences demonstrated the need for a rifle that could be carried on the person of the paratrooper. The classifications of the development and production Ausf√ºhrungen (types) are as follows: * Type A - First design * Type B - Revised model prototype * Type C - \\"LC-6\\" prototype * Type D - First Fallschirmj√§gergewehr; acceptance trials * Type E - First production Fallschirmj√§gergewehr (sometimes called the Modell I (\\"Type I\\") * Type F - First stamped receiver Fallschirmj√§gergewehr (sometimes called the Modell II (\\"Type II\\") * Type G - Final production model Fallschirmj√§gergewehr (sometimes called the Modell III (\\"Type III\\") =Development= In 1941, the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) requested a selective-fire hand-held weapon for the paratroopers; Senior Staff Air Secretary Ossenbach at the GL/C Erprobungsstelle-6 (GL/C E-6‚Äîthe Luftwaffe Weapons Development Branch at Tarnewitz near Wismar) was approached informally to develop this special new weapon. The Reich Air Ministry (Reichsluftfahrtministerium or RLM) sought to develop a universal shoulder-fired automatic rifle that could replace the bolt-action rifle, submachine gun, and light machine gun in the air assault role. The proposed weapon would also simplify logistics and provide greater firepower to the individual paratrooper. The RLM attempted to initiate a formal weapons development program through the Heereswaffenamt (the HWaA, or Army Ordnance Department)‚Äîresponsible for German small arms development‚Äîbut conflicting priorities and friction with the Army (the HWaA dismissed the undertaking as unrealistic and offered their G 41(W) semi-automatic rifle instead) led to an independent development by the Luftwaffe. Plans were laid out to form a central authority for the new program at the Luftwaffe's Erprobungstelle coastal testing station at Tarnewitz. The engineers on staff had acquired considerable expertise developing lightweight automatic weapons, having successfully converted the MG 15 aircraft machine gun to a ground configuration.Dugelby, 4 However, due to the high casualties sustained by the paratroopers during Operation Mercury, Hitler changed his mind about the usefulness of airborne assaults and the plans were terminated. Nevertheless, Luftwaffe Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring privately ordered the continuation of the project. The RLM went directly to German industry with its plans‚Äîthe so- called LC-6 specification issued 14 December 1941 mentioned amongst others that the weapon should not exceed in length, should not be significantly heavier than the Karabiner 98k bolt action standard service rifle, should be able to fire single shots from a closed bolt, provide fully automatic fire from an open bolt, feed from detachable 10- or 20-round magazines and be able to fire rifle grenades. Despite the introduction of the 7.92√ó33mm Kurz intermediate cartridge promoted by the Heer (developed for the promising MP 43 assault rifle), the Luftwaffe favored the long-range potential of the 7.92√ó57mm Mauser full-power rifle cartridge and this chambering was one of the main design prerequisites. Prototypes Six manufacturers were solicited for prototype designs: Gustloff-Werke, Mauser, Johannes Gro√üfu√ü Metall- und Lackierwarenfabrik, C.G. H√§nel, Rheinmetall-Borsig and Heinrich Krieghoff Waffenfabrik. Several contracts were awarded but only a few prototypes are known to have been submitted. Mauser offered a version of the MG 81 (rejected due to excessive weight and its belt-fed operation)Dugelby, 5 while Krieghoff presented a rising-block prototype, which too was quickly dropped. A design credited to Rheinmetall-Borsig's Louis Stange of S√∂mmerda who had previously worked on the MG 34 proved satisfactory and underwent military trials conducted by the GL/C E-6 test station at Tarnewitz in mid-1942. This early prototype, known under the factory designation Ger√§t 450 (\\"device 450\\") or Ausf√ºhrung \\"A\\" (\\"type A\\"), was intended to be a pure sheet metal design, using pressed steel in the construction of the receiver, buttstock and corrugated handguard. The proposed system of operation was modeled on that used in World War I Lewis light machine gun, with a gas-operated turning bolt action geared to a spiral (clock-type) recoil spring.Dugelby, 8 The type \\"A\\" was never produced beyond model form, but the basic design layout was retained for further development.Dugelby, 9 With the basic characteristics of the LC-6 accepted, a series of modifications followed. The revised Ausf√ºhrung \\"B\\" replaced the sheet metal handguard with a resin-impregnated fiber type that provided protection against heat and a better grip when wet. These tests exposed several shortcomings, addressed by Stange in April 1942 with the LC-6/II prototype. The prototype was then submitted to a series of endurance tests led by the HWA and further modified to increase functional reliability and durability, resulting in the final LC-6/III prototype variant that was ultimately accepted into production as the FG 42. Fifty rifles were fabricated by Rheinmetall-Borsig for evaluation purposes by the end of 1942. A pre-series batch of 50 rifles was produced in early 1943 and 6 examples were sent to GL/C E-6 for additional testing. Almost identical to the LC-6/III, these guns differ from later models by using a smooth sheet metal buttstock and an experimental muzzle brake. The weapons experienced serious malfunctions: one rifle suffered a catastrophic failure after firing only 2,100 rounds, a soldier was injured when attempting to fire a rifle grenade and the pressed metal buttstock would deform after launching a small number of rifle grenades. =Production= Several other improvements were made before being authorized for large-scale production. The original Rheinmetall design used chrome-nickel steel heavily in many essential components, a strategic alloy in short supply. When the Luftwaffe was finally given permission to produce 3,000 rifles for combat trials, the material specifications were changed to accommodate the use of manganese steel as a substitute. The Heinrich Krieghoff company of Suhl (authors of the previous unsuccessful LC-6 tender) was contracted to manufacture the FG 42 in limited quantity as Rheinmetall did not have the capacity to bring the FG 42 into serial production. The weapon system underwent continuous development. Its expedited development, remedial changes to the original design and ever-changing Luftwaffe requirements resulted in a myriad of variants. Post-war literature typically identifies three versions, however the Germans did not give them separate designations; the Modell I, Modell II and Modell III were never officially referenced and period documents simply refer to the weapon as the 'Fallschirmj√§gergewehr 42' or \\"FG 42\\", and the reference was always made to the latest production model.Senich, 240 First operational use The weapon saw first operational use during the Gran Sasso raid (Unternehmen Eiche) in September 1943 when German paratroopers and Waffen-SS commandos rescued Italian dictator Benito Mussolini from his captors ‚Äì 200 well-equipped Carabinieri guards. However, during the whole airborne operation (which was personally ordered by Hitler) not a single shot was fired. =Deployment= A Fallschirmj√§ger firing the early FG 42 in June 1944 After approximately 2,000 FG 42s had been produced by Krieghoff, supplies of the manganese steel from which the receivers were forged were diverted to other needs; this meant a redesign was required to use stamped sheet metal in its place. Field reports that the lightweight rifle was not sturdy enough to handle full-power rifle ammunition in cyclic mode made Krieghoff engineers design the Type G. Improvements were: relocating the bipod from the front of the handguard to the muzzle to reduce shot dispersion; changing the pistol grip angle to near vertical; enlarging the handguard and changing the stock from stamped steel to wood to minimize overheating, adding weight to the bolt and lengthen its travel to reduce the cyclic rate of fire. Also a four position gas regulator was fitted, the bolt and recoil spring were changed to wound wire, a case deflector was fitted and the muzzle brake and the bayonet mount was changed. These changes, particularly the pistol grip change and the bipod relocation, are clearly visible on late-model FG 42s. Production models also had a simple flip-out spike bayonet under the barrel hidden by the bipod. In the later version the bayonet was shortened from around to around . There were never enough FG 42s to arm most Fallschirmj√§ger as originally intended, however most were employed in the western front following the events of D-Day, with the particular use of FG-42 during the Battle of Carentan and the Falaise Pocke (nearly a quarter of all FG-42 produced were in the hands of the 2nd Parachute Division). Design details FG 42 Ausf√ºhrung E, known informally as the \\"early model\\". Characteristic of the early models was the bipod placement (hinged to the barrel collar in front of the handguard), forged receiver, ribbed buttstock and the sharply angled pistol grip. Top to bottom: late-war FG 42, early-war FG 42 with folded down sight lines and StG 44 FG 42 grip (late war model) =General configuration/layout= The FG 42 was a select-fire air-cooled weapon and one of the first to incorporate the \\"straight-line\\" recoil configuration. This layout, combined with the side magazine, placed both the center of gravity and the position of the shoulder stock nearly in line with the longitudinal axis of the bore, a feature increasing controllability during burst or automatic fire. The operating system was derived from that used in the successful Lewis light machine gun with a gas piston-actuated rotating bolt locking mechanism. This system used pressurized exhaust gases from the bore and channeled them through a port drilled in the barrel into a gas cylinder located under the barrel. The rapid build-up of propellant gases imparted rearward pressure on a long-stroke piston, driving it backwards, while an extension of the bolt carrier interacted with a helical camming slot machined into the bolt carrier, converting this linear movement into an angular velocity and forcing the bolt into a rotary motion, clearing the locking nuts and unlocking it near the end of the bolt carrier's travel. The weapon was locked into battery by two lugs on the bolt head which recessed into appropriate cavities machined into the receiver walls. Owing to its main intended use by paratroopers, the rear sight (which necessarily was rather high due to the straight stock design) was a flip-up construction. The iron sight line had a sight radius and consisted of an open-pointed-post-type front sight, and a diopter-type rear sight. It was graduated for 7.92√ó57mm Mauser cartridges from in increments. On later models the post front sight was hooded to reduce glare under unfavourable light conditions and add protection for the post. The top of the receiver of the FG 42 was specifically machined with a long dovetail type base designed to accept telescopic sight mounts. The scope mounts featured locking lever(s) that allowed quick installation and removal of a telescopic sight depending on the specific combat scenario; general combat or in a limited sniping role. The telescopic sights used on the FG 42 were the ZFG42 or ZF4. =Receiver specifics and magazine feeding= The receiver was a sophisticated, machined alloy forging with the magazine housing placed on the left-hand side and the ejection port on the right. Whilst not a true bullpup rifle design the seemingly awkward placement of the magazine housing (horizontally to the side rather than directly beneath the receiver) allowed the bolt mechanism to extend into the buttstock assembly, effectively reducing the overall length of the weapon as the magazine well did not interfere with the location of the pistol grip. The pistol grip was integrated into the trigger group assembly, a separate housing containing the trigger mechanism and fire control components, and was formed from pressed sheet metal during fabrication from two separate halves and then welded together. The rifle fed from either a 10- or 20-round detachable box magazine or standard 5-round stripper clips into an empty magazine in the gun.WW2 GUNS - Deactivated, Replica and Model WW2 guns The empty weight of the long 10-round magazine is and of the long 20-round magazine . =Firing= The FG 42 fired in semi-automatic mode from a closed bolt, accomplished by delaying the release of the firing pin (mounted on the bolt carrier and released by the front sear notch) until after the trigger had been pressed; the short lock time, and little movement in the action during firing translated into greater single-shot accuracy. When operating in the automatic mode, the sear mechanism was designed to fire from an open bolt by simultaneously releasing both the bolt and bolt carrier; and with this mode selected, the bolt would remain open between bursts to provide maximum cooling. This had the advantage of preventing a phenomenon known as \\"cook off\\" where the heat of repeated rounds being fired caused a chambered round to overheat and prematurely ignite the powder or primer. The rotating fire selector switch was situated in the trigger group, above the pistol grip on the right side. The charge lever also served as the safety, disabling the sear mechanism when engaged. =Testing= The FG 42 was intended to fill a niche in Nazi Germany's arsenal and was produced only in small numbers. It was somewhat well received by paratroopers when tested, but it did have its drawbacks. The FG 42 had a 20-round, or sometimes 10 round, magazine that was mounted on the left side of the rifle. Though a side-mounted magazine was common in submachine guns of the time, the larger magazine with heavier ammunition of a full-powered rifle tended to unbalance the weapon. In addition controllable bursts were difficult. This made full-automatic fire only marginally useful. The FG 42 used a fairly sophisticated muzzle device that did help with recoil and muzzle flash, but made blast and noise much greater than on other similar weapons. The US M14 rifle had similar problems, and attempts were made to upgrade that rifle the same way with an in-line stock and muzzle device. Influences/derivatives US experimental T-44 belt- feeding machine gun developed from the German FG 42 and MG 42 The American M41 Johnson LMG has many parallels with the contemporary FG 42. Both had in-line stocks, fed from the left side, and both fired from the open bolt in automatic mode and closed bolt in semi-automatic mode. Despite these similarities, there is no evidence that either weapon had any effect on the design of the other. As they were both seeking to solve similar problems, it is reasonable to expect that each weapon's respective engineers approached these problems similarly but independently, unaware of the developments of their counterparts. It is not easy to determine the significance of the FG 42 in terms of weapons history. With a slightly longer barrel and belt-feeding the weapon would have been an excellent light machine gun. Its designer Louis Stange knew that, he also built a prototype with belt feed. Some features, such as the details of the gas-operated bolt selection process, were studied by US Army engineers after the war. These, along with some aspects of the MG 42 general-purpose machine gun, are commonly reported to have been incorporated in the similarly troubled M60 general-purpose machine gun. The last known derivatives of the FG 42 were the Swiss Sturmgewehr 52 and M60 machine gun. Users *: Trial purposes only.Julio S.

The theorem is as follows. Suppose that is a family of distinct subsets of \\\\\\\\{1,2,...,n\\\\\\\\} such that each subset is of size and each pair of subsets has a nonempty intersection, and suppose that . Then the number of sets in is less than or equal to the binomial coefficient :\\\\binom{n-1}{r-1}. The result is part of the theory of hypergraphs. A family of sets may also be called a hypergraph, and when all the sets (which are called \\"hyperedges\\" in this context) are the same size size , it is called an -uniform hypergraph. The theorem thus gives an upper bound for the number of pairwise non-disjoint hyperedges in an -uniform hypergraph with vertices and . The theorem may also be formulated in terms of graph theory: the independence number of the Kneser graph for is : \\\\alpha(KG_{n,r})=\\\\binom{n-1}{r-1}. According to the theorem was proved in 1938, but was not published until 1961 in an apparently more general form. The subsets in question were only required to be size at most , and with the additional requirement that no subset be contained in any other. A version of the theorem also holds for signed sets Proof The original proof of 1961 used induction on n. In 1972, Gyula O. H. Katona gave the following short proof using double counting. Suppose we have some such family of subsets A. Arrange the elements of {1, 2, ..., n} in any cyclic order, and consider the sets from A that form intervals of length r within this cyclic order. For example if n = 8 and r = 3, we could arrange the numbers {1, 2, ..., 8} into the cyclic order (3,1,5,4,2,7,6,8), which has eight intervals: :(3,1,5), (1,5,4), (5,4,2), (4,2,7), (2,7,6), (7,6,8), (6,8,3), and (8,3,1). However, it is not possible for all of the intervals of the cyclic order to belong to A, because some pairs of them are disjoint. Katona's key observation is that at most r of the intervals for a single cyclic order may belong to A. To see this, note that if (a1, a2, ..., ar) is one of these intervals in A, then every other interval of the same cyclic order that belongs to A separates ai and ai+1 for some i (that is, it contains precisely one of these two elements). The two intervals that separate these elements are disjoint, so at most one of them can belong to A. Thus, the number of intervals in A is one plus the number of separated pairs, which is at most (r - 1). Based on this idea, we may count the number of pairs (S,C), where S is a set in A and C is a cyclic order for which S is an interval, in two ways. First, for each set S one may generate C by choosing one of r! permutations of S and (n ‚àí r)! permutations of the remaining elements, showing that the number of pairs is Ar!(n ‚àí r)!. And second, there are (n ‚àí 1)! cyclic orders, each of which has at most r intervals of A, so the number of pairs is at most r(n ‚àí 1)!. Combining these two counts gives the inequality :Ar!(n-r)!\\\\le r(n-1)! and dividing both sides by r!(n ‚àí r)! gives the result :A\\\\le \\\\frac{r(n-1)!}{r!(n-r)!}={n-1\\\\choose r-1}. Two constructions for an intersecting family of r-sets: fix one element and choose the remaining elements in all possible ways, or (when n = 2r) exclude one element and choose all subsets of the remaining elements. Here n = 4 and r = 2\\\\. Families of maximum size There are two different and straightforward constructions for an intersecting family of r-element sets achieving the Erd≈ës‚ÄìKo‚ÄìRado bound on cardinality. First, choose any fixed element x, and let A consist of all r-subsets of \\\\\\\\{1,2,...,n\\\\\\\\} that include x. For instance, if n = 4, r = 2, and x = 1, this produces the family of three 2-sets :{1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}. Any two sets in this family intersect, because they both include x. Second, when n = 2r and with x as above, let A consist of all r-subsets of \\\\\\\\{1,2,...,n\\\\\\\\} that do not include x. For the same parameters as above, this produces the family :{2,3}, {2,4}, {3,4}. Any two sets in this family have a total of 2r = n elements among them, chosen from the n ‚àí 1 elements that are unequal to x, so by the pigeonhole principle they must have an element in common. When n > 2r, families of the first type (variously known as sunflowers, stars, dictatorships, centred families, principal families) are the unique maximum families. proved that in this case, a family which is almost of maximum size has an element which is common to almost all of its sets. This property is known as stability. The seven points and seven lines (one drawn as a circle) of the Fano plane form a maximal intersecting family. Maximal intersecting families An intersecting family of r-element sets may be maximal, in that no further set can be added without destroying the intersection property, but not of maximum size. An example with n = 7 and r = 3 is the set of 7 lines of the Fano plane, much less than the Erd≈ës‚ÄìKo‚ÄìRado bound of 15.  Intersecting families of subspaces  There is a q-analog of the Erd≈ës‚ÄìKo‚ÄìRado theorem for intersecting families of subspaces over finite fields. If S is an intersecting family of k-dimensional subspaces of an n-dimensional vector space over a finite field of order q, and n \\\\geq 2k, then :\\\\vert S \\\\vert \\\\leq \\\\binom{n-1}{k-1}_q.  Relation to graphs in association schemes  The Erd≈ës‚ÄìKo‚ÄìRado theorem gives a bound on the maximum size of an independent set in Kneser graphs contained in Johnson schemes. Similarly, the analog of the Erd≈ës‚ÄìKo‚ÄìRado theorem for intersecting families of subspaces over finite fields gives a bound on the maximum size of an independent set in q-Kneser graphs contained in Grassmann schemes.

Originally a total conversion of id Software's Quake III Arena, FrozenSand released Urban Terror as a free standalone game in 2007 utilizing ioquake3 as the game engine.Urban Terror: News Retrieved 2009-09-16 While the game engine is licensed under the open-source GPL, Urban Terror's game code is closed source and its assets are freeware but not open content.  History  Urban Terror started out in 1998 as a planned map pack for Quake III Arena, in which real world environments would be featured. It expanded from this idea to a full total conversion featuring realistic weapons and gameplay similar to Action Quake 2. Development group Silicon Ice Development was formed in spring 2000 and was made of several international developers, many whom were familiar with modifying Quake III Engine games; hence progress was made quickly. When its first version, beta 1.0, was released at QuakeCon 2000, Urban Terror was the realism mod with the most features and graphics completed. Frozensand began development on Urban Terror HD in 2009 and was set to release an alpha version in 2010 but soon abandoned the project and switched engines from idtech3 to Unreal Engine 4 due to licensing complications of idtech3. The most recent version, 4.3.4, was released on June 21, 2018.  Gameplay  Urban Terror is billed by FrozenSand as a \\"Hollywood tactical shooter.\\" It blends elements from games such as Quake III Arena, Unreal Tournament and Counter-Strike. The realism in the mod is introduced through a number of changes: The number of weapons and other gear that can be carried is limited. Damage is also more realistic than in Quake III Arena, based on dividing the player target into discrete areas. Numerous game modes are featured, including classic first-person shooter modes such as Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and Last Man Standing. Additionally, Urban Terror has a nonviolent \\"jump mode,\\" in which players utilize the game's unique mechanics to progress through movement-based \\"jump maps\\" of varying difficulties.

Quoridor received the Mensa Mind Game award in 1997 and the Game Of The Year in the USA, France, Canada and Belgium. Rules of the game The starting position for a 4-player game. In a 2 player game, green and orange are omitted. The wall A is legal. Wall B is illegal because it does not face two spaces on each side. Quoridor is played on a game board of 81 square spaces (9x9). Each player is represented by a pawn which begins at the center space of one edge of the board (in a two-player game, the pawns begin opposite each other). The objective is to be the first player to move their pawn to any space on the opposite side of the gameboard from which it begins. The distinguishing characteristic of Quoridor is its twenty walls. Walls are flat two-space-wide pieces which can be placed in the groove that runs between the spaces. Walls block the path of all pawns, which must go around them. The walls are divided equally among the players at the start of the game, and once placed, cannot be moved or removed. On a turn, a player may either move their pawn, or, if possible, place a wall. Pawns can be moved to any space at a right angle (but not diagonally). If adjacent to another pawn, the pawn may jump over that pawn. If an adjacent pawn has a third pawn or a wall on the other side of it, the player may move to either space that is immediately adjacent (left or right) to the first pawn. Multiple pawns may not be jumped. Walls may not be jumped, including when moving laterally due to a pawn or wall being behind a jumped pawn. Walls can be placed directly between two spaces, in any groove not already occupied by a wall. However, a wall may not be placed which cuts off the only remaining path of any pawn to the side of the board it must reach. History Quoridor is also based on an earlier game invented by Philip Slater, Blockade, in 1975. Marchesi also created another version of this game, called Pinko Pallino, which was published in 1995 by Epta. Pinko Pallino was only for two players and was played on an 11√ó11 game board with a total of 42 walls and slightly different rules. Notation Although there is no official notation, Lisa Glendenning's thesis proposes a reasonable notation. The notation proposed is similar to algebraic chess notation. Each square gets a unique letter-number designation. Columns are labeled a through i from player 1's left and rows are numbered 1 through 9 from player 2's side to player 1's side. A move is recorded as the column followed by the row as in e8. Player 1's pawn starts on e9 and player 2's pawn starts on e1. Each pawn move is defined by the new square occupied by the pawn. For example, if player 1 moves from square e9 to e8, player 1‚Äôs move is e8. Each fence move is defined by the square directly to the northwest of the wall center from player 1's perspective, as well as an orientation designation. For example: a vertical wall between columns e and f and spanning rows 3 and 4 would be given the designation e3v. Games are notated as they are in chess: by the move number, player 1's move, and player 2's move. For example, a game might start with each player moving their pawn towards the goal: 1\\\\. e8 e2 2\\\\. e7 e3 And then the players might add walls to lengthen the other player's path: 3\\\\. e3h e6h and so forth. Strategies *Reed opening: This opening consists in placing, during the first two moves of the game, two walls on the third row in front of the opponent with a single gap in the middle (c3h and f3h). This opening is attributed to Dr. Scott Reed (Edinburgh, UK), a known military strategist and frequent player. A counter-strategy to the Reed opening is to place two horizontal walls on the third row, one at the extreme left and one at the extreme right, which effectively reduces both players' path counts to one. The game would start as follows: 1. c3h a3h 2. f3h h3h *Shiller opening: Both players advance their pawns three times (1. e8 e2 2. e7 e3 3. e6 e4). This opening is attributed to Larry Shiller, who is also known as the Voice of Backgammon. Then the first player places one wall vertically in the column closest to him (c7v, d7v, e7v, or f7v), providing two paths for the other player while maintaining just one path for herself. The Shiller opening implements the strategy of maximizing the opponent's path count and of minimizing one's own path count.

The company produces a range of electric guitars that includes hollow-body models. History Heritage Guitars was founded in 1985 by three former employees of the Gibson guitar factory, Jim Deurloo, Marv Lamb, and JP Moats. Other former Gibson employees that took part of the recently created company were Bill Paige and Mike Korpak. In the early 1980s, Gibson, faced with excess production capacity, closed its historic Parsons Street factory in Kalamazoo, Michigan and relocated much of its production to its factory in Nashville, Tennessee. Some of the Gibson employees who did not want to move their homes and families to Tennessee started production of guitars under a new name, \\"Heritage,\\" which was likely meant to stake a claim to their guitar-making tradition. The company set up their new factory in part of Gibson's former Kalamazoo premises, but produced instruments in much smaller numbers than Gibson had. The Heritage line initially consisted of electric and acoustic guitars, electric basses, mandolins, and a banjo. The line was eventually narrowed to electric guitars only. Although most Heritage guitars were, and continue to be, based on Gibson designs, a few of their early electric guitars were based on modified Stratocaster and Telecaster designs.  Current status  Heritage is a boutique manufacturer, making semi-hollow guitars, large jazz boxes, and solid body electrics. In these types of guitars, Gibson guitars are the closest nominal equivalents, though Heritage is a much smaller company making far fewer guitars. In general, Heritage makes guitars that are similar to Gibson's products, which the company's advocates and fans would say are constructed in a much more \\"hand- made\\" fashion, and with much greater individual attention to detail by the builders. Part of this increased attention to detail is a result of Heritage being a smaller operation than Gibson, and some of it is likely a reaction against the cost-cutting practices that developed at Gibson under Norlin's ownership. The design of the Heritage H-150 solid-body guitar is clearly modeled on the Les Paul Standard, while the H-575 resembles the ES-175 and the H-535 reinterprets the ES-335. There are differences between most of the Heritage models and their Gibson counterparts, however. For example, all Heritage full-body semi-acoustics have solid wood tops, while many of the Gibson guitars of this type had laminated tops after World War II. Both the H-575 and the H-535 are thinner than their Gibson cousins. Heritage has also introduced several new designs, most notably the Millennium models, which employ a \\"semi-solid\\" body that is more solid than a traditional semi-hollow design, but chambered, and thus less solid than a typical solid body. Heritage guitars are made without the use of CNC machines for woodworking, utilizing a crude carver machine built by the original employees. Heritage is clear about the fact that their guitars are manufactured with no claims that they are handmade (although the website states \\"The art of handcrafting fine American made instruments continues...\\"). Such claims tend to arise from the company's fans and advocates, who are a small, but enthusiastic and loyal bunch. During the first several years of the company, Heritage advertised its guitars in the usual guitar magazines. The marketing was handled by the former VP of sales from Gibson, Lane Zastrow. The advertisements made it clear that Heritage was making guitars on Parsons Street in Kalamazoo, without ever mentioning Gibson by name, and the company began to develop an image as the alternative to Gibson at a time when Gibson was going through a period of transition and rebuilding. In the 1990s, in an attempt to keep costs down, the company all but stopped advertising. This lack of an advertising presence significantly diminished the brand's name recognition among guitarists. (See also ) Endorsers =Johnny Smith= In 1989, jazz guitarist Johnny Smith withdrew his endorsement from Gibson and awarded it to Heritage, which began production of the \\"Heritage Johnny Smith\\". The Gibson model continued in production as the \\"Gibson LeGrand\\". Smith had since moved his endorsement from Heritage to the Guild Guitar Company. =Henry Johnson= Jazz guitarist, producer, and composer Henry Johnson, was the second endorser of Heritage Guitars, beginning in 1985. In 1986, Johnson's first solo recording came out on Impulse/MCA records and was met with popular acclaim, including a Grammy nomination. Johnson's recordings were popular throughout the 1990s, which raised the visibility of Heritage Guitars into the mainstream forefront of TV, music magazines, and news publications. Because of a court order, Heritage was unable to talk about themselves or tell anyone of their true identities. Because Johnson did a large number of interviews and TV shows, he was able to promote Heritage Guitars more than other artists who were endorsing them. Business flourished after Johnson revealed the identities of the luthiers behind Heritage Guitars. Johnson has been an endorser for almost 30 years, and his Heritage Signature model has been in production since 2008. =Alex Skolnick= Guitarist Alex Skolnick, of the band Testament, formerly endorsed Heritage Guitars. He is known for his jazz-oriented playing. For jazz, Skolnick played an H-575, and for rock he played an H-150. For a short time, the Heritage Guitar company offered an \\"Alex Skolnick signature model H-150\\". In 2013 Skolnick announced his endorsement of ESP Guitars. Skolnick is now an endorser of Godin Jazz guitars. =David Becker= Jazz guitarist, composer and two time Grammy nominee, David Becker, has been endorsing Heritage Guitars for more than 30 years. He was one of the first artists to join Heritage in 1988. The \\"David Becker H-575 Signature Model\\" features a solid spruce top, maple sides and back and a humbucker and piezo pickup. =Roy Clark= Country musician Roy Clark endorsed Heritage guitars, which makes a signature model. =Mimi Fox= Jazz guitarist Mimi Fox's guitars are a \\"Golden Eagle\\" and H-575 custom with a spruce top. =Kenny Burrell= American jazz guitarist Kenny Burrell plays a \\"Heritage Super KB\\" hollow body through a \\"Heritage 1 x 12 Kenny Burrell\\" combo amp.

His brother Michiel also became a painter but no works of him are known.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, pp. 1132‚Äì1133 Wild boar hunt Snyders was recorded as a student of Pieter Brueghel the Younger in 1593, and subsequently trained with Hendrick van Balen, who was the first master of Anthony van Dyck. Snyders became a master of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1602. He travelled to Italy in 1608-9 where he first resided in Rome. The artist subsequently traveled from Rome to Milan. Jan Brueghel the Elder had introduced him there by letter to the famous art collector Cardinal Borromeo. Brueghel asked Snyders to paint a copy after a portrait by Titian in the Borromeo collection. This is regarded as evidence that Snyders was a skilled figure painter before he turned his attention to still life painting.Frans Snyders, The game dealer at Christie‚Äôs Snyders had returned to Antwerp in the spring of 1609. In 1611 he married Margaretha, the sister of Cornelis de Vos and Paul de Vos, two leading painters in Antwerp. His collaboration with Rubens started in the 1610s. Snyders had many patrons including the Ghent Bishop Antonius Triest who commissioned four paintings of market scenes around 1615 (Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg). He was a friend of van Dyck who painted Snyders and his wife more than once (Frick Collection, Kassel etc.). Snyders was commercially successful and was able to purchase a house on the high-end Keizerstraat in Antwerp. In 1628 he became the dean of the Guild of Saint Luke. A greyhound catching a young wild boar In the period 1636-1638 he was one of the Antwerp artists who assisted Rubens in a large commission for decorations for the hunting pavilion Torre de la Parada of Philip IV of Spain. The two artists also worked together on decorations for the Royal Alcazar of Madrid and the royal Buen Retiro Palace in Madrid.Anne T. Woollett, Ariane van Suchtelen, et al., Rubens & Brueghel: A Working Friendship, Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum, 2006. Snyders painted about 60 hunting paintings and animal pieces after designs by Rubens. In 1639 Rubens and Snyders received a follow-up commission for an additional 18 paintings for the hunting pavilion. After Peter Paul Rubens' death Snyders acted as one of the appraisers of the inventory of Rubens' collection. In the years 1641 and 1642 Snyders traveled with other artists to the Dutch Republic. In 1646 Snyders was probably in Breda working on a commission. Snyders became a widower in 1647. He died himself on 19 August 1657 in Antwerp. He died childless and bequeathed his fortune to his sister, a beguine. The Antwerp art dealer Matthijs Musson acquired his extensive art collection which included works of leading 16th and 17th century Flemish and Dutch artists such as Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Hendrick van Balen, Jan Breughel the Elder, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Joos van Cleve, Coninxloo, Jacob Foppens van Es, Willem Claeszoon Heda, Jacob Jordaens, Lucas van Leyden, Jan Lievens, Lambert Lombard, Jan Massys, Joachim Patinir, Adriaen van Utrecht and Frans Ykens.Frans Snyders at Sphinx Fine Arts Kitchen still life He had many apprentices. His pupils are believed to have included Nicasius Bernaerts, Peter van Boucle, Juriaen Jacobsze, Jan Roos and Paul de Vos. Jan Fyt (Joannes Fijt) was a student, and then assistant of Snyders from 1629.Frans Snijders at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Peter van Boucle claimed that he was a pupil of Frans Snyders but there are no written sources available in Antwerp that support this contention. However, there are stylistic similarities in van Boucle's works which suggest that he worked in the circle of Frans Snyders.Peter van Boucle at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Work =General= Snyders initially devoted himself to painting flowers, fruit and still lifes. Later he turned to painting animals. He was particularly interested in depicting wild animals, which he showed engaged in lively hunts and fierce combats. He was one of the earliest specialist animaliers. His work as an animal painter was very influential on his contemporaries as well as on 18th-century French animaliers such as Jean- Baptiste Oudry and Fran√ßois Desportes. Jean-Baptiste-Sim√©on Chardin's masterpiece The Ray recalls Snyders' pictorial strength.Two Monkeys Stealing Fruit from a Basket at the Louvre Market scene on a quay His residence in Italy is believed to have had an important influence on his style of fruit painting. He is likely to have seen Caravaggio's Basket of Fruit in Cardinal Borremeo's collection in Milan. =Market and pantry scenes= He painted many market scenes and his earliest work in this area was inspired by the work of Pieter Aertsen and Joachim Beuckelaer who had pioneered and developed the genre in 16th century Antwerp. Whereas Aertsen and Beuckelaer often included a religious scene in the background of their market pieces, Snyders dispensed with this. Initially he worked in a Mannerist idiom. His style gradually matured as a result of his exposure to Italian art during his trip to Italy and the work of Rubens after his return to Antwerp. As a result the dark surroundings of his early still lifes disappeared after 1614 and he became a fine colourist with strong compositional skills allowing him to structure a profusion of disparate objects. Cook at a Kitchen Table with Dead Game He not only created many large market and pantry scenes and game still lifes, usually including dead deer. He also painted smaller works which were reminiscent of the breakfast pieces and still lifes that originated in northern art around 1600. Rather than continue the descriptive manner of the Antwerp painter Osias Beert, Snyders' innovative still lifes combined objects in groups to form a geometrically structured composition. Recurring motifs were dead hares and birds, tazze (shallow dishes on a tall foot), baskets with grapes and other fruit, enamelled pitchers and Chinese Kraak porcelain. Snyders typically depicted game in the stage before it is prepared as food. These dead animals therefore resemble hunting trophies, which were often not even intended as food but rather for stuffing. Snyders often included live animals such as cats to create a contrast between the animate and inanimate elements.Norbert Schneider, Still Life, Taschen, 2003 Snyders' large game pieces were very influential and the Dutch painter Jan Davidsz. de Heem, who worked in Antwerp for a significant period of time took inspiration from Snyders' work to develop his own large-scale game pieces.Sheila D. Muller, Dutch Art: An Encyclopedia, Routledge, 2013, p. 366 The large and abundant still lifes of Snyders have been interpreted in many ways. Some read a propagandistic message into these paintings. The display of the luxurious abundance available in Antwerp which was at the time under Spanish administration possibly served the propagandistic purpose of showing the superiority of Spanish rule over Flanders when compared with Protestant control over the rebellious Northern Netherlands.Frans Snyders and Workshop, Market Scene on a Quay at artnc.org While in the Baroque tradition many of his compositions are complex and dynamic some are more focused and quiet. An example of the latter is the Grapes, Peaches and Quinces in a Niche (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), where his brushwork is also more sketchy than usual.Peaches and Quinces in a Niche at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston =Collaborations= Prometheus Bound, a collaboration with Rubens Snyders is believed to have been a skilled figure painter in his own right as is evidenced by Jan Breughel the Elder‚Äôs request that he make a copy after a Titian portrait in the Borromeo collection during his stay in Milan. Even so he still often collaborated with figure artists such as Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, his brother-in-law Cornelis de Vos, Theodoor van Thulden and Jan Boeckhorst, who painted the figures in compositions to which he added the still life elements. He also collaborated with landscape specialists such as Jan Wildens, who provided the landscape setting for his hunting scenes. Collaborations with Rubens were particularly frequent. Snyders' expressiveness and ability to render different textures of furs and skins excited the admiration of Rubens. Rubens frequently employed him to paint animals, fruit and still life in his own pictures. Snyders developed a particularly close collaborative relationship with Rubens between 1610 and 1640. Their collaborative efforts are well documented. In the early period of their collaboration, Rubens would paint an oil sketch of the complete composition and mark out clearly where Snyders would have to put his contribution. This has been documented for the painting The recognition of Philopoemen. It is possible that in this early period Rubens was not sure about Snyders' compositional skills and wanted to show him the way. In the later Prometheus bound the process was reversed and Snyders made a sketch leaving the space for the figure by Rubens.Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012, p. 53 The recognition of Philopoemen is considered the first Baroque still life with figures.Hella Robels. \\"Snyders, Frans.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 20 July 2015 A famous collaboration between Rubens and Snyders is the Medusa (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). Painted around 1613-1617/1618, this small- scale work showed that Snyders' manner was not only well suited to Rubens' large pieces, but also adaptable to his smaller-scale works.Susan Koslow, How looked the Gorgon then . . . The Science and Poetics of 'The Head of Medusa' by Rubens and Snyders, in: Shop Talk: Studies in Honor of Seymour Slive, Cambridge, Mass., 1995, pp. 147‚Äì149 Rubens relied on Snyders to create the visual richness that went hand in hand with his Baroque style, which stressed abundance and bounteousness. The two artists' brushwork was so close that contemporaries had difficulty distinguishing their contributions in collaborative works. Medusa His pupil and brother-in-law Paul de Vos was also a regular collaborator with Rubens. One art historian has compared Paul de Vos' contributions to Rubens' hunting scenes with those of Frans Snyders' and found de Vos to be less accurate in the animal anatomy and less accomplished in the psychological expression of the animals. Other art historians regard the hunting scenes of de Vos as more dynamic and evidencing a more personal style when compared with those of Snyders, who was more a still life painter. The expressive style and motifs of Rubens' animal paintings had an important influence on both Snyders and de Vos.Arnout Balis, Rubens' hunting scenes, Part 18, Harvey Miller, 5 Mar 1987, pp. 70‚Äì87 Snyders also painted the still life elements for other Antwerp painters such as Jacob Jordaens, Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert, Jan Janssens and other artists. Frans Snyders collaborated with his second brother-in-law Cornelis de Vos. An example is the Still life with fruit and vegetables, which likely represents a larder of a fine house. The impression given by this composition is one of abundance as well as chaos. Closer inspection shows that the produce is arranged in a hierarchy reflecting their value and rarity. Cheaper root vegetables are on the ground while highly prized peas and asparagus are placed in the basket on the right.Frans Snyders, Still Life with Fruit and Vegetables, 1625-35 at the Norton Simon Museum =Animalier= Snyders was the first artist to concentrate on incidents exclusively featuring animals in everyday environments. In these creations animals such as dogs, cats and monkeys were the sole protagonists. The scenes included fights between animals, hunts by animals, scenes from fables and symbolic representations.J. J, P√©rez Preciado, Frans Snyders, in: Enciclopedia online del Museo del Prado (2006) Concert of Birds One of the symbolic representations that Snyders created and to which he returned regularly is the concert of birds. Compositions on this theme represent different species of birds perched on tree trunks in the form of a concert of birds, sometimes with a musical score. The theme of the concert of birds predates the courtly fashion of the Baroque period of maintaining aviaries. Concert of Birds The theme has its roots in the representations of Aeolus with birds in the Middle Ages, which became very popular at the end of the 16th century. Its symbolic meaning is linked to the representation of the birds of Saint Francis of Assisi and to the devotion to Our Lady of the Birds. According to legend, in the 13th century a flock of birds had been observed gathering near a grove of beech trees outside Brussels. They had been attracted to that location by an image of the Virgin clamped between the branches of the trees. A Franciscan chapel dedicated to the Virgin was then built. It was destroyed during the iconoclastic fury of the Beeldenstorm in the 16th century but reconstructed at the end of the century. A particular feature of the chapel were the bird cages that were suspended from the ceiling. The birds in the cages contributed their song to the liturgy in the chapel. Snyders is said to have had a special relationship with the Franciscan order and he wanted to be buried in the Franciscan habit. In addition to this religious connotation, the concert of birds is also regarded as an allegory of the sense of hearing. Other interpretations are that the concert represents Wisdom, as the owl, which is the animal representing this quality, is sometimes depicted as the conductor of the bird concerts. A further interpretation is that the concert of birds symbolically alludes to harmony and natural regulation, in the sense of balance with nature. These concepts are embodied in the systematization of the birds' song. So, more generally, the concert of birds imagery refers to the political harmony and social order enjoyed by the owners of these paintings during the time the Southern Netherlands were governed by the Archdukes of Austria Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia. This explains the success of the concert of birds paintings in bourgeois and aristocratic circles. Various followers of Snyders also painted this theme: in the Spanish Netherlands there were Paul de Vos, Jan Fyt and Jan van Kessel the Elder; in the Dutch Republic, Gijsbert d'Hondecoeter, his son Melchior d'Hondecoeter, Abraham Busschop and Jacobus Victors reworked the subject by making it more courtly; and in France the Flemish expatriates Nicasius Bernaerts or Pieter Boel also created compositions on the theme. Still life with fruit, dead game, vegetables, a monkey, squirrel and cat One of the four Concert of Birds pictures by Frans Snyders in the Prado Museum shows an owl on a branch. The owl conducts the other 15 species of birds shown in the composition while it holds a musical score between its legs. As in many of Snyders' compositions, the larger birds are placed near the border and protect the smaller birds in the middle. Some exotic species alien to European are included such as the Raggiana bird-of-paradise. Some fragments of the score are visible and show the titles of the voices, which are written in French. The composer and the work have not been identified. It seems a composition for four voices and is possibly a French song. Monkey business His compositions with monkeys wreaking havock in a pantry became very popular. The Louvre collection holds two monkey-themed paintings. They show two capuchin monkeys in a pantry pillaging a basket of fruit and toppling dishes. The monkeys are painted with naturalism, neither idealizing nor caricaturing them. While the monkey had since the Middle Ages symbolized the sinner - a greedy, lecherous creature, driven by its senses only ‚Äì during the 16th and 17th centuries it became the symbol of stupidity. Through their uncontrolled grabbing and consuming of food the monkeys show their barbaric nature which is driven solely by animal instinct and desire. The Louvre compositions with capuchin monks can also be interpreted as a form of vanitas paintings: the fruit in these still lifes is appetizing yet bound to perish. The fruit thus symbolizes the brevity and futility of life. The compositions can further be regarded as illustrations of the risk of poor household management which is driven solely by the satisfaction of the senses.

Background Lunacharsky was born on 23 or 24 November 1875 in Poltava, Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire) as the illegitimate child of Alexander Antonov and Alexandra Lunacharskaya, n√©e Rostovtseva. His mother was then married to statesman Vasily Lunacharsky, whence Anatoly's surname and patronym. She later divorced Vasily Lunacharsky and married Antonov, but Anatoly kept his former name. In 1890, at the age of 15, Lunacharsky became a Marxist. From 1894, he studied at the University of Zurich under Richard Avenarius for two years without taking a degree. In Z√ºrich, he met European socialists including Rosa Luxemburg and Leo Jogiches and joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. Career In 1896, Luncharsky returned to Russia, where he was arrested and sent to Kaluga in Siberia through 1901‚Äì1902, when he returned to Kiev. In February 1902, he moved in with Alexander Bogdanov, who was working in a mental hospital in Vologda, Russia. = Vpered = In 1903, the party split into Bolsheviks led by Vladimir Lenin and Mensheviks led by Julius Martov; in his memoirs, Lunacharsky recalls having sought to understand the causes of the split, although he ultimately came to represent the Bolsheviks in Paris. In 1907, he attended the International Socialist Congress, held in Stuttgart. When the Bolsheviks in turn split into Lenin's supporters and Alexander Bogdanov's followers in 1908, Lunacharsky supported his brother-in-law Bogdanov in setting up Vpered. Like many contemporary socialists (including Bogdanov), Lunacharsky was influenced by the empirio-criticism philosophy of Ernst Mach and Avenarius. Lenin opposed Machism as a form of subjective idealism and strongly criticised its proponents in his book Materialism and Empirio-criticism (1908). In 1909, Lunacharsky joined Bogdanov and Gorky at the latter's villa on the island of Capri, where they started a school for Russian socialist workers. In 1910, Bogdanov, Lunacharsky, Mikhail Pokrovsky and their supporters moved the school to Bologna, where they continued teaching classes through 1911. In 1913, Lunacharsky moved to Paris, where he started his own Circle of Proletarian Culture. =World War I= After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Lunacharsky adopted an internationalist antiwar position which put him on a course of convergence with Lenin and Leon Trotsky. In 1915, Lunacharsky and Pavel Lebedev-Poliansky restarted the social democratic newspaper Vpered with an emphasis on proletarian culture.Bernice Glatzer Rosenthal, New Myth, New World: From Nietzsche to Stalinism, Pennsylvania State University, 2002, p.85 After the February Revolution of 1917, Lunacharsky left his family in Switzerland and returned to Russia. Like other internationalist social democrats returning from abroad, he briefly joined the Mezhraiontsy before they merged with the Bolsheviks in July‚ÄìAugust 1917. In July 1917, the Kerensky government jailed him. =People's Commissariat for Education (Narkompros)= After the October Revolution of 1917, Lunacharsky was appointed head of the People's Commissariat for Education (Narkompros) in the first Soviet government and remained in that position until 1929. In 1921, The New York Times reported his resignation. Lunacharsky, People's Commissar for Education on 13 Congress of Soviets of the RSFSR, April 1927 Lunacharsky was associated with the establishment of the Bolshoi Drama Theater in 1919, working with Maxim Gorky, Alexander Blok and Maria Andreyeva. He was also in charge of the Soviet state's first censorship system. Lunacharsky helped his former colleague Alexander Bogdanov start a semi-independent proletarian art movement called Proletkult. Lunacharsky also oversaw improvements in Russia's literacy rate. By arguing for their architectural Importance, he argued for the protection of historic buildings against elements in the Bolshevik Party who wanted to destroy them. Lunacharsky directed some of the great experiments in public arts after the Revolution such as the agit-trains and agit-boats that circulated over all Russia spreading Revolution and revolutionary arts. He also gave support to constructivism's theatrical experiments and the initiatives such as the ROSTA Windows, revolutionary posters designed and written by Mayakovsky, Rodchenko and others. While commissar, Lunacharsky's initiatives included the establishment of Isadora Duncan's school in Moscow, but he was also a playwright, critic, essayist and a widely admired man of culture. As the first Commissar of Enlightenment after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, he was credited with preserving much of Russia's cultural heritage. In June 1919, The New York Times decried Lunacharsky's efforts in education in an article entitle \\"Reds Are Ruining Children of Russia\\". It claimed that he was instilling a \\"system of calculated moral depravity [...] in one of the most diabolical of all measures conceived by the Bolshevik rulers of Russia\\". In 1929, Lunacharsky supported a change in the Soviet Union from Cyrillic to Latin alphabet. =Later career= In 1929 Lunacharsky was appointed to the Learned Council of the Soviet Union Central Executive Committee. He also became an editor for the Literature Encyclopedia (published 1929‚Äì1939). In 1930, Lunacharsky represented the Soviet Union at the League of Nations through 1932. In 1933, he was appointed ambassador to Spain, a post he never assumed as he died en route. Death Lunacharsky died at 58 on 26 December 1933 in Menton, France en route to take up the post of Soviet ambassador to Spain as the conflict that would become the Spanish Civil War appeared increasingly inevitable. A monument to Lunacharsky in Menton, France Personal life In 1902, he married Anna Alexandrovna Malinovkaya, Alexander Bogdanov's sister. They had one child, a daughter named Irina Lunacharsky. In 1922, he met Natalya Rozenel, an actress at the Maly Theater. He left his family and married her. Lunacharsky was known as an art connoisseur and a critic. Besides Marxist dialectics, he had been interested in philosophy since he was a student. For instance, he was fond of the ideas of Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Frederich Nietzsche and Richard Avenarius. He could read six modern languages and two dead ones. Lunacharsky corresponded with H. G. Wells, Bernard Shaw and Romain Rolland. He met numerous other famous cultural figures such as Rabindranath Tagore and Nicholas Roerich. Lunacharsky once described Nadezhda Krupskaya as the \\"soul of Narkompros\\". Friends included Igor Moiseyev. Legacy Lunacharsky's remains were returned to Moscow where his urn was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, a rare privilege during the Soviet era. During the Great Purge of 1936-1938, Lunacharsky's name was erased from the Communist Party's history and his memoirs were banned.Roy Medvedev, Let History Judge, 1971. A revival came in the late 1950s and 1960s, with a surge of memoirs about Lunacharsky and many streets and organizations named or renamed in his honor. During that era, Lunacharsky was viewed by the Soviet intelligentsia as an educated, refined and tolerant Soviet politician. In the 1960s, his daughter Irina Lunacharsky helped revive his popularity. Several streets and institutions were named in his honor. In 1971, Asteroid 2446 was named after Lunacharsky. Some Soviet-built orchestral harps also bear the name of Lunacharsky, presumably in his honor. These concert pedal harps were produced in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg, Russia). The New York Times dubbed Nikolai Gubenko, last culture commissar of the Soviet Union, \\"the first arts professional since Anatoly V. Lunacharsky\\" because he seemed to \\"identify\\" with Lunacharsky. Works Lunacharsky was also a prolific writer. He wrote literary essays on the works of several writers, including Alexander Pushkin, George Bernard Shaw and Marcel Proust. However, his most notable work is his memoirs, Revolutionary Silhouettes, which describe anecdotes and Lunacharsky's general impressions of Lenin, Trotsky and eight other revolutionaries. Trotsky reacted to some of Lunacharsky's opinions in his own autobiography, My Life. In the 1920s, Lunacharsky produced Lyubov Popova's The Locksmith and the Chancellor at the Comedy Theater. Some of his works include: * Outlines of a Collective Philosophy (1909) * Self-Education of the Workers: The Cultural Task of the Struggling Proletariat (1918) * Three Plays (1923) * Revolutionary Silhouettes (1923) * Theses on the Problems of Marxist Criticism (1928) * Vladimir Mayakovsky, Innovator (1931) * George Bernard Shaw (1931) * Maxim Gorky (1932) * On Literature and Art (1965)  See also  * God- Building * New Soviet man * Working-class culture * Proletkult * Proletarian literature * Proletarian novel  References   Further reading  * Works by Lunacharsky at Marxist internet archive * Robert C Williams, 'From Positivism to Collectivism: Lunarcharsky and Proletarian Culture', in Williams, Artists in Revolution, Indiana University Press, 1977 * Vasilisa the Wise (A play by Lunacharsky, in English) * External links * 1875 births 1933 deaths People from Poltava People from Poltava Governorate Old Bolsheviks Mezhraiontsy Russian Constituent Assembly members Soviet politicians Ambassadors of the Soviet Union to Spain Full Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences Russian art critics Russian journalists Russian communists Russian atheists Russian memoirists Burials at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis Cervantists Russian revolutionaries ","title":"Anatoly Lunacharsky"},{"id":"296235","text":"Regnal numbers are ordinal numbers used to distinguish among persons with the same name who held the same office. Most importantly, they are used to distinguish monarchs. An ordinal is the number placed after a monarch's regnal name to differentiate between a number of kings, queens or princes reigning the same territory with the same regnal name. It is common to start counting either since the beginning of the monarchy, or since the beginning of a particular line of state succession. For example, Boris III of Bulgaria and his son Simeon II were given their regnal numbers because the medieval rulers of the First and Second Bulgarian Empire were counted as well even if the present Bulgarian state dated only back to 1878 and were only distantly related to the previous Bulgarian states. On the other hand, the kings of England were counted starting with the Norman conquest of England. That is why the son of Henry III of England is counted as Edward I, even though there were three Edwards before the conquest (they were distinguished by epithets instead). Sometimes legendary or fictional persons are included. For example, the Swedish kings Eric XIV (reigned 1560‚Äì68) and Charles IX (1604‚Äì11) took ordinals based on a fanciful 1544 history by Johannes Magnus, which invented six kings of each name before those accepted by later historians. A list of Swedish monarchs, represented on the map of the Estates of the Swedish Crown, produced by French engraver Jacques Chiquet (1673-1721) and published in Paris in 1719, starts with Canute I and shows Eric XIV and Charles IX as Eric IV and Charles II respectively; the only Charles holding his traditional ordinal in the list is Charles XII. Examples of monarchical ordinals Monarchs with the same given name are distinguished by their ordinals: * Kings Umberto I and Umberto II of Italy * Empresses Catherine I and Catherine II of Russia * Princes Rainier II and Rainier III of Monaco * Popes Benedict XV and Benedict XVI Ordinals may also apply where a ruler of one realm and a ruler of that realm's successor state share the same name: * Queens Elizabeth I of England and Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. * Kings Alfonso XI of Castile and Alfonso XII of Spain. * Kings Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia and Victor Emmanuel II of Italy = Double names = Practice varies where monarchs go by two or more given names. For Swedish monarchs, the ordinal qualifies only the first name; for example, Gustav VI Adolf, known as \\"Gustav Adolf\\", was the sixth Gustav/Gustaf, but the third Gustav Adolf. By contrast, the Kingdom of Prussia was ruled in turn by Friedrich I, Friedrich Wilhelm I, Friedrich II, and Friedrich Wilhelm II; and later by Wilhelm I. Likewise Pope John Paul I, who chose his double name to honour predecessors John XXIII and Paul VI, and was succeeded by John Paul II. = Ordinals for non-reigning royalty = In any case, it is usual to count only the monarchs or heads of the family, and to number them sequentially up to the end of the dynasty. A notable exception to this rule is the German House of Reuss. This family has the particularity that every male member during the last centuries was named Heinrich, and all of them, not only the head of the family, were numbered. While the members of the elder branch were numbered in order of birth until the extinction of the branch in 1927, the members of the younger line were (and still are) numbered in sequences that began and ended roughly as centuries began and ended. This explains why the current (since 2012) head of the Reuss family is called Heinrich XIV, his late father Heinrich IV and his sons Heinrich XXIX and Heinrich V. It is rare, but some German princely families number all males whether head of the family or not; for example, Hans Heinrich XV von Hochberg was preceded as Prince of Pless by Hans Heinrich XI and succeeded by Hans Heinrich XVII; the ordinals XII, XIII, XIV, and XVI were borne by von Hochbergs who were not Prince of Pless. Similarly for the House of Reuss, where all men were numbered Heinrichs and some were reigning Princes of Reuss- Gera or Reuss-Greiz. History Almost all West European monarchs and popes after medieval times have used ordinals. Ordinals are also retrospectively applied to earlier monarchs in most works of reference, at least as far as they are not easy to distinguish from each other by any other systematical means. In several cases, various sorts of \\"semi-regnal\\" members of dynasties are also numeraled, to facilitate their individuality in works of reference ‚Äì in cases such as co-regents, crown princes, succession-conveying consorts, prime ministers and deputy monarchs. In the first centuries after the Middle Ages, the use was sometimes sporadic, but became established by the 18th century. In the past couple of centuries, European monarchs without an official ordinal have been rarities. As a rule of thumb, medieval European monarchs did not use ordinals at their own time, and those who used were rarities and even their use was sporadic. Ordinals for monarchs before the 13th century are anachronisms, as are also ordinals for almost all later medieval monarchs. Still, they are often used, because they are a practical way of distinguishing between different historical monarchs who had the same name. Popes were apparently the first to assume official ordinals for their reigns, although this occurred only in the last centuries of the Middle Ages. It is clear, from renumberings of Popes John XV‚ÄìXIX and Popes Stephen II‚ÄìIX, that as of the 11th century the Popes did not yet use established ordinals. The official, self-confirmed numbering of John XXI means that at latest from the 13th century the Popes did take official ordinals in their accession. Emperor Frederick II, king Charles II of Naples and king Premislas II of Poland evidently used ordinals sometimes during their reign, whereas most of their contemporary monarchs did not. In the 14th century, Emperor Charles IV sometimes used that ordinal. Presumably, use of the ordinal of king Frederick III of Sicily also is contemporaneous. The royal chroniclers of the Abbey of Saint-Denis were using ordinals to refer to the French kings as early as the thirteenth century with the practise entering common usage among royalty and the nobility by the late fourteenth century. The British tradition of consistently and prevalently numbering monarchs dates back to Henry VIII and Mary I; however, sporadic use occurred at least as early as the reign of Edward III. The long history of the Papacy has led to difficulties in some cases. For example, Stephen was only Pope for three days before dying of apoplexy, and was never consecrated. Because not all list-makers count him as having been pope (as Stephen II), there has been some confusion in regard to later popes who chose the name Stephen. Later Stephens are sometimes numbered with parentheses, e.g., his immediate successor (in name) is denoted either Stephen (II) III or Stephen III (II). The church did consider Stephen II a Pope until 1960, when he was removed from the list of Popes in 1961. Another example of this is that there has never been a Pope John XX. Personal unions In the case of personal unions, one king has often have more than one ordinal, because he has had different ordinals in the different realms where he reigns. For instance, Charles XV of Sweden was also king of Norway, but in Norway he went under the name Charles IV. The Swedish-Norwegian union was in force 1814‚Äì1905 and both realms had had kings called Charles before the union, but Sweden had had more kings by that name. In the event of one kingdom reaching independence from another but still under the same monarch, the monarch often retains the same number as he has already had in the older realm. King Christian X of Denmark thus became King Christian X of Iceland when Iceland became an independent kingdom in personal union with Denmark in 1918. The same is true for Commonwealth realms, where the monarch retains the regnal number from the British line of monarchs (see below). =Ordinals and the British Acts of Union 1707= Beginning in 1603, when England and Scotland began to share a monarch but were still legally separate realms, their monarchs were numbered separately. The king who began the personal union was James VI of Scotland who was also James I of England, and his name is often written (especially in Scotland) as James VI and I. Similarly, his grandson is James VII and II. Mary II's ordinal coincidentally relates to both her predecessors Mary I of England and Mary I of Scotland; her co-sovereign husband is William III and II (here the English number is first). Charles I and Charles II had a name not used in either country before 1603. Acts of Union After the realms were united with the Acts of Union 1707, separate numbers were not needed for the next five monarchs: Anne and the four Georges. However, when William IV acceded in 1830, he was not called William III in Scotland. (George Croly pointed out in 1830 the new king was William I, II, III, and IV: of Hanover, Ireland, Scotland, and England respectively.) Nor were Edward VII and Edward VIII known as Edward I and Edward II (or possibly II and III, if one counts the disputed reign of Edward Balliol) of Scotland. These kings all followed the numbering consistent with the English sequence of sovereigns (which, incidentally, was also the higher of the two numbers in all occurring cases). This was not without controversy in Scotland, however; for example, Edward VII's regnal number was occasionally omitted in Scotland, even by the established Church of Scotland, in deference to protests that the previous Edwards were English kings who had \\"been excluded from Scotland by battle\\". (Subscription required) Queen Elizabeth II The issue arose again with the accession of the current monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, as Scotland has never before had a regnant Queen Elizabeth, the previous queen of that name having been queen of England only. Objections were raised, and sustained, to the use of the royal cypher EIIR anywhere in Scotland, resulting in several violent incidents, including the destruction of one of the first new EIIR pillar boxes in Scotland, at Leith in late 1952. Since that time, the cipher used in Scotland on all government and Crown property and street furniture has carried no lettering, but simply the Crown of Scotland from the Honours of Scotland. A court case, MacCormick v Lord Advocate, contesting the style \\"Elizabeth II\\" within Scotland, was decided in 1953 on the grounds that the numbering of monarchs was part of the royal prerogative, and that the plaintiffs had no title to sue the Crown. To rationalise this usage, it was suggested by Winston Churchill that, in the future, the higher of the two numerals from the English and Scottish sequences would always be used. So, theoretically, any future British King Edward would be given the number IX, even though there have only been two (or three) previous Edwards in Scotland, but any future King Alexander would be given the number IV, even though he would be the first Alexander to reign in England. This had been the case de facto since the Acts of Union 1707; eight of the twelve monarchs since the Act had names never previously used in England or Scotland (Anne, six Georges, and Victoria), sidestepping the issue, and the English numbers for the remaining four monarchs' names (William, two Edwards, and Elizabeth) have consistently been higher and were used. Ireland As the Lordship of Ireland (1171‚Äì1542) and Kingdom of Ireland (1542-1800) were subordinate to the Kingdom of England, the English ordinals were used in Ireland even before the Acts of Union 1800. William III of England is still called \\"William III\\" in Ireland, even though neither William I or William II ruled any part of Ireland. Elizabeth I of England is referred to in Irish regnal year legal citations as \\"Elizabeth\\" rather than \\"Elizabeth I\\" because Ireland became a republic before Elizabeth II became queen. \\"The first\\"  In some monarchies it is customary not to use an ordinal when there has been only one holder of that name. For example, Queen Victoria will not be called Victoria I until there is a Victoria II. This tradition is applied in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, and in the case of the queens regnant of the Netherlands. It was also applied in most of the German monarchies and in that of Hungary. In Sweden, the practice is not consistent, as Sigismund and Adolf Frederick never have ordinals, whereas Frederick I often does. Other monarchies assign ordinals to monarchs even if they are the only ones of their name. This is a more recent invention and appears to have been done for the first time when Francis I of France issued testoons (silver coins) bearing the legend FRANCISCVS I DE. GR. FRANCORV. REX. This currently is the regular practice in Spain and Monaco (at least for Prince Albert I, as Princess Louise Hippolyte, who reigned 150 years earlier, does not appear to have used an ordinal). It was also applied in Brazil, Greece, Italy, Mexico, Montenegro, Portugal (where Kings Joseph, Louis and Charles are usually referred to as \\"Joseph I\\", \\"Louis I\\" and \\"Charles I\\", although there haven't been any Joseph II, Louis II or Charles II yet, while Kings Denis, Edward, Sebastian and Henry are usually referred without the ordinal). The ordinal for King Juan Carlos I of Spain is used in both Spanish and English, but he is sometimes simply called King Juan Carlos of Spain in English. In Russia, use of \\"The First\\" ordinal started with Paul I of Russia. Before him, neither Anna of Russia nor Elizabeth of Russia had the \\"I\\" ordinal. In Ethiopia, Emperor Haile Selassie used the \\"I\\" ordinal (, q√§damawi), although previous Ethiopian monarchs did not use it, and they are not referred as \\"the first\\" unless there were successors of the same name. The Catholic Papacy used the ordinal I under Pope John Paul I, but early Popes who are the only ones to have reigned under a certain name are not referred to as \\"the first\\" (for instance, Peter the Apostle; his immediate successor Pope Linus; Pope Anacletus, etc., are all referred to without an ordinal). The current Pope Francis has declined the use of an ordinal, while on the other hand his Orthodox counterpart Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople is using one, as does Aram I, the catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church. In Austria, Emperors Francis, Ferdinand, Francis Joseph and Charles all styled themselves as \\"the first\\" despite the fact that they were all the only Emperors of Austria with those names. Three of those names were previously the names of Austrian Archdukes (the Archduchy of Austria was a state within the Holy Roman and Austrian Empires), making three of these emperors Francis II, Ferdinand V, and Charles IV in their capacity as Archdukes. Francis Joseph was the first Austrian Archduke of that name. The use of \\"The First\\" ordinal is also common to self-proclaimed ephemeral \\"kings\\" or \\"emperors\\", such as Napoleon I in France, Dessalines, Christophe and Soulouque in Haiti, Iturbide in Mexico, Zog in Albania, Bokassa in the Central African Republic, Skossyreff in Andorra, or Norton in San Francisco. In these cases they wanted to emphasize the change of regime they introduced or attempted to introduce. Pretenders It is traditional amongst monarchists to continue to number their pretenders, even though they have never reigned. Hence, a supporter of the late Comte de Paris would have referred to him as Henri VII, even though only four men named \\"Henri\\" have been King of France. Non-consecutive ordinals may indicate dynastic claims for non-regnant monarchs. For example, after Louis XVI of France was executed during the French Revolution, legitimists consider him to have been succeeded by his young son, whom they called Louis XVII. Although the child died in prison a few years later and never reigned, his uncle, who came to the French throne in the Bourbon Restoration, took the name Louis XVIII in acknowledgement of his dynasty's rights. Similarly, when Emperor Napoleon I's regime collapsed, he abdicated in favour of his four- year-old son, who was proclaimed Napoleon II. The young emperor was deposed only weeks later by Napoleon's European rivals and was never recognized internationally; but when his first cousin Louis Napoleon Bonaparte proclaimed himself Emperor in 1852, he declared himself Napoleon III of France in recognition of his predecessor. Queens consort While reigning monarchs use ordinals, ordinals are not used for royal female consorts. So whereas King George V used an ordinal to distinguish him from other kings in the United Kingdoms called George, his wife, Queen Mary, had no ordinal. The lack of an ordinal in the case of royal consorts complicates the recording of history, as there may be a number of consorts over time with the same name with no way to distinguish between them. For that reason, royal consorts are sometimes after their deaths recorded in history books and encyclopaedias through the use of their pre-marital name or, if from a reigning family, its Royal House (dynastic name) or the name of the country (e.g. Alexandra of Denmark). Kings consort It is not usual to number male consorts of a Queen regnant, or even to consider them as 'kings', unless both of them are crowned: as it was the case of Mary II and William III of England, or of all male kings consort in medieval crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem and in medieval Spanish Kingdom of Navarre. In the history of Spain the only king consort was Francisco de Asis de Borb√≥n, husband of Isabella II, but he is not numbered at all and is never included in official regnal lists. The kingdom of Portugal had the uncommon custom of not only recognizing the title of 'king', but also numbering a consort of a Queen regnant, but only if and when he fathers an heir apparent to her, and nevertheless they are also not included in official lists of Portuguese Chiefs of State. And so, the husband of Maria I is known as 'king consort Pedro III' until his death in 1786 before his wife; and also the husband of Maria II was titled 'King consort Fernando II' when their elder son, the future king Pedro V, was born in 1837, but this same title was retired from him when his queen wife died in 1853.

Prior to this, he had been a cardinal, archbishop of Toledo, viceroy of Portugal and Governor General of the Habsburg Netherlands. He succeeded his brother Matthias as reigning archduke of Lower and Upper Austria, but abdicated in favor of Ferdinand II the same year, making it the shortest (and often ignored) reign in Austrian history. Early life Archduke Albert was the fifth son of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II and Maria of Spain, daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and Isabella of Portugal. He was sent to the Spanish Court at the age of eleven, where his uncle, King Philip II, looked after his education. Initially he was meant to pursue an ecclesiastical career. On 3 March 1577 he was appointed cardinal by Pope Gregory XIII, with a dispensation because of his age of eighteen, and was given Santa Croce in Gerusalemme as his titular church.Guilelmus van Gulik and Conradus Eubel, Hierarchia catholica medii et recentioris aevi Volumen tertium, editio altera (ed. L. Schmitz-Kallenberg) (Monasterii 1923), p. 45. Philip II planned to make Albert archbishop of Toledo as soon as possible, but the incumbent, Gaspar de Quiroga y Sandoval, lived much longer than expected; he died on 12 November 1594. In the meantime Albert only took lower orders. He was never ordained priest or bishop, and thus he resigned the See of Toledo in 1598.Gulik-Eubel, p. 315. He resigned the cardinalate in 1598.There was a contemporary precedent. In 1588 Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici resigned on the death of his brother in order to become Grand Duke of Tuscany: Gulik-Eubel, p. 40 and n. 5. Ferdinand too had not taken Holy Orders. His clerical upbringing did however have a lasting influence on his lifestyle.Caeiro (1961) p. 5-31. After the dynastic union with Portugal, Albert became the first viceroy of the kingdom and its overseas empire in 1583. At the same time he was appointed Papal Legate and Grand Inquisitor for Portugal.Gulik-Eubel, p. 45 note 12. As viceroy of Portugal he took part in the organization of the Great Armada of 1588 and beat off an English counter-attack on Lisbon in 1589.Caeiro (1961) passim. In 1593 Philip II recalled him to Madrid, where he would take a leading role in the government of the Spanish Monarchy.Feros (2000) p. 28-30 Two years later, the rebellious Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone and Hugh Roe O'Donnell offered Albert the Irish crown in the hope of obtaining Spanish support for their cause.Morgan (1993) p. 208-210.

Jeton with portraits of Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia struck in Antwerp 1612. After the death of Archduke Ernest of Austria in 1595, Albert was sent to Brussels to succeed his elder brother as Governor General of the Habsburg Netherlands. He made his entry in Brussels on 11 February 1596. His first priority was restoring Spain's military position in the Low Countries. Spain was facing the combined forces of the Dutch Republic, England and France and had known nothing but defeats since 1590. During his first campaign season, Albert surprised his enemies by capturing Calais and nearby Ardres from the French and Hulst from the Dutch. These successes were however offset by the third bankruptcy of the Spanish crown later that year. As a consequence, 1597 was marked by a series of military disasters. Stadholder Maurice of Orange captured the last Spanish strongholds that remained north of the great rivers, as well as the strategic town of Rheinberg in the Electorate of Cologne. Between 13 May and 25 September 1597, the Spanish, who had sent a large army in March, had captured the city of Amiens easily in a ruse. Finally the Spanish Army of Flanders lost Amiens in September the same year to Henry IV of France despite desperate efforts to relieve the place by Albert and Ernst von Mansfeld. With no more money to pay the troops, Albert was also facing a series of mutinies. Portrait of Albert VII (c. 1599-1600), by Frans Pourbus the Younger. Convent of Las Descalzas Reales collection in Madrid. While pursuing the war as well as he could, Albert made overtures for peace with Spain's enemies, but only the French King was disposed to enter official negotiations. Under the mediation of the papal legate Cardinal Alessandro de'Medici ‚Äî the future Pope Leo XI ‚Äî Spain and France concluded the Peace of Vervins on 2 May 1598. Spain gave up its conquests, thereby restoring the situation of Cateau Cambr√©sis. France tacitly accepted the Spanish occupation of the prince-archbishopric of Cambray and pulled out of the war, but maintained the financial support for the Dutch Republic. Only a few days after the treaty, on 6 May 1598, Philip II announced his decision to marry his eldest daughter, Isabella Clara Eugenia, to Albert and to cede them the sovereignty over the Habsburg Netherlands. The Act of Cession did however stipulate that if the couple would not have children, the Netherlands would return to Spain. It also contained a number of secret clauses that assured a permanent presence of the Spanish Army of Flanders. After obtaining the pope's permission, Albert formally resigned from the College of Cardinals on 13 July 1598 and left for Spain on 14 September, unaware that Philip II had died the night before. Pope Clement VIII celebrated the union by procuration on 15 November at Ferrara, while the actual marriage took place in Valencia on 18 April 1599. War years Arms of Albert VII as Sovereign of the Habsburg Netherlands. The first half of the reign of Albert and Isabella was dominated by war. After overtures to the United Provinces and to Queen Elizabeth I of England proved unsuccessful, the Habsburg policy in the Low Countries aimed at regaining the military initiative and isolating the Dutch Republic. The strategy was to force its opponents to the conference table and negotiate from a position of strength. Even if Madrid and Brussels tended to agree on these options, Albert took a far more flexible stance than his brother-in-law, King Philip III of Spain. Albert had first-hand knowledge of the devastation wrought by the Dutch Revolt, and he had come to the conclusion that it would be virtually impossible to reconquer the northern provinces. Quite logically, Philip III and his councillors felt more concern for Spain's reputation and for the impact that a compromise with the Dutch Republic might have on Habsburg positions as a whole. Spain provided the means to continue the war. Albert took the decisions on the ground and tended to ignore Madrid's instructions. Under the circumstances, the division of responsibilities repeatedly led to tensions. Albert's reputation as a military commander suffered badly when he was defeated by the Dutch stadtholder Maurice of Orange in the battle of Nieuwpoort on 2 July 1600. His inability to conclude the lengthy siege of Ostend (1601‚Äì1604), resulted in his withdrawal from the tactical command of the Spanish Army of Flanders. From then on military operations were led by the Genoese Ambrogio Sp√≠nola. Even though he could not prevent the almost simultaneous capture of Sluis, Sp√≠nola forced Ostend to surrender on 22 September 1604. He seized the initiative during the next campaigns, bringing the war north of the great rivers for the first time since 1594. Meanwhile, the accession of James VI of Scotland as James I in England had paved the way for a separate peace with England. On 24 July 1604 England, Spain and the Archducal Netherlands signed the Treaty of London. The return to peace was severely hampered by differences over religion. Events such as the Gunpowder Plot caused a lot of diplomatic tension between London and Brussels. Yet on the whole relations between the two courts tended to be cordial. Sp√≠nola's campaigns and the threat of diplomatic isolation induced the Dutch Republic to accept a ceasefire in April 1607. The subsequent negotiations between the warring parties failed to produce a peace treaty. They did lead however to conclusion of the Twelve Years' Truce in Antwerp on 9 April 1609. Under the terms of the Truce, the United Provinces were to be regarded as a sovereign power for the duration of the truce. Albert had conceded this point against the will of Madrid and it took him a lot of effort to persuade Philip III to ratify the agreement. When Philip's ratification finally arrived, Albert's quest for the restoration of peace in the Low Countries had finally paid off. Years of peace Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia Engraving of Albert VII, Archduke of Austria The years of the Truce gave the Habsburg Netherlands a much needed breathing-space. The fields could again be worked in safety. The archducal regime encouraged the reclaiming of land that had been inundated in the course of the hostilities and sponsored the impoldering of the Moeren, a marshy area that is presently astride the Belgian‚ÄìFrench border. The recovery of agriculture led in turn to a modest increase of the population after decades of demographic losses. Industry and in particular the luxury trades likewise underwent a recovery. International trade was however hampered by the closure of the river Scheldt. The archducal regime had plans to bypass the blockade with a system of canals linking Ostend via Bruges to the Scheldt in Ghent and joining the Meuse to the Rhine between Venlo and Rheinberg. In order to combat urban poverty, the government supported the creation of a network of Monti di Piet√† based on the Italian model. Meanwhile, the archducal regime ensured the triumph of the Catholic Reformation in the Habsburg Netherlands. Most Protestants had by that stage left the Southern Netherlands. After one last execution in 1597, those that remained were no longer actively persecuted. Under the terms of legislation passed in 1609, their presence was tolerated, provided they did not worship in public. Engaging in religious debates was also forbidden by law. The resolutions of the Third Provincial Council of Mechlin of 1607 were likewise given official sanction. Through such measures and by the appointment of a generation of able and committed bishops, Albert and Isabella laid the foundation of the catholic confessionalisation of the population. The same period saw important waves of witch-hunts. In the process of recatholisation, new and reformed religious orders enjoyed the particular support of Albert and Isabella. Even though the Archduke had certain reservations about the order, the Jesuits received the largest cash grants, allowing them to complete their ambitious building programmes in Brussels and Antwerp. Other champions of the Catholic Reformation, such as the Capuchins, were also given considerable sums. The foundation of the first convents of Discalced Carmelites in the Southern Netherlands depended wholly on the personal initiative of the archducal couple and bore witness to the Spanish orientation of their spirituality. The reign of Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia saw a strengthening of princely power in the Habsburg Netherlands. The States General of the loyal provinces were only summoned once in 1600. Thereafter the government preferred to deal directly with the provinces. The years of the Truce allowed the archducal regime to promulgate legislation on a whole range of matters. The so-called Eternal Edict of 1611, for instance, reformed the judicial system and ushered in the transition from customary to written law. Other measures dealt with monetary matters, the nobility, duels, gambling, etc. Driven by strategic as well as religious motives, Albert intervened in 1614 in the squabbles over the inheritance of the United Duchies of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg. The subsequent confrontation with the armies of the Dutch Republic led to the Treaty of Xanten. The episode was in many ways a rehearsal of what was to come in the Thirty Years' War. After the defenestration of Prague, Albert responded by sending troops to his cousin Ferdinand II and by pressing Philip III for financial support to the cause of the Austrian Habsburgs. As such he contributed considerably to the victory of the Habsburg and Bavarian forces in the Battle of the White Mountain on 8 November 1620. Death and succession Funeral procession for the Archduke. Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia had three children who died at a very young age, in 1605, 1607 and 1609. As the years passed, it became clear that they would have no more offspring. When Albert's health suffered a serious breakdown in the winter of 1613-1614, steps were taken to ensure the accession of Philip III of Spain in accordance to the Act of Cession. As a result, the States of the loyal provinces swore to accept the King as heir of the Archduke and Archduchess in a number of ceremonies between May 1616 and January 1617. Philip III however predeceased his uncle on 31 March 1621. The right to succeed the couple thereupon passed to his eldest, Philip IV. Albert's health again deteriorated markedly in the closing months of 1620. As the Twelve Years' Truce would expire the next April, he devoted his last energies to securing its renewal. In order to reach this goal he was prepared to make far reaching concessions. Much to his frustration, neither the Spanish Monarchy, nor the Dutch Republic took his pleas for peace seriously. His death on 13 July 1621 therefore more or less coincided with the resumption of hostilities. Artistic patronage private art gallery. Virtually nothing remains of Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia' palace on the Koudenberg in Brussels, their summer retreat in Mariemont or their hunting lodge in Tervuren. Their once magnificent collections were scattered after 1633 and considerable parts of them have been lost. Still, the Archdukes Albert and Isabella enjoy a well merited reputation as patrons of the arts. They are probably best remembered for the appointment of Peter Paul Rubens as their court painter in 1609. They likewise gave commissions to outstanding painters such as Frans Pourbus the Younger, Otto van Veen and Jan Brueghel the Elder. Less well known painters such as Hendrik de Clerck, Theodoor van Loon and Denis van Alsloot were also called upon. Mention should furthermore be made of architects such as Wenzel Cobergher and Jacob Franquart, as well as of the sculptors de Nole. By far the best preserved ensemble of art from the archducal period is to be found at Scherpenheuvel where Albert and Isabella directed Cobergher, the painter Theodoor van Loon and the de Noles to create a pilgrimage church in a planned city.

The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic. During 1920‚Äì21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand. Life =Early life= Childhood and family background The Savoy Hotel, London: Philip Heseltine's birthplace (1994 photograph) Heseltine was born on 30 October 1894 at the Savoy Hotel, London, which his parents were using at the time as their town residence.Smith 1994, p. 2 The family was wealthy, with strong artistic connections and some background in classical scholarship.Smith 1994, p. 4 Philip's parents were Arnold Heseltine, a solicitor in the family firm, and Bessie Mary Edith, n√©e Covernton. She was the daughter of a country doctor from the Welsh border town of Knighton and was Arnold's second wife. Soon after Philip's birth, the family moved to Chelsea where he attended a nearby kindergarten and received his first piano lessons.Parrott, pp. 10‚Äì11 In March 1897 Arnold Heseltine died suddenly at the age of 45. Six years later, Bessie married a Welsh landowner and local magistrate, Walter Buckley Jones, and moved to Jones's estate, Cefn Bryntalch, Llandyssil, near Montgomery, although the London house was retained.Parrott, p. 18 The youthful Philip was proud of his Welsh heritage and retained a lifelong interest in Celtic culture; later he would live in Wales during one of his most productive and creative phases. In 1903 Heseltine entered Stone House Preparatory School in Broadstairs, where he showed precocious academic ability and won several prizes.Parrott, p. 20 In January 1908, at a concert in the Royal Albert Hall, he heard a performance of Lebenstanz, composed by Frederick Delius. The work made little impression on him until he discovered that his uncle, Arthur Joseph Heseltine (known as \\"Joe\\"), an artist, lived close to Delius's home in Grez-sur-Loing in France. Philip then used the connection to obtain the composer's autograph for Stone House's music teacher, W. E. Brockway.Smith 1994, pp. 17‚Äì18 Eton: first meeting with Delius Frederick Delius, around the time of his initial association with Heseltine Heseltine left Stone House in the summer of 1908 and began at Eton College that autumn. His biographer Ian Parrott records that he loathed Eton, \\"with its hearty adolescent bawling of Victorian hymns in an all-male college chapel\\". He was equally unhappy with other aspects of school life, such as the Officers' Training Corps, the suggestive homosexuality, and endemic bullying.Parrott, pp. 20‚Äì23 He found relief in music and, perhaps because of the connection with his uncle, formed an interest in Delius that developed into a near-obsession. He also found a kindred spirit in an Eton music teacher and Delius advocate, the cellist Edward Mason, from whom Heseltine borrowed a copy of the score of Sea Drift. He thought it \\"heavenly\\", and was soon requesting funds from his mother to purchase more of Delius's music. According to Cecil Gray, Heseltine's first biographer, \\"[Heseltine] did not rest until he had procured every work of Delius which was then accessible\\".Gray 1934, pp. 36‚Äì37 In June 1911 Heseltine learned that Thomas Beecham was to conduct an all-Delius concert at London's Queen's Hall on the 16th of that month, at which the composer would be present, and his Songs of Sunset would be given its first performance. Colin Taylor, a sympathetic Eton piano tutor, secured permission from the school for Heseltine to attend the event. Prior to this, his mother had contrived to meet Delius in her London home; as a consequence, during the concert intermission Heseltine was introduced to the composer. The next day he wrote Delius a long appreciative letter: \\"I cannot adequately express in words the intense pleasure it was to me to hear such perfect performances of such perfect music\\".Smith 1994, pp. 19‚Äì21 He told his mother that \\"Friday evening was the most perfectly happy evening I have ever spent, and I shall never forget it\\".Smith 1994, pp. 22‚Äì23 Delius became the first strong formative influence of Heseltine's compositional career, and although the initial adulation was later modified, a friendship began that would largely endure for the remainder of Heseltine's life. =Cologne, Oxford and London= By the summer of 1911, a year before he was due to leave the school, Heseltine had tired of life at Eton. Without a clear plan for his future, he asked his mother if he could live abroad for a while. His mother wanted him to go to university, and then either into the City or the Civil Service, but she agreed to his request with the proviso that he would resume his education later. In October 1911 he proceeded to Cologne to learn German and to study piano at the conservatory.Smith 1994, pp. 24‚Äì25 In Cologne Heseltine produced his first few songs which, like all his earliest works, were highly imitative of Delius. The piano studies went poorly, although Heseltine expanded his musical experiences by attending concerts and operas. He also experimented with general journalism, publishing an article in Railway and Travel Monthly on the subject of a disused Welsh branch line. Christ Church, Oxford, where Heseltine spent an unhappy year, 1913‚Äì14 In March 1912 Heseltine returned to London and engaged a tutor to prepare for his university entrance examinations. He spent time with Delius at that summer's Birmingham Festival,Smith 1994, pp. 31‚Äì36 and published his first music criticism, an article on Arnold Schoenberg that appeared in the Musical Standard in September 1912.Parrott, pp. 13‚Äì14 Despite his mother's wishes and his lack of formal musical training, he hoped to make a career in music. He consulted Delius, who advised him that, if his mind was set, he should follow his instincts and pursue this objective in the face of all other considerations.Beecham, p. 175 Beecham, who knew both men, later sharply criticised this advice, on the grounds of Heseltine's immaturity and instability. \\"Frederick should never have committed the psychological blunder of preaching the doctrine of relentless determination to someone incapable of receiving it\\".Beecham, pp. 175, 179 In the end Heseltine acceded to his mother's wishes. After passing the necessary examinations, he was accepted to study classics at Christ Church, Oxford, and began there in October 1913.Smith 1994, p. 38 A female acquaintance at Christ Church described the 19-year-old Heseltine as \\"probably about 22, but he appears to be years older ... 6 feet high, absolutely fit ... brilliant blue eyes ... and the curved lips and highhead carriage of a young Greek God\\".Smith 1994, p. 55 Although he enjoyed social success, he soon became depressed and unhappy with Oxford life. In April 1914 he spent part of his Easter vacation with Delius at Grez, and worked with the composer on the scores of An Arabesque and Fennimore and Gerda, in the latter case providing an English version of the libretto.Smith 1994, p. 60 He did not return to Oxford after the 1914 summer vacation; with his mother's reluctant consent he moved to Bloomsbury in London, and enrolled at University College London to study language, literature and philosophy.Smith 1994, pp. 68‚Äì69 In his spare time he conducted a small amateur orchestra in Windsor, after admitting to Delius that he knew nothing of the art of conducting.Gray 1934, p. 97 However, his life as a student in London was brief; in February 1915, with the help of Lady Emerald Cunard (a mistress of Beecham) he secured a job as a music critic for the Daily Mail at a salary of ¬£100 per year. He promptly abandoned his university studies to begin this new career. =Unsettled years= Music critic During Heseltine's four months at the Daily Mail, he wrote about 30 notices, mainly short reports of musical events but occasionally with some analysis. His first contribution, dated 9 February 1915, described a performance by Benno Moiseiwitsch of Delius's Piano Concerto in C minor, as \\"masterly\\", while Delius was hailed as \\"the greatest composer England has produced for two centuries\\". The other work in the programme was \\"the last great symphony that has been delivered to the world\\": the Symphony in D minor by Franck.Fenby (ed.) 1987, p. 2 He wrote for other publications; a 5000-word article, \\"Some notes on Delius and his Music\\", appeared in the March 1915 issue of The Musical Times,Fenby (ed.) 1987, pp. 3‚Äì9 in which Heseltine opined: \\"There can be no superficial view of Delius's music: either one feels it in the very depths of one's being, or not at all\\". Only Beecham, Heseltine suggested, was capable of interpreting the music adequately. Heseltine's last notice for the Daily Mail was dated 17 June;Fenby (ed.) 1987, p. 11 later that month he resigned, frustrated by the paper's frequent cutting of his more critical opinions.Smith 1994, p. 70 Unemployed, he spent his days in the British Museum, studying and editing Elizabethan music. New friends and acquaintances Heseltine spent much of the 1915 summer in a rented holiday cottage in the Vale of Evesham, with a party that included a young artist's model named Minnie Lucie Channing, who was known as \\"Puma\\" because of her volatile temperament. She and Heseltine soon entered into a passionate love affair.Smith 1994, pp. 71‚Äì72 During this summer break Heseltine shocked neighbours by his uninhibited behaviour, which included riding a motorcycle naked down nearby Crickley Hill.Copley 1979, p. 23 However, his letters show that at this time he was often depressed and insecure, lacking any clear sense of purpose. In November 1915 his life gained some impetus when he met D. H. Lawrence and the pair found an immediate rapport. Heseltine declared Lawrence to be \\"the greatest literary genius of his generation\\",Smith 1994, pp. 76‚Äì77 and enthusiastically fell in with the writer's plans to found a Utopian colony in America. In late December he followed the Lawrences to Cornwall, where he tried, unavailingly, to set up a publishing company with them. Passions between Heseltine and Puma had meanwhile cooled; when she revealed that she was pregnant, Heseltine confided to Delius that he had little liking for her and had no intention of helping her to raise this unwanted child.Smith 1994, pp. 84‚Äì85 The Cafe Royal circa 1912, a frequent meeting place for Heseltine and his friends In February 1916 Heseltine returned to London, ostensibly to argue for exemption from military service. However, it became clear that there had been a rift with Lawrence; in a letter to his friend Robert Nichols, Heseltine described Lawrence as \\"a bloody bore determined to make me wholly his and as boring as he is\\".Smith 1994, pp. 90‚Äì94 The social centre of Heseltine's life now became the Caf√© Royal in Regent Street, where among others he met Cecil Gray, a young Scottish composer. The two decided to share a Battersea studio, where they planned various unfulfilled schemes, including a new music magazine,Smith 1994, pp. 94‚Äì97 and, more ambitiously, a London season of operas and concerts. Heseltine declined an offer from Beecham to participate in the latter's English Opera Company, writing to Delius that Beecham's productions and choices of works were increasingly poor and lacking in artistic value; in his own venture there would be \\"no compromise with the mob\\".Gray 1934, p. 131 Beecham ridiculed the plan; he said it would \\"be launched and controlled by persons without the smallest experience of theatrical life\\".Beecham, pp. 175‚Äì77 An event of considerable significance in Heseltine's musical life, late in 1916, was his introduction to the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren. This friendship considerably influenced Heseltine, who for the rest of his life continued to promote the older composer's music.Smith 1994, pp. 98‚Äì99 In November 1916 Heseltine used the pseudonym \\"Peter Warlock\\" for the first time, in an article on Sir Eugene Aynsley Goossens' chamber music for The Music Student.Smith 1994, pp. 103‚Äì04Parrott, p. 44 Puma bore a son in July 1916, though there is confusion about the child's exact identity. Most biographers assumed him to be Nigel Heseltine, the future writer who published a memoir of his father in 1992. However, in that memoir Nigel denied that Puma was his mother; he was, he says, the result of a concurrent liaison between Heseltine and an unnamed Swiss girl. Subsequently, he was given to foster-parents, then adopted by Heseltine's mother.N. Heseltine, p. 123 Parrott records that the son born to Puma was called Peter, and died in infancy.Parrott, pp. 24‚Äì25 Smith, however, states that Puma's baby was originally called Peter but was renamed Nigel \\"for reasons which have not as yet been satisfactorily explained\\". Whatever the truth of the paternity, and in spite of their mutual misgivings, Heseltine and Puma were married at Chelsea Register Office on 22 December 1916.Smith 1994, pp. 106‚Äì07 Ireland William Butler Yeats By April 1917 Heseltine had again tired of London life. He returned to Cornwall where he rented a small cottage near the Lawrences, and made a partial peace with the writer. By the summer of 1917, as Allied fortunes in the war stagnated, Heseltine's military exemption came under review; to forestall a possible conscription, in August 1917 he moved to Ireland, taking Puma, with whom he had decided he was, after all, in love.Smith 1994, pp. 110‚Äì20 In Ireland Heseltine combined studies of early music with a fascination for Celtic languages, withdrawing for a two- month period to a remote island where Irish was spoken exclusively.Smith 1994, pp. 125‚Äì27 Another preoccupation was an increasing fascination with magical and occult practices, an interest first awakened during his Oxford year and revived in Cornwall. A letter to Robert Nichols indicates that at this time he was \\"tamper[ing] ... with the science vulgarly known as Black Magic\\". To his former tutor Colin Taylor, Heseltine enthused about books \\"full of the most astounding wisdom and illumination\\"; these works included Eliphas Levi's History of Transcendental Magic, which includes procedures for the invocation of demons.Smith 1994, pp. 130‚Äì34 These diversions did not prevent Heseltine from participating in Dublin's cultural life. He met W.B. Yeats, a fellow- enthusiast for the occult, and briefly considered writing an opera based on the 9th-century Celtic folk-tale of Liadain and Curithir.Parrott, p. 72 The composer Denis ApIvor has indicated that Heseltine's obsession with the occult was eventually replaced by his studies in religious philosophies, to which he was drawn through membership of a theosophist group in Dublin. Heseltine's interest in this field had originally been aroused by Kaikhosru Sorabji, the composer who had introduced him to the music of B√©la Bart√≥k.ApIvor, pp. 187‚Äì195 On 12 May 1918 Heseltine delivered a well-received illustrated lecture, \\"What Music Is\\", at Dublin's Abbey Theatre, which included musical excerpts from Bart√≥k, the French composer Paul Ladmirault, and Van Dieren.Parrott, p. 31Smith 1994, p. 136 Heseltine's championing of Van Dieren's music led in August 1918 to a vituperative war of words with the music publisher Winthrop Rogers, over the latter's rejection of several Van Dieren compositions. This dispute stimulated Heseltine's own creative powers, and in his final two weeks in Ireland he wrote ten songs, which later critics have considered to be among his finest work.Smith 1994, pp. 145‚Äì51 Journalism and The Sackbut When Heseltine returned to London at the end of August 1918 he sent seven of his new songs to Rogers for publication. Because of the recent contretemps over Van Dieren, Heseltine submitted these pieces as \\"Peter Warlock\\". They were published under this pseudonym, which he thereafter adopted for all his subsequent musical output, reserving his own name for critical and analytical writings. At around this time the composer Charles Wilfred Orr recalled Heseltine as \\"a tall fair youth of about my own age\\", trying without success to convince a sceptical Delius of the merits of Van Dieren's piano works. Orr was particularly struck by Heseltine's whistling abilities which he describes as \\"flute-like in quality and purity\\".Palmer, pp. 174‚Äì75 For the next few years Heseltine devoted most of his energy to musical criticism and journalism. In May 1919 he delivered a paper to the Musical Association, \\"The Modern Spirit in Music\\", that impressed E.J. Dent, the future Cambridge University music professor. However, much of his writing was confrontational and quarrelsome. He made dismissive comments about the current standards of musical criticism (\\"the average newspaper critic of music ... is either a shipwrecked or worn-out musician, or else a journalist too incompetent for ordinary reporting\\") which offended senior critics such as Ernest Newman. He wrote provocative articles in the Musical Times, and in July 1919 feuded with the composer-critic Leigh Henry over the music of Igor Stravinsky.Smith 1994, pp. 160‚Äì63 In a letter dated 17 July 1919, Delius advised the younger man to concentrate either on writing or composing: \\"I ... know how gifted you are and what possibilities are in you\\".Beecham, p. 180 By this time Heseltine's privately expressed opinions on Delius's music were increasingly critical, although in public he continued to sing his former mentor's praises.Smith 1994, pp. 158‚Äì59 In The Musical Times he cited Fennimore and Gerda, Delius's final opera, as \\"one of the most successful experiments in a new direction that the operatic stage has yet seen\\". Heseltine had long nurtured a scheme to launch a music magazine, which he intended to start as soon as he found appropriate backing. In April 1920, Rogers decided to replace his semi-moribund magazine The Organist and Choirmaster, with a new music journal, The Sackbut, and invited Heseltine to edit it. Heseltine presided over nine issues, adopting a style that was combative and often controversial.Rayborn, p. 160 The Sackbut also organised concerts, presenting works by Van Dieren, Sorabji, Ladmirault and others.Kemp, p. 46Smith 1994, pp. 172‚Äì73 However, Rogers withdrew his financial backing after five issues. Heseltine then struggled to run it himself for several months; in September 1921 the magazine was taken over by the publisher John Curwen, who promptly replaced Heseltine as editor with Ursula Greville.Smith 1994, pp. 176, 185 =Productive years in Wales= With no regular income, in the autumn of 1921 Heseltine returned to Cefn Bryntalch, which became his base for the next three years. He found the atmosphere there conducive to creative efforts; he told Gray that \\"Wild Wales holds an enchantment for me stronger than wine or woman\\".Smith 1994, p. 188 The Welsh years were marked by intense creative compositional and literary activity; some of Heseltine's best-known music, including the song-cycles Lilligay and The Curlew, were completed along with numerous songs, choral settings, and a string serenade composed to honour Delius's 60th birthday in 1922. Heseltine also edited and transcribed a large amount of early English music.Smith 1994, pp. 187, 217 His recognition as an emerging composer was marked by the selection of The Curlew as representing contemporary British music at the 1924 Salzburg Festival.Smith 1994, p. 216 B√©la Bart√≥k (right), with the violinist Jelly d'Ar√°nyi during their British tour, 1922 Heseltine's major literary work of this period was a biography of Delius, the first full-length study of the composer, which remained the standard work for many years.Beecham, p. 9 On its 1952 reissue, the book was described by music publisher Hubert J. Foss as \\"a work of art, a charming and penetrating study of a musical poet's mind\\".Smith 1994, p. 201 Heseltine also worked with Gray on a study of the 16th-century Italian composer Carlo Gesualdo, although disputes between the two men delayed the book's publication until 1926. While visiting Budapest in April 1921, Heseltine befriended the then little-known Hungarian composer and pianist B√©la Bart√≥k. When Bart√≥k visited Wales in March 1922 to perform in a concert, he stayed for a few days at Cefn Bryntalch. Although Heseltine continued to promote Bart√≥k's music, there are no records of further meetings after the Wales visit.Smith 1994, p. 203 Heseltine's on-off friendship with Lawrence finally died, after a thinly disguised and unflattering depiction of Heseltine and Puma (\\"Halliday\\" and \\"Pussum\\") appeared in Women in Love, published in 1922. Heseltine began legal proceedings for defamation, eventually settling out of court with the publishers, Secker and Warburg.Smith 1994, pp. 191‚Äì93 Puma, meanwhile, had disappeared from Heseltine's life. She returned from Ireland before he did, and had lived for a while with the young child Nigel at Cefn Bryntalch where the local gentry considered her \\"not of the same order of society as we are\\".Parrott, p. 61N. Heseltine, p. 107 There was no resumption of married life, and she left Heseltine sometime in 1922. In September and October 1923 Heseltine accompanied his fellow-composer E.J. Moeran on a tour of eastern England, in search of original folk music. Later that year he and Gray visited Delius at Grez.Smith 1994, pp. 212‚Äì13 In June 1924 Heseltine left Cefn Bryntalch and lived briefly in a Chelsea flat, a stay marked by wild parties and considerable damage to the property. After spending Christmas 1924 in Majorca he leased a cottage (formerly occupied by Foss) in the Kent village of Eynsford.Smith 1994, pp. 217‚Äì20 =Eynsford= The village of Eynsford in Kent, Heseltine's home between 1925 and 1928 At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\".Parrott, p. 96 The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand MƒÅori who acted as a general factotum.Smith 1994, pp. 222‚Äì27 Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine.Gray 1934, pp. 254‚Äì55 The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes. The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention.Smith 1994, pp. 220‚Äì26 However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in England. He also wrote a general study of Elizabethan music, The English Ayre.Smith 1994, pp. 234‚Äì35 In January 1927, Heseltine's string serenade was recorded for the National Gramophonic Society, by John Barbirolli and an improvised chamber orchestra. A year later, HMV recorded the ballad \\"Captain Stratton's Fancy\\", sung by Peter Dawson. These two are the only recordings of Heseltine's music released during his lifetime.Smith 1994, pp. 244, 250 His association with the poet and journalist Bruce Blunt led to the popular Christmas anthem \\"Bethlehem Down\\", which the pair wrote in 1927 to raise money for their Christmas drinking.Smith 1994, pp. 249‚Äì50 By the summer of 1928 his general lifestyle had created severe financial problems, despite his industry. In October he was forced to give up the cottage at Eynsford, and returned to Cefn Bryntalch.Smith 1994, pp. 251‚Äì52 =Final years= By November 1928, Heseltine had tired of Cefn Bryntalch, and returned to London. He sought concert reviewing and cataloguing assignments without much success; his main creative activity was the editing, under the pseudonym \\"Rab Noolas\\" (\\"Saloon Bar\\" backwards), of Merry-Go-Down, an anthology in praise of drinking. The book, published by The Mandrake Press, was copiously illustrated by Hal Collins.Smith 1994, pp. 253‚Äì56, 263 Sir Thomas Beecham, who temporarily revived Heseltine's career in 1929 Early in 1929 Heseltine received two offers from Beecham which temporarily restored his sense of purpose. Beecham had founded the Imperial League of Opera (ILO) in 1927; he now invited Heseltine to edit the ILO journal.Smith 1994, p. 259 Beecham also asked Heseltine to help organise a festival to honour Delius, which the conductor was planning for October 1929.Beecham, pp. 200‚Äì01 Although Heseltine's enthusiasm for Delius's music had diminished, he accepted the assignment, and travelled to Grez in search of forgotten compositions that could be resurrected for the festival.Jenkins, p. 43 He declared that he was delighted to discover Cynara, for voice and orchestra, abandoned since 1907.Fenby 1981, pp. 69‚Äì70 For the festival, Heseltine prepared many of the programme notes for individual concerts and supplied a concise biography of the composer.Fenby (ed.) 1987, pp. 38‚Äì63 According to Delius's wife Jelka: \\"Next to Beecham, he [Heseltine] really was the soul of the thing\\".Parrott, p. 93 At a Promenade Concert in August 1929, Heseltine conducted a performance of the Capriol Suite, the single public conducting engagement of his life. In an effort to reproduce their success with \\"Bethlehem Down\\", he and Blunt proffered a new carol for Christmas 1929, \\"The Frostbound Wood\\". Although the work was technically accomplished, it failed to achieve the popularity of its predecessor.Copley 1979, p. 141 Heseltine edited three issues of the ILO journal, but in January 1930, Beecham announced the closure of the venture, and Heseltine was out of work again.Copley 1979, p. 18 His attempt on behalf of Van Dieren to raise financing to mount a performance of the latter's opera The Tailor also failed.Smith 1994, pp. 269‚Äì70 The final summer of Heseltine's life was marked by gloom, depression, and inactivity; ApIvor refers to Heseltine's sense of \\"crimes against the spirit\\", and an obsession with imminent death. In July 1930 a fortnight spent with Blunt in Hampshire brought a brief creative revival; Heseltine composed \\"The Fox\\" to Blunt's lyrics, and on his return to London he wrote \\"The Fairest May\\" for voice and string quartet. These were his final original compositions.Smith 1994, pp. 274‚Äì75, 278Parrott, p. 37 =Death= Foreground. The unmarked grave plot, Nightingale cemetery Godalming In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.Smith 1994, pp. 276‚Äì80Gray 1934, p. 290 An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned.Gray (1934), p. 295 Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat.Smith 1994, pp. 281‚Äì83 Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory‚Äîthat his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators.Parrott, pp. 34‚Äì41 The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas. Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December. In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in July 1931 seven months after the composer's death. Sewell's mother, private secretary Mary Jessica Perkins (who subsequently married Robert Sewell in 1936), a Camden publican's daughter, was an intermittent girlfriend, a Roman Catholic who refused Heseltine's offer to pay for an abortion and subsequently blamed herself for his death. Sewell was unaware of his father's identity until 1986.Sewell, pp. 17‚Äì23 =Legacy= Heseltine's surviving body of work includes about 150 songs, mostly for solo voice and piano. He also wrote choral pieces, some with instrumental or orchestral accompaniment, and a few purely instrumental works.Copley 1979, pp. 295‚Äì309 Among lost or destroyed works the musicologist Ian Copley lists two stage pieces: sketches for the abandoned opera Liadain and Curither, and the draft of a mime-drama Twilight (1926) which Heseltine destroyed on the advice of Delius.Gray 1934, p. 142Copley 1979, pp. 291‚Äì92 Music historian Stephen Banfield described the songs as \\"polished gems of English art song forming a pinnacle of that genre's brilliant brief revival in the early 20th century ... [works of] intensity, consistency and unfailing excellence\\". According to Delius's biographer Christopher Palmer, Heseltine influenced the work of fellow-composers Moeran and Orr, and to a lesser extent Lambert and Walton, primarily by bringing them within the Delius orbit. In the case of the latter pair, Palmer argues, \\"those reminiscences of Delius which crop up from time to time in [their] music ... are more probably Delius filtered through Warlock\\".Palmer, p. 162 Heseltine biographer Brian Collins considers the composer a prime mover in the 20th-century renaissance of early English music; apart from much writing on the subject, he made well over 500 transcriptions of early works. He also wrote or contributed to ten books, and wrote dozens of general music articles and reviews. Many years later, Gray wrote of Heseltine: \\"In the memory of his friends, he is as alive now as he ever was when he trod the earth, and so he will continue to be until the last of us are dead\\".Gray 1985, p. 261 During his Eynsford years, Heseltine had provided his own epitaph: Music =Influences= In the early 20th century the German- influenced 19th-century song-writing traditions generally followed by Hubert Parry, Charles Villiers Stanford, Edward Elgar and Roger Quilter, were in a process of eclipse. For composers such as Ralph Vaughan Williams and George Butterworth, English folk-song became a dominant feature of their work;Copley 1979, pp. 49‚Äì50 at the same time, songwriters were seeking to extend their art by moving beyond the piano to develop richer forms of vocal accompaniment. Thus, as Copley observes, at the outset of his career as a composer Heseltine found in song-writing a dynamic ambience, \\"within which he could express himself, or against which he could react\\". By the time Heseltine began composing seriously, around 1915‚Äì16, he had started to shake off the overwhelming influence of Delius. He had discovered English folk-song in 1913, his Oxford year, and had begun to study Elizabethan and Jacobean music.Copley 1979, p. 34 In 1916 he came under the spell of Van Dieren, whose influence soon exceeded that of Delius and led to a significant development in compositional technique, first evident in the Saudades song cycle of 1916‚Äì17. Gray writes that from Van Dieren, Heseltine \\"learned to purify and organise his harmonic texture ... and the thick, muddy chords which characterised the early songs gave place to clear and vigorous part-writing\\".Gray 1934, p. 140 \\"In 1917‚Äì18 Heseltine's passion for Celtic culture, stimulated by his stay in Ireland, brought a new element to his music, and in 1921 he discovered Bart√≥k.Parrott, p. 28 A late passion was the music of John Dowland, the Elizabethan lutenist, one of whose dances he arranged for brass band.Smith 1994, pp. 238, 246 These constituent parts contributed to the individual style of Heseltine's music. Gray summarised this style thus; > They [the differing elements] are fused together in a curiously personal > way: the separate ingredients can be analysed and defined, but not the > ultimate product, which is not Dowland plus Van Dieren or Elizabethan plus > modern, but simply something wholly individual and unanalysable‚ÄîPeter > Warlock. No one else could have written it.Gray 1934, p. 245 Apart from those within his circle, Heseltine drew inspiration from other composers whose work he respected: Franz Liszt, Gabriel Faur√©, and Claude Debussy. He had, however, a particular dislike for the works of his fellow song-writer Hugo Wolf. Heseltine's songs demonstrate moods of both darkness and warm good humour, a dichotomy that helped to fuel the idea of a split Warlock/Heseltine personality. This theory was rejected by the composer's friends and associates, who tended to see the division in terms of \\"Philip drunk or Philip sober\\". =General character= In a summary of the Warlock oeuvre, Copley asserts that Heseltine was a natural melodist in the Schubert mould: \\"With very few exceptions his melodies will stand on their own ... they can be sung by themselves with no accompaniment, as complete and satisfing as folk-songs\\".Copley 1979, p. 255 Copley identifies certain characteristic motifs or \\"fingerprints\\", which recur throughout the works and which are used to depict differences of mood and atmosphere: anguish, resignation but also warmth, tenderness and amorous dalliance.Copley 1979, pp. 260‚Äì63 The music critic Ernest Bradbury comments that Heseltine's songs \\"serve both singer and poet, the one in their memorably tuneful vocal lines, the other in a scrupulous regard for correct accentuation free from any suggestion of pedantry\\". In musical parlance Heseltine was a miniaturist, a title which he was happy to accept in disregard of the sometimes derogatory implications of the label: \\"I have neither the impulse nor the ability to erect monuments before which a new generation will bow down\\".Gray 1934, p. 24 He was almost entirely self-taught, avoiding through his lack of a formal conservatory training the \\"teutonic shadow\\"‚Äîthe influence of the German masters.Copley 1979, p. 253 To the charge that his technique was \\"amateurish\\",Copley 1979, pp. 263‚Äì64 he responded by arguing that a composer should express himself in his own terms, not by \\"string[ing] together a number of tags and clich√©s culled from the work of others\\". His compositions were themselves part of a learning process; The Curlew song cycle originated in 1915 with the setting of a Yeats poem,Smith 1994, p. 105 but did not reach completion until 1922. Brian Collins characterises this work as \\"a chronicle of [the composer's] progress and development\\". =Critical appraisal= Heseltine's music was generally well received by public and critics. The first Warlock compositions to attract critical attention were three of the Dublin songs which Rogers published in 1918. William Child in The Musical Times thought these \\"first rate\\", and singled out \\"If Ever I Saw\\" as having particular distinction.The Musical Times review, November 1919, quoted in Copley 1979, p. 66 In 1922, in the same magazine, the short song cycle Mr Belloc's Fancy was likewise praised, especially \\"Warlock's rattling good tunes and appropriately full-blooded accompaniment\\".The Musical Times review, September 1922, quoted in Copley 1979, p. 83 Ralph Vaughan Williams was delighted with the reception accorded to the Three Carols, when he conducted the Bach Choir at the Queen's Hall in December 1923.Smith 1994, p. 214 Early in 1925 the BBC broadcast a performance of the Serenade for string orchestra written to honour Delius, a sign, says Smith, that the music establishment was beginning to take Warlock seriously.Smith 1994, p. 228 Heseltine himself noted the warmth of the Prom audience's reaction to his conducting of the Capriol Suite in 1929: \\"I was recalled four times\\".Smith 1994, p. 263 After Heseltine's death, assessments of his musical stature were generous. Newman considered some of Heseltine's choral compositions \\"among the finest music written for massed voices by a modern Englishman.\\" Constant Lambert hailed him as \\"one of the greatest song- writers that music has ever known\\",Smith 1994, p. 289 a view echoed by Copley.Copley 1979, p. 265 In a tribute published in The Musical Times, Van Dieren referred to Heseltine's music as \\"a national treasure\\" that would long survive all that was currently being said or written about it. In subsequent years his standing as a composer diminished; Brian Collins records how public perceptions of Warlock were distorted by the scandalous reports of his private life, so that his musical importance in the inter-war years became obscured. However, when the Peter Warlock Society was created in 1963, interest in his music began to increase. Collins acknowledges that the Warlock output includes much that can be dismissed as mere programme-fillers and encore items, but these do not detract from numerous works of the highest quality, \\"frequently thrilling and passionate and, occasionally, innovative to the point of being revolutionary\\". Writings As well as a large output of musical journalism and criticism, Heseltine wrote or was significantly involved in the production of 10 books or long pamphlets:Copley 1979, pp. 276‚Äì82 * Frederick Delius (1923).

The plot of the film follows a game designer named Allegra Geller, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, who finds herself targeted by assassins while playing a virtual reality game of her own creation. An international co-production between Canada, the United Kingdom, and France, it also stars Jude Law, Ian Holm, Don McKellar, Callum Keith Rennie, Sarah Polley, Christopher Eccleston, Willem Dafoe, and Robert A. Silverman. The film received mostly positive reviews upon release. Cronenberg was awarded a Silver Bear for Outstanding Artistic Contribution at the 49th Berlin International Film Festival for the film. Plot In the near-future, biotechnological virtual reality game consoles known as \\"game pods\\" have replaced electronic ones. The pods present \\"UmbyCords\\" that attach to \\"bio- ports\\", connectors surgically inserted into players' spines. Two game companies, Antenna Research and Cortical Systematics, compete against each other. In addition, a group of fanatics called Realists fight both companies to prevent the \\"deforming\\" of reality. Antenna Research's Allegra Geller, a world renowned game designer, is demonstrating her latest virtual reality game, eXistenZ, to a focus group. A Realist named Noel Dichter shoots Allegra in the shoulder with an organic pistol he smuggled past security. As Dichter is gunned down by the security team, security guard and publicist Ted Pikul rushes to Geller and escorts her outside. Geller discovers that her pod, which contains the only copy of eXistenZ, may have been damaged. Pikul reluctantly agrees to have a bio-port installed in his spine so they can test the integrity of the game together. Allegra takes him to a gas station run by a black-marketeer named Gas, who deliberately installs a faulty bio-port. He reveals his intention to kill Geller for the bounty on her head. Pikul kills Gas, and the two escape to a former ski lodge used by Kiri Vinokur, Geller's mentor. Vinokur and his assistant repair the damaged pod and give Pikul a new bio-port. Geller and Pikul enter the game, and meet with D'Arcy Nader, a video game shop owner, who provides them with new \\"micro pods\\". They activate the new pods and enter a deeper layer of virtual reality. They assume new identities as workers in a game pod factory. Another worker in the factory, Yevgeny Nourish, claims to be their Realist contact. At a Chinese restaurant near the factory, Nourish recommends that they order the special for lunch. Pikul eats the unappetizing special, and constructs a pistol out of the inedible parts. In jest, he threatens Geller, then shoots the Chinese waiter. When the pair return to the game store, Hugo Carlaw informs them that Nourish is actually a double agent for Cortical Systematics, and the waiter Pikul murdered was the actual contact. At the factory, they find a diseased pod. Geller connects it to her bio-port as part of a plan to infect the other pods and sabotage the factory. When Geller quickly becomes ill, Pikul cuts the UmbyCord, but she begins to bleed to death. Nourish appears with a flamethrower and blasts the diseased pod, which bursts into deadly spores. Geller and Pikul awaken back at the ski lodge, where they discover Geller's game pod is also diseased. Geller surmises that Pikul's new bio-port must have been infected by Vinokur to destroy her game. She inserts a disinfecting device into Pikul's bioport. Unexpectedly, Carlaw reappears as a Realist resistance fighter and escorts Geller and Pikul outside to witness the death of eXistenZ. Before Carlaw can kill Geller, he is shot in the back by Vinokur, who is a double agent for Cortical Systematics. He informs Geller that he copied her game data while he was fixing her pod. In revenge, she kills Vinokur. Pikul then reveals that he himself is a Realist sent to kill her. Geller tells Pikul she had known his intentions since he pointed the gun at her in the Chinese restaurant, and she remotely detonates the disinfecting device in his bioport, killing him. Suddenly, Pikul and Geller are seated in chairs in a small abandoned church, seeing rows of pews as they come to, together with all of the other members of the cast, all wearing blue electronic virtual reality devices. Nourish explains that the story was all part of a virtual reality game he designed called transCendenZ. He tells his assistant Merle that he feels uneasy, because the anti-game plot elements may have originated from the thoughts of one of the testers. Pikul and Geller approach Nourish and accuse him of distorting reality, before shooting him and Merle to death. As Pikul and Geller leave, they aim their guns at the person who played the Chinese waiter, who first pleads for his life, then asks if they are still in the game. Pikul and Geller stand together in silence, not answering. Cast Production The film's plot came about after Cronenberg conducted an interview with Salman Rushdie for Shift magazine in 1995. At the time, Rushdie was in hiding due to a Fatwa being put on his life by Muslim extremists due to his controversial book The Satanic Verses. Rushdie's dilemma gave Cronenberg an idea of \\"a Fatwa against a virtual-reality game designer\\". Existenz was originally pitched to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but they did not green-light the film due to its complex structure. Novelizations * Christopher Priest wrote the tie-in novel to accompany the movie Existenz, the theme of which has much in common with some of Priest's own novels. * In 1999, a graphic novel credited to David Cronenberg and Sean Scoffield was published. Reception The film received generally positive reviews, with a 74% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes. The site's summary stated of the film: \\"Gooey, slimy, grotesque fun.\\" Metacritic assigned a score of 68 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four in his review of the film, noting its release after fellow science-fiction film The Matrix. He compared the two films, stating that while both have special effects, Cronenberg's film was stranger along with having his best effects involve \\"gooey, indescribable organic things\\". Conversely, James Berardinelli gave the film a two out of four star rating in his review. He cites that the film had a \\"disjointed feel\\", and called it a \\"missed opportunity\\" that suffered from being released near The Matrix and Open Your Eyes, which he states did similar things that were accomplished better in those films.

It collects and publishes information about the French economy and people and carries out the periodic national census. Headquartered in Montrouge, a commune in the southern Parisian suburbs, it is the French branch of Eurostat. The INSEE was created in 1946 as a successor to the Vichy regime's National Statistics Service (SNS). It works in close cooperation with the Institut national d'√©tudes d√©mographiques (INED).  Purpose  INSEE is responsible for the production and analysis of official statistics in France. Its best known responsibilities include: * Organising and publishing the national census. * Producing various indices ‚Äì which are widely recognised as being of excellent quality ‚Äì including an inflation index used for determining the rates of rents and the costs associated with construction. * Eurostat uses INSEE statistics in combination with those of other national statistical agencies to compile comparable statistics for the European Union as a whole. It is also widely recognized as representing France on international questions of statistics.  Organisation  The INSEE is the responsibility of MINEFI, the French Ministry of Finance. The current director is Jean-Luc Tavernier.

Codes and numbering system  INSEE gives numerical indexing codes (French: les Codes INSEE) to various entities in France: * INSEE codes (known as COG) are given to various administrative units, notably the French communes (they do not coincide with postcodes). The 'complete' code has 8 digits and 3 spaces within, but there is a popular 'simplified' code with 5 digits and no space within: ** 2 digits (d√©partement) and 3 digits (commune) for the 96 d√©partements of Metropolitan France. ** 3 digits (d√©partement or collectivity) and 2 digits (commune) for the Overseas departments, Overseas Territorial Collectivities and Overseas Countries and Territories. See also: :fr:Code INSEE#Code communal. * INSEE numbers (13 digits + a two-digit key) are national identification numbers given to people. The format is as follows: syymmlllllooo kk, where ** s is 1 for a male, 2 for a female for a permanent number; it is 7 for a male, 8 for a female for a temporary number, ** yy are the last two digits of the year of birth, ** mm is the month of birth or a number above 20 if the birthdate is unknown ** lllll is the COG for the location of birth, ** ooo is an order number to distinguish people being born at the same place in the same year and month. ** 'kk' is the \\"control key\\", equal to 97-(the rest of the number modulo 97).

In 1833, the Statistics Bureau (French: Bureau de la statistique) was created by Adolphe Thiers. In 1840 it was renamed SGF or General Statistics of France.French: Statistique G√©n√©rale de la France Under the direction of Lucien March, the SGF expanded its activities. It began an investigation of consumption habits in 1907, following with periodic investigations on retail prices in 1911. In 1920 Alfred Sauvy introduced competitive entrance exams for SGF recruitment. However, it was Ren√© Carmille, a pioneer of the use of the calculators, who laid the foundations of the modern organization. In 1940, the Demographic Service (Service de la d√©mographie) was created under the Ministry of Finance in order to replace the military recruitment office prohibited by the June 1940 Armistice with Nazi Germany. In order to better conceal its undertakings, the Demographic Service absorbed the SGF on 11 October 1941. The new organization was called the SNS or National Statistics Service.French: Service National des Statistiques As part of this reorganization, six new offices were created in the Northern (occupied) zone whose regional structure is maintained today in INSEE. Ren√© Carmille created an Applied Sciences School (predecessor of the current ENSAE) to specially train members for the SNS. Carmille worked for Vichy France but he was actually a double agent for the French underground. From his position in the SNS he sabotaged the Nazi census of France, which saved untold numbers of Jewish people from death camps. He also used his department to help mobilize French resistance in Algeria.

The main railway line linking Ourense to Madrid passes through mountains north of the town, but the nearest station is at La Gudi√±a, 31 km to the east. Ver√≠n is a town of services with declining agricultural activity. There is a denominated wine region--Monterrey--located in the surrounding area. There are also three mineral water bottling plants in the town: Cabreiro√°, Fontenova and Sousas. Carnival here is one of the most original in Spain with the Cigarr√≥n, masked figures running through the streets brandishing whips and making an interesting sound caused by cow bells tied to their waists (See zanpantzar for a similar tradition in the Pyrenees). Everything has a medieval air, with little influence from the Brazilian-style carnival, which has become popular in other Spanish and Portuguese cities. Ver√≠n has one major tourist sight, which is Monterrey Castle, a huge complex looming over the rather non-descript urban area. To reach the castle you drive about two kilometers in the direction of Ourense on the old highway, turning off on the right to climb two kilometers, passing a winery on the left. There is a parador next to the castle. Monterrey Castle played an important role throughout the Portuguese- Spanish wars, having been strategically built on the frontier for the purpose. It was more than a castle since included within the perimeter were a monastery, a hospital and a small town which was abandoned in the 19th century. The castle itself is more impressive from afar than at closer look, but the view from the heights is worth the drive up.

He served as Prime Minister under Fran√ßois Mitterrand from 1988 to 1991, during which he created the Revenu minimum d'insertion (RMI), a social minimum welfare program for indigents, and achieved the Matignon Accords regarding the status of New Caledonia. He was a member of the European Parliament, and was strongly involved in European policies until 2009. In 2007, he joined a Commission under the authority of Nicolas Sarkozy's Minister of Education, Xavier Darcos.David Wilsford, ed. Political leaders of contemporary Western Europe: a biographical dictionary (Greenwood, 1995) pp 387-93 Early life and education Rocard was born in Courbevoie, Hauts-de-Seine, to a Protestant family, the son of nuclear physicist Yves Rocard. He entered politics as a student leader whilst studying at Sciences Po. He became chair of the French Socialist Students affiliated to the main French Socialist party at the time, the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), and studied at the √âcole nationale d'administration (ENA), after which he chose to enter the prestigious Inspection des finances. As an anti-colonialist, he went to Algeria and wrote a report regarding the widely ignored refugee camps of the Algerian War (1954‚Äì62). This report was leaked to the newspapers Le Monde and France Observateur in April 1959, almost costing Rocard his job. Unified Socialist Party Having left the SFIO because of Guy Mollet's position towards the Algerian war, he led the dissident Unified Socialist Party (PSU) from 1967 to 1974. He was a prominent figure during the May 68 crisis, supporting the auto- gestionary project. He ran in the 1969 presidential election but obtained only 3.6% of the vote. Some months later, he was elected deputy for the Yvelines d√©partement, defeating the former Prime minister Maurice Couve de Murville. He lost his parliamentary seat in 1973, but retook it in 1978. In 1973‚Äì74, he participated in the LIP conflict, selling watches with the workers and participating, behind the scenes, in the attempts to find an employer who would take back the factory, which was on the verge of being liquidated.\\"Ils voulaient un patron, pas une coop√©rative ouvri√®re\\" , Le Monde, interview with Rocard, 20 March 2007 Socialist Party In 1974, he joined Fran√ßois Mitterrand and the renewed Socialist Party (PS), which had replaced the old SFIO. Most of the PSU members and a part of the French and Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT) trade union ‚Äì the non-Marxist section of the left that Rocard famously defined as the \\"Second Left\\" ‚Äì followed him. Michel Rocard, October 1981 Elected mayor of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in 1977, he led the opposition to Mitterrand inside the Socialist Party (as a candidate of the right-wing of the party). After the defeat of the left at the 1978 legislative election, he tried to take over the leadership of the party. In spite of his alliance with Pierre Mauroy, the number 2 of the PS, he lost at the Metz Congress (1979). As the Socialist Party's most popular politician at the time (including Mitterrand himself), he announced that he would run for president; but his \\"Call of Conflans\\" did not result in majority support within the PS, and he withdrew his candidacy. Mitterrand was the successful Socialist candidate in the 1981 presidential election. From the 1970s to the 1990s, Rocard's group inside the Socialist Party, known as \\"les rocardiens\\", advocated a re-alignment of French socialism through a clearer acceptance of the market economy, more decentralisation and less state control. It was largely influenced by Scandinavian social democracy, and stood in opposition to Mitterrand's initial agenda of nationalization, programmed in the 110 Propositions for France. Nonetheless, the \\"rocardiens\\" always remained a minority. =In government= Under Mitterrand's first presidency, he was Minister of Territorial Development and Minister of Planning from 1981 to 1983 and Minister of Agriculture from 1983 to 1985. He resigned from the cabinet in due to his opposition to the introduction of the proportional system for the legislative elections. He hoped, in vain, that Mitterrand would not run for re-election so he could be the PS candidate in the 1988 presidential election. After Mitterrand's re-election, he was chosen as Prime Minister (May 1988 ‚Äì May 1991). Indeed, Rocard was popular and his position, on the right-wing of the PS, corresponded with the slogan of the electoral campaign, \\"a United France\\". He formed a cabinet including 4 center-right ministers. As Prime Minister, he led the Matignon Accords regarding the status of New Caledonia, which ended the troubles in this overseas territory. His record in office also include a decrease in unemployment and a large-scale reform of the welfare state's financing system. He created a minimum social assistance scheme, the RMI, which helped to alleviate poverty.The History of France by Professor W Scott Haine =Party leadership= Rocard's poor relations with Mitterrand, notably during his mandate as Prime Minister, were notorious. In addition, the Socialists only held a small parliamentary majority. In 1991, when his popularity decreased, President Mitterrand forced him to resign. However, according to Mauroy, who led the party, Rocard stood as the \\"natural candidate\\" for the following presidential elections. After the 1993 electoral disaster, he became leader of the PS by advocating a political \\"big-bang\\", that was to say a questioning of the left/right divide. His speech did not have the desired effect. Rocard remained as leader of the Socialist Party for only one year, in part because of the PS's complete defeat during the 1994 European elections. The defeat was in part due to the success of the list of the Left Radicals Movement, which was covertly supported by President Mitterrand. Consequently, he was toppled by the left-wing of the party and lost his last chance to run for president the next year. Having lost his deputy's seat in 1993, he became Senator of Yvelines from 1995 to 1997. His supporters within the Socialist Party became allies of candidate Lionel Jospin, who was Prime Minister in 1997‚Äì2002, and then Dominique Strauss-Kahn. =Member of European Parliament= Rocard was a member of the European Parliament (1994‚Äì2009), and chaired the Committee on Development and Cooperation (1997‚Äì1999), the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (1999‚Äì2002) and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport. Michel Rocard was known for his hostility for proposed directives to allow software patents in Europe, and has been an outspoken opponent of what he considers to be manoeuvres to force the decision on this issue.¬´ Tout le monde se copie et c'est bien ainsi ¬ª, Freescape, 30 June 2003 On the French political scene, Rocard presented himself as the political heir of Pierre Mend√®s-France, known for his moral rigour, and as the politician who \\"speaks the truth\\". After Mitterrand's death, he caused controversy when he said, about the former president, \\"he was not an honest man\\". An impersonator mocked him for his problems of elocution. In the run up to the presidential elections in 2007, Rocard called for an alliance between the Socialists and the centrist Union for French Democracy (UDF) party of Fran√ßois Bayrou in an effort to defeat Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) candidate Nicolas Sarkozy. S√©gol√®ne Royal, the PS candidate, rejected any such compromise, lamenting that she was once again obliged to face obstacles from within her own party. Rocard also publicly admitted, after the election, having asked S√©gol√®ne Royal to step down in his favor in March 2007, one month before the first round of voting. Like other Socialist politicians, such as Jack Lang or Hubert V√©drine, who accepted similar positions, Rocard accepted a post on the Committee on the re- evaluation of the teaching profession, which was placed under the \\"high authority\\" of Sarkozy's Minister of Education Xavier Darcos.L'ouverture politique √† gauche se poursuit avec Michel Rocard, Reuters, 29 August 2007 (13h22), mirrored by Le Monde Criticized by Medhi Ouraoui, national delegate of the PS, Rocard claimed it was a \\"democrat's duty\\" to participate in such Commissions and that he was \\"not concerned\\" by the \\"game of the President of the Republic [consisting of making of such left-wing participations] political symbols\\". He furthermore explained that he had accepted to speak before the Gracques' spring university (a group of senior left-wing civil servants who advocated a centrist strategy) because political parties were not suited any more to serious reflexion. Finally, he again claimed that the (Marxist) SFIO had been created in 1905 on a fundamental \\"ambiguity\\", that of whether to accept or reject market economy. He remained active in European Union politics as late as June 2014, when he delivered his thoughts on the British on the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy. Rocard quoted Churchill's words about the \\"United States of Europe\\", issued a strong condemnation of the UK policy of the 40 years to that date, and begged for a European strongman, which he saw in Martin Schulz. He concluded by inviting the UK to leave.\\"A French message to Britain: get out of Europe before you wreck it\\" The Guardian. 6 June 2014 (reprint of 5 June column in Le Monde) Rocard was also a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations.

Health and death In June 2007, Rocard was admitted to the Calcutta Medical Research Institute, Kolkata, India where doctors found he had a blood clot in the brain and was operated upon. He was discharged from the hospital on 10 July 2007.Victime d'une h√©morragie c√©r√©brale, Michel Rocard se remet doucement, Le Monde, 3 July 2007 On 30 March 2012, Rocard was on a visit to Stockholm, Sweden to attend a meeting regarding the Arctic Council. During a break at noon, he became ill and was taken to the Karolinska University Hospital. Doctors decided later that day that Rocard should spend the night at the hospital's intensive-care medicine unit for observation. Rocard died on 2 July 2016 in Paris, at the age of 85.

This includes one television movie and multiple specials, and encompasses stories over 38 seasons. Additionally, four charity specials and two animated serials have also been aired. The programme's high episode count has resulted in Doctor Who holding the world record for the highest number of episodes of a science-fiction programme. In May 2017, it was announced that BBC Worldwide sold the right of refusal on future series of the programme until and including Series 15 in China. Doctor Who ceased production in 1989, then resumed in 2005. The original series (1963‚Äì1989), generally consists of multi- episode serials. The 2005 revival trades the earlier serial format for a run of self-contained episodes, interspersed with occasional multi-part stories and structured into loose story arcs. The story numbers below are not official designations; they are meant as a rough guide to placement in the overall context of the programme. There is some dispute, for instance, about whether to count Season 23's The Trial of a Time Lord as one or as four serials, and whether the unfinished serial Shada should be included. The numbering scheme in this list reflects an internal practice of describing \\"Planet of the Dead\\" (2009) as the 200th story. Other sources, such as the Region 1 classic Doctor Who DVD releases, use different numbering schemes, which diverge after the 108th story, The Horns of Nimon (1979‚Äì1980). Series overview The following table dictates the season or series in question for the programme as a whole. =Regular seasons= =Specials= Episodes =Ninth Doctor= In 2005, the BBC relaunched Doctor Who after a 16-year absence from episodic television, with Russell T Davies, Julie Gardner and Mal Young as executive producers, Phil Collinson as producer, and Christopher Eccleston taking the lead role of the Ninth Doctor. The revival is a continuation of the original series. The new series is formatted to a 16:9 widescreen display ratio, and a standard episode length of 45 minutes. For the first time since the 1965‚Äì1966 season, each episode has a title, and most stand alone as complete stories. The show also returned to its traditional Saturday evening slot. Series 1 (2005) The 2005 series constitutes a loose story arc, dealing with the consequences of the Time War and the mysterious Bad Wolf. =Tenth Doctor= The Tenth Doctor was portrayed by David Tennant, who was cast before the first series aired. Series 2 (2006) The back-story for the spin-off series Torchwood is \\"seeded\\" in various episodes in the 2006 series. Each episode also has an accompanying online Tardisode. Series 3 (2007) This series introduces Martha Jones and deals with the Face of Boe's final message, the mysterious Mr. Saxon, and the Doctor dealing with the loss of Rose Tyler. Series 4 (2008) This series explores the coincidences binding the Doctor and Donna together. There is also the loose story arc of the planets disappearing and bees also disappearing. Specials (2008‚Äì2010) The specials focus on the \\"four knocks\\" and the death of the Tenth Doctor. From \\"Planet of the Dead\\", episodes were filmed in HD. =Eleventh Doctor= The Eleventh Doctor was portrayed by Matt Smith. Steven Moffat took over as showrunner from the fifth series. Series 5 (2010) This series deals with cracks spreading throughout time, the Pandorica and the Silence which is mentioned in various episodes. Series 6 (2011) The series centres on River Song's relation to the Doctor, the Doctor's \\"death\\" and discovering what the Silence is. The original transmission of series 6 was split into two parts, with the first seven episodes airing April to June 2011 and the final six from late August to October 2011. Series 7 (2012‚Äì2013) Series 7 started with five episodes and a Christmas Special in late 2012, followed by eight episodes in 2013. The series dealt with the exit of the Ponds, the Great Intelligence and the mystery of Clara Oswald, the impossible girl. Specials (2013) The specials focus on various incarnations of the Doctor, including the reveal of the War Doctor and his actions during the Time War. =Twelfth Doctor= The Twelfth Doctor was portrayed by Peter Capaldi. Series 8 (2014) For Series 8‚Äì10, the episode count was reduced from thirteen to twelve. This series dealt with the mystery identity of the character \\"Missy\\" and the mystery around \\"The Promised Land\\". Series 9 (2015) This series dealt with the consequences of the Doctor and Clara‚Äôs relationship, and the Doctor‚Äôs confession about the Hybrid. Series 10 (2017) This series dealt with the mystery of the vault and the Doctor‚Äôs oath, later exploring the Doctor and Missy‚Äôs relationship, and the possibility of Missy \\"turning good\\". This season introduces Bill Potts (Pearl Mackie) and Nardole (Matt Lucas) as The Doctor's companions. =Thirteenth Doctor= The Thirteenth Doctor is portrayed by Jodie Whittaker. Chris Chibnall took over as showrunner from the eleventh series. Series 11 (2018) For Series 11, the episode count was reduced from twelve to ten. The Thirteenth Doctor initially searches for her lost TARDIS, inadvertently bringing her companions with her on her travels, who contemplate returning to their lives but decide to continue travelling. The series also deals with grief. Series 12 (2020) This series deals with a new incarnation of the Master, the return of Jack Harkness, the appearance of an unknown incarnation of the Doctor who existed at some point before the Time War, and the \\"lone Cyberman\\", while following the destruction of Gallifrey and the secret of the Timeless Child.

The ENA selects and undertakes initial training of senior French officials. It is considered to be one of the most academically exceptional French schools, both because of its low acceptance rates and because a large majority of its candidates have already graduated from other elite schools in the country. Thus, within French society, the ENA stands as one of the main pathways to high positions in the public and private sectors. Originally located in Paris, it has now been almost completely relocated to Strasbourg to emphasise its European character. It is based in the former Commanderie Saint-Jean, though continues to maintain a Paris campus. ENA produces around 80 to 90 graduates every year, known as √©tudiants- fonctionnaires, \\"enaos\\" or \\"√©narques\\" () for short. In 2002 the Institut international d'administration publique (IIAP) which educated French diplomats under a common structure with the ENA was merged with it. The ENA shares several traditions with the College of Europe, which was established shortly after. The future of ENA is uncertain; on 25 April 2019, the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, promised that he would close ENA. Macron is an ENA graduate himself, but the tight network of ENA graduates influencing the French civil service has been decried by populist protests such as the gilets jaunes as an elite governing class out of touch with civilians.  History  = Founding = The Commanderie Saint-Jean, home of the √âcole nationale d'administration The √âcole Nationale d'Administration was formally established in October 1945 at the decree of Michel Debr√© as part of his project to reform the recruitment and training of high-ranking officials. The ENA was designed to democratize access to the higher ranks of the French civil service. Until then, each ministry had its own hiring process and selection standards. The examinations for particular ministries were often extremely specialized, meaning that few candidates possessed the knowledge to pass. In addition, the narrow expertise required meant few officials were capable of serving in a variety of roles. The school was designed to broaden and standardize the training provided to senior public servants, and to ensure they possessed extensive knowledge of policy and governance. Debr√©'s stated intention was to create ‚Äúa body of officials proven to be highly competent, especially in financial, economic and social matters.‚Äù The new system, based on academic proficiency and competitive examination, was also intended to guard against nepotism and make recruitment to top positions more transparent. Access to senior positions of the French civil service is threefold: first, through generalist civil service positions; second, through \\"technical\\" (engineering) positions; and third, through internal promotion. = Relocation to Strasbourg = In November 1991 the government of Prime Minister √âdith Cresson announced that the ENA would be relocated to Strasbourg. The Commanderie Saint-Jean, a former barracks and prison dating back to the 14th century, was chosen as its new site. The move was designed to emphasize the school's symbolic proximity to the numerous European institutions based in the city. However, though the school was officially relocated, it maintained many of its facilities in Paris. It remained split between the two cities, requiring students to complete studies in both locations, until it was fully re-located to Strasbourg in January 2005. In 2002, it was merged with the Institut international d‚Äôadministration publique (IIAP) with the aim of increasing its international profile. =Closing= In April 2019, it was claimed that a leaked speech to be delivered by French President Macron would announce that ENA would be closed as part of the solution to the Gilets Jaunes crisis. On 25 April 2019, President Emmanuel Macron confirmed that he will close ENA.  Recruitment and exit procedures  Admission to the ENA is granted based on a competitive examination taking place from the end of August to November, which people generally take after completing studies at the Institut d'√©tudes politiques de Paris or any Pr√©p'Ena (preparatory classes for the ENA examination for people coming from universities or grandes √©coles). The \\"concours externe\\" exam is divided into two parts: : The written part includes: ::* An essay on public law; ::* An essay on economics; ::* An essay on a question about the role of public institutions and their relations with the society ::* A note de synth√®se (analyzing a 25 page document and proposing a brief for a Senior Executive [Minister or Director]) on Social Law and Policies (Questions Sociales); ::* Three questions on Public Finance. : The oral exam, taken only by those with the highest marks at the written exam, consists of: ::* An oral examination on International Politics (Questions Internationales); ::* An oral examination on Questions Europ√©ennes (European Law and Policies); ::* An English oral test; ::* A collective exam, simulating a case in management to assess interaction skills; ::* A 45-minute entrance exam, known as Grand Oral since any question can be asked, based on the CV given by the candidate. Results of this exam process are published by the end of December. Other exam processes govern admission for career civil servants (concours interne) and for all other people, already active in business, political or union activities (troisi√®me concours). Following a two-year intensive programme combining high-responsibility internships and examinations, the ENA ranks students according to their results. Students are then asked, by order of merit, the position/body they want to join. Top-ranked students (between 12 and 15 students) usually join the so-called \\"grands corps\\" Inspection g√©n√©rale des finances, Conseil d'√âtat or Cour des comptes, usually followed by the French Treasury and the diplomatic service. Other students will join various ministries and administrative justice or pr√©fectures. To quote the ENA's site: :In fact, although these famous alumni are the most visible, the majority are largely unknown, lead quiet and useful careers in our civil service, and don't recognise themselves in the stereotyped images about our school.  Promotions  Academic years at the ENA are known as promotions, and are named by the students after outstanding French people (Vauban, Saint-Exup√©ry, Rousseau), Foreigners (Mandela), characters (Cyrano de Bergerac), battles (Valmy), concepts (Croix de Lorraine, Droits de l'homme) or values (libert√©-√©galit√©-fraternit√©). This tradition comes from old French military academies such as the Ecole Sp√©ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr. The Promotion Voltaire of 1980 has attracted particular attention, since numerous graduates that year went on to become significant figures in French politics. Fran√ßois Hollande, Dominique de Villepin, S√©gol√®ne Royal, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres and Michel Sapin were all members of this promotion.  Ranking  In 2011, the Mines ParisTech: Professional Ranking of World Universities ranked the ENA third in France and ninth in the world according to the number of alumni holding the position of CEO at Fortune Global 500 companies. In 2013, a Times Higher Education ranking that ordered universities according to the same metric placed the ENA sixth in the world.  Alumni  Few √©narques (around 1%) actually get involved in politics. Most ENA alumni hold apolitical, technical positions in the French civil service. Researchers at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique have shown that many ENA alumni become business executives in France. French law makes it relatively easy for civil servants to enter politics: civil servants who are elected or appointed to a political position do not have to resign their position in the civil service; instead, they are put in a situation of \\"temporary leave\\" known as disponibilit√©. If they are not re-elected or reappointed, they may ask for their reintegration into their service (well- known examples include Lionel Jospin and Philippe S√©guin). In addition, ENA graduates are often recruited as aides by government ministers and other politicians; this makes it easier for some of them to enter a political career. As an example, Dominique de Villepin entered politics as an appointed official, after serving as an aide to Jacques Chirac, without ever having held an elected position. The ENA also participates in international Technical Assistance programmes, funded by the EU or other donors. Since its creation 60 years ago, the ENA has trained 5600 French senior officials and 2600 foreigners. Some famous alumni include: * Head of state: Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing (France), Jacques Chirac (France), Fran√ßois Hollande (France), Emmanuel Macron (France), Nic√©phore Soglo (Benin), Adly Mansour (Egypt, acting), Paul Biya (Cameroon) * Head of government: Edouard Philippe (France), Laurent Fabius (France), Michel Rocard (France), √âdouard Balladur (France), Alain Jupp√© (France), Lionel Jospin (France), Dominique de Villepin (France), Edem Kodjo (Togo), Alfred Sant (Malta), Andr√© Milongo (Republic of the Congo), Patrick Leclercq (Monaco), Jean-Paul Proust (Monaco), Brigi Rafini (Niger). * Industry leaders: Guillaume Pepy (CEO of SNCF), Michel Bon (former CEO of Carrefour and France Telecom), Jean-Marie Messier, Ernest-Antoine Seilli√®re, Louis Schweitzer, G√©rard Mestrallet, Louis Gallois (former CEO of EADS), Henri de Castries (former CEO of Axa), Baudouin Prot, Frederic Oud√©a, Fr√©d√©ric Lemoine, Pierre-Andr√© de Chalendar (CEO of Saint-Gobain), Claire Dorland- Clauzel. * Current French ministers: √âdouard Philippe (Prime Minister), Florence Parly and Bruno Le Maire..http://www.lepoint.fr/presidentielle/bruno- le-maire-l-enarque-qui-veut-supprimer-l-ena-01-09-2016-2065142_3121.php * Former French ministers: Michel Sapin or S√©gol√®ne Royal (typically one-third of every French cabinet since the 1960s and one-half of the Cabinet for recent administrations until Sarkozy's were alumni of the ENA). * Other political leaders: Pavel Fischer (Ambassador of the Czech Republic to France 2003‚Äì2010, Czech presidential candidate 2018, ended third), Milos Alcalay (Venezuelan diplomat), Tea Tsulukiani (Minister of Justice of Georgia), French left-wing: Jean-Pierre Chev√®nement, √âlisabeth Guigou, Christian Paul, French right-wing: Laurent Wauquiez, Jean-Fran√ßois Cop√©, Val√©rie P√©cresse, French far-right: Fran√ßois Asselineau, Florian Philippot. * International organisations presidents: Pascal Lamy (WTO), Jean-Claude Trichet (ECB), Michel Camdessus (IMF), Jacques de Larosi√®re (IMF and EBRD), Pierre Moscovici (European Commissioner). * Intellectuals: Fran√ßoise Chandernagor, Jean-Fran√ßois Deniau, Gabriel de Broglie, Jacques Attali.  International cooperation  = Uzbekistan = An agreement was signed in Paris on 16 October 2012 between the ENA and the Uzbek Academy of administration; it allows for cooperation in the modernization of state administration and improving skills of public servants in Uzbekistan. The first cooperation was due to begin in January 2013.  Criticism  Critics have accused the ENA of educating a narrow ruling class who are prone to groupthink and averse to alternative perspectives. According to these critics, the ENA discourages its students from innovative thinking and pushes them to take conventional, middle-of-the-road positions. Peter Gumbel, a British academic, has claimed that France's grande √©cole system, and especially the ENA, has the effect of perpetuating an intellectually brilliant yet out-of-touch ruling elite. Yannick Blanc, a former senior civil servant, has also suggested that √©narques have often been too ‚Äòintellectually conformist'. Some French politicians such as Bruno Le Maire and Fran√ßois Bayrou have proposed abolishing the ENA.

This article's focus is the modern Western square dance club, and it is understood in the context of this article that when the terms \\"square dance club\\" or \\"square dance\\" are used it refers to the form of square dance called \\"modern Western square dance\\". Square dance clubs are primarily, but not exclusively, local in character. A square dance club is only as strong as its members, i.e. individual square dancers.  Promoting and advancing square dance  The club's primary goal is to promote and advance square dance as a recreational activity. Typically clubs accomplish this goal through the following activities: * Providing classes and other training opportunities to new, as well as experienced dancers * Showcasing the activity through public performances * Organizing dances * Participation in other associations dedicated to the promotion and advancement of square dancing * Providing employment and training opportunities to square dance callers. This is not an exclusive list, and square dance clubs are constantly on the look out for new ways to achieve their goals. Associations, partnerships and other cooperative ventures have become increasingly more important to square dance clubs. Membership in square dance clubs seems to have peaked in the late '70s and early '80s, and has gradually decreased since that time. = Classes and training for dancers = Providing classes and training opportunities is the main activity for the majority of square dance clubs. This activity develops competent dancers, a core membership for the club, club solidarity and feeling, and a renewable base for the sustainability of the club. Most clubs start classes in September and/or January, although strategies are being developed for starting classes more often. Callerlab recommends that the Mainstream program be taught in no less than 56 hours. Depending on the length of the individual class and how often one meets, it can take a half year or longer to learn the full program. Therefore, consideration is being given to many different ways to quicken the learning curve, and to get new dancers on the dance floor. Callerlab also dictates what the plus, advanced 1 and 2, and 4 levels of challenge programs are. Callerlab not only has a number of American callers that are members, but callers from all over the world. In Europe, most notably in Denmark, there have been recognized a series of partial dance levels with corresponding dances available at those partway points (Mainstream 23, 45, 53, 69). The American Callers Association also has a simplified program, called \\"1\\". In America, clubs sponsoring classes often hold \\"Red-light/Green-light\\" dances, where alternating tips are called at a level where class members can participate. These accommodations allow dancers to begin attending dances quicker in the learning cycle. Some clubs, especially those with younger or more motivated dancers, teach at accelerated rates. As an example, Tech Squares, associated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, teaches the longer Plus program in one semester (12 classes of roughly 90 minutes of teaching time). Other clubs have reported success with intensive courses of one or two weekends to learn the Mainstream level, while other areas offer a \\"Five Saturday, or Sunday\\" program to instruct new students in the program. = Public performance = This is a way of bringing public attention to the club, with the hope of recruiting more members. Public performances may be those done in public areas (malls, fairs, exhibitions) or it may refer to televised performances. = Organizing dances = Organizing dances is one of the primary activity of clubs. In addition to sheer enjoyment, dances provide the club's members and members of other clubs the opportunity to practice the skills learned in classes. It also gives the club an opportunity to showcase itself to the wider square dance community, provides dancers an opportunity to socialize, and provides employment for callers. = Participating in associations = Square dance clubs participate in square dance associations of regional, area-wide, national and special interest character, as well as non-square dance association and organizations. = Employment and training for square dance callers = Employment of square dance callers is a key means of securing competent dancers for the club, and for the activity as a whole. Callers will have resources available to them that the general public may not know about. By contacting a caller, you may find information on the activity in your area that is not widely publicized. Training for callers is done by other callers; some of whom have been Certified by organizations. Training can be done in seminars and in week-long classes. A caller is never done with education as he/she is always trying to improve their craft.  Dress code  The Union Pacific Athletic Club, located at 3905 Grays Gable Road in Laramie, Wyoming. The property, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, now houses the Quadra Dangle Square Dance Club. Some clubs have a policy regarding appropriate clothing at club events; others do not. This is referred to as a dress code. Clubs that sponsor dances are encouraged to advertise the dress code that is appropriate for their dance.

Guybrush is voiced by actor Dominic Armato in the third, fourth and fifth games, as well as the enhanced remakes of The Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge. Though a \\"mighty pirate\\" by his own account, it is a running joke throughout the games for characters to garble Guybrush Threepwood's unusual name, either deliberately or accidentally. Name The origin of the name \\"Guybrush\\" comes in part from Deluxe Paint, the tool used by the artists to create the character sprite. Since the character had no name at this point, the file was simply called \\"\\". When the file was saved, Steve Purcell, the artist responsible for the sprite, added \\"\\" to the filename, indicating that it was the Deluxe Paint \\"brush file\\" for the \\"Guy\\" sprite. The file name was then \\"guybrush.bbm\\", so the developers eventually just started referring to this unnamed 'Guy' as \\"Guybrush\\".GameSpot, \\"Storytime with Ron Gilbert - PAX Australia 2013 Keynote\\" , Ron Gilbert, 7 July 2013, accessed 22 March 2015 Guybrush's surname \\"Threepwood\\" was decided upon in a company contest and is derived from P. G. Wodehouse's family of characters including Galahad Threepwood and Freddie Threepwood (with whom he shares similar characteristics). \\"Threepwood\\" is also rumoured to have been the name of Dave Grossman's RPG character. Incarnations Guybrush's age is not defined in the game, though he may be seventeen years old in The Secret of Monkey Island; in the second game, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge, while obtaining fake identification (a library card) in the Phatt City library, a slip of the tongue (\\"nine....errr, twenty one\\") suggests that he may be nineteen. He is twenty years old in The Curse of Monkey Island as he proves to Dinghy Dog when he tries to guess Guybrush's age and Guybrush proves it with his SCUMM Actors Guild Membership Card, although, in the most recent game, Elaine states it was three years between Monkey Island 2 and 3 (she was in a poxed rage during this statement, and that Stan mentioned it was three months). Escape from Monkey Island takes place three months after Curse, following Guybrush and Elaine's honeymoon, while it is stated in-game that Tales of Monkey Island takes place roughly ten years since Guybrush became a pirate, making him 27‚Äì28 years old. However, Guybrush often lies about his age, for example telling the librarian that he was 21 in the aforementioned Phatt library in LeChuck's Revenge. Guybrush grows a beard and moustache in the second game, but is shaven in the third and fourth games. Guybrush makes a reference that he lost his beard between the second and third game but cannot remember what happened to it; in the third game however, if one tries to use the shaving cream, Guybrush says that he shaved last week. In the second game, his hair (possibly just for humorous effect) is in two scenes shown to be a wig which flies off his head when he gets frightened by two fake incarnations of LeChuck, revealing a shaven pate. In all other versions, his hair growth apparently remains natural. In LeChuck's Revenge, Guybrush meets delusionary incarnations of his parents, stating that they have abandoned him when he was younger. Details pertaining to this abandonment, however, remain undisclosed, nor is it made clear whether this is what actually happened or if Guybrush was merely having a delusion or misconception about this event. In Escape from Monkey Island Guybrush's middle name is revealed to be Ulysses. =Attire= In Secret of Monkey Island Guybrush wears a white blouse; he wears a similar blouse in all the other games as well but this one appears to have shorter sleeves (although they could simply be folded). He wears black breeches, white socks and small, black shoes. In LeChuck's Revenge his attire changes radically, consisting of boots, a long, blue coat and two belts, one of which is worn across his chest. In Curse of Monkey Island Guybrush's attire is similar to his attire in the first game, but he has brown breeches instead of black and a small brown waistcoat and red cummerbund sash. In Escape from Monkey Island Guybrush has multiple outfits, which change during the game. He starts with a red, buttoned-up jacket, boots and a large belt with a belt buckle that has his initials on it (an in-joke from Grim Fandango). When venturing to Lucre and Jambalaya Island he wears a similar outfit to his appearance in the first game, except that his trousers are a light blue and his shirt has longer sleeves. When he is once more stranded on Monkey Island in the third act he wears his red jacket, but no shoes. His trousers have been ripped from knee down and his jacket seems slightly beaten up. In Tales of Monkey Island Guybrush wears an outfit very similar to the one he wears in LeChuck's Revenge, although his trousers are brown instead of black and his coat is royal blue instead of marine blue, with a yellow \\"S\\" pattern over it. All of Guybrush's in-game possessions are stored in his pants, even if they are too large to fit (the giant cotton swab in Secret of Monkey Island is one example), except in Tales of Monkey Island, in which there are several references to items being stored in Guybrush's jacket. Attributes =Personality= In his first appearance, Guybrush appears youthful, excited and somewhat simple, mirroring the attitude of a child. Guybrush is however noted for his moments of self-assurance which often backfire on him, but is known to possess a razor sharp wit, allowing him to get out of dire situations. In Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge, Guybrush displays a noticeably nastier personality, performing morally wrong acts just to spite or to progress through the game. He has also become much more egotistical from his previous accomplishments, though still displays a sharp wit and clever thinking. By The Curse of Monkey Island, Guybrush's personality seems to be a combination of his previous simple demeanor and nasty disposition. He is shown to be much more friendly and kind than he was in the previous installment, but is also still capable of making rude and sly comments and committing crimes that are a little less than vicious. Regardless, Guybrush is nowhere near as egotistical as he was previously and is much more contained in gloating. He appears to have grown rather neurotic by Escape from Monkey Island, where he is also prone to submitting to Elaine's whim due to them now being married, including legally changing his name to Marley-Threepwood. He has however become a much more polite and caring individual, never committing any particularly nasty acts, and even goes to great lengths to help others. He has also developed a considerable amount of conscience, evident by his guilt over stealing something as simple as a coffee mug. In the years up to Tales of Monkey Island, Guybrush matures significantly. He has become more consistently self-assured of his capabilities, has a sharper wit, and is able to stand up to Elaine on a number of occasions. He has also become more compassionate, allowing him to earn the friendship of Winslow (the former Captain of the Screaming Narwhal that he had bested) and Morgan LeFlay (the pirate hunter and his fan). Every shred of his egotism is gone, Guybrush truly and deeply loves Elaine and refuses to give up on saving her and remains immensely loyal to her, while still having the courage to stand his ground and be firm with her when he needs to be. This seems to have caused Elaine to have more respect for him and belief in his skills. His skills have also improved considerably as he is able to hold his own in a sword fight against Morgan LeFlay, the most skilled bounty hunter in all the seas, and even succeeds in defeating her with his sharp wit. Aside from his razor sharp wit, Guybrush also seems to be highly literate, able to read long passages of literature and pronounce extremely complex words and phrases without having to think about it or sound it out. This is surprising as Guybrush mentions several times throughout the series that he dropped out of school and most pirates lack conventional skills in areas of schooling. This may be a testament to Guybrush's more intelligent side and that while he may lack common sense and a complete educational background, he is much smarter than a majority of the characters in the series. Appearances =The Secret of Monkey Island= When Guybrush first appeared in The Secret of Monkey Island, set in the Caribbean during a fictional time period, he was an awkward teenager whose sole ambition in life was to be a pirate. Guybrush, although portrayed as an attractive lad in closeups, is a scrawny blonde youth with minimal amounts of courage, intelligence and charisma. His primary talent is the ability to hold his breath for ten minutes and he certainly appears to be an unlikely candidate to be a buccaneer. He does exhibit plenty of persistence, however, and doggedly attempts to complete the three trials of piratehood. In the course of exploring M√™l√©e Island, he meets and immediately falls in love with the Tri- Island Area's beautiful governor, Elaine Marley. Guybrush is not the only one interested in Governor Marley, however: the ghost pirate LeChuck has long been smitten with her; Elaine, however, does not return his affection. She told him to 'drop dead', so he did. When the villain kidnaps Elaine, Guybrush is compelled to try to rescue her from LeChuck's lair on Monkey Island. She proves capable of protecting herself (as she is the former captain of LeChuck's ghost crew), easily escaping LeChuck's clutches (unbeknownst to the bumbling Threepwood). Guybrush, improbably enough, manages to destroy the ghost pirate LeChuck and becomes a fearsome pirate himself. =Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge= In Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge, almost the entire game takes the form of a flashback as Guybrush tells Elaine what happened to him. Thus, it is possible to die by falling into a pit of acid, upon which the game fades back to the storytelling screen, with Elaine asking him to tell what really happened since obviously he could not have died if he was right there telling her the story. As LeChuck's Revenge begins, Guybrush has embarked on an epic new adventure to find the legendary treasure of Big Whoop. He soon runs into Largo LaGrande, LeChuck's former henchman, on Scabb Island. Largo discovers that Guybrush has LeChuck's ghostly beard, which he has kept as a trophy; he steals the beard and uses it to reanimate the corpse of his former boss. Thanks to Guybrush, LeChuck is now a seriously angry zombie with voodoo powers instead of a disgruntled ghost. The Voodoo Lady tells Guybrush that LeChuck can only be stopped by the power of the legendary treasure of Big Whoop. To find it, he must travel to nearby Phatt Island and Booty Island in search of the four pieces of a treasure map. As he completes the map, he is captured by LeChuck; while attempting to escape, Guybrush causes an enormous explosion that hurls him to Dinky Island. Coincidentally enough, this happens to be where Big Whoop is hidden. Guybrush uses dynamite to \\"dig\\" for the treasure and finds himself in a maze of underground, concrete-lined tunnels. The remaining portion of LeChuck's Revenge is surrealistic: One chases the other in a vague abandoned underground place that includes elevators, machines, an office etc. LeChuck claims that he is Guybrush's brother, in a parody of Darth Vader's \\"I am your father\\" scene with Luke Skywalker in The Empire Strikes Back. After Guybrush finally defeats LeChuck with a voodoo doll, he kneels and removes the pirate's \\"mask\\". LeChuck is revealed as Guybrush's bullying older brother \\"Chuckie\\". Suddenly, both Guybrush and Chuckie are children at an amusement park looking like Booty Island, with their parents; both games seem to have been daydreams by a young boy obsessed with pirates. Only a brief scene during the closing credits hints that this may be untrue: Elaine Marley idly wonders if Guybrush has fallen prey to some evil spell of LeChuck's, and we see \\"Chucky\\" has red eyes with an evil glow. =The Curse of Monkey Island= Similar to the gap between the first two games, Curse of Monkey Island opens with Guybrush floating in the Caribbean in a bumper car, writing in a diary. The player learns that the surreal subterranean place and childhood theme park where Monkey Island 2 ended were the result of LeChuck's deceptive spell. LeChuck had built a sinister theme park known as the Carnival of the Damned. The \\"revelation\\" that they were brothers was simply part of the evil scheme. After an undisclosed period of entrapment, Guybrush managed to escape in a long and conspicuously unrecorded adventure. Writing his memories, Guybrush suddenly finds himself in the middle of a battle between the forces of Plunder Island (led by Elaine) and LeChuck's undead crew. Guybrush stumbles into LeChuck's cargo hold and finds an enormous diamond ring, which he decides to use to propose to Elaine. Unfortunately, the ring is cursed, and immediately transforms Elaine into a statue made of solid gold. The Voodoo Lady once again provides magical help, informing Guybrush that the curse can only be broken by replacing the ring with another containing a diamond \\"of equal or greater value\\". The ineffectual hero must assemble a pirate crew and sail to Blood Island and Skull Island. Eventually he manages to break the curse and restore Elaine to flesh and blood. LeChuck, who was killed in the earlier battle, resurfaces as a demon pirate and captures Guybrush LeChuck returns Guybrush to the Carnival of the Damned and once again transforms him into a child. Improbably, Guybrush manages to change himself back to normal and blow up a section of the Roller- Coaster of Death, burying LeChuck under a mountain of ice and snow. Elaine and Guybrush finally marry and sail off into the sunset together. =Escape from Monkey Island= After a three-month-long honeymoon, Guybrush Threepwood and Elaine Marley-Threepwood return to M√™l√©e Island. While the couple was gone, Elaine was declared dead, legally ending her lifetime appointment as governor. The governor's mansion is scheduled for demolition and a slimy politician named Charles L. Charles is poised to take over the position. With no other choice, Elaine begins a desperate campaign for re-election against Charles (who, unsurprisingly, reveals himself to be none other than LeChuck in disguise). As Guybrush wanders around M√™l√©e, he finds that all the local businesses are being taken over by Ozzie Mandrill, an Australian developer who is winning the deeds in matches of various insult games, such as insult swordfighting. He is also rather annoyed when people refer to him and Elaine as Mr. and Mrs. Marley, rather than Threepwood. Guybrush discovers that Ozzie wants to take over the entire Caribbean. Ozzie is seeking a powerful voodoo talisman called the Ultimate Insult, which he will use to turn all pirates into clean, productive members of society. LeChuck is helping Ozzie in exchange for Elaine's hand after her will has been broken by the Ultimate Insult. Once again, Guybrush must assemble a reluctant crew, sailing this time to Lucre Island and Jambalaya Island before ending up on Monkey Island. There he finds an enormous, robotic monkey and uses it to return to M√™l√©e. Ozzie has acquired the Ultimate Insult; he uses its power to enslave LeChuck, who has taken on the form of a gigantic statue of himself. Guybrush, piloting his robotic monkey, manages to hold off defeat long enough to allow Elaine to escape. The statue briefly gains a moment of free will, and crushes the scalp- mounted Ozzie as well as the Ultimate Insult. The power of the Insult causes an immense explosion that seemingly destroys LeChuck as well. =Tales of Monkey Island= Tales of Monkey Island opens with Guybrush catching up with LeChuck and Elaine, who was abducted by the undead pirate once again along with the Monkeys of Montevideo. While LeChuck is casting a spell on the monkeys, Guybrush attempts to kill LeChuck with a voodoo cutlass he assembled, but corrupts the voodoo spell needed to perfect the sword by using grog instead of voodoo root beer. The result is LeChuck transforming into a human and his voodoo energies being released in the form of the Pox of LeChuck. An explosion results in Guybrush being stranded on Flotsam Island, while the pox infects pirates all over the Caribbean. While on the island, Guybrush meets his old friend the Voodoo Lady, who informs him on the myths of La Esponja Grande, the only known cure of the pox, and tells him to find her former lover, Coronado De Cava, to find it. As Guybrush continues his quest, he enlists Reginald Van Winslow as his first mate and crosses paths with the insane Marquis De Singe, who is seeking to use the pox in Guybrush's hand for his own purposes, and Morgan LeFlay, a pirate bounty hunter who idolizes Guybrush and was hired by De Singe to obtain his hand. After losing his hand and defeating Morgan, Guybrush reunites with Elaine on the Jerkbait Islands and is forced to work with a seemingly reformed LeChuck to obtain the summoning artifacts to help him find La Esponja before poxed pirates do. When Guybrush acquires all three artifacts, stops the poxed pirates, and summons the creatures that will guide him to La Esponja, Guybrush goes off to find the sponge while Elaine stays with LeChuck to help him in returning the Monkeys of Montevideo to their proper habitats. While Guybrush and Winslow follow the creatures, they are intercepted by Morgan again who has returned to capture Guybrush for De Singe. Before any harm is done however, all three are swallowed by a giant Manatee, which guides them to the location of the sponge. While in the manatee en route to La Esponja, Guybrush meets an unstable Coronado and collaborates with Morgan, posing as his wife, to get out of the manatee and obtain the sponge. Even though Morgan falls for Guybrush, she betrays him after he obtains La Esponja and hands him back to De Singe on Flotsam Island. Guybrush is taken away by an angry mob however, and is placed on trial for causing the \\"Pox of LeChuck,\\" in which Guybrush is able to stall long enough for Elaine, who is deeply infected by the pox, and LeChuck to come to his aid. LeChuck ultimately saves Guybrush by blaming himself for the pox and reveals the Voodoo Lady has been manipulating the events of the whole series for her own agenda. Guybrush is released and is able to amplify the strength of La Esponja, uses it to cure the pox, and kills De Singe to save his wife from his experiments. LeChuck however reveals his hand and murders Morgan and Guybrush, revealing the pox and his human transformation to being a part of his plans to find and use La Esponja Grande to obtain infinite voodoo energy directly from the Crossroads and conquer the seas. The Monkeys of Montevideo are revealed to have been hypnotized by LeChuck and placed in strategic locations around the Gulf of Melange to open up the entrance to the Crossroads rather being brought back to their natural habitats. Guybrush arrives at the Crossroads as LeChuck takes over the seas and becomes the Demon Pirate God by using La Esponja to absorb limitless voodoo energy from the Crossroads. Guybrush is able to return to the land of the living first as a ghost and later as zombie, but learns Elaine is under LeChuck's control through the voodoo energy La Esponja is supplying him with. With Morgan's help and the Voodoo Lady's guidance, Guybrush reverses the powers of La Esponja, saves Elaine from LeChuck's control, and banishes LeChuck back to the Crossroads after a brutal showdown with the villain. He is ultimately able to return fully alive with Elaine's wedding ring, given to him earlier in the game. =Other appearances= Guybrush is paid homage in the Naughty Dog video game, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, where a pirate with major similarities is featured as one of the twelve pirate captains that founded Libertalia. Although he remains unnamed throughout the game, the resemblance is uncanny and his sigil is represented by a monkey. His portrait can be seen in the Libertalia treasury with the other founders and though his name is partly scratched out, the letters still visible spell out the truncated name \\"Guy Wood\\". Guybrush appears in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II as \\"Guybrush Threepkiller\\" ‚Äì a playable skin for Starkiller. In Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, Guybrush can be accessed as a playable character via a cheat code; in addition, a secret room hidden in the game's final level temporarily transforms the player into Guybrush. Promotion and reception Symbiote Studios and LucasArts have made a statue which features Guybrush Threepwood facing off against LeChuck in a fight. IGN thought Guybrush was one of the few characters that would be strong enough to carry their own movie franchise, calling him \\"delightfully amusing\\" and noting that humour was one of his defining traits. Guybrush was included in GameSpot's vote for the all-time greatest video game hero. Guybrush was eliminated in the first round when facing off against Wander from Shadow of the Colossus, garnering 46.5% of the votes. Empire listed Guybrush as the seventh top greatest video game character, saying that he was \\"[a]rguably the most-loved character in point and click adventure gaming history\\". UGO Networks listed Guybrush as one of their best heroes of all time. When detailing pirates, UGO also called Guybrush \\"[t]he perfect protagonist for a light-hearted pirate adventure\\". Tom Chatfield, writing for The Observer, listed Guybrush as one of the 10 best video game characters, characterizing Guybrush as \\"an unforgettable presence in countless nascent gaming lives, from his knobbly knees to his less-than- silky sword skills\\". Guybrush also was listed in the Guinness World Records as the 38th top video game character. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 10th best hero in video games, adding \\"he may not be the most intimidating of protagonists[...], he gets by with his sharp wit and resourcefulness\\", and that \\"he's not only an unlikely pirate, but also an unlikely hero.\\" References External links *Guybrush Threepwood on the Monkey Island Wiki Fictional sea captains Fictional pirates Fictional swordsmen in video games Male characters in video games Monkey Island characters Video game characters introduced in 1990 Video game protagonists ","title":"Guybrush Threepwood"},{"id":"296298","text":"Northwood may refer to: Places = Australia = *Northwood, New South Wales *Northwood, Victoria = Canada = *Northwood, Thunder Bay, Ontario, a neighbourhood in the city of Thunder Bay = United Kingdom = *Northwood, Derbyshire, a location *Northwood, Isle of Wight *Northwood, Kent, Ramsgate, Thanet, Kent *Northwood, London, in the London Borough of Hillingdon *Northwood, Merseyside, a district of Kirkby, Merseyside *Northwood, Shropshire, a location *Northwood, Stafford, a location *Northwood, Stoke-on- Trent, Staffordshire *Northwood Headquarters, Eastbury, Hertfordshire = United States = *Northwood, Irvine, California *Northwood, Delaware *Northwood, Iowa *Northwood, Baltimore, Maryland *Northwood, New Hampshire *Northwood, North Dakota *Northwood, Ohio, in Wood County *Northwood, Logan County, Ohio *Northwood, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a Northeast Philadelphia neighborhood Education *Northwood High School (disambiguation), multiple schools *Northwood School (disambiguation), multiple schools *Northwood College, a girls' school in Northwood, London *Northwood University, a private university with locations in many U.S. states People with the surname *Joseph Northwood (1809‚Äì1886), Canadian businessman and politician Other uses *Northwood (TV series), drama series that ran on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation *Northwood, a central processing unit (CPU) core series produced by Intel *Operation Northwoods, a 1962 secret U.S. military plan to fake Cuban military aggressions on America's Guantanamo base See also *Norwood (disambiguation) *North Woods Law, American television series on the Animal Planet channel ","title":"Northwood"},{"id":"296301","text":"Ormskirk is a market town in West Lancashire, England, north of Liverpool, northwest of St Helens, southeast of Southport and southwest of Preston. Ormskirk is known for its gingerbread. Geography and administration Ormskirk lies on sloping ground on the side of a ridge, whose highest point is above sea-level, at the centre of the West Lancashire Plain, and has been described as a \\"planned borough\\", laid out in the 13th century.Lancashire County Council, Ormskirk historic town assessment, Lancashire County Council, 2006 Ormskirk is an unparished area, surrounded by the parishes of Bickerstaffe, Aughton, Scarisbrick, Burscough, Lathom and Lathom South.Mariolancashire.gov.uk, Map of Lancashire parishes Lathom South Parish Council The town is located in the district of West Lancashire and is the site of the headquarters of West Lancashire Borough Council. Since Ormskirk does not have a parish council, a voluntary association, Ormskirk Community Partnership, was created in 2009, with the support of the West Lancashire Borough Council, to act as a voice for Ormskirk.Westlandsdc.gov.uk Ormskirk Community Partnership Ormskirk is home to Edge Hill University.Edgehill.ac.uk , Edge Hill's 'how to find us' page History The name is Old Norse in origin and is derived from Ormres kirkja, from a personal name, Ormr (which means \\"serpent\\" or dragon), and the Old Norse word kirkja for church. Ormr may have been a Viking who settled here, became a Christian and founded the church but there are no other records or archaeological evidence to support this and Ormr's identity is unknown. There is no reference to Ormskirk in the Domesday Book of 1086, but it has been suggested that it may have been part of Lathom at that time.Open Domesday: Lathom In about 1189, the lord of Lathom granted the church of Ormskirk to Burscough Priory, which does suggest that Ormskirk had been subordinate to Lathom before that date. An open market is held twice weekly, on Thursdays and Saturdays, in the pedestrianised centre of Ormskirk. The location was originally the junction of the main roads to Preston, Liverpool and Wigan, and was marked by a market cross going back to medieval times. During the 18th and 19th centuries the Cross, as the junction was known, was the location of a large lamp mounted on an obelisk with a circular drinking fountain for both people and animals around the base. This was moved to the junction of St Helens Road and Moor Street to make room for the erection of the clock tower in 1876. The fountain was then moved again to opposite the Drill Hall down Southport Road in the 1890s when space was needed to site the Disraeli statue. The market was established by a royal charter that was granted by Edward I in 1286 to the monks of Burscough Priory. Thursday has been market day in Ormskirk since at least 1292. The King also granted a borough charter to Ormskirk at about the same time, but this seems to have become extinct by the end of the 15th century. The Ormskirk Poor Law Union was established in 1837, covering 21 parishes and townships from Tarleton to Simonswood, and from Birkdale to Skelmersdale. Ormskirk Union Workhouse was built in 1853 on Wigan Road and later became Ormskirk and District General Hospital.Workhouses.org.uk , Ormskirk Workhouses With its weekly markets, the town became a focal point for local farmers and their agricultural workers, cottagers, cow-keepers etc. to trade their goods and obtain necessities from the markets and from the retail establishments which were established along with public houses and inns. An engineering industry, based on making and mending agricultural machinery also developed. The town became known for its gingerbread over the years when local women would bake the gingerbread in their own homes and then take it to the staging inns to sell to passengers. When the railway arrived in the mid 19th century, the local gingerbread sellers found a new market. They were allowed to sell their product to passengers travelling through the railway station. One particular customer Edward, Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, enjoyed the local gingerbread so much he sent orders to the town. The baking of gingerbread became part of the retail history of the town, with several local bakers claiming to have the original gingerbread recipe. A well known local woman, Sally Woods, was a recognisable figure on the market selling her gingerbread. =Parish Church of St Peter and St Paul= Ormskirk Parish Church The Parish Church of St Peter and St Paul is believed to be on the site of the original kirk, on a sandstone outcrop, and is the oldest building in the town. Its exact age is unknown; the building does contain some fragments of Norman architecture. The parish church has many connections with the Earls of Derby and the Stanley family. Many family members are buried in the church's Derby Chapel, including Thomas Stanley, the first Earl, who caused Richard III to lose his crown by changing sides at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, and the Royalist James Stanley, the seventh Earl, who was beheaded at Bolton in 1651 after the Civil War. His body is buried in one coffin and his head in a separate casket. This is one of only three parish churches in England to have a tower and a separate spire, and is unique in that it has both at the same end of the building. (The other two are St Mary's Church, Purton and St Andrew's Church, Wanborough, both near Swindon, in Wiltshire). Legend has it that Orme had two sisters, one who wanted a tower, and one who wanted a spire, and Orme built both to please both. The 'steeple' in fact dates from the early 15th century, but the original blew down in 1731 and was rebuilt between 1790 and 1832. The large west tower was added to the church around 1548 to house the bells of nearby Burscough Priory following the Dissolution of the Monasteries. One of these bells can still be seen in the church. Transport Ormskirk railway station. The A59 is the main road, with Preston to the north and Liverpool to the south. The A570, from Southport, crosses the town from west to east and provides a link to the national motorway network at junction 3 of the M58, about three miles from the town centre. It then continues to St Helens before reaching the M62 at Junction 7, Rainhill Stoops. The town's railway station, which was refurbished at a cost of ¬£1 million in 2009, is a northern terminus of Merseyrail, and the line continues, with a change from electric to diesel multiple units, through to Preston, after the direct service was partitioned in 1970. This line was promoted by the Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway in August 1846, but was completed by the East Lancashire Railway. The route and Ormskirk station opened on 2 April 1849, the undertaking being merged into the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway on 13 May 1859. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway built the Skelmersdale Branch line to Skelmersdale and Rainford Junction, which opened on 1 March 1858. Passenger services ended on 5 November 1956, goods to Rainford Junction finished on 16 November 1961 and to Skelmersdale on 4 November 1963. Local economy There is a Morrisons on Park Road, which was converted from a Safeway in 2005. The building was formerly home to the local gasworks, and the local Rover/Morris car dealership (Balmforths). The Two Saints is a modest retail park which opened in 2000 and contains a number of retailers including McDonald's, Argos, Mobility Store, Poundland, Aldi and a gym. In December 2013, when Blockbuster entered administration, its store at Two Saints closed. Ormskirk has an indoor market situated on Moorgate. A Tesco Metro was located on Church Street, but it closed in April 2015. An out of town business park, The Hattersley Centre, opened in February 2008, with a Home Bargains, Howdens, Tile Giant, Magnet, Jewson, Halfords and a Plumbase. After Focus DIY went into administration, its store on the Hattersley Centre closed. The unit which it occupied was split into three, two being occupied by Home Bargains and The Food Warehouse by Iceland.http://www.thefoodwarehouse.com/store-locator An application for Asda to open in the unit was rejected in February 2011, after the application was submitted in August 2009. The centre was never fully occupied, and had been struggling since its completion. Netto closed down in August 2016, after the firm pulled out of the United Kingdom. The store had opened in November 2014. 2019 saw the Hattersley Centre expand with new units being built on adjacent unused land and occupied by Lidl and Toolstation. . The expansion followed funding of ¬£6.2M being secured from the Royal Bank of Scotland to clear the adjacent land and build new units. 2019 also saw Magnet vacate one of the units, but this was quickly occupied by Screwfix. One of the last significant manufacturing businesses remaining in Ormskirk were Atkinson & Kirby, who make hardwood floors and employed 80 people.Akirby.co.uk , Atkinson & Kirby home page They relocated in September 2015 after operating from Ormskirk for over 100 years. Businesses in the town are mainly professional and financial services, such as solicitors, estate agents, and accountants. Education Ormskirk School (ages 11‚Äì18) is on Wigan Road in the east of the town, situated on a site formerly home to the demolished Cross Hall High School. Ormskirk School is the result of a merger between Ormskirk Grammar School and Cross Hall High School. St Bede's Catholic High School (ages 11‚Äì16) is on St Anne's Road next to the A59 and Prescot Road, and opposite St Anne's Church. Edge Hill University is on the A570 St Helens Road heading east. West Lancashire College, a further education college, used to have a site in the town centre on Hants Lane. Ormskirk is also home to a public library. Parks and open spaces The town has three main parks and a number of other smaller play areas and open spaces. The main parks are:- * Victoria Park, named after Queen Victoria, is Ormskirk's oldest park, established towards the end of the 19th Century. It contains a monument to local heroes of the Boer War and Crimean War.British Listed Buildings accessed 27 January 2012Photo from the Francis Frith collection accessed 27 January 2012 It is located on the triangle of land between Knowsley Road, St Helens Road and Ruff Lane. * Coronation Park,West Lancs BC web site accessed 27 January 2012 a large park in the town centre on Park Road, which has children's play areas, skateboard area, games area for football and basketball, fitness equipment, duck pond, bowling green, bandstand and wildlife meadow.

In general, Whig historians emphasize the rise of constitutional government, personal freedoms and scientific progress. The term is often applied generally (and pejoratively) to histories that present the past as the inexorable march of progress towards enlightenment. The term is also used extensively in the history of science to refer to historiography that focuses on the successful chains of theories and experiments that led to present-day theories while ignoring failed theories and dead ends.Ernst Mayr, \\"When is Historiography Whiggish?\\" in Journal of the History of Ideas, April 1990, Vol. 51 Issue 2, pp 301‚Äì309 in JSTOR Whig history is rooted in European Enlightenment thinking that gave rise to European liberalism and Marxist theory of history, which itself is influenced by Christianity's teleological assumption that mankind must progress towards a certain goal. Liberalism puts its faith in the power of human reason to reshape society, disregarding contexts of history. It proposes the inevitable, universal progress of humankind. The Marxist theory of history, meanwhile, presupposes that humanity is moving through historical stages to the classless, stateless, moneyless and egalitarian society to which communism aspires.David Parker, Revolutions and the revolutionary tradition in the West, 1560‚Äì1991Stephen J. Lee, Aspects of British political history Whig history laid the groundwork for modernization theory and the resulting deployment of development aid around the world after World War II, which has sometimes been criticized as destructive to its recipients.  Terminology  The British historian Herbert Butterfield coined the term \\"Whig history\\" in his short but influential book The Whig Interpretation of History (1931). It takes its name from the British Whigs, advocates of the power of Parliament, who opposed the Tories, advocates of the power of the king. The term has been applied widely in historical disciplines outside of British history (the history of science, for example) to criticize any teleological (or goal-directed), hero-based and transhistorical narrative: in a non-British, more general context, 'whig history' (lower-case) is preferred.J Burrow, A History of Histories (Penguin 2009) p. 473 The abstract noun \\"whiggishness\\" is sometimes used as a generic term for Whig historiography. Whig history has no direct relation to either the British Whig or American Whig parties and should not be confused with \\"Whiggism\\", which is a political ideology. The term \\"Whiggery\\" is ambiguous in contemporary usage: it may either mean party politics and ideology, or a general intellectual approach.  Herbert Butterfield  When H. A. L. Fisher in 1928 gave a Raleigh lecture on The Whig Historians, from Sir James Mackintosh to Sir George Trevelyan, he implied that \\"Whig historian\\" was adequately taken as a political rather than a progressive or teleological label and this put the concept into play.Michael Bentley, Modernizing England's Past: English Historiography in the Age of Modernism (2005), p. 171. P. B. M. Blaas, author of the book Continuity and Anachronism, has argued that Whig history itself had lost all vitality by 1914.Bentley p. 95. Butterfield's book on the Whig interpretation marked the emergence of a negative concept in historiography under a convenient phrase, but was not isolated. Undermining whiggish narratives was one aspect of the post‚ÄìWorld War I re-evaluation of European history in general and Butterfield's critique exemplified this trend. Intellectuals no longer believed the world was automatically getting better and better. Subsequent generations of academic historians have similarly rejected Whig history because of its presentist and teleological assumption that history is driving toward some sort of goal. According to Victor Feske, there is too much readiness to accept Butterfield's classic formulation from 1931 as definitive.From Belloc to Churchill: Private Scholars, Public Culture, and the Crisis of British Liberalism, 1900‚Äì1939 (1996), p. 2. A study by Keith Sewell, Herbert Butterfield and the Interpretation of History, was published in 2005. = The Whig Interpretation of History = The characteristics of Whig history as defined by Butterfield include interpreting history as a story of progress toward the present and specifically toward the British constitutional settlement. Butterfield wrote: Typical distortions thereby introduced are: * Viewing the British parliamentary, constitutional monarchy as the apex of human political development; * Assuming that the constitutional monarchy was in fact an ideal held throughout all ages of the past, despite the observed facts of British history and the several power struggles between monarchs and parliaments; * Assuming that political figures in the past held current political beliefs (anachronism); * Assuming that British history was a march of progress whose inevitable outcome was the constitutional monarchy; and * Presenting political figures of the past as heroes who advanced the cause of this political progress, or villains who sought to hinder its inevitable triumph.According to its critics, a Whig interpretation requires human heroes and villains in the story. J. Hart, Nineteenth-Century Social Reform: A Tory Interpretation of History, Past & Present 1965 31(1):39‚Äì61. Butterfield argued that this approach to history compromised the work of the historian in several ways. The emphasis on the inevitability of progress leads to the mistaken belief that the progressive sequence of events becomes \\"a line of causation\\", tempting the historian to go no further to investigate the causes of historical change.Herbert Butterfield, The Whig Interpretation of History, (New York: W. W. Norton), 1965, p. 12. The focus on the present as the goal of historical change leads the historian to a special kind of abridgement, selecting only those events that seem important from the present point of view.Butterfield, pp. 24‚Äì25. Butterfield's antidote to Whig history was \\"to evoke a certain sensibility towards the past, the sensibility which studies the past 'for the sake of the past', which delights in the concrete and the complex, which 'goes out to meet the past', which searches for 'unlikenesses between past and present'\\".Adrian Wilson and T. G. Ashplant, \\"Whig History and Present-Centred History,\\" The Historical Journal, 31 (1988): 1‚Äì16, at p. 10. A decade later however ‚Äì if under wartime pressure ‚Äì Butterfield would note of the Whig interpretation that \\"Whatever it may have done to our history, it has had a wonderful effect on our politics....In every Englishman there is hidden something of a whig that seems to tug at the heart- strings\\".Quoted in J Burrow, A History of Histories (Pengion 2009) p. 474 = Subsequent views = Butterfield's formulation has subsequently received much attention and the kind of historical writing he argued against in generalized terms is no longer academically respectable. Despite its polemical success, Butterfield's celebrated book itself has been criticized by David Cannadine as \\"slight, confused, repetitive and superficial\\".G. M. Trevelyan (1992), p. 208. Michael BentleyMichael Bentley, Modern Historiography: An Introduction (1999), pp. 64‚Äì65. analyses the \\"Whig theory\\" according to Butterfield as equivalent to the formation of a canon of 19th-century historians of England (such as William Stubbs, James Anthony Froude, E. A. Freeman, J. R. Green, W. E. H. Lecky, Lord Acton, J. R. Seeley, S. R. Gardiner, C. H. Firth and J. B. Bury) that in fact excludes few except Thomas Carlyle. The theory identifies the common factors and Bentley comments: > Carlyle apart, the so-called Whigs were predominantly Christian, > predominantly Anglican, thinkers for whom the Reformation supplied the > critical theatre of enquiry when considering the origins of modern England. > When they wrote about the history of the English constitution, as so many of > them did, they approached their story from the standpoint of having Good > News to relate. Roger Scruton, in his A Dictionary of Political Thought (1982), takes the theory underlying \\"Whig history\\" to be centrally concerned with social progress and reaction, with the progressives shown as victors and benefactors. Of the English tradition, Cannadine wrote:G. M. Trevelyan, p. 197. > It was fiercely partisan and righteously judgemental, dividing the personnel > of the past into the good and the bad. And it did so on the basis of the > marked preference for liberal and progressive causes, rather than > conservative and reactionary ones. [...] Whig history was, in short, an > extremely biased view of the past: eager to hand out moral judgements, and > distorted by teleology, anachronism and present-mindedness.  British Whig historians  Paul Rapin de Thoyras's history of England, published in 1723, became \\"the classic Whig history\\" for the first half of the eighteenth century.Hugh Trevor-Roper, 'Introduction', Lord Macaulay's History of England (Penguin Classics, 1979), p. 10. Rapin claimed that the English had preserved their ancient constitution against the absolutist tendencies of the Stuarts. However, Rapin's history lost its place as the standard history of England in the late 18th century and early 19th century to that of David Hume. = David Hume = In The History of England (1754‚Äì1761), Hume challenged Whig views of the past and the Whig historians in turn attacked Hume; but they could not dent his history. In the early 19th century, some Whig historians came to incorporate Hume's views, dominant for the previous fifty years. These historians were members of the New Whigs around Charles James Fox (1749‚Äì1806) and Lord Holland (1773‚Äì1840) in opposition until 1830 and so \\"needed a new historical philosophy\\".Trevor-Roper, p. 12. Fox himself intended to write a history of the Glorious Revolution of 1688, but only managed the first year of James II's reign. A fragment was published in 1808. James Mackintosh then sought to write a Whig history of the Glorious Revolution, published in 1834 as the History of the Revolution in England in 1688. William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765‚Äì1769) and Henry Hallam's Constitutional History of England (1827) reveal many Whiggish traits. According to Arthur Marwick, Hallam was the first Whig historian.The Nature of History (second edition 1980), p. 47. = Thomas Babington Macaulay = Hume still dominated English historiography, but this changed when Thomas Babington Macaulay, utilising Fox and Mackintosh's work and manuscript collections, published the first volumes of his The History of England from the Accession of James II in 1848. It proved an immediate success, replacing Hume's history and becoming the new orthodoxy.Trevor-Roper, pp. 25‚Äì6. While Macaulay was a popular and celebrated historian of the Whig school, his work did not feature in Butterfield's 1931 book. According to Ernst Breisach, \\"his style captivated the public as did his good sense of the past and firm Whiggish convictions\\".Historiography (second edition, 1994), p.251. The first chapter of Macaulay's History of England proposes: = William Stubbs = William Stubbs (1825‚Äì1901), the constitutional historian and influential teacher of a generation of historians, became a crucial figure in the later survival and respectability of Whig history. According to Reba Soffer: \\"His rhetorical gifts often concealed his combination of High Church Anglicanism, Whig history, and civic responsibility\\".Reba Soffer, Discipline and Power: The University, History, and the Making of an English Elite (1994), p. 87. = Robert Hebert Quick = Political history was the usual venue for Whig history in Great Britain, but it also appears in other areas. Robert Hebert Quick (1831‚Äì1891) was one of the leaders of the Whig school of the history of education, along with G. A. N. Lowndes. In 1898, Quick explained the value of studying the history of educational reform, arguing that the great accomplishments of the past were cumulative and comprised the building blocks that ‚Äúwould raise us to a higher standing-point from which we may see much that will make the right road clearer to us‚Äù.Quoted in Gary McCulloch, The Struggle for the History of Education (Routledge, 2011), p 29  Later instances and criticism  = In the history of science = It has been argued that the historiography of science is \\"riddled with Whiggish history\\".C. T. McIntire, Herbert Butterfield: Historian as Dissenter, (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004), p. 205. Like other Whig histories, Whig history of science tends to divide historical actors into \\"good guys\\" who are on the side of truth (as is now known), and \\"bad guys\\" who opposed the emergence of these truths because of ignorance or bias.John A. Schuster,\\"The Problem of Whig History in the History of Science, Chap 3 of The Scientific Revolution: Introduction to History and Philosophy of Science From this Whiggish perspective, Ptolemy would be criticized because his astronomical system placed the Earth at the center of the universe while Aristarchus would be praised because he placed the Sun at the center of the solar system. This kind of evaluation ignores historical background and the evidence that was available at a particular time: did Aristarchus have evidence to support his idea that the Sun was at the center? Were there good reasons to reject Ptolemy's system before the sixteenth century? The writing of Whig history of science is especially found in the writings of scientists\\"The conventional stories of the past that appear in the introductory chapters of science textbooks are certainly a form of Whiggism. Historians take great delight in exposing the artificially constructed nature of these stories, and some scientists find the results uncomfortable.\\" Peter J. Bowler and Iwan Rhys Morus, Making Modern Science: A Historical Survey, (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 2005) , p. 2. and general historians,\\"the history of science ‚Äì as composed by both ex-scientists and general historians ‚Äì has largely consisted of Whig history, in which the scientific winners write the account in such a way as to make their triumph an inevitable outcome of the righteous logic of their cause.\\" Ken Alder, \\"The History of Science, or, an Oxymoronic Theory of Relativistic Objectivity\\", pp. 297‚Äì318 in Lloyd Kramer and Sarah Maza, ed., A Companion to Western Historical Thought, (Blackwell,), p. 301. while this whiggish tendency is commonly opposed by professional historians of science. Nicholas Jardine describes the changing attitude to whiggishness this way:Nick Jardine, \\"Whigs and Stories: Herbert Butterfield and the Historiography of Science,\\" .History of Science , 41 (2003): 125‚Äì140, at pp. 127‚Äì28. > By the mid-1970s, it had become commonplace among historians of science to > employ the terms 'Whig' and 'Whiggish', often accompanied by one or more of > 'hagiographic', 'internalist', 'triumphalist', even 'positivist', to > denigrate grand narratives of scientific progress. At one level there is, > indeed, an obvious parallel with the attacks on Whig constitutional history > in the opening decades of the century. For, as P. B. M. Blaas has shown, > those earlier attacks were part and parcel of a more general onslaught in > the name of an autonomous, professional and scientific history, on popular, > partisan and moralising historiography. Similarly, ... For post-WWII > champions of the newly professionalized history of science the targets were > quite different. Above all, they were out to establish a critical distance > between the history of science and the teaching and promotion of the > sciences. In particular, they were suspicious of the grand celebratory and > didactic narratives of scientific discovery and progress that had > proliferated in the inter-war years. More recently, some scholars have argued that Whig history is essential to the history of science. At one level, \\"the very term 'the history of science' has itself profoundly Whiggish implications. One may be reasonably clear what 'science' means in the 19th century and most of the 18th century. In the 17th century 'science' has very different meaning. For example chemistry is inextricably mixed up with alchemy. Before the 17th century dissecting out such a thing as 'science' in anything like the modern sense of the term involves profound distortions\\".R. Anthony Hyman, \\"Whiggism in the History of Science and the Study of the Life and Work of Charles Babbage\\" The science historians' rejection of whiggishness has been criticized by some scientists for failing to appreciate the temporal depth of scientific research.Edward Harrison, \\"Whigs, prigs and historians of science\\", Nature, 329 (1987): 213‚Äì14. = In the history of philosophy = One very common example of Whig history is the work of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, to whom is often ascribed a teleological view of history with an inexorable trajectory in the direction of progress. = In Canadian history = Regarding Canada, Allan Greer argues: = In the emergence of intelligent life = In The Anthropic Cosmological Principle (1986), John D. Barrow and Frank J. Tipler identify Whiggishness (Whiggery) with a teleological principle of convergence in history to liberal democracy. This is in line with what Barrow and Tipler call the \\"anthropic principle\\". = In popular culture = Despite their shortcomings as interpretations of the past, Whiggish histories continue to influence popular understandings of political and social development. This persistence reflects the power of dramatic narratives that detail epic struggles for enlightened ideals. Aspects of the Whig interpretation are apparent in films, television, political rhetoric and even history textbooks:James A. Hijiya, \\"Why the West is Lost\\", The William and Mary Quarterly, 3rd Ser., Vol. 51, No. 2. (Apr., 1994), pp. 276‚Äì292. thus in the debate over Britishness, for example, David Marquand praised the Whig approach on the grounds that \\"Ordered freedom and evolutionary progress have been among the hallmarks of modern British history, and they should command respect\\".Marquand, in A Gamble ed., Britishness (Oxford 2009) p. 15 Popular understandings of human evolution and paleoanthropology may be imbued with a form of \\"whiggishness\\". See for example the celebrated scientific illustration, The March of Progress (1965). Most portrayals and fictionalized adaptations of the Scopes Trial, such as in Inherit the Wind (1955), subscribe to a Whig view of the trial and its aftermath. This was challenged by historian Edward J. Larson in his book Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America's Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion (1997), for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1998.Ronald P. Ladouceur, \\"Ella Thea Smith and the Lost History of American High School Biology Textbooks\\", Journal of the History of Biology, Vol. 41, No. 3 (September 2008), pp. 435‚Äì471. Recent examples representative of the Whig history understanding of the world include Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of Our Nature, Francis Fukuyama's The End of History and the Last Man, and Michael Shermer's The Moral Arc, which argue that the modern world is much more moral. Pinker is criticized for collapsing distinctions and misrepresenting humanity's past by Douglas P. Fry and R. Brian Ferguson in War, Peace and Human Nature; and Darcia Narvaez points out the opposite trajectory in Neurobiology and the Development of Human Morality: Evolution, Culture and Wisdom. The Whig version of history was satirised in 1066 and All That.  See also   References   Further reading    External links  * Text of The Whig Interpretation of History * James A.

Use taxes are commonly imposed by states with a sales tax but are usually enforced only for large items such as automobiles and boats. *Securities turnover excise tax, a tax on the trade of securities. *Value added tax (VAT), in which tax is charged on all sales, thus avoiding the need for a system of resale certificates. Tax cascading is avoided by applying the tax only to the difference (\\"value added\\") between the price paid by the first purchaser and the price paid by each subsequent purchaser of the same item. *FairTax, a proposed federal sales tax, intended to replace the US federal income tax. *Turnover tax, similar to a sales tax, but applied to intermediate and possibly capital goods as an indirect tax. Most countries in the world have sales taxes or value-added taxes at all or several of the national, state, county, or city government levels. Countries in Western Europe, especially in Scandinavia, have some of the world's highest valued-added taxes. Norway, Denmark and Sweden have higher VATs at 25%, Hungary has the highest at 27%VAT Rates Applied in the Member States of the European Community European Commission Taxation and Customs Union (2009-7-1), retrieved 2009-12-7Guide to Value Added Tax in Norway Skatteetaten (2009-4-7), retrieved 2009-12-7 although reduced rates are used in some cases, as for groceries, art, books and newspapers. In some jurisdictions of the United States, there are multiple levels of government which each impose a sales tax. For example, sales tax in Chicago (Cook County), IL is 10.25%, consisting of 6.25% state, 1.25% city, 1.75% county and 1% regional transportation authority. Chicago also has the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority tax on food and beverage of 1% (which means eating out is taxed at 11.25%).Tax Rate Finder Illinois Revenue official website, retrieved 2009-12-7 For Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the tax is 9.45%, which is 4.45% state & 5% local.Sales and Use Tax Rates effective 7/1/2009 East Baton Rouge Parish, retrieved 2009-12-7 In Los Angeles it is 9.5%, which is 7.25% state & 2.25% county. In California, sales taxes are made up of various state, county and city taxes. The state tax is \\"imposed upon all retailers\\" for the \\"privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail\\". Strictly speaking, only the retailer is responsible for the payment of the tax; when a retailer adds this tax to the purchase price, the consumer is merely reimbursing the retailer by contractual agreement. When consumers purchase goods from out-of-state (in which case the seller owes no tax to California) the consumer is required to pay a \\"use tax\\" identical to the sales tax. Use tax is levied upon the \\"storage, use, or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property\\". Consumers are responsible for declaring these purchases in the same filing as their annual state income tax, but it is rare for them to do so. An exception is out-of-state purchase of automobiles. Then, use tax is collected by the state as part of registering the vehicle in California. The trend has been for conventional sales taxes to be replaced by more broadly based value-added taxes. Value -added taxes provide an estimated 20% of worldwide tax revenue and have been adopted by more than 140 countries. The United States is now one of the few countries to retain conventional sales taxes. Effects Economists at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development studied the effects of various types of taxes on the economic growth of developed nations within the OECD and found that sales taxes are one of the least harmful taxes for growth. Because the rate of a sales tax does not change based on a person's income or wealth, sales taxes are generally considered regressive. However, it has been suggested that any regressive effect of a sales tax could be mitigated, e.g., by excluding rent, or by exempting \\"necessary\\" items, such as food, clothing and medicines. Investopedia defines a regressive tax as \\"[a] tax that takes a larger percentage from low-income people than from high-income people. A regressive tax is generally a tax that is applied uniformly. This means that it hits lower-income individuals harder\\". =Effects on local economies= Higher sales taxes have been shown to have many different effects on local economies. With higher taxes, more consumers are starting to reconsider where they shop, according to a study conducted in Minnesota and Wisconsin, where the sales tax was raised on cigarettes. Effects of higher sales tax were not shown immediately in sales, but about six months after the taxes were raised. High sales taxes can be used to relieve property taxes but only when property taxes are lowered subsequently. Studies that have shown this correlation were conducted in Georgia by cities raising sales tax and lowering property taxes. To combat sales loss, a city must be able to import consumers to buy goods locally. If local sales taxes are too high, consumers will travel to other areas to purchase goods. =Enforcement of tax on remote sales= In the United States, every state with a sales tax law has a use tax component in that law applying to purchases from out-of-state mail order, catalog and e-commerce vendors, a category also known as \\"remote sales\\". As e-commerce sales have grown in recent years, noncompliance with use tax has had a growing impact on state revenues. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that uncollected use taxes on remote sales in 2003 could be as high as $20.4 billion. Uncollected use tax on remote sales was projected to run as high as $54.8 billion for 2011. Enforcement of the tax on remote sales, however, is difficult. Unless the vendor has a physical location, or nexus, within a state, the vendor cannot be required to collect tax for that state. This limitation was defined as part of the Dormant Commerce Clause by the Supreme Court in the 1967 decision on National Bellas Hess v. Illinois. An attempt to require a Delaware e-commerce vendor to collect North Dakota tax was overturned by the court in the 1992 decision on Quill Corp. v. North Dakota. A number of observers and commentators have argued, so far unsuccessfully, for a Congressional adoption of this physical presence nexus test.See, for example, Sidney S. Silhan, If It Ain't Broke Don't Fix It: An Argument for the Codification of the Quill Standard for Taxing Internet Commerce 76 Chi. - Kent. L. Rev. 671 (2000), setting forth reasons for maintaining the existing standard. The Internet Tax Freedom Act of 1998 established a commission to study the possibility of internet taxation, but the commission did not make any formal recommendations. In a report issued in 2003, the Congressional Budget Office warned of the economic burden of a \\"multiplicity of tax systems, particularly for smaller firms\\". In an effort to reduce the burden of compliance with the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions, the Streamlined Sales Tax Project was organized in March 2000. Cooperative efforts in this project by 44 state governments and the District of Columbia eventually produced the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement in 2010. This agreement establishes standards necessary for simplified and uniform sales tax laws. As of December 2010, 24 states had passed legislation conforming with the agreement. Whether the Streamlined Sales Tax can actually be applied to remote sales ultimately depends upon Congressional support, because the 1992 Quill v. North Dakota decision determined that only the U.S. Congress has the authority to enact interstate taxes. = Effect of electronic commerce = Electronic commerce business can also be affected by consumption taxes. It can be separated into four categories: retail. intermediaries, business-to-business and media (Goldfarb 2008). These categories were affected varying degrees. The intermediaries was affected by the retail sales tax since it provide platforms for transitions between different parties (such as the Amazon marketplace). Business-to-Business transactions will be placed in different circumstances by whether the case will be taxed in the US. Electronic commerce goods are usually not taxed the same especially across the stats in the US. Different states has their own sales tax regulation, for example, some states use their standard sales taxes law for the digital goods, and some of the states have specific laws for them. It is difficult to enforce the taxes on electronic commerce especially for digital goods that trade across different countries. The effect that a sales tax has on consumer and producer behavior is rather large. The price elasticity of demand for online products is high, meaning that consumers are price sensitive and their demand will significantly change with small changes in price. This means that the tax burden lies primarily with the producer. To avoid altering demand, the producer will either avoid the tax if possible by location their fulfillment centers in areas without a high sales tax or they will internalize the cost of the sales tax by charging consumers the same price but paying for the tax from their profits. =History= =Early examples= A tax imposed on the sale of goods is depicted on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs, which have been dated as far back as 2000 BC. These paintings describe the collection of tax for specific commodities, such as cooking oil. Sales tax amounts, measured in drachmas at a rate of one percent, were recorded in a separate column of a record prepared for the auction of 16 slaves in Piraeus, Greece in 415 BC. Nearby Athens collected duties on the import and export of commodities, recorded at a rate of two percent in 399 BC. At that period of time, Athens did not rely on government agencies to collect its taxes; the responsibility was delegated to the highest bidder, a practice known as tax farming.Dillon and Garland, p. 41 The Roman emperor Augustus collected funds for his military aerarium in AD 6 with a one percent general sales tax, known as the centesima rerum venalium (hundredth of the value of everything sold). The Roman sales tax was later reduced to a half percent (ducentesima) by Tiberius, then abolished completely by Caligula. =In the United States= Although the United States government has never used a general sales tax, an excise tax on whiskey enacted in 1791 was one of its first fund raising efforts. The unpopularity of this tax with farmers on the western frontier led to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Federal and state sales taxes in the United States remained selective, rather than general, through the 19th century. However, excise taxes were applied to so many specific commodities during the Civil War that they functioned collectively as a general sales tax. The first broad-based, general sales taxes in the United States were enacted by Kentucky and Mississippi in 1930, although Kentucky repealed its sales tax in 1936. The federal government's per-gallon tax of gasoline (beginning at .01 cent per gallon in 1932) and per- package tax of cigarettes ($1.01 per package since 2009) are the most well- known current sales taxes administered by the federal government. Twenty-two other states began imposing general sales taxes later in the 1930s, followed by six in the 1940s and five in the 1950s. Kentucky re-enacted its sales tax law in 1960. Eleven more states enacted sales tax laws during the 1960s, with Vermont as the last in 1969. Only five states currently do not have general sales taxes: Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon. The 2010 health care reform law imposed a 10 percent federal sales tax on indoor tanning services, effective July 1, 2010. Unlike previous federal excise taxes, this tax is collected directly from the consumer by the seller and based on the sale price rather than a quantity. However, the new tax is selective rather than general, applying only to a specific service.Tax Provisions in the Health Care Act AICPA Journal of Accountancy, retrieved 2010-04-02H.R. 3590 Sec. 10907 HealthReformStat, retrieved 2010-04-02 In Canada Canada uses a value-added federal Goods and Services Tax (GST) with a rate of 5 percent, effective since January 1, 2008. Every province in Canada except Alberta has either a Provincial Sales Tax (PST) or the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST), which is a single, blended combination of the GST and PST. Sales tax mitigation Businesses can reduce the impact of sales tax for themselves and their customers by planning for the tax consequences of all activities. Sales tax reduction or mitigation strategist can include the following: * Designing invoices to reduce the taxable portion of a sale transaction. In Maryland, for example, a delivery charge is exempt if it is stated separately from handling and other taxable charges.What is included in the taxable price? Maryland State Comptroller's website. Retrieved 2010-05-19 * New facilities. Jurisdictions with no sales tax or broad exemptions for certain types of business operations would be an obvious consideration in selecting a site for a new manufacturing plant, warehouse, or administrative office. * Delivery location. For a businesses operating in several jurisdictions, choosing the best location in which to take delivery can reduce or eliminate the sales tax liability. That is particularly important for an item to be sold or used in another jurisdiction with a lower tax rate or an exemption for that item. Businesses should consider whether a temporary storage exemption applies to merchandise initially accepted in a jurisdiction with a higher tax rate. * Periodic review of recordkeeping procedures related to sales and use tax. Proper supporting detail, including exemption and resale certificates, invoices and other records must be available to defend the company in the event of a sales and use tax audit. Without proper documentation, a seller may be held liable for tax not collected from a buyer. In the United States, online retailers without physical presence in a given state may ship goods to customers there without collecting that state's sales tax because as of 2011, there is no federal sales tax. Amazon.com has been criticized for not collecting sales tax and has intentionally disaffiliated itself from businesses in certain states to continue doing so legally.

Specifically, it is the subgroup which is generated by reflections through the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots, and as such is a finite reflection group. Abstractly, Weyl groups are finite Coxeter groups, and are important examples of these. The Weyl group of a semisimple Lie group, a semisimple Lie algebra, a semisimple linear algebraic group, etc. is the Weyl group of the root system of that group or algebra. It is named after Hermann Weyl. Definition and examples The Weyl group of the A_2 root system is the symmetry group of an equilateral triangle Let \\\\Phi be a root system in a Euclidean space V. For each root \\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\Phi, let s_\\\\alpha denote the reflection about the hyperplane perpendicular to \\\\alpha, which is given explicitly as :s_\\\\alpha(v)=v-2\\\\frac{(\\\\alpha,v)}{(\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha)}\\\\alpha, where (\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot) is the inner product on V. The Weyl group W of \\\\Phi is the subgroup of the orthogonal group O(V) generated by all the s_\\\\alpha's. By the definition of a root system, each s_\\\\alpha preserves \\\\Phi, from which it follows that W is a finite group. In the case of the A_2 root system, for example, the hyperplanes perpendicular to the roots are just lines, and the Weyl group is the symmetry group of an equilateral triangle, as indicated in the figure. As a group, W is isomorphic to the permutation group on three elements, which we may think of as the vertices of the triangle. Note that in this case, W is not the full symmetry group of the root system; a 60-degree rotation preserves \\\\Phi but is not an element of W. We may consider also the A_n root system. In this case, V is the space of all vectors in \\\\mathbb R^{n+1} whose entries sum to zero. The roots consist of the vectors of the form e_i-e_j,\\\\,i eq j, where e_i is the ith standard basis element for \\\\mathbb R^{n+1}. The reflection associated to such a root is the transformation of V obtained by interchanging the ith and jth entries of each vector. The Weyl group for A_n is then the permutation group on n+1 elements. Weyl chambers The shaded region is the fundamental Weyl chamber for the base \\\\\\\\{\\\\alpha_1,\\\\alpha_2\\\\\\\\} If \\\\Phi\\\\subset V is a root system, we may consider the hyperplane perpendicular to each root \\\\alpha. Recall that \\\\sigma_\\\\alpha denotes the reflection about the hyperplane and that the Weyl group is the group of transformations of V generated by all the \\\\sigma_\\\\alpha's. The complement of the set of hyperplanes is disconnected, and each connected component is called a Weyl chamber. If we have fixed a particular set Œî of simple roots, we may define the fundamental Weyl chamber associated to Œî as the set of points v\\\\in V such that (\\\\alpha,v)>0 for all \\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\Delta. Since the reflections \\\\sigma_\\\\alpha,\\\\,\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\Phi preserve \\\\Phi, they also preserve the set of hyperplanes perpendicular to the roots. Thus, each Weyl group element permutes the Weyl chambers. The figure illustrates the case of the A2 root system. The \\"hyperplanes\\" (in this case, one dimensional) orthogonal to the roots are indicated by dashed lines. The six 60-degree sectors are the Weyl chambers and the shaded region is the fundamental Weyl chamber associated to the indicated base. A basic general theorem about Weyl chambers is this: Propositions 8.23 and 8.27 :Theorem: The Weyl group acts freely and transitively on the Weyl chambers. Thus, the order of the Weyl group is equal to the number of Weyl chambers. A related result is this one: Proposition 8.29 :Theorem: Fix a Weyl chamber C. Then for all v\\\\in V, the Weyl-orbit of v contains exactly one point in the closure \\\\bar C of C. Coxeter group structure =Generating set= A key result about the Weyl group is this: Propositions 8.24 :Theorem: If \\\\Delta is base for \\\\Phi, then the Weyl group is generated by the reflections s_\\\\alpha with \\\\alpha in \\\\Delta. That is to say, the group generated by the reflections s_\\\\alpha,\\\\,\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\Delta, is the same as the group generated by the reflections s_\\\\alpha,\\\\,\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\Phi. =Relations= Meanwhile, if \\\\alpha and \\\\beta are in \\\\Delta, then the Dynkin diagram for \\\\Phi relative to the base \\\\Delta tells us something about how the pair \\\\\\\\{s_\\\\alpha,s_\\\\beta\\\\\\\\} behaves. Specifically, suppose v and v' are the corresponding vertices in the Dynkin diagram. Then we have the following results: *If there is no bond between v and v', then s_\\\\alpha and s_\\\\beta commute. Since s_\\\\alpha and s_\\\\beta each have order two, this is equivalent to saying that (s_\\\\alpha s_\\\\beta)^2=1. *If there is one bond between v and v', then (s_\\\\alpha s_\\\\beta)^3=1. *If there are two bonds between v and v', then (s_\\\\alpha s_\\\\beta)^4=1. *If there are three bonds between v and v', then (s_\\\\alpha s_\\\\beta)^6=1. The preceding claim is not hard to verify, if we simply remember what the Dynkin diagram tells us about the angle between each pair of roots. If, for example, there is no bond between the two vertices, then \\\\alpha and \\\\beta are orthogonal, from which it follows easily that the corresponding reflections commute. More generally, the number of bonds determines the angle \\\\theta between the roots. The product of the two reflections is then a rotation by angle 2\\\\theta in the plane spanned by \\\\alpha and \\\\beta, as the reader may verify, from which the above claim follows easily. =As a Coxeter group= Weyl groups are examples of finite reflection groups, as they are generated by reflections; the abstract groups (not considered as subgroups of a linear group) are accordingly finite Coxeter groups, which allows them to be classified by their Coxeter‚ÄìDynkin diagram. Being a Coxeter group means that a Weyl group has a special kind of presentation in which each generator xi is of order two, and the relations other than xi2=1 are of the form (xixj)mij=1. The generators are the reflections given by simple roots, and mij is 2, 3, 4, or 6 depending on whether roots i and j make an angle of 90, 120, 135, or 150 degrees, i.e., whether in the Dynkin diagram they are unconnected, connected by a simple edge, connected by a double edge, or connected by a triple edge. We have already noted these relations in the bullet points above, but to say that W is a Coxeter group, we are saying that those are the only relations in W. Weyl groups have a Bruhat order and length function in terms of this presentation: the length of a Weyl group element is the length of the shortest word representing that element in terms of these standard generators. There is a unique longest element of a Coxeter group, which is opposite to the identity in the Bruhat order. Weyl groups in algebraic, group-theoretic, and geometric settings Above, the Weyl group was defined as a subgroup of the isometry group of a root system. There are also various definitions of Weyl groups specific to various group-theoretic and geometric contexts (Lie algebra, Lie group, symmetric space, etc.). For each of these ways of defining Weyl groups, it is a (usually nontrivial) theorem that it is a Weyl group in the sense of the definition at the top of this article, namely the Weyl group of some root system associated with the object. A concrete realization of such a Weyl group usually depends on a choice ‚Äì e.g. of Cartan subalgebra for a Lie algebra, of maximal torus for a Lie group. =The Weyl group of a connected compact Lie group= Let K be a connected compact Lie group and let T be a maximal torus in K. We then introduce the normalizer of T in K, denoted N(T) and defined as :N(T)=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in Kxtx^{-1}\\\\in T,\\\\,\\\\text{for all }t\\\\in T\\\\\\\\}. We also define the centralizer of T in K, denoted Z(T) and defined as :Z(T)=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in Kxtx^{-1}=t\\\\,\\\\text{for all }t\\\\in T\\\\\\\\}. The Weyl group W of K (relative to the given maximal torus T) is then defined initially as :W=N(T)/T. Eventually, one proves that Z(T)=T, Theorem 11.36 at which point one has an alternative description of the Weyl group as :W=N(T)/Z(T). Now, one can define a root system \\\\Phi associated to the pair (K,T); the roots are the nonzero weights of the adjoint action of T on the Lie algebra of K. For each \\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\Phi, one can construct an element x_\\\\alpha of N(T) whose action on T has the form of reflection. Propositions 11.35 With a bit more effort, one can show that these reflections generate all of N(T)/Z(T). Theorem 11.36 Thus, in the end, the Weyl group as defined as N(T)/T or N(T)/Z(T) is isomorphic to the Weyl group of the root system \\\\Phi. =In other settings= For a complex semisimple Lie algebra, the Weyl group is simply defined as the reflection group generated by reflections in the roots ‚Äì the specific realization of the root system depending on a choice of Cartan subalgebra. For a Lie group G satisfying certain conditions,Different conditions are sufficient ‚Äì most simply if G is connected and either compact, or an affine algebraic group. The definition is simpler for a semisimple (or more generally reductive) Lie group over an algebraically closed field, but a relative Weyl group can be defined for a split Lie group. given a torus T < G (which need not be maximal), the Weyl group with respect to that torus is defined as the quotient of the normalizer of the torus N = N(T) = NG(T) by the centralizer of the torus Z = Z(T) = ZG(T), :W(T,G) := N(T)/Z(T).\\\\ The group W is finite ‚Äì Z is of finite index in N. If T = T0 is a maximal torus (so it equals its own centralizer: Z(T_0) = T_0) then the resulting quotient N/Z = N/T is called the Weyl group of G, and denoted W(G). Note that the specific quotient set depends on a choice of maximal torus, but the resulting groups are all isomorphic (by an inner automorphism of G), since maximal tori are conjugate. If G is compact and connected, and T is a maximal torus, then the Weyl group of G is isomorphic to the Weyl group of its Lie algebra, as discussed above. For example, for the general linear group GL, a maximal torus is the subgroup D of invertible diagonal matrices, whose normalizer is the generalized permutation matrices (matrices in the form of permutation matrices, but with any non-zero numbers in place of the '1's), and whose Weyl group is the symmetric group. In this case the quotient map N ‚Üí N/T splits (via the permutation matrices), so the normalizer N is a semidirect product of the torus and the Weyl group, and the Weyl group can be expressed as a subgroup of G. In general this is not always the case ‚Äì the quotient does not always split, the normalizer N is not always the semidirect product of W and Z, and the Weyl group cannot always be realized as a subgroup of G. Bruhat decomposition If B is a Borel subgroup of G, i.e., a maximal connected solvable subgroup and a maximal torus T = T0 is chosen to lie in B, then we obtain the Bruhat decomposition :G = \\\\bigcup_{w\\\\in W} BwB which gives rise to the decomposition of the flag variety G/B into Schubert cells (see Grassmannian). The structure of the Hasse diagram of the group is related geometrically to the cohomology of the manifold (rather, of the real and complex forms of the group), which is constrained by Poincar√© duality. Thus algebraic properties of the Weyl group correspond to general topological properties of manifolds. For instance, Poincar√© duality gives a pairing between cells in dimension k and in dimension n - k (where n is the dimension of a manifold): the bottom (0) dimensional cell corresponds to the identity element of the Weyl group, and the dual top-dimensional cell corresponds to the longest element of a Coxeter group. Analogy with algebraic groups There are a number of analogies between algebraic groups and Weyl groups ‚Äì for instance, the number of elements of the symmetric group is n!, and the number of elements of the general linear group over a finite field is related to the q-factorial [n]_q!; thus the symmetric group behaves as though it were a linear group over \\"the field with one element\\". This is formalized by the field with one element, which considers Weyl groups to be simple algebraic groups over the field with one element. Cohomology For a non-abelian connected compact Lie group G, the first group cohomology of the Weyl group W with coefficients in the maximal torus T used to define it,W acts on T ‚Äì that is how it is defined ‚Äì and the group H^1(W; T) means \\"with respect to this action\\". is related to the outer automorphism group of the normalizer N = N_G(T), as: :\\\\operatorname{Out}(N) \\\\cong H^1(W; T) \\\\rtimes \\\\operatorname{Out}(G). The outer automorphisms of the group Out(G) are essentially the diagram automorphisms of the Dynkin diagram, while the group cohomology is computed in and is a finite elementary abelian 2-group ((\\\\mathbf{Z}/2)^k); for simple Lie groups it has order 1, 2, or 4. The 0th and 2nd group cohomology are also closely related to the normalizer.

Biography Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge's father was a wealthy wholesale dealer in Chicago. She was musically talented and studied piano as well as composition. She married the physician Frederic Shurtleff Coolidge who died from syphilis contracted from a patient during surgery, leaving her with their only child Albert. Soon after, her parents died as well. Coolidge's cousin was Lucy Sprague Mitchell, the founder of Bank Street College of Education. Coolidge provided Mitchell with funds for the founding of the school in 1916. She inherited a considerable amount of money from her parents and decided to spend it on promotion of chamber music, a mission she continued to carry out until her death at the age of 89 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Due to her husband's profession, she also gave financial support to medical institutions. Coolidge's financial resources were not unlimited but through force of personality and conviction she managed to raise the status of chamber music in the United States, where the major interest of composers had previously been in orchestral music, from curiosity to a seminal field of composition. Her devotion to music and generosity to musicians were spurred by her own experience as a performing musician: she appeared as a pianist up to her 80s, accompanying world-renowned instrumentalists. Coolidge established the Berkshire String Quartet in 1916 and started the Berkshire Music Festival at South Mountain, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, two years later. Out of this grew the Berkshire Symphonic Festival at Tanglewood, which she also supported. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1951. Elizabeth's only son, Albert, graduated from the Harvard University and was a chemical physicist, political activist, and civil libertarian.  Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Medals  In 1932, Coolidge established the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Medal for \\"eminent services to chamber music.\\" The medals were initially awarded by the Library of Congress. But, in 1949 -- after objections by U.S. Congressmen over the appropriateness of a government body awarding prizes in fine arts and literature to individuals who might harbor dissident views towards the U.S. (re: Ezra Pound and the Bollingen Prize) -- the Library of Congress discontinued awarding medals of any kind, including (i) the Bollingen Prize, the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Medal for \\"eminent services to chamber music, and (iii) three prizes endowed by Lessing Rosenwald in connection with an annual national exhibition of prints.William McGuire, Poetry's Catbird Seat (the consultantship in poetry in the English language at the Library of Congress, 1937-1987), Library of Congress, Washington, 1988 = Recipients = Earlier Coolidge Prizes and Commissions * 1918 - Tadeusz IareckiNew York Public Library, Tadeusz Iarecki Quartet for strings, op. 21 * 1919 - Ernest Bloch: Chamber Music Prize for the Berkshire Festival * 1920 - Gian Francesco Malipiero * 1921 - Harry Waldo Warner (1874‚Äì1945) * 1922 - Leo Weiner: Chamber Music Prize for the Berkshire Festival * 1923 - Commissions for the Berkshire Festival: : Eugene Goosens : Rebecca Clarke * 1927 - Mario Pilati: Sonata for flute and piano * 1936 - Jerzy Fitelberg: String Quartet no. 4 Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Medals for Eminent Services to Chamber Music * Louis Gruenberg, Four Diversions, string quartet, composed in 1930Don Michael Randel, The Harvard biographical Dictionary of Music, Harvard University Press (1996) * Frank Bridge (1938) * Abbey SimonDavid M.

The Sprague Memorial Hall at Yale University was also financed by Coolidge.  Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Foundation  Her most innovative and costly endeavor, however, was her partnership with the Library of Congress, resulting in the construction of the 500-seat Coolidge Auditorium, specifically intended for chamber music, in 1924. This was accompanied by the establishment of the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Foundation to organize concerts in that auditorium and to commission new chamber music from both European and American composers, as it continues to do today.  Support of composers and musical works  Coolidge had a reputation for promoting \\"difficult\\" modern music (though she declined to support one of the most modern of all composers, Charles Ives). But she never aimed at such a reputation and explained her preferences in music as follows: \\"My plea for modern music is not that we should like it, nor necessarily that we should even understand it, but that we should exhibit it as a significant human document.\\" Though American herself, she had no national preferences, and in fact most of her commissions went to European composers.Banfield, Stephen. \\"Too Much of Albion\\"?: Mrs Coolidge and her British Connections, in American Music, Vol 4 No 1 (Spring 1986) She didn't have any urge to specifically promote women composers, either. She sponsored the 1927 tour of the United States of composer Ottorino Respighi and his wife, the soprano Elsa. The conclusion of the tour was a program held at the Library of Congress chamber music hall that she had funded, and at that occasion Respighi promised to dedicate his next musical composition to Mrs. Coolidge. That composition turned out to be the Trittico Botticelliano, inspired by three Botticelli paintings on display at the Uffizi museum in Florence, Italy. The first performance of the work was at a concert in Vienna at the end of that same year, with the Respighis in attendance. The most lasting memorial to Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge's patronage of music are the compositions which she commissioned from many leading composers of the early 20th century. Among the best-known of those compositions are the following: * Samuel Barber: Hermit Songs, Op. 29 * B√©la Bart√≥k: String Quartet No. 5 * Benjamin Britten: String Quartet No. 1 * Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco: String Quartet No. 1, Op. 58 * Aaron Copland: Appalachian Spring * Arthur Honegger: Concerto da camera * Gian Francesco Malipiero: First Piano Concerto (1937) * Gabriel Piern√© : Sonata da Camera pour fl√ªte, violoncelle et piano * Francis Poulenc: Flute Sonata * Sergei Prokofiev: String Quartet No. 1 * Maurice Ravel: Chansons mad√©casses * Arnold Schoenberg: String Quartet No. 3, String Quartet No. 4 * Igor Stravinsky: Apollon musag√®te * Anton Webern: String Quartet * Sir Arthur Bliss: Oboe Quintet * Ottorino Respighi: Trittico Botticelliano Other composers supported by Coolidge include Ernest Bloch, Frank Bridge, Alfredo Casella, George Enescu, Howard Hanson, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Paul Hindemith, Bohuslav Martin≈Ø, Darius Milhaud, Rebecca Helferich Clarke, Cyril Rootham and Albert Roussel.

Suffragan bishops may be charged by a metropolitan to oversee a suffragan diocese and may be assigned to areas which do not have a cathedral of their own. In the Catholic Church, a suffragan bishop instead leads a diocese within an ecclesiastical province other than the principal diocese, the metropolitan archdiocese. Anglican Communion In the Anglican churches, the term applies to a bishop who is assigned responsibilities to support a diocesan bishop. For example, the Bishop of Jarrow is a suffragan to the diocesan Bishop of Durham. Suffragan bishops in the Anglican Communion are nearly identical in their role to auxiliary bishops in the Roman Catholic Church. =England= History English diocesan bishops were commonly assisted by bishops who had been consecrated to sees which were in partibus infidelium (titular sees that had in most cases been conquered by Muslims) before the English Reformation. The separation of the English Church from Rome meant that this was no longer possible. The Suffragan Bishops Act 1534 allowed for the creation of new sees to allow these assistant bishops, who were named as suffragan. Before then, the term suffragan referred to diocesan bishops in relation to their metropolitan. The concept of a suffragan bishop in the Church of England was legalised by the Suffragan Bishops Act 1534. The first bishops consecrated under that Act were Thomas Manning, Bishop of Ipswich and John Salisbury, Bishop of Thetford on 19 March 1536. The last Tudor suffragan bishop in post was John Sterne, Bishop of Colchester, who died in post in 1607/8. No more suffragans were appointed for more than 250 years, until the consecration of Henry Mackenzie as Bishop of Nottingham on 2 February 1870.Consecration details (version archived 17 November 2009) (Accessed 25 June 2016) At that point, the sees of suffragans were still limited to the 26 towns named in the 1534 Act; the Suffragans Nomination Act 1888 allowed the creation of new suffragan sees besides the 26 so named. The appointment of bishops suffragan became much more common thereafter. Today =Area bishops= Some Church of England suffragan bishops are legally delegated responsibility by the diocesan bishop for a specific geographical area within the diocese. For example, the Bishop of Colchester is an area bishop in the Diocese of Chelmsford. Such area schemes are presently found in the dioceses of: * London (since 1979): Two Cities (overseen by the diocesan), Edmonton, Kensington, Stepney, Willesden. * Chelmsford (since 1983): Barking, Bradwell, Colchester. * Oxford (since 1984): Oxford (overseen by the diocesan), Buckingham, Dorchester, Reading. * Southwark (since 1991): Croydon, Kingston, Woolwich. * Lichfield (since 1992): Shrewsbury, Stafford, Wolverhampton. * Leeds (since 2014): Bradford, Huddersfield, Leeds (overseen by the Bishop of Kirkstall), Ripon, Wakefield. Area schemes have previously existed in Worcester diocese (1993‚Äì2002; Worcester (overseen by the diocesan), Dudley),GS 1445: Report of the Dioceses Commission, Diocese of Worcester (Accessed 23 April 2014) Salisbury diocese (1981‚Äì2009; Ramsbury, Sherborne),Salisbury Diocesan Synod minutes ‚Äì 99th session, 7 November 2009 p. 3 (Accessed 23 April 2014) Lincoln diocese (2010Diocese of Lincoln Central Services Review ‚Äì Report to the Bishop of Lincoln (Accessed 23 April 2014)‚Äì31 January 2013; Grantham, Grimsby)Diocese of Lincoln Central Services Review ‚Äì Response from the Bishop of Lincoln (Accessed 23 April 2014) and Chichester diocese (1984‚Äì2013; Chichester (overseen by the diocesan), Lewes, Horsham). Other suffragans have or have had informal responsibility for geographical areas (e.g. in Winchester,Diocese of Winchester: Vacancy in See ‚Äì Background to the Diocese, 2011 (Accessed 23 April 2014) Peterborough,Ministry in the Diocese of Peterborough (Accessed 23 April 2014) and York), but these are not referred to as area bishops. =Suffragan bishops= Only the small Dioceses of Portsmouth and of Sodor and Man do not have a suffragan bishop. Until 2016/2017, the Dioceses of Newcastle and of Leicester each had a stipendiary assistant bishop instead of suffragans, but these have since been replaced with suffragan bishops. =Provincial episcopal visitors= Suffragan bishops in the Church of England who have oversight of parishes and clergy that reject the ministry of priests who are women, usually across a whole province, are known as provincial episcopal visitors (PEVs) (or \\"flying bishops\\"). This concession was made in 1992 following the General Synod's vote to ordain women to the priesthood. The first PEV was John Gaisford, Bishop of Beverley, who was consecrated on 7 March 1994. =Wales= An early example of a suffragan can be seen in Wales is Penrydd, established in 1537, when the Welsh dioceses were still within the Church of England. The Bishop of Swansea was a suffragan in the Diocese of St David's from 1890 till the erection of the diocese in 1923. Since disestablishment, Thomas Lloyd was suffragan Bishop of Maenan in the Diocese of St Asaph, when the bishop diocesan was also Archbishop of Wales. =Ireland= The Church of Ireland has no suffragan bishops, not even in the geographically large dioceses. =United States= Suffragan bishops are fairly common in larger dioceses of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America (ECUSA), but usually have no responsibility for a specific geographical part of a diocese. ECUSA is not within the jurisdiction of the English law that requires diocesan and suffragan bishops to be appointed as bishop to a specific place, and so suffragans are not given the title of any particular city within the diocese. For example, Bishop Barbara Harris was titled simply ‚ÄúSuffragan Bishop of Massachusetts‚Äù. Coadjutor and assistant bishops are different episcopal offices than suffragan. A coadjutor is elected by a diocesan convention to become the diocesan bishop (also called \\"the ordinary\\") upon the ordinary's retirement. A suffragan is also elected by a convention, but does not automatically succeed the diocesan bishop. However a suffragan's office does continue in the diocese until he or she chooses to retire. An assistant bishop is appointed by the diocesan bishop, and his or her office ends when the ordinary who appointed her or him leaves office. =Canada= Some Anglican Church of Canada suffragan bishops are legally delegated responsibility by the diocesan bishop for a specific geographical area within the diocese. *Toronto: York-Scarborough, York-Credit Valley, Trent-Durham, York-Simcoe. =Acting bishops= It is common for Anglican suffragan or assistant bishops to serve as acting bishop during a vacancy in the diocesan see (e.g., between the death or retirement of the bishop diocesan and their successor taking post). In order to achieve this, the metropolitan bishop commissions a suffragan/assistant (usually the full-time bishop senior by consecration) who becomes the episcopal commissary, but may be referred to by any number of phrases (since the commission is held from the metropolitan archbishop, she may be called archbishop's commissary; the most usual current term in the Church of England being Acting Bishop of Somewhere). In the Anglican Church of Australia, someone (not always a bishop) acting as diocesan bishop is the Administrator of the Diocese and a bishop so commissioned is called the Bishop Administrator.Diocese of Newcastle ‚Äî Peter Stuart (Archived 12 October 2013; accessed 15 November 2016) In 2013, between the retirement of Nigel McCulloch and the confirmation of David Walker as Bishop of Manchester, both of that diocese's suffragan bishops (Chris Edmondson, Bishop of Bolton, and Mark Davies, Bishop of Middleton, who were consecrated on the same day, therefore neither had seniority) served as acting bishop co-equally.Diocese of Manchester ‚Äì Bishop of Manchester has retired (Accessed 15 November 2016) In 2014‚Äì2015, during the vacancy between the episcopates of Paul Butler and Paul Williams, the diocese's sole suffragan bishop, Tony Porter, Bishop of Sherwood, became Acting Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham; however, when he resigned the commission due to ill health, Richard Inwood (retired former Bishop of Bedford and an honorary assistant bishop of the diocese) was commissioned Acting Bishop for a fixed one-year term.Diocese of Southwell & Nottingham ‚Äì Richard Inwood takes temporary charge (Accessed 15 November 2016) Roman Catholic Church In the Roman Catholic Church, a suffragan is a bishop who heads a diocese. His suffragan diocese, however, is part of a larger ecclesiastical province, nominally led by a metropolitan archbishop. The distinction between metropolitans and suffragans is of limited practical importance. Both are diocesan bishops possessing ordinary jurisdiction over their individual sees. The metropolitan has few responsibilities over the suffragans in his province and no direct authority over the faithful outside of his own diocese. Bishops who assist diocesan bishops are usually called auxiliary bishops. If the assisting bishop has special faculties (typically the right to succeed the diocesan bishop) he would be called a coadjutor bishop. Since they are not in charge of a suffragan diocese, they are not referred to as \\"suffragan bishops\\".

After the death of the 7th and last Earl in 1972, the estate passed to Liverpool City Council, which now manages the remainder of the estate, following the sale of approximately half of the grounds. The remaining grounds, Croxteth Park, were at one time a hunting chase of the Molyneux family and are now open to the public. The hall is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The original house was built in about 1575, and has been expanded in several stages in Tudor, Georgian, and Queen Anne styles. The principal front, the west fa√ßade, was built in 1702. During this period, a bakery and a brewery were built though during the Victorian era these were demolished. In 1874 a wing was added for visitors to the hall to stay in. Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, and their children stayed at Croxteth Hall on 9 October 1851 before visiting Liverpool the following day during torrential rain. However, the visit started fine with 700 members of the local gentry being entertained in the Hall grounds.Illustrated London News October 1851 The Hall and its outbuilding are a Grade II* Listed Building, as are 3 of the outbuildings; another 15 buildings on the estate are Grade II. The Molyneux family lived at the Hall from the 16th century until 1972, when the last Earl died. His American-born widow Josephine, Countess of Sefton (1903‚Äì1980) ‚Äì once a close friend of the Duchess of Windsor and nicknamed \\"Foxy\\" for her abundant auburn hair ‚Äì continued to spend some time at Croxteth. She became the last member of the Molyneux family to reside in the hall. When the last Earl died in 1972, a worldwide search was made for an heir to the title but without success. Much of the original estate has since been sold off for development, but approximately remain as a country park, which is open to the public and includes various play facilities for children. The estate also contains the historic Hall itself, open to the public for a small fee, as well as a maintained Victorian walled garden and a working country farm. The walled garden is home to what remains of the Liverpool Botanics. This is one of the oldest horticultural collections in Britain, founded by William Roscoe in 1802. Amongst the tropical plants is the National Collection of Dracaena (dragon trees); there are orchids and the National Collection of Codiaeum; pelargoniums and the National Collection of Solenostemon (coleus) as well as a rich collection of bromeliads. Liverpool was once world-famous for its orchids as the collection is composed mainly of wild collected species rather than the more usual garden hybrids. In March 2013, it was announced that a ¬£400,000 programme would be undertaken to restore the damaged Queen Anne wing which was gutted by fire in 1952. Future Liverpool City Council announced in 2017 that they were looking for bids from developers to manage the hall and park with the facility costing the council over ¬£1 million a year to run. By January 2018, two bids had been submitted to run the hall and park, one of which planned to use the facility as a luxury hotel, spa and wedding venue. However, by March 2018 the council announced plans to run the facility itself, aiming to develop it into a tourist attraction, hosting concerts, fairs and markets. The park The park is listed at Grade II. It also contains Mull Wood, which is part of the Croxteth Local Nature Reserve. In partnership with Lancashire Wildlife Trust, the reserve was doubled in size. This allows people better access to the reserve areas and include new habitats within the reserve. One of the improvements to Mull Wood is the sowing of a Wildflower Meadow, situated near the Old Kennels. Myerscough College operate their Liverpool campus from part of the Hall, at which they teach 350 full- time students. See Myerscough College Liverpool Homepage The \\"Friends of Croxteth Hall and Country Park\\" support the work of Liverpool's major stately home. The Friends hold a variety of fun events to raise funds. Among the things they have paid for are benches, plants, equipment, and horticultural studies. Kennels The kennels in Croxteth Hall Lane were built in the 1870s and are a Grade II listed building. They were designed by the Chester architect John Douglas for the 4th Earl of Sefton. The kennels are built in red brick with a patterned roof of blue and green slates. The building is in one storey and has three bays; the left two bays consist of the kennels and the bay on the right is higher with a steeper half-hipped roof. There is a tall brick chimney stack.

She has two RIAA-certified multi-platinum albums, five platinum albums, three gold albums, and 15 Billboard Top 40 singles, including the Top 10 hits \\"Hit Me with Your Best Shot\\", \\"Love Is a Battlefield\\", \\"We Belong\\", and \\"Invincible\\". She was nominated for a 2020 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Life and career =1953‚Äì1978: Early life and career beginnings= Pat Benatar was born Patricia Mae Andrzejewski on January 10, 1953, in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, New York City. Her mother, Mildred (n√©e Knapp) (1928‚Äì2016), was a beautician, and her father, Andrew () Andrzejewski (1926‚Äì2009), was a sheet-metal worker. Her father was of Polish descent and her mother was of German, English, and Irish ancestry. Her family moved to North Hamilton Avenue in Lindenhurst, New York, a village in the Long Island town of Babylon.James, Carolyn. [\\"Pat Benatar gets key to Babylon Town: Former resident honored for outstanding achievement\\"], The Beacon, August 22, 2002 Benatar became interested in theater and began voice lessons, singing her first solo at the age of eight, at Daniel Street Elementary School, a song called \\"It Must Be Spring\\". At Lindenhurst Senior High School (1967‚Äì1971), she participated in musical theatre, playing Queen Guinevere in the school production of Camelot, marching in the homecoming parade, singing at the annual Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony, and performing a solo of \\"The Christmas Song\\" on a holiday recording of the Lindenhurst High School Choir in her senior year. Benatar trained as a coloratura with plans to attend the Juilliard School, but decided instead to pursue health education at Stony Brook University. At 19, after one year at Stony Brook, she dropped out to marry her first husband, high school sweetheart Dennis Benatar, a U.S. Army draftee who trained at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, then served with the Army Security Agency at Fort Devens, Massachusetts, before being stationed at Fort Lee, Virginia, where he remained on duty for three years. Pat Benatar worked as a bank teller near Richmond, Virginia. In 1971, Benatar quit her job to pursue a singing career after being inspired by a Liza Minnelli concert she saw in Richmond. She got a job as a singing waitress at a nightclub named The Roaring Twenties and got a spot singing in the lounge band Coxon's Army, a regular at Sam Miller's basement club. The band was the subject of a never- aired PBS special; its bassist Roger Capps was later the original bass player for the Pat Benatar Band. The period also yielded Benatar's first and only single until her eventual 1979 single (taken from the album In the Heat of the Night on Chrysalis Records): \\"Day Gig\\" (1974), Trace Records, written and produced by Coxon's Army band leader Phil Coxon and locally released in Richmond. In 1975, Benatar performed at an amateur night at the comedy club Catch a Rising Star in New York. Her rendition of Judy Garland's \\"Rock-a-Bye Your Baby With a Dixie Melody\\" earned her a callback by club owner Rick Newman, who then became her manager. The couple moved to New York following Dennis Benatar's discharge from the Army, and Pat Benatar became a regular member at Catch a Rising Star for the next three years. In 1975 she landed the part of Zephyr in Harry Chapin's futuristic rock musical, The Zinger, which ran for a month in 1976 at the Performing Arts Foundation's (PAF) Playhouse in Huntington Station, Long Island. Halloween 1977 proved a pivotal night in Benatar's early, spandexed stage persona. She entered a Halloween contest at the Cafe Figaro in Greenwich Village dressed as a character from the film Cat- Women of the Moon. Later that evening, she went onstage at Catch a Rising Star still in costume. Between appearances at Catch a Rising Star, she recorded commercial jingles for Pepsi-Cola and a number of regional brands. She headlined New York City's Tramps nightclub over four days in spring 1978, where her performance was heard by representatives from several record companies. She was signed to Chrysalis Records by co-founder Terry Ellis the following week. Pat Benatar and Dennis Benatar divorced shortly after, although she kept his surname. =1979‚Äì1981: In the Heat of the Night and Crimes of Passion= Benatar's debut album In the Heat of the Night was released in August 1979, and reached #12 in the US in early 1980. Mike Chapman produced three tracks on the album, while engineer Peter Coleman oversaw the rest. In addition, Chapman and his songwriting partner, Nicky Chinn, wrote three songs that appear on the LP: \\"In the Heat of the Night\\" and \\"If You Think You Know How to Love Me\\" which were previously recorded by Smokie, and a rearranged version of a song they wrote for Sweet, \\"No You Don't\\". The album also featured two songs written by Roger Capps and Benatar, \\"I Need a Lover\\" written by John Mellencamp, and \\"Don't Let It Show\\", written by Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in December 1980. In Canada it was certified 4√ó platinum where it peaked at number 3 on the RPM albums chart. \\"If You Think You Know How to Love Me\\" was the first single to be released on September 14, 1979. However, it was unsuccessful. Benatar's second single \\"Heartbreaker\\" was released on October 26, 1979 and became a hit, climbing to #23 in the US. A third single \\"We Live for Love\\", which was written by her future husband Neil Giraldo, was released in February 1980, and reached US #27. In August 1980, Benatar released her LP, Crimes of Passion, featuring her signature song \\"Hit Me with Your Best Shot\\" along with the controversial song \\"Hell Is for Children\\", which was inspired by reading a series of articles in the New York Times about child abuse in America. \\"Hit Me With Your Best Shot\\" (US #9) was her first single to break the US Top 10 and sold more than one million copies (gold status) in the United States. The album peaked for five consecutive weeks at #2 in the US in January 1981 (behind John Lennon's and Yoko Ono's Double Fantasy) and a month later, Benatar won her first Grammy Award for \\"Best Female Rock Vocal Performance\\" of 1980 for the album. Other singles released from Crimes of Passion were \\"Treat Me Right\\" (US #18) and the Rascals' cover, \\"You Better Run\\" (US #42), which was the second music video ever played on MTV, after the Buggles' \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\".Trouser Press claims that the second video on MTV was by Todd Rundgren. The album also featured a changed-tempo cover of Kate Bush's \\"Wuthering Heights\\". Produced by Keith Olsen, Crimes of Passion remained on the US album charts for 93 weeks and in the top 10 for more than six months, eventually becoming her first platinum certification by the RIAA. In October 1980, Benatar (along with future husband Neil Giraldo) appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. The album was certified 5x platinum in Canada, her best selling album in that country, where it peaked at number 2 on the album charts. =1982‚Äì1983: Precious Time, Get Nervous, and Live from Earth= In July 1981, her third LP, Precious Time was released. A month later, the album hit #1 on the Billboard US Top 200 LP chart. It was also her first to chart in the UK, reaching #30. The album's lead single, \\"Fire and Ice\\" (co-written by band member Scott Sheets), was another big hit (US #17, AUS #30) and won Benatar her second Grammy Award, this time for \\"Best Female Rock Vocal Performance\\" of 1981 and her third consecutive RIAA certified platinum album. In Canada it was certified double platinum and peaked at #2 on the album chart. \\"Promises in the Dark\\" (US #38) was also released. In August 1981, Benatar's video for \\"You Better Run\\" was the second clip aired by MTV, after the Buggles song \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\". The Benatar video was specifically chosen by MTV to echo the message to the radio industry contained in \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\", that things were going to change. A hit single, \\"Shadows of the Night\\", (US #13, AUS #19) heralded a new LP, Get Nervous, released in late 1982. The album was another smash, reaching US #4, her fourth consecutive RIAA and CRIA platinum certification, and the single garnered Benatar her third Grammy, again for \\"Best Female Rock Vocal Performance\\" of 1982. The follow-up singles, \\"Little Too Late\\" and \\"Looking for a Stranger\\", were also successful, hitting US #20 and #39. The WWII-themed music video for \\"Shadows of the Night\\" featured then-unknown actors Judge Reinhold as an American fighter copilot and Bill Paxton as a German radio operator. The album was certified platinum in Canada where it peaked at #16 on the album chart. By 1983, Benatar had established a reputation for singing about \\"tough\\" subject matters, best exemplified by one of the biggest hits of her career, \\"Love Is a Battlefield\\" (penned by noted hit songwriter Holly Knight with Mike Chapman), released in December 1983. By then, her sound had mellowed from hard rock to more atmospheric pop and the story-based video clip for \\"Love Is a Battlefield\\" was aimed squarely at MTV, even featuring Benatar in a Michael Jackson-inspired group dance number. This new pop/rock direction was a huge commercial success, with the single peaking at number 5 in the United States, and #1 in Australia for seven consecutive weeks. The song gained interest in the UK where it peaked at #49. The song also netted Benatar her fourth consecutive Grammy Award for \\"Best Female Rock Vocal Performance\\" of 1983. A live album, Live from Earth, which was recorded during Benatar's sold-out 'Get Nervous' world tour of America and Europe in 1982 and 1983, contained two studio tracks, \\"Love Is a Battlefield\\" and \\"Lipstick Lies\\". The album peaked at US #13 and became her fifth consecutive RIAA and CRIA platinum winner. The album peaked at 25 on the Canadian albums chart. =1984‚Äì1986: Tropico, Seven the Hard Way= In August 1984, Benatar released her fifth studio album, Tropico (US #14, AUS #9, UK #31). The single \\"We Belong\\", released in October 1984, a month prior to the album release, became another top 10 hit in the US peaking at #5 and #7 in Australia. It was also Benatar's first ever UK top 40 hit, where it peaked at #22. A second single release, \\"Ooh Ooh Song\\", reached US #36. It is also said by Benatar and Giraldo that this album is the first where they moved away from Benatar's famed \\"hard rock\\" sound and start experimenting with new, sometimes \\"gentler\\", styles and sounds. Despite not quite making the US Top 10, it immediately earned her a sixth consecutive RIAA and CRIA platinum-certified album. In Canada, the album peaked at 21 on the album charts. After the chart success of \\"We Belong\\" in the UK, \\"Love is a Battlefield\\" was re-released in early 1985 and became her highest chart hit there, reaching #17. \\"We Belong\\" was also nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 1986. Benatar's first nomination in that category. In 1985, she released her sixth studio album, Seven the Hard Way. Benatar hit the US Top 10 with the Grammy nominated single \\"Invincible\\" (the theme from the movie The Legend of Billie Jean) (#10) which was written by Holly Knight (Love Is a Battlefield) and Simon Climie in 1985, three full months before the album was released. Her other Grammy nominated single, \\"Sex As a Weapon\\", climbed as high as #28 in January 1986, and \\"Le Bel Age\\" (#54) in February. The album Seven the Hard Way peaked at #26, earning an RIAA Gold certification (import CD). In Canada, it was her seventh consecutive platinum certified album and it peaked at 36 on the albums sales chart. In Benatar's autobiography, Between a Heart and a Rock Place, she said, \\"Out of all the albums, Seven the Hard Way cost the most to make and sold the least.\\" The album sold approximately 600,000 US copies. =1987‚Äì1988: Best Shots and Wide Awake in Dreamland= In July 1988, Benatar released her seventh studio album, Wide Awake in Dreamland (US #28, UK #11). The Grammy-nominated lead single, \\"All Fired Up\\" (written by Kerryn Tolhurst, ex-The Dingoes) reached #19 in both the U.S. and the U.K., and was a #2 smash in Australia, becoming one of the biggest hits of 1988 in that country. Other singles released from the LP are \\"Don't Walk Away\\" (UK #42), the Grammy nominated \\"Let's Stay Together\\", and \\"One Love\\" (UK #59). The album also earned an RIAA gold certification and was her eighth consecutive platinum certified album in Canada, where it peaked at 11 on the album chart. =1989‚Äìpresent: True Love, Gravity's Rainbow, and Go= Benatar performing in Sydney, October 2010 True Love was a jump blues record, released in late April 1991, and featured the blues band Roomful of Blues, backing up Pat Benatar, Neil Giraldo and Myron Grombacher. The album sold over 339,000Billboard copies without significant radio airplay and limited exposure on VH-1. \\"Payin' the Cost to Be the Boss\\", \\"So Long\\", and the title cut were released as singles. The album reached #40 in the UK and #37 in the US. It was certified gold in Canada for sales of 50,000 units, her first to not achieve platinum status and her last certified album for that country where it peaked at 22 on the albums sales chart. Gravity's Rainbow (US #85) was released in 1993 and was a return to the AOR genre. \\"Everybody Lay Down\\" was picked up by Album Rock radio and went all the way to #3. The single was never released to Top 40/Contemporary Hit Radio and a music video was never produced. \\"Somebody's Baby\\" was instead released as the single to Top 40 radio and a music video produced. In Canada the album peaked at 44 on the albums sale charts. A third track was scheduled and a video shot for \\"Everytime I Fall Back\\", but the single was never released and the music video was lost when Chrysalis was sold to EMI Records. Benatar had become pregnant again and it may have had an effect on her label's support of the album. The tour for this album was only seven dates, cut short because of the pregnancy. It was Benatar's last album recorded for Chrysalis. With very little promotion from Chrysalis, Gravity's Rainbow failed to have the same commercial success as Benatar's previous work. According to SoundScan, the album sold approximately 160,000 copies in the United States. It is currently available in a two-in-one release with True Love (import). Innamorata (US #171) was released in 1997 on the CMC International record label. A single video was produced for \\"Strawberry Wine (Life is Sweet)\\". According to SoundScan, the album sold close to 65,000 copies. Benatar has released only one album of new material since 1997's Innamorata, which is 2003's Go (US #187). The album included the 9/11 charity single, \\"Christmas in America\\" as a bonus track. A video was produced for the single \\"Have It All\\", but was never released until it was leaked on YouTube in 2012; the only video from this album is for the bonus track. They reunited with Holly Knight with Neil and Holly cowriting the tune \\"Girl\\". The hard rock title track \\"Go!\\" became a popular performance song for Benatar's future concerts. According to SoundScan, the album has now sold nearly 34,000 copies. In November 2015, Benatar recorded and released a holiday song called \\"One December Night\\". In January 2017, Benatar recorded the song \\"Shine\\" to support the Women's March on January 21, 2017. This is her first original non-holiday recording in over 10 years. In September of the same year Benatar again teamed with songwriter and producer Linda Perry for the song \\"Dancing Through the Wreckage\\", which was the lead single from the soundtrack for the documentary Served Like a Girl. In October 2017 the song entered the Billboard Adult Contemporary Chart, eventually peaking at #22 in November. The song also received a nomination for Best Song from a Documentary from the Critics' Choice Awards.

The proceeds from her tickets sales, however, were donated to organizations to help fund the reversal of those laws *2017: Let's Go Tour *2018: Almost II Tour *2019: 40th Anniversary Tour =Memoir= In June 2010, Benatar's memoir, Between a Heart and a Rock Place was released. The book was published by HarperCollins and was acquired by Lisa Sharkey. Benatar's memoir touches on her battles with her record company Chrysalis, the difficulties that her career caused in her personal life, and feminism. In the memoir, she is quoted as saying, \\"For every day since I was old enough to think, I've considered myself a feminist ‚Ä¶ It's empowering to watch and to know that, perhaps in some way, I made the hard path [women] have to walk just a little bit easier.\\" The book went on to become a New York Times bestseller. Initially reluctant to undertake the project, she found the actual writing process so enjoyable that it inspired her with plans to write a novel. In summer 2011, Benatar announced she was working on a Christmas album and a novel about the second coming of Christ. Band Although billed as a solo artist, Benatar recorded and toured with a consistent set of band members over most of her career: * Neil \\"Spyder\\" Giraldo (incorrectly spelled as \\"Geraldo\\" in early liner notes/credits) is the lead guitarist of the band and has performed on all of Benatar's albums. * Myron Grombacher, who played with Neil in Rick Derringer's touring band, is drummer on nine of Benatar's original albums and has numerous writing credits. Myron is easily recognizable in the music videos, particularly as the mad dentist in \\"Anxiety (Get Nervous)\\". * Charlie Giordano performed keyboard duties on five albums and is identifiable by his glasses and distinctive array of berets, blazers, and 80s-style ties. In 2007, he replaced the late Danny Federici in the E Street Band. * Mick Mahan is the band's bassist and has performed with Benatar since 1995. The original bassist, Roger Capps, was replaced by Donnie Nossov on Tropico, and then later by Frank Linx. *Chris Ralles is the band's current drummer. *Scott St. Clair Sheets (Scott Sheets) who was originally the lead guitarist of the infamous Seventies NYC band, The Brats, was an original member of the Pat Benatar Band. Sheets is credited as guitarist on the first 3 albums and first 3 world tours. He wrote the song \\"Prisoner of Love\\" for the Crimes of Passion album and co- wrote the hit \\"Fire and Ice\\" for the Precious Time album. * Glen Alexander Hamilton played drums on the first album. Other achievements Benatar and Giraldo, October 2010 =Stage and screen appearances= * Benatar played the role of Jeanette Florescu in the film Union City (1980), directed by Mark Reichert. * Benatar played the character Zephyr in Harry Chapin's futuristic rock musical The Zinger. Benatar performed the solo \\"Shooting Star\\" in honor of Chapin for the Harry Chapin Tribute, Carnegie Hall, December 7, 1987. * Benatar has made numerous television appearances, mostly as herself. She appeared with her husband Neil Giraldo in the Charmed episode \\"Lucky Charmed\\" on which \\"Heartbreaker\\" was used and in an episode of Dharma & Greg as herself singing \\"We've Only Just Begun\\" at an impromptu wedding in an airport. In 2001, she also appeared as fictional rock star Anna Raines in the CBS television drama Family Law with Dixie Carter and Christopher McDonald. Benatar also appeared on That 80's Show as herself. * Benatar appeared as a special guest at the sixth annual VH1 Divas concert, VH1 Divas Duets, performing \\"Heartbreaker\\" with Giraldo and headliner Lisa Marie Pressley, with the married couple interviewed by Sharon Osbourne following the performance. * In 2006, Benatar and her music were featured on CMT Crossroads, an episode that paired her with country singer Martina McBride. * Benatar and Giraldo performed in the Tiny Desk Concerts series of NPR Music on 14 November 2014. At the Tiny Desk, Benatar and Giraldo ran through three of their classic songs: \\"We Live For Love,\\" \\"We Belong\\" and \\"Promises In The Dark\\". * Her version of the song ‚ÄúWe Belong‚Äù was featured in the 2006 comedy film Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, starring Will Ferrell and directed by Adam McKay. =Advertising= In 2006, the song \\"We Belong\\" was part of a $20 million ad campaign for Sheraton Hotels, although the version used in the commercial was not Benatar's. In 2013 Pat Benatar contributed an original song Passion for a Jello Fruit commercial. In 2019, \\"Hit Me With Your Best Shot\\" was used in a Chili's commercial, promoting their new fajitas and We Belong was used in a Pepsi commercial.

G.dmt full-rate ADSL expands the usable bandwidth of existing copper telephone lines, delivering high-speed data communications at rates up to 8 Mbit/s downstream and 1.3 Mbit/s upstream. DMT allocates from 2 to 15 bits per channel (bin). As line conditions change, bit swapping allows the modem to swap bits around different channels, without retraining, as each channel becomes more or less capable. If bit swapping is disabled then this does not happen and the modem needs to retrain in order to adapt to changing line conditions. There are 2 competing standards for DMT ADSL - ANSI and G.dmt; ANSI T1.413 is a North American standard, G.992.1 (G.dmt) is an ITU (United Nations Telecom committee) standard. G.dmt is used most commonly today, throughout the world, but the ANSI standard was formerly popular in North America. There is a difference in framing between the two, and selecting the wrong standard can cause frame alignment errors every 5 or so minutes. Error correction is done using Reed-Solomon encoding and further protection can be used if Trellis encoding is used at both ends. Interleaving can also increase the robustness of the line but increases latency. DMT history and line rates ADSL2+ and VDSL Line rate obtainable (Mbit/s) against corresponding line attenuation (dB) for ADSL, ADSL2 and ADSL2+ Modulation is the overlaying of information (or the signal) onto an electronic or optical carrier waveform. There are two competing and incompatible standards for modulating the ADSL signal, known as discrete multitone modulation (DMT) and Carrierless Amplitude Phase (CAP). CAP was the original technology used for DSL deployments, but the most widely used method now is DMT. The graphs on the right summarise the speeds obtainable for each ADSL standard based on line length and attenuation. The second graph is of more importance since it is attenuation which is the governing factor for line speed because attenuation rate over distance can vary significantly between various copper lines due to their quality and other factors. ADSL2 is able to extend the reach of extremely long lines that have around 90 dB attenuation. Standard ADSL is only able to provide a service on lines with an attenuation no greater than about 75 dB. DMT technical details =Bins (carrier channels)= Discrete Multi-Tone (DMT), the most widely used modulation method, separates the ADSL signal into 255 carriers (bins) centred on multiples of 4.3125 kHz. DMT has 224 downstream frequency bins and up to 31 upstream bins. Bin 0 is at DC and is not used. When voice (POTS) is used on the same line, then bin 7 is the lowest bin used for ADSL. The centre frequency of bin N is (N x 4.3125) kHz. The spectrum of each bin overlaps that of its neighbours: it is not confined to a 4.3125 kHz wide channel. The orthogonality of COFDM makes this possible without interference. Up to 15 bits per symbol can be encoded in a bin on a good quality line. The frequency layout can be summarised as: * 30 Hz-4 kHz, voice. * 4‚Äì25 kHz, unused guard band. * 25‚Äì138 kHz, 25 upstream bins (7-31). * 138‚Äì1104 kHz, 224 downstream bins (32-255). Typically, a few bins around 31-32 are not used in order to prevent interference between upstream and downstream bins either side of 138 kHz. These unused bins constitute a guard band to be chosen by each DSLAM manufacturer - it is not defined by the G.992.1 specification. =Coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (COFDM)= The use of bins produces a transmission system known as coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (COFDM). In the context of G.992.1, the term \\"Discrete Multi- Tone\\" (DMT) is used instead, hence the alternative name of the standard, G.dmt. Using DMT is useful since it allows the communications equipment (user modem/router and exchange/DSLAM) to select only bins which are usable on the line thus effectively obtaining the best overall bit rate from the line at any given moment in time. With COFDM, a combined signal containing many frequencies (for each bin) is transmitted down the line. Fast Fourier Transform (and the inverse iFFT) is used to convert the signal on the line into the individual bins. =Reducing bit errors with QAM and PSK= A type of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) or phase-shift keying (PSK) is used to encode the bits within each bin. This is a complex and mathematical subject and will not be discussed further here. However, much research has been done on these modulation techniques and they are used for transmission because they allow the SNR to be improved, thus lowering the noise floor and enabling more reliable transmission of a signal with fewer errors. The gain obtainable above the noise floor can be anything from 0.5-1.5 dB and these small amounts make a vast difference when sending signals over long distance copper lines of 6 km or more. =Bin quality and bit rate= The quality of the line (how well it performs) at the frequency of the bin in question determines how many bits can be encoded within that bin. As with all transmission lines, it depends on the attenuation and signal-to-noise ratio. SNR may differ for each bin and this plays an important factor for deciding how many bits can be encoded reliably on it. Generally speaking, 1 bit can be encoded reliably for each 3 dB of available dynamic range above the noise floor within a transmission medium so, for example, a bin with an SNR of 18 dB would be able to accommodate 6 bits. =Echo cancellation= Echo cancellation can be used so the downstream channel overlaps the upstream channel, or vice versa, meaning simultaneous upstream and downstream signals are sent. Echo cancellation is optional and is typically not used. DMT bits-per-bin examples Below are examples of how the bin layout may look on various ADSL modems. Both show similar information and in each example there are 256 bins with a varied number of bits being encoded on each one. We can see that at around the frequency range of bin 33, the SNR is 40 dB with the bits per bin being around 6 or 7. =Textual= \\\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bin SNR Gain Bi -

Early life Born into a military family at Medonte Township, Upper Canada (now Ontario), he was the son of Royal Navy Captain Elmes Yelverton Steele, a veteran of the Napoleonic Wars, and one of six brothers to have served in the British Armed Forces. His mother (the second wife of his father), Anne Macdonald, was the youngest daughter of Neil Maclain MacDonald of Ardnamurchan, a native of Islay. Neil MacDonald was a grandson of Captain Godfrey MacNeil of Barra, and a nephew of Colonel Donald MacNeil.A Medonte Pioneer and his Famous Son, Orillia Historical Society Sam Steele was named for his father's uncle, Colonel Samuel Steele, who served in Quebec under Lord Amherst.Ontario Historical Society, Volumes 32-35 Sam Steele received his education at the family home, Purbrook, and then at the Royal Military College of Canada. By the age of 13 he was orphaned, and went to live with his elder half-brother, John Steele. Early military  Following his family's military tradition, in 1866 Steele joined the military during the Fenian raids. Steele also participated in the Red River Expedition in 1870 to fight the Red River Rebellion of Louis Riel. Much to his disappointment, he arrived after the M√©tis had surrendered. The following year he joined the Permanent Force artillery, Canada's first regular army unit. Steele had long been fascinated by the West, devouring the works of James Fenimore Cooper in his youth. He was especially interested in the First Nations, and spent his time in the West learning from them and the M√©tis. However, he was assigned to Fort Henry in Kingston, Ontario, for the next few years, as an instructor at the Artillery School. In 1874, Steele was initiated as a Freemason in the Lisgar Lodge No. 2, in Selkirk, Manitoba.  Life as a Mountie  In 1873, Steele was the third officer sworn into the newly formed North-West Mounted Police (NWMP), entering as a staff constable. He was one of the officers to lead the new recruits of the NWMP on the 1874 March West, when he returned to Fort Garry, present-day Winnipeg, Manitoba. To him fell the rank of staff sergeant major and the responsibility‚Äîas an accomplished horseman and man-at- arms‚Äîof drilling the new recruits. In 1878, Steele was given his own command at Fort Qu'Appelle, North-West Territories. In 1877, he was assigned to meet with Sitting Bull, who, having defeated Lieutenant-Colonel George Custer at the Little Bighorn, had moved with his people into Canada to escape American vengeance. Steele along with U.S. Army General Alfred Howe Terry attempted unsuccessfully to persuade Sitting Bull to return to the United States. (Most of the Sioux did return a few years later.) During the North-West Rebellion Steele was dispatched with a small force. Missing the Battle of Batoche the Mounties were sent to move against the last rebel force led by Big Bear. He was present at the Battle of Frenchman's Butte, where Big Bear's warriors defeated the Canadian forces under General Thomas Bland Strange. Two weeks later, Steele and his two dozen Mounties defeated Big Bear's force at Loon Lake, District of Saskatchewan, in the last battle fought on Canadian territory. The contributions of the NWMP in putting down the rebellion went largely ignored and unrewarded, to Steele's great annoyance. By 1885, Steele held the rank of superintendent. He established an NWMP station in the town of Galbraiths Ferry, which was later named to Fort Steele in British Columbia, after Steele solved a murder in the town. He then moved on to Fort Macleod, District of Alberta, in 1888. In 1889, at Fort Macleod, he met Marie-Elizabeth de Lotbini√®re-Harwood (1859‚Äì1951), daughter of Robert William Harwood. They were married at Vaudreuil, Quebec, in 1890. They had three children, including Harwood Steele, who fictionalized episodes from his father's life in novels such as Spirit-of-Iron (1929). The discovery of gold in the Klondike in the late 1890s presented Steele with a new challenge. Although he campaigned unsuccessfully for the position of assistant commissioner in 1892, in January 1898 he was sent to succeed Charles Constantine as commissioner and to establish customs posts at the head of the White and Chilkoot Passes, and at Lake Bennett. He was noted for his hard line with the hundreds of unruly and independent-minded prospectors, many of them American. To help control the situation, he established the rule that no one would be allowed to enter the Yukon without a ton of goods to support themselves, thus preventing the entry of desperate and potentially unruly speculators and adventurers. Steele and his force made the Klondike Gold Rush one of the most orderly of its kind in history and made the NWMP famous around the world, which ensured its survival at a critical time when the force's dissolution was being debated in Parliament. By July 1898, Steele commanded all the NWMP in the Yukon area, and was a member of the territorial council. As the force reported directly to Ottawa, Steele had almost free rein to run things as he chose, always with an eye towards maintaining law, order and Canadian sovereignty. He moved to Dawson City in September 1898.  Boer War and second military career  Always a soldier, in early 1900 Steele leapt at the offer of Canadian Pacific Railway tycoon Donald Smith, Baron Strathcona, to be the first commanding officer of Smith's privately raised cavalry unit, Strathcona's Horse, with the appointment as lieutenant-colonel from 7 March 1900. This Canadian light cavalry unit, in British Imperial service, was sent to South Africa during the Second Boer War, where Steele commanded them with distinction in the role of reconnaissance scouts. Steele, however, apparently disliked greatly what he was ordered to do by the British, which included burning towns, farms and homesteads, killing livestock of the Boer families and moving the populace to concentration camps. After the war, the regiment arrived in London in February 1901. Here they met Lord Strathcona for the first time and were presented with medals by King Edward VII during a visit to Buckingham Palace. Steele was also appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order (fourth class) (MVO), a personal gift from the King. On its return to Canada the regiment was disbanded, and the officers received honorary promotions. Steele was promoted to honorary lieutenant-colonel in March 1901. After taking the unit back to Canada early in 1901, Steele returned to South Africa that same year to command 'B' Division of the South African Constabulary, a position he held until 1906. On his return to Canada in 1907, Steele assumed command of Military Division No. 13 in Alberta and the District of Mackenzie, and then in 1910 assumed command of Division No. 10 at Winnipeg, where he spent his time regrouping Lord Strathcona's Horse and in preparing his memoirs. Steele requested active military duty upon the outbreak of the First World War. He was initially rejected for command on the grounds of age. However, a compromise was reached which allowed him to act as commander of the 2nd Canadian Division until the formation was sent to France, whereupon he would be replaced. After accompanying the division to England, Steele was offered an administrative post as commanding officer of the South-East District. Matters were complicated, however, when Canadian Minister of Defence Samuel Hughes insisted that Steele also be made commander of all Canadian troops in Europe‚Äîa slight problem, as there were two brigadier-generals who each believed the Canadian command was theirs. The issue was not resolved until 1916, when the new Minister of Overseas Military Forces of Canada, Sir G. H. Perley, removed Steele from his Canadian command after Steele refused to return to Canada as a recruiter. He kept his British command until his retirement on 15 July 1918. While in Britain, Steele was knighted, on 1 January 1918, and was made a Companion of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath, and Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George. Steele died during the 1918 flu pandemic just after his 70th birthday and was later buried in Winnipeg. Canada's fifth-tallest mountain, Mount Steele, is named after him. CFB Edmonton, the home of Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians) is now called Steele Barracks after Major General Steele. Personal papers On 19 June 2008, Steele's wealth of personal papers and writings were repatriated to Canada in a ceremony in Trafalgar Square in London, England, headed by the Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. Steele's papers, believed by historians to contain a wealth of heretofore untold stories that would \\"re-write Canadian history\\" had been held by British descendants of Steele, and were returned to Canada via a purchase by the University of Alberta.Personal papers of famous Mountie shed light on young Canada 19 June 2008 Canada.com References *Pierre Berton, The Wild Frontier, More Tales from the Remarkable Past (Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1978), chapter 3. *Brian Busby, Character Parts: Who's Really Who in CanLit (Toronto: Knopf Canada, 2003), p. 8-9, 54‚Äì55. *R.

Its decentralized trust model is an alternative to the centralized trust model of a public key infrastructure (PKI), which relies exclusively on a certificate authority (or a hierarchy of such). As with computer networks, there are many independent webs of trust, and any user (through their identity certificate) can be a part of, and a link between, multiple webs. The web of trust concept was first put forth by PGP creator Phil Zimmermann in 1992 in the manual for PGP version 2.0: Operation of a web of trust All OpenPGP-compliant implementations include a certificate vetting scheme to assist with this; its operation has been termed a web of trust. OpenPGP identity certificates (which include one or more public keys along with owner information) can be digitally signed by other users who, by that act, endorse the association of that public key with the person or entity listed in the certificate. This is commonly done at key signing parties. OpenPGP-compliant implementations also include a vote counting scheme which can be used to determine which public key ‚Äì owner association a user will trust while using PGP. For instance, if three partially trusted endorsers have vouched for a certificate (and so its included public key ‚Äì owner binding), or if one fully trusted endorser has done so, the association between owner and public key in that certificate will be trusted to be correct. The parameters are user-adjustable (e.g., no partials at all, or perhaps six partials) and can be completely bypassed if desired. The scheme is flexible, unlike most public key infrastructure designs, and leaves trust decisions in the hands of individual users. It is not perfect and requires both caution and intelligent supervision by users. Essentially all PKI designs are less flexible and require users to follow the trust endorsement of the PKI generated, certificate authority (CA)-signed, certificates. =Simplified explanation= There are two keys pertaining to a person: a public key which is shared openly and a private key that is withheld by the owner. The owner's private key will decrypt any information encrypted with its public key. In the web of trust, each user has a ring with a group of people's public keys. Users encrypt their information with the recipient's public key, and only the recipient's private key will decrypt it. Each user then digitally signs the information with their private key, so when the recipient verifies it against the users own public key, they can confirm that it is the user in question. Doing this will ensure that the information came from the specific user and has not been tampered with, and only the intended recipient can read the information (because only they know their private key). Contrast with typical PKI Unlike WOT, a typical X.509 PKI enables each certificate to be signed by a single party: a certificate authority (CA). The CA's certificate may itself be signed by a different CA, all the way up to a 'self-signed' root certificate. Root certificates must be available to those who use a lower-level CA certificate and so are typically distributed widely. They are for instance, distributed with such applications as browsers and email clients. In this way SSL/TLS-protected Web pages, email messages, etc. can be authenticated without requiring users to manually install root certificates. Applications commonly include over one hundred root certificates from dozens of PKIs, thus by default bestowing trust throughout the hierarchy of certificates which lead back to them. WOT favors the decentralization of trust anchors to prevent a single point of failure from compromising the CA hierarchy. A notable project that uses WOT against PKI to provide a framework for authentication in other areas of Internet is Monkeysphere utilities. Problems = Loss of private keys = The OpenPGP web of trust is essentially unaffected by such things as company failures, and has continued to function with little change. However, a related problem does occur: users, whether individuals or organizations, who lose track of a private key can no longer decrypt messages sent to them produced using the matching public key found in an OpenPGP certificate. Early PGP certificates did not include expiry dates, and those certificates had unlimited lives. Users had to prepare a signed cancellation certificate against the time when the matching private key was lost or compromised. One very prominent cryptographer is still getting messages encrypted using a public key for which they long ago lost track of the private key. They can't do much with those messages except discard them after notifying the sender that they were unreadable and requesting resending with a public key for which they still have the matching private key. Later PGP, and all OpenPGP compliant certificates include expiry dates which automatically preclude such troubles (eventually) when used sensibly. This problem can also be easily avoided by the use of \\"designated revokers\\", which were introduced in the early 1990s. A key owner may designate a third party that has permission to revoke the key owner's key (in case the key owner loses their own private key and thus loses the ability to revoke their own public key). = Public key authentity check = A non-technical, social difficulty with a Web of Trust like the one built into PGP/OpenPGP type systems is that every web of trust without a central controller (e.g., a CA) depends on other users for trust. Those with new certificates (i.e., produced in the process of generating a new key pair) will not likely be readily trusted by other users' systems, that is by those they have not personally met, until they find enough endorsements for the new certificate. This is because many other Web of Trust users will have their certificate vetting set to require one or more fully trusted endorsers of an otherwise unknown certificate (or perhaps several partial endorsers) before using the public key in that certificate to prepare messages, believe signatures, etc. Despite the wide use of OpenPGP compliant systems and easy availability of on-line multiple key servers, it is possible in practice to be unable to readily find someone (or several people) to endorse a new certificate (e.g., by comparing physical identification to key owner information and then digitally signing the new certificate). Users in remote areas or undeveloped ones, for instance, may find other users scarce. And, if the other's certificate is also new (and with no or few endorsements from others), then its signature on any new certificate can offer only marginal benefit toward becoming trusted by still other parties' systems and so able to securely exchange messages with them. Key signing parties are a relatively popular mechanism to resolve this problem of finding other users who can install one's certificate in existing webs of trust by endorsing it. Websites also exist to facilitate the location of other OpenPGP users to arrange keysignings. The Gossamer Spider Web of Trust also makes key verification easier by linking OpenPGP users via a hierarchical style web of trust where end users can benefit by coincidental or determined trust of someone who is endorsed as an introducer, or by explicitly trusting GSWoT's top-level key minimally as a level 2 introducer (the top-level key endorses level 1 introducers). The possibility of finding chains of certificates is often justified by the \\"small world phenomenon\\": given two individuals, it is often possible to find a short chain of people between them such that each person in the chain knows the preceding and following links. However, such a chain is not necessarily useful: the person encrypting an email or verifying a signature not only has to find a chain of signatures from their private key to their correspondent's, but also to trust each person of the chain to be honest and competent about signing keys (that is, they have to judge whether these people are likely to honestly follow the guidelines about verifying the identity of people before signing keys). This is a much stronger constraint. Another obstacle is the requirement to physically meet with someone (for example, at a key signing party) to verify their identity and ownership of a public key and email address, which may involve travel expenses and scheduling constraints affecting both sides. A software user may need to verify hundreds of software components produced by thousands of developers located around the world. As the general population of software users cannot meet in person with all software developers to establish direct trust, they must instead rely on the comparatively slower propagation of indirect trust. Obtaining the PGP/GPG key of an author (or developer, publisher, etc.) from a public key server also presents risks, since the key server is a third-party middle-man, itself vulnerable to abuse or attacks. To avoid this risk, an author can instead choose to publish their public key on their own key server (i.e., a web server accessible through a domain name owned by them, and securely located in their private office or home) and require the use of HKPS-encrypted connections for the transmission of their public key. For details, see WOT Assisting Solutions below.  Strong set  The strong set refers to the largest collection of strongly connected PGP keys. This forms the basis for the global web of trust. Any two keys in the strong set have a path between them; while islands of sets of keys that only sign each other in a disconnected group can and do exist, only one member of that group needs to exchange signatures with the strong set for that group to also become a part of the strong set. The strong set had a size of about 55000 Keys at the beginning of the year 2015. Mean shortest distance MSD-based trust explanation In statistical analysis of the PGP/GnuPG/OpenPGP Web of trust the mean shortest distance (MSD) is one measurement of how \\"trusted\\" a given PGP key is within the strongly connected set of PGP keys that make up the Web of trust. MSD has become a common metric for analysis of sets of PGP keys. Very often you will see the MSD being calculated for a given subset of keys and compared with the global MSD which generally refers to the keys ranking within one of the larger key analyses of the global Web of trust. WOT assisting solutions Physically meeting with original developer or author, is always the best way to obtain and distribute and verify and trust PGP/GPG Keys with highest trust level, and will remain as the best level of best trustworthy way. Publishing of GPG/PGP full Key or full Key fingerprint on/with widely known (physical/paper-material based) book, by the original author/developer, is the 2nd best form of sharing trustworthy key with and for users. Before meeting a developer or author, users should research on their own on the developer or author in book library and via internet, and aware of developer's or author's photo, work, pub-key fingerprint, email-address, etc. However, it is not practical for millions of users who want to communicate or message securely to physically meet with each recipient users, and it is also not practical for millions of software users who need to physically meet with hundreds of software developers or authors, whose software or file signing PGP/GPG public Key they want to verify and trust and ultimately use in their computers. Therefore, one or more trusted third-party authority (TTPA) type of entity or group need to be available for users and be usable by users, and such entity/group need to be capable of providing trusted-verification or trust-delegation services for millions of users around the world, at any time. Practically, to verify any downloaded or received content or data or email or file's authenticity, a user need to verify their downloaded main content or main data/email or main file's PGP/GPG signature code/file (ASC, SIG). So users would need to use original developer's or original author's trustworthy and verified public-key, or users would need to use trustworthy file-signing public-key trusted-by the original owner of that public-key. And to really trust a specific PGP/GPG key, users would need to physically meet with very specific original author or developer, or users would need to physically meet with the original-releaser of file- signing pub-key, or, users would need to find another alternative trustworthy user, who is in trusted-chain of WOT (aka, another user or another developer or another author, who is trusted by that very specific original author or developer), and then physically meet with that person, to verify their real ID with his/her PGP/GPG key (and also provide your own ID and key to the other user, so that both side can sign/certify and trust each other's PGP/GPG key). Whether a software is popular or not, software users are usually located around the world in different locations. It is physically not possible for an original author or developer or file-releaser to provide public-key or trust or ID verification services to millions of users. Neither is it practical for millions of software users to physically meet with each and every software or every software-library or every piece of code's developer or author or releaser, which they will (use or) need to use in their computers. Even with multiple trusted people/person (by original-author) in trusted-chain from WOT, its still not physically or practically possible for every developer or author to meet with every other users, and it is also not possible for every users to meet with hundreds of developers whose software they will be using or working on. When this decentralized hierarchy based WoT chain model will become popular and used by most nearby users, only then physical meeting and pub-key certify and sign procedure of WoT will be easier. A few solutions are: original author/developer need to first set a trust-level to sign/certify their own file-signing key. Then updated public-keys and updated file-signing public-keys must also have to be published and distributed (or made accessible) to users, via online secure and encrypted mediums, so that any user from any location in world, can get the correct and trusted and unmodified public-key. To make sure that each users are getting the correct and trusted public-keys and signed-code/file, original dev/author or original- releaser must publish their updated public-keys on their own key server and force HKPS encrypted connection usage, or publish their updated and full public-keys (and signed-code/file) on their own HTTPS encrypted webpage, under their own web server, from their own primary domain website, (not-from any sub-domains which are located in external-servers, not-from any mirror, not- from any external/shared forum/wiki etc website servers, not-from any public or external/shared cloud or hosting service servers), and must have to be located and kept securely inside their own premises: own-home, own-home- office, or own-office. In that way, those small pieces of original keys/code, will travel intact through internet and will remain unmodified during transit (because of encrypted connection) and will reach destination without being eavesdropped or modified, into user's side, and can be treated as trustworthy public-keys because of single or multi channel TTPA based verification. When a public-key is obtained (from original developer's own web-server) via more than one TTPA (trusted third party authority) based secured, verified and encrypted connection, then it is more trustworthy. When original public- keys/signed-codes are shown in original dev's or author's own web server or key server, over encrypted connection or encrypted webpage, then any other files, data or content can be transferred over any type of non-encrypted connection, like: HTTP/FTP etc from any sub-domain server or from any mirror or from any shared cloud/hosting servers, because, non-encrypted connection based downloaded items/data/files can be authenticated later, by using the original public-keys/signed-codes, which were obtained from the original author's/developer's own server over secured, encrypted, and trusted (aka, verified) connection/channels. Using encrypted connection to transfer keys or signed/signature code/files, allow software users to delegate their trust with a PKI TTPA (trusted third party authority), like public CA (Certificate Authority), to help in providing trusted connection in between the original developer/author's web server, and millions of worldwide users' computers, at any time. When the original author/developer's domain-name and name-server is signed by DNSSEC, and when used SSL/TLS public certificate is declared/shown in TLSA/DANE DNSSec DNS resource-record, (and when SSL/TLS Certs in the trust chain are pinned and used via HPKP technique by web servers), then a web- server's webpage or data can also be verified via another PKI TTPA: DNSSEC and DNS namespace maintainer ICANN, other than a public CA. DNSSEC is another form of PGP/GPG WOT but for name-servers; it creates a trusted-chain for name- servers first (instead of people/person), and then people/person's PGP/GPG Keys and fingerprints can also be added into a server's DNSSEC DNS records. So any users who want to communicate securely (or any software users), can effectively get/receive their data/key/code/webpage etc. verified (aka, authenticated) via two (aka, dual/double) trusted PKI TTPAs/Channels at the same time: ICANN (DNSSEC) and CA (SSL/TLS Certificate). So PGP/GPG key/signed- code data (or file) can be trusted, when such solutions and techniques are used: HKPS, HKPS+DNSSEC+DANE, HTTPS, HTTPS+HPKP or HTTPS+HPKP+DNSSEC+DANE. If a vast number of user's group create their own new DLV based DNSSEC registry, and if users use that new DLV (along with ICANN-DNSSEC) root-key in their own local DNSSEC-based DNS Resolver/Server, and if domain-owners also use it for additional signing of their own domain-names, then there can be a new third TTPA. In such case, any PGP/GPG Key/signed-code data or a webpage or web data can be three/triple-channel verified. ISC's DLV itself can be used as a third TTPA as its still used widely and active, so availability of another new DLV will become fourth TTPA.

In cryptography and computer security, a root certificate is a public key certificate that identifies a root certificate authority (CA). Root certificates are self- signed (and it is possible for a certificate to have multiple trust paths, say if the certificate was issued by a root that was cross-signed) and form the basis of an X.509-based public key infrastructure (PKI). Either it has matched Authority Key Identifier with Subject Key Identifier, in some cases there is no Authority Key identifier, then Issuer string should match with Subject string (RFC 5280). For instance, the PKIs supporting HTTPS for secure web browsing and electronic signature schemes depend on a set of root certificates. A certificate authority can issue multiple certificates in the form of a tree structure. A root certificate is the top-most certificate of the tree, the private key of which is used to \\"sign\\" other certificates. All certificates signed by the root certificate, with the \\"CA\\" field set to true, inherit the trustworthiness of the root certificate‚Äîa signature by a root certificate is somewhat analogous to \\"notarizing\\" identity in the physical world. Such a certificate is called an intermediate certificate or subordinate CA certificate. Certificates further down the tree also depend on the trustworthiness of the intermediates. The root certificate is usually made trustworthy by some mechanism other than a certificate, such as by secure physical distribution. For example, some of the best-known root certificates are distributed in operating systems by their manufacturers. Microsoft distributes root certificates belonging to members of the Microsoft Root Certificate Program to Windows desktops and Windows Phone 8. Apple distributes root certificates belonging to members of its own root program.

Revocation states There are two different states of revocation defined in RFC 5280: * Revoked: A certificate is irreversibly revoked if, for example, it is discovered that the certificate authority (CA) had improperly issued a certificate, or if a private-key is thought to have been compromised. Certificates may also be revoked for failure of the identified entity to adhere to policy requirements, such as publication of false documents, misrepresentation of software behaviour, or violation of any other policy specified by the CA operator or its customer. The most common reason for revocation is the user no longer being in sole possession of the private key (e.g., the token containing the private key has been lost or stolen). * Hold: This reversible status can be used to note the temporary invalidity of the certificate (e.g., if the user is unsure if the private key has been lost). If, in this example, the private key was found and nobody had access to it, the status could be reinstated, and the certificate is valid again, thus removing the certificate from future CRLs. Reasons for revocation Reasons to revoke a certificate according to RFC 5280 are: * \`unspecified\` (0) * \`keyCompromise\` (1) * \`cACompromise\` (2) * \`affiliationChanged\` (3) * \`superseded\` (4) * \`cessationOfOperation\` (5) * \`certificateHold\` (6) * \`removeFromCRL\` (8) * \`privilegeWithdrawn\` (9) * \`aACompromise\` (10) Note that value 7 is not used. Publishing revocation lists A CRL is generated and published periodically, often at a defined interval. A CRL can also be published immediately after a certificate has been revoked. A CRL is issued by a CRL issuer, which is typically the CA which also issued the corresponding certificates, but could alternatively be some other trusted authority. All CRLs have a lifetime during which they are valid; this timeframe is often 24 hours or less. During a CRL's validity period, it may be consulted by a PKI- enabled application to verify a certificate prior to use. To prevent spoofing or denial-of-service attacks, CRLs usually carry a digital signature associated with the CA by which they are published. To validate a specific CRL prior to relying on it, the certificate of its corresponding CA is needed. The certificates for which a CRL should be maintained are often X.509/public key certificates, as this format is commonly used by PKI schemes. Revocation versus expiration Expiration dates are not a substitute for a CRL. While all expired certificates are considered invalid, not all unexpired certificates should be valid. CRLs or other certificate validation techniques are a necessary part of any properly operated PKI, as mistakes in certificate vetting and key management are expected to occur in real world operations. In a noteworthy example, a certificate for Microsoft was mistakenly issued to an unknown individual, who had successfully posed as Microsoft to the CA contracted to maintain the ActiveX 'publisher certificate' system (VeriSign). Microsoft saw the need to patch their cryptography subsystem so it would check the status of certificates before trusting them. As a short-term fix, a patch was issued for the relevant Microsoft software (most importantly Windows) specifically listing the two certificates in question as \\"revoked\\". Problems with certificate revocation lists Best practices require that wherever and however certificate status is maintained, it must be checked whenever one wants to rely on a certificate. Failing this, a revoked certificate may be incorrectly accepted as valid. This means that to use a PKI effectively, one must have access to current CRLs. This requirement of on-line validation negates one of the original major advantages of PKI over symmetric cryptography protocols, namely that the certificate is \\"self-authenticating\\". Symmetric systems such as Kerberos also depend on the existence of on-line services (a key distribution center in the case of Kerberos). The existence of a CRL implies the need for someone (or some organization) to enforce policy and revoke certificates deemed counter to operational policy. If a certificate is mistakenly revoked, significant problems can arise. As the certificate authority is tasked with enforcing the operational policy for issuing certificates, they typically are responsible for determining if and when revocation is appropriate by interpreting the operational policy. The necessity of consulting a CRL (or other certificate status service) prior to accepting a certificate raises a potential denial-of-service attack against the PKI. If acceptance of a certificate fails in the absence of an available valid CRL, then no operations depending upon certificate acceptance can take place. This issue exists for Kerberos systems as well, where failure to retrieve a current authentication token will prevent system access. An alternative to using CRLs is the certificate validation protocol known as Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). OCSP has the primary benefit of requiring less network bandwidth, enabling real-time and near real-time status checks for high volume or high-value operations. As of Firefox 28, Mozilla have announced they are deprecating CRL in favour of OCSP. CRL files may grow quite large over time e.g. in US government, for certain institution multiple megabytes. Therefore, incremental CRLs have been designed sometimes referred to as \\"delta CRLs\\". However, only a few clients implement them.  Authority revocation lists  An authority revocation list (ARL) is a form of CRL containing certificates issued to certificate authorities, contrary to CRLs which contain revoked end-entity certificates.

The film is rated PG and is computer-animated with 3D effects. Written by Kurt Frey and directed by co-writer Ben Stassen, the film plays out very much like many modern video games, and can be divided into two types of segments: those in which the audience is seeing through the eyes of the main character, and those in which a scene plays out where the main character is actually in the shot. Plot A young, aspiring American musician and singer named Johnny (played by Jasper Steverlinck, singer of Belgian rock band Arid) has been notified by a British law firm that his mother (voiced by Kyoko Baertsoen, leader of another Belgian band, Lunascape), an aging rock star whom Johnny hasn't seen or heard from since he was 3 years old, has died in a helicopter accident. Johnny has been willed her castle and all of her property and money, but he must visit the actual estate, located in England, to claim these things. As he drives up to the castle, a lightning bolt hits a grave on the castle grounds, and a glowing sphere emerges. As Johnny enters the building, he walks through a hall with several suits of armor. The suits come alive and begin attacking him when suddenly the light sphere appears and destroys them all, then a demonic entity beckons Johnny further into the castle. Johnny stumbles on a room of instruments levitating and playing on themselves, and then walks into a great hall with an orb embedded into the ground that begins projecting the image of Johnny's mother. (This segues into a rather lengthy musical number in which this holographic image (Baertsoen) sings an operatic number while the cameras circle around her. The song is named 'Lane Navachi' from Lunascape's album 'Reflecting Seylence'). Suddenly, a demonic face appears in the fire. It is the devil (voiced by Harry Shearer, and referred to as \\"Mr. D\\"), who explains to Johnny that his mother sold her soul for her fame. Part of the agreement was that the devil could \\"not touch\\" Johnny, but now that she has died, Mr. D offers Johnny a similar agreement. Johnny declines, but is enticed to explore the castle further. He enters a cathedral-like room, whose floor begins to descend. Soon, Johnny is in Hell proper. At this point, the film begins to take a very dark and gothic turn, as Johnny's tour guide, Mephisto (Mr. D's chief lieutenant, also voiced by Shearer), guides him through the sections of Hell, where musicians, who have sold their souls, are violently tortured. Mephisto reveals that there was a time when luring people to Hell with fame in music was unsuccessful - until the invention of Rock and Roll. Johnny is taken on a roller coaster ride through Hell, but as he proceeds, the glowing sphere - revealed to be the spirit of his mother - appears before him time and time again, warning him of the danger awaiting him should he give in to the Devil's offer. Eventually, Johnny is sidetracked into a decrepit opera hall, where the worst of tortures are taking place. Mephisto reveals to Johnny that Mr. D once had a romance with an opera singer, who broke his heart, and now Mr. D has a particularly violent aversion for opera music. Johnny eventually ends up back in front of Mr. D, who once again entices him to sign. Mephisto gives Johnny a guitar, and he considers the offer, then throws the guitar into the flames, and begins to sing La Donna √® Mobile at the top of his lungs, sending the Devil into a frenzied tantrum which collapses the entire castle. As this occurs, the soul of Johnny's mother returns to its resting place once more. The film jumps ahead six months later, and we see that Johnny is now a famous rock and roll star through his own talent. The last five minutes of the film features a performance by Arid, as the credits float by them in little bubbles burst by a floating demon.

He was President of Mexico from 1 December 1994 to 30 November 2000, as the last of the uninterrupted 71-year line of Mexican presidents from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). During his presidency, he faced one of the worst economic crises in Mexico's history, which started only weeks after he took office. He distanced himself from his predecessor Carlos Salinas de Gortari, blaming his policies for the crisis (although President Zedillo himself did not deviate from the neoliberal policies of his two predecessors), and oversaw the arrest of his brother Ra√∫l Salinas de Gortari.Salinas' Brother Charged in Mexican Assassination New York Times 1 March 1995 His administration was also marked, among other things, by renewed clashes with the EZLN and the Popular Revolutionary Army; the controversial implementation of Fobaproa to rescue the national banking system;Sol√≠s, L. (comp.) (1999). Fobaproa y las recientes reformas financieras. M√©xico: Instituto de Investigaci√≥n Econ√≥mica y Social \\"Lucas Alam√°n\\", A.C. a political reform which allowed residents of the Federal District (Mexico City) to elect their own mayor; and the Aguas Blancas and Acteal massacres perpetrated by State forces. Although Zedillo's policies allowed Mexico to get out of the economic crisis and regain growth, popular discontent with seven decades of PRI rule led to the party losing, for the first time, its legislative majority in the 1997 elections,Nohlen, D (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I, p453 and in the 2000 elections the right-wing opposition National Action Party's candidate Vicente Fox won the Presidency of the Republic, putting an end to 71 years of uninterrupted PRI rule.Nohlen, D (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I, p475 Zedillo's admission of the PRI's defeat and his peaceful handing of power to his successor improved his image in the final months of his administration, and he left office with an approval rating of 60%. Since the ending of his term as president in 2000, Zedillo has been a leading voice on globalization, especially its impact on relations between developed and developing nations. He is currently Director of the Center for the Study of Globalization at Yale University and is on the board of directors at the Inter-American Dialogue and Citigroup. Early life and education Ernesto Zedillo was born on 27 December 1951 in Mexico City. His parents were Rodolfo Zedillo Castillo, a mechanic, and Martha Alicia Ponce de Le√≥n. Seeking better job and education opportunities for their children, his parents moved to Mexicali, Baja California. In 1965, at the age of 14, he returned to Mexico City. In 1969 he entered the National Polytechnic Institute, financing his studies by working in the National Army and Navy Bank (later known as Banj√©rcito). He graduated as an economist in 1972 and began lecturing. It was among his first group of students that he met his wife, Nilda Patricia Velasco, with whom he has five children: Ernesto, Emiliano, Carlos (formerly married to conductor Alondra de la Parra), Nilda Patricia and Rodrigo. In 1974, he pursued his master's and PhD studies at Yale University. His doctoral thesis was titled Mexico's Public External Debt: Recent History and Future Growth Related to Oil. =Political career= Zedillo began working in the Bank of Mexico (Mexico's central bank) as a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, where he supported the adoption of macroeconomic policies for the country's improvement. By 1987, he was named deputy-secretary of Planning and Budget Control in the Secretariat of Budget and Planning. In 1988, at the age of 36, he headed that secretariat. During his term as Secretary, Zedillo launched a Science and Technology reform. In 1992, he was appointed Secretary of Education by president Carlos Salinas. During his tenure in this post, he was in charge of the revision the Mexican public school textbooks. The changes, which took a softer line on foreign investment and the Porfiriato, among other topics, were highly controversial and the textbooks were withdrawn.Gilbert, Dennis. \\"Rewriting History: Salinas, Zedillo and the 1992 Textbook Controversy\\". Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos, vol. 13, no. 2, 1997, pp. 271‚Äì297. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1052017 accessed 23 March 2019 A year later he resigned to run the electoral campaign of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI's presidential candidate. 1994 presidential campaign Vladimir Putin and Ernesto Zedillo, at the Millennium Summit, 2000 In 1994, after Colosio's assassination, Zedillo became one of the few PRI members eligible under Mexican law to take his place, since he had not occupied public office for some time. The opposition blamed Colosio's murder on Salinas. Although the PRI's presidential candidates were always chosen by the current president, and thus Colosio had originally been Salinas' candidate, their political relationship had been affected by a famous speech during the campaign in which Colosio said that Mexico had many problems. It is also notable that the assassination took place after Colosio visited the members of the Zapatista movement in Chiapas and promised to open dialogue, something the PRI opposed. After Colosio's murder, this speech was seen as the main cause of his break with the president. The choice of Zedillo was interpreted as Salinas' way of bypassing the strong Mexican political tradition of non-reelection and retaining real power, since Zedillo was not really a politician, but an economist (like Salinas), who clearly lacked the president's political talent and influence. It is unclear if Salinas had attempted to control Colosio, who was generally considered at that time to be a far better candidate. Zedillo ran against Diego Fern√°ndez de Cevallos of the National Action Party and second-timer Cuauht√©moc C√°rdenas of the Party of the Democratic Revolution. He won with 48.69% of popular vote, and became the last president to distinguish the 70-year PRI dynasty in M√©xico during the 20th century. Presidency (1994‚Äì2000) Zedillo at the World Economic Forum 2009 Ernesto Zedillo with Edmund Phelps, winner of the 2006 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, at the World Economic Forum's Summit on the Global Agenda 2008 At age 43, Zedillo assumed the presidency on 1 December 1994 at the Legislative Palace of San L√°zaro, taking oath before the Congress of the Union presided by the deputy president Carlota Vargas Garza. Zedillo's electoral victory was perceived as clean, but he came to office as an accidental candidate with no political base of his own and no experience. During the first part of his presidency, he took inconsistent policy positions and there were rumors that he would resign or that there would be a coup d'√©tat against him, which caused turmoil in financial markets.Thomas Legler, \\"Ernesto Zedillo\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico. Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p.1641 =Cabinet= Zedillo's cabinet needed to have members who could deal with crises. Over the course of his presidency, he had four as Minister of the Interior, Esteban Moctezuma, who dealt with the Zapatistas; Emilio Chuayffet, who resigned following the Acteal massacre; Francisco Labastida, who won the primary to determine the 2000 PRI presidential candidate; and Di√≥doro Carrasco Altamirano, who dealt with the strike at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. =Financial Crisis of December 1994= A few days after taking office, one of the biggest economic crises in Mexican history hit the country. Although it was outgoing President Salinas who was mainly blamed for the crisis, Salinas claimed that President Zedillo made a mistake by changing the economic policies held by his administration. Zedillo devalued the peso by 15%, which prompted the near-collapse of the financial system.Legler, \\"Ernesto Zedillo\\", p. 1641. The crisis ended after a series of reforms and actions led by Zedillo. US president Bill Clinton granted a US$20 billion loan to Mexico, which helped in one of Zedillo's initiatives to rescue the banking system. =Break with Salinas= Zedillo had been an accidental presidential candidate who was vaulted to prominence with the assassination of Colosio. The conflict between Zedillo and Salinas marked the early part of Zedillo's presidency.Fuentes, Carlos. \\"Coalticue's Skirt: Hidden Aspects of Mexico's Political Rivalry in 1995\\". The Brown Journal of World Affairs, vol. 2, no. 2, 1995, pp. 175‚Äì180. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/24590093 accessed 23 March 2019 As with De la Madrid and Salinas, Zedillo had never been elected to office and had no experience in politics. His performance as a candidate was lackluster, but the outbreak of violence in Chiapas and the shock of the Colosio assassination swayed voters to support the PRI candidate in the 1994 election. In office, Zedillo was perceived as a puppet-president with Salinas following the model of Plutarco El√≠as Calles in the wake of the 1928 assassination of president-elect Alvaro Obreg√≥n. In order to consolidate his own power in the presidency, Zedillo had to assert his independence from Salinas. On 28 February 1995 Zedillo ordered the arrest of the ex-president's older brother Ra√∫l Salinas for the September 1994 murder of PRI General Secretary Jos√© Francisco Ruiz Massieu. This action marked a decisive break between Zedillo and Salinas. =Zapatista Crisis= Mexico had been in turmoil since January 1994, with the initial Zapatista rebellion and two political assassinations. The presidential candidate Colosio of the PRI was assassinated in March 1994, and his campaign manager Ernesto Zedillo then became the candidate a few days later. The other high-profile assassination, that of PRI Secretary General Jos√© Francisco Ruiz Massieu, brother-in-law of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in September 1994, laid bare political rivalries within the PRI. In order to give credibility to the investigations of those political crimes and grant \\"a healthy distance\\", president Zedillo appointed Antonio Lozano Gracia a member of the opposition Political Party PAN as Attorney General of Mexico. Zedillo inherited the rebellion in Chiapas, but it was up to his administration to handle it. On 5 January 1995, the Secretary of Interior Esteban Moctezuma started a secret meeting process with Marcos called \\"Steps Toward Peace\\" Chiapas. Talks seemed promising for an agreement, but Zedillo backed away, apparently because the military was not in accord with the government's apparent \\"acceptance of the Zapatistas' control over much of Chiapas territory.\\"Oppenheimer, Bordering on Chaos, p. 242. In February 1995, the Mexican government identified the masked Subcomandante Marcos as Rafael Sebasti√°n Guill√©n, a former professor at the Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana in Mexico City. Metaphorically unmasking Marcos and identifying him as a non-indigenous urban intellectual turned-terrorist of was the government's attempt to demystify and delegitimize the Zapatistas in public opinion. The army was prepared to move against Zapatista strongholds and capture Marcos.Oppenheimer, Bordering on Chaos, pp. 244-45 The government decided to reopen negotiations with the Zapatistas. On 10 March 1995 President Zedillo and Secretary of the Interior Moctezuma signed the Presidential Decree for the Dialog, the Reconciliation and a peace with dignity in Chiapas law, which was discussed and approved by the Mexican Congress. In April 1995, the government and the Zapatistas began secret talks to find an end to the conflict. In February 1996, the San Andr√©s Accords were signed by the government and the Zapatistas.https://web.archive.org/web/20070206140008/http://www.globalexchange.org/countries/americas/mexico/SanAndres.html accessed 23 March 2019 In May 1996, Zapatistas imprisoned for terrorism were released. In December 1997, indigenous peasants were murdered in an incident known as the Acteal massacre.https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/25/opinion/death- in-chiapas.html accessed 23 March 2019 Survivors of the massacre sued Zedillo in U.S., but the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the suit on the basis of his immunity as a head of state.https://web.archive.org/web/20141015142416/http://www.indianz.com/News/2014/015292.asp accessed 23 March 2019 =Church-state relations= Oscar Vega and the President Ernesto Zedillo in 1998. Salinas had gained support of the Roman Catholic Church in the 1988 elections and had pushed through a series of constitutional changes that significantly changed church-state relations. However, on 11 February 1995, Zedillo ignited a crisis with the Roman Catholic Church, hurting, recently restored Mexico‚ÄìHoly See diplomatic relations. Relations had already been damaged because of the 24 May 1993 political assassination of the Guadalajara Cardinal Juan Jes√∫s Posadas Ocampo and lack of government progress on solving the murder by the Attorney General of Mexico. PGR pressured the bishop of Chiapas, Samuel Ruiz Garc√≠a for supposedly concealing the Zapatistas guerrilla activity. Ruiz's involvement had been strategic and an important instrument to keep the peace after the EZLN uprising. =Poverty alleviation= Zedillo's presidential motto was Bienestar para tu familia (\\"Well-being for your family\\"). He created the poverty alleviation program Progresa, which subsidized the poorest families in Mexico, provided that their children went to school. It replaced the Salinas administration's PRONASOL, deemed too politicized.Rocha Menocal, A. (2001). \\"Do Old Habits Die Hard? A Statistical Exploration of the Politicisation of Progresa, Mexico's Latest Federal Poverty-Alleviation Programme, under the Zedillo Administration.\\" Journal of Latin American Studies, 33(3), 513-538. doi:10.1017/S0022216X01006113 accessed 23 March 2019 It was later renamed Oportunidades (Opportunities) by president Vicente Fox. The parastatal organization CONASUPO, which was designed to supply food and provide food security to the poor was phased out in 1999, resulting in higher food prices.Yunez‚ÄìNaude, Antonio. \\"The dismantling of CONASUPO, a Mexican state trader in agriculture.\\" World Economy 26.1 (2003): 97‚Äì122. =NAFTA and other economic measures= Carlos Salinas had negotiated Mexico's place in NAFTA, which took effect in January 1994, so Zedillo was the first president to oversee it for his entire term. The Mexican economy suffered following the December 1994 peso crisis, when currency was devalued by 15% and the U.S. intervened to prop up the economy with a multi-billion dollar loan, so that NAFTA under the Zedillo administration got off to a rocky start. The Mexican GDP was -7% and there were hopes that NAFTA would lift that miserable performance statistic.Luz Mar√≠a de la Mora, \\"North American Free Trade Agreement\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1026. In the run-up to implementation of NAFTA, Salinas had privatized hundreds of companies. During the Zedillo administration, he privatized the state railway company, Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M√©xico. This led to the suspension of passenger service in 1997. =Electoral reform= Zedillo saw electoral reform as a key issue for his administration.Zedillo, Ernesto. \\"The Right Track: Political and Economic Reform in Mexico\\". Harvard International Review, vol. 19, no. 1, 1996, pp. 38‚Äì67. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/42762264 accessed 23 March 2019 In January 1995, Zedillo initiated multiparty talks about electoral reform, which resulted in an agreement on how to frame political reform. In July 1996, those talks resulted in the agreement of Mexico's four major parties on a reform package, which was ratified unanimously in legislature. It created autonomous organizations to oversee elections, made the post of Head of Government of Mexico City, previously an appointed position, into an elective one, as of July 1997, and created closer oversight of campaign spending. \\"Perhaps most crucially, it represents a first step toward consensus among the parties on a set of mutually accepted democratic rules of the game.\\"Thomas Legler, \\"Ernesto Zedillo\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico, Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 1641-42. The reforms lowered the influence of the PRI and opened opportunities for other parties.Bruhn, Kathleen. \\"The resurrection of the Mexican left in the 1997 elections: implications for the party system.\\" Toward Mexico‚Äôs Democratizations: Parties, Campaigns, Elections, and Public Opinion, New York, Routledge (1999). In the 1997 elections, for the first time the PRI did not win the majority in Congress. Zedillo was also a strong advocate of federalism as a counterbalance to a centralized system.Ernesto Zedillo Ponce De Le√≥n. \\"Address by Ernesto Zedillo Ponce De Le√≥n\\".

The PRI presidential candidate, Francisco Labastida was not designated by the sitting president (as all former presidential nominees from the PRI had been until that point), but by an open internal primary of the party.Bruhn, Kathleen. \\"The making of the Mexican president, 2000: parties, candidates, and campaign strategy.\\" Jorge Dom√≠nguez and Lawson (2004): 123‚Äì56. Changes in the electoral rules meant that the government did not control voting as it had previously in the Ministry of the Interior. Elections were now the jurisdiction of the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE), with Mexicans having faith that elections would be free and fair.Wallis, Darren. \\"The Mexican Presidential and Congressional Elections of 2000 and Democratic Transition.\\" Bulletin of Latin American Research 20.3 (2001): 304‚Äì323. IFE implemented new procedures regarding campaigns and balloting, with rules for finance, guarantee of the secret ballot, and unbiased counting of votes. Also important were some 10,000 Mexican poll watchers and over 850 foreign observers, including ex-president of the U.S., Jimmy Carter.

Zedillo went on national television when the polls closed, declaring that Vicente Fox had won. In Fox's autobiography he writes, \\"There are still those old-guard priistas who consider Ernesto Zedillo a traitor to his class for his actions on the night of 2 July 2000, as the party boss who betrayed the machine. But in that moment President Zedillo became a true democrat ... In minutes he preempted any possibility of violent resistance from hard-line priistas. It was an act of electoral integrity that will forever mark the mild-mannered economist as a historic figure of Mexico's peaceful transition to democracy.\\"Vicente Fox and Rob Allyn, Revolution of Hope: The Life, Faith, and Dreams of a Mexican President.

Since leaving office, Zedillo has held many jobs as an economic consultant in many international companies and organizations. He currently is on the faculty at Yale University, where he teaches economics and heads the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization. In 2008, a conference on global climate change was convened at Yale, resulting in a published volume edited by Zedillo.Ernesto Zedillo, ed., Global Warming. Looking Beyond Kyoto.

Since 2020, he has been serving as a member of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPR), an independent group examining how the WHO and countries handled the COVID-19 pandemic, co-chaired by Helen Clark and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.Stephanie Nebehay and Kate Kelland (September 3, 2020), Pandemic review panel named, includes Miliband, ex Mexican president Reuters. In 2016, Zedillo co-signed a letter calling for an end to the War on Drugs, along with people like Mary J. Blige, Jesse Jackson and George Soros. =Lawsuit in the U.S. by Indigenous Mexican Plaintiffs= According to a 2012 Economist article, a group of ten anonymous Tzotzil people claiming to be survivors of the Acteal massacre have taken an opportunity to sue former President Zedillo in a civil court in Connecticut, \\"seeking about $50 million and a declaration of guilt against Mr Zedillo.\\" The victims of the massacre were members of an indigenous-rights group known as Las Abejas; however, the current president of that organization, Porfirio Arias, claims that the alleged victims were in fact not residents of Acteal at all. This has led commentators to allege the trial to be politically motivated, perhaps by a member of his own political party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, angry about Zedillo's reforms that led to the party losing power in the 2000 Mexican presidential election, after 71 years of continuous political rule. The United States Department of State recommended that President Zedillo be granted immunity from prosecution due to the actions occurring as part of his official capacity as head of state. This motion is not binding in the US court system, but judges \\"generally side with the State Department.\\" The plaintiffs, who are being represented by Rafferty, Kobert, Tenenholtz, Bounds & Hess may appeal the ruling of U.S. District Judge Michael Shea to sidestep the immunity Zedillo has been granted. In 2014, the US Supreme Court refused to hear a case against Zedillo on grounds of \\"sovereign immunity\\" as a former head of state by survivors of the Acteal massacre. Public opinion and legacy In a national survey conducted in 2012 by BGC-Exc√©lsior regarding former Presidents, 39% of the respondents considered that the Zedillo administration was \\"very good\\" or \\"good\\", 27% responded that it was an \\"average\\" administration, and 31% responded that it was a \\"very bad\\" or \\"bad\\" administration.

It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 6487. Lyrics and melody As with most products of oral tradition, there are many variations to the rhyme. The most common modern version is: :Little Bo-Peep has lost her sheep, :and doesn't know where to find them; :leave them alone, And they'll come home, :wagging (bringing) their tails behind them.I. Opie and P. Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 93-4. 19th century educational game Little Bo-Peep, by Walter Crane, c. 1885 Common variations on second-line include \\"And can't tell where to find them.\\" The fourth line is frequently given as \\"Bringing their tails behind them\\", or sometimes \\"Dragging their tails behind them\\". This alternative version is useful in the extended version, usually of four further stanzas. The melody commonly associated with the rhyme was first recorded in 1870 by the composer and nursery rhyme collector James William Elliott in his National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs.J. J. Fuld, The Book of World-Famous Music: Classical, Popular, and Folk (Courier Dover Publications, 5th edn., 2000), , p. 502. Additional verses William Wallace Denslow's illustrations for the rhyme, 1902 The following additional verses are often added to the rhyme: :Little Bo-Peep fell fast asleep, :and dreamt she heard them bleating; :but when she awoke, she found it a joke, :for they were still a-fleeting. :Then up she took her little crook, :determined for to find them; :she found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed, :for they'd left their tails behind them. :It happened one day, as Bo-Peep did stray :into a meadow hard by, :there she espied their tails side by side, :all hung on a tree to dry. :She heaved a sigh and wiped her eye, :and over the hillocks went rambling, :and tried what she could, as a shepherdess should, :to tack each again to its lambkin. Origins and history The earliest record of this rhyme is in a manuscript of around 1805, which contains only the first verse which references the adult Bo Peep , called 'Little' because she was short and not because she was underage. There are references to a children's game called \\"bo-peep\\", from the 16th century, including one in Shakespeare's King Lear (Act I Scene iv), for which \\"bo-peep\\" is thought to refer to the children's game of peek-a-boo, but there's no evidence that the rhyme existed earlier than the 18th century. The additional verses are first recorded in the earliest printed version in a version of Gammer Gurton's Garland or The Nursery Parnassus in 1810. The phrase \\"to play bo peep\\" was in use from the 14th century to refer to the punishment of being stood in a pillory. For example, in 1364, an ale-wife, Alice Causton, was convicted of giving short measure, for which crime she had to \\"play bo pepe thorowe a pillery\\". Andrew Boorde uses the same phrase in 1542, \\"\\". Nevertheless, connections with sheep are early; a fifteenth-century ballad includes the lines: \\" // In every corner they play boe-pepe\\".

Actual length is about 3cm. A balun (portmanteau of \\"balanced to unbalanced\\") is an electrical device that converts between a balanced signal and an unbalanced signal. A balun can take many forms and may include devices that also transform impedances but need not do so. Transformer baluns can also be used to connect lines of differing impedance. Sometimes, in the case of transformer baluns, they use magnetic coupling but need not do so. Common-mode chokes are also used as baluns and work by eliminating, rather than ignoring, common mode signals.  Types of balun  = Classical transformer type = Isolation transformer In classical transformers, there are two electrically separate windings of wire coils around the transformer's core. The advantage of transformer-type over other types of balun is that the electrically separate windings for input and output allow these baluns to connect circuits whose ground-level voltages are subject to ground loops or are otherwise electrically incompatible; for that reason they are often called isolation transformers. This type is sometimes called a voltage balun. The primary winding receives the input signal, and the secondary winding puts out the converted signal. The core that they are wound on may either be empty (air core) or, equivalently, a magnetically neutral material like a porcelain support, or it may be a material which is good magnetic conductor like ferrite in modern high-frequency (HF) baluns, or soft iron as in the early days of telegraphy. The electrical signal in the primary coil is converted into a magnetic field in the transformer's core. When the electrical current through the primary reverses, it causes the established magnetic field to collapse. The collapsing magnetic field then induces an electric field in the secondary winding. The ratio of loops in each winding and the efficiency of the coils' magnetic coupling determines the ratio of electrical potential (voltage) to electrical current and the total power of the output. For idealized transformers, although the ratio of voltage to current will change in exact proportion to the square of the winding ratio, the power (measured in watts) remains identical. In real transformers, some energy is lost inside to heating of the metallic core of the transformer, and lost outside to the surrounding environment because of imperfect magnetic coupling between the two coils. = Autotransformer type = Circuit diagram of a 4:1 autotransformer balun using three taps on a single winding on a ferrite rod. Generally a balun consists of two wires (primary and secondary) and a toroid core: the current in the primary wire generates a magnetic field in the core, which in turn induces an electric field in the secondary wire. An autotransformer balun has only one coil, or is made of two or more coils that have an electrical connection. The coil is typically wound on a ferrite rod or doughnut-shaped toroid. One can also make an autotransformer from an ordinary transformer by cross-wiring the primary and secondary windings. Baluns made with autotransformer windings are also called voltage baluns, since they produce balanced output voltage, but not necessarily balanced current. Picture a 4:1 balun of the same design, wound on ferrite toroid. Notice that the black and red winding wires are joined at the threaded connector. In all autotransformers, the single winding must have at least one extra electrical connection ‚Äì called a tap or tap point ‚Äì between the two ends of the winding. The current sent into the balun through one pair of connections acts as if it were a primary coil, and magnetizes the entire core. When the electric current in the input segment of the coil changes, the induced magnetic field collapses and the collapse of the magnetic field in the core induces an electric current in the entire coil. Electrical connections to parts of the coil different from the input connections have higher or lower voltages depending on the length of the coil that the output is tapped from. As with a two-winding transformer balun, the ratio of voltage to current changes in proportion to the square of number of windings between the two input wires divided by the number of windings between the two output wires. Unlike transformer-type baluns, an autotransformer balun provides a path for DC current to ground from every terminal. Since outdoor antennas are prone build-up of static electric charge, the path for the static to drain to ground through an autotransformer balun can be a distinct advantage. = Transmission-line transformer type = Transmission line or choke baluns can be considered as simple forms of transmission line transformers. This type is sometimes called a current balun, since it ensures equal current on both sides of its output, but not necessarily equal voltage. These are normally called ununs, because they go from unbalanced to unbalanced or un-un. Baluns are balanced to unbalanced or bal-un. toroidal core and coaxial cable. This simple RF choke works as a balun by preventing signals passing along the outside of the braid. Such a device can be used to cure television interference by acting as a braid-breaker. A more subtle type results when the transformer type (magnetic coupling) is combined with the transmission line type (electro- magnetic coupling). Most typically the same kind of transmission line wires are used for the windings as carry the signal from the radio to the antenna, although these baluns can be made using any type of wire. The resulting devices have very wideband operation.Sevick 1990, pp. 1-1 Transmission line transformers commonly use small ferrite cores in toroidal rings or two-hole, binocular, shapes. Something as simple as 10 turns of coaxial cable coiled up on a diameter about the size of a dinner plate makes an effective choke balun for frequencies from about 10 MHz to beyond 30 MHz. The magnetic material may be air, but it is a transmission line transformer. The Guanella transmission line transformer (Guanella 1944) is often combined with a balun to act as an impedance matching transformer. Putting balancing aside a 1:4 transformer of this type consists of a 75 Œ© transmission line divided in parallel into two 150 Œ© cables, which are then combined in series for 300 Œ©. It is implemented as a specific wiring around the ferrite core of the balun. = Delay-line type = A large class of baluns uses connected transmission lines of specific lengths, with no obvious \\"transformer\\" part. These are usually built for (narrow) frequency ranges where the lengths involved are some multiple of a quarter wavelength of the intended frequency in the transmission line medium. A common application is in making a coaxial connection to a balanced antenna, and designs include many types involving coaxial loops and variously connected \\"stubs\\". One easy way to make a balun is a one-half wavelength (Œª/2) length of coaxial cable. The inner core of the cable is linked at each end to one of the balanced connections for a feeder or dipole. One of these terminals should be connected to the inner core of the coaxial feeder. All three braids should be connected. This then forms a 4:1 balun which works at only one frequency. Another narrow band design is to use a Œª/4 length of metal pipe. The coaxial cable is placed inside the pipe; at one end the braid is wired to the pipe while at the other end no connection is made to the pipe. The balanced end of this balun is at the end where no connection is made to the pipe. The Œª/4 conductor acts as a transformer, converting the zero impedance at the short to the braid into an infinite impedance at the open end. This infinite impedance at the open end of the pipe prevents current flowing into the outer coax formed by the outside of the inner coax shield and the pipe, forcing the current to remain in the inside coax. This balun design is not good for low frequencies because of the long length of pipe that will be needed. An easy way to make such a balun is to paint the outside of the coax with conductive paint, then to connect this paint to the braid through a break in the outer insulation 1/4 wave from the end. For both forms (pipe or paint), the length is dependent on the velocity factor for the outer transmission line. Self- resonance Although baluns are designed as magnetic devices ‚Äì each winding in a balun is an inductor ‚Äì all transformers made of real materials also have a small capacitance between the primary and secondary windings, as well as between individual loops in any single winding, forming unwanted self- capacitance. The electrical connection of capacitance and inductance leads to a frequency where the electrical reactance of the self-inductance and self- capacitance in the balun are equal and opposite: resonance. A balun of any design operates poorly at frequencies at or above its resonance, and some of the design considerations for baluns are for the purpose of making the resonant frequency as far above the operating frequency as possible.  Balun alternatives  An RF choke can be used in place of a balun. If a coil is made using coaxial cable near to the feed point of a balanced antenna, then the RF current that flows on the outer surface of the coaxial cable can be attenuated. One way of doing this would be to pass the cable through a ferrite toroid. The end result is exactly the same as a 1:1 current balun (or Guanella-type balun). (Straw 2005, 2526)  Applications  A balun's function is generally to achieve compatibility between systems, and as such, finds extensive application in modern communications, particularly in realising frequency conversion mixers to make cellular phone and data transmission networks possible. They are also used to convert an E1 carrier signal from coaxial cable (BNC connector, 1.0/2.3 connector, 1.6/5.6 connector, Type 43 connectors) to UTP CAT-5 cable or IDC connector. = Radio and television = Œ© balun built into the antenna plug. In television, amateur radio, and other antenna installations and connections, baluns convert between impedances and symmetry of feedlines and antennas.Baluns: What They Do And How They Do It (W7EL) http://www.eznec.com/Amateur/Articles/Baluns.pdf For example, transformation of 300-Œ© twin-lead or 450-Œ© ladder line (balanced) to 75-Œ© coaxial cable (unbalanced), or to directly connect a balanced antenna to unbalanced coaxial cable. To avoid feed line radiation, baluns are typically used as a form of common mode choke attached at the antenna feed point to prevent the coaxial cable from acting as an antenna and radiating power. This typically is needed when a balanced antenna (for instance, a dipole) is fed with coax; without a balun, the shield of the coax could couple with one side of the dipole, inducing common mode current, and becoming part of the antenna and unintentionally radiating.Feeding a Dipole Antenna with a Balun When it comes to transmitting antennas the choice of the toroid core is crucial. A rule of thumb is: the more power the bigger the core.Toroid Cores for 1:4 Baluns (DG3OBK) In measuring the impedance or radiation pattern of a balanced antenna using a coaxial cable, it is important to place a balun between the cable and the antenna feed. Unbalanced currents that may otherwise flow on the cable will make the measured antenna impedance sensitive to the configuration of the feed cable, and the radiation pattern of small antennas may be distorted by radiation from the cable. Baluns are present in radars, transmitters, satellites, in every telephone network, and probably in most wireless network modem/routers used in homes. It can be combined with transimpedance amplifiers to compose high-voltage amplifiers out of low- voltage components. =Video= Baseband video uses frequencies up to several megahertz. A balun can be used to couple video signals to twisted-pair cables instead of using coaxial cable. Many security cameras now have both a balanced unshielded twisted pair (UTP) output and an unbalanced coaxial one via an internal balun. A balun is also used on the video recorder end to convert back from the 100 Œ© balanced to 75 Œ© unbalanced. A balun of this type has a BNC connector with two screw terminals. VGA/DVI baluns are baluns with electronic circuitry used to connect VGA/DVI sources (laptop, DVD, etc.) to VGA/DVI display devices over long runs of CAT-5/CAT-6 cable. Runs over 130 m (400 ft) may lose quality because of attenuation and variations in the arrival time of each signal. A skew control and special low skew or skew free cable is used for runs over 130 m (400 ft). = Audio = Three audio transformers; two of them baluns. In audio applications, baluns convert between high-impedance unbalanced and low impedance balanced lines. Another application is decoupling of devices (avoidance of earth loops). A third application of baluns in audio systems is in the provision of balanced mains power to the equipment. The common-mode rejection of interference characteristic of balanced mains power, eliminates a wide range of noise coming from the wall plug, e.g. mains-borne interference from air conditioner/furnace/refrigerator motors, switching noise produced by fluorescent lighting and dimmer switches, digital noise from personal computers, and radio frequency signals picked up by the power lines/cords acting as antennae. This noise infiltrates the audio/video system through the power supplies and raises the noise floor of the entire system.Balanced Power Technologies http://www.b-p-t.com/ Except for the connections, the three devices in the image are electrically identical, but only the leftmost two can be used as baluns. The device on the left would normally be used to connect a high impedance source, such as a guitar, into a balanced microphone input, serving as a passive DI unit. The one in the centre is for connecting a low impedance balanced source, such as a microphone, into a guitar amplifier. The one at the right is not a balun, as it provides only impedance matching. =Other applications= * In power line communications, baluns are used in coupling signals onto a power line. * In electronic communications, baluns convert Twinax cables to Cat 5 cables, and back.

The game is the first in its franchise, and the rights are held by Wargaming. The player leads one of ten races to dominate the galaxy through a combination of diplomacy and conquest while developing technology, exploring and colonizing star systems. Gameplay Master of Orion is a turn-based game. In the first iteration of the franchise, one can only play against the AI (the computer). Human and AI players control the management of colonies, technology development, ship construction, inter-species diplomacy, and combat.MOO Manual (PC) p. iii The software generates a map randomly at the start of each game; the player can only choose the size of the galaxy, and the number and difficulty of AI opponents.MOO Manual (PC) p. 2 In the first game, star systems have at most one colonizable planet and a few have none. Later games have more planets.MOO Manual (PC) p. 4 Master of Orion has 10 playable races, each with a specialty. For instance, the Humans have advantages in trade and diplomacy; the Bulrathi are the best at ground combat; the Silicoids ignore pollution and can colonize even the most hostile planets, but have slow population growth.MOO Manual (PC) pp. 39-41 Each race is predisposed to like or dislike some of the other races, and is advantaged or disadvantaged in different research fields. The game begins with a single homeworld, one colony ship, and two scout ships that can be used to explore nearby stars. The game will sometimes produce random events which can be harmful or advantageous. One planet is Orion, \\"throne-world of the Ancients\\" and most valuable research site in the galaxy,MOO Manual (PC) p. 56 protected by a powerful warship, the Guardian. Victory is gained either by eliminating all opponents or by winning a vote on peaceful unification. There are seven normal and six hostile planet types. The various hostile types require increasingly advanced technology to colonize. Size determines the planet's initial population capacity. Mineral wealth dramatically influences a colony's industrial productivity while Habitability influences population growth rates. Hostile planets are the most likely to be rich or ultra-rich in minerals.MOO Manual (PC) pp. 11-12 Artifact worlds contain relics of a now- vanished advanced civilization. All planets can be upgraded to Gaia class with the appropriate technologies.MOO Manual (PC) pp. 31-32 Planets can be upgraded in three ways: * Terraforming increases population capacity by a fixed amount for each tech level achieved, up to a maximum of 120 extra units. * Soil enrichment increases a planet's population capacity and growth rate but can not be used on hostile planets. The advanced version increases capacity by up to 50% of its initial value and doubles the rate of population growth. * Atmospheric terraforming converts hostile planets to normal ones, making soil enrichment possible there. Planet type does not affect the costs and benefits of terraforming and soil enrichment. The main screen, showing the planetary management controls on the right. Sliders are used to allocate a colony's output between ship construction, planetary defenses, factory construction, ecology, and research.MOO Manual (PC) p. viii Planetary population generates production, especially when assisted by factories.MOO Manual (PC) pp. 23-24 There is a limit on the number of factories a unit of population can operate, but building upgrades can increase this.MOO Manual (PC) pp. 8-9 Defence spending is used to build additional missile bases, upgrade missile bases or planetary shields. Military and spy maintenance is deducted from every colony's production.MOO Manual (PC) p. 31 A planet's output can also be transferred to the treasury at a loss. Ships can travel to any star system within their range and combat always occurs in orbit over a planet - it is impossible to intercept enemy ships in deep space.MOO Manual (PC) pp. vi-viii Players can control space combat manually or ask the software to resolve combat automatically.MOO Manual (PC) pp. 27-28 =Technology= The designers regard technology as the most important contribution to a player's success.MOO Manual (PC) pp. 25-26 Funding can be put into one or all of the game's six independent tech tree fields, including Computers, Construction, Force Fields, Planetary Science, Vehicle Propulsion, and Weapons. If a ship uses a component from a particular technology area, further advances in that area reduce the cost and size of the component; this effect is called \\"miniaturization\\". When one has researched all of the technologies in an area of the tech tree, further research can discover \\"advanced technologies\\" in that area, which do not provide specific new capabilities but increase the miniaturization of ship components. Battles are almost always decided by numbers and technology rather than by clever tactics. Players can design and use their own ships. There are four hull sizes; smaller sizes are harder to hit while larger ships can survive more damage and hold more components. There are eight types of components, each with different effects. Only six ship designs can be used at a time. =Diplomacy= Master of Orion provides a wide range of diplomatic negotiations: gifts of money or technology; one-time technology trades; trade pacts that boost industrial output; non-aggression and alliance treaties. Players can also threaten each other, declare war and arrange cease-fires.MOO Manual (PC) pp. 21-22 Each AI player remembers others' actions, both positive and negative, and will be unwilling to form alliances with a player who has broken previous treaties with it.MOO Manual (PC) pp. 33-34 Under AI control, each race has a ruler personality and an objective, such as Xenophobic Expansionist or Pacifistic Technologist. These traits guide their politics and economic management; for example militarists maintain large fleets and prioritize technologies which have military benefits, while ecologists put a lot of effort into pollution control and terraforming.MOO Manual (PC) pp. 42-43 Traits vary from game to game. Each race has most probable traits and avoids their opposites. Races may occasionally revolt and change traits. Hostile actions do not automatically cause war. Clashes are even expected at the opening of the game, when all sides are sending probes out into the unknown. On the other extreme, a ground assault must be knowingly targeted at an inhabited planet, and is a massive provocation. Colonies can be bombed from space, or taken in ground invasions. Ground invasions can be conducted through enemy defenses. Present enemy ships or missile bases will fire on the approaching transports, possibly destroying some or all of them.MOO Manual (PC) pp. vi, vii The invasion itself is fully automatic.MOO Manual (PC) pp. 51-54 Results depend on numbers, technology and (if one of the races involved is Bulrathi) racial ground combat bonus. Invasion is expensive. In the first game, there are no special soldier units; colonial population itself is sent to fight, exterminate the existing inhabitants, and form a new planetary population.MOO Manual (PC) p. vi The production capacity of any remaining factories can be gleaned, and plundering of technologies if enough factories survived the attack.MOO Manual (PC) p. 14 Controlling a new system extends the range of the invader's ships. Development Master of Orion is a significantly expanded and refined version of the prototype/predecessor game Star Lords (not to be confused with Starlord, also released by MicroProse in 1993). Steve Barcia's game development company Simtex demonstrated Star Lords to MicroProse and gaming journalist Alan Emrich who, along with Tom Hughes, assisted Barcia in refining the design to produce Master of Orion; and the game's manual thanks them for their contributions.MOO Manual (PC), \\"Credits\\" page Emrich and Hughes later wrote the strategy guide for the finished product. MicroProse published the final version of the game in 1994.Sources differ on this: *Supporting 1994: **\\"June 1, 1994\\" at ** *Supporting 1993: ** =Star Lords= Star Lords, often called Master of Orion 0 by fans, was a prototype and never commercially released (its intro opens with \\"SimTex Software and Your Company present\\"). The crude but fully playable prototype was made available as freeware in 2001, stripped of all documentation and copy protection, in anticipation of the launch of Master of Orion III. Major differences between Star Lords and Master of Orion include inferior graphics and interface, simpler trade and diplomacy, undirected research, a lack of safeguards to prevent players from building more factories than are usable and the use of transports rather than colony ships to colonize new planets. One feature of Star Lords that Master of Orion lacks is a table of relations between the computer-controlled races. The game was eventually made available for download on FilePlanet and the home page for Master of Orion III.  Reception  Emrich in a September 1993 Computer Gaming World preview described Master of Orion as \\"the best that galactic conquest can offer\\", and summarized its type of gameplay as \\"4X\\", meaning \\"eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate\\". He and later commentators noted earlier examples of this genre, including Civilization (1991) and Reach for the Stars (1983). The magazine's full December 1993 review stated that \\"Master of Orion is one of those games where one must actually put effort into finding something inadequate about the game design, and that in itself is probably the highest praise this reviewer can give a product.\\" The magazine concluded that it was \\"a definite Game of the Year candidate as well as Exhibit A in many divorce cases\\". A February 1994 survey of space war games gave Master of Orion a grade of A-, stating that \\"It's still conquest, but it's conquest that begins to have an interesting point to it\\". The reviewer wished that the game supported multiple players, but predicted that \\"I think MOO will safely reign supreme well into the new year\\". A 1994 survey of strategic space games set in the year 2000 and later gave the game four-plus stars out of five, stating that it was \\"a richly-textured product. Graphics coupled with high play yield a high recommendation\\". Next Generation reviewed the Macintosh version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"Strategy game of the year, NOT.\\" Master of Orion was named the best strategy game of 1993 by Computer Games Strategy Plus. It also won Computer Gaming Worlds Strategy Game of the Year award in June 1994. The editors called it \\"a game that is worthy of being called Civilization in Space'\\", and wrote that it \\"epitomizes and expands the 'Conquer the Galaxy' motif in strategy gaming\\". In retrospective reviews, Allgame, GameSpot and IGN regarded MoO as the standard by which turn based strategy games set in space are judged, although Allgame regretted the lack of a multiplayer option. In 1996, Computer Gaming World ranked Master of Orion as the 33rd best game of all time. In 2003, IGN ranked it as the 98th top game. Master of Orion is a member of both GameSpy's Hall of Fame (2001) and GameSpot's list of the greatest games of all time. In 1998, PC Gamer declared it the 45th-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it \\"a great sci-fi space epic\\". Legacy Three commercial sequels to Master of Orion have been released, Master of Orion II: Battle at Antares, Master of Orion III and Master of Orion: Conquer the Stars. The sequels are significantly more advanced in graphics and sound and feature large differences in gameplay, with some players claiming the original game remains the best version of the three. In 1997, MicroProse released a Master of Orion \\"Jr.\\" scenario as part of the Civ II: Fantastic Worlds expansion for Civilization II. In 2001, Star Lords, developed as Master of Orion prototype, was released as freeware as part of the promotion for Master of Orion III. Also a potential future release of the MOO and MOO2 source code was indicated by the MOO3 developers in 2001.MARCH 12, 2001 on moo3.quicksilver.com by Constantine Hantzopoulos, Senior Producer \\"MOO1 and 2 source code: The official word on MOO I/II source is we will not be releasing it any time soon. That doesn't preclude us from releasing it at a later date, and indeed we have secret plans for such things.\\" In 2011, a clone of MoO II, titled Starbase Orion, was published by Chimera Software, LLC for the iPhone. The game setting has been the influence of Russian writer Sergey Lukyanenko's trilogy, the Line of Delirium. In July 2013, Wargaming bought the Master of Orion franchise from the Atari bankruptcy proceedings. A \\"reimagining\\" subtitled Conquer the Stars was announced in June 2015 and released into early access on February 26, 2016. It was fully released on August 25, 2016.

The GST replaced a previous hidden 13.5% manufacturers' sales tax (MST); Introduced at an original rate of 7%, the GST rate has been lowered twice and currently sits at rate of 5%, since January 1, 2008. The GST raised 11.7% of total federal government revenue in 2017-18. In five provinces, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Ontario and Prince Edward Island, the GST is combined with provincial sales tax (PST) into a harmonized sales tax (HST), while Quebec has a de facto HST in that its provincial sales tax follows the same rules as the GST and both are collected and administered together by the provincial government. British Columbia had an HST from 2010 until 2013, when it was removed after a provincial referendum. Alberta and the territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut have the GST but no provincial or territorial sales taxes. Definition The goods and services tax is defined in law at Part IX of the Excise Tax Act. GST is levied on supplies of goods or services purchased in Canada and includes most products, except certain politically sensitive essentials such as groceries, residential rent, and medical services, and services such as financial services. Businesses that purchase goods and services that are consumed, used or supplied in the course of their \\"commercial activities\\" can claim \\"input tax credits\\" subject to prescribed documentation requirements (i.e., when they remit to the Canada Revenue Agency the GST they have collected in any given period of time, they are allowed to deduct the amount of GST they paid during that period). This avoids \\"cascading\\" (i.e., the application of the GST on the same good or service several times as it passes from business to business on its way to the final consumer). In this way, the tax is essentially borne by the final consumer. This system is not completely effective, as shown by criminals who defrauded the system by claiming GST input credits for non-existent sales by a fictional company. Exported goods are \\"zero-rated\\", while individuals with low incomes can receive a GST rebate calculated in conjunction with their income tax. Untaxed items The tax is a 5% tax imposed on the supply of goods and services that are purchased in Canada, except certain items that are either \\"exempt\\" or \\"zero-rated\\": * For tax-free ‚Äî i.e., \\"zero-rated\\" ‚Äî sales, GST is charged by suppliers at a rate of 0% so effectively there is no GST collected. However, when a supplier makes a zero-rated supply, it is eligible to recover any GST paid on purchases used in producing the particular supply or service. This effectively removes the cascading tax from these particular goods and services. **Common zero-rated items include basic groceries, prescription drugs, inward/outbound transportation and medical devices (GST/HST Memoranda Series ME-04-02-9801-E 4.2 Medical and Assistive Devices). Certain exports of goods and services are also zero-rated. Print books and print scholarly journals are untaxed; however, ebooks and online periodicals are taxed as well as any periodicals with a significant amount of advertising. * For tax-exempt supplies, the supply is not subject to GST and suppliers do not charge tax on their exempt supplies. Furthermore, suppliers that make exempt supplies are not entitled to recover GST paid on inputs acquired for the purposes of making the exempt good or service (subject to certain public sector body rebates). Tax-exempt items include long term residential rents, health and dental care, educational services, day-care services, music lessons, legal aid services, and financial services. Background In 1989, the Progressive Conservative government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and his finance minister Michael Wilson proposed the creation of a national sales tax of 9%. At that time, every province in Canada except Alberta already had its own provincial sales tax imposed at the retail level. The purpose of the national sales tax was to replace the 13.5% Manufacturers' Sales Tax (MST) that the federal government imposed at the wholesale level on manufactured goods. Mulroney claimed the GST was implemented because the MST was hindering the manufacturing sector's ability to export competitively. Manufacturers were concerned that the tax hurt their international competitiveness. The GST also replaced the Federal Telecommunications Tax of 11%. The introduction of the GST was very controversial. Although the GST was promoted as revenue-neutral in relation to the MST, a large proportion of the Canadian population disapproved of the tax. The other parties in Parliament also attacked the idea as did three Progressive Conservative Members of Parliament, David Kilgour, Pat Nowlan, and Alex Kindy, who ended up leaving the Progressive Conservative caucus as a result. The Liberal-dominated Senate refused to pass the tax into law. In an unprecedented move to break the deadlock, Mulroney used a little-known constitutional provision (Section 26 of the Constitution Act, 1867) to increase the number of senators by eight temporarily, thus giving the Progressive Conservatives a majority in the upper chamber. In response, the Opposition launched a filibuster and further delayed the legislation. Despite the tax being lowered to 7% by the time it became enacted, it remained controversial. What the tax covered also caused anger. The Government defended the tax as a replacement for a tax unseen by consumers because it was placed on manufacturers, and in the long run it was posited that removing the MST would make Canada more competitive. Once the MST was replaced with the GST prices did not initially fall by the level some thought appropriate immediately; however, proponents have argued that in Canada's market economy the MST's replacement could only be expected to influence prices over time and not on a stroke. Despite the opposition, the tax came into force on January 1, 1991. Reactions A strong Liberal Party majority was elected under the leadership of Jean Chr√©tien in the 1993 election. The Progressive Conservative Party fared very poorly in that election, winning only two seats. Although the party recovered somewhat in subsequent elections, it remained the smallest party in the House of Commons until it disbanded itself permanently in 2004, and merged with the Canadian Alliance to form the Conservative Party of Canada. During the election campaign, Chr√©tien promised to repeal the GST, which the Liberals had denounced while they were the Official Opposition, and replace it with a different tax. Instead of repeal, the Chr√©tien government attempted to restructure the tax and merge it with the provincial sales taxes in each province. They intended to call it the \\"Blended Sales Tax\\", but opponents quickly came to derisively call this proposal the \\"B.S. Tax\\", and the name was changed to Harmonized Sales Tax before its introduction. However, only three Atlantic provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador) agreed to go along with this plan, joined by British Columbia and Ontario in 2010, and Prince Edward Island in 2013. British Columbia later repealed the tax. The decision not to abolish or replace the GST caused great controversy. Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) John Nunziata voted against the Liberal government's first budget and was expelled from the party. Heritage Minister Sheila Copps, who had personally promised to oppose the tax, resigned and sought re-election. She was re-elected with ease in the subsequent by- election, as was the Liberal government in the 1997 election. Provincial Variance In 1997, the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland (now Newfoundland and Labrador) and the Government of Canada merged their respective sales taxes into the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). In all Atlantic provinces, the current HST rate is 15%. HST is administered by the Canada Revenue Agency, with revenues divided among participating governments according to a formula. Ontario and British Columbia both harmonized the GST with their provincial sales tax (PST) effective July 1, 2010. However, the British Columbia HST was defeated in an August 2011 mail-in referendum by a 55% majority vote, and was converted to the old GST/PST system effective April 1, 2013. On the same day, Prince Edward Island enacted HST at the rate of 14%. In Ontario, the HST totals 13%; however, many of the pre-HST exemptions remain affecting only the provincial portion of the HST (for example, prepared food under $4.00 is not subject to the provincial portion of HST and is only taxed at 5%). On the other hand, some items that were only subjected to the PST are now charged the full HST (i.e., 13%). Although the Government of Ontario has made efforts to provide documentation as to what items are affected and how, this causes some confusion for consumers as they are often not sure what taxes to expect at the checkout. To accommodate these exemptions, many retailers simply display each tax individually as HST 1 and HST 2 (or some variant). The move to HST came about as part of Ontario's 2009 provincial budget. Only three provinces (British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan) continue to impose a separate sales tax at the retail level only. Alberta is the exception, not imposing a provincial sales tax. Current situation On July 1, 2006, the Government of Canada reduced the tax by 1 percentage point (to 6%), as promised by the Conservative Party in the 2006 election campaign. They again lowered it to 5%, effective January 1, 2008. This reduction was included in the Final 2007 Budget Implementation Bill (Bill C-28), which received Royal Assent on December 14, 2007. This change has been estimated to have decreased government revenues by approximately $6 billion. Opponents of these tax decreases cited that sales taxes target those who spend more and therefore such reductions disproportionately benefit Canadians giving those who have the most and spend the most the largest tax decrease. Much of the reason for the notoriety of the GST in Canada is for reasons of an obscure Constitutional provision. Other countries with a Value Added Tax legislate that posted prices include the tax; thus, consumers are vaguely aware of it but \\"what they see is what they pay\\". Canada cannot do this because jurisdiction over most advertising and price-posting is in the domain of the provinces under the Constitution Act, 1867. The provinces have chosen not to require prices to include the GST, similar to their provincial sales taxes. As a result, virtually all prices (except for fuel pump prices, taxi meters and a few other things) are shown \\"pre-GST\\", with the tax (or taxes) listed separately.

The islands are separated from the mainland to the east by the shallow Hecate Strait. Queen Charlotte Sound lies to the south, with Vancouver Island beyond. To the north, the disputed Dixon Entrance separates Haida Gwaii from the Alexander Archipelago in the U.S. state of Alaska. Haida Gwaii consists of two main islands: Graham Island () in the north and Moresby Island (, literally: south people island half, or \\"Islands of Beauty\\") in the south, along with approximately 400 smaller islands with a total landmass of . Other major islands include Anthony Island ( / ), Burnaby Island (), Alder Island ( / ), and Kunghit Island. (For a fuller, but still incomplete, list see List of islands of British Columbia). Part of the Canadian province of British Columbia, the islands were formerly known as the Queen Charlotte Islands, and colloquially as \\"the Charlottes\\". On June 3, 2010, the Haida Gwaii Reconciliation Act formally renamed the archipelago as part of the Kunst'aa guu ‚Äì Kunst'aayah Reconciliation Protocol between British Columbia and the Haida people. The islands form the heartland of the Haida Nation. People have lived on the islands for 13,000 years, and currently make up approximately half of the population.History of the Haida Nation, Council of the Haida Nation, retrieved 2014-08-16: \\"Today, Haida people make up half of the 5000 people living on the islands.\\" The Haida exercise their sovereignty over the islands through their acting government, the Council of the Haida Nation (CHN, ), which aspires to independence. As recently as 2015, the Haida Nation hosted First Nations delegations such as the Potlatch and subsequent treaty signing between the Haida and Heiltsuk Nation. A small number of Kaigani Haida also live on the traditionally Tlingit Prince of Wales Island in Alaska. Some of the islands are protected under federal legislation as the Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site, which includes the southernmost part of Moresby Island and several adjoining islands and islets. Coastal temperate rain forest at the shore, the preserve also includes the San Christoval Mountains. Facilities are minimal and access is via boat or seaplane. Also protected, but under provincial jurisdiction, are several provincial parks, the largest of which is Naikoon Provincial Park on northeastern Graham Island. The islands are home to an abundance of wildlife, including the largest subspecies of black bear (Ursus americanus carlottae) and also the smallest subspecies of stoat (Mustela erminea haidarum). Black- tailed deer and raccoon are introduced species that have become abundant.  Transportation  There is no public transportation on Haida Gwaii. Taxis and car rentals are available, and shuttles can be arranged. The primary transportation links between the Islands and mainland British Columbia are through the Sandspit Airport, the Masset Airport and the BC Ferries terminal at Skidegate. The westernmost leg of Highway 16 connects Masset and Skidegate on Graham Island, and Skidegate with Prince Rupert on the mainland via regular BC Ferries service by the MV Northern Adventure. Reservations are strongly recommended for the ferry. There is also regular BC Ferries service between Skidegate and Alliford Bay on Moresby Island. Floatplane services connect to facilities such as the Alliford Bay Water Aerodrome and Masset Water Aerodrome. There are of highway on Graham Island. On Moresby, only of paved road line the coast.  Economy  The economy is mixed, including art and natural resources, primarily logging and commercial fishing. Furthermore, service industries and government jobs provide about one-third of the jobs, and tourism has become a more prominent part of the economy in recent years, especially for fishing and tour guides, cycling, camping, and adventure tourism. Aboriginal culture tourism has been enhanced with the establishment of the Haida Heritage Centre at Kaay Ilnygaay.  Education  Public education is provided through School District 50 Haida Gwaii, which operates elementary and secondary schools in Masset, Port Clements, Queen Charlotte, Sandspit, and Skidegate. Higher education programs are offered at the Haida Heritage Centre in partnership with Coast Mountain College, University of Northern British Columbia, and with the Haida Gwaii Higher Education Society.Haida Gwaii Higher Education Society webpage. Retrieved 2014-02-02  Health care  Publicly funded health services are provided by Northern Health, the regional health authority responsible for the northern half of the province. Haida Gwaii is served by two hospitals, The Northern Haida Gwaii Hospital and Health Centre in Masset and the Haida Gwaii Hospital in Queen Charlotte which was completed in Fall 2015. Haida Gwaii has four British Columbia Ambulance stations. They are staffed by approximately 36 casual Emergency Medical Responders (EMR), and 1 Part-Time Community Paramedic based in Masset.  Population  At the time of colonial contact in 1774, the population was roughly 30,000 people, residing in several towns and including slave populations drawn from other clans of Haida as well as from other nations. It is estimated that ninety percent of the population died during the 1800s from smallpox alone; other diseases arrived as well, including typhoid, measles, and syphilis, affecting many more inhabitants. By 1900, only 350 people remained. Towns were abandoned as people left their homes for the towns of Skidegate and Masset, for cannery towns on the mainland, or for Vancouver Island. Today, around 4,500 people live on the islands. About 70% of the indigenous people (Haida) live in two communities at Skidegate and Old Massett, with a population of about 700 each. In total the Haida make up 45% of the population of the islands. Anthony Island and the Ninstints Haida village site were made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006; in the decision, the decline in population wrought by disease was referenced when citing the 'vanished civilization' of the Haida.  History  Houses and totem poles, Skidegate, 26 July 1878 (George Mercer Dawson, Geological Survey of Canada, NAC-PA-37756) Haida Gwaii is considered by archaeologists as an option for a Pacific coastal route taken by the first humans migrating to the Americas from the Bering Strait. At this time Haida Gwaii was likely not an island, but connected to Vancouver Island and the mainland via the now submerged continental shelf. It is unclear how people arrived on Haida Gwaii, but archaeological sites have established human habitation on the islands as far back as 13,000 years ago. Populations that formerly inhabited Beringia expanded into northern North America after the Last Glacial Maximum, and gave rise to Eskimo-Aleuts and Na-Den√© Indians. Underwater archaeologists from the University of Victoria are seeking to confirm that stone structures discovered in 2014 on the seabed of Hecate Strait may date back 13,700 or more years ago and be the earliest known signs of human habitation in Canada. Coastal sites of this era are now deep underwater. = Pre-colonial era = The coastal migration hypothesis of the settlement of the Americas suggests that the first North Americans may have been here as the oldest human remains known from Alaska or Canada are from On Your Knees Cave. Anthropologists have found striking parallels between the myths, rituals, and dwelling types of the Koryaks‚Äîinhabitants of the Kamchatka Peninsula‚Äîand those of the native peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast. At this time the island was twice as large as today. There is strong genetic evidence for these early people having an origin there. The Koryaks were a matrilineal seafaring people hunting whales and other marine mammals. Their god was Kujkynnjaku, the Raven. Most of the Raven myths are similar to those of the Koryak. The group of people inhabiting these Islands developed a culture made rich by the abundance of the land and sea. These people became the Haida. The Haida are a linguistically-distinct group, and they have a complex class and rank system consisting of two main clans, the Eagles and Ravens. Links and diversity within the Haida Nation were gained through a cross lineal marriage system between the clans. This system was also important for the transfer of wealth within the Nation, with each clan reliant on the other for the building of longhouses, the carving of totem poles and other items of cultural importance. Noted seafarers, the Haida occupied more than 100 villages throughout the Islands. The Haida were skilled traders, with established trade links with their neighbouring First Nations on the mainland to California. The Haida people regularly took slaves from their wars with other peoples around them.https://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/aborig/haida/hapso01e.html = Colonial era = The archipelago was first sighted by Europeans in 1774 by Juan P√©rez, at Langara Island, and in 1778 by James Cook. In 1794, the Haida captured and sank a pair of European vessels, Ino and Resolution, that were seeking to trade for sea otter pelts. Most of the ships' crew were killed. In 1851, the Haida captured the Georgiana, a ship carrying gold prospectors, and held its crew for ransom for nearly two months. The islands played an important role during the maritime fur trade era of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. During most of that era the trade in the islands was dominated by Americans. The Oregon Treaty of 1846 put an end to American claims to the islands. Following the discovery of gold in the 1850s the British made efforts to exclude whatever American territorial claims might remain. In the mid-19th century, a population of tens of thousands was reduced by smallpox to about one thousand. Hostile colonial administration further reduced the population to 600 by 1900. The Colony of the Queen Charlotte Islands was a British colony constituting the archipelago of the same name from 1853 to July 1863, when it was amalgamated into the Colony of British Columbia. The Colony of the Queen Charlotte Islands was created by the Colonial Office in response to the increase in American marine trading activity resulting from the gold rush on Moresby Island in 1851. No separate administration or capital for the colony was ever established, as its only officer or appointee was James Douglas, who was simultaneously Governor of Vancouver Island. In essence, the colony was merged with the Vancouver Island colony for administrative purposes from the 1850s to 1866 when the Colony of Vancouver Island was merged with the mainland, which until that point was the separate Colony of British Columbia.  Naming  The northern Pacific Northwest Coast, showing the position of the archipelago in relation to other islands in the region. The southern half of Prince of Wales Island is Kaigani Haida territory, but is not included in the term Haida Gwaii. In 1787 Captain George Dixon surveyed the islands. He named the islands the Queen Charlotte Islands after his ship, the Queen Charlotte, which was named after Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of King George III of the United Kingdom. Another name, \\"Washington's Isles,\\" was commonly used by American traders, who frequented the islands in the days of the marine fur trade and considered the islands part of the US-claimed Oregon Country. Following the 1846 Oregon Treaty, which established the current international borders and made the islands definitively part of Canada, the \\"Queen Charlotte Islands\\" name became official. On December 11, 2009, the British Columbia government announced that legislation would be introduced in mid-2010 to officially rename the Queen Charlotte Islands to the new name \\"Haida Gwaii\\". The legislation received royal assent on June 3, 2010, formalizing the name change. At an official Giving Back the Name ceremony, the name, written on a piece of paper and placed in a bentwood box, was handed to the premier of British Columbia. This name change is officially recognized by all levels of Canadian governments, and also by the United States' National Geospatial- Intelligence Agency name database. The name ' is a modern coinage and was created in the early 1980s as an alternative to the colonial-era name \\"Queen Charlotte Islands\\", to recognize the history of the Haida people. \\"Haida Gwaii\\" means \\"islands of the people\\", while ' on its own means not only \\"us\\" but also \\"people\\". Still in use is the older name ' or, in alternative orthography, ', meaning \\"islands at the boundary of the world\\". ' (\\"worlds\\") refers here to the sea and sky.  Environment  Hemlock forest in Gwaii Hanaas National Park Research by Simon Fraser University concludes that Haida Gwaii around 55,000 BCE was likely covered with tundra and low meadows that were populated by grazing mammals including caribou and mammoths. Although no mammoth or mastodon fossils were found, the research discovered dung-eating fungi underground in ancient peat by the Cape Ball site in Naikoon Provincial Park on Graham Island. The tundra-like landscape then evolved to a mix of alpine forest and meadows. The last Pleistocene glaciation receded from the archipelago about 16,000 BCE, about 2,000 years earlier than the rest of the British Columbia Coast's ice age. That, and its subsequent isolation from the mainland, encouraged Haida indigenous and environmental activists in the 1970s to use the term \\"Gal√°pagos of the North\\", a unique biocultural zone with many endemic plants and animals. The climate of this temperate north hemisphere forested region, like that of much of the British Columbia and Alaskan coast in the area, is moderated by the North Pacific Current, with heavy rainfall and relatively mild temperatures throughout the year. The islands are home to the Ta'an Forest, with a wide variety of large endemic trees, including the Sitka spruce, western red cedar, yellow cedar (Nootka cypress), shore pine, western hemlock, mountain hemlock, western yew and red alder. The Flora of the Queen Charlotte Islands describes plants from the islands. Soils are variable. Peat is common in poorly drained flats and even on sloping ground in the wetter areas. Where drainage is good, the mature soils are podzols that have classic development (well defined eluvial horizon, Ae under Canadian classification) in undisturbed areas.Banner, A., W.H. MacKenzie, J. Pojar, A. MacKinnon, S.C. Saunders, and H. Klassen. 2014. A field guide to ecosystem classification and identification for Haida Gwaii. Prov. B.C., Victoria, B.C. Land Manag.

Kiidk'yaas (Golden Spruce), a naturally occurring genetic-variant yellow-colour Sitka spruce tree, was near the Yakoun River, the largest on Graham Island. It was a popular tourist attraction until it was illegally cut down in 1997 as a protest against the industrial logging practices. From the spring of 1996 until November 30, 1997, a popular attraction for tourists to the islands was a male albino white raven. He lived around Port Clements and would commonly be seen taking food handouts from locals and visitors alike. He died after making contact with an electrical transformer. The white raven was preserved by former Port Clements residents, taxidermists Roger Britten Sr. and Jr., and is on display in the Port Clements Historical Society's museum.Port Clements Historical Society \\"White Raven\\" display case information  Climate  The climate is oceanic (Cfb), except near the summit of Mount Moresby where the climate is subpolar oceanic (Cfc).

Snowfall is generally moderate, averaging from to , though at northerly Langara Island, it averages around . Precipitation is typically extremely frequent (especially from autumn to mid-winter), occurring on around two-thirds of all days even in relatively shielded areas, and direct sunlight is scarce, averaging around 3 to 4 hours per day. = 2012 controversy around depositing iron in the ocean = In July 2012, entrepreneur Russ George dispersed of iron sulphate dust into the Pacific Ocean several hundred miles west of the islands of Haida Gwaii. The Old Massett Village Council was persuaded to finance this geoengineering experiment as a \\"salmon enhancement project\\" with $1 million in village funds. The concept was that the formerly iron-deficient waters would produce more phytoplankton that would in turn produce more salmon. George hoped to finance the project by using the carbon sequestration effects of the new plankton as marketable carbon offsets. The project has been plagued by charges of unscientific procedures and recklessness. George contended that 100 tons of iron is negligible compared to what naturally enters the ocean. Lawyers, environmentalists, and civil society groups are calling the dumping a \\"blatant violation\\" of two international moratoriums. George said that the Old Massett Village Council and its lawyers approved the effort and at least seven Canadian agencies were aware of it. In May 2013, the Haida Salmon Restoration Corporation removed George as a director of the company and ended his employment. The 2013 salmon runs increased from 50 million to 226 million fish, but research conducted on 13 major iron-fertilization experiments in the open ocean since 1990 concludes that the method is unproven, and with respect to the Haida Gwaii project, \\"scientists have seen no evidence that the experiment worked\\".  Geology  = Earthquake hazards = The islands are located along the Queen Charlotte Fault, an active transform fault that produces significant earthquakes every 3‚Äì30 years. This is the result of the converging of the Pacific and North American Plates along the archipelago's west coast. Major earthquakes have occurred in the Haida Gwaii in 1949 and 2012. Though the region is prone to fair geological activity, there is little infrastructure set up to gather accurate information to warn locals of possible threats. Many residents, notably from First Nations communities, have been critical of the fact that they must rely on information coming from neighboring American states such as Washington or Alaska and from the USGS (United States Geological Survey). Regardless of the inconsistencies, Environment Canada does regularly do field tests across the Pacific coast of British Columbia relating to this matter. The Cascadia subduction zone does pose some additional earthquake risks, but, most importantly, the subduction zone poses direct tsunami risks to the coastal settlements on the western side of the islands.  Culture  Totem pole in World Museum, Liverpool = Visual arts = The artwork known as Spirit of Haida Gwaii, by Bill Reid, is featured on the reverse of Canadian $20 bills produced between 2004 and 2011. It depicts a Haida chief in a canoe, accompanied by the mythic messengers Raven, Frog and Eagle (the first casting of this sculpture, Spirit of Haida Gwaii: The Black Canoe, is on display in the atrium of the Canadian Embassy in Washington DC, the other, Spirit of Haida Gwaii: the Jade Canoe, is on display in Vancouver Airport). Haida art is also frequently seen on large monumental-sized cedar totem poles and dugout canoes, hand-crafted gold and silver jewellery, and even as cartoons in the form of Haida manga. = Haida language = The Haida language was proposed for classification as part of the Nadene family of languages on the basis of a few similarities with Athabaskan‚ÄìEyak‚ÄìTlingit. Many linguists, however, consider the evidence insufficient and continue to regard Haida as a language isolate. All 50 remaining speakers of Haida are over 70 years old.

In its wider sense, it was used to refer to all Ottoman possessions and vassals that would later be geopolitically classified as \\"the Balkans\\". Etymology Map of Rumelia in 1795 R√ªm means \\"Roman\\" or \\"Greek\\", ƒóli means \\"land\\" and Rumelia (, R≈´m-ƒóli; Turkish: Rumeli) means \\"Land of the Romans\\" in Ottoman Turkish. It refers to the lands conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans, which formerly belonged to the Byzantine Empire, known by its contemporaries as the Roman Empire (German historian Hieronymus Wolf coined the neologism \\"Byzantine Empire\\" in 1557, more than a century after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, in his work Corpus Histori√¶ Byzantin√¶.)Encyclop√¶dia Britannica ‚Äì Rumelia at Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.com Although the term Byzantine Empire is used by modern historians, the empire's citizens and emperors called themselves Romans and embraced a Roman identity. Various languages in the Balkans have long used the descriptor \\"Roman\\" to refer to the lands of the former Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire. Indeed, today the term survives in the region as , , Romyl√≠a, or Œ°ŒøœçŒºŒµŒªŒ∑, Ro√∫meli; ; Macedonian and , Rumelija and , Rumeliya. The old Latin documents in Genoa use the term Romania, the common name for the Byzantine Empire during the Middle Ages. Originally, the Seljuks used the name \\"Land of the R√ªm\\" (Romans) to define Anatolia, which the armies of the Seljuk Empire gradually conquered from the former Eastern Roman Empire after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. The Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate was called the Sultanate of Rum by its contemporaries, meaning the \\"Sultanate of the Roman Empire\\" or \\"Roman Sultanate\\", which mostly covered central Anatolia until the Battle of K√∂se Daƒü in 1243. Afterwards, it was replaced by the Anatolian beyliks, among which the Ottoman Beylik rose to prominence in the 14th and 15th centuries and eventually became the Ottoman Empire. However, following the expansion of the Ottoman Empire into Anatolia and the Balkans in the second half of the 14th century and after the conquest of Constantinople (now Istanbul) in 1453 by Mehmed II, the term Rumeli (\\"Land of the Romans\\") came to apply exclusively to the Balkan region of the Ottoman Empire. The region remained primarily populated by Christians; though gradually, the Albanians, Bosniaks and Pomaks, among others, converted to Islam. Many grand viziers, viziers, pashas and beylerbeyis were originally from Rumelia. Geography Rumeli Hisarƒ± (Rumelian Fortress, 1452) on the European shore of the Bosphorus Strait in Istanbul. Rumelia included the provinces of Thrace, Macedonia and Moesia, which are now Bulgaria and Turkish Thrace, bounded to the north by the rivers Sava and Danube, west by the Adriatic coast and south by the Morea. The name \\"Rumelia\\" was ultimately applied to a province composed of central Albania and northwestern Macedonia, with Bitola being the main town. Following the administrative reorganization made by the Ottoman government between 1870 and 1875, the name Rumelia ceased to correspond to any political division. Eastern Rumelia was constituted as an autonomous province of the Ottoman Empire by the Treaty of Berlin (1878), but on September 6, 1885, after a bloodless revolution, it was united with Bulgaria. The Kosovo Vilayet was created in 1877. In Turkey, the word Trakya (Thrace) has now mostly replaced Rumeli (Rumelia) to refer to the part of Turkey that is in Europe (the provinces of Edirne, Kƒ±rklareli, Tekirdaƒü, the northern part of √áanakkale Province and the western part of Istanbul Province). However, \\"Rumelia\\" remains in use in historical contexts and is still used in the context of the culture of the current Turkish populations of the Balkans and the descendants of Turkish immigrants from the Balkans. The region in Turkey is also referred to as Eastern Thrace, or Turkish Thrace. In Greece, the term () has been used since Ottoman times to refer to Central Greece, especially when it is juxtaposed with the Peloponnese or Morea. The word Rumeli is also used in some cases, mostly in Istanbul, to refer exclusively to the part of Istanbul Province that is west of the Bosphorus strait.

Displacing around 680 tons, she was armed with one smoothbore and six smoothbore cannon. Originally operating as a rebel ship under the Mexican flag with the name Marqu√©s de la Havana, the wooden sloop was captured as a pirate ship by the United States Navy sloop-of-war during the Battle of Anton Lizardo on 6 March 1860. A construction plan authorizing the building of ten fast gunboats was funded by the Congress of the Confederate States on 15 March 1861. Recognizing that no yard could turn out the vessels fast enough, Confederate States Secretary of the Navy Stephen R. Mallory sent a commission to New Orleans, Louisiana, to convert existing steamers to commerce raiders. The Confederate States Navy purchased Marqu√©s de la Havana at New Orleans on 17 March 1861, and duly fitted her out as CSS McRae as part of this plan. Extensive engine repairs prevented McRae from going to sea before the arrival of the Union blockading force. Placed under the command of Lieutenant Thomas B. Huger, McRae served as part of Flag Officer George N. Hollins' defense of the lower reaches of the Mississippi River, and provided cover for blockade runners. This led to McRae seeing combat with the Union blockading force on 12 October 1861. McRae took part in the Battle of the Head of Passes as part of Hollins‚Ä≤ \\"mosquito fleet,\\" driving the Union blockading forces from the Head of Passes in the Mississippi Delta. McRae again saw action on 24 April 1862 as the Union fleet attempted to pass Fort Jackson and Fort Saint Philip and reach New Orleans. In the resulting Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, McRae suffered little damage in the beginning due to her resemblance to the Union Unadilla-class gunboats. The leading Union ships passed by her without firing. The sloop-of-war was an exception, and replied to McRae‚Ä≤s gunfire with an 11-inch (279-mm) shell that set fire to McRaes sail room and threatened her magazines.Hearn, The Capture of New Orleans, 1862 pp. 232-3 The officers and crew fought hard in this latter engagement but suffered severe casualties (Huger being amongst those mortally wounded), and McRae herself was severely damaged. She was run against the shore to put out her fires, and remained there till dawn, after which she returned to the forts. Loaded with wounded from the forts, McRae was allowed to return to New Orleans on 27 April 1862 under a flag of truce. After landing the wounded at the city, her crew scuttled and abandoned her at Algiers, Louisiana (now a neighborhood of New Orleans), after cutting all her steam pipes.Hearn, The Capture of New Orleans, 1862 p. 246 See also * Battle of Anton Lizardo References Steamships of Mexico Vessels captured by the United States Navy Gunboats of the Confederate States Navy Shipwrecks of the Mississippi River Shipwrecks of the American Civil War Pirate ships Maritime incidents in April 1862 Ship fires Scuttled vessels ","title":"CSS McRae"},{"id":"296427","text":"The South London Theatre is a community theatre housed in a Grade II listed former fire station, in West Norwood in the London Borough of Lambeth, England. The first play opened in October 1967, and it is now a busy theatrical venue, presenting more than 22 shows annually in its theatre space, which was remodelled during refurbishment of the Old Fire Station during the period 2015‚Äì2018. The theatre facilities also consist of two dedicated rehearsal spaces, an entire floor of wardrobe rooms and a private basement bar, open Sunday to Friday evenings to audiences and members and which plays host to regular social events. The adult theatre group welcomes both Full Members (participatory) and Friends of SLT (audience supporters) and stages productions across genres, including Shakespeare, theatrical classics, comedy, pantomime, musicals and modern cutting-edge drama. New writing is particularly encouraged, as are aspiring directors. All involvement at the theatre is on a volunteer basis with support and basic training provided as required. Additionally, there is an active youth group (known as the \\"SLT Youth Theatre\\") offering classes for young people aged 7‚Äì18yrs, on Saturdays during term time. The youth have their own showcases and are also encouraged to participate in the productions of the adult group. The South London Theatre is a member of the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain. Theatre building The Gothic revival style former fire station was probably designed by the architect Robert Pearsall at the Metropolitan Board of Works Architect's Department and was built in 1881. It remains a rare example of a fire station built for horse-drawn tenders which still has the look-out tower and original doors in place. Its history as a fire station was short however, as motorised fire appliances, introduced in the early 20th century were too big for its doors, which could not be practicably extended, and the fire station ceased to function as such in 1917. Between 1917 and 1967, the building was used mainly as a church hall for the neighbouring St Luke's Church. The original design for the conversion to a theatre was by Owen LuderSouth London Theatre . The Theatres Trust. Retrieved 23 October 2013. (later to become President of the Royal Institute of British Architects on two occasions). The original theatre was traditional proscenium arch in style, with a fly loft requiring the removal of a floor in part of the first storey. The auditorium had raked seating with a capacity of just under 100. The space was known as Bell Theatre. In February 1975 a small studio theatre was added in a single storey extension at the South end of the building for \\"productions which would not fit into the usual theatre pattern.\\" This space was known as Prompt Corner. Following refurbishment, the theatre now has one large theatre space and several rooms which are available to hire, when not in use by the community group.

These doors had been boarded and secured in the Owen Luder design, forming the rear boundary to the Bell Theatre stage space. Whilst the building was significantly remodelled, the community theatre relocated to Stanley Halls in South Norwood and Youth Group performances were staged in St Luke's Church next door. In April 2018, the first production was staged in the new and enlarged black box theatre, as the South London Theatre community was returned to West Norwood and the building reopened. During refurbishment, the theatre spaces were combined and reworked to create the new theatre space and a generous foyer. The fly loft was closed over to reform the floor on the first storey, the earlier single storey extension housing Prompt Corner was demolished, and a four-storey extension added in its footprint, to accommodate part of the new theatre space, along with the technical gallery, props store, toilet facilities and a second staircase to all floors. A lift shaft was also added to the rear of the building. All spaces were then sensitively restored and redecorated, with rooms on the fourth floor named Prompt and Bell in recognition of the former performance spaces. Other rooms have been named The Watch Room and The Kit Room in recognition of their former functions and the building's fire station heritage.

The Illusion of Free Markets: Punishment and the Myth of Natural Order. Harvard University Press. p. 236 The most common agents of PIC are corporations that contract cheap prison labor, construction companies, surveillance technology vendors, companies that operate prison food services and medical facilities,Alex Friedmann (15 January 2012).

Retrieved 23 July 2014. correctional officers unions, private probation companies, lawyers, and lobby groups that represent them. The portrayal of prison-building/expansion as a means of creating employment opportunities and the utilization of inmate labor are particularly harmful elements of the prison-industrial complex as they boast clear economic benefits at the expense of the incarcerated populace. The term also refers to the network of participants who prioritize personal financial gain over rehabilitating criminals. Proponents of this view, including civil rights organizations such as the Rutherford Institute and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), believe that the desire for monetary gain through prison privatization has led to the growth of the prison industry and contributed to the increase of incarcerated individuals. These advocacy groups assert that incentivizing the construction of more prisons for monetary gain will encourage incarceration, which would affect people of color at disproportionately high rates.  History  Following the War on Drugs and the passing of harsher sentencing legislation, private sector prisons began to emerge to keep up with the rapidly expanding prison population. = Late 1970s = The Prison Industry Enhancement Certification Program (PIECP) is a federal program that was initiated along with the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and the Prison-Industries Act in 1979. This program legalized the transportation of prison-made goods across state lines and allows prison inmates to earn market wages in private sector jobs that can go towards tax deductions, victim compensation, family support, and room and board. The PIECP, ALEC, and Prison-Industries Act were created with the goal of motivating state and local governments to create employment opportunities that mimic private sector work, generate services that allow offenders to contribute to society, offset the cost of their incarceration, reduce inmate idleness, cultivate job skills, and improve the success rates of transition back into the community after release. Before these programs, prison labor for the private sector had been outlawed for decades to avoid competition. The introduction of prison labor in the private sector, the implementation of PIECP, ALEC, and Prison-Industries Act in state prisons all contributed a substantial role in cultivating the prison-industrial complex. Between the years 1980 through 1994, prison industry profits jumped substantially from $392 million to $1.31 billion. = 1980s = In January 1983, the Corrections Corporations of America (CCA) was founded by Nashville businessmen and would grow to become one of the oldest and largest for-profit private prison companies in America, laying the groundwork for a transformation in layout of corrections facilities across the country. The 58 was established with the goal of creating public-private partnerships in corrections by substituting government shortcomings with more efficient solutions. The first facility managed by CCA opened in April 1984 in Houston, Texas. As of 2012, the multibillion-dollar corporation, now known as CoreCivic, manages over 65 correctional facilities and boasts of a revenue exceeding over 1.7 billion dollars. To run the most efficient prisons possible, CCA cut costs by reducing personnel and designing its prisons to include more video cameras for surveillance and clustered cell blocks for easier monitoring. For private prisons, labor is the biggest expense at 70 percent of overall costs, and as a result, CCA and other private prisons have become motivated to cut labor costs by understaffing its prisons. In 1988, the second largest for-profit private prison corporation, Wackenhut Corrections Corporation (WCC) was established as a subsidiary of The Wackenhut Corporation. The WCC would later develop into GEO Group and as of 2017, their U.S. Corrections and Detention division manages 70 correctional and detention facilities. Their mission statement is as follows: = 1990s = In 1992, William Barr, then United States Attorney General, authored a report, The Case for More Incarceration, which argued for an increase in the United States incarceration rate. The passing of mandatory minimum sentencing and truth in sentencing legislation contributed greatly to the exponential growth in the prison population throughout the 1990s. Mandatory minimum sentencing had a disproportionately high effect on the number of African-American and other minority inmates in detention facilities. Throughout the 1990s, the CCA and GeoGroup were both heavily connected to the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), and were recognized for their substantial contributions in 1999. In 1994, President Bill Clinton passed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, the largest crime bill in history. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act directly allotted an increase of funding of $9.7 billion for prisons and introduced the three- strikes law, which subjected convicts of three offences to exceedingly long sentences (25 year to life minimum), amplifying the effects of mass incarceration and increasing the profit margins of the private specialized corporations such as CCA and GeoGroup and their subsidiaries. By May 1995, there were over 1.5 million people incarcerated, an increase from 949,000 inmates in 1993. = 2000s = From 1984 to 2000, the overall state spending on prisons increased at an alarmingly high rate and from the year 1970 to 2005, the number of inmates in the United States surged by 700 percent. Developments in privatization of prisons continued to progress and by 2003, 44.2% of state prisoners in New Mexico were held in private prison facilities. Other states such as Arizona, Vermont, Connecticut, Alabama, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, Ohio, and Florida also began expanding their private prison contracts. As of 2015, there were 91,300 state inmates and 26,000 federal inmates housed in private prison facilities, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Nationwide, this is 7 percent and 13 percent of inmates, respectively. In late 2016, the Obama Administration issued an executive policy to reduce the number of private federal prison contracts. On August 18, 2016, then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates issued a memorandum that stated: \\"I am directing that, as each contract [with a private prison corporation] reaches the end of its term, the Bureau should either decline to renew that contract or substantially reduce its scope in a manner consistent with the law and the overall decline of the Bureau's inmate population.\\" Less than a month into Donald Trump's presidency, Attorney General Jeff Sessions reversed the Obama Administration policy. The Trump Administration has so far increased immigration enforcement and instituted harsher criminal sentences. Many critics of private prisons argue that prison privatization serves as a large agent for cultivating and feeding into the prison-industrial complex in the United States. John W. Whitehead, constitutional attorney and founder of the Rutherford Institute asserts \\"Prison privatization simply encourages incarceration for the sake of profits, while causing millions of Americans, most of them minor, nonviolent criminals, to be handed over to corporations for lengthy prison sentences which do nothing to protect society or prevent recidivism\\" and argues that it characterizes an increasingly inverted justice system dependent upon an advancement in power and wealth of the corporate state. Private prisons have become a lucrative business, with CCA generating enough revenue that it has become a publicly traded company. Financial institutions have taken notice and are now some of the largest investors in private prisons, including Wells Fargo (which currently has around $6 million invested in CCA), Bank of America, Fidelity Investments, General Electric, and The Vanguard Group. According to a 2010 investigation by the United States Department of Justice, many of the employees and prisoners were exposed to toxic metals from not being sufficiently trained nor were given the resources to handle toxic material. Injury and illness as a result were not reported to appropriate authorities. When investigated, they found that UNICOR, a prison labor program for inmates within the Federal Bureau of Prisons, had attempted to conceal evidence of working conditions from inspectors by cleaning up the production lines before they arrived. In 2010, both the Geo Group and CoreCivic managed contracts with combined revenues amounting to $2.9 billion. In January 2017, both the Geo Group and CoreCivic welcomed the inauguration of President Trump with generous $250,000 donations to his inaugural committee.  The War on Drugs  The War on Drugs has significantly influenced the development of the prison-industrial complex. The policy measures taken to categorize drug abuse as a criminal issue (rather than a health issue as many advocate) have directly sustained the existence of the prison-industrial complex. Since President Reagan institutionalized the War on Drugs in 1980, incarceration rates have tripled. In fact, the Federal Bureau of Prisons reports that drug offense convictions have led to a majority of the US inmate population in federal prisons. Some policy analysts attribute the end of the prison-industrial complex to the lessening of prison sentences for drug usage. Some even call for a total shutdown of the War on Drugs itself and believe that this solution will mitigate the profiting incentives of the prison- industrial complex. =History of the relationship between the War on Drugs and the prison-industrial complex= One of the factors leading to the prison- industrial complex began in New York in 1973. Nelson Rockefeller, the governor of New York at the time, rallied for a stringent crackdown on drugs. Rockefeller essentially set the course of action for the War on Drugs and influenced other states' drug policies. For any illegal drug dealer, even a juvenile, he advocated a life-sentence in prison exempt from parole and plea- bargaining. This led to the Rockefeller Drug Laws which, although not as harsh as Rockefeller had called for, encouraged other states to enact similar laws. The federal government further accelerated incarceration, passing the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act. These laws led to overcrowding in New York prisons. Rockefeller was succeeded as governor by Mario Cuomo. Cuomo was forced to support prison expansion because he was unable to generate enough support to dismantle the drug laws. In order to receive funding for these prisons, Cuomo financed this project to the Urban Development Corporation (a public state agency) which, to the benefit of the state government, could issue state bonds without voter support. The Urban Development Corporation legally owned the prisons and the state ended up selling the Attica prison to the corporation. These events led to the recognition of the ability to gain political capital from privatizing prisons. =Impact of drug offense imprisonment on the prison-industrial complex= Policies initiated due to the War on Drugs have led to prison expansion and consequently allowed the prison-industrial complex to thrive. A study states that \\"The number of persons awaiting trial or serving a sentence for a drug offense in prison or jail has increased from about 40,000 in 1980 to 450,000 today.\\" The significance of creating efficient drug punishment is heightened by the relentless cycle created when imprisoning drug sellers. Even if a drug seller is prosecuted, the drug industry still exists and other sellers take the place of the imprisoned seller. This is described as the \\"replacement effect\\". There is a constant supply of drug sellers and hence, a constant supply of potential prison inmates. The War on Drugs has initiated a perpetual cycle of drug dealing and imprisonment. As a result of these events, in many ways, a domino effect has occurred: tough-on- drug policies led to overcrowding in prisons; this was one of the factors which led to the realization of the profiting gain from prison privatization; and this incentive became one of the factors which eventually led to the system now known as the prison-industrial complex. = War on drugs and racialization of the prison-industrial complex = Critics have stated that the War on Drugs has disproportionately targeted African Americans and as a result has also reinforced the institutionalized racism embedded in the prison-industrial complex. Collected data illustrates that \\"Although the prevalence of illegal drug use among white men is approximately the same as that among black men, black men are five times as likely to be arrested for a drug offense.\\" This racial disparity has led to a prison inmate population with close to a 50% African-American demographic. For further information, see . Economics = Effects = Eric Schlosser wrote an article published in Atlantic Monthly in December 1998 stating that: Schlosser also defined the prison industrial complex as \\"a set of bureaucratic, political, and economic interests that encourage increased spending on imprisonment, regardless of the actual need\\". Hadar Aviram, Professor of Law at UC Hastings, suggests that critics of the prison-industrial complex (PIC) focus too much on private prisons. While Aviram shares their concerns that \\"private enterprises designed to directly benefit from human confinement and misery is profoundly unethical and problematic\\", she claims that \\"the profit incentives that brought private incarceration into existence, rather than private incarceration itself, are to blame for the PIC and its evils\\". In the neoliberal era, she argues, \\"private and public actors alike respond to market pressures and conduct their business, including correctional business, through a cost/benefit prism\\".Hadar Aviram (September 7, 2014). \\"Are Private Prisons to Blame for Mass Incarceration and its Evils?

Retrieved November 14, 2014. = Prison labor = The prison industrial complex has an economic stronghold in its inclusion and participation of private businesses that benefit from the exploitation of the prison labor;Guilbaud, Fabrice. \\"Working in Prison: Time as Experienced by Inmate-Workers\\". Revue fran√ßaise de sociologie 51.5 (2010): 41-68. prison mechanisms remove \\"un-exploitable\\" labor, or so-called \\"underclass\\", from society and redefine it as highly exploitable cheap labor. Scholars using the term \\"prison industrial complex\\" have argued that the trend of \\"hiring out prisoners\\" is a continuation of the slavery tradition. Jobs that are geared toward the prison industry are jobs that require little to no industry-relevant skill, have a large heavy manual labor component and are not high paying jobs. The wages for these jobs Is typically minimum wage, where as the in house prison jobs pay $0.12 to $0.40 per hour. Criminologists have identified that the incarceration is increasing independent of the rate of crime. The use of prisoners for cheap labor while they are serving time ensures that some corporations benefit economically. As the prison population grows, a rising rate of incarceration feeds small and large businesses such as providers of furniture, transportation, food, clothes and medical services, construction and communication firms. Furthermore, the prison system is the third largest employer in the world. Prison activists who dispute the existence of a prison industrial complex have argued that these parties have a great interest in the expansion of the prison system since their development and prosperity directly depends on the number of inmates. They liken the prison industrial complex to any industry that needs more and more raw materials, prisoners being the material. Activists Eve Goldberg and Linda Evans report in Masked Racism: Reflections on the Prison Industrial Complex by Angela Davis that \\"For private business, prison labor is like a pot of gold. No strikes. No union organizing. No health benefits, unemployment insurance, or workers' compensation to pay. No language barriers, as in foreign countries. New leviathan prisons are being built on thousands of eerie acres of factories inside the walls. Prisoners do data entry for Chevron, make telephone reservations for TWA, raise hogs, shovel manure, make circuit boards, limousines, waterbeds, and lingerie for Victoria's Secret -- all at a fraction of the cost of 'free labor'.\\" Corporations, especially those in the technology and food industries, contract prison labor, as it is legal and often completely encouraged by government legislature. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) serves as a federal tax credit that grants employers $2,400 for every work-release employed inmate. \\"Prison insourcing\\" has increasingly grown in popularity as the cheaper alternative to outsourcing with a wide variety of companies such as McDonald's, Target, IBM, Texas Instruments, Boeing, Nordstrom, Intel, Wal-Mart, Victoria's Secret, Aramark, AT&T;, BP, Starbucks, Microsoft, Nike, Honda, Macy's and Sprint and many more actively participating in prison insourcing throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Statistics show that the unemployment rate is correlated to the incarceration rate. The prison system is easily manipulated and geared to help support the most economically advantageous situation. With more prisoners comes more free labor. When having larger privatized prisons makes it cheaper to incarcerate each individual and the only side effect is having more free labor, it is extremely beneficial for companies to essentially rent out their facilities to the state and the government. Private or for profit prisons have an incentive in making decisions in regards to cutting costs while generating a profit. One method for this is using prison inmates as a labor force to perform production work. Advocates of prison labor cite that rehabilitation is promoted through discipline, a strong work ethic, and providing inmates with valuable skills to be used upon release.Morrell, Alythea S., \\"Incentives to Incarcerate: Corporation Involvement in Prison Labor and the Privatization of the Prison System\\" (2015). Master's Projects. Paper 263. Gina Honeycutt, executive director of the National Correctional Industries Association stated, \\"Many offenders have never worked a legal job and need to learn the basics like showing up on time, listening to a supervisor and working as part of a team.\\" Studies have also shown that participants in prison labor programs often have a lower risk of recidivism, showing that graduates of the program are less likely to be repeat offenders on average. Honeycutt also stated, \\"In recent years, the focus of many work programs has shifted to concentrate even more on effective rehabilitation of inmates. The transition in the last five years has been away from producing a product to producing a successful offender as our product.\\" Cynthia Young states that prison labor is an \\"employers' paradise\\". Prison labor can soon deprive the free labor of jobs in a number of sectors, since the organized labor turns out to be un-competitive compared to the prison counterpart, attributed to the crowding-out effect. Journalist Jonathan Kay in the National Post defined the \\"prison industrial complex\\" as a \\"corrupt human-warehousing operation that combines the worst qualities of government (its power to coerce) and private enterprise (greed)\\". He states that inmates are kept in inhumane conditions and that the need to preserve the economic advantage of a full prison leads prison leaders to thwart any effort or reforms that might reduce recidivism and incarcerations.Private prison stock prices from 2002 to 2012. = Investments = In a Bureau of Prisons (BOP) funded study by Doug McDonald. and Scott Camp, known as the \\"Taft Studies\\", privatized prisons were compared side-to-side with the public prisons on economic, performance, and quality of life for the prisoner scales. The study found that in a trade off for allowing prisons to be more cheaply run and operated, the degree to which prisoners are reformed goes down. Because the privatized prisons are so much larger than the public-run prisons, they were subject to economies of scale. Privatized prisons run on business models, promoting more an efficient, accountable, lower cost alternative to decrease government spending on incarceration. In 2011, The Vera Institute of Justice surveyed 40 state correction departments to gather data on what the true cost of prisons were. Their reports showed that most states had additional costs ranging from one percent to thirty-four percent outside of what their original budget was for that year. In 2016, during President Obama's administration private prisons were on the decline, as they were considered more expensive and less safe than government-run facilities. Former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates stated, \\"Private prisons simply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs, and resources; they do not save substantially on costs; and as noted in a recent report by the Department's Office of Inspector General, they do not maintain the same level of safety and security.\\" Private prison stocks were at their lowest point since 2008 and on August 18, 2016, the United States Justice Department noticed a declining reliance on private prisons and was developing a plan to phase out its use of private prisons. The stock prices of the largest private prison operations, CoreCivic and Geo Group, skyrocketed in 2016 following the election of President Trump, with CoreCivic experiencing a 140% increase and Geo Group rising 98%. Attorney General Jeff Sessions stated in a February 21, 2017 memo that the Obama administration had \\"impaired the U.S. Bureau of Prison's ability to meet the future needs of the correctional system\\" and rescinded the Obama directive that would curtail the government use of private prisons. In 2017, CNN attributed this rise of private prison stock to President Trump's commitment to lowering crime and toughening immigration, translating to more individuals to be arrested, therefore leading to an increase of private prison profits. Both companies donated heavily to the Trump election campaign in 2016. Immigration Funding of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is increasing as about a total of $4.27 billion was allotted to the INS in the 2000 fiscal budget. This is 8% more than in the 1999 fiscal budget. This expansion, experts claim, has been too rapid and thus has led to an increased chance on the part of faculty for negligence and abuse. Lucas Guttengag, director of the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project stated that, \\"immigrants awaiting administrative hearings are being detained in conditions that would be unacceptable at prisons for criminal offenders\\". Such examples include \\"travelers without visas\\" (TWOVs) being held in motels near airports nicknamed \\"Motel Kafkas\\" that are under the jurisdiction of private security officers who have no affiliation to the government, often denying them telephones or fresh air, and there are some cases where detainees have been shackled and sexually abused according to Guttengag. Similar conditions arose in the ESMOR detention center at Elizabeth, New Jersey where complaints arose in less than a year, despite having a \\"state-of-the-art\\" facility. The number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. is 11.3 million. Those that argue against the PIC claim that effective immigration policy has failed to pass since private detention centers profit from keeping undocumented immigrants detained. They also claim that despite having the incarceration rate grow \\"10 times what it was prior to 1970\\", \\"it has not made this country any safer\\"' Since the September 11 attacks in 2001, the budget for Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), have nearly doubled from 2003 to 2008, with CBP's budget increasing from $5.8 billion to $10.1 billion and ICE from $3.2 billion to $5 billion and even so there has been no significant decrease in immigrant population. Professor Wayne Cornelius, professor Emeritus of Political Science at UC San Diego, even argued that it is so ineffective that \\"92‚Äì97%\\" of immigrants who attempt to cross in illegally \\"keep trying until they succeed\\", and that such measures actually increase the risk and cost of travel, leading to longer stays and settlement in the US. There are around 400,000 immigrant detainees per year, and 50% are housed in private facilities. In 2011, CCA's net worth was $1.4 billion and net income was $162 million. In this same year, The GEO Group had a net worth of $1.2 billion and net income of $78 million. As of 2012, CCA has over 75,000 inmates within 60 facilities and the GEO Group owns over 114 facilities. Over half of the prison industry's yearly revenue comes from immigrant detention centers. For some small communities in the Southwestern United States, these facilities serve as an integral part of the economy.Chris Kirkham (7 June 2012).

According to Chris Kirkham, this constitutes part of a growing immigration industrial complex: \\"Companies dependent upon continued growth in the numbers of undocumented immigrants detained have exerted themselves in the nation's capital and in small, rural communities to create incentives that reinforce that growth.\\" A study by the ACLU says that many are housed in inhumane conditions as many facilities operated by private companies are exempt from government oversight, and studies are made difficult as such facilities may not be covered by a Freedom of Information Act.Evan Hill (June 10, 2014). \\"Immigrants mistreated in 'inhumane' private prisons, finds report\\". Al Jazeera America. Retrieved February 15, 2015. In 2009, University of Kansas professor Tanya Golash-Boza coined the term, \\"Immigration Industrial Complex\\", defining it as \\"the confluence of public and private sector interests in the criminalization of undocumented migration, immigration law enforcement, and the promotion of 'anti-illegal' rhetoric\\", in her paper \\"The Immigration Industrial Complex: Why We Enforce Immigration Policies Destined to Fail\\". In 2009, congressional immigration detention policies requires that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) maintain 34,000 immigration detention beds daily. This immigration bed quota has steadily increased with each passing year, costing ICE around $159 to detain one individual for one day. In 2010, immigration detention policies implemented by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) benefited the two major private prison corporations CCA and GeoGroup, increasing their share of immigrant detention beds by 13%. Compared to data from 2009, the percentage of ICE immigrant detention beds in the United States are owned and operated by private for-profit prison corporations has increased by 49%, with CCA and GeoGroup operating 8 out of 10 of the largest facilities. Although the combined revenues of CCA and GEO Group were about $4 billion in 2017 from private prison contracts, their number one customer was ICE.  Impact and response  = Women = A graph of the US incarceration rate under state and federal jurisdiction per 100,000 population 1925‚Äì2008 (omits local jail inmates). The male incarceration rate (top line) is 15 times the female rate (bottom line). In 1994, UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women was released which stated that \\"Among many other abuses women prisoners have identified, are pat searches (male guards pat searching and groping women), illegal strip searches (male guards observing strip searches of women), constant lewd comments and gestures, violations of their right to privacy (male guards watching women in showers and toilets), and in some instances, sexual assault and rape.\\" International human rights standards reinforce this by stating \\"the rape of a women in custody is an act of torture\\".Davis, Angela Y., Shaylor, Cassandra. \\"Race, Gender, and the Prison Industrial Complex California and Beyond\\".

Vol. 18 (2003) 40.Complementary Index. Web. Nov 1. 2017 In regards to women and the prison-industrial complex, Angela Davis stated that \\"State- sanctioned punishment is informed by patriarchal structures and ideologies that have tended to produce historical assumptions of female criminality linked to ideas about the violation of social norms defining a 'woman‚Äôs place'. Considering the fact that as many as half of all women are assaulted by their husbands or partners combined with dramatically rising numbers of women sentenced to prison, it may be argued that women in general are subjected to a far greater magnitude of punishment than men.\\" She also suggested that the \\"historical and philosophical connections between domestic violence and imprisonment [comprise] two modes of gendered punishment ‚Äì one located in the private realm, the other in the public realm\\". Angela Davis continues to argue: \\"the sexual abuse of women in prison is one of the most heinous state-sanctioned human rights violations within the United States today. Women prisoners represent one of the most disenfranchised and invisible adult populations in our society. The absolute power and control the state exercises over their lives both stems from and perpetuates the patriarchal and racist structures that, for centuries, have resulted in the social domination of women.\\" According to Angela Davis and Cassandra Shaylor in their research entitled \\"Race, Gender, and the Prison-Industrial Complex\\", most women in prison experience some degree of depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. Very often they are neither diagnosed nor treated, with injurious consequences for their mental health in and out of prison. Many women report that when requesting counseling, they are offered psychotropic medications instead. As technologies of imprisonment become increasingly repressive and practices of isolation become increasingly routine, mentally ill women often are placed in solitary confinement, which can only exacerbate their condition. = Minorities = US homicide victims by race, 1980‚Äì2008 US homicide convictions by race, 1980‚Äì2008 70 percent of the United States prison population is composed of racial minorities. Due to a variety of factors, different ethnic groups have different rates of offending, arrest, prosecution, conviction and incarceration. In terms of percentage of ethnic populations, in descending order, the U.S. incarcerates more Native Americans, African Americans, followed by Hispanics, Whites, and finally Asians. Native Americans are the largest group incarcerated per capita. = Response = A 2014 report by the American Friends Service Committee, Grassroots Leadership, and the Southern Center for Human Rights claims that recent reductions in the number of people incarcerated has pushed the prison industry into areas previously served by non-profit behavioral health and treatment-oriented agencies, referring to it as the \\"Treatment Industrial Complex\\", which \\"has the potential to ensnare more individuals, under increased levels of supervision and surveillance, for increasing lengths of time ‚Äì in some cases, for the rest of a person's life\\".Michael King (November 24, 2014).

Heitzeg (February 24, 2015). \\"Bipartisan\\" Criminal Justice Reform: A Misguided Merger. Truthout. Retrieved March 13, 2015. Sociologist Lo√Øc Wacquant of UC Berkeley is also dismissive of the term for sounding too conspiratorial and for overstating its scope and effect. However Bernard Harcourt, Professor of Law at Columbia University, considers the term useful insofar as \\"it highlights the profitability of prison building and the employment boom associated with prison guard labor. There is no question that the prison expansion served the financial interests of large sectors of the economy.\\" Another writer of the era who covered the expanding prison population and attacked \\"the prison industrial complex\\" was Christian Parenti, who later disavowed the term before the publication of his book, Lockdown America (2000). \\"How, then, should the left critique the prison buildup?\\" asked The Nation in 1999: Prisons in the U.S. are becoming the primary response to mental illness among poor people. The institutionalization of mentally ill people, historically, has been used more often against women than against men.  Reform  = Prison abolition movement = A response to the prison industrial complex is the prison abolition movement. The goal of prison abolition is to end the prison industrial complex by eliminating prisons. Prison abolitionists aim to do this by changing the socioeconomic conditions of the communities that are affected the most by the prison- industrial complex. They propose increasing funding of social programs in order to lower the rate of crimes, and therefore eventually end the need for police and prisons.  Alternatives to detention  Due to the overcrowding in prisons and detention centers by for-profit corporations, organizations such as Amnesty International, propose using alternatives such as reporting requirements, bonds, or the use of monitoring technologies. The questions often brought up with alternatives include whether they are effective or efficient. A study published by the Vera Institute attempts to answer this question by stating that when alternatives such as monitoring technologies were used, they found that 91% of the individuals appeared at their court date. The Institute recorded that the relative cost of using such alternatives has been estimated at $12 per day a relatively low price in comparison to the reported average cost of incarceration in the U.S., which has been priced at roughly $87.61 per day. Despite the relative efficiency and effectiveness of alternative to detention, there is still much debate that these alternatives will not change the dynamics of incarceration. This argument lies in the fact that major corporations such as the GEO Group and Corrections Corporations of America will still be profiting by simply re- branding and moving towards rehabilitation services and monitoring technologies. Rather than effectively ending and finding a solution to the PIC, more people will simply find themselves imprisoned by another system. Other opposition to alternatives comes from the public. According to Ezzat Fattah, opposition towards prison alternatives and correctional facilities is due to the public fearing having that having these facilities in their neighborhoods will threaten the security and integrity of their communities and children.  Critical Resistance  The movement gained momentum in 1997, when a group of prison abolition activists, scholars, and former prisoners collaborated to organize a three-day conference to examine the prison-industrial complex in the U.S. The conference, Critical Resistance to the prison-industrial complex, was held in September 1998 at the University of California, Berkeley and was attended by over 3,500 people of diverse academic, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds. Two years after the conference, a political grassroots organization was founded bearing the same name with the mission to challenge and dismantle the prison-industrial complex. In 2001, the organization adopted a national structure with local chapters in Portland, Los Angeles, Oakland, and New York City to develop campaigns and projects working towards abolishing the prison industrial complex. Currently, the cause has shifted towards supporting efforts towards resisting state repression and developing tools to re-imagine life without the prison industrial complex. In 2010, at the U.S. Social Forum, committed activists joined together to discuss prison justice and stated that \\"Because we share a vision of justice and solidarity against confinement, control, and all forms of political repression, the prison industrial complex must be abolished.\\" Following the forum, the rise of Formerly Incarcerated, Convicted People's Movement helped to incorporate abolition into other movements such as Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and the Movement for Black Lives. = School-to-prison pipeline reform = A competing explanation for the disproportionate arrest and incarceration of people of color and persons with lower socioeconomic status is the school-to-prison pipeline, which generally proposes that practices in public schools (such as zero-tolerance policies, police in schools, and high-stakes testing) are direct causes of students dropping out of school and, subsequently, committing crimes which lead to their being arrested. 68% of state prisoners had not completed high school in 1997, including 70 percent of women state prisoners. Suspension, expulsion, and being held back during middle school years are the largest predictors of arrest for adolescent women. The school-to-prison pipeline disproportionately affects young black men with an overall incarceration risk that is six to eight times higher than young whites. Black male high school dropouts experienced a 60% risk of imprisonment as of 1999. There is a recent trend of authors describing the school-to-prison pipeline as feeding into the prison- industrial complex. Since the shortcomings of zero-tolerance discipline have grown very clear, there has been a widespread movement to support reform across school districts and states. Growing research that shows suspensions, especially for minor infractions and misbehavior, are a flawed disciplinary response has encouraged many districts to adopt new disciplinary alternatives. In 2015, mayor of New York City Bill de Blasio joined with the Department of Education to address school discipline in a campaign to tweak the old policies. Blasio also spearheaded a leadership team on school climate and discipline to take recommendations and craft the foundations for more substantive policy. The team released recommendations that work towards reducing the racial disparity in suspension and discussing the underlying root cause of disciplinary infractions through restorative justice.

Biography Biggs was born in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, England; a year later, the family moved to the Isle of Wight. Biggs was trained in London at the Royal Academy of Music, where he studied with G. D. Cunningham. Biggs immigrated to the United States in 1930. In 1932, he took up a post at Christ Church in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he lived for the rest of his life. Biggs did much to bring the classical pipe organ back to prominence, and was in the forefront of the mid-20th-century resurgence of interest in the organ music of pre-Romantic composers. On his first concert tour of Europe, in 1954, Biggs performed and recorded works of Johann Sebastian Bach, Sweelinck, Dieterich Buxtehude, and Pachelbel on historic organs associated with those composers. Thereafter, he believed that such music should ideally be performed on instruments representative of that period and that organ music of that epoch should be played by using (as closely as possible) the styles and registrations of that era. Thus, he sparked the American revival of organ building in the style of European Baroque instruments, seen especially in the increasing popularity of tracker organs‚Äîanalogous to Europe's Orgelbewegung.Barbara Owen, E. Power Biggs: Concert Organist, Indiana University Press (1987) Among other instruments, Biggs championed G. Donald Harrison's Baroque-style unenclosed, unencased instrument with 24 stops and electric action (produced by Aeolian- Skinner in 1937 and installed in Harvard's Busch-Reisinger Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts) and the three-manual Flentrop tracker organ subsequently installed there in 1958. Many of his CBS radio broadcasts and Columbia recordings were made in the museum. Another remarkable instrument used by Biggs was the John Challis pedal harpsichord; Biggs made recordings of the music of J. S. Bach and Scott Joplin on this instrument. Biggs' critics of the time included rival concert organist Virgil Fox, who was known for a more flamboyant and colorful style of performance. Fox decried Biggs' insistence on historical accuracy, claiming that it was \\"relegating the organ to a museum piece\\". However, many observers agree that Biggs \\"should be given great credit for his innovative ideas as far as the musical material he recorded, and for making the organs he recorded even more famous.\\"Richard Torrence, Virgil Fox: The Dish, Circles International (2005) Despite different approaches, both artists enjoyed hugely successful careers and Biggs rose to the top of his profession. In addition to concerts and recording, Biggs taught at the Longy School of Music in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at various times in his career and edited a large body of organ music. Biggs was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1950. For his contribution to the recording industry, Biggs has a star on California's Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6522 Hollywood Boulevard. Selected discography Biggs recorded extensively for the Columbia Masterworks Records and RCA Victor labels for more than three decades. Between 1942 and 1958, he also hosted a weekly radio program of organ music (carried throughout the United States on the CBS Radio Network) that introduced audiences to the pipe organ and its literature. * Works for Organ: Essential Classics (1961) * Bach: Organ Favorites recorded on the Flentrop Organ in the Busch-Reisinger Museum of Harvard University, MS 6261 (1961) * The Golden Age of the Organ, Columbia Masterworks M2S 697 (A tribute to German organ builder Arp Schnitger), organs in Germany and the Netherlands (1963) * Bach Organ Favorites, Vol. 2, Columbia Masterworks MS 6748 (1965) * Mozart: The Music for Solo Organ‚ÄîPlayed on the \\"Mozart\\" organ at Haarlem, Columbia Masterworks MS 6856 (1966) * Bach Organ Favorites, Vol. 3, Columbia Masterworks MS 7108 (1968) * E.

History =Early years= Space Twins was founded in 1993 by Weezer guitarist Brian Bell and, his then girlfriend, Susan Fox. Initially, the band was a small project in which the two would dress up in Star Trek style outfits with pipe-cleaner antennae, playing silly songs at kids' birthday parties. The duo even had nicknames for one another: SpaceHelmet and Moonboot. =The addition of Tim (Timothy Maloof), Glenn and Mike= In 1996, the project became more serious, and Bell was joined by high school friends, Tim and Glenn Maloof. Bell also brought Mike Elliot into the fold, and, thus, a new Space Twins line-up was solidified. The quartet developed a unique sound that blends modern indie rock with progressive and psychedelic elements. In Weezer's down- time, the band released two limited-edition 7\\" singles: \\"Osaka Aquabus\\" (1997) and \\"TV, Music & Candy\\" (1998). Both of these sold out quickly and are no longer in print. =The End of Imagining= In May 2003, the Space Twins independently released their debut album, The End of Imagining, on their own label Raga Drop Records. The album was critically acclaimed, with Rolling Stone critic John D. Luerresen naming the album 7th best of 2003. The album, like the band's previous releases, is out of print and remains sought after by many Weezer fans. The band performed at the 2003 SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. =Current status= In May 2005, a message appeared on the band's official website: \\"Yesterday the Space Twins jammed. It was much fun.

The term susceptance does not appear anywhere in Heaviside's collected works, and he used the term permittance to mean capacitance, not susceptance.Ido Yavetz, From Obscurity to Enigma: The Work of Oliver Heaviside, 1872‚Äì1889, Springer, 2011 . Formula The general equation defining admittance is given by :Y = G + j B \\\\, where, : is the complex admittance, measured in siemens. : is the real-valued conductance, measured in siemens. : is the imaginary unit (i.e. ), and : is the real-valued susceptance, measured in siemens. The admittance () is the reciprocal of the impedance (), if the impedance is not zero: :Y = \\\\frac{1}{Z} = \\\\frac{1}{R + j X} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{R}{\\\\;R^2+X^2} \\\\right) + j \\\\left( \\\\frac{-X\\\\;\\\\;}{\\\\;R^2+X^2} \\\\right) \\\\, and :B = \\\\operatorname{Im}(Y) = \\\\frac{-X\\\\;}{\\\\;R^2+X^2} = \\\\frac{-X~\\\\;}{~\\\\;\\\\left Z \\\\right^2} where :Z = R + j X \\\\, : is the complex impedance, measured in ohms : is the real-valued resistance, measured in ohms : is the real-valued reactance, measured in ohms. The susceptance B is the imaginary part of the admittance Y. The magnitude of admittance is given by: :\\\\left Y \\\\right = \\\\sqrt{G^2 + B^2\\\\;} \\\\, And similar formulas transform admittance into impedance, hence susceptance () into reactance (): :Z = \\\\frac{1}{Y} = \\\\frac{1}{G + j B} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{G}{\\\\;G^2+B^2} \\\\right) + j \\\\left( \\\\frac{-B\\\\;\\\\;}{\\\\;G^2+B^2} \\\\right) \\\\, hence :X = \\\\operatorname{Im}(Z) =\\\\frac{-B\\\\;}{\\\\;G^2+B^2} = \\\\frac{-B~\\\\;}{~\\\\;\\\\left Y \\\\right^2}. The reactance and susceptance are only reciprocals in the absence of either resistance or conductance (only if either or , either of which implies the other, if or equivalently ).  Relation to capacitance  In electronic and semiconductor devices, transient or frequency-dependent current between terminals contains both conduction and displacement components. Conduction current is related to moving charge carriers (electrons, holes, ions, etc.), while displacement current is caused by time-varying electric field. Carrier transport is affected by electric field and by a number of physical phenomena, such as carrier drift and diffusion, trapping, injection, contact-related effects, and impact ionization. As a result, device admittance is frequency-dependent, and the simple electrostatic formula for capacitance, C = \\\\frac{q}{V}, is not applicable. A more general definition of capacitance, encompassing electrostatic formula, is: : C = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{Im}(Y)}{\\\\omega} \\\\, , where Y is the device admittance, evaluated at the angular frequency in question, and \\\\omega is the angular frequency. It is common for electrical components to have slightly reduced capacitances at extreme frequencies, due to slight inductance of conductors used to make capacitors (not just the leads), and permittivity changes in insulating materials with frequency: is very nearly, but not quite a constant. Relationship to reactance Reactance is defined as the imaginary part of electrical impedance, and is analogous but not generally equal to the reciprocal of the susceptance. However, for purely- reactive impedances (which are purely-susceptive admittances), the susceptance is equal to negative the inverse of the reactance. In mathematical notation: :G = 0 \\\\iff R = 0 \\\\iff B = -\\\\frac{1}{X} The negation is not present in the relationship between electrical resistance and the analogue of conductance G, which equals \\\\operatorname{Re}(Y). :B = 0 \\\\iff X = 0 \\\\iff G = \\\\frac{1}{R} If the imaginary unit is included, we get : jB = \\\\frac{1}{jX}~, for the resistance-free case since, : { 1 \\\\over j} = -j \\\\ . Applications High susceptance materials are used in susceptors built into microwavable food packaging for their ability to convert microwave radiation into heat.

The first voting machines were mechanical but it is increasingly more common to use electronic voting machines. Traditionally, a voting machine has been defined by its mechanism, and whether the system tallies votes at each voting location, or centrally. Voting machines differ in usability, security, cost, speed, accuracy, and ability of the public to oversee elections. Machines may be more or less accessible to voters with different disabilities. Tallies are simplest in parliamentary systems where just one choice is on the ballot, and these are often tallied manually. In other political systems where many choices are on the same ballot, tallies are often done by machines to give quick results. Historical machines In Ancient Athens (5th and 4th Centuries BCE) voting was done by different colored pebbles deposited in urns, and later by bronze markers created by the state and officially stamped. This procedure served for elected positions, jury procedures, and ostracisms.https://www.ascsa.edu.gr/uploads/media/hesperia/147360.pdf The first use of paper ballots was in Rome in 139 BCE, and their first use in the United States was in 1629 to select a pastor for the Salem Church.Jones, Douglas W.. A Brief Illustrated History of Voting. THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA Department of Computer Science. =Mechanical voting= Balls The first major proposal for the use of voting machines came from the Chartists in 1838.Douglas W. Jones, Early Requirements for Mechanical Voting Systems, First International Workshop on Requirements Engineering for E-voting Systems, Aug. 31, 2009, Atlanta. (author's copy). Among the radical reforms called for in The People's Charter were universal suffrage and voting by secret ballot. This required major changes in the conduct of elections, and as responsible reformers, the Chartists not only demanded reforms but described how to accomplish them, publishing Schedule A, a description of how to run a polling place, and Schedule B, a description of a voting machine to be used in such a polling place.The People's Charter with the Address to the Radical Reformers of Great Britain and Ireland and a Brief Sketch of its Origin Elt and Fox, London, 1848; obverse of title page.The People's Charter 1839 Edition, in the radicalism collection of the University of Aberdeen. The Chartist voting machine, attributed to Benjamin Jolly of 19 York Street in Bath, allowed each voter to cast one vote in a single race. This matched the requirements of a British parliamentary election. Each voter was to cast his vote by dropping a brass ball into the appropriate hole in the top of the machine by the candidate's name. Each voter could only vote once because each voter was given just one brass ball. The ball advanced a clockwork counter for the corresponding candidate as it passed through the machine, and then fell out the front where it could be given to the next voter. Buttons In 1875, Henry Spratt of Kent received a U.S. patent for a voting machine that presented the ballot as an array of push buttons, one per candidate.H. W. Spratt, Improvement in Voting Apparatus, , Jan 12. 1875. Spratt's machine was designed for a typical British election with a single plurality race on the ballot. In 1881, Anthony Beranek of Chicago patented the first voting machine appropriate for use in a general election in the United States.A. C. Beranek, Voting Apparatus, g, Oct. 11, 1881. Beranek's machine presented an array of push buttons to the voter, with one row per office on the ballot, and one column per party. Interlocks behind each row prevented voting for more than one candidate per race, and an interlock with the door of the voting booth reset the machine for the next voter as each voter left the booth. Tokens The psephograph was patented by Italian inventor Eugenio Boggiano in 1907. It worked by dropping a metal token into one of several labeled slots. The psephograph would automatically tally the total tokens deposited in each slot. The psephograph was first used in a theatre in Rome, where it was used to gauge audience reception to a play: \\"good\\", \\"bad\\", or \\"indifferent\\". Analog computers Lenna Winslow's 1910 voting machine was designed to offer all the questions on the ballot to men and only some to women because women often had partial suffrage, e.g. being allowed to vote on issues but not candidates. The machine had two doors, one marked \\"Gents\\" and the other marked \\"Ladies\\". The door used to enter the voting booth would activate a series of levers and switches to display the full ballot for men and the partial ballot for women.Lenna Winslow, , which drew from her earlier voting machine designs. Dials By July 1936, IBM had mechanized voting and ballot tabulation for single transferable vote elections. Using a series of dials, the voter could record up to twenty ranked preferences to a punched card, one preference at a time. Write-in votes were permitted. The machine prevented a voter from spoiling their ballot by skipping rankings and by giving the same ranking to more than one candidate. A standard punched-card counting machine would tabulate ballots at a rate of 400 per minute. Demo version of lever style voting machine on display at the National Museum of American History Levers Lever machines were commonly used in the United States until the 1990s. In 1889, Jacob H. Myers of Rochester, New York, received a patent for a voting machine that was based on Beranek's 1881 push button machine.Jacob H. Myers, Voting Machine, , Nov. 19, 1889. This machine saw its first use in Lockport, New York, in 1892.Republicans Carry Lockport; The New Voting Machine Submitted to a Practical Test, in the New York Times, Wed. Apr. 13, 1892; page 1. In 1894, Sylvanus Davis added a straight-party lever and significantly simplified the interlocking mechanism used to enforce the vote-for-one rule in each race.S. E. Davis, Voting Machine, , Sept. 25, 1894. By 1899, Alfred Gillespie introduced several refinements. It was Gillespie who replaced the heavy metal voting booth with a curtain that was linked to the cast-vote lever, and Gillespie introduced the lever by each candidate name that was turned to point to that name in order to cast a vote for that candidate. Inside the machine, Gillespie worked out how to make the machine programmable so that it could support races in which voters were allowed to vote for, for example, 3 out of 5 candidates.A. J. Gillespie, Voting-Machine, , July 11, 1899. On December 14, 1900, the U.S. Standard Voting Machine Company was formed, with Alfred Gillespie as one of its directors, to combine the companies that held the Myers, Davis, and Gillespie patents.The Manual of Statistics: Stock Exchange Hand-book, 1903, The Manual of Statistics Company, New York, 1903; page 773. By the 1920s, this company (under various names) had a monopoly on voting machines, until, in 1936, Samuel and Ransom Shoup obtained a patent for a competing voting machine.Samuel R. Shoup and Ransom F. Shoup, Voting Machine, , Sept. 15, 1936. By 1934, about a sixth of all presidential ballots were being cast on mechanical voting machines, essentially all made by the same manufacturer.Joseph Harris, Voting Machines, Chapter VII of Election Administration in the United States, Brookings, 1934; pages 249 and 279‚Äì280. Commonly, a voter enters the machine and pulls a lever to close the curtain, thus unlocking the voting levers. The voter then makes his or her selection from an array of small voting levers denoting the appropriate candidates or measures. The machine is configured to prevent overvotes by locking out other candidates when one candidate's lever is turned down. When the voter is finished, a lever is pulled which opens the curtain and increments the appropriate counters for each candidate and measure. At the close of the election, the results are hand copied by the precinct officer, although some machines could automatically print the totals. New York was the last state to stop using these machines, under court order, by the fall of 2009.\\"Lever voting machines get a reprieve in NY\\", Press & Sun-Bulletin (Binghamton, New York), August 10, 2007Ian Urbina. States Prepare for Tests of Changes to Voting System, New York Times, 5 Feb 2008 =Punched card voting= The Votomatic vote recorder, a punched card voting machine originally developed in the mid-1960s. Punched card systems employ a card (or cards) and a small clipboard-sized device for recording votes. Voters punch holes in the cards with a ballot marking device. Typical ballot marking devices carry a ballot label that identifies the candidates or issues associated with each punching position on the card, although in some cases, the names and issues are printed directly on the card. After voting, the voter may place the ballot in a ballot box, or the ballot may be fed into a computer vote tabulating device at the precinct. The idea of voting by punching holes on paper or cards originated in the 1890sKennedy Dougan, Ballot-Holder, , Nov. 11, 1890. and inventors continued to explore this in the years that followed. By the late 1890s John McTammany's voting machine was used widely in several states. In this machine, votes were recorded by punching holes in a roll of paper comparable to those used in player pianos, and then tabulated after the polls closed using a pneumatic mechanism. Punched-card voting was proposed occasionally in the mid-20th century,Fred M. Carroll (IBM), Voting Machine, , Apr. 2, 1940. but the first major success for punched-card voting came in 1965, with Joseph P. Harris' development of the Votomatic punched-card system.Joseph P. Harris, Data Registering Device, , Aug. 17, 1965.Joseph P. Harris, Data Registering Device, , Mar. 15, 1966.Harris, Joseph P. (1980) Professor and Practitioner: Government, Election Reform, and the Votomatic, Bancroft Library This was based on IBM's Port-A-Punch technology. Harris licensed the Votomatic to IBM.IBM Archive: Votomatic William Rouverol built the prototype system. The Votomatic system was very successful. By the 1996 Presidential election, some variation of the punched card system was used by 37.3% of registered voters in the United States.\\"Punchcards, a definition \\". Federal Election Commission Votomatic style systems and punched cards received considerable notoriety in 2000 when their uneven use in Florida was alleged to have affected the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. Current voting machines =Optical scan (marksense)= Counting ballots by an optical scanner, San Jose, California, 2018 In an optical scan voting system, or marksense, each voter's choices are marked on one or more pieces of paper, which then go through a scanner. The scanner creates an electronic image of each ballot, interprets it, creates a tally for each candidate, and usually stores the image for later review. The voter may mark the paper directly, usually in a specific location for each candidate. Or the voter may select choices on an electronic screen, which then prints the chosen names, and a bar code or QR code summarizing all choices, on a sheet of paper to put in the scanner. Hundreds of errors in optical scan systems have been found, from feeding ballots upside down, multiple ballots pulled through at once in central counts, paper jams, broken, blocked or overheated sensors which misinterpret some or many ballots, printing which does not align with the programming, programming errors, and loss of files. The cause of each programming error is rarely found, so it is not known how many were accidental or intentional. =Direct-recording electronic (DRE)= DRE with paper for voter to verify (VVPAT) In a DRE voting machine system, a touch screen displays choices to the voter, who selects choices, and can change her mind as often as needed, before casting the vote. Staff initialize each voter once on the machine, to avoid repeat voting. Voting data are recorded in memory components, and can be copied out at the end of the election. Some of these machines also print names of chosen candidates on paper for the voter to verify, though less than 40% verify. These names on paper are kept behind glass in the machine, and can be used for election audits and recounts if needed. The tally of the voting data is printed on the end of the paper tape. The paper tape is called a Voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT). The VVPATs can be tallied at 20-43 seconds of staff time per vote (not per ballot). For machines without VVPAT, there is no record of individual votes to check. For machines with VVPAT, checking is more expensive than with paper ballots, because on the flimsy thermal paper in a long continuous roll, staff often lose their place, and the printout has each change by each voter, not just their final decisions. Problems have included public web access to the software, before it is loaded into machines for each election, and programming errors which increment different candidates than voters select. The Federal Constitutional Court of Germany found that with existing machines could not be allowed because they could not be monitored by the public.German Federal Constitutional Court, Press release no. 19/2009 of 3 March 2009 Successful hacks have been demonstrated under laboratory conditions.Security Analysis of the Diebold AccuVote-TS Voting MachineNedap/Groenendaal ES3B voting computer, a security analysisDutch citizens group cracks Nedap's voting computer Use of SDU voting computers banned during Dutch general elections (Heise.de, 31. October 2006) Location of tallying Optical scans can be done either at the place of voting,\\"precinct\\", or in another location. DRE machines always tally at the precinct. =Precinct-count voting system= A precinct-count voting system is a voting system that tallies ballots at the polling place. Precinct-count machines typically analyze ballots as they are cast. This approach allows for voters to be notified of voting errors such as overvotes and can prevent spoilt votes. After the voter has a chance to correct any errors, the precinct-count machine tallies that ballot. Vote totals are made public only after the close of polling. DREs and precinct scanners have electronic storage of the vote tallies and may transmit results to a central location over public telecommunication networks. =Central-count voting system= A medium-speed central-count , the DS450 made by can scan and sort about 4000 ballots per hour. A central count voting system is a voting system that tallies ballots from multiple precincts at a central location. Central count systems are also commonly used to process absentee ballots. Central counting can be done by hand, and in some jurisdictions, central counting is done using the same type of voting machine deployed at polling places, but since the introduction of the Votomatic punched-card voting system and the Norden Electronic Vote Tallying System in the 1960s, high speed ballot tabulators have been in widespread use, particularly in large metropolitan jurisdictions. Today, commodity high-speed scanners sometimes serve this purpose, but special- purpose ballot scanners are also available that incorporate sorting mechanisms to separate tallied ballots from those requiring human interpretation.Douglas W. Jones and Barbara Simons, Broken Ballots, CSLI Publications, 2012; see Section 4.1 Central-Count Machines, pages 64-65, and Figure 21, page 73. Voted ballots are typically placed into secure ballot boxes at the polling place. Stored ballots and/or Precinct Counts are transported or transmitted to a central counting location. The system produces a printed report of the vote count, and may produce a report stored on electronic media suitable for broadcasting, or release on the Internet.

The sole member of the genus Aepyceros, it was first described to European audiences by German zoologist Hinrich Lichtenstein in 1812. Two subspecies are recognised‚Äîthe common impala, and the larger and darker black-faced impala. The impala reaches at the shoulder and weighs . It features a glossy, reddish brown coat. The male's slender, lyre-shaped horns are long. Active mainly during the day, the impala may be gregarious or territorial depending upon the climate and geography. Three distinct social groups can be observed: the territorial males, bachelor herds and female herds. The impala is known for two characteristic leaps that constitute an anti-predator strategy. Browsers as well as grazers, impala feed on monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits and acacia pods (whenever available). An annual, three- week-long rut takes place toward the end of the wet season, typically in May. Rutting males fight over dominance, and the victorious male courts female in oestrus. Gestation lasts six to seven months, following which a single calf is born and immediately concealed in cover. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males‚Äîforced out of the all-female groups‚Äîjoin bachelor herds, while females may stay back. The impala is found in woodlands and sometimes on the interface (ecotone) between woodlands and savannahs; it inhabits places close to water. While the black-faced impala is confined to southwestern Angola and Kaokoland in northwestern Namibia, the common impala is widespread across its range and has been reintroduced in Gabon and southern Africa. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies the impala as a species of least concern; the black-faced subspecies has been classified as a vulnerable species, with less than 1,000 individuals remaining in the wild as of 2008. Etymology The first attested English name, in 1802, was palla or pallah, from the Tswana ' 'red antelope';Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd edition, March 2005, s.v. pallah the name impala, also spelled impalla or mpala, is first attested in 1875.Oxford English Dictionary Supp., 1933, s.v. Its Afrikaans name, ' 'red buck', is also sometimes used in English.Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd edition, November 2010, s.v. The scientific generic name Aepyceros ( ‚Äòhigh-horned‚Äô) comes from Ancient Greek (', 'high, steep') + (', 'horn'); the specific name melampus ( ‚Äòblack-foot‚Äô) from (', 'black') + (', 'foot'). Taxonomy and development The impala is the sole member of the genus Aepyceros and belongs to the family Bovidae. It was first described by German zoologist Martin Hinrich Carl Lichtenstein in 1812. In 1984, palaeontologist Elisabeth Vrba opined that the impala is a sister taxon to the alcelaphines, given its resemblance to the hartebeest. A 1999 phylogenetic study by Alexandre Hassanin (of the National Centre for Scientific Research, Paris) and colleagues, based on mitochondrial and nuclear analyses, showed that the impala forms a clade with the suni (Neotragus moschatus). This clade is sister to another formed by the bay duiker (Cephalophus dorsalis) and the klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus). An rRNA and Œ≤-spectrin nuclear sequence analysis in 2003 also supported an association between Aepyceros and Neotragus. The following cladogram is based on the 1999 study: Up to six subspecies have been described, although only two are generally recognised on the basis of mitochondrial data. Though morphologically similar, the subspecies show a significant genetic distance between them, and no hybrids between them have been reported. * A. m. melampus Lichtenstein, 1812: Known as the common impala, it occurs across eastern and southern Africa. The range extends from central Kenya to South Africa and westward into southeastern Angola. * A. m. petersi Bocage, 1879: Known as the black-faced impala, it is restricted to southwestern Africa, occurring in northwestern Namibia and southwestern Angola. According to Vrba, the impala developed from an alcelaphine ancestor. She noted that while this ancestor has diverged at least 18 times into various morphologically different forms, the impala has continued in its basic form for at least five million years. Several fossil species have been discovered, including A. datoadeni from the Pliocene of Ethiopia. The oldest fossil discovered suggests its ancient ancestors were slightly smaller than the modern form, but otherwise very similar in all aspects to the latter. This implies that the impala has efficiently adapted to its environment since prehistoric times. Its gregarious nature, variety in diet, positive population trend, defence against ticks and symbiotic relationship with the tick-feeding oxpeckers could have played a role in preventing major changes in morphology and behaviour. Description Close view of a male, with characteristic lyre-shaped horns, white tail and several black markings The impala is a medium-sized, slender antelope similar to the kob or Grant's gazelle in build. The head-and-body length is around . Males reach approximately at the shoulder, while females are tall. Males typically weigh and females . Sexually dimorphic, females are hornless and smaller than males. Males grow slender, lyre-shaped horns long. The horns, strongly ridged and divergent, are circular in section and hollow at the base. Their arch-like structure allows interlocking of horns, which helps a male throw off his opponent during fights; horns also protect the skull from damage. The glossy coat of the impala shows two-tone colourationthe reddish brown back and the tan flanks; these are in sharp contrast to the white underbelly. Facial features include white rings around the eyes and a light chin and snout. The ears, long, are tipped with black. Black streaks run from the buttocks to the upper hindlegs. The bushy white tail, long, features a solid black stripe along the midline. The impala's colouration bears a strong resemblance to the gerenuk, which has shorter horns and lacks the black thigh stripes of the impala. The impala has scent glands covered by a black tuft of hair on the hindlegs. Sebaceous glands concentrated on the forehead and dispersed on the torso of dominant males are most active during the mating season, while those of females are only partially developed and do not undergo seasonal changes. There are four nipples. Of the subspecies, the black-faced impala is significantly larger and darker than the common impala; melanism is responsible for the black colouration. Distinctive of the black-faced impala is a dark stripe, on either side of the nose, that runs upward to the eyes and thins as it reaches the forehead. Other differences include the larger black tip on the ear, and a bushier and nearly 30% longer tail in the black-faced impala. The impala has a special dental arrangement on the front lower jaw similar to the toothcomb seen in strepsirrhine primates, which is used during allogrooming to comb the fur on the head and the neck and remove ectoparasites. Ecology and behaviour Impala can leap up to . The impala is diurnal (active mainly during the day), though activity tends to cease during the hot midday hours; they feed and rest at night. Three distinct social groups can be observedthe territorial males, bachelor herds and female herds. The territorial males hold territories where they may form harems of females; territories are demarcated with urine and faeces and defended against juvenile or male intruders. Bachelor herds tend to be small, with less than 30 members. Individuals maintain distances of from one another; while young and old males may interact, middle-aged males generally avoid one another except to spar. Female herds vary in size from 6 to 100; herds occupy home ranges of . The mother‚Äìcalf bond is weak, and breaks soon after weaning; juveniles leave the herds of their mothers to join other herds. Female herds tend to be loose and have no obvious leadership. Allogrooming is an important means of social interaction in bachelor and female herds; in fact, the impala appears to be the only ungulate to display self-grooming as well as allogrooming. In allogrooming, females typically groom related impalas, while males associate with unrelated ones. Each partner grooms the other six to twelve times. An impala stotting Social behaviour is influenced by the climate and geography; as such, the impala are territorial at certain times of the year and gregarious at other times, and the length of these periods can vary broadly among populations. For instance, populations in southern Africa display territorial behaviour only during the few months of the rut, whereas in eastern African populations, territoriality is relatively minimal despite a protracted mating season. Moreover, territorial males often tolerate bachelors, and may even alternate between bachelorhood and territoriality at different times of the year. A study of impala in the Serengeti National Park showed that in 94% of the males, territoriality was observed for less than four months. The impala is an important prey species for several carnivores, such as cheetahs, leopards and lions. The antelope displays two characteristic leapsit can jump up to , over vegetation and even other impala, covering distances of up to ; the other type of leap involves a series of jumps in which the animal lands on its forelegs, moves its hindlegs mid-air in a kicking fashion, lands on all fours (stotting) and then rebounds. It leaps in either manner in different directions, probably to confuse predators. At times, the impala may also conceal itself in vegetation to escape the eye of the predator. The most prominent vocalisation is the loud roar, delivered through one to three loud snorts with the mouth closed, followed by two to ten deep grunts with the mouth open and the chin and tail raised; a typical roar can be heard up to away. Scent gland secretions identify a territorial male. Impalas are sedentary; adult and middle-aged males, in particular, can hold their territories for years. =Parasites= Impala have a symbiotic relationship with oxpeckers. Common ixodid ticks collected from impala include Amblyomma hebraeum, Boophilus decoloratus, Hyalomma marginatum, Ixodes cavipalpus, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and R. evertsi. In Zimbabwe, heavy infestation by ticks such as R. appendiculatus has proved to be a major cause behind the high mortality of ungulates, as they can lead to tick paralysis. Impala have special adaptations for grooming, such as their characteristic dental arrangement, to manage ticks before they engorge; however, the extensive grooming needed to keep the tick load under control involves the risk of dehydration during summer, lower vigilance against predators and gradual wearing out of the teeth. A study showed that impala adjust the time devoted to grooming and the number of grooming bouts according to the seasonal prevalence of ticks. Impala are symbiotically related to oxpeckers,Mikula P, Hadrava J, Albrecht T, Tryjanowski P. (2018) Large-scale assessment of commensalistic‚Äìmutualistic associations between African birds and herbivorous mammals using internet photos. PeerJ 6:e4520 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4520 which feed on ticks from those parts of the antelope's body which the animal cannot access by itself (such as the ears, neck, eyelids, forehead and underbelly). The impala is the smallest ungulate with which oxpeckers are associated. In a study it was observed that oxpeckers selectively attended to impala despite the presence of other animals such as Coke's hartebeest, Grant's gazelle, Thompson's gazelle and topi. A possible explanation for this could be that because the impala inhabits woodlands (which can have a high density of ticks), the impala could have greater mass of ticks per unit area of the body surface. Another study showed that the oxpeckers prefer the ears over other parts of the body, probably because these parts show maximum tick infestation. Lice recorded from impala include Damalinia aepycerus, D. elongata, Linognathus aepycerus and L. nevilli; in a study, ivermectin (a medication against parasites) was found to have an effect on Boophilus decoloratus and Linognathus species, though not on Damalinia species. In a study of impala in South Africa, the number of worms in juveniles showed an increase with age, reaching a peak when impala turned a year old. This study recorded worms of genera such as Cooperia, Cooperoides, Fasciola, Gongylonema. Haemonchus, Impalaia, Longistrongylus and Trichostrongylus; some of these showed seasonal variations in density. =Diet= A herd grazing in Maasai Mara Impala browse as well as graze; either may predominate, depending upon the availability of resources. The diet comprises monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits and acacia pods (whenever available). Impala prefer places close to water sources, and resort to succulent vegetation if water is scarce. An analysis showed that the diet of impala is composed of 45% monocots, 45% dicots and 10% fruits; the proportion of grasses in the diet increases significantly (to as high as 90%) after the first rains, but declines in the dry season. Browsing predominates in the late wet and dry season, and diets are nutritionally poor in the mid-dry season, when impala feed mostly on woody dicots. Another study showed that the dicot proportion in the diet is much higher in bachelors and females than in territorial males. Impala feed on soft and nutritious grasses such as Digitaria macroblephara; tough, tall grasses, such as Heteropogon contortus and Themeda triandra, are typically avoided. Impala on the periphery of the herds are generally more vigilant against predators than those feeding in the centre; a foraging individual will try to defend the patch it is feeding on by lowering its head. A study revealed that time spent in foraging reaches a maximum of 75.5% of the day in the late dry season, decreases through the rainy season, and is minimal in the early dry season (57.8%). =Reproduction= dominance Males are sexually mature by the time they are a year old, though successful mating generally occurs only after four years. Mature males start establishing territories and try to gain access to females. Females can conceive after they are a year and a half old; oestrus lasts for 24 to 48 hours, and occurs every 12‚Äì29 days in non-pregnant females. The annual three-week-long rut (breeding season) begins toward the end of the wet season, typically in May. Gonadal growth and hormone production in males begin a few months before the breeding season, resulting in greater aggressiveness and territoriality. The bulbourethral glands are heavier, testosterone levels are nearly twice as high in territorial males as in bachelors, and the neck of a territorial male tends to be thicker than that of a bachelor during the rut. Mating tends to take place between full moons. Sounds of rutting male Rutting males fight over dominance, often giving out noisy roars and chasing one another; they walk stiffly and display their neck and horns. Males desist from feeding and allogrooming during the rut, probably to devote more time to garnering females in oestrus; the male checks the female's urine to ensure that she is in oestrus.Hart, Lynette A., and Benjamin L. Hart. \\"Species- specific patterns of urine investigation and flehmen in Grant's gazelle (Gazella granti), Thomson's gazelle (G. thomsoni), impala (Aepyceros melampus), and eland (Taurotragus oryx).\\" Journal of Comparative Psychology 101.4 (1987): 299. On coming across such a female, the excited male begins the courtship by pursuing her, keeping a distance of from her. The male flicks his tongue and may nod vigorously; the female allows him to lick her vulva, and holds her tail to one side. The male tries mounting the female, holding his head high and clasping her sides with his forelegs. Mounting attempts may be repeated every few seconds to every minute or two. The male loses interest in the female after the first copulation, though she is still active and can mate with other males. Gestation lasts six to seven months. Births generally occur in the midday; the female will isolate herself from the herd when labour pain begins. The perception that females can delay giving birth for an additional month if conditions are harsh may however not be realistic. A single calf is born, and is immediately concealed in cover for the first few weeks of its birth. The fawn then joins a nursery group within its mother's herd. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males, forced out of the group, join bachelor herds, while females may stay back. Distribution and habitat Impala inhabit woodlands. The impala inhabits woodlands due to its preference for shade; it can also occur on the interface (ecotone) between woodlands and savannahs. Places close to water sources are preferred. In southern Africa, populations tend to be associated with Colophospermum mopane and Acacia woodlands. Habitat choices differ seasonallyAcacia senegal woodlands are preferred in the wet season, and A. drepanolobium savannahs in the dry season. Another factor that could influence habitat choice is vulnerability to predators; impala tend to keep away from areas with tall grasses as predators could be concealed there. A study found that the reduction of woodland cover and creation of shrublands by the African bush elephants has favoured impala population by increasing the availability of more dry season browse. Earlier, the Baikiaea woodland, which has now declined due to elephants, provided minimum browsing for impala. The newly formed Capparis shrubland, on the other hand, could be a key browsing habitat. Impala are generally not associated with montane habitats; however, in KwaZulu-Natal, impala have been recorded at altitudes of up to above sea level. The historical range of the impala ‚Äì spanning across southern and eastern Africa ‚Äì has remained intact to a great extent, although it has disappeared from a few places, such as Burundi. The range extends from central and southern Kenya and northeastern Uganda in the east to northern KwaZulu-Natal in the south, and westward up to Namibia and southern Angola. The black-faced impala is confined to southwestern Angola and Kaokoland in northwestern Namibia; the status of this subspecies has not been monitored since the 2000s. The common impala has a wider distribution, and has been introduced in protected areas in Gabon and across southern Africa. Threats and conservation Impalas of Kruger National Park, RSA Impala tracks The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the impala as a species of least concern overall. The black-faced impala, however, is classified as a vulnerable species; as of 2008, fewer than 1,000 were estimated in the wild. Though there are no major threats to the survival of the common impala, poaching and natural calamities have significantly contributed to the decline of the black-faced impala. As of 2008, the population of the common impala has been estimated at around two million. According to some studies, translocation of the black-faced impala can be highly beneficial in its conservation. Around a quarter of the common impala populations occur in protected areas, such as the Okavango Delta (Botswana); Masai Mara and Kajiado (Kenya); Kruger National Park (South Africa); the Ruaha and Serengeti National Parks and Selous Game Reserve (Tanzania); Luangwa Valley (Zambia); Hwange, Sebungwe and Zambezi Valley (Zimbabwe). The rare black-faced impala has been introduced into private farms in Namibia and the Etosha National Park. Population densities vary largely from place to place; from less than one impala per square kilometre in Mkomazi National Park (Tanzania) to as high as 135 per square kilometre near Lake Kariba (Zimbabwe).

In many Christian denominations, an acolyte is anyone performing ceremonial duties such as lighting altar candles. In others, the term is used for one who has been inducted into a particular liturgical ministry, even when not performing those duties. Etymology The word acolyte is derived from the Greek word ·ºÄŒ∫œåŒªŒøœÖŒ∏ŒøœÇ (akolouthos), meaning an attendant, via Late Latin acolythus. Eastern Christianity ripida In the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches, the nearest equivalent of acolyte is the altar server. At one time there was a rank of minor clergy called the taper-bearer responsible for bearing lights during processions and liturgical entrances. However, this rank has long ago been subsumed by that of the reader and the service for the tonsure of a reader begins with the setting-aside of a taper-bearer. The functions of an acolyte or taper-bearer are therefore carried out by readers, subdeacons, or by non-tonsured men or boys who are sometimes called \\"acolytes\\" informally. Also, the term \\"altar-boys\\" is often used to refer to young altar servers. Subdeacons wear their normal vestments consisting of the sticharion and crossed orarion; readers and servers traditionally wear the sticharion alone. In recent times, however, in many of the North American Greek Orthodox Churches, for the sake of uniformity, readers have been permitted to wear the orarion (The Bishop presents the reader, who is to serve on the altar, with the orarion). Readers do not cross the orarion while wearing it, the uncrossed orarion being intended to slightly distinguish a reader from a subdeacon. In the Russian tradition, readers wear only the sticharion, and do not wear the orarion unless they have been specially blessed to by their bishop. (This might be done if a reader must occasionally serve in the role of a subdeacon, or for some other reason the bishop believes is fitting.) If a server has not been tonsured, he must remove the sticharion before he can receive Holy Communion. Western Christianity =Latin Church= Instituted acolytes assisting at the dedication of an altar Until 1972, the highest of the four minor orders in the Latin Church was that of acolyte. By his motu proprio Ministeria quaedam of 15 August 1972, Pope Paul VI replaced the term \\"minor orders\\" by that of \\"ministries\\" and the term \\"ordination\\" by \\"institution\\". He kept throughout the Latin Church two instituted ministries, those of reader and acolyte.Ministeria quaedam, IV A prescribed interval, as decided by the Holy See and the national episcopal conference, is to be observed between receiving the two.Ministeria quaedam, X Candidates for diaconate and for priesthood must receive both ministries and exercise them for some time before receiving holy orders.Ministeria quaedam, XI The two instituted ministries are not reserved solely for candidates for holy orders,Ministeria quaedam, III but can be conferred only on men.Ministeria quaedam, VII Ministries are conferred by the ordinary: either a bishop or the head of a similar territory or, in the case of clerical religious institutes, a major superior.Ministeria quaedam, IX Institutions of acolytes not preparing for holy orders are in fact sometimes carried out.Six lay men installed as acolytes in Spokane (Catholic News Service, 14 December 2018) The motu proprio assigned to the instituted acolyte the functions previously reserved for the subdeacon, and declared national episcopal conferences free to use the term \\"subdeacon\\" in place of that of \\"acolyte\\".Ministeria quaedam, IV The functions of the instituted acolyte are specified in the motu proprio,Ministeria quaedam, VI and have been indicated also in the General Instruction of the Roman Missal, no. 98, which under the heading, \\"The Ministry of the Instituted Acolyte and Lector\\", says: \\"The acolyte is instituted to serve at the altar and to assist the priest and deacon. In particular, it is his responsibility to prepare the altar and the sacred vessels and, if it is necessary, as an extraordinary minister, to distribute the Eucharist to the faithful. In the ministry of the altar, the acolyte has his own functions (cf. nos. 187-193), which he must perform personally.\\"General Instruction of the Roman Missal The General Instruction of the Roman Missal adds: \\"In the absence of an instituted acolyte, lay ministers may be deputed to serve at the altar and assist the priest and the deacon; they may carry the cross, the candles, the thurible, the bread, the wine, and the water, and they may also be deputed to distribute Holy Communion as extraordinary ministers.\\"General Instruction of the Roman Missal, no. 100 However, some functions, in particular that of cleansing the Eucharistic vessels, are reserved for an instituted acolyte and are not entrusted to those deputed to assist in that way.General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 192 As in other churches, in the Latin Church the term \\"acolyte\\" is also used of altar servers on whom no ordination or institution has been conferred.David Philippart, Serve God with Gladness: A Manual for Servers (Liturgy Training Publications 1998), p. 106St. Peter Server Training Glossary Pope Benedict XVI spoke of Saint Tarcisius as \\"presumably an acolyte, that is, an altar server\\".Pope Benedict XVI, General Audience, 4 August 2010 =Anglicanism= An Episcopal acolyte lighting an altar candle In Anglican churches ‚Äì such as the Church of England, the Episcopal Church of the United States, the Church in Wales, the Scottish Episcopal Church ‚Äì altar servers are often called acolytes and can be of either sex and age. An acolyte can assist in worship by carrying a processional cross, lighting candles, holding the Gospel book, holding candles or \\"torches\\", assisting a deacon or priest set up and clean up at the altar, swinging a censer or thurible or carrying the incense boat, handing the offering plates to ushers, and many other tasks as seen fit by the priest or acolyte warden. In Anglo-Catholic churches acolytes commonly wear cassock and cotta, and in less Anglo-Catholic churches commonly cassock-alb with girdle or cincture. Both cincture and girdle can be usually a twisted rope with knots on the ends which is secured round the waist; it may be white or of the liturgical colour. A cincture may also be a band of cloth worn across the waist. Wearing crosses or other special pins or symbols is the prerogative of the individual church. In some more 'traditional' parishes, the acolytes are ranked as they develop their abilities to serve: Trainees, Junior Acolytes, Senior Acolytes, and Acolytes of Merit. In others, the functions of acolytes are performed without vestments, and without significant formal training by persons available in the parish. In other parishes, Acolytes are referred to according to the roles they perform. E.g. Master of Ceremonies, Crucifer and Thurifer, together with the 1st and 2nd Acolytes. =Methodism and Lutheranism= In the Methodist and Lutheran traditions, acolytes participate in the worship service by carrying a processional cross or crucifix (these acolytes are called crucifers), lighting and extinguishing the altar candles, and ringing the church bell to call the congregation to worship. In these traditions, the lighting of the altar candles in the worship service is a symbol of Jesus‚Äô coming into the presence of the worshiping community. Before lighting the candles the acolyte may bow at the altar out of respect. Before the extinguishing of the last altar candles, the acolytes relight their \\"candle lighter\\" and then process out into the narthex. This symbolizes that Jesus Christ is for all people everywhere. It also symbolizes the light of Jesus Christ going out into the world where believers are called to serve.The Woodlands United Methodist Church: What is an Acolyte? Similar to those in the Anglican tradition, acolytes in these traditions wear robes called albs, sometimes with a cincture. It is also common for Methodist acolytes to wear the traditional cassock and cotta. References *John N. Wall. A Dictionary for Episcopalians. Cambridge, MA: Cowley Publications, 2000.

The objective of conjoint analysis is to determine what combination of a limited number of attributes is most influential on respondent choice or decision making. A controlled set of potential products or services is shown to survey respondents and by analyzing how they make choices among these products, the implicit valuation of the individual elements making up the product or service can be determined. These implicit valuations (utilities or part-worths) can be used to create market models that estimate market share, revenue and even profitability of new designs. Conjoint analysis originated in mathematical psychology and was developed by marketing professor Paul E. Green at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Other prominent conjoint analysis pioneers include professor V. \\"Seenu\\" Srinivasan of Stanford University who developed a linear programming (LINMAP) procedure for rank ordered data as well as a self- explicated approach, and Jordan Louviere (University of Iowa) who invented and developed choice-based approaches to conjoint analysis and related techniques such as best‚Äìworst scaling. Today it is used in many of the social sciences and applied sciences including marketing, product management, and operations research. It is used frequently in testing customer acceptance of new product designs, in assessing the appeal of advertisements and in service design. It has been used in product positioning, but there are some who raise problems with this application of conjoint analysis. Conjoint analysis techniques may also be referred to as multiattribute compositional modelling, discrete choice modelling, or stated preference research, and are part of a broader set of trade-off analysis tools used for systematic analysis of decisions. These tools include Brand-Price Trade-Off, Simalto, and mathematical approaches such as AHP, evolutionary algorithms or rule-developing experimentation.  Conjoint design  A product or service area is described in terms of a number of attributes. For example, a television may have attributes of screen size, screen format, brand, price and so on. Each attribute can then be broken down into a number of levels. For instance, levels for screen format may be LED, LCD, or Plasma. Respondents are shown a set of products, prototypes, mock-ups, or pictures created from a combination of levels from all or some of the constituent attributes and asked to choose from, rank or rate the products they are shown. Each example is similar enough that consumers will see them as close substitutes but dissimilar enough that respondents can clearly determine a preference. Each example is composed of a unique combination of product features. The data may consist of individual ratings, rank orders, or choices among alternative combinations. Conjoint design involves four different steps: # Determine the type of study # Identify the relevant attributes # Specify the attributes‚Äô levels # Design questionnaire = 1. Determine the type of study = There are different types of studies that may be designed: * Ranking-based conjoint * Rating-based conjoint * Choice-based conjoint = 2. Identify the relevant attributes = Attributes in conjoint analysis should: * be relevant to managerial decision-making, * have varying levels in real-life, * be expected to influence preferences, * be clearly defined and communicable, * preferably not exhibit strong correlations (price and brand are an exception), * consist of at least two levels. = 3. Specify the attributes‚Äô levels = Levels of attributes should be: * unambiguous, * mutually exclusive, * realistic. = 4. Design questionnaire = As the number of combinations of attributes and levels increases the number of potential profiles increases exponentially. Consequently, fractional factorial design is commonly used to reduce the number of profiles to be evaluated, while ensuring enough data are available for statistical analysis, resulting in a carefully controlled set of \\"profiles\\" for the respondent to consider.  Types  The earliest forms of conjoint analysis starting in the 1970s were what are known as Full Profile studies, in which a small set of attributes (typically 4 to 5) were used to create profiles that were shown to respondents, often on individual cards. Respondents then ranked or rated these profiles. Using relatively simple dummy variable regression analysis the implicit utilities for the levels could be calculated that best reproduced the ranks or ratings as specified by respondents. Two drawbacks were seen in these early designs. Firstly, the number of attributes in use was heavily restricted. With large numbers of attributes, the consideration task for respondents becomes too large and even with fractional factorial designs the number of profiles for evaluation can increase rapidly. In order to use more attributes (up to 30), hybrid conjoint techniques were developed that combined self-explication (rating or ranking of levels and attributes) followed by conjoint tasks. Both paper-based and adaptive computer-aided questionnaires became options starting in the 1980s. The second drawback was that ratings or rankings of profiles were unrealistic and did not link directly to behavioural theory. In real-life situations, buyers choose among alternatives rather than ranking or rating them. Jordan Louviere pioneered an approach that used only a choice task which became the basis of choice-based conjoint analysis and discrete choice analysis. This stated preference research is linked to econometric modeling and can be linked to revealed preference where choice models are calibrated on the basis of real rather than survey data. Originally, choice-based conjoint analysis was unable to provide individual-level utilities and researchers developed aggregated models to represent the market's preferences. This made it unsuitable for market segmentation studies. With newer hierarchical Bayesian analysis techniques, individual-level utilities may be estimated that provide greater insights into the heterogeneous preferences across individuals and market segments.  Information collection  Data for conjoint analysis are most commonly gathered through a market research survey, although conjoint analysis can also be applied to a carefully designed configurator or data from an appropriately designed test market experiment. Market research rules of thumb apply with regard to statistical sample size and accuracy when designing conjoint analysis interviews. The length of the conjoint questionnaire depends on the number of attributes to be assessed and the selected conjoint analysis method. A typical adaptive conjoint questionnaire with 20-25 attributes may take more than 30 minutes to complete. Choice based conjoint, by using a smaller profile set distributed across the sample as a whole, may be completed in less than 15 minutes. Choice exercises may be displayed as a store front type layout or in some other simulated shopping environment. Analysis Sample output of conjoint analysis with application to marketing. Depending on the type of model, different econometric and statistical methods can be used to estimate utility functions. These utility functions indicate the perceived value of the feature and how sensitive consumer perceptions and preferences are to changes in product features. The actual estimation procedure will depend on the design of the task and profiles for respondents and the measurement scale used to indicate preferences (interval-scaled, ranking, or discrete choice). For estimating the utilities for each attribute level using ratings-based full profile tasks, linear regression may be appropriate, for choice based tasks, maximum likelihood estimation usually with logistic regression is typically used. The original utility estimation methods were monotonic analysis of variance or linear programming techniques, but contemporary marketing research practice has shifted towards choice-based models using multinomial logit, mixed versions of this model, and other refinements. Bayesian estimators are also very popular. Hierarchical Bayesian procedures are nowadays relatively popular as well. Advantages and disadvantages =Advantages= * estimates psychological tradeoffs that consumers make when evaluating several attributes together * can measure preferences at the individual level * uncovers real or hidden drivers which may not be apparent to respondents themselves * mimics realistic choice or shopping task * able to use physical objects * if appropriately designed, can model interactions between attributes * may be used to develop needs-based segmentation, when applying models that recognize respondent heterogeneity of tastes =Disadvantages= * designing conjoint studies can be complex * when facing too many product features and product profiles, respondents often resort to simplification strategies * difficult to use for product positioning research because there is no procedure for converting perceptions about actual features to perceptions about a reduced set of underlying features * respondents are unable to articulate attitudes toward new categories, or may feel forced to think about issues they would otherwise not give much thought to * poorly designed studies may over-value emotionally-laden product features and undervalue concrete features * does not take into account the quantity of products purchased per respondent, but weighting respondents by their self- reported purchase volume or extensions such as volumetric conjoint analysis may remedy this Practical applications =Market research= One practical application of conjoint analysis in business analysis is given by the following example: A real estate developer is interested in building a high rise apartment complex near an urban Ivy League university. To ensure the success of the project, a market research firm is hired to conduct focus groups with current students. Students are segmented by academic year (freshman, upper classmen, graduate studies) and amount of financial aid received. Study participants are shown a series of choice scenarios, involving different apartment living options specified on 6 attributes (proximity to campus, cost, telecommunication packages, laundry options, floor plans, and security features offered). The estimated cost to construct the building associated with each apartment option is equivalent. Participants are asked to choose their preferred apartment option within each choice scenario. This forced choice exercise reveals the participants' priorities and preferences. Multinomial logistic regression may be used to estimate the utility scores for each attribute level of the 6 attributes involved in the conjoint experiment. Using these utility scores, market preference for any combination of the attribute levels describing potential apartment living options may be predicted. =Litigation= Federal courts in the United States have allowed expert witnesses to use conjoint analysis to support their opinions on the damages that an infringer of a patent should pay to compensate the patent holder for violating its rights.Cornell University v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 609 F. Supp. 2d 279 (N.D.N.Y. 2009); Sentius Int'l, LLC v. Microsoft Corp., No. 5:13-cv-00825, 2015 WL 331939 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 23, 2015). Nonetheless, legal scholars have noted that the Federal Circuit's jurisprudence on the use of conjoint analysis in patent-damages calculations remains in a formative stage.J. Gregory Sidak & Jeremy O. Skog, Using Conjoint Analysis to Apportion Patent Damages, (Criterion Economics Working Paper, Jan. 29, 2016), https://www.criterioneconomics.com/using-conjoint-analysis-to-apportion- patent-damages.html. One example of this is how Apple used a conjoint analysis to prove the damages suffered by Samsung's copyright infringement, and increase their compensation in the case.

The quarter is customarily bounced on the face whether heads or tails. Some games may allow a player to bounce the quarter on the edge, particularly by rolling it down their nose. Gameplay Each round starts off with a glass filled with a drink in the middle of the table and two people on opposite ends of the table having a quarter and a glass. Each player shoots his or her quarter at his/her glass until he makes it in, then the player passes the glass to the player to their left. If the player to their left still has a glass as well, the player taps that glass with theirs, and the player who has been tapped must drink from the glass in the middle of the table, refill it, then make the quarter into his or her glass before they get tapped again, with play still going around the table. If a player makes his or her first shot, s/he can choose to pass the glass to any player who does not currently have a glass. If there are enough people at the table, the group can add more shot glasses and position them equally spaced around the outside of the circle. =Speed Quarters= This version involves six or more people around a small table, several quarters, drinks for each player, and two empty shot glasses placed in front of opposite players. When the game begins, the two players with glasses pick up a quarter and try to bounce it off of the table into the shot glass in front of them as quickly as possible. If the shot is not made they keep shooting until one makes the shot. This player dumps the quarter out and passes the glass to the player to his left while the other shooter continues to shoot until they make a quarter into their shot glass. Eventually, when repeated enough, one glass will catch up to the other in rotation. When this happens, the player still shooting must overturn a glass and stack the other on top. This player gets two chances to bounce a quarter off of the table and into the top glass. If they make it on the first, they can pass the stacked glasses to any player, where that player get two chances, and so on. If the player makes it on the second shot, the glasses are unstacked, one passes to the player on the left, and one to the player opposite. Game-play resumes from the beginning. If the player does not get a quarter into the stacked glasses in two shots, the player on their right will spin a quarter while the \\"loser\\" chugs their drink until the quarter ceases to spin. Any player can blow on the quarter or spin it with their finger to keep it spinning. After this, the glasses are split like when the game started and it begins again. Game-play ends when the players feel they are sufficiently inebriated. =Other variations= An alternative method of gameplay is that one glass is positioned in the center of the table. Participants take turns attempting to bounce the quarter into the glass. If the shooter succeeds, they pass the glass to anyone at the table, and that person must then chug the beverage and catch the quarter in their teeth. Play then passes to the person on the shooter's left. Should the shooter fail to make the shot, they have the option of passing the quarter to the left, or shooting a second time. If the shooter succeeds on their second shot, they pass the glass as usual. If the shooter fails on their second shot, they must drink the beverage. In either case, the person on their left becomes the next shooter. Another method involves various cups and one community cup. A community cup is first placed in the center of the table. Each player has their own individual cup, and these cups are placed around the community cup, forming a ring around the community cup (much like a flower pattern). Players fill their individual cups with a shot of their drink, and pour a small amount of their drink into the community cup (various drinks can be used to play, so the community cup may house a mixture of different drinks). A shooter begins by bouncing a quarter towards the cups. If the quarter lands in a player's cup, the player must drink his/her shot, refill the cup, and place it back with the rest. If the shooter lands the quarter in to the community cup, every player must reach into the center and drink their shot. The last player to finish their drink must then drink the community cup. If the shooter makes his/her shot on the first attempt, they may shoot again until they miss. If they miss on the first attempt, they must pass the quarter to the next player on their left. This game is commonly called Ponderosa. Another variation gives the shooter the power to make a rule if they land the quarter in the cup in a certain number of consecutive tries. The rule is often that shooters must then say a phrase, or perhaps that no one at the table can say a certain word, with the penalty being an instant drink by the offending player. This effectively speeds up the intoxication. Common rules that the shooter will create are that no one can say the word Drink, Drank, Drunk or point with their finger. Note that only one rule can be created at a time. Any shot where the shooter does not bounce the quarter off of the table at least once counts as a miss. Beverages The players must determine beforehand how much is to be consumed each time a player is required to drink. This depends on the variation being played and the appetites of the players.

The Comet was initially based on the compact Ford Falcon, then on the intermediate Ford Fairlane and finally on the compact Ford Maverick. As a Mercury, early Comets received better grade interior trim than concurrent Falcons, and a slightly longer wheelbase. Relationship to Edsel The Comet was originally planned as an Edsel model. Ford announced the end of the Edsel program on November 19, 1959. However, production of 1960 Edsels continued until late November. The Comet was reassigned to the Lincoln-Mercury division to sell at Mercury-Comet dealerships, where it was marketed as a stand-alone product for 1960 and 1961 as the Comet without any Mercury divisional badging. Developed concurrently with the Ford Falcon, early pre-production photographs of the sedan show a car remarkably close to the Comet that emerged, but with a split grille following the pattern established by Edsel models. Early Ford styling mules for the station wagon model carried the Edsel name as well. At their debut, the split grille was replaced by one more in keeping with Mercury's design themes. However, the canted elliptical taillights, first seen on the Edsel prototype, were used and carried the \\"E\\" (Edsel) part number on them. While the short lived 1960 Edsels used elliptical shaped taillights, the lenses used on both cars differed in length and width. Certain other parts from the 1959 Edsel parts bin, including the parking lights and dashboard knobs, were used on the first-year Comet. Keys for the 1960 and 1961 Comets were shaped like Edsel keys, with the center bar of the \\"E\\" removed to form a \\"C\\". The \\"comet\\" name was trademarked to Cotner-Bevington as the Comet Coach Company, building ambulance and hearse commercial vehicles. Ford bought the name in 1959. Overview From 1960‚Äì1965, the Comet was based on the Ford Falcon platform (stretched for sedans, but not for wagons). The 1960‚Äì1963 Comets share a similar basic shape. These are sometimes referred to as the \\"round body\\" Comets. For 1962 and 1963, the Comet shared a considerable number of body and mechanical parts with the short-lived Fairlane-based Mercury Meteor intermediate. First generation (1960‚Äì1963) 1960 Comet two-door sedan, with its very distinct tailfins The Comet was initially released without any divisional badging, only \\"Comet\\" badges, similar to Valiant which didn't have Plymouth badging at first. It was sold through Mercury-Comet dealers, but would not be branded as a Mercury Comet for two more years. This was similar to Ford's treatment of the Meteor and Frontenac of Canada, sold thru Meteor - Mercury - Frontenac dealers. 1961 Comet 4-door sedan new grille design Introduced in March 1960, initial body styles were 2-door and 4-door sedans and 2- and 4-door station wagons. Two trim levels were available, standard and \\"Custom\\", with the custom package including badging, additional chrome trim and all-vinyl interiors. In 1960, the only engine available was the 144 cid Thriftpower straight-six with a single-barrel Holley carburetor which produced at 4200 rpm. (Some sources list it as producing at 4200 rpm). Transmission options were a column-shifted 3-speed manual and a 2-speed Merc- O-Matic automatic transmission (unique to the Comet, despite sharing a name with the Merc-O-Matic installed in other Mercurys). Ford had purchased the name \\"Comet\\" from Comet Coach Company, a professional car manufacturer in which the term belonged to a line of funeral coaches, mainly Oldsmobiles. The coach company then was renamed Cotner-Bevington. In Canada, for the 1960 model year, Meteor-Mercury dealers sold a compact car called the \\"Frontenac\\". Frontenac was considered a marque in its own right and was a badge-engineered version of the Ford Falcon with only minor trim differences to distinguish it from the Falcon. The Frontenac was produced for only one year. The Comet was introduced to the Canadian market for the 1961 model year and replaced the Frontenac as the compact offering by Meteor-Mercury dealers. 1962 Comet 4-door station wagon In response to complaints about the low performance of the 144 cid engine, a 170 cid Thriftpower with a single-barrel Holley carburetor producing at 4400 rpm was released for the 1961 model year. A new 4-speed manual transmission was also an option (a Dagenham without 1st gear synchromesh). The changes to the 1961 Comet were minimal such as moving the Comet Script from the front fender to the rear quarter as well as a new grille design. 1963 Mercury Comet S-22 convertible The optional S-22 package was released. Available only on the 2-door sedan, it was billed as a \\"sport\\" package, although it shared the same mechanicals as regular Comets, with the only changes being S-22 badging, bucket seats and a center console. Comet was officially made a Mercury model for the 1962 model year, and it received some minor restyling, mainly a redesign of the trunk and taillight area to bring the car more in line with the Mercury look. This is the first year the car carried Mercury badging. The S-22 had six bullet shaped tail lights, while regular Comets had four oval with 2 optional flat reverse lights. A Comet Villager station wagon, basically a Comet Custom 4-door station wagon with simulated woodgrain side panels, was added to the lineup. (The Villager name had previously been used to denote the 4-door steel-sided station wagon in the Edsel Ranger series.) While the 1963 model looked almost identical to the earlier models, the chassis and suspension were redesigned to accommodate an optional 260 cid V8 engine (Borrowed from the Fairlane) using a 2-barrel carburetor and producing . Convertible and hardtop (pillar-less) coupe models were added to the Comet Custom and Comet S-22 lines this year. The front ends of these Comets differed from their Falcon counterparts in that they had four headlights instead of two; similar situations would resurface in the late 1970s, with the Ford Thunderbird/Mercury Cougar and the Ford Fairmont/Mercury Zephyr. Second generation (1964‚Äì1965) 1964 Mercury Comet Caliente. This is a right hand drive version located in Australia. The 1964 Comet was redesigned with a much more square shape, though it was still built on the same unibody as the 1963 model. Its basic lines were shared with the new Falcon, but the front grille used styling similar to that of the Lincoln Continental. Along with the redesign, the model designations were changed. The performance version was known as the Cyclone, replacing the previous S-22. Then in descending order of trim levels were the Caliente, 404 and 202, replacing the previous Custom and base models. The 2-door station wagon bodystyle was discontinued. The top-of-the-line station wagon continued to be known as the Villager. The base 144 cid six engine was dropped and the 170 cid six became the new base engine. The 260 V8 was available at the beginning of the production run, with the new 289 being available mid-year. Due to the success of the full size Ford and Mercury \\"fastback\\" roofline introduced in mid-1963, the Falcon and Comet 2-door hardtops got a similar roofline with sharper corners. For 1964, Ford produced about 50 ultra high performance lightweight Comet Cyclones, equipped with their racing two-carburetor 427 engine, similar to their cousin, the Ford Thunderbolt. To avoid competing with each other, the Thunderbolts ran in super stock on tires, but the Cyclones were modified to run in A/FX on tires, where they were as dominant as the Thunderbolts were in super stock. Drivers included Ronnie Sox, Don Nicholson and Wild Bill Shrewsberry in conjunction with Jack Chrisman. Shrewsberry still owns his original 427 Comet in Caliente trim. 1965 Mercury Comet Caliente Two-Door Hardtop For 1965, the Comet received updated styling front and rear (including stacked headlights, similar to what Pontiacs and Cadillacs would use at the same time). The base 6-cylinder engine was increased from 170 cid to 200 cid. Still using a single-barrel carburetor, it produced at 4400 rpm. The base 8-cylinder engine was increased from 260 to 289 cid and, using a 2-barrel carburetor, it produced at 4400 rpm. The standard transmission continued as a column-shifted 3-speed manual transmission. The optional automatic was changed to a \\"Merc-O-Matic\\" 3-speed automatic transmission (essentially a Ford C4 transmission). The 289 V8 was available in three horsepower ratings, base 2-barrel 200 hp, 4-barrel and the premier driveline option was the 289 cubic inch, high-performance engine and four-speed manual transmission found on the Ford Mustang. Third generation (1966‚Äì1967) Beginning in 1966, the Comet grew from a compact to become a mid-sized car. It was now based on the same chassis as the Ford Fairlane intermediate (and the previous Mercury Meteor intermediate which was only offered in 1962‚Äì1963). These intermediate-sized cars used the same basic chassis as the original Ford Falcon and Mercury Comet compacts, but were stretched with longer wheelbases. The previous generation Comet shared its platform with the all-new Ford Mustang in 1964, and when the Comet graduated to the intermediate platform, the Mercury Cougar became the platform shared with the Mustang. The Comet wagon would introduce a Dual- Action tailgate, able to both fold down or swing aside, an idea soon copied by all the major U.S. manufacturers.Flory, J. \\"Kelly\\", Jr. American Cars 1960‚Äì1972 (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Coy, 2004), p.456. 1966 Mercury Comet Cyclone GT hardtop 1967 Mercury Comet Caliente convertible The 1966 Comet received distinct outer body panels. The Comet Capri replaced the previous Comet 404 and the Comet Voyager 4-door station wagon replaced the previous Comet 404 station wagon. The Voyager name had previously been used to designate a full-sized Mercury station wagon that was positioned between the base Commuter and the top-of-the-line Colony Park station wagon models. The Comet 202 4-door station wagon was discontinued. The new top-of-the-line series was the Comet Cyclone GT. New engines available in the Comet for 1966 included a 390 cid V8 engine with a 2-barrel carburetor producing at 4400 rpm, a 390 cid V8 engine with a 4-barrel carburetor producing , and 390 cid V8 engine that produced . The 335 hp 390 cid V8 engine was standard on the Cyclone GT and optional on other models. The Cyclone GT when equipped with an automatic transmission was referred to as the Cyclone GTA. A Cyclone GT convertible was the pace car for the 1966 Indianapolis 500. Beginning with the 1967 model year, the Comet name was used only on the base Comet 202 model, available only in 2 or 4-door sedan body styles. Other models were now referred to by what had previously been their subseries names. Mercury's mid- size line-up ranged from the basic Comet 202, through the Capri, Caliente, Cyclone, and Cyclone GT models, as well as steel-sided Voyager and simulated wood paneled Villager station wagon models, which were comparable to the Capri. Forth generation (1968‚Äì1969) In 1968, Mercury's mid-sized models again received new sheet metal and styling that resembled the full-sized Mercury models and shared their chassis and many parts with Ford's mid-sized Fairlane and Torino models. The mid-sized base model was the Comet (Mercury dropped the 202 suffix) available only as a 2-door coupe. The Capri was replaced by the Montego, and the Caliente by the Montego MX. There was also a more luxurious Montego MX Brougham, basically an option package for the Montego MX. Top-of-the-line mid-sized models continued to use the Cyclone and Cyclone GT names. A 302 cid V8 engine using a 2-barrel carburetor and generating at 4600 rpm would replace the previous 289 cid V8 midway in the 1968 model year. For the 1969 model year, the grille was modified and the headlight surrounds were removed. The taillights were also slightly re-styled. There would be few changes to Mercury's mid-sized lineup for the 1969 model year, the last year that the Comet name would grace a mid-sized model. A Comet 4-door sedan for 1969 was supposedly planned, but never offered. New top-of- the-line Cyclone Spoiler and Cyclone CJ models would join the lineup. A 250 cid inline-6 using a single-barrel carburetor and generating at 4000 rpm would replace the previous 200 cid 6 as standard. New engine options included a 302 cid V-8 engine using a 4-barrel carburetor and generating at 4400 rpm (standard on the Cyclone), a 351 cid V-8 using a 4-barrel carburetor generating at 5200 rpm (standard on the Cyclone Spoiler), and a 428 cid V-8 using a 4-barrel carburetor generating at 5200 rpm (standard on the Cyclone CJ). These new V-8s replaced the previous 390 cid V-8s. Fifth generation (1970) Still using the same basic chassis, 1970 models would receive dramatic new styling, but the base model would now be the Montego. Comet was no longer the base level intermediate. The Cyclone name would continue to be used through the 1971 model year. Sixth generation (1971‚Äì1977) For 1971, the Comet name was revived on Mercury's version of the Ford Maverick compact. Sharing most of its sheet-metal with the Maverick, it used a different grille, taillights, and hood, as well as different badging. The taillight pods were shared with the 1970 and 1971 Montego and Cyclone models. Underneath it all was the same basic chassis that had originally been used for the Ford Falcon, the original Comet, and for the mid-sized Ford Fairlane, Mercury Meteor, and later Mercury Comets. The base engine was the 170 cid inline-6 with a single- barrel carburetor producing at 4200 rpm. Optional engines were the 200 cid inline-6 with a single-barrel carburetor producing and a 302 cid V8 with a 2-barrel carburetor producing . Transmissions were either a 3-speed manual or 3-speed automatic with either column or floor-mounted shifters. The Comet was available as 2- and 4-door sedans and in base (1971‚Äì1977), and \\"muscle car\\" Comet GT series (2-door sedan-only 1971-1975). The GT featured a blacked-out grille, dual body-side tape stripes, high-back bucket seats, wheel trim rings, dual racing mirrors, bright window frames, black instrument panel, deluxe door trim panels, and a simulated hood scoop. In 1972 models, the base 170 cid six was rated at at 4400 rpm, the 200 cid six at , and the 302 cid V8 at . A new engine option for 1972 was the 250 cid six with a single-barrel carburetor rated at . 1973 Mercury Comet 4-Door Sedan For 1973 models, the base 170 cid six was dropped and the 200 cid six became the base engine. Horsepower ratings would fluctuate slightly up or down through the years the Comet would remain in production, but not by very much. A new, larger front bumper to meet federal standards was added to all models in 1973. A new Custom decor package featuring vinyl roof, body-colored wheel covers, wide vinyl-insert body-side moldings, vinyl bucket seats, luxury carpeting, and extra sound insulation was a popular option. Changes for 1974 included even larger front bumpers and new larger rear bumpers to match. They added to the length of the 2-door model and to the length of the 4-door model. Ford had originally planned to the replace the Comet and its Ford Maverick counterpart for the 1975 model year with updated and extensively redesigned models that would continue to use the Comet and Maverick names. Fairly late, though, they decided that the updated versions would be built alongside the original Maverick and the Comet that had originally been introduced for 1971. These would-be replacements, also using the same basic chassis as the Comet and Maverick, became the Mercury Monarch and the American Ford Granada, came with more standard and optional equipment than the Comet and Maverick, and were considered to be \\"luxury compacts,\\" a step up from the Comet and Maverick. Although 1975 was the last year for the Mercury Comet GT, the GT features remained available in 1976 and 1977 with the \\"Sports Accent\\" option group. The model was offered with comparatively few changes through the 1977 model year, and was then discontinued to make room for the new Mercury Zephyr for the 1978 model year. High mileage record In July 2010, USA Today reported on a 91-year-old Florida woman, Rachel Veitch, who was still driving her 1964 Comet Caliente daily. The car was purchased new, and Veitch set a record by accumulating over 562,000 documented miles. The car was retired in 2012 after accumulating 576,000 miles, as Veitch had decided to stop driving due to her eyesight becoming too weak. Mercury Cyclone The Cyclone was a performance model of the Comet. It was built from 1964‚Äì1971.Holder, Bill; Kunz, Phil. Ford Muscle. F+W Publications, Inc. 2004, p. 83-90. 1971 Mercury Cyclone =1968‚Äì1969 Mercury Cyclone= The Cyclone received Mercury‚Äôs biggest facelift in 1968, switching from 1967‚Äôs boxy, Fairlane-derived coupe body to the super-streamlined Torino-based fastback. Unfortunately, the Cyclone GT lost the 335-hp, 390-cid V-8 as its standard engine, instead replaced by the 210-hp, 302-cid V-8. No matter, though, as the fastback was handsome and could be equipped with a 230-hp 302, 265- or 325-hp 390-cid V-8s, (briefly) a 390-hp version of the 427-cid V-8, or a 335-hp, 428-cid V-8. By 1969, the Mercury Cyclone formal hardtop had been canceled and the GT fastback was also available as a CJ model. That came with the 335-hp, 428-cid V-8 standard, a four-speed transmission, and a plain bench seat interior. At $3,207, the CJ was aimed at the Plymouth Road Runner, and a 335-hp version could run 0-60 in 6.1 seconds with a quarter-mile time of 13.9 seconds. The Mercury Cyclone Spoiler and the Ford Torino Talladega launched the NASCAR streamliner battle when Cale Yarborough won the Daytona 500 in 1968 in a Woods Brothers Cyclone. Dodge produced the Daytona 500 and Ford retaliated with the Torino Talladega and Mercury Spoiler. Both were to have streamlined noses, but the Mercury launch was delayed until the mid-year Cyclone Spoiler II. Only 519 were sold, all with 351-cid V-8s instead of the bigger 428. A Dan Gurney special edition had a dark blue roof, striping, and a signature decal on the white lowers, while the Cale Yarborough edition was red and white like his Woods Brothers car, with a signature. =1970 Mercury Cyclone= Three Cyclone models were produced for 1970, all of which shared the Torino‚Äôs semi-fastback body, and all of which carried a four-part nose. The base car had a 360-hp, 429-cid V-8 and a four-speed transmission. Options included a 370-hp, 429-cid V-8 engine and a 375-hp, Super CJ 429-cid engine. There were also a few Boss 429s installed, though those cars are quite rare today. Meanwhile, the Cyclone GT was detuned to a 250-hp, 351-cid V-8 and the Spoiler packed a Ram-Air 370-hp, 429. =1971 Mercury Cyclone= The 1971 model year was the Cyclone‚Äôs last, as the muscle car wars wound down. With few changes from 1970, the Cyclone was absorbed into the Mercury Montego line, and only 444 Montego Cyclones were sold, along with 2,287 Cyclone GTs and 353 Cyclone Spoilers. Engine options ranged from the 210-hp, 302-cid V-8, all the way to the fire-breathing 370-hp, 429-cid Cobra-Jet V-8, to which a Ram-Air package could be added. Mercury Cyclones occupy a niche in the muscle car world, along with Oldsmobile W-30s and Buick GSX Stage Is. The car is a fantastic expression of American muscle, albeit one from a mid-level, luxury- oriented nameplate. As a result, the Cyclone is mostly overshadowed by the Ford Mustang and Torino.

It is broadly classified into four prominent forms (styles) based on the date of production. They are: * Vir-Gatha kal (poems extolling brave warriors) ‚Äì 11th‚Äì14th century * Bhakti kal poems (devotional poems) ‚Äì 14th‚Äì18th century * Riti or Srngar kal poems (poems of romance) ‚Äì 18th‚Äì20th century * Adhunik kal (modern literature) ‚Äì 20th century onwards The literature was produced in dialects such as Khariboli, Braj, Bundeli, Awadhi, Kannauji, as well as Marwari, Magahi, Bhojpuri and Chhattisgarhi.Hindi literature From the 20th century, works produced in Standard Hindi, a register of Hindustani written in the Devanagari script, are sometimes regarded as the only basis of modern literature in Hindi.Hindi in Constitution  History  = Adi Kal or Vir-Gatha kal (c. 1050 to 1375) = Literature of Adi kal (c. before the 15th century CE) was developed in the regions of Kannauj, Delhi, Ajmer stretching up to central India.Introduction to Hindi University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign Prithviraj Raso, an epic poem written by Chand Bardai (1149 ‚Äì c. 1200), is considered as one of the first works in the history of Hindi literature. Chand Bardai was a court poet of Prithviraj Chauhan, the famous ruler of Delhi and Ajmer during the invasion of Muhammad of Ghor. Jayachandra, the last ruler of Kannauj gave more patronage to Sanskrit rather than local dialects. Harsha, the author of Naishdhiya Charitra, was his court poet. Jagnayak (sometimes Jagnik), the royal poet in Mahoba, and Nalha, the royal poet in Ajmer, were the other prominent literary figures in this period. However, after Prithviraj Chauhan's defeat in the Second Battle of Tarain, most literary works belonging to this period were destroyed by the army of Muhammad of Ghor. Very few scriptures and manuscripts from this period are available and their genuineness is also doubted. Some Siddha and Nathpanthi poetical works belonging to this period are also found, but their genuineness is again, doubted. The Siddhas belonged to the Vajrayana, a later Buddhist sect. Some scholars argue that the language of Siddha poetry is not an earlier form of Hindi, but Magadhi Prakrit. Nathpanthis were yogis who practised the Hatha yoga. Some Jain and Rasau (heroic poets) poetry works are also available from this period. In the Deccan region in South India, Dakkhini or Hindavi was used. It flourished under the Delhi Sultanate and later under the Nizams of Hyderabad. It was written in the Persian script. Nevertheless, the Hindavi literature can be considered as proto-Hindi literature. Many Deccani experts like Sheikh Ashraf or Mulla Vajahi used the word Hindavi to describe this dialect. Others such as Roustami, Nishati etc. preferred to call it Deccani. Shah Buharnuddin Janam Bijapuri used to call it Hindi. The first Deccani author was Khwaja Bandanawaz Gesudaraz Muhammad Hasan. He wrote three prose works ‚Äì Mirazul Aashkini, Hidayatnama and Risala Sehwara. His grandson Abdulla Hussaini wrote Nishatul Ishq. The first Deccani poet was Nizami. During the later part of this period and early Bhakti Kala, many saint-poets like Ramanand and Gorakhnath became famous. The earliest form of Hindi can also be seen in some of Vidyapati's Maithili works. = Bhakti kaal (c. 1375 to 1700) = The medieval Hindi literature is marked by the influence of Bhakti movement and composition of long, epic poems. Awadhi and Braj Bhasha were the dialects in which literature was developed. The main works in Avadhi are Malik Muhammad Jayasi's Padmavat and Tulsidas's Ramacharitamanas. The major works in Braj dialect are Tulsidas's Vinaya Patrika and Surdas's Sur Sagar. Sadhukaddi was also a language commonly used, especially by Kabir in his poetry and dohas.Mystic poet Kabir The Bhakti period also marked great theoretical development in poetry forms chiefly from a mixture of older forms of poetry. These included Verse Patterns like Doha (two-liners), Sortha, Chaupaya (four- liners) etc. This was also the age when Poetry was characterised under the various Rasas. Unlike the Adi Kaal (also called the Vir Gatha Kaal) which was characterised by an overdose of Poetry in the Vir Rasa (Heroic Poetry), the Bhakti Yug marked a much more diverse and vibrant form of poetry which spanned the whole gamut of rasas from Shringara rasa (love), Vir Rasa (Heroism). Bhakti poetry had two schools ‚Äì the Nirguna school (the believers of a formless God or an abstract name) and the Saguna school (the believers of a God with attributes and worshippers of Vishnu's incarnations). Kabir and Guru Nanak belong to the Nirguna school, and their philosophy was greatly influenced by the Advaita Vedanta philosophy of Adi Sankaracharya. They believed in the concept of Nirgun Nirakaar Brahma or the Shapeless Formless One. The Saguna school was represented by mainly Vaishnava poets like Surdas, Tulsidas and others and was a logical extension of the Dvaita and Vishishta Advaita Philosophy propounded by the likes of Madhavacharya etc. This school was chiefly Vaishnava in orientation as in seen in the main compositions like Ramacharitamanas, Sur Saravali, Sur Sagar extoling Rama and Krishna. This was also the age of tremendous integration between the Hindu and the Islamic elements in the Arts with the advent of many Muslim Bhakti poets like Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana who was a court poet to Mughal emperor Akbar and was a great devotee of Krishna. The Nirgun School of Bhakti Poetry was also tremendously secular in nature and its propounders like Kabir and Guru Nanak had a large number of followers irrespective of caste or religion. = Riti- kavya kal (c. 1700 to 1900) = In the Ritikavya or Ritismagra Kavya period, the erotic element became predominant in the Hindi literature. This era is called Riti (meaning 'procedure') because it was the age when poetic figures and theory were developed to the fullest. But this emphasis on poetry theory greatly reduced the emotional aspects of poetry‚Äîthe main characteristic of the Bhakti movement‚Äîand the actual content of the poetry became less important. The Saguna School of the Bhakti Yug split into two schools (Rama bhakti and Krishna bhakti) somewhere in the interregnum of the Bhakti and the Reeti Eras. Although most Reeti works were outwordly related to Krishna Bhakti, their emphasis had changed from total devotion to the supreme being to the Shringar or erotic aspects of Krishna's life‚Äîhis Leela, his pranks with the Gopis in Braj, and the description of the physical beauty of Krishna and Radha,(Krishna's Consort). The poetry of Bihari, and Ghananand Das fit this bill. The most well known book from this age is the Bihari Satsai of Bihari, a collection of Dohas (couplets), dealing with Bhakti (devotion), Neeti (Moral policies) and Shringar (love). The first Hindi books, using the Devanagari script or NƒÅgarƒ´ script were one Heera Lal's treatise on Ain-i-Akbari, called Ain e Akbari ki Bhasha Vachanika, and Rewa Maharaja's treatise on Kabir. Both books came out in 1795. Munshi Lallu Lal's Hindi translation of Sanskrit Hitopadesha was published in 1809. Lala Srinivas Das published a novel in Hindi Pariksha guru in the NƒÅgarƒ´ script in 1886. Shardha Ram Phillauri wrote a Hindi novel Bhagyawati which was published in 1888. Chandrakanta, written by Devaki Nandan Khatri in 1888, is considered the first authentic work of prose in modern Hindi. The person who brought realism in the Hindi prose literature was Munshi Premchand, who is considered as the most revered figure in the world of Hindi fiction and progressive movement. = Adhunik kal (c. 1900 onwards) = In 1800, the British East India Company established Fort William College at Calcutta. The College president J. B. Gilchrist hired professors to write books in Hindustani. Some of these books were Prem Sagar by Lallu Lal, Naasiketopaakhyan by Sadal Mishra, Sukhsagar by Sadasukhlal of Delhi and Rani Ketaki ki kahani by Munshi Inshallah Khan. A depiction of Surya in an 1884 book, Indrajalakala (The Art of Magic); Jwala Prakash Press, Meerut The person who brought realism in the Hindi prose literature was Munshi Premchand, who is considered as the most revered figure in the world of Hindi fiction and progressive movement. Before Premchand, the Hindi literature revolved around fairy or magical tales, entertaining stories and religious themes. Premchand's novels have been translated into many other languages. Dwivedi Yug The Dwivedi Yug (\\"Age of Dwivedi\\") in Hindi literature lasted from 1900 to 1918. It is named after Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi, who played a major role in establishing the modern Hindi language in poetry and broadening the acceptable subjects of the Hindi poetry from the traditional ones of religion and romantic love. He encouraged poetry in Hindi dedicated to nationalism and social reform.Lucy (aka \\"Ludmila\\") Rosenstein, editor, translator, author of the \\"Introduction\\", New Poetry in Hindi: Nayi Kavita: An Introduction, Anthem Press, 2004, Dwivedi became the editor of Saraswati in 1903, the first Hindi monthly magazine of India, which was established in 1900. He used it to crusade for reforms in the Hindi literature. One of the most prominent poems of the period was Maithili Sharan Gupt's Bharat-bharati, which evokes the past glory of India. Shridhar Prathak's Bharatgit is another renowned poem of the period. Some scholars have labelled much of the poetry of this period as \\"versified propaganda\\". According to Lucy Rosenstein: \\"It is verse of public statement; its language is functional but aesthetically unappealing. Earnestly concerned with social issues and moral values, it is puritanical poetry in which aesthetic considerations are secondary. Imagination, originality, poetic sensibility and expression are wanting, the metre is restrictive, the idiom clumsy.\\" She adds, however, that the period was important for laying the foundations to the modern Hindi poetry and that it did reflect sensitivity to social issues of the time. However, she also adds that the inelegance is a typical feature of a \\"young\\" poetry, as she considers Modern Hindi. Without a poetic tradition in modern Hindi, poets often modeled their forms on Braj, and later on Sanskrit, Urdu, Bengali and English forms, often ill-suited to Hindi. The subjects of the poems tended to be communal rather than personal. Characters were often presented not as individuals but as social types. Chhayavaadi Yug In the 20th century, Hindi literature saw a romantic upsurge. This is known as Chhayavaad (shadowism) and the literary figures belonging to this school are known as Chhayavaadi. Jaishankar Prasad, Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala', Mahadevi Varma and Sumitranandan Pant, are the four major Chhayavaadi poets. Poet Ramdhari Singh 'Dinkar' was another great poet with some Chayavaadi element in his poetry although he wrote in other genres as well. This period of Neo-romanticism, represents the adolescence of Hindi Poetry. It is marked by beauty of expression and flow of intense emotion. The four representative poets of this era represent the best in Hindi Poetry. A unique feature of this period is the emotional (and sometimes active) attachment of poets with national freedom struggle, their effort to understand and imbibe the vast spirit of a magnificent ancient culture and their towering genius which grossly overshadowed all the literary 'talked abouts' of next seven decades. Other important genres of Adhunik Sahitya (Modernism) are: Prayogvad (Experimentalism) of Ajneya and the Tar Saptak poets, also known as Nayi Kavita (New Poetry) and Nayi Kahani (New Story) of Nirmal Verma and others; followed by Pragativad (Progressivism) of Gajanan Madhav Muktibodh and other authors.Indian Poets Writing In Hindi Nakenwad Among the numerous schools of poetry which sprang up in the fifties of this century was Nakenwad, a school deriving its nomenclature from the first letters of the names of its three pioneers ‚Äì Nalin Vilochan Sharma, Kesari Kumar, and Naresh Mehta all poets of note in their own right. Apart from being poets, Nalin Vilochan and Kesari Kumar were also brilliant critics, with a wide perspective on literary history. Their critical attitude is marked by a synthesis or coordination of various disciplines of human knowledge ‚Äì philosophy, history, art and culture, all pressed into the service of literary appraisal and analysis. =Genres of Hindi Literature= =Hindi Kavita (Poetry)= Hindi has a rich legacy of poetry. There are several genres of Kavita based on Ras, Chhand and Alankar e.g. Shringar, Karun, Veer, HƒÅsya etc. Hasya Kavita is humorous comic poetry in Hindi. It is particularly famous due to Hindi kavi sammelans. Bal Kavita is children's rhymes in Hindi. Many attempts have been made to document Hindi poetry. Some of the most comprehensive online collections for Hindi poetry are Kavitakosh and Geeta- Kavita. The most classy content that has created new audiences who were not looking for Hindi poetry or Hindi content is Hindi Kavita. This movement started in 2014 by Manish Gupta has generated an entirely new market and brought many projects to the fore. Many award-winning poets, scholars, journalists and celebrities from Film, Television and Theatre have come forward to support the cause and take it further. =Vyangya (Hindi Satire)= The rhetoric of satire is called Vyangya in Hindi. Vyangya writings includes the essence of sarcasm and humour. Some of the better known writers in this genre are, Harishankar Parsai(Hindi: ‡§π‡§∞‡§ø‡§∂‡§Ç‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§™‡§∞‡§∏‡§æ‡§à) (August 22, 1924 ‚Äì 1995) was a Hindi writer. He was a noted satirist and humorist of modern Hindi literature and is known for his simple and direct style., Sri Lal Sukla, Suryakumar Pandey etc.http://www.amarujala.com/news/samachar/reflections/vyang/satire-on- election/ =Hindi travel literature= Rahul Sankrityayan, Bhadant Anand Kausalyayan, Sachchidananda Hirananda Vatsyayan 'Ajneya' and Baba Nagarjun were some of the great Indian writers who dedicated themselves entirely to the Hindi Travel Literature (Yatra Vritanta). Rahul Sankrityayan was one of the greatest travelled scholars of India, spending forty-five years of his life on travels away from his home. He is known as the (\\"Father of Hindi Travel literature\\"). Baba Nagarjun was a major Hindi and Maithili poet who has also penned a number of novels, short stories, literary biographies and travelogues, and was known as (\\"Janakavi- the People's Poet\\"). =Hindi playwriting= The pioneer of Hindi theatre as well as playwrighting, Bhartendu Harishchandra wrote Satya Harishchandra (1875), Bharat Durdasha (1876) and Andher Nagari (1878), in the late 19th century, Jaishankar Prasad became the next big figure in Hindi playwriting with plays like Skanda Gupta (1928), Chandragupta (1931) and Dhruvswamini (1933).Dimitrova, p. 15Datta, p. 1075 As the Independence struggle was gathering steam playwrights broaching issues of nationalism and subversive ideas against the British, yet to dodge censorship they adapted themes from mythology, history and legend and used them as vehicle for political messages, a trend that continues to date, though now it was employed to bring out social, personal and psychological issues rather than clearly political, though street theatre broke this trend in coming decades in post-independence era, like IPTA-inspired, Naya Theatre of Habib Tanvir did in the 1950s‚Äì90s, Jana Natya Manch of Safdar Hashmi did in the 1970s‚Äì80s. Post-independence the emerging republic threw up new issues for playwrights to tackle and express, and Hindi playwriting showed greater brevity and symbolism, but it was not as prolific as in case with Hindi poetry or fiction.Nagendra, p. 661 Yet we have playwrights like Jagdish Chandra Mathur (Konark) and Upendranath Ashk (Anjo Didi), who displayed a steadily evolving understanding of stagecraft. These were followed another generation of pioneers in Hindi playwrighting, Mohan Rakesh, who started with Ashadh Ka Ek Din (1958), Adhe Adhure and Lehron Ke Rajhans, Dharamvir Bharati, who wrote Andha Yug, and other playwrights like Surendra Verma, and Bhisham Sahni. =Hindi essay-writing= Kuber Nath Rai is one of the writers who dedicated themselves entirely to the form of essay-writing. His collections of essays Gandha Madan, Priya neel-kanti, Ras Aakhetak, Vishad Yog, Nishad Bansuri, Parna mukut have enormously enriched the form of essay. A scholar of Indian culture and western literature, he was proud of Indian heritage. His love for natural beauty and Indian folk literatures and preference for agricultural society over the age of machines, his romantic outlook, aesthetic sensibility, his keen eye on contemporary reality and classical style place him very high among contemporary essayists in Hindi.

Published Kavi Vachan Sudha (1867) a monthly dedicated to ancient and medieval poetry. Published Harishchandra Magazine in 1873 ‚Äì a general interest magazine. Published Bala Bodhini from 1874 ‚Äì for women and young girls. KVS was acknowledged to be the finest literary journal in any Indian language of that time, and was on par with the best of English journals. Bharatendu kept the journal up until his death 1885. Because of his extraordinary achievements, he is considered the most prolific Hindi journalist. Madan Mohan Malaviya Madan Mohan Malaviya was born in 1861 in Allahabad to a Brahmin family. From 1885 to 1887 was the editor of Indian Opinion. He was a strong supporter of the Congress. He helped launch the newspaper Dainik Hindustan and was its editor from 1887 to 1889. He was a close friend of many eminent Hindi writers like Gopalram Gehmari, Amrutlal Chakravarty and Pandit Pratap Narayan Mishra. Along with Bal Mukund Gupta, he launched an Urdu journal 'Kohinoor' from Lahore. In those days, Gupta was not a facile Hindi scholar, but under Malviya's training, Gupta became editor of Bharat Mitra. In 1908, Malviya founded a new revolutionary journal Abhyudaya from Prayag. The renowned writer Purushottam Das Tandon was a frequent contributor to it. After Abhyudaya, Malviya founded a monthly magazine 'Maryada', in 1909 he founded a daily 'Leader' and later on another daily ‚Äì 'Bharat'. Malviya was a great patriot and his love for his country was seen in all of his writings. He also contributed to Aaj, and helped to found the Hindustan Times in 1933, along with its Hindi counterpart Hindustan. Babu Gulabrai (17 January 1888 ‚Äì 13 April 1963) (pen name: Gulabrai MA) was one of the greatest literary figures of modern Hindi literature. Durgaprasad Mishra Born in Kashmir, he came to Calcutta and started Bharat Mitra in 1878. In 1879, he began another weekly magazine- Saar Sudhanidhi but it closed down in that same year. On 17 August 1880, he started a 3rd weekly- Ucchit Vakta- meaning Right or Best Time. Ucchit Vakta focused on spreading the truth (about the British Raj) and fighting for justice. It became very popular for many years. Mishra underwent a lot of difficulties trying to bring out a critical publication at the time of the British Raj. At times he was the editor, writer and also sold the paper himself. He was an inspiration for many journalists, particularly Bal Mukund Gupta. Dharmvir Bharati Born on 25 December 1926, Dharamvir Bharati graduated in BA (first class) in 1945 and in 1947 completed his MA in Hindi literature (first class) and finally did his PhD from Allahabad University. For some time he was principal of Allahabad University. He began his journalist career in Abhyudaya, a journal by Padmakant Malviya. He then joined Sangam, edited by Ilachand Joshi and then became editor of Dharmayug. Thanks to Bharati, this journal became very popular. During the 1971 war, Bharati reported from the frontlines of the battle. He covered all the horrors of the war. His series of reports, the finest in Hindi war journalism, were published under the title of 'Yudh Yatra'. As an honest and dedicated reporter, Bharati was unrivaled. After the war, he became editor of 2 more journals- Aalochana and Nikarshak. Bharati was also famous as a short story writer, poet, essayist and novelist. The best known of his works are 'Band Galli ka Aakhiri Makaan', 'Andha Yug', 'Kunpriya'.

It is located northeast of Charing Cross. Most of the housing in Hainault was built by the London County Council between 1947 and 1953. Originally spanning the parishes of Chigwell, Dagenham and Ilford, in 1965 the area was combined in a single London borough and became part of Greater London. It is adjacent to the Metropolitan Green Belt, bordered on the east by Hainault Forest Country Park and to the north by open land and the boundary with the Epping Forest District of Essex. For postal addresses, it is split between the Chigwell and Ilford post towns and it is within the London 020 telephone area code. The area is served by London Underground's Central Line. History =Toponymy= The name Hainault was recorded as 'Henehout' in 1221 and 'Hyneholt' in 1239. It is Old English and means 'wood belonging to a religious community', referring to the ownership of Hainault Forest, part of the larger Epping Forest, by Barking Abbey. The spelling was altered from the 17th century because of a false connection to Philippa of Hainault, the wife of Edward III. =Development= The area was mainly forested, it was owned by Barking Abbey and formed part of the Royal Forest of Essex. The large density of forest meant the area was predominately used for the provision of timber for building ships and houses. A decline in demand for timber, and a greater demand for food, led in 1851 to an Act of Parliament authorising the deforestation of much of Hainault Forest. Within six weeks 3,000 acres of woodland was cleared.http://www.hainaultforest.co.uk/3Forest%20of%20Essex.htm Urban development began after August 1856, when the Great Eastern Railway built a line between Stratford and Loughton. In 1903, from the line at Woodford Junction, a loop line to Ilford was opened. Hainault was one of the stations on that line. Although it had been hoped that housing development would follow from the building of the railway, it took several decades. Hainault station was closed from 1908, five years after opening; development began in the late 1920s, and the station was reopened in 1930. As a result of the London Passenger Transport Board New Works Programme 1935‚Äì40 (not completed until 1948) the line was taken over from the LNER and converted for use by London Underground trains. Because of the lack of available land in the County of London, the London County Council (LCC) was permitted to build housing and act as landlord outside of its territory. It purchased land in Chigwell, Dagenham, and Ilford in 1943. Building of the Hainault Estate commenced after the Second World War from 1947 to 1953. The development of 2,779 houses was in the style known as a 'cottage estate' with the names of the roads relating to the history of Hainault Forest. =Local government= After the development of the Hainault Estate, the area was within three local government districts. Most of Hainault was split between the Chigwell Urban District and the Municipal Borough of Ilford, with a small part to the east within the Municipal Borough of Dagenham. The population of the Chigwell part of the estate was 7,071 in 1961.Vision of Britain - Chigwell UD The whole area formed part of the review area of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London. It was recommended by the commission that the three districts should become part of Greater London. During the passage of the London Government Act 1963 Chigwell became excluded from the new administrative area, which would have led to the estate being split by a county boundary. Instead, the opportunity was taken to unite the estate in a single London Borough of Redbridge, by combining the of the estate in Chigwell with the northern section of Dagenham and the whole of the boroughs of Ilford and Wanstead and Woodford. Government Three councillors are elected to represent the Hainault ward on Redbridge London Borough Council. Geography For postal addresses, it is split between the Chigwell and Ilford post towns in the IG postcode area.Royal Mail, Address Management Guide, (2004) It is within the London 020 telephone area code, with the Hainault telephone exchange located just outside the Greater London boundary in Grange Hill. Nearest places are Goodmayes Chigwell, Collier Row, Barkingside and Chadwell Heath. Demographics The largest ethnic group in the Hainault ward of Redbridge in the 2011 census was White British, at 60.7% of the population.http://www.ukcensusdata.com/hainault-e05000506 This was followed by Other White at 8.4% of the population and Black African at 5.7%. 55.9% of the population identified as Christians, with 8.6% of the population identifying as Muslim and 7% not stating a religion.http://www.ukcensusdata.com/hainault-e05000506 Transport The nearest London Underground stations are Hainault and Grange Hill on the Central line. The area is directly served by London bus routes 150, 247, 362, 462, and N8 Sport Hainault Athletic Football Club play in the Essex Sunday Combination League and have two teams of players. Manford Way FC was formed in 1946 (The 1st year it was known as Chigwell Labour Club) They played on a field opposite Grange Crescent, near Grange Hill Station, now houses, the Club currently play in the Essex Olympian League.

From August 25, 1991 to January 26, 1994, he was the first head of state of independent Belarus after it seceded from the Soviet Union, serving as Chairman of the Supreme Soviet (also called chairman of Parliament or president). He supported social democratic reforms and played a key role in the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States. As a scientist, he is a corresponding member of the Belarusian Academy of Sciences, Doctor in Physics and Mathematics, recipient of various state awards, professor and the author and originator of textbooks and over 150 articles and 50 inventions. Overview Shushkevich was born on December 15, 1934 in Minsk. His parents were teachers who came from peasant families. His father, Stanislav Petrovich Shushkevich (born February 19, 1908 in Minsk) was arrested in the 1930s and was released from prison in 1956. His mother Helena Romanowska was ethnically Polish and her family had szlachta (noble) roots. In the early 1960s, while working as an engineer in an electronics factory, he was in charge of teaching Lee Harvey Oswald Russian when Oswald lived in Minsk. Shushkevich has been married to his wife Irina since 1976. According to him, she forced him to start a healthy lifestyle. He has a son named Stanislav and daughter named Elena. Political activity When Supreme Soviet chairman Mikalay Dzyemyantsyey was ousted for his support of the 25 August coup attempt, Shushkevich was voted as his successor, and presided over Byelorussia voting to secede from the Soviet Union. He thus became the newly minted nation's first leader. When the republic changed its name to Belarus on 25 September, Shushkevich was voted as Supreme Soviet chairman on a permanent basis. On December 8, 1991, in Belavezhskaya Pushcha and together with the leaders of Russia (Boris Yeltsin) and Ukraine (Leonid Kravchuk), he signed a declaration that the Soviet Union was dissolved and replaced by the Commonwealth of Independent States; the declaration later became known as the \\"Belavezha Accords\\". Shushkevich withdrew from Belarus the vestigial Soviet nuclear arsenal (both tactical and strategic), without preconditions or compensation from Russia or the West. However, other reforms became stalled due to the opposition from a hostile parliament as well as from Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich. In late 1993, Alexander Lukashenko, the then-chairman of the anti- corruption committee of the Belarusian parliament, accused 70 senior government officials, including Shushkevich, of corruption, including stealing state funds for personal purposes. Lukashenko's accusations (taking two boxes of nails for his Dacha) forced a vote of confidence, which Shushkevich lost. Shushkevich was replaced by Vyacheslav Kuznetsov and later by Myechyslau Hryb. The accusations against Shushkevich turned out to be without merit.Andrew Savchenko, \\"Belarus: a Perpetual Borderland\\", 2009, , p. 179 Stanislav Shushkevich at the signing of the Belavezha Accords with Leonid Kravchuk and Boris Yeltsin in 1991 In July, 1994 the first direct presidential elections were held in Belarus. Six candidates stood, including Lukashenko, Shushkevich and Kebich, with the latter regarded as the clear favorite. In the first round Lukashenko won 45% of the vote against 17% for Kebich, 13% for Paznyak and 10% for Shushkevich. In 2002 the world learned about a highly unusual court case. Shushkevich sued the Belarusian Ministry of Labor and Social Security: due to inflation, his retirement pension as a former head of state was the equivalent of US$1.80 monthly. To earn income, Shushkevich lectures extensively in foreign universities including in Poland, the United States and Asian countries. In 2004 he attempted to participate in parliamentary elections, but was refused registration by the electoral commission. He continues to be active in politics, heading the Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly party.

The long-time president of the Nahdlatul Ulama and the founder of the National Awakening Party (PKB), Wahid was the first elected president of Indonesia after the resignation of Suharto in 1998. His popular nickname Gus Dur, is derived from Gus, a common honorific for a son of kyai, from short-form of bagus ('handsome lad' in Javanese language); and Dur, short-form of his name, Abdurrahman. Early life Abdurrahman Wahid in his youth, ca. 1960s Abdurrahman ad-Dakhil was born on the fourth day of the eighth month of the Islamic calendar in 1940 in Jombang, East Java to Abdul Wahid Hasyim and Siti Sholehah. This led to a belief that he was born on 4 August; instead, using the Islamic calendar to mark his birth date meant that he was actually born on 4 Sha'aban, equivalent to 7 September 1940. He was named after Abd ar-Rahman I of the Umayyad Caliphate who brought Islam to Spain and was thus nicknamed \\"ad-Dakhil\\" (\\"the conqueror\\"). His name is stylized in the traditional Arabic naming system as \\"Abdurrahman, son of Wahid\\". His family is ethnically Javanese of mixed Chinese-Arab origins with some native blood. From his paternal line, he is descended from a well-known Moslem missionary from China known as Syekh Abdul Qadir Tan Kiem Han who was a disciple of Sunan Ngampel-Denta (Raden Rahmat Bong Swie Hoo) ‚Äì one of the Nine Wali (Holy Islamic Saints) who became one of the first Islamic Kings on Java who islamicized Java in the 15-16th centuries. He was the oldest of his five siblings, and was born into a very prestigious family in the East Java Muslim community. His paternal grandfather, Hasyim Asy'ari was the founder of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) while his maternal grandfather, Bisri Syansuri was the first Muslim educator to introduce classes for women.Barton (2002), pages 38‚Äì40 Wahid's father, Wahid Hasyim, was involved in the nationalist movement and would go on to be Indonesia's first Minister of Religious Affairs. In 1943, Wahid moved from Jombang to Jakarta where his father was involved with the Consultative Council of Indonesian Muslims (Masyumi), an organization established by the Imperial Japanese Army which occupied Indonesia at the time. After the Indonesian Declaration of Independence on 17 August 1945, Wahid moved back to Jombang and remained there during the fight for independence from the Netherlands during the Indonesian National Revolution. At the end of the war in 1949, Wahid moved to Jakarta as his father had been appointed Minister of Religious Affairs. He was educated in Jakarta, going to KRIS Primary School before moving to Matraman Perwari Primary School. Wahid was also encouraged to read non-Muslim books, magazines, and newspapers by his father to further broaden his horizons.Barton (2002), page 49 He stayed in Jakarta with his family even after his father's removal as Minister of Religious Affairs in 1952. In April 1953, Wahid's father died in a car crash. In 1954, Wahid began Junior High School. That year, he failed to graduate to the next year and was forced to repeat. His mother then made the decision to send him to Yogyakarta to continue his education. In 1957, after graduating from Junior High School, he moved to Magelang to begin Muslim Education at Tegalrejo Pesantren (Muslim school). He completed the pesantren course in two years instead of the usual four. In 1959, he moved back to Jombang to Pesantren Tambakberas. There, while continuing his own education, Wahid also received his first job as a teacher and later on as headmaster of a madrasah affiliated with the pesantren. Wahid also found employment as a journalist for magazines such as Horizon and Majalah Budaya Jaya. Abdurrahman standing between his mother and father, and behind his siblings and a friend of the family, circa 1952. Overseas education In 1963, Wahid received a scholarship from the Ministry of Religious Affairs to study at Al Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt. He left for Egypt in November 1963. Unable to provide evidence to certify that he spoke Arabic, Wahid was told when arriving that he would have to take a remedial class in the language before enrolling at the University's Higher Institute for Islamic and Arabic studies. Instead of attending classes, Wahid spent 1964 enjoying life in Egypt; watching European and American movies as well indulging in his hobby of watching football. Wahid was also involved with the Association of Indonesian Students and became a journalist for the association's magazine. After passing the remedial Arabic examination, he finally began studies at the Higher Institute for Islamic and Arabic Studies in 1965, but was disappointed as he had already studied many of the texts offered at the Institute in Java and disapproved of the rote learning method used by the University.Barton (2002), page 88 In Egypt, Wahid found employment with the Indonesian Embassy. It was during his stint with the embassy that coup attempt was launched by the 30 September Movement, which the Communist Party of Indonesia was accused of leading. With Army Strategic Reserves commander Major General Suharto taking control of the situation in Jakarta, a crackdown against suspected communists was initiated. The Indonesian Embassy in Egypt was ordered to conduct an investigation into the political views of university students. This order was passed to Wahid, who was charged with writing the reports.Barton (2002), page 89 Wahid's displeasure at the method of education and his work following the coup attempt distracted him from his studies. He sought and received another scholarship at the University of Baghdad and moved to Iraq. There Wahid continued his involvement with the Association of Indonesian Students as well as with writing journalistic pieces to be read in Indonesia. After completing his education at the University of Baghdad in 1970, Wahid went to the Netherlands to continue his education. He wanted to attend Leiden University but was disappointed as there was little recognition for the studies that he had undertaken at the University of Baghdad. From the Netherlands, He went to Germany and France before returning to Indonesia in 1971. Early career Wahid returned to Jakarta expecting that in a year's time, he would be abroad again to study at McGill University in Canada. He kept himself busy by joining the Institute for Economic and Social Research, Education and Information (LP3ES),Barton, page 103 an organization which consisted of intellectuals with progressive Muslims and social-democratic views. LP3ES established the magazine Prisma and Wahid became one of the main contributors to the magazine. Whilst working as a contributor for LP3ES, he also conducted tours to pesantren and madrasah across Java. It was a time when pesantren were desperate to gain state funding by adopting state-endorsed curricula and Wahid was concerned that the traditional values of the pesantren were being damaged because of this change. He was also concerned with the poverty of the pesantren which he saw during his tours. At the same time as it was encouraging pesantren to adopt state-endorsed curricula, the Government was also encouraging pesantren as agents for change and to help assist the government in the economic development of Indonesia. It was at this time that Wahid finally decided to drop plans for overseas studies in favor of promoting the development of the pesantren. Wahid continued his career as a journalist, writing for the magazine Tempo and Kompas, a leading Indonesian newspaper. His articles were well received, and he began to develop a reputation as a social commentator. Wahid's popularity was such that at this time he was invited to give lectures and seminars, obliging him to travel back and forth between Jakarta and Jombang, where he now lived with his family. Despite having a successful career up to that point, Wahid still found it hard to make ends meet, and he worked to earn extra income by selling peanuts and delivering ice to be used for his wife's Es Lilin (popsicle) business.Barton, page 108 In 1974, he found extra employment in Jombang as a Muslim Legal Studies teacher at Pesantren Tambakberas and soon developed a good reputation. A year later, Wahid added to his workload as a teacher of Kitab al-Hikam, a classical text of sufism. In 1977, Wahid joined the Hasyim Asyari University as Dean of the Faculty of Islamic Beliefs and Practices. Again he excelled in his job and the University wanted to him to teach extra subjects such as pedagogy, sharia, and missiology. However, his excellence caused some resentment from within the ranks of university and he was blocked from teaching the subjects. Whilst undertaking all these ventures he also regularly delivered speeches during Ramadan to the Muslim community in Jombang. Leader of Nahdlatul Ulama =Early involvement with NU= Wahid's family background meant that sooner or later, he would be asked to play an active role in the running of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU). This ran contrary to Wahid's aspirations of becoming a public intellectual and he had twice rejected offers to join the NU Religious Advisory Council. Nevertheless, Wahid finally chose to join the Council when his own grandfather, Bisri Syansuri gave him the third offer.Barton (2002), page 112 In taking this job, Wahid also made the decision to move from Jombang to Jakarta and to permanently reside there. As a member of the Religious Advisory Council, Wahid envisioned himself as a reformer of NU. At this time, Wahid also had his first political experience. In the lead-up to the 1982 Legislative Elections, Wahid campaigned for the United Development Party (PPP), an Islamist Party which was formed as a result of a merger of four Islamist parties including NU. Wahid recalled that the Government actively disrupted PPP's campaigns by arresting people like himself.Barton (2002), pages 133‚Äì134 However, Wahid was always able to secure his release, having developed connections in high places with the likes of General Benny Moerdani. =Reforming NU= By this time, many viewed the NU as a stagnant organization. After careful discussion, the Religious Advisory Council finally formed a Team of Seven (which included Wahid) to tackle the issues of reform and to help revitalize the NU. For some members of the NU, reform in the organization involved a change of leadership. On 2 May 1982, a group of high- ranking NU officials met with NU chairman Idham Chalid and asked for his resignation. Idham, who had guided the NU in the transition from Sukarno to Suharto resisted at first but bowed down to pressure. On 6 May 1982, Wahid heard of Idham's decision to resign and approached him saying that the demands being made for him to resign were unconstitutional. With urging from Wahid, Idham withdrew his resignation and Wahid, together with the Team of Seven was able to negotiate a compromise between Idham and those who had asked for his resignation.Barton (2002), page 136 In 1983, Suharto was re-elected to a fourth term as president by the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) and began taking steps to establish the Pancasila state ideology as the sole basis for all organizations. From June 1983 to October 1983, Wahid was part of a team which was commissioned to prepare the NU's response to this issue. Wahid consulted texts such as the Quran and Sunnah for justification and finally, in October 1983, concluded that the NU should accept Pancasila as its ideology.Barton, page 138 To further revitalize the NU, Wahid was also successful in securing its withdrawal from PPP and party politics to allow it focus on social matters instead of hampering itself by being involved in politics. =Election to chairmanship and first term as chairman= Wahid's reforms had made him extremely popular within the ranks of NU. By the time of the 1984 National Congress, many began to state their intentions to nominate Wahid as the new chairman of NU. Wahid accepted the nomination, provided that he had the power to choose who would be on his leadership team. Wahid was elected as the new chairman of NU during the National Congress. However, his stipulation of choosing his own team was not honored. The last day of the Congress had begun with Wahid's list of team members being approved by high- ranking NU officials including outgoing Chairman Idham. Wahid had gone to the Committee in charge of running the Congress and handed in his list which was to be announced later. However, the Committee in question was against Idham and announced a totally different list of people. Wahid was outraged but was pressured to accept the changes made.Barton, page 143 Wahid's ascendancy to the NU chairmanship was seen positively by Suharto and his New Order regime. Wahid's acceptance of Pancasila along with his moderate image won him favor among Government ranks. In 1985, Suharto made Wahid a Pancasila indoctrinator.Barton (2002), pages 153‚Äì154 In 1987, Wahid showed further support for the regime by criticizing PPP in the lead-up to the 1987 Legislative Elections and further strengthening Suharto's Golkar Party. His reward came in the form of a membership of the MPR. Although he was viewed with favor by the regime, Wahid criticised the Government over the Kedung Ombo Dam project that was funded by the World Bank. Although this somewhat soured the cordial relationships that Wahid had with the Government, Suharto was still keen on getting political support from NU. During his first term as chairman of NU, Wahid focused on reform of the pesantren education system and was successful in increasing the quality of pesantren education system so that it can match up with secular schools.Barton, page 162 In 1987, Wahid also set up study groups in Probolinggo, East Java to provide a forum for like-minded individuals within NU to discuss and provide interpretations to Muslim texts.Barton, pages 165‚Äì166 Critics accused Wahid of wishing to replace the Arabic Muslim greeting of \\"assalamualaikum\\" with the secular greeting of \\"selamat pagi\\", which means good morning in Indonesian. =Second term as chairman and opposing the New Order= Wahid was re-elected to a second term as chairman of NU at the 1989 National Congress. By this time, Suharto, embroiled in a political battle with ABRI, began to ingratiate himself with the Muslim constituency so as to win their support. This venture reached a turning point in December 1990 with the formation of the Indonesian Association of Muslim Intellectuals (Ikatan Cendekiawan Muslim Indonesia or ICMI). This organization was backed by Suharto, chaired by BJ Habibie and included Muslim intellectuals such as Amien Rais and Nurcholish Madjid as its members. In 1991, various members of ICMI asked Wahid to join. Wahid declined because he thought that ICMI encouraged sectarianism and that it was mainly a means by which Suharto manoeuvred to remain powerful.Barton (2002), page 183 In 1991, Wahid countered ICMI by forming the Democracy Forum, an organization which contained 45 intellectuals from various religious and social communities. The organization was seen as a threat by the government, which moved to break up meetings held by the Democracy Forum during the run-up to the 1992 Legislative Elections approached. In March 1992, Wahid planned to have a Great Assembly to celebrate the 66th anniversary of the founding of NU and to reiterate the organization's support for Pancasila. Wahid had planned for the event to be attended by at least one million NU members. However, Suharto moved to block the event, ordering policemen to turn back busloads of NU members as they arrived in Jakarta. Nevertheless, the event managed to attract 200,000 attendants. After the event, Wahid wrote a letter of protest to Suharto saying that NU had not been given a chance to display a brand of Islam that was open, fair, and tolerant.Barton, page 187 During his second term as chairman of NU, Wahid's liberal ideas had begun to turn many supporters sour. As chairman, Wahid continued to push for inter-faith dialogue and even accepted an invitation to visit Israel in October 1994.Barton (2002), page 198 =Third term as chairman and the lead-up to Reformasi= As the 1994 National Congress approached, Wahid nominated himself for a third term as chairman. Hearing this, Suharto wanted to make sure that Wahid was not elected. In the weeks leading up to the Congress, Suharto supporters, such as Habibie and Harmoko campaigned against Wahid's re-election. When it came time for the National Congress, the site for the Congress was tightly guarded by ABRI in an act of intimidation.Barton (2002), page 203 Despite this, and attempts to bribe NU members to vote against him, Wahid was re-elected as NU chairman for a third term. During his third term, Wahid began to move closer towards a political alliance with Megawati Sukarnoputri from the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI). Capitalizing on her father's legacy, Megawati had a lot of popularity and intended to put political and moral pressure on Suharto's regime. Wahid advised Megawati to be cautious and to avoid being nominated as president during the 1998 MPR General Session. Megawati ignored Wahid's advice and paid the price in July 1996 when her PDI headquarters were taken over by supporters of Government-backed PDI chairman, Suryadi. Seeing what happened to Megawati, Wahid thought that his best option now was to retreat politically by getting himself back in favor with the Government. In November 1996, Wahid and Suharto met for the first time since Wahid's re- election to the NU chairmanship and this was followed over the next few months by meetings with various Government people who in 1994 had attempted to block Wahid's re-election.Barton (2002), pages 221‚Äì222 At the same time, however, Wahid kept his options for reform open and in December 1996, had a meeting with Amien Rais, an ICMI member who had grown critical of the regime. July 1997 saw the beginning of the Asian Financial Crisis. Suharto began to lose control of the situation and just as he was being pushed to step up the reform movement with Megawati and Amien, Wahid suffered a stroke in January 1998. From his hospital bed, Wahid continued to see the situation worsen with Suharto's re-election to a seventh term as president accompanied by student protests. The protests would turn into riots in May 1998 after the killing of four students at Trisakti University. On 19 May 1998, Wahid, together with eight prominent leaders from the Muslim community were summoned to Suharto's residence. Suharto outlined the idea of a Reform Committee which he had begun to propose at the time. All nine rejected Suharto's offer to join the Reform Committee. Wahid maintained a more moderate stance with Suharto and called on the protesting to stop to see if Suharto was going to implement his promise.Barton (2002), page 243 This displeased Amien who was one of the most vocal of Suharto's critics at the time. Nevertheless, support for Suharto quickly ebbed away and on 21 May 1998 he resigned the presidency. Vice President Habibie became President. Reformasi =Formation of PKB and the Ciganjur statement= One of the immediate effects of Suharto's fall was the formation of new political parties. Under Suharto's regime, political parties had been limited to just three; Golkar, PPP, and PDI. Now with his fall, new political parties were formed, the most prominent of which were Amien's National Mandate Party (PAN) and Megawati's Indonesian Democratic Party- Struggle (PDI-P). In June 1998, many from within the NU community began pressuring Wahid to form a new political party. Wahid did not warm up to the idea immediately, thinking that this would result in a political party which only catered to one religion. He was also unwilling to overrule his own decision to take NU out of politics. By July 1998, however, he began to warm up to the idea, thinking that establishing a political party was the only way to challenge the organizationally strong Golkar in an election. With that in mind, Wahid approved of the formation of PKB and became the chairman of its Advisory Council with Matori Abdul Djalil as party chairman. Although it was clearly dominated by NU members, Wahid promoted the PKB as a party that was non-sectarian and open to all members of society. As opposition to the government, Wahid, together with Megawati and Amien were willing to adopt a moderate stance towards Habibie's Government, preferring instead to wait for the 1999 legislative elections.Barton (2002), page 255 Nevertheless, in November 1998, in a meeting at his residence in the Jakarta suburb of Ciganjur, Wahid, together with Megawati, Amien, and Sultan Hamengkubuwono X reiterated their commitment to reform. On 7 February 1999, PKB officially declared Wahid as their presidential candidate. =1999 elections and MPR General Session= Amien Rais and Abdurrahman Wahid converse during a session of the MPR. In June 1999, Wahid's PKB entered the legislative elections. The PKB won 12% of the votes with Megawati's PDI‚ÄìP winning the legislative elections with 33% of the votes. With her party decisively winning the legislative elections, Megawati expected to win the presidency against Habibie at the MPR General Session. However, the PDI-P did not have complete majority and formed a loose alliance with the PKB. In July, however, Amien Rais would form the Central Axis, a coalition of Muslim parties.Barton (2002), page 275 The Central Axis then began to consider nominating Wahid as a third candidate in the presidential race and the PKB's commitment towards PDI-P began to waver. In October 1999, the MPR convened and Wahid threw his support behind Amien, who was elected as the chairman of the MPR. On 7 October 1999, Amien and the Central Axis, who now had the PKB on their side, officially nominated Wahid as a presidential candidate.Barton, pages 281 On 19 October 1999, the MPR rejected Habibie's accountability speech and Habibie withdrew from the presidential race. In the hours that followed, Akbar Tanjung, chairman of Golkar and head of the People's Representative Council (DPR) made it clear that Golkar would support Wahid in his bid for the presidency. On 20 October 1999, the MPR convened and began voting for a new president. Wahid was elected as Indonesia's fourth president with 373 votes to Megawati's 313 votes. Displeased that their candidate had not won the presidency, Megawati's supporters began to riot. Wahid realized that for this to stop, Megawati had to be elected as vice president. After convincing General Wiranto not to contest vice presidential elections and getting the PKB to endorse Megawati, Wahid persuaded the demoralized Megawati to stand. On 21 October 1999, Megawati defeated the PPP's Hamzah Haz and was inaugurated as vice president. Presidency =1999= Another version of Wahid's official presidential portrait Wahid's first Cabinet, dubbed the National Unity Cabinet, was a coalition cabinet which consisted of members of various political parties: PDI-P, PKB, Golkar, PPP, PAN, and the Justice Party (PK). Non-partisans and the TNI (Formerly known as ABRI) were also represented in the Cabinet. Wahid then went on to make two administrative reforms. The first administrative reform was to abolish the Ministry of Information, the Suharto regime's main weapon in controlling the media, while the second administrative reform was to disband the Ministry of Welfare which had become corrupt and extortionist under the Suharto regime.Barton, pages 290 In November, Wahid made his first overseas trip, visiting ASEAN member countries, Japan, the United States of America, Qatar, Kuwait, and Jordan. He followed this up in December by a visit to the People's Republic of China. Barton (2002), pages 288‚Äì290 After only a month in the National Unity Cabinet, Coordinating Minister of People's Welfare Hamzah Haz announced his resignation in November. There was suspicion that the resignation was brought about by Wahid's allegation that certain members of his Cabinet were involved in corruption while he was still in America. Others suggested that Hamzah's resignation was because of displeasure due to Wahid's conciliatory stance towards Israel. Wahid's plan in Aceh was to give it a referendum. However, this referendum would be to decide on various modes of autonomy rather than to decide on independence like in East Timor. Wahid also wanted to adopt a softer stance towards Aceh by having fewer military personnel on the ground. On 30 December, Wahid visited Jayapura in the Province which was then known as Irian Jaya. During his visit, Wahid was successful in convincing West Papuan leaders that he was a force for change and even encouraged the use of the name Papua.Barton, pages 293 =2000= Wahid at the 2000 annual meeting of the World Economic Forum In January, Wahid made another overseas trip to Switzerland to attend the World Economic Forum and visited Saudi Arabia on the way back to Indonesia. In February, Wahid made another trip to Europe visiting the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy. On the way back to Europe, Wahid also visited India, South Korea, Thailand, and Brunei. March saw Wahid visit East Timor. In April, Wahid visited South Africa en route to the G77 summit in Cuba before returning via Mexico City and Hong Kong. In June, Wahid once again visited America, Japan, and France with Iran, Pakistan, and Egypt as the new additions to the list of countries which he had visited.Barton (2002), page 294, pp. 297‚Äì298, p.308 Cabinet dismissals While he was travelling to Europe in February, Wahid began asking for the resignation of General Wiranto, who held the position of Coordinating Minister of Politics and Security. Wahid saw Wiranto both as an obstacle to his planned reform of the Military as well as being a liability to his Government with his human rights abuses in East Timor. When Wahid arrived back in Jakarta, Wiranto talked to him and seemed successful in convincing Wahid not to replace him. However, Wahid would change his mind and ask for his resignation. In April 2000, Wahid dismissed Minister of Industry and Trade Jusuf Kalla and Minister of State Owned Enterprises Laksamana Sukardi. The explanation that he gave was that the two were involved in corruption, although he never gave evidence to back it up.Barton (2002), page 302 This move soured Wahid's relations with Golkar and PDI-P. Aceh In March 2000, Wahid's Government began to open negotiations with the Free Aceh Movement (GAM). Two months later, in May, the Government signed a memorandum of understanding with GAM to last until the beginning of 2001, by which time both signatories would have breached the agreement. Other overtures toward reconciliation In March 2000, Wahid suggested that the 1966 Provisional People's Consultative Assembly (MPRS) resolution on the banning of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism be lifted. Wahid also moved to establish commercial relations with Israel, which aroused the ire of many Indonesian Muslim groups. This was one issue that arose in the briefing given to a Palestinian parliamentary delegation in 2000 by Riddhi Awad, their ambassador to Indonesia. Another issue was Wahid's membership in the Shimon Peres Foundation. Both Wahid and his foreign minister Alwi Shihab took offense at the inaccurate portrayals of the Indonesian president, and Alwi called for the replacement of Awad. However, Nurcholish Madjid pointed out that Wahid's personal neutrality toward the Israel-Palestine conflict should yield to the feelings of the \\"majority\\" of Indonesians, who support Palestine. Wahid visited Israel six times. In a 2004 interview, he said, \\"I think there is a wrong perception that Islam is in disagreement with Israel. This is caused by Arab propaganda. We have to distinguish between Arabs and Islam. Some people in Indonesia claimed that I was a stooge for the West, but the fact that I am gaining in popularity all the time dispels this idea, and shows that this is the view of only a small minority of the elite. I always say that China and the Soviet Union have or had atheism as part of their constitution, but we have long-term relationships with both these countries. So then Israel has a reputation as a nation with a high regard for God and religion ‚Äî there is then no reason we have to be against Israel.\\"A friend of Israel in the Islamic world, By Micha Odenheimer, Haaretz, 7 July 2004 Relationship with TNI When he ascended to the presidency, one of Wahid's goals was to reform the military and to take it out of its dominant socio-political role. In this venture, Wahid found an ally in Agus Wirahadikusumah who he made Commander of Kostrad in March. In July, Agus began uncovering a scandal involving Dharma Putra, a foundation with affiliations to Kostrad. Through Megawati, TNI members began pressuring Wahid to remove Agus. Wahid gave in to the pressure but then planned to have Agus appointed as the Army Chief of Staff to which TNI top brass responded by threatening to retire and Wahid once again bowed down to pressure. Wahid's relationship with the TNI deteriorated even further in July 2000 when it was revealed that Laskar Jihad had arrived in Maluku and was being armed by the TNI. Laskar Jihad, a radical Islamic militia had earlier in the year planned to go to Maluku and assist Muslims there in their communal conflict with the Christians. Wahid had ordered TNI to block Laskar Jihad from going to Maluku, but nevertheless they still made it to Maluku and they were then being armed with what turned out to be TNI weapons.Barton (2002), page 306 Buloggate and Bruneigate 2000 saw Wahid embroiled in two scandals which would damage his presidency. In May, the State Logistics Agency (BULOG) reported that US$4 million were missing from its cash reserve. The missing cash was then attributed to Wahid's own masseur, who had claimed that Wahid sent him to Bulog to collect the cash.Barton (2002), page 304 Although the money was returned, Wahid's opponents took the chance of accusing him of being involved in the scandal and of being aware of what his masseur was up to. At the same time, Wahid was also accused of keeping US$2 million for himself. The money was a donation by the Sultan of Brunei to provide assistance in Aceh. However, Wahid failed to account for the money. 2000 MPR Annual Session and Cabinet reshuffle As the 2000 MPR Annual Session approached, Wahid's popularity with the people was still at a high and politically, allies such as Megawati, Akbar, and Amien were still willing to support Wahid despite the sacking of the ministers and the scandals which he had been involved in. At the same time, however, they were asking questions of Wahid. At the 2000 MPR Annual Session, Wahid delivered a speech which was well received by a majority of the MPR members. During the speech, Wahid recognized his weakness as an administrator and said that he was going to delegate the day-to-day running of the government to a senior minister.Barton (2002), page 320 The MPR members agreed but proposed that Megawati should be the one to receive the task from the President. At first the MPR planned to have this proposal adopted as a resolution but a presidential decision was seen as enough. On 23 August, Wahid announced a new Cabinet despite Megawati's insistence that the announcement was delayed. Megawati showed her displeasure by not showing up for the Cabinet announcement. The new Cabinet was smaller and consisted of more non-partisans. There were no Golkar members in this Cabinet. Regional unrest In September, Wahid declared martial law in Maluku as the condition there continued to deteriorate. By now, it was evident that Laskar Jihad were being assisted by TNI members and it was also apparent that they were financed by Fuad Bawazier, the last Minister of Finance to have served under Suharto. During the same month, the West Papuans raised their Morning Star flag. Wahid's response was to allow the West Papuans to do this provided that the Morning Star flag was placed lower than the Indonesian flag.Barton (2002), page 340 For this, he was severely criticized by Megawati and Akbar. On 24 December 2000, there was Terrorist Attack directed against churches in Jakarta and in eight cities across Indonesia. Gathering political opposition By the end of 2000, there were many within the political elite who were disillusioned with Wahid. The most obvious person who showed this disillusion was Amien who showed regret at supporting Wahid to the presidency the previous year. Amien also attempted to rally opposition by encouraging Megawati and Akbar to flex their political muscles. Megawati surprisingly defended Wahid whilst Akbar preferred to wait for the 2004 Legislative Elections. At the end of November, 151 DPR members signed a petition calling for the impeachment of Wahid.Barton (2002), page 345 =2001 and removal from power= In January, Wahid made the announcement that Chinese New Year was to become an optional holiday. Wahid followed this up in February by lifting the ban on the display of Chinese characters and the imports of Chinese publications. In February, Wahid visited Northern Africa as well as Saudi Arabia to undertake the hajj pilgrimage.Barton (2002), page 352 Wahid made his last overseas visit in June 2001 when he visited Australia. At a meeting with university rectors on 27 January 2001, Wahid commented on the possibility of Indonesia descending into anarchy. Wahid then made the suggestion that he may be forced to dissolve the DPR if that happened.Barton (2002), page 348 Although the meeting was off-the- record, it caused quite a stir and added to the fuel of the movement against him. On 1 February, the DPR met to issue a memorandum against Wahid. Two memorandums constitute an MPR Special Session where the impeachment and removal of a president would be legal. The vote was overwhelmingly for the memorandum and PKB members could only walk out in protest. The memorandum caused widespread protests by NU members. In East Java, NU members went around to Golkar's regional offices and trashed it. In Jakarta, Wahid's opposition began accusing him of encouraging the protests. Wahid denied it and went to talk to the protesters at the town of Pasuruan; encouraging them to get off the streets.Barton (2002), pages 351‚Äì352 Nevertheless, NU protesters continued to show their support for Wahid and in April, made the announcement that they were ready to defend and die for the President. In March, Wahid tried to counter the opposition by moving against dissidents within his own Cabinet. Minister of Justice Yusril Ihza Mahendra was removed for making public his demands for the President's resignation while Minister of Forestry Nur Mahmudi Ismail was also removed under the suspicion of channeling his department's funds to Wahid's opposition. In response to this, Megawati began to distance herself and did not show up for the inauguration of the Ministers' replacement. On 30 April, the DPR issued a second memorandum and on the next day called for an MPR Special Session to be held on 1 August. By July, Wahid grew desperate and ordered Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the Coordinating Minister for Politics and Security to declare a State of Emergency. Yudhoyono refused and Wahid removed him from his position. Finally on 20 July, Amien declared that the MPR Special Session will be brought forward to 23 July. TNI, having had a bad relationship with Wahid through his tenure as president, stationed 40,000 troops in Jakarta and placed tanks with their turrets pointing at the Presidential Palace in a show of force.Barton (2002), page 363 To prevent the MPR Special Session from taking place, Wahid then enacted a Decree disbanding the MPR on 23 July despite had no power to do so. In defiance against Wahid's decree, the MPR continued the Special Session and unanimously voted to impeach Wahid. The same session also saw the MPR voted to affirm Megawati succession to the presidency, effectively replacing him. Wahid continued to insist that he was the president and stayed for some days in the Presidential Palace, but eventually left the residence on 25 July for a trip overseas to the United States for health treatments. Post-presidency activities =Schism within the PKB= After his impeachment, Wahid turned his eyes to Matori Abdul Djalil, who was the chairman of PKB. Before the MPR Special Session, it was agreed upon that no PKB members would attend as a sign of solidarity. However, Matori insisted on attending because he was a vice-chairman of the MPR and participated in the impeachment process. Using his position as chairman of the Advisory Council, Wahid sacked Matori as chairman of PKB on 15 August 2001 and suspended him from party activities before stripping Matori of Party membership in November.‚Äì Matori Dipecat dari PKB . Tempointeraktif.com (15 November 2001). On 14 January 2002, Matori held a Special National Congress attended by his supporters in PKB. The Special National Congress re-elected him to the position of PKB chairman. Wahid countered this by holding his own PKB National Congress on 17 January, a day after Matori's Congress endedUTAMA The National Congress re-elected Wahid to the position of chairman of the Advisory Council and elected Alwi Shihab as its chairman. Wahid's PKB would be known as PKB Kuningan whilst Matori's PKB would be known as PKB Batutulis. =2004 legislative and presidential elections= In April 2004, PKB received 10.6% of the vote in the National Legislative Elections and nominated Wahid as their presidential candidate, but due to a failed medical examination required by Indonesian law, Wahid's candidature was disqualified. Wahid then threw his support behind Wiranto of the Golkar party, as Wahid's brother, Salahuddin, was Wiranto's running mate.BBC ‚Äì Major party endorses Wiranto bid. BBC News (26 May 2004). Wiranto and Salahuddin came third. For the run-off elections, held on 20 September 2004 between candidates Yudhoyono and Megawati, Wahid declared no support for either candidate and abstained from voting. =Opposition to Yudhoyono Government= In August 2005, Wahid became one of the leaders of a political coalition called the United Awakened Archipelago (Koalisi Nusantara Bangkit Bersatu). Along with Try Sutrisno, Wiranto, Akbar Tanjung, and Megawati, this coalition criticized the policies of the Yudhoyono Government, specifically about the withdrawal of fuel subsidies which they argued would raise the price of fuel. In September 2006, Wahid said that he would run in the 2009 presidential election‚Äì Abdurrahman Wahid Siap Saingi Yudhoyono . Tempointeraktif.com (21 September 2006).

The Wahid Institute. Wahid served as patron, member of the board of directors and senior advisor to the LibForAll (\\"Liberty for All\\") Foundation, whose mission it is to reduce religious extremism and discredit terrorism worldwide. Wahid wrote an article published in the Wall Street Journal on 30 December 2005 entitled Right Islam vs. Wrong Islam‚Äì Abdurrahman Wahid Official Site . Gusdur.net. in which he called on \\"people of good will of every faith and nation\\" to unite against the religious hatred that underlies and animates terrorism. Wahid discussed his suspicions regarding the involvement of the Indonesian government and Indonesia's armed forces in the terrorist bombings on Bali, in an interview in the documentary Inside Indonesia's War on Terrorism, aired by SBS Dateline on 12 October 2005. =Religious views= Wahid said: In a 2009 dialogue with Buddhist leader Daisaku Ikeda, Wahid said: In a 2002 interview with Australian television program, \\"Foreign Correspondent\\", Wahid explained his respect for Israel and posed a challenging \\"correction\\" to be addressed by his fellow Muslims: Wahid was an advocate of interfaith dialogue and sat on the Board of World Religious Leaders for the Elijah Interfaith Institute.The Elijah Interfaith Institute ‚Äì Muslim Members of the Board of World Religious Leaders.

During the trip his health worsened and Wahid was admitted to hospital in Jombang on 24 December 2009. He was moved to Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Central Jakarta the following day to undergo dialysis. He also underwent dental surgery on 28 December after complaining of toothache. Wahid died on 30 December at approximately 6:45 pm local time (UTC+7) due to complications from kidney disorders, heart disease and diabetes. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono visited Wahid shortly before his death. A state funeral was held for Wahid on 31 December, and flags were flown at half-staff for seven days. He was buried next to his grandparents and parents at his birthplace, Jombang, East Java.

Early names include Patanjali, the author of the Mahabhashya commentary on PƒÅ·πáini's grammar, suggested by some to have been the same to write the Hindu treatise known as the Yogasutra, and Dridhbala, who revised the Charaka Samhita of Ayurveda. In medieval times, philosophers of Kashmir Shaivism include Vasugupta (c. 800), Utpala (c. 925), Abhinavagupta, and Kshemaraja as well as Anandavardhana.  Kashmiri language literature  The use of the Kashmiri language began with the work MahƒÅnaya- PrakƒÅsha by RƒÅjƒÅnaka Shiti Kantha (c.1250), and was followed by the poet Lalleshvari or Lal Ded (14th century), who wrote mystical verses in the vakh or four-line couplet style. Another mystic of her time equally revered in Kashmir and popularly known as Nund Reshi wrote powerful poetry. Later came Habba Khatun (16th century) with her own style. Other major names are Rupa Bhavani (1621‚Äì1721), Arnimal (d. 1800), Mahmud Gami (1765‚Äì1855), Rasul Mir (d. 1870), Paramananda (1791‚Äì1864), Maqbool Shah Kralawari (1820‚Äì1877). Also, the Sufi poets like Shamas Fakir, Wahab Khar, Soch Kral, Samad Mir, and Ahad Zargar. Among modern poets are Ghulam Ahmad Mahjur (1885‚Äì1952), Abdul Ahad Azad (1903‚Äì1948), and Zinda Kaul (1884‚Äì1965). During the 1950s, a number of well educated youth turned to Kashmiri writing, both poetry and prose, and enriched modern Kashmiri writing by leaps and bounds. Among these writers are Dinanath Nadim (1916‚Äì1988), Rahman Rahi, Ghulam Nabi Firaq Amin Kamil (1923-2014), Ali Mohd Lone, Autar Krishen Rahbar (born 1933), Akhtar Mohiuddin, Sajood Sailani (brn 1933), Som Nath Zutshi, Muzaffar Aazim, and Sarwanand Kaol Premi. Some later day writers are Hari Krishan Kaul, Majrooh Rashid, Rattanlal Shant, Hirdhey Kaul Bharti, Omkar N Koul, Roop Krishen Bhat, Rafiq Raaz, Tariq Shehraz, Shafi Shauq, Showkat Shehri, M H Zaffar, G M Azad' Anis Hamdani' Barkat Nida' Majrooh Rashid' Shafi Sumbli'Bashar Bashir'Shenaz Rashid, Shabir Ahmad Shabir, Shabir Magami,Tariq Ahmad Tariq, and Moti Lal Kemmu.

She was the creator of the style of mystic poetry called vatsun or Vakhs, literally \\"speech\\" (from Sanskrit vaak). Known as Lal Vakhs, her verses are the earliest compositions in the Kashmiri language and are an important part in the history of modern Kashmiri literature.Lal Vakh online Lal Ded's Vakhs Sufis missionaries utilized her hindu philosophy. Lal Ded (\\"Mother Lal\\" or \\"Mother Lalla\\") is also known by various other names, including Lal Dyad (Dyad means \\"Grandmother\\"), Lalla Aarifa, Lal Diddi, Lalleshwari, Lalla Yogishwari/Yogeshwari and Lalishri.Lal Ded www.poetry-chaikhana.com.Lal Ded www.radiokashmir.org.  Life  A great deal of the records of Lal Ded's life are contained in oral tradition, and consequently there is considerable variance on the details of her life and beliefs. Numerous contemporary Kashmiri histories, such as those prepared by Jonaraja, Srivara, Prajyabhatta, and Haidar Malik Chadura, do not mention Lal Ded. The first written record of Lal Ded's life is contained in the Tadhkirat-ul-Arifin (1587), a collection of biographies of saints and religious figures written by Mulla Ali Raina, and followed by an account of her life in Baba Daud Mishkati's Asrar ul-Akbar (1654). In these texts, Lal Ded is described as a mystic saint, appearing in the forest to travellers. In 1736, Khwaja Azam Diddamari's Tarikh-i-Azami contained a more detailed account of Lal Ded's life. She is also noted in a Persian chronicle, the Waqiati-e-Kashmir (1746) in which she is described as being famous in the reign of Sultan Alau-ud-din (1343-54) and died in the reign of Sultan Shihab-ud-din (1354-73). Lal Ded is also believed to be a contemporary of Mir Sayyid Ali-Hamdani, an Iranian Sufi scholar and poet, who recorded stories of her in his own verse during his travels to Kashmir. Most modern scholars place Lal Ded's birth between 1301 and 1320 C.E., near Sempore or Pandrenthan. She estimated to have died in 1373, and a grave near Bijbehara is commonly attributed to her, although there is no confirmation. Lal Ded is believed to have been born to a Brahmin family, and was married at the age of twelve in accordance with the local customs. Following her marriage, she was renamed, as is custom, to Padmavati, but continued to be known as Lalla or Lal Ded. Some reports suggest her marriage was unhappy, and that she left home, between the ages of twenty-four and twenty-six, to become a disciple of a spiritual leader, Siddha Srikanth or Sed Boyu, who was a Shaivite. As part of her religious education, she travelled alone on foot, surviving on alms, before becoming a teacher and spiritual leader herself.  Literary works  Lal Ded's poems represent some of the earliest known works of Kashmiri literature, and were written as Kashmiri began to emerge as a distinct language from Apabhramsa-prakrit, which was spoken in North India. A total of 285 poems, known as vakhs, are attributed to Lal Ded. = Themes = Lal Ded's vakhs drawn from influences and languages that made contact with the Indian sub-continent in her life, drawing from Sanskritic, Islamic, Sufi, and Sikh cultures. She continued the mystic tradition of Shaivism in Kashmir, which was known as Trika before 1900. = Translations = Lal Ded's works were first recorded in writing in the twentieth century, and have been frequently republished since, in Kashmiri as well as in translation. In 1914, Sir George Grierson, a civil servant and the Superintendent of the Linguistic Survey of India, commissioned a copy of Lal Ded's vakhs. A written record of the vakhs was unavailable at the time, and one was prepared by transcribing an oral narration of the vakhs performed by Dharma-dasa Darwesh, a story-teller residing in Gush, Kashmir. This manuscript was translated in English by Grierson and published as Lalla-Vakyani, or The Wise Sayings of Lal Ded. Grierson consolidated and expanded on the partial translation prepared by the Hungarian-British archaelogist and scholar Sir Marc Aurel Stein, and incorporated some archived poems that were contained in the Dictionary of Kashmiri Proverbs and Sayings (1888). Grierson's translation was the first printed and published volume of Lal Ded's works. Following his translation, a number of English translations have been produced, notably those by Pandit Ananda Koul (1921), Sir Richard Carnac Temple (1924) and Jaylal Kaul (1973). More recent translations include those by Coleman Barks, Jaishree Odin Kak, and Ranjit Hoskote. Her poems, (vakhs) have been translated into English by Richard Temple, Jaylal Kaul, Coleman Barks, Jaishree Odin, and Ranjit Hoskote.Kashmir's wise old Grandmother Lal Aditi De's review of I, Lalla by Ranjit Hoskote in The Hindu/ Business LineMystic insights Abdullah Khan's review of I, Lalla by Ranjit Hoskote in The HinduWords are floating Jerry Pinto's review of I, Lalla by Ranjit Hoskote in Hindustan TimesLalla and Kabir, resurrected Nilanjana S. Roy's article on Ranjit Hoskote's I, Lalla and Arvind Krishna Mehrotra's Songs of Kabir  Legacy  The leading Kashmiri Sufi figure Sheikh Noor-ud-din Wali (also known as Nooruddin Rishi or Nunda Rishi) was highly influenced by Lal Ded. He ultimately led to the formation of the Rishi order of saints and later gave rise to many Rishi saints like Resh Mir S√†eb. One Kashmiri folk story recounts that, as a baby, Nunda Rishi refused to be breast-fed by his mother. It was Lal Ded who breast-fed him. Lal Ded and her mystic musings continue to have a deep impact on the psyche of Kashmiris, and the 2000 National Seminar on her held at New Delhi led to the release of the book Remembering Lal Ded in Modern Times.Remembering Lal Ded in Modern Times National Seminar by Kashmir Education, Culture and Science Society, 2000. In his book \\"Triadic Mysticism\\", Paul E. Murphy calls her the \\"chief exponent of devotional or emotion-oriented Triadism\\". According to him, three significant representatives of devotionalism emerged in Kashmir in the five hundred years between the last half of the ninth and the end of the fourteenth centuries. What this points to is the non-sectarian nature of Lal Ded's spiritual life and her song-poems. Yet, her life and work have been used for various religious and political agendas over time. As author and poet Ranjit Hoskote writes: \\"To the outer world, Lal Ded is arguably Kashmir's best known spiritual and literary figure; within Kashmir, she has been venerated both by Hindus and Muslims for nearly seven centuries. For most of that period, she has successfully eluded the proprietorial claims of religious monopolists. Since the 1980s, however, Kashmir's confluential culture has frayed thin under the pressure of a prolonged conflict to which transnational terrorism, State repression and local militancy have all contributed. Religious identities in the region have become harder and more sharp-edged, following a substantial exodus of the Hindu minority during the early 1990s, and a gradual effort to replace Kashmir's unique and syncretically nuanced tradition of Islam with a more Arabocentric global template. It is true that Lal Ded was constructed differently by each community, but she was simultaneouslyLallesvari or Lalla Yogini to the Hindus and Lal'arifa to the Muslims; today unfortunately, these descriptions are increasingly being promoted at the expense of one another.\\" I, Lalla: The Poems of Lal Ded, translated by Ranjit Hoskote with an Introduction and Notes, Penguin Classics, 2011, p. xiv . Beyond several new translations of Lal Ded's vakh, there are other contemporary performative arts that are based on Lal Ded's life and poetry. For example, there are contemporary renderings of Lal Ded's poetry in song. In addition, a solo play in English, Hindi, and Kashmiri titled Lal Ded (based on her life) has been performed by actress Mita Vashisht across India since 2004.Songs of a mystic, The Hindu, 1 May 2005.Bhumika K.

Retrieved 18 March 2020 22 May 1943 - 17 March 2020) was a peace activist from Northern Ireland. She was a co-recipient with Mairead Corrigan of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1976 for her work as a cofounder of Community of Peace People, an organisation dedicated to promoting a peaceful resolution to the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Williams headed the Global Children's Foundation and was the President of the World Centre of Compassion for Children International. She was also the Chair of Institute for Asian Democracy in Washington D.C. She lectured widely on topics of peace, education, inter-cultural and inter-faith understanding, anti-extremism, and children's rights. Williams was a founding member of the Nobel Laureate Summit, which has taken place annually since 2000. In 2006, Williams became a founder of the Nobel Women's Initiative along with Nobel Peace Laureates Mairead Corrigan Maguire, Shirin Ebadi, Wangari Maathai, Jody Williams and Rigoberta Mench√∫ Tum. These six women, representing North and South America, the Middle East, Europe and Africa, brought together their experiences in a united effort for peace with justice and equality. It is the goal of the Nobel Women's Initiative to help strengthen work being done in support of women's rights around the world. Williams was also a member of PeaceJam. Early life Williams was born on 22 May 1943 in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Her father worked as a butcher and her mother was a housewife. Betty received her primary education from St. Teresa Primary School in Belfast and attended St Dominic's Grammar School for Girls for her secondary school studies. Upon completing her formal education, she took up a job of office receptionist. Rare for the time in Northern Ireland, her father was Protestant and her mother was Catholic; a family background from which Williams later said she derived religious tolerance and a breadth of vision that motivated her to work for peace. Early in the 1970s she joined an anti-violence campaign headed by a Protestant priest. Williams credits this experience for preparing her to eventually found her own peace movement, which focused on creating peace groups composed of former opponents, practicing confidence-building measures, and the development of a grassroots peace process. Peace petition Williams in 1978 Williams was drawn into the public arena after witnessing the death of three children on 10 August 1976, when they were hit by a car whose driver, an Irish Republican Army (IRA) paramilitary named Danny Lennon, had been fatally shot in return fire by a soldier of the Kings Own Royal Border regiment. As she turned the corner to her home, she saw the three Maguire children crushed by the swerving car and rushed to help. Their mother, Anne Maguire, who was with the children, eventually took her own life in January 1980. Williams was so moved by the incident that within two days of the tragic event, she had obtained 6,000 signatures on a petition for peace and gained wide media attention. With Corrigan, she co-founded the Women for Peace; which, with Ciaran McKeown, later became the Community of Peace People. Williams soon organised a peace march to the graves of the slain children, which was attended by 10,000 Protestant and Catholic women. However, the peaceful march was violently disrupted by members of the IRA, who accused them of being \\"dupes of the British\\".Nobel Peace Laureates Conference The following week, Williams led another march in Ormeau Park that concluded successfully without incident ‚Äì this time with 20,000 participants. At that time, Williams declared the following: =Declaration of the Peace People= First Declaration of the Peace People *We have a simple message to the world from this movement for Peace. *We want to live and love and build a just and peaceful society. *We want for our children, as we want for ourselves, our lives at home, at work, and at play to be lives of joy and Peace. *We recognise that to build such a society demands dedication, hard work, and courage. *We recognise that there are many problems in our society which are a source of conflict and violence. *We recognise that every bullet fired and every exploding bomb make that work more difficult. *We reject the use of the bomb and the bullet and all the techniques of violence. *We dedicate ourselves to working with our neighbours, near and far, day in and day out, to build that peaceful society in which the tragedies we have known are a bad memory and a continuing warning. Nobel Peace Prize Williams around the time she received the Nobel Peace Prize In recognition of her efforts for peace, Williams, together with her friend Mairead Corrigan, became joint recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977 (the prize for 1976). In her acceptance speech, Williams said, > That first week will always be remembered of course for something else > besides the birth of the Peace People. For those most closely involved, the > most powerful memory of that week was the death of a young republican and > the deaths of three children struck by the dead man's car. A deep sense of > frustration at the mindless stupidity of the continuing violence was already > evident before the tragic events of that sunny afternoon of 10 August 1976. > But the deaths of those four young people in one terrible moment of violence > caused that frustration to explode, and create the possibility of a real > peace movement...As far as we are concerned, every single death in the last > eight years, and every death in every war that was ever fought represents > life needlessly wasted, a mother's labour spurned. The Peace Prize money was divided equally between Williams and Corrigan. Williams kept her share of the money, stating that her intention was to use it to promote peace beyond Ireland, but faced criticism for her decision. She and Corrigan had no contact after 1976. In 1978 Williams broke off links with the Peace People movement, and became instead an activist for peace in other areas around the world. Betty Williams obituary, The Guardian, 20 March 2020. Retrieved 23 March 2020 Other awards Williams received the People's Peace Prize of Norway in 1976, the Schweitzer Medallion for Courage, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Award, the Eleanor Roosevelt Award in 1984, and the Frank Foundation Child Care International Oliver Award. In 1995, she was awarded the Rotary Club International \\"Paul Harris Fellowship\\" and the Together for Peace Building Award. Talks and guest lectures Williams in March 2009 At the 2006 Earth Dialogues forum in Brisbane, Williams told an audience of schoolchildren during a speech on Iraq War casualties that \\"Right now, I would like to kill George W. Bush.\\" From 17 to 20 September 2007, Williams gave a series of lectures in Southern California: on 18 September, she presented a lecture to the academic community of Orange County entitled \\"Peace in the World Is Everybody's Business\\"; and on 20 September she gave a lecture to 2,232 members of the general public, including 1,100 high school sophomores, at Soka University of America. In 2010, she gave a lecture at WE Day Toronto, a WE Charity event that empowers students to be active within their communities, and worldwide. Speaking at the University of Bradford before an audience of 200 in March 2011, Williams warned that young Muslim women on campus were vulnerable to attacks from angry family members, while the university does little to help protect them. \\"If you had someone on this campus these young women could go to say, 'I am frightened' ‚Äì if you are not doing that here, you are dehumanising them by not helping these young women, don't you think?\\" Personal life At the time she received the Nobel Prize, Williams worked as a receptionist and was raising her two children with her first husband Ralph Williams. After they divorced, she married James Perkins in December 1982 after meeting him in Disney World on vacation with one of her daughters, and resided in Florida in the United States. In 2004, she returned to live in Northern Ireland.

His teachings about the nature of the Godhead in Christianity, which emphasized God the Father's uniqueness and Christ's subordination under the Father, and his opposition to what would become the dominant Christology, Homoousian Christology, made him a primary topic of the First Council of Nicaea, which was convened by Emperor Constantine the Great in 325. After Emperors Licinius and Constantine legalized and formalized the Christianity of the time in the Roman Empire, Constantine sought to unify the newly recognized Church and remove theological divisions.Constantine the Great Rules - National Geographic - Retrieved 23 September 2014. The Christian Church was divided over disagreements on Christology, or, the nature of the relationship between Jesus and God. Homoousian Christians, including Athanasius of Alexandria, used Arius and Arianism as epithets to describe those who disagreed with their doctrine of coequal Trinitarianism, a Homoousian Christology representing God the Father and Jesus Christ the Son as \\"of one essence\\" (\\"consubstantial\\") and coeternal. Negative writings describe Arius's theology as one in which there was a time before the Son of God, when only God the Father existed. Despite concerted opposition, Arian Christian churches persisted throughout Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa, especially in various Germanic kingdoms, until suppressed by military conquest or voluntary royal conversion between the fifth and seventh centuries. The Son's precise relationship with the Father had been discussed for decades before Arius's advent; Arius intensified the controversy and carried it to a Church-wide audience, where others like Eusebius of Nicomedia proved much more influential in the long run. In fact, some later Arians disavowed the name, claiming not to have been familiar with the man or his specific teachings. However, because the conflict between Arius and his foes brought the issue to the theological forefront, the doctrine he proclaimed‚Äîthough not originated‚Äîis generally labeled as \\"his\\".  Early life and personality  Reconstructing the life and doctrine of Arius has proven to be a difficult task, as none of his original writings survive. Emperor Constantine ordered their burning while Arius was still living, and any that survived this purge were later destroyed by his orthodox opponents. Those works which have survived are quoted in the works of churchmen who denounced him as a heretic. This leads some ‚Äî but not all ‚Äî scholars to question their reliability. Arius was of Berber descent. His father's name is given as Ammonius. Arius is believed to have been a student at the exegetical school in Antioch, where he studied under Saint Lucian. Having returned to Alexandria, Arius, according to a single source, sided with Meletius of Lycopolis in his dispute over the re-admission of those who had denied Christianity under fear of Roman torture, and was ordained a deacon under the latter's auspices. He was excommunicated by Bishop Peter of Alexandria in 311 for supporting Meletius, but under Peter's successor Achillas, Arius was re-admitted to Christian communion and in 313 made presbyter of the Baucalis district in Alexandria. Although his character has been severely assailed by his opponents, Arius appears to have been a man of personal ascetic achievement, pure morals, and decided convictions. Paraphrasing Epiphanius of Salamis, an opponent of Arius, Catholic historian Warren H. Carroll describes him as \\"tall and lean, of distinguished appearance and polished address. Women doted on him, charmed by his beautiful manners, touched by his appearance of asceticism. Men were impressed by his aura of intellectual superiority.\\" Though Arius was also accused by his opponents of being too liberal, and too loose in his theology, engaging in heresy (as defined by his opponents), some historians argue that Arius was actually quite conservative, and that he deplored how, in his view, Christian theology was being too freely mixed with Greek paganism.  The Arian controversy  Arius is notable primarily because of his role in the Arian controversy, a great fourth-century theological conflict that led to the calling of the first ecumenical council of the Church. This controversy centered upon the nature of the Son of God, and his precise relationship to God the Father. Before the council of Nicaea, the Christian world knew several competing Christological ideas. Church authorities condemned some of these ideas but did not put forth a uniform formula. The Nicaean formula was a rapidly concluded solution to the general Christological debate. = Beginnings = The Trinitarian historian Socrates of Constantinople reports that Arius sparked the controversy that bears his name when Alexander of Alexandria, who had succeeded Achillas as the Bishop of Alexandria, gave a sermon stating the similarity of the Son to the Father. Arius interpreted Alexander's speech as being a revival of Sabellianism, condemned it, and then argued that \\"if the Father begat the Son, he that was begotten had a beginning of existence: and from this it is evident, that there was a time when the Son was not. It therefore necessarily follows, that he [the Son] had his substance from nothing.\\" This quote describes the essence of Arius's doctrine. Socrates of Constantinople believed that Arius was influenced in his thinking by the teachings of Lucian of Antioch, a celebrated Christian teacher and martyr. In a letter to Patriarch Alexander of Constantinople Arius' bishop, Alexander of Alexandria, wrote that Arius derived his theology from Lucian. The express purpose of Alexander's letter was to complain of the doctrines that Arius was spreading, but his charge of heresy against Arius is vague and unsupported by other authorities. Furthermore, Alexander's language, like that of most controversialists in those days, is quite bitter and abusive. Moreover, even Alexander never accused Lucian of having taught Arianism; rather, he accused Lucian ad invidiam of heretical tendencies‚Äîwhich apparently, according to him, were transferred to his pupil, Arius. The noted Russian historian Alexander Vasiliev refers to Lucian as \\"the Arius before Arius\\". = Origen and Arius = Like many third-century Christian scholars, Arius was influenced by the writings of Origen, widely regarded as the first great theologian of Christianity. However, while both agreed on the subordination of the Son to the Father, and Arius drew support from Origen's theories on the Logos, the two did not agree on everything. Arius clearly argued that the Logos had a beginning and that the Son, therefore, was not eternal, the Logos being the highest of the Created Order. This idea is summarized in the statement \\"there was a time when the Son was not.\\" By way of contrast, Origen believed the relation of the Son to the Father had no beginning, and that the Son was \\"eternally generated\\". Arius objected to Origen's doctrine, complaining about it in his letter to the Nicomedian Eusebius, who had also studied under Lucian. Nevertheless, despite disagreeing with Origen on this point, Arius found solace in his writings, which used expressions that favored Arius's contention that the Logos was of a different substance than the Father, and owed his existence to his Father's will. However, because Origen's theological speculations were often proffered to stimulate further inquiry rather than to put an end to any given dispute, both Arius and his opponents were able to invoke the authority of this revered (at the time) theologian during their debate. Arius emphasized the supremacy and uniqueness of God the Father, meaning that the Father alone is infinite and eternal and almighty, and that therefore the Father's divinity must be greater than the Son's. Arius taught that the Son had a beginning, contrary to Origen, who taught that the Son was less than the Father only in power, but not in time. Arius maintained that the Son possessed neither the eternity nor the true divinity of the Father, but was rather made \\"God\\" only by the Father's permission and power, and that the Logos was rather the very first and the most perfect of God's productions, before ages. = Initial responses = The Bishop of Alexandria exiled the presbyter following a council of local priests. Arius's supporters vehemently protested. Numerous bishops and Christian leaders of the era supported his cause, among them Eusebius of Nicomedia. = First Council of Nicaea = Council of Nicaea, with Arius depicted beneath the feet of the Emperor Constantine and the bishops The Christological debate could no longer be contained within the Alexandrian diocese. By the time Bishop Alexander finally acted against Arius, Arius's doctrine had spread far beyond his own see; it had become a topic of discussion‚Äîand disturbance‚Äîfor the entire Church. The Church was now a powerful force in the Roman world, with Emperors Licinius and Constantine I having legalized it in 313 through the Edict of Milan. Emperor Constantine had taken a personal interest in several ecumenical issues, including the Donatist controversy in 316, and he wanted to bring an end to the Christological dispute. To this end, the emperor sent Hosius, bishop of C√≥rdoba to investigate and, if possible, resolve the controversy. Hosius was armed with an open letter from the Emperor: \\"Wherefore let each one of you, showing consideration for the other, listen to the impartial exhortation of your fellow-servant.\\" But as the debate continued to rage despite Hosius' efforts, Constantine in AD 325 took an unprecedented step: he called a council to be composed of church prelates from all parts of the empire to resolve this issue, possibly at Hosius' recommendation. All secular dioceses of the empire sent one or more representatives to the council, save for Roman Britain; the majority of the bishops came from the East. Pope Sylvester I, himself too aged to attend, sent two priests as his delegates. Arius himself attended the council, as did his bishop, Alexander. Also there were Eusebius of Caesarea, Eusebius of Nicomedia and the young deacon Athanasius, who would become the champion of the Trinitarian view ultimately adopted by the council and spend most of his life battling Arianism. Before the main conclave convened, Hosius initially met with Alexander and his supporters at Nicomedia. The council would be presided over by the emperor himself, who participated in and even led some of its discussions. At this First Council of Nicaea twenty-two bishops, led by Eusebius of Nicomedia, came as supporters of Arius. But when some of Arius's writings were read aloud, they are reported to have been denounced as blasphemous by most participants. Those who upheld the notion that Christ was co-eternal and con-substantial with the Father were led by the bishop Alexander. Athanasius was not allowed to sit in on the Council since he was only an arch-deacon. But Athanasius is seen as doing the legwork and concluded (as Bishop Alexander conveyed in the Athanasian Trinitarian defense and also according to the Nicene Creed adopted at this Council and,Athanasius, Discourse 1 Against the Arians, part 9, http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/28161.htmAthanasius, De Decretis, parts 20 and 30, http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2809.htm) that the Son was of the same essence (homoousios) with the Father (or one in essence with the Father), and was eternally generated from that essence of the Father.Matt Perry - Athanasius and his Influence at the Council of Nicaea - QUODLIBET JOURNAL - Retrieved 29 May 2014. Those who instead insisted that the Son of God came after God the Father in time and substance, were led by Arius the presbyter. For about two months, the two sides argued and debated,\\"Babylon The Great Has Fallen!\\" - God's Kingdom Rules! Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc. - page 477. with each appealing to Scripture to justify their respective positions. Arius argued for the supremacy of God the Father, and maintained that the Son of God was simply the oldest and most beloved Creature of God, made from nothing, because of being the direct offspring. Arius taught that the pre-existent Son was God's First Production (the very first thing that God actually ever did in His entire eternal existence up to that point), before all ages. Thus he insisted that only God the Father had no beginning, and that the Father alone was infinite and eternal. Arius maintained that the Son had a beginning. Thus, said Arius, only the Son was directly created and begotten of God; furthermore, there was a time that He had no existence. He was capable of His own free will, said Arius, and thus \\"were He in the truest sense a son, He must have come after the Father, therefore the time obviously was when He was not, and hence He was a finite being.\\" Arius appealed to Scripture, quoting verses such as : \\"the Father is greater than I\\". And also : \\"the firstborn of all creation.\\" Thus, Arius insisted that the Father's Divinity was greater than the Son's, and that the Son was under God the Father, and not co-equal or co-eternal with Him. According to some accounts in the hagiography of Nicholas of Myra, debate at the council became so heated that at one point, Nicholas struck Arius across the face.Bishop Nicholas Loses His Cool at the Council of Nicaea . From the St. Nicholas center. See also St. Nicholas the Wonderworker , from the website of the Orthodox Church in America. Retrieved on 2010-02-02.In this corner, St. Nicholas!. Catholic Exchange. Published: 5 December 2012. The majority of the bishops ultimately agreed upon a creed, known thereafter as the Nicene creed. It included the word homoousios, meaning \\"consubstantial\\", or \\"one in essence\\", which was incompatible with Arius' beliefs. On June 19, 325, council and emperor issued a circular to the churches in and around Alexandria: Arius and two of his unyielding partisans (Theonas and Secundus) were deposed and exiled to Illyricum, while three other supporters‚ÄîTheognis of Nicaea, Eusebius of Nicomedia and Maris of Chalcedon‚Äîaffixed their signatures solely out of deference to the emperor. The following is part of the ruling made by the emperor denouncing Arius's teachings with fervor.  Exile, return, and death  The Homoousian party's victory at Nicaea was short-lived, however. Despite Arius's exile and the alleged finality of the Council's decrees, the Arian controversy recommenced at once. When Bishop Alexander died in 327, Athanasius succeeded him, despite not meeting the age requirements for a hierarch. Still committed to pacifying the conflict between Arians and Trinitarians, Constantine gradually became more lenient toward those whom the Council of Nicaea had exiled. Though he never repudiated the council or its decrees, the emperor ultimately permitted Arius (who had taken refuge in Palestine) and many of his adherents to return to their homes, once Arius had reformulated his Christology to mute the ideas found most objectionable by his critics. Athanasius was exiled following his condemnation by the First Synod of Tyre in 335 (though he was later recalled), and the Synod of Jerusalem the following year restored Arius to communion. The emperor directed Alexander of Constantinople to receive Arius, despite the bishop's objections; Bishop Alexander responded by earnestly praying that Arius might perish before this could happen., quoted in Modern scholars consider that the subsequent death of Arius may have been the result of poisoning by his opponents. In contrast, some contemporaries of Arius asserted that the circumstances of his death were miraculous ‚Äì consequence of Arius's heretical views. The latter view was evident in the account of Arius's death by a bitter enemy, Socrates Scholasticus. The death of Arius did not end the Arian controversy, and would not be settled for centuries, in some parts of the Christian world. Constantine I burning Arian books, illustration from a book of canon law, ca. 825  Arianism after Arius  = Immediate aftermath = Historians report that Constantine, who had not been baptized for most of his lifetime, was baptized on his deathbed by the Arian bishop, Eusebius of Nicomedia. Constantius II, who succeeded Constantine, was an Arian sympathizer. Under him, Arianism reached its high point at The Third Council of Sirmium in 357. The Seventh Arian Confession (Second Sirmium Confession) held that both homoousios (of one substance) and homoiousios (of similar substance) were unbiblical and that the Father is greater than the Son. (This confession was later dubbed the Blasphemy of Sirmium.) > But since many persons are disturbed by questions concerning what is called > in Latin substantia, but in Greek ousia, that is, to make it understood more > exactly, as to 'coessential', or what is called, 'like-in-essence', there > ought to be no mention of any of these at all, nor exposition of them in the > Church, for this reason and for this consideration, that in divine Scripture > nothing is written about them, and that they are above men's knowledge and > above men's understanding. Following the abortive effort by Julian the Apostate to restore paganism in the empire, the emperor Valens ‚Äî himself an Arian ‚Äî renewed the persecution of Nicene bishops. However, Valens's successor Theodosius I ended Arianism once and for all among the elites of the Eastern Empire through a combination of imperial decree, persecution, and the calling of the Second Ecumenical Council in 381, which condemned Arius anew while reaffirming and expanding the Nicene Creed. This generally ended the influence of Arianism among the non-Germanic peoples of the Roman Empire. = Arianism in the West = The Arian Baptistery erected by Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great in Ravenna, Italy, around 500 Things went differently in the Western Empire. During the reign of Constantius II, the Arian Gothic convert Ulfilas was consecrated a bishop by Eusebius of Nicomedia and sent to missionize his people. His success ensured the survival of Arianism among the Goths and Vandals until the beginning of the eighth century, when these kingdoms succumbed to their Nicean neighbors or accepted Nicean Christianity. Arians also continued to exist in North Africa, Spain and portions of Italy, until finally suppressed during the sixth and seventh centuries. In the 12th century, the Benedictine abbot Peter the Venerable described the Islamic prophet Muhammad as \\"the successor of Arius and the precursor to the Antichrist\\". During the Protestant Reformation, a Polish sect known as the Polish Brethren were often referred to as Arians, due to their antitrinitarian doctrine. = Arianism today = There are several contemporary Christian and Post-Christian denominations today that echo Arian thinking. Jehovah's Witnesses are often referred to as \\"modern-day Arians\\" or sometimes \\"Semi-Arians\\",Institute for Metaphysical Studies--The Arian Christian Bible - Metaphysical Institute, 2010.

While there are some significant similarities in theology and doctrine, the Witnesses differ from Arians by saying that the Son can fully know the Father (something Arius himself denied), and by their denial of literal personality to the Holy Spirit. Arius considered the Holy Spirit to be a person or a high-ranking angel, which had a beginning as a creature, whereas the Witnesses consider the Holy Spirit to be God's \\"active force\\" or divine \\"energy\\", which had no beginning, and is not an actual person. The original Arians also generally prayed directly to Jesus, whereas the Witnesses pray to God, through Jesus as a mediator. Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) are sometimes accused of being Arians by their detractors. However, the Christology of the Latter-day Saints differs in several significant aspects from Arian theology. Some Christians in the Unitarian Universalist movement are influenced by Arian ideas. Contemporary Unitarian Universalist Christians often are either Arian or Socian in their Christology, seeing Jesus as a distinctive moral figure, but not God the Father, or follow Origen's logic of Universal Salvation, and thus potentially affirm the Trinity, but assert that all are already saved.  Arius's doctrine  = Introduction = In explaining his actions against Arius, Alexander of Alexandria wrote a letter to Alexander of Constantinople and Eusebius of Nicomedia (where the emperor was then residing), detailing the errors into which he believed Arius had fallen. According to Alexander, Arius taught: Alexander also refers to Arius's poetical Thalia: = The Logos = This question of the exact relationship between the Father and the Son (a part of the theological science of Christology) had been raised some fifty years before Arius, when Paul of Samosata was deposed in 269 for agreeing with those who used the word homoousios (Greek for same substance) to express the relation between the Father and the Son. This term was thought at that time to have a Sabellian tendency,Select Treatises of St. Athanasius - In Controversy With the Arians - Freely Translated by John Henry Cardinal Newmann - Longmans, Green, and Co., 1911, footnote, page 124 though‚Äîas events showed‚Äîthis was on account of its scope not having been satisfactorily defined. In the discussion which followed Paul's deposition, Dionysius, the Bishop of Alexandria, used much the same language as Arius did later, and correspondence survives in which Pope Dionysius blames him for using such terminology. Dionysius responded with an explanation widely interpreted as vacillating. The Synod of Antioch, which condemned Paul of Samosata, had expressed its disapproval of the word homoousios in one sense, while Bishop Alexander undertook its defense in another. Although the controversy seemed to be leaning toward the opinions later championed by Arius, no firm decision had been made on the subject; in an atmosphere so intellectual as that of Alexandria, the debate seemed bound to resurface‚Äîand even intensify‚Äîat some point in the future. Arius endorsed the following doctrines about The Son or The Word (Logos, referring to Jesus; see the ): # that the Word (Logos) and the Father were not of the same essence (ousia); # that the Son was a created being (ktisma or poiema); and # that the worlds were created through him, so he must have existed before them and before all time. # However, there was a \\"once\\" [Arius did not use words meaning \\"time\\", such as chronos or aion] when He did not exist, before he was begotten of the Father.  Extant writings  Three surviving letters attributed to Arius are his letter to Alexander of Alexandria,Preserved by Athanasius, On the Councils of Arminum and Seleucia, 16; Epiphanius, Refutation of All Heresies, 69.7; and Hilary, On the Trinity, 4.12) his letter to Eusebius of Nicomedia,Recorded by Epiphanius, Refutation of All Heresies, 69.6 and Theodoret, Church History, 1.5 and his confession to Constantine.Recorded in Socrates Scholasticus, Church History 1.26.2 and Sozomen, Church History 2.27.6-10 In addition, several letters addressed by others to Arius survive, together with brief quotations contained within the polemical works of his opponents. These quotations are often short and taken out of context, and it is difficult to tell how accurately they quote him or represent his true thinking. = The Thalia = Arius' Thalia (literally, \\"Festivity\\", \\"banquet\\"), a popularized work combining prose and verse and summarizing his views on the Logos, survives in quoted fragmentary form. In the Thalia, Arius says that God's first thought was the creation of the Son, before all ages, therefore time started with the creation of the Logos or Word in Heaven (lines 1-9, 30-32); explains how the Son could still be God, even if he did not exist eternally (lines 20-23); and endeavors to explain the ultimate incomprehensibility of the Father to the Son (lines 33-39). The two available references from this work are recorded by his opponent Athanasius: the first is a report of Arius's teaching in Orations Against the Arians, 1:5-6. This paraphrase has negative comments interspersed throughout, so it is difficult to consider it as being completely reliable. The second quotation is found in the document On the Councils of Arminum and Seleucia, also known as De Synodis, pg. 15. This second passage is entirely in irregular verse, and seems to be a direct quotation or a compilation of quotations; it may have been written by someone other than Athanasius, perhaps even a person sympathetic to Arius. This second quotation does not contain several statements usually attributed to Arius by his opponents, is in metrical form, and resembles other passages that have been attributed to Arius. It also contains some positive statements about the Son. But although these quotations seem reasonably accurate, their proper context is lost, thus their place in Arius' larger system of thought is impossible to reconstruct. Ceiling Mosaic of the Arian Baptistry, in Ravenna, Italy, depicting the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost present, with John the Baptist The part of Arius' Thalia quoted in Athanasius' De Synodis is the longest extant fragment. The most commonly cited edition of De Synodis is by Hans-Georg Opitz. A translation of this fragment has been made by Aaron J. West, but based not on Opitz' text but on a previous edition: \\"When compared to Opitz' more recent edition of the text, we found that our text varies only in punctuation, capitalization, and one variant reading (œáœÅœåŒΩ·ø≥ for œáœÅœåŒΩŒøŒπœÇ, line 5).\\" Here is the Opitz edition with the West translation: A slightly different edition of the fragment of the Thalia from De Synodis is given by G.C. Stead, and served as the basis for a translation by R.P.C. Hanson. Stead argued that the Thalia was written in anapestic meter, and edited the fragment to show what it would look like in anapests with different line breaks. Hanson based his translation of this fragment directly on Stead's text. Here is Stead's edition with Hanson's translation.

They have alternately arranged leaves divided into leaflets with toothed or occasionally smooth edges. The compound inflorescence is an array of several flower heads, or sometimes a solitary head. The head has a base covered in layers of phyllaries. The simple row of ray florets is white, yellow, or red; many horticultural specimens have been bred to bear many rows of ray florets in a great variety of colors. The disc florets of wild taxa are yellow. Pollen grains are appropriately 34 microns. The fruit is a ribbed achene.Chrysanthemum. Flora of China. eFloras.

The plant is particularly significant during the Double Ninth Festival. Chrysanthemum cultivation began in Japan during the Nara and Heian periods (early 8th to late 12th centuries), and gained popularity in the Edo period (early 17th to late 19th century). Many flower shapes, colours, and varieties were created. The way the flowers were grown and shaped also developed, and chrysanthemum culture flourished.

It was started in 910, when the imperial court held its first chrysanthemum show. Chrysanthemums entered American horticulture in 1798 when Colonel John Stevens imported a cultivated variety known as 'Dark Purple' from England. The introduction was part of an effort to grow attractions within Elysian Fields in Hoboken, New Jersey.The New York Botanical Garden, Curtis' Botanical Magazine, Volume X Bronx, New York: The New York Botanical Garden, 1797  Economic uses  = Ornamental uses = C. indicum Different colors of Chrysanthemum x morifolium Example of a Japanese bonsai chrysanthemum Modern cultivated chrysanthemums are showier than their wild relatives. The flower heads occur in various forms, and can be daisy-like or decorative, like pompons or buttons. This genus contains many hybrids and thousands of cultivars developed for horticultural purposes. In addition to the traditional yellow, other colors are available, such as white, purple, and red. The most important hybrid is Chrysanthemum √ó morifolium (syn. C. √ó grandiflorum), derived primarily from C. indicum, but also involving other species. Over 140 cultivars of chrysanthemum have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017). Chrysanthemums are divided into two basic groups, garden hardy and exhibition. Garden hardy mums are new perennials capable of wintering in most northern latitudes. Exhibition varieties are not usually as sturdy. Garden hardies are defined by their ability to produce an abundance of small blooms with little if any mechanical assistance, such as staking, and withstanding wind and rain. Exhibition varieties, though, require staking, overwintering in a relatively dry, cool environment, and sometimes the addition of night lights. The exhibition varieties can be used to create many amazing plant forms, such as large disbudded blooms, spray forms, and many artistically trained forms, such as thousand-bloom, standard (trees), fans, hanging baskets, topiary, bonsai, and cascades. Chrysanthemum blooms are divided into 13 different bloom forms by the US National Chrysanthemum Society, Inc., which is in keeping with the international classification system. The bloom forms are defined by the way in which the ray and disk florets are arranged. Chrysanthemum blooms are composed of many individual flowers (florets), each one capable of producing a seed. The disk florets are in the center of the bloom head, and the ray florets are on the perimeter. The ray florets are considered imperfect flowers, as they only possess the female reproductive organs, while the disk florets are considered perfect flowers, as they possess both male and female reproductive organs. Irregular incurves are bred to produce a giant head called an ogiku. The disk florets are concealed in layers of curving ray florets that hang down to create a 'skirt'. Regular incurves are similar, but usually with smaller blooms and a dense, globular form. Intermediate incurve blooms may have broader florets and a less densely flowered head. In the reflex form, the disk florets are concealed and the ray florets reflex outwards to create a mop-like appearance. The decorative form is similar to reflex blooms, but the ray florets usually do not radiate at more than a 90¬∞ angle to the stem. The pompon form is fully double, of small size, and very globular in form. Single and semidouble blooms have exposed disk florets and one to seven rows of ray florets. In the anemone form, the disk florets are prominent, often raised and overshadowing the ray florets. The spoon-form disk florets are visible and the long, tubular ray florets are spatulate. In the spider form, the disk florets are concealed, and the ray florets are tube-like with hooked or barbed ends, hanging loosely around the stem. In the brush and thistle variety, the disk florets may be visible. In Japan, a form of bonsai chrysanthemum was developed over the centuries. The cultivated flower has a lifespan of about 5 years and can be kept in miniature size. Another method is to use pieces of dead wood and the flower grows over the back along the wood to give the illusion from the front that the miniature tree blooms. = Culinary uses = Yellow or white chrysanthemum flowers of the species C. morifolium are boiled to make a tea in some parts of East Asia. The resulting beverage is known simply as chrysanthemum tea (Ëèä Ëä± Ëå∂, pinyin: j√∫huƒÅ ch√°, in Chinese). In Korea, a rice wine flavored with chrysanthemum flowers is called gukhwaju (Íµ≠ÌôîÏ£º). Chrysanthemum leaves are steamed or boiled and used as greens, especially in Chinese cuisine. The flowers may be added to dishes such as mixian in broth, or thick snakemeat soup (ËõáÁæπ) to enhance the aroma. Japanese cuisine sashimi uses small chrysanthemums as garnish. = Insecticidal uses = Pyrethrum (Chrysanthemum [or Tanacetum] cinerariaefolium) is economically important as a natural source of insecticide. The flowers are pulverized, and the active components, called pyrethrins, which occur in the achenes, are extracted and sold in the form of an oleoresin. This is applied as a suspension in water or oil, or as a powder. Pyrethrins attack the nervous systems of all insects, and inhibit female mosquitoes from biting. In sublethal doses, they have an insect-repellent effect. They are harmful to fish, but are far less toxic to mammals and birds than many synthetic insecticides. They are not persistent, being biodegradable, and also decompose easily on exposure to light. Pyrethroids such as permethrin are synthetic insecticides based on natural pyrethrum. Despite this, chrysanthemum leaves are still a major host for destructive pests, such as leafminer flies including L. trifolii. Persian powder is an example of industrial product of chrysanthemum insecticide. = Environmental uses = Chrysanthemum plants have been shown to reduce indoor air pollution by the NASA Clean Air Study.  Cultural significance and symbolism  In some countries of Europe (e.g., France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Poland, Hungary, Croatia), incurve chrysanthemums symbolize death and are used only for funerals or on graves, while other types carry no such symbolism; similarly, in China, Japan, and Korea of East Asia, white chrysanthemums symbolize adversity, lamentation, and/or grief. In some other countries, they represent honesty.Flower Meaning. Retrieved 22 September 2007. In the United States, the flower is usually regarded as positive and cheerful, with New Orleans as a notable exception. In the Victorian language of flowers, the chrysanthemum had several meanings. The Chinese chrysanthemum meant cheerfulness, whereas the red chrysanthemum stood for \\"I Love\\", while the yellow chrysanthemum symbolized slighted love. The chrysanthemum is also the flower of November. =East Asia=  China  Ming dynasty red lacquerware dish with carved chrysanthemums and dragons * The chrysanthemum is the city flower of Beijing and Kaifeng. The tradition of cultivating different varieties of chrysanthemums stretches back 1600 years, and the scale reached a phenomenal level during the Song dynasty until its loss to the J√ºrchens in 1126. The city has held the Kaifeng Chrysanthemum Cultural Festival since 1983 (renamed China Kaifeng Chrysanthemum Cultural Festival in 1994). The event is the largest chrysanthemum festival in China; it has been a yearly feature since, taking place between 18 October and 18 November every year. * The chrysanthemum is one of the \\"Four Gentlemen\\" () of China (the others being the plum blossom, the orchid, and bamboo). The chrysanthemum is said to have been favored by Tao Qian, an influential Chinese poet, and is symbolic of nobility. It is also one of the four symbolic seasonal flowers. * A chrysanthemum festival is held each year in Tongxiang, near Hangzhou, China. * Chrysanthemums are the topic in hundreds of poems of China. * The \\"golden flower\\" referred to in the 2006 movie Curse of the Golden Flower is a chrysanthemum. * \\"Chrysanthemum Gate\\" (j√∫ huƒÅ m√©n ), often abbreviated as Chrysanthemum (ËèäËä±), is taboo slang meaning \\"anus\\" (with sexual connotations). * An ancient Chinese city (Xiaolan Town of Zhongshan City) was named Ju-Xian, meaning \\"chrysanthemum city\\". * The plant is particularly significant during the Chinese Double Ninth Festival. * In Chinese culture, the chrysanthemum is a symbol of autumn and the flower of the ninth moon. People even drank chrysanthemum wine on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month to prolong their lives during the Han dynasty. It is a symbol of longevity because of its health-giving properties.\\"Chinese Symbols.\\" The British Museum, 2008. Accessed 4 October 2017. Because of all of this, the flower was often worn on funeral attire. * Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China listed two kinds of chrysanthemum for medical use, Yejuhua and Juhua. Historically Yejuhua is said to treat carbuncle, furuncle, conjunctivitis, headache, and vertigo. Juhua is said to treat cold, headache, vertigo, and conjunctivitis.  Japan  Chrysanthemum shows have been traditionally held in many Japanese towns.LOVE OF FLOWERS. \\"Sketches of Japanese manners and customs\\" Jacob Mortimer Wier Silver, 1867 Chrysanthemums first arrived in Japan by way of China in the 5th century. By the Heian Period, the flower was cultivated throughout Japan. It represented the noble class and the season of autumn, and the Japanese even had a Chrysanthemum festival. When the flower was adopted for the Imperial Seal of Japan some families also cultivated it to signal their support and good relationship with the Imperial family. In the present day, each autumn there are chrysanthemum exhibitions at the Meiji Shrine and Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo. The Yasukuni Shrine, formerly a state-endowed shrine (ÂÆòÂõΩÂºäÁ§æ, kankokuheisha) has adopted the chrysanthemum crest. Culinary-grade chrysanthemums are used to decorate food, and they remain a common motif for traditional Japanese arts like porcelain, lacquerware and kimono. Chrysanthemum growing is still practised actively as a hobby by many Japanese people who enter prize plants in contests. Chrysanthemum \\"dolls\\", often depicting fictional characters from both traditional sources like kabuki and contemporary sources like Disney, are displayed throughout the fall months, and the city of Nihonmatsu hosts the \\"Nihonmatsu Chrysanthemum Dolls Exhibition\\" every autumn in historical ruin of Nihonmatsu Castle. They are also grown into chrysanthemum bonsai forms. * In Japan, the chrysanthemum is a symbol of the Emperor and the Imperial family. In particular, a \\"chrysanthemum crest\\" (ËèäËä±Á¥ãÁ´†, kikukamonsh≈ç or kikkamonsh≈ç), i.e. a mon of chrysanthemum blossom design, indicates a link to the Emperor; there are more than 150 patterns of this design. Notable uses of and reference to the Imperial chrysanthemum include: ** The Imperial Seal of Japan is used by members of the Japanese imperial family. In 1869, a two-layered, 16-petal design was designated as the symbol of the emperor. Princes used a simpler, single-layer pattern. ** The Chrysanthemum Throne is the name given to the position of Japanese Emperor and the throne. ** The Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum is a Japanese honor awarded by the emperor on the advice of the Japanese government. ** In imperial Japan, small arms were required to be stamped with the imperial chrysanthemum, as they were considered the personal property of the emperor. * The Nagoya Castle Chrysanthemum Competition started after the end of the Pacific War. The event at the castle has become a tradition for the city. With three categories, it is one of the largest events of its kind in the region by both scale and content. The first category is the exhibition of cultivated flowers. The second category is for bonsai flowers, which are combined with dead pieces of wood to give the illusion of miniature trees. The third category is the creation of miniature landscapes.

This article covers British literature in the English language. Anglo-Saxon (Old English) literature is included, and there is some discussion of Latin and Anglo-Norman literature, where literature in these languages relate to the early development of the English language and literature. There is also some brief discussion of major figures who wrote in Scots, but the main discussion is in the various Scottish literature articles. The article Literature in the other languages of Britain focuses on the literatures written in the other languages that are, and have been, used in Britain. There are also articles on these various literatures: Latin literature in Britain, Anglo-Norman, Cornish, Guern√©siais, J√®rriais, Latin, Manx, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, etc. Irish writers have played an important part in the development of literature in England and Scotland, but though the whole of Ireland was politically part of the United Kingdom between January 1801 and December 1922, it can be controversial to describe Irish literature as British. For some this includes works by authors from Northern Ireland. British identity The nature of British identity has changed over time. The island that contains England, Scotland, and Wales has been known as Britain from the time of the Roman Pliny the Elder (c. AD 23‚Äì79).Pliny the Elder's Naturalis Historia Book IV. Chapter XLI Latin text and English translation, numbered Book 4, Chapter 30, at the Perseus Project. English as the national language had its beginnings with the Anglo-Saxon invasion which started around AD 450.Jones & Casey 1988:367‚Äì98 \\"The Gallic Chronicle Restored: a Chronology for the Anglo-Saxon Invasions and the End of Roman Britain\\". Before that, the inhabitants mainly spoke various Celtic languages. The various constituent parts of the present United Kingdom joined at different times. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1542. However, it was not until 1707 with a treaty between England and Scotland, that the Kingdom of Great Britain came into existence. This merged in January 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Until fairly recent times Celtic languages continued to be spoken widely in Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, and Ireland, and these languages still survive, especially in parts of Wales. Subsequently, Irish nationalism led to the partition of the island of Ireland in 1921; thus literature of the Republic of Ireland is not British, although literature from Northern Ireland is both Irish and British. Works written in the English language by Welsh writers, especially if their subject matter relates to Wales, has been recognised as a distinctive entity since the 20th century. The need for a separate identity for this kind of writing arose because of the parallel development of modern Welsh-language literature.Raymond Garlick An Introduction to Anglo-Welsh Literature (University of Wales Press, 1970) Because Britain was a colonial power the use of English spread through the world; from the 19th century or earlier in the United States, and later in other former colonies, major writers in English began to appear beyond the boundaries of Britain and Ireland; later these included Nobel laureates. The coming of the Anglo-Saxons: 449‚Äìc.1066 =The other languages of early Britain= Although the Romans withdrew from Britain in the early 5th century, Latin literature, mostly ecclesiastical, continued to be written, including Chronicles by Bede (672/3‚Äì735), Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum; and Gildas (c. 500‚Äì570), De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae. A facsimile page of Y Gododdin c. 1275 Various Celtic languages were spoken by many British people at that time. Among the most important written works that have survived are Y Gododdin and the Mabinogion. From the 8th to the 15th centuries, Vikings and Norse settlers and their descendants colonised parts of what is now modern Scotland. Some Old Norse poetry survives relating to this period, including the Orkneyinga saga an historical narrative of the history of the Orkney Islands, from their capture by the Norwegian king in the 9th century until about 1200. =Old English literature: c. 658‚Äì1100= First page facsimile of Beowulf Old English literature, or Anglo-Saxon literature, encompasses the surviving literature written in Old English in Anglo-Saxon England, from the settlement of the Saxons and other Germanic tribes in England (Jutes and the Angles) around 450, until \\"soon after the Norman Conquest\\" in 1066; that is, c. 1100‚Äì50. These works include genres such as epic poetry, hagiography, sermons, Bible translations, legal works, chronicles, riddles, and others.Angus Cameron (1983). \\"Anglo-Saxon literature\\" in Dictionary of the Middle Ages, v. 1, pp. 274‚Äì88. In all there are about 400 surviving manuscripts from the period. Oral tradition was very strong in early English culture and most literary works were written to be performed... Epic poems were thus very popular, and some, including Beowulf, have survived to the present day. Beowulf is the most famous work in Old English and has achieved national epic status in England, despite being set in Scandinavia. Nearly all Anglo-Saxon authors are anonymous: twelve are known by name from medieval sources, but only four of those are known by their vernacular works with any certainty: C√¶dmon, Bede, Alfred the Great, and Cynewulf. C√¶dmon is the earliest English poet whose name is known.O'Keeffe, Katherine O'Brien (January 1987). \\"Orality and the Developing Text of Caedmon's Hymn\\". Speculum 62 (1). . C√¶dmon's only known surviving work is C√¶dmon's Hymn, which probably dates from the late 7th century. Chronicles contained a range of historical and literary accounts, and a notable example is the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.Stanley Brian Greenfield, A New Critical History of Old English Literature (New York: New York University Press, 1986). The poem Battle of Maldon also deals with history. This is the name given to a work, of uncertain date, celebrating the real Battle of Maldon of 991, at which the Anglo-Saxons failed to prevent a Viking invasion. Classical antiquity was not forgotten in Anglo-Saxon England, and several Old English poems are adaptations of late classical philosophical texts. The longest is King Alfred's (849‚Äì99) translation of Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy.Walter John Sedgefield (ed.), King Alfred's Old English Version of Boethius: De consolatione philosophiae, 1968 (1899) Late medieval literature: 1066‚Äì1485 Sir Bedivere casts King Arthur's sword Excalibur back to the Lady of the Lake. The Arthurian Cycle has influenced British literature across languages and down the centuries. The linguistic diversity of the islands in the medieval period contributed to a rich variety of artistic production, and made British literature distinctive and innovative.Language and Literature, Ian Short, in A Companion to the Anglo-Norman World, edited Christopher Harper-Bill and Elisabeth van Houts, Woodbridge 2003, Some works were still written in Latin; these include Gerald of Wales's late-12th-century book on his beloved Wales, Itinerarium Cambriae. After the Norman Conquest of 1066, Anglo-Norman literature developed, introducing literary trends from Continental Europe, such as the chanson de geste. However, the indigenous development of Anglo-Norman literature was precocious in comparison to continental O√Øl literature. Geoffrey of Monmouth (c. 1100 ‚Äì c. 1155) was one of the major figures in the development of British history and of the popularity of the tales of King Arthur. He is best known for his chronicle Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain) of 1136, which spread Celtic motifs to a wider audience. Wace (c. 1110 ‚Äì after 1174), who wrote in Norman-French, is the earliest known poet from Jersey; he also developed the Arthurian legend.Burgess, ed., xiii;) At the end of the 12th century, Layamon in Brut adapted Wace to make the first English-language work to use the legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. It was also the first historiography written in English since the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. =Middle English= Interest in King Arthur continued in the 15th century with Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur (1485), a popular and influential compilation of some French and English Arthurian romances. It was among the earliest books printed in England by Caxton. In the later medieval period a new form of English now known as Middle English evolved. This is the earliest form which is comprehensible to modern readers and listeners, albeit not easily. Middle English Bible translations, notably Wycliffe's Bible, helped to establish English as a literary language. Wycliffe's Bible is the name now given to a group of Bible translations into Middle English that were made under the direction of, or at the instigation of, John Wycliffe. They appeared over a period from about 1382 to 1395. Piers Plowman or Visio Willelmi de Petro Plowman (William's Vision of Piers Plowman) (written c. 1360‚Äì1387) is a Middle English allegorical narrative poem by William Langland. It is written in unrhymed alliterative verse divided into sections called \\"pass≈´s\\" (Latin for \\"steps\\"). Piers is considered by many critics to be one of the early great works of English literature along with Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight during the Middle Ages. Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is a late-14th-century Middle English alliterative romance. It is one of the better-known Arthurian stories, of an established type known as the \\"beheading game\\". Developing from Welsh, Irish and English tradition Sir Gawain highlights the importance of honour and chivalry. \\"Preserved in the same manuscript with Sir Gawayne were three other poems, now generally accepted as the work of its author, including the intricate elegiac poem, Pearl.\\"\\"Sir Gawayne and the Grene Knight.\\" Encyclopaedia Britannica. Encyclopaedia Britannica Online Academic Edition.. Geoffrey Chaucer, father of English literature Geoffrey Chaucer (c. 1343 ‚Äì 1400), known as the Father of English literature, is widely considered the greatest English poet of the Middle Ages and was the first poet to have been buried in Poet's Corner in Westminster Abbey. Chaucer is best known today for The Canterbury Tales, a collection of stories written in Middle English (mostly written in verse although some are in prose), that are presented as part of a story-telling contest by a group of pilgrims as they travel together on a journey from Southwark to the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral. Chaucer is a crucial figure in developing the legitimacy of the vernacular, Middle English, at a time when the dominant literary languages in England were French and Latin. The multilingual nature of the audience for literature in the 14th century can be illustrated by the example of John Gower (c. 1330 ‚Äì October 1408). A contemporary of Langland and a personal friend of Chaucer, Gower is remembered primarily for three major works, the Mirroir de l'Omme, Vox Clamantis, and Confessio Amantis, three long poems written in Anglo- Norman, Latin, and Middle English respectively, which are united by common moral and political themes. Women writers were also active, such as Marie de France in the 12th century and Julian of Norwich in the early 14th century. Julian's Revelations of Divine Love (around 1393) is believed to be the first published book written by a woman in the English language. Margery Kempe (c. 1373 ‚Äì after 1438) is known for writing The Book of Margery Kempe, a work considered by some to be the first autobiography in the English language. Major Scottish writers from the 15th century include Henrysoun, Dunbar, Douglas and Lyndsay. The works of Chaucer had an influence on Scottish writers. =Medieval drama= In the Middle Ages, drama in the vernacular languages of Europe may have emerged from religious enactments of the liturgy. Mystery plays were presented on the porches of the cathedrals or by strolling players on feast days. Miracle and mystery plays, along with moralities and interludes, later evolved into more elaborate forms of drama, such as was seen on the Elizabethan stages. Another form of medieval theatre was the mummers' plays, a form of early street theatre associated with the Morris dance, concentrating on themes such as Saint George and the Dragon and Robin Hood. These were folk tales re-telling old stories, and the actors travelled from town to town performing these for their audiences in return for money and hospitality.Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory J. A. Cuddon. (London: Penguin Books,1999), p.523. Mystery plays and miracle plays are among the earliest formally developed plays in medieval Europe. Mystery plays focused on the representation of Bible stories in churches as tableaux with accompanying antiphonal song. They developed from the 10th to the 16th century, reaching the height of their popularity in the 15th century before being rendered obsolete by the rise of professional theatre. Nineteenth- century engraving of a performance from the Chester mystery play cycle. There are four complete or nearly complete extant English biblical collections of plays from the late medieval period. The most complete is the York cycle of forty-eight pageants. They were performed in the city of York, from the middle of the 14th century until 1569.A Glossary of Literary Terms, M. H. Abrams. (Fort Worth, Texas: Harcourt Brace, 1999, pp. 165‚Äì6. Besides the Middle English drama, there are three surviving plays in Cornish known as the Ordinalia.A Handbook of the Cornish Language, by Henry Jenner A Project Gutenberg eBook;A brief history of the Cornish language . Having grown out of the religiously based mystery plays, the morality play is a genre of medieval and early Tudor theatrical entertainment, which represented a shift towards a more secular base for European theatre.Richardson and Johnston (1991, 97‚Äì98). Morality plays are a type of allegory in which the protagonist is met by personifications of various moral attributes who try to prompt him to choose a godly life over one of evil. The plays were most popular in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries.Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory, p. 523. The Somonyng of Everyman (The Summoning of Everyman) (c. 1509 ‚Äì 1519), usually referred to simply as Everyman, is a late 15th-century English morality play. Like John Bunyan's allegory Pilgrim's Progress (1678), Everyman examines the question of Christian salvation through the use of allegorical characters.The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Vol.1 (2000), pp. 445ff and The Oxford Companion to English Literature (1996), p. 775. The Renaissance: 1485 ‚Äì1660 The English Renaissance and the Renaissance in Scotland date from the late 15th century to the early 17th century. Italian literary influences arrived in Britain: the sonnet form was introduced into English by Thomas Wyatt in the early 16th century, and was developed by Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, (1516/1517 ‚Äì 1547), who also introduced blank verse into England, with his translation of Virgil's Aeneid in c. 1540.J. A. Cuddon, The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory. (London: Penguin Books, 1999), pp. 844‚Äì5, and p.89. The spread of printing affected the transmission of literature across Britain and Ireland. The first book printed in English, William Caxton's own translation of Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye, was printed abroad in 1473, to be followed by the establishment of the first printing press in England in 1474. Thomas More book Utopia, illustration of imaginary island, 1516 Latin continued in use as a language of learning long after the Reformation had established the vernaculars as liturgical languages for the elites. Utopia is a work of fiction and political philosophy by Thomas More (1478‚Äì1535) published in 1516. The book, written in Latin, is a frame narrative primarily depicting a fictional island society and its religious, social and political customs. =Elizabethan era: 1558‚Äì1603= William Shakespeare's career straddled the change of Tudor and Stuart dynasties and encompassed English history and the emerging imperial idea of the 17th century Poetry In the later 16th century, English poetry used elaborate language and extensive allusions to classical myths. Sir Edmund Spenser (1555‚Äì99) was the author of The Faerie Queene, an epic poem and fantastical allegory celebrating the Tudor dynasty and Elizabeth I. The works of Sir Philip Sidney (1554‚Äì1586), a poet, courtier and soldier, include Astrophel and Stella, The Defence of Poetry, and Arcadia. Poems intended to be set to music as songs, such as those by Thomas Campion, became popular as printed literature was disseminated more widely in households (see English Madrigal School). Drama During the reign of Elizabeth I (1558‚Äì1603) and then James I (1603‚Äì25), a London-centred culture that was both courtly and popular, produced great poetry and drama. The English playwrights were intrigued by Italian model: a conspicuous community of Italian actors had settled in London. The linguist and lexicographer John Florio (1553‚Äì1625), whose father was Italian, was a royal language tutor at the Court of James I, and a possible friend and influence on William Shakespeare, had brought much of the Italian language and culture to England. He was also the translator of Montaigne into English. The earliest Elizabethan plays include Gorboduc (1561), by Sackville and Norton, and Thomas Kyd's (1558‚Äì94) revenge tragedy The Spanish Tragedy (1592). Highly popular and influential in its time, The Spanish Tragedy established a new genre in English literature theatre, the revenge play or revenge tragedy. Jane Lumley (1537‚Äì1578) was the first person to translate Euripides into English. Her translation of Iphigeneia at Aulis is the first known dramatic work by a woman in English.Buck, Claire, ed. \\"Lumley, Joanna Fitzalan (c. 1537‚Äì1576/77).\\" The Bloomsbury Guide to Women's Literature. New York: Prentice Hall, 1992. 764. William Shakespeare (1564‚Äì1616) stands out in this period as a poet and playwright as yet unsurpassed. Shakespeare wrote plays in a variety of genres, including histories, tragedies, comedies and the late romances, or tragicomedies. Works written in the Elizabethan era include the comedy Twelfth Night, tragedy Hamlet, and history Henry IV, Part 1. = Jacobean period: 1603-1625= Drama Shakespeare's career continued during the reign of King James I, and in the early 17th century he wrote the so-called \\"problem plays\\", like Measure for Measure, as well as a number of his best known tragedies, including King Lear and Anthony and Cleopatra.; . The plots of Shakespeare's tragedies often hinge on fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves.. In his final period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed four major plays, including The Tempest. Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors.. Other important figures in Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre include Christopher Marlowe (1564‚Äì1593), Thomas Dekker (c. 1572 ‚Äì 1632), John Fletcher (1579‚Äì1625) and Francis Beaumont (1584‚Äì1616). Marlowe's subject matter is different from Shakespeare's as it focuses more on the moral drama of the renaissance man. His play Doctor Faustus (c. 1592), is about a scientist and magician who sells his soul to the Devil. Beaumont and Fletcher are less known, but they may have helped Shakespeare write some of his best dramas, and were popular at the time. Beaumont's comedy, The Knight of the Burning Pestle (1607), satirises the rising middle class and especially the nouveaux riches. After Shakespeare's death, the poet and dramatist Ben Jonson (1572‚Äì1637) was the leading literary figure of the Jacobean era. Jonson's aesthetics hark back to the Middle Ages and his characters embody the theory of humours, based on contemporary medical theory, though the stock types of Latin literature were an equal influence.\\"Ben Jonson.\\" Encyclopaedia Britannica. Encyclopaedia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 20 September 2012. http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/127459/Ben Jonson. Jonson's major plays include Volpone (1605 or 1606) and Bartholomew Fair (1614). A popular style of theatre in Jacobean times was the revenge play, which had been popularised earlier by Thomas Kyd (1558‚Äì94), and then developed by John Webster (1578‚Äì1632) in the 17th century. Webster's most famous plays are The White Devil (1612) and The Duchess of Malfi (1613). Other revenge tragedies include The Changeling written by Thomas Middleton and William Rowley. Poetry Shakespeare also popularised the English sonnet, which made significant changes to Petrarch's model. A collection of 154 sonnets, dealing with themes such as the passage of time, love, beauty and mortality, were first published in a 1609 quarto. Francis Bacon Besides Shakespeare the major poets of the early 17th century included the metaphysical poets John Donne (1572‚Äì1631) and George Herbert (1593‚Äì1633). Influenced by continental Baroque, and taking as his subject matter both Christian mysticism and eroticism, Donne's metaphysical poetry uses unconventional or \\"unpoetic\\" figures, such as a compass or a mosquito, to achieve surprise effects. George Chapman (?1559-?1634) was a successful playwright who is remembered chiefly for his translation in 1616 of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey into English verse. This was the first ever complete translation of either poem into the English language and it had a profound influence on English literature. =Prose= Philosopher Sir Francis Bacon (1561‚Äì1626) wrote the utopian novel New Atlantis, and coined the phrase \\"Knowledge is Power\\". Francis Godwin's 1638 The Man in the Moone recounts an imaginary voyage to the moon and is now regarded as the first work of science fiction in English literature. At the Reformation, the translation of liturgy and the Bible into vernacular languages provided new literary models. The Book of Common Prayer (1549) and the Authorised King James Version of the Bible have been hugely influential. The King James Bible, one of the biggest translation projects in the history of English up to that time, was started in 1604 and completed in 1611. It continued the tradition of Bible translation into English from the original languages that began with the work of William Tyndale. (Previous translations into English had relied on the Vulgate). It became the standard Bible of the Church of England, and some consider it one of the greatest literary works of all time. =Late Renaissance: 1625‚Äì1660= Samuel Pepys, took the diary beyond mere business transaction notes, into the realm of the personal The metaphysical poets continued writing in this period. Both John Donne and George Herbert died after 1625, but there was a second generation of metaphysical poets: Andrew Marvell (1621‚Äì1678), Thomas Traherne (1636 or 1637‚Äì1674) and Henry Vaughan (1622‚Äì1695). Their style was witty, with metaphysical conceits ‚Äî far-fetched or unusual similes or metaphors, such as Marvell's comparison of the soul with a drop of dew;\\"On a Drop of Dew\\", Poetry Foundation or Donne's description of the effects of absence on lovers to the action of a pair of compasses.\\"A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning\\", Poetry Foundation Another important group of poets at this time were the Cavalier poets. They were an important group of writers, who came from the classes that supported King Charles I during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (1639‚Äì51). (King Charles reigned from 1625 and was executed in 1649). The best known of these poets are Robert Herrick, Richard Lovelace, Thomas Carew, and Sir John Suckling. They \\"were not a formal group, but all were influenced\\" by Ben Jonson.The Oxford Companion to English Literature, ed. Margaret Drabble, p. 181. Most of the Cavalier poets were courtiers, with notable exceptions. For example, Robert Herrick was not a courtier, but his style marks him as a Cavalier poet. Cavalier works make use of allegory and classical allusions, and are influenced by Latin authors Horace, Cicero, and Ovid. John Milton (1608‚Äì74) is one of the greatest English poets, who wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval. He is generally seen as the last major poet of the English Renaissance, though his major epic poems were written in the Restoration period, including Paradise Lost (1671). Among these are L'Allegro, 1631; Il Penseroso, 1634; Comus (a masque), 1638; and Lycidas, (1638). His later major works are Paradise Regained, 1671 and Samson Agonistes, 1671. Milton's works reflect deep personal convictions, a passion for freedom and self-determination, and the urgent issues and political turbulence of his day. Writing in English, Latin, and Italian, he achieved international renown within his lifetime, and his celebrated Areopagitica (1644), written in condemnation of pre-publication censorship, is among history's most influential and impassioned defences of free speech and freedom of the press. William Hayley's 1796 biography called him the \\"greatest English author\\",McCalman 2001 p. 605. and he remains generally regarded \\"as one of the preeminent writers in the English language\\".Contemporary Literary Criticism, \\"Milton, John ‚Äì Introduction\\" John Milton. His religious epic poem Paradise Lost was published in 1667. Thomas Urquhart (1611‚Äì1660) translation of Rabelais' Gargantua and Pantagruel into English has been described as \\"the greatest Scottish translation since Gavin Douglas's Eneados\\". The Restoration: 1660‚Äì1700 =Drama= The Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 launched a fresh start for literature, both in celebration of the new worldly and playful court of the king, and in reaction to it. Theatres in England reopened after having been closed during the protectorship of Oliver Cromwell, Puritanism lost its momentum, and the bawdy \\"Restoration comedy\\" became a recognisable genre. Restoration comedy refers to English comedies written and performed in the Restoration period from 1660 to 1710.George Henry Nettleton, Arthur, British dramatists from Dryden to Sheridan p. 149. In addition, women were allowed to perform on stage for the first time. The Restoration of the monarchy in Ireland enabled Ogilby to resume his position as Master of the Revels and open the first Theatre Royal in Dublin in 1662 in Smock Alley. In 1662 Katherine Philips went to Dublin where she completed a translation of Pierre Corneille's Pomp√©e, produced with great success in 1663 in the Smock Alley Theatre, and printed in the same year both in Dublin and London. Although other women had translated or written dramas, her translation of Pompey broke new ground as the first rhymed version of a French tragedy in English and the first English play written by a woman to be performed on the professional stage. Aphra Behn (one of the women writers dubbed \\"The fair triumvirate of wit\\") was a prolific dramatist and one of the first English professional female writers. Her greatest dramatic success was The Rover (1677). Aphra Behn =Poetry= Behn's depiction of the character Willmore in The Rover and the witty, poetry-reciting rake Dorimant in George Etherege's The Man of Mode (1676) are seen as a satire on John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester (1647‚Äì1680), an English libertine poet, and a wit of the Restoration court. His contemporary Andrew Marvell described him as \\"the best English satirist\\", and he is generally considered to be the most considerable poet and the most learned among the Restoration wits. His A Satyr Against Reason and Mankind is assumed to be a Hobbesian critique of rationalism. Rochester's poetic work varies widely in form, genre, and content. He was part of a \\"mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease\\",Alexander Pope, \\"First Epistle of the Second Book of Horace\\", line 108. who continued to produce their poetry in manuscripts, rather than in publication. As a consequence, some of Rochester's work deals with topical concerns, such as satires of courtly affairs in libels, to parodies of the styles of his contemporaries, such as Sir Charles Scroope. He is also notable for his impromptus,Rochester composed at least 10 versions of Impromptus on Charles II luminarium.org Voltaire, who spoke of Rochester as \\"the man of genius, the great poet\\", admired his satire for its \\"energy and fire\\" and translated some lines into French to \\"display the shining imagination his lordship only could boast\\".Great Books Online , Fran√ßois Marie Arouet de Voltaire (1694‚Äì1778). \\"Letter XXI‚ÄîOn the Earl of Rochester and Mr. Waller\\" Letters on the English. The Harvard Classics. 1909‚Äì14, Bartleby.com, Accessed 15 May 2007 John Dryden (1631‚Äì1700) was an English poet, literary critic, translator, and playwright who dominated the literary life of Restoration England to such a point that the period came to be known in literary circles as the Age of Dryden. He established the heroic couplet as a standard form of English poetry by writing successful satires, religious pieces, fables, epigrams, compliments, prologues, and plays with it; he also introduced the alexandrine and triplet into the form. In his poems, translations, and criticism, he established a poetic diction appropriate to the heroic couplet. Dryden's greatest achievements were in satiric verse in works like the mock-heroic MacFlecknoe (1682). W. H. Auden referred to him as \\"the master of the middle style\\" that was a model for his contemporaries and for much of the 18th century.W. H. Auden, New Year Letter, in Collected Poems The considerable loss felt by the English literary community at his death was evident from the elegies that it inspired.John Dryden, Major Works, ed. by Keith Walker, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987), p.37. Alexander Pope (1688‚Äì1744) was heavily influenced by Dryden, and often borrowed from him; other writers in the 18th century were equally influenced by both Dryden and Pope. Though Ben Jonson had been poet laureate to James I in England, this was not then a formal position and the formal title of Poet Laureate, as a royal office, was first conferred by letters patent on John Dryden in 1670. The post then became a regular British institution. =Prose= Diarists John Evelyn (1620‚Äì1706) and Samuel Pepys (1633‚Äì1703) depicted everyday London life and the cultural scene of the times. Their works are among the most important primary sources for the Restoration period in England, and consists of eyewitness accounts of many great events, such as the Great Plague of London (1644‚Äì5), and the Great Fire of London (1666). The publication of The Pilgrim's Progress (Part I:1678; 1684), established the Puritan preacher John Bunyan (1628‚Äì88) as a notable writer. Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress is an allegory of personal salvation and a guide to the Christian life. Bunyan writes about how the individual can prevail against the temptations of mind and body that threaten damnation. The book is written in a straightforward narrative and shows influence from both drama and biography, and yet it also shows an awareness of the grand allegorical tradition found in Edmund Spenser. 18th-century =The Augustan age: 1701‚Äì1750= The late 17th, early 18th century (1689‚Äì1750) in English literature is known as the Augustan Age. Writers at this time \\"greatly admired their Roman counterparts, imitated their works and frequently drew parallels between\\" contemporary world and the age of the Roman emperor Augustus (27 AD ‚Äì BC 14)The Oxford Companion to English Literature, ed. Margaret Drabble. (Oxford: Oxford University Press,1996), p.52. (see Augustan literature (ancient Rome) ). Some of the major writers in this period were John Dryden (1631‚Äì1700), the Anglo-Irish writer Jonathan Swift (1667‚Äì1745), William Congreve, (1670‚Äì1729), Joseph Addison (1672‚Äì1719), Richard Steele (1672‚Äì1729), Alexander Pope (1688‚Äì1744), Henry Fielding (1707‚Äì54), Samuel Johnson (1709‚Äì84). 1707: Birth of Britain Portrait of Tobias Smollett. The Union of the Parliaments of Scotland and England in 1707 to form a single Kingdom of Great Britain and the creation of a joint state by the Acts of Union had little impact on the literature of England nor on national consciousness among English writers. The situation in Scotland was different: the desire to maintain a cultural identity while partaking of the advantages offered by the English literary market and English literary standard language led to what has been described as the \\"invention of British literature\\" by Scottish writers. English writers, if they considered Britain at all, tended to assume it was merely England writ large; Scottish writers were more clearly aware of the new state as a \\"cultural amalgam comprising more than just England\\". James Thomson's \\"Rule Britannia!\\" is an example of the Scottish championing of this new national and literary identity. With the invention of British literature came the development of the first British novels, in contrast to the English novel of the 18th century which continued to deal with England and English concerns rather than exploring the changed political, social and literary environment. Tobias Smollett (1721‚Äì71) was a Scottish pioneer of the British novel, exploring the prejudices inherent within the new social structure of the country through comic picaresque novels. His The Adventures of Roderick Random (1748) is the first major novel written in English to have a Scotsman as hero, and the multinational voices represented in the narrative confront Anti-Scottish sentiment, being published only two years after the Battle of Culloden. The Expedition of Humphry Clinker (1771) brings together characters from the extremes of Britain to question how cultural and linguistic differences can be accommodated within the new British identity, and influenced Charles Dickens. Richard Cumberland wrote patriotic comedies depicting characters taken from the \\"outskirts of the empire,\\".\\"Richard Cumberland\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition His most popular play, \\"The West Indian\\" (1771) was performed in North America and the West Indies. Prose, including the novel In prose, the earlier part of the period was overshadowed by the development of the English essay. Joseph Addison and Richard Steele's The Spectator established the form of the British periodical essay, inventing the pose of the detached observer of human life who can meditate upon the world without advocating any specific changes in it. However, this was also the time when the English novel, first emerging in the Restoration, developed into a major art form. Daniel Defoe turned from journalism and writing criminal lives for the press to writing fictional criminal lives with Roxana and Moll Flanders. Daniel Defoe's 1719 castaway novel Robinson Crusoe, with Crusoe standing over Man Friday after freeing him from the cannibals The English novel has generally been seen as beginning with Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719) and Moll Flanders (1722),\\"Defoe\\", The Oxford Companion to English Literature, ed. Margaret Drabble. (Oxford: Oxforsd University Press,1996), p.265. though John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress (1678) and Aphra Behn's, Oroonoko (1688) are also contenders.J. A. Cuddon, A Dictionary of Literary Terms. (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books,1984), pp. 433, 434. Other major 18th-century British novelists are Samuel Richardson (1689‚Äì1761), author of the epistolary novels Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (1740) and Clarissa (1747‚Äì48); Henry Fielding (1707‚Äì54), who wrote Joseph Andrews (1742) and The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling (1749). If Addison and Steele were dominant in one type of prose, then Jonathan Swift author of the satire Gulliver's Travels was in another. In A Modest Proposal and the Drapier Letters, Swift reluctantly defended the Irish people from the predations of colonialism. This provoked riots and arrests, but Swift, who had no love of Irish Roman Catholics, was outraged by the abuses he saw. The English pictorial satirist and editorial cartoonist William Hogarth (1697‚Äì1764) has been credited with pioneering Western sequential art. His work ranged from realistic portraiture to comic strip-like series of pictures called \\"modern moral subjects\\". Much of his work satirises contemporary politics and customs.The British Museum. Beer Street, William Hogarth ‚Äì Fine Art Print . Retrieved 12 April 2010. Drama Although documented history of Irish theatre began at least as early as 1601, the earliest Irish dramatists of note were William Congreve (1670‚Äì1729), one of the most interesting writers of Restoration comedies and author of The Way of the World (1700) and playwright, George Farquhar (?1677‚Äì1707), The Recruiting Officer (1706). (Restoration comedy refers to English comedies written and performed in the Restoration period from 1660 to 1710. Comedy of manners is used as a synonym of Restoration comedy). Anglo-Irish drama in the 18th century also includes Charles Macklin (?1699‚Äì1797), and Arthur Murphy (1727‚Äì1805). The age of Augustan drama was brought to an end by the censorship established by the Licensing Act 1737. After 1737, authors with strong political or philosophical points to make would no longer turn to the stage as their first hope of making a living, and novels began to have dramatic structures involving only normal human beings, as the stage was closed off for serious authors. Prior to the Licensing Act 1737, theatre was the first choice for most wits. After it, the novel was Poetry The most outstanding poet of the age is Alexander Pope (1688‚Äì1744), whose major works include: The Rape of the Lock (1712; enlarged in 1714); a translation of the Iliad (1715‚Äì20); a translation of the Odyssey (1725‚Äì26); The Dunciad (1728; 1743). Since his death, Pope has been in a constant state of re-evaluation. His high artifice, strict prosody, and, at times, the sheer cruelty of his satire were an object of derision for the Romantic poets, and it was not until the 1930s that his reputation was revived. Pope is now considered the dominant poetic voice of his century, a model of prosodic elegance, biting wit, and an enduring, demanding moral force. The Rape of the Lock and The Dunciad are masterpieces of the mock-epic genre.J. A. Cuddon, A Dictionary of Literary Terms. (London: Penguin, 1999), p.514. Pope It was during this time that poet James Thomson (1700‚Äì48) produced his melancholy The Seasons (1728‚Äì30) and Edward Young (1681‚Äì1765) wrote his poem Night-Thoughts (1742). =The roots of Romanticism: 1750‚Äì1798= Robert Burns inspired many vernacular writers across Britain and Ireland. The second half of the 18th century is sometimes called the \\"Age of Johnson\\". Samuel Johnson (1709‚Äì1784), often referred to as Dr Johnson, was an English author who made lasting contributions to English literature as a poet, essayist, moralist, literary critic, biographer, editor and lexicographer. Johnson has been described as \\"arguably the most distinguished man of letters in English history\\". After nine years of work, Johnson's A Dictionary of the English Language was published in 1755; it had a far-reaching effect on Modern English and has been described as \\"one of the greatest single achievements of scholarship.\\". Through works such as the \\"Dictionary, his edition of Shakespeare, and his Lives of the Poets in particular, he helped invent what we now call English Literature\\".\\"Samuel Johnson.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.

This period of the 18th century saw the emergence of three major Irish authors Oliver Goldsmith (1728‚Äì1774), Richard Brinsley Sheridan (1751‚Äì1816), and Laurence Sterne (1713‚Äì68). Goldsmith settled in London in 1756, where he published the novel The Vicar of Wakefield (1766), a pastoral poem The Deserted Village (1770) and two plays, The Good-Natur'd Man 1768 and She Stoops to Conquer 1773. Sheridan was born in Dublin, but his family moved to England in the 1750s. His first play, The Rivals 1775, was performed at Covent Garden and was an instant success. He went on to become the most significant London playwright of the late 18th century with plays like The School for Scandal and The Critic. Sterne published his famous novel Tristram Shandy in parts between 1759 and 1767.The Oxford Companion to English Literature, p.947. The sentimental novel or the novel of sensibility is a genre which developed during the second half of the 18th century.Richard Maxwell and Katie Trumpener, eds., The Cambridge Companion to Fiction in the Romantic Period (2008). Among the most famous sentimental novels in English are Samuel Richardson's Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (1740), Oliver Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield (1766), and Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy (1759 ‚Äì 67).J. A. Cuddon, A Dictionary of Literary Terms (1999), p. 809. Another novel genre also developed in this period.

To this was added, by later practitioners, a feeling for the 'sublime' and uncanny, and an interest in ancient English poetic forms and folk poetry.William Harmon and C. Hugh Holman, A Handbook to Literature. (Uper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1986), pp. 452‚Äì3, 502. They are often considered precursors of the Gothic genre.A Handbook to Literature, p. 238.

Other precursors of Romanticism are the poets James Thomson (1700‚Äì48) and James Macpherson (1736‚Äì96), the Gothic novel and the novel of sensibility.J. A.

Web. 5 October 2012. . Also foreshadowing Romanticism was Gothic fiction, in works such as Horace Walpole's 1764 novel The Castle of Otranto. The Gothic fiction genre combines elements of horror and romance. A pioneering Gothic novelist was Ann Radcliffe author of The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794). The Monk (1796), by Matthew Lewis, is another notable early work in both the Gothic and horror genres. James Macpherson (1736‚Äì96) was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation. Claiming to have found poetry written by the ancient bard Ossian, he published translations that acquired international popularity, being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the Classical epics. Both Robert Burns (1759‚Äì96) and Walter Scott (1771‚Äì1832) were highly influenced by the Ossian cycle. Robert Burns (1759‚Äì1796) was a pioneer of the Romantic movement, and after his death he became a cultural icon in Scotland. Among poems and songs of Burns that remain well known across the world are, \\"Auld Lang Syne\\"; \\"A Red, Red Rose\\"; \\"A Man's A Man for A' That\\"; \\"To a Mouse\\"; \\"Tam o' Shanter\\" and \\"Ae Fond Kiss\\". Romanticism: 1798‚Äì1837 William Blake's \\"The Tyger\\", published in his Songs of Innocence and of Experience, is a work of Romanticism Romanticism was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement that originated in Europe toward the end of the 18th century. Various dates are given for the Romantic period in British literature, but here the publishing of Lyrical Ballads in 1798 is taken as the beginning, and the crowning of Queen Victoria in 1837 as its end, even though, for example, William Wordsworth lived until 1850 and William Blake published before 1798. The writers of this period, however, \\"did not think of themselves as 'Romantics'\\", and the term was first used by critics of the Victorian period.The Norton Anthology of English Literature, 7th edition, vol.2, p.5. The Romantic period was one of major social change in England, because of the depopulation of the countryside and the rapid development of overcrowded industrial cities, that took place in the period roughly between 1785 and 1830. The movement of so many people in England was the result of two forces: the Agricultural Revolution, that involved the enclosure of the land, drove workers off the land, and the Industrial Revolution which provided them employment, \\"in the factories and mills, operated by machines driven by steam- power\\".The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature, p.21.

Foundations. Volume III, Number 1. Retrieved 25 June 2009. The French Revolution was an especially important influence on the political thinking of many of the Romantic poets.The Norton Anthology of English Literature, vol.2 (2000), p.2. The landscape is often prominent in the poetry of this period, so that the Romantics, especially perhaps Wordsworth, are often described as 'nature poets'. However, the longer Romantic 'nature poems' have a wider concern because they are usually meditations on \\"an emotional problem or personal crisis\\".The Norton Anthology of English Literature, vol.2 (2000), p.9 =Romantic poetry= William Blake is considered a seminal figure in the history of both the poetry and visual arts of the Romantic Age The poet, painter, and printmaker William Blake (1757‚Äì1827) was one of the first of the English Romantic poets. Largely disconnected from the major streams of the literature of the time, Blake was generally unrecognised during his lifetime, but is now considered a seminal figure in the history of both the poetry and visual arts of the Romantic Age. Among his most important works are Songs of Innocence (1789) and Songs of Experience (1794) \\"and profound and difficult 'prophecies' \\" such as Visions of the Daughters of Albion (1793), The First Book of Urizen (1794), and \\"Jerusalem: the Emanation of the Giant Albion\\" (1804‚Äì?20).\\"William Blake.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 2 Oct 2012. . After Blake, among the earliest Romantics were the Lake Poets, a small group of friends, including William Wordsworth (1770‚Äì1850), Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772‚Äì1834), Robert Southey (1774‚Äì1843) and journalist Thomas De Quincey (1785‚Äì1859). However, at the time, Walter Scott (1771‚Äì1832) was the most famous poet. Scott achieved immediate success with his long narrative poem The Lay of the Last Minstrel in 1805, followed by the full epic poem Marmion in 1808. Both were set in the distant Scottish past.The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature, p.885. The early Romantic Poets brought a new emotionalism and introspection, and their emergence is marked by the first romantic manifesto in English literature, the \\"Preface\\" to Lyrical Ballads (1798). The poems in Lyrical Ballads were mostly by Wordsworth, although Coleridge contributed the long \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\".The Oxford Companion to English Literature, p.215. Among Wordsworth's most important poems, are \\"Michael\\", \\"Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey\\", \\"Resolution and Independence\\", \\"Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood\\" and the long, autobiographical, epic The Prelude. Robert Southey (1774‚Äì1843) was another of the so-called \\"Lake Poets\\", and Poet Laureate for 30 years from 1813 to his death in 1843. Although his fame has been long eclipsed by that of his contemporaries and friends William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Thomas De Quincey (1785‚Äì1859) was an English essayist, best known for his Confessions of an English Opium-Eater (1821),Horace Ainsworth Eaton, Thomas De Quincey: A Biography, New York, Oxford University Press, 1936; reprinted New York, Octagon Books, 1972; Grevel Lindop, The Opium-Eater: A Life of Thomas De Quincey, London, J. M. Dent & Sons, 1981. an autobiographical account of his laudanum and its effect on his life. Second generation Mary Shelley The second generation of Romantic poets includes Lord Byron (1788‚Äì1824), Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792‚Äì1822) and John Keats (1795‚Äì1821). Byron, however, was still influenced by 18th-century satirists and was, perhaps, the least \\"romantic\\" of the three, preferring \\"the brilliant wit of Pope to what he called the 'wrong poetical system' of his Romantic contemporaries\\".The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature, p.379. Though John Keats shared Byron and Shelley's radical politics, \\"his best poetry is not political\\".The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature, p.248, but is especially noted for its sensuous music and imagery, along with a concern with material beauty and the transience of life.\\"John Keats.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2013. Web. 12 May. 2013.; The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature, p.649‚Äì50. Among his most famous works are: \\"The Eve of St Agnes\\", \\"La Belle Dame sans Merci\\", \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\", \\"To Autumn\\".The Norton Anthology of English Literature, p824. Percy Shelley, known to contemporaries for his radical politics and association with figures such as Byron and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, daughter of radical thinkers William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft, was the third major romantic poet of the second generation. Generally regarded as among the finest lyric poets in the English language, Shelley is perhaps best known for poems such as Ozymandias, Ode to the West Wind, To a Skylark and Adona√Øs, an elegy written on the death of Keats.The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature (1990), p.904. Mary Shelley (1797‚Äì1851) is remembered as the author of Frankenstein (1818), an important Gothic novel, as well as being an early example of science fiction.The Oxford Companion to English Literature (1996), p. 886. Other poets Another important poet in this period was John Clare (1793‚Äì1864). Clare was the son of a farm labourer, who came to be known for his celebratory representations of the English countryside and his lamentation for the changes taking place in rural England.Geoffrey Summerfield, in introduction to John Clare: Selected Poems, Penguin Books 1990, pp 13‚Äì22. George Crabbe (1754‚Äì1832) was an English poet who, during the Romantic period, wrote \\"closely observed, realistic portraits of rural life [...] in the heroic couplets of the Augustan age\\".The Oxford Companion to English Literature (1996), p.239. Crabbe's works include The Village (1783), Poems (1807), The Borough (1810). =Romanticism and the novel= Major novelists in this period were Jane Austen (1775‚Äì1817) and the Scotsman Sir Walter Scott (1771‚Äì1832), while Gothic fiction of various kinds also flourished. Austen's works satirise the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism.Litz, pp. 3‚Äì14; Grundy, \\"Jane Austen and Literary Traditions\\", The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen, pp. 192‚Äì193; Waldron, \\"Critical Responses, Early\\", Jane Austen in Context, p. 83, 89‚Äì90; Duffy, \\"Criticism, 1814‚Äì1870\\", The Jane Austen Companion, pp. 93‚Äì94. Austen's works include Pride and Prejudice (1813) Sense and Sensibility (1811), Mansfield Park (1814), Emma (1815) and Persuasion (1818). Sir Walter Scott, 1822 The most important British novelist at the beginning of the early 19th century was Sir Walter Scott, who was not only a highly successful British novelist, but \\"the greatest single influence on fiction in the 19th century [...] [and] a European figure\\".J. A. Cuddon, A Dictionary of Literary Terms (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1984), p. 435. Scott's novel writing career was launched in 1814 with Waverley, often called the first historical novel, and was followed by Ivanhoe. The Waverley Novels, including The Antiquary, Old Mortality, The Heart of Midlothian, and whose subject is Scottish history, are now generally regarded as Scott's masterpieces.The Oxford Companion to English Literature, p.890. Jane Austen Victorian literature: 1832‚Äì1900 =Victorian fiction= The novel It was in the Victorian era (1832‚Äì1900) that the novel became the leading literary genre in English.The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature (1990), p.93. Women played an important part in this rising popularity both as authors and as readers.Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature, p.95. Monthly serialising of fiction encouraged this surge in popularity, due to a combination of the rise of literacy, technological advances in printing, and improved economics of distribution.Graham Law, Serializing Fiction in the Victorian Press (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 34. Circulating libraries, that allowed books to be borrowed for an annual subscription, were a further factor in the rising popularity of the novel. Charles Dickens Charles Dickens (1812‚Äì70) emerged on the literary scene in the late 1830s and soon became probably the most famous novelist in the history of British literature. Dickens fiercely satirised various aspects of society, including the workhouse in Oliver Twist, the failures of the legal system in Bleak House. In more recent years Dickens has been most admired for his later novels, such as Dombey and Son (1846‚Äì48), Bleak House (1852‚Äì53) and Little Dorrit (1855‚Äì57), Great Expectations (1860‚Äì1), and Our Mutual Friend (1864‚Äì65).The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature (1990), p.106-7. An early rival to Dickens was William Makepeace Thackeray (1811‚Äì63), who during the Victorian period ranked second only to him, but he is now much less read and is known almost exclusively for Vanity Fair (1847). The Bront√´ sisters, Emily, Charlotte and Anne, were other significant novelists in the 1840s and 1850s. Their novels caused a sensation when they were first published but were subsequently accepted as classics. Charlotte Bront√´'s (1816‚Äì55) work was Jane Eyre, broke new ground in being written from an intensely first-person female perspective.Lucasta Miller, The Bronte Myth. (NY: Anchor, 2005), pp12-13 Emily Bront√´'s (1818‚Äì48) novel was Wuthering Heights and, according to Juliet Gardiner, \\"the vivid sexual passion and power of its language and imagery impressed, bewildered and appalled reviewers\\".Juliet Gardiner, The History today who's who in British history (2000), p. 109 The third Bront√´ novel of 1847 was Anne Bront√´'s (1820‚Äì49) Agnes Grey, which deals with the lonely life of a governess. Elizabeth Gaskell (1810‚Äì65) was also a successful writer and North and South contrasts the lifestyle in the industrial north of England with the wealthier south.Abrams, M.H., et al. (Eds.) \\"Elizabeth Gaskell, 1810‚Äì1865\\". The Norton Anthology of English Literature, The Major Authors: The Romantic Period through the Twentieth Century, 7th ed., Vol. B. New York, London: W.W. Norton & Company, 2001. Anthony Trollope (1815‚Äì82) was one of the most successful, prolific and respected English novelists of the Victorian era. Some of his best-loved works are set in the imaginary west country county of Barsetshire, including The Warden (1855) and Barchester Towers (1857). Trollope's novels portray the lives of the landowning and professional classes of early Victorian England.The Oxford Companion to English Literature (1996), p.1013. George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans (1819‚Äì80) was a major novelist of the mid-Victorian period. Her works, especially Middlemarch 1871-2), are important examples of literary realism, and are admired for their combination of high Victorian literary detail, with an intellectual breadth that removes them from the narrow geographic confines they often depict, that has led to comparisons with Tolstoy.The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature (1990), p. 490. George Meredith (1828‚Äì1909) is best remembered for his novels The Ordeal of Richard Feverel (1859) and The Egoist (1879). \\"His reputation stood very high well into\\" the 20th century but then seriously declined.The Oxford Companion to English Literature (1996), pp.650‚Äì1. H. G. Wells studying in London, taken circa 1890 An interest in rural matters and the changing social and economic situation of the countryside is seen in the novels of Thomas Hardy (1840‚Äì1928). A Victorian realist, in the tradition of George Eliot, he was also influenced both in his novels and poetry by Romanticism, especially by William Wordsworth.Dennis Taylor, \\"Hardy and Wordsworth\\". Victorian Poetry, vol. 24, no. 4, Winter, 1986. He gained fame as the author of such novels as, Far from the Madding Crowd (1874), The Mayor of Casterbridge (1886), Tess of the d'Urbervilles (1891), and Jude the Obscure (1895). Another significant late 19th-century novelist is George Gissing (1857‚Äì1903), who published 23 novels between 1880 and 1903. His best-known novel is New Grub Street (1891). Also in the late 1890s, the first novel of Polish-born immigrant Joseph Conrad (1857‚Äì1924), an important forerunner of modernist literature, was published. Conrad's Heart of Darkness was published in 1899. J. M. Barrie, 1890 The short story There are early European examples of short stories published separately between 1790 and 1810, but the first true collections of short stories appeared between 1810 and 1830 in several countries around the same period.Short Story in Jacob E. Safra e.a., The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 15th edition, Micropaedia volume 10, Chicago, 1998. The first short stories in the United Kingdom were gothic tales like Richard Cumberland's \\"remarkable narrative\\" \\"The Poisoner of Montremos\\" (1791).Oxford Book of Gothic Tales. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001 Major novelists like Sir Walter Scott and Charles Dickens also wrote some short stories. Genre fiction Important developments occurred in genre fiction in this era. Adventure novels were popular, including Sir John Barrow's descriptive 1831 account of the Mutiny on the Bounty. The Lost World literary genre was inspired by real stories of archaeological discoveries by imperial adventurers. Sir Henry Rider Haggard wrote one of the earliest examples, King Solomon's Mines, in 1885. Contemporary European politics and diplomatic manoeuvrings informed Anthony Hope's swashbuckling Ruritanian adventure novels The Prisoner of Zenda (1894). Robert Louis Stevenson (1850‚Äì94) also wrote works in this genre, including Kidnapped (1886), an historical novel set in the aftermath of the Jacobite rising of 1745, and Treasure Island (1883), the classic pirate adventure. Wilkie Collins' epistolary novel The Moonstone (1868) is generally considered the first detective novel in the English language, and soon after Sir Arthur Conan Doyle began his Sherlock Holmes series about a London-based \\"consulting detective\\". Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six short stories featuring Holmes, from 1880 up to 1907, with a final case in 1914. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was born in Scotland. H. G. Wells's (1866‚Äì1946) writing career began in the 1890s with science fiction novels like The War of the Worlds (1898) which describes an invasion of late Victorian England by Martians, and Wells is, along with Frenchman Jules Verne (1828‚Äì1905), as a major figure in the development of the science fiction genre. The history of the modern fantasy genre is generally said to begin with George MacDonald, the influential author of The Princess and the Goblin and Phantastes (1858). William Morris was a popular English poet who also wrote several fantasy novels during the latter part of the nineteenth century. The vampire genre fiction began with John William Polidori's \\"The Vampyre\\" (1819). This short story was inspired by the life of Lord Byron and his poem The Giaour. Irish writer Bram Stoker was the author of seminal horror work Dracula (1897) with the primary antagonist the vampire Count Dracula. Penny dreadful publications were an alternative to mainstream works, and were aimed at working class adolescents, introducing the infamous Sweeney Todd. The premier ghost story writer of the 19th century was the Irish writer Sheridan Le Fanu. Children's literature Lewis Carroll Literature for children developed as a separate genre during the Victorian era, and some works became internationally known, such as Lewis Carroll, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865). At the end of nineteenth-century, the author and illustrator Beatrix Potter was known for her children's books, which featured animal characters, including The Tale of Peter Rabbit (1902). In the latter years of the 19th century, precursors of the modern picture book were illustrated books of poems and short stories produced by illustrators Randolph Caldecott, Walter Crane, and Kate Greenaway. These had a larger proportion of pictures to words than earlier books, and many of their pictures were in colour. Vice Versa (1882) by F. Anstey, sees a father and son exchange bodies ‚Äî body swaps have been a popular theme in various media since the book was published. =Victorian poetry= Alfred, Lord Tennyson The leading poets during the Victorian period were Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809‚Äì1892), Robert Browning (1812‚Äì89), Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806‚Äì61), and Matthew Arnold (1822‚Äì88). The poetry of this period was heavily influenced by the Romantics, but also went off in its own directions. Particularly notable was the development of the dramatic monologue, a form used by many poets in this period, but perfected by Browning.Carol T. Christ, Victorian and Modern Poetics. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,1986); \\"Robert Browning\\", The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature. (New York: Prentice Hall, 1990), p.373. Tennyson was Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom during much of Queen Victoria's reign. He was described by T. S. Eliot, as \\"the greatest master of metrics as well as melancholia\\", and as having \\"the finest ear of any English poet since Milton\\".The Oxford Companion to English Literature, p.981. While Elizabeth Barrett Browning was the wife of Robert Browning she had established her reputation as a major poet before she met him. Her most famous work is the sequence of 44 sonnets \\"Sonnets from the Portuguese\\" published in Poems (1850).The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature, p.372. Matthew Arnold's reputation as a poet has declined in recent years and he is best remembered now for his critical works, like Culture and Anarchy (1869), and his 1867 poem \\"Dover Beach\\". Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828‚Äì1882) was a poet, illustrator, painter and translator. He founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848 with William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais, and was later to be the main inspiration for a second generation of artists and writers influenced by the movement, most notably William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones.The Cambridge history of English and American literature: An encyclopedia in eighteen volumes, ed. by A.W. Ward, A.R. Waller, W.P. Trent, J. Erskine, S.P. Sherman, and C. Van Doren. (New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons University Press, 1907‚Äì21). While Arthur Clough (1819‚Äì61) was a more minor figure of this era, he has been described as \\"a fine poet whose experiments in extending the range of literary language and subject were ahead of his time\\".\\"Arthur Hugh Clough ‚Äî A Brief Biography\\", Glenn Everett George Meredith (1828‚Äì1909) is remembered for his innovative collection of poems Modern Love (1862). In the second half of the century, English poets began to take an interest in French Symbolism. Two groups of poets emerged in the 1890s, the Yellow Book poets who adhered to the tenets of Aestheticism, including Algernon Charles Swinburne, Oscar Wilde and Arthur Symons and the Rhymers' Club group, that included Ernest Dowson, Lionel Johnson and Irishman William Butler Yeats. Irishman Yeats went on to become an important modernist in the 20th century. Also in the 1890s A. E. Housman (1859‚Äì1936) published at his own expense A Shropshire Lad. The poems' wistful evocation of doomed youth in the English countryside, in spare language and distinctive imagery, appealed strongly to late Victorian and Edwardian taste.A.. E Housman, A Shropshire Lad, XL The nonsense verse of Edward Lear, along with the novels and poems of Lewis Carroll, is regarded as a precursor of surrealism.. In 1846 Lear published A Book of Nonsense, a volume of limericks that went through three editions and helped popularise the form. Writers of comic verse included the dramatist, librettist, poet and illustrator W. S. Gilbert (1836‚Äì1911), who is best known for his fourteen comic operas produced in collaboration with the composer Sir Arthur Sullivan, of which the most famous include H.M.S. Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance and one of the most frequently performed works in the history of musical theatre, The Mikado.Kenrick, John. G&S; Story: Part III , accessed 13 October 2006; and Powell, Jim. William S. Gilbert's Wicked Wit for Liberty accessed 13 October 2006. =Victorian drama= Oscar Wilde, 1882 For much of the first half of the 19th century, drama in London and provincial theatres was restricted by a licensing system to the Patent theatre companies, and all other theatres could perform only musical entertainments (although magistrates had powers to license occasional dramatic performances). The passing of the Theatres Act 1843 removed the monopoly on drama held by the Patent theatres. Irish playwright Dion Boucicault (1820‚Äì90) was an extremely popular writer of comedies who achieved success on the London stage with works like London Assurance, (1841), in the middle of the 19th century. However, drama did not achieve importance as a genre in the 19th century until the end of the century, and then the main figures were also Irish-born. In the last decade of the century major playwrights emerged, including George Bernard Shaw (1856‚Äì1950), Arms and the Man (1894), and Oscar Wilde (1854‚Äì1900), The Importance of Being Earnest (1895). Both of these Irish writers lived mainly in England and wrote in English, with the exception of some works in French by Wilde. Twentieth-century The year 1922 marked a significant change in the relationship between Great Britain and Ireland, with the setting up of the (predominantly Catholic) Irish Free State in most of Ireland, while the predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom. This separation also leads to questions as to what extent Irish writing prior to 1922 should be treated as a colonial literature. There are also those who question whether the literature of Northern Ireland is Irish or British. Nationalist movements in Britain, especially in Wales and Scotland, also significantly influenced writers in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. =Modernism and cultural revivals: 1901‚Äì1945= From around 1910 the Modernist movement began to influence British literature. While their Victorian predecessors had usually been happy to cater to mainstream middle- class taste, 20th-century writers often felt alienated from it, so responded by writing more intellectually challenging works or by pushing the boundaries of acceptable content. First World War A statue of Hedd Wyn in Trawsfynydd The experiences of the First World War were reflected in the work of war poets such as Wilfred Owen, Rupert Brooke, Isaac Rosenberg, Robert Graves, and Siegfried Sassoon. In Parenthesis, an epic poem by David Jones first published in 1937, is a notable work of the literature of the First World War, that was influenced by Welsh traditions, despite Jones being born in England. In non-fiction prose. T. E. Lawrence's (Lawrence of Arabia) autobiographical account in Seven Pillars of Wisdom of the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire is important. Poetry: 1901‚Äì1945 Thomas Hardy Two Victorian poets who published little in the 19th century, Thomas Hardy (1840‚Äì1928) and Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844‚Äì89), have since come to be regarded as major poets. While Hardy first established his reputation the late 19th century with novels, he also wrote poetry throughout his career. However he did not publish his first collection until 1898, so that he tends to be treated as a 20th-century poet.The Oxford Companion to English Literature, ed. Margaret Drabble, p. 439. Gerard Manley Hopkins's Poems were posthumously published in 1918 by Robert Bridges. Free verse and other stylistic innovations came to the forefront in this era, with which T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound were especially associated. T. S. Eliot (1888‚Äì1965) was born American, migrated to England in 1914, and he was \\"arguably the most important English- language poet of the 20th century.\\" He produced some of the best-known poems in the English language, including \\"The Waste Land\\" (1922) and Four Quartets (1935‚Äì1942).Thomas Stearns Eliot, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, accessed 7 November 2009. The Georgian poets like Rupert Brooke, Walter de la Mare (1873‚Äì1956) and John Masefield (1878‚Äì1967, Poet Laureate from 1930) maintained a more conservative approach to poetry by combining romanticism, sentimentality and hedonism. Edward Thomas (1878‚Äì1917) is sometimes treated as another Georgian poet.The Oxford Companion to English Literature, ed. Margaret Drabble, pp. 988. 377. In the 1930s the Auden Group, sometimes called simply the Thirties poets, was an important group of politically left-wing writers, that included W. H. Auden (1907‚Äì73) and two Anglo-Irish writers, Cecil Day-Lewis (1904‚Äì72) and Louis MacNeice (1907-1963). Auden was a major poet who had a similar influence on subsequent poets as W. B. Yeats and T. S. Eliot had had on earlier generations.\\"Auden, W. H.\\", Oxford Reference. Oxford University Press. n.d. 8 November 2012. http://www.oxfordreference.com/10.1093/acref/9780192806871.001.0001/acref-9780192806871-e-421 Keith Douglas (1920‚Äì1944) was noted for his war poetry during World War II and his wry memoir of the Western Desert Campaign, Alamein to Zem Zem. He was killed in action during the invasion of Normandy. Alun Lewis (1915‚Äì1944), born in South Wales, was one of the best-known English-language poets of the war The Second World War has remained a theme in British literature. Modernist novel Rudyard Kipling, 1912 While modernism was to become an important literary movement in the early decades of the new century, there were also many fine writers who, like Thomas Hardy, were not modernists. Novelists include: Rudyard Kipling (1865‚Äì1936), who was also a successful poet; H. G. Wells (1866‚Äì1946); John Galsworthy (1867‚Äì1933), (Nobel Prize in Literature, 1932), whose novels include The Forsyte Saga (1906‚Äì21); Arnold Bennett (1867‚Äì1931) author of The Old Wives' Tale (1908); G. K. Chesterton (1874‚Äì1936); E.M. Forster (1879‚Äì1970). The most popular British writer of the early years of the 20th century was arguably Rudyard Kipling, a highly versatile writer of novels, short stories and poems, and to date the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature (1907).\\"Rudyard Kipling.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 15 Nov 2012. . H. G. Wells was a highly prolific author who is now best known for his work in the science fiction genre.Adam Charles Roberts (2000), \\"The History of Science Fiction\\": Page 48 in Science Fiction, Routledge, . His most notable science fiction works include The War of the Worlds, and The Time Machine, written in the 1890s. Forster's A Passage to India 1924, reflected challenges to imperialism, while his earlier works such as A Room with a View (1908) and Howards End (1910), examined the restrictions and hypocrisy of Edwardian society in England. Virginia Woolf in 1927 Writing in the 1920s and 1930s Virginia Woolf was an influential feminist, and a major stylistic innovator associated with the stream-of-consciousness technique.

The latest DBI module for Perl from CPAN can run on a range of operating systems.  History  In September 1992, Buzz Moschetti, creator of interperl, observed that several bespoke compiled extensions of perl (at the time, perl version 4 or more commonly perl4) featuring connectivity to popular SQL-based databases had emerged, namely Interbase, Informix, Oracle, and Sybase. He engaged the authors of these bespoke versions with the idea of creating a common interface layer to the databases separate from the specifics of the underlying implementations. Tim Bunce took the lead and began specifying what would become the DBI module in 1994 upon the release of perl5 which eliminated the need for bespoke compilation in favor of dynamic, invocation time loading of libraries (modules). the Perl community maintains DBI as a CPAN module in accordance with the open-source model. DBD (DataBase Driver) modules serve as plug-ins to DBI, allowing programmers to use near-database-independent SQL code in their applications. Programmers can also use the DBI and DBD modules indirectly using one of the object-relational mappers available for Perl, such as DBIx::Class, for more database-independent code with no need to write SQL.  Features  The DBI and DBD Perl packages allow Perl programmers to access many database environments in a standard way. The system implements each supported database environment as a DBD driver, in much the same way that hardware devices from multiple vendors can operate with different CPU platforms. Prospective DBD users can download DBD implementations from the Internet. DBD implementations exist for proprietary products such as IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle and for free-software databases such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, Firebird and MySQL.

He rose to national prominence when he ordered President Richard Nixon to turn over his recordings of White House conversations. Sirica's involvement in the case began when he presided over the trial of the Watergate burglars. He did not believe the claim that they had acted alone, and through the use of strongly encouraged them to give information about higher-ups before final sentencing. One defendant, James W. McCord Jr., wrote a letter describing a broader scheme of involvement by people in the Nixon administration. For his role in uncovering the truth about Watergate, Sirica was named Time magazine's Man of the Year in January 1974. Early life and education Sirica was born in Waterbury, Connecticut, to Ferdinando (Fred) Sirica, an immigrant from Italy, and Rose (Zinno) Sirica, whose parents were from Italy. He moved to Washington, D.C., in 1918, where he attended Emerson Preparatory School and eventually transferred to Columbia Preparatory School. He went directly from high school to law school, which was possible in the District of Columbia at the time, and, after two false starts, entered Georgetown Law and received a Bachelor of Laws in 1926. Between 1910 and 1918, the Sirica family lived in various cities across the United States where Fred worked as a barber and made several unsuccessful attempts at running small businesses. In 1922, Fred was running a two-lane bowling alley and poolhall, which was raided by the police for violation of the Prohibition-era Volstead Act when liquor was found in the restroom. Fred was arrested, but the charges were dropped. He soon sold the business and moved away. Career Sirica fought as a boxer in Washington and Miami in the 1920s and 1930s. He was torn between a career as a fighter and the career in law that he followed after earning a law degree and passing the bar. Boxing champion Jack Dempsey became a close friend. Sirica was in private practice of law in Washington, D.C. from 1926 to 1930. He was an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Columbia from 1930 to 1934, and subsequently returned to private practice from 1934 to 1957. He also served as general counsel to the House Select Committee to Investigate the Federal Communications Commission in 1944; his appointment was opposed by the two Republican members of the committee. However, Sirica resigned in protest over the committee's handling of the WMCA scandal that year, and re-entered private practice. In 1947, he joined the law firm of Hogan and Hartson in Washington, D.C. (now called Hogan Lovells). Federal judicial service Sirica was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on February 25, 1957, to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Columbia vacated by Judge Henry Albert Schweinhaut. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 26, 1957, and received his commission on March 28, 1957. He served as Chief Judge and a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States from 1971 to 1974. He assumed senior status on October 31, 1977. His service terminated on August 14, 1992, due to his death. Notably, he ruled the law banning Navy women from ships to be unconstitutional in the case Owens v.

Author Joseph Goulden, in The Benchwarmers, said that some lawyers thought Sirica made careless legal errors. He was nicknamed \\"Maximum John\\" for giving defendants the maximum sentence that guidelines allowed. Book In 1979, Sirica published a book, co-authored with John Stacks, detailing his participation in the Watergate cases under the title To Set the Record Straight. Death Sirica suffered a severe heart attack while at a speaking engagement on February 5, 1976. In the final years of his life, Sirica suffered from a wide range of ailments, both minor and severe.

That year it merged with the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (UPCUSA) to form the Presbyterian Church (USA). History =Organization (1861)= The Presbyterian Church in the United States grew out of regional and theological divisions within the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA), the first national Presbyterian denomination in the U.S. founded in 1789. In 1838, the PCUSA divided along theological lines due to the Old School‚ÄìNew School Controversy. The New School faction advocated revivalism and a softening of traditional Calvinism, while the Old School was opposed to the extremes of revivalism and desired strict conformity to the Westminster Confession, the Presbyterian Church's doctrinal standard. Many New School Presbyterians were also supportive of moral reform movements, such as abolitionism. As a result, after 1838 most Southern Presbyterians aligned with the Old School Presbyterian Church. The reluctance of the Old School General Assembly to rule on moral and political questions not explicitly addressed in the Bible resulted in the Northern and Southern sections of the Old School Presbyterian Church staying united longer than their New School counterparts. The latter split over slavery in 1858. New School synods and presbyteries in the South established the pro-slavery United Synod of the South. Old School Presbyterians remained united until after the start of hostilities in the American Civil War. In May 1861, the Old School General Assembly passed the controversial Gardiner Spring Resolutions that called on Presbyterians to support the Federal Government of the United States as a religious duty. Southerners, with support from a minority of Northerners, protested that this action violated the spirituality of the church and required Southerners to commit treason against their home states in order to remain members of the church. After the May meeting of the General Assembly, some presbyteries in the South immediately renounced the jurisdiction of the General Assembly. On August 15, a convention in Atlanta, Georgia, representing 17 presbyteries, encouraged all presbyteries who had not done so to renounce the General Assembly's jurisdiction. It also recommended that the constitution of the church remain unchanged, with the exception of replacing the phrase \\"Presbyterian Church in the United States of America\\" with the name \\"Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America\\". A general assembly was scheduled to meet in Augusta, Georgia, on December 4, and by that time 47 presbyteries and 10 synods had severed ties to PCUSA. The first General Assembly of the Southern Presbyterian Church accepted the recommendations of the convention and elected Benjamin M. Palmer its first moderator. =Postwar years (1865‚Äì1900)= After the Confederacy's defeat, the church renamed itself as the \\"Presbyterian Church in the United States\\". The denomination grew during its early years in part due to the absorption of a number of smaller Presbyterian groups. In 1864, the church re-united with Southern New School Presbyterians when it merged with the United Synod of the South. Between 1867 and 1874, the church welcomed the Patapsco Presbytery of Maryland, the Kentucky Synod, and the Missouri Synod after those jurisdictions withdrew from the Old School PCUSA in protest over political actions taken by that denomination. Between 1867 and 1870, the church absorbed the Alabama and Kentucky Presbyteries of the Associate Reformed Church, a denomination with roots in the Covenanter and Seceder traditions of Scottish Presbyterianism. These and other mergers added over 35,000 members and 490 local churches. In the 1880s, the PCUS endured a prolonged battle over Darwinian evolution. James Woodrow, professor at Columbia Theological Seminary, sparked controversy when he suggested that evolutionary thought did not contradict the biblical teachings on creation. In response, the Synod of South Carolina, in which the seminary was located, prohibited the teaching of evolution in 1884. Similar actions were taken by the synods of Georgia, South Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. Columbia's board of directors was reorganized, and it voted to fire Woodrow. He refused to vacate his position and appealed to Augusta Presbytery, which exonerated him of any heresy in August 1886. This decision was appealed to the General Assembly, which after five days of debate ordered Woodrow's removal from his professorship. Despite his removal, Woodrow continued to be considered a member in good standing of the PCUS and was elected moderator of the South Carolina Synod in 1901. Nevertheless, the overwhelming sentiment of the PCUS was that evolutionary theory was a threat to Christian orthodoxy. As a result, Southern Presbyterians would disengage from scientific developments for more than a generation. =Later history= After the war, the PCUS retained its \\"Old School\\" Presbyterian emphasis until the 20th century. The PCUS leaders began to emphasize that they needed to change in light of the changing South, which was undergoing urbanization and industrialization.Hart & Meuther, pgs. 229 & 230 A point of contention were talks of merger between the mainline \\"Northern Presbyterians,\\" the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. and its successor denomination, the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. A vote for merger had come up in 1954, and despite popular support among many, the vote to merge failed. The two denominations did collaborate on a joint hymnal.Hart & Meuther, pg. 232 The PCUS also joined the Episcopalians, United Methodists, the United Church of Christ and the UPCUSA in the Consultation on Church Union in 1962, a group begun by UPCUSA stated clerk Eugene Carson Blake. Eventually, by 1968, union churches and presbyteries were formed (that is, members of both the UPCUSA and the PCUS),Hart & Meuther, pg. 233 and in 1970, a \\"Plan of Union\\" was drawn up.Hart & Meuther, pg. 242 Union did not take place for another thirteen years. Another important event occurred in 1965, when Rachel Henderlite became the first woman ordained in the Presbyterian Church in the United States; she was ordained by the Hanover Presbytery in Virginia. The response to the civil rights movement in effect split the PCUS into three factions: a liberal group desiring full endorsement of the movement's platform, a moderate faction desiring church-wide consensus before taking positive action, and a conservative/traditionalist group vigorously opposing what it believed was the meddling of the church in the civil and cultural traditions of its native region. Conservatives argued that church activity on behalf of racial desegregation and voting rights constituted a violation of the doctrine of \\"the spirituality of the church,\\" a principle developed by 19th-century Presbyterian theologian James Henley Thornwell. He had declared that social reform and political participation were duties or pursuits to be taken up by individuals, not church courts. The conservative group strongly defended that teaching, but the liberal critics believed the doctrine was a justification for maintaining racial segregation and preserving the social standing of historic upper-class white elites within Southern society, a fair percentage of whom were PCUS members. Having been eventually defeated numerous times in the General Assembly by a coalition of the liberals and moderates from the 1960s onward, some PCUS conservatives, primarily from non-metropolitan parts of the Deep South, founded what today is the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) in late 1973. They cited its rationale as \\"[a] long-developing theological liberalism which denied the deity of Jesus Christ and the inerrancy and authority of Scripture\\" on the part of PCUS leaders. Some evangelicals, however, remained in the PCUS in order to contend for their beliefs; this group was more willing to perceive common cause with UPCUSA conservatives. By the 2000s, some churches from both lines began to depart from the post-merger denomination over similar concerns and moral disputes, namely in favor of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church. After the conservatives left the PCUS mainly for the PCA, but a minority for the EPC, it became easier for the remainder to work on union with the UPCUSA. Eventually, in 1983, the \\"Plan of Union\\" came up to a vote, with 53 PCUS presbyteries voting in favor union, and 8 opposed. On June 10, 1983, the reunion between the northern and southern Presbyterians was celebrated in Atlanta with the new denomination taking the name of the \\"Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).\\" Beliefs and practices R.L. Dabney (1820-1898), a Confederate veteran, became an influential theologian in the PCUS.The PCUS was one of the more conservative bodies of Presbyterianism throughout most of its history, with a strong emphasis on subscription to the Westminster Confession and interest in Calvinist scholasticism, particularly as expressed in Common Sense Realism and later the Princeton Theology. In fact, as their northern counterparts in Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. began to modify Calvinism, and experiment with confessional revision, in the later part of the 19th and into the early 20th centuries, the PCUS prided itself in being the bastion of \\"Old School\\" Presbyterianism, stoutly resisting calls for change to accommodate liberalizing sensibilities. However, in the immediate years after World War II, many ministers and churches, especially in larger cities, began to embrace, or at least tolerate, modernist and neo-orthodox understandings of doctrine and church life. One important product of this liberalization was ecumenism, expressed in merger talks with the \\"northern\\" Presbyterian Church, known as the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America after 1958 (despite the common reference as \\"northern,\\" the UPCUSA had congregations in all 50 states by the 20th century, with most of its southern churches the result of a 1906 merger with most of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church or the affiliation of African-American churches in the South Atlantic states after the Civil War). In 1946, with cooperation of three other denominations, it formed the United Andean Indian Mission, an agency that sent missionaries to Ecuador. Among some of the other liberalizing trends were the ordination of women in 1964, the ratification of a pro-choice position on abortion by the General Assembly, and the rejection by that assembly of the plenary verbal inspiration of the Bible, considered by conservatives as a touchstone dogma. Beginning in 1942, in response to liberal trends in the PCUS, conservative churchmen such as L. Nelson Bell, longtime medical missionary to China and father-in-law of evangelist Billy Graham, began establishing various periodicals and renewal parachurch organizations for conservative clergy and laymen alike.Hart & Meuther, pgs. 234 & 235 In 1966, conservatives founded Reformed Theological Seminary in Jackson, Mississippi.Hart & Meuther, pg. 235 Eventually, in December 1973, prompted both by liberalism, and a proposed \\"Plan of Union\\" between the UPCUSA and the PCUS which reportedly had not included an escape clause for congregations that had no desire of being part of the planned denomination, delegates from 260 churches met in Birmingham, Alabama to form the National Presbyterian Church, which would later be renamed the Presbyterian Church in America in 1974.Hart & Meuther, pg. 236 Following the departure of more conservative PCUS members into the PCA, the PCUS drafted a \\"Declaration of Faith,\\" which paralleled the social concerns expressed in the UPCUSA's Confession of 1967.Hart & Meuther, pg. 237 While it was approved by the General Assembly of 1976, it failed to receive a requisite supermajority of the presbyteries (largely due to opposition states where loyalist conservatives remained), and the 1977 General Assembly instead approved it for study purposes, without binding authority. That issue became moot upon the 1983 merger, as the Confession of 1967 was retained in the new denomination's Book of Confessions. Notable members *L.

Hooters Air flights were operated by Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based Pace Airlines both as ad hoc private charters, and as scheduled USDOT public charters. As such, flights operated both under Pace Airlines' IATA Code of Y5 for ad hoc charters, and under its own IATA Code of H1 for public charters.  History  The airline was established in 2003 and started operations on March 6, 2003. It was founded by Hooters of America restaurant owner Robert Brooks, who acquired Pace Airlines in December 2002.Flight International Directory: World Airlines, p91, April 3, 2007 All flights were operated by Pace Airlines. Hooters Air was owned by Hooters of America, Inc. Brooks initially envisioned Hooters Air as an unconventional means of generating awareness for the Hooters restaurant brand; the carrier was sometimes referred to as a \\"flying billboard\\" for the restaurant chain. Hooters Air Boeing 737 waiting on the ramp at Orlando International Airport Aside from its unorthodox neighborhood chain-restaurant tie-in, Hooters Air sought to differentiate itself from other carriers with a distinctive style of in-flight service. The carrier was marketed towards golfers in an effort to bring casual and tournament players to Myrtle Beach's 100+ championship golf courses. Two \\"Hooters Girls,\\" dressed in their restaurant uniforms, were on each flight assisting the (traditionally attired) in-flight crews with hospitality duties. The company advertised nonstop flights for most routes, including funny slogans like \\"Fly a mile high with us.\\" Although Hooters Air billed itself as a low-fare carrier, rows of seats were removed from the aircraft to provide a seating pitch to all passengers, comparable to the legroom offered by many carriers' business classes; in keeping with the golf-friendly orientation of the carrier, this was called \\"Club Class\\" seating. Additionally, all seats were upholstered in dark blue or black leather, and all aircraft were painted in Hooters' orange and white company colors featuring the company logo, and mascot (\\"Hootie the Owl\\"), on the vertical stabilizer. Also, at a time when many low-cost carriers were eliminating in-flight frills in an effort to curtail expenses, Hooters Air served complimentary meals to all customers on trips lasting over one hour. On December 8, 2005, Hooters announced that it would end service to Rockford, Illinois on January 5, 2006, as a result of the airport authority's bringing in a competing airline (United Airlines) on its Rockford-Denver route, and providing revenue guarantees for the competitor. All commercial services were suspended on January 9, 2006. Parent company Pace Airlines continued with charter services for another three years, ceasing operations in September 2009. On April 17, 2006, Hooters Air ceased operations, halting scheduled Public Charter service and refunding tickets. The company attributed this cessation of service primarily to a marked increase in fuel costs in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the autumn of 2005. The airline is estimated to have cost Hooters of America $40 million.Horovitz, Bruce. (2013, April 29). Recipe For Success: 2 Cups Not Enough/30 years ago it was, but now Hooters needs to be more.

In Slavic culture, Baba Yaga lived in a hut usually described as standing on chicken legs. Baba Yaga may help or hinder those that encounter her or seek her out. She may play a maternal role and has associations with forest wildlife. According to Vladimir Propp's folktale morphology, Baba Yaga commonly appears as either a donor, villain, or may be altogether ambiguous. Her depictions vary greatly across tales, ranging from a child-eating monster, to helping a protagonist find his missing bride. Andreas Johns identifies Baba Yaga as \\"one of the most memorable and distinctive figures in eastern European folklore\\", and observes that she is \\"enigmatic\\" and often exhibits \\"striking ambiguity\\". Johns summarizes Baba Yaga as \\"a many-faceted figure, capable of inspiring researchers to see her as a Cloud, Moon, Death, Winter, Snake, Bird, Pelican or Earth Goddess, totemic matriarchal ancestress, female initiator, phallic mother, or archetypal image\\". Etymology Variations of the name Baba Yaga are found in the languages of the Eastern Slavic peoples. The first element, baba, is transparently a babble word. In Old Russian, baba may mean \\"midwife\\", \\"sorceress\\", or \\"fortune teller\\". In modern Russian, the word or babushka (meaning \\"grandmother\\") derives from it, as does the word babcia (also \\"grandmother\\") in Polish. In Serbo-Croatian, baba means \\"grandma\\". In contemporary, unofficial Polish and Russian baba is the pejorative synonym of \\"woman\\" (especially old, dirty or foolish woman). Baba may also have a pejorative connotation in modern Russian, both for women as well as for \\"an unmanly, timid, or characterless man\\". Similarly to other kinship terms in Slavic languages, baba may be employed outside of kinship, potentially as a result of taboo. For example, in variety of Slavic languages and dialects, the word baba may be applied to various animals, natural phenomena, and objects, such as types of mushrooms or a cake or pear. This function extends to various geographic features. In the Polesia region of Ukraine, the plural baby may refer to an autumn funeral feast. These associations have led to variety of theories on the figure of Baba Yaga, though the presence of the element baba may have simply been taken as its primary meaning of \\"grandmother\\" or \\"old woman\\". The element may appear as a means of glossing the second element, iaga, with a familiar component. Additionally, baba may have also been applied as a means of distinguishing Baba Yaga from a male counterpart. While a variety of etymologies have been proposed for the second element of the name, Yaga, it remains far more etymologically problematic and no clear consensus among scholars has resulted. For example, in the 19th century, Alexander Afanasyev proposed the derivation of Proto-Slavic *o≈æ and Sanskrit ahi ('serpent, snake'). This etymology has subsequently been explored by other scholars in the 20th century. Related terms to the second element of the name, Yaga, appear in various Slavic languages; Serbo-Croatian jeza (\\"horror\\", \\"shudder\\", \\"chill\\"), Slovene jeza (\\"anger\\"), Old Czech jƒõzƒõ (\\"witch\\", \\"legendary evil female being\\"), modern Czech jezinka (\\"wicked wood nymph\\", \\"dryad\\"), and Polish jƒôdza (\\"witch\\", \\"evil woman\\", \\"fury\\"). The term appears in Old Church Slavonic as jƒôza/jƒôdza (meaning \\"disease\\", \\"illness\\"). In other Indo-European languages the element iaga has been linked to Lithuanian engti (\\"to abuse (continuously)\\", \\"to belittle\\", \\"to exploit\\"), Old English inca (\\"doubt\\", \\"worry\\", \\"pain\\"), and Old Norse ekki (\\"pain\\", \\"worry\\"). Attestations Vasilisa outside of the hut of Baba Yaga as depicted by Ivan Bilibin (1899) =Folktales= Baba Yaga has appeared in hundreds if not thousands of folktales in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus predating the eighteenth century. The first clear reference to Baba Yaga (Iaga baba) occurs in 1755; Mikhail V. Lomonosov's Rossiiskaia grammatika ('Russian grammar'). In Lomonosov's grammar, Baba Yaga is mentioned twice among other figures largely from Slavic tradition. The second of the two mentions occurs within a list of Slavic gods and beings next to their presumed equivalence in Roman mythology (the Slavic god Perun, for example, appears equated with the Roman god Jupiter). Baba Yaga, however, appears in a third section without an equivalence, attesting to perception of her uniqueness even in this first known attestation. In the narratives in which Baba Yaga appears, she displays a variety of typical attributes: a turning, chicken-legged hut; and a mortar, pestle, mop or broom. Baba Yaga frequently bears the epithet \\"bony leg\\" (Baba Iaga kostianaia noga), and when inside of her dwelling, she may be found stretched out over the stove, reaching from one corner of the hut to another. Baba Yaga may sense and mention the \\"Russian scent\\" (russkim dukhom) of those that visit her. Her nose may stick into the ceiling. Particular emphasis may be placed by some narrators on the repulsiveness of her nose, breasts, buttocks, or vagina. In many tales, there are three Baba Yagas which are often depicted as sisters.} For example, in a version of \\"The Maiden Tsar\\" collected in the 19th century by Alexander Afanasyev, Ivan, a handsome merchant's son, makes his way to the home of one of three Baba Yagas: > He journeyed onwards, straight ahead .. and finally came to a little hut; it > stood in the open field, turning on chicken legs. He entered and found Baba > Yaga the Bony-legged. \\"Fie, fie,\\" she said, \\"the Russian smell was never > heard of nor caught sight of here, but it has come by itself. Are you here > of your own free will or by compulsion, my good youth?\\" \\"Largely of my own > free will, and twice as much by compulsion! Do you know, Baba Yaga, where > lies the thrice tenth kingdom?\\" \\"No, I do not,\\" she said, and told him to go > to her second sister; she might know. Ivan Bilbin, Baba Yaga, illustration in 1911 from \\"The tale of the three royal divas and of Ivashka, the priest's son\\" (A. S. Roslavlev)alt= Ivan walks for some time before encountering a small hut identical to the first. This Baba Yaga makes the same comments and asks the same question as the first, and Ivan asks the same question. This second Baba Yaga does not know either and directs him to the third, but says that if she gets angry with him \\"and wants to devour you, take three horns from her and ask her permission to blow them; blow the first one softly, the second one louder, and third still louder\\". Ivan thanks her and continues on his journey. After walking for some time, Ivan eventually finds the chicken-legged hut of the youngest of the three sisters turning in an open field. This third and youngest of the Baba Yagas makes the same comment about \\"the Russian smell\\" before running to whet her teeth and consume Ivan. Ivan begs her to give him three horns and she does so. The first he blows softly, the second louder, and the third louder yet. This causes birds of all sorts to arrive and swarm the hut. One of the birds is the firebird, which tells him to hop on its back or Baba Yaga will eat him. He does so and the Baba Yaga rushes him and grabs the firebird by its tail. The firebird leaves with Ivan, leaving Baba Yaga behind with a fist full of firebird feathers. In Afanasyev's collection of tales, Baba Yaga also appears in \\"The Magic Swan Geese\\", \\"Baba Yaga and Zamoryshek\\", \\"By Command of the Prince Daniel\\", \\"Vasilisa the Fair\\", \\"Marya Moryevna\\", \\"Realms of Copper, Silver, and Gold\\", \\"The Sea Tsar and Vasilisa the Wise\\", and \\"Legless Knight and Blind Knight\\" (English titles from Magnus's translation). In some of these tales, a Baba Yaga will die only to rise again in another form. =Lubki= A lubok depicting Baba Yaga and a bald man with bagpipes Baba Yaga appears on a variety of lubki (singular lubok), wood block prints popular in late 17th and early 18th century Russia. In some instances, Baba Yaga appears astride a pig going to battle against a reptilian entity described as a \\"crocodile\\". Some scholars interpret this scene as a political parody. Peter the Great persecuted Old Believers, who in turn referred to him as a \\"crocodile\\". Some instances of the lubki feature a ship below the crocodile, and Baba Yaga appears in what some scholars identify as Finnish dress, and Catherine I, Peter the Great's wife, was sometimes derisively referred to by way of a word referring to Finnish women (Russian chukhonka).Johns (2004:15). Another lubok features Baba Yaga dancing with a bagpipe-playing bald man. In turn, some scholars have identified this as a merrier depiction of the home life of Peter the Great and Catherine I. Alternately, some scholars have interpreted these lubki motifs as reflecting a concept of Baba Yaga as a shaman, according to which the \\"crocodile\\" would represent a monster who fights witches. The print would therefore be something of a \\"cultural m√©lange\\" that \\"demonstrate[s] an interest in shamanism at the time\\". Contemporary to the production of the lubki, the Finnic peoples still practiced a form of shamanism.Johns (2004:15‚Äì16). According to scholar Andreas Johns, \\"Neither of these two interpretations significantly changes the image of Baba Yaga familiar from folktales. Either she can be seen as a literal evil witch, treated somewhat humorously in these prints, or as a figurative 'witch', an unpopular foreign empress. Both literal and figurative understandings of Baba Yaga are documented in the nineteenth century and were probably present at the time these prints were made.\\" Related figures and analogues Je≈æibaba, a figure closely related to Baba Yaga, occurs in the folklore of the West Slavic peoples. The name Je≈æibaba and its variants are directly related to that of Baba Yaga. The two figures may stem from a common figure as far back as the medieval period, if not further, and both figures are at times similarly ambiguous. The two differ in their occurrence in different tale types and in details regarding their appearances. Questions linger regarding the limited Slavic area‚ÄîEast Slavic nations, Slovakia, and the Czech lands‚Äîin which references to Je≈æibaba are recorded. Another related figure appears in Polish folklore by the name of Jedza. Scholars have identified a variety of beings in folklore who share similarities of varying extent with Baba Yaga. These similarities may be due to either direct relation or cultural contact between the Eastern Slavs and other surrounding peoples. In Eastern Europe, these figures include the Bulgarian gorska maika (–ì–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∞ –º–∞–π–∫–∞', 'Forest Mother', also the name of a flower); the Hungarian vasorr√∫ b√°ba ('Iron-nose Midwife'), the Serbian Baba Korizma, Gvozdenzuba ('Iron-tooth'), Baba Roga (used to scare children in Bosnia, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia), ≈°umska majka ('Forest Mother'), and the babice; and the Slovenian jaga baba or je≈æibaba, Pehta or Pehtra baba and kvatrna baba or kvatrnica. In Romanian folklore, similarities have been identified in several figures, including Mama padurii ('Forest Mother'). In neighboring Germanic Europe, similarities have been observed between the Alpine Perchta and Holda or Holle in the folklore of Central and Northern Germany, and the Swiss Chlungeri. Some scholars have proposed that the concept of Baba Yaga was influenced by East Slavic contact with Finno- Ugric and Siberian peoples. The Karelian Sy√∂j√§t√§r has some aspects of Baba Yaga, but only the negative ones, while in other Karelian tales, helpful roles akin to those from Baba Yaga may be performed by a character called akka (Karelian for \\"old woman\\").

It is an orb weaver, and it is easily recognized by the way it strings together the dead bodies of insects and other debris and hangs it near the center of its web. It hides on this string of debris, and its natural coloration makes it extremely difficult to see until it moves. One of its defenses against predators is to blend in with this debris and to feign death when disturbed. These spiders are small; the females range from 5.3 mm to 7.5 mm, and the males range from 3.6 mm to 4 mm. The webs of these spiders are characterized by a vertical stripe running down the center. This stripe, or stabilimentum, is composed of dead prey and other debris and is used as a hiding place for the spider. The material in the stabilimentum may also serve as a decoy to mislead predators into attacking the debris, giving the spider time to escape.

At the height of his internal power and external prestige, the process of territorial expansion and creation of the modern empire-state was completed by 1898.Zewde, Bahru.

Externally, Menelik led Ethiopian troops against Italian invaders in the First Italo-Ethiopian War; following a decisive victory at the Battle of Adwa, recognition of Ethiopia's independence by external powers was expressed in terms of diplomatic representation at his court and delineation of Ethiopia's boundaries with the adjacent colonies. Menelik expanded his kingdom to the south and east, into Kaffa, Sidama, Wolayta and other kingdoms.International Crisis Group, \\"Ethnic Federalism and its Discontents\\". Issue 153 of ICG Africa report (4 September 2009) p. 2. He is widely called \\"Emiye Menelik\\" in Ethiopia for his forgiving nature and his unselfish deeds for the poor. Later in his reign, Menelik established the first Cabinet of Ministers to help in the administration of the Empire, appointing trusted and widely respected nobles and retainers to the first Ministries. These ministers would remain in place long after his death, serving in their posts through the brief reign of Lij Iyasu and into the reign of Empress Zewditu. They also played a key role in deposing Lij Iyasu. Early life Of Shewan Amhara aristocrat father and a noble mother (Ejigayehu Lemma Adyamo), Sahle Maryam, who later became known as Menelik, was born in Angolalla.T. Etefa, Integration and Peace in East Africa: A History of the Oromo Nation: Richard Greenfield, 1965. p. 97. He was the son of Negus Haile Melekot of Shewa who had fathered him at the age of 18 before inheriting the throne. There are conflicting accounts concerning the maternal ancestry of Menelik but his mother was most probably a palace servant girl named Ejigayehu whom Haile Malekot married after Sahle Maryam was born. The boy enjoyed a respected position in the royal household and he received a traditional church education.Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia (2000), Palgrave, New York, p. 132. Prior to his death in 1855, Negus Haile Melekot named Menelik as successor to the throne of Shewa. However, shortly after Haile Melekot died, Menelik was taken prisoner by Emperor Tewodros II who conquered Shewa, and had him transferred to his mountain stronghold of Magdala. Still, Tewodros treated the young prince well, even offering him his daughter Altash Tewodros in marriage, which Menelik accepted. Upon Menelik's imprisonment, his uncle, Haile Mikael, was appointed as Shum of Shewa by Emperor Tewodros II with the title of Meridazmach. However, Meridazmach Haile Mikael rebelled against Tewodros, resulting in his being replaced by the non- royal Ato Bezabeh as Shum. However, Ato Bezabeh in turn then rebelled against the Emperor and proclaimed himself Negus of Shewa. Although the Shewan royals imprisoned at Magdala had been largely complacent as long as a member of their family ruled over Shewa, this usurpation by a commoner was not acceptable to them. They plotted Menelik's escape from Magdala; with the help of Mohammed Ali and Queen Worqitu of Wollo, he escaped from Magdala on the night of 1 July 1865, abandoning his wife, and returned to Shewa. Enraged, Emperor Tewodros slaughtered 29 Oromo hostages then had 12 Amhara notables beaten to death with bamboo rods. King of Shewa Menelik, king of Shewa Bezabeh's attempt to raise an army against Menelik failed; thousands of Shewans rallied to the flag of the son of Negus Haile Melekot and even Bezabeh's own soldiers deserted him for the returning prince. Abeto Menelik entered Ankober and proclaimed himself Negus. While Negus Menelik reclaimed his ancestral Shewan crown, he also laid claim to the Imperial throne, as a direct descendant male line of Emperor Lebna Dengel. However, he made no overt attempt to assert this claim at this time; Marcus interprets his lack of decisive action not only to Menelik's lack of confidence and experience but that \\"he was emotionally incapable of helping to destroy the man who had treated him as a son.\\" Not wishing to take part in the 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia, he allowed his rival Kassai to benefit with gifts of modern weapons and supplies from the British. When Tewodros committed suicide, Menelik arranged for an official celebration of his death even though he was personally saddened by the loss. When the British asked him why he did this, he replied \\"to satisfy the passions of the people ... as for me, I should have gone into a forest to weep over ... [his] untimely death ... I have now lost the one who educated me, and toward whom I had always cherished filial and sincere affection.\\" Afterwards other challenges ‚Äì a revolt amongst the Wollo to the north, the intrigues of his second wife Befana to replace him with her choice of ruler, military failures against the Arsi Oromo to the southeast ‚Äì kept Menelik from directly confronting Kassai until after his rival had brought an Abuna from Egypt who crowned him Emperor Yohannes IV. Menelik was cunning and strategic in building his power base. He organised extravagant three-day feasts for locals to win their favour, liberally built friendships with Muslims (such as Muhammad Ali of Wollo) and struck alliances with the French and Italians who could provide firearms and political leverage against the Emperor. In 1876, an Italian expedition set out to Ethiopia led by Marchese Orazio Antinori who described King Menelik as \\"very friendly, and a fanatic for weapons, about whose mechanism he appears to be most intelligent\\". Another Italian wrote for Menelik, \\"he had the curiosity of a boy; the least thing made an impression upon him ... He showed ... great intelligence and great mechanical ability\\". Menelik spoke with great economy and rapidity. He never became upset, Chiarini adds, \\"listening calmly, judiciously [and] with good sense ... He is fatalistic and a good soldier, he loves weapons above all else\\". The visitors also confirmed that he was popular with his subjects, and made himself available to them. Menelik had great political and military acumen and made key engagements that would later prove essential as he expanded his Empire. Succession On 10 March 1889, Emperor Yohannes IV was killed in a war with Mahdist Sudan during the Battle of Gallabat (Matemma). With his dying breath, Yohannes declared his natural son, Dejazemach Mengesha Yohannes, to be his heir. On 25 March, upon hearing of the death of Yohannes, Negus Menelik immediately proclaimed himself as Emperor.Mockler, p. 89 Menelik argued that while the family of Yohannes IV claimed descent from King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba through females of the dynasty, his own claim was based on uninterrupted direct male lineage which made the claims of the House of Shewa equal to those of the elder Gondar line of the dynasty. Menelik, and later his daughter Zewditu, would be the last Ethiopian monarchs who could claim uninterrupted direct male descent from King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba (both Lij Iyasu and Emperor Haile Selassie were in the female line, Iyasu through his mother Shewarega Menelik, and Haile Selassie through his paternal grandmother, Tenagnework Sahle Selassie). In the end, Menelik was able to obtain the allegiance of a large majority of the Ethiopian nobility. On 3 November 1889, Menelik was consecrated and crowned as Emperor before a glittering crowd of dignitaries and clergy by Abuna Mattewos, Bishop of Shewa, at the Church of Mary on Mount Entoto.Mockler, p. 90 The newly consecrated and crowned Emperor Menelik II quickly toured the north in force. He received the submission of the local officials in Lasta, Yejju, Gojjam, Welo, and Begemder.

She decided to build a house there and from 1887 this was her permanent base, which she named Addis Ababa (new flower).

On the signing of the treaty, Menelik said \\"The territories north of the Merab Milesh (i.e. Eritrea) do not belong to Abyssinia nor are under my rule. I am the Emperor of Abyssinia. The land referred to as Eritrea is not peopled by Abyssinians ‚Äì they are Adals, Bejaa, and Tigres. Abysinnia will defend his territories but will not fight for foreign lands, which Eritrea is to my knowledge.\\"Man, Know Thyself: Volume 1 Corrective Knowledge of Our Notable Ancestors by Rick Duncan, p. 328 Under the Treaty, Abyssinia and Kingdom of Italy agreed to define the boundary between Eritrea and Ethiopia. For example, both Ethiopia and Italy agreed that Arafali, Halai, Segeneiti and Asmara are villages within the Italian border. Also, the Italians agreed not to harass Ethiopian traders and to allow safe passage for Ethiopian goods, particularly military weapons. The treaty also guaranteed that the Ethiopian government would have ownership of the Monastery of Debre Bizen but not use it for military purposes. However, there were two versions of the treaty, one in Italian and another in Amharic. Unknown to Menelik the Italian version gave Italy more power than the two had agreed to. The Italians believed they had \\"tricked\\" Menelik into giving allegiance to Italy. To their surprise, upon learning about the alteration, Emperor Menelik II rejected the treaty. The Italians attempted to bribe him with two million rounds of ammunition but he refused. Then the Italians approached Ras Mengesha of Tigray in an attempt to create civil war, however, Ras Mengesha, understanding that Ethiopia's independence was at stake, refused to be a puppet for the Italians. The Italians, therefore, prepared to attack Ethiopia with an army led by Baratieri. Subsequently, the Italians declared war and attempted to invade Ethiopia. =Italo-Ethiopian War= Tapestry of the Battle of Adwa. Menelik's disagreement with Article 17 of the treaty led to the Battle of Adwa. Before Italy could launch the invasion, Eritreans rebelled in an attempt to push Italy out of Eritrea and prevent its invasion of Ethiopia. The rebellion was not successful. However, some of the Eritreans managed to make their way to the Ethiopian camp and jointly fought Italy at the battle of Adwa. On 17 September 1895, Menelik ordered all of the Ethiopian nobility to call out their banners and raise their feudal hosts, stating: \\"An enemy has come across the sea. He has broken through our frontiers in order to destroy our fatherland and our faith. I allowed him to seize my possessions and I entered upon lengthy negotiations with him in hopes of obtaining justice without bloodshed. But the enemy refuses to listen. He undermines our territories and our people like a mole. Enough! With the help of God I will defend the inheritance of my forefathers and drive back the invader by force of arms. Let every man who has sufficient strength accompany me. And he who has not, let him pray for us\\". Menelik's opponent, General Oreste Baratieri, underestimated the size of the Ethiopian force, predicating that Menelik could only field 30,000 men. Menelik II observes the battle of Adwa against the Italian invasion army in 1896. Le Petit Journal, 1898. Despite the dismissive Italian claim that Ethiopia was a \\"barbaric\\" African nation whose men were no match for white troops, the Ethiopians were better armed, being equipped with thousands of modern French rifles and Hotchkiss artillery guns together with ammunition and shells which were superior to the Italian rifles and artillery. Menelik had ensured that his infantry and artillerymen were properly trained in their use, giving the Ethiopians a crucial advantage as the Hotchkiss artillery could fire more rapidly than the Italian artillery. In 1887 a British diplomat, Gerald Portal, wrote after seeing the Ethiopian feudal hosts parade before him, the Ethiopians were \\"...redeemed by the possession of unbounded courage, by a disregard of death, and by a national pride, which leads them to look down on every human being who has not had the good fortune to be born an Abyssinian [Ethiopian]\\". The Emperor personally led his army to attack an Italian force led by Major Toselli on 7 December 1895 at Boota Hill. The Ethiopians attacked a force of 350 Eritrean irregulars on the left flank, who collapsed under the Ethiopian assault, causing Toselli to send two companies of Italian infantry who halted the Ethiopian advance. Just as Toselli was rejoicing in his apparent victory, the main Ethiopian assault came down on his right flank, causing Toselli to order retreat. The Emperor's best general, Ras Alula, had occupied the road leading back to Eritrea, and launched a surprise attack, which routed the Italians. The battle of Amba Alagi ended with an Italian force of 2,150 men losing 1,000 men and 20 officers killed. Ras Alula followed up that victory by defeating General Arimondi and forcing the Italians to retreat to the fort at Mekele. Ras Alula laid siege to the fort, and on the morning of 7 January 1896, the defenders of the fort spotted a huge red tent among the besiegers, showing that the emperor had arrived. On 8 January 1896, the emperor's elite Shoan infantry captured the fort's well, and then beat off desperate Italian attempts to retake the well. On 19 January 1896, the fort's commander, Major Galliano, whose men were dying of dehydration, raised the white flag of surrender. Major Galliano and his men were allowed to march out, surrender their arms and to go free. Menelik stated he allowed the Italians to go free as \\"to give proof of my Christian faith,\\" saying his quarrel was with the Italian government of Prime Minister Francesco Crispi that was trying to conquer his nation, not the ordinary Italian soldiers who been conscripted against their will to fight in the war. Menelik's magnanimity to the defenders of Fort Mekele may have been an act of psychological warfare. Menelik knew from talking to French and Russian diplomats that the war and Crispi himself were unpopular in Italy, and one of the main points of Crispi's propaganda were allegations of atrocities against Italian POWs. From Menelik's viewpoint allowing the Italian POWs to go free and unharmed was the best way of rebutting this propaganda and undermining public support for Crispi. Menelik II in 1899 Crispi sent another 115,000 men to the Horn of Africa and ordered the main Italian commander, General Oreste Baratieri, to finish off the \\"barbarians\\". As Baratieri dithered, Menelik was forced to pull back on 17 February 1896 as his huge host was running out of food. After Crispi sent an insulting telegram accusing Baratieri of cowardice, on 28 February 1896 the Italians decided to seek battle with Menelik. On 1 March 1896, the two armies met at Adwa. The Ethiopians came out victorious. Equestrian statue of Emperor Menelik II, the victor of Adwa. The statue was erected by Emperor Haile Selassie and dedicated on the day before his coronation in 1930, in memory of his great predecessor. With victory at the Battle of Adwa and the Italian colonial army destroyed, Eritrea was Emperor Menelik's for the taking but no order to occupy was given. It seems that Emperor Menelik II was wiser than the Europeans had given him credit for. Realising that the Italians would bring all their force to bear on his country if he attacked, he instead sought to restore the peace that had been broken by the Italians and their treaty manipulation seven years before. In signing the treaty, Menelik II again proved his adeptness at politics as he promised each nation something for what they gave and made sure each would benefit his country and not another nation. Subsequently, the Treaty of Addis Ababa was reached between the two nations. Italy was forced to recognise the absolute independence of Ethiopia. (See Article III of the Treaty of Addis Ababa). =Ethnic makeup of Menelik's government and dominence= Habtegyorgis Dinagde, from the Oromo Speaking Chebo tribe, was the Prime minister and war minister who was the most prominent general during Menelik, Lij Iyasu & Zewditu's reign At the Battle of Adwa, Ethiopian fighters from all parts of the country rallied to the cause and took up positions on the battlefield that allowed them to come to each other's aid during combat. Armies who participated in the battle includes Negu Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam's Amhara infantry and cavalary; Ras Mengesha Yohannes' and Ras Alula's Tigrayan army; Ras Makonnen Wolde Mikael's Harar army that included Amhara, Oromo and Gurage soldiers; Fitawrari Tekle's Wallaga Cavalary and infantry; Wag-shum Gwangul's Agaw and Amhara from Wag and Lasta; and Ras Wolle Bitul's Gondar army. The mehal sefari or central fighting unit included mostly Shewan Amhara, Mecha- Tulama Oromo cavalary, Gurage as well as Taytu Bitul's Yejju armies. The Fitawrari's army, normally the leader of the advanced guard, was commanded by Gebeyehu Gorra. The Ethiopian army at Adwa was, therefore, a mosaic of various ethnic groups and tribes that marched north for a common, national cause.Paulos Milkias, Getachew Metaferia The Battle of Adwa: Reflections on Ethiopia's Historic Victory Against European Colonialism ‚Äì Google Books\\": 2005. p. 53.Paulos Milkias, Getachew Metaferia The Battle of Adwa: Reflections on Ethiopia's Historic Victory Against European Colonialism ‚Äì Google Books\\": 2005. p. 77.Molla Tikuye, The Rise and Fall of the Yajju Dynasty 1784‚Äì1980, p. 201. Developments during Menelik's reign =Relations with Russia= Portrait of Menelik II Menelik thought only Russia would be the main ally of his policy of centralisation of territories under Shewan government because of its interest in counteracting British colonial expansion, which had begun with Britain's 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia, theft of Kebra Nagast and death of Tewodros II.. During the visit of a Russian diplomatic and military mission in 1893, Menelik II concluded a strong alliance with that country. As a result, from 1893 to 1913 Russia sponsored the visits of thousands of advisers and volunteers to Ethiopia. Friendships grew from these visits between Menelik II and both Alexander Bulatovich and Nikolay Gumilyov the great poet.. Russian support for Ethiopia led to the advent of a Russian Red Cross mission as medical support for Ethiopian troops. It arrived in Addis Ababa some three months after Menilek's Adwa victory,The Russian Red Cross Mission and established the first hospital in Ethiopia. =Abolition of slave trading= By the mid-1890s, Menelik was actively suppressing slave trade, destroying notorious slave market towns and punishing slavers with amputation.Raymond Jonas The Battle of Adwa: African Victory in the Age of Empire (2011) p. 81 Google Books Both Tewodros II and Yohannes IV had previously outlawed slave trading but since all tribes were not against it and the country was surrounded on all sides by slave raiders and traders, it was not possible to entirely suppress this practice even by the 20th century.Jean Allain The Law and Slavery: Prohibiting Human Exploitation (2015) p. 128 Google Books While Menelik actively enforced his prohibition, it was beyond his capacity to change the mind of his people regarding this age-old practice.Chris Prouty Empress Taytu and Menilek II: Ethiopia, 1883-1910. Ravens Educational & Development Services (1986) p. 16 Google Books =Introducing new technology= After the Treaty of Addis Ababa was signed in 1896, Europeans recognised the sovereignty of Ethiopia. Menelik then finalised signing treaties with Europeans to demarcate the border of modern Ethiopia by 1904 Menelik II was fascinated by modernity, and like Tewodros II before him, he had a keen ambition to introduce Western technological and administrative advances into Ethiopia. Following the rush by the major powers to establish diplomatic relations following the Ethiopian victory at Adwa, more and more westerners began to travel to Ethiopia looking for trade, farming, hunting, and mineral exploration concessions.See: Mikael Muehlbauer,‚ÄúThe Rhinoceros Horn Beakers of Menelik II of Ethiopia: Materiality, Ritual and Kingship,‚Äù West 86th 26 no. 1, 61-79.https://www.academia.edu/38449640/_The_Rhinoceros_Horn_Beakers_of_Menelik_II_of_Ethiopia_Materiality_Ritual_and_Kingship_ Menelik II founded the first modern bank in Ethiopia, the Bank of Abyssinia, introduced the first modern postal system, signed the agreement and initiated work that established the Addis Ababa ‚ÄìDjibouti railway with the French, introduced electricity to Addis Ababa, as well as the telephone, telegraph, the motor car, and modern plumbing. He attempted unsuccessfully to introduce coinage to replace the Maria Theresa thaler. In 1894, Menelik granted a concession for building Ethio-Djibouti Railways In 1894, Menelik granted a concession for the building of a railway to his capital from the French port of Djibouti but, alarmed by a claim made by France in 1902 to control of the line in Ethiopian territory, he ordered a stop for four years on the extension of the railway beyond Dire Dawa. In 1906 when France, the United Kingdom, and Italy came to an agreement on the subject, granting control to a joint venture corporation, Menelik officially reaffirmed his full sovereign rights over the whole of his empire. According to one persistent tale, Menelik heard about the modern method of executing criminals using electric chairs during the 1890s, and ordered 3 for his Kingdom. When the chairs arrived, Menelik learned they would not work, as Ethiopia did not yet have an electric power industry. Rather than waste his investment, Menelik used one of the chairs as his throne, sending another to his second (Lique Mekwas) or Abate Ba- Yalew.Wallechinsky, David, Irving Wallace, and Amy Wallace. \\"The Peoples Almanacs 15 Favourite Oddities of All Time.\\" The Peoples Almanac Presents the Book of Lists. New York: William Morrow & Co., 1977. pp. 463‚Äì67. Recent research, however, has cast significant doubt on this story, and suggested it was invented by a Canadian journalist during the 1930s. Personal life and death In addition to Ethiopian languages of Amharic, Oromo, Afar, and Tigrigna, Menelik reportedly spoke French, English and Italian fluently. He read many books and was educated in finance, getting involved in various investments, including in American railroads and American securities and French and Belgian mining investments.Menelik invested in western stocks =Wives= Taytu Betul, the third wife of Menelik. Menelik married three times but he did not have a single legitimate child by any of his wives. However, he is reputed to have fathered several children by women who were not his wives, and he recognized three of those children as being his progeny. In 1864, Menelik married Woizero Altash Tewodros, whom he divorced in 1865; the marriage produced no children. Altash Tewodros was a daughter of Emperor Tewodros II. She and Menelik were married during the time that Menelik was held captive by Tewodros. The marriage ended when Menelik escaped captivity, abandoning her. She was subsequently remarried to Dejazmatch Bariaw Paulos of Adwa. In 1865, the same year as divorcing his first wife, Menelik married Woizero Befana Wolde Michael, sister of Dejazmatch Tewende Belay Wolde Michael. This marriage was also childless, and they were married for seventeen years before being divorced in 1882. Menelik was very fond of his wife, but she apparently did not have a sincere affection for him. Woizero Befana had several children by previous marriages and was more interested in securing their welfare than in the welfare of her present husband. For many years, she was widely suspected of being secretly in touch with Emperor Yohannes IV in her ambition to replace her husband on the throne of Shewa with one of her sons from a previous marriage. Finally, she was implicated in a plot to overthrow Menelik when he was King of Shewa. With the failure of her plot, Woizero Befana was separated from Menelik, but Menelik apparently was still deeply attached to her. An attempt at reconciliation failed, but when his relatives and courtiers suggested new young wives to the King, he would sadly say \\"You ask me to look at these women with the same eyes that once gazed upon Befana?\\", paying tribute both to his ex-wife's great beauty and his own continuing attachment to her. Finally, Menelik divorced his treasonous wife in 1882, and in 1883, he married Taytu Betul. Menelik's new wife had been married four times previously, and he became her fifth husband. They were married in a full communion church service and the marriage was thus fully canonical and indissoluble, which had not been the case with either of Menelik's previous wives. The marriage, which proved childless, would last until his death. Taytu Betul would become Empress consort upon her husband's succession, and would become the most powerful consort of an Ethiopian monarch since Empress Mentewab. She enjoyed considerable influence on Menelik and his court until the end, something which was aided by her own family background. Empress Taytu Betul was a noblewoman of Imperial blood and a member of one of the leading families of the regions of Semien, Yejju in modern Wollo, and Begemder. Her paternal uncle, Dejazmatch Wube Haile Maryam of Semien, had been the ruler of Tigray and much of northern Ethiopia. She and her uncle Ras Wube were two of the most powerful people among descendants of the great Ras Gugsa Mursa, a ruler of Oromo descent from the house of was Sheik of Wollo. Emperor Yohannes was able to broaden his power base in northern Ethiopia through Taytu's family connections in Begemider, Semien and Yejju; she also served him as his close adviser, and went to the battle of Adwa with 5,000 troops of her own.Chris Prouty Empress Taytu and Menilek II: Ethiopia, 1883-1910.

Ravens Educational & Development Services (1986) p. 219 Google Books Taytu's step daughter, Zewditu, was married to her nephew Ras Gugsa Welle who administered Begemider up to the 1930s. =Natural children= Vanity Fair (1897) Previous to his marriage to Taytu Betul, Menelik fathered several natural children. Among them, he chose to recognise three specific children (two daughters and one son) as being his progeny. These were: #A daughter, Woizero Shoaregga Menelik, born 1867. She would marry twice and become the mother of: #*A son, Abeto Wossen Seged Wodajo, born of the first marriage; never considered for the succession due to dwarfism #*A daughter, Woizero Zenebework Mikael, who was married at age twelve and died in childbirth one year later #*A son, the purported Emperor Iyasu V. He nominally succeeded upon Menelik's death in 1913, but was never crowned; he was deposed in 1916 by powerful nobles. #A daughter, Woizero (later Empress) Zewditu Menelik, born 1876, died 1930. She married four times and had some children, but none of them survived to adulthood. She was proclaimed Empress in her own right in 1916, but was a figurehead, with ruling power in the hands of regent Ras Tafari Makonnen, who succeeded her in 1930 as Emperor Haile Selassie. #A son, Abeto Asfa Wossen Menelik, born 1873. He died unwed and childless when he was about fifteen years of age. Menelik's only recognised son, Abeto Asfa Wossen Menelik, died unwed and childless when he was about fifteen years of age, leaving him with only two daughters. The elder daughter, Woizero Shoaregga, was first married to Dejazmatch Wodajo Gobena, the son of Ras Gobena Dachi. They had a son, Abeto Wossen Seged Wodajo, but this grandson of Menelik II was eliminated from the succession due to dwarfism. In 1892, twenty-five-year-old Woizero Shoaregga was married for a second time to forty-two-year-old Ras Mikael of Wollo. They had two children, namely a daughter, Woizero Zenebework Mikael, who would be married at the age of twelve to the much older Ras Bezabih Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam, and would die in childbirth a year later; and a son, Lij Iyasu, who would nominally succeed as Emperor after Menelik's death in 1913, but would never be crowned, and would be deposed by powerful nobles in favour of Menelik's younger daughter Zewditu in 1916. Menelik's younger daughter, Zewditu Menelik, had a long and chequered life. She was married four times, and eventually became Empress in her own right, the first woman to hold that position in Ethiopia since the Queen of Sheba. She was only ten years old when Menelik got her married to Ras Araya Selassie Yohannes, the fifteen-year-old son of Emperor Yohannes IV, in 1886. In May 1888, Ras Araya Selassie died and Zewditu became a widow at age twelve. She was married two more times for brief periods to Gwangul Zegeye and Wube Atnaf Seged before marrying Gugsa Welle in 1900 CE. Gugsa Welle was the nephew of Empress Taytu Betul, Menelik's third wife. Zewditu had some children, but none of them survived to adulthood. Menelik died in 1913, and his grandson Iyasu claimed the throne on principle of seniority. However, it was suspected that Iyasu was a secret convert to Islam, which was the religion of his paternal ancestors, and having a Muslim on the throne would have grave implications for Ethiopia in future generations. Therefore, Iyasu was never crowned; he was deposed by nobles in 1916, in favour of his aunt, Zewditu. However, Zewditu (aged 40 at that time) had no surviving children (all her children had died young) and the nobles did not want her husband and his family to exercise power and eventually occupy the throne. Therefore, Zewditu's cousin Ras Tafari Makonnen was named both heir to the throne and regent of the empire. Zewditu had ceremonial duties to perform and wielded powers of arbitration and moral influence, but ruling power was vested in the hands of regent Ras Tafari Makonnen, who succeeded her as Emperor Haile Selassie in 1930. Apart from the three recognised natural children, Menelik was rumoured to be the father of some other children also. These include Ras Birru Wolde GabrielBritish Documents on Foreign Affairs: reports and papers from the Foreign Office confidential print. Part II, from the First to the Second World War.

After that, Menelik was no longer able to reign, and the office was taken over by Empress Taytu.( Chris Prouty, 1986, Empress Taytu and Menelik II) as de facto ruler, until Ras Bitwaddad Tesemma was publicly appointed regent.Marcus, Menelik II, p. 241. However, he died within a year, and a council of regency ‚Äì from which the empress was excluded ‚Äì was formed in March 1910. Menelik's mausoleum. In the early morning hours of 12 December 1913, Emperor Menelik II died. He was buried quickly without announcement or ceremony at the Se'el Bet Kidane Meheret Church, on the grounds of the Imperial Palace. In 1916 Menelik II was reburied in the specially built church at Ba'eta Le Mariam Monastery in Addis Ababa. After the death of Menelik II, the council of regency continued to rule Ethiopia. Lij Iyasu was never crowned Emperor of Ethiopia, and eventually, Empress Zewditu I succeeded Menelik II on 27 September 1916.

Chartered in 1829, Georgetown was the first Baptist college west of the Appalachian Mountains.Georgetown College History Georgetown College has produced five Rhodes Scholars over its history, and 38 Fulbright Scholars since just 1989. The college offers 38 undergraduate degrees and a Master of Arts in education. Georgetown College offers degrees in areas of visual and performing arts, math and sciences, humanities, language and culture, business, medicine and healthcare, and others. It is best known for its excellence in pre-medical fields and education. History In 1829, the Kentucky General Assembly chartered the Kentucky Baptist Education Society with the purpose of establishing a Baptist college in the state. 24 trustees under the leadership of Silas Noel selected the town of Georgetown as the site for the new school. Giddings HallGeorgetown College‚Äôs early years were defined by perseverance in the face of hardships. The first president hired by the college in 1829, William D. Staughton, died before assuming his duties. The second president, Rev. Joel Smith Bacon, stayed two years (1830‚Äì1832), fighting court cases to release funding for the college before leaving out of frustration. The third president, Benjamin Farnsworth, endured a power struggle with the Campbellites and resigned in 1837. In 1838, Rev. Rockwood Giddings became the fourth president of the college. During his short tenure, Giddings began construction on Recitation Hall, the school's first permanent building, and made many other advances that put the college on sound footing. Giddings died of exhaustion after a year in office and was replaced by Rev. Howard Malcolm in 1840. Malcolm oversaw the completion of the construction of the building, now known as Giddings Hall. He also expanded the educational offerings beyond the classics and encouraged the founding of literary societies and the Georgetown Female Academy. He resigned in 1849 when his anti-slavery vote at Kentucky's third constitutional convention resulted in much criticism from slavery proponents and a threat on his life. The college experienced steady growth until the Civil War, when a clear divide established between students and faculty. Partisan differences at the start of the war became so hostile, the College was forced to shut down until 1863. By 1867, enrollment had grown to seventy-six students, and, that same year, one of the earliest female seminaries was founded at the college. The college saw steady growth for the next century but experienced a major boom following World War II and the GI Bill, and, by 1958, enrollment had jumped to 1,397 students. Georgetown continued its growth into the 1960s and 1970s, with several new academic buildings and dormitories constructed on campus to accommodate the rise in enrollment. As the student population grew in the late 20th century, the administration sought ways to diversify the campus and protect academic freedom. In 2005, Georgetown College and the Kentucky Baptist Convention redefined their formal relationship. With the approval of the new agreement by the Convention, the college reverted to its original arrangement with Kentucky Baptists. Distinctions In its history, Georgetown College has produced five Rhodes Scholars and, since 1989, has produced 38 Fulbright Scholars.

Skits are centered on the Homecoming theme, and also incorporate singing, dancing, and acting. Groups engage in competitions to win awards. John L. Hill Chapel Chapel Day and Men's Bid Day takes place each January. Chapel Day is a sorority event letting the active members know which pledges have accepted their bid to join the sorority. The pledges dress in their new sorority's colors and run through the doors of the chapel into the waiting arms of their sisters. The fraternities' version of Chapel Day occurs the following week. Referred to as Men's Bid Day, it operates in a similar fashion and is held at Cooke Memorial. Even independent students, faculty, staff, family, and sometimes pets brave the cold to enjoy the excitement of this special campus tradition. Homecoming is an annual tradition, highlighted by Songfest and a football game. Every year, alumni head back to Georgetown's campus. On Saturday morning they have brunch, listen to live music, and visit with fellow alumni, professors and current students. A Homecoming King and Queen, elected by the student body, are crowned during halftime of the football game. Belle of the Blue is Georgetown's small-scale version of Miss America. It is an annual scholarship pageant that any freshman through junior woman can participate in. Each residence hall, including the male dormitories, nominates a woman to compete as their representative in the February event. On pageant night, the women are judged based on scholarship, interview, talent, poise and appearance. A \\"Miss Congeniality\\" title is awarded, as well as an overall scholarship to Georgetown College. Midnight Brunch ‚Äì The Caf, each semester, selects one night during finals week to open at midnight. Students listen to music that blares and games are played, and the professors serve students platefuls of comfort food to help fuel their late-night study sessions. Grubfest happens each September. Students join the annual battle to see which team can complete the most challenges. In a matter of hours, the Quad, a lush, green open area for socializing and studying, is turned into a slimy, muddy arena covered with food products. At the end of Grubfest, the two dirtiest and most creative participants are crowned king and queen of the year's festivities. Opening Convocation is held in the chapel in the early fall and is a campus-wide assembly intended to create a sense of academic community and common purpose as the academic year begins. Hanging of the Green is held each December, and students, faculty, and staff gather together in the chapel on the first Monday night of the month for a worship service including an advent wreath lit by faculty and staff, an upperclassman offering the service's message, and a Christmas tree trimmed on stage with ornaments representing various organizations on campus. At the end, the attendees sing \\"Silent Night\\". Commencement, or the graduation ceremony, takes place every May on Giddings Lawn. Seniors troop through the doors of Giddings Hall and fan out onto the front lawn, where commencement proceeds. Athletics The athletics teams at Georgetown College are known as the Tigers.

Biography He was the son of Sir Matthew Carew, master in chancery, and his wife Alice, daughter of Sir John Rivers, Lord Mayor of the City of London and widow of Ingpen. The poet was probably the third of the eleven children of his parents, and was born in West Wickham in Kent, in the early part of 1595; he was thirteen years old in June 1608, when he matriculated at Merton College, Oxford. He took his degree of B.A. early in 1611 and proceeded to study at the Middle Temple. Two years later his father complained to Sir Dudley Carleton that he was not doing well. He was therefore sent to Italy as a member of Sir Dudley's household and, when the ambassador returned from Venice, he seems to have kept Thomas Carew with him, for he was working as secretary to Carleton, at the Hague, early in 1616. However, he was dismissed in the autumn of that year for levity and slander; he had great difficulty in finding another job. In August 1618 his father died and Carew entered the service of Edward Herbert, Baron Herbert of Cherbury, in whose train he travelled to France in March 1619, and it is believed that he remained with Herbert until his return to England, at the close of his diplomatic missions, in April 1624. Carew \\"followed the court before he was of it,\\" not receiving the definite commitment of the Chamber until 1628. According to a probably apocryphal story, while Carew held this office he displayed his tact and presence of mind by stumbling and extinguishing the candle he was holding to light Charles I into the queen's chamber, because he saw that Lord St Albans had his arm round her majesty's neck. The king suspected nothing, and the queen heaped favours on the poet. Probably in 1630 Carew was made \\"server\\" or taster-in-ordinary to the king. To this period may be attributed his close friendships with Sir John Suckling, Ben Jonson and Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon; the latter described Carew as \\"a person of pleasant and facetious wit.\\" John Donne, whose celebrity as a court-preacher lasted until his death in 1631, exercised a powerful influence over the genius of Carew. In February 1633 a masque by the latter, Coelum Britanicum, was acted in the Banqueting House at Whitehall, and was printed in 1634. The close of Carew's life is absolutely obscure. It was long supposed that he died in 1639, and this has been thought to be confirmed by the fact that the first edition of his Poems, published in 1640, seems to have a posthumous character. But Clarendon tells us that \\"after fifty years of life spent with less severity and exactness than it ought to have been, he died with the greatest remorse for that licence\\". If Carew was more than fifty years of age, he must have died during or after 1645, and in fact there were final additions made to his Poems in the third edition of 1651. Walton tells us that Carew in his last illness, being afflicted with the horrors, sent in great haste to \\"the ever- memorable\\" John Hales (1584‚Äì1656); Hales \\"told him he should have his prayers, but would by no means give him then either the sacrament or absolution.\\" Assessment Carew's poems are sensuous lyrics. They open to us, in his own phrase, \\"a mine of rich and pregnant fancy.\\" His metrical style was influenced by Jonson and his imagery by Donne, for whom he had an almost servile admiration. Carew had a lucidity and directness of lyrical utterance unknown to Donne. It is perhaps his greatest distinction that he is the earliest of the Cavalier song-writers by profession, of whom John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, was a later example, poets who turned the disreputable incidents of an idle court-life into poetry which was often of the rarest delicacy and the purest melody and colour. The longest of Carew's poems, \\"A Rapture,\\" would be more widely appreciated if the rich flow of its imagination were restrained by greater reticence of taste. A testimonial to his posterity is that he was analyzed by 19th century critics such as Charles Neaves, who even two centuries later found Carew on the sensuous border of propriety. Critical reception Carew has long been recognized as a notable figure in English literary history. His earliest critics ‚Äì chiefly other poets ‚Äì evidently knew his work from the many manuscripts that circulated. Among many others, two of the most celebrated writers of the age, Sir John Suckling and William Davenant, paid tribute to Carew, playfully admiring his poetic craftsmanship. Carew's reputation, however, experienced a slow but steady decline during the second half of the seventeenth century. Despite some interest in Carew in subsequent years, not until the twentieth century did critics offer a reexamination of Carew's place in English literary history. F. R. Leavis wrote in 1936: \\"Carew, it seems to me, has claims to more distinction than he is commonly accorded; more than he is accorded by the bracket that, in common acceptance, links him with Lovelace and Suckling.\\" More recently, Carew's place among the Cavalier Poets has been examined, as have his poetic affinities with Ben Jonson and John Donne; \\"A Rapture\\" has been scrutinized as both biography and fantasy; the funerary poetry has been studied as a subgenre; evidence of Carew's views concerning political hierarchy has been found in his occasional verse; and love and courtship have been probed as themes in the \\"Celia\\" poems. By the end of the twentieth century, Carew has been recognized as an important poet representative of his time and a master lyricist. According to Edmund Gosse, \\"Carew's poems, at their best, are brilliant lyrics of the purely sensuous order.\\" American author and naturalist Henry David Thoreau used Thomas Carew's poem, \\"The Pretensions of Poverty,\\" as a \\"complemental verse\\" to conclude the \\"Economy\\" chapter in his 1854 book, Walden. https://www.walden.org/work/walden/ Major poetry Poems. By Thomas Carew, Esquire is a collection of lyrics, songs, pastorals, poetic dialogues, elegies, addresses, and occasional poems. Most of the pieces are fairly short‚Äîthe longest, \\"A Rapture,\\" is 166 lines, and well over half are under 50 lines. The subjects are various: a number of poems treat love, lovemaking, and feminine beauty. Several of the poems, including \\"An Elegie upon the death of the Deane of Pauls, Dr. John Donne\\" are memorial tributes; others, notably \\"To Saxham,\\" celebrate country-house life; and a few record such events as the successful production of a play (\\"To my worthy Friend, M. D‚ÄôAvenant, upon his Excellent Play, The Iust Italian\\") or the marriage of friends (\\"On the Marriage of T. K. and C. C. the Morning Stormie\\"). Many of the songs and love poems are addressed to the still-unidentified \\"Celia,\\" a woman who was evidently Carew's lover for years. The poems to Celia treat the urgency of courtship, making much of the carpe diem theme. Others commend Celia through simile, conceit, and clich√©. The physical pleasures of love are likewise celebrated: \\"A Rapture\\" graphically documents a sexual encounter through analogy, euphemism, and paradox, while \\"Loves Courtship\\" responds to the early passing of virginity. A number of Carew's poems are concerned with the nature of poetry itself. His elegy on John Donne has been praised as both a masterpiece of criticism and a remarkably perceptive analysis of the metaphysical qualities of Donne's literary work. English poet and playwright Ben Jonson is the subject of another piece of critical verse, \\"To Ben. Johnson, Upon Occasion of His Ode of Defiance Annext to His Play of The New Inne.\\" This poem, like the elegy on Donne, is concerned with both the style and substance of the author's literary works as well as with personal qualities of the author himself. Among Carew's occasional, public verse are his addresses to ladies of fashion, commendations of the nobility, and laments for the passing of friends or public figures, such as Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden.

Having a child by a member of a belligerent force, throughout history and across cultures, is often considered a grave betrayal of social values. Commonly, the native parent (usually a woman) is disowned by family, friends, and society at large. The term \\"war child\\" is most commonly used for children born during World War II and its aftermath, particularly in relation to children born to fathers in German occupying forces in northern Europe. In Norway, there were also Lebensborn children. The discrimination suffered by the native parent and child in the postwar period did not take into account widespread rapes by occupying forces, or the relationships women had to form in order to survive the war years. Discrimination Children with a parent who was part of an occupying force, or whose parent(s) collaborated with enemy forces, are innocent of any war crimes committed by parents. Yet these children have often been condemned by descent from the enemy and discriminated against in their society. They also suffer from association with a parent whose war crimes are prosecuted in the postwar years. As such children grew to adolescence and adulthood, many harbored feelings of guilt and shame. An example are the children born during and after World War II whose fathers were military personnel in regions occupied by Nazi Germany. These children claim they lived with their identity in an inner exile until the 1980s, when some of them officially acknowledged their status. In 1987, Bente Blehr refused anonymity; an interview with her was published in Born Guilty, a collection of 12 interviews with persons whose parent(s) had been associated with German forces in occupied Norway. The first autobiography by the child of a German occupying soldier and Norwegian mother was The Boy from Gimle (1993) by Eystein Eggen; he dedicated his book to all such children. It was published in Norway. During and in the aftermath of war, women who have voluntary relationships with military personnel of an occupying force have historically been censured by their own society. Women who became pregnant from such unions would often take measures to conceal the father's status. They commonly chose among the following: *Arrange a marriage with a local man, who would take responsibility for the child *Claim the father was unknown, dead, or had left, and bring up the child as a single mother *Acknowledge the relationship; bring up the child as a single mother *Acknowledge the relationship; accept welfare from the occupying force (see the German Lebensborn) *Place the child in an orphanage or give the child up for adoption *Emigrate to the occupying country and claim that identity *Have an abortion After the war, it was common for both mother and child to suffer repercussions from the local population. Such repercussions were widespread throughout Europe. While some women and children suffered torture and deportation, most acts against them fell into one or several of the following categories: *Name calling: German whore and German kid were common labels *Isolation or harassment from the local community and at schools *Loss of work *Shaving the heads of the mothers (frequently done in the immediate aftermath of the war) in order to publicly identify and shame them *Temporary placement in confinement or internment camps While repercussions were most widespread immediately after the war, sentiments against the women and their children lingered into the 1950s, 60s, and beyond.  War children of World War II  Estimates of the number of war children fathered by German soldiers during World War II are difficult to gauge. Mothers tended to hide such pregnancies for fear of revenge and reprisal by family members. Lower estimates range in the hundreds of thousands, while upper estimates are much increased, into the millions. = Lebensborn program = A Lebensborn birth house Lebensborn was one of several programs initiated by the Nazi leader Heinrich Himmler to try to secure the racial heredity of the Third Reich. The program mainly served as a welfare institution for parents and children deemed racially valuable, initially, those of SS men. As German forces occupied nations in northern Europe, the organization expanded its program to provide care to suitable women and children, particularly in Norway, where the women were judged suitably Aryan. In Norway a local Lebensborn office, Abteilung Lebensborn, was established in 1941 to support children of German soldiers and their Norwegian mothers, pursuant to German law (Hitlers Verordnung, 28 July 1942). The organization ran several homes where pregnant women could give birth. Facilities also served as permanent homes for eligible women until the end of the war. Additionally, the organization paid child support on behalf of the father, and covered other expenses, including medical bills, dental treatment and transportation. In total, between 9 and 15 Lebensborn homes were established. Of the estimated 10,000‚Äì12,000 children born to Norwegian mothers and German fathers during the war, 8,000 were registered by Abteilung Lebensborn. In 4,000 of these cases, the father is known. The women were encouraged to give the children up for adoption, and many were transferred to Germany, where they were adopted or raised in orphanages. During and after the war, the Norwegians commonly referred to these children as tyskerunger, translating as \\"German-kids\\" or \\"Kraut kids\\", a derogatory term. As a result of later recognition of their post-war mistreatment, the more diplomatic term krigsbarn (war-children) came into use and is now the generally accepted form.  Post-war years  As the war ended, the children and their mothers were made outcasts by many among the general populace in formerly occupied countries, as societies grieved and resented the losses of the war, and actively rejected everything associated with Germany. The children and their mothers were often isolated socially, and many children were bullied by other children, and sometimes by adults, due to their origin. For instance, immediately after the peace, 14,000 women were arrested in Norway on suspicion of \\"collaboration\\" or association with the enemy; 5,000 were, without any judiciary process, placed in forced labor camps for a year and a half.. Their heads were shaved, and they were beaten and raped.. In an interview for the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter, war children claim that, while living at an orphanage in Bergen, they were forced as children to parade on the streets so the local population could whip them and spit at them. In a survey conducted by the Norwegian Ministry of Social Affairs in 1945, the local government in one third of the counties expressed an unfavorable view of the war children. The same year the Ministry of Social Affairs briefly explored the possibility of reuniting the children and their mothers with surviving fathers in post-war Germany, but decided against this. Five hundred children who were still cared for in Lebensborn facilities at the end of the war had to leave as the homes were closed down. Some children were left to state custody, during a time when such care was marked by strict rules, insufficient education, and abuse. Approximately 20 children ended up in a mental institution in 1946, due to lack of space in other institutions and unsuccessful adoption attempts. Some remained there past their eighteenth birthdays. Due to the political attitudes prevailing after the end of the war, the Norwegian government made proposals to forcibly deport 8000 children and their mothers to Germany, but there were concerns that the deportees would have no means of livelihood there. Another option was to send them to Sweden. Australia was also considered after the Swedish government declined to accept these people; the Norwegian government later shelved such proposals.  Financial and legal issues  In 1950, diplomatic relations improved so that the Norwegian government was able to collect child support from identified fathers of war children who were living in West Germany and Austria. As of 1953 such payments were made. Child support from fathers living in East Germany was kept in locked accounts until diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in 1975. Some of the war children have tried to obtain official recognition for past mistreatment. Supporters claim the discrimination against them equated to an attempt at genocide. In December 1999, 122 war children filed a claim in the Norwegian courts for the failure of the state to protect them as Norwegian citizens. The case was to test the boundaries of the law; seven persons signed the claim. The courts have ruled such suits as void due to the statute of limitations. The law of Norway allows citizens who have experienced neglect or mistreatment by failure of the state to apply for \\"simple compensation\\" (an arrangement that is not subject to the statute of limitations). In July 2004 the government expanded this compensation program to include war children who had experienced lesser difficulties. The basic compensation rate is set to 20,000 NOK (‚Ç¨2,500 / $3,000) for what Norwegian government terms \\"mobbing\\" (bullying). Those who can document other abuse can receive up to 200,000 NOK (25,000 ‚Ç¨ / $30,000). On 8 March 2007, 158 war children were to have their case heard at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. They demanded reparations of between 500,000 SEK (‚âà 431,272 NOK) and 2,000,000 SEK (‚âà 1,725,088 NOK) each for systematic abuse. The Norwegian government contested the claim that the children were abused with the consent of the government.. In 2008 their case before the European Court of Human Rights was dismissed, but they were each offered a ¬£8,000 token from the Norwegian government.  Medical experimentation  In conjunction with the 1999 claim by the war children, a motion was filed in September 2000 alleging that 10 war children were subject to experiments with LSD approved by the Norwegian government and financed by the CIA, the American intelligence agency.. In the postwar years, medical staff in several European countries, and the United States, conducted clinical trials or experimental treatment involving LSD, most of them at some point between 1950 and 1970. In Norway, trials involved volunteer patients under a protocol after traditional medical treatments had proved unsuccessful.  Acknowledgment and apology  Since the mid-80s, the fate of the war children has become well known in Norway. The government of Norway has acknowledged its neglect of them. The Prime Minister of Norway apologized publicly in his New Year's Eve speech in 2000. As adults, the 150 former Lebensborn Children are suing for reparations and damages from the Norwegian government for failing to protect them and discriminating against them.. The most famous of Norway's war children is Anni-Frid Lyngstad, the former ABBA singer. By marriage she is Princess Anni-Frid Reuss of Plauen. = Norway = German forces invaded Norway in 1940 and occupied the country until 1945. At the end of the war, the German forces stood at 372,000. It is estimated that between 10,000 and 12,000 children were born to Norwegian mothers with German partners during the occupation.. As Nazi ideology considered Norwegians to be pure Aryans, German authorities did not prohibit soldiers from pursuing relationships with Norwegian women. Their Lebensborn organization encouraged it. After the war these women especially, but also their children, were mistreated in Norway. = Denmark = German forces occupied Denmark between 1940 and 1945. German soldiers were encouraged to fraternize with Danish women, who were also considered pure Aryan. The government has estimated between 6,000 and 8,000 children were born to Danish mothers with German partners during or just after the occupation. The women were nicknamed \\"German Girls,\\" used in a pejorative sense. The Danish government has documented 5,579 such children.. In 1999 the Danish government allowed this group access to parenthood archives. They exempted these descendants from the country's normal secrecy period of 80 years for such records. = France = German soldiers were forbidden from having relationships with French women by the Nazi regime at the beginning of the Occupation. Due to difficulties of enforcement, the military later tolerated fraternization. This was an intermediate situation between the encouragement of similar relationships in Denmark and Norway, and strict prohibition in Eastern Europe. The different regulations were based on Nazi racial ideology as to which populations they considered racially pure enough as to be desirable for children born to their men. The number of war children born to French women in France by German soldier fathers in the years 1941‚Äì49, is estimated to be 75,000 to 200,000.(fr) Number of war children in Second World War in France from German soldiers and their French girl friends, Le Figaro, 30 November 2009Armin Hass: \\"Forschen und vers√∂hnen. Geschichten √ºber Kriegskinder und den verlorenen Gro√üonkel Joseph\\", Arolser Zeitung, 13 October 2011. (de) (Number of French war children). After the expulsion of German troops from France, those women who were known to have had relationships with German soldiers, were arrested, \\"judged,\\" and exposed in the streets to public condemnation and attacks. Having their heads shaved in public to mark them was a common punishment.(fr) Amicale Nationale des Enfants de la Guerre (Hrsg.): Des fleurs sur les cailloux. (Flowers on the pebbles), Editions Laurent Guillet, 2010, p. 6. Such descendants have formed a group to represent them, Amicale Nationale des Enfants de la Guerre. Another group of French, German and Austrian children of war exists under the name of Coeurs sans fronti√®res - Herzen ohne Grenzen.'''' = Finland = During the wartime and the post-war period, Finnish women gave birth to 468,269 children in Finland in the period 1940‚Äì1945. A small portion, about 1,100 of the children, were fathered by foreign troops. Some 700 children were born to German soldiers, 200‚Äì300 to Soviet POWs, and 100 to Swedish volunteers. Depending much on the foreign father's background, most of these children were left fatherless, and some of the mothers, along with their children, faced discrimination in Finnish society.‚ÄùRyss√§n heilat ja pikku-Iivanat‚Äù  German soldiers  Following the revision of the Anti-Comintern Pact in 1941, there were no more than 200,000 German soldiers in Finland, the vast majority of them stationed in the Finnish Lapland in the period 1941‚Äì1944. According to the National Archives of Finland, as many as 3,000 Finnish women, some working for the voluntary auxiliary paramilitary organisation Lotta Sv√§rd and some for the Wehrmacht, had relationships with German soldiers. An estimated 700 children were born to German soldiers in Finland, and were mostly unplanned.Saksalaissotilaiden lapset uskaltavat vihdoin astua esiin SVT.se Many German soldiers were aware of safe sex and the Wehrmacht kept them well-equipped with condoms, which has been estimated to effectively keep a relatively low impregnation rate for the Finnish women who had sexual intercourse with German soldiers. A booklet published by the OKW in 1943, Der deutsche Soldat und die Frau aus fremdem Volkstum, allowed German soldiers to marry those Finnish women who could be considered to represent the \\"Aryan race,\\" hinting that there was some uncertainty among Nazi authorities about ethnic Finns' \\"genetic suitability.\\" Finland was a co-belligerent from the summer of 1941, until September of 1944 when hostilities between Germany and Finland broke out following the Finnish armistice with the Allied Powers. During the autumn of 1944 alone, some 1,000 Finnish women, two-thirds of them aged between from 17 to 24, left the country with the departing German soldiers. The reasons for leaving the country with the enemy varied, but the most common reason was a relationship with a German soldier. Subsequently most of these women returned to Finland, as their presence was commonly unwelcome in Germany and some faced active mistreatment, such as forced labor.Uutuuskirja: Saksalaisten sotilaiden mukaan l√§hteneill√§ naisilla karujakin kohtaloita Iltalehti.fi After the war, most of the Finnish mothers that had children with German soldiers were left as single parents. Some of these children were adopted by the Finnish men who later married the children's mothers. Some Finnish women who were associated with German soldiers faced discrimination in Finnish society. The discrimination was not generally as harsh as that most other European women experienced elsewhere for the same reason, mostly due to the concept of a \\"Finnish-German brotherhood- in-arms\\" during the co-belligerence and their shared mutual enmity with the Soviet Union. Some Soviet POWs captured by the Finns were also intimately involved with Finnish women, a situation considered far more socially unacceptable and deserving of censure (see the section below). However the children fathered by German soldiers still encountered discrimination in their youth.  Soviet prisoners of war  During the wartime, there were about 69,700 Soviet POWs in Finland, of which 5,700 were taken in the Winter War (1939‚Äì40) and 64,000 between 1941 and 1944). Some POWs' living conditions were relatively good, as, at best, some 15,000 of them were placed on farms, where they were used as forced labor, usually working rather freely together with Finnish civilians, some of them having relationships with Finnish women. An estimated 600 Finnish women had relationships with Soviet POWs, and 200‚Äì300 children were born to POWs and Finnish women.Matka is√§n luo Yle.fi These women's backgrounds varied: some were unmarried, while others were widowed by the war. Some relationships were adulterous, as some of the women were married to Finnish soldiers who were absent at the time. The usage of condoms was scarce, partially due to the lack of their availability to POWs, and partially due to the lack of rural Finnish women's awareness of condom usage. After the Moscow Armistice, Finland started to return the surviving POWs to the Soviet Union, and most of the Finnish mothers that had children with POWs were left as single parents. Some of the mothers married Finnish men afterwards. Relationships between native women and ethnic Russian POWs were especially disapproved of in Finnish society, much more so than similar relationships with German soldiers and with POWs from other ethnic groups, such as Finno- Ugric peoples. A strong factor behind this greater censure was the long- lasting anti-Russian sentiment in Finland (ryss√§viha in Finnish). Some women's heads were shaved for allegedly having relationships with Soviet POWs. Pejorative terms such as ryss√§n heila (ryss√§'s girlfriend, the word ryss√§ being a common Finnish slur for a Russian) and ryss√§n huora (ryss√§'s whore) were widely used. The children fathered by Soviet POWs also faced discrimination in their youth, such as bullying in school.  Swedish volunteers  Overall there were about 11,000 Swedish volunteers who fought for Finland at some point during wartime. During the Winter War, Swedish volunteers numbered 9,640 and between 1941 and 1944, there were over 1,600 Swedish volunteers, of which about a third had previously participated in the Winter War. About 100 children were born to Finnish women and Swedish volunteers. Often these women moved to Sweden with their children. = Greece = Little is known about the Greek Wehrmacht children, since it is still an issue surrounded by taboo in Greece, but Greek children of Wehrmacht soldiers are known to have been subjected to public humiliation. Frequently, they were called \\"Germanobastardos\\" (Greek for \\"German bastard\\"). The mothers were discriminated against as well, and the children suffered both due to having a stigmatized mother and frequently an unknown father. Quite often, the mothers blamed the children for their bad situation.. There is no official record of these children, but researchers estimate their number to be at least 200. The relatively low number, some authors argue, was because only a small proportion of pregnancies resulted in births, due to the mothers' fears of discrimination.. Abortions were easily accessible in Greece at that time, and the Orthodox Church encouraged silence on the matter and assisted women in obtaining abortions.. = Netherlands = The Nazis considered the women of the Netherlands to be Aryan and acceptable for fraternization by German soldiers. The Dutch Institute for War Documentation originally estimated that around 10,000 children by German fathers were born to Dutch mothers during the occupation. However, recent figures, based on newly available records at the archives of the German Wehrmacht (name of the German armed forces from 1935‚Äì45), indicate that the true number could be as high as 50,000.. Post- war children =Fathered by Allied Forces in Germany= The Allied forces occupied Germany for several years after World War II. The book GIs and Fr√§uleins, by Maria Hohn, documents 66,000 German children born to fathers who were soldiers of Allied forces in the period 1945‚Äì55: *American parent: 36,334 *French parent: 10,188 *British parent: 8,397 *Soviet parent: 3,105 *Belgian parent: 1,767 *Other/unknown: 6,829  American  According to Perry Biddiscombe, more than 37,000 illegitimate children were sired by American fathers in the 10 years following the German surrender (in general agreement with Hohn's numbers cited above). Locals generally disapproved of any relations between the occupation forces and German and Austrian women. Not only were the Americans the recent enemy, but the residents feared the American fathers would abandon the mothers and children to be cared for by the local communities, which were severely impoverished after the war. A majority of the 37,000 illegitimate children ended up as wards of the social services for at least some time. Many of the children remained wards of the state for a long time, especially children of African-American fathers. The mixed-race children, called \\"brown children\\", were seldom adopted in what was then a very racially homogeneous country. Arrangements were made for some such children to be adopted by African-American couples or families in the United States. The food situation in occupied Germany was initially very dire. By the spring of 1946, the official ration in the US zone was no more than 1275 calories per day (much less than the minimum required to maintain health), with some areas probably receiving as little as 700. Some US soldiers exploited this desperate situation to their advantage, using their ample supply of food and cigarettes (the currency of the black market) as what became known as \\"frau bait\\". Each side continued to view the other as the enemy, even while exchanging food for sex. The often destitute mothers of the resulting children usually received no alimony. Between 1950 and 1955, the Allied High Commission for Germany prohibited \\"proceedings to establish paternity or liability for maintenance of children.\\". Even after the lifting of the ban, West German courts had little power to gain child support from American soldiers. The children of black American soldiers, commonly called Negermischlinge (\\"Negro half-breeds\\"), were particularly disadvantaged. Even in the cases where the soldier wanted to marry the mother of his child, he was prevented by the US Army, which prohibited any interracial marriages until 1948, when the Army was integrated by Executive Order of President Harry Truman. In the earliest stages of the occupation, American soldiers were not allowed to pay maintenance for children they admitted having fathered, the military classifying any such assistance as \\"aiding the enemy\\". Marriages between white US soldiers and Austrian women were prohibited until January 1946, and with German women until December 1946. The official United States policy on war children was summed up in the Stars and Stripes on 8 April 1946, in the article \\"Pregnant Frauleins Are Warned!\\": > Girls who are expecting a child fathered by an American soldier will be > provided with no assistance by the American Army ... If the soldier denies > paternity, no further action will be undertaken other than to merely inform > the woman of this fact. She is to be advised to seek help from a German or > Austrian welfare organization. If the soldier is already in the United > States, his address is not to be communicated to the woman in question, the > soldier may be honorably discharged from the army and his demobilization > will in no way be delayed. Claims for child support from unmarried German > and Austrian mothers will not be recognized. If the soldier voluntarily > acknowledges paternity, he is to provide for the woman in an appropriate > manner.  British  British troops also occupied a portion of what later was organized as West Germany. Fraternisation between soldiers and local German women was discouraged by British authorities because of the status of Germans as the enemy during the war. Notable children of British servicemen and German mothers include Lewis Holtby, Kevin Kerr, Maik Taylor and David McAllister.  Canadian  Canada declared war on Germany in 1939, following Britain's war declaration the week before. During the war Canadian forces participated in the Allied invasions of both Italy and Normandy. Before the invasion of continental Europe, a significant number of Canadian forces were stationed in Britain. An estimated 22,000 children were born to British mothers and Canadian soldiers stationed in Britain. In continental Europe, it has been estimated that 6,000 were born to Canadian fathers in the Netherlands, with smaller numbers born in Belgium and other places where Canadian forces were stationed during and after the war.. A famous example is Eric Clapton. =In the following countries= Netherlands On liberation, many Dutch women welcomed the Allied troops and had relationships that resulted in babies; these were called 'Liberation babies'.. It is estimated that about 4,000 \\"liberation babies\\" were fathered by Canadian soldiers before they left the area in early 1946. Austria In Austria, war children (\\"Russenkind\\") by known Russian fathers of the occupation were discriminated against, as were their mothers. The Austrians also resented women who had relations with American soldiers, calling them 'Yanks' chicks' (¬ªAmischickse¬´) or 'Dollar sluts' (¬ªDollarflitscherl¬´) and, in the case of those who had relations with black soldiers, 'chocolate girl' (¬ªSchokoladenm√§dchen¬´).. In April 1946, the Stars and Stripes newspaper warned \\"pregnant Fr√§uleins\\" that military authorities would provide no assistance to them or their children if the fathers were US soldiers. The paper said that a \\"\\"Strength Through Joy\\" girl who ate from the forbidden fruit should accept the consequences,\\" referring to a Nazi slogan. In coordination with American groups, an Austrian welfare program was started after the war to send the mixed-race children of Austrian/African-American parents to the United States for adoption by African-American families. The children by then ranged in age from 4 to 7 years. Amerasians Probably more than 100,000 children have been born to Asian mothers and US servicemen in Asia. This occurred chiefly during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Some of these children were born to mothers raped by men living on several US military bases in the region since World War II. Collectively these children are known as Amerasians, a term coined by the author Pearl S. Buck. Lai ƒê·∫°i H√†n The term Lai Dai Han (or sometimes Lai Daihan/Lai Tai Han) is a Vietnamese term for a mixed ancestry person born to a South Korean father and a Vietnamese mother, including the victims of sexual assault by Korean soldiers, during the Vietnam War. Lai Dai Han often live at the margins of Vietnamese society. The exact number of Lai Daihan is unknown. According to Busan Ilbo, there are at least 5,000 and as many as 30,000. Eurasians Numerous Asian-European children were also born during the colonial years of the British, French, and Dutch administrations in India and various Southeast Asian countries. In many cases, the father was a colonial civil servant, settler or military officer based in the occupied Asian country while the mother was a local. The term \\"Eurasian\\" is used but has variants depending on country of origin and nationality of the parents. Examples include the Burghers (Portuguese or Dutch) in Sri Lanka, Kristang (usually Portuguese) in Malaysia and Goans (Portuguese) and Anglo- Indians (British) in India. Cases of rape Numerous war children were born as the result of their mothers being raped by enemy forces during World War II. Military rape of conquered women has been practiced in numerous conflicts throughout human history. Recent examples include during the longstanding wars in the Congo and Sudan. =Former Yugoslavia= In the 1990s organizations were formed to classify such violence against women as among the prosecutable war crimes in former Yugoslavia. Some Muslim women in Bosnia who were raped in Serbian camps were aided by humanitarian organizations.Alexandra Stiglmayer (Hg.), Massenvergewaltigung. Krieg gegen die Frauen, Frankfurt a. M. (Fischer) 1993, p. 154-174; . Situation of mothers, war children and fathers =Prevention= The recognition in 1989 that violence against women in the form of rape was a deliberate military strategy and human rights abuse led to the approval of an international Convention on the Rights of the Child. Since 2008, the United Nations Security Council bans such sexual violations, defining them as a war crime. The German weekly Die Zeit described this action as an historical milestone.. =Integration= One author suggested that adoption and assimilation of a child into a new family might be a solution to prevent war children from growing up as unwanted and mobbed by people in a hostile environment.. The sheer number of such children suggest this is impractical. =War children's ignorance of origins= Often war children never understood the reason they were being isolated or mistreated. They did not learn their father's identities until late in life or by chance: * by comments of their classmates, relatives or neighbours * when they needed official documents e. g. family register, or * after their mothers died.. In most cases, when war children tried to learn identities of their biological fathers years later, the searches were usually difficult and often in vain. =Fathers unknown= Occupation forces after World War II strictly interdicted fraternization by military personnel with people of the occupied territories. Couples who became involved tried to hide their relationship because of these interdictions and the resentment and disapproval by the occupied population. Fathers of war children were generally excepted from civil actions by mothers to claim alimony or child support. Communication with the mothers of war children often ceased when the soldiers suddenly were reassigned, often without time to say goodbye. Some of the soldiers were killed in action. In the post-war period, soldier fathers were prevented by conditions from returning to former native women and war children even if they wanted to. Others had wives and families to return to at home, and denied having war children. In some cases, they never knew they had sired children when serving abroad.(de) Thorsten Knuf: \\"Kinder des Krieges\\", Berliner Zeitung, 5 May 2010, p. 3 =Mothers traumatized= At the end of war, mothers with war children were prosecuted as criminals and punished in humiliating ways for their relations with the enemy. They were isolated socially and economically. Many of them could only rehabilitate themselves and become respected by marrying a fellow countryman. Long-term persecution of a former girlfriend of a German soldier is documented in a book by ANEG; she says that she was traumatized for the rest of her life. Some of the mothers gave their war child to a home of public welfare. Others tried to integrate the child into the family formed with their new partner and children (step family). Some of the mothers died during the war. Children in search for their fathers A network of European war children, \\"Born of War ‚Äî international network,\\" was founded in October 2005. They meet every year in Berlin to assist each other, make decisions about searching for parents, and find out new positions.. =Searches by war children of World War II= Changing opinions Since the late 20th century, as they reach retirement age, many war children from World War II have begun to search for their full identity and their roots. The legal children of a German father may also be interested in contacting the previously unknown war child of their father, if they know one or more exists. Public opinion has become more compassionate toward the past generation of war children. Few of the biological fathers are still alive. Subject to bullying and humiliation, many of the mothers never told their children about their foreign fathers. Norway The government has advised that persons trying to do research should gather the complete birth documents, including the birth certificate (not only parts of it). The Norwegian archive at Victoria Terrasse in Oslo burned down in the 1950s, and many of these important documents were lost. The Norwegian Red Cross has some records. It is often easier to trace the Norwegian mother first by Church records. Belgium The government and researchers recommend that persons search for documentary evidence from Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt, Auslandsorganisation ‚Äì Amt f√ºr Volkswohlfahrt und Winterhilfswerk (1941‚Äì1944) about alimony payments. Old photographs with greetings on the back or private letters may provide clues to a father's identity.. France Since 2005 the society, Amicale Nationale des Enfants de la Guerre (ANEG), has worked in both France and Germany to help descendants of parents of mixed nationalities, whether a German father in France or French father in occupied Germany.. C≈ìurs Sans Fronti√®res/Herzen ohne Grenzen (Hearts without Frontiers) is another French / German organization supporting the search for family members of French children whose fathers were German soldiers during the occupation and German or Austrian children whose fathers were prisoners, forced laborers or French soldiers in the immediate post-war period.. Germany Mixed children of white German women and black WWI soldiers were called \\"Rhineland Bastards\\". This phrase, along with many other racial epithets, reinforced the current ideology that black men were beasts and did not care for their children. The \\"Brown Babies\\" became an international concern, with the Black American Press publicizing and advertising for adoptions. In these efforts there was a distinct emphasis in both countries on the skin color of the child (for example: advertised as \\"Brown Babies\\" rather than simply as \\"orphans\\"). This was important because a dark skin color both excluded children from German national identity, and allowed them more acceptance in America than was offered to light-skinned \\"German\\" babies. This distinction was further emphasized when \\"Brown Babies\\" who were adopted into the US were afterwards forbidden from speaking their native German. This served efforts to erase an entire generation of Afro- Germans.

Before 1956, it was an administratively separate Coorg State, at which point it was merged into an enlarged Mysore State. It occupies an area of in the Western Ghats of southwestern Karnataka. In 2001 its population was 548,561, 13.74% of which resided in the district's urban centre, making it the least populous of the 30 districts in Karnataka.The nearest railway stations are Mysore Junction, located around 95 km away and Thalassery and Kannur in Kerala, at a distance of 79 km. The nearest airports are Kannur International Airport in Kerala (59 km from Kodagu) and Mangalore International Airport (117 km from Kodagu). Geography Kodagu is located on the eastern slopes of the Western Ghats. It has a geographical area of . The district is bordered by Dakshina Kannada district to the northwest, Hassan district to the north, Mysore district to the east, Kasaragod district of Kerala in west and Kannur district of Kerala to the southwest, and Wayanad district of Kerala to the south. It is a hilly district, the lowest elevation of which is above sea-level. The highest peak, Tadiandamol, rises to , with Pushpagiri, the second highest, at . The main river in Kodagu is the Kaveri (Cauvery), which originates at Talakaveri, located on the eastern side of the Western Ghats, and with its tributaries, drains the greater part of Kodagu. Administrative divisions =Taluks= The district is divided into the three administrative taluks: * Madikeri * Virajpet * Somwarpet =Representation= Two members of the legislative assembly are elected from Kodagu to the Karnataka Legislative Assembly, one each from the Madikeri and Virajpet. M P Appachu Ranjan represents the Madikeri constituency while K. G. Bopaiah represents the Virajpet constituency; they are from the Bharatiya Janata Party. Kodagu, formerly part of the Kodagu-Dakshina Kannada (Mangalore) constituency, is now part of the Mysore Lok Sabha parliamentary constituency. The current MP for this constituency is Shri Pratap Simha, from the Bharatiya Janata Party. The Codava National Council and Kodava Rashtriya Samiti are campaigning for autonomy to Kodagu district. History Map of South Indian states prior to the States Reorganisation Act, 1956. Kodagu (then called Coorg) is in dark green. Kalbane Yemmegundi palace The Kodavas were the earliest inhabitants and agriculturists in Kodagu, having lived there for centuries. Being a warrior community as well, they carried arms during times of war and had their own chieftains. The Haleri dynasty, an offshoot of the Keladi Nayakas, ruled Kodagu between 1600 and 1834. Later the British ruled Kodagu from 1834, after the Coorg War, until India's independence in 1947. A separate state (called Coorg State) until then, in 1956 Kodagu was merged with the Mysore State (now Karnataka). =Coorg in British India= In 1834, the East India Company annexed Kodagu into British India, after deposing Chikka Virarajendra of the Kodagu kingdom, as 'Coorg'. The people accepted British rule peacefully. British rule led to the establishment of educational institutions, introduction of scientific coffee cultivation, better administration and improvement of the economy. Demographics Kodavas, 1875, from: \\"The people of India: A series of photographic illustrations...\\" (New York Public Library). According to the 2011 census of India, Kodagu has a population of 554,519, roughly equal to the Solomon Islands or the US state of Wyoming. This ranks it 539 out of 640 districts in India in terms of population. The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001‚Äì2011 was 1.13%. Kodagu has a sex ratio of 1019 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 82.52%. Kodava Takk is the spoken language native to Kodagu. Are Bhashe, a dialect of Kannada, is native to Sulya in Dakshina Kannada. Both use Kannada script for literature.K S Rajyashree, Kodava speech community : An ethnolinguistic study According to Karnataka Kodava Sahitya Academy (Karnataka's Kodava Literary Academy), apart from Kodavas, and their related groups, the Amma Kodavas, the Kodava Peggade (Kodagu Heggade) and the Kodava Maaple (Kodava Muslims), 18 other smaller- numbered ethnic groups speak Kodava Takk in and outside the district including the Iri (Airi, or the carpenters and the village smiths), the Koyava, the Banna, the Kodagu Madivala (washermen), the Kodagu Hajama (barber, also called Nainda), the Kembatti Poleya (household servants and labourers) and the Meda (basket and mat weavers and drummers). Less frequent are Tulu speakers Billavas, Mogaveeras, Bunts, Goud Saraswat Brahmins. =Other Kodava speakers= Among other Kodava speaking communities are: the Heggades, cultivators from Malabar; the Kodava Nair, cultivators from Malabar; the Ayiri, who constitute the artisan caste; the Medas, who are basket and mat- weavers and act as drummers at feasts; the Binepatta, originally wandering musicians from Malabar, now farmers; and the Kavadi, cultivators settled in Yedenalknad (Virajpet). All these groups speak the Kodava language and conform generally to Kodava customs and dress. =Kodagu Aarebashe Gowda people= The Arebhashe gowdas, or Kodagu Gowdas, and Tulu Gowdas, are an ethnic group of Dakshina Kannada and Kodagu. They live in Sulya (in Dakshina Kannada) and in parts of Somwarpet, Kushalanagar, Bhagamandala and Madikeri. They speak a language known as Arebhashe a dialect of Kannada. Guddemane Appaiah Gowda along with many other freedom fighters from different communities revolted against the British in an armed struggle which covered entire Kodagu and Dakshina Kannada.

A sizeable of them are the Nawayaths who shifted in the eighties from Bhatkal and Murdeshwar in order to pursue coffee & arecanut plantations and textile business. The numerous mosque dotting the landscape is the testimony of Muslim presence in the district. A small number of Mangalorean Catholics are also found in Coorg. They are mostly descended from those Konkani Catholics who fled the roundup and, later, captivity by Tippu Sultan. These immigrants were welcomed by Raja Veerarajendra (himself a former captive of Tippu Sultan, having escaped six years of captivity in 1788) who realising their usefulness and expertise as agriculturists, gave them lands and tax breaks and built a church for them.Sarasvati's Children: A History of the Mangalorean Christians, Alan Machado Prabhu, I.J.A.

Bhagamandala is situated at the Sangama (confluence) of two rivers, the Kaveri and the Kannika. A third river, the Sujyothi, is said to join from underground, and hence this spot is called the Triveni Sangama. Iruppu Falls is a sacred Kodagu Hindu spot in South Kodagu in the Brahmagiri hill range. The Lakshmana Tirtha River, with the waterfalls, flows nearby and has a Rameshwara temple on its banks. It is said that this sacred river was created when Laxmana, prince of Ayodhya and younger brother of Lord Rama, shot an arrow into nearby hill, the Brahmagiri hill. Chelavara falls and Thadiandamol peak are also in South Kodagu. Nagarahole is a national park and wildlife resort. *Madikeri is the capital of the district and Raja's Seat park is popular with tourists.http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/19/Madikeri.html Kootu Poley dam is also popular among tourists. Omkareshwara Temple is a beautiful temple built in the Indo-Sarcenic style in Coorg. A legend is associated with the temple, built by Lingarajendra II in 1820 CE. The king put to death a pious Brahmin who dared to protest against his misdeeds. The spirit of the dead man began to plague the king day and night. On the advice of wise men, the king built this temple and installed a Shivalinga procured from Kashi, North India. St. Mark's Church is located within the Mercara Fort and was raised in 1859, by the officers and men of the East India Company. The building was funded by the Government of Madras, and placed under the Church of England in India, Diocese of Madras. The Church was closed after Indian independence, and taken over by the Government of Karnataka in 1971. The building now houses the Madikeri Fort Museum, managed by the Karnataka State Archaeological Department. *Dubare is mainly an elephant-capturing and training camp of the Forest Department at the edge of Dubare forest; on the bank of the river Kaveri along the Kushalanagara ‚Äì Siddapura road. Nisargadhama is a man-made island and picnic spot near Kushalanagara, formed by the river Kaveri. The Tibetan Buddhist Golden Temple is at Bylakuppe near Kushalnagara (Mysore district), in the Tibetan refugee settlement. *Abbey Falls is a scenic waterfall 5 km from Madikeri. Mallalli falls is 25 km from Somawarapet, downhill of the Pushpagiri hills.http://www.newskarnataka.com/nature/abbey- falls-a-tourists-delight Mandalapatti is 28 km from Madikeri.

There are many causes of power failures in an electricity network. Examples of these causes include faults at power stations, damage to electric transmission lines, substations or other parts of the distribution system, a short circuit, cascading failure, fuse or circuit breaker operation. Power failures are particularly critical at sites where the environment and public safety are at risk. Institutions such as hospitals, sewage treatment plants, and mines will usually have backup power sources such as standby generators, which will automatically start up when electrical power is lost. Other critical systems, such as telecommunication, are also required to have emergency power. The battery room of a telephone exchange usually has arrays of lead‚Äìacid batteries for backup and also a socket for connecting a generator during extended periods of outage.  Types of power outage  Blackout Transient fault Power outages are categorized into three different phenomena, relating to the duration and effect of the outage: * A transient fault is a loss of power typically caused by a fault on a power line. Power is automatically restored once the fault is cleared. * A brownout is a drop in voltage in an electrical power supply. The term brownout comes from the dimming experienced by lighting when the voltage sags. Brownouts can cause poor performance of equipment or even incorrect operation. * A blackout is the total loss of power to an area and is the most severe form of power outage that can occur. Blackouts which result from or result in power stations tripping are particularly difficult to recover from quickly. Outages may last from a few minutes to a few weeks depending on the nature of the blackout and the configuration of the electrical network. Rolling blackouts occur when demand for electricity exceeds supply, and allow some customers to receive power at the required voltage at the expense of other customers who get no power at all. They are a common occurrence in developing countries, and may be scheduled in advance or occur without warning. They have also occurred in developed countries, for example in the California electricity crisis of 2000-2001, when government deregulation destabilized the wholesale electricity market. Blackouts are also used as a public safety measure, such as to prevent a gas leak from catching fire (for example, power was cut to several towns in response to the Merrimack Valley gas explosions), or to prevent wildfires around poorly maintained transmission lines (such as during the 2019 California power shutoffs).  Protecting the power system from outages  Tree limbs creating a short circuit in electrical lines during a storm. This typically results in a power outage in the area supplied by these lines In power supply networks, the power generation and the electrical load (demand) must be very close to equal every second to avoid overloading of network components, which can severely damage them. Protective relays and fuses are used to automatically detect overloads and to disconnect circuits at risk of damage. Under certain conditions, a network component shutting down can cause current fluctuations in neighboring segments of the network leading to a cascading failure of a larger section of the network. This may range from a building, to a block, to an entire city, to an entire electrical grid. Modern power systems are designed to be resistant to this sort of cascading failure, but it may be unavoidable (see below). Moreover, since there is no short-term economic benefit to preventing rare large-scale failures, researchers have expressed concern that there is a tendency to erode the resilience of the network over time, which is only corrected after a major failure occurs. In a 2003 publication, Carreras and co-authors claimed that reducing the likelihood of small outages only increases the likelihood of larger ones. In that case, the short-term economic benefit of keeping the individual customer happy increases the likelihood of large-scale blackouts. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing in October 2018 to examine \\"black start\\", the process of restoring electricity after a system-wide power loss. The hearing's purpose was for Congress to learn about what the backup plans are in the electric utility industry in the case that the electric grid is damaged. Threats to the electrical grid include cyberattacks, solar storms, and severe weather, among others. For example, the \\"Northeast Blackout of 2003\\" was caused when overgrown trees touched high-voltage power lines. Around 55 million people in the U.S. and Canada lost power, and restoring it cost around $6 billion.  Protecting computer systems from power outages  Computer systems and other electronic devices containing logic circuitry are susceptible to data loss or hardware damage that can be caused by the sudden loss of power. These can include data networking equipment, video projectors, alarm systems as well as computers. To protect computer systems against this, the use of an uninterruptible power supply or 'UPS' can provide a constant flow of electricity if a primary power supply becomes unavailable for a short period of time. To protect against surges (events where voltages increase for a few seconds), which can damage hardware when power is restored, a special device called a surge protector that absorbs the excess voltage can be used.  Restoring power after a wide-area outage  Restoring power after a wide- area outage can be difficult, as power stations need to be brought back online. Normally, this is done with the help of power from the rest of the grid. In the total absence of grid power, a so-called black start needs to be performed to bootstrap the power grid into operation. The means of doing so will depend greatly on local circumstances and operational policies, but typically transmission utilities will establish localized 'power islands' which are then progressively coupled together. To maintain supply frequencies within tolerable limits during this process, demand must be reconnected at the same pace that generation is restored, requiring close coordination between power stations, transmission and distribution organizations.  Blackout inevitability and electric sustainability  SAIDI value), in 2014. = Self-organized criticality = It has been argued on the basis of historical data and computer modelingMicrosoft Word ‚Äì HICSS2002-paper2 that power grids are self-organized critical systems. These systems exhibit unavoidable disturbances of all sizes, up to the size of the entire system. This phenomenon has been attributed to steadily increasing demand/load, the economics of running a power company, and the limits of modern engineering.Dobson et al. Complex systems analysis of series of blackouts: Cascading failure, critical points, and self-organization. Chaos 17, 2007. While blackout frequency has been shown to be reduced by operating it further from its critical point, it generally isn‚Äôt economically feasible, causing providers to increase the average load over time or upgrade less often resulting in the grid moving itself closer to its critical point. Conversely, a system past the critical point will experience too many blackouts leading to system-wide upgrades moving it back below the critical point. The term critical point of the system is used here in the sense of statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics, representing the point where a system undergoes a phase transition; in this case the transition from a steady reliable grid with few cascading failures to a very sporadic unreliable grid with common cascading failures. Near the critical point the relationship between blackout frequency and size follows a power-law distribution. Cascading failure becomes much more common close to this critical point. The power-law relationship is seen in both historical data and model systems. The practice of operating these systems much closer to their maximum capacity leads to magnified effects of random, unavoidable disturbances due to aging, weather, human interaction etc. While near the critical point, these failures have a greater effect on the surrounding components due to individual components carrying a larger load. This results in the larger load from the failing component having to be redistributed in larger quantities across the system, making it more likely for additional components not directly affected by the disturbance to fail, igniting costly and dangerous cascading failures. These initial disturbances causing blackouts are all the more unexpected and unavoidable due to actions of the power suppliers to prevent obvious disturbances (cutting back trees, separating lines in windy areas, replacing aging components etc.). The complexity of most power grids often makes the initial cause of a blackout extremely hard to identify. Other leaders are dismissive of system theories that conclude that blackouts are inevitable, but do agree that the basic operation of the grid must be changed. The Electric Power Research Institute champions the use of smart grid features such as power control devices employing advanced sensors to coordinate the grid. Others advocate greater use of electronically controlled high-voltage direct current (HVDC) firebreaks to prevent disturbances from cascading across AC lines in a wide area grid. = OPA model = In 2002, researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Power System Engineering Research Center of the University of Wisconsin (PSerc), and the University of Alaska Fairbanks proposed a mathematical model for the behavior of electrical distribution systems. This model has become known as the OPA model, a reference to the names of the authors' institutions. OPA is a cascading failure model. Other cascading failure models include Manchester, Hidden failure, CASCADE, and Branching. The OPA model was quantitatively compared with a complex networks model of a cascading failure ‚Äì Crucitti‚ÄìLatora‚ÄìMarchiori (CLM) model, showing that both models exhibit similar phase transitions in the average network damage (load shed/demand in OPA, path damage in CLM), with respect to transmission capacity. = Mitigation of power outage frequency = The effects of trying to mitigate cascading failures near the critical point in an economically feasible fashion are often shown to not be beneficial and often even detrimental. Four mitigation methods have been tested using the OPA blackout model: * Increase critical number of failures causing cascading blackouts ‚Äì Shown to decrease the frequency of smaller blackouts but increase that of larger blackouts. * Increase individual power line max load ‚Äì Shown to increase the frequency of smaller blackouts and decrease that of larger blackouts. * Combination of increasing critical number and max load of lines ‚Äì Shown to have no significant effect on either size of blackout. The resulting minor reduction in the frequency of blackouts is projected to not be worth the cost of the implementation. * Increase the excess power available to the grid ‚Äì Shown to decrease the frequency of smaller blackouts but increase that of larger blackouts. In addition to the finding of each mitigation strategy having a cost-benefit relationship with regards to frequency of small and large blackouts, the total number of blackout events was not significantly reduced by any of the above-mentioned mitigation measures. A complex network-based model to control large cascading failures (blackouts) using local information only was proposed by A. E. Motter. One of the solutions proposed to reduce the impact of power outage was introduced by M. Saleh.

It was developed in 1927 by the British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington, and is an unsolved general physics question. This direction, according to Eddington, could be determined by studying the organization of atoms, molecules, and bodies, and might be drawn upon a four-dimensional relativistic map of the world (\\"a solid block of paper\\")., Chapter 4, p. 143 Physical processes at the microscopic level are believed to be either entirely or mostly time-symmetric: if the direction of time were to reverse, the theoretical statements that describe them would remain true. Yet at the macroscopic level it often appears that this is not the case: there is an obvious direction (or flow) of time.  Overview  The symmetry of time (T-symmetry) can be understood simply as the following: if time were perfectly symmetrical, a video of real events would seem realistic whether played forwards or backwards.David Albert on Time and Chance Gravity, for example, is a time-reversible force. A ball that is tossed up, slows to a stop, and falls is a case where recordings would look equally realistic forwards and backwards. The system is T-symmetrical. However, the process of the ball bouncing and eventually coming to a stop is not time- reversible. While going forward, kinetic energy is dissipated and entropy is increased. Entropy may be one of the few processes that is not time- reversible. According to the statistical notion of increasing entropy, the \\"arrow\\" of time is identified with a decrease of free energy.  Conception by Eddington  In the 1928 book The Nature of the Physical World, which helped to popularize the concept, Eddington stated: > Let us draw an arrow arbitrarily. If as we follow the arrow we find more and > more of the random element in the state of the world, then the arrow is > pointing towards the future; if the random element decreases the arrow > points towards the past. That is the only distinction known to physics. This > follows at once if our fundamental contention is admitted that the > introduction of randomness is the only thing which cannot be undone. I shall > use the phrase 'time's arrow' to express this one-way property of time which > has no analogue in space. Eddington then gives three points to note about this arrow: # It is vividly recognized by consciousness. # It is equally insisted on by our reasoning faculty, which tells us that a reversal of the arrow would render the external world nonsensical. # It makes no appearance in physical science except in the study of organization of a number of individuals. (By which he means that it is only observed in entropy, a statistical mechanics phenomenon arising from a system.) According to Eddington the arrow indicates the direction of progressive increase of the random element. Following a lengthy argument upon the nature of thermodynamics he concludes that, so far as physics is concerned, time's arrow is a property of entropy alone.  Arrows  = Thermodynamic arrow of time = The arrow of time is the \\"one-way direction\\" or \\"asymmetry\\" of time. The thermodynamic arrow of time is provided by the second law of thermodynamics, which says that in an isolated system, entropy tends to increase with time. Entropy can be thought of as a measure of microscopic disorder; thus the second law implies that time is asymmetrical with respect to the amount of order in an isolated system: as a system advances through time, it becomes more statistically disordered. This asymmetry can be used empirically to distinguish between future and past, though measuring entropy does not accurately measure time. Also, in an open system, entropy can decrease with time. British physicist Sir Alfred Brian Pippard wrote, \\"There is thus no justification for the view, often glibly repeated, that the Second Law of Thermodynamics is only statistically true, in the sense that microscopic violations repeatedly occur, but never violations of any serious magnitude. On the contrary, no evidence has ever been presented that the Second Law breaks down under any circumstances.\\"A. B. Pippard, Elements of Chemical Thermodynamics for Advanced Students of Physics (1966), p.100. However, there are a number of paradoxes regarding violation of the second law of thermodynamics, one of them due to the Poincar√© recurrence theorem. This arrow of time seems to be related to all other arrows of time and arguably underlies some of them, with the exception of the weak arrow of time. Harold Blum's 1951 book Time's Arrow and Evolution \\"explored the relationship between time's arrow (the second law of thermodynamics) and organic evolution.\\" This influential text explores \\"irreversibility and direction in evolution and order, negentropy, and evolution.\\" Blum argues that evolution followed specific patterns predetermined by the inorganic nature of the earth and its thermodynamic processes. = Cosmological arrow of time = The cosmological arrow of time points in the direction of the universe's expansion. It may be linked to the thermodynamic arrow, with the universe heading towards a heat death (Big Chill) as the amount of usable energy becomes negligible. Alternatively, it may be an artifact of our place in the universe's evolution (see the Anthropic bias), with this arrow reversing as gravity pulls everything back into a Big Crunch. If this arrow of time is related to the other arrows of time, then the future is by definition the direction towards which the universe becomes bigger. Thus, the universe expands‚Äîrather than shrinks‚Äîby definition. The thermodynamic arrow of time and the second law of thermodynamics are thought to be a consequence of the initial conditions in the early universe. Therefore, they ultimately result from the cosmological set-up. = Radiative arrow of time = Waves, from radio waves to sound waves to those on a pond from throwing a stone, expand outward from their source, even though the wave equations accommodate solutions of convergent waves as well as radiative ones. This arrow has been reversed in carefully worked experiments that created convergent waves, so this arrow probably follows from the thermodynamic arrow in that meeting the conditions to produce a convergent wave requires more order than the conditions for a radiative wave. Put differently, the probability for initial conditions that produce a convergent wave is much lower than the probability for initial conditions that produce a radiative wave. In fact, normally a radiative wave increases entropy, while a convergent wave decreases it, making the latter contradictory to the second law of thermodynamics in usual circumstances. = Causal arrow of time = A cause precedes its effect: the causal event occurs before the event it causes or affects. Birth, for example, follows a successful conception and not vice versa. Thus causality is intimately bound up with time's arrow. An epistemological problem with using causality as an arrow of time is that, as David Hume maintained, the causal relation per se cannot be perceived; one only perceives sequences of events. Furthermore, it is surprisingly difficult to provide a clear explanation of what the terms cause and effect really mean, or to define the events to which they refer. However, it does seem evident that dropping a cup of water is a cause while the cup subsequently shattering and spilling the water is the effect. Physically speaking, the perception of cause and effect in the dropped cup example is a phenomenon of the thermodynamic arrow of time, a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics.Physical Origins of Time Asymmetry, chapter 6 Controlling the future, or causing something to happen, creates correlations between the doer and the effect,Physical Origins of Time Asymmetry, pp. 109‚Äì111. and these can only be created as we move forwards in time, not backwards. = Particle physics (weak) arrow of time = Certain subatomic interactions involving the weak nuclear force violate the conservation of both parity and charge conjugation, but only very rarely. An example is the kaon decay. According to the CPT theorem, this means they should also be time irreversible, and so establish an arrow of time. Such processes should be responsible for matter creation in the early universe. That the combination of parity and charge conjugation is broken so rarely means that this arrow only \\"barely\\" points in one direction, setting it apart from the other arrows whose direction is much more obvious. This arrow had not been linked to any large scale temporal behaviour until the work of Joan Vaccaro, who showed that T violation could be responsible for conservation laws and dynamics. = Quantum arrow of time = Quantum evolution is governed by equations of motions that are time-symmetric (such as Schr√∂dinger equation in the non-relativistic approximation), and by wave function collapse, which is a time irreversible process, and is either real (by the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics) or apparent only (by the Many-worlds interpretation and Relational quantum mechanics interpretation). The theory of Quantum decoherence explains why wave function collapse happens in a time- asymmetric fashion due to the second law of thermodynamics, thus deriving the quantum arrow of time from the thermodynamic arrow of time. In essence, following any particle scattering or interaction between two larger systems, the relative phases of the two systems are at first orderly related, but subsequent interactions (with additional particles or systems) make them less so, so that the two systems become decoherent. Thus decoherence is a form of increase in microscopic disorder - in short, decoherence increases entropy. Two decoherent systems can no longer interact via quantum superposition, unless they become coherent again, which is normally impossible, by the second law of thermodynamics.Schlosshauer, M. (2005). Decoherence, the measurement problem, and interpretations of quantum mechanics. Reviews of Modern physics, 76(4), 1267. In the language of relational quantum mechanics, the observer becomes entangled with the measured state, where this entanglement increases entropy. As stated by Seth Lloyd, \\"the arrow of time is an arrow of increasing correlations.\\" However, under special circumstances, one can prepare initial conditions that will cause a decrease in decoherence and in entropy. This has been shown experimentally in 2019, when a team of Russian scientists reported the reversal of the quantum arrow of time on an IBM quantum computer, in an experiment supporting the understanding of the quantum arrow of time as emerging from the thermodynamic one. By observing the state of the quantum computer made of two and later three superconducting qubits, they found that in 85% of the cases, the two-qubit computer returned into the initial state. The state's reversal was made by a special program, similarly to the random microwave background fluctuation in the case of the electron. However, according to the estimations, throughout the age of the universe (13.7 billion years) such a reversal of the electron's state would only happen once, for 0.06 nanoseconds. The scientists' experiment led to the possibility of a quantum algorithm that reverses a given quantum state through complex conjugation. Note that quantum decoherence merely allows the process of quantum wave collapse; it is a matter of dispute whether the collapse itself actually takes place or is redundant and apparent only. However, since the theory of quantum decoherence is now widely accepted and has been supported experimentally, this dispute can no longer be considered as related to the arrow of time question. = Psychological/perceptual arrow of time = A related mental arrow arises because one has the sense that one's perception is a continuous movement from the known past to the unknown future. This phenomenon has two aspects: Memory - we remember the past and not the future; and volition - we feel we can influence the future but not the past. The two aspects are a consequence of the causal arrow of time: past events (but not future events) are the cause of our present memories, as more and more correlations are formed between the outer world and our brain (see correlations and the arrow of time); and our present volitions and actions are causes of future events. Past and future are also psychologically associated with additional notions. English, along with other languages, tends to associate the past with \\"behind\\" and the future with \\"ahead\\", with expressions such as \\"to look forward to welcoming you\\", \\"to look back to the good old times\\", or \\"to be years ahead\\". However, this association of \\"behind ‚áî past\\" and \\"ahead ‚áî future\\" is culturally determined. For example, the Aymara language associates \\"ahead ‚áî past\\" and \\"behind ‚áî future\\" both in terms of terminology and gestures, corresponding to the past being observed and the future being unobserved.For Andes tribe, it's back to the future ‚Äî accessed 2006-09-26 Similarly, the Chinese term for \\"the day after tomorrow\\" ÂæåÂ§© (\\"h√≤utiƒÅn\\") literally means \\"after (or behind) day\\", whereas \\"the day before yesterday\\" ÂâçÂ§© (\\"qi√°ntiƒÅn\\") is literally \\"preceding (or in front) day\\", and Chinese speakers spontaneously gesture in front for the past and behind for the future, although there are conflicting findings on whether they perceive the ego to be in front of or behind the past.mbdg.net Chinese-English Dictionary ‚Äî accessed 2017-01-11 There are no languages that place the past and future on a left‚Äìright axis (e.g., there is no expression in English such as *the meeting was moved to the left), although at least English speakers associate the past with the left and the future with the right.

It originated as the short story \\"Wang's Carpets\\" which originally appeared in the Greg Bear-edited anthology New Legends (Legend, London, 1995). The story appears as a chapter of the novel. Setting and premise An appended glossary explains many of the specialist terms in the novel. Egan invents several new theories of physics, beginning with Kozuch Theory, the dominant physics paradigm for nearly nine hundred years before the beginning of the novel. Kozuch Theory treats elementary particles as semi-point-like wormholes, whose properties can be explained entirely in terms of their geometries in six dimensions. Certain assumptions common to Egan's works inform the plot. This novel's setting is a posthuman future, in which transhumanism long ago (during the mid 21st century) became the default philosophy embraced by the vast majority of human cultures. Most of the characters choose a neutral gender; Keri Hulme's gender- neutral pronouns \\"ve\\", \\"vis\\", and \\"ver\\" are used for them. By 2975 CE (Universal Time), the year in which the novel begins, humanity has \\"speciated\\" into three distinct groupings: * fleshers, biological societies consisting of statics, the original, naturally-evolving race of Homo sapiens, and a wide variety of exuberant derivatives, who have modified their genes beyond the static baseline. These include enhancements such as disease-resistance, life- extension, intelligence-amplification, and the ability to allow selected transhumans to thrive in new environments, such as the sea. There even exists a subculture (the dream apes) whose ancestors bred out the capacity for speech and some of the higher brain-functions, apparently in order to attain a primal innocence and rapport with nature. In contrast to 21st-century society prior to the novel's \\"Introdus\\" event, the vast profusion of qualitatively different types of fleshers has made any sort of global civilisation impossible. This divergence has prompted the development of a culture of \\"Bridgers\\" who modify their own minds to form a chain of intermediates between exuberant strains. * gleisner robots, individual software-based intelligences housed inside artificial anthropoid, or flesher-shaped, physical bodies (from a design by a corporation named GleisnerEgan's short story \\"Transition Dreams\\" in the collection Luminous mentions the corporation) who interact with the world in flesher-paced \\"real time\\", a trait which they regard as important, as they consider the polis citizens too remote and solipsistic. The gleisners live in space, mostly in the asteroid belt, and in various other places in the Solar System; Egan implies that they long ago agreed to leave Earth to the fleshers to avoid conflict. They eventually implement a program of interstellar exploration using a fleet of 63 ships, targeting the nearest 21 stars. * the citizens, intelligence as disembodied computer software running entirely within simulated reality-based communities known as polises.Polis in Greek means \\"city/state\\". These represent the majority by far of \\"humanity\\" in the novel, followed in a distant second place by the gleisners. Together with vast networks of sensors, probes, drones and satellites throughout the Solar system, they collectively make up the Coalition of Polises, the backbone and bulk of human civilisation. They interact primarily in virtual environments called scapes, through the use of avatars or icons. The citizens of the Coalition view the gleisners and their colonial aspirations as puerile and ultimately futile, believing that only \\"bacteria with spaceships. . . knowing no better and having no choice\\" would attempt to deface the galaxy with mass colonisation, especially if virtual realities afford limitless possibilities at a small fraction of the total resource-consumption. Diaspora focuses in large part on the nature of life and intelligence in a post-human context, and questions the meaning of life and the meaning of desires. If, for instance, the meaning of human life and human desires is bound up with ancestral human biology (\\"to spread one's genes\\"), then what meaning do lives and desires have, and what serves as the basis of values when biology no longer forms a part of life? Plot summary Diaspora begins with a description of \\"orphanogenesis\\", the birthing of a citizen without any ancestors (the majority of citizens descend from fleshers uploaded at some point), and the subsequent upbringing of the newborn Yatima within Konishi polis. Yatima matures within a few real-time days, because citizens' subjective time runs about 800 times as rapidly as flesher and gleisner time. Early on, Yatima and a friend, Inoshiro, use abandoned gleisner bodies to visit a Bridger colony near the ruins of Atlanta on Earth. Years later, the gleisner Karpal, using a gravitational-wave detector, determines that a binary neutron star system in the constellation of Lacerta has collapsed, releasing a huge burst of energy. Previous predictions portrayed the system's stable orbit as likely to last for another seven million years. By analysing irregularities in the orbit, Karpal discovers that the devastating burst of energy will reach Earth within the next four days. Yatima and Inoshiro return to Earth to urge the fleshers‚Äîgathered in a conference‚Äîeither to migrate to the polises or at least to shelter themselves. Many fleshers reject this advice, or fail fully to appreciate its urgency quickly enough. Stirred up by a paranoid Static diplomat, many fleshers suspect that Yatima and Inoshiro have come to trick or coerce them into \\"Introdus\\", or mass-migration into the polises, involving masses of virus-sized nanomachines that dismantle a human body and record the brain's information states as it is chemically converted into a crystalline computer. The gamma ray burst reaches Earth shortly after the conference, destroying the atmosphere and causing a mass extinction. The gleisners and the Coalition of Polises survive the burst, thanks to cosmic radiation hardening. Over the next few years, Yatima and other citizens and gleisners attempt to rescue any surviving fleshers from slow suffocation, starvation, or poisoning by offering to upload them into the polises. The novel's title itself refers to a quest undertaken by most of the inhabitants of Carter-Zimmerman (\\"C-Z\\"), a polis devoted to physics and understanding the cosmos, along with volunteers from throughout the Coalition of Polises. The Diaspora consists of a collection of one thousand clones (physical copies of the polis hardware) of C-Z polis, deployed toward stars in all directions in the hope of gathering as much data as possible in order to revise the long-held classical understanding of Kozuch Theory, which had failed to predict the Lacerta event. The bulk of the novel follows this expedition, rotating back and forth between different cloned instances of the same cast of main characters as different C-Z clones make discoveries along the way, relaying information to one another over hundreds of light years‚Äîand finally between universes. Characters * YatimaThe word yatima in Swahili means \\"orphan\\"; see appears as an Orphan, a being formed by the Konishi polis conceptory rather than by a parent or parents. A central character in the novel, ve usually takes the iconic form of an African herdsman in a purple robe. Yatima exhibits a deep love of mathematics and a desire to explore the unknown. * Blanca, who habitually uses the icon of a featureless black silhouette, also inhabits the Konishi polis. One of the first three people that Yatima meets and a physicist and scape- architect, Blanca has a reputation as an acknowledged expert on Kozuch Theory throughout the Coalition of Polises. * Inoshiro, another of Yatima's earliest friends, uses an icon featuring metallic, pewter-grey skin. A native of Konishi but a frequenter of Ashton-Laval, a polis of great artistic merit, ve proudly considers verself delinquent. Inoshiro frequently attempts to attract Yatima away from philosophical Konishi and into more aesthetic and avant-garde pursuits. Inoshiro originates the idea of visiting the fleshers of Atlanta in ancient gleisner bodies. * Gabriel, Yatima's third early friend, has an icon covered in short, golden-brown fur. Gabriel, Blanca's lover and another great physicist, differs from most polis citizens in having chosen for himself a specific (though non-functional) gender, a trait considered eccentric and perhaps perverted by many citizens of the Coalition. * Karpal, a gleisner astronomer who lives on the surface of the Moon, first discovers the collapse of Lac G-1 in Lacerta. He later leaves his robotic body and gleisner society to transmigrate to the Carter-Zimmerman polis, seeking a more profound understanding of physics, unavailable to creatures whose minds remain programmed to think of things in terms of their bodies. * Orlando Venetti, originally a leader of the Bridger colony of Atlanta; he and his mate Liana Zabini first welcome Inoshiro and Yatima upon their arrival in gleisner form. In the Lacerta Event, Liana dies but the visitors from Konishi rescue Orlando and bring him into the polis; he joins the Diaspora, and thanks to his Bridger training he makes the first interactive contact with an alien intelligence. Before joining the Diaspora he creates a son, Paolo, who ultimately joins Yatima in exploring higher-dimensional spacetime on the trail of the \\"Transmuters\\". * Radiya is Yatima's first mentor in abstract mathematics and in exploration of the \\"Truth Mines\\", Konishi‚Äôs metaphoric representation of the world of mathematical theorems. Vis icon is a fleshless skeleton made of twigs and branches, with a skull carved from a knotted stump. * Hermann, an extremely eccentric member of the Diaspora, often appears as a segmented worm with six flesher-shaped feet attached to elbow-jointed legs, based on the curl-up from the work of M. C. Escher. Very old (a member of the original 21st-century Introdus), Hermann describes verself as vis own great-great- grandchild because ve has reinvented vis own personality so many times during vis long life. * The Star Puppies, a group of Carter-Zimmerman citizens, elect to stay conscious, in real time, for the duration of their spaceflight in the Diaspora (most others enter a state of suspension). The Puppies take the form of space-evolved creatures dwelling in a scape representing the hull of the spacecraft, employing personality outlooks (software which accentuates specific moods & values) to ensure they feel constant joy in, and at, the universe around them and retain their sanity. The polises Humanity began transferring itself into the polises (the Introdus) in the late 21st century UT, when the technology became feasible to effect the nanoscale transmutation of human brains into functionally indistinguishable molecular computer systems. Many polises exist, though the novel mentions only a few. Though their physical infrastructure is not described, they apparently exist as hardware-based supercomputers of varying size (one of the full C-Z polis clones is briefly mentioned as roughly ten centimeters long) and unknown computational ability, all probably hidden in safe places. Konishi polis, at least, lies buried deep beneath the Siberian tundra, and is multiply backed up throughout the solar system. Each polis has its own unique character, encapsulated in a \\"charter\\" which defines its goals, philosophies, and attitudes to other polises and to the external world. Citizens are expected to heed the charter of the polis they \\"live\\" in; should they begin to disagree with the charter, they can always migrate to a polis which appears more amenable to them. The most prominent differences between the various polises, at least in the novel, involves their attitudes toward the physical world. Polis societies range from those who wish to experience the real world of normal time and space to the wholly solipsistic who live their entire lives in esoteric, isolated virtuality. The citizens of Konishi polis seem to concern themselves mostly with abstract mathematics and esoteric philosophical pursuits, and generally show little interest in the physical world. They use visual icons for social purposes, but regard simulated physical interaction as a violation of individual autonomy. After the Lacerta Event, Yatima emigrates from Konishi to Carter-Zimmerman polis, which rejects the solipsism exemplified by Konishi and embraces the study of the physical universe as of paramount importance. Given the Lacerta Event, which suggests that the universe has the capability of unleashing unknown extreme dangers, Yatima has begun to share this viewpoint. Polis time, delta, and perception For internal dating and time standards the polises use CST (Coalition Standard Time), measured in tau elapsed since the adoption of the system on January 1, 2065 (UT). The novel begins at CST date 23 387 025 000 000. CST defines one tau as the amount of time in which a polis citizen can experience the passage of one second of subjective time; this elastic value changes with improvements in polis hardware. In the period of the novel a polis citizen's mind can operate at a maximum speed of about eight hundred times that of a flesher's mind, so 1 tau equals approximately 1/800 s. By the beginning of the novel, the Coalition of Polises has had just over 741,597 years of recorded history, amounting to 910 years of flesher history; almost all of the Coalition's history, about 98.3% of it, has occurred (from the flesher's perspective) within the very recent past, since the last major Coalition-wide polis hardware upgrade in UT 2750. Nothing compels citizens to experience time at such a high rate; they can equally choose to \\"rush\\", meaning to experience consciousness at a speed slower than the maximum the polis hardware can maintain. Citizens could therefore experience consciousness at the same speed as a human flesher would, or slower, or even freeze their conscious state for a set time or until a previously determined event occurs. Citizens in Lokhande Polis have opted to experience consciousness so slowly that they can witness continental drift and geological erosion. The polises measure distance, an arbitrary value within their virtual scapes, in \\"delta\\", which Egan does not fully explain, although the glossary indicates that citizens' icons are generally about 2 delta high, implying that one delta represents (roughly) one meter. Delta may also be fractionalised, and there is no largest or smallest distance as defined in delta. Almost all polis citizens, except for those who specifically elect otherwise, experience the world through two sensory modalities: Linear and Gestalt, which Egan describes as distant descendants of hearing and seeing, respectively. Linear conveys information quantitatively, as a string or strings of information formulated with a language hardwired into the mind of almost all Citizens. Citizens may \\"speak\\" to one another in Linear by sending streams of data back and forth, from mind to mind ‚Äî either private conversations carried on between a specific subset of intended participants, or public announcements accessible to all involved in a conversation or otherwise \\"listening in\\". Gestalt conveys information qualitatively, and data sent or received about anything arrives all at once for interpretation by the mind of the Citizen in all its aspects simultaneously, resulting in an experience of immediacy. A citizen need not consciously consider the information sent (as in Linear): Gestalt operates rather entirely or almost entirely subconsciously. Citizens use Gestalt to create icons for themselves ‚Äî \\"visual\\" representations within Scapes (Gestalt \\"areas\\" or \\"spaces\\"). Citizens also use Gestalt to convey Tags: packages of information described as like an odour or essence, which any other Citizens within a range of several delta (or who happen to \\"read\\" for specific Tags) can gather. Each Citizen has a unique Tag which identifies them as a particular person, regardless of their other appearances, and citizens may emit Tags for other purposes as well, as when Citizens need to convey and understand arbitrary information instantly. Early in the novel, for instance, Yatima learns about an asteroid in the real world by reading its tags subconsciously, which precisely inform ver about its properties such as mass, velocity, rotation, composition, emission spectra, and other such data discernible to the Coalition's satellite network. Later on Earth, however, when ve and Inoshiro inhabit derelict Gleisner bodies, Yatima must remind verself that Fleshers are real people, even though they lack tags identifying themselves as such.

Beauxb√¢tons (from French - \\"beautiful wands\\") is a French magic school in the fictional universe of Harry Potter created by the English writer J. K. Rowling.  Description  In the fourth book of the series, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, students from Beauxb√¢tons arrive at Hogwarts to take part in the Triwizard Tournament. They arrive in a carriage, brought by winged Palomino horses. Beauxb√¢tons is described as a boarding school located in the Pyrenees mountains of southern France full of ice sculptures and forest nymphs. The delegation is led by headmistress Madame Olympe Maxime, a half-giantess; despite her proportions, she is beautiful, graceful, and well-dressed. Also singled out is Fleur Delacour, the Beauxb√¢tons champion in the Triwizard Tournament, a beautiful girl with silvery hair who is a quarter-veela.  Students  Students of Beauxb√¢tons are described rather stereotypically, mainly as beautiful long-haired girls and attractive boys, in contrast with the serious and surly students from the Eastern European school Durmstrang. They have good manners and in general are positive, while the unpleasant appearance of Durmstrang students implies their dishonesty. Similarly, the carriage of the Beauxb√¢tons is well-lit and nice, while the ship, by which the students of Durmstrang arrive, is gloomy. They speak French and stereotypical, heavily accented English. Jean-Fran√ßois M√©nard, the translator of Harry Potter into French, wrote Madame Maxime as arrogant with very correct, aristocratic speech, while Fleur's tone was more distrustful. M√©nard made these choices because \\"you cannot write French with a French accent\\". In the screen adaptation Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Beauxb√¢tons students are all female and Durmstrang students are all male, in contrast to the books which portray both schools as co-educational.  Criticism  The portrayal of the two foreign schools has been criticized as stereotypical. On the whole, the students of Beauxb√¢tons, just as the students of Durmstrang, are homogeneous, not showing the cultural diversity of Hogwarts. The contrast between Durmstrang and Hogwarts can be interpreted as an allusion to the war of the West with the bad from the East, as described in the gothic fiction of the fourteenth century, and contrast between Beauxb√¢tons and Hogwarts as an allusion to the competition between the reasonable and decent Great Britain and the licentious and decadent France. It has been argued that the appearance on the foreground of these old conflicts allows J K. Rowling to sublimate them, and to make them irrelevant to modern readers.

The book derives its name from Schild's ladder, a construction in differential geometry, devised by the mathematician and physicist Alfred Schild. Plot summary Twenty-thousand years in the future, Cass, a humanoid physicist from Earth, travels to an orbital station in the vicinity of the star Mimosa, and begins a series of experiments to test the extremities of the fictitious Sarumpaet rules - a set of fundamental equations in \\"Quantum Graph Theory,\\" which holds that physical existence is a manifestation of complex constructions of mathematical graphs. However, the experiments unexpectedly create a bubble of something more stable than ordinary vacuum, dubbed novo- vacuum, that expands outward at half the speed of light as ordinary vacuum collapses to this new state at the border, hinting at more general laws beyond the Sarumpaet rules. The local population is forced to flee to ever more distant star systems to escape the steadily approaching border, but since the expansion never slows, it is just a matter of time before the novo-vacuum encompasses any given region within the Local Group (and ultimately the whole universe). Two factions develop as the expanding bubble swallows star after star: the Preservationists, who wish to stop the expansion and preserve the Milky Way at any cost; and the Yielders, who consider the novo-vacuum to be too important a discovery to destroy without understanding. Six hundred years after the initial experiment, a vessel called the Rindler has matched velocities with an ever-expanding novo-vacuum region at the border, powered by multispectral light emitted as the ordinary vacuum collapses into its lower energy-state. A variety of refugees are probing the novo-vacuum in order to understand the physics that makes it possible. The novo-vacuum turns out to be more complicated than anyone suspects, however, and Egan's usual topics of simulation and quantum ontology are taken to the extreme when we learn that a whole ordered universe exists within this zone of apparent chaos, existing as direct elaborations of the quantum graph's lattice structure, of which elementary particles, fundamental interactions, and our spacetime itself are only special cases. It is ultimately revealed that the novo-vacuum's exotic geometry contains living organisms and even civilizations. This ecosystem is based on \\"vendeks,\\" microbe-like complexes of quantum graph structures only 10‚àí33 meters across. Agglomerations of vendeks form \\"xennobes,\\" analogous to multicellular organisms but only 10‚àí27 meters across. This discovery greatly increases the importance of the Yielders' mission, since destroying the novo- vacuum would be tantamount to genocide.

Diving became a family business: he lost his son and daughter-in-law when their boat capsized and sank in 1975. Personal life Fisher was an Indiana- born former chicken farmer who eventually moved to California and opened the first diving shop in the state. He attended Purdue University and was a member of the Delta Chi (ŒîŒß) Fraternity. In 1953, he married Dolores (Deo) Horton who became his business partner. She was one of the first women to learn how to dive and set a women's record by staying underwater for 50 hours. Mel and Deo had five children: sons Terry, Dirk, Kim and Kane, and daughter Taffi. On July 20, 1975 Mel's oldest son Dirk, his wife Angel, and diver Rick Gage died after their boat sank due to bilge pump failure during their quest for treasure.3 Drown on Mission to Salvage $100 ‚ÄêMillion in Sunken Treasure. nytimes.com JULY 21, 1975 (Retrieved on May 22, 2017) Mel struggled through decades of hard times treasure hunting in the Florida Keys with the motto Today's the Day.

Only days later, Dirk, Angel, and Rick Gage, were killed. The estimated $450 million cache recovered, known as \\"The Atocha Motherlode,\\" included 40 tons of gold and silver; there were some 114,000 of the Spanish silver coins known as \\"pieces of eight\\", gold coins, Colombian emeralds, gold and silver artifacts, and 1000 silver ingots. Large as it was, this was only roughly half of the treasure that went down with the Atocha. The stern castle of the ship holding more gold and Muso emeralds has not been found as of August 2017. Also still missing are 300 silver bars and 8 bronze cannons, among other things. The Mel Fisher Maritime Heritage Museum Key West, Florida The site of the wreckage of the Atocha, called \\"The Bank of Spain\\" (a sandy area 22 feet deep and within 200 yards of the anchor location), is still being worked on and treasures are slowly being recovered. The emeralds from the Atocha are some of the finest emeralds in the world. They come from the Muzo Mine in Colombia. The emeralds of Muzo are renowned for their color, fire, geometry, and as the world‚Äôs finest emeralds. The State of Florida claimed title to the wreck and forced Fisher's company, Treasure Salvors, Inc., into a contract giving 25% of the found treasure to the state. Fisher's company fought the state, claiming the find should be the company's exclusively. After eight years of litigation, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favour of Treasure Salvors and it was awarded rights to all found treasure from the vessel on 1 July 1982. Other finds Fisher and Treasure Salvors found remains of several other shipwrecks in Florida waters, including the Atocha's sister galleon the Santa Margarita, lost in the same year, and the remains of a slave ship known as the Henrietta Marie, lost in 1700. Mel Fisher's company, Mel Fisher's Treasures, sold the rights to the 1715 Treasure Fleet shipwreck to Queens Jewels, LLC. Legacy Fisher hired Duncan Matthewson as chief archaeologist during the Atocha period, and Treasure Salvors, Inc.'s employees became experts in recovery and conservation of underwater artifacts. Fisher agreed to sell Treasure Salvors in 1986 and it remained active as of 2009. Fisher's business continued as Mel Fisher's Treasures. Fisher blended private and public interests when it came to underwater cultural resources. Concern in the U.S., and Florida specifically, for protection of submerged archaeological sites contributed to the 2001 adoption of the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage.

It is the primary station serving commuter trains (Cercan√≠as), regional trains from the south and southeast, intercity trains from Navarre, C√°diz and Huelva (Andalusia) and La Rioja, and the AVE high speed trains from Girona, Tarragona and Barcelona (Catalonia), Huesca and Zaragoza (Aragon), Sevilla, C√≥rdoba and M√°laga (Andalusia), Valencia, Castell√≥n and Alicante (Levante Region). These train services are run by the Spanish national rail company, Renfe. As of 2019, this station has daily services to Marseille in France. Overview The station is in the Atocha neighborhood of the district of Arganzuela. The original fa√ßade faces Plaza del Emperador Carlos V, a site at which a variety of streets converge, including the Calle de Atocha, Paseo del Prado, Paseo de la Infanta Isabel, Avenida de la Ciudad de Barcelona, Calle de M√©ndez √Ålvaro, Paseo de las Delicias, Paseo de Santa Mar√≠a de la Cabeza, and Ronda de Atocha. Atocha station is a railway complex, formed by the Madrid Atocha Cercan√≠as and Madrid Puerta de Atocha stations of the Spanish national railways and a station of the Madrid underground called Atocha-Renfe. Renfe is the state-owned company which operates freight and passenger trains since 1941. History Exterior of old Atocha station Interior plaza in old Atocha station At this site, Madrid's first railway station was inaugurated on 9 February 1851 under the name Estaci√≥n de Mediod√≠a (Atocha-Mediod√≠a is now the name of an area of the Arganzuela district, and means south in old Spanish). After the building was largely destroyed by fire, it was rebuilt by the MZA railway company and reopened in 1892. The architect for the replacement, in a wrought iron renewal style was Alberto de Palacio Elissagne, who collaborated with Gustave Eiffel. Engineer Henry Saint James also took part in the project. The name Atocha has become attached to the station because of the nearby basilica dedicated to Our Lady of Atocha. The train platforms were partly covered by a roof in the form of inverted hull with a height of approximately 27 meters and length of 157 meters. The steel and glass roof spreads between two brick flanking buildings. This complex of railway tracks expanded through the years. In 1985, a project of complete remodeling began, based on designs by Rafael Moneo. In 1992, the original building was taken out of service as a terminal, and converted into a concourse with shops, caf√©s, and a nightclub. Like the Orsay Museum in Paris, the concourse has been given a new function, that being in the case of Atocha a stunning covered tropical garden. A modern terminal was also designed by Moneo, and built in adjacent land to serve both the new High Speed trains, regional and local commuter lines. The main lines end in the new terminal; regional and commuter train platforms are located underground, at the ingress to a rail tunnel extending northward under the Paseo de la Castellana. The station is served by two Madrid Metro stations, Estaci√≥n del Arte (located nearby Museo Reina Sof√≠a) and the Atocha Renfe metro station. The latter was added when the new terminal building was constructed and is directly linked to the railway station, providing access to Line 1. A connection to Line 11 will be constructed in the first half of the 2020s. 2004 Madrid train bombings On 11 March 2004, packed arriving commuter trains were bombed in a series of coordinated attacks, killing 191 people and wounding 1,800. The official investigation by the Spanish Judiciary determined the attacks were directed by a terrorist cell. Memorials to the 2004 attack Interior of the Atocha station memorial On 10 June 2004, a somber and minimalist Atocha station memorial was dedicated to the victims of the attack. The monument includes a virtual shrine. Visitors to the attacked stations can leave a hand silhouette and a message through special-purpose consoles. A second monument to this event, known as 11-M in Spain, is the ' (Forest of Remembrance) in the Parque del Buen Retiro near Atocha. This monument is made up of 192 olive and cypress trees, one for each person who died on that day, with a tree also planted in remembrance of the police officer who died on 3 April 2004, along with seven of the perpetrators whose capture was underway. Initially inaugurated as the ' (Forest of the Departed) the site was renamed on the first anniversary of the devastating attack. The forest is surrounded by a stream, with water as a symbol of life.

The synthetic approach gives a list of axioms for the real numbers as a complete ordered field. Under the usual axioms of set theory, one can show that these axioms are categorical, in the sense that there is a model for the axioms, and any two such models are isomorphic. Any one of these models must be explicitly constructed, and most of these models are built using the basic properties of the rational number system as an ordered field. Synthetic approach The synthetic approach axiomatically defines the real number system as a complete ordered field. Precisely, this means the following. A model for the real number system consists of a set R, two distinct elements 0 and 1 of R, two binary operations + and √ó on R (called addition and multiplication, respectively), and a binary relation ‚â§ on R, satisfying the following properties. = Axioms = # (R, +, √ó) forms a field. In other words, #* For all x, y, and z in R, x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z and x √ó (y √ó z) = (x √ó y) √ó z. (associativity of addition and multiplication) #* For all x and y in R, x + y = y + x and x √ó y = y √ó x. (commutativity of addition and multiplication) #* For all x, y, and z in R, x √ó (y + z) = (x √ó y) + (x √ó z). (distributivity of multiplication over addition) #* For all x in R, x + 0 = x. (existence of additive identity) #* 0 is not equal to 1, and for all x in R, x √ó 1 = x. (existence of multiplicative identity) #* For every x in R, there exists an element ‚àíx in R, such that x + (‚àíx) = 0. (existence of additive inverses) #* For every x ‚â† 0 in R, there exists an element x‚àí1 in R, such that x √ó x‚àí1 = 1. (existence of multiplicative inverses) # (R, ‚â§) forms a totally ordered set. In other words, #* For all x in R, x ‚â§ x. (reflexivity) #* For all x and y in R, if x ‚â§ y and y ‚â§ x, then x = y. (antisymmetry) #* For all x, y, and z in R, if x ‚â§ y and y ‚â§ z, then x ‚â§ z. (transitivity) #* For all x and y in R, x ‚â§ y or y ‚â§ x. (totality) # The field operations + and √ó on R are compatible with the order ‚â§. In other words, #* For all x, y and z in R, if x ‚â§ y, then x + z ‚â§ y + z. (preservation of order under addition) #* For all x and y in R, if 0 ‚â§ x and 0 ‚â§ y, then 0 ‚â§ x √ó y (preservation of order under multiplication) # The order ‚â§ is complete in the following sense: every non-empty subset of R bounded above has a least upper bound. In other words, #* If A is a non-empty subset of R, and if A has an upper bound, then A has a least upper bound u, such that for every upper bound v of A, u ‚â§ v.  On the least upper bound property  Axiom 4, which requires the order to be Dedekind-complete, implies the Archimedean property. The axiom is crucial in the characterization of the reals. For example, the totally ordered field of the rational numbers Q satisfy the first three axioms, but not the fourth. In other words, models of the rational numbers are also models of the first three axioms. Note that the axiom is not firstorderizable, as it expresses a statement about collections of reals and not just individual such numbers. As such, the reals are not given by a first-order logic theory.  On models  Several models for axioms 1-4 are given down below. Any two models for axioms 1-4 are isomorphic, and so up to isomorphism, there is only one complete ordered Archimedean field. When we say that any two models of the above axioms are isomorphic, we mean that for any two models (R, 0R, 1R, +R, √óR, ‚â§R) and (S, 0S, 1S, +S, √óS, ‚â§S), there is a bijection f : R ‚Üí S preserving both the field operations and the order. Explicitly, *f is both injective and surjective. *f(0R) = 0S and f(1R) = 1S. *For all x and y in R, f(x +R y) = f(x) +S f(y) and f(x √óR y) = f(x) √óS f(y). *For all x and y in R, x ‚â§R y if and only if f(x) ‚â§S f(y). =Tarski's axiomatization of the reals= An alternative synthetic axiomatization of the real numbers and their arithmetic was given by Alfred Tarski, consisting of only the 8 axioms shown below and a mere four primitive notions: a set called the real numbers, denoted R, a binary relation over R called order, denoted by infix <, a binary operation over R called addition, denoted by infix +, and the constant 1. Axioms of order (primitives: R, <): Axiom 1. If x < y, then not y < x. That is, \\"<\\" is an asymmetric relation. Axiom 2. If x < z, there exists a y such that x < y and y < z. In other words, \\"<\\" is dense in R. Axiom 3. \\"<\\" is Dedekind- complete. More formally, for all X, Y ‚äÜ R, if for all x ‚àà X and y ‚àà Y, x < y, then there exists a z such that for all x ‚àà X and y ‚àà Y, if z ‚â† x and z ‚â† y, then x < z and z < y. To clarify the above statement somewhat, let X ‚äÜ R and Y ‚äÜ R. We now define two common English verbs in a particular way that suits our purpose: :X precedes Y if and only if for every x ‚àà X and every y ‚àà Y, x < y. :The real number z separates X and Y if and only if for every x ‚àà X with x ‚â† z and every y ‚àà Y with y ‚â† z, x < z and z < y. Axiom 3 can then be stated as: :\\"If a set of reals precedes another set of reals, then there exists at least one real number separating the two sets.\\" Axioms of addition (primitives: R, <, +): Axiom 4. x + (y + z) = (x + z) + y. Axiom 5. For all x, y, there exists a z such that x + z = y. Axiom 6. If x + y < z + w, then x < z or y < w. Axioms for one (primitives: R, <, +, 1): Axiom 7. 1 ‚àà R. Axiom 8. 1 < 1 + 1\\\\. These axioms imply that R is a linearly ordered abelian group under addition with distinguished element 1. R is also Dedekind-complete and divisible. Explicit constructions of models We shall not prove that any models of the axioms are isomorphic. Such a proof can be found in any number of modern analysis or set theory textbooks. We will sketch the basic definitions and properties of a number of constructions, however, because each of these is important for both mathematical and historical reasons. The first three, due to Georg Cantor/Charles M√©ray, Richard Dedekind/Joseph Bertrand and Karl Weierstrass all occurred within a few years of each other. Each has advantages and disadvantages. A major motivation in all three cases was the instruction of mathematics students. =Construction from Cauchy sequences= A standard procedure to force all Cauchy sequences in a metric space to converge is adding new points to the metric space in a process called completion. R is defined as the completion of Q with respect to the metric x-y, as will be detailed below (for completions of Q with respect to other metrics, see p-adic numbers.) Let R be the set of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers. That is, sequences : x1, x2, x3,... of rational numbers such that for every rational , there exists an integer N such that for all natural numbers , . Here the vertical bars denote the absolute value. Cauchy sequences (xn) and (yn) can be added and multiplied as follows: : (xn) + (yn) = (xn \\\\+ yn) : (xn) √ó (yn) = (xn √ó yn). Two Cauchy sequences are called equivalent if and only if the difference between them tends to zero. This defines an equivalence relation that is compatible with the operations defined above, and the set R of all equivalence classes can be shown to satisfy all axioms of the real numbers. We can embed Q into R by identifying the rational number r with the equivalence class of the sequence . Comparison between real numbers is obtained by defining the following comparison between Cauchy sequences: if and only if x is equivalent to y or there exists an integer N such that for all . By construction, every real number x is represented by a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers. This representation is far from unique; every rational sequence that converges to x is a representation of x. This reflects the observation that one can often use different sequences to approximate the same real number. The only real number axiom that does not follow easily from the definitions is the completeness of ‚â§, i.e. the least upper bound property. It can be proved as follows: Let S be a non-empty subset of R and U be an upper bound for S. Substituting a larger value if necessary, we may assume U is rational. Since S is non-empty, we can choose a rational number L such that for some s in S. Now define sequences of rationals (un) and (ln) as follows: :Set u0 = U and l0 = L. For each n consider the number: :mn = (un \\\\+ ln)/2 If mn is an upper bound for S set: : un+1 = mn and ln+1 = ln Otherwise set: : ln+1 = mn and un+1 = un This defines two Cauchy sequences of rationals, and so we have real numbers and . It is easy to prove, by induction on n that: : un is an upper bound for S for all n and: : ln is never an upper bound for S for any n Thus u is an upper bound for S. To see that it is a least upper bound, notice that the limit of (un ‚àí ln) is 0, and so l = u. Now suppose is a smaller upper bound for S. Since (ln) is monotonic increasing it is easy to see that for some n. But ln is not an upper bound for S and so neither is b. Hence u is a least upper bound for S and ‚â§ is complete. The usual decimal notation can be translated to Cauchy sequences in a natural way. For example, the notation œÄ = 3.1415... means that œÄ is the equivalence class of the Cauchy sequence (3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415, ...). The equation 0.999... = 1 states that the sequences (0, 0.9, 0.99, 0.999,...) and (1, 1, 1, 1,...) are equivalent, i.e., their difference converges to 0. An advantage of constructing R as the completion of Q is that this construction is not specific to one example; it is used for other metric spaces as well. =Construction by Dedekind cuts= irrational, real numbers. A Dedekind cut in an ordered field is a partition of it, (A, B), such that A is nonempty and closed downwards, B is nonempty and closed upwards, and A contains no greatest element. Real numbers can be constructed as Dedekind cuts of rational numbers. For convenience we may take the lower set A\\\\, as the representative of any given Dedekind cut (A, B)\\\\,, since A completely determines B. By doing this we may think intuitively of a real number as being represented by the set of all smaller rational numbers. In more detail, a real number r is any subset of the set \\\\textbf{Q} of rational numbers that fulfills the following conditions: # r is not empty # r eq \\\\textbf{Q} # r is closed downwards. In other words, for all x, y \\\\in \\\\textbf{Q} such that x < y, if y \\\\in r then x \\\\in r # r contains no greatest element. In other words, there is no x \\\\in r such that for all y \\\\in r, y \\\\leq x * We form the set \\\\textbf{R} of real numbers as the set of all Dedekind cuts A of \\\\textbf{Q} , and define a total ordering on the real numbers as follows: x \\\\leq y\\\\Leftrightarrow x \\\\subseteq y * We embed the rational numbers into the reals by identifying the rational number q with the set of all smaller rational numbers \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in \\\\textbf{Q} : x < q \\\\\\\\} . Since the rational numbers are dense, such a set can have no greatest element and thus fulfills the conditions for being a real number laid out above. * Addition. A + B := \\\\\\\\{a + b: a \\\\in A \\\\land b \\\\in B\\\\\\\\} * Subtraction. A - B := \\\\\\\\{a - b: a \\\\in A \\\\land b \\\\in ( \\\\textbf{Q} \\\\setminus B ) \\\\\\\\} where \\\\textbf{Q} \\\\setminus B denotes the relative complement of B in \\\\textbf{Q}, \\\\\\\\{ x : x \\\\in \\\\textbf{Q} \\\\land x otin B \\\\\\\\} * Negation is a special case of subtraction: -B := \\\\\\\\{a - b: a < 0 \\\\land b \\\\in ( \\\\textbf{Q} \\\\setminus B ) \\\\\\\\} * Defining multiplication is less straightforward. ** if A, B \\\\geq 0 then A \\\\times B := \\\\\\\\{ a \\\\times b : a \\\\geq 0 \\\\land a \\\\in A \\\\land b \\\\geq 0 \\\\land b \\\\in B \\\\\\\\} \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Q} : x < 0 \\\\\\\\} ** if either A\\\\, or B\\\\, is negative, we use the identities A \\\\times B = -(A \\\\times -B) = -(-A \\\\times B) = (-A \\\\times -B) \\\\, to convert A\\\\, and/or B\\\\, to positive numbers and then apply the definition above. * We define division in a similar manner: ** if A \\\\geq 0 \\\\mbox{ and } B > 0 then A / B := \\\\\\\\{ a / b : a \\\\in A \\\\land b \\\\in ( \\\\textbf{Q} \\\\setminus B ) \\\\\\\\} ** if either A\\\\, or B\\\\, is negative, we use the identities A / B = -(A / {-B}) = -(-A / B)= -A / {-B} \\\\, to convert A\\\\, to a non-negative number and/or B\\\\, to a positive number and then apply the definition above. * Supremum. If a nonempty set S of real numbers has any upper bound in \\\\textbf{R}, then it has a least upper bound in \\\\textbf{R} that is equal to \\\\bigcup S. As an example of a Dedekind cut representing an irrational number, we may take the positive square root of 2. This can be defined by the set A = \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in \\\\textbf{Q} : x < 0 \\\\lor x \\\\times x < 2 \\\\\\\\}. It can be seen from the definitions above that A is a real number, and that A \\\\times A = 2\\\\,. However, neither claim is immediate. Showing that A\\\\, is real requires showing that A has no greatest element, i.e. that for any positive rational x\\\\, with x \\\\times x < 2\\\\,, there is a rational y\\\\, with x and y \\\\times y <2\\\\,. The choice y=\\\\frac{2x+2}{x+2}\\\\, works. Then A \\\\times A \\\\le 2 but to show equality requires showing that if r\\\\, is any rational number with r \\\\times r < 2\\\\,, then there is positive x\\\\, in A with r. An advantage of this construction is that each real number corresponds to a unique cut. =Construction using hyperreal numbers= As in the hyperreal numbers, one constructs the hyperrationals *Q from the rational numbers by means of an ultrafilter. Here a hyperrational is by definition a ratio of two hyperintegers. Consider the ring B of all limited (i.e. finite) elements in *Q. Then B has a unique maximal ideal I, the infinitesimal numbers. The quotient ring B/I gives the field R of real numbers . Note that B is not an internal set in *Q. Note that this construction uses a non-principal ultrafilter over the set of natural numbers, the existence of which is guaranteed by the axiom of choice. It turns out that the maximal ideal respects the order on *Q. Hence the resulting field is an ordered field. Completeness can be proved in a similar way to the construction from the Cauchy sequences. =Construction from surreal numbers= Every ordered field can be embedded in the surreal numbers. The real numbers form a maximal subfield that is Archimedean (meaning that no real number is infinitely large). This embedding is not unique, though it can be chosen in a canonical way. = Construction from integers (Eudoxus reals)= A relatively less known construction allows to define real numbers using only the additive group of integers \\\\mathbb{Z} with different versions. The construction has been formally verified by the IsarMathLib project. Shenitzer and Arthan refer to this construction as the Eudoxus reals, named after an ancient Greek astronomer and mathematician Eudoxus of Cnidus. Let an almost homomorphism be a map f:\\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{Z} such that the set \\\\\\\\{f(n+m)-f(m)-f(n): n,m\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\\\\\} is finite. (Note that f(n) = \\\\lfloor \\\\alpha n\\\\rfloor is an almost homomorphism for every \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} .) Almost homomorphisms form an abelian group under pointwise addition. We say that two almost homomorphisms f,g are almost equal if the set \\\\\\\\{f(n)-g(n): n\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\\\\\} is finite. This defines an equivalence relation on the set of almost homomorphisms. Real numbers are defined as the equivalence classes of this relation. Alternatively, the almost homomorphisms taking only finitely many values form a subgroup, and the underlying additive group of the real number is the quotient group. To add real numbers defined this way we add the almost homomorphisms that represent them. Multiplication of real numbers corresponds to functional composition of almost homomorphisms. If [f] denotes the real number represented by an almost homomorphism f we say that 0\\\\leq [f] if f is bounded or f takes an infinite number of positive values on \\\\mathbb{Z}^+. This defines the linear order relation on the set of real numbers constructed this way. = Other constructions = Faltin et al. write: A number of other constructions have been given, by: * N.

In the Republic of Panama, the Centro de Atencion Ciudadana (3-1-1) is legally responsible for the centralized reception of citizen complaints, requests, suggestions and consultations to government agencies or municipalities. It operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 365 days a year, receiving over a million citizen contacts on an annual basis through its toll-free line, self-service portal, mobile application and social media accounts. Equivalents in other countries =Finland= On a yearly basis, the dispatchers in Finland's 112 service receive some 800,000 non-urgent calls. In order to curb this problem, which ties up precious resources, a committee proposes that Finland launch a new telephone number‚Äî116 115‚Äîfor such calls. Calls to this number would also be free of charge. =Germany= In Germany, 115 is a single access number to communal, regional and federal administrations. =Sweden= Sweden has introduced a system with which less- urgent callers can call 114 14 to get connected to the local police station. Depending on current load and situation, however, the call could potentially be connected to any station in Sweden. Calls to this number are charged according to the same rates as any other national calls.Questions and answers regarding 11414 from the Swedish police =United Kingdom= In all parts of the United Kingdom, the non-emergency number for contacting the police is 101. Usage The cost of city services in Baltimore has been dramatically reduced by the combination of the 3-1-1 service and CitiStat. While Baltimore was the first city to use 311 as a police non-emergency number, in January 1999, Chicago initiated the first comprehensive 3-1-1 system, by providing information and tracking city services from intake to resolution, in addition to taking non-emergency police calls. When the new service was launched, information regarding all city services, service requests, assistance in reaching various city departments and public offices, and a variety of information ranging from information about the city's Blue Bag recycling program to special events schedules could be obtained by calling 3-1-1. This also supplanted the need to remember or find the number (312) 744-5000, which, until then, acted as a switching station for reaching various city departments and employees, as well as Chicago Police non-emergency (dialing this number today directs you to a 3-1-1 center operator from any area code). Since its launch, Chicago 3-1-1 has won numerous national awards, including the Innovations in American Government AwardGovernment Innovators Network: 311 System, 2005-05-18 09:37:55 from the Ash Institute for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government in 2003. In addition to providing seamless delivery of city services to residents, the call center serves as a backup to the City's 911 call center. In Orange County, Florida, in 2004, while the 3-1-1 system was still being piloted, three hurricanes struck Central Florida. The unusual occurrence damaged homes and businesses throughout the Orlando area. The pilot program used a seven-digit number (initially 836-3111) and it was this number that received the demands for post-hurricane services. This experience tested and proved the value of the program and Orange County immediately activated the 3-1-1 number for governmental customer service. In New York City, 3-1-1 is used by city officials as one of several sources of measurement and information about the performance of city services. Important dates in the history of New York's 3-1-1 service include December 20, 2005, when it received its record high of 240,000 calls, due to the first day of the 2005 New York City transit strike, and June 20, 2007, when it received its 50 millionth call. In San Francisco, 3-1-1 is the number for the City and County of San Francisco. As in New York City, it provides information about city services, such as transit information. San Francisco 3-1-1 was implemented in 2007 shortly after the launch of the T Third Street Muni light rail line. However, it has come under substantial criticism of late because the 3-1-1 system charges the financially strapped Muni system $1.96 for every Muni- related phone call. Some have criticized Mayor Gavin Newsom for stealing Muni funds into the 3-1-1 system. In the city of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, 3-1-1 is also used to find lost pets, get answers to questions about taxes, complain about needed roadway maintenance, get information about flood conditions, make non-emergency police reports, and other government services.Charlotte Mecklenburg 311 Brochure, accessed 17 December 2019 13:03 PST The City of Philadelphia implemented its 3-1-1 service in 2008. The Philly311 Contact Center provides information to citizens and places service requests for departments across the city. These requests include but are not limited to: missed rubbish collection, graffiti removal, License & Inspection inquiries, and pothole repairs. Philly311 receives over one million calls each year despite not being in service on a 24/7 basis, as is the case in other cities. In popular culture In the United States, 311 was sometimes used as a fictitious area code in Bell System advertisements depicting telephones; often the phone in the advertisement would bear the specific number Area Code 311 555-2368. This fictitious phone number was used in the 1979 horror film When a Stranger Calls; in the opening of the television series The Rockford Files; in the 1984 film Ghostbusters; and on two episodes of the second season of the TV series Mission: Impossible: episode 22 titled \\"The Killing\\" (on the killer's phone) and, fourth season, episode 12, titled \\"Time Bomb\\" (on a phone at a nuclear plant in a fictitious country). This number is seen on the phone in Mister Ed during shots where the talking horse dials the phone using a pencil in his mouth. It is also seen in the 1968 Mannix episode \\"To Kill a Writer.\\" This number was also used in the 1985 movie Once Bitten: it is on the phone in the dating night club that hangs on the wall behind Jim Carey and Lauren Hutton when they first meet. 311-555-2368 was also used in numerous episodes of The Bionic Woman as the private phone number at Jaime Sommers' coach house. At the end of a 1963 episode of Route 66, titled \\"Kiss the Monster, Make Him Sleep\\", Linc calls his estranged father at a number having area code 311. The number 311-555-9845 was used for a radio station hotline in the first episode of the TV show A.L.F. This area code is also used as fictional the area code for Sunnyvale, California (which is actually located in 408) in the 1983 movie WarGames during the \\"war dialing\\" sequence in which the main character is searching for a video game company's modem pool. 311-555-3305 was used in a 1973 episode of \\"Search\\" Season 1, Episode 20, \\"Moments of Madness\\" as the phone number for the lair of kidnapper Ralph Byron (played by Patrick O'Neal).

She was outfitted as a gunboat and assigned to the Union blockade of the ports and waterways of the Confederate States of America. During an engagement with the disguised Confederate commerce raider, CSS Alabama, she was taken by surprise and was sunk off the coast of Galveston, Texas. The wreck site is one of the few listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its location away from destructive surf and because of the ship's side-wheel design, which marks the transition between wooden sailing ships and steam-powered ships. Hatteras (formerly St. Mary) was purchased by the U. S. Navy from Harlan and Hollingsworth of Wilmington, Delaware on 25 September 1861. She was fitted out at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and commissioned in October 1861, Commander George F. Emmons in command. Civil War service Hatteras sailed for Key West, Florida on 5 November 1861, arriving there on 13 November to join the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron to choke off the South's economic lifeline as part of president Lincoln's Anaconda Plan. After blockade duty off Apalachicola, Florida, she was reassigned to Cedar Key, Florida, reaching there on 7 January 1862. Nine days later, Hatteras made a highly successful raid on the Cedar Keys harbor, burning seven small would-be blockade runners loaded with turpentine and cotton at the Florida Railroad wharf (an important Southern railroad terminus), several flat-cars, and various buildings. To cap this day's work, Hatteras also captured 14 of the 22-man garrison stationed there, including their commanding officer. Such unceasing attack from the sea on any point along her long coastline and inland waterways cost the South dearly in losses, economic disruption, and dispersion of defense strength. After this exploit, Hatteras was transferred to the Gulf Blockading Squadron and arrived off Berwick, Louisiana on 26 January. The next day, she engaged CSS Mobile, but failed to do any serious damage when the light-draft ship withdrew to the safety of shallow water. Nevertheless, the Gulf of Mexico proved to be a profitable hunting ground for Hatteras, as in less than a year, she captured seven blockade runners with assorted cargos of cotton, sugar, and other goods the South was desperately striving to export for gold or much needed trade goods. These captures netted Hatteras, among other things, some 534 bales of valuable cotton. Commander Emmons stationed four of his own men on board one prize ship, the sloop Poody, and rechristened her Hatteras Jr., turning the erstwhile blockade runner into a unit of the Union's Gulf Blockading Squadron. Other Confederate ships taken by Hatteras as prizes included: steamer Indian No. 2, schooner Magnolia, steamer Governor A. Mouton, schooner Sarah, sloop Elizabeth, and brig Josephine. The majority of these ships were captured off Vermilion Bay, Louisiana, as they ran toward either Havana, Cuba, or the Sabine River area of Texas. However, her illustrious career was cut short in early 1863, not long after she was ordered to join the blockading squadron under Rear Admiral David Farragut, who was attempting to retake the key Texas port of Galveston. Under a new skipper, Commander Homer C. Blake, who had relieved Captain Emmons in November 1862, Hatteras joined Farragut's squadron off Galveston on 6 January 1863. =Encounter with the CSS Alabama= As the blockading fleet lay to off the coast near Galveston on the afternoon of 11 January 1863, a set of sails was sighted just over the horizon and Hatteras was ordered to give chase. She took off in pursuit of the unknown ship at about 15:00 (3:00 PM), and for the next four hours followed her as she ventured closer and closer to shore. Finally, as dusk was falling, Hatteras came within hailing distance of the square-rigged ship. Commander Blake demanded her identity. \\"Her Britannic Majaesty's Ship Petrel,\\" came the reply. Still suspicious, Blake ordered one of Hatteras boats to inspect this \\"Britisher.\\" 19th century print, depicting the sinking of Hatteras by CSS Alabama, off Galveston, Texas on 11 January 1863. Scarcely had the longboat pulled away from Hatteras than a new reply to Blake's question rang through the night. \\"We are the CSS Alabama.\\" With this, the famed Confederate raider commanded by Raphael Semmes struck the Union Jack the raider had been flying, raising the Confederate Stars and Bars, and began raking Hatteras with her heavy cannon. Through the gloom, for about 20 minutes, the two ships exchanged heavy fire at distances ranging from . The flashes of the guns and their rumbling were heard in the Union squadron some away, and the cruiser was dispatched to investigate and render aid if needed. But Hatteras had already been badly holed in two places and was on fire and beginning to sink. Captain Blake ordered the magazines flooded to prevent explosion and reluctantly fired a single bow gun, indicating surrender and a need for assistance. Alabama, promptly sent over her boats to help remove Hatteras crew and wounded, and the last boatload of men had barely pulled away when the Union blockader sank, some 45 minutes after the beginning of the action. Of Hatteras crew of 126, two had been killed and five wounded. Six escaped back to the squadron in the boat originally sent out to board and investigate \\"HMS Petrel\\", and the remainder, including Captain Blake, were taken to Port Royal, Jamaica, and from there paroled back to the United States; Alabama suffered only two wounded. When Brooklyn reached the site of the battle early the following morning, she found the hulk of Hatteras upright in the water about south of Galveston Light. Only Hatteras masts reached out of water, and from the topmast the U.S. Navy commissioning pennant was still waving in the breeze. Even after surrendering, she had not struck her colors. Present day The hull of Hatteras rests in approximately of water off of Galveston, Texas and is buried under about of sand. Her steam engine and two iron paddle wheels remain on the ocean bottom. The wreck is monitored to ensure that it is not damaged by oil and gas development in the area. The wreck of Hatteras is the property of the United States Navy, though the Texas Historical Commission, Texas A&M; University at Galveston and the federal Minerals Management Service (now Bureau of Ocean Energy Management) cooperate in preserving the important historical site. At one time, local treasure hunters filed suit claiming the right to salvage the ship, but the courts found in favor of the United States government, in one of the few times courts have ruled in favor of historic preservation of a shipwreck site versus commercial interests. The Alabama Hills are named in honor of the CSS Alabama.

He was also Duke of Urbino during the same period. His daughter Catherine de' Medici became Queen Consort of France, while his illegitimate son, Alessandro de' Medici, became the first Duke of Florence. Early life Lorenzo was born in Florence on 12 September 1492, a son of Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici and Alfonsina Orsini. His paternal grandparents were Lorenzo the Magnificent and Clarice Orsini. His maternal grandparents were Roberto Orsini, Count of Tagliacozzo and Catherine San Severino. In 1510, while the Medici family were living near Rome, a black servant in their household - identified in documents as Simonetta da Collevecchio - gave birth to a son, Alessandro de' Medici, whom Lorenzo officially recognized as his illegitimate son. In 1531, Alessandro de' Medici became Florence's first hereditary monarch. Career Lorenzo II became lord of Florence in August 1513, after his uncle, Giuliano de' Medici, handed over control of its government. Ambitious by nature, Lorenzo II lacked patience with Florence's republican system of government, and thus in 1516, convinced his uncle, Pope Leo X to make him Duke of Urbino at the age of 24. So began a conflict with the city's theretofore duke, Francesco Maria I della Rovere. During the protracted War of Urbino, Delle Rovere recaptured the city, only to have Medici ‚Äì commanding a 10,000-man Papal army ‚Äì in turn, retake the city. During battle, Lorenzo was wounded, which prompted him to retire to Tuscany. In September 1517, he regained Urbino via treaty; however, it remained under the Medici family's rule for only two years. In 1521 the duchy reverted to the Della Rovere family. On 13 June 1518, Lorenzo married Madeleine de la Tour, daughter of the Count of Auvergne. The marriage produced a daughter, Catherine, who was born in 1519. Catherine de' Medici went on to become Queen of France, via a marriage to the future King Henry II of France, arranged by the second Medici Pope, Pope Clement VII. Only 21 days after Catherine de' Medici's birth, Lorenzo II died, \\"worn out by disease and excess.\\" Thus his daughter Catherine was raised primarily by the Medici Popes, Leo X and Clement VII, and their surrogates. Lorenzo II's tomb is in the Medici Chapel of Florence's Church of San Lorenzo, adorned by Michelangelo's sculpture Pensieroso, representing the Duke. Its companion piece, also sculpted by Michelangelo, represents Lorenzo II's uncle Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici. In sharing the same name with his illustrious ancestor, Lorenzo the Magnificent, the Duke's tomb is often mistaken for that of his grandfather.Peter Barenboim, Sergey Shiyan, Michelangelo: Mysteries of Medici Chapel, SLOVO, Moscow, 2006.

Included are some types of civilian vessels, such as blockade runners, steamboats, and privateers which contributed to the war efforts by the CSN. Also included are special types of floating batteries and harbor defense craft. CSN Warships The Secretary of the CS Navy, Stephen Mallory, was very aggressive on a limited budget in a land-focused war, and developed a two-pronged warship strategy of building ironclad warships for coastal and national defense, and commerce raiding cruisers, supplemented with exploratory use of special weapons such as torpedo boats and torpedoes. =Batteries= Based upon the successful employment of ironclad warships, particularly batteries, at the Battle of Kinburn, Britain and France decided to focus on armor plated warships, starting with coastal battery designs. Initial ocean going ironclad cruisers, such as the French and the British were only just emerging in 1859 and 1860, and were beyond the budget and timeline necessary for rapid force deployment that the CS Navy needed for immediate coastal defenses in 1861. Therefore, the Confederate Congress voted $2 million in May 1861 to buy ironclads from overseas, and in July and August started work on construction and converting wooden ships locally. On 12 October 1861, the became the first ironclad to enter battle when she fought Union warships on the Mississippi. In February 1862, the even larger joined the Confederate Navy, having been built at Norfolk. The Confederacy built a number of ships designed as versions of the Virginia, of which several saw action.

This is in order to avoid discrimination arising from the impression that there are social roles for which one gender is more suited than another. The disparity in gender equality throughout history, has had a significant impact on many aspects of society, including marketing, toys, education and parenting techniques. In order to increase gender neutrality in recent years, there has been a societal emphasis on utilising inclusive language and advocating for equality. In policy Gender neutral bathroom signage, California, United States, 2016 Gender neutral bathroom signage, United States, 2017 Proponents of gender neutrality may support public policies designed to eliminate gender distinctions, such as gender-neutral bathrooms, with public restrooms being available without distinguishing the gender of the person using them. It has been observed that gender neutrality in the law has changed the nature of custody disputes, making it more likely that men will be awarded custody of their children in the event of a divorce.Regina Graycar, Jenny Morgan, The Hidden Gender of Law (2002), p. 260. The legal definition of gender has been a controversial topic particularly to transgender people; in some countries in order to be legally defined as a new sex people must first undergo sterilization. California joined Oregon in its effort to recognize gender neutrality. On October 15, 2017 California governor Jerry Brown signed new legislation into law that allows persons the option to select gender-neutral on state identification cards. Gray areas in gender An issue related to gender neutrality is the gray areas that exist in gender. Trying to legally define the boundaries of gender has proven a difficult issue with the existence of people who identify or who are identified by others as intersex, third gender, transgender and more generally genderqueer or non-binary. Gender blindness Gender blindness is the practice of not distinguishing people by gender. Although gender blindness delineates the idea of equality of genders, it apparently does not contribute to the ideas of gender neutrality. Someone who is gender blind does not necessarily side with ideas of movements that are found within gender-related biases, though these accounts are debatable. Gender-neutral language Gender-neutral language, gender- inclusive language, inclusive language or gender neutrality is a form of linguistic prescriptivism that aims to eliminate (or neutralize) reference to gender in terms that describe people. This can involve discouragement of the use of gender-specific job titles, such as policeman/policewoman, fireman, stewardess, and, arguably, chairman, in favour of corresponding gender-neutral terms such as police officer, firefighter, flight attendant and chairperson (or chair). Other gender-specific terms, such as actor and actress, may be replaced by the originally male term (actor used for either gender). The pronouns he or she may be replaced with they when the gender of the person referred to is unknown. Some also advocate for a gender-neutral pronoun to be used even when the sex of a person is known, in an effort to remove the alleged subconscious effects of language in reinforcing gender and gender stereotypes.Clarke, J. A. (2019). They, Them, and Theirs. Harvard Law Review, 132(3), 895‚Äì991. In addition, those who do not identify as either female or male may use a gender-neutral pronoun to refer to themselves or have others refer to them. In 2012 a gender-neutral pronoun \\"hen\\" was proposed in Sweden, and in 2014 it was announced that this word would be included in the following edition of the Swedish Academy Glossary. Swedish thus became the first language to have a gender-neutral pronoun added by an authoritative institution. \\"Hen\\" can be used to describe anyone regardless of their sex or gender identification. Gender-neutral pronouns that have been proposed in the United States have not had widespread use outside of LGBTQ communities. The practice of gender-neutral language is highly encouraged among law students and the Supreme Court of the United States. However, research has shown that only one judge on the Supreme Court consistently uses gender-neutral language. LGBTQ activists have suggested that the pronouns \\"he/she and his/her linguistically enforce a normative two sex system\\" where one must fall into the gender binary of either male or female. There is a growing variety of several different gender-neutral pronouns. These may include sie, hir, hirs, and hirself, and also include \\"z\\" or \\"p\\". Some argue that only changing pronouns to be gender-neutral for people who are \\"sex/gender\\" ambiguous creates someone \\"other\\" than the norm. A proposed solution to this issue is to move towards the use of inclusive language and gender-neutral pronouns for everyone. \\"Gender-neutral language\\" should not be confused with \\"genderless language\\", which refers to a language that does not have grammatical gender. Relationship to feminism and masculism Gender neutrality emphasizes the equal treatment of men and women and people of any other gender legally with no discrimination whatsoever. This goal is in principle shared with both feminists and masculists. However, in gender neutralism, the emphasis is on transcending the perspective of gender altogether rather than focusing on the rights of specific genders. Relationship to transhumanism Gender neutrality or \\"gender transcendence\\" is part of the transhumanist concept of postgenderism, which is defined as the movement to erode the cultural, biological, psychological, and social role of gender within society. Advocates of postgenderism argue that the presence of gender roles, social stratification, and cogno-physical disparities and differences are generally to the detriment of individuals and society. Given the radical potential for advanced assistive reproductive options, postgenderists believe that sex for reproductive purposes will either become obsolete, or that all post-gendered humans will have the ability, if they so choose, to both carry a pregnancy to term and father a child, which, postgenderists believe, would have the effect of eliminating the need for definite genders in such a society. From a transhumanist perspective, a shift in gender neutrality is seen as a direct result of the movement of postgenderism. Along with gender fluidity and postgenderism, gender neutrality would be a contributor if a movement of transhumanism were to occur. Given that an individual's phenotype serves as the primary basis for gender classification, transhumanism would erode the binary division of gender, allowing for gender neutrality within future societies. Impact =In marketing= Marketing is often focused on targeting specific demographics and creates products focused on specific genders. Public views on gender-specific marketing have gained media attention in recent years, for example a protest against a bic pen \\"Bic for her\\" that was targeted towards women by the posting of thousands of fake reviews of the pen mocking its female-specific advertising.  Children's toys  In the marketing of children's toys, gender-specific marketing has been very prevalent. According to a study conducted in 2012, \\"children learn about the toys seen as appropriate for their gender not only from adults and children but also through the media, which serves as an important source of socialization and gender socialization.\\" Color palettes and types of toys are gendered characteristics of the toys marketed to either boys or girls. The results of the study mentioned above, showed that \\"toys that were pastel colored were much more likely to be marketed as toys for 'only girls', while bold colored toys were much more likely to be marketed as toys for 'boys only'\\" and also found that blue was a more gender-neutral color. Action toys, like cars, weapons, and building toys are marketed toward boys, while toys that have to do with beauty and domestic work are marketed towards girls. An additional study done in 2014, with two different types of experiments, focuses on labeling of toys,‚Äúfor girls‚Äù and ‚Äúfor boys‚Äù, paired with explicit colors, pink and blue, and gender stereotypes in children. In one study, novel items were presented to children, painted different colors and labeled differently. A nutcracker was presented to the children as blue and labeled ‚Äúfor boys‚Äù in once instance, but to other children it was pink and labeled ‚Äúfor girls‚Äù. The results of the studies found labeling profoundly affected the children‚Äôs liking towards toys, and the other study showed that girls are more affected than boys in terms of labeling. The ‚Äúcolor pink did seem to give girls permission to explore masculine toys. This indicates that pink may signify that it is allowable for girls to show interest in counter-stereotypic toys and activities‚Äù. This gender specific marketing/labeling exposes children to gender roles and that color can be an indicator of gender. Children ‚Äúshow less involvement with toys stereotypically associated with the opposite sex, and they reject such toys more than ones stereotypically associated with their own sex or neutral ones‚Äù. Toys are a medium for children to form gender stereotypes. Some toys, like stuffed animals, have proven to be gender-neutral and are usually marketed to both boys and girls. Parents also play a large role in building their children's gender socialization, as they are the ones buying the toys for their children. The popularity of making toy advertising gender neutral has been increasing through media such as ads showing boys playing with baby dolls (a toy that has commonly been marketed only towards girls in the past). At a young age for both boys and girls start to identify themselves by their gender role and are limited to what they can or can't do. Not just that, but the environment around young boys and girls also influences their behavior.  Fashion  In the marketing of fashion lines, some designers are beginning to design gender-neutral clothing, that is not labeled as either \\"men's\\" or \\"women's\\". In today‚Äôs society gender neutrality is becoming more widely accepted. ‚ÄúBoth males and females are now ‚Äòallowed‚Äô to wear certain clothing items once thought inappropriate for their sex‚Äù. Females have more freedom because females wearing more masculine clothing is accepted, like suits, but men wearing feminine clothing, like dresses, is less appropriate. This aspect of gender neutral clothing says ‚Äúthat the world according to (ruling-class) men [are] the only viable one‚Äù because most gender neutral clothing looks like typical male clothing. Some sportswear clothing are now including gender neutrality in order to promote gender equality for men and women. ASOS, a famous online fashion company based in the UK, is one of the companies making gender neutral lines. Paired with GLAAD, they recently started a line that is gender neutral. In addition, Wilde Vertigga, Kirrin Finch, One DNA, S.K. Manor Hill, Cilium, Official Rebrand, and Beau Novo are all companies who promote gender neutral clothing. ‚ÄúGenderless clothing allows some people to feel more like themselves, as opposed to being lumped into a gendered category that doesn‚Äôt work for them\\". =In education= At Nicolaigarden and Egalia, two preschools in Sweden, have replaced the terms ‚Äúgirl‚Äù and ‚Äúboy‚Äù with the gender neutral pronoun ‚Äúhen‚Äù, granting students the ability to challenge or cross gender boundaries. In a study done in 2016 that measured teachers' facilitation of gender-typed and gender-neutral activities during free play, it was concluded that teachers facilitated masculine activities at higher rates than feminine. It is suggested by the study that, \\"Informing teachers about this trend may prompt teachers to reflect on their own teaching practices and serve as a catalyst for the promotion of teaching practices that create classroom environments in which boys and girls receive support for engagement with a variety of classroom activities.\\" Other suggestions and pursuits to broaden the mentality behind gender neutrality in schools include * allowing for gender-neutral prom and homecoming attendance and courts to accommodate same-sex-coupled and transgender participants * designating gender-neutral bathrooms and on-campus housing * establishing gender-neutral and co-ed fraternal student organizations * not separating toys in gender-specific areas * not having gender-specific sports in physical education lessons  Dress code  The abolishment of certain dress codes has been conserved among institutions depending on the limitations imposed on students and their comfort in such attire. For transgender students, strict dress codes may complicate their path towards confirming their gender identity, a cost which can affect these individuals well throughout their life. Ways in which compliance with attire in institutions can cause reverberations in other areas of life are factors such as a lowered academic performance, higher dropout rates, and increased disciplinary action. , 150 primary schools in the United Kingdom have introduced gender neutral uniforms and students feel more in control their identity as a result to this policy change.  College  In 2005, University of California, Riverside became the first public university campus in the US to offer a gender-neutral housing option. A February 2014 Washington Post article noted that nearly 150 US schools now have gender-neutral housing programs. Other institutions such as University of Southern California and Princeton, acknowledge some of the dangers that come as a result to housing options as a member of the LGBTQ community and have also developed separate housing to accommodate such students. In 2016, La Salle University students voted to have a gender-neutral housing option in their dormitories, which would make La Salle the first Catholic university in the United States to offer gender-neutral living. This student-led vote caused controversy in Catholic circles across the United States, since it is traditional for Catholic school residence halls to be completely separated by gender. La Salle University has since incorporated accommodating housing options for students and has urged other Catholic universities to make changes in housing policies as well. The University of Vermont allows students to select their own identity and pronoun. Not only that but, it is a university with immense help to overcome any changes that any student may have regarding their status. = In parenting = Jennifer Hockenbery Dragseth describes gender as \\"the classification of male or female that includes social, psychological, and intellectual characteristics. The theory of gender neutrality is a theory that claims that biological sex does not inevitably determine social, psychological, and intellectual characteristics.\\" Parental control strategies can be defined as any strategy that a parent uses to alter, change, or influence their child's behavior, thoughts, or feelings. Meta-analysis reveals from Endendijk, \\"the basis of gender-neutral parenting also known as GNP, does not project a gender onto a child. It allows parents and children to break away from gender binary.\\" Gender neutral parenting is allowing children to be exposed to a variety of gender types so children can explore their gender without restriction from society or the gender they were born with. Autonomy-supportive strategies provide the child with an appropriate amount of control, a desired amount of choice, acknowledge the child's perspectives and provide the child with meaningful rationales when the choice is constrained. Even if a child does not display gender-bending behaviors, Gender neutral parenting allows them to explore and not be constrained in the gender they were born with. This can be through letting them play with non-stereotypical toys for their gender, allowing them to pick their own clothing, allowing them to act more \\"feminine\\" or masculine\\", and allowing children to question their gender. In the sociology book Sex Differences In Social Behavior: A Social Role Interpretation, Alice Eagly theorizes that sex differences have been proposed, based on biological factors, early childhood socialization, and other perspectives. This allows children to express themselves without feeling pressure from being extremely masculine or feminine.  Attitudes and judgement towards gender-roles and toys  Parent attitudes towards the child can influence child behaviors such as in toy selection. For example, Parents, offer children toys and other objects that are gender-specific; trucks for boys and dolls for girls. A study done in Austria, where 324 parents participated showed that by parents‚Äô judgments about the desirability of different types of toys for their children and how the parents‚Äô judgment based on gender-typing of toys, gender role attitudes shows that parents rated same-gender-typed and gender-neutral toys as more desirable for their children than cross-gender-typed toys. This indicates that most traditional parents limit their child interests and behaviors than egalitarian parents. When it comes to education, parents‚Äô attitudes towards their child gender reflects on their expectation for the child. Although Parents are still unwilling to send their daughters to the schools, there is a low participation rate of female education compared to male, a case study showcased. Parents tend to treat their sons and daughters differently, making the sons preferred over the daughters due to the gender roles society has placed due to them considered as helping hands for their parents. For example, the son providing economic support while the daughter expecting to conform to the house. Although sons are still preferred, the attitudes towards neutrality have steadily increased in the past two decades. Feminist economics such as Julie A. Nelson argues that for a nonsexist society, the differences are revalued positively while others such as Patricia Elliot believes gender‚Äêspecific categories need to be eliminated to enable a positive society Although Gender neutral parenting allows their children to be able to decide how they experience their gender, non-gender neutral parents believe the children are programmed in from birth to play with gender directed toys, and parents had no influence towards their children selecting a gender-stereotyped toy. Children at a young age start to develop a sense of how everyone starts to dress depending the gender of each individual. when a girl dress in a way that it is not correct according to society the child will suffer bullying. According to Kent, Canterbury, states \\"children aged 3‚Äì7 years of age. They found that younger girls were more motivated to dress in gender-typed ways than older girls were, and understanding of gender stability (i.e. knowledge that gender remains stable over time) predicted appearance rigidity in both boys and girls. this comes to show how the way people dress it impacts children at a young age. = In children's literature = Gender neutrality in children's literature refers to the idea that publishers, writers and illustrators should avoid marketing towards children through the basis of their sex or gender, and should instead focus on expanding content rather than reinforcing social and gender roles. Gender roles and stereotypes permeate our culture and are established through a variety of means such as visual culture or daily interactions with family and peers. Topics of gender neutrality and gender performativity have been discussed in a broader sense among scholars such as Judith Butler in Undoing Gender and Gender Trouble in relation to other aspects of society such as in the case of David Reimer. In relation to children's marketing, gender neutrality is a growing movement among parents, children and publishers. Although there are many homes to gender stereotypes, the books that children are encountering have both psychological and social uses during a time when children are constantly constructing ideas from information around them and assimilating new knowledge with previous knowledge. Organizations such as Let Toys Be Toys, Let Books Be Books and Pinkstinks have been gaining publicity for their work in favour of gender neutrality within children's literature and toys.  Representations of gender within picture books  Studies at Provider-Parent Partnerships have shown that children begin forming their sense of gender identity at 2‚Äì3 years old and begin 'Gender typing' at ages 3‚Äì4. In a study surrounding Gender Perception in Adults, Dr. Kyle Pruett reported: \\"A defining moment came in gender difference research when a group of male babies were dressed in pink, and then handed to adults who were told they were girls. The adults responded with language and handling styles shown to be classically female-stereotypic: \\"adorable, cuddly, sweet, cute,\\" etc. Female babies in blue were called \\"slugger, tough, strong, stubborn,\\" etc. This is how we simply wind up reinforcing gender-stereotypic behaviors, rather than fostering individual growth and development.\\" The concept of a child developing their sense of self in formative years has been a topic of discussion among cultural theorists as well as in children's literature criticism. In The Pleasures of Children's Literature, Shulamith Shahar states, \\"Child raising practices and educational methods as well as parent-child relation are determined not solely by biological laws but are also culturally constructed\\". Theorists such as Jacques Lacan and Judith Butler have contributed to this notion of the formation of an individual's subjectivity and sense of self. Lacan's concept of the mirror stage has contributed to modern understanding of subjectivity and has since been applied to Children's Literature Criticism and child development. The Mirror Stage refers to the process in which an infant recognizes itself in the mirror for the first time and, \\"the transformation that takes place in the subject when he assumes an image\\". As Hamida Bosmajian has stated in Understanding Children's Literature, \\"The literary text, then, is an image of the unconscious structured like a language.\\" Bosmajian proceeds to write, \\"When the [Mirror Stage] is given utterance in the reader-interpreter's language, [the meaning] is deferred.\\" Judith Butler's notion of gender performativity also forms correlations to gender-specific children's literature through analyzing the ways characters perform their gender and has been taken up in Children's literature criticism. Butler has defined gender performativity stating: \\"the production actually happens through a certain kind of repetition and recitation\\". Butler also relays that, \\"Performativity is the discursive mode by which ontological effects are installed.\\" Although Butler's subject is the adult subject the concept of repetition transcends to themes of childhood as well. Both Butler and Lacan consider repetition as being an underlying factor in forming one's identity which can then be applied to children's literature through the act of children rereading books multiple times.  Studies in representation in children's literature  Gender imbalances have continued to appear in children's literature through the lack of diverse representations. In the 2011 issue of Gender & Society, the study \\"Gender in Twentieth-Century Children's Books\\" discovered large disparities. Through looking at almost 6,000 children's books published between 1900 and 2000, the study, led by Janice McCabe, a professor of sociology at Florida State University, found that males are central characters in 57% of children's books published each year, with just 31% having female central characters. Male animals are central characters in 23% of books per year, the study found, while female animals star in only 7.5%. In putting forth these narrow representations of characters, it becomes difficult for a child to identify themselves within gender binaries and roles. In an earlier study in 1971, out of fifty-eight books, twenty-five had a picture of a woman somewhere in them, yet only four did not having a woman (or animal representing a woman) wearing an apron. Many parents read their own childhood favourites to their children, through an endearing plot, or through beautiful illustrations. Although the adult may recognize that the stereotypes may be outdated, the children may lack that criticality in reading these stories. Furthering this portrayal of gender in children's books the ways in which each gender is portrayed is very different. Female characters are much more likely to take on passive and supportive roles whereas male characters fulfill a self-sufficient, strong and active role. This discriminatory portrayal takes place in many children's books and runs the risk of leading children toward a misrepresented and misguided realization of their true potential in their expanding world. Proquest. Pdf. Not only are these inequalities present within the books, but gender disparities also exist among those creating children's books. In the 2013 Vida: Women in Literary Arts count, male authors and illustrators drastically outnumbered those who were female (64:21).  In children's literature in the media  In March 2014, the British organization, Let Toys Be Toys, expanded to include a children's book specific category, Let Books Be Books. This expansion specifically addressed gender specific titles on books such as The Beautiful Girl's Colouring Book and The Brilliant Boys Colouring Book and the limitations in which these titles impose upon children. As Katy Guest stated in an article for the Independent in March 2014, after Let Books Be Books launched, \\"What we are doing by pigeon-holing children is badly letting them down. And books, above all things, should be available to any child who is interested in them.\\" As the organization Let Toys Be Toys states, \\"Just like labeling toys 'for girls' or 'for boys' these books send out very limiting messages to children about what kinds of things are appropriate for girls or for boys.\\" The organization quickly gained momentum and almost immediately acquired over 3000 signatures for their petition causing publishers Parragon and Usborne to lend their support and stop publishing gender specific children's books. In November 2014, publishers of Peter and Jane Books, Ladybird Books agreed to make titles gender neutral stating: 'At Ladybird, we certainly don't want to be seen to be limiting children in any way.\\"  Controversy  Publishers such as Igloo Books and Buster Books continue to publish gender-specific children's books. In an interview in March 2014 Buster Editor Michael O'Mara stated: \\"The proof is in the pudding. Our two best children books ever are The Boys' Book and The Girls' Book. The boys' one included things like how to make a bow and arrow and how to play certain sports and you'd get things about style and how to look cool in the girls' book. 2,000 people signed this petition [in the first day], but we sold 500,000 copies of The Girls' Book. These statistics tell me I'm going in the right direction.\\" In a letter in response to this interview Let Books Be Books expressed the following concerns to Michael O'Mara: \\"We have been contacted by many parents, teachers and supporters who have serious concerns about several of the titles currently on your website and being marketed in shops across the UK. They believe, as we do, that labeling books by gender narrows children's choices and imaginations by telling them what they 'should' be reading, instead of letting them choose books that interest them.\\"  List of gender-neutral children's literature  Although there are many examples of gender-neutral children's literature, the following list contains a few notable examples. * John Dough and the Cherub ‚Äì L.

The NSGC advocates for the implementation of gender- inclusive dorm room and bathroom options. Twin siblings Emma Moore and Abi Moore founded a campaign, Pinkstinks, in London in May 2008 to raise awareness of the damage caused by gender stereotyping of children. Pinkstinks claims that the marketing of gender-specific products to young children encourages girls to limit their ambitions later in life. In a 2014 campaign, the United States-based grassroots group Play Unlimited announced the month-long observance of No Gender December.Blatchford, Emily. \\"'No Gender Stereotype December' Urges Retailers To Rethink Marketing Strategies For Children\\". Huffington Post. 3 December 2015. Retrieved 3 January 2017. In 2016, Canada came out with the \\"No Big Deal\\" campaign which is a \\"positive affirming response to the recent conflict around transgender peoples' pronouns.\\" This campaign encourages people to ask what pronouns people identify as, instead of just assuming based on people's looks. It also tries to make different pronouns easier for people to understand and grasp. Gender-neutral lawsuits = Jones v. Bon Appetit Management Company et al = In February 2014, former catering worker Valeria Jones sued employer Bon Appetit Management Co. in Oregon for US$518,000 after co-workers repeatedly referred to Jones as female. Jones did not identify as either male or female and when applying to work at Bon Appetit, purposely never filled out the male or female identification question. They repeatedly informed co-workers that they did not want to be identified using male or female gender pronouns and asked managers to address the employees as a group and educate the others about gender identity. Jones's suit states that the complaint to human resources was never resolved and the managers did not follow through per their requests, prompting their resignation. = Zzyym v. Tillerson = In September 2014, Dana Zzyym, an American U.S. Naval veteran, tried to apply for a passport. Instead of labeling their gender as male or female on the application form, they \\"wrote 'intersex' below the 'sex' category\\" and \\"requested 'X' as an acceptable marker.\\"United States District Court for the District of Colorado. Zzyym v. Kerry. 22 Nov. 2016. LexisNexis Academic [LexisNexis], advance.lexis.com/search/?pdmfid=1516831&crid;=bf589987-5931-449f-8065-3b388e99a8d5&pdsearchterms;=Zzyym+v.+Kerry%2C+220+F.+Supp.+3d+1106&pdstartin;=hlct%3A1%3A8&pdtypeofsearch;=searchboxclick&pdsearchtype;=SearchBox&pdqttype;=and&pdpsf;=&ecomp;=48sgkgk&earg;=pdpsf&prid;=020ba714-a3d4-4935-8c13-f58494abafae. They presented a birth certificate which labels Zzyym as neither male nor female. Zzyym was born with ambiguous genitalia and identifies as intersex. The State Department declined Zzyym's application. They (Zzyym) have sued the State Department, \\"saying the federal government violated the Constitution's guarantees of due process rights and discriminated against Zzyym based on gender.\\" In November 2016, the court issued the ruling in favor of Zzyym. But , the case has been reopened due to the State Department's continued refusal of a gender marker that is neither male nor female on its passport applications. = Jamie Shupe = On April 27, 2016, Jamie Shupe filed a petition in Multnomah County, Oregon, to no longer be designated male or female. Shupe, a retired United States Army sergeant, was born with male anatomy and lived for a time as a transgender woman. He later began to self- identify as non-binary. The Oregon state statutes had been changed in 2013 to no longer require proof of medical transition before a change in legal gender status. The statutes did not specify whether the new status had to be a binary one. Two of Shupe's doctors wrote letters for him stating that he was neither male nor female. On June 10, Judge Amy Holmes Hehn granted Shupe's petition.Hanssen, Shelby. ‚ÄúNOTE: Beyond Male or Female: Using Nonbinary Gender Identity to Confront Outdated Notions of Sex and Gender in the Law.‚Äù 2017, https://law.uoregon.edu/images/uploads/entries/Hanssen.pdf The ruling was a significant advance toward government recognition of non-binary individuals. In 2019, Shupe issued a statement explaining that he now disagreed with the concept of gender identity and was returning to living as a man. Criticism Much as with similar approaches to dealing with racism and ethnicity, not recognising and taking account of participants' sex can be harmful. It posits that it functions in a post-sexism society where women are no longer treated differently than men on the basis of their sex. Meanwhile, gendered treatment prevails all over the world. Of a study of organisations which offered women- only services, 23% said that their reason was based on women's inequality and the desire to address that imbalance; 20% that women-only spaces promote female development and empowerment; 18% that they were providing a service not being met by unisex services and which focused on the specific needs of women. Solely using gender neutral language can lead to a lack of representation or acknowledgment of certain identities. When pronouns such as \\"he\\" or \\"his\\" are used to refer to gender-neutral persons, there is a subconscious \\"sex bias\\" towards males over females, despite the subject being gender neutral. In sports, studies have shown that more gender references are made to women's versus men's sports, distinguishing female sports as \\"other.\\" However, these same studies point out that having a gender neutral sports environment could lead to a near complete lack of acknowledgement of women's sports/teams. The legal test of the \\"reasonable person\\" has been criticized for being genderblind in some areas of the law, particularly sexual harassment. In the American case of Ellison v. Brady, 924 F.2d 872 (1991), the court held that \\"a sex-blind reasonable person standard tends to be male-based and tends to systematically ignore the experiences of women\\". Gender neutral rape statutes can imply that the rates of female and male rapes/sexual harassment are the same, despite the rape ratios favoring females at a much higher rate. Studies indicate a broad support for single-sex service options to remain available. Of 1000 women polled by the Women's Resource Centre, 97% stated that women should have the option of accessing female-only services if they were victims of sexual assault. 57% indicated that they would choose a women-only gym over a mixed gym. Single-sex services can have a benefit in providing greater comfort and engaging participants who would otherwise not get involved. The ridding of all sex-separated restrooms could forfeit the feelings of having a safe bathroom space for some people by replacing them with restrooms for all genders/identities. Gender neutral laws have had unintended consequences. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 entitles certain employees a 12 week unpaid leave from work without a risk of job loss and applies to all genders. The employees must qualify for this leave by having been employed for over 12 months and be applying for leave due to a \\"serious health condition,\\" pregnancy, or adoption. Despite FMLA's gender neutrality language, there are concerns about the law reinforcing gender disparity involving childcare between males and females; since FMLA remains gender neutral, it does not recognize the burden of females during pregnancy that males do not experience. Women with children in the workplace are not given as much attention or resources as is needed for their female-specific, personal/at-home issues, reinforcing the gender disparity despite the law's need to be gender neutral. According to Lauren Spinner, \\"Portrayals of boys tend to emphasize masculine gender roles and stereotypically masculine play and toys, whereas portrayals of girls tend to emphasize feminine gender roles and stereotypically feminine play and toys\\".

Dworkin had taught previously at Yale Law School and the University of Oxford, where he was the Professor of Jurisprudence, successor to renowned philosopher H. L. A. Hart.

According to a survey in The Journal of Legal Studies, Dworkin was the second most-cited American legal scholar of the twentieth century. After his death, the Harvard legal scholar Cass Sunstein said Dworkin was \\"one of the most important legal philosophers of the last 100 years. He may well head the list.\\" His theory of law as integrity as presented in his book titled Law's Empire, in which judges interpret the law in terms of consistent moral principles, especially justice and fairness, is among the most influential contemporary theories about the nature of law. Dworkin advocated a \\"moral reading\\" of the United States Constitution,Freedom's Law: The Moral Reading of the American Constitution. Ronald Dworkin. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. 1996. via Google Books. and an interpretivist approach to law and morality. He was a frequent commentator on contemporary political and legal issues, particularly those concerning the Supreme Court of the United States, often in the pages of The New York Review of Books. Early life and education Ronald Dworkin was born in 1931 in Providence, Rhode Island, United States, the son of Madeline (Talamo) and David Dworkin. His family was Jewish. He graduated from Harvard University in 1953 with an A.B. summa cum laude, where he majored in philosophy and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in his junior year. He then attended Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was a Rhodes Scholar and a student of Sir Rupert Cross and J.H.C. Morris. After he completed his final year's exams at Oxford, the examiners were so impressed with his script that the Professor of Jurisprudence (then H. L. A. Hart) was summoned to read it. He was awarded a B.A. with a Congratulatory first. Dworkin then attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 1957 with an LL.B magna cum laude. He then clerked for Judge Learned Hand of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Judge Hand would later call Dworkin \\"the law clerk to beat all law clerks\\"‚Äîand Dworkin would recall Judge Hand as an enormously influential mentor.Dworkin, Ronald (1996), Freedom's Law: The Moral Reading of the American Constitution, Oxford: Oxford University Press, . Career After clerking for Judge Learned Hand, Dworkin was offered the opportunity to clerk for Justice Felix Frankfurter. He turned down the offer and joined Sullivan & Cromwell, a prominent law firm in New York City. After working at the firm, Dworkin became a Professor of Law at Yale Law School, where he became the holder of the Wesley N. Hohfeld Chair of Jurisprudence. In 1969, Dworkin was appointed to the Chair of Jurisprudence at Oxford, a position in which he succeeded H. L. A. Hart (who remembered Dworkin's Oxford examination and promoted his candidacy) and was elected Fellow of University College, Oxford. After retiring from Oxford, Dworkin became the Quain Professor of Jurisprudence at University College London, where he subsequently became the Bentham Professor of Jurisprudence. He was Frank Henry Sommer Professor of Law at New York University School of Law and professor of Philosophy at New York University (NYU), where he taught since the late 1970s. He co-taught a colloquium in legal, political, and social philosophy with Thomas Nagel. Dworkin had regularly contributed, for several decades, to The New York Review of Books. He delivered the Oliver Wendell Holmes Lecture at Harvard, the Storrs Lectures at Yale, the Tanner Lectures on Human Values at Stanford, and the Scribner Lectures at Princeton. In June 2011, he joined the professoriate of New College of the Humanities, a private college in London. Jurisprudence and philosophy =Law as rule and principle= Dworkin as a critic of HLA Hart's legal positivism has been summarized by the Stanford Encyclopedia which has stated that: > Dworkin, as positivism's most significant critic, rejects the positivist > theory on every conceivable level. Dworkin denies that there can be any > general theory of the existence and content of law; he denies that local > theories of particular legal systems can identify law without recourse to > its moral merits, and he rejects the whole institutional focus of > positivism. A theory of law is for Dworkin a theory of how cases ought to be > decided and it begins, not with an account of the political organization of > a legal system, but with an abstract ideal regulating the conditions under > which governments may use coercive force over their subjects. Ronald Dworkin in 2008 Dworkin is most famous for his critique of Hart's legal positivism; he sets forth the fullest statement of his critique in his book Law's Empire. Dworkin's theory is 'interpretive': the law is whatever follows from a constructive interpretation of the institutional history of the legal system. Dworkin argues that moral principles that people hold dear are often wrong, even to the extent that certain crimes are acceptable if one's principles are skewed enough. To discover and apply these principles, courts interpret the legal data (legislation, cases, etc.) with a view to articulating an interpretation that best explains and justifies past legal practice. All interpretation must follow, Dworkin argues, from the notion of \\"law as integrity\\" to make sense. Out of the idea that law is 'interpretive' in this way, Dworkin argues that in every situation where people's legal rights are controversial, the best interpretation involves the right answer thesis, the thesis that there exists a right answer as a matter of law that the judge must discover. Dworkin opposes the notion that judges have a discretion in such difficult cases. Dworkin's model of legal principles is also connected with Hart's notion of the Rule of Recognition. Dworkin rejects Hart's conception of a master rule in every legal system that identifies valid laws, on the basis that this would entail that the process of identifying law must be uncontroversial, whereas (Dworkin argues) people have legal rights even in cases where the correct legal outcome is open to reasonable dispute. Dworkin moves away from positivism's separation of law and morality, since constructive interpretation implicates moral judgments in every decision about what the law is. Despite their intellectual disagreements, Hart and Dworkin \\"remained on good terms.\\" =The right answer thesis= In Dworkin's own words, his \\"right answer thesis\\" may be interpreted through the following hypothetical: > Suppose the legislature has passed a statute stipulating that \\"sacrilegious > contracts shall henceforth be invalid.\\" The community is divided as to > whether a contract signed on Sunday is, for that reason alone, sacrilegious. > It is known that very few of the legislators had that question in mind when > they voted, and that they are now equally divided on the question of whether > it should be so interpreted.

This is not to say that everyone will have the same answer (a consensus of what is \\"right\\"), or if it did, the answer would not be justified exactly in the same way for every person; rather it means that there will be a necessary answer for each individual if he applies himself correctly to the legal question. For the correct method is that encapsulated by the metaphor of Judge Hercules, an ideal judge, immensely wise and with full knowledge of legal sources. Hercules (the name comes from a classical mythological hero) would also have plenty of time to decide. Acting on the premise that the law is a seamless web, Hercules is required to construct the theory that best fits and justifies the law as a whole (law as integrity) in order to decide any particular case. Hercules is the perfect judge, but that doesn't mean he always reaches the right answer.Dworkin, 1986, p. 239-40 Dworkin does not deny that competent lawyers often disagree on what is the solution to a given case. On the contrary, he claims that they are disagreeing about the right answer to the case, the answer Hercules would give.Dworkin, 1986, p. 239-40 Dworkin's critics argue not only that law proper (that is, the legal sources in a positivist sense) is full of gaps and inconsistencies, but also that other legal standards (including principles) may be insufficient to solve a hard case. Some of them are incommensurable. In any of these situations, even Hercules would be in a dilemma and none of the possible answers would be the right one. =Discussion of the right answer thesis= Dworkin's metaphor of judge Hercules bears some resemblance to Rawls' veil of ignorance and Habermas' ideal speech situation, in that they all suggest idealized methods of arriving at somehow valid normative propositions. The key difference with respect to the former is that Rawls' veil of ignorance translates almost seamlessly from the purely ideal to the practical. In relation to politics in a democratic society, for example, it is a way of saying that those in power should treat the political opposition consistently with how they would like to be treated when in opposition, because their present position offers no guarantee as to what their position will be in the political landscape of the future (i.e. they will inevitably form the opposition at some point). Dworkin's Judge Hercules, on the other hand, is a purely idealized construct, that is if such a figure existed, he would arrive at a right answer in every moral dilemma. For a critique along these lines see Lorenzo Zucca's Constitutional Dilemmas. Dworkin's right answer thesis turns on the success of his attack on the skeptical argument that right answers in legal-moral dilemmas cannot be determined. Dworkin's anti-skeptical argument is essentially that the properties of the skeptic's claim are analogous to those of substantive moral claims, that is, in asserting that the truth or falsity of \\"legal-moral\\" dilemmas cannot be determined, the skeptic makes not a metaphysical claim about the way things are, but a moral claim to the effect that it is, in the face of epistemic uncertainty, unjust to determine legal-moral issues to the detriment of any given individual. =Moral reading of the Constitution= In her book on Hans Kelsen, Sandrine BaumeBaume, Sandrine (2011). Hans Kelsen and the Case for Democracy, ECPR Press, pp. 53‚Äì54. identified Ronald Dworkin as a leading defender of the \\"compatibility of judicial review with the very principles of democracy.\\" Baume identified John Hart Ely alongside Dworkin as the foremost defenders of this principle in recent years, while the opposition to this principle of \\"compatibility\\" was identified as Bruce Ackerman and Jeremy Waldron.Waldron, Jeremy (2006). \\"The Core of the case against judicial review,\\" The Yale Law Review, 2006, Vol. 115, pp 1346‚Äì406. Dworkin has been a long-time advocate of the principle of the moral reading of the Constitution whose lines of support he sees as strongly associated with enhanced versions of judicial review in the federal government. =Theory of equality= Dworkin has also made important contributions to what is sometimes called the equality of what debate. In a famous pair of articles and his book Sovereign Virtue he advocates a theory he calls 'equality of resources'. This theory combines two key ideas. Broadly speaking, the first is that human beings are responsible for the life choices they make. The second is that natural endowments of intelligence and talent are morally arbitrary and ought not to affect the distribution of resources in society. Like the rest of Dworkin's work, his theory of equality is underpinned by the core principle that every person is entitled to equal concern and respect in the design of the structure of society. Dworkin's theory of equality is said to be one variety of so-called luck egalitarianism, but he rejects this statement (Philosophy and Public Affairs, v. 31: 2). =Positive and negative liberty= In the essay \\"Do Values Conflict? A Hedgehog's Approach\\" (Arizona Law Review, Vol 43:2), Dworkin contends that the values of liberty and equality do not necessarily conflict. He criticizes Isaiah Berlin's conception of liberty as \\"flat\\" and proposes a new, \\"dynamic\\" conception of liberty, suggesting that one cannot say that one's liberty is infringed when one is prevented from committing murder. Thus, liberty cannot be said to have been infringed when no wrong has been done. Put in this way, liberty is only liberty to do whatever we wish so long as we do not infringe upon the rights of others. Personal life and death While working for Judge Learned Hand, Dworkin met his future wife, Betsy Ross, with whom he would have twins Anthony and Jennifer. Betsy was the daughter of a successful New York businessman. They were married from 1958 until Betsy died of cancer in 2000. Dworkin later married Irene Brendel, the former wife of pianist Alfred Brendel. Dworkin died of leukemia in London on February 14, 2013 at the age of 81. He is survived by his second wife, two children, and two grandchildren. Awards In September 2007, Dworkin was awarded the Holberg International Memorial Prize. The award citation of the Holberg Prize Academic Committee recognized that Dworkin has \\"elaborated a liberal egalitarian theory\\" and stressed Dworkin's effort to develop \\"an original and highly influential legal theory grounding law in morality, characterized by a unique ability to tie together abstract philosophical ideas and arguments with concrete everyday concerns in law, morals, and politics\\". The New York University Annual Survey of American Law honored Dworkin with its 2006 dedication. In 2006, the Legal Research Institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico honored Dworkin with the International Prize of legal Research \\"Dr. H√©ctor Fix-Zamudio\\". In June 2000, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Pennsylvania. In June 2009, he was awarded an honorary doctorate of law by Harvard University. In August 2011, the University of Buenos Aires awarded Dworkin an honorary doctorate. The resolution noted that he \\"has tirelessly defended the rule of law, democracy and human rights.\\" These were among a number of honorary doctorates conferred upon him. On November 14, 2012, Dworkin received the Balzan Prize for Jurisprudence in Quirinale Palace, Rome, from the President of the Italian Republic. The Balzan Prize was awarded \\"for his fundamental contributions to Jurisprudence, characterized by outstanding originality and clarity of thought in a continuing and fruitful interaction with ethical and political theories and with legal practices\\".

He did not seek re-election to the U.S. Senate in 2008. Since February, 2009, he has worked at The Livingston Group, a Washington D.C. lobbying firm. Early life Allard was born in Fort Collins, Colorado, the son of Sibyl Jean (n√©e Stewart) and Amos Wilson Allard. He is descended from immigrants from Canada and Scotland.1 He was raised on a ranch near Walden, Colorado. He received a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from Colorado State University in 1968. =State Senate= Allard continued to run a veterinary practice full-time, while representing Larimer and Weld counties in the Colorado State Senate, from 1983 to 1990. During his tenure he was a strong supporter of fiscal responsibility and the preservation of a citizen legislature. Allard's influence on local politics is still felt today as he is the sponsor of Colorado's law limiting state legislative sessions to 120 days. U.S. House of Representatives Allard served in the United States House of Representatives from Colorado's Fourth Congressional District from 1991 to 1997. As a Colorado Representative, Allard served on the Joint Committee on Congressional Reform, which recommended many of the reforms included in the Contract with America. These reforms became some of the first to be passed by the Republican controlled Congress in 1995 and were the key to their platform. U.S. Senate =Elections= In 1996, Allard was elected to the United States Senate, defeating state Attorney General Gale Norton in the Republican primary and Tom Strickland by five percentage points in the general election. He made a pledge at the time to serve just two terms in the Senate before retiring. In 2002, he was re-elected, defeating Strickland again by the same margin. =Committee assignments= * Committee on Appropriations ** Interior Subcommittee (Ranking Member) ** Legislative Branch Subcommittee ** Energy and Water Development Subcommittee ** Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee ** Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee ** Transportation/HUD Subcommittee * Committee on the Budget * Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs ** Securities, Insurance, and Investment Subcommittee (Ranking Member) ** Financial Institutions Subcommittee ** Housing, Transportation, and Community Development Subcommittee * Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions ** Subcommittee on Children and Families ** Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety =Tenure= In 2003, Allard introduced into the Senate the Federal Marriage Amendment, seeking to ban same-sex marriages.Search Results ‚Äì THOMAS (Library of Congress) The amendment failed to advance to the House. In 2004, Allard reintroduced the Federal Marriage Amendment with minor changes. In presenting the amendment, Allard made the case that there is a \\"master plan\\" to \\"destroy the institution of marriage\\". Passage of the proposed Amendment failed 227 yea votes to 186 nay votes, where 290 yea votes (two-thirds) are required for passage of a proposed Constitutional amendment.Musgrave, Marilyn, et al.

Accessed 18 August 2007. In an April 2006 article, Time named Allard as one of America's 5 Worst Senators, dubbing him \\"The Invisible Man\\". The article criticised him for being \\"so bland that his critics have dubbed him \\"Dullard\\"\\", for \\"never playing a role in major legislation, even though he's on two key Senate committees, Budget and Appropriations\\" and for \\"rarely speaking on the floor or holding press conferences to push his ideas\\", concluding that \\"few of the bills he has introduced over the past year have passed\\". The article did however note that he was \\"polite, affable and willing to take on thankless tasks, such as his current role overseeing the construction of a visitors center on Capitol Hill\\". In response, two major Colorado newspapers defended the Senator.Massimo Calabresi and Perry Bacon, Jr., \\"Wayne Allard: The Invisible Man\\", Time Magazine, April 14, 2006. The Rocky Mountain News retorted that Time had made the \\"wrong call\\" and that Allard was a \\"hard-working advocate for Colorado interests.\\"Vincent Carroll, On Point: Wrong call on Allard , The Rocky Mountain News, April 18, 2006. The Gazette (Colorado Springs) also weighed in, saying the article was \\"... soft, subjective, snide, impressionistic slop ‚Äì further proof of the low to which this once-serious publication has sunk.\\" Upon his retirement, The Denver Post stated that \\"While we didn't always agree with Sen. Wayne Allard on policy matters, we never doubted that he was working hard for Colorado.\\" On January 15, 2007 Allard announced he would fulfill a 1996 campaign promise to serve only two Senate terms and would retire in January 2009. In April 2007, Allard announced his endorsement of Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination for President of the United States.Governor Mitt Romney Announces Support of Senator Wayne Allard Romney for President, Inc. Press Releases. April 16, 2007 Retrieved April 16, 2007 He switched his endorsement to John McCain once he secured his spot as the presumptive Republican nominee. As part of a statement released by his office in support of a day to honor emergency first responders in 2007, Allard was quoted as saying: \\"First responders in Colorado have recently provided critical services in the face of blizzards and tornados. Since I don't think first responders have really done anything significant in comparison to their counterparts who have dealt with real natural disasters, I have no idea what else to say here ‚Ä¶\\" In March 2008 the National Journal ranked him the second most-conservative U.S. Senator based on his 2007 votes.\\"National Journal's 2007 Vote Ratings\\" Political positions =Environmental record= Allard was a co-sponsor of the James Peak Wilderness Bill, which created a preserve around James Peak, and added to the Indian Peak Protection Area.

She was named for Powhatan, a Native American chief of eastern Virginia. She was one of the last, and largest, of the United States Navy's paddle frigates. Powhatans keel was laid on 6 August 1847 at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, then Gosport Shipyard, at Portsmouth, Virginia. Her engines were constructed by Mehaffy & Company. She cost $785,000. She was launched on 14 February 1850 by the Norfolk Navy Yard and commissioned on 2 September 1852, Captain William Mervine in command. Service history =Home Squadron, 1852= After shakedown out of the Norfolk Navy Yard, Powhatan joined the Home Squadron as flagship of Commodore John T. Newton and sailed for New York where she was visited by the Secretary of the Navy, John P. Kennedy. She departed New York on 16 October 1852 for Vera Cruz with the new Minister to Mexico, Judge Alfred Conkling, on board and returned to Norfolk on 27 November via Havana and Pensacola. =East India Squadron, 1853‚Äì1860= Powhatan, under Comdr. William J. McCluney, was next assigned to the East India Squadron and arrived on station via Cape of Good Hope on 15 June 1853. Her arrival in Chinese waters coincided with an important phase of Commodore Matthew C. Perry's expedition to open commercial relations with the Japanese. She was Perry's flagship during his November visit to Whampoa. On 14 February 1854 she entered Edo Bay with the rest of the squadron, remaining until the Convention of Kanagawa was signed on 31 March 1854 as part of Perry's show of force. After the signing of the treaty, the squadron moved to Shimoda, one of the ports opened by the treaty and the site of a future American consulate to conduct surveying operations. While at Shimoda, Yoshida Shoin came aboard and unsuccessfully requested to be taken to the United States. During August 1855, Powhatan accompanied in a successful battle against Chinese pirates off Kowloon, and reached the U.S. on 14 February 1856 with the new treaty. The US-Japan Treaty of Amity and Commerce was signed on her deck on 29 July 1858 (19 June in the old Japanese calendar). On 13 February 1860, the Powhatan accompanied by a Japanese capital ship, that departed on 9 February (18 January in the old Japanese calendar), left Yokohama, Japan, en route to San Francisco as part of the first official embassy of the Empire of Japan to the United States of America. The Japanese embassy was formally composed of three men: Ambassador Shinmi Masaoki (Êñ∞Ë¶ãÊ≠£Ëàà), Vice-Ambassador Muragaki Norimasa (ÊùëÂû£ÁØÑÊ≠£), and Observer Oguri Tadamasa (Â∞èÊ†óÂø†È†Ü). =Civil War, 1860‚Äì1865= Powhatan remained active throughout the Civil War. She served as Flag Officer Garrett J. Pendergrast's flagship at Vera Cruz during October 1860. In April 1861, while under the command of Lt. David Dixon Porter, she assisted in the relief of Fort Pickens, Florida. President Abraham Lincoln had attempted to countermand the order sending the Powhatan to Fort Pickens and send the ship to assist in the relief expedition to Fort Sumter instead, but because Secretary of State William H. Seward signed the order \\"Seward\\" rather than \\"Lincoln,\\" the order was not obeyed.Allan Nevins, The Improvised War, 1861‚Äì1862 (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1959), p. 65 n. 58. The Powhatan assisted in the establishment of the blockade of Mobile, Alabama on 26 May, capturing schooner Mary Clinton on 29 May. During July and August Powhatan joined the blockade of the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River, retaking schooner Abby Bradford on 15 August. From late August to October she pursued CSS Sumter throughout much of the West Indies. Powhatan operated off Charleston, South Carolina from October 1862 to August 1863, captured schooner Major E. Willis on 19 April and sloop C. Routereau on 16 May, and deployed for a second time to the West Indies from November 1863 to September 1864 as flagship of Rear Admiral James L. Lardner. She participated in the successful reduction of Fort Fisher, 24‚Äì25 December 1864 and in its capture on 13‚Äì15 January 1865. =South Pacific Squadron, 1866‚Äì1869= After the war, in October 1865, she sailed from Boston with and , escorting monitor to California via Cape Horn. She arrived at San Francisco on 22 June 1866. Powhatan was the flagship of the South Pacific Squadron 1866‚Äì1869, commanded by Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren from 12 December 1866 to 14 July 1868. In March 1866 she was sent to Valpara√≠so to protect U.S. interests during the Chincha Islands War. On 13 August 1868, Powhatah sustained damaged to one of her paddle wheels at Callao, Peru during the Arica earthquake. =North Atlantic Squadron, 1869‚Äì1886= From 1869 to 1886, she was attached to the North Atlantic Squadron and was flagship from 15 September 1869 until 30 December 1870 and again from 4 July 1877 until 10 December 1879. During this period, three Powhatan crewman earned the Medal of Honor for rescuing fellow sailors from drowning: Landsman George W. Cutter at Norfolk, Virginia, on 27 May 1872; Seaman Joseph B. Noil at Norfolk on 26 December 1872; and Coxswain William Anderson on 28 June 1878. In 1877, the ship was ordered to Baltimore, Maryland along with the Swatara, on a peacekeeping mission following the city's riots, which occurred as part of the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. The ship ended her long and conspicuous career by making numerous cruises in Cuban waters to protect American commerce: July‚ÄìAugust 1880, February‚ÄìMay 1882, January‚ÄìMay 1883, January‚ÄìMay 1885, and January‚ÄìFebruary 1886.

Giles was educated at Charterhouse School before becoming a British diplomat in China. He modified a Mandarin Chinese romanisation system established by Thomas Wade, resulting in the widely known Wade‚ÄìGiles Chinese romanisation system. Among his many works were translations of the Analects of Confucius, the Lao Tzu (Tao Te Ching), the Chuang Tzu, and, in 1892, the widely published A Chinese-English Dictionary. Biography Herbert A. Giles was the fourth son of John Allen Giles (1808‚Äì1884), an Anglican clergyman. After studying at Charterhouse, Herbert became a British diplomat to Qing China, serving from 1867 to 1892. He also spent several years (1885‚Äì1888) at Fort Santo Domingo in Tamsui, northern Taiwan. He was the father of Bertram, Valentine, Lancelot, Edith, Mable, and Lionel Giles. In 1897 Herbert Giles became only the second professor of Chinese language appointed at the University of Cambridge, succeeding Thomas Wade. At the time of his appointment, there were no other sinologists at Cambridge. Giles was therefore free to spend most of his time among the ancient Chinese texts earlier donated by Wade, publishing what he chose to translate from his eclectic reading in Chinese literature.Aylmer, Charles, East Asian History 13‚Äì14, 1997, pp. 1‚Äì7; Sterckx, Roel, In the Fields of Shennong: An inaugural lecture delivered before the University of Cambridge on 30 September 2008 to mark the establishment of the Joseph Needham Professorship of Chinese History, Science and Civilization. Cambridge: Needham Research Institute, 2008. His later works include a history of the Chinese Pictorial Art in 1905 and his 1914 Hibbert Lectures on Confucianism which was published in 1915 by Williams and Norgate (de). He dedicated the third edition of Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio (1916) to his seven grandchildren, but at the end of his life was on speaking terms with only one of his surviving children. An ardent agnostic, he was also an enthusiastic freemason. He never became a Fellow at one of the constituent colleges of the University of Cambridge, despite being a university professor for 35 years.

At its greatest extent, it covered an area from southern Siberia in the north to present-day Kyrgyzstan in the south, and from the Great Wall of China in the east to present-day Kazakhstan in the west. The core of the Dzungar Khanate is today part of northern Xinjiang, also called Dzungaria. About 1620 the western Mongols, known as the Oirats, united in Dzungaria. In 1678, Galdan received from the Dalai Lama the title of Boshogtu Khan, making the Dzungars the leading tribe within the Oirats. The Dzungar rulers used the title of Khong Tayiji, which translates into English as \\"crown prince\\".C. P. Atwood Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p.622 Between 1680 and 1688, the Dzungars conquered the Tarim Basin, which is now southern Xinjiang, and defeated the Khalkha Mongols to the east. In 1696, Galdan was defeated by the Qing dynasty and lost Outer Mongolia. In 1717 the Dzungars conquered Tibet, but were driven out a year later by the Qing. In 1755, the Manchus took advantage of a Dzungar civil war to conquer Dzungaria and destroyed the Dzungars as a people. The destruction of the Dzungars led to the Qing conquest of Mongolia, Tibet, and the creation of Xinjiang as a political administrative unit.  Etymology  \\"Dzungar\\" is a compound of the Mongolian word jeg√ºn (z√º√ºn), meaning \\"left\\" or \\"east\\" and Œ≥ar meaning \\"hand\\" or \\"wing\\".For the Mongols the primary direction was south. Mongolian maps placed the south at the top, so west was to the right and east was to the left. The region of Dzungaria derives its name from this confederation. Although the Dzungars were located west of the Eastern Mongols, the derivation of their name has been attributed to the fact that they represented the left wing of the Oirats. In the early 17th century, the head of the Oirat confederation was the leader of the Khoshut, Gushi Khan. When Gushi Khan decided to invade Tibet to replace the local Tsangpa Khan in favor of the Tibetan Geluk Sect, the Oirat army were organized into left and right wing. The right wing consisting of Khoshuts and Torguts remained in Tibet while the Choros and Khoid of the Left wing retreated north into the Tarim basin, since then the powerful empire of the Choros became known as the Left Wing, i.e. Zuungar.  History  The Oirats in 1616 = Origin = The Oirats were originally from the area of Tuva during the early 13th century. Their leader, Quduqa B√§ki, submitted to Genghis Khan in 1208 and his house intermarried with all four branches of the Genghisid line. During the Toluid Civil War, the Four Oirat (Choros, Torghut, D√∂rbet, and Khoid) sided with Ariq B√∂ke and therefore never accepted Kublaid rule. After the Yuan dynasty's collapse, the Oirats supported the Ariq B√∂kid Jorightu Khan Yes√ºder in seizing the Northern Yuan throne. The Oirats held sway over the Northern Yuan khans until the death of Esen Taishi in 1455, after which they migrated west due to Khalkha Mongol aggression. In 1486, the Oirats became embroiled in a succession dispute which gave Dayan Khan the opportunity to attack them. In the latter half of the 16th century, the Oirats more territory to the Tumed. In 1620, the leaders of the Choros and Torghut Oirats, Kharkhul and Mergen Temene, attacked Ubasi Khong Tayiji, the first Altan Khan of the Khalkha. They were defeated and Kharkhul lost his wife and children to the enemy. An all out war between Ubasi and the Oirats lasted until 1623 when Ubasi was killed. In 1625, a conflict erupted between the Khoshut chief Ch√∂√ºk√ºr and his uterine brother Baibaghas over inheritance issues. Baibaghas was killed in the fight. However, his younger brothers G√ºshi Khan and K√∂nd√∂l√∂n Ubashi took up the fight and pursued Ch√∂√ºk√ºr from the Ishim River to the Tobol River, attacking and killing his tribal followers in 1630. The infighting among the Oirats caused the Torghut chief Kho Orluk to migrate westwards until they came into conflict with the Nogai Horde, which they destroyed. The Torghuts founded the Kalmyk Khanate but still stayed in contact with the Oirats in the east. Every time a great assembly was called, they sent representatives to attend. In 1632, the Gelug Yellow Hat sect in Qinghai was being repressed by the Khalkha Choghtu Khong Tayiji, so they invited G√ºshi Khan to come and deal with him. In 1636, G√ºshi led 10,000 Oirats in an invasion of Qinghai which resulted in the defeat of a 30,000 strong enemy army and the death of Choghtu. He then entered Central Tibet, where he received from the 5th Dalai Lama the title of Bstan-'dzin Choskyi Rgyal-po (the Dharma King Who Upholds the Religion). He then claimed the title of Khan, the first non-Genghisid Mongol to do so, and summoned the Oirats to completely conquer Tibet, creating the Khoshut Khanate. Among those involved was Kharkhul's son, Erdeni Batur, who was granted the title of Khong Tayiji, married the khan's daughter Amin Dara, and sent back to establish the Dzungar Khanate on the upper Emil River south of the Tarbagatai Mountains. Baatur returned to Dzungaria with the title Erdeni (given by the Dalai Lama) and much booty. During his reign he made three expeditions against the Kazakhs. The conflicts by the Dzungars are remembered in a Kazakh ballad Elim-ai. The Dzungars also went to war against the Kyrgyz, Tajiks, Uzbeks when they invaded deep into Central Asia to Yasi (Turkestan) and Tashkent in 1643. =Succession dispute (1653‚Äì1677)= In 1653, Sengge succeeded his father Batur, but he faced dissent from his half brothers. With the support of Ochirtu Khan of the Khoshut, this strife ended with Sengge's victory in 1661. In 1667 he captured Erinchin Lobsang Tayiji, the third and last Altan Khan. However, he himself was assassinated by his half-brothers Chechen Tayiji and Zotov in a coup in 1670.Autobiography of Dalai Lama V, Vol. Kha, fol 107b. II 5‚Äì6 Sengge's younger brother Galdan Boshugtu Khan had been residing in Tibet at the time. Upon his birth in 1644 he was recognized as the reincarnation of a Tibetan lama who had died the previous year. In 1656 he left for Tibet, where he received education from Lobsang Ch√∂kyi Gyaltsen, 4th Panchen Lama and the 5th Dalai Lama. Upon learning of his brother's death, he immediately returned from Tibet and took revenge on Chechen. Allied with Ochirtu Sechen of the Khoshut, Galdan defeated Chechen, and drove Zotov out of Dzungaria. In 1671 The Dalai Lama bestowed the title of Khan on Galdan. Sengge's two sons Sonom Rabdan and Tsewang Rabtan revolted against Galdan but they were defeated. Although, already married Anu-Dara, granddaughter of Ochirtu, he came into conflict with his grandfather in law. Fearing Galdan's popularity, Ochirtu supported his uncle and rival Choqur Ubashi who refused to recognize Galdan's title. The victory over Ochirtu in 1677 resulted Galdan's domination of the Oirats. In the next year the Dalai Lama gave the highest title of Boshoghtu (or Boshughtu) Khan to him,Martha Avery The Tea Road: China and Russia meet across the Steppe, p. 104 = Conquest of the Yarkent Khanate (1678‚Äì1680) = From the late 16th century onward, the Yarkent Khanate fell under the influence of the Khojas. The Khojas were Naqshbandi Sufis who claimed descent from the prophet Muhammad or from the first four Arab caliphs. By the reign of Sultan Said Khan in the early 16th century, the Khojas already had a strong influence in court and over the khan. In 1533, an especially influential Khoja named Makhdum-i Azam arrived in Kashgar, where he settled and had two sons. These two sons hated each other and they passed down their mutual hatred down to their children. The two lineages came to dominate large parts of the khanate, splitting it between two factions: the Aq Taghliq (White Mountain) in Kashgar and the Qara Taghliq (Black Mountain) in Yarkand. Yulbars patronized the Aq Taghliqs and suppressed the Qara Taghliqs, which caused much resentment, and resulted in his assassination in 1670. He was succeeded by his son who ruled from only a brief period before Ismail Khan was enthroned. Ismail reversed the power struggle between the two Muslim factions and drove out the Aq Taghliq leader, Afaq Khoja. Afaq fled to Tibet, where the 5th Dalai Lama aided him in enlisting the help of Galdan Boshugtu Khan. In 1680, Galdan led 120,000 Dzungars into the Yarkent Khanate. They were aided by the Aq Taghliqs and Hami and Turpan, which had already submitted to the Dzungars. Ismail's son Babak Sultan died in the resistance against in the battle for Kashgar. The general Iwaz Beg died in the defense of Yarkand. The Dzungars defeated the Moghul forces without much difficulty and took Ismail and his family prisoner. Galdan installed Abd ar-Rashid Khan II, son of Babak, as puppet khan. =First Kazakh war (1681‚Äì1685)= In 1681, Galdan invaded the north of Tengeri Mountain and attacked the Kazakh Khanate but failed to take Sayram.Baabar, Christopher Kaplonski, D. Suhjargalmaa Twentieth-century Mongolia, p. 80 In 1683 Galdan's armies under Tsewang Rabtan took Tashkent and Sayram. They reached the Syr Darya and crushed two Kazakh armies. After that Galdan subjugated the Black Kyrgyz and ravaged the Fergana Valley. His general Rabtan took Taraz city. From 1685 Galdan's forces aggressively pushed westward, forcing the Kazakhs ever further west.Michael Khodarkovsky Where Two Worlds Met: The Russian State and the Kalmyk Nomads, 1600‚Äì1771, p. 211 The Dzungars established dominion over the Baraba Tatars and extracted yasaq (tribute) from them. Converting to Orthodox Christianity and becoming Russian subjects was a tactic by the Baraba to find an excuse not to pay yasaq to the Dzungars. =Khalkha war (1687‚Äì1688)= Dzungar Khanate before Galdan's invasion of Khalkha in 1688 The Oirats had established peace with the Khalkha Mongols since Ligdan Khan died in 1634 and the Khalkhas were preoccupied with the rise of the Qing dynasty. However, when the Jasaghtu Khan Shira lost part of his subjects to the T√ºsheet Khan Chikhundorj, Galdan moved his orda near the Altai Mountains to prepare an attack. Chikhundorj attacked the right wing of the Khalkhas and killed Shira in 1687. In 1688, Galdan dispatched troops under his younger brother Dorji-jav against Chikhundorj but they were eventually defeated. Dorji-jav was killed in battle. Chikhundorj then murdered Degdeehei Mergen Ahai of the Jasaghtu Khan who was on the way to Galdan. To avenge the death of his brother, Galdan established friendly relations with the Russians who were already at war with Chikhundorj over territories near Lake Baikal. Armed with Russian firearms, Galdan led 30,000 Dzungar troops into Khalkha Mongolia in 1688 and defeated Chikhundorj in three days. The Siberian Cossacks, meanwhile, attacked and defeated a Khalkha army of 10,000 near Lake Baikal. After two bloody battles with the Dzungars near Erdene Zuu Monastery and Tomor, Chakhundorji and his brother Jebtsundamba Khutuktu Zanabazar fled across the Gobi Desert to the Qing dynasty and submitted to the Kangxi Emperor. =First Qing war (1690‚Äì1696)= Late in the summer of 1690, Galdan crossed the Kherlen River with a force of 20,000 and engaged a Qing army at Battle of Ulan Butung 350 kilometers north of Beijing near the western headwaters of the Liao River. Galdan was forced to retreat and escaped total destruction because the Qing army did not have the supplies or ability to pursue him. In 1696, the Kangxi Emperor led 100,000 troops into Mongolia. Galdan fled from the Kherlen only to be caught by another Qing army attacking from the west. He was defeated in the ensuing Battle of Jao Modo near the upper Tuul River. Galdan's wife, Anu, was killed and the Qing army captured 20,000 cattle and 40,000 sheep. Galdan fled with a small handful of followers. In 1697 he died in the Altai Mountains near Khovd on 4 April. Back in Dzungaria, his nephew Tsewang Rabtan, who had revolted in 1689, was already in control as of 1691. =Chagatai rebellion (1693‚Äì1705)= Galdan installed Abd ar-Rashid Khan II, son of Babak, as puppet khan in the Yarkent Khanate. The new khan forced Afaq Khoja to flee again, but Abd ar-Rashid's reign was also ended unceremoniously two years later when riots erupted in Yarkand. He was replaced by his brother Muhammad Imin Khan. Muhammad sought help from the Qing dynasty, Khanate of Bukhara, and the Mughal Empire in combating the Dzungars. In 1693, Muhammad conducted a successful attack on the Dzungar Khanate, taking 30,000 captives. Unfortunately Afaq Khoja appeared again and overthrew Muhammad in a revolt led by his followers. Afaq's son Yahiya Khoja was enthroned but his reign was cut short in 1695 when both he and his father were killed while suppressing local rebellions. In 1696, Akbash Khan was placed on the throne, but the begs of Kashgar refused to recognize him, and instead allied with the Kyrgyz to attack Yarkand, taking Akbash prisoner. The begs of Yarkand went to the Dzungars, who sent troops and ousted the Kyrgyz in 1705. The Dzungars installed a non-Chagatayid ruler Mirza Alim Shah Beg, thereby ending the rule of Chagatai khans forever. Abdullah Tarkhan Beg of Hami also rebelled in 1696 and defected to the Qing dynasty. In 1698, Qing troops were stationed in Hami. =Second Kazakh war (1698)= In 1698 Galdan's successor Tsewang Rabtan reached Tengiz lake and Turkestan, and the Dzungars controlled Zhei-Su Tashkent until 1745.C. P. Atwood ibid, p. 622. The Dzungars' war on the Kazakhs pushed them into seeking aid from Russia. =Second Qing war (1718‚Äì1720)= Tsewang Rabtan's brother Tseren Dondup invaded the Khoshut Khanate in 1717, deposed Yeshe Gyatso, killed Lha-bzang Khan, and looted Lhasa. The Kangxi Emperor retaliated in 1718, but his military expedition was annihilated by the Dzungars in the Battle of the Salween River, not far from Lhasa.Richardson, Hugh E. (1984). Tibet and its History. Second Edition, Revised and Updated, pp. 48‚Äì9. Shambhala. Boston & London. (pbk) A second and larger expedition sent by Kangxi expelled the Dzungars from Tibet in 1720. They brought K√§lzang Gyatso with them from Kumbum to Lhasa and installed him as the 7th Dalai Lama in 1721.Richardson, Hugh E. (1984). Tibet and its History. Second Edition, Revised and Updated, pp. 48‚Äì9. Shambhala. Boston & London. (pbk) The people of Turpan and Pichan took advantage of the situation to rebel under a local chief, Amin Khoja, and defected to the Qing dynasty. =Galdan Tseren (1727‚Äì1745)= Tsewang Rabtan died suddenly in 1727 and was succeeded by his son Galdan Tseren. Galdan Tseren drove out his half-brother Lobszangshunu. He continued the war against the Kazakhs and the Kalkha Mongols. In retaliation against attacks against his Khalkha subjects, the Yongzheng Emperor of the Qing dynasty sent an invasion force of 10,000, which the Dzungars defeated near the Khoton Lake. The next year however, the Dzungars suffered a defeat against the Khalkhas near Erdene Zuu Monastery. In 1731, the Dzungars attacked Turpan, which had previously defected to the Qing dynasty. Amin Khoja led the people of Turpan in a retreat into Gansu where they settled in Guazhou. In 1739, Galdan Tseren agreed to the boundary between Khalkha and Dzungar territory. =Collapse (1745‚Äì1755)= Qing Dzungar wars from 1688 to 1757 The last Dzungar Khan Dawachi in Qing robes after his defeat Galdan Tseren died in 1745, triggering widespread rebellion in the Tarim Basin, and starting a succession dispute among his sons. In 1749 Galden Tseren's son Lama Dorji seized the throne from his younger brother, Tsewang Dorji Namjal. He was overthrown by his cousin Dawachi and the Khoid noble Amursana, but they too fought over control of the khanate. As a result of their dispute, in 1753, three of Dawachi's relatives ruling the D√∂rbet and Bayad defected to the Qing and migrated into Khalkha territory. The next year, Amursana also defected. In 1754, Yusuf, the ruler of Kashgar, rebelled and forcefully converted the Dzungars living there to Islam. His older brother, Jahan Khoja of Yarkand, also rebelled but was captured by the Dzungars due to the treachery of Ayyub Khoja of Aksu. Jahan's son Sadiq gathered 7,000 men in Khotan and attacked Aksu in retaliation. In the spring of 1755, the Qianlong Emperor sent an army of 50,000 against Dawachi. They met almost no resistance and destroyed the Dzungar Khanate within the span of 100 days. Dawachi fled into the mountains north of Aksu but was captured by Khojis, the beg of Uchturpan, and delivered to the Qing. Aftermath =Amursana's rebellion (1755‚Äì1757)= After defeating the Dzungar Khanate, the Qing planned to install khans for each of the four Oirat tribes, but Amursana wanted to rule over all the Oirats. Instead the Qianlong Emperor made him only khan of the Khoid. In the summer, Amursana along with Mongol leader Ching√ºnjav led a revolt against the Qing. Unable to defeat the Qing, Amursana fled north to seek refuge with the Russians and died of smallpox in Russian lands. In the spring of 1762 his frozen body was brought to Kyakhta for the Manchu to see. The Russians then buried it, refusing the Manchu request that it be handed over for posthumous punishment.C. P. Atwood ibid, 623Millward 2007, p. 95.G. Patrick March, Eastern Destiny: Russian in Asia and the Pacific, 1996, Chapter 12 =Aq Taghliq rebellion (1757‚Äì1759)= When Amursana rebelled against the Qing dynasty, the Aq Taghliq khojas Burhanuddin and Jahan rebelled in Yarkand. Their rule was not popular and the people greatly disliked them for appropriating anything they needed from clothing to livestock. In February 1758, The Qing sent Yaerhashan and Zhao Hui with 10,000 troops against the Aq Taghliq regime. Zhao Hui was besieged by enemy forces at Yarkand until January 1759, but otherwise the Qing army did not encounter any difficulties on campaign. The khoja brothers fled to Badakhshan where they were captured by the ruler Sultan Shah, who executed them and handed Jahan's head to the Qing. The Tarim Basin was pacified in 1759. =Genocide= According to the Qing scholar Wei Yuan (1794‚Äì1857), the Dzungar population before the Qing conquest was around 600,000 in 200,000 households. Wei Yuan wrote that about 40 percent of the Dzungar households were killed by smallpox, 20 percent fled to Russia or Kazakh tribes, and 30 percent were killed by Manchu bannermen. For several thousands of li, there were no gers except of those who had surrendered.ed. Starr 2004, p. 54. Wen-Djang Chu wrote that 80 percent of the 600,000 or more Dzungars were destroyed by disease and attack which Michael Clarke described as \\"the complete destruction of not only the Dzungar state but of the Dzungars as a people.\\" It's argued by the historian Peter Perdue that the destruction of the Dzungars was the result of an explicit policy of extermination launched by the Qianlong Emperor which lasted for two years. His commanders were reluctant to carry out his orders, which he repeated several times using the term jiao (extermination) over and over again. The commanders Hadaha and Agui were punished for only occupying Dzungar lands but letting the people escape. The generals Jaohui and Shuhede were punished for not showing sufficient zeal in exterminating rebels. Qianlong explicitly ordered the Khalkha Mongols to \\"take the young and strong and massacre them.\\" The elderly, children, and women were spared but they could not preserve their former names or titles. Mark Levene, a historian whose recent research interests focus on genocide, states that the extermination of the Dzungars was \\"arguably the eighteenth century genocide par excellence.\\" Widespread anti-Dzungar opinion by former Dzungar subjects contributed to their genocide. The Muslim Kazakhs and former people of the Yarkent Khanate in the Tarim Basin (now called Uyghurs), were treated poorly under by the Buddhist Dzungars, who used them as slave labor, and participated in the Qing invasion and attacked the Dzungars. Uyghur leaders like Khoja Emin were granted titles within the Qing nobility,Kim 2008, p. 308Kim 2008, p. 134Kim 2008, p. 49 and acted as an intermediary with Muslims from the Tarim Basin. They told the Muslims that the Qing only wanted to kill Oirats and that they would leave the Muslims alone. They also convinced the Muslims to aid the Qing in killing Oirates.Kim 2008, p. 139. =Demographic change in Xinjiang= After the destruction of the Dzungar Oirat people, the Qing dynasty sponsored the settlement of millions of Han, Hui, Xibe, Daur, Solon, Turkestani Oasis people (Uyghurs) and Manchus in Dzungaria since the land had been emptied.Perdue 2009, p. 285. Stanley W. Toops notes that modern Xinjiang's demographic situation still reflects the settlement initiative of the Qing dynasty. One third of Xinjiang's total population consisted of Han, Hui, and Kazakhs in the north while around two-thirds were Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang's Tarim Basin.ed. Starr 2004, p. 243.Tyler 2004, p. 4. Some cities in northern Xinjiang such as √úr√ºmqi and Yining were essentially made by the Qing settlement policy.Millward 1998, p. 102. The elimination of the Buddhist Dzungars led to the rise of Islam and its Muslim Begs as the predominant moral political authority in Xinjiang. Many Muslim Taranchis also moved to northern Xinjiang. According to Henry Schwarz, \\"the Qing victory was, in a certain sense, a victory for Islam\\".Liu & Faure 1996, p. 72. Ironically, the destruction of the Dzungars by the Qing led to the consolidation of Turkic Muslim power in the region, since Turkic Muslim culture and identity was tolerated or even promoted by the Qing.Liu & Faure 1996, p. 76. In 1759, the Qing dynasty proclaimed that the land formerly belonging to the Dzungars was now part of \\"China\\" (Dulimbai Gurun) in a Manchu memorial.Dunnell 2004, p. 77.Dunnell 2004, p. 83.Elliott 2001, p. 503. The Qing ideology of unification portrayed the \\"outer\\" non-Han Chinese like the Mongols, Oirats, and Tibetans together with the \\"inner\\" Han Chinese as \\"one family\\" united in the Qing state. The Qing described the phrase \\"Zhong Wai Yi Jia\\" (‰∏≠Â§ñ‰∏ÄÂÆ∂) or \\"Nei Wai Yi Jia\\" (ÂÖßÂ§ñ‰∏ÄÂÆ∂, \\"interior and exterior as one family\\"), to convey this idea of \\"unification\\" to different peoples.Dunnell 2004, pp. 76‚Äì77.

Culture The Oirats converted to Tibetan Buddhism in 1615. Oirat society was similar to other nomadic societies. It was heavily dependent on animal husbandry but also practiced limited agriculture. After the conquest of the Yarkent Khanate in 1680, they used people from the Tarim Basin as slave labour to cultivate land in Dzungaria. The Dzungar economy and industry was fairly complex for a nomadic society. They had iron, copper, and silver mines producing raw ore, which the Dzungars made into weapons and shields, including even firearms, bullets, and other utensils. Dzungar weaponry included a fair amount of gunpowder weaponry. In 1762, the Qing army discovered four large Dzungar bronze cannons, eight \\"soaring\\" cannons, and 10,000 shells. In 1640, the Oirats created an Oirat Mongol Legal Code which regulated the tribes and gave support to the Gelug Yellow Hat sect. Erdeni Batur assisted Zaya Pandita in creating the Clear Script.

It is an expansion of an art installation in the sense that it includes the sound element and therefore the time element. The main difference with a sound sculpture is that a sound installation has a three-dimensional space and the axes with which the different sound objects are being organized are not exclusively internal to the work, but also external. A work of art is an installation only if it makes a dialog with the surrounding space. A sound installation is usually a site- specific but sometimes it can be readapted to other spaces. It can be made either in closed or open spaces, and context is fundamental to determine how a sound installation will be aesthetically perceived. The difference between a regular art installation and a sound installation is that the later one has the time element, which gives the visiting public the possibility to stay a longer time due possible curiosity over the development of sound. This temporal factor also gives the audience the excuse to explore the space thoroughly due to the dispositions of the different sounds in space. Sound installations sometimes use interactive art technology (computers, sensors, mechanical and kinetic devices, etc.) but we also find this type of art form using only sound sources placed in different space points (like speakers), or acoustic music instruments materials like piano strings that are played by a performer or by the public (see Paul Panhuysen). In the context of museums, this combination of interactive technology and multichannel speaker distributions is sometimes referred to as sound scenography. Sound structure in sound installations #The simplest sound form is a repeating sound loop. This is mostly used in ambient art, and in this case the sound is not the determinant factor of the art work. #The most used sound structure is the open form, since the public can decide to experience a sound installation for just a few minutes or for a longer period of time. This obliges the artist to construct a sound organization that is capable of working well in both of the two cases. #There is also the possibility to have a linear sound structure, where sound develops in the same way as in a musical composition. In this case, the artist might risk not having the audience staying for the whole length of the sound.

Most of their music is standard rock or pop with heavy comedic elements. They are best known for their 1978 song \\"Fish Heads\\". History Robert Haimer and Bill Mumy were childhood friends who occasionally performed together on their musical instruments. Following the ending of Mumy's role on the TV series Lost in Space, they shot short films with a Super 8 motion picture camera, dubbed \\"Art Films\\". The two began calling each other \\"Art\\" in joking reference to these films. They formed the band Barnes & Barnes in 1970. They started when they were about 16 with a two track recorder, making goofy tracks, never meant to be shared. Their surname Barnes was taken from a Bill Cosby comedy routine called \\"Revenge\\", in which a character called Junior Barnes throws a slushball at Cosby as a child. Originally, both Haimer and Mumy were named \\"Art Barnes\\", but Haimer's alter ego was publicly renamed \\"Artie\\" in 1979 to differentiate between them. They first received airplay on The Dr. Demento Show in 1978. Halmer was a fan of the show and convinced Mumy to \\"pick a couple of songs and do them right\\" to send in, the results being their songs \\"Boogie Woogie Amputee\\" and \\"Fish Heads\\" which they re-did on a Teac four track machine. The latter recording was released as a single on their own Lumania Records in 1979 and remains their best-known song, as well as the most requested song in the history of The Dr. Demento Show. In 1978, Damaskas and Barnes & Barnes recorded \\"A Day in the Life of Green Acres,\\" a song that combined the music of The Beatles \\"A Day in the Life\\" with the lyrics to the theme song of the television show Green Acres. It was inspired by Little Roger and the Goosebumps' similar intertwining of Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" and the theme to Gilligan's Island.

Piero di Cosimo de' Medici (the Gouty), (Italian: Piero \\"il Gottoso\\") (1416 - 2 December 1469) was the de facto ruler of Florence from 1464 to 1469, during the Italian Renaissance. Biography Piero was the son of Cosimo de' Medici the Elder and Contessina de' Bardi. During his father's life, he did not play an extensive role due to his perpetual poor health, the source of his nickname. His brother Giovanni was named as Cosimo's executor, but predeceased his father. In 1461, Piero was the last Medici elected to the office of Gonfaloniere. His gout often kept him confined to bed. This meant that his bedroom effectively became his office, where he would conduct political meetings. This led to the Medici palace becoming the seat of government in Florence. Cast of an original bust of Piero Upon taking over the Medici bank from his father, Piero had a financial overview prepared. The results led him to call up a number of long-standing loans, many to various Medici supporters, which his father had let stand. This immediately drove a good number of the merchants involved into bankruptcy and added to the ranks of those who opposed the Medici. Although not as brilliant a banker as his father, he was able to keep things running smoothly during his tenure. His time as leader of Florence was marked by an attempted coup led by Luca Pitti, Niccol√≤ Soderini, Diotisalvi Neroni, Angelo Acciaiuoli and his cousin Pierfrancesco de' Medici, who used troops provided by Borso d'Este, Duke of Modena and Reggio, and commanded by his brother Ercole d'Este, planned for 26 August 1466. Piero was warned by Giovanni II Bentivoglio and was able to escape the coup, in part because his son Lorenzo discovered a road-block set up by the conspirators to capture Piero in his trip toward the Medici Villa di Careggi; he was not recognized and was able to warn his father. The coup failed, as did an attempted repeat backed by Venice, using troops commanded by Bartolomeo Colleoni. It has been argued that the \\"coup\\" was in fact a legitimate attempt to limit the power of the Medici faction and restore a system of government in keeping with Florence's traditional republican ideals, and that to refer to it as a \\"coup\\" or a \\"conspiracy\\" legitimizes Piero's de facto and hereditary (but wholly unconstitutional) status as leader of the city. In 1467, Piero had to face a war against the Republic of Venice prompted by the Florentine support given to Galeazzo Maria Sforza, the new duke of Milan. However, the Venetian army under Colleoni was defeated at the Battle of Molinella by a league of Florence, Naples, the Papal States and Milan. He also continued the family's tradition of artistic patronage, including Gozzoli's fresco Procession of the Magi in the Palazzo Medici Riccardi (in which are also present both of Piero's sons, Lorenzo and Giuliano, as well as Piero himself). His taste was more eclectic than that of his father, extending to Dutch and Flemish artworks. He continued to collect rare books, adding many to the Medici collections. He died in 1469 as a result of gout and lung disease and is buried in the Church of San Lorenzo, next to his brother Giovanni. The tomb, created by Andrea del Verrocchio, was commissioned by his sons Lorenzo and Giuliano. Marriage and Issue On 3 June 1444, Piero married Lucrezia Tornabuoni (1427‚Äì1482). Their children include Lorenzo the Magnificent and Giuliano de' Medici. All his family is likely portrayed in the famous painting by Botticelli known as the Madonna of the Magnificat, in which Lucrezia Tornabuoni appears as the Virgin Mary. In all, Lucrezia gave birth to five children: * Maria di Piero (it) (died before 1473) - married Leonetto Rossi and was the mother of Cardinal Luigi de' Rossi (it). *Bianca (10 September 1445-1505) - married Guglielmo Pazzi *Lucrezia \\"Nannina\\" (1447-1493) *Lorenzo the Magnificent (1449-1492) *Giuliano (1453-1478) Fictional Depictions A young Piero is portrayed by Alessandro Sperduti in the 2016 television series Medici: Masters of Florence. An older Piero is portrayed by Julian Sands in the second season, Medici: The Magnificent.

Because of its connections with both agency and incentives, contract theory is often categorized within a field known as Law and economics. One prominent application of it is the design of optimal schemes of managerial compensation. In the field of economics, the first formal treatment of this topic was given by Kenneth Arrow in the 1960s. In 2016, Oliver Hart and Bengt R. Holmstr√∂m both received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for their work on contract theory, covering many topics from CEO pay to privatizations. A standard practice in the microeconomics of contract theory is to represent the behaviour of a decision maker under certain numerical utility structures, and then apply an optimization algorithm to identify optimal decisions. Such a procedure has been used in the contract theory framework to several typical situations, labeled moral hazard, adverse selection and signalling. The spirit of these models lies in finding theoretical ways to motivate agents to take appropriate actions, even under an insurance contract. The main results achieved through this family of models involve: mathematical properties of the utility structure of the principal and the agent, relaxation of assumptions, and variations of the time structure of the contract relationship, among others. It is customary to model people as maximizers of some von Neumann‚ÄìMorgenstern utility functions, as stated by expected utility theory. Main models of agency problems =Moral hazard= In moral hazard models, the information asymmetry is the principal's inability to observe and/or verify the agent's action. Performance-based contracts that depend on observable and verifiable output can often be employed to create incentives for the agent to act in the principal's interest. When agents are risk-averse, however, such contracts are generally only second-best because incentivization precludes full insurance. The typical moral hazard model is formulated as follows. The principal solves: :\\\\max_{w(\\\\cdot)} E\\\\left[ y(\\\\hat{e}) - w(y(\\\\hat{e}))\\\\right] subject to the agent's \\"individual rationality (IR)\\" constraint, :E\\\\left[u( w( y(e) ) ) - c(e)\\\\right] \\\\geq \\\\bar{u} and the agent's \\"incentive compatibility (IC)\\" constraint, : E \\\\left[ u(w(y(\\\\hat{e}))) - c(\\\\hat{e}) \\\\right] \\\\geq E \\\\left[ u(w(y(e))) - c(e) \\\\right] \\\\ \\\\forall e, where w(\\\\cdot) is the wage as a function of output y, which in turn is a function of effort:e. c(e) represents the cost of effort, and reservation utility is given by \\\\bar{u}. u(\\\\cdot) is the \\"utility function\\", which is concave for the risk- averse agent, is convex for the risk-prone agent, and is linear for the risk- neutral agent. If the agent is risk-neutral and there are no bounds on transfer payments, the fact that the agent's effort is unobservable (i.e., it is a \\"hidden action\\") does not pose a problem. In this case, the same outcome can be achieved that would be attained with verifiable effort: The agent chooses the so-called \\"first-best\\" effort level that maximizes the expected total surplus of the two parties. Specifically, the principal can give the realized output to the agent, but let the agent make a fixed up-front payment. The agent is then a \\"residual claimant\\" and will maximize the expected total surplus minus the fixed payment. Hence, the first-best effort level maximizes the agent's payoff, and the fixed payment can be chosen such that in equilibrium the agent's expected payoff equals his or her reservation utility (which is what the agent would get if no contract was written). Yet, if the agent is risk-averse, there is a trade-off between incentives and insurance. Moreover, if the agent is risk-neutral but wealth-constrained, the agent cannot make the fixed up-front payment to the principal, so the principal must leave a \\"limited liability rent\\" to the agent (i.e., the agent earns more than his or her reservation utility). The moral hazard model with risk aversion was pioneered by Steven Shavell, Sanford J. Grossman, Oliver D. Hart, and others in the 1970s and 1980s. It has been extended to the case of repeated moral hazard by William P. Rogerson and to the case of multiple tasks by Bengt Holmstr√∂m and Paul Milgrom. The moral hazard model with risk-neutral but wealth-constrained agents has also been extended to settings with repeated interaction and multiple tasks. While it is difficult to test models with hidden action empirically (since there is no field data on unobservable variables), the premise of contract theory that incentives matter has been successfully tested in the field. Moreover, contract-theoretic models with hidden actions have been directly tested in laboratory experiments. =Adverse selection= In adverse selection models, the principal is not informed about a certain characteristic of the agent at the time the contract is written. The characteristic is called the agent's \\"type\\". For example, health insurance is more likely to be purchased by people who are more likely to get sick. In this case, the agent's type is his or her health status, which is privately known by the agent. Another prominent example is public procurement contracting: The government agency (the principal) does not know the private firm's cost. In this case, the private firm is the agent and the agent's type is the cost level. In adverse selection models, there is typically too little trade (i.e., there is a so-called \\"downward distortion\\" of the trade level compared to a \\"first-best\\" benchmark situation with complete information), except when the agent is of the best possible type (which is known as the \\"no distortion at the top\\" property). The principal offers a menu of contracts to the agent; the menu is called \\"incentive-compatible\\" if the agent picks the contract that was designed for his or her type. In order to make the agent reveal the true type, the principal has to leave an information rent to the agent (i.e., the agent earns more than his or her reservation utility, which is what the agent would get if no contract was written). Adverse selection theory has been pioneered by Roger Myerson, Eric Maskin, and others in the 1980s. More recently, adverse selection theory has been tested in laboratory experiments and in the field. Adverse selection theory has been expanded in several directions, e.g. by endogenizing the information structure (so the agent can decide whether or not to gather private information) and by taking into consideration social preferences and bounded rationality. Incomplete contracts Contract theory also utilizes the notion of a complete contract, which is thought of as a contract that specifies the legal consequences of every possible state of the world. More recent developments known as the theory of incomplete contracts, pioneered by Oliver Hart and his coauthors, study the incentive effects of parties' inability to write complete contingent contracts, e.g. concerning relationship-specific investments. A leading application of the incomplete contracting paradigm is the Grossman-Hart-Moore property rights approach to the theory of the firm (see Hart, 1995). Because it would be impossibly complex and costly for the parties to an agreement to make their contract complete,Hart, Oliver and Moore, John, 1988. \\"Incomplete Contracts and Renegotiation,\\" Econometrica, 56(4), pp. 755‚Äì785. the law provides default rules which fill in the gaps in the actual agreement of the parties. During the last 20 years, much effort has gone into the analysis of dynamic contracts. Important early contributors to this literature include, among others, Edward J. Green, Stephen Spear, and Sanjay Srivastava. Examples * George Akerlof described adverse selection in the market for used cars. * In certain models, such as Michael Spence's job-market model, the agent can signal his type to the principal which may help to resolve the problem.

He later amassed a large fortune as a ship- owner, from privateering, commerce,Alain Roman; summary on Robert Surcouf , www.netmarine.net and illegal slave trade, and as a landowner. Surcouf started his career as a sailor and officer on the slave ships Aurore, Courrier d'Afrique and Navigateur. Having risen to captain, and in spite of the prohibition of slave trading by the National Convention in 1793, he engaged in the business himself as a captain on Cr√©ole. He then captained the merchantman √âmilie, on which he engaged in commerce raiding despite lacking a letter of marque. He preyed on British shipping, capturing the East Indiaman Triton, before returning to √éle de France in the Indian Ocean, where his prizes were confiscated. He then returned to France, where he obtained prize money from the government. Returning to the Indian Ocean, Surcouf captained the privateers Clarisse and Confiance, raiding British, American, and Portuguese merchantmen. He captured the East Indiaman on 7 October 1800. Returning to France, he was awarded the Legion of Honour and settled as a ship-owner. He briefly returned to the Indian Ocean in 1807 on the custom-built Revenant before returning to France. There, he armed privateers and merchantmen. His privateers led successful campaigns against British trade in the Indian Ocean and disastrous ones in the English Channel, except for Renard. This cutter achieved fame in her very costly victory over on 9 September 1812 which exploded after repulsing French attempts at boarding. There were many casualties. After the Bourbon restoration, he organised fishing expeditions to Newfoundland and amassed a considerable fortune. He died in 1827 and is buried in a graveyard at Saint-Malo. Career =Youth= Robert Surcouf was born 12 December 1773 in Saint-Malo to a family of ship-owners.Levot, p. 493 His father, Charles-Ange Surcouf de Boisgris, was the grandson of Robert Surcouf de Maisonneuve,Cunat, p.145 who had captained the privateer Aimable during the reign of Louis XIV.Cunat, p.390 On his mother's side, Robert was a distant relative of Ren√© Duguay-Trouin.Hennequin, p.378 When his parents sent him to Dinan college to become a priest, he fled at age thirteen to enlist on the merchantman H√©ron, which shuttled between Saint-Malo and Cadiz.Granier, p.216 On 3 March 1789, he enlisted as a volunteer on the 700-ton Aurore, under Captain Tardivet, a slave ship bound for India. Aurore sailed to Pondicherry and ferried troops bound for Isle de France. On her next journey, seeking to purchase slaves on the Horn of Africa, Aurore was wrecked in the Mozambique Channel, drowning 400 black slaves chained in the orlop. Tardivet chartered the Portuguese San Antoine in October 1790 to return to Port-Louis, but had to divert to Sumatra because of the weather, and only returned to Port-Louis in late 1790, on a French ship via the French colony of Pondicherry. Promoted to officer, Surcouf enlisted on the Courrier d'Afrique, another slave ship, bound for Mozambique under Captain Garnier. Captain Tardivet then brought him over as Lieutenant on his new ship, Revanche.Levot, p. 494 On Revanche, Surcouf made several expeditions off Madagascar. Surcouf enlisted as a helmsman on the French Royal Navy's 20-gun fluyt Bienvenue, under Lieutenant Haumont,Roche, p.74 bound for France.Cunat, p.391 Bienvenue arrived at Lorient on 2 January 1792, where Surcouf discovered the political changes France had undergone in the wake of the French Revolution. After six months, Surcouf enlisted as a lieutenant on the slave ship Navigateur, under Captain Lejoliff. She departed on 27 August 1792 for Mozambique before sailing to Isle de France, where Surcouf was informed on his arrival of the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. Rising to the rank of captain, Surcouf took command of the brig Cr√©ole, a four-gun slave ship. He departed Isle de France on 3 June 1794 for a journey off Africa and Madagascar, and engaged again in slave trading, even though it had been prohibited by the National Convention and the Assembly of √éle Bourbon.Granier, p.217. Upon his return to Isle de France, agents of the Committee of Public Safety inspected Cr√©ole for evidence of slave trading, but left empty-handed as Surcouf had already sold his slaves. When British naval forces arrived to blockade the Isle de France, he served as an auxiliary ensign on the 40-gun frigate Cyb√®le and participated in the inconclusive Action of 22 October 1794. =Cruise of √âmilie and capture of Triton= Cruise of √âmilie: from Port-Louis (Mauritius) to the Seychelles via La R√©union, on to Sumatra, the Gulf of Bengal, and return to Port-Louis. In the spring in 1795, Surcouf took command of the 180-ton, privateer schooner Modeste, renamed √âmilie, with a 32-man crew and four 6-pounder guns, armed by Malroux and Levaillant.Cunat, p.392 Governor Malartic refused to provide a lettre de marque and ordered √âmilie to go to the Seychelles to purchase tortoises as food for Isle de France. √âmilie departed on 3 September 1795 with a cong√© de navigation authorising her to defend herself, but not to take prizes as a privateer. The next day, she made a port call at Saint-Denis before cruising to Mah√©. At Sainte Anne Island, two large British ships chased him, but he was able to evade them by sailing through the reefs, at night. Surcouf then decided to sail to the Mergui Archipelago to load a rice cargo.Cunat, p.393 On 8 December 1795, while in transit, cruising off the Ganges Delta,Rouvier, p.254 Surcouf captured his first prize, the ship Penguin, loaded with lumber, on which he detached a prize crew under Lieutenant P√©ru before sending her to Isle de France. On 19 January 1796, Surcouf met the pilot ship Cartier leading two merchantmen, the Russel and Sambolasse, through the Ganges delta. He attacked and captured them, finding the merchantmen to be carrying rice. After detaching prize crews, Surcouf transferred his command, along with his remaining 22 crew members and √âmilies four guns, to Cartier, which (according to Ambroise Louis Garneray) he renamed Hasard. Surcouf then sent √âmilie, under Lieutenant Croizet, together with his prizes, to Isle de France.Cunat, p.394 On the night of 28 January, Surcouf captured the 12-gun Diana, loaded with 6000 bags of rice.Rouvier, p.252 The next day, Cartier met a 26-gun Indiaman, Triton, armed with 12-pounders and a 150-man crew; having decided to attack, and recognising only too late the overwhelming superiority of his opponent, Surcouf, feeling threatened and unable to flee, decided to board her with his 26 men. After haranguing his men, he approached under a British flag,Rouvier, p.253 before hoisting French colours at the very last moment and launching a violent assault.Cunat, p.395 In the ensuing 45-minute battle, Triton suffered 5 wounded and 10 killed,Hennequin, p.380 including her captain, Captain Burnycat, and the first officer, Picket; The prisoners were transferred to Diana, which Surcouf released against a 30,000 rupee ransom.Granier, p.218 Surcouf returned to Ile de France with his prizes, where he arrived on 10 March 1796, although Hasard was captured by HMS Victorious on the journey back.Demerliac, p. 309, no 2915 As √âmilie had been armed as a merchant rather than a privateer, the Prize court seized her prizes and sold them for the benefit of the State, although their capture was declared to be legal. Surcouf returned to France to claim his prize money, and on 3 September 1797, the government finally granted him 660,000 francs, of which he only received 80,000.

Painting by L√©on Tr√©misot. =Cruise of Clarisse= First cruise with Clarisse and battle of Susoh. In early 1798, after 14 months in Paris, Surcouf took command of Clarisse, a 14-gun privateer brig armed with four 12-pounders, ten 8-pounders, and manned by a 120-strong complement.Rouvier, p.447 He departed from Paimboeuf, Nantes, in February 1798,Cunat, p.396 this time with a proper lettre de marque. During the journey to Isle de France, Clarisse chased a British slave ship, which escaped after one of her shots cut off Clarisse 's foremast tops.Levot, p. 495 Surcouf captured a British brig South of Cape of Good Hope, which surrendered after a warning shot was fired, on which he sent a prize crew under Captain Dujardin, and arrived La R√©union on 5 December. In early 1799, Surcouf sailed to the city of SusohGranier, p.223Hennequin, p.381 in Aceh, on Sumatra, where he found two 20-gun merchantmen anchored in the harbour, in the process of loading pepper; Clarisse dropped anchor close by and opened fire, after which Surcouf sent his older brother Nicolas to head a 20-man board party on Clarisse 's boats and board the largest of the ships, while he boarded her with Clarisse from the opposite side; assaulted from two sides, she surrendered after a 30-minute battle.Hennequin, p.382 The other ship cut her anchor and attempted to flee, but the boats of Clarisse overhauled and captured her without resistance, most of her crew being ashore. Surcouf returned to √éle de France with his prizes in June. Second cruise with Clarisse On 16 August, Clarisse departed Isle de France for another cruise; she sailed to La R√©union carrying despatches of Malartic to the governor. She then cruised to Java to procure water,Rouvier, p.448 where she arrived on 27 September.Cunat, p.397 On 1 October, Surcouf captured a Danish merchantman, which he sent away under Lieutenant Fonroc; on 4 November, the Portuguese merchantman Nostra Signora de la Conception carrying 116 000 piastres;Granier, p.224 on 6, a British ship laden with a salt; and on 11 November, the 20-gun Auspicious, with a cargo worth 1,032,580 francs. Surcouf sailed to Mergui to purchase food and free his prisoners, and put to sail on 10 December. En route, he met the fellow French privateer Malartic, under Jean Dutertre; soon after, the privateers met a British frigate, 38-gun frigate HMS Sybille, which gave chase and which Surcouf managed to outsail by throwing eight guns overboard, along with various other implements. On 1 January 1800, Clarisse captured a large rice-laden merchantman, the British James. On 3 January, she detected two American 16-carronade ships forming a line of battle; although Clarisse lacked the eight guns sacrificed to escape Sybille and 60 of her men detached on her various prizes, Surcouf engaged.Rouvier, p.449 Clarisse raked the rear-most ship, the Louisa, and boarded her, while simultaneously firing a broadside on the other ship, Mercury, which attempted to rescue her mate. Nicolas Surcouf led a 30-man boarding party to seize Louisa, while Mercury escaped. Clarisse could not give chase, her bowsprit having been destroyed in the collision with Louisa.Hennequin, p.383 Nicolas Surcouf took a prize crew and sailed Louisa back to Port Louis.Austen (1935), pp.93‚Äì94. Clarisse continued her patrol, capturing the ships Catherine, Haderbux, Anna Maria, Nostra Signora de la Cruz, Louis, Janna, Notre Dame de Bon Succ√®s and Albion, before sailing back to Isle de France with her prizes. She arrived in early February 1800. =Cruise of Confiance and capture of Kent= Cruise of Confiance In May 1800, Surcouf took command of Confiance, a fast 18-gun brig from Bordeaux, with a 150-man complement; the competition with Dutertre for the captainship of Confiance almost degenerated into a duel, and Governor Malartic had to intervene to prevent it, stating that such a confrontation would be \\"an English victory\\".Granier, p.219 The sailor and painter Ambroise Louis Garneray, future biographer of Surcouf, enlisted at this time. In late April 1800, Confiance cruised off Sunda Strait, where she captured an American ship; she then left the strait to avoid the frigate ,Robert Surcouf, ageofsail.wordpress.com which was known to cruise in these waters, and sailed to the Seychelles. There, he escaped a British ship of the line and a frigate, and sailed on to cruise the Bay of Bengal.Rouvier, p.526 On 19 September, Confiance captured Prize, from Calcutta, which had stored eight of her ten guns in her hold to improve her stability. Prize was sent off to Mauritius on the next day with an 85-man prize crew.Asiatic Annual Register, Volume 3, p.39 Surcouf then steered for Ganjam, where he captured three smaller ships.Asiatic Annual Register, Volume 3, p.40 On 7 October 1800, off Sand Heads, near Calcutta, Confiance met the 40-gun East Indiaman Kent, of 824 tons burthen,Norman p.353Biden p.212 under Captain Robert Rivington. Kent had rescued the crew of another ship, Queen,Laughton, p.439 destroyed by fire, and therefore had an exceptionally large complement of 437 men, including her passengers; 300 of them were soldiers and sailors; Surcouf managed to board his larger opponent and, after over an hour and a halfLaughton, p.438 of battle across the decks of the ship,Laughton, p.440 seize control of the Kent.Laughton, p.441 The British had suffered fourteen killed, including the captain, and forty-four wounded, while the French suffered five killed and ten wounded.Hennequin, p.384 The privateers were then granted one hour of free pillaging on Kent before Surcouf restored order;Hennequin (p.385) states that the effects of the prisoners were returned to them when he had them transferred on Confiance. however, the female passengers were strictly protected and sentries were placed in front of their apartments.Laughton, p.442 Amongst the prisoners were General Frederick St. John and his wife, Arabella Craven.ST. JOHN, Hon. Frederick (1765‚Äì1844), of Chailey, Sussex., The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1790‚Äì1820, ed. R. Thorne, 1986 The first officer of Confiance, Joachim Drieux, was sent on Kent with a 60-man prize crew, while her passengers were released on a merchantman that Surcouf stopped a few days later.Rouvier, p.527 Confiance and Kent arrived at the Rade des Pavillons in Port-Louis in November.Cunat, p.398 The capture of Kent became a sensation, and the British Admiralty issued a reward for the capture of Surcouf. After her return to Ile de France, Confiance was armed as a merchantman en aventurier with an 89-man crew and loaded with colonial goods for her return to France. On the journey, Surcouf still managed to capture a number of ships, notably the Portuguese Ebre, with eighteen 12-pounder carronades and a 60-man crew; he released her against a ransom of 10,000 piastres and after exchanging her greatmast with that of Confiance. Upon her return, Confiance ran into the British blockade and was chased by a frigate; Surcouf managed to evade her by throwing overboard all but one of her guns, his boats, anchors, chains and even components of his masts. He eventually arrived at La RochelleCunat, p.399Hennequin, p.385 on 13 April 1801. In France, Navy Minister Truguet attempted to enrol Surcouf in the Navy as an auxiliary officer, which he declined. Hennequin states that Bonaparte himself offered him the rank of Captain and the command of two frigates, which Surcouf declined for fear of losing his freedom of action, and awarded him a Sabre of honour. Surcouf was awarded the Legion of Honour at the founding of the Order, on 19 May 1802.

Around 1805, Surcouf started to arm privateers in Saint- Malo in partnership with his father-in-law Louis Blaize de Maisonneuve,Granier, p.221 notably Caroline which captured four ships in the Indian Ocean under Nicolas Surcouf;Gallois, vol.2, p.302 Marsouin; and Confiance, which took two prizes under Joseph Potier.Gallois, vol.2, p.302‚Äì303 =Cruise of Revenant= Cruise of Revenant. After a five-year retirement, in early 1807, Surcouf ordered the 18-gun Revenant, a privateer which he had built on his own specifications. On 2 March, he departed Saint-Malo with a 192-man crew to cruise off Bengal. On 9 March 1807, while en route, off Madeira, Revenant captured the British slave ship Aun,Granier, p.225 of sixteen 12-pounders, recently departed from Liverpool,Hennequin, p.386 which Surcouf let go for a ransom, after throwing her guns overboard, wetting her gunpowder and destroying some of her sails. Surcouf arrived at √éle de France in June, slipping past the British blockade and capturing several ships on the journey. During the subsequent campaign, which was to be his last, Surcouf captured 16 British merchantmen, partly because they tended to strike their colours as soon as they realised their opponent was Surcouf.Fonds Marine, p. 362 The arrival of Surcouf at Isle de France did not go unnoticed: the authorities and the population reacted with enthusiasm, while British insurance companies on Calcutta doubled the reward for his capture, which amounted to one rupee lake, or 250,000 francs.Hennequin, p.387 On 3 September 1807, Revenant departed to cruise off Bengal. On 25 September, she captured the British 12-gun Trafalgar carrying 10,000 bags of rice, and the 14-gun Mangles, carrying 11,000; on the 27th, the 12-gun Admiral Applin, with 9,500 bags of rice; on 1 October, the 1-gun Suzannah, with 5,500 bags of rice; on the 19th, the wood-laden Success, which was burnt; on the 30th, the 12-gun Fortune, which carried no cargo and was sunk; on 15 November, the Indian Macauly; on 18 December, the British 10-gun Sir William Burroughs; on the 30th, the Portuguese Oriente; and on 6 January 1808, the Arab Jem lab Dim. Surcouf sent these with prize crews to Isle de France, and then returned himself on 31 January 1808. When a British captive officer taunted Surcouf with the words \\"You French fight for money while we fight for honour\\", Surcouf replied \\"Each of us fights for what he lacks most\\".Stephen Taylor, \\"Storm and Conquest: The Battle for the Indian Ocean, 1808‚Äì10\\" Isabelle Tombs,Robert Tombs, \\"That Sweet Enemy: The British and the French from the Sun King to the Present\\", p.262 Surcouf then gave command of Revenant to his first officer, Joseph Potier. After a short cruise, Potier returned with a 34-gun prize of the Portuguese East India Company, the Conce√ß√°o de Santo Antonio,Lepelley, p.7 captured after a one-hour fight.Cunant, p.400 On 4 July 1808, General Charles Decaen, governor of Isle de France. requisitioned Revenant.Fonds Marine, p. 377 She was renamed I√©na, and commissioned under Lieutenant Morice, with Lieutenant de vaisseau Albin Roussin as second officer. Surcouf had an altercation with Decaen but had to renounce his ship. He eventually purchased S√©millante, which he renamed Charles. Returning with this vessel to Saint- Malo, he arrived on 4 February 1809. =Late life= Portrait of Surcouf during his business career From 1809, Surcouf went into business as ship- owner, and over the years, he equipped a number of privateers: , under Pelletier;Gallois, vol.2, p.306 Dorade; Biscayenne; √âdouard; Espadon; Ville- de-Caen; and his last, , under Leroux. The British captured all the privateers sent into the Channel, with the exception of Renard. Surcouf also built the brig Fant√¥me at St. Malo in 1809. Surcouf dispatched Fant√¥me to Isle de France (Mauritius) in the Indian Ocean on her first voyage where the brig took three prizes but was captured by the British in 1810 and commissioned into British service as HMS Fantome. In January 1814, Surcouf was made a colonel in the National Guard of Saint-Malo. During the Hundred Days, he served as a chief of Legion and maintained order. He resigned after the Battle of Waterloo and became a merchant, arming 19 merchantmenCunat, p.401 and establishing business with Newfoundland. Between 1814 and 1827, Surcouf organised over 116 commercial expeditions. In 1815, Surcouf engaged in slave trade, commissioning the ship Africain to ferry slaves from Gabon. Africain conducted another slave trading journey in 1819. Four other expeditions are also suspected of having been slaving runs: that of Marie-Anne in 1819, Adolphe in 1820, and in 1821 Victor and Adolphe, under Ren√© Decaen and with D√©sir√© Surcouf as first officer, which sailed under the pretence of sailing to Isle Bourbon (now R√©union), but actually to ferry slaves to Cuba and Philadelphia. Surcouf died on 8 July 1827, and was buried in Saint-Malo graveyard with military honours.Cunat, p.402 His tomb features a globe showing the Indian Ocean and an anchor,Granier, p.228 with the epitaph: Legacy Five ships of the French Navy were named after Surcouf: a steam aviso (sloop); an armoured cruiser; a submarine cruiser, which at the time of her launch the largest submarine in the world. The submarine joined the Free French Naval Forces during the Second World War and disappeared mysteriously after liberating Saint-Pierre and Miquelon. Surcouf was a large fleet escort destroyer, which was severely damaged in a collision with a Soviet ship and the modern stealth frigate, one of the first stealth combat ships.Les b√¢timents ayant port√© le nom de Surcouf , netmarine File:Saint-Malo - Surcouf et le Fort National crop.jpgStatue of Surcouf in Saint-Malo by Alfred Caravaniez, inaugurated on 6 July 1903 File:Surcouf 1858P 400.jpgThe aviso Surcouf (1858) File:Surcouf FRA.jpgThe submarine cruiser Surcouf (N N 3, 1929‚Äì1942) File:EE Surcouf D621.jpgThe fleet escort destroyer Surcouf (1953‚Äì1972) File:FS Surcouf.jpgThe stealth frigate Surcouf (1997‚Äìpresent day) A number of legends have grown around Surcouf, he is often stated to have been made a Baron of the Empire, which is untrue. Another legend states that Surcouf had thrown overboard gold seized on Kent but Kent did not carry gold. There is a tale that in 1816, Surcouf challenged twelve Prussian officers to a duel and defeated all of them except for the last, which he let go \\"to tell in his country how a former soldier of Napoleon fights\\"; this story is a fabrication.M.

USS Essex was a 1000-ton ironclad river gunboat of the United States Army and later United States Navy during the American Civil War. It was named for Essex County, Massachusetts. USS Essex was originally constructed in 1856 at New Albany, Indiana as a steam-powered ferry named New Era. Service in Tennessee In September 1861 New Era was purchased by the United States Army for use in its Western Gunboat Flotilla and was modified into a 355-ton timberclad gunboat. In November 1861 USS New Era took part in an expedition up the Cumberland River. Shortly thereafter she was renamed USS Essex and received an upgrade to iron armor and various other alterations. On 11 January 1862, USS Essex engaged Confederate States Navy gunboats near Lucas Bend, Missouri. On 6 February 1862, she took part in the attack on Fort Henry, Tennessee and was badly damaged by Confederate gunfire. Battling the CSS Arkansas CSS Arkansas running through the Union fleet above Vicksburg, Mississippi, 15 July 1862 Commanding officer William D. Porter upgraded his ship without official authorization into an ironclad gunboat. Under his orders she was lengthened, widened, and completely reengineered, and her appearance was changed drastically. New, more powerful, engines were put in place and she was rearmored. After her upgrade Essex took part in operations near Vicksburg, Mississippi. On 15 July 1862, USS Essex was engaged with CSS Arkansas as that ship successfully ran past the Union fleets in front of the city. On 23 July, Essex unsuccessfully attacked the Arkansas at her moorings but was repelled by the Arkansas and the shore guns under whose protection the Arkansas lay. Federal forces withdrew from Vicksburg shortly thereafter. After withdrawing, Essex joined Admiral David Farragut's squadron and was the only Federal ironclad on the lower Mississippi River. On 5 August 1862, Essex helped repel a Confederate Army attack on Baton Rouge, Louisiana. On 6 August, the Essex once again engaged CSS Arkansas as that vessel attempted to relieve the beleaguered Confederates attacking Baton Rouge. As Essex approached, the steering mechanism of the Arkansas jammed and her crew was forced to scuttle her due to the presence of the Essex. Transfer to the Navy In October 1862 the Essex was transferred from the Army to the United States Navy. She was involved in the bombardment of Port Hudson, Louisiana and assisted during the occupation of Baton Rouge. In May‚ÄìJuly 1863 under the command of Robert Townsend she participated in the siege and capture of Port Hudson. USS Essex took part in the Red River Campaign of March‚ÄìMay 1864. In December 1864, the USS Essex was in Memphis, Tennessee. According to David Redrick, the Rear Admiral's cook, some of the boat's crew \\"slipped ashore at night\\" and \\"got on a spree\\". Boatswain William Bernard Dolen, age 33, was part of a detail sent ashore to \\"arrest the boys\\". During the arrest, he was stabbed in the right chest by a fellow seaman, and was honorably discharged for disability due to the chronicity of the wound, from which he later died in 1878. After the war Essex was decommissioned in July 1865. She was sold in November 1865 and reverted to the civilian name New Era. She was scrapped in 1870. USS Essex had the reputation as one of the most active gunboats on the Mississippi River, despite her relatively weak armor. It often was damaged in actions.

Its original members are singer Jonathan Vance, guitarist Tonie Joy, bassist Monica DiGialleonardo, and drummer Mark Laurence. Alex Badertscher joined as second guitarist in 1990. Moss Icon is known as an early influence on the hardcore punk splinter genres known as post-hardcore, as well as for the eventual development of emo, although the band members themselves have denied knowingly contributing to the latter genre in any way. History and background =Formation to breakup= The band's identifying characteristics, and those that distinguished them from their contemporaries, included noticeable and abrupt transitions from loud to quiet, and Vance's esoteric, stream of conscious lyrical content. Earlier recordings of the band are reminiscent of early Joy Division, while later songs embodied a less blunt approach with more exploratory arrangements and riffage. Vance's lyrics touched upon vaguely, among other issues, the plight of indigenous peoples of the Americas, and opposed the U.S. government's involvement in Nicaragua and Guatemala. The band played frequently with fellow Annapolis band The Hated. Moss Icon recorded their debut 7\\", \\"Hate in Me\\", in January 1988, and entered the studio several months later to record their second 7\\", \\"Mahpiua Luta\\". Their Lyburnum Wits End Liberation Fly LP was recorded by Les Lentz (who engineered all of their studio recordings) throughout 1988 but was not released until mid-1994, three years after the band's break-up, by Vermiform Records. Moss Icon's third 7\\", entitled \\"Memorial\\", was recorded in January 1991 along with a split LP with Silver Bearing. In 1994 Ebullition Records released the It Disappears LP, compiling songs from \\"Memorial\\" with live versions of several songs. In 1990 a splinter project of Moss Icon was formed called Breathing Walker, containing all four members of Moss Icon plus Alex Badertscher on bass, Zak Fusciello on percussion, and Tim Horner on violin. Breathing Walker released a cassette that was re-released on vinyl and CD in 2001 by the Vermin Scum label, along with live tracks. =Post-breakup and 2001 reformation= After the dissolution of Moss Icon, guitarist Tonie Joy was a member of the bands Universal Order of Armageddon, Born Against, and The Convocation Of.... (later rechristened The Convocation). Other band members were less involved in music, excepting Laurence's drums in Lava, DiGialleonardo's Blue Condors, and Vance's solo debut LP. Moss Icon reunited to play two shows with Zak Fusciello on drums, one at the 2001 More Than Music Fest in Columbus, Ohio and the other at the renovated Charles Theatre in Baltimore, Maryland. =Recent activity= In July 2008, Moss Icon was named one of the \\"23 Bands Who Shaped Punk\\" by Alternative Press magazine in issue No. 240, released in July 2008. Vance's first officially released book Tulip Has a Room was published by Easysubcult. Since 2007 Joy, Vance, Zak Fusciello, and Alex Badertscher have been occasionally working on new material in Baltimore, MD for a possible new recording. A discography was released in May 2012 on Temporary Residence Limited which featured two discs, photos and lyrics. The band also played a couple live shows (NYC and Washington DC) in December 2014.

He was the youngest person to sign the United States Constitution and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, serving as its third Speaker, and later in the U.S. Senate. Dayton was arrested in 1807 for treason in connection with Aaron Burr's conspiracy. He was never tried, but his national political career never recovered. Biography =Early life= Dayton was born in Elizabethtown (now known as Elizabeth), New Jersey. He was the son of Elias Dayton, a merchant who was prominent in local politics and had served as a militia officer in the French and Indian War and his wife the former Hannah Rolfe. He graduated from the local academy, run by Tapping Reeve and Francis Barber, where he was classmates with Alexander Hamilton. He then attended the College of New Jersey (now known as Princeton University). He left college in 1775 to fight in the Revolution, and received an honorary degree in 1776. =Soldier= Dayton was 15 at the outbreak of the Revolutionary War in 1775 and served under his father (Elias) in the 3rd New Jersey Regiment as an ensign. On January 1, 1777, he was commissioned a lieutenant and served as paymaster. He saw service under Washington, fighting in the battles of Brandywine Creek and Germantown. He remained with Washington at Valley Forge and helped push the British from their position in New Jersey into the safety of New York City. In October 1780, Dayton and an uncle were captured by Loyalists, who held them captive for the winter before releasing them in the following year. Dayton again served under his father in the New Jersey Brigade. On March 30, 1780, at age 19, he was promoted to the rank of captain and transferred to the 2nd New Jersey Regiment, where he took part in the Battle of Yorktown. The Revolutionary War pension records indicate that he served as Aide-de-Camp to General Sullivan on his expedition against the Indians from May 1 ‚Äì November 30, 1779. On July 19, 1799, Dayton was offered a commission as Major General in the Provisional United States Army, but declined. At the close of the Revolutionary War, Dayton became one of the founding members of the Society of the Cincinnati in the State of New Jersey. =Career= After the war, Dayton studied law and created a practice, dividing his time between land speculation, law, and politics. After serving as a New Jersey delegate to the Continental Congress and Constitutional Convention (of which he was the youngest member, at age 26Abeka United States History: Heritage of Freedom, page 126), he became a prominent Federalist legislator. He was a member of the New Jersey General Assembly in 1786‚Äì1787, and again in 1790, and served in the New Jersey Legislative Council (now the New Jersey Senate) in 1789. Dayton was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1789, but he did not take his seat until he was chosen again in 1791. He served as speaker for the Fourth and Fifth Congresses. Like most Federalists, he supported the fiscal policies of Alexander Hamilton, and he helped organize the suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion. He supported the Louisiana Purchase and opposed the repeal of the Judiciary Act of 1801. Wealthy from his heavy investments in Ohio, where the city of Dayton would later be named after him, Dayton lent money to Aaron Burr, becoming involved by association in the alleged conspiracy in which Burr was accused of intending to conquer parts of what is now the Southwestern United States. Dayton was exonerated, but his association with Burr effectively ended his political career. Late life and family Dayton married Susan Williamson and had two daughters. Susan's Revolutionary War Pension Application W.6994 states that the marriage occurred on March 28, 1779. A supporting letter, written by Aaron Ogden, a captain in the New Jersey Brigade, states that he \\"was present at the marriage of the said Jonathan Dayton and Susan his wife; which marriage ceremony was performed by the Reverent Mr. Hoyt, a Presbyterian Clergyman... in the fore part of spring of the year seventeen hundred and seventy nine (1779) while the New Jersey Brigade lay at Elizabethtown in the Borough of Elizabeth and state of new Jersey.\\" After resuming his political career in New Jersey, Dayton died on October 9, 1824, in his hometown. He was interred in an unmarked grave that is now under the St. John's Episcopal Church in Elizabeth, which replaced an original church in 1860. Shortly before Dayton's death, Lafayette visited him, as reported in an obituary in the Columbian Centinel on October 20, 1824: \\"In New-Jersey, Hon. JONATHAN DAYTON, formerly Speaker of the House of Representatives of Congress, and a Hero of the Revolution. When the Nation's Guest lately passed New-Jersey, he passed the night with General Dayton, and such were the exertions of this aged and distinguished federalist, to honor the Guest, and gratify the wishes of his fellow citizens to see, that he sunk under them; and expired, without regret, a few days after.\\" Legacy The city of Dayton, Ohio, was named after Jonathan Dayton. While he never set foot in the area, he was a signatory to the Constitution and, at the time the city of Dayton was established in 1796, he owned (in partnership with Arthur St. Clair, James Wilkinson and Israel Ludlow) 250,000 acres (1,011 km¬≤) in the Great Miami River basin.Brief History of Dayton , Dayton, Ohio.

Not all tributaries are shown. The Yazoo River is a river in the U.S. states of Louisiana and Mississippi. It is considered by some to mark the southern boundary of what is called the Mississippi Delta, a broad floodplain that was cultivated for cotton plantations before the American Civil War. It has continued to be devoted to large-scale agriculture. History The Yazoo River was named by French explorer La Salle in 1682 as \\"Rivi√®re des Yazous\\" in reference to the Yazoo tribe living near the river's mouth at its confluence with the Mississippi. The exact meaning of the term is unclear. One long held belief is that it means \\"river of death\\".Johnson's (revised) Universal Cyclopaedia. 1886. The river is 188 miles (303 km) long and is formed by the confluence of the Tallahatchie and the Yalobusha rivers, where present-day Greenwood developed. The river parallels the Mississippi River in the latter's floodplain for some distance before joining it north of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Natural levees which flank the Mississippi prevent the Yazoo from joining it before Vicksburg. A \\"yazoo stream\\" is a hydrologic term that was coined to describe any river or major stream with similar characteristics. Potamologists believe the Yazoo River had its origins as the lower Ohio River.Mills, Gary B. \\"New life for the river of death:development of the Yazoo River Basin, 1873-1977\\". Journal of Mississippi History. 41. (Nov. 1979) 4, p. 287. The French (and later European Americans) historically called the surrounding area of Mississippi and Alabama the Yazoo lands, after the river. This became the basis for naming the Yazoo Land Scandal of the late 18th and early 19th century. The river was of major importance during the American Civil War. The Confederates used the first electrically detonated underwater mine in the river in 1862 near Vicksburg to sink the Union ironclad USS Cairo. The last section of the Cairo was raised on December 12, 1964. It has been restored and is now on permanent display to the public at the Vicksburg National Military Park. There are 29 sunken ships from the Civil War beneath the waters of the river. The steamer Dew Drop was reportedly sunk near Roebuck Lake as an obstruction to the United States Navy, but Union sources claim the vessel was captured and burned.Smith, Frank E. (1988). The Yazoo River. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi. p. 150 Variant names of the Yazoo River include Zasu River, Yazous River, Yahshoo River, Rivi√®re des Yasoux, and Fiume del Yasous. In 1876, the Mississippi River changed its course, shifting west several miles and leaving Vicksburg without a river front. In 1902, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers diverted the Yazoo River into the old river bed, forming the Yazoo Diversion Canal. The modern-day port of Vicksburg is still located on this canal. Commercial navigation of the Yazoo River has declined considerably since the 1990s and is mainly concentrated on the section from Vicksburg to Yazoo City.Stole, Bryn.

Gyatt. Private Gyatt was a member of the Marine Raiders in the Battle of Guadalcanal. As part of the advance force, he held his post until killed by an enemy grenade. Gyatt was built by Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company in Kearny, New Jersey and sponsored by Mrs. Hilda Morrell, Private Gyatt's mother, who was a member of the gold star mothers. Service history = Commissioning and training exercises = After shakedown in the Caribbean, Gyatt reported to Norfolk, Virginia for a variety of duties along the East Coast. In addition to local operations and training exercises, she participated in training operations with aircraft carriers in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. Departing Norfolk on 24 January 1947, Gyatt sailed south to represent the United States at the inauguration of the new Uruguayan President Berres at Montevideo from 27 February 1947 to 6 March 1947. Before returning to Norfolk on 21 March 1947, she made goodwill visits to Rio de Janeiro and Port of Spain, Trinidad. = Operations = Gyatt sailed 20 November 1947 to deploy with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean and returned to Norfolk on 2 March 1948. She participated in six subsequent deployments to Northern Europe and the Mediterranean. Other operations took her north from Norfolk to Nova Scotia and Iceland and south into the Caribbean Sea. = Guided missile destroyer conversion = Gyatt launching a Terrier missile. Gyatt entered the Boston Naval Shipyard on 26 September 1955, and decommissioned on 31 October for conversion into the world's first guided missile destroyer. In addition to twin Terrier guided missile launchers, she received the Navy's first Denny-Brown stabilization system with two 45 square foot (4 m¬≤) retractable fins extending out from midships well below the waterline to greatly reduce pitch and roll on the sea). Her hull classification was changed to DDG-712 on 1 December 1956. Gyatt recommissioned two days later, with Commander Charles F. Helme, Jr., in command. The new guided missile ship spent nearly three years doing intensive evaluation and development work along the Atlantic coast. On 23 May 1957 her hull number was changed to DDG-1 in recognition of her pioneering position. She sailed to join the 6th Fleet on 28 January 1960 and was the first guided missile destroyer to deploy with an overseas fleet. By the time of her arrival back in Charleston, her new home port on 31 August 1960, Gyatt had participated in fleet readiness and training operations throughout the Mediterranean. = Space program = On her return, Gyatt joined in America's space program. Taking nose-cone recovery station from 5‚Äì10 November 1960 and from 24‚Äì26 April 1961 to aid in Project Mercury, she pioneered another area of expanding seapower. With another world crisis pending over the status of Berlin, she again sailed 3 August 1961 to bolster the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. She remained on alert posture with the \\"steel gray stabilizers\\" in the Mediterranean until 3 March 1962, then resumed training along the eastern seaboard out of Charleston, South Carolina. = Overhaul = Gyatt entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard on 29 June 1962, for an overhaul that included the removal of her missile system and installation of newly developed equipment that prepared her for specialized service with the Operational Test and Evaluation Force. Her classification changed from guided missile destroyer DDG-1 back to conventional destroyer DD-712 on 1 October 1962. Her preparations were complete by 1 January 1963 when Gyatt arrived in Norfolk for continuing experimental work under the Operational Test and Evaluation Force commanded by Captain Chester \\"Chet\\" M. Lee from 1963 to 1964, which extended into the Caribbean Sea. Gyatt continued to operate along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean into 1967. She performed patrol and ASW duty and trained the officers and men of the Navy in guided missile destroyer tactics. She was especially active in testing and evaluating new equipment and helping to improve the efficiency and modernity of the Navy. = Sinking = Gyatt was transferred to the Select Reserve and switched homeports to Washington, D.C. in 1968. After being stricken on 22 October 1969, Gyatt was sunk as a target off Virginia on 11 June 1970.

Journey in Faith St. Louis, Missouri: The Bethany Press, 1975. Campbell was influenced by similar efforts in Scotland, in particular, by James and Robert Haldane, who emphasized their interpretation of Christianity as found in the New Testament. In 1832, the group of reformers led by the Campbells merged with a similar movement that began under the leadership of Barton W. Stone in Kentucky.Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L. Dunnavant, The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ, William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 2004, , , 854 pages, entry on Campbell, Alexander Their congregations identified as Disciples of Christ or Christian churches. Several church groups have some historical ties with Campbell's efforts. The three main groups are the Churches of Christ, the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), and the independent Christian churches and churches of Christ. Additionally, there are the International Churches of Christ, the International Christian Church, the Churches of Christ in Australia, the Churches of Christ in Europe, and the Evangelical Christian Church in Canada.Sydney E. Ahlstrom, A Religious History of the American People (2004)Melton's Encyclopedia of American Religions (2009) Campbell also founded Bethany College in what became Bethany, West Virginia. Early life and education Front of the Campbell Mansion Young Alexander Campbell Alexander Campbell was born 12 September 1788 near Ballymena, in the parish of Broughshane, County Antrim, Ireland. His parents were Thomas Campbell and Jane Corneigle Campbell, who were of Scots descent. Like his father, he was educated at the University of Glasgow, where he was greatly influenced by Scottish Enlightenment philosophy. He was also influenced by the English philosopher John Locke. In 1809 at the age of 21, Alexander emigrated to the United States with his mother and siblings from Scotland, to join his father Thomas, who had emigrated there in 1807. They sailed from Scotland on the Latonia on 3 August 1809 and landed in New York City on 29 September, then traveled overland to Philadelphia. They continued to western Pennsylvania, where the senior Campbell was serving as a minister in Washington County on the frontier. Alexander was ordained by his father's Brush Run Church on 1 January 1812. Marriage and personal life The year before, Campbell had married Margaret Brown on 12 March 1811.Adron Doran, Restoring New Testament Christianity, 21st Century Christian, 1997, Margaret's father John Brown owned a significant amount of land in the Bethany, Virginia, area (now in West Virginia). The couple resided in what is now known as the Alexander Campbell Mansion near Bethany, and had eight children. Their first child, a daughter, was born on 13 March 1812. His daughter's birth spurred Campbell to study the subject of baptism. He ultimately concluded that scripture did not support the baptism of infants. He came to believe that individuals had to choose conversion for themselves and baptism was not appropriate until they did so. After the death of Margaret in 1827, Campbell married again the next year, to Selina Huntington Bakewell on 31 July 1828; they had six children.Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L.

After disagreements over some issues, they allied with the Mahoning Baptist Association. Campbell's only formal political service was as a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829‚Äì1830, held in Richmond. He met some of the leading politicians of the day and was invited to preach in several churches in the capital city. In 1840, Campbell founded Bethany College in Bethany, Virginia (now West Virginia). He believed that the clergy should be college educated. Many future leaders of the Disciples of Christ and Churches of Christ graduated from the college, although some latter congregations did not attach the same value to theological study and professional clergy.Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L. Dunnavant, The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, , , 854 pages, entry on Bethany College Campbell visited the United Kingdom in 1847. During the trip he gave public lectures in England and Scotland. He went to Ireland to deliver funds that U.S. Restoration Movement churches had raised for relief in the Great Famine. While at Glasgow, he was challenged by James Robertson to a debate on the subject of slavery, which the American South protected and Campbell defended as moral. As a result of the fierce exchange, Robertson sued Campbell for libel. The American denied the charge, but he was arrested and imprisoned for ten days. Campbell was released when the warrant for his arrest was declared to be illegal. The case was ultimately tried, and the jury decided in his favor. Death and legacy Alexander Campbell died on 4 March 1866 at Bethany, West Virginia. His widow died more than three decades later, on 28 June 1897. His nephew Archibald Campbell (1833‚Äì1899) had already become an important abolitionist and Republican party leader, and as editor of the Wheeling Daily Intelligencer helped found what became the state of West Virginia. Writings Alexander Campbell, age 65 While in his early 20s, Campbell wrote several moral essays under the pseudonym \\"Clarinda.\\" and published them in a local paper.Gary Holloway, \\"Alexander Campbell as a Publisher\\", Restoration Quarterly, Vol. 37 No. 1 (1995) In 1820, his debate with the Presbyterian John Walker was published, reminding him of the efficacy of writing and publishing. He bought a press and built a small print shop in 1823, establishing what proved to be a successful publishing operation.Greg Taylor, \\"Alexander Campbell: Millennial Blogger\\" , Disciples of Christ Historical Society, Accessed June 13, 2011 Campbell edited and published two journals. The first was the Christian Baptist, which he edited from 1823 through 1830.Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L.

Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, , , 854 pages, entry on Christian Baptist, The The second was The Millennial Harbinger, which he began in 1830 and continued to edit until his death in 1866. He became less active in it during the 1850s.Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L. Dunnavant, The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, , , 854 pages, entry on Millennial Harbinger, The In both, he advocated the reform of Christianity along the lines as it was practiced on the American frontier. He encouraged contributions by writers who thought differently from him, and the journals encouraged a lively dialogue about issues in the reform movement. Campbell expanded his printing operation in 1830 for the Millennial Harbinger. The change from the Christian Baptist to the Harbinger was prompted by several concerns. Differences of opinion were arising between Campbell and the Baptists, and in many cases Baptist associations were expelling persons connected with the Campbell movement. He was concerned that \\"Christian Baptist\\" ‚Äì which he considered to be less appropriate than the biblical term \\"Disciples\\" ‚Äì was becoming the de facto name of the group. He also wanted the new journal to have a more positive tone, promoting reform and preparing the world for the millennium and the second coming of Christ. Campbell wrote several books, including The Christian System. He also wrote hymns, including \\"Upon the Banks of Jordan Stood\\".Richardson, Robert. Memoirs of Alexander Campbell. In two volumes.

Campbell's Great Debates , Church History Pages In June 1820, he debated with Rev. John Walker, a Baptist preacher, at Mount Pleasant, Ohio, on baptism, and since then, regularly participated in debates. Some of them gained national and international attention after their transcripts were published. In 1823, he debated with Rev. William L. McCalla, a Presbyterian minister, on infant baptism; in April 1829, with Robert Owen on socialism and Christianity; in January 1837, with Archbishop of Cincinnati, John Baptist Purcell on Protestantism and Roman Catholicism; in September 1843, he defended the Restoration Movement in a debate with Rev.

They signed to Secret Records in March 1981,The Exploited +++ Real Punk Rock Since 1980. The-Exploited.net. Retrieved 11 April 2012. and their debut EP Army Life and debut album Punks Not Dead were both released that year. The band maintained a large cult following in the 1980s among a hardcore working class punk and skinhead audience. Originally a street punk band, the Exploited eventually became a crossover thrash band with the release of their album Death Before Dishonour in 1987. Although the Exploited continue to perform live, they have not released any studio material since their last album Fuck the System in 2002. Their songs have been covered by Slayer and Ice-T, and despite many lineup changes, Wattie has remained as the Exploited's singer and leader. Career =Formation and early days (1979‚Äì1980)= The Exploited logo The original line-up consisted of: Terry Buchan (vocals), Stevie Ross (guitar), Colin Erskine (bass) and Andy McNiven (drums). Formed in the West Granton area of Edinburgh, a large grey council estate on the north side of the city. The band's politics was reflected in its name, coined by drummer and songwriter McNiven, whose father was a Korean War veteran and a Communist. While in the early stages as a band, with little equipment, the band were invited to play their first gig at Craigmuir School. The band seemed to be a victim of their own publicity here. They had spray- painted their band name locally and had stolen Sunday papers, milk, and rolls in the early hours of Sunday morning and redistributed them outside peoples' front door, with a note saying, \\"a gift from the exploited\\". Their first gig was on Friday 15 December 1978. The date was recalled by McNiven as it coincided with a performance by the Doomed (the Damned by another name) at Clouds in Edinburgh to which they went after performing their own gig. The gig was attended by Terry's older brother Wattie, who had recently left the army and was a punk in London. Wattie soon replaced Terry, and Andy McNiven and Colin Erskine were dropped from the line-up as well. Jim Park became the drummer in January 1979, first playing on 3 February 1979 at the YMCA in Edinburgh, (the day after Sid Vicious died in New York City). After a few gigs in and around Edinburgh, Stevey Hay left after an appearance in Aberdeen supporting the UK Subs. A few months later, he and Terry Buchan formed The Exposed. The Exposed split in 1980 after a gig supporting the Exploited. Terry left for London. Stevey was prominent in the Edinburgh band scene during the 1980s. Stevey died 14 July 2013 after a successful career as a blues musician. Obituary: Stevey Hay, musician =Early releases and Punk's Not Dead (1980‚Äì1981)= Influenced by 1970s punk rock music such as music by the Sex Pistols, the quartet created a simple, no-frills sound characterised by speed and aggression. In 1980, the group founded its own independent record label, Exploited Records, and released their debut EP Army Life, which was #6 in the Indie/Independent charts for eight weeks, then was in the Top 20 for eighteen months. The B-side was called Fuck the Mods / Crashed Out and the record's back cover stated \\"To all the Edinburgh punks and skins - keep on mod- bashing!!\\". They then released another single, \\"Barmy Army\\", which jumped into the independent charts and remained there for 53 weeks, peaking at #4. Their single \\"Dead Cities\\" peaked at #31 on the UK Charts. Their single \\"Exploited Barmy Army\\" peaked at #4 on the Independent/Indie In March 1981, the band signed to Secret Records, and spent a month recording their debut album, Punks Not Dead. The Exploited released the single \\"Dogs of War\\", which peaked at #2 in the Independent charts and #63 on the UK Charts. Also in 1981, the band released their first live album, On Stage, recorded during a concert in Edinburgh. Thereafter, the band performed, along with Discharge, Anti-Nowhere League, Anti-Pasti and Chron Gen on a tour called Apocalypse Now, which was recorded and released as a live album. Their album Punks Not Dead, released in April 1981, went to #20 in May,Buckley, Peter. The Rough Guide to Rock. London: Rough Guides Ltd, 2003. pg 350. . then number 1 on the Independent Charts. During this time, the Exploited appeared on the popular mainstream TV programme, A lot of fans of the Exploited were unhappy with the band's decision to appear on the show. The hardcore punk band Conflict wrote the song Exploitation about this appearance, which began a long-standing rivalry between Conflict and the Exploited that divided the punk fan base. A young punk wearing an Exploited T-shirt in 1984 =Troops of Tomorrow, Let's Start a War, and Horror Epics (1982‚Äì1986)= The band released the albums Troops of Tomorrow in 1982, Let's Start a War in 1983 and Horror Epics in 1985. The period between these albums was marked by severe discord over the band's musical direction: guitarist Big John Duncan and bassist Gary McCormack both left to form new bands‚Äî\\"bands with disco beats and guitar solos, total shit\\", in Wattie's words‚Äîand the band went through a rapid succession of drummers, one of whom allegedly left after a \\"nervous breakdown\\". The band was driven away from the Secret label by new management who demanded unrealistic changes in style and personnel. Their next label, a tiny enterprise named Pax Records, folded after its owner fled with all its assets. The concert album Live at the White House was recorded in Washington, D.C. in 1985 at the 9:30 Club and was released the following year in 1986. They also released the studio EP Jesus Is Dead in 1986, following up with Live and Loud, a videography of the Exploited performing around Europe and in the United States. During the tour of the US, Wattie and Karl Morris had a fight on stage, and Karl left shortly afterwards. He was briefly replaced by Mad Mick, who then disappeared without trace. Nigel Swanson was then appointed as the new guitarist. =Death Before Dishonour, The Massacre and Beat the Bastards (1987‚Äì2002)= \\"Sexual Favours\\", a single from the album Death Before Dishonour, was released in 1987. The album only ranked in the top 200 of the Britain Alternative Music list. However, the album sold out quickly. The album's cover featured artwork from the American punk artist Pushead, who complained that he was neither paid nor credited for the work. In 1990, the Exploited released their album The Massacre. The album is a crossover thrash album. The band went on to release a Singles Collection album in 1993. The Exploited also released the videography Live in Japan in 1993. Their album Beat the Bastards was released in April 1996. =Fuck the System and next album (2003‚Äìpresent)= The Exploited performing in Vorselaar, Belgium in May 2018 In early 2003, the band released the album Fuck the System on Dream Catcher Records, and in the following year, they toured in the UK and US. On 14 October 2003, about 500 fans started a riot in Montreal, Canada after an Exploited concert was cancelled due to the band not being allowed into the country. Rioters destroyed eight cars and set them on fire; broke eleven shop windows and caused other damage. The band were banned from playing in Mexico City due to the riot. In a 2012 interview, Wattie Buchan claimed that a new album was being finished. In February 2014, Wattie Buchan suffered a heart attack on stage during a performance in Lisbon on the band's Taste of Chaos Tour with Hatebreed and Napalm Death. He was taken to a hospital, where he was expected to receive treatment for at least a week. The band signed a deal with Nuclear Blast Records, and was to have many of its albums reissued in March 2014. The band had also confirmed that its first album in a decade would be released during the 2010s. It is currently unknown when the album will be released. In March 2020, Wattie Buchan responded to the coronavirus outbreak that was forcing bands to cancel or postpone tours. He commented by taking a shot at Green Day (a band on many occasions he has admitted to hating) saying \\"Fuck coronavirus! I have had 5 heart attacks a quad heart bypass and a heart pacemaker fitted. Cancel gigs for a virus? We ain't fucking Green Day piss - We are the real deal. No danger will we be cancelling our upcoming gigs. Punks Not Dead!\\" The Australian leg of the tour was then cancelled four days later, though the band completed all the scheduled New Zealand gigs.

The term \\"UK 82\\" came from the Exploited's song \\"UK 82\\". AllMusic described the Exploited as \\"one of most riveting British punk rock units of the early 1980s\\".On Stage - The Exploited - AllMusic The Exploited have influenced multiple bands such as Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, Nirvana, Queens of the Stone Age, Discharge, Stormtroopers of Death, Agnostic Front, Exodus, the Virus, Napalm Death, Terrorizer, NOFX, Rancid, Dropkick Murphys, the Casualties, Pennywise, 7 Seconds, Anti-Flag, Blanks 77,Killer Blanks [Bonus Tracks] \\\\- Blanks 77 - Allmusic Atari Teenage Riot, Death Angel, and Total Chaos. In the 2007 documentary Punk's Not Dead, both Wattie and Wullie Buchan are interviewed.

Musical style and influences The Exploited has been categorised as crossover thrash, punk rock, thrash metal, speed metal, punk metal, anarchist punk, street punkDon't Forget the Chaos - The Exploited by Allmusic - Retrieved August 11, 2015 and Originally playing street punk and oi!, the Exploited became a crossover thrash band with their album Death Before Dishonour. The Exploited's influences include Sex Pistols, the Vibrators, the Threats, and Johnny Moped. Lyrical themes and gigs The Exploited have been controversial for their aggressive lyrics and rowdy gigs. They were considered \\"cartoon punks\\" by Ian Glasper. Glasper wrote: \\"For many, the Exploited were the quintessential second wave punk band with their senses- searing high-speed outbursts against the system, and wild-eyed frontman Walter 'Wattie' Buchan's archetypal orange mohican.\\" The Exploited are known for their lyrics about anarchy, politics and anti-authority.The Exploited biography at AllMusic In a 1983 interview, the Exploited said that they were not a political band,The Exploited 1983 Interview (Wattie Buchan Karl Morris), Punk Lives Youtube Channel but their lyrics became political in the late 1980s and Wattie Buchan said in the documentary Punk's Not Dead that punk is defined by its politics. As a band with lyrics that have anarchist themes, the Exploited's vocalist Wattie Buchan describes himself as an anarchist and openly hates politics. The Exploited have made songs about former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and have expressed a disdainful view towards Thatcher. The Exploited's song \\"Maggie\\", a song from the band's album Horror Epics, is about Thatcher. The Exploited's third studio album, \\"Let's Start a War... (Said Maggie One Day)\\", focuses on Margaret Thatcher and the Falklands War. Other topics of the album are police-driven riots, war, unemployment and hopelessness. Many songs from the mid-'80s focus on the threat of nuclear war. The fans of the Exploited were nicknamed the Barmy Army. During the rivalry between the Exploited and Conflict, there were occasional clashes with fans of Conflict, known as \\"the Conflict Crew\\". In addition to the anti-social behaviour of the band and some of their fans, the Exploited would often pull out of gigs at short notice in the 1980s, which led many venues to refuse to work with them. After the 1981 Southall riot, Oi! bands in general became associated with racism, and the Exploited were sometimes believed to be a racist band because of Wattie's swastika tattoo, an incident in the early '80s where Wattie fought with a group of Asians in a cafe and in 1985 when \\"Deptford John\\" joined from the skinhead band Combat 84. The band has denied all accusations of racism. As of August 2017, the band's website contains a history of the band that mentions some of the problems that have accompanied their gigs, such as a riot after a gig at the Rainbow in Finsbury Park, London when the Jam were playing nearby and Wattie incited the fans to attack the Mods, and having declared onstage in Argentina that the Falkland Islands are British forever. George Same has written about the fighting after the Finsbury Park gig in his book on modern music, Backward Moddy Boy.George Same (2009), Backward Moddy Boy, AuthorHouse, page 20 In a documentary about the band, former manager Gem Howard said that he would often sneak the band out of hotels late, as they would often vandalise the hotel and steal everything that they could from the rooms.

It features Hercule Poirot and Arthur Hastings. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6), and the US edition at $1.75. The story takes place in northern France, giving Poirot a hostile competitor from the Paris S√ªret√©. Poirot's long memory for past or similar crimes proves useful in resolving the crimes. The book is notable for a subplot in which Hastings falls in love, a development \\"greatly desired on Agatha's part... parcelling off Hastings to wedded bliss in the Argentine.\\" Reviews when it was published compared Mrs Christie favourably to Arthur Conan Doyle in his Sherlock Holmes mysteries. Remarking on Poirot, still a new character, one reviewer said he was \\"a pleasant contrast to most of his lurid competitors; and one even suspects a touch of satire in him.\\" Plot summary Hercule Poirot and Captain Hastings travel to Merlinville- sur-Mer, France, to meet Paul Renauld, who has requested their help. Upon arriving at his home, the Villa Genevieve, local police greet them with news that he has been found dead that morning. Renauld had been stabbed in the back with a letter opener and left in a newly dug grave adjacent to a local golf course. His wife, Eloise Renauld, claims masked men broke into the villa at 2am, tied her up, and took her husband away with them. Upon inspecting his body, Eloise collapses with grief at seeing her dead husband. Monsieur Giraud of the S√ªret√© leads the police investigation, and resents Poirot's involvement; Monsieur Hautet, the Examining Magistrate, is more open to sharing key information with him. Poirot notes four key facts about the case: a piece of lead piping is found near the body; only three female servants were in the villa as both Renauld's son Jack and his chauffeur had been sent away; an unknown person visited the day before, whom Renauld urged to leave immediately; Renauld's immediate neighbour, Madame Daubreuil, had placed 200,000 francs into her bank account over recent weeks. When Renauld's secretary, Gabriel Stonor, returns from England, he suggests blackmail, as his employer's past is a complete mystery prior to his career in South America. Meanwhile, Hastings unexpectedly encounters a young woman he met before, known to him as \\"Cinderella\\", who asks to see the crime scene, and then mysteriously disappears with the murder weapon. Poirot later travels to Paris to research the case's similarities to that of a murder case from 22 years ago, which has only one difference - the killer, Georges Conneau, later confessed to the crime, in which he and his lover, Madame Beroldy, had plotted to kill her husband and claim that the murder was carried out by masked intruders; both disappeared soon afterwards. Returning from Paris, Poirot learns that the body of an unknown man has been found, stabbed through the heart with the murder weapon. An examination shows he has the hands of a tramp, that he died before Renauld's murder from an epileptic fit, and that he was stabbed after death. Giraud arrests Jack on the basis he wanted his father's money; Jack had admitted to police he had argued with his father over wishing to marry Mme Daubreuil's daughter Marthe, whom his parents found unsuitable. Poirot reveals a flaw in Giraud's theory, as Renauld changed his will two weeks before his murder, disinheriting Jack. Soon afterwards, Jack is released from prison after Bella Duveen, an English stage performer he loves, confesses to the murder. Both had come across the body on the night of the murder, and assumed the other had killed Renauld. Poirot reveals neither did, as the real killer was Marthe Daubreuil. Poirot elaborates on his theory. Paul Renauld was really Georges Conneau; fleeing France, he changed his name in Canada to start a new life for himself. After gaining a wife and a son, and making a fortune in South America, he returned to France to settle down with his new family. By misfortune, he found that his immediate neighbour would be Mme Beroldy; like him, she changed her identity to become Mme Daubreuil. Blackmailed by her over his past, Renauld's situation worsens when Jack becomes attracted to her daughter. When a tramp died on his grounds, he saw an opportunity to escape Mme Daubreuil. He will use the same ruse from before, but with one difference: this time, he would use it to fake his own death. His plan was simple - staging his own kidnapping at night, he would disfigure the tramp's body with the pipe, and then bury both beside the golf course, before fleeing the area by train. Anyone who would recognise the body was not his would be sent away, so as to assure that Eloise will falsely identify the body as his. Poirot suspected her involvement in the scheme, as her reaction to her husband's death was not genuine until she saw his body. However, the plan was discovered by Marthe, who overheard the Renaulds discussing it together - as she stood to gain financially if she married Jack, the success of this scheme would ruin this. Thus she decided to follow Renauld and stabbed him after he dug the grave for the tramp's body, before he had retrieved it. To expose Marthe as the killer, Poirot asks Eloise to openly disinherit Jack. That night, Marthe attempts to kill Eloise when Jack leaves her alone in the villa, but dies trying when Eloise is saved by Cinderella. Marthe's mother disappears again. Jack and his mother plan to go to South America, joined by Hastings and Dulcie Duveen ‚Äî who is his Cinderella and Bella's twin sister.

Literary significance and reception The Times Literary Supplement reviewed the novel in its issue of 7 June 1923. The review compared the methods of detection of Poirot to Sherlock Holmes and concluded favourably that the book \\"provides the reader with an enthralling mystery of an unusual kind\\".The Times Literary Supplement, 7 June 1923 (p. 389) The New York Times Book Review of 25 March 1923 began, \\"Here is a remarkably good detective story which can be warmly commended to those who like that kind of fiction.\\" After detailing the set-up of the story the review continued, \\"The plot has peculiar complications and the reader will have to be very astute indeed if he guesses who the criminal is until the last complexity has been unravelled. The author is notably ingenious in the construction and unravelling of the mystery, which develops fresh interests and new entanglements at every turn. She deserves commendation also for the care with which the story is worked out and the good craftsmanship with which it is written. Although there is not much endeavour to portray character, except in the case of M. Poirot, several of the personages are depicted with swiftly made expressive and distinctive lines.\\"The New York Times Book Review, 25 March 1923 (p. 14) The unnamed reviewer in The Observer of 10 June 1923 said, \\"When Conan Doyle popularised Sherlock Holmes in the Strand of the 'nineties he lit such a candle as the publishers will not willingly let out. Not a week passes which does not bring a 'detective' story from one quarter or another, and several of the popular magazines rely mainly on that commodity. Among the later cultivators of this anything but lonely furrow the name of Agatha Christie is well in the front. If she has not the touch of artistry which made The Speckled Band and The Hound of the Baskervilles things of real horror, she has an unusual gift of mechanical complication.\\" The reviewer went on to compare the novel with The Mysterious Affair at Styles which they called, \\"a remarkable piece of work\\" but warned that, \\"it is a mistake to carry the art of bewilderment to the point of making the brain reel.\\" They did admit that, \\"No solution could be more surprising\\" and stated that the character of Poirot was, \\"a pleasant contrast to most of his lurid competitors; and one even suspects a touch of satire in him.\\"The Observer, 10 June 1923 (p. 5) Robert Barnard: \\"Super-complicated early whodunit, set in the northerly fringes of France so beloved of the English bankrupt. Poirot pits his wits against a sneering sophisticate of a French policeman while Hastings lets his wander after an auburn-haired female acrobat. Entertaining for most of its length, but the solution is one of those 'once revealed, instantly forgotten' ones, where ingenuity has triumphed over common sense\\"..

In a modern work of literary criticism, Christie biographer Laura Thompson writes: She notes as well that the book, the second novel featuring Poirot, is notable for a subplot in which Hastings falls in love, a development \\"greatly desired on Agatha's part... parcelling off Hastings to wedded bliss in the Argentine.\\" References in other works The character of the theatrical agent Joseph Aarons also features in the 1928 short story Double Sin which was published in book form in the US in Double Sin and Other Stories in 1961 and in the UK in Poirot's Early Cases in 1974. Some plot twists are inspired by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's \\"The Adventure of the Abbey Grange\\".

This was Christie's first published work for the Grand Magazine which went on to publish many of her short stories throughout the 1920s. Christie's Autobiography recounts how she objected to the illustration of the dustjacket of the UK first edition stating that it was both badly drawn and unrepresentative of the plot. It was the first of many such objections she raised with her publishers over the dustjacket. It would appear that Christie won her argument over the dustjacket as the one she describes and objected to (\\"a man in his pyjamas, dying of an epileptic fit on a golf course\\") does not resemble the actual jacket which shows Monsieur Renauld digging the open grave on the golf course at night. =Book dedication= Christie dedicated her third book as follows: > \\"To My Husband. A fellow enthusiast for detective stories and to whom I am > indebted for much helpful advice and criticism\\". Christie refers here to her first husband, Archibald Christie (1890‚Äì1962) from whom she was divorced in 1928. =Dustjacket blurb= The dustjacket front flap of the first edition carried no specially written blurb. Instead it carried quotes of reviews for The Mysterious Affair at Styles whilst the back jacket flap carried similar quotes for The Secret Adversary. Adaptations =Radio= The Murder on the Links was presented as a one-hour, thirty-minute radio adaptation in the Saturday Night Theatre strand on BBC Radio 4 on 15 September 1990, the centenary of Christie's birth. It was repeated on 8 July 1991 and again in 2015. John Moffatt starred as Poirot. The play's recording took place on 21 June 1989 at Broadcasting House. It was adapted by Michael Bakewell and produced and directed by Enyd Williams.

It was produced by Carnival Films, and starred David Suchet as Hercule Poirot, and Hugh Fraser as Arthur Hastings. While much of the novel's plot was retained, the adaptation featured a number of changes, which included the setting being changed to Deauville, France, where filming took place on-site. Other changes included: * The Beroldy murder takes place ten years ago, in London, England - Madame Beroldy confesses to the crime when police discover she is lying. Paul Renauld flees after this to Chile, South America, and meets with his wife Eloise; Jack is her son from a previous marriage and become Paul's stepson after he marries her. Renauld's previous name is George Connor. * Renauld requests Poirot's help the evening after he arrives at the resort hotel he founded upon returning to France - both Poirot and Hastings are there on holiday. * Renauld's body is found after police are called to investigate his disappearance by foreign agents. The discovery is made by Hastings while golfing with others. * Giraud makes a small bet against Poirot, after the investigation begins, in which he wagers his pipe against Poirot's moustache that he solves it before he does. Giraud loses the wager, but shows better respect for Poirot after he allows him to keep his pipe, on the understanding that \\"each time you light it, you will think of Hercule Poirot\\". * The tramp's body is examined in Deauville when Poirot returns. * The characters of Dulcie and Bella Duveen are merged to form a new character, Isabel \\"Bella\\" Duveen. She is a singer, who becomes Hastings' love interest during the investigation, after he sees her perform on the first evening in Deauville. She is Jack's former lover; when he is being questioned in court on his plea on the charge of murdering his father, Isabel interrupts it to confess to the crime. * Poirot and Hastings are the only ones to watch the Renaulds' villa, after setting a trap to catch Marthe Daubreuil. Her attempted murder of Eloise is thwarted by Paul's secretary, who shoots her dead. Mme Daubreuil is arrested by police shortly after this. * Poirot's denouement of the crime is split into two parts before and after the attempted murder of Eloise - the first part outlays Renauld's actions before his murder; the second covers the truth of who killed him, and why Isabel and Paul were willing to confess to the crime rather than let the other do so.

In mathematics, and particularly in set theory, category theory, type theory, and the foundations of mathematics, a universe is a collection that contains all the entities one wishes to consider in a given situation. In set theory, universes are often classes that contain (as elements) all sets for which one hopes to prove a particular theorem. These classes can serve as inner models for various axiomatic systems such as ZFC or Morse‚ÄìKelley set theory. Universes are of critical importance to formalizing concepts in category theory inside set- theoretical foundations. For instance, the canonical motivating example of a category is Set, the category of all sets, which cannot be formalized in a set theory without some notion of a universe. In type theory, a universe is a type whose elements are types. In a specific context Perhaps the simplest version is that any set can be a universe, so long as the object of study is confined to that particular set. If the object of study is formed by the real numbers, then the real line R, which is the real number set, could be the universe under consideration. Implicitly, this is the universe that Georg Cantor was using when he first developed modern naive set theory and cardinality in the 1870s and 1880s in applications to real analysis. The only sets that Cantor was originally interested in were subsets of R. This concept of a universe is reflected in the use of Venn diagrams. In a Venn diagram, the action traditionally takes place inside a large rectangle that represents the universe U. One generally says that sets are represented by circles; but these sets can only be subsets of U. The complement of a set A is then given by that portion of the rectangle outside of A's circle. Strictly speaking, this is the relative complement U \\\\ A of A relative to U; but in a context where U is the universe, it can be regarded as the absolute complement AC of A. Similarly, there is a notion of the nullary intersection, that is the intersection of zero sets (meaning no sets, not null sets). Without a universe, the nullary intersection would be the set of absolutely everything, which is generally regarded as impossible; but with the universe in mind, the nullary intersection can be treated as the set of everything under consideration, which is simply U. These conventions are quite useful in the algebraic approach to basic set theory, based on Boolean lattices. Except in some non- standard forms of axiomatic set theory (such as New Foundations), the class of all sets is not a Boolean lattice (it is only a relatively complemented lattice). In contrast, the class of all subsets of U, called the power set of U, is a Boolean lattice. The absolute complement described above is the complement operation in the Boolean lattice; and U, as the nullary intersection, serves as the top element (or nullary meet) in the Boolean lattice. Then De Morgan's laws, which deal with complements of meets and joins (which are unions in set theory) apply, and apply even to the nullary meet and the nullary join (which is the empty set). In ordinary mathematics However, once subsets of a given set X (in Cantor's case, X = R) are considered, the universe may need to be a set of subsets of X. (For example, a topology on X is a set of subsets of X.) The various sets of subsets of X will not themselves be subsets of X but will instead be subsets of PX, the power set of X. This may be continued; the object of study may next consist of such sets of subsets of X, and so on, in which case the universe will be P(PX). In another direction, the binary relations on X (subsets of the Cartesian product may be considered, or functions from X to itself, requiring universes like or XX. Thus, even if the primary interest is X, the universe may need to be considerably larger than X. Following the above ideas, one may want the superstructure over X as the universe. This can be defined by structural recursion as follows: * Let S0X be X itself. * Let S1X be the union of X and PX. * Let S2X be the union of S1X and P(S1X). * In general, let Sn+1X be the union of SnX and P(SnX). Then the superstructure over X, written SX, is the union of S0X, S1X, S2X, and so on; or : \\\\mathbf{S}X := \\\\bigcup_{i=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\mathbf{S}_{i}X \\\\mbox{.} \\\\\\\\! No matter what set X is the starting point, the empty set {} will belong to S1X. The empty set is the von Neumann ordinal [0]. Then {[0]}, the set whose only element is the empty set, will belong to S2X; this is the von Neumann ordinal [1]. Similarly, {[1]} will belong to S3X, and thus so will {[0],[1]}, as the union of {[0]} and {[1]}; this is the von Neumann ordinal [2]. Continuing this process, every natural number is represented in the superstructure by its von Neumann ordinal. Next, if x and y belong to the superstructure, then so does {{x},{x,y}}, which represents the ordered pair (x,y). Thus the superstructure will contain the various desired Cartesian products. Then the superstructure also contains functions and relations, since these may be represented as subsets of Cartesian products. The process also gives ordered n-tuples, represented as functions whose domain is the von Neumann ordinal [n], and so on. So if the starting point is just X = {}, a great deal of the sets needed for mathematics appear as elements of the superstructure over {}. But each of the elements of S{} will be a finite set. Each of the natural numbers belongs to it, but the set N of all natural numbers does not (although it is a subset of S{}). In fact, the superstructure over {} consists of all of the hereditarily finite sets. As such, it can be considered the universe of finitist mathematics. Speaking anachronistically, one could suggest that the 19th-century finitist Leopold Kronecker was working in this universe; he believed that each natural number existed but that the set N (a \\"completed infinity\\") did not. However, S{} is unsatisfactory for ordinary mathematicians (who are not finitists), because even though N may be available as a subset of S{}, still the power set of N is not. In particular, arbitrary sets of real numbers are not available. So it may be necessary to start the process all over again and form S(S{}). However, to keep things simple, one can take the set N of natural numbers as given and form SN, the superstructure over N. This is often considered the universe of ordinary mathematics. The idea is that all of the mathematics that is ordinarily studied refers to elements of this universe. For example, any of the usual constructions of the real numbers (say by Dedekind cuts) belongs to SN. Even non-standard analysis can be done in the superstructure over a non-standard model of the natural numbers. There is a slight shift in philosophy from the previous section, where the universe was any set U of interest. There, the sets being studied were subsets of the universe; now, they are members of the universe. Thus although P(SX) is a Boolean lattice, what is relevant is that SX itself is not. Consequently, it is rare to apply the notions of Boolean lattices and Venn diagrams directly to the superstructure universe as they were to the power-set universes of the previous section. Instead, one can work with the individual Boolean lattices PA, where A is any relevant set belonging to SX; then PA is a subset of SX (and in fact belongs to SX). In Cantor's case X = R in particular, arbitrary sets of real numbers are not available, so there it may indeed be necessary to start the process all over again. In set theory It is possible to give a precise meaning to the claim that SN is the universe of ordinary mathematics; it is a model of Zermelo set theory, the axiomatic set theory originally developed by Ernst Zermelo in 1908. Zermelo set theory was successful precisely because it was capable of axiomatising \\"ordinary\\" mathematics, fulfilling the programme begun by Cantor over 30 years earlier. But Zermelo set theory proved insufficient for the further development of axiomatic set theory and other work in the foundations of mathematics, especially model theory. For a dramatic example, the description of the superstructure process above cannot itself be carried out in Zermelo set theory. The final step, forming S as an infinitary union, requires the axiom of replacement, which was added to Zermelo set theory in 1922 to form Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory, the set of axioms most widely accepted today. So while ordinary mathematics may be done in SN, discussion of SN goes beyond the \\"ordinary\\", into metamathematics. But if high-powered set theory is brought in, the superstructure process above reveals itself to be merely the beginning of a transfinite recursion. Going back to X = {}, the empty set, and introducing the (standard) notation Vi for Si{}, V0 = {}, V1 = P{}, and so on as before. But what used to be called \\"superstructure\\" is now just the next item on the list: Vœâ, where œâ is the first infinite ordinal number. This can be extended to arbitrary ordinal numbers: : V_{i} := \\\\bigcup_{j defines Vi for any ordinal number i. The union of all of the Vi is the von Neumann universe V: : V := \\\\bigcup_{i} V_{i} \\\\\\\\! . Every individual Vi is a set, but their union V is a proper class. The axiom of foundation, which was added to ZF set theory at around the same time as the axiom of replacement, says that every set belongs to V. : Kurt G√∂del's constructible universe L and the axiom of constructibility : Inaccessible cardinals yield models of ZF and sometimes additional axioms, and are equivalent to the existence of the Grothendieck universe set In predicate calculus In an interpretation of first-order logic, the universe (or domain of discourse) is the set of individuals (individual constants) over which the quantifiers range. A proposition such as is ambiguous, if no domain of discourse has been identified. In one interpretation, the domain of discourse could be the set of real numbers; in another interpretation, it could be the set of natural numbers. If the domain of discourse is the set of real numbers, the proposition is false, with as counterexample; if the domain is the set of naturals, the proposition is true, since 2 is not the square of any natural number. In category theory There is another approach to universes which is historically connected with category theory. This is the idea of a Grothendieck universe. Roughly speaking, a Grothendieck universe is a set inside which all the usual operations of set theory can be performed. This version of a universe is defined to be any set for which the following axioms hold:Mac Lane 1998, p. 22 # x\\\\in u\\\\in U implies x\\\\in U # u\\\\in U and v\\\\in U imply {u,v}, (u,v), and u\\\\times v\\\\in U. # x\\\\in U implies \\\\mathcal{P}x\\\\in U and \\\\cup x\\\\in U # \\\\omega\\\\in U (here \\\\omega=\\\\\\\\{0,1,2,...\\\\\\\\} is the set of all finite ordinals.) # if f:a\\\\to b is a surjective function with a\\\\in U and b\\\\subset U, then b\\\\in U. The advantage of a Grothendieck universe is that it is actually a set, and never a proper class. The disadvantage is that if one tries hard enough, one can leave a Grothendieck universe. The most common use of a Grothendieck universe U is to take U as a replacement for the category of all sets. One says that a set S is U-small if S ‚ààU, and U-large otherwise. The category U-Set of all U-small sets has as objects all U-small sets and as morphisms all functions between these sets. Both the object set and the morphism set are sets, so it becomes possible to discuss the category of \\"all\\" sets without invoking proper classes. Then it becomes possible to define other categories in terms of this new category. For example, the category of all U-small categories is the category of all categories whose object set and whose morphism set are in U. Then the usual arguments of set theory are applicable to the category of all categories, and one does not have to worry about accidentally talking about proper classes. Because Grothendieck universes are extremely large, this suffices in almost all applications. Often when working with Grothendieck universes, mathematicians assume the Axiom of Universes: \\"For any set x, there exists a universe U such that x ‚ààU.\\" The point of this axiom is that any set one encounters is then U-small for some U, so any argument done in a general Grothendieck universe can be applied. This axiom is closely related to the existence of strongly inaccessible cardinals. In type theory In some type theories, especially in systems with dependent types, types themselves can be regarded as terms. There is a type called the universe (often denoted \\\\mathcal{U}) which has types as its elements. To avoid paradoxes such as Girard's paradox (an analogue of Russell's paradox for type theory), type theories are often equipped with a countably infinite hierarchy of such universes, with each universe being a term of the next one. There are at least two kinds of universes that one can consider in type theory: Russell-style universes (named after Bertrand Russell) and Tarski-style universes (named after Alfred Tarski).\\"Universe in Homotopy Type Theory\\" in nLabZhaohui Luo, \\"Notes on Universes in Type Theory\\", 2012.Per Martin-L√∂f, Intuitionistic Type Theory, Bibliopolis, 1984, pp. 88 and 91. A Russell-style universe is a type whose terms are types. A Tarski-style universe is a type together with an interpretation operation allowing us to regard its terms as types.

Historically the term psychopannychism was also used, despite problems with the etymology and application. The term thnetopsychism has also been used; for example, Gordon Campbell (2008) identified Milton as believing in the latter. though in fact both De doctrina Christiana and Paradise Lost refer to death as \\"sleep\\" and the dead as being \\"raised from sleep\\". The difference is difficult to identify in practice. Related and contrasting viewpoints of life after death include universal reconciliation, where all souls are immortal (or are mortal, but universally given continuance) and eventually are reconciled, and special salvation, where a positive afterlife is exclusively held by just some souls. Christian mortalism has been taught by several theologians and church organizations throughout history while also facing opposition from aspects of Christian organized religion. The Roman Catholic Church condemned such thinking in the Fifth Council of the Lateran as \\"erroneous assertions\\". Supporters include the sixteenth-century religious figure Martin Luther and the eighteenth-century religious figure Henry Layton, among many others. Etymology and terminology Since the phrases \\"soul sleep\\" or \\"soul death\\" do not occur either in the Bible or in early Anabaptist materials, an explanation is required for the origin of the term. Additionally, several other terms have been introduced which relate to the view. Modern theologians have used the term \\"Christian mortalism\\" and related wordings from the 21st century onwards. =Soul sleep= The phrase soul sleep appears to have been popularised by John Calvin in the subtitle to his Latin tract Psychopannychia (, , , ). The title of the booklet comes from Greek psyche (soul, mind) with pan-nychis (œÄŒ±ŒΩ-ŒΩœÖœáŒØœÇ, all-night vigil, all-night banquet),.. so Psychopannychia, originally, represents Calvin's view; that the soul was conscious, active. The title and subtitle of the 1542 Strasbourg 1st edition read: . The title and subtitle of the 1545 2nd Latin edition read: . The 1558 French edition was a translation of that of the 1545 2nd edition: =Other terms= * \\"Psychopannychism\\" ‚Äì In the Latin it is clearer that Psychopannychia is actually the refutation of, the opposite of, the idea of soul sleep. The version may have caused the confusion that by -pannychis Calvin meant sleep (in Greek -hypnos not -pannychis, vigil).. The subtitle was taken up as .. The tract first appeared in English as . Luther's use of similar language (but this time defending the view) appears in print only a few years after Calvin: * \\"Hypnopsychism\\" ‚Äì from hypno- + psyche (\\"sleep of soul\\") was a more correct coinage from Greek than that of Calvin's editor. Eustratios of Constantinople (after 582) denounced mortalism as a heresy using this term. * \\"Thnetopsychism\\" ‚Äì A possibly contrasting phrase is (from Greek thnetos [mortal] + psyche [soul, mind])., 320 pp. The term has its origin in the descriptions of Eusebius of Caesarea and John of Damascus of mortalist views among Arab Christians, says that the Thnetopsychists hold that the human soul is like that of the beasts, for it is destroyed with the body. In the 1600s also this phrase was applied also to the views of Tyndale, Luther and other mortalists, from awareness that Calvin's term Psychopannychia originally described his own belief, not the belief he was calling error. The term is also used of the view of the Anabaptists. Their view is that the soul dies, with the body to be recalled to life at the resurrection of the dead, or that the soul is not separate from the body and so there is no \\"spiritual\\" self to survive bodily death. In both cases, the deceased does not begin to enjoy a reward or suffer a punishment until Judgment Day. Mortalist arguments Historically, Christian mortalists have advanced theological, lexical, and scientific arguments in support of their position. =Theological arguments= Some early eastern Christians argued for mortalism on the basis of the identity of blood with life in Leviticus 17:11.. Theological arguments which contended that the continued existence of the soul was not taught in the Bible were made by mortalists such as Francis Blackburne, Joseph Priestley,. and Samuel Bourne. Mortalists such as Richard Overton advanced a combination of theological and philosophical arguments in favor of mortalism. Thomas Hobbes likewise made extensive use of theological argumentation.. Some mortalists viewed their beliefs as a return to original Christian teaching... Mortalist theological arguments were also used to contest the Roman Catholic doctrine of purgatory and masses for the dead.. =Lexical arguments= In the late eighteenth century, the standard Hebrew lexicon and grammar of John Parkhurst. expressed the view that the traditional rendering of the Hebrew word nephesh as reference to an immortal soul, had no lexical support.. Mortalists in the nineteenth century used lexical arguments to deny the traditional doctrines of hell and the immortal soul.. =Scientific arguments= The eighteenth-century mortalist Henry Layton presented arguments based on physiology. Scientific arguments became important to the nineteenth-century discussion of mortalism and natural immortality,. and mortalist Miles Grant cited extensively from a number of scientists who observed that the immortality of the soul was unsupported by scientific evidence. Historic proponents of the mortality of the soul The mortality of the soul has been held throughout the history of both Judaism and Christianity. =Judaism= Modern scholars believe the concept of an immortal soul going to bliss or torment after death entered mainstream Judaism after the Babylonian exile and existed throughout the Second Temple era, though both 'soul sleep' and 'soul death', were also held. Mortalism is present in certain Second Temple period pseudepigraphal works,.... later rabbinical works,. and among medieval era rabbis such as Abraham Ibn Ezra (1092‚Äì1167), Maimonides (1135‚Äì1204), and Joseph Albo (1380‚Äì1444). Some authorities within Conservative Judaism, notably Neil Gillman, also support the notion that the souls of the dead are unconscious until the resurrection.Gillman, Neil. The Death of Death: Resurrection and Immortality in Jewish Thought. Jewish Lights, 1997. Traditional rabbinic Judaism, however, has always been of the opinion that belief in immortality of at least most souls, and punishment and reward after death, was a consistent belief back through the giving of the Torah at Mt. Sinai. Traditional Judaism reads the Torah accordingly. As an example, the punishment of kareth (excision) is understood to mean that soul is cut off from God in the afterlife... =Christian views= Second to eighth centuries The earliest unambiguous instance of Christian mortalism is found in Tatian's Address to the Greeks from the second half of the second century. Tatian writes: \\"The soul is not in itself immortal... If, indeed, it knows not the truth, it dies, and is dissolved with the body, but rises again at last at the end of the world with the body, receiving death by punishment in immortality. But, again, if it acquires the knowledge of God, it dies not, although for a time it be dissolved.\\" CHAP. XIII., retrieved 7 July 2018 Tatian's contemporary Athenagoras of Athens came close to mortalism by teaching that souls sleep dreamlessly between death and resurrection: \\"[T]hose who are dead and those who sleep are subject to similar states, as regards at least the stillness and the absence of all sense of the present or the past, or rather of existence itself and their own life.\\"CHAP. XVI., retrieved 7 July 2018 However, the best-known case of mortalism in the early church is that recorded by Eusebius of Caesarea: This synod in Arabia would have been during the reign of Emperor Philip the Arab (244‚Äì249).. Redepenning (1841). was of the opinion that Eusebius' terminology here, \\"the human soul dies\\" was probably that of their critics rather than the Arabian Christians' own expression and they were more likely simply \\"psychopannychists\\", believers in \\"soul sleep\\". Some Syriac writers such as Aphrahat, Ephrem and Narsai believed in the dormition, or \\"sleep\\", of the soul, in which \\"...souls of the dead...are largely inert, having lapsed into a state of sleep, in which they can only dream of their future reward or punishments.\\" John of Damascus denounced the ideas of some Arab Christians as thnetopsychism (\\"soul death\\"). Eustratios of Constantinople (after 582) denounced this and what he called hypnopsychism (\\"soul sleep\\"). The issue was connected to that of the intercession of saints. The writings of Christian ascetic Isaac of Nineveh (d. 700), reflect several perspectives which include mortalism.. Ninth to fifteenth centuries Mortalism evidently persisted since various Byzantine writers had to defend the doctrine of the veneration of saints against those who said the saints sleep. John the Deacon (eleventh century) attacked those who \\"dare to say that praying to the saints is like shouting in the ears of the deaf, as if they had drunk from the mythical waters of Oblivion.\\". Pope John XXII inadvertently caused the beatific vision controversy (1331‚Äì34) by suggesting that the saved do not attain the Beatific Vision, or \\"see God\\" until Judgment Day (in Italian: Visione beatifica differita, \\"deferred beatific vision\\"), which was a view possibly consistent with soul sleep. The Sacred College of Cardinals held a consistory on the problem in January 1334, and Pope John conceded to the more orthodox understanding. His successor, in that same year, Pope Benedict XII, declared that the righteous do see Heaven prior to the final judgement. In 1536, Pope Benedict XII issued the papal bull Benedictus Deus. This document defined the Church's belief that the souls of the departed go to their eternal reward immediately after death, as opposed to remaining in a state of unconscious existence until the Last Judgment.Benedictus Deus on papalencyclicals.net The Reformation Mortalism re-emerged in Christianity when it was promoted by some Reformation leaders, and it survives today mostly among Restorationist sects, such as Seventh-day Adventist Church. Conti has argued that during the Reformation both psychosomnolence (the belief that the soul sleeps until the resurrection) and thnetopsychism (the belief that the body and soul both die and then both rise again) were quite common.. William Tyndale (1494‚Äì1536) argued against Thomas More in favour of soul sleep: Morey suggests that John Wycliffe (1320‚Äì84) and Tyndale taught the doctrine of soul sleep \\"as the answer to the Catholic teachings of purgatory and masses for the dead.\\". Many Anabaptists in this period, such as Michael Sattler (1490‚Äì1527),.. were Christian mortalists. However, the best known advocate of soul sleep was Martin Luther (1483‚Äì1546). In writing on Ecclesiastes, Luther says Elsewhere Luther states that J√ºrgen Moltmann (2000) concludes from this that \\"Luther conceived the state of the dead as a deep, dreamless sleep, removed from time and space, without consciousness and without feeling.\\". That Luther believed in soul sleep is also the view of . Some writers have claimed that Luther changed his view later in life. Gottfried Fritschel (1867) argued that quotations from Luther's Latin works had occasionally been misread in Latin or in German translation to contradict or qualify specific statements and Luther's overall teaching, namely that the sleep of the dead was unconscious:. These readings can still be found in some English sources.. The two most frequently cited passages are: * \\"It is certain that to this day Abraham is serving God, just as Abel, Noah are serving God. And this we should carefully note; for it is divine truth that Abraham is living, serving God, and ruling with Him. But what sort of life that may be, whether he is asleep or awake, is another question. How the soul is resting we are not to know, but it is certain that it is living.\\". * \\"A man tired with his daily labour... sleeps. But his soul does not sleep (Anima autem non-sic dormit) but is awake (sed vigilat). It experiences visions and the discourses of the angels and of God. Therefore the sleep in the future life is deeper than it is in this life. Nevertheless, the soul lives to God. This is the likeness to the sleep of life.\\". As such, Lutheran Churches affirm that \\"The Confessions rule out the contemporary view that death is a pleasant and painless transition into a perfect world\\" and reject both the ideas that \\"the soul is by nature and by virtue of an inherent quality immortal\\" and that \\"the soul 'sleeps' between death and the resurrection in such a way that it is not conscious of bliss\\". On the other hand, others believing in Christian mortalism included Camillo Renato (1540), M√°ty√°s D√©vai B√≠r√≥ (1500‚Äì45), Michael Servetus (1511‚Äì53), Laelio Sozzini (1562), Fausto Sozzini (1563), the Polish Brethren (1565 onwards), Dirk Philips (1504‚Äì68), Gregory Paul of Brzezin (1568), the Socinians (1570‚Äì1800),. John Frith (1573), George Schomann (1574) and Simon Budny (1576). Seventeenth to eighteenth centuries Soul sleep was a significant minority view from the eighth to the seventeenth centuries,. and soul death became increasingly common from the Reformation onwards. Soul sleep has been called a \\"major current of seventeenth century protestant ideology.\\". John Milton wrote in his unpublished De Doctrina Christiana, Gordon Campbell (2008) identifies Milton's views as \\"thnetopsychism\\", a belief that the soul dies with the body but is resurrected at the last judgment.. however Milton speaks also of the dead as \\"asleep\\".De Doctrina Christiana citing 1Thess 4:17, Daniel 12:2 etc. Those holding this view include: 1600s: Sussex Baptists. d. 1612: Edward Wightman. 1627: Samuel Gardner 1628: Samuel Przypkowski 1636: George Wither 1637: Joachim Stegmann. 1624: Richard Overton 1654: John Biddle (Unitarian). 1655: Matthew Caffyn 1658: Samuel Richardson. 1608‚Äì74: John Milton. 1588‚Äì1670: Thomas Hobbes 1605‚Äì82: Thomas Browne 1622‚Äì1705: Henry Layton 1702: William Coward 1632‚Äì1704: John LockeNuvo (ed.), 'John Locke: Writings on Religion', p. xxxiii (2002) 1643‚Äì1727: Isaac Newton. 1676‚Äì1748: Pietro Giannone. 1751: William Kenrick 1755: Edmund Law. 1759: Samuel Bourn. 1723‚Äì91: Richard Price. 1718‚Äì97: Peter Peckard. 1733‚Äì1804: Joseph Priestley. Francis Blackburne (1765). Nineteenth to twentieth centuries Belief in conditional immortality and the annihilation of the unsaved became increasingly common during the nineteenth century,.. entering mainstream Christianity in the twentieth century.. From this point it is possible to speak in terms of entire groups holding the belief, and only the most prominent individual nineteenth-century advocates of the doctrine will be mentioned here. Others include: Millerites (from 1833), Edward White (1846),. Christadelphians (from 1848),. Thomas Thayer (1855),; no relation to Joseph Henry Thayer lexicographer. Fran√ßois Gaussen (d. 1863), Henry Constable (1873),. Louis Burnier (Waldensian, d. 1878), the Baptist Conditionalist Association (1878), Cameron Mann (1888),. Emmanuel P√©tavel-Olliff (1891), Miles Grant (1895), George Gabriel Stokes (1897). =Modern Christian groups= Present-day defenders of mortalism include Nicky Gumbel, some Lutherans, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Advent Christian Church, the Afterlife group,. Christadelphians, the Church of God (Seventh Day), Church of God (7th day) ‚Äì Salem Conference, the Church of God Abrahamic Faith, and various other Church of God organizations and related denominations which adhered to the older teachings of Herbert W. Armstrong's Worldwide Church of God and the Bible Student movement. Jehovah's Witnesses teach a form of thnetopsychism, in that the soul is the body (Genesis 2:7) and that it dies (Ezekiel 18:20; Ecclesiastes 9:5,10). They believe that 144,000 chosen ones will receive immortality in heaven to rule as kings and priests with Christ in Heaven (Rev 7:4; 14:1,3) but all the other saved will be raised from the dead on the last day (John 5:28,29) to receive eternal life on a Paradise Earth (Revelation 7:9,14,17). Opponents =Immortality of the soul= The orthodox Christian belief about the intermediate state between death and the Last Judgment is immortality of the soul followed immediately after death of the body by particular judgment. In Catholicism some souls temporarily stay in Purgatory to be purified for Heaven (as described in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1030‚Äì32). Eastern Orthodoxy, Methodism, Anglicanism, and Mormonism use different terminology, but generally teach that the soul waits in the Abode of the Dead, specifically Hades or the Spirit World, until the resurrection of the dead, the saved resting in light and the damned suffering in darkness.http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Spirit_World. According to James Tabor this Eastern Orthodox picture of particular judgment is similar to the first-century Jewish and possibly Early Christian. concept that the dead either \\"rest in peace\\" in the Bosom of Abraham (mentioned in the Gospel of Luke) or suffer in Hades. This view was also promoted by John Calvin, although Calvin taught that immortality was not in the nature of the soul but was imparted by God. Nineteenth-century Reformed theologians such as A. A. Hodge, W. G. T. Shedd, and Louis Berkhof also taught the immortality of the soul, but some later Reformed theologians such as Herman Bavinck and G. C. Berkouwer rejected the idea as unscriptural. Opponents of psychopannychism (soul sleeping) and thnetopsychism (the temporary death of the soul) include the Roman Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church (that also teach about Intercession of saints, connected to this subject), most mainline Protestant denominations, and most conservative Protestants, Evangelicals, and Fundamentalists. Believers in the opposing concept of universal reconciliation, arguing that salvation will eventually be received by all of humanity, have also referred to various books of the New Testament that seem to describe grace given to immortal souls such as the First Epistle to the Corinthians. The sections of 1 Corinthians 15:22, \\"As all die in Adam, so all will be made alive in Christ\\", and 1 Corinthians 15:28, \\"God will be all in all\\", are cited. Verses that seem to contradict the tradition of complete damnation and come up in arguments also include Lamentations 3:31‚Äì33 (NIV), \\"For no one is cast off by the Lord forever. Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is his unfailing love\\",https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lamentations+3%3A31-33&version;=NIV and 1 Timothy 4:10 (NIV), \\"We have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, and especially of those who believe.\\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+4%3A10&version;=NIV As well, the Epistle to the Colossians receives attention, with Colossians 1:17‚Äì20 reading: =Roman Catholic Church= The Roman Catholic Church has called \\"soul mortality\\" a serious heresy: = The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints = The idea that the spirit continues as a conscious, active, and independent agent after mortal death is an important teaching of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Concerning the post-death, pre-judgment place of human spirits, LDS scripture states that \\"the spirits of all men, whether they be good or evil, are taken home to that God who gave them life\\" (Alma 40:11). They are then assigned to a state of paradise or hell (called Spirit Prison) in the spirit world depending on their faith in Christ and the manner of their mortal life (Alma 40:12‚Äì14). The Spirits remain in these states until the final judgment, when they are either received into a state of glory in the Kingdom of God, or they are cast off into Outer Darkness.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saintshttp://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Judgment Latter-Day Saint doctrine differs from Eastern Orthodox doctrine in that LDS doctrine teaches that the souls in Prison who ended up there due to ignorance or inability to accept Christ may be preached to while in Prison so that they may accept Christ.http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Spirit_Prison This is derived from the LDS interpretation of 1 Peter 3:18‚Äì20 where Christ is described as preaching to the \\"dead who were in prison\\" and 1 Peter 4:5‚Äì6, which states: Like many Eastern Orthodox and Catholics, the LDS Church teaches that the prayers of the righteous living may be of help to the dead, but the LDS Church takes this one step further with vicarious sacraments (called \\"ordinances\\" but with a sacramental theological meaning). The LDS Church preaches the necessity of baptism by water and the Holy Ghost (Baptism and Confirmation) for salvation. They teach that previously ignorant spirits who accept Christ in Spirit Prison may receive saving ordinances through vicarious Baptism and Confirmation of the living.http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Baptism_for_the_Dead This is drawn from 1st Corinthians 15, wherein the Apostle Paul is arguing against a group of Christians who are mistakenly denying the physical resurrection of the dead. Paul asks them in 1st Corinthians 15:29: :29 Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead? The LDS Church believes that this is a reference to vicarious work for the dead which was practiced by the ancient Christian Church and considered orthodox in Early Christianity, including by the Apostle Paul, hence his use of it as an example of the correct doctrine of the resurrection. This is the origin of the LDS practice of baptism for the dead. As such, a great deal of LDS doctrine and practice is tied to the idea of the continued existence and activity of the human spirit after death and before judgment. Modern scholarship As early as 1917 Harvey W. Scott wrote \\"That there is no definite affirmation, in the Old Testament of the doctrine of a future life, or personal immortality, is the general consensus of Biblical scholarship.\\". The modern scholarly consensus is that the canonical teaching of the Old Testament made no reference to an \\"immortal soul\\" independent of the body... This view is represented consistently in a wide range of scholarly reference works... According to Donelley, \\"Twentieth century biblical scholarship largely agrees that the ancient Jews had little explicit notion of a personal afterlife until very late in the Old Testament period,\\" and \\"only the latest stratum of the Old Testament asserts even the resurrection of the body.\\" Scholars have noted that the notion of the \\"disembodied existence of a soul in bliss\\" is not in accordance with a Hebrew world view: \\"While Hebrew thought world distinguished soul from body (as material basis of life), there was no question of two separate, independent entities.\\". Gillman argues that However, N. T. Wright suggests that \\"the Bible offers a spectrum of belief about life after death.\\" While Goldingay suggests that Qohelet points out that there is no evidence that \\"human beings would enjoy a positive afterlife,\\" Philip Johnston argues that a few Psalms, such as Psalm 16, Psalm 49 and Psalm 73, \\"affirm a continued communion with God after death,\\" but \\"give no elaboration of how, when or where this communion will take place.\\" Neyrey suggests that, \\"for a Hebrew, 'soul' indicated the unity of a human person,\\" and \\"this Hebrew field of meaning is breached in the Wisdom of Solomon by explicit introduction of Greek ideas of soul. Avery-Peck argues that Regardless of the character of the soul's existence in the intermediate state, biblical scholarship affirms that a disembodied soul is unnatural and at best transitional. Bromiley argues that \\"the soul and the body belong together, so that without either the one or the other there is no true man. Disembodied existence in Sheol is unreal. Paul does not seek a life outside the body, but wants to be clothed with a new and spiritual body (1 Cor. 15; 2 Cor. 5).\\" The mortalist disbelief in the existence of a naturally immortal soul, is affirmed as biblical teaching by a range of standard scholarly Jewish and Christian sources. The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Modern Christian Thought (1995) says, \\"There is no concept of an immortal soul in the Old Testament, nor does the New Testament ever call the human soul immortal.\\". Harper's Bible Dictionary (1st ed. 1985) says that \\"For a Hebrew, 'soul' indicated the unity of a human person; Hebrews were living bodies, they did not have bodies\\". says, \\"But to the Bible man is not a soul in a body but a body/soul unity\\".. says, \\"Scripture does not present even a rudimentarily developed theology of the soul\\" and \\"The notion of the soul as an independent force that animates human life but that can exist apart from the human body‚Äîeither prior to conception and birth or subsequent to life and death‚Äîis the product only of later Judaism\\". The says that the Septuagint translated the Hebrew word nefesh by the Greek word psyche, but the latter does not have the same sense in Greek thought.. The says, \\"Far from referring simply to one aspect of a person, \\"soul\\" refers to the whole person\\".. The says, \\"Possibly Jn. 6:33 also includes an allusion to the general life-giving function. This teaching rules out all ideas of an emanation of the soul.\\" and \\"The soul and the body belong together, so that without either the one or the other there is no true man\\". The says, \\"Indeed, the salvation of the \\"immortal soul\\" has sometimes been a commonplace in preaching, but it is fundamentally unbiblical.\\" The says \\"The Hebrew Bible does not present the human soul (nepe≈°) or spirit (r√ªah) as an immortal substance, and for the most part it envisions the dead as ghosts in Sheol, the dark, sleepy underworld\\".. The says, \\"there is practically no specific teaching on the subject in the Bible beyond an underlying assumption of some form of afterlife (see immortality)\\".. The says \\"It is this essential soul-body oneness that provides the uniqueness of the biblical concept of the resurrection of the body as distinguished from the Greek idea of the immortality of the soul\\". The mortalist disbelief in the existence of a naturally immortal soul is also affirmed as biblical teaching by various modern theologians,.... and Hebblethwaite observes the doctrine of immortality of the soul is \\"not popular amongst Christian theologians or among Christian philosophers today\\"..

Early life Wade was born in Marshallville, Georgia. His father was a country doctor who served as a surgeon in the Civil War. Wade was descended from the first governor of Georgia, John Adam Treutlen. Wade received his bachelor's degree from the University of Georgia in 1914. While a student there, he was a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society and was awarded Phi Beta Kappa. Wade later earned a master's degree from Harvard University in 1915. Since Harvard didn't have a concentration in American literature at that time, Wade completed his Doctorate at Columbia University in 1924, studying under Dr. Trent. He served in World War I. Career Wade was a teacher at the University of Georgia between 1919 and 1926 where he was a key founder of the graduate program in American literature. Wade developed an interest in biography and published Augustus Baldwin Longstreet: A Study in the Development of Culture in the South in 1925 and published a biography of Methodist Church leader John Wesley in 1930. His research for his Wesley biography was financed by a Guggenheim grant and took him to England to gather information. Wade researched and wrote 116 biographical sketches for the Dictionary of American Biography and served as an assistant editor for that work in 1927 and 1928. By 1930 Wade was teaching at Vanderbilt University as a member of the English faculty and became involved with the Southern Agrarians. Wade is probably best remembered for his contribution to the Agrarian manifesto I'll Take My Stand, which was named by Wade and published that year. His contribution to the manifesto was \\"The Live and Death of Cousin Lucius,\\" an exemplum of the Agrarian life. He also contributed to the Agrarian follow-up to \\"I\\"ll Take My Stand\\" with his essay \\"Of the Mean and Sure Estate.\\" He returned to the University of Georgia to be the head of the Department of Language and Literature, a position he held for many years. In the 1930s and 1940s Wade wrote critical essays on Southern culture and biographical sketches of Southern literary and political figures that were published in learned journals such as the Virginia Quarterly. He also continued to support his agrarian ideals in his writing. In 1941 he co-edited Masterworks of World Literature. In 1950 he retired from active teaching but continued to work as founding editor of The Georgia Review and was active in his local community, forming the Marshallville Foundation to foster his home town. He became a horticulturist and planted many gardens with plants from all over the world. Death Wade died on October 9, 1963 in Marshallville.

Early life Ernest Becker was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, to Jewish immigrant parents. Serving in the infantry during World War II, he would help liberate a Nazi concentration camp. Once completing his military service, Becker attended Syracuse University in New York. Upon graduation he joined the U.S. Embassy in Paris as an administrative officer. In his early 30s, he returned to Syracuse University to pursue graduate studies in cultural anthropology, and would complete his PhD in 1960. The first of his nine books, Zen: A Rational Critique (1961) was based on his doctoral dissertation. Career After graduating from Syracuse University in 1960, Becker began his career as a professor and writer. Becker taught anthropology in the Department of Psychiatry at the Upstate Medical College in Syracuse, New York. Becker was summarily fired, along with other non-tenured professors, for supporting tenured Professor Thomas Szasz in a dispute with the administration over academic freedom. After a year in Italy, Becker was hired back at Syracuse University, this time in the School of Education. In 1965, Becker acquired a lecturer position at the University of California, Berkeley in the anthropology program. However, trouble again arose between Becker and the administration, leading to his departure from the university. At the time, thousands of students petitioned to keep Becker at the school and offered to pay his salary, but the petition did not succeed in retaining Becker. In 1967, he taught at San Francisco State's Department of Psychology until January 1969 when he resigned in protest against the administration's stringent policies against student demonstrations. In 1969, Becker began a professorship at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, British Columbia, where he would spend the remaining years of his academic life. During the next five years, he wrote his 1974 Pulitzer Prize-winning work, The Denial of Death. Additionally, he worked on the second edition to The Birth and Death of Meaning, and wrote Escape from Evil. Becker's insistence on interdisciplinary work, along with the fact that students flocked to his lectures, which were marked by a high level of theatricality, did not endear him to many of his colleagues. Referring to his insistence on the importance symbolism plays in the human animal, he wrote, \\"I have tried to correct... bias by showing how deep theatrical 'superficialities' really go.\\" Theory Becker was fired from his first academic position at Upstate Medical College in Syracuse, NY before attaining tenure, as a result of a dispute the school had with \\"anti-psychiatrist\\" Thomas Szasz. For this reason, Szasz's views are sometimes imputed to Becker. However, Becker's support of Szasz was limited to the issue of academic freedom‚Äîwhether or not Szasz (who had tenure) had the right to teach his views to psychiatry students. During this early period Becker was formulating a \\"fully transactional\\" view of mental health that eventually formed the basis for his book, Revolution in Psychiatry (1964). Although Szasz is cited on a few key points in this book, Becker pursues a very distinct path.Liechty, Daniel. 1995. Transference & Transcendence: Ernest Becker's Contribution to Psychotherapy. New Jersey: Jason Aronson. . Becker eventually came to the position that psychological inquiry can only bring us to a distinct threshold, beyond which belief systems must be invoked to satisfy the human psyche. The reach of such a perspective consequently encompasses science and religion, even to what Sam Keen suggests is Becker's greatest achievement, the creation of the Escape from Evil.Becker, Ernest. [1975] 1985. Escape from Evil. New York: Free Press. . In formulating his theories Becker drew on the work of S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Sigmund Freud, Wilhelm Reich, Norman O. Brown, Erich Fromm, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and especially Otto Rank. Becker came to believe that individual character is essentially formed around the process of denying one's own mortality, that this denial is a necessary component of functioning in the world, and that this character-armor masks and obscures genuine self-knowledge. Much of the evil in the world, he believed, was a consequence of this need to deny death. Becker also wrote The Birth and Death of Meaning, which gets its title from the concept of mankind progressing from simple-minded ape to a world of symbols and illusions, and then deconstructing those illusions through our own evolving intellect.  Death  In November 1972, Ernest Becker was diagnosed with colon cancer. Two years later, on 6 March 1974, he would pass away at the age of 49 in Burnaby, British Columbia. Shortly before his death, he participated in a series of interviews with Sam Keen for Psychology Today. Flight From Death (2003) is a documentary film directed by Patrick Shen, based on Becker's work, and partially funded by the Ernest Becker Foundation. After his death, the Ernest Becker Foundation was founded, focused on multidisciplinary inquiries into human behavior. The foundation would focus on reducing violence in human society, using Becker's basic ideas to support research and application at the interfaces of science, the humanities, social action, and religion. Two months following his death, Becker was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for his book, The Denial of Death (1973), posthumously gaining him wider recognition. Escape From Evil (1975) was intended as a significant extension of the line of reasoning begun in The Denial of Death, developing the social and cultural implications of the concepts explored in the earlier book. Although the manuscript's second half was left unfinished at the time of his death, it was completed from the manuscript that existed as well as from notes on the unfinished chapter. Influence Becker's work, particularly as expressed in his later books, The Denial of Death and Escape from Evil, have had a significant impact on social psychology and the psychology of religion. Terror management theory, an important research programme in social psychology that has spawned over 200 published studies has turned Becker's views on the cultural influence of death anxiety into a scientific theory that helps to explain such diverse human phenomena as self-esteem, prejudice, and religion.

It was developed by retired combat-arms Marine Ron Donvito. Officially, the name stands for Linear Infighting Neural Override Engagement; this is, however, a backronym coined during the project's inception.  Design  The system was designed to be executed within specific and stringent combat-oriented conditions: * (a.) all techniques must not be vision dominant; techniques may be executed effectively in low-light conditions, or other impaired visibility conditions (i.e., smoke or gas) * (b.) extreme mental and physical fatigue * (c.) usable by the Marine / soldier while wearing full combat gear * (d.) proper execution of the techniques must cause death to the opponent * (e.) gender neutrality; must be usable by‚Äîand against‚Äîeither gender These parameters are viewed as the most likely conditions that a combat Marine or Soldier would face in close-range combat, since most close combat engagements were likely to occur at night or under reduced visibility, while the Marine was fatigued and wearing his combat load, and when facing asymmetrical odds, such as a numerically superior force. These requirements meant that many flamboyant techniques, exotic kicks, or movements requiring extraordinary feats of strength or agility were excluded from consideration under the LINE system. Techniques like classic judo \\"hip throws\\", for instance, were excluded because of the possibility of entanglement on a practitioner's war-belt. The system's techniques were designed to be easily learned and retained through repetition. The requirement and demands that the system be drilled, repeated, and constantly revisited has led to some criticism since the primary users - military and special operations personnel- often have enormous demands upon their time, and as a consequence often lacked the ability to maintain high degrees of proficiency in the techniques.  History  USMC: LINE was adopted by the Marine Corps in 1989 at a Course Content Review Board (CRB) at Quantico, Virginia. All techniques were demonstrated for and deemed medically feasible by the Armed Forces Medical Examiner (given a single attack opponent) and a board of forensic pathologists from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) in 1991. LINE was replaced by the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP) by Marine Corps Order 1500.54, published in 2002, although it had been actually dropped in 1998, as a \\"revolutionary step in the development of martial arts skills for Marines and replaces all other close-combat related systems preceding its introduction.\\" MCO 1500.54A Military combatives instruction programs‚Äîand the contracts awarded for it‚Äîare undertaken through a system of competition, in which the systems are compared by review boards, and presented by individual subject matter experts. Review boards may, from time to time, choose one system over another, based on the changing needs of the Marine Corps or other military service. In the case of LINE Combatives, the system was repeatedly reviewed and approved for training by many units over more than two decades. LINE Combatives continues to be one of only two systems reviewed and consulted upon by specially tasked and appointed boards of military medical examiners. The LINE Combatives system is presently sought by advanced students, officers, and military personnel throughout the special operations, high risk law enforcement, government agency, and private contractor industries. Units trained include (but are not limited to): * 1st SWTG, United States Army * Special Forces, United States Army ** 1st SFG, United States Army ** 3rd SFG, United States Army ** 5th SFG, United States Army ** 7th SFG, United States Army ** 10th SFG, United States Army ** 19th SFG, United States Army ** 20th SFG, United States Army * SEAL Team II, United States Navy * 82nd Airborne Division, United States Army * 101st Airborne Division, United States Army * 3rd Infantry Division, United States Army * 4th Infantry Division, United States Army * 172nd Infantry Brigade Stryker, United States Army * SOC South, United States Army * 1st COSCOM, United States Army * 96th Civil Affairs, United States Army * 32nd MedCom, United States Army * 44th MedCom, United States Army * 112th Signal Bn, United States Army * 27th Engineer Bn, United States Army * 8th PsyOps, United States Army * 9th PsyOps, United States Army * CGSC, United States Army * 5th ASOS, United States Air Force 5th CBCG, United States Air Force US Army Special Forces: The LINE System was adopted in 1998 by U.S. Army Special Forces at the Special Forces Qualification Course (SFQC). Primary instruction took place during phase II and was remediated in phases III and V at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. LINE was replaced by the Modern Army Combatives Program (MACP) in October 2007. US Air Forces: In 2007 the Chief of Staff of the Air Force read an article in the Air Force Times about Airmen training in the LINE system and ordered a review of all hand-to-hand combat in the Air Force Eric Holmes. \\"Close combat Why are thousands of airmen learning a brand of fighting ditched by Marines and Army SF?\\" Air Force Times, cover story. 1 July 2007.]MAJ James Blanton. \\"Hand to Hand Combatives in the US Army\\" Thesis present to the staff of the US Army Command and General Staff College. 2008. which resulted in the Air Force adopting a program based upon the Army Combatives Program.

Like the emergency telephone number 9-1-1, 2-1-1 is one of the eight N11 codes of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP).  History  =United States= For many years, New York Telephone (now a unit of Verizon) used 2-1-1 as an automated credit request number for disconnected or mis- dialed calls. This service was in service from the 1970s through the early 2000s. Before the introduction of direct long distance dialing, the long- distance operator was reached by dialing 2-1-1 in order to place a long- distance call. When the states in the US and provinces in Canada were assigned area codes in 1947 by The North American Numbering Plan , direct long distance dialing using the area code + local number was slowly introduced starting in 1951 eventually eliminating the use of 211. After that the local telephone providers designated \\"00\\" for long distance operator access. United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta was the first to introduce a 2-1-1 service in 1997. Many states began implementation plans soon after, aided by the United Way of America in partnership with the Alliance of Information and Referral Systems (AIRS). On July 20, 2000, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved 2-1-1 for nationwide use as a short number in the United States along with 5-1-1 for transportation. In Texas, particularly in the Coastal Bend area, 2-1-1 is also the number to call for elderly and handicapped people needing evacuation assistance in the event of a pending disaster such as a hurricane. As of 2017, close to 95% of the population in the U.S. (including Puerto Rico and Washington, DC) has access to 2-1-1 services. More than 200 agencies, including United Ways, provide 2-1-1 services. The largest population without access to 2-1-1 is the metro-Chicago area. In 2017, the 2-1-1 network in the U.S. answered close to 15 million requests for assistance through phone, text, and web chat. =Canada= The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved the use of 2-1-1 throughout Canada on August 9, 2001. The first Canadian 2-1-1 service opened in Toronto on June 13, 2002. 2-1-1 services are free of charge and multilingual in Canada. It is also available in Greater Montreal.  Operation  2-1-1 center hours vary. Many are open 24/7 to refer callers to organizations that provide services in such areas as: *Addiction counseling *Affordable housing *Alzheimer's assistance *Child care *Debt counseling *Disaster relief *Donation opportunities *Education *Emergency food, such as food banks and soup kitchens *ESL *Financial assistance *Homeless services *Job counseling *Parenting programs *Psychotherapy counseling *Senior citizen programs *Suicide prevention *Telephone reassurance, care for the elderly *Volunteer opportunities *Youth programs Where available, 2-1-1 is operated by a private non-profit community-service organization, local government or local United Ways, which are part of the broader United Way Worldwide network. 2-1-1 provides information and referral to callers on where to obtain assistance from local and national social service programs, local and national governmental agencies and local and national non-profit organizations as well as where to volunteer or make a donation locally. Referrals are often given from databases accessed by call specialists. These databases are maintained by 2-1-1 staff following stringent data management guidelines. The databases are typically local but in some cases linked together to form statewide databases. Many 2-1-1 centers are exploring Memorandums of Understanding with state and federal governments to facilitate the efficient handling of future disasters. Television or radio stations could easily tell citizens to call 2-1-1 in the event of an emergency. Call specialists at these centers would be informed of current disaster plans or places to receive help and could then inform the public of the correct course of action. After Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, and the Gulf Coast region, 2-1-1 centers were instrumental in coordinating with local government officials and providing information to communities before and after local disasters. Furthermore, 2-1-1 providers in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Florida were called upon to provide assistance to individuals fleeing Puerto Rico's devastation.  Availability  = United States = As of May 2017, the service is available in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. and 95% of the U.S. population has access to 2-1-1 services by dialing 2-1-1 on a landline or cell phone. In 2017, the 2-1-1 network answered close to 15 million requests for assistance by phone, text, and chat. = Canada = In Canada, 2-1-1 is available in the following places (starting dates in parentheses).

On November 26, 2007, the City of Windsor's website announced that 2-1-1 service for Windsor and Essex County began, and was being run by the United Way (who also runs the local 3-1-1 service). Plans to introduce 2-1-1 services are also in development in other Canadian communities. Ontario extended 2-1-1 province-wide in 2012 and Nova Scotia's province-wide 2-1-1 deployment will be fully operational in 2014. In British Columbia, 2-1-1 services are administered by bc211, and is available on Vancouver Island\\\\Gulf Islands and in the Metro Vancouver, Squamish- Lillooet, Sunshine Coast Regional District and Fraser Valley and regional districts, with plans to expand the services provincially. In some communities, unused X-1-1 codes were assigned as plant test numbers for telephone installers testing individual lines. In the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island, for instance, when 2-1-1 was dialed, it caused a busy signal to occur and the dialer's telephone line would \\"go dead\\" for several minutes afterward. These codes must first be \\"recovered\\" by moving the test functions elsewhere (958 and 959 are standard reserved local and long-distance test exchanges in most areas) to permit redeployment as local public information numbers.  Accreditation  = United States = The American accrediting body for 2-1-1 centers is the Alliance of Information & Referral Systems (AIRS). AIRS provides an in-depth accreditation process for 2-1-1 centers. AIRS also certifies 2-1-1 Call Center Representatives as Certified Information and Referral Specialists (CIRS), Certified Information and Referral Specialists for Aging (CIRS-A) and Certified Resource Specialists (CRS) annually. AIRS standards have been created to provide a benchmark for 2-1-1 centers and its staff. The standards regulate nationally how a 2-1-1 centers provides services and how they collect and store information. INFOLINE of Los Angeles, an information and referral services agency serving the greater Los Angeles area, developed a national taxonomy of human services that provides a standard language for information and referral providers nationally. AIRS adopted this taxonomy as its national standard for use in the field of information and referral. This taxonomy provides standard definition of terms, an exact coding structure for referrals and search methodology for providing referrals to consumers. More information about the AIRS/Infoline Taxonomy of Human Services can be found at www.211taxonomy.org. Accredited 2-1-1 centers must have active Memorandums of Understanding with local 9-1-1 service as well as domestic violence providers, elder care providers, mental health providers and local law enforcement to name a few. = Canada = In Canada, professional certification is handled by InformCanada InformCanada - F√©d√©ration Inform Canada. The national 211 initiative is a partnership between InformCanada and United Way of Canada ‚Äì Centraide Canada. Work is underway to create a bilingual, Canadian Taxonomy of human services based on the AIRS/Infoline Taxonomy. This project is led by InformCanada and significant steps have been made on the creation of a starter taxonomy by the 211 Ontario phase 2 project, funded by the Ontario Trillium Foundation and the government of Canada. Updates on the Canadian Taxonomy Project are maintained by 211.ca.  Implementation process  The number 2-1-1 must be captured and approved for assigning through the local telecom companies providing services in the local area. The process of implementing a 2-1-1 service in a community has taken many paths since its beginning in 1997. Some places have a centralized statewide system while others have decentralized regional networks with different types of affiliations. In the United States, each implementation is monitored by the national accrediting entity Alliance of Information & Referral Systems (AIRS) and its local statewide affiliate. In Canada, the deployment of 2-1-1 service is subject to InformCanada accreditation and Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approval.

Personal life Giuliano had been promised in marriage to Semiramade Appiani Aragona, daughter of Iacopo IV Appiani, the Lord of Piombino. Giulio di Giuliano de' Medici, Giuliano's illegitimate son by his mistress Fioretta Gorini, went on to become Pope Clement VII. In other media Giuliano de' Medici is portrayed by Tom Bateman in Starz's original series Da Vinci's Demons. He has an affair with Vanessa, who becomes pregnant with his child. He is murdered in the season 1 finale. Giuliano de' Medici was portrayed by Bradley James in the second season of the TV series Medici: Masters of Florence. Giuliano makes a brief appearance in the video game Assassin's Creed II where he is murdered by Francesco de' Pazzi and other conspirators of the Pazzi conspiracy who were seeking to take over Florence under the command of Rodrigo Borgia, the future Pope Alexander VI. Angelo Poliziano wrote two works which include Giuliano de' Medici as a major character. Stanze cominciate per la giostra del Magnifico Giuliano de‚Äô Medici was written to commemorate a joust that Giuliano won in 1475. It is mostly fictionalized and involves Giuliano's love for Simonetta Vespucci. It was left unfinished, for both of his protagonists (Giuliano and Simonetta) died. The other work is Coniurationis Commentarium, which was written in 1478 to commemorate Giuliano's murder. It explains the people involved in the plot and the events of the day of his assassination.

Biography Giuliano's statue in the Medici Chapel, created by Michelangelo Born in Florence, he was raised with his brothers Piero and Giovanni de' Medici, who became Pope Leo X; as well as his cousin Guilio de' Medici, who became Pope Clement VII. His older brother Piero was briefly the ruler of Florence after Lorenzo's death, until the republican faction drove out the Medici in 1494. Giuliano moved therefore to Venice. The Medici family was restored to power after the Holy League drove the French forces that had supported the Florentine republicans from Italy. This effort was headed by Spain with the support of Pope Julius II. Giuliano reigned in Florence upon the return of the Medici in 1512, until the year he died in 1516. He married Filiberta (1498‚Äì1524), daughter of Philip II, Duke of Savoy, on 22 February 1515 at the court of France, thanks to the intercession of his brother Giovanni, now pope as Leo X, in the same year that King Francis I of France (Filiberta's nephew) invested him with the title Duke of Nemours (which had recently reverted once again to the French crown) on the occasion. The French were apparently grooming him for the throne of Naples (in which the French maintained a historical interest), when Giuliano died prematurely. He was succeeded in Florence by his nephew Lorenzo II de' Medici. Giuliano left a single illegitimate son, Ippolito de' Medici, who became a cardinal. His portrait, painted in Rome by Raphael (a painter favored by Leo), shows Rome's Castel Sant'Angelo behind a curtain. (A studio version is at the Metropolitan Museum.) Giuliano's tomb in the Medici ChapelPeter Barenboim, Sergey Shiyan, Michelangelo: Mysteries of Medici Chapel, SLOVO, Moscow, 2006. of the Church of San Lorenzo, Florence, is ornamented with the Night and Day of Michelangelo, along with a statue of Giuliano by Michelangelo. Due to the identical common name (Giuliano de' Medici) that he shared with his uncle Giuliano di Piero de' Medici, whose tomb is also in the Medici Chapel and who is famous for being assassinated in the Pazzi Conspiracy, his tomb is often mistaken for that of his uncle.

The full Chinese title of the play is Gan Tian Dong Di Dou E Yuan, which roughly translates to The Injustice to Dou E that Touched Heaven and Earth. The story follows a child bride turned widow, Dou E, who is wrongly convicted of crimes by a corrupt court official for actions perpetrated by a rejected suitor, Zhang the mule. After her execution, three prophesied phenomena occur to prove her innocence, including blood raining from the sky, snow in June and a three-year drought. After a visit from the ghost of Dou E, her father eventually brings the corrupt court official, a doctor and Mule Zhang to justice, thereby vindicating his daughter. Today, the phrase \\"snowing in June\\" is still widely used among Chinese speakers as a metaphor for a miscarriage of justice. The story was repeatedly used and modified by later dramatists and remains one of Guan's most popular works. Story =Prologue= Dou Duanyun, a young maiden from Chuzhou (Ê•öÂ∑û; present-day Huai'an District, Huai'an, Jiangsu), is sold to the Cai family as a child bride because her father, Dou Tianzhang, owed people a lot of money and could not repay his debts. She is renamed 'Dou E'. =Act 1= Dou E's husband died two years after their marriage, leaving behind Dou E and her mother-in-law to depend on each other. Dou E and her mother-in-law are bullied by Sai Lu Yi, an unscrupulous physician. Sai Lu Yi almost kills Dou's mother- in-law by strangling her. Dou E and her mother-in-law are saved by the hooligan Zhang L√º'er and his father. Zhang pretends to offer them \\"protection\\" and moves into their house against their will, and then tries to force Dou E to marry him but she refuses. =Act 2= Dou E's mother-in-law has a sudden craving for soup. Zhang L√º'er plots to murder Dou E's mother-in-law so that he can seize Dou E for himself after the older woman dies. He blackmails Sai Lu Yi for poison by threatening to report the physician to the authorities for his earlier attempt to murder Dou E's mother-in-law. He puts the poison in the soup and hopes that Dou E's mother-in-law will drink it and die. However, Zhang's father drinks the soup instead and dies from poisoning. Zhang L√º'er then frames Dou E for murdering his father. Dou E is arrested and brought before the prefecture governor, Tao Wu, who subjects her to various tortures to force her to confess to the crime. Dou E does not want her mother-in-law to be implicated so she admits to the murder. Tao Wu sentences her to death by beheading. =Act 3= Dou E is brought to the execution ground. Before her execution, she swears that her innocence will be proven if the following three events occur after she dies: * Her blood will spill on her clothes but will not drip onto the ground. * There will be heavy snowfall in the sixth lunar month (in the midst of summer) and the thick snow will cover her dead body. * Chuzhou will experience a drought for three years. The three events happened after Dou E's death. =Act 4= Three years later, Dou E's ghost appears before her father, Dou Tianzhang, who has become a lianfangshi (ÂªâË®™‰Ωø; a senior government official) in the Anhui and Jiangsu region, and tells him all her grievances. Dou Tianzhang orders a reinvestigation of the case and the truth finally comes to light. Dou E is posthumously proclaimed innocent while the guilty parties receive their due punishments: Sai Lu Yi is exiled to a distant land; Tao Wu is dismissed and barred from entering office again; Zhang L√º'er is given the death penalty. Dou E also wishes that her father can allow her mother-in-law to live with him, and that he will help to take care of her mother-in-law. Dou E's father agrees. The play ends here. Main characters * Dou E (Á´áÂ®•), the main character, originally named Dou Duanyun (Á´áÁ´ØÈõ≤). * Dou Tianzhang (Á´áÂ§©Á´†), Dou E's father. * Dou E's mother-in-law, referred to as Granny Cai (Ëî°Â©Ü) in the play. * Zhang L√º'er (ÂºµÈ©¢ÂÖí; literally \\"Zhang the mule\\" or \\"Zhang the donkey\\"), the man responsible for Dou E's plight. * Zhang L√º'er's father, referred to as Zhang's father (ÂºµÁà∂) in the play. * Sai Lu Yi (Ë≥ΩÁõßÈÜ´; literally \\"equivalent to the Physician from Lu\\"), the physician who provided the poison that killed Zhang L√º'er's father. \\"Physician from Lu\\" (ÁõßÈÜ´) is the nickname of Bian Que, a famous physician in ancient China. Guan Hanqing was probably adding a touch of satire or irony when he named this character. * Tao Wu (Ê°ÉÊùå), the prefecture governor who sentenced Dou E to death. Problems of text and translation The scholar Stephen H. West notes that the texts of Yuan drama were edited and \\"extensively altered\\" by Zang Maoxun (1550‚Äì1620), whose Yuanqu xuan (ÂÖÉÊõ≤ÈÅ∏) became the standard anthology. Zang rationalised both the language and the format of the plays he edited, rather than the \\"coarser and more rugged ‚Äì sometimes ragged ‚Äì registers of language found in the early commercial editions of Yuan drama.\\" Almost all English translations before those in the anthology by West and Idema were based on Zang's recensions. David Rolston remarks that \\"West and Idema are clearly very interested in the levels of language in the plays they translate (their translations do not shy from highlighting the rawer or racier elements of plays in ways generally ignored or suppressed by other translators).\\" Their translations, he says, will be more useful to those who are interested in the history of the theater and the plays, while the emphasis on readability in translations based on Zang's texts, such as that by George Kao in the Columbia Anthology, will be more appealing to general readers.

Some of his most notable works include Tomie, a series chronicling an immortal girl who drives her stricken admirers to madness, Uzumaki, a three-volume series about a town obsessed with spirals, and Gyo, a two-volume story where fish are controlled by a strain of sentient bacteria called \\"the death stench.\\" His other works are Itou Junji Kyoufu Manga Collection, a collection of different short stories including a series of stories named Souichi's Journal of Delights, and Junji Ito's Cat Diary: Yon & Mu, a self-parody about him and his wife living in a house with two cats. Life and career Junji It≈ç was born on 31 July 1963 in Sakashita, now a part of Nakatsugawa, Gifu. He began his experience in the horror world at a very young age; his two older sisters would read Kazuo Umezu and Shinichi Koga in magazines, and consequently, he began reading them too. He grew up in the countryside, in a small city next to Nagano. In the house where he lived, the bathroom was at the end of an underground tunnel, where there were spider crickets. Such experiences were later reflected in his works. It≈ç first began writing and drawing manga as a hobby while working as a dental technician in around 1984. In 1987, he submitted a short story to that won an honorable mention in the Kazuo Umezu Prize (with Umezu himself as one of the judges). This story was later serialized as Tomie.Urasawa Naoki no Manben: It≈ç Junji (S4E2, 2017), NHK Educational TV Film director Guillermo del Toro cited on his official Twitter account that Ito was originally a collaborator for the video game Silent Hills, of which both Del Toro and game designer Hideo Kojima were the main directors. However, a year after its announcement, the project was canceled by Konami, the IP's owner. It≈ç and Del Toro would later lend their likenesses to Kojima's next project, Death Stranding. In 2019, Ito received an Eisner Award for his manga adaptation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. =Personal life= In 2006, Junji married Ishiguro Ayako (Áü≥Èªí‰∫úÁü¢Â≠ê), a picture book artist. As of 2013, they have two children. Inspiration and themes In addition to Kazuo Umezu, It≈ç has cited Hideshi Hino, Shinichi Koga, Yasutaka Tsutsui, and H. P. Lovecraft as being major influences on his work. The universe It≈ç depicts is cruel and capricious; his characters often find themselves victims of malevolent unnatural circumstances for no discernible reason or punished out of proportion for minor infractions against an unknown and incomprehensible natural order. Some of the recurring themes of It≈ç's work include jealousy, envy, body horror, seemingly ordinary characters who begin to act out of irrational compulsion, the breakdown of society, deep-sea organisms, and the inevitability of one's demise, all displayed through a realistic and simple design, which emphasizes the contrast between beauty and death. The events narrated are unpredictable and violent, and arise from normal situations. Tomie was inspired by the death of one of his classmates, he felt strange that a boy he knew suddenly disappeared from the world and expected him to show up again, and that‚Äôs how he came up with the idea of a girl who is supposed to have died but then just shows up as if nothing had happened. Gyo was influenced by his anti-war feelings, developed when he was a child, due to his parents' tragic and frightening war stories. ‚ÄúThe Hanging Balloons‚Äù was also based on a childhood dream.

Life John Barth, called \\"Jack\\", was born in Cambridge, Maryland. He has an older brother, Bill, and a twin sister Jill. In 1947 he graduated from Cambridge High School, where he played drums and wrote for the school newspaper. He briefly studied \\"Elementary Theory and Advanced Orchestration\\" at JuilliardTownsend, Victoria. Pennsylvania Center for the Book. Spring 2005 before attending Johns Hopkins University, where he received a B.A. in 1951 and an M.A. in 1952. His thesis novel, The Shirt of Nessus, drew on his experiences at Johns Hopkins. Barth married Harriet Anne Strickland on January 11, 1950. He published two short stories that same year, one in Johns Hopkins's student literary magazine and one in The Hopkins Review. His daughter, Christine Ann, was born in the summer of 1951. His son, John Strickland, was born the following year. From 1953 to 1965, Barth was a professor at Pennsylvania State University, where he met his second and current wife, Shelly Rosenberg.\\"John Barth\\" FAQ, http://www.davidlouisedelman.com/barth/faqs His third child, Daniel Stephen, was born in 1954. During the \\"American high Sixties\\", he moved to teach at the State University of New York at Buffalo from 1965 to 1973. In that period he came to know \\"the remarkable short fiction\\" of the Argentine Jorge Luis Borges, which inspired his collection Lost in the Funhouse.Barth (1984) intro to The Literature of Exhaustion, in The Friday Book. Barth later taught at Boston University as a visiting professor in 1972‚Äì73 and at Johns Hopkins University from 1973 until he retired in 1995. Literary work Barth began his career with The Floating Opera and The End of the Road, two short realist novels that deal wittily with controversial topics, suicide and abortion respectively. They are straightforward realistic tales; as Barth later remarked, they \\"didn't know they were novels\\". The Sot-Weed Factor (1960) was initially intended as the completing novel of a trilogy comprising his first two \\"realist\\" novels, but, as a consequence of Barth's maturation as a writer, it developed into a different project.John Barth (1987) Foreword to Doubleday Anchor Edition of The Sot-Weed Factor The novel is significant as it marked Barth's discovery of postmodernism. Barth's next novel, Giles Goat-Boy (about 800 pages), is a speculative fiction based on the conceit of the university as universe. Giles, a boy raised as a goat, discovers his humanity and becomes a savior in a story presented as a computer tape given to Barth, who denied that it was his work. In the course of the novel Giles carries out all the tasks prescribed by Joseph Campbell in The Hero with a Thousand Faces. Barth kept a list of the tasks taped to his wall while he was writing the book. The short story collection Lost in the Funhouse (1968) and the novella collection Chimera (1972) are even more metafictional than their two predecessors, foregrounding the writing process and presenting achievements such as a seven- deep nested quotation. Chimera shared the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction. In the novel LETTERS (1979), Barth interacts with characters from his first six books. His 1994 Once Upon a Time: A Floating Opera, reuses stock characters, stock situations and formulas.Clavier, Berndt (2007) John Barth and Postmodernism: Spatiality, Travel, Montage pp. 165‚Äì167 Styles, approaches and artistic criteria Barth's work is characterized by a historical awareness of literary traditionConversations with Kurt Vonnegut and by the practice of rewriting typical of postmodernism. He said, \\"I don't know what my view of history is, but insofar as it involves some allowance for repetition and recurrence, reorchestration, and reprise [...] I would always want it to be more in the form of a thing circling out and out and becoming more inclusive each time.\\"Elias, Amy J.

In Barth's postmodern sensibility, parody is a central device.Hutcheon Linda. Narcissistic Narrative: The Metafictional Paradox. pp. 50-51. Around 1972, in an interview, Barth declared that \\"The process [of making a novel] is the content, more or less.\\"Samet, Tom. \\"The Modulated Vision: Lionel Trilling's 'Larger Naturalism'\\". Critical Inquiry, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Spring 1978), pp. 539‚Äì557. Quotation: novel is the process of its own making. \\"The process is the content, more or less,\\" John Barth has recently declared,38 thus turning [Mark] Schorer's position on its head.Prescott, Peter S.; Prescott, Anne Lake. Encounters with American Culture, Volume 2, p. 137. Google Books. Barth's fiction continues to maintain a precarious balance between postmodern self- consciousness and wordplay and the sympathetic characterization and \\"page- turning\\" plotting commonly associated with more traditional genres and subgenres of classic and contemporary storytelling. Essays While writing these books, Barth was also pondering and discussing the theoretical problems of fiction writing. In 1967, he wrote a highly influential Contemporary Literature 2000 and, to some, controversial essay considered a manifesto of postmodernism, The Literature of Exhaustion (first printed in The Atlantic, 1967). It depicts literary realism as a \\"used-up\\" tradition; Barth's description of his own work, which many thought illustrated a core trait of postmodernism, is \\"novels which imitate the form of a novel, by an author who imitates the role of author\\".p.72 The essay was widely considered a statement of \\"the death of the novel\\", (compare with Roland Barthes' \\"The Death of the Author\\"). Barth has since insisted that he was merely making clear that a particular stage in history was passing, and pointing to possible directions from there. He later (1980) wrote a follow-up essay, \\"The Literature of Replenishment\\", to clarify the point.

The service delivers software updates for Windows, as well as the various Microsoft antivirus products, including Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials. Since its inception, Microsoft has introduced two extensions of the service: Microsoft Update and Windows Update for Business. The former expands the core service to include other Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Office and Microsoft Expression Studio. The latter is available to business editions of Windows 10 and permits postponing updates or receiving updates only after they have undergone rigorous testing. As the service has evolved over the years, so have its client software. For a decade, the primary client component of the service was the Windows Update web app that could only be run inside Internet Explorer. Starting with Windows Vista, the primary client component became Windows Update Agent, an integral component of the operating system. The service provides several kinds of updates. Security updates or critical updates mitigate vulnerabilities against security exploits against Microsoft Windows. Cumulative updates are updates that bundle multiple updates, both new and previously released updates. Cumulative updates were introduced with Windows 10 and have been backported to Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. Microsoft routinely releases updates on the second Tuesday of each month (known as the Patch Tuesday), but can provide them whenever a new update is urgently required to prevent a newly discovered or prevalent exploit. System administrators can configure Windows Update to install critical updates for Microsoft Windows automatically, so long as the computer has an Internet connection. Clients =Windows Update web app= The Windows Update web app, version 4, in Windows ME Windows Update was introduced as a web app with the launch of Windows 98 and offered additional desktop themes, games, device driver updates, and optional components such as NetMeeting. Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 were retroactively given the ability to access the Windows Update website and download updates designed for those operating systems, starting with the release of Internet Explorer 4. The initial focus of Windows Update was free add-ons and new technologies for Windows. Security fixes for Outlook Express, Internet Explorer and other programs appeared later, as did access to beta versions of upcoming Microsoft software, e.g. Internet Explorer 5. Fixes to Windows 98 to resolve the Year 2000 problem were distributed using Windows Update in December 1998. Microsoft attributed the sales success of Windows 98 in part to Windows Update. The Windows Update web app requires either Internet Explorer or a third-party web browser that supports the ActiveX technology. The first version of the web app, version 3, does not send any personally-identifiable information to Microsoft. Instead, the app downloads a full list of every available update and chooses which one to download and install. But the list grew so large that the performance impact of processing became a concern. Arie Slob, writing for the Windows-help.net newsletter in March 2003, noted that the size of the update list had exceeded , which caused delays of more than a minute for dial-up users. Windows Update v4, released in 2001 in conjunction with Windows XP, changed this. This version of the app makes an inventory of the system's hardware and Microsoft software and sends them to the service, thus offloading the processing burden to Microsoft servers. =Critical Update Notification Utility= Screenshot of the Critical Update Notification alt= Critical Update Notification Utility (initially Critical Update Notification Tool) is a background process that checks the Windows Update web site on a regular schedule for new updates that have been marked as \\"Critical\\". It was released shortly after Windows 98. By default, this check occurs every five minutes, plus when Internet Explorer starts; however, the user could configure the next check to occur only at certain times of the day or on certain days of the week. The tool queries the Microsoft server for a file called \\"\`cucif.cab\`\\", which contained a list of all the critical updates released for the operating system. The tool then compares this list with the list of installed updates on its machine and displays an update availability notification. Once the check is executed, any custom schedule defined by the user is reverted to the default. Microsoft stated that this ensures that users received notification of critical updates in a timely manner. An analysis done by security researcher H. D. Moore in early 1999 was critical of this approach, describing it as \\"horribly inefficient\\" and susceptible to attacks. In a posting to BugTraq, he explained that, \\"every single Windows 98 computer that wishes to get an update has to rely on a single host for the security. If that one server got compromised one day, or an attacker cracks the [Microsoft] DNS server again, there could be millions of users installing trojans every hour. The scope of this attack is big enough to attract crackers who actually know what they are doing...\\" Microsoft continued to promote the tool through 1999 and the first half of 2000. Initial releases of Windows 2000 shipped with the tool. The tool did not support Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0. =Automatic Updates= Automatic Updates \\"Restart Required\\" alt= Automatic Updates is the successor of the Critical Update Notification Utility. It was released in 2000, along with Windows Me. It supports Windows 2000 SP3 as well. Unlike its predecessor, Automatic Updates can download and install updates. Instead of the five-minute schedule used by its predecessor, Automatic Updates checks the Windows Update servers once a day. After Windows Me is installed, a notification balloon prompts the user to configure the Automatic Updates client. The user can choose from three notification schemes: Being notified before downloading the update, being notified before installing the update, or both. If new updates are ready to be installed, the user may install them before turning off the computer. A shield icon will be displayed on the Shutdown button during this time. Windows XP and Windows 2000 SP3 include Background Intelligent Transfer Service, a Windows service for transferring files in the background without user interaction. As a system component, it is capable of monitoring the user's Internet usage, and throttling its own bandwidth usage in order to prioritize user-initiated activities. The Automatic Updates client for these operating systems was updated to use this system service. Automatic Updates in Windows XP gained notoriety for repeatedly interrupting the user while working on their computer. Every time an update requiring a reboot was installed, Automatic Updates would prompt the user with a dialog box that allowed the user to restart immediately or dismiss the dialog box, which would reappear in ten minutes; a behavior that Jeff Atwood described as \\"perhaps the naggiest dialog box ever.\\" In 2013, it was observed that shortly after the startup process, Automatic Updates (\`wuauclt.exe\`) and Service Host (\`svchost.exe)\` in Windows XP would claim 100% of a computer's CPU capacity for extended periods of time (between ten minutes to two hours), making affected computers unusable. According to Woody Leonhart of InfoWorld, early reports of this issue could be seen in Microsoft TechNet forums in late May 2013, although Microsoft first received large number of complaints about this issue in September 2013. The cause was an exponential algorithm in the evaluation of superseded updates which had grown large over the decade following the release of Windows XP. Microsoft's attempts to fix the issue in October, November and December proved futile, causing the issue to be escalated to the top priority. =Windows Update Agent= Revised restart alt= Starting with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, Windows Update Agent replaces both the Windows Update web app and the Automatic Updates client. It is in charge of downloading and installing software update from Windows Update, as well as the on-premises servers of Windows Server Updates Services or System Center Configuration Manager. Windows Update Agent can be managed through a Control Panel applet, as well as Group Policy, Microsoft Intune and Windows PowerShell. It can also be set to automatically download and install both important and recommended updates. In prior versions of Windows, such updates were only available through the Windows Update web site. Additionally, Windows Update in Windows Vista supports downloading Windows Ultimate Extras, optional software for Windows Vista Ultimate Edition. Unlike Automatic Updates in Windows XP, Windows Update Agent in Windows Vista and Windows 7 allows the user to postpone the mandatory restart (required for the update process to complete) for up to four hours. The revised dialog box that prompts for the restart appears under other windows, instead of on top of them. However, standard user accounts only have 15 minutes to respond to this dialog box. This was changed with Windows 8: Users have 3 days (72 hours) before the computer reboots automatically after installing automatic updates that require a reboot. Windows 8 also consolidates the restart requests for non-critical updates into just one per month. Additionally, the login screen notifies them of the restart requirements. Windows Update Agent makes use of the Transactional NTFS feature introduced with Windows Vista to apply updates to Windows system files. This feature helps Windows recover cleanly in the event of an unexpected failure, as file changes are committed atomically. Windows 10 contains major changes to Windows Update Agent operations; it no longer allows the manual, selective installation of updates. All updates, regardless of type (this includes hardware drivers), are downloaded and installed automatically, and users are only given the option to choose whether their system would reboot automatically to install updates when the system is inactive, or be notified to schedule a reboot. Microsoft offers a diagnostic tool that can be used to hide troublesome device drivers and prevent them from being reinstalled, but only after they had been already installed, then uninstalled without rebooting the system. Windows Update Agent on Windows 10 supports peer to peer distribution of updates; by default, systems' bandwidth is used to distribute previously downloaded updates to other users, in combination with Microsoft servers. Users may optionally change Windows Update to only perform peer to peer updates within their local area network. Windows 10 also introduced cumulative updates. For example, if Microsoft released updates KB00001 in July, KB00002 in August, and KB00003 in September, Microsoft would release cumulative update KB00004 which packs KB00001, KB00002, and KB00003 together. Installing KB00004 will also install KB00001, KB00002 and KB00003, mitigating the need for multiple restarts and reducing the number of downloads needed. KB00004 may also include other fixes with their own KB-number that were not separately released. A disadvantage of cumulative updates is that downloading and installing updates that fix individual problems is no longer possible. =Windows Update for Business= Windows Update for Business is a term for a set of features in the Pro, Enterprise and Education editions of Windows 10, including: * The ability to change the Windows 10 release branch from the default \\"Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted)\\" (formerly \\"Current Branch\\" or \\"CB\\") to \\"Semi-Annual Channel\\" (formerly \\"Current Branch for Business\\" or \\"CBB\\"), or vice versa. The former offers feature updates as soon as they are released. The latter offers feature updates with a four-month delay, so that they may receive further testing. * The ability to delay quality updates for up to 30 days. * The ability to delay feature updates for up to 365 days. These features were added in Windows 10 version 1511. They are intended for large organizations with many computers, so they can logically group their computers for gradual deployment. Microsoft recommends a small set of pilot computers to receive the updates almost immediately, while the set of most critical computers to receive them after every other group has done so, and has experienced their effects. Other Microsoft update management solutions, such as Windows Server Update Services or System Center Configuration Manager, do not override Windows Update for Business. Rather, they force Windows 10 into the \\"dual scan mode\\". This can cause confusion for administrators who do not comprehend the full ramifications of the dual scan mode. =Decommissioning= On August 3 2020 the update service was decommissioned for Windows 2000, XP, Server 2003 and Vista due to Microsoft discontinuing SHA-1 updates. Windows Update SHA-1 based endpoints discontinued for older Windows devices Complementary software and services As organizations continued to use more computers, the per-machine Windows Update clients started to become unwieldy and insufficient. In response to the need of organizations for deploying updates to many machines, Microsoft introduced what was ultimately called Windows Server Update Services (WSUS). WSUS downloads updates for Microsoft product to a server computer on which it is running and redistributes them to the computers within the organization over a local area network (LAN). One of the benefits of this method is a reduction in the consumption of Internet bandwidth, equal to (N-1)√óS, where N is the number of computers in the organization and S is the size made by the updates. Additionally, WSUS permits administrators to test updates on a small group of test computers before deploying them to all systems, in order to ensure that business continuity is not disrupted because of the changes of the updates. For very large organizations, multiple WSUS servers can be chained together hierarchically. Only one server in this hierarchy downloads from the Internet. WSUS is a component of the Windows Server family of operating systems. Update packages distributed via the Windows Update service can be individually downloaded from Microsoft Update Catalog. These updates can be delivered to computers without any network connections (e.g. using a USB flash drive) or used deploy Microsoft products in pre-updated state. In case of the former, Windows Update Agent (\`wusa.exe\`) can install these files. In case of the latter, Microsoft deployment utilities such as DISM, WADK and MDT can consume these packages. Microsoft offers System Center Configuration Manager for very complex deployment and servicing scenarios. The product integrates with all of the aforesaid tools (WSUS, DISM, WADK, MDT) to automate the process. Service At the beginning of 2005, Windows Update was being accessed by about 150 million people, with about 112 million of those using Automatic Updates. As of 2008, Windows Update had about 500 million clients, processed about 350 million unique scans per day, and maintained an average of 1.5 million simultaneous connections to client machines. On Patch Tuesday, the day Microsoft typically releases new software updates, outbound traffic could exceed 500 gigabits per second. Approximately 90% of all clients used automatic updates to initiate software updates, with the remaining 10% using the Windows Update web site. The web site is built using ASP.NET, and processes an average of 90,000 page requests per second. Traditionally, the service provided each patch in its own proprietary archive file. Occasionally, Microsoft released service packs which bundled all updates released over the course of years for a certain product. Starting with Windows 10, however, all patches are delivered in cumulative packages. On 15 August 2016, Microsoft announced that effective October 2016, all future patches to Windows 7 and 8.1 would become cumulative as with Windows 10. The ability to download and install individual updates would be removed as existing updates are transitioned to this model. This has resulted in increasing download sizes of each monthly update. An analysis done by Computerworld determined that the download size for Windows 7 x64 has increased from 119.4MB in October 2016 to 203MB in October 2017. Initially, Microsoft was very vague about specific changes within each cumulative update package. However, since early 2016, Microsoft has begun releasing more detailed information on the specific changes. =Microsoft Update= The Windows Update web in Internet Explorer 6 on Windows XP, connected to the Microsoft Update service At the February 2005 RSA Conference, Microsoft announced the first beta of Microsoft Update, an optional replacement for Windows Update that provides security patches, service packs and other updates for both Windows and other Microsoft software. The initial release in June 2005 provided support for Microsoft Office 2003, Exchange 2003, and SQL Server 2000, running on Windows 2000, XP, and Server 2003. Over time, the list has expanded to include other Microsoft products, such as Windows Live, Windows Defender, Visual Studio, runtimes and redistributables, Zune Software, Virtual PC and Virtual Server, CAPICOM, Microsoft Lync, Microsoft Expression Studio, and other server products. It also offers Silverlight and Windows Media Player as optional downloads if applicable to the operating system. =Office Update= Office Update is a free online service that allows users to detect and install updates for certain Microsoft Office products. The original update service supported Office 2000, Office XP, Office 2003 and Office 2007. On 1 August 2009 Microsoft decommissioned the Office Update service, merging it with Microsoft Update. Microsoft Update does not support Office 2000. With the introduction of the Office 365 licensing program, however, Microsoft once again activated a separate Office update service to service Office 365 customers. Owners of perpetual Microsoft Office licenses continue to receive updates through Microsoft Update. Alternative tools A number of tools have been created by independent software vendors which provide the ability for Windows Updates to be automatically downloaded for, or added to, an online or offline system. One common use for offline updates is to ensure a system is fully patched against security vulnerabilities before being connected to the Internet or another network. A second use is that downloads can be very large, but may be dependent on a slow or unreliable network connection, or the same updates may be needed for more than one machine. AutoPatcher, WSUS Offline Update, PortableUpdate, and Windows Updates Downloader are examples such tools.

It stretched from Halland across Sk√•ne to Blekinge and consisted of two defensive lines: *First defensive line: concrete bunkers along the shore, armed with machine guns and light cannons. *Second defensive line: armed troops 300 meters inland behind barbed wire, some in concrete bunkers. In the Helsingborg area the line was reinforced with a second line of rear-facing machine gun bunkers. As a further improvement there was also added a line of shelters to protect personnel from aerial bombing and artillery bombardment. There were two types of shelter designs (called SK24 and SK48), designed to provide protection for either 24 or 48 soldiers. This line stretches from Ystad to the north of Helsingborg, and consists of about 70 shelters. At the end of the war in 1945 the defensive line consisted of 1,063 fortifications (shelters not included). The distances between each was 300‚Äì400 meters and most of them were located in direct proximity to the sea, built according to a number of standardised designs. During the Cold War the line was strengthened further, adding turrets armed with 75mm tank guns, either as additions to already existing fortifications or in newly constructed ones. The decommissioning of the defenses began in the late 1990s. Each landowner had to decide what would happen with the military fortifications on their property. Many bunkers were sealed, a small number were razed. The liquidation is still (2008) not fully implemented and several stretches along the south coast remain. The \\"liquidation\\" referred to here is not the physical removal of the reinforced concrete found everywhere along the coast of Scania, but the emptying of the bunkers and shelters of all military equipment. For instance, only a few of the bunkers have been demolished, to make way for housing. Today the forts are used primarily as artificial rocks for sunbathers in the summer. In 2008 it was decided that 18 of the fortifications in the Helsingborg area would be preserved as historical landmarks. These bunkers are now managed by the Military Preparedness Museum (Beredskapsmuseet) and are undergoing extensive renovation. Starting in 2009, the bunkers were opened to the public. The refurbished bunkers were officially inaugurated on May 30, 2009 with battle demonstrations, the firing of salutes, fanfares and color guard processions.

Out of its hubs at Ninoy Aquino International Airport of Manila, Clark International Airport of Angeles, Mactan-Cebu International Airport of Cebu, and Francisco Bangoy International Airport of Davao, Philippine Airlines serves 31 destinations in the Philippines and 54 overseas destinations in Southeast Asia, East Asia, Middle East, Oceania, North America and Europe.Philippine Airlines International Winter Timetable , Philippine Airlines. Retrieved November 2013. Philippine Airlines operates a mixed fleet of Airbus and Boeing aircraft with Airbus A320, Airbus A321, Airbus A321neo, Airbus A330, Airbus A350, and Boeing 777-300ER.  History  Formerly one of the largest Asian airlines, PAL was severely affected by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In one of the Philippines' biggest corporate failures, PAL was forced to downsize its international operations by completely cutting flights to Europe and Middle East, cutting virtually all domestic flights except routes operated from Manila, reducing the size of its fleet, and laying off thousands of employees. The airline was placed under receivership in 1998, and gradually restored operations to many destinations. After PAL's exit from receivership in 2007, PAL embarked on a frequent revamp of management. However, PAL's vision to re- establish itself as one of Asia's premier carriers is still the matter of greatest importance.  Corporate management  The Philippine Airlines logo shown on the PNB Financial Headquarters from Roxas Boulevard The entrance to the Philippine Airlines head office at the PNB Financial Headquarters along Macapagal Boulevard in Pasay Philippine Airlines is owned by PAL Holdings (), a holding company responsible for the airline's operations. PAL Holdings is in turn part of a group of companies owned by business tycoon Lucio Tan. ANA Holdings, the holding company of All Nippon Airways, has a 9.5% stake in PAL Holdings. PAL is the ninth-largest corporation in the Philippines in terms of gross revenue, as stated in the Philippines' Top 1000 Largest Corporations of 2017. As of December 2018, PAL employs a total of 6,689 employees, which includes 999 pilots and 2,647 cabin crew. PAL is the sixty-first largest airline in the world in terms of revenue passenger kilometers flown, with over 16 million flown for 21 million available seat kilometers, an average load factor of 76 percent.PAL makes it to World Airline Rankings , Philippine Daily Inquirer, September 6, 2007 PAL has flown approx. 12 million passengers in 2014 and 16 million in 2016. For the fiscal year ending on March 31, 2007, Philippine Airlines reported a net income of US$140.3 million, the largest profit in its 76-year history. This allowed it to exit receivership in October. PAL had forecast net profit to reach $32.32 million for the fiscal year ending on March 31, 2008, $26.28 million in 2009 and $47.41 million in 2010, but this proved difficult to achieve, with a large loss announced in early 2009 causing some concern. However, Philippine Airlines reported a total comprehensive income of $20.4 million for 2014, the company's first profit in four years. The company continued its financial turnaround, reporting a net income growth of 4430.04% for the year 2015. However, PAL reported a loss in 2016, with a net income growth of -38.80%. On November 15, 2018, the airline was named the \\"Most Improved Airline of 2019\\" award from airlineratings.com, a product rating website.  Destinations  Philippine Airlines operates a primary hub (Ninoy Aquino International Airport), three secondary hubs (Mactan-Cebu International Airport, Clark International Airport & Francisco Bangoy International Airport), as well as a focus city (Kalibo International Airport), with the majority of routes operating from Ninoy Aquino International Airport. The airline flies to destinations in Asia, North America, Oceania, Middle East, and the United Kingdom. = Codeshare agreements = Philippine Airlines codeshares with the following airlines: * Air Macau * All Nippon Airways (Star Alliance) * Bangkok Airways * Cathay Pacific (Oneworld) * China Airlines (SkyTeam) * Garuda Indonesia (SkyTeam) * Hawaiian Airlines * Malaysia Airlines (Oneworld) * PAL Express (Affiliate) * Royal Brunei Airlines * Turkish Airlines (Star Alliance) * Vietnam Airlines (SkyTeam) * WestJet * XiamenAir (SkyTeam)  Fleet  The Philippine Airlines fleet composed of wide-body and narrow-body aircraft from five families (excluding PAL Express fleet): Airbus A320, Airbus A321neo, Airbus A330, its flagship Airbus A350, and Boeing 777. There were 72 aircraft registered in the PAL fleet.  Branding  = Logo = The Philippine Airlines logo has gone under four incarnations in the entire length of its operations. The first logo incorporated a blue oval with \\"PAL\\" superimposed in white letters, a four- pointed star whose points intersect behind the \\"A\\" in the PAL initials, and a wing whose position varied depending on the location of the logo (the wing points to the right if located on the left side of the plane, left if on the right side). A variant of this logo used a globe instead of the blue oval with the PAL initials superimposed. This logo would be in use from the 1950s until the mid-1960s when it would be replaced by a second logo. The second logo adopted a blue triangle (with the bottom point missing) and a red triangle superimposed upon it, enclosed by a circle; this was meant to evoke a vertically-displayed national flag (the white being formed by the negative space between the two triangles' tips). In the mid-1970s, a third logo, which removed the circle and simplified the shapes, was introduced. The typeface used in the third logo was later applied to the second logo, which remained the official PAL logo until 1986 when it would be replaced by the current logo. The current PAL logo features the same two blue and red sailed triangles used in the second and third logos. However, an eight-rayed yellow sunburst that is shaped like a Sailboat was superimposed on top of the blue triangle, and a new Helvetica typeface was used. PAL50.png1950-1960 PAL60.png1960-1970 PAL-70.png1970-1986 = Livery = RP-C8785, an Airbus A330-343 operated by Philippine Airlines arrives in Francisco Bangoy International Airport from Ninoy Aquino International Airport as PR1812. PAL liveries have undergone many incarnations. The first PAL aircraft bore a simple white-top, silver-bottom livery separated by solid straight cheatlines, with a small Philippine flag superimposed on the tail. The name \\"Philippine Air Lines\\" was superimposed in the upper forward portion of the fuselage and the PAL logo was located at the back. Later variants of the livery, especially on PAL jet aircraft, made use of an extended Philippine flag as cheatlines, with the PAL logo superimposed on the tail. By this time, the name \\"Philippine Airlines\\" was used in the livery. Another variant of the original livery used by PAL is somewhat similar to the current livery. However, it uses PAL's third logo on the tail with blue, white, and red cheatlines running the center of the fuselage. Later on, the bottom half of the fuselage was also painted white. The current \\"Eurowhite\\" livery, first used with the Short 360, was adopted in 1986 following PAL's corporate rebranding. This livery, (designed by Landor Associates) has the name \\"Philippines\\" superimposed on the forward portion of the fuselage in italics (using the PAL logo typeface), while the tail is painted with the logo and the Philippine flag is visible near the rear of the aircraft. The PAL logo is also painted on the winglets of aircraft that have them. The name \\"Philippines\\", instead of \\"Philippine Airlines\\", is to denote that PAL is the primary flag carrier of the Philippines. However, this sometimes leads to confusion that a PAL plane, especially when chartered by the President for official or state visits, is, in fact, the official air transport of the Philippine head of state. Any PAL aircraft with the flight number \\"PR/PAL 001\\" and the callsign \\"PHILIPPINE ONE\\" is a special plane operated by Philippine Airlines to transport the President of the Philippines. For the airline's 70th anniversary, a special decal was placed on all of its aircraft. The sticker featured a stylized \\"70\\" and the words, \\"Asia's first, shining through\\". As the airline celebrates its 75th anniversary, a special decal was put at the back of every aircraft. The sticker features a stylized \\"75\\". PAL also placed a 4-star Skytrax sticker on its aircraft to celebrate their new rating. In February 2019, Philippine Airlines rolled out its fifth Airbus A350 aircraft with a \\"LoveBus\\" decal that represents the 40th anniversary of partnership with Airbus and to celebrate the airline's signature heartfelt service. The kiss marked \\"LoveBus\\" logo was also placed in 1979 on one of PAL's Airbus A300 that represents the first year of partnership with Airbus. Their \\"LoveBus\\" A350 rolled out from paint shop and was accepted on February 14, 2019, which was Valentines Day that time, PAL took delivered it 3 days later and was welcomed at Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 2.  Frequent flyer program  Mabuhay Miles logo Mabuhay Miles is the Philippine Airlines frequent flyer program. It was established in 2002 by merging all existing PAL frequent flyer programs prior to the Asian financial crisis: namely, PALsmiles, the Mabuhay Club and the Flying Sportsman, with PALsmiles and Mabuhay Club members being moved to the new program on August 1, 2002.Mabuhay Miles FAQ, Philippine Airlines. Retrieved April 20, 2008. The Flying Sportsman program was subsequently transformed into SportsPlus, a three-tiered, subscription-based program which gives extra baggage allocations for sports equipment. Mabuhay Miles members earn miles that can be redeemed at face value on most Philippine Airlines-operated flights, as well as on code- shared routes of partner airlines.

Incidents and accidents  Although Philippine Airlines aircraft have been involved in a string of accidents since its founding in 1941, the majority of airline accidents have occurred with propeller aircraft during the early years of operations. Few PAL jet aircraft have been involved in accidents, the most notable being the explosion onboard Philippine Airlines Flight 434, masterminded by al-Qaeda, through Project Bojinka. = Safety = PAL is known for being the only airline in the Philippines to be accredited by the International Air Transport Association with passing the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA), having been accredited in February 2007.PAL now IOSA- Certified, Philippine Airlines Press Release, February 8, 2007 Philippine Airlines has the highest safety rating of 7/7 according to AirlineRatings.com, and was rated a safer airline than some of its Southeast Asian counterparts such as Malaysia Airlines (5/7),Malaysia Airlines Review & Safety Ratings.

Issues =Financial issues= PAL experienced huge financial losses in the late 2000s. On March 31, 2006, PAL's consolidated total assets amounted to 100,984,477 PHP, an 11% decrease from March 31, 2005. On March 31, 2007, the company's consolidated assets continued to diminish by 8%, an amount equivalent to 92,837,849 PHP, as against to 2006 figures. The declination of PAL's assets was primarily due to a net decrease in property and equipment and advance payments to aircraft and engine manufacturers, current and other noncurrent assets. As of March 31, 2007, other current and noncurrent assets fell by 29% to 2,960.4 million PHP and by 20% to 2,941.7 million PHP \\"due to the effect of re-measurement to the fair value of certain financial assets and derivative instruments\\". After carrying 17% more passengers in 2009 due to acquisition of additional aircraft and growth in the local market, PAL annual income report showed an increase in revenues of US$1.634 billion from US$1.504 billion in 2008. In spite of this, PAL expenses escalated as a result of more flight operations and higher maintenance costs aggravated by fuel prices fluctuations; forty-four percent (44%) of PAL income operating expenditures is utilized for fuel consumption.Philippine Airlines Income Forces Cost Cuts to Survive Global Recession. Cebu-philippines.net. Retrieved on October 20, 2016. =Labor issues= PAL has a history of labor relations problems. On June 15, 1998, PAL retrenched 5,000 of its employees, including more than 1,400 flight attendants and stewards to allegedly reduce costs and alleviate the financial downturn in the airline industry as a consequence of the Asian financial crisis. Represented by Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines (FASAP), the retrenched employees particularly the 1,400 cabin crews seek remedy for their problem through the judicial process and filed a complaint on the grounds of unfair labor practice and illegal retrenchment. It took a decade before it was finally settled. It passed the Labor Arbiter to the National Labor Relations Commission, then on to the Court of Appeals and, finally, to the Supreme Court. The Philippine Highest Tribunal favored the aggrieved party and on July 22, 2008, in its 32-page decision ordered PAL to \\"reinstate the cabin crew personnel who were covered by the retrenchment of and demotion scheme of June 15, 1998, made effective on July 15, 1998, without loss of seniority right and other privileges, and to pay them full back wages, inclusive of allowances and other monetary benefits computed from the time of their separation up to the time of actual reinstatement, provided that with respect to those who have received their respective separation pay, the amount of payments shall be deducted from their back wages.\\" The Supreme Court further explained that there was a failure on the part of PAL to substantiate its claims of actual and imminent substantial losses. Although the Asian financial fiasco severely affected the airline, PAL defense of bankruptcy and rehabilitation are untenable; hence, the retrenchment policy is not justified.Fonbuena, C. (2009) Retrenching workers? Don‚Äôt repeat PAL‚Äôs mistake. news.abs-cbn.com However, on March 26, 2018, the Supreme Court en banc voted in favor of Philippine Airlines, which affirms the 2006 Court of Appeals decision that says Philippine Airlines is not required to consult FASAP for its criteria for its retrenchment program. =Competition= For more than 20 years, PAL monopolized the air transport industry in the Philippines. This came to an end in 1995 through the passage of Executive Order No. 219 that permits entry of new airlines in the industry. The liberalization and deregulation of Philippine airline industry have brought competition in the domestic air transport industry resulting in lower airfare, improvement in the quality of service, and efficiency in the industry in general. At present, three airlines are competing in international and major domestic routes: PAL, Cebu Pacific and PAL Express (formerly known as Air Philippines) and two airlines are serving minor and short-distance routes: Philippines AirAsia, Cebgo (formerly SEAIR and Tiger Airways) and other small airlines.Manuela Jr., W.

The cemetery became famous when it was featured in the 1994 novel Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil by John Berendt, and in the subsequent movie, directed by Clint Eastwood, based on the book. It is the largest of the city's municipal cemeteries, containing nearly . The entrance to the cemetery is located at 330 Bonaventure Road. Immediately inside the gates is the large and ornate \\"Gaston's Tomb\\". History The cemetery is located on the former site of Bonaventure Plantation, originally owned by Colonel John Mullryne. On March 10, 1846, Commodore Josiah Tattnall III, sold the plantation and its private cemetery to Peter Wiltberger. Major William H. Wiltberger, the son of Peter, formed the Evergreen Cemetery Company on June 12, 1868. On July 7, 1907 the City of Savannah purchased the Evergreen Cemetery Company, making the cemetery public and changing the name to Bonaventure Cemetery. In 1867 John Muir began his Thousand Mile WalkA Thousand Mile Walk to the Gulf to Florida and the Gulf. In October he sojourned for six days and nights in the Bonaventure cemetery, sleeping upon graves overnight, this being the safest and cheapest accommodation that he could find while he waited for money to be expressed from home. He found the cemetery even then breathtakingly beautiful and inspiring and wrote a lengthy chapter upon it, \\"Camping in the Tombs.\\" > \\"Part of the grounds was cultivated and planted with live-oak (Quercus > virginiana), about a hundred years ago, by a wealthy gentleman who had his > country residence here But much the greater part is undisturbed.

Department of Cemeteries The main office of the City of Savannah's Department of Cemeteries is located on the Bonaventure Cemetery grounds in the Bonaventure Administrative Building at the entrance. Bonaventure Historical Society The cemetery became the subject of a non- profit group, the Bonaventure Historical Society, in May 1997. The group has compiled an index of the burials at the cemetery. Bird Girl The cover photograph for the best-selling book Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, taken by Jack Leigh, featured an evocative sculpture of a young girl, the so- called Bird Girl, that had been in the cemetery, essentially unnoticed, for over 50 years. After the publication of the book, the sculpture was relocated from the cemetery in 1997 for display in Telfair Museums in Savannah. In late 2014, the statue was moved to a dedicated space in the Telfair Museums' Jepson Center for the Arts on West York Street, in Savannah. Notable burials *Samuel B.

The book, Berendt's first, was published in 1994 and follows the story of an antiques dealer on trial for the murder of a male prostitute. Subtitled A Savannah Story, with an initial printing of 25,000 copies, the book became a New York Times Best-Seller for 216 weeks following its debut and remains the longest-standing New York Times Best-Seller. The book was subsequently made into Clint Eastwood's 1997 film adaptation, with several characters' names changed to protect their privacy. Background Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is atmospherically Deep South coastal (Savannah, Georgia, and Beaufort, South Carolina) and Southern Gothic in tone, depicting a wide range of eccentric personalities in and around the city of Savannah, Georgia. The central narrative concerns the shooting of Danny Hansford, a local male prostitute (characterized as \\"a good time not yet had by all\\" by Prentiss Crowe, a Savannah socialite), by respected antiques dealer Jim Williams, who was also his employer. This resulted in four murder trials, with the fourth ending in acquittal after the judge finally agreed to a change of venue to move the case away from the Savannah jury pool. The book describes Williams' version of the killing, which is that it was in \\"self-defense\\"--the result of Hansford, who is prone to fits of rage, shooting at Williams with a gun that is on display, and Williams shooting back to protect himself--and not murder, pre-meditated or otherwise, by Williams. The death occurred in Williams' home, Mercer House. The book highlights many other notable Savannah residents as well, including The Lady Chablis, a local transgender woman, club performer and entertainer. Chablis provides both a Greek chorus of sorts as well as a light-hearted contrast to the more serious action. Chablis was given a dedicated chapter, as was Emma Kelly, the \\"lady of 6,000 songs\\". Characters and events The book's plot is based on real-life events that occurred in the 1980s and is classified as non-fiction. Because it reads like a novel (and rearranges the sequence of true events in time), it is sometimes referred to as a \\"non-fiction novel.\\" Although the book's timeline is set to coincide with the entire saga of Jim Williams' arrest and four trials for murder, in reality Berendt did not meet Williams for the first time until 1982 ‚Äî after the millionaire had already been convicted of murder the first time and released pending appeal. Berendt also did not move to Savannah to collect material for his book until 1985 ‚Äî after Williams' second conviction for the murder. Williams was a free man and living in Mercer House during Berendt's five years in Savannah.\\"MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF FACT AND FICTION\\" - Washington Examiner, December 29, 1996 Mercer House. The alleged murder of Danny Hansford occurred in Williams' study ‚Äì the bottom left room in this photograph. The house is now known as the Mercer Williams House Museum In the first chapter, when Berendt and Williams are interrupted by Hansford's screaming entrance, that happened prior to their meeting. \\"Jim was having drinks with somebody else,\\" explains Berendt. \\"Jim told me about it and so did somebody else. So I reconstructed it, put myself in there. The first evening in Mercer House is a combination of a lot of stories he told me. Then afterward, I meet all these people ‚Äî Joe Odom, Chablis, Lee Adler. I met all these people, obviously, after the murder, but they don't impact the murder at all, so I simply put them right after my meeting with Jim, and it seems as though I met them before the shooting and I didn't, but so what? All of those meetings with people were actual meetings. They took place in '85 or later, and they are pretty much verbatim what happened with those people and me.\\" Nancy Hillis, who appears as Mandy Nichols, later explained that, contrary to Berendt's portrayal of her, she did not meet Joe Odom until he had moved from 16 East Jones Street to 101 East Oglethorpe Avenue. She also clarified that there was no romantic relationship between her and Odom, largely because Odom was gay. Odom died in 1991, over two years before the book was published, but this is not mentioned in its narrative. The person represented by the character Serena Dawes died in 1974, over twenty years before the book's release. Minerva is based on root doctor Valerie Bowles. She died in 2009, aged 76.‚ÄúReclusive voodoo priestess of ‚ÄòMidnight‚Äô fame dies‚Äù - Savannah Morning News, May 8, 2009 Title The title alludes to the hoodoo notion of \\"midnight,\\" the period between the time for good magic (11:30 P.M. to midnight) and the time for evil magic (midnight to 12:30 A.M.). Although Bonaventure Cemetery is the focus in the book, \\"the garden of good and evil\\" refers principally to the cemetery in Beaufort, South Carolina, where Dr. Louis Buzzard, the husband of Minerva, the folk-magic practitioner who figures in the story, is buried. It is over his grave that Minerva performed the incantations to ensure a more successful result in the retrial for the case of Jim Williams. (The marriage between Minerva and Dr. Buzzard was the invention of John Berendt. Dr. Buzzard was based on Stephen Robinson, who died in 1947, exactly one month shy of his 87th birthday.)\\"Voodoo‚Äôs heyday has passed, but the Gullah tradition still bewitches in SC\\" - The State, January 27, 2016 Cover The famous Bird Girl statue, originally designed both as art and as a birdseed holder, was originally located at Savannah's historic Bonaventure Cemetery. A Savannah photographer, Jack Leigh, was commissioned to take a photograph for the cover of the book. The cover image became immediately iconic, with author John Berendt calling it \\"one of the strongest covers I've ever seen\\", and the statue became a popular stop for tourists. Owing to rising concerns about the integrity of the statue and the cemetery's privacy, Bird Girl was relocated in 1997 for display in Telfair Museums in Savannah. Legacy In 1993, the year before the book's publication, Savannah had five million visitors, who spent almost $600-million during their time in the city.\\"20 Years After Midnight: A Look Back\\" - South magazine, October 7, 2017 Two years after the book's release, Savannah was seeing a 46% increase in tourism. Twenty years later, the number of visitors to the city had jumped to 12.5 million, spending $2.2-billion.
