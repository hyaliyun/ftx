History  The StarPhoenix was first published as The Saskatoon Phoenix on October 17, 1902 (following a short-lived attempt at a local newspaper, the Saskatoon Sentinel). In 1909, it became a daily paper and, in 1910, was renamed the Saskatoon Capital. The paper was sold and bought several times between its inception and the 1920s, at one point being owned by W. F. Herman, the future owner and publisher of the Windsor Star.\\"W. F. Herman, Editor of the Windsor Star,\\" The New York Times (Jan. 17, 1938). By 1927, there were two daily papers in Saskatoon: the Saskatoon Daily Star and the Daily Phoenix. In January 1928, both papers were bought by the Sifton family of Winnipeg and amalgamated into the Saskatoon Star-Phoenix. In the early 1980s the spelling of the newspaper name was modified to StarPhoenix. Between the 1928 amalgamation and the launch of the Saskatoon edition of Metro in April 2012, the StarPhoenix was the city's only daily newspaper. In 1996, the StarPhoenix was bought by the Hollinger newspaper chain. It was subsequently sold to CanWest Global Communications in 2000 and became part of the Southam Newspapers division now called CanWest News Service. CanWest was acquired by Postmedia News, Inc. and is the current owner of The StarPhoenix. In 2015, the StarPhoenix press began printing the Regina Leader-Post in addition to its own print edition, after the Regina press was shut down.

It was formerly known as Barkston in the West Riding of Yorkshire. History The village dates back to at least 1090, when it was spelled Barcestone. Now part of Selby district, the village previously gave its name to the former wapentake of Barkston Ash. The Ash part of the name comes from a large ash tree said to be at the approximate centre of the ancient county of Yorkshire, where meetings for the wapentake would be held. What is now the A162 London Road was a turnpike constructed in 1769: the Main Street and the major part of the village goes East from the junction with this. Barkston Ash was also the name of the local parliamentary constituency of Barkston Ash until 1983, when its boundaries were redrawn to divide the area into Elmet and Selby. Features The village contains a small Church of England church, Holy Trinity, originally a chapel of ease constructed in 1880, but given its current name and status in 1974. There are two pubs, the Ash Tree (on the site of a former coaching inn) and the Boot and Shoe, a village hall and a primary school (dating from 1856). There were formerly two shops and a post office on Main Street, now private residences. There are three 17th to 19th century stone Grade II listed building houses near the junction of Main Street and Church Street: Laurel Farm, Barkston House, and Turpin Hall Farm.

The baselard (also basilard, baslard, in Middle French also and variants, latinized etc., in Middle High German ) is a historical type of dagger or short sword of the Late Middle Ages. Etymology In modern use by antiquarians, the term baselard is mostly reserved for a type of 14th-century dagger with an I-shaped handlePearce (2007) calls this \\"a hilt in the form of a capitol (sic) 'I'\\" (meaning the letter \`I\` including serifs. The idea is that the grip has two pronounced guards at a right angle, on either side of the hand, like the two vertical bars of the letter H, or alternatively like two pronounced horizontal serifs of the letter I) which evolved out of the 13th-century knightly dagger. Contemporary usage was less specific, and the term in Middle French and Middle English could probably be applied to a wider class of large dagger. The term (in many spelling variants) first appears in the first half of the 14th century. There is evidence that the term baselard is in origin a Middle French or Medieval Latin corruption of the German basler [messer] \\"Basel knife\\".Harold L. Peterson, Daggers And Fighting Knives of The Western World (1968)OED in its current (2010) online edition preserves the suggestion from the original New English Dictionary fascicle Ant‚ÄìBatten by Murray (1885), suggesting that the word is \\"probably a derivative of late Latin badile, badillus a bill-hook (P. Meyer [1874])\\". This ad-hoc etymology has been obsolete since antiquarian Claude Blair discovered an explicit record of 14th-century baselards manufactured in Basel (basolardi di basola) in the accounts of an arms dealer of Florence, Francesco Datini, dated to 1375. See Meier (1998). Earlier authors made other attempts at suggesting plausible etymologies. Jonathan ooucher in his Glossary of Archaic and provincial words (1833) judges this task to be \\"almost desperate\\", but goes on to suggest a corruption from bastard (as used in \\"bastard sword\\"). Johan Ihre based on a Swedish form basslere assumed the word to be \\"Old Teutonic\\" (according to Boucher). Oberlin (1781) also claims Germanic origin by connecting it to a \\"Gothic basslara\\", but alternatively also to \\"Lat. Barb. bisacuta, bizachius, besague\\". The first printed dictionary of the German language, the 1477 Vetus Teutonista by Gerardus de Schueren, lists the word as baslere. Both the term baselard and the large dagger with H-shaped hilt or \\"baselard proper\\" appear by the mid 14th century. Several 14th-century attestations from France gloss the term as coutel \\"knife\\".suggesting that the reader was at the time not assumed to be familiar with the term. E.g.: cutellos ... seu badelares (1355), un coutel, appell√© Badelare (1348), Basalardum seu cutelhum (1386), coustel portatif, appell√© Baudelaire (1415) Historical uses A 14th-century Swiss basler, predecessor of the classical Swiss dagger used in the 16th century. Depictions of mid-14th-century examples are preserved as part of tomb effigies (figuring as part of the full military dress of the deceased knight). By the mid-14th century, the baselard is a popular sidearm carried by the more violence-prone section of civilian society, and it retains an association with hooliganism. One early attestation of the German form pasler (1341) is from a court document of Nuremberg recording a case against a man who had injured a woman by striking her on the head with this weapon.W. Schultheiss, Die Acht-, Verbots- und Fehdeb√ºcher N√ºrnbergs von 1285‚Äì1400 (1960), 68, 21 Several German law codes of the 14th to 15th centuries outlaw the carrying of a basler inside a city.* Nuremberg : man hat verboten [...] daz dhein burger weder in der stat noch auzwendig niht sol tragen dhein silberin g√ºrteln [...] dhein welhisch messer noch dheinen basler (Satzungsb√ºcher und Satzungen der Reichsstadt N√ºrnberg aus dem 14.

Rudolf Steffens), in: Mainzer Zeitschrift 98 (2003), 1-10; beseler glossed as \\"two-edged knives\\" in F. J. Mone, Der Friedensbruch der Stadt Mainz, um 1430 (1856). *A 1427 law code of Tegernsee lists pasl√§r as one of a number of illegal weapons (verpotne wer), setting a fine for carrying them in the street: Gustav Winter, Osterreichische Weist√ºmer, vol. 8 (1896), p. 970. see also mhdwb-online.de By the late 14th century, it became fashionable in much of Western Europe, including France, Italy, Germany and England. Sloane MS 2593 (c. 1400) records a song satirizing the use of oversized baselard knives as fashion accessories.prenegarde prenegarde, thus bere I myn baselard; Piers Plowman also associates the weapon with vain gaudiness: in this case, two priests, \\"Sir John and Sir Geoffrey\\", are reported to have been sporting \\"a girdle of silver, a baselard or a ballok knyf with buttons overgilt.\\"cited after Dilon 1887 Wat Tyler was slain with a baselard by the mayor of London, William Walworth, in 1381, and the original weapon was \\"still preserved with peculiar veneration by the Company of Fishmongers\\" in the 19th century.according to Boucher, Glossary of Archaic and provincial words (1833). But the depiction of the death of Wat Tyler in the late-14th-century Royal MS 18.E shows Walworth wielding a large, curved falchion. The corresponding image in the Chronicle of Froissart shows a group assaulting Tyler with a variety of weapons (including a Falchion), while the weapon used to slay Tyler is drawn as a long, straight baselard sword. In the Old Swiss Confederacy, the term basler seems to have referred to the 14th- to 15th-century weapons with the characteristic crescent-shaped pommel and crossguard, which occurred with widely variant blade length, and which by the early 16th century had split into the two discrete classes of the short Swiss dagger (Schweizerdolch) and the long Swiss degen (Schweizerdegen), indicating a semantic split between the formerly synonymous terms Dolch and Degen. The baselard proper falls out of use by the early 16th century. The term baselard and its variations persist for some time, but lose their connection with a specific type of knife. French baudelaire could now refer to a curved, single-edged hewing knife. Basilarda is the name of a sword in Orlando Furioso. Also in English, the term could now refer to a Turkish weapon like the yataƒüan.\\"a hoked Baslarde is a perelse wepon with the Turkes.\\" (Horman's Vulgaria, cited after Dillon 1887) A very late occurrence of the term is found in 1602, in the context of a duel fought in Scotland, in Canonbie. The document recording the agreement on the weapons used in the duel mentions \\"two baslaerd swords with blades a yard and half quarter long\\".cited in Joseph Nicolson, Richard Burn The history and antiquities of the counties of Westmorland and Cumberland (1777), here cited after OED. Apparently intended is the long form of the rapier which is contemporaneously also called a \\"long sword\\" by George Silver. C.f. After this, use of the term is restricted to antiquarian contexts.

Early life Son of a railway engineer, politician and editor of the newspaper El Eco Ferrolano Jos√© Canalejas y Casas and of Mar√≠a del Amparo M√©ndez Romero. He moved with his family to Madrid, and in October 1867 he enrolled in the Instituto San Isidro, \\"because at that time the incorporated schools could not teach the last two years of the six who made up the baccalaureate ¬ª. Already at the Central University of Madrid, he obtained the degrees of Law in 1871 and Philosophy in 1872, and the degree of doctor in both faculties. In 1873 he was assistant professor, but failed in two chair examinations, so he left teaching. He joined the company of the Railways of Madrid to Ciudad Real and Badajoz, where he became secretary general and He defended the company as a lawyer in lawsuits with other Spanish railway companies. Political career In 1881 Canalejas was elected deputy for Soria. Two years later, he was appointed under-secretary for the Prime Minister's department under Posada Herrera; he became minister of justice in 1888 and finance from 1894 to 1895. A brief spell as Minister of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce from March to May 1902 ended after only two months, when he resigned as he regarded the Sagasta Ministry weak and \\"incapable of safeguarding the Sovereignty of the State in view of the encroachments of the Vatican\\".[cited in The Times 30 May 1902 ] He served as President of the Congress of Deputies (the equivalent to the Anglo- Saxon office of parliamentary Speaker) from 1906 to 1907. =Canalejas Ministry = After the 1909 \\"Tragic Week\\" bloody confrontations in Barcelona, Antonio Maura resigned and Segismundo Moret was again appointed prime minister. Moret was forced to resign in February 1910 when he was replaced by Canalejas who became Prime Minister and chief of the Liberal party. Moret denounced the Canalejas Ministry as 'a democratic flag being used to cover reactionary merchandise'.Professor J. C J. Metford: The Spanish Anarchist Movement, 1908-75, Mastermind Quiz Book, 1984 While in office, Canalejas (with the support of his sovereign, Alfonso XIII) introduced several electoral reforms that aimed to win working-class support for moderately conservative policies; to curb the power of independent political bosses, quite common at the time, especially in rural areas; to weaken excesses of Catholic educational clericalism without threatening the Catholic Church as such; and to turn Spain into a true democracy. These policies successfully faced the social turmoil that radicals had been creating within Spain (and which had led, in 1909, to a brief but bloody unrest in Barcelona). On 12 November 1912, while he was window-shopping the literary novelties of the day from a bookstore in central Madrid, he was fatally shot by anarchist Manuel Pardi√±as. Legacy Canalejas believed in the possibility of a monarchy open to a thoroughgoing democratic policy both in economic and in civil and political matters. Salvador de Madariaga, the liberal historian, argued that the disasters Spain experienced during the 1930s could be traced to Canalejas' murder, given that this murder deprived King Alfonso of one of his few genuine statesmen.

A new album, \\"Pick\\", with The Travelin McCoury's, was released in July 2012. Instruments A self-taught musician, Williams usually performs with a variety instruments connected to a Boss Loop Station RC-300 phrase looper pedal, which allow him to play a riff once on an instrument, record, and repeat it. He also uses a Gibson Echoplex Digital Pro looping unit for that effect. He often then records and loops an accompanying instrument. This allows him to play unaccompanied on stage, helping him to recreate the sound of a full band. He also uses a wide variety of effects, including an envelope filter expression pedal, wah pedal, a Line 6 tap delay, a Roland GR-55 guitar synth, a Line 6 M13 Stompbox Modeler Guitar Multi Effects Pedal, and a Talk Box. His main guitars used are a Martin HD-28 and D-35, an Alvarez/Joe Veillette MTB baritone, a Gibson Chet Atkins SST Acoustic Electric Guitar with synth pickup routed to a Roland synth processor, a Fender Precision bass, a Becker Acoustic Retro, an Avante baritone acoustic guitar, a Rick Turner baritone 12-string, a Tacoma Thunderhawk, an early 1950s tempo and a Gordon Anderson custom 8-string.Keller Willams' Looparama, by Barry Cleveland, Guitar Player, September 2004, Retrieved May 9, 2008.

In 2009, Williams started the \\"Once a Week Freek\\" on his website, where every week he released a new song from his album \\"Odd\\". Upon release of every song on the album, he released the entire album in one download. Due to the success of this idea, Williams chose to keep the \\"Once a Week Freek\\" project going and released a new song/video or two each week. These tracks consisted of live performances of previously recorded songs, unreleased covers of other bands' songs, or just different renditions of his own recorded music. Williams played as a member of the Rhythm Devils with Grateful Dead drummers Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart at the Gathering of the Vibes festival in 2010. Williams then appeared with the Rhythm Devils in nine July shows on their summer tour.

The band was formed from two other local punk bands, The Contingent and TV Brakes. The songwriter and vocalist Beki Bondage (born Rebecca Bond) was a founding member of the band. Although there was a period of time when the band had a different vocalist she reformed the band in 1997. History =Original band= Vice Squad was formed in 1979 with an initial line-up of Beki Bondage (vocals), Dave Bateman (guitar), Mark Hambly (bass guitar) and Shane Baldwin (drums), and played its first gig at Bristol University's Anson Rooms on 12 April 1979. Bateman and Baldwin had previously been members of the TV Brakes. The first release by TV Brakes was the track \\"Nothing\\", which was included on the 1979 compilation Avon Calling. Members of the band were involved in setting up the Riot City label with Simon Edwards, the label becoming one of the major punk labels of the era. Vice Squad took some time to make further impact, only playing six gigs in 1980. Its first single, \\"Last Rockers\\" in 1981, was well- received, selling over 20,000 copies and spending almost forty weeks in the UK Indie Chart, reaching number 7. The follow-up, \\"Resurrection\\", reached number 4, and the band undertook a tour supporting UK Subs. The singles received airplay and support from BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, and the band went on to record two sessions for his show, in 1981 and 1982. In 1981, the band signed with the major label EMI (on their Zonophone subsidiary), prompting criticism from many within the DIY punk scene. Their first album, No Cause For Concern, was released in late 1981, reaching number 32 in the UK Album Chart. A second album followed in 1982, and the band embarked on a tour of the United States and Canada. On returning from the US, Bondage announced that she was leaving the band. She went on to front Ligotage and later Beki and the Bombshells, and, without her, Vice Squad were dropped by EMI. The band carried on, however, replacing Bondage with a new singer called Lia (who was previously known as Jools and had been the singer for local band Affairs of the Heart). The new line-up, also including the band's manager Mark \\"Sooty\\" Byrne on second guitar, signed with Anagram Records, and recorded a session for David Jensen's BBC radio show. Indie hits continued with singles such as \\"Black Sheep\\" and \\"You'll Never Know\\", but sales dwindled, and the band split up in 1985. Dave Bateman died in 2007. =New band= Performing in 2005 Bondage formed a new version of Vice Squad in 1997, along with former members of The Bombshells, after being persuaded to perform the old material at the Holidays in the Sun festival. The line-up was initially Bondage on vocals, Paul Rooney (guitar), Stilton (bass guitar) and Pumpy (drums). The rhythm section was replaced by Michael Giaquinto (bass guitar) and Tony Piper (drums) in late 1999/early 2000. This new line-up recorded several albums and toured Europe and the United States. In 2006, they released the album Defiant, produced by Rooney. =Back to \\"old school punk\\"= 2008 was spent recording the album, Fairground for the Demented which was shelved as the band decided the finished collection of songs did not represent the 'Old School' punk sound that the band wanted to achieve. This collection of songs is currently released in digital form with retailers such as iTunes and Napster. The gritty punk style was eventually realised in 2009 when Vice Squad released the London Underground album which was co-produced by Bond and Rooney. Released on their own Last Rockers Label, London Underground has received rave reviews on the Studs And Punks website and songs such as \\"Punx United\\", \\"Old Skool\\" and \\"Sniffing Glue\\" form a major part of the band's live show. Vice Squad returned to America in 2009 on an 18 date tour of the western states promoting London Underground with the American drummer Nick Manning, and Wayne Cotton on Bass (Ex Stuntface bass / front man) with support from The Lower Class Brats. The album Punk Rock Radio was released in 2011. In 2014 The band's new album, Cardboard Country is completed and is released on the band's own Last Rockers Records label on with funding from fans via the band's first ever Pledge Music Campaign. The first 500 copies of the album came with a 6 track EP. During 2018, the band started recording their forthcoming album, Battle Of Britain, which will be released on their own Last Rockers label through Cargo on 1 May 2020. Six singles/EPs have been released prior to the album's release, including two versions of Ignored To Death. On 11 April 2020, due to the lockdown in the UK, The Beki and Lumpy Show was launched on Facebook, featuring Beki and Paul, with videos, chat and quizzes, broadcasting every Saturday evening.

It is about and links Cornhill in the west to Aldgate in the east. It was formerly the start of the A11 road from London to Norwich, but that route now starts further east at Aldgate. Leadenhall Street has always been a centre of commerce. It connected the medieval market of Leaden Hall with Aldgate, the eastern gate in the Roman city wall. The East India Company had its headquarters there, as later did the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O;). By the mid 20th century, grand stone-faced offices lined the street. Today it is closely associated with the insurance industry and particularly the Lloyd's insurance market, with its dramatic building in the adjacent Lime Street. It forms part of a cluster of tall buildings including the 48-storey ‚ÄúCheesegrater‚Äù and the 38-storey ‚ÄúScalpel‚Äù. Other buildings planned for the street include the 57-storey ‚ÄúDiamond‚Äù, the 50-storey ‚ÄúPrussian Blue‚Äù and the 34-storey ‚ÄúGotham City‚Äù. Older buildings like the medieval church of St Katherine Cree seem incongruous among these towers, but the medieval heritage is preserved in the narrow slightly curving street and dense commercial activity. History Leadenhall Street c1837 looking east past East India House (engraving after Thomas H. Shepherd) Leadenhall Street looking east from Bishopsgate in 1955 Leadenhall Street looking east from St Mary Axe in 2007 Although Leadenhall Street is within the walls of Roman Londinium, and a map published in 1897 showed it as a Roman street, this remains speculative. The basilica, the largest building in Londinium, extended beneath the western end of Leadenhall Street. Roman remains have also been found on both sides of Leadenhall Street, beneath East India House (now No 12) and the P&O; Building (now St Helen‚Äôs Square). The street probably originated in the medieval period. It appears in a map of London in 1270, then named Cornhulle in the west and Alegatestrete in the east. The name derives from a lead-roofed mansion, first used as a poultry market in 1321. The street runs from this Leaden Hall towards Aldgate, the eastern gate of the city wall. The only remaining buildings from this period are the churches of St Katherine Cree and St Andrew Undershaft in the adjacent street of St Mary Axe. The name ‚ÄúLedenhall Street‚Äù first appears on a map from 1658. In the Great Fire of London in 1666, the north-eastern edge of the damaged area reached Leadenhall Market, leaving Leadenhall Street itself intact. From 1729 to 1861 the largest building in the street was East India House, the headquarters of the East India Company. In 1840 Leadenhall Street comprised mainly 4-storey stone buildings, as shown in a pictorial record by John Tallis. Its business directory lists 158 separate premises with a wide variety of trades and merchants. Apart from St Katherine Cree, there are no survivors from this period. The oldest is the former Leadenhall Press building (No 50) from 1868. In the Victorian era, merchants were progressively replaced by banks, typically sturdy 6-storey stone buildings. Notable survivors include Lloyds Bank (No 113), the former Bank of Adelaide (No 11), the former Grace & Co (No 147) and the Lutyens designed No 139. Bomb damage during World War II mainly affected the south side of Leadenhall Street to the east of Lime Street (No 26 to 49). Early post-war reconstruction matched the height of existing buildings, while introducing modern styles such as the former Scandinavian Bank (No 36) and the former Bank of Credit and Commerce International (No 100). In the late 1980s, the former Midland Bank (No 69) and the former Swiss Re House (No 77) introduced the post-modern style. Today Leadenhall Street is closely associated with the insurance industry and particularly the Lloyd's insurance market, which occupied No 12 from 1928 to 1958, and has since been based in the adjacent Lime Street. The 14-storey Lloyd's building, completed in 1986, started a trend for dramatic architecture in the area. Tall buildings on Leadenhall Street are constrained by the protected view of St Paul's Cathedral from Fleet Street. To avoiding impinging on this view, the 48-storey Leadenhall Building (No 122) adopted a distinctive sloping profile, known as ‚ÄúThe Cheesegrater‚Äù, while ‚ÄúThe Scalpel‚Äù, a 38-storey building across the street (52 Lime Street), slopes in the opposite direction. Other buildings being developed, including the 57-storey \\"Diamond\\" (No 100) and the 50-storey ‚ÄúPrussian Blue‚Äù on the corner with Bishopsgate, will fill in the gaps in this cluster of buildings.

It is a specific type of the general practice of excarnation. It is practiced in the region of Tibet and the Chinese provinces and autonomous regions of Qinghai, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia, as well as in Mongolia, Bhutan and parts of India such as Sikkim and Zanskar. The locations of preparation and sky burial are understood in the Vajrayana Buddhist traditions as charnel grounds.

The majority of Tibetan people and many Mongols adhere to Vajrayana Buddhism, which teaches the transmigration of spirits. There is no need to preserve the body, as it is now an empty vessel. Birds may eat it or nature may cause it to decompose. The function of the sky burial is simply to dispose of the remains in as generous a way as possible (the origin of the practice's Tibetan name). In much of Tibet and Qinghai, the ground is too hard and rocky to dig a grave, and due to the scarcity of fuel and timber, sky burials were typically more practical than the traditional Buddhist practice of cremation. In the past, cremation was limited to high lamas and some other dignitaries, but modern technology and difficulties with sky burial have led to an increased use of cremation by commoners.China Daily. \\"Funeral reforms in Tibetan areas\\". 13 Dec 2012. Accessed 18 Jul 2013. Other nations which performed air burial were the Caucasus nations of Georgians, Abkhazians and Adyghe people, in which they put the corpse in a hollow tree trunk. History and development The Tibetan sky-burials appear to have evolved from ancient practices of defleshing corpses as discovered in archeological finds in the region.PBS. \\"Cave People of the Himalaya\\". These practices most likely came out of practical considerations,... but they could also be related to more ceremonial practices similar to the suspected sky burial evidence found at G√∂bekli Tepe (11,500 years before present) and Stonehenge (4,500 years BP). Most of Tibet is above the tree line, and the scarcity of timber makes cremation economically unfeasible. Additionally, subsurface interment is difficult since the active layer is not more than a few centimeters deep, with solid rock or permafrost beneath the surface. The customs are first recorded in an indigenous 12th-century Buddhist treatise, which is colloquially known as the Book of the Dead (Bardo Thodol).. Tibetan tantricism appears to have influenced the procedure... The body is cut up according to instructions given by a lama or adept.. Vultures feeding on cut pieces of body at a 1985 sky burial in Lhasa, Tibet Mongolians traditionally buried their dead (sometimes with human or animal sacrifice for the wealthier chieftains) but the T√ºmed adopted sky burial following their conversion to Tibetan Buddhism under Altan Khan during the Ming Dynasty and other banners subsequently converted under the Manchu Qing Dynasty.Heike, Michel. \\"The Open-Air Sacrificial Burial of the Mongols\\". Accessed 18 Jul 2013. Sky burial was initially treated as a primitive superstition and sanitation concern by the Communist governments of both the PRC and Mongolia; both states closed many temples and China banned the practice completely from the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s until the 1980s.. During this period, Sky burials were considered among the Four Olds, which was the umbrella term used by Communists to describe anti- proletarian customs, cultures and ideas. As a result of these policies, many corpses would simply be buried or thrown in rivers. Many families believed the souls of these people would never escape purgatory and became ghosts. Sky burial nonetheless continued to be practiced in rural areas and has even received official protection in recent years. However, the practice continues to diminish for a number of reasons, including restrictions on its practice near urban areas and diminishing numbers of vultures in rural districts. Finally, Tibetan practice holds that the yak carrying the body to the charnel grounds should be set free, making the rite much more expensive than a service at a crematorium. Purpose and meaning Corpse being carried from Lhasa for sky burial about 1920 For Tibetan Buddhists, sky burial and cremation are templates of instructional teaching on the impermanence of life. Jhator is considered an act of generosity on the part of the deceased, since the deceased and his/her surviving relatives are providing food to sustain living beings. Such generosity and compassion for all beings are important virtues in Buddhism. Although some observers have suggested that jhator is also meant to unite the deceased person with the sky or sacred realm, this does not seem consistent with most of the knowledgeable commentary and eyewitness reports, which indicate that Tibetans believe that at this point life has completely left the body and the body contains nothing more than simple flesh. Only people who directly know the deceased usually observe it, when the excarnation happens at night. Vajrayana iconography The tradition and custom of the jhator afforded Traditional Tibetan medicine and thangka iconography with a particular insight into the interior workings of the human body. Pieces of the human skeleton were employed in ritual tools such as the skullcup, thigh-bone trumpet. The 'symbolic bone ornaments' (Skt: ; Tib: rus pa'i rgyanl phyag rgya) are also known as \\"mudra\\" or 'seals'. The Hevajra Tantra identifies the Symbolic Bone Ornaments with the Five Wisdoms and Jamgon Kongtrul in his commentary to the Hevajra Tantra explains this further.. Setting Bundesarchiv A traditional jhator is performed in specified locations in Tibet (and surrounding areas traditionally occupied by Tibetans). Drigung Monastery is one of the three most important jhator sites. The procedure takes place on a large flat rock long used for the purpose. The charnel ground (durtro) is always higher than its surroundings. It may be very simple, consisting only of the flat rock, or it may be more elaborate, incorporating temples and stupa (chorten in Tibetan). Relatives may remain nearby. during the jhator, possibly in a place where they cannot see it directly. The jhator usually takes place at dawn. The full jhator procedure (as described below) is elaborate and expensive. Those who cannot afford it simply place their deceased on a high rock where the body decomposes or is eaten by birds and animals. In 2010, a prominent Tibetan incarnate lama, Metrul Tendzin Gyatso, visited the sky burial site near the Larung Gar Buddhist Institute in Sertar County, Sichuan, and was dismayed by its poor condition. With the stated goal of restoring dignity to the dead and creating a better environment for the vultures, the lama subsequently rebuilt and improved the platform where bodies are cut up, adding many statues and other carved features around it, and constructed a large parking lot for the convenience of visitors. Procedure Litang monastery in Tibet Accounts from observers vary. The following description is assembled from multiple accounts by observers from the U.S. and Europe. References appear at the end. =Participants= Prior to the procedure, monks may chant mantra around the body and burn juniper incense ‚Äì although ceremonial activities often take place on the preceding day. The work of disassembling of the body may be done by a monk, or, more commonly, by rogyapas (\\"body-breakers\\"). All the eyewitness accounts remarked on the fact that the rogyapas did not perform their task with gravity or ceremony, but rather talked and laughed as during any other type of physical labor. According to Buddhist teaching, this makes it easier for the soul of the deceased to move on from the uncertain plane between life and death onto the next life. Some accounts refer to individuals who carry out sky burial rituals as a ‚ÄòTokden‚Äô which is Tibetan for ‚ÄòSky Burial Master‚Äô. While a Tokden has an important role in burial rites, they are often people of low social status and sometimes receive payment from the families of the deceased. =Disassembling the body= 300x300px According to most accounts, vultures are given the whole body. Then, when only the bones remain, these are broken up with mallets, ground with tsampa (barley flour with tea and yak butter, or milk), given to the crows and hawks that have waited for the vultures to depart. In one account, the leading rogyapa cut off the limbs and hacked the body to pieces, handing each part to his assistants, who used rocks to pound the flesh and bones together to a pulp, which they mixed with tsampa before the vultures were summoned to eat. In some cases, a Todken will use butcher's tools to divide the body. Sometimes the internal organs were removed and processed separately, but they too were consumed by birds. The hair is removed from the head and may be simply thrown away; at Drigung, it seems, at least some hair is kept in a room of the monastery. None of the eyewitness accounts specify which kind of knife is used in the jhator. One source states that it is a \\"ritual flaying knife\\" or trigu (Sanskrit kartika), but another source expresses skepticism, noting that the trigu is considered a woman's tool (rogyapas seem to be exclusively male). =Vultures= 300x300px The species contributing to the ritual are typically the griffon and Himalayan vultures. In places where there are several jhator offerings each day, the birds sometimes have to be coaxed to eat, which may be accomplished with a ritual dance. If a small number of vultures come down to eat, or if portions of the body are left over after the vultures fly away, or if the body is completely left untouched, it is considered to be a bad omen in Buddhist beliefs.In these cases, according to Buddhist belief, there are negative implications for the individual and/or the individual's family, such as the individual being buried lived a bad life or accumulated bad karma throughout their lifetime and throughout their past lives, thus predetermining them to a bad rebirth. In places where fewer bodies are offered, the vultures are more eager, and sometimes have to be fended off with sticks during the initial preparations. Often there is a limit to how many corpses can be consumed at a certain burial site, prompting lamas to find different areas. It is believed that if too many corpses are disposed in a certain burial site, ghosts may appear. Not only are vultures an important aspect to celestial burial but also to its habitat's ecology. They contribute to carcass removal and nutrient recycling, as they are scavengers of the land. Due to an alarming drop in their population, in 1988, the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Wildlife added certain species of vultures into the \\"rare\\" or \\"threatened\\" categories of their national list of protected wild animals. Local Chinese governments surrounding sky burial locations have established regulations to avoid disturbance of the vultures during these rituals, as well as to not allow individuals who have passed away due to infectious diseases or toxicosis from receiving a sky burial in order to prevent compromising the health of the vultures. Zoroastrianism Ancient Zoroastrians believed the dead body should be put in a structure called a Dakhma to be feasted upon by birds of prey, because the burial or burning of the corpses would cause water and soil to become dirty, which is forbidden in the ancient religion. In popular culture A jhator was filmed, with permission from the family, for Frederique Darragon's documentary Secret Towers of the Himalayas, which aired on the Science Channel in fall 2008. The camera work was deliberately careful to never show the body itself, while documenting the procedure, birds, and tools. The ritual was featured in films such as The Horse Thief, Kundun, and Himalaya. A sky burial was shown in BBC's Human Planet ‚Äì Mountains. The semi- autobiographical book Wolf Totem discusses sky burial. Sky burials are among the methods of burial discussed in Neil Gaiman's The Sandman: Worlds' End.

Their lineup consisted of Anthony Moore (keyboards), Peter Blegvad (guitar) and Dagmar Krause (vocals). The band members moved to England in 1974 where they merged with Henry Cow, but the merger ended soon afterwards and Slapp Happy split up. Slapp Happy's sound was characterised by Dagmar Krause's unique vocal style. From 1982 there have been brief reunions to create an opera called Camera, record the album √áa Va in 1998, and perform shows around the world. History =Germany= Slapp Happy was formed in 1972 in Hamburg, Germany by British experimental composer Anthony Moore. Moore had recorded two avant-garde/experimental solo LPs at Faust's studio in W√ºmme, Bremen, Germany for Polydor Records. When he presented them with a third album, they rejected it, stating that they wanted something more commercial. Moore obliged and asked his American friend, Peter Blegvad to come to Hamburg and help him write some pop songs. Blegvad recalls responding, \\"Pop songs. Three-chord stuff. How hard can that be ...?\\" For them it was a joke. They said, \\"we'll take the piss out of pop.\\" Calling themselves Slapp Happy, Moore and Blegvad wrote the song \\"Just a Conversation\\" in 20 minutes. They recorded it in Faust's studio with Faust's rhythm section backing them. But when the pair found their singing was not working, they asked Moore's girlfriend (and future wife), Dagmar Krause to sing. She had sung previously on stage and in several groups, but wanted to stop. Reluctantly, however, she agreed to sing, and transformed Slapp Happy from a joke into something unexpected. American music academic Benjamin Piekut said \\"Krause's voice possessed a levity and grace that was shot through with world-weary Lenyiana.\\" Now a trio, Slapp Happy presented Polydor with \\"Just a Conversation\\", and were surprised when the label released it as a single in 1972, backed by \\"Jumping Jonah\\", another pop ditty they had recorded. Polydor also gave them a record deal. Moore and Blegvad continued writing \\"naive rock\\", as Blegvad described it, and when they had enough songs, the trio returned to W√ºmme in May 1972 to record Sort Of, their debut album. Once again, Faust were their backing band. The LP was released later in 1972, but did not sell well, primarily because Slapp Happy refused to perform live. In late 1972 Slapp Happy began recording their second album, Casablanca Moon with Faust. The songs here were more sophisticated and artful than those on Sort Of. Moore's music was harmonically richer, and Blegvad's lyrics more serious and poetic. Blegvad said, \\"We were snobs about pop music ... Anthony was more interested in making modern classical music.\\" But they acknowledged that their attempts at commercial music were na√Øve and called their approach \\"the Douanier Rousseau sound\\", after the self-taught French artist. But Polydor did not like the direction Slapp Happy were taking and rejected the album. =England= In early 1973, Slapp Happy left Germany for England. Henry Cow, who had recently signed a record deal with the then emerging Virgin Records, heard a cassette tape of the trio's rejected second album, and were impressed and recommended that Virgin sign them. The record label, however, was concerned about how receptive English audiences would be to Krause's German accent. But after several other musicians and critics advocated them, including Robert Wyatt and Ian MacDonald in New Musical Express, Virgin added Slapp Happy to their roster later in 1973. Soon after signing, Slapp Happy went to Virgin's Manor Studios in Oxfordshire in early 1974 to re-record Casablanca Moon. Blegvad said Virgin felt that their unreleased second album was \\"a good demo, but too crude for radio, so we re- recorded the same songs with swisher production\\". Session musicians were used, under the direction of violinist Graham Preskett, with new arrangements of the songs by Roger Wootton of Comus. Virgin released the album as Slapp Happy in May 1974. The new recording attracted the attention of the press, particularly after Wyatt endorsed it. But Henry Cow were not so complementary. Blegvad remembers them saying, \\"Well, it's OK, the songs aren't bad, but it's really a missed opportunity. You made a conventional pop record and you could have done something more.\\" It was not until 1980 that Recommended Records released the original Casablanca Moon (with Faust) as Acnalbasac Noom (the words of the original title written backwards). Comparison of the two releases revealed two very different musical arrangements. Acnalbasac Noom had a raw and unsophisticated feel about it, whereas Slapp Happy tended to be more sentimental with more complex arrangements, including a string orchestra. In June 1974, there were plans for a joint appearance by Slapp Happy and Virgin label mates Henry Cow and Wyatt at a free concert in Hyde Park in London, but this was cancelled at the last minute. However, on 25 June Slapp Happy recorded a Top Gear session for the BBC, enlisting the help of former and current Cow members Geoff Leigh, Fred Frith and Lindsay Cooper, plus Wyatt, who contributed guest vocals and percussion to a version of Blegvad's \\"A Little Something\\" from Casablanca Moon. Credited as \\"Slapp Happy & Friends\\", this was later released in 1994 on Wyatt's compilation album, Flotsam Jetsam. Slapp Happy returned to the studio in May 1974 to record two new compositions with session musicians, \\"Europa\\" and \\"War (Is Energy Enslaved)\\". Virgin had requested a single that was \\"radio friendly\\", but upon hearing the songs they rejected them, stating that they felt they were better suited for an album. This caused Blegvad and Moore to rethink their songwriting strategy, and they began producing more serious and challenging music. Moore said they had written material \\"which had to be executed using a musical vocabulary greater than Peter or I could handle.\\" This led to Slapp Happy asking Henry Cow to be their backing band on their second album for Virgin. After discussions between the two bands, they collaborated in November 1974 and recorded Desperate Straights. \\"Europa\\" and \\"War\\" were re-recorded, and the album was later released under the name \\"Slapp Happy/Henry Cow\\". The success of this collaboration surprised everyone, considering how dissimilar the two bands were. The music often had a Berlin Cabaret feel about it with a taste of avant-garde jazz. Slapp Happy and Henry Cow decided to merge and returned to the studio in early 1975 to record Henry Cow's In Praise of Learning. The only real contribution from Slapp Happy (besides Dagmar's singing) was the Moore/Blegvad song \\"War\\", which blended in well with the album's political aggression. But differences in approach between the two groups had come to a head in April 1975 and Moore and Blegvad quit, suggesting that Henry Cow's music was too serious (and political) for their liking. Krause, however, elected to remain with Henry Cow, who needed a vocalist. This effectively meant the end of Slapp Happy as a band. They did, however, record one more single, \\"Johnny's Dead\\", without Krause, which was released in July 1975. It was credited to \\"Slapp Happy featuring Anthony Moore\\", and was the beginning of Moore's solo career, in which he spelt his name \\"More\\". =Reunions= Moore and Blegvad then both embarked on separate solo careers. In 1982 the trio reunited briefly to record a Slapp Happy single, \\"Everybody's Slimmin' (Even Men and Women)\\" on their own private label, Half-Cat Records. Here Krause sings rap-style to a rhythm box sound. They also performed live (for the first time ever) during the \\"Dial M For Music\\" festival, held at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts on 10 September 1982. The three collaborated again in 1991 on a specially commissioned television opera \\"Camera\\", produced by After Image for Channel 4, based on an original idea by Krause, with words by Blegvad and music by Moore. Krause played the lead character \\"Melusina\\" and the opera was broadcast two years later on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. The soundtrack Camera was released on CD in 2000, although under the names \\"Dagmar Krause, Anthony Moore and Peter Blegvad\\" and not \\"Slapp Happy\\". In 1997, Slapp Happy reunited again to record a new studio album √áa Va on Richard Branson's new V2 label. It was Slapp Happy's first album since 1975 and the music picked up from where it had left off with literate and quirky pop songs. A departure from the past, however, was that they made the music themselves, playing all the instruments and using looped samples to produce a layered sound on many of the tracks. Slapp Happy was popular in Japan and toured there in 2000, playing on stage without any backing musicians. A CD, Live in Japan, was released in 2001 in Japan only. Krause, Moore and Blegvad reformed Slapp Happy again in November 2016 to perform with Faust at the Week-End festival in Cologne, Germany. The two groups also played together on 10‚Äì11 February 2017 at Cafe Oto in London. On 24 February 2017 Slapp Happy, without Faust, performed at Mt. Rainer Hall, Shibuya in Tokyo. In September 2017, Slapp Happy and Faust played at the 10th Rock in Opposition festival in Carmaux, France. They made a final appearance in November 2017 in Brussels, Belgium. Music Slapp Happy's music was eccentric pop with an \\"avant-garde\\" twist to it. It drew on a variety of musical idioms, including waltzes, bossa novas, French chansons and tangos. The songs' lyrics were literate and playful while the mood varied from \\"dreamy\\" to sinister. However, it was Dagmar Krause's unusual and eerie high-pitched voice that was the group's most arresting feature. Her German-inflected vocals ranged from a sweet melodious croon to the \\"love-it- or-hate-it\\" Armageddon style typified on In Praise of Learning.

Karoonda takes its name from the Aboriginal word for \\"winter camp\\". The current boundaries include the former town of Lowaldie, which was the next stop on the railway line away from Adelaide. At the 2016 census, the locality of Karoonda had a population of 512 of which 351 were living in and around the town of Karoonda. In Karoonda locality 90.6% of people were born in Australia and 93.3% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were Uniting Church 25.0% and No Religion 22.4%. Karoonda was founded on wheat growing early in the 20th century (proclaimed on 11 December 1913), but the cleared land is also suitable for raising merino sheep. The Karoonda Development Group instigated and built a larger-than-life sculpture of a Merino ram in the park in the main street to emphasise this. There are even seats with rams heads dotted around the town. A number of other agricultural and horticultural industries are now also represented in the district. Each year the Karoonda Farm Fair is held, a two-day event attracting over 10,000 visitors to the town. In 1922 the District Council of Karoonda was established, bringing local-level government to the township and surrounding district for the first time. Karoonda briefly shot to international fame in 1930 when a meteorite fell to earth just to the east of the town on the night of 25 November. Karoonda Area School was the first area school in South Australia. Karoonda is located in the local government area of District Council of Karoonda East Murray, the state electoral district of Hammond and the federal Division of Barker. Pioneer Park on East Terrace is being developed as a Malleelands Pioneer Railways and farm museum, with displays of harvest machinery, plows, railway rolling stock and facilities already in place. The Nature Trail & Bush Walk is adjacent. Railways Railways were built in 1911-1914 to open up the mallee. Karoonda was on the Brown's Well railway line (extended to Barmera in 1928) and became a junction with the Waikerie railway line to the north and the Peebinga railway line to the east (south of the main line).Rail Line to Nowhere Southwell, J.G. Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, July, 1971 pp146-151 Both branches were closed in 1990, but the main line through Karoonda remains open as the Loxton railway line and was converted from broad gauge to standard gauge. Lowaldie The Lowaldie railway station was east of Karoonda and also had a small town surveyed, with a school and post office operating for some time. These have all closed, and the former institute building is used as a private residence. The station was originally named Lowalde in 1913, but when the town was proclaimed in 1914, the spelling used was Lowaldie. The name is derived from a Ngarrindjeri word meaning summer.

History The station opened in 1888 and was electrified in 1935.Kent Rail, http://kentrail.org.uk/ore.htm  Services  Ore station is the terminus for electric East Coastway services. Trains run regularly to and beyond (the usual termini for trains from Ore being either or ). In May 2018, an hourly direct service to/from Ashford was reintroduced after a gap of nearly 13 years. Ore station was once adjoined to the north by a depot for electric trains but this closed in May 1986 following the electrification of the Hastings to Tonbridge line and relocation of electric units for servicing and cleaning to St Leonards depot. Today, there are two platforms linked by a footbridge. Ore station has been unstaffed since a booking office fire in the late 1980s, and it has no other facilities. There is limited road access via Ore Valley Road (off Hughenden Road), but this station is not recommended for people with physical disabilities. The area has in the past been a hotspot for vandalism but is now covered comprehensively by CCTV. It is scheduled for a major re- development. There has been some debate as to whether the station should be renamed Hastings East or Ore Valley. Trains terminating and restarting at this station run forward into a turnaround siding which runs adjacent to the Marshlink line as far as Ore Tunnel. Ore is also the start of the single track section on the Marshlink line, which runs through to Appledore. All off-peak services at Ore are operated by Southern. As of May 2019, the typical off-peak service in trains per hour is: * 1 tph to London Victoria via * 1 tph to (semi-fast) * 1 tph to (stopping) * 1 tph to During the peak periods, there are additional trains operated by Southeastern that terminate here. There are 2 northbound trains in the morning peak (1 runs to London Charing Cross and 1 runs to London Cannon Street) and 1 southbound train from London Cannon Street that terminates here in the evening peak. Southeastern initially planned to cease serving Ore from the May 2020 timetable change. However, as of May 2020, they continue to operate three Monday-Friday peak services from the station.

It is on the Marshlink Line, and train services are provided by Southern. It was originally known as Three Oaks & Guestling. History The railway line between Ashford and was opened by the South Eastern Railway in 1851, but originally there were no stations between and Hastings. opened in 1888, and with the introduction of steam railmotor services between and Hastings, three halts were opened between Winchelsea and Ore on 1 July 1907: ; ; and Three Oaks Bridge Halt. The latter station has been renamed four times: in 1909 it became Three Oaks Halt; later on it became Three Oaks and Guestling Halt; on 5 May 1969 Three Oaks and Guestling; finally on 12 May 1980 the present name of Three Oaks was adopted. Description The station has a single platform from which trains depart to Ashford International and Eastbourne via Hastings. The line was singled in 1979, with all trains using the one-time westbound platform, the eastbound platform remaining in situ, albeit in a decaying state. The platform can only accommodate a single carriage, meaning that passengers wishing to disembark must travel in the front carriage of the train. There is a ticket issuing facility accepting card payments available here and a customer help point with on screen customer information. Centrally located in Three Oaks village, the service from this station was limited to only three or four trains a day in each direction, at inconvenient times, for a number of years. This has been increased to a two hourly service in each direction to Ashford and Brighton from December 2010. This followed an active campaign by Three Oaks and Winchelsea Action for Rail Transport (THWART) and the Marshlink Line Action Group (MLAG), and it is hoped that this development will drive-up usage, which has historically been very low. Until May 2018, southbound services ran as express services to Brighton , but this was discontinued and changed to a Eastbourne stopping service, due to long journey times and lack of rolling stock, which caused overcrowding, especially between Brighton and Eastbourne.

The brainchild of Sir Reginald Bray, the Council Learned was introduced in 1495 to defend Henry's position as a feudal landlord, maintain the King's revenue and exploit his prerogative rights. It dealt with the king's fiscal matters and enforced payments of debts. It proved to be much more efficient than the Exchequer. The council was a secondary department to the Star Chamber, but it was the Council Learned in Law that made the system of bonds and recognisances work so effectively. Following Bray's death in 1503, he was replaced with Edmund Dudley. Dudley, along with Empson, formed a feared combination of able bureaucrats who raised the extraction of money from the King's associates into a fine art and created many enemies amongst key advisors of the King. By the end of Henry VII's reign, the Council Learned had become very unpopular, and after his death in 1509, it was abolished. Its most prominent councilors, Edmund Dudley and Sir Richard Empson, were imprisoned. Though evidence was scarce, both were convicted of treason, attainted and executed in 1510. The downfall of the pair brought rejoicing in the streets. There is much controversy about the Council Learned in the Law because most existing sources date after 1509 when it had been officially condemned. Bray's associate, Empson, maintained a particularly ruthless approach that seemed to define the behavior of the Council. In the Tower, Dudley confessed to having issued harsher penalties than lawful in several cases, a statement which has given the Council a strongly negative connotation. It bypassed the normal legal system since it was not a court and those summoned had no chance of appeal. It was an expression of the King's will and as such was as important for maintaining authority as it was for raising finances.

Biography Daughter of Catalan-Jewish immigrants who moved to Cuba, her father was a tailor and her mother was a seamstress. Olga Guillot was born in Santiago de Cuba, and her family moved to Havana, Cuba when she was five years old. As a teenager, she and her sister, Ana Luisa, performed as the \\"Duo Hermanitas Guillot.\\" It wasn't until 1945 that her talent as a bolero singer was discovered, when Facundo Rivero, an influential man in the Cuban music scene of the era, heard her sing for the first time and helped her make her professional singing debut at a famous Havana night club. Soon after, Guillot met Miguelito Vald√©s, who took her to New York City, where Guillot was able to record her first album with the Decca label. She first achieved international fame in the United States with her version in Spanish of \\"Stormy Weather\\" in 1946. Guillot traveled to Mexico in 1948. There, she established herself as an international singer and actress, appearing in various films and making her second album. In Mexico, Guillot began to enjoy much popularity for the first time in her career. In 1954, she recorded her song \\"Mi√©nteme\\" (\\"Lie to Me\\") by the Mexican composer Chamaco Dom√≠nguez, and which became a huge hit across Latin America and earned her three consecutive awards back home in Cuba as Cuba's best female singer. 1958 proved to be an important year for Guillot, as she toured Europe for the first time, performing in Italy, France, Spain and Germany. She sang alongside the legendary √âdith Piaf at a concert held in Cannes. Olga Guillot kept a house in Cuba as she traveled around the world, along with her house in Mexico. But Guillot opposed Fidel Castro's regime, and in 1962 she decided to leave Cuba for good and establish herself in Venezuela. Not long after that, she left Venezuela, making Mexico her only permanent country of residence. Meanwhile, she kept touring around the world, singing in places such as Israel, Japan and Hong Kong. In 1963, Guillot was given the Golden Palm Award as \\"best bolero singer of Latin America.\\" She received the award in Hollywood, California. Guillot sang in 1964 at New York's famed Carnegie Hall, becoming the first Latin artist to sing there. During her career, she performed alongside superstars of music such as Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughan, and her close friend and fellow Cuban exile, the great Celia Cruz. Guillot continued touring for the next forty years, releasing over fifty albums and winning numerous awards for her achievements in the music world. She was very good friends with Celia Cruz, whom she often referred to as \\"(her) sister\\". When Cruz died from cancer, Guillot was very bereaved over the loss of her close friend and compatriot. She was the godmother of singer Jos√© Jos√©. Guillot lived mainly in Mexico and had another home on Miami Beach, Florida. Death On July 12, 2010, she died of a heart attack at the age of 87 in the city of Miami Beach. She is survived by one daughter, Olga Maria Touzet-Guillot, born from her relationship with pianist and composer, Ren√© Touzet.

It was built in 1832 to commemorate Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater (1736‚Äì1803), known as the \\"Canal Duke\\". History Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater (1736‚Äì1803) Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater and 6th Earl of Bridgewater was a pioneer in the construction of canals during the early part of Industrial Revolution. In 1761 he opened the Bridgewater Canal in North West England to transport coal from his mines in Worsley to Manchester, later extending it to Runcorn, and then to Leigh. It is often said to be the first true canal in Britain, and earned him the nickname of \\"the Canal Duke\\". The monument is near the family seat Ashridge House in Hertfordshire, which the Duke neglected for many years and then decided to rebuild. Although he demolished the dilapidated house, he did not see through his ambitious plans as he died in 1803, leaving the ruins to his successor, John Egerton, 7th Earl of Bridgewater, who built a new house. The Canal Duke was buried in the family mausoleum in the Church of St Peter and St Paul in the village of Little Gaddesden, around east of the monument. A marble wall monument there commemorates his death. A memorial to the Duke was considered by his successor, the 7th Earl of Bridgewater, but it was not until the death of his brother, Francis Egerton, 8th Earl of Bridgewater in 1829 that funds were made available. The 8th Earl left in his will ¬£13,500 and instructions to build a monument to the Canal Duke. Construction At the time, Charlotte Catherine Anne, Countess of Bridgewater and widow of the 7th Earl was still in residence at Ashridge. She objected to the erection of an obelisk, which she considered to be poor taste, and at her behest, the monument to the Canal Duke was sited some distance from Ashridge House so as not to be seen. To build the monument, the family appointed Sir Jeffry Wyattville, the architect who also worked on the Gothic Revival house on the estate. In line with the countess's wishes, he altered the design to that of a Greek column.Birtchnell P, A History of Berkhamsted, 1972, Clunberry Press The Bridgewater Monument was designed by Wyattville in a Neoclassical style, consisting of a giant -tall fluted Greek Doric column, surmounted by a giant copper funerary urn finial. There are 172 steps inside, and the abacus provides a viewing platform. At the base, the large pedestal is inscribed with the words: Inside the entrance passage leading up to the staircase, there is a brass plate which records the instruction of the 8th Earl to erect the monument with the inscription: Although the waterway most closely associated with the deceased was the Bridgewater Canal, it is thought that the monument was erected to celebrate the construction of the Grand Junction Canal, which passes around south-west of the site. The Bridgewater Monument stands on Moneybury Hill, a protruding part of the Ashridge plateau, and overlooks the village of Aldbury. Visitor attraction Today the Bridgewater Monument, like the Ashridge Estate, is in the care of the National Trust. At weekends, the monument is open to visitors, who can climb 172 steps inside the column to enjoy views of Ashridge and the Chiltern Hills. It is also possible to see as far as Canary Wharf in central London.

Kolkata, formerly known as Calcutta in English, is the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal and is located in eastern India on the east bank of the River Hooghly. The city was a colonial city developed by the British East India Company and then by the British Empire. Kolkata was the capital of the British Indian empire until 1911 when the capital was relocated to Delhi. Kolkata grew rapidly in the 19th century to become the second city of the British Indian Empire. This was accompanied by the development of a culture that fused European philosophies with Indian tradition. Kolkata is also noted for its revolutionary history, ranging from the Indian struggle for independence to the leftist Naxalite and trade-union movements. Labelled the \\"Cultural Capital of India\\", \\"The City of Processions\\", \\"The City of Palaces\\", and the \\"City of Joy\\", Kolkata has also been home to prominent people such as, Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Rani Rashmoni, Amartya Sen, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Rabindranath Tagore, Keshub Chandra Sen, Jagadish Chandra Bose, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Sarada Devi, Swami Vivekananda, Sister Nivedita, Sri Aurobindo, Subhas Chandra Bose, Satyendra Nath Bose, Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri, Paramahansa Yogananda, Anil Kumar Gain, Kazi Nazrul Islam, Jibanananda Das, A.

Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600‚Äì1700)  There is a long chain of events behind the arrival of the East India Company in Bengal, specifically Job Charnock in Sutanuti in 1690. These incidents are documented in numerous records of the East India Company and by several authors [Bruce 1810 (Vol I and II), Marshman Vol I, Unknown 1829; see references below]. These documents tell the story of how the English were severely beaten and wiped out from Bengal several times by the forces of the Mughal Emperor and how each time they came back to Bengal to continue their trade. The agents of the East India Company first visited the provinces of Bengal and Bihar for trade during the period of Ibrahim Khan (ca 1617‚Äì1624), the Subahdar (Governor) of Bengal at the time of Mughal Emperor Jahangir. The first factory was established in Surat in 1620 and later in Agra, and agents were further sent from these places to the eastern provinces to examine the possibility of opening factories there. However the transportation costs and logistics were unfavorable and the plan was abandoned. In January 1644, the daughter of the Emperor was severely burnt and a doctor named Gabriel Boughton, formerly the surgeon of the East Indiaman Hopewell, was sent from Surat for her treatment. He was able to successfully treat her burns and in reward the Emperor allowed the company to establish factory at Pipili, Odisha, and for the first time English ships arrived at an eastern port. During 1638, Shah Jahan appointed his son Shah Shuja as the Subahdar of Bengal and Boughton visited the capital at Rajmahal where his services were again used to treat one of the ladies in the palace, and in return, the company was allowed to establish factories in Balasore, Odisha and Hooghly, Bengal in addition to Pipili, Odisha. Shaista Khan was appointed as the governor of Bengal in around 1664 by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and was relieved upon his request in around 1682. While he was returning to Delhi, Englishmen sent with him a request to the Emperor to obtain a special firman to do business forever in Bengal; the Emperor was pleased to provide them the Firman and the occasion was celebrated with a 300 gun salute at Hooghly. The investment in Bengal soared, the Bengal residency was separated from Madras and Mr. Hedges was appointed as the chief officer to oversee trade in Bengal. His residence in Hooghly was secured with soldiers obtained from Madras. This is the first time English soldiers came on the soil of Bengal. However, the Firman was vague in many aspects and soon disputes started to grow between the English and the governor. During this time a local disturbance occurred when the zamindar in Bihar attacked the governor of Bihar. Mr. Peacock, the chief of the factory in Patna, was imprisoned by the governor with the assumption that he was involved in the dispute. At the same time their saltpetre trade was disrupted by another rival English company. To protect their trade in Bengal, the original East India Company requested to build a fort in the mouth of Hooghly or on its banks. This request was immediately turned down by Shaista Khan and a 3.5% tax was imposed in addition to the already existing tax of 3,000 rupees, notwithstanding the Firman obtained earlier. Another incident with the Faujdar of Cossimbazar resulted in altercations between the Governor of Bengal and the company causing their ships to leave Bengal without obtaining cargo. Enraged with this situation and determined to establish their authority, the company requested King James II in 1685 to permit the use of force against the Emperor's army to settle the matter. Admiral Nicholson was sent with ships to attack the port at Chittagong, fortify it, make an alliance with the King of Arakan who was against the Mughals, establish a mint and collect revenue, thus making Chittagong a fort city for the Company in the eastern part. Then he was ordered to proceed to Dhaka. It was assumed that the governor would abandon the city and then a peace treaty would be offered which would guarantee free trade and other economic benefits for the Company and he would give up the territory of Dhaka and Chittagong. Job Charnock was then at Madras and was directed to join the expedition with 400 soldiers from the Madras division. Unfortunately the plan went awry; some of the ships, due to the change in current and wind, arrived at Hooghly instead of Chittagong and anchored off the factory in Hooghly after being joined by their Madras troops. The presence of a large number of war ships alarmed Shaista Khan and he immediately offered a truce. However the peace was broken again when some Company troops misbehaved with Shaista Khan's troops in Hooghly on 28 October 1686 for which the former were severely beaten by the latter. At the same time the admiral opened fire and burnt down 500 houses; property losses were about thirty lacs of rupees. However a truce was again obtained between Mr. Charnock and the local Foujidar, and the English were allowed to put saltpetre on board their ships. However, Shaista Khan upon hearing this ordered the closing and confiscation of all their factories and properties in Bengal and sent a large force to drive out the English from Hooghly. Upon hearing the news of Shaista Khan's plan, Mr. Charnock determined that it was no longer safe to remain in Hooghly and decided to move downstream to Sutanuti, a small hamlet on the banks of the river Hooghly on 20 December 1686. At this time their ships in Bengal required extensive repairs and the remainder of their fleet were considered in danger. In this situation they considered that they would be extremely fortunate if they could hold their current position instead of their desires on Chittagong and for this matter they decided to ask forgiveness from the Emperor and requested to reinstate the previously obtained Firman. Peace treaty was again offered by the governor at the end of December 1686 but it was mainly to buy out time for attack and by February 1687 a large troop of Shaista Khan's army arrived at Hooghly to drive the Company out of Bengal. Charnock decided it was not safe to remain in Sutanuti and moved to the island village at Hijli. There he remained with his soldiers in an utterly inhospitable place full of mosquitoes, snakes and tigers. The Governor's troops did not bother them there since they knew the Company would not be able to survive long there. In fact, within three months about half of Charnock's soldiers died and the remaining half were ready to be hospitalized. With his back to the wall, Charnock was desperately willing to negotiate with Shaista Khan to get out of this mess. Luck favored him because of an unexpected event. At the time when Nicholson was ordered to proceed to Chittagong, Sir John Child was ordered to withdraw the company's establishment from Bombay, commence hostilities on the western coast, blockade Mughal harbors and attack their ships anywhere to be found. Emperor Aurangzeb wanted to reconcile with the Company to ensure uninterrupted voyage of pilgrims to Mecca and asked his governors to make terms with them. As a result, a peace treaty was signed between Shaista Khan and Charnock on 16 August 1687. Shaista Khan allowed them to remain in Bengal, however to be limited only to Uluberia, a small town on the bank of river Hooghly south of Sutanuti, where they were allowed to make a port and do business from there, but their war ships were strictly not allowed to enter Hooghly. Charnock arrived at Uluberia, started making a dock there, however soon started to dislike the place and wanted to return to Sutanuti. At this time the governor asked them to return and settle at Hooghly, ordered them not to build any structure at Sutanuti and asked Charnock to pay a large sum of money for compensation. While not in a position to fight against the Governor's troops, two Company agents were sent to Dhaka to plead to the governor to allow them to return to Sutanuti and build a fort there. At the same time, when the news of failure of Nicholson reached England, it was decided that until a fort was built on the bank of the river, the English would never be able to do business with ease and would always be on the mercy of the forces of the governor. For this, Captain Heath was sent to Bengal with 160 soldiers either to fight and win against the forces of the governor or to bring back all the properties of the company to Madras and abandon the trade in Bengal. Captain Heath arrived in October 1688 in Bengal, took all of company persons on board, set sail to Balasore on 8 November 1688. He reached Balasore on 29 November, pounded and destroyed the town including their own factory and released some English prisoners from the Governor's prison. They left Balasore on 13 December for Chittagong, reached there on 17 December, found the Governor's fortification too strong to destroy and decided to wait until his demands are answered by the governor. However, instead of waiting for Governor's answer, Captain Heath set sail to Arakan, arrived there on 31 January 1689 and offered treaty to the king that English will fight against the Mughals at Dhaka and the king would provide them settlements in his dominion. When a fortnight passed without any answer from the king, Captain Heath, frustrated and dejected, returned to Madras on 4 March 1689. This was a total failure of English objectives in Bengal during the early period of 1689 which caused them abandoning Bengal as their trading location in eastern region. Emperor Aurangzeb, enraged with the situation that the Company fortified Madras, occupied territory around it, captured Mughal ships, went into alliance with his enemy Sambhaji, he ordered his commanders everywhere in India to exterminate Company from the country and seize their properties anywhere to be found. Warehouses in Visakhapatnam were destroyed and many English men were captured and put to death. Shaista Khan went after them in Dhaka, captured them and put them behind bars. Shaista Khan retired from his duty as governor in ca 1689 and Ibrahim Khan was appointed as the new governor of Bengal by Emperor Aurangzeb. By this time Aurangzeb was camping at Visapur and was much aware of the fact that he was losing revenues from the Company trade and the Company ships could cause him much trouble by stopping the pilgrimage to Mecca since they controlled the sea-route. At the same time, the Company were desperate to open negotiations with the Emperor after they left Bengal and Mr. Child was sent to him. He decided to accept the offer and ordered the Governor of Bengal to allow Company to return there. As a result, Ibrahim Khan invited Mr. Charnock back to Bengal; but Mr. Charnock refused to come back until a specific Firman with terms and conditions clearly specified was issued by the Emperor so that they would not be subjected to further humiliations. Ibrahim Khan again sent letter to Mr. Charnock explaining that he had requested for the special Firman from the Emperor and it would take a few months before it arrived, and in the meantime Mr. Charnock was welcome to settle in Bengal and the governor would pay him 80,000 rupees for the goods that have been destroyed by Shaista Khan's regime. With this friendly invitation, Mr. Job Charnock with 30 soldiers returned to Sutanuti on 24 August 1690 and hoisted the Company standard on the banks of river Hooghly, thus beginning a new era of Company involvement in Bengal. In the next year, Ibrahim Khan sent the order from the Emperor to Mr. Charnock which allowed unrestricted trade without paying any other taxes except the usual 3,000 rupees. Mr. Charnock died in January 1692. While the English were always looking for fortification of their factories in Bengal, Ibrahim Khan never allowed them to do so. In 1695 the town of Hooghly was seized by Sobha Singh along with an unknown Afghan Rahim Khan, and the English at Sutanuti requested from the governor to use their own armed protection for their factories when their factories were surrounded by the enemy. Ibrahim Khan allowed them to protect their own factories, but did not allow any fortification explicitly. However, in the absence of specific orders the permission to defend their property was taken as a permit to build fortress and construction began immediately overnight with all available manpower. The fort was built on the bank of river Hooghly at Sutanuti with mortar brought from Madras, completed in ca 1701 and was called Fort William after King William III of England. This was the old Fort William and construction for a new one (the present one) started after Siraj Ud-Daulah attacked Fort William in 1756. In 1690, Job Charnok, an agent of the East India Company chose this place for a British trade settlement. The site was carefully selected, being protected by the Hooghly River on the west, a creek to the north, and by salt lakes about two and a half miles to the east. There were three large villages along the east bank of the river Ganges, named, Sutanuti, Gobindapur and Kalikata. These three villages were bought by the British from the local land lords. The Mughal emperor granted East India Company freedom of trade in return for a yearly payment of 3,000 rupees.  Origins  = Name = The rent-roll of Akbar, the 16th century Mughal emperor, and the work of a Bengali poet, Bipradas Pipilai, of the late 15th century, both make mention of the city's early name's being Kolikata, from which Kolkata/Calcutta derive.Britannica entry There is much discussion about the origin of the city's name. The most accepted view is that it comes from the Hindu goddess Kali and the original name was KaliKshetra, \\"the place of Kali\\". Other theories include: * The name comes from the location of the original settlement beside a khal (\\"canal\\" in Bengali) * The place was known for its manufacture of shell-lime, the name deriving from kali (\\"lime\\") and kata (\\"burnt shell\\") * The name is derived from the Bengali kilkila (\\"flat area\\"), which is mentioned in the old literature.Calcuttaweb article * The name came into being when Job Charnock asked a farmer the name of the area around Hooghly River. The farmer misunderstood due to language problems and thought that he was referring as to when he harvested his paddy. He proudly replied \\"Kal Kaata hoe chhilo\\" meaning \\"I cut it yesterday.\\" Job Charnock thought that the name of the place is Calcutta. The area where the city is now located was originally inhabited by the people of three villages: Kalikata, Sutanuti and Gobindapur. However, the boundaries of the three villages gradually became less distinct, and before the battle of Plassey, the city could be divided into four different sub- areas: European Kolkata (Dihi Kolkata); a residential village with some sacred spots (Gobindapur); a traditional Indian market (Bazar Kalikata or Burrabazar); and a riverine mart concentrating on cloth trade (Sutanati).Mukerji, Dr. S.C. 1991. The Changing Face of Calcutta: An Architectural Approach. Government of West Bengal After the battle of Plassey in 1757, the Company started rebuilding the city. The Calcutta High Court ruled in 2003 that Job Charnock, the Englishman generally believed to be the founder of the Calcutta, is not the founder of the city and that hence Kolkata has no birthday. According to the Court, the city has its genesis in the Maurya and Gupta period and it was an established trading post long before the Slave Dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughals, the Portuguese, the French or the East India Company established a modern township there. The East India Company chose the place for a trade settlement. In 1698, the Company bought three villages (Sutanuti, Kalikata and Gobindapur) from a local landlord family of Sabarna Roy Choudhury. The next year, the company began developing the city as a Presidency City. In 1727, on the order of King George I, a civil court was set up in the city. The Calcutta Municipal corporation (now renamed Kolkata Municipal Corporation) was formed and the city had its first mayor. = Journey from British rule to independence = The three villages, in particular Kalikata, where Calcutta is located, came into the possession of the British East India Company in 1690 and some scholars like to date its beginnings as a major city from the construction of Fort William by the British in 1698, though this is debated (see the court ruling in \\"Name and origins\\" above). From 1772 to 1911, Calcutta was the capital of British India. From 1912 to India's Independence in 1947, it was the capital of all of Bengal. After Independence, Calcutta remained the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal. = The fall of Calcutta to Siraj ud-Daula = When the Seven Years' War broke out, owing to their constant rivalry with the French, and the fall of Madras to the forces of Dupleix, early in 1756 the British authorities in Calcutta began repairs to the fortifications of old Fort William, which were extremely decayed. This irritated the new Nawab of Bengal, Siraj Ud Daulah, who viewed it as a threat to his sovereignty. Enraged still further when the British granted asylum to one Krishnaballav, who had embezzled money from the dewani of Dhaka, Siraj ud-Daula first attacked and captured Cossimbazar (taking as hostage William Watts and Begum Johnson), and then Calcutta, which fell after a short siege on 20 June 1756, during which the governor and many other officials escaped down the Hooghly River, leaving the remainder of the garrison and the Eurasian population of Calcutta to their fate. This is now known as the Siege of Calcutta. It is said that 123 Britons later died in the Black Hole of Calcutta after his victory, but recent evidence calls into question the numbers involved, and suggests that the Nawab himself was probably unaware of what transpired. He renamed Calcutta Alinagar after the previous Nawab, and his maternal grandfather, Alivardi Khan. Having installed Manikchand as the ruler of Alinagar, Siraj returned to Murshidabad. Soon (on 2 January 1757) Watson and Robert Clive retook Calcutta with a force of company sepoys and the assistance of the Royal Navy. Hearing the news, Siraj ud-Daula moved to attack Calcutta, but fearing an attack from Ahmad Shah Abdali, after a few days of war he signed the Treaty of Alinagar with the East India Company, giving them permission to build the fort. Although Siraj ud- Daula conceded temporary defeat in the Pact of Alinagar, he once again began scheming with the French against the British. Meanwhile, the Third Carnatic War was starting in the south. Also at this time, nobles such as Jagat Seth, Mir Jafar, Rai Durlav, Omichand and Rajballav were plotting against Siraj ud- Daula (a principal reason being the Nawab's arrogance, well attested to in contemporary sources)Ghulam Husain Salim Riyazu-s-Salatin. A History of Bengal Ed. & Trans. Maulavi Abdus Salam (Calcutta: Baptist Mission Press) 1902 Fasc. IV and they invited Clive to take part in their plans. Clive seized on this plan to get rid of two enemies at once. Citing non-existent reasons, he attacked Murshidabad, having previously reached an agreement with Mir Jafar to install him on the musnud of Bengal. On the fateful day of 23 June 1757, 23 miles away from Murshidabad in the mango groves of Palashi, the armies met at the Battle of Plassey. The British army consisted of 800 European soldiers and 2,200 Indian soldiers, while the Nawab's army was made up of 18,000 cavalry and 50,000 infantry. At the start of this seemingly impossible battle, generals Rai Durlav and Iar Latif held their armies together, but in an act of treachery Mir Jafar led his troops away from the battlefield, and the remaining army led by Mirmadan and Mohanlal was defeated. Siraj ud-Daula escaped but was later caught and killed by Miran, the son of Mir Jafar. Mir Jafar was made the new Nawab, and the British had effectively seized control of Bengal. In 1765, after defeating the next Nawab, Mir Qasim, the Nawab of Oudh and the Mughal Emperor at the Battle of Buxar, there was no one to stand in the way of the British and their dominance in North India. Thus, British imperialism began in India with the conquest of Bengal, a game in which a main pawn was the great city of Calcutta. Calcutta also had an indirect but important influence on the battles of the Carnatic Wars. When Madras fell to Dupleix, the British were still able to direct the war from another of their strongholds, Calcutta. They also used the wealth of Bengal to defeat the French. As Dr. R. C. Majumdar stated in An Advanced History of India, \\"The Battle of Plassey may be truly said to have decided the fate of the French in India.\\"  British India  =Churches= St. John's Church, originally a cathedral, was among the first public buildings erected by the East India Company after Kolkata became the effective capital of Company rule in India. It is located at the North-Western corner of Raj Bhavan, and served as the Anglican Cathedral of Calcutta till 1847, when the see was transferred to St. Paul's Cathedral. Construction of the building, modelled on St Martin-in-the- Fields of London, started in 1784, with Rs 30,000 raised through a public lottery, and was completed in 1787. It is the third oldest church in the city, next to the Armenian and the Old Mission Church.Roy, Nishitranjan,Swasato Kolkata Ingrej Amaler Sthapathya, , pp. 24, 1st edition, 1988, Prtikhan Press Pvt. Ltd. = 18th century scandals = One of the most notorious incidents of the latter part of the century was the trial and execution of Nanda Kumar, who had been the governor of Hugging in 1756. In 1764 he had been appointed collector of Burdwan in place of Warren Hastings, which resulted in a long- standing enmity between the two men. In 1775, when Hastings was Governor- General, Nanda Kumar brought accusations of corruption against him, accusing him of accepting bribes and other abuses of power. These were taken up with enthusiasm by Hastings' rivals on the Governor General's Council, led by Philip Francis. Whilst this matter was still awaiting investigation Nanda Kumar was indicted for forgery of a deed, condemned and executed. There was a strong suspicion that the charges had been invented by Hastings, and that he had put pressure on the judges to pass sentence of death. At this date it was far from clear whether or not English law applied in Calcutta, and it was extremely rare for the death penalty to be applied for forgery even in England. Furthermore, Nanda Kumar was a Brahman, and his hanging caused widespread dismay and outrage in Calcutta.The Memoirs of William Hickey (London: Hurst & Blackett) Vol.II (1918) pp154-5 Warren Hastings and Sir Elijah Impey, the Chief Justice, were both impeached, and were accused by Edmund Burke and afterwards by Thomas Babington Macaulay of committing a judicial murder.H.E. Busteed Echoes of Old Calcutta (Calcutta) 1908 pp73-106; H. Beveridge The Trial of Nanda Kumar Five years after this incident, in 1780, relations between Warren Hastings and Philip Francis deteriorated to such an extent that the two fought a duel in the grounds of Belvedere (now the National Library) on the road to the suburb of Alipore. Francis was severely wounded, but Hastings escaped unscathed.Busteed Old Calcutta pp107-117 = Opium trade = After the territorial conquest of Bengal in 1757, the British East India Company pursued a monopoly on production and export of opium from India. The company bought opium from local traders and later directly from farmers, and sold it at auction in Calcutta. From there much of it was smuggled to Canton in China by foreign traders, eventually leading to the First Opium War (18391842).  Social and intellectual life in the 18th century  In 1772, Calcutta became the capital of British India, a decision made by Governor General Warren Hastings. On 29 January 1780, Hickey's Bengal Gazette or the Calcutta General Advertiser became the first newspaper to be printed in India, and is an invaluable chronicle of the social life of Anglo- Indian society in Calcutta. Contemporary memoirs such as those of William Hickey record the consumption of enormous meals, washed down by copious quantities of claret, port, madeira and other wines, followed by the smoking of Hookahs.The Memoirs of William Hickey (London: Hurst & Blackett) Vol.II (1918) pp136-7 Vol. III (1923) pp205-6, 234‚Äì5; Percival Spear The Nabobs (Delhi: OUP) 1998 p36 After the death of his English wife, Charlotte, (who is buried in Park Street Cemetery) Hickey married a Bengali girl called Jemdanee, who died in childbirth in 1796, prompting him to write in his journal that \\"Thus did I lose as gentle and affectionately attached a girl as ever man was blessed with\\".Memoirs of William Hickey (London: Hurst & Blackett) Vol. IV (1925) p141 Such unions between Europeans, English, French and Portuguese, and local women, both Hindu and Muslim, were common throughout the 18th century in Calcutta, and are the origin of the city's substantial Anglo-Indian (or Eurasian) community today: by the early 19th century, however, increasing racial intolerance made marriages of this kind much rarer. Calcutta's intellectual life received a great boost in 1784 with the foundation of the Asiatic Society of Bengal by Sir William Jones, with the encouragement of Warren Hastings, himself no mean Oriental scholar. Jones worked closely with the pandits of the Kalighat Temple, together with the local ulema, in translating and producing new editions of rare and forgotten texts. His study of Sanskrit with Pandit Ramlochan at Nadiya led him to posit the existence of the Indo-European family of languages. Many distinguished scholars, English and Bengali, such as Henry Thomas Colebrooke, James Prinsep and Pandit Radhakanta Sarman would grace the society's meetings and publications over the following century, vastly enriching knowledge of India's culture and past.O.P. Kejariwal The Asiatic Society of Bengal and the Discovery of India's past (Delhi: OUP) 1988 pp29-75 Calcutta saw the establishment of several different Western-style higher education institutions this period, including Sanskrit College (1824), Calcutta Medical College (1835), University of Calcutta (1857), Surendranath College (1885) and the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (1887), India's first research institute. = The Baboo/Babu Culture and the Bengal Renaissance = In the time of British India, Calcutta was regarded as \\"the second city of the British Empire\\" (after London) and was aptly renamed \\"City of Palaces\\" and the Great Eastern Hotel was regarded as the \\"Jewel of the East\\". Calcutta at that time was famous for its \\"Baboo Culture\\", a mixture of English Liberalism, European fin de siecle decadence, Mughal conservatism, and indigenous revivalism, inculcating aspects of socio-moral and political change. This culture was fostered in its wake by the Zamindari system, the Dayabhaga System the Hindu Joint Family System, the Mitakshara System, the Muslim Zenana System, the Protestant spirit of free capitalist enterprise, the Mughal-inspired feudal system and the Nautch. This also fostered the Bengal Renaissance, an awakening of modern liberal thinking in 19th century Bengal, and which gradually percolated to the rest of India. = Growth = In 1750, Calcutta had a population of 120,000. The centre of company control over the whole of Bengal from 1757, Calcutta underwent rapid industrial growth from the 1850s, especially in the textile sector, despite the poverty of the surrounding region. Trade with other nations also grew. For example, the first U.S. merchant ship arrived in Kolkata in 1787. In fact, the U.S Consulate in Calcutta is the U.S. Department of State's second-oldest consulate and dates from 19 November 1792. Despite being almost totally destroyed by a cyclone, in which 60,000 died, on 5 October 1864, Calcutta grew, mostly in an unplanned way, in the next 150 years from 117,000 to 1,098,000 inhabitants (including suburbs), and now has a metropolitan population of approximately 14.6 million.  Contribution to the independence movement of India  Historically, Calcutta was the centre of activity in the early stages of the national movement of independence. Exactly a hundred years after the fall of Bengal in the Battle of Plassey, Calcutta saw the beginning of what is often called the First Independence Movement of India. It is also just as often as not referred to as a War of Independence, and as one historian put it, \\"The so called First National War of Independence was neither First, nor National, nor a War of Independence\\". In the suburbs of Calcutta, at the Barrackpore military barracks, sepoy Mangal Pandey sparked off a huge revolt that shook the foundations of the British Empire. This movement is sometimes also called the Indian Mutiny, although recent evidence goes against using this name and suggests \\"The Revolt of 1857\\" as a better and less controversial choice. In 1883, Surendranath Banerjea organised a national conference ‚Äì the first of its kind in 19th century India. This conference heralded the birth of The Indian National Congress. The first native president of the Indian National Congress was Sir Womesh Chunder Bonnerjee and he was also the first Congress president to advocate self-rule by Indians, Sir Surendra Nath Banerjea (referred to by the British as \\"Surrender Not\\") were early eminent Calcuttans, who provoked and influenced nationalist thinking in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Other societies based on nationalist or religious thoughts were started, like the Hindu Mela. Revolutionary organisations like the Jugantar and the Anushilan Samiti were formed with the goal of using force against the British rulers. Among early nationalist leaders, the most prominent were Sri Aurobindo, Indira devi Chaudhurani, Bipin Chandra Pal. The early nationalists were inspired by Swami Vivekananda, the foremost disciple of the Hindu mystic Sri Ramakrishna and helped by Sister Nivedita, disciple of the former. The rousing cry that awakened India's soul was penned by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. Now the national song of the nation, it is an ode to the land of Bharat (India) as the Divine Mother, \\"Vande Mataram.\\" The Elgin Road residence of Subhas Chandra Bose in Calcutta was the place from where he escaped the British to reach Germany during the Second World War. He was the co-founder of the Indian National Army and the head of state of the Arzi Hukumate Azad Hind, formed to counter and combat the British Raj in India. Renamed Netaji by poet laureate Rabindranath Tagore, he is regarded by many as perhaps the most prominent and influential freedom fighter in Indian history and is venerated in many Bengali households even today. Muslims were also involved in the nationalist movement, most notably Fazl Huq who from Calcutta in the 1930s attempted to organise a non-communal peasant party to agitate against the British and the wealthy Indian landowning class. The fact that many of the Hindus in this latter group were linked to the local Congress organisation and dominated the mainstream nationalist movement in Bengal from Calcutta led to attempts to thwart Huq's activities and fed into the tragic decline in communal relations that savaged Calcutta in 1946 and 1947 (see Kenneth McPherson, \\"The Muslim Microcosm: the Muslims of Calcutta 1918‚Äì1935\\", Steiner, Wiesbaden, 1973).  After Independence  Slum in Calcutta, 1986 The intense violence caused during the partition of India led to a shift in demographics in Bengal, and especially Kolkata; large numbers of Muslims left for East Pakistan, while hundreds of thousands of Hindus arrived to take their place. Kolkata received millions of refugees from what became East Pakistan without receiving substantial assistance from the central government.Trillin, Calvin. \\"Last Days of the Rickshaw.\\" National Geographic. Volume 213, Number 4. April 2008. 95‚Äì97. Over the 1960s and 1970s, severe power shortages, strife in labour relations (including strikes by workers and lockouts by employers) and a militant Marxist-Maoist movement who sometimes used violence and property destruction as tactics of protest ‚Äî the Naxalites ‚Äî damaged much of the city's infrastructure, leading to economic stagnation. (Ironically, this is the same city that has historically been a strong base of Indian communism: West Bengal was ruled by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) dominated Left Front for nearly three decades ‚Äî the world's longest-running democratically elected communist government.) In 1971, the war between India and Pakistan led to another massive influx of refugees from the former East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), and their settling in Calcutta massively strained its already damaged infrastructure.Trillin, Calvin. \\"Last Days of the Rickshaw.\\" National Geographic. Volume 213, Number 4. April 2008. 97. In the mid-1980s, Bombay overtook Calcutta as India's most populous city. Calcutta became plagued by power outages, labor unrest, disappearing industry, and violence from the Naxalite movement. In 1985 Rajiv Gandhi referred to Calcutta as a \\"dying city\\" because of the social and political traumas.\\"From Poorhouse to Powerhouse.\\" Spiegel Online. The city's economic recovery gathered momentum after economic reforms in India introduced by the central government in the mid-1990s. Since 2000, Information Technology (IT) services revitalized the city's stagnant economy. The city has also experienced a growth in the manufacturing sector. Following similar moves elsewhere in the country, the state government changed the city's official name from Calcutta to Kolkata in 2001.

It is on the Marshlink line, and train services are provided by Southern. The station is very isolated and serves only a handful of houses in the immediate area. History The station opened as Guestling Halt on 1 July 1907 after the South Eastern and Chatham Railway had introduced a steam railcar service on the line in order to improve traffic. It was one of the few places along the line between Hastings and that could access the railway by a public road. The station was renamed Doleham Halt in 1909 as Guestling was more conveniently accessed from the previous station, . By 1913, the station was being served by ten rail cars a day. This dropped to about seven per day in the inter-war period. The \\"halt\\" suffix was dropped on 5 May 1969. The station had two platforms until 1979 when the line through the station was singled; as a result, all trains now use the former \\"up\\" (Ashford-bound) platform. Services Owing to low patronage, the station is only served by a handful of trains each way, with no services at all during the off-peak period.Train Times - Southern Railway Most services call at the station on weekdays. In the morning, there are three southbound trains to , of which two continue through to , and one northbound train to . There is one train to Ashford during the afternoon peak, and one train each way (to Hastings and Ashford) in the late evening. This gives a total of three daily services northbound and four services southbound on a weekday. At weekends, there is only one train each way in the morning and one each way in the evening. Prior to December 2005, the station used to be served by hourly services between Ashford and Hastings. The frequency of stops was reduced when these services were extended to run through to Brighton, due to low patronage, a desire to reduce journeys times on the route through to Brighton, and a need to maintain schedules on the single-track section between Appledore and Ore. There is an ongoing local campaign which seeks to restore regular services to this station, as well as neighbouring stations at Three Oaks and Winchelsea. In 2011, a local newspaper observed that because of the inconvenient stops and lack of access, Doleham could be technically interpreted as the most crime- ridden station in Sussex as there was one reported crime for every 473 passengers. By comparison, the more likely candidate, , only recorded one crime per 43,873 passengers.

Reed beds are part of a succession from young reeds colonising open water or wet ground through a gradation of increasingly dry ground. As reed beds age, they build up a considerable litter layer that eventually rises above the water level and that ultimately provides opportunities for scrub or woodland invasion. Artificial reed beds are used to remove pollutants from grey water. Does Botanical Diversity in Sewage Treatment Reed Beds Enhance Invertebrate Diversity? Types Reed beds vary in the species that they can support, depending upon water levels within the wetland system, climate, seasonal variations, and the nutrient status and salinity of the water. Reed swamps have 20 cm or more of surface water during the summer and often have high invertebrate and bird species use. Reed fens have water levels at or below the surface during the summer and are often more botanically complex. Reeds and similar plants do not generally grow in very acidic water; so, in these situations, reed beds are replaced by bogs and vegetation such as poor fen. Although common reeds are characteristic of reed beds, not all vegetation dominated by this species is characteristic of reed beds. It also commonly occurs in unmanaged, damp grassland and as an understorey in certain types of damp woodland. Wildlife Most European reed beds mainly comprise Phragmites australis but also include many other tall monocotyledons adapted to growing in wet conditions - other grasses such as reed sweet-grass (Glyceria maxima), Canary reed-grass (Phalaris arundinacea) and small-reed (Calamagrostis species), large sedges (species of Carex, Scirpus, Schoenoplectus, Cladium and related genera), yellow flag iris (Iris pseudacorus), reed-mace (\\"bulrush\\" - Typha species), water-plantains (Alisma species), and flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus). Many dicotyledons also occur, such as water mint (Mentha aquatica), gipsywort (Lycopus europaeus), skull-cap (Scutellaria species), touch-me-not balsam (Impatiens noli-tangere), brooklime (Veronica beccabunga) and water forget-me-nots (Myosotis species). Many animals are adapted to living in and around reed-beds. These include mammals such as Eurasian otter, European beaver, water vole, Eurasian harvest mouse and water shrew, and birds such as great bittern, purple heron, European spoonbill, water rail (and other rails), purple gallinule, marsh harrier, various warblers (reed warbler, sedge warbler etc.), bearded reedling and reed bunting. A previously sandy shore colonised by reeds forming a reed bed. Uses =Constructed wetlands= Constructed wetlands are artificial swamps (sometimes called reed fields) using reed or other marshland plants to form part of small-scale sewage treatment systems. Water trickling through the reed bed is cleaned by microorganisms living on the root system and in the litter. These organisms utilize the sewage for growth nutrients, resulting in a clean effluent. The process is very similar to aerobic conventional sewage treatment, as the same organisms are used, except that conventional treatment systems require artificial aeration. =Treatment ponds= Reed bed of Harchies ponds Belgium Treatment ponds are small versions of constructed wetlands which uses reed beds or other marshland plants to form an even smaller water treatment system. Similar to constructed wetlands, water trickling through the reed bed is cleaned by microorganisms living on the root system and in the litter. Treatment ponds are used for the water treatment of a single house or a small neighbourhood.

It is about from Winchelsea and is actually in the neighbouring parish of Udimore. It is on the Marshlink line north east of Hastings, and train services are provided by Southern. The station originally had two platforms, but in 1979, the line was singled and only the up platform is now in use. The former down platform and station building are now converted to a private house. Location Winchelsea station, August 1982 The station is in an isolated location. It is not a convenient way of getting to or from Winchelsea, especially outside daylight hours. The route involves walking down an unlit and winding country lane and then climbing a steep hill, walking along the A259 trunk road, which does not have a pavement. The journey takes about 15 minutes. As an alternative, Stagecoach bus route 100 runs from and stops in the town. Being isolated and given the limited stopping service, it is little used other than by walkers visiting the Brede Valley. Local people may book a free lift to and from the station via a voluntary scheme run through Winchelsea Farm Kitchen. Facilities The buildings have been sold into private ownership and so this station is unstaffed. There is a ticket machine at the station. Free parking facilities are available at the station. History The station was opened by the South Eastern Railway (SER) on 13 February 1851 as one of the first stations on the line from Ashford to Hastings, along with , and . The station, like several others on the line, was built with staggered platforms on the belief that it would be safer for passengers to cross the railway behind a departing train. Traffic was very sparse and the station closed on 1 September, in part because it was impossible to access the town without crossing private land. The Mayor of Winchelsea campaigned for reopening and negotiating access with the respective landowner, and the SER agreed to open the station on 4 December. A resignalling programme took place in the early 1890s. The station gradually reduced its facilities. In 1961, the station building was sold off, and has since been in private hands. By 1969, the signal box and goods siding had been removed, and by the early 1970s the shelter canopy was removed and the post of crossing keeper was discontinued. On 1 October 1979, the line was reduced to single track to reduce operational costs. The down platform (to Hastings) was removed; since then all trains have stopped at the one remaining platform. A speed limit was imposed on the line approaching Winchelsea. The wooden shelter on the remaining (up) platform was replaced by a conventional modern shelter in 1984. Local campaign groups Three Oaks and Winchelsea Action for Rail Transport (THWART) and the Marshlink Action Group (MLAG) campaigned for services to be increased, and from December 2010 a two-hourly service in each direction was restored. In 2015, trains began stopping at the station on Sundays, after a ten-year campaign. Services There is a two-hourly service to Winchelsea with trains to Eastbourne and Ashford International. Station stops are usually shared in each alternate hour with Three Oaks making it difficult to travel directly between these two stations. Until May 2018, southbound services ran as express services to Brighton, but this service was discontinued and a stopping service to Eastbourne was introduced, due to long journey times and lack of rolling stock, which caused overcrowding, especially between Brighton and Eastbourne.

He served in state government in two capacities, from 1979 to 1982 representing the 17th district, and from 1983 to 1993 representing the 20th district. From January 1994 until January 2006 he served as mayor of Pittsburgh. Murphy is currently the senior resident fellow for urban development at the Urban Land Institute. Early life The son of a steel worker, his education includes graduation from John Carroll University in Cleveland in 1967 and receiving a graduate degree from Hunter College in urban studies in 1973. From 1970 to 1972, Murphy and his wife, Mona, were in the Peace Corps in rural Paraguay, constructing sanitation facilities and an elementary school. After the Peace Corps, the Murphys returned to Pittsburgh and he became a neighborhood organizer for the North Side before entering local politics. Early political career Murphy served as a state representative from the 17th district from January 2, 1979 until November 30, 1982. He also served in the same capacity representing Pittsburgh's North Side 20th Legislative District from January 4, 1983 to December 15, 1993. In 1989 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic primary nomination for mayor of Pittsburgh, losing to Sophie Masloff (who ran unopposed in the November general election later that year). In 1991 he and two other state legislators spearheaded reforms at the regional Pittsburgh industrial corporation, stressing that the agency needed more minority and female representation in its leadership, that the agency was not focusing on urban redevelopment so much as suburban properties, and that it was awarding grants to financial institutions instead of for industrial concerns. As mayor Murphy was elected the mayor of Pittsburgh in November 1993 and was sworn-in in January 1994. He used his educational background in urban management and administration, to function more like a city manager than a politician. He initiated a public-partnership strategy that leveraged approximately $4.5 billion in economic development in Pittsburgh. Against public opposition, he secured $1 billion (along with Allegheny County Commissioners Bob Cranmer and Mike Dawida) in funding for the development of Heinz Field, PNC Park, and a new David L. Lawrence Convention Center that in 2003 would become the largest certified \\"green\\" building in the United States. The combined leadership of Commissioners Cranmer and Dawida with Mayor Murphy led to a building boom in Pittsburgh dubbed \\"Renaissance III\\" that was a catalyst for how the city would be viewed a decade later, when it was selected to host the 2009 G-20 summit, led by President Barack Obama. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette commented in 1998 that \\"Allegheny County Commissioners Bob Cranmer and Mike Dawida understand the importance of a strong urban core and, through their partnership, have helped the mayor find ways to do what lesser leadership would considerable unthinkable... It is a meeting of such focused minds and willing spirits that stands to take Pittsburgh into a new era.

He also lured, using public subsidies, both Lazarus and Lord & Taylor department stores to the city's downtown core. Both stores eventually failed, however, each closing within a decade. The idea of big box retail along the city's downtown core of Fifth and Forbes Avenue actually goes back two administrations to the Caliguri mayoralship in 1987.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rcpRAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=1m0DAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1445%2C3707425 Murphy also led the development of more than 25 miles of new riverfront trails and urban green space. \\"Big idea\\" initiatives such as these, combined with the commonwealth-imposed century-old restrictions on annexing any suburbs or consolidating with the county for a \\"regional\\" or \\"metropolitan\\" tax base to equitably spread costs to commuters and urban dwellers alike and drove the city to the brink of bankruptcy. Several initiatives to modernize the state- controlled regional tax and government structure to reflect the rapid growth of nonprofit universities, hospitals, churches, and parks within the city limits with the rapid population migration out of the city to formerly rural suburbs and counties all failed to be approved by the state. The city eventually was declared financially \\"distressed\\" by the state after blocking all annexations, county-consolidations, nonprofit hospital or university tax levees, and commuter or suburban tax balances.City is declared distressed ‚Äì Pittsburgh Tribune-Review To help recoup some of the city's losses during this period and to highlight the state's refusal to allow the city to grow geographically as the region's population had, with annexing or consolidating modern suburbs, Murphy was forced into the controversial 2003 decision to lay off a number of city employees, including Pittsburgh Police officers. Some of these jobs were later saved by dramatically increasing the city's parking tax as one of the few \\"commuter\\"-\\"suburban\\" taxes within the city's power to levy without state power to block, making it the largest such tax in the country. While at the time, the parking tax was met with ridicule and contempt, it has presently been analyzed as one of the key factors in rejuvenating the downtown core, while encouraging the growth of rapid transit, bike lanes and trails, and \\"green alternatives\\", and while providing a fiscal foundation for the city for decades to come. In light of the comparable city of Detroit's devolution into bankruptcy, Murphy's parking tax and its effects on both the fiscal health and downtown vitality in business and mass transit has become a case study in effective core city management.http://dc.streetsblog.org/2013/08/23/pittsburgh-vs-detroit-a-case- study-in-parking-contrasts/http://nullspace2.blogspot.com/2013/08/wwjjd.html Catherine Knoll, Tom Murphy (center), and Governor Ed Rendell at a political event Murphy's dealings with the city firefighters union also has been questioned. Prior to the 2001 mayoral election, Murphy allegedly signed the firefighters to a new contract worth $10‚Äì12 million with a no-layoff clause in exchange for their vote. He would go on to narrowly defeat then City Council President Bob O'Connor (who later would become mayor). In 2004, Murphy announced that he would not run for re-election. In June 2006, Murphy entered into an agreement with federal government to avoid prosecution from his involvement with the firefighters union.Murphy makes deal ‚Äì Pittsburgh Tribune-Review While being considered a man with big ideas, Murphy's political skills were questioned later in his tenure as some of his policies slowly wore out relationships with the Pittsburgh City Council and the increasingly Republican and rural-focused commonwealth legislature. Impatience in working with the opposition-held Pennsylvania General Assembly late in his career, harmed the city's image in some state political circles. Praised as a visionary, but not as a politician, his tough choices after the city's budget crisis in 2003 resulted in a citizen group unsuccessfully proposing his impeachment. In 1999, Murphy served on the selection committee for the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence. Murphy was one of Pennsylvania's presidential electors in 2000, casting his vote in favor of Al Gore. = Murphy's mayoral election history = * 1993 race results ** Tom Murphy (D), 66% ** Kathy Matta (R), 14% * 1997 race results ** Tom Murphy (D), 77% ** Harry Frost (R), 21% * 2001 race results ** Tom Murphy (D), 74% ** James Carmine (R), 23% Post-political life Since leaving City Hall, Murphy and his wife continue to live in their self-restored, 150-year-old farmhouse in North Side of Pittsburgh, where they raised their two daughters, Shannon and Molly, and their son, T.J.

In cell biology, it is most commonly described as the region between the inner membrane and the outer membrane of a mitochondrion or a chloroplast. It also refers to the space between the inner and outer nuclear membranes of the nuclear envelope, but is often called the perinuclear space. The IMS of mitochondria plays a crucial role in coordinating a variety of cellular activities, such as regulation of respiration and metabolic functions. Unlike the IMS of the mitochondria, the IMS of the chloroplast does not seem to have any obvious function. Intermembrane space of mitochondria Mitochondria are surrounded by two membranes; the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. These two membranes allow the formation of two aqueous compartments, which are the intermembrane space (IMS) and the matrix. Channel proteins called porins in the outer membrane allow free diffusion of ions and small proteins about 5000 daltons or less into the IMS. This makes the IMS chemically equivalent to the cytosol regarding the small molecules it contains. By contrast, specific transport proteins are required to transport ions and other small molecules across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the matrix due to its impermeability. The IMS also contains many enzymes that use the ATP moving out of the matrix to phosphorylate other nucleotides and proteins that initiate apoptosis. = Translocation = Most of proteins destined for the mitochondrial matrix are synthesized as precursors in the cytosol and are imported into the mitochondria by the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) and the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM). The IMS is involved in the mitochondrial protein translocation. The precursor proteins called small TIM chaperones which are hexameric complexes are located in the IMS and they bind hydrophobic precursor proteins and delivery the precursors to the TIM. Electron transport chain and intermembrane space of a mitochondrion = Oxidative phosphorylation = The pyruvate generated by glycolysis and the fatty acids produced by breakdown of fats enter the mitochondrial IMS through the porins in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Then they are transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the matrix and converted into the acetyl CoA to enter the citric acid cycle.Apoptotic components released from the intermembrane space of a mitochondrion The respiratory chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane carries out oxidative phosphorylation. Three enzyme complexes are responsible for the electron transport: NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I), ubiquinone-cytochrome c oxidoreductase complex (complex III), and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV). The protons are pumped from the mitochondrial matrix to the IMS by these respiratory complexes. As a result, an electrochemical gradient is generated, which is combined by forces due to a H+ gradient (pH gradient) and a voltage gradient (membrane potential). The pH in the IMS is about 0.7 unit lower than the one in the matrix and the membrane potential of the IMS side becomes more positively charged than the matrix side. This electrochemical gradient from the IMS to the matrix is used to drive the synthesis of ATP in the mitochondria. = Apoptosis = Releasing of cytochrome c from the IMS to the cytosol activates procaspases and triggers a caspase cascade leading to apoptosis. Intermembrane space of chloroplasts Simplified structure of a chloroplastThe intermembrane space (IMS) of the chloroplast is exceedingly small, from 10-20 nm thick. Unlike the IMS of the mitochondria, the IMS of the chloroplast does not seem to have any obvious function. The translocase of the outer membrane (TOC) and the translocase of the inner membrane (TIC) mainly assist the translocation of chloroplast precursor proteins Chaperone involvement in the IMS has been proposed but still remains uncertain.The eukaryotic Hsp70, which is the heat shock protein of 70 kDa, typically localized in the cytoplasm is also found in the IMS of chloroplasts. The resulting hypothesis states that co-localization of Hsp70 is important for efficient translocation of protein precursors into and across the IMS of chloroplasts.  Intermembrane space of nuclear envelopes  Simplified structure of an eukaryotic cell nucleus The nuclear envelope is composed of two lipid bilayer membranes that are penetrated by nuclear pores and separated by a small intermembrane space, which is often called the perinuclear space. The perinuclear space is usually about 20-40 nm wide. The perinuclear translocation of certain proteins and enzymes were studied and results showed that perinuclear space was important for genome integrity and gene regulation.

It is on the Marshlink line between and and is the principal station between those two terminals. The station is a passing place between two single track sections. Services are provided by Southern, usually between and Ashford with an additional shuttle from Rye to Ashford at peak times. A station at Rye was first planned in the early 1840s, though on a different route to what was opened. It was built by the South Eastern Railway as the central station on the line from Hastings to Ashford, opening in 1851. Despite recommendation for closure in the 1963 Beeching Report, it has remained open because of poor quality road connections. The station building was designed by William Tress; it was Grade II listed in 1980, while an 1894 signal box was listed in 2013. Location The station is to the north of the town centre, between two level crossings. There are two platforms, one for trains to Ashford and the other for Hastings. The line is double track through the station providing a passing loop for trains on the Marshlink line, which is single track between and . The staggered platforms are linked by footbridge. There is a waiting room on Platform 2 (Hastings bound). Stagecoach Group bus routes 70, 100, 101, 102, 292, 293, 312, 313, 326, 342 and 553 serve the station. History =Background= View of Platform 1 (Ashford-bound) from the footbridge A station at Rye was proposed in April 1840, when the Tenterden, Rye & Hastings Branch Railway planned a line from the South Eastern main line near Smarden to Hastings via Tenterden and Rye. At the time, harbour duties were not charged at Rye, making it a suitable port for goods traffic. The following year, it was estimated a single-track line from the South Eastern main line to Hastings via Rye could be built for ¬£250,000 (¬£ in ). The company attempted to negotiate construction with the South Eastern Railway (SER), who thought the route was a poor choice and preferred to reach Hastings from via . In 1844, the SER became concerned that the Brighton, Lewes & Hastings Railway (BLHR) would extend its line beyond Hastings to Rye and Ashford. A compromise was reached whereby the BLHR was granted permission to build the line with an option for the SER to take over if necessary. The River Rother to the east of Rye was still navigable and required a moveable crossing. Peter W. Barlow designed a swing-bridge to carry the line over the river. Both this bridge and the one over the River Tillingham to the west required approach ramps on an otherwise flat stretch of railway. The SER's contract stipulated that the company should contribute ¬£10,000 (¬£ as of ) towards improving Rye Harbour, and Robert Stephenson recommended a branch line for goods traffic. This was constructed west of the station and the River Tillingham, running to the harbour pier on the opposite side of the river to the town. The branch line never carried passengers and has been demolished. =Opening= The first train to Rye ran on 28 October 1850, before the line had been fully completed. The Mayor of London travelled from to Rye via Ashford and gave a short speech at the station. It opened on 13 February 1851, along with stations at , Appledore and . A coal stage opened in 1854, and new goods sidings were added in 1874. In 1859, a proposal was made to link Rye with Folkestone via Lydd and Dymchurch. The SER declined to finance the line. In 1864, the Weald of Kent Railway proposed building a line from to (and hence to Rye) via Tenterden. The scheme was cancelled two years later. =Post-opening= Marshlink trains are scheduled to pass at Rye The swing bridge to the east of the station over the River Rother was replaced by a fixed bridge in 1903. A footbridge was installed across the staggered platforms at the station in 1960, in preparation for the Kent electrification scheme Phase 2 of the British Railways Modernisation Plan, which provisionally included the line through Rye. The line was recommended to be closed in the 1963 Beeching Report, but because of poor road connections, it remained open along with its stations. The prolonged threat of closure left the station unmodernised and gaslit well into the 1970s. On 1 October 1979, the Marshlink line either side of Rye was reduced to single track, leaving a passing loop at the station. Though done for economic reasons, the decision has been criticised as it has turned Rye station into a bottleneck. The station was Grade II listed in April 1980 owing to its \\"special architectural or historic interest\\". The goods shed, which was closed in 1963, was demolished in 1984. Buildings The station's signal box, opposite Platform 2 (Hastings-bound) Construction of the station building began in 1847. It was designed by William Tress in symmetric Italianate style of two storeys with an attic in red brick with a slate roof and set of gateless gate pillars. As Rye was planned to be a more significant stop than Appledore or Winchelsea, it was designed to be bigger than those. Tress also designed a goods shed in a similar style, sited alongside the main station building. Several SER stations were retrofitted with signals on the line in the early 1890s. The box at Rye was built in 1894 using a Saxby & Farmer Type 12 design. It retains its original 1888 pattern Duplex frame, though the original 30-lever manual signals were replaced by coloured lights on 1 October 1979. The ground floor is constructed of Flemish bond brown brick, the first floor is made of timber with weatherboard cladding and it has a slate roof. The signal box was Grade II listed in 2013 as it is one of only two of its type still standing in good condition. In 2019, it was repainted and refurbished. Services Class 171 Turbostar DMU number 171729 on a Brighton service The typical off-peak service is one train per hour to Eastbourne via Hastings and one train per hour to . At peak times an Ashford to Rye shuttle also operates, so that between 6am and 9am two extra trains operate towards Ashford International and the wider network of services available there, along with three in the reverse direction. In the evening two additional services between Rye and Ashford operate between 5:30 pm and 7 pm. In May 2018, the Southern service to Brighton was discontinued, owing to its slow journey time and lack of rolling stock. Since then, trains have only run as far as Eastbourne. There have been several proposals to integrate the Marshlink line with High Speed 1 at Ashford, which would allow a direct connection between Rye and , with estimated times of less than an hour (down from 85 minutes). In 2018, Network Rail announced a fast service from St Pancras to Hastings would stop at Rye, and could be implemented by 2024. However, the date remains uncertain despite support from Amber Rudd, a former Member of Parliament for Hastings and Rye.

Career She joined King's College London in 2014 after accepting the inaugural Peter Sowerby Chair in Philosophy and Medicine. Previously, Roush was an assistant professor at the Department of Philosophy at Rice University (1999‚Äì2006). She was then an associate professor and then a full professor of philosophy at U. C. Berkeley. Starting winter quarter 2018, she is professor of philosophy at UCLA. Philosophy Her book Tracking Truth presents a unified treatment of knowledge, evidence, and epistemological realism and anti-realism about science, based on the idea that knowing is responsiveness to the way the world is, and that this is an ability to follow the truth through time and changing circumstances. Responsiveness is defined for empirical knowledge by a reformulation of Robert Nozick‚Äôs tracking conditions‚Äîfor example: if p were false, then S wouldn't believe p‚Äîusing conditional probability instead of counterfactuals. Roush argues that the new tracking view is superior to other externalist views of knowledge, including process reliabilism. Of particular interest are the new view's fallibilist account of knowledge of logical truth, its treatment of reflective knowledge and lottery propositions, its solutions to the value problem and the generality problem, its implications about skepticism, and its explanation of why knowledge is power in the Baconian sense. In the second half of the book it is argued that the tracking theory of evidence is best formulated and defended as a confirmation theory based on the Likelihood Ratio. The tracking theories of knowledge and evidence thereby fit together to provide a deep explanation of why having better evidence makes you more likely to know. Finally, the book argues that confirmation theory is relevant to debates about scientific realism, and defends a position intermediate between realism and anti-realism on the basis of a view about what having evidence requires.

It is on the Marshlink line, and train services are provided by Southern. The station was constructed in 1851 by the South Eastern Railway and designed by William Tress. It became a junction station in 1881 when a branch line opened to Lydd and New Romney; this closed to passengers in 1967 following the Beeching Report, though the line remains open for goods traffic to Dungeness Nuclear Power Station. Despite a recommendation in the report that Appledore should also close, it has remained open into the 21st century. Name and location A train stopping at Appledore, showing the staggered platforms According to National Rail, this station's official name is Appledore (Kent), despite the other Appledore station in Devon having closed in 1917. On official documents and railway company websites, the station is referred to as Appledore (Kent), although signs at the station simply list 'Appledore'. The station is located almost two miles from Appledore village and south of , on the B2080, a local road. Owing to its distance from the village, it is in the Parish of Kenardington, not Appledore. Appledore is just north of a junction of a freight branch line running to Dungeness nuclear power station via Lydd. Appledore is also the start of the single track section of the Marshlink line, which runs through to Ore near Hastings with a passing loop at Rye. Along with several other stations on the line, the platforms are staggered. When British Rail introduced widespread provision of enamel totem station signs Appledore was one of very few that had some wooden ones fitted. Shows a photo of a wooden sign from Appledore station. History The station was first proposed by the South Eastern Railway (SER) in June 1848 as a stop on the Ashford to Hastings line. That September, hop planters near Appledore petitioned the early construction of the line to help with harvest; however a formal decision to build a station was not taken until June 1850. The station was designed, along with others along the line, by William Tress. The main building was built in an Italianate style with red brick with a Welsh slate roof. It opened, along with the rest of the line on 13 February 1851. A pub, the Man of Kent Railway Tavern was built in 1853 on the opposite side of the road (now the B2080). It was rebuilt adjacent to the station in the late 19th century. A waiting room was built in 1894, followed by a goods shed in 1896 and a station master's house the following year. In 1881, Appledore was upgraded to become a junction station to cater for a branch line to Lydd, with new signals installed. The branch line opened on 7 December, and was further extended to New Romney in 1884. The station platforms were widened in June 1887 to accommodate longer trains. A line was also proposed from Appledore to , but this was never built. The SER subsequently merged with the London, Chatham and Dover Railway to form the South Eastern and Chatham Railway. It became part of the Southern Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The station then passed on to the Southern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. The goods shed was closed in 1963. Appledore ceased to be a junction station for passengers when the branch line to Lydd and New Romney closed in 1967. However, it continued to be used for goods traffic to Dungeness. When Sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Network SouthEast until the Privatisation of British Railways. In 2001, the station building and goods shed were Grade II listed. The main building is in good condition and has been largely unaltered since its original 1851 construction. Accidents and incidents *On 14 March 1980, an empty stock train comprising five Hastings Unit vehicles derailed due to excessive speed through a set of points. The driver was killed. A motor coach was consequently withdrawn from service due to extensive damage. *On 31 July 1989, 2H diesel-electric multiple unit 205 101 collided with a van on the level crossing. Services Trains run once an hour during the day in each direction, north to Ashford and south to Hastings and beyond to/from Eastbourne via Bexhill. Until May 2018, the southbound service ran as an express service to Brighton , but this was discontinued due to long journey times and lack of rolling stock, which frequently caused overcrowding, which was especially true between Brighton and Eastbourne. The rolling stock is Southern diesel Class 171 Turbostars, used on the non-electrified Marshlink route. APTIS was once provided here until the booking office closed in the very early 1990s leaving no ticketing facilities. In 2016 Southern installed a new self-service ticket machine. The office buildings on the Ashford-bound platform are unused.

The lights ran from 1919 until 1996, famous faces such as Roger Moore and Noel Edmonds and even the towns most famous son and his companion, Morecambe and Wise were called upon to switch the Illuminations on for each season. Although illuminations in there traditional way ended in 1996. Morecambe has continued to have Illumination activity. In 2016, Shrimping.It and the Exchange in the west end completed a project of over 30 illuminated pictures, displayed in Alexandra park with local residents.

Hilltown is the main village of the parish of Clonduff which contains the village and the rural areas around it at one end, and the rural enclave of Cabra at the other end of the parish. It had a population of 899 people in the 2001 Census. On 27 March 2011) the usually resident population of Hilltown was 1,709. Hilltown has eight public houses in the high street, a legacy from 18th century smugglers who shared out their contraband here. The village has a livestock market on alternate Saturdays, and a large sale of rams in September. The Georgian market house opposite St John's parish church (1766) adjoins the old inn, the Downshire Arms. The weathervane on the pretty cupola is a fish, a reminder of the good fishing in the River Bann and its tributaries. History Hilltown sprang up within the townland called Carcullin, later Carcullion (whose name is derived from the Irish Carr Cuilin). While many people think that Hilltown obtained its name from the fact that it spreads out over at least two hills, it was actually named after the Hill family and Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire. The Hill family were English politicians who also gave their name to nearby Hillhall and Hillsborough. He became Marquess of Downshire. He created a large house for his residence. The Hills founded the village in 1766 so that people living in the area could find employment in the linen industry. In early 1853 the constable in charge of the local Royal Irish Constabulary station, A Dunlop, exchanged posts with the constable in Rostrevor, A Morton. Morton remained in charge of the Hilltown station until after 1869.RIC List. Despite its early history, Hilltown has a very strong connection to Irish culture. Irish traditional music is quite popular, and GAA is the hub of the community. It is a strongly nationalist/republican village, as is Cabra and the surrounding rural areas that comprises the parish of Clonduff. Throughout the troubles, both had a small contingent of paramilitaries, mainly the Provisional Irish Republican Army.

Also known locally as The Lights or The Illuminations, they run each year for sixty-six days, from late August until early November at a time when most other English seaside resorts' seasons are coming to an end. They are long and use over one million bulbs. The display stretches along the Promenade from Starr Gate at the south end of the town to Bispham in the north. In 2013 the Illuminations were originally meant to shine from 30 August to 3 November. However, on 14 March 2013, it was announced that the festival had been extended by a week, shining until 10 November, making it the first time that the Illuminations ran for 73 consecutive days. This happened again in 2014 when they shone from 29 August to 9 November. The Illuminations have returned to shining for the regular 66 days since 2015. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, for the first time in the event's 141st year history, the 2020 Blackpool Illuminations display will be extended again, running from 4 September 2020 until 3 January 2021. This will mark the first year that the Illuminations have been operational over the winter holiday season, including Christmas and New Year. The organisers have committed to streaming 2020's Illuminations to internet users, which will feature Mel C virtually performing and 7 local heroes switching the Illuminations on. History The Illuminations were first shown in 1879 when they were described as 'Artificial sunshine', and consisted of just eight carbon arc lamps which bathed the Promenade. The original event preceded Thomas Edison's patent of the electric light bulb by twelve months. The first display similar to the modern-day displays was held in May 1912 to mark the first British Royal family visit to Blackpool when Princess Louise opened a new section of the Promenade, Princess Parade. The Promenade was decorated with what was described as \\"festoons of garland lamps\\" using about 10,000 light bulbs. The local Chamber of trade as well as other local businesses requested Blackpool Council to stage the event in September of the same year. The subsequent event was such a success that in 1913 the council were again asked to stage the Princess Parade lights as an end of season event. With the outbreak of the First World War there were no further displays until 1925 when the lights were again on display and extended to run from Manchester Square to Cocker Square. In 1932 animated tableaux were erected running along the cliffs from North Shore to Bispham, and the Illuminations were extended to its current length running from Starr Gate to Red Bank Road at Bispham. In 1935 the Mayor of Blackpool, Alderman George Whittaker was due to perform the Switch-on ceremony. When he met Railway Queen Audrey Mosson, 15, he was so impressed by her, he asked her to take his place. 50 years later, in 1985, Audrey was invited back to perform the ceremony alongside actress Joanna Lumley. The Illuminations were ready to shine in 1939 but the outbreak of the Second World War again interrupted the annual display and post war austerity meant the lights were not switched on again until 1949. Illuminations on Blackpool promenade Every year there is also the Festival of Light which features interactive installations and is described as being \\"a contemporary look at the concept of light and art working together to create entertainment\\". Other Uses The Blackpool Illuminations are sometimes used in households in the North of England to describe lights being left on. 'Turn the light off, it's like the Blackpool Illuminations in here!' Switch On Each year the opening night of the Illuminations, The Big Switch On, held in a specially erected arena with a celebrity pulling a switch to turn on the six miles of lights. The first switch on ceremony was held in 1934 when Lord Derby flicked the switch to turn on the Illuminations. In 1993 BBC Radio 1 first broadcast the switch on ceremony live when Status Quo were the guest celebrities, before in 1997 BBC Radio 2 started to cover it which continued until 2010, when GMG Radio, under its Real Radio and Smooth Radio brands took over the broadcasting of the switch on.GMG Radio Each year one main celebrity pulls the switch while there are performances in the Radio 2 arena with a pre- switch on concert featuring pop bands, singers and comedians. Modern-day Illuminations Most visitors drive through the Illuminations by car, coach or bus. There are also open top trams which run along the tramway as well as horse-drawn landau. At Bispham there is a special walkway for the tableaux which also includes mixed media in the various large tableaux displays. The Illuminations cost ¬£1.9M each year to stage. For the 2007 Illuminations, Interior designer and television personality Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen best known for his appearances on the BBC television programme, Changing Rooms was commissioned to create special feature on Central Promenade outside Blackpool Tower, named Decodance. Llewelyn-Bowen had stated that he fell in love with what he called \\"Blackpool's high-kicking glamour and historical reputation for giddy glitz\\" while filming for the Holiday programme. The displays at the cliffs from North Shore to Bispham contain forty large tableaux holding more than 5,000 square metres in surface area. There is a pedestrian walkway running the length of the tableaux displays which are set back from the Promenade beyond the tramway. Blackpool Tramway runs along the entire length of the Illuminations and there are over one million lamps in the display. In 2007 the Egyptian tableau which includes Egyptian sarcophagus, which eerily opens to reveal a mummified secret, returned after an overhaul. Also at Bispham on the clifftop was a new BBC Portal video screen. Also in 2007 a new Doctor Who display appeared with monsters from the last three series of the show. In January 2008, it was stated that this section had been the most successful feature ever built in the Illuminations. And at Gynn Square on Gynn Island, a Space Invasion with an opalescent mothership hovering more than 40 ft in the air, battling it out with eight spaceships arranged in formation defending their territory. The display which used colour-changing LEDs, was created from the popular alien craft which used to adorn the Promenade. In October 2007, a laser beam installed on the tower for the duration of the annual Illuminations was criticised by astronomer and presenter of The Sky at Night television programme, Patrick Moore who said, \\"Light pollution is a huge problem. I am not saying we should turn all the lights out, that is not practical, but there are some things which are very unnecessary. The Blackpool Tower light is certainly something I do not think we should be doing. I very much oppose it.\\" The beam could be seen 30 miles away. Moore called for the beam to be stopped. The Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston said the laser has added to a spiraling problem affecting astronomy. At the sixth annual Banquet and Ball on 9 January 2008, organised by the holiday trade umbrella group, Blackpool Combined Association, to raise funds for the Lights, the new Head of Illuminations, Michael Wilcock revealed new plans for the future of the Illuminations. These include, * Plans to make the Lights, which at present are funded 80% by Blackpool Council, as self-sustaining as possible, with plans to increase business sponsorship. * New, all year round, triumphal arches to be erected at either end of the Illuminations, \\"selling the Blackpool message.\\" * Extending the Doctor Who section for the 2008 season, \\"with eye-catching battles between Daleks and the TARDIS.\\" * Increased promotion for the 2008 Illuminations season. * Establishment of a Friends of the Illuminations group. =Blackpool Festival of Lights= Each year in conjunction with the Illuminations the Blackpool Festival of Light, a fusion of art and light events and installations, is staged. In 2007 the Festival started on 31 August with various lighting displays throughout the town with displays by artists and also Blackpool and The Fylde College. These included a mixed media display entitled \\"Donkey Fest\\" on the cliffs at North Shore, \\"Water is Everywhere\\" by Creatmosphere at the Water Tower in North Shore which was an architectural light projection depicting moving water reflections, animating and highlighting the Water Tower building. Also, \\"Hypodoch√©\\" by artist Ann Carragher, an expression of the artists personal relationship between life, natural processes, and the female 'space & voice' of architecture throughout the ages. The light installation consisted of water and light was exhibited at a town centre art gallery. Also there was the United Kingdom's first Illuminated Art Car Parade on 21 October as well as the return of the Honda Goldwing Light Parade. =Illuminated cars= Illuminated Western Train Tramcar There are a variety of rebuilt single deck cars, of different designs, all of which were rebuilt as illuminated theme trams. These run along the illuminated part of the Promenade during the Illuminations. A campaign by the local newspaper, the Blackpool Gazette in 2006 to get one of the Illuminated trams, Western Train, back on track, resulted in a ¬£278,000 Heritage Lottery Fund grant to restore the tramcar which first ran in 1962. It was withdrawn from service in 1999 and had stood derelict at the Rigby Road depot. The tramcar is due to return during the Illuminations Switch-On in 2008. In January 2008 it was revealed that another iconic illuminated tram, the Rocket tram, which had been in service between 1961 and 1999 but which had since then stood idle, is also due to be restored with expectation being that it would return to service for the Illuminations in 2009 at a cost of about ¬£150,000 and with the help of the Friends of the Illuminations group. =Construction and energy= It takes twenty two weeks for all the lights to be erected in time for the Switch on each year and nine weeks to dismantle them after the display has finished. Most of the display is now operated on low voltage (12 V and 24 V) and in 2003 the Illuminations cut electricity consumption by 11% using new technology. Then in 2004 wind turbines at the Solarium on New South Promenade contributed to powering the Illuminations for the first time. The Illuminations now only use green electricity from renewable resources, comprising wind power, small- scale hydropower and Biogas. The aim was for the display to be carbon neutral by 2010. =Friends of the Illuminations= In January 2008 Blackpool Council announced plans to start a Friends of the Illuminations stating that they saw the future of the Illuminations as being more interactive, and that \\"the group would help us shape the future of one of the country's best, free attractions.\\" and would also encourage worldwide support. =Blackpool Christmas Lights= Separate from the Illuminations, as part of the Festival of Light, Blackpool Christmas Lights are switched on every year in November in a very similar fashion to the Illuminations. They are located on various streets leading out of The Promenade. On Christmas Eve, and New Year's Eve, the Illuminations are switched on non-commercially to accompany the Christmas Lights.

In the overcrowded regions of Uttar Pradesh, many have resorted to bribing officials to have the owner of a plot of land declared deceased and the title transferred to their ownership. The process to undo this is long, arduous, as well as often inefficient and corrupt. The Association seeks to reverse the declarations, call attention to the problem and prevent others from being exploited in similar fashion. The founder and president is Lal Bihari, who was \\"dead\\" from 1976 to 1994 and used the word Mritak (, ) in his name during the period. History = Lal Bihari's problem = In 1976, 20-year-old Lal Bihari's application for loan from a bank in Azamgarh was denied, on the grounds that he was officially dead. He soon learned that his uncle had bribed a government official with ‚Çπ300 to have his nephew declared deceased, in order to inherit Lal Bihari's ancestral land holdings of about . Subsequently, Lal Bihari lost his home. = Formation = Lal Bihari was advised by legal counsel that such a case was very common in the area, and that having his death revoked would take years. To build momentum for the legal proceedings, he attempted to draw public attention to the case in a number of ways, including changing his name to Lal Bihari Mritak (mritak is the Hindi word for 'dead'). Bihari also insulted police and government officials, throwing pamphlets at them, trying to engage them in fights and kidnapping his uncle's child, to entice them into arresting him. (By arresting him, police and officials would have to acknowledge that he was living and hence would need to produce papers for that purpose.) He had his wife apply for widow's pension, which was denied. He also contested Indian general elections against Rajiv Gandhi and Vishwanath Pratap Singh. Another attempt he made was staging a mock funeral for himself. In 1994, the Azamargh district magistrate, Hausla Prasad Verma, declared him to be once again alive. Bihari did, however, allow his uncle to continue farming the land he had stolen. During these efforts, he attracted the attention of thousands of \\"dead\\" citizens across Uttar Pradesh. Bihari brought these people together with the creation of the Uttar Pradesh Mritak Sangh (Uttar Pradesh Association of Dead People). He admitted in 1999 that he did not know how many people were in the group, and it had no funds. His efforts earned him the IgNobel Prize in 2003.

The British gained a victory over the Americans and captured the village of Ogdensburg, New York. Although small in scale, it removed the American threat to British supply lines for the remainder of the war. Background When the war broke out, a flourishing illicit trade was soon established between Ogdensburg and Prescott, Upper Canada (later to become the province of Canada West in 1841), on the Northern side of the Saint Lawrence River. This was checked early in October 1812 when the Americans reinforced the militia with some of the regular 1st U.S. Rifle Regiment under Major Benjamin Forsyth. The British made an abortive attack with their own militia on October 3, which was quickly repulsed by the American forces in Ogdensburg, after which the militia dispersed. During the next few months, Forsyth's riflemen made several raids across the river, sniping at British troops and occasionally capturing boatloads of supplies on their way to Kingston, Ontario. On February 21, 1813, Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost, the British Governor General of Canada, passed through Prescott on his way to review the situation in Upper Canada, accompanied by several detachments of reinforcements. He appointed Lieutenant Colonel \\"Red George\\" MacDonell as commandant of British troops in Prescott and left him instructions that he was to attack Ogdensburg only if the Americans weakened their garrison. The reinforcements, although there temporarily, allowed MacDonnell to improvise. He planned for a company of the Glengarry Light Infantry, 70 militia and some light guns mounted on sleighs to make a frontal attack on the fort which housed Forsyth's riflemen. The main column, consisting of 120 men of the 8th (King's), 30 of the Royal Newfoundland Fencibles and 230 of the local militia flank companies, would cross the river lower down and attack from the flank. Battle Map of the Battle of Ogdensburg. The Americans were used to seeing British troops drilling on the frozen Saint Lawrence and were taken by surprise when they suddenly charged. The riflemen in the fort held out against the frontal attack, mainly because the British guns became stuck in snow drifts, and American artillery, under Adjutant Daniel W. Church of Colonel Benedict's regiment and Lieutenant Baird of Forsyth's company, fired on the British with mixed results. As the British main body threatened to surround them, they retreated and abandoned the town. The militia retreated back into the civilian population. The artillery under Church and Baird managed to put up a tough resistance until both Church and Baird were wounded. The British then took control of the town. The British burned the boats and schooners frozen into the ice, and they carried off artillery and military stores. There was some looting of private property, but some of the plundered goods were later returned. Casualties The British casualty return listed two British regulars, two Glengarry Light Infantry and two militiamen killed; 12 British regulars, 12 Glengarry Light Infantry and 20 militiamen wounded; for a total of six killed and 44 wounded. Lieutenant Colonel Macdonell reported that 20 Americans were killed and 70 captured, of whom many were wounded. An American account gave their loss as 26 killed and wounded and about 60 taken prisoner, a figure which suggests that only six of the wounded men escaped capture. Aftermath After the British withdrew, the Americans did not re-garrison Ogdensburg. The British were able to purchase supplies from Americans merchants there for the remainder of the war. The Ogdensburg area may have been populated by more Tories and Federalists than was previously thought. The normally cautious Prevost amended MacDonell's despatch to make it appear that the attack had been carried out on, rather than against, his orders. The regimental Chaplain of the Glengarry Light Infantry, Alexander Macdonell, is reputed to have accompanied the attack, wielding a crucifix to encourage lagging soldiers. He was supported by Presbyterian minister the Rev. John Bethune of Williamstown. Notes References * *Hitsman, J.

He is an alternative version of Captain America that appears in the Ultimate Marvel line of books. The character first appeared in The Ultimates #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer Mark Millar and artist Bryan Hitch (based upon the original version of the character by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby). Fictional character biography Steve Rogers grew up in Brooklyn during the Great Depression, a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend \\"Bucky\\" Barnes. Horrified by newsreel footage of the Nazis in Europe, Rogers was inspired to enlist in the Army around the time the United States entered World War II. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when Military Sergeant Dugan recruited him for Project: Rebirth after hearing Rogers' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by Doctor Erskine, Rogers became the first genetically- enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered Doctor Eskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart Gail Richards, becoming Captain America. For the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside James \\"Lucky Jim\\" Howlett. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate Arnim Zola's facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \\"Siegsoldat\\" (\\"Victory soldier\\"). The experiment's dead body then fell on Arnim Zola, seemingly killing him. During one of his few leaves he met up with Gail and they spent the night together, which would later result in her becoming pregnant. He would later come into battle with Herr Kleiser, who introduced a prototype A-Bomb that was made with alien technology meant to target the White House. However they were too late to stop the bomb from launching, but Captain America managed to get to the bomb as it is launched. In a successful attempt to stop it in mid air, he fell into the sea and was presumed dead. =The Ultimates= Years after, the body of Captain America was found in the Arctic Ocean frozen in a block of ice. It was as if he had not aged a day. It has yet to be revealed whether it was due to cryogenic preservation or the super soldier serum that prevented him from aging. Initially he thought S.H.I.E.L.D. were a group of Nazi soldiers who had captured him, but eventually realized that he was in a different time after seeing a modern New York City. He discovers that his best friend Bucky Barnes is now married to his fianc√©e and that all his loved ones are dead. After catching up to his new era, Captain America is inducted into the Ultimates, the superhero task force maintained by S.H.I.E.L.D. Soon after, the Ultimates are faced with the Hulk. Rogers was able to put down the Hulk briefly during combat. When he was about to inject the Hulk with an antidote, Hulk made a surprise attack and broke the needle and Hulk then began beating Cap, until Thor came to the rescue. After Hulk had reverted to Banner, Cap knocked him out and had him taken back to the Triskelion. After learning his teammates Hank and Janet Pym's quarrels with each other had left Janet hospitalized and nearly dead, Rogers tracked the now fugitive Hank Pym to a bar and engaged him in combat, emerging victorious. He then takes Janet flowers and other gifts afterwards, but she was not amused by his actions and rejected his gifts. Rogers soon discovered that his nemesis, Herr Kleiser had survived World War II and was an alien soldier. This was why he would always seem to survive, Cap saying that he has killed Kleiser \\"twice\\". When Kleiser resurfaced, Captain and he resumed their rivalry from 60 years back. During the Chitari invasion, Rogers fought Kleiser in combat, but was unable to defeat him due to his regenerate capabilities. When the Hulk was dropped into their battle, he convinced Hulk that Kleiser was \\"hitting on Betty\\", causing Hulk to mutilate and then eat Herr Kleiser ending Kleiser once and for all. After the successful battle against the Chitari, Rogers danced with Janet Pym and a relationship between them bloomed (though the relationship became sour as Rogers' 1940s personality created a generation gap between him and the Wasp, causing her to secretly go back to her ex-husband, although she never cheats him). =Ultimate War= During the events of Ultimate War, the Ultimates battle with the X-Men after Magneto was found alive and members of The Brotherhood of Mutants bombed the Brooklyn Bridge. S.H.I.E.L.D. believe the X-Men have teamed up with the Brotherhood. Captain America then vows that he will kill Magneto. Later the X-Men are framed to make it look like they teamed up with Magneto. The Ultimates with the support of numerous S.H.I.E.L.D agents succeed in capturing the X-Men and Professor Xavier is taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. =Ultimate Six= During the Ultimate Six story arc Captain America leads the Ultimates in the arrests of Electro and Kraven the Hunter. Later those two‚Äìalong with the Sandman, Doctor Octopus, and the Green Goblin‚Äîescape from S.H.I.E.L.D. He becomes very disheartened when he finds out that these villains were all a result of trying to duplicate the Super Soldier serum. During an attack on the White House lawn Captain America wrestled with Spider- Man with neither out-powering the other. He then explained the truth to Spider-Man that his aunt was safe with S.H.I.E.L.D. Captain America then fought the Green Goblin landing several hits while not being hit once. The Ultimates and Spider-Man defeat the five villains and they are taken back into custody. =The Ultimates 2= Cap and the Ultimates were later under fire from the press and public due to the belief that Thor had revealed that Bruce Banner was indeed the Hulk. In a meeting with Thor, Thor brought up the fact that Captain America killed many people and still goes to church, saying that he's confused with his morals. The Ultimates fought Thor and eventually captured him when his power belt was removed by Quicksilver. From then on the Ultimates became involved in foreign affairs wherein America attempted to control Third World countries' nuclear resources. The Ultimates' actions led to Third World countries forming their own superhuman team, dubbed \\"the Liberators\\". Captain America was framed by Black Widow for the assassination of Hawkeye's family and was hastily subdued and arrested when he was visiting Bucky for consolation after his relationship with Janet Pym ended bitterly for him. He was imprisoned in the Triskelion. When the Liberators attacked, he was freed by the Wasp and defeated multiple copies of the Schizoid Man rather than killing him while escaping the prison. He and the Wasp soon reached the White House where they met with Hawkeye, Nick Fury, the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. Captain dueled with his Liberators counterpart, The Colonel, and emerged victorious after stabbing the Colonel in the chest with one end of the double-bladed energy sword that the Colonel used. After the Liberators are defeated, Steven Rogers somberly looked over the Colonel's body being transferred away by S.H.I.E.L.D., and thought of what he said to him about America's current role in the world. Seeing how having the Ultimates working with the United States government \\"policing\\" the world would produce similar results to their battle against the Liberators, Rogers and his team decided to leave S.H.I.E.L.D. and to continue to work as an independent team instead. =Post Liberators= After the Liberators short occupation Captain America helped in the rebuilding of New York City until he found out that his old Nazi nemesis Arnim Zola did not die; instead the O.S.S. rescued him so as to harvest his intellect on the post-war super soldier program. Later they mapped his brain and created an artificial intelligence out of it before the tumors he had could degrade his mind. A white survivalist group called the \\"Marauders\\" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola's AI was being held and stole this intelligence, along with some other weaponry. Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the Falcon to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the \\"Marauders\\" to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola's AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest. He then took over the \\"Marauders\\" and got them to gather people for his experiments. Once they found the Marauder's camp Cap held off the marauders and Zola's new monster Seigsoldat-X while the Falcon freed the Prisoners. Together with the freed prisoners they tore apart Seigsoldat-X until all that remained was the Arnim Zola AI whereupon, Captain America collapsed a support strut onto the Zola AI, finally bringing an end to the Nazi. =The Ultimates 3= Before the events of the Liberators' attack, Steve befriended T'Challa, the Black Panther, and trained him in preparation for making him a member of the Ultimates. As the team's deputy leader, Rogers was uncomfortable with the notion of working with a man that he knew so little about. After Steve alarmingly discovered that T'Challa's throat was heavily damaged and that these injuries caused his muteness, he pressed Fury for more information. Fury lied about the origin of T'Challa's scars, and about T'Challa's history with the Weapon X Program, while also telling him that everything about the \\"Black Panther\\" was classified. Captain America eventually established a means of communicating with T'Challa and learned of the man's desire to return to Wakanda to see his father. Since no one but Cap had ever seen T'Challa's true face, he decided to take his place in the Ultimates, enabling the real Black Panther the chance to return home. Following the Ultimates' separation with S.H.I.E.L.D., Rogers secretly adopted the identity of the Black Panther. Eventually his secret was blown when Juggernaut literally beat Rogers' costume off of him. Iron Man and Wasp arrived with Cap's shield and uniform. He then led the Ultimates against their robotic doppelgangers. =Ultimatum= Captain America drowned when Magneto's Ultimatum Wave hit New York. While in Valhalla, Thor appeared to save the life of his love, Valkyrie, and traded his own life for Valkyrie and Steve Rogers. Cap then led a team of Ultimates, while Jean Grey led a team X-Men against Magneto and vowed to not let Thor's sacrifice be in vain. Magneto was defeated and the world began its rebel against mutants. =Post Ultimatum= Shortly after defeating Magneto, Captain America, Iron Man, and the military are searching for survivors in the ruins of New York City. Captain America finds a maskless Spider-Man in the rubble and digs him out. Later while the X-Men dig graves for the fallen, Sabretooth, Mystique, and Assemble arrive, claiming that they have come to pay their respects. However, Jean Grey blames them for the destruction, and a fight ensues. Captain America arrives, decapitating Assemble and stating that he also came to pay respect to the fallen X-Men. =The Red Skull and the Avengers= Months after Ultimatum, Captain America and Hawkeye fought a group of AIM terrorists at the Baxter Building who were stealing the building's valuable and powerful technologies. After defeating a majority of the terrorists, Cap encountered the Red Skull, who easily beat him. The Red Skull then shockingly revealed to Rogers that he was his own son before throwing him out of a helicopter, which Cap was saved by Hawkeye. After learning that the Red Skull's words to him were true and that his mother is Gail Richards, Captain America decided to personally confront his son, in which he abandoned the Ultimates and attacked S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in the process. Rogers later infiltrate the Army's computer database and discovered the truth of the Red Skull. Sometime later Captain America was in Paris, France for his own reasons. Rogers created a plot to which he would place Nick Fury's Ultimates, who were coming for him to capture him, with tracers, and allow him to later find his son, whom the Avengers were also in pursuit. Cap fought the Avengers, managing to defeat all of them. He was subsequently subdued and captured by the Avengers. However this was all a part of his plan to get to the Red Skull as during the fight Cap managed to place tracers on War Machine, Red Wasp, and Black Widow. Escaping the French S.H.I.E.L.D. guards, Cap jumped into a tele- plane (a jet which teleports), to where the Avengers were fighting the Red Skull, in Alaska. When he arrived, Red Skull, who was wielding the Cosmic Cube, subdued Rogers' jet. However, Cap ordered Hawkeye the coordinates for the Red Skull's position in which he had the jet teleport to the Red Skull and fatally impale his son on the tele-plane's nose. After the Red Skull was in custody, Rogers emotionally bear witness to Gail Richards to be briefly reunited with her dying son. =New Ultimates= Steve Rogers is currently a member of the New Ultimates, and helped Valkyrie, Zarda, Iron Man and Hawkeye fight off an attack from the Defenders, who managed to steal Thor's hammer before they retreated.Loeb, Jeph. Ultimate New Ultimates #1 - 5 (March 2010 - February 2011), Marvel Comics =Ultimate Captain America series= Rogers learns that the Captain America project was maintained after he was lost in World War II. A more aggressive successor was selected for USA operations during the Vietnam War. The \\"1960s Captain America\\" (named Frank Simpson) has returned and is not pleased with the return of the World War II Cap and seeks to make himself the only active Cap. Rather than kill Rogers, Simpson instead beats him to the point of collapse. Steve wakes up two days later in the French hospital where he is given a briefing by SHIELD Director Danvers about Simpson. Frank Simpson's background is similar to the circumstances of Steve Rogers. Swept up in nationalistic pride, he attempted to join the United States Army in order to serve overseas, but due to his original physical stature he is rejected. He is then inducted into a secret program similar to that of \\"Project: Rebirth\\". Due to the formula of the Super Soldier Serum having died with the death of Dr Abraham Erskine, he went through a painful combination of steroids as well as physical and psychological training in order to prepare for his assignment. Danvers reveals that originally, Simpson was overjoyed about serving his country and amassed a high enemy casualty count. But then the psychological pressure began to wear down on him and after an operation for the Phoenix Program he simply disappeared. Rogers, sensing that Carol told him this in order for him to make it look like he went AWOL, subdued Danvers and left to hunt down Frank Simpson. Once in Vietnam, Rogers' search for Simpson results in being told about a secret village deep in the Vietnamese forest. Unfortunately, the source of this news along with the rest of the village has a synthesis of the Super Soldier Serum via Simpson's blood flowing through them and Steve is captured and taken prisoner. Day after day he is physically and psychologically tortured and Simpsons attempts to brainwash him with anti-American diatribes. One day two S.H.I.E.L.D. employees sent to rescue Steve are captured and later executed because they are mistaken for assassins. Steve upon seeing this begins to pray and Simpson decides to indulge in his beliefs before executing him. The page then fades to black as Simpson enters to execute Steve, but with a sound of physical pain emanating from the prison cell. The sound of pain was the result of Frank screaming after having snake venom spat directly into his eyes from Steve. After a lengthy hand-to-hand fight with an argument about morality, Steve was able to emerge victorious over Simpson. Aware of the fact that he was surrounded by gun toting villagers with Super Soldier Serum flowing in their veins, he warns them that if they persisted in aiming to kill him, he will treat them as enemy combatants and show them no mercy. After the surrender of the villagers, a rescue by S.H.I.E.L.D., and some time to recuperate, Steve is seen having a beer with Hawkeye where he tells Hawkeye that he did not know if he would make it out of that jungle alive and it was God that sent him the cobra. Hawkeye intimates that the Devil is not a possibility Feeling the need to put Frank on the right path and to lead him on the right path, Rogers visits Simpson in the Triskelion where he is hospitalized under supervision and begins to read the Bible to him. Captain America is Gods righteous man. =Ultimate Comics Ultimates= Ultimate Cap is largely absent during the series of events initiated by Reed Richards, leading to the destruction of Washington and death of POTUS Barack Obama.Ultimate Comics Ultimates 01-12 He returns to assist new President Howard during the events of \\"Divided they Fall.\\" The US is on the brink of civil war as some States decide to leave the Union, and the legitimacy of President Howard is being put into question.Ultimate Comics Ultimates 13-14 Captain America takes on the role of being the President of the United States after being made a write-in candidate in Issue 16 and reunites the warring states of America.\\" =Return= When Maker collaborated with High Evolutionary to destroy the Superflow that kept the different universes separate in order to merge them into one reality, the Ultimates members Captain America, Iron Man, Giant-Man, Wasp, and Hulk were revived where they were to help Eternity fight the First Firmament.Ultimates 2 Vol. 2 #9 When Earth-616's version of the Ultimates arrived on Counter-Earth to confront Maker about his actions, he ordered the Earth-1610 Ultimates to attack.

Unlike his Earth 616 counterpart, however, Ultimate Captain America's physical attributes have been augmented to superhuman, rather than peak human, levels. On a number of occasions characters have described his strength as enhanced (Nick Fury described him as being able to bench press a Toyota). He has been shown bending steel with his bare hands, catching a tree heavy enough to crush a Jeep. He is also shown jumping large distances, and the Ultimate Red Skull, when he was fourteen and scientists said he had abilities comparable to his father, is shown running alongside a motorcycle. Captain America is also shown to have fast healing, while nowhere near as powerful as Wolverine and Sabretooth's, in \\"Blade vs the Ultimates\\" a remembrance by Cap shows scientists saying he can heal gunshots and knife wounds in hours. And Cap himself in Ultimates volume 1 says he should be able to heal broken bones in about a day or two.

Arguably the first recognised professional footballer, Suter was a native of Glasgow and played for Partick before moving to England to play for Darwen and Blackburn Rovers. Football Suter's first moves below the Scottish border into English football were with Partick, and on 1 January 1878 he played for them against Darwen at Barley Bank, and against Blackburn Rovers at Alexandra Meadows the following day. Towards the end of that year he began to play for the Lancashire club Darwen, following shortly after the arrival of fellow Partick player Jimmy Love. Although the game was officially amateur at the time, Suter's move to England to play for Darwen in 1878 was shortly followed by him giving up his job as a stonemason, allegedly claiming that English stone was too difficult to work and fuelling criticism that he was being paid to play. During the summer of 1880 he caused still more controversy by moving to Blackburn Rovers, a local rival of Darwen. The move again stirred up accusations of professionalism amid claims that Blackburn had offered him improved terms. Suter's move inflamed an already testy local rivalry, and bitter games and crowd trouble dogged future Darwen‚ÄìBlackburn matches for years. Suter's career was all but over by the time the Football League formed in 1888. He made only one appearance for Blackburn Rovers in that competition, on 22 December 1888 against West Bromwich Albion as a replacement for the goalkeeper Herbie Arthur. He appeared in four FA Cup finals and after Blackburn were runners-up to Old Etonians in 1882, he collected three winner's medals in 1884, 1885 and 1886.

Paulding (DD-238) was a Clemson-class destroyer in the United States Navy during the period between World War I and World War II. She was named for former Secretary of the Navy James Kirke Paulding. History James K. Paulding was laid down 31 July 1918 and launched 20 April 1920 by New York Shipbuilding Corporation; sponsored by Miss Mary Hubbard Paulding, great granddaughter of James K. Paulding; and commissioned 29 November 1920, Lieutenant H. W. Jackson in command. After shakedown James K. Paulding was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, and commenced tactical exercises with destroyer squadrons along the coast. She arrived at Newport, Rhode Island, 31 May 1921 for summer maneuvers and reserve training. Later that year she cruised to Charleston, South Carolina, for squadron exercises, and continued operations there until late winter 1922. James K. Paulding joined the Scouting Fleet January 1923 and throughout the year engaged in tactical war problems designed to maintain the fleet in the best possible fighting condition. She continued these operations in addition to reserve training until she sailed in February 1925 to San Diego, California for war problems in the Pacific. Upon her return to Newport 31 August, she resumed her duties with the Scouting Fleet. While engaging in gunnery exercises in Caribbean waters November 1926, James K. Paulding sailed to Nicaragua to protect American interests in the wake of political turmoil in that country. During March and April 1927 she remained off Nicaragua to prevent any smuggling of arms. For the remainder of her career James K. Paulding continued reserve training and tactical exercises in the Atlantic and Caribbean. During her service with the Navy she conducted peacekeeping operations, reserve training, and fleet problems all to maintain the United States' seapower, and provided a base upon which more powerful naval forces were built. Fate The destroyer arrived at The Philadelphia Navy Yard 31 October 1930, and decommissioned there 10 February 1931. She was reduced to a hulk 28 December 1936 in accordance with the provisions of the London treaty for the limitation and reduction of naval armament, scrapped, and struck from the Navy List 25 January 1937. As of 2005, no other ship of the US Navy has been named James K. Paulding. USS Paulding (DD-22) was named for Hiram Paulding.

The place-name 'Wrockwardine' is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as Recordine. It appears as Wroch Wurthin in 1169, and Wrocwurthin in 1196. The name means 'homestead by the Wrekin'.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.539.

Wrockwardine Hall stands by the church, on the north side. From the south are the Alms-Houses, and the Old School House, both now private houses. There is a more modern village school opposite the church, used until 2014 as a private nursery but has also been converted into private houses. On a small green to the north is an unusual war memorial consisting of a large boulder from the nearby Leaton Quarry. Another memorial, a brass plaque, is in the church. The Alms-Houses were built in 1841, for the maintenance of two poor women in declining years, and erected by tenants and neighbours in memory of Edward Cludde, \\"in testimony of their respect for a man who was an eminent example of pure and undefiled religion, visiting the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and keeping himself unspotted from the world.\\" Armorial Bearings Wrockwardine Parish Council adopted (assumed) armorial bearings at its meeting of December 12, 2018 (Minute 18/104) https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oqNDDJ0Va_fMTtlYOGo3BkDnlo_yD7T7 Blazon: Armorial bearings Vert, issuing from base a Saxon Church Or, and in chief two Fountains thereon a helmet with mantling Vert doubled Or and on a Wreath of the Liveries is set for Crest Issuing from a Mural Coronet an Owl Or perched upon a Gate Sable and in an Escrol below the achievement this Motto ‚ÄúServimus Ultro‚Äù.

It is of unusual plan in having a cruciform layout, with the tower at the cross-point rather than at the east or west end of the building. This dates from the 12th century, but the addition of The Cludde Chapel on the north transept at the end of the 14th century modifies this shape.\\"The Church and Parish of Wrockwardine, Shropshire\\"; Beryl Brown; 2004; booklet available in St Peter's Church. The building shows various evidences of its thousand-year history, beginning with the Norman features. These include a walled-up doorway suggestive of plans for future expansion.Brown, Op.Cit. An original Norman window in the Chancel was restored in the 19th century with stained glass depicting Holman Hunt's painting of Christ as The Light of the World. The church has several very fine stained glass windows. Some, like the one portraying St Peter, are miniatures at high level. Wrockwardine Church is a popular venue for weddings. A kitchen and disabled toilet has been built. Because of the Listed Building status, there were severe restrictions as to how this could be built. It was constructed in one corner, but no alteration to the existing walls was allowed, including for ventilation. This was covered by means of an ionisation air purifier. This method is widely used in Europe, but this is believed to be the first such use in Britain.A Church Warden in conversation (09/02/2009), who reported that English Heritage were interested to be able to suggest this method to other listed buildings. In 2015 a scheme of restoration and reordering was proposed. This will include repairs to stonework and roofs, upgrading of the heating system and the building of new community and meeting rooms. Work should begin in 2016. Funding will come from English Heritage and local fundraising. The church is equipped with an audio induction loop system installed as part of a customised sound system. Transport Wrockwardine is located between the B4394 and B5061 roads, and north of junction 7 of the M54 motorway/A5 dual carriageway. Wellington is located directly to the east, whilst Admaston is to the north.

History The Feelers was signed by Warner Music and released their first album, Supersystem. The album went to number 1 in New Zealand in September 1998, and became the second biggest selling album in the country that year. An instrumental version of single \\"Pressure Man\\" featured in 1999 American film Drop Dead Gorgeous during Kirsten Dunst's tap-dancing act. At the 1999 New Zealand Music Awards Supersystem won Album of the Year, Song Writer of the Year (James Reid), Band of the Year, and Producer of the Year (The Feelers and Malcolm Welsford). The band was also awarded the most played song on New Zealand Radio two years running, with \\"Supersystem\\" 1998 and \\"Venus\\" the following year. After extensive touring the band started work on their next album, recording demos with Des Broadbery (U2) before starting production with British producer Gil Norton.(The Pixies, Foo Fighters) Released in 2001, Communicate debuted at Number 1. The band's 2003 album Playground Battle was seen by the band as a new direction. Hitting the number 1 spot again, the album earned The Feelers their third award for the APRA most played song on New Zealand Radio, for \\"Stand Up\\". After further touring around Australasia, USA and Europe, the band started on their fourth album, One World. Released on 13 November 2006, the self-produced album debuted at number one on the New Zealand Album Charts, and also went Platinum in its first week of release, their fourth album to hit the number 1 slot. In July 2008, The Feelers played a sellout show at the Octagon in Dunedin before an All Blacks vs South Africa test match at Carisbrook. The band performed two new songs, \\"Beautiful Feeling\\" and \\"Narrow Lanes\\". That October The Feelers embarked on a national \\"Heartland\\" Tour, playing acoustic shows in 18 small towns away from the cities, as a way of saying thanks to those who had supported it over its first ten years. The Feelers released a greatest hits album entitled The Feelers: The Best: '98‚Äì'08 in November 2008, which contained 18 songs including two brand new tracks; \\"Beautiful Feeling\\" and \\"Whoever Said\\". In October 2009 the album earned The Feelers a Tui in the Vodafone New Zealand Music Awards for the highest selling album. In May 2009 The Feelers members announced that a new album was in production. In September they released details of a competition with MasterCard, where two winners would fly to the Cook Islands, and sing and appear in the video of their single \\"Blue Skies\\". In an interview with radio station The Rock FM from Rarotonga that October, The Feelers mentioned that the new album would not be released for several months, but the album did not appear. After extended delays, a new album was finally announced for release in August 2011. In November 2009, the Feelers announced an annual summer tour, adding an as yet unreleased song to the live gigs, \\"Open Up The Ground\\". In March 2010, the band released a cover version of Jesus Jones hit, \\"Right Here, Right Now\\", as the anthem to the 2011 Rugby World Cup advertising campaign. The New Zealand Herald wrote that the announcement had been \\"widely panned by New Zealanders posting on the social networking site Twitter\\", though the newspaper added that some had expressed relief that The Feelers had been chosen, over other Kiwi bands. In 2011, the band released the album Hope Nature Forgives. James Reid's brother is singer-songwriter Donald Reid. Matt Thomas' brother is Gareth Thomas, keyboardist in New Zealand band Goodshirt.

They have been acclaimed as having \\"gone the greatest lengths of anyone in their attempts to expand\\" the genre of folk metal. They are recognised as one of the founders of the genre of folk metal. With a specific focus on Celtic music and the use of Celtic mythology in their lyrics, Cruachan's style of folk metal is known as Celtic metal. The band named themselves after the archaeological site of Rathcroghan in Ireland also known as Cruachan. History Keith Fay had formed a Tolkien-inspired black metal band by the name of Minas Tirith in 1991. Around the same time, he began listening to more folk music and picked up Skyclad debut album The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth. Originally released in 1990, this \\"ambitious\\" and \\"groundbreaking\\" album made an impact on Fay and he set out to combine black metal with the folk music of Ireland. In 1992, Keith Fay formed Cruachan with a demo recording distributed in 1993. Keith Fay also credits the Irish rock band Horslips as a \\"huge influence on Cruachan,\\" further noting that \\"what they were doing in the 70's is the equivalent of what we do now.\\" Keith Fay, Ukraine 2014 The year 1995 saw the release of Cruachan's debut album Tuatha na Gael, an album that \\"suffered under poor production.\\" On the strength of this album, the band received attention from Century Media Records. The band found it amazing to receive interest from \\"such a big label\\" but were dismayed at the terms and conditions of the offered recording deal. They refused to sign a \\"very poor contract\\" that would have given the record label \\"the rights to change every aspect of our music.\\" After \\"lengthy negotiations failed to yield a deal with Century Media Records\\", the band disbanded in 1997. Kieran, Keith and Eric, Russia 2014 Cruachan reformed in January 1999 and after signing a recording deal with Hammerheart Records, they released the second album The Middle Kingdom in 2000. By this time, the band had dropped the black metal style in favor of a more traditional metal sound. They also expanded the roster by inviting guest vocalist Karen Gilligan to be a full-fledged member of the group. Their subsequent album Folk-Lore was co-produced by Shane MacGowan of The Pogues fame. Shane MacGowan also contributed vocals to two covers of traditional Irish songs, \\"Spancill Hill\\" and \\"Ride On.\\" The latter was released as a single and the band experienced a small taste of commercial success when it entered the Irish charts. Keith Fay, Dublin, Ireland 2012 The band released their fourth studio album Pagan in 2004 with cover artwork by John Howe. The production on the album was subsequently criticized by frontman Keith Fay as \\"terrible\\". In 2005, the band parted ways with their label Karmageddon Media \\"on good terms.\\" For the band's fifth album, Cruachan returned to the same Sun Studios where they had recorded their first three albums. The result was The Morrigan's Call, an effort that Keith Fay described as their \\"best work to date, in every aspect.\\" The album was released in November 2006 through AFM Records. Drummer Joe Farrell left the band shortly thereafter due to \\"personal reasons\\" and was replaced by Colin Purcell. A further line-up change occurred in December 2008, as vocalist Karen Gilligan left the band \\"on good terms for various reasons.\\" Keith Fay announced that he \\"will take over full-time vocal duties while John Ryan and John O' Fathaigh will take on backing vocal roles.\\" John Ryan, Santiago, Chile 2011 A demo was recorded in 2010 which showed the band's return to a much harder more black metal influenced style. This demo was sent to specific record labels only and Candlelight Records UK signed them in June 2010. \\"Blood on the Black Robe\\", the first of the \\"Trilogy of Blood\\" albums was released in 2011. On the morning of 20 February 2011, Keith Fay was brutally assaulted by about 15 men after leaving a nightclub in Dublin. Fay survived the attack with a broken rib, a knife-wound, and extensive bruising. Mauro Frison, Italy 2013 2014 saw Cruachan leave Candlelight Records and sign with the dedicated folk and pagan metal record label, Trollzorn Records. This has also been the busiest year of the band's career with very high-profile shows including a tour of Russia in March. Headline shows in Germany, Ireland, Ukraine and Israel, as well as appearances at Ostrov festival (Russia), Bandershtat festival (Ukraine), HoernerFest (Germany), Brutal Assault (Czech Rep.), Rock for Roots (Germany), Halloween Fest (Italy) and Eindhoven Metal Meeting (The Netherlands). In between these shows they had been recording what would be their next studio album at the time. This album was titled \\"Blood for the Blood God\\" and was released on 5 December 2014. Due to their recording commitments they had to turn down a place on Paganfest USA 2014. John Fay announced his departure from Cruachan on 24 June 2016.Cruachan Facebook: \\"John Fay has called it a day with Cruachan and we wish him well for the future.\\" (June 24th, 2016) This marks his second departure from Cruachan, he left Cruachan after the \\"FolkLore\\" album and appeared on albums \\"Pagan\\" and \\"The Morrigan's Call\\" in a guest musician capacity. On 27 April 2018 released their 8th studio album titled \\"Nine Years of Blood\\", a concept album about the Nine Years' War. It was the third and final album of the so-called \\"Blood Trilogy\\". This would be the last album to feature bassist Eric Fletcher who departed the band in September 2018. He was replaced by Russian multi-instrumentalist Rustam Shakirzianov. The year of 2020 has seen the band experience some notable lineup changes. On 14 January, Cruachan announced that bassist Rustam had departed the band following their performance on 70000 Tons of Metal earlier that month. On 10 February 2020, Cruachan announced that former drummer Joe Farrell would be rejoining the band as Rustam's replacement on bass. On 8 July the band announced that drummer Maruo Frison was departing the band but not before he would contribute drums to the band's then upcoming single titled \\"The Hawthorn\\". It was announced later the same month on the 28 July that fiddle player John Ryan and Guitarist Kieran Ball would both be departing the band.

Created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, they appeared in their own self-titled feature which ran from Star-Spangled Comics #7 (April 1942) to #64 (January 1947). In 1970, Jack Kirby introduced a new Newsboy Legion, made up of the sons of the original Golden Age characters. Fictional character biography =Pre-Crisis version= The Newsboy Legion is a group of orphans, living on the streets of Suicide Slum, selling newspapers to make a living. They were also frequently in trouble with the law, although local policeman Jim Harper had a soft spot for them. In their first appearance, Harper, shortly after becoming the Guardian, also becomes the Newsboys' legal guardian. A recurring theme in their stories was that the boys suspected Harper was the Guardian but were unsure. The Newsboy Legion consisted of Tommy Tompkins (the leader); Big Words (the team genius); Gabby (an excitable kid who never stopped talking); and Scrapper (the tough guy). The Newsboy Legion were reintroduced in Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen #133 (October 1970) as part of Jack Kirby's Fourth World story arc. The Legion in that story were the sons of the originals, who were now working at a government genetics project. A new addition to the team was Walter \\"Flipper Dipper\\" (or \\"Flippa Dippa\\") Johnson Jr., an African-American boy. He was obsessed with and very capable of underwater maneuvers. He is also the son of another member of the Project. His nickname was later shortened to \\"Flip\\". During their first mission, the villainous Morgan Edge develops the Whiz Wagon for the unsuspecting boys. He attempts to use it and them (and by extension, Jimmy Olsen) to kill the Hairies, an underground, technologically advanced society. The Hairies were literally neighbors of the Project and both were near the Evil Factory, which strove to destroy the others. Assisting the Legion in fighting the Factory was a clone of Scrapper called 'Scrapper Trooper', who was designed for military support of the Project. Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen #146 (Feb. 1972) The boys would become affected by the Project in other ways; such as befriending an experiment from the 'Evil Factory'. They called this large, pink, humanoid entity 'Angry Charlie'. He was the only survivor from the Factory. The police authorities from Scotland, where the Factory had been hiding, allowed the Legion to maintain custody of the entity.Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen #145 (Jan. 1972) =Post-Crisis version= Members of the Newsboy Legion as drawn in Superman - Funeral for a Friend Post-Crisis, the Newsboy Legion's 1940s history was unchanged, as was their later involvement with the DNA Project (now called Project Cadmus). Instead of having identical sons, however, the new Newsboy Legion were now said to be clones, created by the same technology that recreated the Guardian, as part of an Apokolips plot that went wrong. Like the Guardian clone, they shared their \\"father's\\" memories, at least up to their current age, meaning that they were sometimes unfamiliar with the modern world (the new Flip's memories dated from the fifties, rather than the forties). They first appeared in this form in Superman Annual #2 (1988), written by Roger Stern, and were extensively featured in Karl Kesel's run on Adventures of Superman, including breaking Kon-El out of Cadmus. The clones were always getting into trouble, such as when they hid the existence of a large monster that ate furniture. The post-Crisis Newsboys were also given real names: Big Words was Anthony Rodriguez; Gabby was Johnny Gabrielli and Scrapper was Patrick MacGuire. They were briefly joined by the Guardian's niece \\"Famous\\" Bobby Harper, but she subsequently went to stay with another relative. The Legion rebel against Cadmus for the first time when they the adults have stolen Superman's body. They join with an infiltration team composed of Lois Lane and several super-powered 'Underworlders', a Metropolis faction devoted to Superman. The group fails to regain Superman's body.\\"Superman The Man Of Steel\\" (March 1993) The incident with Harper involved the Legion taking down an operation run by Granny Goodness; an orphanage that was a secret kidnapping ring for the dark realm of Apokolips.\\"Guardians Of Metropolis\\" #1 (November 1994) Both versions of the Legion would deal with adversaries such as the insane scientist Dabney Donovan and lackeys of Darkseid. The Cadmus project entire would deal with attacks and manipulation from Lex Luthor's forces. In Superboy #56, significant changes in Project Cadmus meant the Newsboys, original and clones, left the Project. It was briefly suggested that the clones were investigating what was really behind these changes, but this was not followed up on. The Newsboy clones rescued Jimmy from the sewers beneath the project in Countdown #29 (October 2007), following his breakout from Cadmus. They allowed Jimmy to stay in the \\"Legion Clubhouse\\" (a boarded-up storefront) while he tried to resolve his situation, but he was kidnapped by the second Forager (Countdown #28). Their \\"fathers\\" were not mentioned. The group appears in issue one of Death of the New Gods (Dec 2007). Using the Whiz Wagon's computers, they assist Jimmy in gaining photographic evidence of the death of the Black Racer. In Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen (one-shot, Dec 2008), the original Newsboy Legion members were killed by Codename: Assassin. The fate of the clones remains unknown. This was part of a long-reaching conspiracy to kill all Kryptonian beings of power, of which there were many at the time. The man in charge of this plot was United States General Sam Lane.\\"Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen\\" (vol. 2) #1-2 (Nov-Dec 2008) In September 1944, the Newsboy Legion teamed up with the Boy Commandos to stop armed and armored traitors based out of New York City. The Newsboy Legion Boy Commandos Special\\" (October 2017) =Seven Soldiers version= In Grant Morrison's new take on the Guardian in Seven Soldiers: The Guardian, the Manhattan Guardian newspaper has a citywide network of volunteer reporters called the \\"Newsboy Army\\". Later in that same series it was revealed that a group called the Newsboy Army was active during the forties in an area of New York called Nowhere Street. This group consisted of Captain 7 (an African- American boy in a football uniform), Ali Ka-Zoom (a young stage magician), Vincenzo 'Kid Scarface' Baldi (an Italian boy in an impeccable suit), Chop Suzi (an Asian girl, the team's mechanic), Edward 'Baby Brain' Stargard (an infant prodigy), Little Miss Hollywood (an impressionist, the daughter of Irish immigrants) and Millions (the world's richest dog). In their final mission as a team, they are cursed by the Terrible Time Tailor to be given horrible fates to prevent them from stopping his plans for the Harrowing. Millions \\"dies\\" shortly thereafter. It is widely assumed that Cap impregnates Suzi, as his designation after the encounter with the Terrible Time Tailor is \\"child molester\\". However, the crossword puzzle included in Seven Soldiers #1 implies that Suzi may have given birth to twins, fathered by Baby Brain - despite obvious physical obstacles. Cap is subsequently killed by the others. Hollywood becomes an alcoholic 'super-impressionist'. Ali Ka-Zoom masters genuine magic, goes mad, and dies, and Kid Scarface became Vincenzo the Undying Don, the leader of the L.A. underworld and is killed by the Sheeda. Baby Brain survives to found the Manhattan Guardian newspaper. Ali Ka-Zoom has shown up alive in 52. In Seven Soldiers #1, it is revealed that Kid Scarface/Don Vincenzo actually bathed Millions in the Cauldron of Rebirth, and Millions inherited all of Vincenzo's property after his death, becoming the \\"Dogfather\\". The name \\"Newsboys of Nowhere Street\\" suggests both the Newsboy Legion and Kirby's later kid gang, the Dingbats of Danger Street. =Doc Savage= Big Words' favorite expression of surprise is \\"I'll be superamalgamated!\\" This phrase was originally used by the similarly polysyllabic William Harper Littlejohn in Doc Savage. Collections DC has published two hardback collections: * The Newsboy Legion v1, 2010, (reprints Star Spangled Comics #7-32). * The Newsboy Legion v2, 2017, (reprints Star Spangled Comics #33-64). Other versions In \\"Elseworld's Finest\\", the Legion was a small sub-group of Newsboys who counted a very young Jimmy Olsen among their number. \\"Elseworld's Finest\\" Vol. 1 #1-2 (Oct. - Nov. 1997) In other media In Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Patriot Act\\", the Newsboy Legion made an unnamed cameo as a group of young kids that help civilians to safety. At the end of the episode, the Newsboy Legion is part of the group that ends up saving the Justice League from General Wade Eiling by convincing him to back down. In Young Justice: Outsiders episode \\"First Impressions\\", the Newsgirl Legion is a genderbent version of the group which is composed of Tommi Thompkins (voiced by Mae Whitman), Gabi Gabrielli (voiced by Grey Griffin) and Antonia \\"Big Words\\" Rodriguez (voiced by Zehra Fazal). Tommi Thompkins, is the daughter of Thomas Thompkins (voiced by Jason Marsden), the mayor of Brooklyn, Maine. Sheriff Patrick Maguire (voiced by Troy Baker) is based on Scrapper. The characters are also an homage to Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated with Thomas and Patrick resembling Mayor Fred Jones Sr. and Sheriff Bronson Stone.

It was highly prized by ancient Greeks for making sculptures. Some of the greatest masterpieces of ancient Greek sculpture were carved from Parian marble, including the Medici Venus and the Winged Victory of Samothrace. The original quarries, which were used from the 6th century BC onwards, can still be seen on the north side of the island on the slopes of its central peak. The Parian's main rival in antiquity was Pentelic marble, which is also flawless white, albeit with a uniform, faint yellow tint that makes it shine with a golden hue under sunlight. Italian Carrara marble is also flawless white with a uniform faint grey tint. It is today mined mostly on the neighbour island of Paros, Naxos, in the mountains near the village of Kinidaros. Parian ware is an artificial substitute for marble, originally a brand name for a variety of unglazed biscuit porcelain, developed in 1842 in England.

At various points in their existence, the band was also known as Dalek I. Record executives at Phonogram shortened the band's name without telling them for the \\"Freedom Fighters\\" single. History =Roots: Mr. McKenzie and Radio Blank= By the mid-1970s, David Balfe, Alan Gill and Keith Hartley, three residents of Thingwall on the Wirral Peninsula, had formed a band called Mr. McKenzie. In November 1976, as punk was emerging and influencing them, the group changed their name to Radio Blank, composed of Balfe (bass and keyboards), Gill (guitar and vocals) and Hartley (lead vocals and guitar) as well as Stephen Brick (drums). They played their own material and also some covers, such as \\"You Really Got Me\\" and \\"Peaches\\". Five of their 15 live gigs were at Eric's Club in Liverpool. Balfe and Gill lost interest in punk during 1977, and dissolved the band in October 1977 to form a more experimental project. =First years (1977‚Äì1980)= In December 1977, Balfe and Gill, influenced by Kraftwerk, formed Dalek I Love You. The name was a compromise: Balfe wanted to call the band the Daleks (after the Doctor Who villains), while Gill wanted to call the band Darling, I Love You. The other two founding members were Dave Hughes (keyboards) and Chris Teepee (rhythm unit and tapes). In 1978, Balfe left the group to manage other bands, and eventually joined Big in Japan and later the Teardrop Explodes. In August 1978, the band were joined by Martin Cooper (saxophone), Andy McCluskey (lead vocals and bass, who was previously in the Id) and Kenny Peers (drums), along with poets Gordon Hon (aka \\"The Worm\\") and Max the Actor. In September, McCluskey quit to rejoin a former Id bandmate, Paul Humphreys, to form Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, and by October 1978, only Gill and Hughes remained in the band. As a duo, they signed to Inevitable Records. A demo of \\"Freedom Fighters\\" attracted the interest of Phonogram Records, who then signed them. However, Phonogram shortened the name of the band to Dalek I for the initial releases, and wanted to change the chords of \\"Freedom Fighters\\". On 16 July 1979, Dalek I released their first single, \\"Freedom Fighters\\", on Phonogram's Vertigo Records subsidiary, containing the eponymous song and B-side \\"Two Chameleons\\". It was followed by \\"The World\\" (2 October 1979) on Vertigo, and \\"Dalek I Love You (Destiny)\\" (1 May 1980), on the Back Door subsidiary, founded by the Blitz Brothers. The latter duo, composed of Chris Hughes and Paul Collister (then OMD's manager), produced the singles under that name. Dalek I's debut album, Compass Kumpas (stylized as Compass kum'p…ôs), was released 24 May 1980 on Back Door/Phonogram. It was critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful. By the time of the album's release, Gill was the only remaining member, maintaining the Dalek I Love You name (Dave Hughes having left to join OMD, and then forming the duo Godot with Hartley). The project soon went on hiatus and Gill joined the Teardrop Explodes in July 1980, replacing Mick Finkler. Gill contributed two important things to the band: their most successful single, \\"Reward\\", which he co-wrote, and LSD, which he introduced to frontman Julian Cope. His stay with the band was short-lived, however. =Reformation= By 1981, Gill had reformed Dalek I Love You, with himself as the sole member. He was augmented by Hugh Jones and Chuca Russo on vocal harmonies, and Chris Hughes on drums for the recording of a single, \\"Heartbeat\\", released on 28 February 1981 by Back Door. By 1983, the band consisted of Gill and returning members Hartley, Hon and Peers, with backing vocalists Chuca Russo, Heather Balshaw and Amanda Hon (n√©e Hawkins). They released an eponymously titled album in November 1983 on the Korova label. Hon left for London to study fine art. Gill continued making and recording music with local artists, starting his own cassette-only label, Bop a Dub. In 1985, the band released the cassette-only NaiveNaive. Dalekiloveyou.com. Retrieved on 8 May 2012. and effectively disbanded shortly afterwards. The band's first two albums were reissued in the UK on compact disc, Compass Kumpas in 1989 by Fontana Records (with four bonus tracks), and Dalek I Love You in 2007 by Korova (in a remastered and expanded edition). Legacy The band inspired the title of Dalek I Love You, a radio drama which premiered on the British digital radio station BBC 7 on 11 February 2006. The story centred on a man obsessed with Doctor Who who falls in love at a science fiction convention. The band also inspired the title of Dalek I Loved You, an autobiography by the journalist Nick Griffiths about his life as a Doctor Who fan, published in 2007.

Equivalently, X is uniformizable if and only if it is homeomorphic to a uniform space (equipped with the topology induced by the uniform structure). Any (pseudo)metrizable space is uniformizable since the (pseudo)metric uniformity induces the (pseudo)metric topology. The converse fails: There are uniformizable spaces that are not (pseudo)metrizable. However, it is true that the topology of a uniformizable space can always be induced by a family of pseudometrics; indeed, this is because any uniformity on a set X can be defined by a family of pseudometrics. Showing that a space is uniformizable is much simpler than showing it is metrizable. In fact, uniformizability is equivalent to a common separation axiom: :A topological space is uniformizable if and only if it is completely regular. Induced uniformity One way to construct a uniform structure on a topological space X is to take the initial uniformity on X induced by C(X), the family of real-valued continuous functions on X. This is the coarsest uniformity on X for which all such functions are uniformly continuous. A subbase for this uniformity is given by the set of all entourages :D_{f,\\\\varepsilon} = \\\\\\\\{(x,y)\\\\in X\\\\times X : f(x) - f(y) < \\\\varepsilon\\\\\\\\} where f ‚àà C(X) and Œµ > 0. The uniform topology generated by the above uniformity is the initial topology induced by the family C(X). In general, this topology will be coarser than the given topology on X. The two topologies will coincide if and only if X is completely regular. Fine uniformity Given a uniformizable space X there is a finest uniformity on X compatible with the topology of X called the fine uniformity or universal uniformity. A uniform space is said to be fine if it has the fine uniformity generated by its uniform topology. The fine uniformity is characterized by the universal property: any continuous function f from a fine space X to a uniform space Y is uniformly continuous. This implies that the functor F : CReg ‚Üí Uni that assigns to any completely regular space X the fine uniformity on X is left adjoint to the forgetful functor sending a uniform space to its underlying completely regular space. Explicitly, the fine uniformity on a completely regular space X is generated by all open neighborhoods D of the diagonal in X √ó X (with the product topology) such that there exists a sequence D1, D2, ‚Ä¶ of open neighborhoods of the diagonal with D = D1 and D_n\\\\circ D_n\\\\subseteq D_{n-1}. The uniformity on a completely regular space X induced by C(X) (see the previous section) is not always the fine uniformity.

The comedic plot concerns an American singer who crosses paths with criminals in Europe. The movie was #58 on the year-end list of the top-grossing films of 1967. Primary cast *Elvis Presley: Guy Lambert *Annette Day: Jill Conway *John Williams: Gerald Waverly *Yvonne Romain: Claire Dunham *Chips Rafferty: Archie Brown *Norman Rossington: Arthur Babcock *Michael Murphy: Morley Background It was the first film produced by Irwin Winkler a manager who had impressed Robert O'Brien, head of MGM, during the making of Dr Zhivago (1965). O'Brien suggested Winkler produce a movie for MGM, and Russell Thatcher, head of the studio's story department, offered the script for Double Trouble, thinking it would make an ideal vehicle for Julie Christie, who had been in Dr Zhivago. Winkler agreed and took the project to O'Brien, who said he wanted to make it, but starring Elvis Presley instead of Christie. The script had to be rewritten to accommodate Presley. Although the film was set in Europe, all the action was shot on the MGM backlot in Culver City. Winkler later wrote that his first \\"foray into Hollywood\\" was \\"with a famous male rock singer playing a dramatic role that had been written for a woman, a controlling, hostile manager, a story that took place in Europe and would be shot in Culver City, California, and a very nice director who could hardly walk up the stairs to meet me and who'd told me he was going blind.\\"Winkler p 274/3917 Elvis was paid $750,000 plus 40% of the profits.Michael A. Hoey, Elvis' Favorite Director: The Amazing 52-Film Career of Norman Taurog, Bear Manor Media 2013 Soundtrack Reception Howard Thompson of The New York Times called the film \\"pretty fair and far better than the last three Presley clinkers,\\" adding, \\"The studio-photographed action, most of it very silly, has been blended rather neatly with the authentic backgrounds. At least the picture moves. Furthermore, the good tunes arrive thick and fast, and several numbers are festive and charming.\\" Variety wrote that the film \\"appears to have been whipped up to showcase a big name without much thought of content other than to serve as footage to cash in on the star's draw,\\" though the review thought that Presley \\"gives a pretty fair account of himself despite what's handed him and the substantial hold he wields over his public should help reception.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times praised the \\"likable\\" cast and production values that were better than those of most Presley films: \\"The cast never left Culver City, but you would never know it, so cleverly have quaint Belgian streets and other European settings been reproduced on the back lot.\\"Thomas, Kevin. \\"'Double Trouble' in Citywide Showing\\". Los Angeles Times. June 23, 1967. Part IV, p. 8.

As a composer, he mostly used the name C. Ramchandra, though he also used the names Annasaheb (in the movies Bahadur Pratap, Matwale, and Madadgaar), Ram Chitalkar (in the movies Sukhi Jeevan, Badla, Mr. Jhatpat, Bahadur, and Dosti), and Shyamoo (in the movie Yeh hai duniya). Further, he often sang and acted in Marathi movies under the name R. N. Chitalkar. For his career as an occasional playback singer he used only his surname Chitalkar. Chitalkar sang some renowned and unforgettable duets with Lata such as \\"Kitna Haseen Hai Mausam\\" in the film Azaad (1955) and \\"Shola Jo Bhadke\\" in Albela (1951). Biography Ramchandra Chitalkar was born on 12 January 1918 in Puntamba, a small town in Ahmednagar district in Maharashtra, India. He studied music under Vinayakbua Patwardhan at \\"Gandharva Mahavidyalaya\\" and also under Shankarrao Sapre of Nagpur where he studied music alongside Vasantrao Deshpande. He joined the movie industry playing the lead role in Y. V. Rao's movie, Naganand. He also had some small roles at Minerva Movietone in the movies Said-e-Havas (1936) and Atma Tarang (1937). Ramchandra provided harmonium accompaniment for Minerva composers Bundu Khan and Habib Khan. He debuted as music director in Tamil movies with Jayakkodi and Vana Mohini. He received public notice as a good composer in Bhagwan Dada's Sukhi Jeevan (1942), and established a long association that culminated with the musical box office hit Albela (1951). Influenced by Benny Goodman, Ramchandra introduced in his compositions the alto sax in combination with guitar and harmonica. He also included whistling in one of his famous songs, Aana meri jaan Sunday ke Sunday in film Shehnai (1947). He used a combination of a bongo, an oboe, a trumpet, a clarinet and a sax for the song Shola Jo Bhadke in film Albela. He sang the title song \\"Shin Shinaki Boobla Boo\\" with Lata Mangeshkar, which included rock rhythms. He provided the musical score for the scat song \\"Ina mina dika\\" in Aasha (1957). Perhaps C. Ramchandra's biggest success as a music composer was the 1953 movie Anarkali starring Beena Roy in the title role and Pradeep Kumar. The songs that he composed for this movie are today legendary. Songs of this movie like \\"Yeh Zindagi Usiki Hai\\", \\"Mujhse Mat Poochh Mere Ishq Main Kya Rakha Hai\\", \\"Mohabbat Aisi Dhadkan Hai\\", \\"Jaag Dard-e-Ishq Jaag\\" etc. went on to become huge hits and were highly acclaimed. Anarkali also perhaps saw the famed composer-singer combination of Ramchandra and Lata Mangeshkar at their best ever together. A film critic in London who watched the movie is said to have remarked that the heroine sang like an angel without knowing that the angel was actually Lata giving playback for the actress. Similarly, C. Ramchandra's compositions in V. Shantaram's Navrang (1959) and Stree (1961) were also quite popular and are still remembered. The highly popular patriotic song \\"Aye Mere Watan Ke Logo\\", which was sung by Lata Mangeshkar and penned by poet Pradeep, was a composition of Ramchandra. It was later performed live, by Lata Mangeshkar, in the presence of Jawaharlal Nehru at the National Stadium, in New Delhi on Republic Day in 1963. It is said Jawaharlal Nehru became so sentimental that tears rolled down his cheeks. On 27 Jan 2014, Lata Mangeshkar was felicitated by the then chief minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi at Mumbai to commemorate the 51st Anniversary of this song. Ramchandra similarly provided a memorable musical score accompanying a competition between two dancers whose roles were played by Padmini and Vyjayanthimala for the song Kannum Kannum Kalanthu lyrics penned by Kothamangalam Subbu, sung by P. Leela and Jikki in the Tamil movie Vanjikottai Valiban (1958). He remade the song in Hindi as \\"Aaja Tu Aaja\\" from Raj Tilak (1958) written by P. L. Santoshi where Asha Bhosle and Sudha Malhotra rendered their voice. Ramchandra provided music compositions for a few Marathi, Telugu, Tamil, and Bhojpuri movies besides Hindi movies. He also produced three Hindi movies with New Sai Productions namely Jhanjhar (1953), Lehren (1953), Duniya Gol Hai (1955). In the late 1960s, Ramchandra produced two Marathi movies, Dhananjay (1966) and Gharkul (1970). Apart from composing music, he also acted in them. Ramchandra wrote his autobiography The Symphony of My Life (‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ù‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ‡§®‡§æ‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§∞‡§ó‡§Æ in Marathi) in 1977. C. Ramchandra died on 5 January 1982, a week before his 64th birthday, in Mumbai. Mumbai based troupe Musicolor, which is promoting vintage music, presented an exclusive tribute programmes featuring the gems of C Ramchandra at Dinanath Mangeshkar auditorium on 22 January 2010. Popular songs Though Ramchandra used a number of ragas in his compositions, his favourite remained raga \\"Bageshri\\" (Radha na bole - Azad, 1955). In a 1978 interview at BBC studios with Mahendra Kaul, he ascribed the reason to Bageshri's simplicity. However, he also composed songs in other ragas including Malkauns (Aadha hai chandrama- Navrang). The following is a short list of some of Ramchandra's best compositions: * Yeh Zindagi Usi Ki Hai (Anarkali) * Ae Mere Watan Ke Logo * Dheere Se Aaja Ri Ankhiyan Mein (Albela) * Katatay hain dukh mein yeh din (Parchhaain) * Tum kya jaano, tumhari yaad mein (Shin Shinaki Bubala Boo) * Aankhon mein sama jao is dil mein raha karana (Yasmin) * Kitna haseen hai mausam (Azaad) * Koi kisi ka deewaana na bane (Sargam) * Jaag dard-e-ishq jaag (Anarkali) * Mehfil mein jal uthi shama (Nirala) * Aye pyar teri duniya se hum (Jhanjar) * Wafaaon ka majboor daman bichha kar dua kar gume dil khuda se dua kar (Anarkali) * Muhobbat aisi dhadkan hai jo samjhayi nahi jati (Anarkali) * Main jagu sari rain (Bahu Rani) * Ab woh raate kahan ab woh baate kahan (Yasmin) * Kannum Kannum Kalanthu (Vanjikottai Valiban) (Tamil film) * Jo mujhe bhula ke chale gaye (Sangeeta) * Mujh se mat poochh mere ishq mein kya rakha hai (Anarkali) * Dekho ji bahar aayi (Azad) * Jo dil ko jalaye sataye dukhaye aisi muhobbat se hum baaz aaye (Nirala) * Mujh pe ilzaam-e-bewafaai hai (Yasmin) * Aye chand pyar mera tujh se ye kah raha hai (Khazana) * Muhobbat mein aise zamane bhi aaye (Sagaai) * Aa ja ab to aa ja (Anarkali) * Tere dar se khushi mangi magar gum de diya tu ne (Hungama) * Tere phoolon se bhi pyar (Nastik) * Kali kali ratiyan yaad sataye (Ghungaroo) * O nirdayi pritam (Stree) * Balma bada nadan (Albela) * Dil se bhula do tum humen (Patanga) * Kaghaz ki thi woh nao jis main ham jarahe the (Zaban) * Dil ki duniya basa ke sawariyan (Amardeep) * Ina Meena Dika (Aasha) * Jab Dil Ko Sataave Gham, Chhed Sakhi Sargam Sargam (1950) * Shola Jo Bhadke, Dil Mera Dhadke Albela (1951) * Mohabbat Hi Na Jo Samjhe, Woh Zalim Pyar Kya Jane Parchhain (1952) * Dekh Tere Sansaar Ki Haalat Kya Ho Gai Bhagwan Nastik (1954) * Naa Bole Naa Bole Naa Bole Re (Azad) Filmography Movies for which Ramchandra provided musical scores are listed below in alphabetical order: # Aanchal (1960) # Azaad (1955) # Ahinsa (1947) # Albela (1951) # Amar Rahe Yeh Pyar (1961) # Amar Deep (1958) # Anarkali (1953) # Aasha (1957) # Baarish (1957) # Bachchon Ka Khel (1946) # Badla (1943) # Bahadur (1944 film) # Bahadur Pratap (1947) # Bahurani (1963) # Balram Shri Krishna (1968) # Bhakt Raj (1943) # Chhatrapati Shivaji (1952) # Daal Me Kaala (1964) # Devta (1956) # Dil Ki Baat (1944) # Dosti (1946) # Duniya (1949) # Duniya Gol Hai (1955) # Ghungroo (1952) # Girls School (1949), with Anil Biswas # Hanso Hanso Ae Duniya Walo (1942) # Hum Diwane [as Annasahib] (1965) # Hungama (1952) # Insaniyat (1955) # Jhaanjhar (1953) # Jhamela (1953) # Jitne Door Utne Paas (1960) (Unreleased) # Kaarigar (1965) # Kavi (1954) # Khazana (1951) # Khidki (1948) # Labelaa (1966) # Lahren (1953) # Lalkar (1944) # Leela (1947) # Lutera (1955) # Madadgaar (1947) # Madam Zapata (1962) # Manorama (1944) # Matwale (1947) # Meenar (1954) # Mera Munna (1948) # Mr. Jhatpat (1943) # Muskurahat (1943) # Nastik (1954) # Nadiya Ke Paar (1948) # Naghma-e-Sehra (1945) # Namoona (1949) # Nausherwan-E-Adil (1957) # Navrang (1959) # Nazrana (1948) (Unreleased) # Nirala (1950) # Payal Ki Jhankar (1968) # Paigham (1959) # Parchhain (1952) # Patanga (1949) # Pehli Jhalak (1954) # Raj Tilak (1958) # Raunaq 1944 # Rootha Na Karo (1970) # Roshni (1949) # Sajan (1947) # Sanwaria (1949) # Saqi (1952)Filmography of C.

He is best known for his appearances with the professional wrestling promotion World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from 1995 to 1998, under the ring name Ahmed Johnson. In the WWF, he held the WWF Intercontinental Championship, making him the first African American to win a singles championship in the WWF. He also headlined the In Your House 9: International Incident pay-per-view event. Football career Norris was born in Lake Alfred, Florida, on June 6, 1963. While attending high school, he performed well at American football, basketball, amateur wrestling, and track and field. Although some sources claim Norris played football at the University of Tennessee and for the Dallas Cowboys as a middle linebacker in the 1990 and 1991 seasons, Tennessee has no record of anybody named Norris ever having played football at the university, and the NFL has no record of Norris ever playing for any team. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1989‚Äì1995)= Norris trained as a professional wrestler under Skandor Akbar, Scott Casey and Ivan Putski. After making his debut in 1989, he competed on the independent circuit for the next few years before debuting in the Global Wrestling Federation (GWF) in 1993 as Moadib. =World Wrestling Federation= Debut (1995‚Äì1996) Norris made his first appearance on July 15, 1995, wrestling on a house show in Houston, TX. Competing as Tony Norris he defeated Rico Suave.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/95.htm After being signed and given the ring name \\"Ahmed Johnson\\", he made his pre- television debut at In Your House 3 on September 24, 1995, in Saginaw, MI. Wrestling as a face, Johnson beat Skip in a non-televised match. His televised debut came on the October 23, 1995, episode of Raw. Prior to his first televised match, he appeared at the end of a Raw taping by entering a post- match brawl and slamming Yokozuna. He made his pay-per-view debut at Survivor Series, as the team of Razor Ramon, Yokozuna, Owen Hart, and Dean Douglas took on the team of Johnson, Shawn Michaels, Sid, and The British Bulldog. In the end, Johnson, Michaels, and Bulldog won the match as the survivors of their team, with Johnson eliminating both Owen Hart and Yokozuna by pinfall. At Season's Beatings on December 17, Johnson defeated Buddy Landel (who replaced Dean Douglas) in only 42 seconds. After the match, Johnson was interviewed by Jerry Lawler, at which time Lawler distracted him in order for Jeff Jarrett to attack him, starting a feud between the two in the process. At the 1996 Royal Rumble, Johnson defeated Jarrett by disqualification after Jarrett struck him with a guitar (causing Johnson to be hospitalized for a concussion). At WrestleMania XII, Camp Cornette (Vader, Owen Hart, and The British Bulldog) took on the team of Johnson, Yokozuna, and Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts. Camp Cornette won when Vader pinned Roberts with the Vader Bomb. At Good Friends, Better Enemies on April 28, Roberts and Johnson teamed up to take on Hart and Bulldog. While Jim Cornette had the referee distracted, Bulldog hit him in the knee with Cornette's tennis racket; he then forced Roberts to submit with a single leg Boston crab. After the match, Roberts and Johnson attempted to put Roberts' python, Revelations, on Cornette, but Hart pulled Cornette out of the ring. Intercontinental Champion (1996) At King of the Ring, Johnson defeated Goldust to win the Intercontinental Championship. As the first African American Intercontinental Champion, most assumed it was only a matter of time before he climbed to main event status. He was soon paired on-screen with Shawn Michaels in several tag team matches and often helped Michaels against Jim Cornette and his men, known as Camp Cornette. At International Incident, Johnson, along with Sycho Sid and Michaels, lost to Vader, Owen Hart, and the British Bulldog. On the July 22 edition of Raw, Michaels and Johnson teamed again and challenged The Smoking Gunns (Billy and Bart) for the Tag Team Championship. During the match, Faarooq Asad debuted and attacked Johnson. This was supposed to lead to a match at SummerSlam for the Intercontinental Title. On the August 5 edition of Raw, Johnson won an 11-man battle royal, last eliminating the man whom he beat for the Intercontinental title, Goldust, to be the #1 contender for the WWF Championship for the day after SummerSlam. However, Johnson was diagnosed with legit kidney problems, and was forced to miss both SummerSlam and his scheduled WWF Championship match the following night. As a result, he was out for four months and in order to keep the angle going, the attack by Farooq was said to be the cause of the kidney damage. The news was made public on WWF programming by incorporating it into the 11-man battle royal which Johnson won. Voice-over commentary was added so that Johnson's participation in the battle royal was said to be against doctors' orders, when in reality his kidney problem had yet to be discovered at the time of taping. The injury forced him to vacate the Intercontinental Championship, which was subsequently won in a tournament by Marc Mero. Feud with the Nation of Domination (1996‚Äì1998) Johnson returned later in 1996 to enter a feud with Farooq (who by then had a new gimmick and formed his own stable, the Nation of Domination). Finally, the two had an encounter at Royal Rumble 1997, where Johnson won by disqualification. Two days later, Johnson and The Undertaker defeated Faarooq and Nation member Crush in a No Holds Barred match at the Triple Threat event. He began teaming with Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) and the three fought the entire Nation at WrestleMania 13 in a Chicago Street Fight. At A Cold Day in Hell, he defeated Crush and Savio Vega in a gauntlet match before losing to Faarooq. In June 1997, Johnson turned on WWF Champion The Undertaker and joined the New Nation, with Kama Mustafa, D'Lo Brown, and Faarooq. Johnson was injured soon after this; he was scheduled to face Undertaker at Canadian Stampede for the WWF Title, but was plagued by injuries and was replaced by Vader. The Nation turned on him after he recovered and returned in August 1997, which resulted in Johnson turning face once more. He restarted his feud with the Nation, and would reunite with the Legion of Doom as well as join forces with Ken Shamrock during the feud. At Survivor Series 1997, they defeated the Nation in a Survivor Series match. Departure from WWF Johnson's last WWF appearance was at the pay-per-view No Way Out of Texas in February 1998, alongside Shamrock and the Disciples of Apocalypse (Chainz, Skull, and 8-Ball) against the Nation. While still in Texas, Johnson was booked to appear in a segment with The Truth Commission where he was to be beaten and dragged up the entrance ramp. Unbeknownst to WWF management, Johnson's sister - an avid fan of WWF - was battling cancer. Johnson knew his sister watched WWF each week and didn't want her to have the image of her brother being beaten and dragged by the neck while she was gravely ill. According to Johnson, 15 minutes before he was scheduled for the match which would end in his being attacked, he received a call that his sister was \\"doing really bad\\" and that he should come immediately to her hospital in Florida. Johnson then met with Vince McMahon and told him he \\"had some things to deal with\\" and immediately left WWF and flew to Florida, where his sister died the following week. Johnson has stated subsequently that he did not tell WWF management the reason for his departure at the time because he \\"didn't like to burden people with his problems\\" and didn't want to give the impression that he was \\"telling them something for sympathy\\". =World Championship Wrestling (1999‚Äì2000)= In late 1999, Norris signed a contract with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and debuted at Souled Out as a heel. He gained a massive amount of weight at this time, and was aptly named Big T. He interfered in a match between Harlem Heat tag team partners and real-life brothers, Booker T and Stevie Ray. He attacked Booker, causing Ray to be disqualified. Big T and Stevie formed the tag team Harlem Heat 2000. At SuperBrawl, he defeated Booker to earn the rights to the Harlem Heat name and the letter T. At Uncensored, he and Stevie lost to Booker and Billy Kidman. At Spring Stampede, they participated in a 5-team tag team tournament for the vacant World Tag Team Championship, where they lost to the eventual winners Shane Douglas and Buff Bagwell in the semi-finals of the tournament. He was released by WCW shortly afterwards due to ongoing weight issues. =Independent circuit and retirement (2002‚Äì2003)= Norris stayed away from wrestling after his release from WCW until he wrestled his return match for Arlington, Texas, based Professional Championship Wrestling in 2002 against Jared Steele. He wrestled his final match in 2003 in a tag team match for Maximum Pro Wrestling, teaming with Monty Brown in a losing effort against Sabu and Gangrel. Since retiring, Norris began working for Booker T and Stevie Ray's Pro Wrestling Alliance wrestling school. Personal life Norris, apparently, grew up in Florida before taking up residence in Houston, Texas, with his daughter Nina. He endured a harsh childhood, where his father abused his mother regularly and abused him as well if he intervened, he states. Norris briefly attended the University of Tennessee and left soon after to play for the Dallas Cowboys. According to Norris, he joined the United States Army but was later discharged due to striking his captain over viewing his orders as \\"kind of cowardly.\\" After retiring, he returned to college and earned a degree in criminology from Huston‚ÄìTillotson University. In July 2016, Norris was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed the lawsuit in September 2018.

It is the tallest structure in Lithuania, and is occupied by the SC Lithuanian Radio and Television Centre (). Design and construction The tower was designed by V. Obydovas and the engineering section by K. Balƒónas. The construction of the tower started on 31 May 1974 and finished on December 30, 1980. The construction was funded by the 11th Five Year Plan of the Soviet Union, which had earmarked funds for strategic investment in the then Lithuanian SSR. The weight of the whole structure is estimated at . The structure is composed of a concrete base, a long hollow reinforced concrete pipe, a reinforced concrete saucer, and a long steel spike. Radio transmitters are housed in the lower part of the concrete tower with antennas attached to the steel spike. The observation deck from the ground houses the cafe \\"Pauk≈°ƒçi≈≥ takas\\" (), offers a picturesque view of the city and its surroundings, and sports a rotating platform that revolves once every 45 minutes. High-speed elevators reach the cafe from ground level in 40 seconds. On clear days, visibility can extend as far as Elektrƒónai, a city approximately west, where power plants produced much of the electricity for Vilnius in Soviet times. Museum The TV tower played a major role in the events of 13 January 1991, when 14 unarmed civilians lost their lives and 700 were injured opposing the Soviet military seizure of the tower. A small museum dedicated to the January 1991 battle is housed on the ground floor, and various markers in the surrounding area indicate places where Lithuanian citizens died while trying to maintain the blockade against Soviet troops. Decorated Vilnius TV Tower Decoration Since 2000, the tower has been decorated to look like a Christmas tree each Christmas season. During the 2006 World Basketball Championship it was decorated with a large basketball net. Vilnius TV Tower became the biggest basketball hoop in the world during the 2011 FIBA European Basketball Championship. The hoop was 35 metres in diameter with a 40 metre-high net, assembled at a height of 170 metres. The lighting of the giant hoop took 2,560 metres of lighting cable and 545 bulbs. Bungee jumps are available to the public from the roof of the observation deck.

His death was described as \\"the end of an era of a group of great plant morphologists.\\" Campbell was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. His father, James V. Campbell, was a member of the Supreme Court of the state of Michigan and a law professor at the University of Michigan. Douglas Campbell graduated from Detroit High School in 1878, going on to study at the University of Michigan. He studied botany, learning new microscopy techniques, and becoming interested in cryptogramic (deciduous) ferns. He received his master's degree in 1882, and taught botany at Detroit High School while he completed his PhD research. He received his PhD in 1886, then travelled to Germany to learn more microscopy techniques. He developed a technique to embed plant material in paraffin to make fine cross-sections; he was one of the first if not the first to study plant specimens using this technique, which had been newly developed by zoologists. He was also a pioneer in the study of microscopic specimens using vital stains. When Campbell returned to the United States he took up a Professorship at Indiana University (1888 to 1891), writing the textbook Elements of Structural and Systematic Botany. In 1891 he became the founding head of the Botany department at Stanford University and remained at Stanford for the remainder of his career, retiring in 1925. He studied mosses and liverworts, producing The Structure and Development of Mosses and Ferns in 1895. This book, together with its subsequent editions in 1905 and 1918, became the authoritative work on the subject and \\"firmly established Campbell's reputation as one of the leading botanists of the United States.\\" His Lectures on the Evolution of Plants was published in 1899, and became widely used as a botany textbook. University Textbook of Botany was published in 1902, with fears expressed by colleagues that interest in pure research interest would prejudice its worth being found to be misplaced. He also travelled extensively though the Pacific collecting samples and writing Outline of Plant Geography, published in 1926, about his travels. Campbell was a member of a number of scientific institutions. He was president of the Botanical Society of America in 1913 and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1910. He was a member of the Linnaean Society of London, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Deutsche Botanische Gesellschaft, the International Association of Botanists, and the American Philosophical Society.

Overview \\"Dancing together holding with two swords\\" from Hyewon pungsokdo depicting geommu (sword dance) performing during Joseon dynasty Korean traditional dance originated in ancient shamanistic rituals thousands of years ago. By the time of the later Korean kingdoms, Goryeo and Joseon, in the 2nd millennium AD, Korean traditional dance benefited from regular support of the royal court, numerous academies, and even an official ministry of the government. A number of different dances gained permanent high status, including the Hermit dance, the Ghost dance, Buchae Chum (the fan dance), Seung Mu (the Monk dance), the Oudong (Entertainer) dance and others, despite the fact that many had humble origins. For example, the Fan dance is believed to have originated with shamans performing nature rites with leaves but evolved into one of the most highly refined Korean dances. Jeju obbang gaksichum, a variety of gaksichum and one of dances consisting of Tamraguk Ibchun gutnori which had ceased due to the cultural suppression by Imperial Japan during Korea's annexation to Japan Other Korean dances remained and remain to this day under the ambit of farmers and folk dance groups. Props used in the dances include the long billowing silk scarf of pure white used in the Salpuri dance, drums, hats, swords and others. The props may be peripheral or central to the story of the dance. In the Ghost dance, the entertainer has a joyous reunion with a deceased spouse, only to endure the heartbreak of reseparation, and there may few or no props. On the other hand, the Great Drum dance (one of several forms of drum dances) features a gaudy drum which may be taller than the performer. The drum tempts a monk until finally he succumbs to it and performs a rolling drum \\"orgy.\\" Due to the cultural suppression by Imperial Japan, arguably considered cultural genocide during Korea's Annexation to Japan,Clark, Donald N. (2000) Culture and customs of Korea, Greenwood Publishing Group, p.49 Ferrante-Wallace, Joan (2005), Ie Soc Global Perspect Thomson Wadsworth, p.96, most of the dance academies died out and some dances were lost as well as some of dance forms were distorted. However, few pioneering Korean dancers such as Choi Seung-hee (ÏµúÏäπÌù¨ Â¥îÊâøÂñú) created new forms of Korean dances based on the traditional dances and kept many of the traditions alive in secret and abroad, ÏµúÏäπÌù¨ÏóêÍ≤å Î≥¥ÎÇ¥Îäî ‚ÄòÎ™∏Ïßì Ï∂îÎ™®ÏÇ¨‚Äô from Hankyoreh newspaper and today Korean traditional dance is enjoying a vibrant resurgence. A common form of Korean Dance, where the pets of the dancers are included, involves the pet (most commonly guinea pigs as they are highly respected in areas of Korea)on two legs being piggy-backed by their owners and leap-frogging over them. Numerous universities in Korea teach Korean traditional dance, and even some universities abroad now provide education in this animal dance. Top dancers are recognised as \\"Living National Treasures\\" and are charged to pass their dances down to their students. Such official holders of traditional dances include Kim Sook-ja, a practitioner of salpuri originating in the shamanic rituals of Gyeonggi province. The lineages of dance and dancers may be traced back several generations through such connections. The 1970s saw a systematic effort to document Korean dances in North Korea by U Chang-sop. He developed a system of dance notation called the Chamo System of Dance Notation.  Types  King Gojong Korean traditional dance shares some similarity with form of dance known as contemporary and lyrical. Moves follow a curvilinear path with little short term repetition. The dancer's legs and feet are often entirely concealed by billowing Hanbok. Emotional attributes of the dances include both somberness and joy. The dancer must embody the fluid motion that surges through the traditional music that the dancers perform to. Korean traditional dance is often performed to Korean traditional music, which includes traditional drums, flutes, and more. The music is what upholds the dance and the dancer is the tool that shows the music in physical form. =Court dance= Korean court dances is called \\"jee\\" (hangul:Ï†ïÏû¨, hanja:ÂëàÊâç) which originally referred to \\"display of all talent\\" including not only dance but also other performing arts such as jultagi (Ï§ÑÌÉÄÍ∏∞ tightrope walking), gong deonjigi (Í≥µÎçòÏßÄÍ∏∞), and mokmatagi (Î™©ÎßàÌÉÄÍ∏∞) but gradually only denoted \\"court dance\\". The term has been used since the early period of Joseon dynasty. Jeongjae were used to perform for the royal family, court officials, and foreign envoys or for festive occasions sponsored by the state. Jeongjae is divided into the two categories, \\"Dangak jeongjae\\" (ÎãπÏïÖÏ†ïÏû¨) and \\"Hyangak jeongjae\\" (Ìñ•ÏïÖÏ†ïÏû¨). Dangak jeongjae are dances derived from court dances of Tang China during the Goryeo dynasty, whereas the other consist of newer court dances originated in Korea.

Goodpasture advanced the scientific understanding of the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, parasitism, and a variety of rickettsial and viral infections. Together with colleagues at Vanderbilt University, he invented methods for growing viruses and rickettsiae in chicken embryos and fertilized chicken eggs. This enabled the development of vaccines against influenza, chicken pox, smallpox, yellow fever, typhus, Rocky mountain spotted fever, and other diseases. He also described Goodpasture syndrome.Valentini, Rudolph P. Pediatric Anti-GBM Disease (Goodpasture Syndrome). Accessed 8-28-2009. Education and professional career Goodpasture was born in Clarksville, Tennessee, in 1886. He received his B.A. from Vanderbilt University in 1908. In 1912, Goodpasture graduated from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine with an M.D. degree. There, under professors William H. Welch and George H. Whipple, he was subsequently appointed a Rockefeller Fellow in pathology; he held this position from 1912 to 1915. Thereafter, Goodpasture joined the faculty of Harvard Medical School, as an attending pathologist at the Penter Bent Brigham Hospital and assistant professor of pathology in Boston. During that time, Goodpasture took a two- year leave of absence to serve during World War I as a medical officer in the United States Navy. In 1919, he undertook a pathological study of the then- ongoing influenza pandemic. In doing so, he identified a patient whose infection was followed by a peculiar illness that featured hemoptysis and acute glomerulonephritis.Harris Riley, Jr., \\"Ernest William Goodpasture\\", Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Accessed 8-28-2009. That condition, now known as Goodpasture syndrome, is currently recognized as an immunologically mediated disease caused by autoantibodies that bind to pulmonary-alveolar, as well as glomerular-capillary, basement membranes. After leaving Harvard in 1921, Goodpasture worked at the University of the Philippines College of Medicine in Manila. From 1922 to 1924, he was the director of William H. Singer Memorial Laboratories, located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1924, Goodpasture was invited to return to Vanderbilt as professor and chairman of the Department of Pathology, the School of Medicine having been recently reorganized. He accepted, and held that position until 1955. Goodpasture also was the Dean of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine from 1945 to 1950. After retirement from the latter institution in 1955, he was invited to serve as director of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) in Washington, D.C. He did so through 1959, helping to reorganize and expand the institute's scientific mission. Goodpasture's scientific research principally concerned infectious diseases. He contributed to understanding the neural spread of herpes viruses, identification of the mumps virus, development of antiviral vaccines, and studies of rickettsial, fungal, and protozoan human diseases. In a major advance, he introduced the chicken embryo as an experimental host for investigation of microbial infections and for production of vaccines. This technique made possible the development and production of a wide range of vaccines against viral diseases. Goodpasture was a dedicated and patient teacher for medical students, graduate students, and house officers in pathology. Awards Goodpasture received several prestigious scientific awards during his career. They included the H. T. Ricketts Award, the Kober Medal, the Kovalenko Medal of the National Academy of Science, and the Gold-Headed Cane Award from the American Association of Pathologists. He was on the boards of the Rockefeller Foundation, the National Academy of Science, the American Philosophical Society, the Trustees of Vanderbilt University, the Advisory Committee on Biology and Medicine of the Atomic Energy Commission, and the National Research Council. Goodpasture received honorary doctorates from Yale University, Washington University, the University of Chicago, and Tulane University. Death After retirement from the AFIP, Goodpasture returned to Nashville. He died suddenly from a heart attack in September 1960.

worked for conservative and right-wing candidates in the United States, Canada, Israel, Central and Eastern Europe over the past four decades. He was also the creator of Finkelthink. With his brother, Ronald, he ran a political consulting and survey-research firm based in Irvington, New York. Finkelstein's specialties were polling, strategy, message, media, ad placement, and advising on general campaign management. Youth and education Finkelstein grew up in a lower- middle-class Jewish family, living in Brooklyn's East New York section until age 11, then in Levittown, New York, and later Queens. He and his two brothers attended local public schools; Finkelstein graduated from Forest Hills High School. Their parents were immigrants from Eastern Europe, and the father worked as a cabdriver and did various jobs in the garment trade. While a student at Columbia University, Finkelstein interviewed and helped produce radio programs for author/philosopher Ayn Rand, and was a volunteer at the New York headquarters of the Draft Goldwater Committee in 1963‚Äì64 (the famous \\"Suite 3505\\"). He eventually earned a bachelor's degree from Queens College in 1967 in economics and political science.Schudel, Matt, \\"Arthur Finkelstein, quietly influential GOP campaign mastermind, dies at 72\\", The Washington Post, August 19, 2017. Early career (Buckley, Nixon, Helms, Reagan), 1968‚Äì76 In 1968, Finkelstein did behind-the-scenes election analysis for NBC News, part of the network's team working under former Census director Richard M. Scammon and exit-polling pioneer Irwin A. \\"Bud\\" Lewis. In 1969‚Äì70, he worked as a computer programmer in the Data Processing department of the New York Stock Exchange at its offices on 11 Wall Street in lower Manhattan. He was a familiar face in Greenwich Village, where he often argued politics from a street-corner soapbox. In his spare time, he aided State Senator John Marchi in his unsuccessful Republican-Conservative campaign for Mayor of New York City in 1969.Lynn, Frank, \\"A Political Pollster for Conservatives\\", The New York Times, December 16, 1979. F. Clifton White, mastermind of the Draft Goldwater Committee, was Finkelstein's political patron and consulting partner in the early 1970s in the firm, DirAction Services. The young pollster's first electoral success came at age 25 in 1970, with the independent Conservative campaign of James L. Buckley for senator from New York. This was one of several New York statewide contests where he was able to maneuver his clients to victory in three-way scenarios. Buckley won a plurality upset victory over GOP incumbent Charles Goodell and favored Democrat Richard Ottinger. Of that election night, Buckley later wrote, \\"By 10 pm, ... Finkelstein (my volunteer analyst who called the final results within one-tenth of one percent based on a Sunday-night telephone survey) assured me that I had won.\\"Buckley, James L., If Men Were Angels: A View From the Senate (New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1976), p. 25 Finkelstein encapsulated Buckley's message in the catchphrase, \\"Isn't it about time we had a Senator?\\" Finkelstein's work in New York led to his serving in 1971-72 as one of several pollsters for President Richard M. Nixon's re-election campaign developing sophisticated demographic analysis.Evidence of Finkelstein's polling work for Nixon is cited in Catholic Historical Review, Jan 2012 issue, Vol 98, No. 1, \\"CATHOLIC CACOPHONY: Richard Nixon, The Church and Welfare Reform\\", specifically \\"Letter from Arthur Finkelstein to Robert Marik, December 16, 1971, attached to Memorandum from Roy Morey to John Ehrlichman, September 24, 1971, White House Central Files, Subject File - Religious Matters, Box 18, Folder: RM 3-1 Catholic 1/1/71-12/72, RMNPP\\" The 1972 election also saw the first of his three victorious campaigns to elect Jesse Helms as U.S. senator from North Carolina. After the election, Finkelstein worked with Helms political aides Tom Ellis and Carter Wrenn to establish a permanent conservative organization, the National Congressional Club,Taylor, Paul, The Washington Post, October 15, 1982, \\"Helms Modernizes GOP Political Machine for the Electronic Age\\" which lasted until 1995.Christensen, Rob, Raleigh News & Observer, September 8, 2017, \\"He was the man behind the curtain in NC politics\\" Finkelstein and White went their separate ways in the mid-1970s, and he founded his own firm, Arthur J. Finkelstein & Associates (often later shortened to AJF & Associates). In the 1976 presidential primaries, White supported Gerald Ford,Los Angeles Times, January 11, 1993, \\"OBIT: F. Clifton White; Architect of '64 Goldwater Campaign\\" while Finkelstein worked for Ronald Reagan's insurgent campaign. He helped Helms's Congressional Club turn around the faltering Reagan effort with a victory in the April North Carolina primary. His work continued in the subsequent Texas primary. \\"Finkelstein had been a key figure in 1976, when he helped orchestrate Reagan's campaign-saving comeback in North Carolina\\" which was crucial in Reagan's further political advancement. At Finkelstein's urging, Reagan made a major issue of the impending Panama Canal Treaties, which Gerald Ford was negotiating and which infuriated conservative voters. (This proved to be Reagan's signature issue throughout the late 1970s.) As Jules Witcover later reported, \\"Tens of thousands of Wallace voters were gradually cut adrift during his slide [in the primaries] ... and Reagan media man Arthur Finkelstein recruited a Wallaceite from Fort Worth to radio and television spots for Reagan ... It was dynamite.\\"Witcover, Jules, Marathon (New York: Viking Press, 1977), p. 419 The Associated Press's Mike Robinson wrote Finkelstein was \\"viewed by many as instrumental in Gov. Reagan's 1976 primary successes in North Carolina and Texas.\\"Robinson, Mike, Washington Dateline, Associated Press, May 5, 1979 NCPAC, a GOP Senate majority, and Reagan's victory, 1975‚Äì80 Passage of the post-Watergate Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) amendments, and the subsequent 1976 Supreme Court decision in Buckley v. Valeo, drastically altered the rules by which Presidential and Congressional contests were waged. Finkelstein was among the first to sense an opportunity, and pioneered the concept and execution of independent expenditure campaigns, which would operate as a third force in an election beyond the control of candidate or party officials. Beginning in 1975, Finkelstein was the chief strategist behind the most successful IE operation of this period, the National Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC).Sinclair, Ward, The Washington Post, October 8, 1982, \\"Is Politics Threatening to Become Poll-itics?; The Electorate and the Art of Pulse-Taking\\" Its Executive Director was Finkelstein prot√©g√© Terry Dolan. In 1981 New Right activist Richard Viguerie wrote, \\"NCPAC relies heavily on research and polling, a reflection of one of its founders, conservative pollster Arthur Finkelstein.\\"Viguerie, Richard, The New Right: We're Ready to Lead (Falls Church, Va.: Viguerie Co., rev. ed. 1981), p. 57; and Edwards, Lee, The Conservative Revolution, (New York: Free Press, 1999), p. 186 In 1978, NCPAC was instrumental in the defeat of Democrats Dick Clark in Iowa and Thomas J. McIntyre in New Hampshire. Both liberal senators were replaced by committed conservatives.The Washington Post, December 13, 1982, \\"Latest Mixers Of Politics, Religion Scrutinized\\" NCPAC ran hard-hitting ads for television, radio and newspapers, crafted by Finkelstein. A central idea behind the strategy was to expose the liberal words and actions in Washington of elected officials, usually senators, whose moderate or conservative public image at home was at odds with their actual voting record.Martin, Lawrence, Toronto Globe and Mail, December 28, 1978, \\"U.S. veers toward New Right on anti- Government wave\\" NCPAC hit its peak in 1980, operating IEs in six states, its ads and organizing efforts helping to topple liberal Democrats in Iowa (John Culver), Indiana (Birch Bayh), Idaho (Frank Church) and South Dakota (George McGovern).Andersen, Tena, Associated Press, October 3, 1980, \\"National Conservative Group Drops out of Anti-McGovern Campaign\\" Less well-known were NCPAC's TV ads in the presidential contest, both negative (one featuring Jimmy Carter in a 1976 debate, another with Edward Kennedy shouting \\"And no more Jimmy Carter!\\") and positive (footage of Ronald Reagan speaking on values); Finkelstein concentrated these ad buys in closely contested Southern states (e.g., Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama), all of which switched from Carter to Reagan in 1980.Alexander, Herbert, Financing the 1980 Election (Rowman & Littlefield, 1983) Finkelstein believed in the usefulness of third forces to help conservatives win elections, but not a conservative third party (a much- discussed option in the mid-1970s). At a February 1977 conference, he told activists, \\"The development of a third party may very well hurt conservative options in the future by diluting them,\\" warning that traditional and emotional ties to party labels would keep many conservatives in their present parties.Don McLeod, Associated Press, February 4, 1977 He said the Watergate scandal had cost the GOP the one clear advantage it had over the Democrats - the perception by voters that it was the more honest of the two parties. Nevertheless, he counseled against third-party option, saying this would succeed only in drawing conservatives out of both parties, creating a weak satellite party and leaving the major parties more liberal.Cannon, Lou, \\"Conservatives Are Cool To Forming Third Party\\", The Washington Post, February 5, 1977. Besides NCPAC, Finkelstein found particular success during this period in guiding individual Senate and House campaigns. Reagan backer and political unknown Orrin Hatch won a resounding 56% victory in Utah in 1976 against a three-term Democratic incumbent. In 1978, he was consultant to the successful re-election campaigns of Jesse Helms in North Carolina and Strom Thurmond in South CarolinaThe Washington Post, May 29, 1978 ‚Äî the latter being Thurmond's last seriously contested race (he served until 2002, age 100). That same year, Finkelstein shepherded Carroll Campbell to his first win in South Carolina's Greenville-area 4th Congressional District.Gailey, Phil, The New York Times, September 24, 1986, \\"Bigotry Issue in Carolina Campaign\\" After a brief interlude early in 1979 as adviser to conservative Congressman Phil Crane,Robinson, Mike, Associated Press March 6, 1979 Finkelstein returned as one of the pollsters advising Ronald Reagan's primary campaign.Lynn, Frank, The New York Times, December 16, 1979, Sec. 22, p. 1 His services were also reportedly sought by the George H.W. Bush campaign. In 1980, he engineeredHerman, Robin, The New York Times, August 23, 1980, \\"A Persistent D'Amato Focuses on Javits's Record and Health\\" the improbable Senate victory of Long Island supervisor Alfonse D'Amato over incumbent Jacob Javits, another three-way contest where the Democrat (Congresswoman Liz Holtzman) was favored. He advised the successful campaign of 31-year-old State Senator Don Nickles for U.S. Senate from Oklahoma. Most unlikely was the victory (aided by National Congressional Club allies) of John East in the North Carolina Senate contest;Allen, Kenneth S., St. Petersburg Times, April 11, 1988, \\"Attack politics' specialist to lead Mack campaign\\" East was a little-known professor who used a wheelchair, recruited for the race by Jesse Helms and elected through the efforts of Ellis, Wrenn, Finkelstein and the Helms organization. Besides Campbell, House winners included Duncan Hunter in California and Denny Smith in Oregon (both 1980), the latter toppling House Ways and Means Committee chair Al Ullman. Finkelstein also had his share of Senate losses, including two by previous client James Buckley (1976, New York,The New York Times, October 18, 1976 and 1980, Connecticut),Madden, Richard L., The New York Times, December 21, 1980, \\"It Costs More to Win Votes\\" and with Avi Nelson (1978, Massachusetts). Finkelstein was also pollster-strategist for Maryland Congressman Robert Bauman, who narrowly lost his seat after he was charged in DC with homosexual solicitation, one month before the November election.Feinstein, John, \\"Bauman: 'I'll Carry This to My Grave'\\", The Washington Post, August 15, 1982. The 1980s During the 1980 campaign Finkelstein was a Reagan pollster and had been \\"aboard the Reagan campaign\\" since mid-1979. from the early primary days all the way through November. Having ridden (and driven) the Republican wave of 1977‚Äì80, he found the 1980s a period of consolidation, helping clients grow their base and win re- election. In 1981, Finkelstein was one of four pollsters designated to do work on behalf of the Reagan White House, paid by the Republican National Committee. (The others were Richard Wirthlin, Robert Teeter and Tully Plesser).Cattani, Richard, Reagan will keep close tabs on public image, The Christian Science Monitor, January 13, 1981, p. 1 Newsweek reported in 1982 that \\"each of the President's top three advisers has his own numbers man: \\"Wirthlin became Edwin Meese's pollster, Teeter became James Baker's and now Finkelstein has become Michael Deaver's.\\"Gelman, Eric, A Third Pollster for the White House, Newsweek, July 5, 1982. Throughout Reagan's first term and into the 1984 re-election campaign, Finkelstein advised Deaver, conducting polls and planning events and visuals (e.g. Reagan's trip to France for the 40th anniversary of D-Day). As The Washington Post reported: \\"For the White House, Finkelstein is more of an idea man than a pollster, specializing in media events such as the president's \\"spontaneous\\" drop-ins on disadvantaged individuals and institutions.\\"Cannon, Lou, \\"Public's Personality Seems Split in Its Perception of Reagan\\", The Washington Post, July 12, 1982. He also began dabbling in gubernatorial contests‚Äîin New Jersey (1981), for Jim Wallwork (defeated by Tom Kean in the GOP primary);Carroll, Maurice, \\"Wallwork Seeks to Ride Conservative Tide in New Jersey\\", The New York Times, May 5, 1981, p.

But his efforts on behalf of Democrat- turned-Republican Congressman Eugene Atkinson of Pennsylvania ended in defeat,Robbins, William, The New York Times, October 17, 1981, \\"PENNSYLVANIANS HOPING TO BENEFIT IN LEGISLATOR'S SHIFT TO G.O.P.\\" as did the Congressional campaign in Westchester County of John Fossel, chairman of Oppenheimer Funds. That year, NCPAC (with Finkelstein as pollster-strategist) was successful in only one targeted race (helping to oust Democrat Howard Cannon in Nevada), failed in several others (e.g. Maryland),Baker, Donald P., Washington Post, June 3, 1981, \\"Rep. Holt Working Toward A Challenge of Sen. Sarbanes; GOP Rep. Marjorie S. Holt Working Toward Challenging Democratic Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes\\" and thereafter declined in influence. The pitfalls of running IEs and campaigns at the same time were illustrated when NCPAC was sued for running ads in early 1982 against New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan‚Äîaround the same time as Finkelstein was working for GOP Senate candidate Bruce Caputo.Albin Krebs and Robert McG. Thomas, The New York Times, September 16, 1981, \\"NOTES ON PEOPLE; Senator Moynihan Gets a Challenger for 1982 \\" In 1986, a federal court ruled against NCPAC, and The Washington Post editorialized, \\"Both NCPAC and the Caputo campaign used the same pollster, Arthur Finkelstein.

As late as 1987, Finkelstein was doing surveys for NCPAC (e.g. in New Mexico).NCPAC Release on New Mexico and Jeff Bingaman, April 30, 1987; accessed through PR Newswire. During the early 1980s, Finkelstein became involved in international polling, for groups such as Canada's National Citizens CoalitionUnited Press International, January 13, 1983, \\"Clark's popularity in decline, poll says\\" and (in 1986) the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario after losing their majority in the Ontario Legislature following the 1985 elections.Speirs, Rosemary, \\"The Tories' desperate bid to hang on\\", Toronto Star, October 15, 1986. The 1984 election cycle saw him involved in three pitched battles for the Senate, the most heralded being the challenge of Democratic Governor Jim Hunt to Helms in North Carolina. The Ellis-Wrenn-Finkelstein team used the permanent assets of the National Congressional Club to wage a three-year campaign to undermine Hunt, including a groundbreaking opposition-research and advertising effort that redefined the popular governor as a tax-raising national Democrat. Helms won with 52%, in what was then the most expensive Senate race in history. However, this was the last Helms campaign on which Finkelstein would serve as pollster. Before Helms' 1990 re-election campaign, Finkelstein told the North Carolina team he couldn't work for the Senator any more. According to Carter Wrenn the New Yorker was polite about it, didn't offer a reason and recommended one of his proteges, John McLaughlin, handle the survey and strategy work. At the time, Helms was becoming one of the leading critics of the gay rights movement. \\"I took it that Arthur wasn't comfortable with Jesse's stand on the social issues,\\" Wrenn said, and chalked it up to Finkelstein's libertarian views. in November 1984, Finkelstein also found success in New Hampshire, as he aided freshman conservative Sen. Gordon HumphreyMcGrory, Mary, \\"Sen. Humphrey's Unexpected Stand With the MX Mavericks\\", The Washington Post, June 2, 1983. in overcoming a tough challenge from long-time Democratic Congressman Norman D'Amours. But in Massachusetts, after winning a contested primary against Elliot Richardson,Black, Chris, The Boston Globe, September 9, 1984, \\"GOP SENATE RACE A STUDY IN CONTRASTS\\" businessman Ray Shamie lost a close uphill battle to Lt. Gov. John Kerry for the Senate seat vacated by Paul Tsongas.Scammon, Richard et al, America Votes 16 : a handbook of contemporary American election statistics, 1984 (CQ Press, 1985) Another client, Congressman Tom Corcoran, failed to dislodge incumbent Charles Percy from the Senate nomination in Illinois, despite tough ads (attributed to Finkelstein) suggesting Percy was personally close to PLO leader Yasser Arafat.Neal, Steve, \\"Dirty Political Ads Can Muddy the Perpetrator\\", Chicago Tribune, April 13, 1986.

Governor; Durrette, Parris Dismiss Effect of Survey\\", The Washington Post, November 15, 1984. Republicans lost their Senate majority in the November 1986 midterm elections. Nevertheless, Finkelstein's leading clients won re-election ‚Äî Alfonse D'Amato in New York,Lynn, Frank, The New York Times, October 20, 1986, \\"Aggressive Tactics Raise $7.7 million for D'Amato\\" and Don Nickles in Oklahoma.Gerstel, Steve, United Press International, April 20, 1986, \\"Political Notebook\\" However, his candidate to succeed John East in North Carolina, David Funderburk, lost his primary,National Journal, May 3, 1986 and he fared no better in Ohio, where Congressman Tom Kindness made little headway against incumbent Sen. John Glenn as well as in Illinois, where state legislator Judy Koehler failed to dislodge Senator Alan Dixon. Finkelstein also steered Californian Elton Gallegly to his initial victory for Congress,Miller, Alan C., \\"Gallegly Bets on Force of Incumbency\\", Los Angeles Times, June 6, 1988. but failed to push State Sen. Ed Davis to victory in the California U.S. Senate primary.Love, Keith & Balzar, John, Los Angeles Times, September 8, 1985, \\"Fear of Cranston, Unrest Clouding GOP Convention\\" In 1985‚Äì87, Finkelstein was part of the team advising former U.N.

Still, the \\"Hey Buddy\\" ads were unpopular with the press, and 22 of 23 Florida daily newspapers endorsed MacKay.Barnes, Robert, \\"Democrat Battles Tide in Florida\\", The Washington Post, November 5, 1988. Mack continued to press the liberal vs. conservative contrast in debates and ads,Dahl, David, St. Petersburg Times, October 31, 1988, \\"MacKay labors as Mack glides\\" closing with endorsements by the highly popular Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, plus footage of MacKay endorsing various tax increases. A slight majority of voters casting ballots on Election Day backed MacKay,Kleindienst, Linda, \\"Local Absentee Votes May Decide Governor's Race\\", South Florida Sun-Sentinel, November 2, 1990. but an aggressive GOP absentee-voter program\\"Mack May Owe Victory to Party's Absentee-Voter Drive\\", Orlando Sentinel, November 12, 1988. had already banked a margin of tens of thousands of votes,Babcock, Charles R., \\"Being There Unnecessary for Republican Victories - GOP Credited in Rounding Up Absentee Voters\\", The Washington Post, November 25, 1988. and Mack was elected senator by a total of 34,512 votes out of 4 million cast.Scammon, Richard et al, America Votes 18 : a handbook of contemporary American election statistics, 1988 (CQ Press, 1989) Finkelstein also advised Joe Malone in his campaign against Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy;United Press International, September 1, 1988, \\"Dukakis shown hurting in home state\\" Malone lost with 34%, but gained enough positive recognition that, in 1990, he was elected Treasurer in the overwhelmingly Democratic state. Another client, Joseph DioGuardi, lost his congressional re-election contest in New York, 47.5% to 50.3%, to Nita Lowey.Feron, James, The New York Times, October 23, 1988, \\"A Quickening Congressional Race\\" But, in another tight contest decided by absentee voters, Denny Smith won re-election to Congress in Oregon.The Washington Post, November 12, 1988, \\"Rep. Denny Smith Wins a Squeaker\\" Focus on New York, 1989‚Äì94 Brooklyn native Finkelstein had long advised local and state party organizations in New York (e.g., the powerful GOP committees of Westchester,Lynn, Frank, \\"Suburbs' Power Mirrored in Tally of G.O.P. Victories\\", The New York Times, November 9, 1980. NassauLynn, Frank, \\"D'Amato Victory Increases Stature of Island in G.O.P.\\", The New York Times, September 14, 1980. and Suffolk Counties,Lynn, Frank, \\"Shoreham Issue Splits Party Ranks in Suffolk\\", The New York Times, October 16, 1983. then dominant in all three suburban areas). In 1989, he dove into the contentious world of New York City politics. Rudolph Giuliani's initial candidacy for Mayor was met with a primary challenge by cosmetics billionaire Ronald Lauder, backed by Sen. D'Amato and guided by Finkelstein.Duggan, Dennis, Newsday, January 31, 1989, \\"'Resources' to Be Competitive\\" The Giuliani-D'Amato feud had begun in 1988 over the selection of Rudy's successor as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York;Lynn, Frank, \\"G.O.P. Battling Over Giuliani's Future\\", The New York Times, January 13, 1988. it colored Republican politics in the Empire State for the next several years. In this first skirmish, Lauder's millions of dollars' worth of hard-hitting advertising failed to prevent Giuliani's winning the GOP nomination. (Giuliani later blamed Lauder's primary ads for his narrow loss to David Dinkins that November.)Borsellino, Robert, \\"Giuliani Won't Run for Governor, Hints At Challenging D'Amato\\", Albany Times Union, March 16, 1990. A year later, in the disastrous 1990 gubernatorial election, GOP nominee Pierre Rinfret nearly finished in third place (behind Conservative Party of New York State upstart Herbert London). D'Amato, and by extension Finkelstein, assumed dominance over the moribund state party apparatus. Long-time Rensselaer County activist William Powers, a staunch D'Amato ally, was named chairman, and began the rebuilding process.Borsellino, Robert, \\"Powers Elected to Lead Battered GOP\\", Albany Times Union, January 15, 1991. (D'Amato allies had started their own state PAC in 1989, the Committee for New York, in order to aid Republicans independent of the decaying party team.\\"GOP PAC Supported D'Amato's Cause; State Contributions Skirt Federal Limits\\", Newsday, May 24, 1990.) At this time, the Reaganite Finkelstein was not a fan of the current Administration of George H.W. Bush. In a rare public appearance in February 1991, after the GOP's poor national showing in the November 1990 elections, he reminded a conservative audience that Reagan prospered through unabashed ideological appeals that drew crossover votes from sympathetic Democrats. But Bush and other GOP candidates \\"kicked that away\\" in 1990 by raising taxes, sidestepping abortion and other social issues, and soft-pedaling their anti-communism while rooting for Mikhail Gorbachev to succeed. \\"We are going to have to go back to the things that got us here,\\" Finkelstein said.Harwood, John, \\"National Conservatives Concerned About Movement's Future\\", St. Petersburg Times, February 8, 1991. Meanwhile, D'Amato faced mounting ethical problems, and these occupied much of Finkelstein's time in 1990 and 1991. Though the New York senator was ultimately cleared by the Senate Ethics Committee in 1991,Turner, Douglas, \\"Ethics Panel Absolves D'Amato; Ruling Chides Senator for Allowing Misuse of Office\\", Buffalo News, August 3, 1991. he was the subject of ceaseless negative news stories and editorials. When CBS's 60 Minutes ran a highly damaging story on D'Amato, Finkelstein produced a response program that refuted many of its charges and misstatements.Schanberg, Sydney, \\"Chutzpah Stars on the Senator Al Show\\", Newsday, May 31, 1991. All the while, D'Amato's aggressive casework program and advocacy for New York interests was emphasized in paid and earned media. Nevertheless, going into his 1992 re-election campaign, D'Amato was shown in surveys to be a near-certain loser to most prospective challengers. The indictment of his brother, Armand D'Amato, on two dozen counts of mail fraud in March 1992 darkened the clouds further.Goldberg, Nicholas and Alan Eysen, \\"Consensus: A Bad Blow To Senator's Campaign\\", Newsday, March 12, 1992. When the Democrats nominated Attorney General Robert Abrams in September, Finkelstein's polls showed D'Amato down 25 points, just seven weeks before the election.D'Amato, Alfonse M., Power, Pasta and Politics: The World According to Senator Al D'Amato (New York: Hyperion, 1995), p. 225 With the huge lead enjoyed by Democratic presidential nominee Bill Clinton in New York, the Bush- Quayle ticket was a positive drag on D'Amato. As with the Mack-MacKay race in 1988, Finkelstein moved to define Abrams by his liberal positions on issues. Support for a single-payer national health scheme was translated into \\"a 6% tax on every job in America\\"‚Äîa contention never challenged. His backing for other tax increases was documented and publicized in TV and radio ads, with the tagline, \\"Bob Abrams: Hopelessly liberal\\". The D'Amato campaign was no less bold on the ethics issue, repeating pay-for-play charges made by ex-Rep. Geraldine Ferraro during the Democratic primary, with ads featuring excerpts from the Abrams-Ferraro debate. When news stories late in the campaign revealed the nominee's disallowed business-tax deductions, Finkelstein's closing ad ran: \\"Bob Abrams never met a tax he didn't like ... except his own.\\"D'Amato, Alfonse M., Power, Pasta and Politics: The World According to Senator Al D'Amato (New York: Hyperion, 1995), p. 229 On Election Day 1992, as Bill Clinton was winning New York State by 16 points, D'Amato won re-election by 1.2 points, a margin of 80,794 votes ‚Äî with a wave of Clinton-D'Amato split-ticket votingHalverson, Guy & Mouat, Lucia, \\"Campaign '92 Most Mid- Atlantic Incumbents Win\\", Christian Science Monitor, November 6, 1992. in Brooklyn, Queens and Buffalo the deciding factor. Finkelstein had several other results that day. In North Carolina, he helped the Ellis-Wrenn- Congressional Club team guide businessman and former Democrat Lauch Faircloth to victory over incumbent Sen. Terry Sanford. Don Nickles easily won a third term as senator from Oklahoma. But in Illinois, the candidacy of Rich Williamson failed to defeat Democrat Carol Moseley Braun to replace Sen. Alan Dixon. D'Amato's comeback win had demonstrated the Republicans' window of opportunity in New York City's outer boroughs, among working-class CatholicsKeeler, Bob, Newsday, November 5, 1992, \\"His Winning Ways on Ropes, D'Amato Found Fighting Legs\\" and (especially) Jewish voters angered by Democratic leaders' handling of the Crown Heights violence and subsequent incidents.Wasserman, Elizabeth, \\"U.S. Senate Second-Guessing Abrams' Effort\\", Newsday, November 5, 1992. The senator's ticket-splitting performance had the effect of shielding downticket candidates from the Bush debacle, and Republicans actually made Congressional gains in strong D'Amato areas ‚Äî e.g., working-class Buffalo (Jack Quinn),McCarthy, Robert J., \\"Local Election Results Defy Definition, Experts Say Voters Reject Traditional Party Loyalty, Exercise Independent Thinking\\", Buffalo News, November 8, 1992. and suburban Long Island (Rick Lazio)Levy, Lawrence C., \\"L.I.'s Strong Message to the Republicans\\", Newsday, November 5, 1992. ‚Äî while holding the majority in the powerful State Senate, which strengthened the hand of D'Amato, Finkelstein and Powers going into 1993 and 1994.Carroll, Maurice, Newsday, December 31, 1993, \\"POLS & POLITICS Republicans Are Gunning For Guv Race\\" Giuliani's second Mayoral campaign in 1993 benefited from the resurgent New York GOP. He had made a point of endorsing the Senator for re-election,Carroll, Maurice, \\"City Pols: What's In It For Me? Ponder Vote's Local Impact\\", Newsday, November 5, 1992. and D'Amato and Finkelstein did not again back a primary challenger. This time, Giuliani ran a more effective race, riding to victory on a wave of discontent with incumbent David Dinkins, with even stronger turnout among ethnic Catholics and Jewish voters than in 1989, and in the same areas where D'Amato had done well a year earlier.William Bunch, Michael H. Cottman and Mitch Gelman, \\"A Rudy Makeover Polish paved way to win\\", Newsday, November 4, 1993. In New York City in November 1993, Finkelstein and Ronald Lauder also guided to victory a measure limiting the terms of elected city officials.Myers, Steven Lee, \\"New Yorkers Approve Limit of 2 Terms for City Officials\\", The New York Times, November 3, 1993. The New York Times called this vote \\"a terrific defeat for the city's mostly Democratic political establishment, which had fought in court throughout the summer to kill the referendum, only to have the state's highest court order it on the ballot just two weeks [before the election].\\" Finkelstein had specialized in federal elections to this point, and it was uncertain how he would adapt to the localized issues and personal style of a gubernatorial contest. Reluctantly at first, and only after considering several alternative candidates, he and D'Amato settled on supporting little-known State Senator George Pataki of Peekskill for Governor in 1994.Pataki, George, with Daniel Paisner, Pataki: An Autobiography (New York: Viking, 1998), pp. 69‚Äì72 They guided him through the State Convention in May, and to a smashing 3-to-1 primary victory in September over Nelson Rockefeller's longtime political wheelhorse Richard Rosenbaum.Humbert, Marc, \\"Cuomo, Pataki Win Primaries, Face Showdown\\", Associated Press, September 14, 1994. The main challenge was defining the race against Cuomo. Finkelstein's first ad radiated disappointment and sowed seeds of disbelief: \\"Desperate candidates do desperate things ... Mario Cuomo could have been senator or President...\\"AP story by Marc Humbert in Albany Times Union, September 16, 1994, \\"Cuomo's Campaign Takes Both High Road and Low Road\\" Subsequent spots, often as brief as 10 seconds, highlighted Cuomo-era failures (e.g. snarled traffic and record-high utility rates in Long Island),Sack, Kevin, \\"THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: THE OVERVIEW; CUOMO AND PATAKI GO TO LONG ISLAND IN HUNT FOR VOTES\\", The New York Times, November 1, 1994.Fisher, Ian, \\"THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: ISSUES; Clamor Over Death Penalty Dominates Debate on Crime\\", The New York Times, October 9, 1994. and especially the litany of tax increases over his 12 years. The persistent tagline: \\"Mario Cuomo: Too liberal for too long.\\"Goldberg, Nicholas & John Riley, \\"Pataki: Cuomo 'Too Too' Challenger unveils ads attacking governor\\", Newsday, September 15, 1994. Pataki introduced himself in ads first as a gentle reformer, then angry in responding to Cuomo attacks, and finally enthusiastic (in excerpts from rally speeches at campaign's close). Cuomo defended his record and played up D'Amato's sponsorship of Pataki's campaign (to the tune of Paul Simon's \\"You Can Call Me Al\\"), but had trouble overcoming the anti-incumbent tide. Pataki had a slight lead in public surveys when, on October 24, Giuliani endorsed Cuomo, with attacks on his fellow Republican quickly becoming a staple on evening news programs.Purdum, Todd, \\"THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: NEWS ANALYSIS - Who Can Do the Most?; Mayor's Endorsement of Cuomo Reflects Political Interests and Financial Realities\\", The New York Times, October 25, 1994. Poll numbers fluctuated wildly, with Finkelstein's own tracking survey showing a Cuomo lead ballooning to 13 points within days.A The New York Times/WCBS survey, completed 5 days after Giuliani's endorsement, showed Cuomo at 44%, Pataki at 34%. See Moody, Nekesa Mumbi, Associated Press, October 30, 1994, \\"National Republicans Go After Mayor for Endorsing Democrat Governor\\". It required a swift response. He elected to attack Giuliani's endorsement as a corrupt deal with Cuomo,Purdum, Todd, \\"THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: THE AD CAMPAIGN; Race for Governor: Pataki Says Cuomo Is Buying Election\\", The New York Times, November 2, 1994. the ad using headlines citing suspiciously timed New York State grants to the City to suggest the Governor had used taxpayer money to buy the Mayor's backing. Pataki relentlessly pushed this argument in public appearances.Riley, John, Newsday, October 29, 1994, \\"Pataki on New Offensive\\" The pendulum swung back, with negative reaction to Giuliani especially strong Upstate and in the Metro North and Long Island suburbs.Jones, Charisse, \\"THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: THE CAMPAIGN; Upstate, Pataki's New Message: Giuliani Endorsement Has Price\\", The New York Times, October 28, 1994. (GOP protestors even chased the Mayor's plane on an airport tarmac during a statewide flyaround for Cuomo.) Pataki closed the sale with an energetic tour of the state, appearing alone on a WCBS-TV Election Eve program when Cuomo refused a one-on-one debate.Pleven, Liam & John Riley, \\"Upstate key for Pataki\\", Newsday, November 8, 1994. The final result: Pataki defeated Cuomo by 4 points. In an historic Republican landslide year, Mario Cuomo was the most prominent Democrat to fall. As Todd Purdum of The New York Times wrote that November, \\"For good or ill, Mr. Pataki's campaign [wa]s almost entirely a creation of Mr. Finkelstein.\\" Delaware provided another win for Finkelstein in November 1994, as longtime Senator Bill Roth coasted to victory for his fifth term, 56% to 44%.Scammon, Richard et al, America Votes 21 : a handbook of contemporary American election statistics, 1994 (CQ Press, 1995) NRSC, Netanyahu, and Being 'Outed,' 1995‚Äì96 Following Election Day 1994, D'Amato and Finkelstein were handed new challenges and opportunities, as the 14-year incumbent was named by his Senate peers as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), one of the four permanent GOP campaign operations in Washington. They had a tough act to follow‚ÄîPhil Gramm of Texas had just piloted Republicans to a 7-seat gain and recaptured control of the Senate. For Finkelstein, it was his first bow as an inside player on a Washington campaign committee, his dealings previously being as representative of an individual candidate. Now he and D'Amato were responsible for helping to direct Senate campaigns in 33 states simultaneously.Shepard, Steven, \\"GOP campaign guru Arthur Finkelstein dies at 72\\", Politico, August 19, 2017. One of their first moves was to break the cycle of hiring parochial-minded Senate aides to manage the sprawling committee; their choice for Executive Director was John Heubusch (later a top executive with Gateway Computers and head of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation). Other key hires were Jo Anne B. Barnhart as Political Director, and Gordon Hensley as Communications Director.\\"Politics' Fabulous Fifty\\", Roll Call, September 23, 1996, p. A24. (Barnhart was a long- time aide and campaigner for Sen. William Roth, and later served as Commissioner of the Social Security Administration.) All three were singled out by Roll Call newspaper in 1996 as among national \\"Politics' Fabulous Fifty.\\"Cook, Charles E., \\"Political Surveyor\\" column, p. 5, Roll Call, December 12, 1996. The NRSC faced several challenges beyond their control, many emanating from the two dominant Republicans of 1995-96, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. The Oklahoma City bombing had given President Bill Clinton an opportunity to marginalize his opponents, and slowed the momentum of the reform-minded Republican Congress.Many sources, e.g. http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2010/04/remembering_oklahoma_city_and.html and https://archives.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/flashback-how-clinton- exploited-oklahoma-city-for-political-gain/Content?oid=2167590 By late 1995, unrelenting Democratic/press attacks, and his own missteps, had turned Gingrich into a pariah through much of the country (2-to-1 unfav-fav ratio in surveys); meanwhile, Dole was running for President, and allowing ambition to overshadow his Senate work. In mid-1996, Dole resigned from the Senate to campaign full-time, but by then he was behind Clinton to stay, and eventually polled less than 41% nationwide.Scammon, Richard et al, America Votes 22 : a handbook of contemporary American election statistics, 1996 (CQ Press, 1997) D'Amato remained personally devoted to Dole, but Finkelstein and the NRSC team urged Republican Senate candidates to cut loose from unpopular national leaders and carve their own individual profiles on issues.Rosenbaum, David, \\"G.O.P. Hopes for Senate Ride on Pollster's Tactics\\", The New York Times, October 27, 1996. D'Amato remained a champion fundraiser and the committee found new legal ways to deliver assistance to Senate campaigns and local parties. The NRSC paid particular attention to blunting the wave of millionaire political unknowns (e.g., Tom Bruggere in Oregon, Elliott Close in South Carolina) recruited that year by the Democrats.Schantz, Harvey, Politics in an Era of Divided Government: The Election of 1996 and its Aftermath, pp. 93-99; accessed August 26, 2017. It shored up many endangered incumbents, including Bob Smith (New Hampshire), John Warner (Virginia), 75-year-old Jesse Helms (North Carolina) and 94-year-old Strom Thurmond (South Carolina).Kurtz, Howard, \\"GOP CONSULTANT'S STRATEGY: LABEL OPPONENTS LIBERALLY\\", The Washington Post, October 22, 1996. On Election Night, as Clinton defeated Dole by nearly 9 points and Gingrich's House Republicans lost a net 8 seats, Senate Republicans won open seats in Alabama, Arkansas and Nebraska, while losing South Dakota. In a poor GOP year, the D'Amato-Finkelstein NRSC had gained a net 2 seats (and narrowly missed another gain in the Max Cleland - Guy Millner race in Georgia).Shepard, Steven, \\"GOP campaign guru Arthur Finkelstein dies at 72\\", Politico, August 19, 2017. Finkelstein was not a consultant to the Dole Presidential campaign, despite his closeness to several of its top staffers. But, in the election's waning days, Time magazine reporter Erik Pooley detected the New Yorker's influence on strategy, writing: > For Arthur Finkelstein, this week might have been a vindication: Bob Dole > finally started labeling Bill Clinton a \\"spend-and-tax liberal,\\" using a > crude but often effective strategy known as \\"Finkel-think\\" by some Dole > advisers, because the secretive Republican strategist has been deploying it > on behalf of his clients for 20 years ...

Bob Smith survived with a 49% plurality win. New Jersey Congressman Dick Zimmer was defeated in his Senate bid against Robert Torricelli.Orr, J. Scott, \\"Hired guns add fire to Senate race\\", Star-Ledger, October 27, 1996. Earlier in 1996, he also helped Benjamin Netanyahu oust Shimon Peres as Prime Minister of Israel in a close upset. According to The Jerusalem Post, \\"Finkelstein was largely responsible for the strategy that brought Netanyahu victory in the 1996 general elections.\\"Shimon, Kamoun, It's Sad To Be the Mayor of Jerusalem, The Jerusalem Post, November 10, 2008. According to the Times of Israel, \\"Finkelstein was behind the \\"Peres will divide Jerusalem\\" slogan that helped Netanyahu overcome Shimon Peres who had been forecast to sweep to power in the wake of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin the previous November. That election was credited with changing the tone of Israeli campaigns, bringing more American-style, aggressive and negative campaigning to Israel.\\"\\"Arthur Finklestein, strategist who helped Netanyahu to power, dies at 72\\", Times of Israel, August 19, 2017. But his expertise helped in subtler ways as well; biographer Neill Lochery wrote in 2016 that Finkelstein was behind such ideas as dyeing Netanyahu's salt-and-pepper hair gray to give him a more statesmanlike appearance.Lochery, quoted by Fisher, Ben, in Jerusalem Post Online, November 24, 2016, \\"Books: Unstoppable Bibi\\" Jeff Barak of The Jerusalem Post, a harsh critic of Finkelstein and Netanyahu, called the strategist \\"the brains behind Netanyahu's first election victory in 1996. Netanyahu's campaign back then, from which he has never wavered, was that you're either for him or an enemy of the people. His campaign slogan at the time, 'Netanyahu is good for the Jews,' encapsulated this. By implication, if you're not for Netanyahu then you're not good for the Jews, and therefore an enemy. And if Netanyahu is good for the Jews, then this also not-so-subtly hints that Netanyahu's bad for the Arabs, regardless of the fact that they are supposedly citizens of equal standing who comprise around 20% of the country's population.\\"Barak, Jeff, \\"Reality Check: Which US Jew has really influenced today's Israel?\\" Jerusalem Post, May 8, 2017. But Finkelstein's greatest personal challenge that year came with the August issue of Boston magazine, which revealed his private life as a homosexual;Finnegan, Michael, \\"GOP GURU GAY, SEZ MAG\\", New York Daily News, September 13, 1996. the ostensible excuse for the outing was that several Finkelstein clients had voted against gay- rights measures in Congress, and his work to elect them was therefore inconsistent and/or hypocritical. In September, D'Amato said, \\"I don't think a person's sexual orientation, his private life ‚Äî a person's private life should be brought up and I think the question is offensive, it's wrong. He's a wonderful, decent person and whatever his sexual orientation is, that's his business.\\" Back to New York, 1997‚Äì98 Finkelstein's next two years anchored him again in New York, for the simultaneous re-election campaigns of Senator D'Amato and Governor Pataki in 1998. The contests were as different as the candidates themselves, with the calm, earnest Pataki winning high approval ratings and discouraging stronger Democrats from challenging him. New Yorkers' approval of Republican executives was signaled with the landslide re-election of Giuliani as Mayor in November 1997.Firestone, David, \\"THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE VOTERS; Big Victory, but Gains For Mayor Are Modest\\", The New York Times, November 6, 1997. Finkelstein crafted a highly positive campaign for Pataki, focusing on fulfillment of promises from 1994 (e.g., tax cuts) and policy innovations (the STAR tax program for seniors\\"Homeowner Tax Cuts in New York\\", The New York Times, December 14, 1997.) Raising $21 million, Pataki defeated New York City Council President Peter Vallone by 21 percentage points, polling 54.3%, the largest share by a Republican for Governor since Nelson Rockefeller in 1958.Perez-Pena, Richard, \\"THE 1998 ELECTIONS: NEW YORK STATE -- THE GOVERNOR; Pataki Wins Election to a Second Term by a Hefty Margin\\", The New York Times, November 4, 1998. D'Amato was another matter; since his narrow victory in 1992, his profile had grown more partisan Republican in this still- heavily Democratic state. Summoning First Lady Hillary Clinton to testify before his Senate committee in 1995,Weiss, Philip, \\"The Senator Cannot Help Being Himself\\", The New York Times, March 3, 1996. and aggressive campaigning for Dole in 1996,\\"D'Amato to Support Dole in '96\\", The New York Times, March 7, 1996. damaged D'Amato in a state where Bill Clinton crushed the Kansan by nearly 2-to-1 (59.5% to 30.6%), doubling his 1992 margin over Bush. D'Amato's decision to divorce his wife after a long separation\\"D'Amato and Wife Granted a Divorce\\", The New York Times, April 8, 1995. and announce his engagement to a young socialiteBarron, James, \\"D'Amato Says He's in Love. He Must Be: She's a Democrat\\", The New York Times, February 22, 1995. did not help his favorable ratings, while others recalled his mock-Japanese impression of O.J. Simpson case Judge Lance Ito in 1995 (for which he was forced to apologize on the Senate floor).Henneberger, Melinda, \\"D'Amato Gives A New Apology On Ito Remarks\\", The New York Times, April 7, 1995. D'Amato raised a record $26 million for the 1998 campaign, and Finkelstein went to work early shoring up his client's \\"Senator Pothole\\" image of close attention to local needs and the problems of individual New Yorkers (as he had done successfully in 1992).Stanley, Alessandra, \\"Senator Pothole's Ultimate Race; Al D'Amato Runs as the Big Guy for All Those Little Guys\\", The New York Times, October 19, 1992. State polls showed a swing back to such issues as health care and social concerns, which needed to be addressed. The tagline of these ads: \\"Al D'Amato Cares, Al D'Amato Makes a Difference, Al D'Amato Gets Things Done.\\"Berkowitz, Harry, \\"Riding the Airwaves, D'Amato Hones Image\\", Newsday, August 28, 1998. The Democratic primary was ultimately between Queens politician Geraldine Ferraro and U.S. Representative Charles Schumer of Brooklyn. Finkelstein prepared for both eventualities. When Schumer won by a surprisingly large margin, he immediately began ads that raised questions about the candidate's work ethic. (As Congressman, Schumer had missed an inordinate number of committee meetings.)Siegel, Joel. \\"Attending to Issues: Al Scolds Chuck For Votes He Missed in House\\", New York Daily News, October 22, 1998. The unexpected line of attack stymied the Democrat in late September and early October, and despite his weaknesses D'Amato gamely held onto a lead.Albany Times-Union poll, cited in New York Post, October 24, 1998, \\"PUTZ' CHUCK ; SAYS AL LIED ABOUT IT ; D'AMATO GIVES BRUSHOFF: \\"IT FITS' by ROBERT HARDT Jr. & GREGG BIRNBAUM All this collapsed in late October, after a remarkable show of hubris and bad judgment at a closed-door meeting with Jewish supporters in Brooklyn. First, D'Amato did a waddling impression of then-obese Democratic U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler.Halbfinger, David, \\"THE 1998 CAMPAIGN -- THE SENATE; D'Amato Says He's Sorry, but Not to Schumer\\", The New York Times, October 23, 1998. Later in the meeting, he referred to Schumer as a \\"putzhead\\" (a mangling of the Yiddish vulgarism \\"putz\\"). He later denied using this characterization, during questions from reporters (but was swiftly contradicted by his own supporters, present at the meeting, including Ed Koch).Nagourney, Adam, \\"THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: THE SENATE; Schumer Fires Counterattack at D'Amato on the Holocaust\\", The New York Times, October 22, 1998. Film of the denial was turned into a Schumer TV ad within days.Harden, Blaine, \\"The Gaffe Heard 'Round N.Y.; D'Amato Campaign Slowed By His Insult of Schumer\\", The Washington Post, October 28, 1998. Finkelstein's tracking survey the night of D'Amato's \\"putzhead\\" comment showed the senator leading Schumer by 10 points with two weeks to go. But the meltdown was quick and decisive, especially among Jewish voters,Birnbaum, Gregg & Robert Hardt, Jr., New York Post, November 4, 1998, \\"Too Many Flubs Doomed D'Amato\\" with Schumer's ads relentlessly driving the message of D'Amato's dishonesty and dislikeability. The Democrat's closing tagline was itself a homage to Finkelstein: \\"D'Amato: Too many lies for too long.\\" Schumer won, 54.6% to 44.1%‚Äîa 20-point turnaround.Brand, Rick, Newsday, November 4, 1998, \\"ELECTION '98 / Schumer Topples Senator D'Amato / 'The battle is over,' incumbent concedes\\" In other races that year, Sen. Lauch Faircloth‚Äîwho had earlier replaced Finkelstein for his 1998 reelection campaign in North Carolina ‚Äî brought him back into the fold in the closing weeks of the race. (Faircloth ultimately lost a close contest to Democrat John Edwards.) Later clients and campaigns, 1999‚Äì2017 =International= In the 2000s, Finkelstein spent more time working overseas than in previous decades, with clients in Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Kosovo, Ukraine and Azerbaijan (the last, in coordination with George Birnbaum.Azerbaijan News Gazette, October 4, 2016, \\"EU Reporter: Polls show occupied region is main concern in Azerbaijan\\") He continued to consult in Israeli elections, working again for Benjamin Netanyahu in 1999, Ariel Sharon (whom he helped become Prime Minister in 2001), and finally Avigdor Lieberman and his Yisrael Beytenu party. =Florida= Having twice steered Connie Mack III to Senate victories in 1988 and 1994, Finkelstein was in demand for the 2000 Florida contest upon Mack's retirement. His candidate was 10-term Congressman Bill McCollum, and he helped clear the Republican field early in anticipation of a tough general election against Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson.Bousquet, Steve, Miami Herald, November 1, 2000, \\"MCCOLLUM USES \`L-WORD,' CALLS NELSON A LIBERAL\\" It was a nail-biter with many echoes of the 1988 Senate campaign, but with a different outcome. As enthusiasm among Republican voters faltered in the final days (after revelations of George W. Bush's 1976 DUI conviction), GOP coattails and McCollum's slim lead disappeared, and Nelson was elected, 51% to 46%.Scammon, Richard et al, America Votes 24 : a handbook of contemporary American election statistics, 2000 (CQ Press, 2001) McCollum ran for the other Florida Senate seat on Democrat Bob Graham's retirement in 2004, but succumbed to eventual Senator Mel Martinez after low fundraising allowed the challenger to overcome his early lead.Caputo, Marc, Miami Herald, July 25, 2004,\\"IN U.S. SENATE RACE, ADS GO LONG WAY, BUT TIME IS SHORT\\" But McCollum was more successful in 2006, when he was the consensus GOP choice for Attorney General, and defeated Democrat Skip Campbell, 52.7% to 47.3%, polling well in a poor year for Republicans.St. Petersburg Times, January 28, 2009, \\"THE BUZZ: FLORIDA POLITICS\\" In 2009 and 2010, Finkelstein helmed McCollum's campaign for Florida Governor, where he was the favorite of the state's GOP Establishment.St. Petersburg Times, May 12, 2010, \\"THE BUZZ: FLORIDA POLITICS\\" These plans were upended by the surprise candidacy of wealthy businessman Rick Scott, whose bottomless spending that year ($75 million from his personal coffers) led to a furious contest for the nomination. McCollum fought gamely, but lost the bid to Scott, 43.5% to 46.3%, who went on to win election to the Statehouse that November against Democrat Alex Sink.Cook, Rhodes, America Votes 29 : a handbook of contemporary American election statistics, 2010 (CQ Press, 2011) A 2004 open seat in Florida's 14th Congressional District allowed Finkelstein to help create a political dynasty, as he steered State Rep. Connie Mack IV to a narrow victory in a four-way primary, then general-election wins in 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010.News-Press, The (Fort Myers, FL), July 17, 2008, \\"Mack prevails in fundraising\\" Finkelstein served as strategist for Mack's Senate campaign in 2012;Leary, Alex, Tampa Bay Times, July 12, 2012, \\"NATIONAL SUPER PACS AIM BLITZ AT NELSON \\" a late entrant in the primary, the Congressman won the GOP nomination with 58%, but was defeated by incumbent Bill Nelson by a million votes in the Obama re-election year.Cook, Rhodes, America Votes 30 : a handbook of contemporary American election statistics, 2012 (Sage Press, 2013) (Mack IV later became a lobbyist, whose clients included the government of Hungary, whose leader Viktor Orb√°n was a leading Finkelstein client in the 2010s.)Novak, Benjamin, Budapest Beacon, December 13, 2016, \\"Connie Mack IV says blue skies and sunshine in store for US-Hungary relations,\\" Accessed thru https://budapestbeacon.com/connie-mack-iv-says-blue-skies-sunshine-store-us- hungary-relations/ =New York= Pataki's third gubernatorial campaign, in 2002, provided some fresh challenges to Finkelstein, including a contest for the Conservative Party of New York State nomination, a still-shrinking Republican base, and a strong third-party challenge from millionaire B. Thomas Golisano, running again on the Independence Party line.Dicker, Frederic U., New York Post, November 6, 2002, \\"WINNERS AND LOSERS\\" Finkelstein positioned Pataki as an economic conservative but far more moderate on social and spending issues than in previous campaigns. This shift won the endorsement of influential union leaders such as Dennis Rivera and Randi Weingarten.Rau, Jordan, Newsday, October 11, 2002, \\"Hardball-Playing Pataki Hits All Bases\\" Pataki enjoyed a 15-point victory, polling 48.3% to 32.7% for state Comptroller H. Carl McCall, and 14% for Golisano.Scammon, Richard et al, America Votes 25 : a handbook of contemporary American election statistics, 2002 (CQ Press, 2003) Finkelstein tried to make use of Pataki's likely coattails by helming the campaign of David Cornstein for the state Comptroller slot being vacated by McCall. Cornstein, a successful businessman and Giuliani's appointed chief of Off-Track Betting, brought personal resources and a strong finance team to the table.Jones, Thai, Newsday, June 6, 2001, \\"State Comptroller Race Grows\\" He was a longtime ally of both the Mayor and Governor, with a City/Long Island base and unusual appeal as a Jewish Republican running as a moderate-conservative.Humbert, Marc, AP story in Albany Times Union, August 5, 2001, \\"SPENDING IS ALREADY REVVING UP FOR 2002\\" But party regulars instead fell in decisively behind former Upstate Assemblyman John Faso, a onetime legislative leader for the GOP minority, and Cornstein abandoned his run in 2001. (Faso further failed to expand his appeal beyond the limited Republican base, losing with 46.5% in November 2002; in his subsequent 2006 bid for Governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer crushed him, Faso polling just 29.2%.)Scammon, Richard et al, America Votes 27 : a handbook of contemporary American election statistics, 2006 (CQ Press, 2007) In 2017, Cornstein was named U.S. Ambassador to Hungary. Back in New York, Finkelstein in April 2005, Finkelstein announced the organization of Stop Her Now, a 527 committee dedicated to defeating then-Senator Hillary Clinton in the 2006 New York U.S. Senate race. Clinton sailed to an easy re-election, and the PAC was not a factor in the contest.Weigel, David, \\"It takes an agenda: conservatives cannot live by Hillary-hate alone\\", The American Conservative, October 22, 2007. In the titanic struggle over new stadium construction on Manhattan's West Side, Finkelstein was hired to defeat the proposal by Cablevision, MSG and its allies;Janison, Dan, Newsday, May 23, 2005, \\"CITY HALL: Stadium a bonanza for insiders\\" they ultimately prevailed, and the new Yankee Stadium was instead built in the Bronx, next to the old ballfield site, opening in 2009. It was the only time that the Finkelstein firm filed disclosure forms as a lobbyist (the filer was Ronald Finkelstein, not Arthur).New York City lobbying filings, Calendar Year 2005. Finkelstein advised former Congressman Rick Lazio during his campaign for the 2010 Republican nomination for New York Governor.:Press & Sun-Bulletin (Binghamton, NY), July 25, 2010, \\"Money crucial in governor's race\\" Lazio lost the GOP nomination contest to businessman Carl Paladino. =North Carolina= Finkelstein continued to partner with Carter Wrenn on Tar Heel State races after the demise of the National Congressional Club. In 2000, former Charlotte mayor (and UNC basketball star) Richard Vinroot sought the Governorship, to succeed the term-limited Democrat Jim Hunt. Vinroot won a contested fight for the GOP nomination,Squitieri, Tom & Welch, William M., USA Today, May 1, 2000, \\"Primary voters to set up key state races this week\\" but the drop in Republican-voter enthusiasm in the closing days (noted above in Florida) hurt here as well, and Vinroot was defeated by Mike Easley, 44.2% to 52.4%. In one of Finkelstein's last major races before his death, he worked with Wrenn in 2016 to win a spirited primary fight between two sitting Congressmen -- George Holding and Renee Ellmers. Wrenn had helped Ellmers pull one of the shocking House upsets of the 2010 election, but she abandoned the veteran consultant after her swearing-in and allied herself closely with House GOP leaders. In this primary, Wrenn backed Holding (a former US Attorney he'd guided to victory in 2012 and 2014), after a court- ordered redistricting combined the constituencies of the two suburban-Raleigh members. Aided by Wrenn's management and Finkelstein's polling and advice, Holding crushed Ellmers, 53.4% to 23.6%, and went on to a 56% re-election in November against Democrat John P. McNeil. =Other States and Presidential= In Delaware, Finkelstein continued as pollster in 2000 to Senator Bill Roth, but the 30-year lawmaker fell to a 56%-44% defeat that November to Thomas Carper.Campaigns & Elections, May 2000 (Vol 21; Issue 4), \\"2000 Senatorial Races: Campaign Consultant Roundup\\" Texas businessman David Dewhurst first approached Finkelstein in 1993 about running for Governor; he advised Dewhurst against challenging George W. Bush, who stormed to victory a year later. In 1998, he shepherded the millionaire to victory for the post of state Land Commissioner,Kuempel, George, Dallas Morning News, November 4, 1998, \\"GOP's Dewhurst wins land commissioner race: Businessman defeats state Rep. Raymond\\" then to two successive wins in 2002 and 2006 for the job of Lieutenant Governor.Hoppe, Christy, Dallas Morning News, May 16, 2002, \\"GOP practicing the 'liberal' arts: Republicans paste tag on Democrats who prefer middle of road\\" In 2012, Finkelstein worked against Dewhurst in the U.S. Senate primary, polling for the campaign of former ESPN broadcaster Craig James.Gromer Jeffers Jr., Dallas Morning News, March 15, 2012, \\"Texas GOP candidates for U.S. Senate prepare for Thursday debate\\" Finkelstein also served as pollster for the 2004 primary challenge by conservative Pennsylvania Congressman Pat Toomey against moderate incumbent Sen. Arlen Specter,Roll Call, April 29, 2010, \\"Wealthy Businessman Hires Media Recluse\\" pairing with strategist Jon Lerner.Hagstrom, Jerry, National Journal, November 4, 2010, \\"The GOP's Smiling Consultants\\" Specter averted defeat narrowly only after massive assistance from the NRSC and Bush White House (and then switched parties after the 2008 election); Toomey was elected to Specter's seat in 2010 and 2016. In 2005, Finkelstein polled for the gubernatorial campaign of Doug Forrester in New Jersey; he was defeated by Jon Corzine.Murphy, Dan, Star-Ledger, September 6, 2005, \\"NEW JERSEY -- GAME ON, GLOVES OFF\\" Connie Mack IV's 2007 marriage to Congresswoman Mary Bono led to Finkelstein's aiding her sharply contested (but successful) California campaign in November 2008, defeating Democrat Julie Bornstein in Obama's triumphant year. Bono finally lost in 2012, after her Riverside County seat was redistricted, falling to Raul Ruiz.Desert Sun, September 23, 2012, \\"Political Insider: Poll: Ruiz closing in on Bono Mack\\" Finkelstein returned to New Hampshire in 2009-10, taking on the insurgent campaign of Bill Binnie for the GOP Senate nomination. Binnie was defeated by former Attorney General Kelly Ayotte, who went on to election that November. In May 2011, Finkelstein told an audience in Prague that three presidential candidates had asked him to serve as pollster on their campaign for the 2012 Republican nomination, and he had turned all three down. (He further noted that Ron Paul was not one of those three.)  Campaign style and reviews  Finkelstein was known for his hard-edged political campaigns, which often focused on a single message with great repetition. He is credited with helping to make \\"liberal\\" a dirty word in the United States during the late 1980s and 1990s through the use of commercial messages such as this, intended to damage the image of Jack Reed: While often successful (as with NCPAC's attacks on seemingly moderate Democrats, or the D'Amato and Pataki campaigns in New York), Finkelstein's tactics sometimes backfired ‚Äì in 1996, his repeated attacks against Minnesota U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone (calling him \\"Embarrassingly liberal. Decades out of touch.\\") may have helped galvanize Wellstone's liberal grass-roots base. Republican Sen. Rod Grams eventually condemned Finkelstein's negative ads against Wellstone as excessive; however, his client (former Sen. Rudy Boschwitz) came closer that year than any GOP challenger to defeating a Democratic incumbent.United States Senate elections, 1996 Finkelstein refused the notion he engaged in negative campaigning, a phrase he said connotes false accusations: \\"It just means that you speak about the failings of your opponent as opposed to the virtues of your candidate\\"‚Äîa strategy he called \\"rejectionist voting\\"‚Äîa formula based on slogans that disparaged adversaries. Time magazine in October 1996 reported the Liberal- branding strategy was dubbed \\"Finkel-think\\" by leading Bob Dole advisers, and the presidential nominee was (belatedly) employing it against President Bill Clinton. Political scientist Darrell M. West, in 1996 said \\". . .He uses a sledgehammer in every race ... I've detected five phrases he uses ‚Äî ultraliberal, superliberal, embarrassingly liberal, foolishly liberal and unbelievably liberal.\\" Philip Friedman, a Manhattan consultant who got his start working for Finkelstein's frequent Democratic rival David Garth, described the pollster as \\"the ultimate sort of Dr. Strangelove, who believes you can largely disregard what the politicians are going to say and do, what the newspapers are going to do, and create a simple and clear and often negative message, which, repeated often enough, can bring you to victory\\". Republican strategist Roger Ailes, who worked with Finkelstein on numerous races in the 1980s, described \\"Art\\" as \\"a polling guy with creative talents\\", John Fossel, chairman of Oppenheimer Funds, characterized him as \\"basically sort of a mad scientist\\". Finkelstein polled in Fossel's unsuccessful Republican Congressional campaign in Westchester County in 1982. \\"We had a knock-down, drag-out over whether busing was an issue in Westchester. His polls told him it was. I said, 'I don't think it is, but if it is, it isn't to me,' and we didn't use it.\\" Carter Wrenn, who worked on Republican campaigns for 44 years with Finkelstein in North Carolina, called him \\"one of the most creative people I have ever worked with ... He is brilliant in terms of analyzing polls and numbers. He has a unique combination of an analytical and creative mind ... This guy's a workaholic. He must work 18 hours a day ... If you need him, he comes.\\" Tom Ellis, cofounder of the National Congressional Club said \\"Just knock on his head, and he'll give you an idea.\\" In 1990, Randall Rothenberg of The New York Times documented the rise of political and other ads intended to create controversy (in and of themselves), as well as to persuade. While Roger Ailes was credited by some as pioneering the tactic, \\"other Washington political hands give credit to Finkelstein, another Republican consultant, who deployed numerous news-generating commercials in his 1982 work for the National Conservative Political Action Committee.\\"Rothenberg, Randall, New Yoirk Times News Service, published in the Toronto Globe and Mail, January 9, 1990, \\"Controversial ads aimed at attracting news coverage\\" Finkelstein's early style is described in an scholarly account of a Congressional primary race in Arizona, published in 1979 in the \\"Quarterly Journal of Speech\\". Finkelstein gave advice to political candidates or elected officials to perform the \\"dance of the honest man\\", a metaphor for responding to \\"questions about transparency, honesty, or integrity\\" by imagining oneself as a typical, honest voter. Britain's Daily Telegraph credited Finkelstein with using polling data to pinpoint the division of Jerusalem as an issue over which Israelis would reject a deal with the Palestinians, during the 1996 election in Israel. The newspaper attributed Benjamin Netanyahu's victory in part to Finkelstein's \\"scare- mongering\\".Colvile, Robert, The world is spinning on the hustlers' axis, The Daily Telegraph, August 16, 2008, p. 24  Other businesses  Finkelstein's office shared a small building with Diversified Research, a separate but related firm that executes telephone surveys and packages their results for political and business consultants (including some media pollsters).Associated Press, October 27, 1988, \\"Presidential Dead Heat in New York\\" The firm, long based in Irvington, New York, had formerly been located in nearby Mount Kisco.

In his final years he increasingly distanced himself personally from social conservative elements within the Republican Party (while nevertheless still working for many conservative candidates). In a 1979 interview, he denied he was \\"a hard-core right-winger,\\" but noted there was hardly \\"a serious conservative over the last 10 years [i.e. 1969-79] whom I haven't been involved with.\\" Finkelstein died of lung cancer on August 18, 2017, aged 72, in Ipswich, Massachusetts.

The colloquial \\"caught red-handed\\" and \\"caught rapid\\" are English equivalents. Aside from the legal meaning, the Latin term is often used colloquially as a euphemism for someone's being caught in the midst of sexual activity.  Etymology  The phrase combines the present active participle flagrƒÅns (flaming or blazing) with the noun dƒìlictum (offence, misdeed, or crime). In this term the Latin preposition in, not indicating motion, takes the ablative. The closest literal translation would be \\"in blazing offence\\", where \\"blazing\\" is a metaphor for vigorous, highly visible action.  Worldwide  = Latin America = In many Latin American countries, being caught in flagrante () is a common legal requirement for both detention and search and seizure. Naturally, being caught in flagrante makes convictions easier to obtain; in some jurisdictions where the police are not adept at investigation and the use of forensic science is not widespread, it may be difficult to get a conviction any other way. On occasion, governments with such constitutional requirements have been accused of stretching the definition of in flagrante in order to carry out illegal arrests.Tweet contains scan of official communication (in Spanish) of the Government of Bolivia.

He is known for his work on time travel and the Doomsday argument.  Exotic matter time travel theories  Paul Davies's bestseller How to Build a Time Machine credits Gott with the proposal of using cosmic strings to create a time machine. Gott's machine depends upon the antigravitational tension of the (hypothetical) strings to deform space without attracting nearby objects. The traveler would follow a precise path around rapidly separating strings, and find that he or she had moved backwards in time. Gott's solution does require that the strings are infinitely long, though: a theorem by Stephen Hawking proves that according to general relativity, closed timelike curves cannot be created in a finite region of space unless there is exotic matter present which violates certain energy conditions, while cosmic strings would not be expected to violate these conditions, so strings of finite length wouldn't work.Thorne, Kip S. (1993), Closed Timelike Curves, pp. 9-10.Everett, Allen E. (1995), Warp Drive and Causality , p. 7368. Gott also proposed a \\"time mirror\\": a time travel device based on the principle of time delays. The device would be situated near a black hole some hundred or more light years from Earth. The device would act as a light collector and would power the light rays deformed and curved by the gravitational depression of the black hole. The collector would then reveal the past as detailed by the photons that had originated from Earth. Since Gott believes that time travel is not cosmologically excluded, he has presented the possibility that the universe was created out of itself (at a later time). This controversial suggestion was published with Li-Xin Lin, and it was described by Gott as \\"it would be like having one branch of a tree circle around and grow up to be the trunk. In that way, the universe could be its own mother.\\" In his own book, Time Travel in Einstein's Universe: The Physical Possibilities of Travel Through Time, Gott argues that travel to the past is quite possible, although probably only after the construction of a working device (during its existence), and certainly not onto the time traveler's own past timeline (he argues that either the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics must be invoked to overcome the Grandfather paradox, or that all time travel remain self-consistent, i.e., one can visit the past but not change it, as in the Novikov self-consistency principle). Although he is keen to emphasize that time travel itself is a commonplace physical phenomenon, by this he means time travel into the future at varying rates through special relativity, he is not completely committed on the subject of time travel to the past. The book does say that nothing known excludes such travel, but he doesn't completely rule out the possibility that future research may prove it impossible.  Copernicus method and Doomsday theory  Gott first thought of his \\"Copernicus method\\" of lifetime estimation in 1969 when stopping at the Berlin Wall and wondering how long it would stand. Gott postulated that the Copernican principle is applicable in cases where nothing is known; unless there was something special about his visit (which he didn't think there was) this gave a 75% chance that he was seeing the wall after the first quarter of its life. Based on its age in 1969 (8 years), Gott left the wall with 50% confidence that it wouldn't be there in 1993 (1969 + 8¬∑(1.5/0.5)). In fact, the wall was brought down in 1989, and 1993 was the year in which Gott applied his \\"Copernicus method\\" to the lifetime of the human race. His paper in Nature was the first to apply the Copernican principle to the survival of humanity; His original prediction gave 95% confidence that the human race would last for between 5100 and 7.8 million years. (Brandon Carter's alternative form of the Doomsday argument was delivered earlier that year, but Gott's derivation was independent.) He made a major effort subsequently to defend his form of the Doomsday argument from a variety of philosophical attacks, and this debate (like the feasibility of closed time loops) is still ongoing. To popularize the Copernicus method, Gott gave The New Yorker magazine a 95% confidence interval for the closing time of forty-four Broadway and Off Broadway productions based only on their opening dates. Education work He received the President's Award for Distinguished Teaching in acknowledgment of his work on the National Westinghouse/Intel Science Talent Search high school student science competition. He is an active promoter of the public awareness of science at the popular level, and Princeton students have voted him the school's outstanding professor several times. Gott is a Presbyterian who distinguishes physical from meta-physical questions by their teleology; he believes that his writings are entirely scientific (not trespassing into theology) because the motivation for the way things are (or might be) is never examined.

Historically part of Staffordshire, the village had a population of 741 at the 2011 census.  Amenities  Arley Severn Valley Railway station The Arley railway station on the Severn Valley Railway, one of Britain's preserved steam railways, has been used in many films and television programmes (including the BBC's Oh, Doctor Beeching!). The station was opened in 1862 and closed by British Railways in 1963. It was reopened by the SVR in 1974. The village also has one pub, a tearoom and a post office with shop.  History  Upper Arley used to be in Staffordshire, but was transferred to Worcestershire in 1895. The parish is unusual in being divided into two unequal parts by the river Severn. Woodeaves (west of the river) was only linked to the rest of the parish by a foot ferry, which was replaced in 1972 by a footbridge.River Severn tales by Chris Witts The manor of Upper Arley had various owners before 1276, when it was bought by Roger de Mortimer in 1276. It passed down his family, who held the title Earl of March until 1448 when Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York sold it. It was bought by William Burley, whose daughter Joan married Thomas Lyttleton, whose descendants (spelling their name Lyttelton) also owned Hagley Hall and became Barons Lyttelton until the death of Thomas Lyttelton, 2nd Baron Lyttelton in 1779, when it passed to his sister Lucy and her husband, Arthur Annesley, 8th Viscount Valentia, later Earl of Mountnorris.Victoria County History, Worcestershire III (1913), 5-10 Arley manor Date accessed: 13 January 2010. The manor was held by the Woodward family from 1853 to 1959. Captain Robert Woodward was killed in World War I in 1915. On the death of Sir Chad Woodward, on 2 February 1957, most of the estate was sold off for death duties.

In the late 20th century, it was owned by the philanthropist and iron & steel tycoon Roger Turner, who bought the estate after selling his family's Staffordshire tubemaking businesses, called the Wellington Steel Tube Co.

Domestic Operations Branch. News Bureau, 1943 Edward Franklin Frazier (; September 24, 1894 ‚Äì May 17, 1962), was an American sociologist and author, publishing as E. Franklin Frazier. His 1932 Ph.D. dissertation was published as a book titled The Negro Family in the United States (1939); it analyzed the historical forces that influenced the development of the African-American family from the time of slavery to the mid-1930s. The book was awarded the 1940 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for the most significant work in the field of race relations. It was among the first sociological works on blacks researched and written by a black person. In 1948 Frazier was elected as the first black president of the American Sociological Association. He published numerous other books and articles on African- American culture and race relations. In 1950 Frazier helped draft the UNESCO statement The Race Question. Frazier wrote a dozen books in his lifetime, including The Black Bourgeoisie, a critique of the black middle class in which he questioned the effectiveness of African-American businesses to produce racial equality.  Biography  Frazier was born in Baltimore in 1894 as one of five children of James H. Frazier, a bank messenger, and Mary (Clark) Frazier, a homemaker. He attended the Baltimore public schools, which were legally segregated in those decades. Upon his graduation in 1912 from the Colored High and Training School in Baltimore (renamed in 1923 as Frederick Douglass High School), Frazier was awarded the school's annual scholarship to Howard University, a prominent historically black college. He graduated with honors from Howard in 1916. Frazier was a top scholar, pursuing Latin, Greek, German and mathematics. He also participated in extracurricular activities including drama, political science, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the Intercollegiate Socialist Society. He was elected as class president in both 1915 and 1916.\\"E. Franklin Frazier, Biography and bibliography\\", Howard University Following graduation from Howard, Frazier attended Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he earned a master's degree in 1920. The topic of his thesis was New Currents of Thought Among the Colored People of America. During his time at Clark, Frazier first began to study sociology, combining his approach with his deep interest in African-American history and culture. Frazier spent 1920‚Äì1921 as a Russell Sage Foundation fellow at the New York School of Social Work (later part of Columbia University). Frazier taught sociology at Morehouse College, a historically black institution in Atlanta, where he established what is known in the 21st century as the Atlanta University School of Social Work. In 1927 Frazier published his article titled \\"The Pathology of Race Prejudice\\" in Forum. Using Freudian terms, he wrote that prejudice was \\"abnormal behavior,\\" characteristic of \\"insanity,\\" including dissociation, delusional thinking, rationalization, projection, and paranoia. White people in the South, he argued, were literally driven mad by the \\"Negro-complex,\\" to the point that \\"men and women who are otherwise kind and law-abiding will indulge in the most revolting forms of cruelty towards black people.\\"Edward Franklin Frazier, \\"The Pathology of Race Prejudice\\", Forum Archives, June 1927, full text online, accessed 11 October 2015 An Atlanta paper carried an editorial against Frazier's work, which indirectly publicized his article.Denise Velez, \\"E. Franklin Frazier and the pathology of race prejudice\\", The Motley Moose blog, 24 September 2013, accessed 11 October 2015 Already planning to move to Chicago, Frazier and his family left Atlanta early because of severe threats made against them due to the controversy and hostility among whites generated by his article. He had a fellowship from the University of Chicago's sociology department. His studies at Chicago culminated in his earning a Ph.D. in 1931. Frazier was also teaching at Fisk University during this period, from 1929 to 1934. That year he returned to Howard University, where he taught from 1934 until his death in 1962. After founding and leading the D.C. chapter of the American Sociological Association, Frazier was elected as its first black president in 1948. In his research and writing, Frazier adopted an approach that examined economic, political and attitudinal factors that shape the systems of social relationships. He continually pressed to find the \\"social reality\\" in any context he investigated. His stature was recognized by his election in 1948 as the first black president of the American Sociological Association. \\"He was established as the leading American scholar on the black family and was also recognized as a leading theorist on the dynamics of social change and race relations.\\"\\"E. Franklin Frazier and the Black Bourgeoisie\\"; About the Book, University of Missouri Press, accessed 11 October 2015 Frazier's position emphasized African-American cultural developments as a process of accommodation to new conditions in the Americas. Frazier's Black Bourgeoisie, the 1957 English translation of a work first published in French in 1955, was a critical examination of the adoption by middle-class African Americans of a subservient conservatism. His book received \\"mixed reviews and harsh criticism from the black middle and professional class. Yet Frazier stood solidly by his argument that the black middle class was marked by conspicuous consumption, wish fulfillment, and a world of make-believe.\\" Frazier published eight books, 89 articles and 18 chapters in books edited by others. Frazier died on May 17, 1962, age 67, in Washington, D.C. He has been ranked among the most important African Americans for his influence on institutions and practices to accept the demands by African Americans for economic, political and social equality in American life. Some of Frazier's writings generated controversy in the black community for their focus on the effects of slavery and how it divided the black family.NASW Celebrates Black History Month 2005! \\"Edward Franklin Frazier (1894‚Äì1962)\\".

He was a noted neuropathologist. Early life Nissl was born in Frankenthal to Theodor Nissl and Maria Haas. Theodor taught Latin in a Catholic school and wanted Franz to become a priest. However Franz entered the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich to study medicine. Later, he specialized in Psychiatry. One of Nissl's university professors was Bernhard von Gudden. His assistant, Sigbert Josef Maria Ganser suggested that Nissl write an essay on the pathology of the cells of the cortex of the brain. When the medical faculty offered a competition for a prize in neurology in 1884, Nissl undertook the brain-cortex study. He used alcohol as a fixative and developed a staining technique that allowed the demonstration of several new nerve-cell constituents. Nissl won the prize, and wrote his doctoral dissertation on the same topic in 1885. Biography of Franz Nissl, accessed 1 November 2009 Career in medical research and education Professor von Gudden was the judge in Nissl's college-essay competition, and he was so impressed with the study that he offered Nissl an assistantship at the Furstenried castle southwest of Munich, where one of his responsibilities would be to care for the mad Prince Otto. Nissl accepted, and remained in that post from 1885 until 1888. There was a small laboratory at the castle, which enabled Nissl to continue with his neuropathological research. In 1888 Nissl moved to the Institution Blankenheim. In 1889 he went to Frankfurt as second in position under Emil Sioli (1852‚Äì1922) at the St√§dtische Irrenanstalt. There he met neurologist Ludwig Edinger and neuropathologist Karl Weigert, who was developing a neuroglial stain. This work motivated Nissl to study mental and nervous diseases by relating them to observable changes in glial cells, blood elements, blood vessels and brain tissue in general. In Frankfurt Nissl became acquainted with Alois Alzheimer, and they collaborated over seven years. They became close friends,Nissl was Alzheimer's best man at the latter's wedding in April 1894 jointly editing the Histologische und histopathologische Arbeiten √ºber die Grosshirnrinde (1904‚Äì1921). In 1895 Emil Kraepelin invited Nissl to become assistant physician at the University of Heidelberg. By 1904 he was a full professor at that institution, and became director of the Department of Psychiatry when Kraepelin moved to Munich. Later life and death The burden of teaching and administration, combined with poor research facilities, forced Nissl to leave many scientific projects unfinished. He also suffered from a kidney disease. During World War I he was charged with administering a large military hospital. In 1918 Kraepelin again invited Nissl to accept a research position at the Deutsche Forschungsanstalt f√ºr Psychiatrie in Munich. After one year at that position, where he performed research alongside Korbinian Brodmann and Walther Spielmeyer, he died in 1919 of kidney disease. Personal Nissl was of small stature, with poor posture. He had a birthmark on his left face. He never married, and his life revolved entirely around his work.Biography One day, for a practical joke, Nissl (who was an active campaigner against human consumption of alcohol) placed a row of empty beer bottles outside his laboratory and made sure that Kraepelin heard that he could be found lying under his desk, dead drunk. Nissl was a competent pianist. Nazi physician Hugo Spatz (1888‚Äì1969) told of his first meeting, when Spatz applied for a position in Nissl's laboratory. Nissl was busy that morning and asked the student to come to his home at twelve. When Spatz came to the house at noon, Nissl was not there, and the housekeeper finally opined that the Professor must have meant twelve midnight, so Spatz returned that night. Nissl was at home then, but Spatz had to wait in the anteroom for half an hour until Nissl had finished the piano sonata that he was playing. The conversation lasted until daybreak. Legacy Nissl was possibly the greatest neuropathologist of his day and also a fine clinician who popularised the use of spinal puncture,Nissl's nickname among medical students of the day was \\"punctator maximus\\" which had been introduced by Heinrich Quincke. Nissl also examined the neural connections between the human cortex and thalamic nuclei; he was in the midst of this study at the time of his death. An example of his research philosophy is taken from his 1896 writings: :As soon as we agree to see in all mental derangements the clinical expression of definite disease processes in the cortex, we remove the obstacles that make impossible agreement among alienists. Image of a Nissl-stained histological section through the rodent hippocampus showing various classes of neurons. Named histology concepts The Nissl method refers to staining of the cell body, and in particular endoplasmic reticulum. This is done by using various basic dyes (e.g. aniline, thionine, or cresyl violet) to stain the negatively charged RNA blue, and is used to highlight important structural features of neurons. The Nissl substance (rough endoplasmic reticulum) appears dark blue due to the staining of ribosomal RNA, giving the cytoplasm a mottled appearance. Individual granules of extranuclear RNA are named Nissl granules (ribosomes). DNA present in the nucleus stains a similar color.

The USS McKee was a mobile support and repair facility with the capability of providing simultaneous repairs to 12 nuclear-powered & diesel, fast-attack submarines. A versatile and complex ship, she provided everything a submarine might need: full medical and dental facilities; cranes, elevators and conveyors to move material on and off the ship as well as between decks; large storage areas for refrigerated and dry food; nuclear system repair and testing; electrical and electronics repair; hull repair; sheet metal and steel work; pipe fabrication; foundry work; woodworking; printing; underwater diving and rescue; hazardous material management; and propulsion and weapons systems repair.All Hands article, April 1999 USS McKee was one of the first warships in the U.S. Navy to integrate female sailors. History =1981-1989= The ship was commissioned on 16 August 1981. After a series of sea trials, McKee replaced the and joined the at Point Loma (San Diego) to support Pacific Fleet submarines. Upon the commissioning of Submarine Squadron 11 (COMSUBRON11) in July 1986, she became the squadron's Command Ship. Early in 1984, McKee became the first submarine tender certified to support the new Tomahawk cruise missile system. McKee earned three consecutive Battle Efficiency \\"E\\" awards in 1985, 1986 and 1987. In addition to the Battle \\"E\\" in 1986, McKee was honored with the Golden Anchor Award for retention excellence and her first Meritorious Unit Commendation. In 1989, the McKee was the first submarine tender to visit Cold Bay, Alaska since World War II, and conducted the first nuclear submarine upkeep at this remote location. 1988 saw McKee become the first submarine tender certified to handle the Tomahawk Vertical Launch System (VLS). In February 1989 the McKee performed the first at-sea weapons transfer to a submarine since World War II, to the . =1990-1999= In March 1990, the McKee continued leading the way for submarine tenders by participating in the first underway fuel replenishment (UNREP) by a Pacific Fleet submarine tender. This fuel was in preparation for deployment to the Persian Gulf in January 1991. When Operation Desert Storm began, the McKee deployed to the Persian Gulf and spent six months providing support to submarines and surface combatants in Jebel Ali, just outside Dubai, United Arab Emirates. McKee was awarded a second Meritorious Unit Commendation and the Southwest Asia Service Medal. Following Desert Storm, McKee was awarded a fourth Battle Efficiency \\"E\\" Award. In 1995, after the decommissioning of USS Dixon, McKee provided all support to San Diego based submarines. Assistance was also provided to many Allied submarines while they visited Point Loma. In 1998, McKee earned a third Meritorious Unit Commendation following a six-month deployment to Pearl Harbor. During this deployment, McKee provided services and conducted repairs to both U.S. and Allied submarines and surface combatants. Upon returning to San Diego, the ship took the lead in establishing shore-based services that will support the submarines after McKee's departure. In November 1998, the weapons department of the USS McKee loaded Tomahawk cruise missiles onto . These were the first of 67 Tomahawk cruise missiles sold to the Royal Navy and the first British submarine to receive the Tomahawk missiles. They were later used by HMS Splendid in offensive operations against Serbian targets during the Kosovo War. On 1 October 1999, McKee was decommissioned from service and moved to the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility (NISMF), located in Portsmouth, Virginia. She was struck from the Naval Register on 25 April 2006.

She is perhaps best known for being a member of the ensemble on FOX's sketch comedy series Mad TV. Collins became well known for several characters during her tenure on the show. She was a cast member from the 4th season (1998) through the 9th season (2004); she only appeared in fourteen episodes during season 9 due to contractual reasons. She returned to Mad TV in the 10th season for one episode, and again when she made an appearance on the 300th episode doing her popular character Lorraine Swanson. Her best known role following her departure from Mad TV was as morning talk show host Joan Callamezzo on the sitcom Parks and Recreation. Career =Mad TV= Collins joined the cast of Mad TV at the beginning of season 4 (Fall 1998) and stayed until the end of season 9 (Spring 2004), despite appearing in only 14 episodes during the ninth season.

It carries the Bridgewater Canal across the Manchester Ship Canal. The swinging action allows large vessels using the ship canal to pass through and smaller craft, both narrowboats and broad-beam barges to cross over the top. The aqueduct, the first and only swing aqueduct in the world, is a Grade II* listed building, and considered a major feat of Victorian civil engineering. Designed by Sir Edward Leader Williams and built by Andrew Handyside and Company of Derby, the swing bridge opened in 1894 and remains in regular use. History The original Barton Aqueduct, shortly before its demolition in 1893 The Barton Swing Aqueduct is a direct replacement for the earlier Barton Aqueduct, a masonry structure crossing the River Irwell and completed in 1761. The construction of the Manchester Ship Canal in the 1890s necessitated the replacement of this structure, as the height of ships using the new ship canal was too great to pass under the old aqueduct. An alternative scheme involving the use of a double lock flight was rejected, because of the need to conserve water in the Bridgewater Canal above. The new aqueduct was designed by Sir Edward Leader Williams, engineer to the Manchester Ship Canal Company, and was built by Andrew Handyside and Company of Derby. The first barge crossed the new aqueduct on 21 August 1893, and it opened to commercial traffic on 1 January 1894. Williams was also involved with the Anderton Boat Lift, another moving canal structure in the region. Construction The swing aqueduct in open position. At this point transit through the Manchester Ship Canal is possible. Construction work began in 1890, with the demolition of a Roman Catholic school on the south bank of the ship canal. The scale of the operation meant that the course of the River Irwell had to be temporarily diverted around the site, so that the central island could be built on dry land. Operation The swing aqueduct in the closed position, showing the Bridgewater Canal crossing over the Ship Canal. The Barton Road Swing Bridge is on the right. The aqueduct is a form of swing bridge. When closed, it allows canal traffic to pass along the Bridgewater Canal. When large vessels need to pass along the ship canal underneath, the and long iron trough is rotated 90 degrees on a pivot mounted on a small purpose-built island. Gates at each end of the trough retain around 800 tonnes of water; additional gates on each bank retain water in their adjacent stretches of canal. The aqueduct originally had a suspended towpath along its length, about above the water level of the Bridgewater Canal, which has now been removed. The structure is adjacent to, and upstream of, the Barton Road Swing Bridge. Both bridges are operated from a brick control tower on an island in the centre of the ship canal. When in the open position, the aqueduct and road bridge line up along the length of the island, allowing ships to traverse each side. To avoid the risk of collision, the aqueduct is opened half an hour before traffic on the Manchester Ship Canal is scheduled to pass. Turning mechanism Two barriers are extended across the Bridgewater Canal before the bridge is swung. Here the inner barrier is only extended part way. The turning mechanism built into the central island consists of a race plate embedded in granite blocks. Sixty-four tapered cast iron rollers sat on top of the race plate, held in position by a spider ring. On top of that an upper race plate supports the aqueduct and its circular gear rack, which was powered by a hydraulic engine manufactured by Sir W. G. Armstrong Mitchell of Newcastle. To reduce the pressure on the turning mechanism, a hydraulic press was installed in the pivot. When water was admitted to the press it took up to half the weight. So successful was this system of hydraulic assistance that Leader Williams retrofitted it to several road swing bridges being built over the Ship Canal including the ones at Stockton Heath and Knutsford Road in Warrington. The weight of the structure meant that the design was pushing the limits of the possible. This became clear when the sixty-four 35.5 cm (14 inches) mean diameter hollow cast-iron rollers started to deform. By 1927 the structure had dropped by 8.89 cm (3 1/2-inches). In 1928 the iron rollers were replaced with steel and since then the bridge has dropped by only 2.4mm (3/32-inch). Once the iron rollers were replaced the hydraulic press assistance was dispensed with. Hydraulic power was originally supplied by steam from two Lancashire boilers housed in a pumping station on the Eccles bank of the ship canal; a service culvert beneath the bed of the canal conveyed the water under pressure to the control tower on the island. In 1939 the original hydraulic engines were replaced by a pair of radial three-cylinder engines manufactured by the Hydraulic Engineering Company of Chester, and the following year a power house was built on the island to house two electrically driven pumps. The old steam pumping station was demolished after the Second World War.

His daily Sun Sign Horoscope column appeared in more than 200 newspapers and his annual forecast books for each sign of the zodiac sold over 50 million copies.  Early life  Omarr was born Sidney Kimmelman in Philadelphia to a middle class Jewish family. His father worked as a grocer. In elementary school, he had a strong interest in magic performances, and he performed at talent shows and magic shops. Omarr decided to change his name when, at age 15, he saw a movie called Shanghai Gesture starring Victor Mature as a character named Omar, with one \\"r.\\" He had a strong interest in numerology, which led him to change Sidney to Sydney, and add an extra \\"r\\" to Omarr. From this interest in numerology he wrote several books, including Thought Dial, on the topic, but was unable to earn a living as a numerologist so he pursued to astrology. During World War II, Omarr, 17, joined the Army; he claimed he chose April 4, 1944 as the day to sign due to the numerological benefit of a date composed of \\"all fours.\\" Approximately a year later he was transferred to the Air Force at a base located in Ontario, California, approximately 35 miles east of Los Angeles and referred to as 'Camp Hollywood.' Omarr's claims that he was posted to Okinawa within a year of joining the Army are contradicted by the history of the Battle for Okinawa, which began in April 1945, and lasted until mid-June 1945 after massive casualties at the Battle of Okinawa. There was no \\"base\\" on Okinawa for any Armed Forces Radio Programming until after Japan had surrendered. Therefore, his claims that he was able to specialize in astrology with his weekly Armed Forces Radio Program Sydney Omarr's Almanac, broadcast throughout the Pacific Theatre, are highly suspect. He attempted to predict the results of various sporting contests and events. After gaining transfer to Camp Ontario in April 1945, Omarr was profiled by Wings, the Air Force's official counterpart to Stars and Stripes. In this semi-satirical profile, Omarr is quoted as predicting the Japanese defeat in \\"mid-August, 1945.\\" English Although the author of this piece subsequently stated that this quote was apocryphal and was part of the general satire, Omarr subsequently used it to promote his astrology career, ultimately gaining an influential column at the Los Angeles Times. Omarr also claimed he wrote the horoscope column for the U.S. Army's Stars and Stripes newspaper. Sydney Omarr Profile, May 30, 1945, WINGS, US Air Force, Page 3 Career as writer and media astrologer When Omarr completed his stint in the Army, he studied journalism at Mexico City College. This led to a decade as a reporter for the United Press, followed by employment with CBS Hollywood as an editor and radio news director. A journalist colleague at UP, Benson Srere, stated that Omarr was valued by his readers \\"not because they believe every word he wrote, but because it always contained threads of hope and encouragement.\\" Toward the end of his life, Omarr wrote a series of astrological guides published by Penguin called Sydney Omarr's Day-By-Day Astrological Guide. While he authored the books up until his death, his proteges have taken over the work, and Signet continues to publish the series. He believed he had been an astrologer in many previous lifetimes, and he was able to do full planetary horoscopes in his head when given an individual's birth coordinates and birth time. For his Los Angeles Times syndicate columns, he wrote each and every daily horoscope column personally, usually three weeks in advance. Omarr's first book was entitled Sydney Omarr's Private Course on Numerology, which he self-published and sold for $2.00. While he wrote numerous books on the subject of astrology, including My World of Astrology and his autobiography Answer in the Sky, he is probably the most widely known for his books on the popular sun sign astrology. This entailed a daily Sun Sign Horoscope column which appeared in more than 200 daily newspapers of the Los Angeles Times syndicate. Each year Omarr wrote 12 annual forecasts ‚Äì one for each sign of the zodiac and one overall book. These popular titles sold 50 million copies. Sydney Omarr wrote a short pocket book, \\"Secret Hints... For Men and Women\\", published by General Features Corporation. By the 1970s, Omarr appeared on various radio and television shows such as The Merv Griffin Show and Johnny Carson. He was friendly with famous movie actresses like Mae West and associated with authors like Henry Miller and Aldous Huxley. In 1966 he was married for eight months to Jeraldine Saunders, a former model, cruise director, and the creator of the Love Boat concept for ABC Television. Later years In 1971 Omarr was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and as the disease impacted his body he lost his sight in the early 1990s and became paralyzed from the neck down.

The title stands for \\"Background music\\". This album was produced by Haruomi Hosono. Recording started on January 15, 1981, in an effort to release the album by March 21, 1981. YMO was the first band to use the Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer, one of the first programmable drum machines, as early as 1980. This was their first studio album recorded with the Roland MC-4 Microcomposer and TR-808. Overview Alfa Records, YMO's record company, had installed a 3M 32-track digital recorder in its studio shortly before YMO started recording BGM. Since Hosono was not fond of its overly sharp sound quality, he recorded all the rhythm sections for BGM on a TASCAM 80-8 analog recorder first and copied them with the 3M machine, resulting in the fuller, much compressed rhythm tracks. Unfortunately, no known working samples of the 3M recorder exist in Japan today, making it quite difficult to play the master tape. One of the earliest uses of the TR-808 for a live performance was by Yellow Magic Orchestra in 1980 for the song \\"1000 Knives\\", an electro rendition of member Ryuichi Sakamoto's \\"Thousand Knives\\" (1978). The hand-clap sound was later publicized on this album, being used again on \\"1000 Knives\\" and in \\"Music Plans\\", another of Sakamoto's songs. Peter Barakan debuts as YMO's co-lyricist. Ryuichi Sakamoto was often absent from the BGM recording sessions on account of illness, and he turns in \\"Music Plans\\" as his only new composition for the album, since \\"1000 Knives\\" (from his 1978 debut album The Thousand Knives of Ryuichi Sakamoto) and \\"Happy End\\" were new recordings of his earlier materials. Another song, \\"Rap Phenomena\\", was an early attempt at electronic rap. \\"Loom\\" is a re-working of \\"The Infinite Space Octave\\" by YMO computer programmer Hideki Matsutake, and features a slow, upward glissando similar to the Deep Note, THX's audio logo. A similar sound was previously used by YMO members Haruomi Hosono and Ryuichi Sakamoto for their 1978 album Cochin Moon. Like most YMO albums, song titles were printed in both Japanese and English, as listed below. \\"Êù•„Åü„Çã„Åπ„Åç„ÇÇ„ÅÆ\\" more accurately translates to \\"What should come\\". Reception When released in 1981, the album's reception was positive. Stereo Review described the recording as \\"crystalline\\" and the performance as \\"the twain meet\\", praising the album for its \\"remarkable\\" blend between \\"East and West\\", its \\"catchy tunes\\", its \\"ambitious collection of electronics\\" and for \\"pushing at the frontiers of electronic rock\\", but noted that this affected the album's accessibility.

See Buffon's needle. to calculate the value of an option with multiple sources of uncertainty or with complicated features. The first application to option pricing was by Phelim Boyle in 1977 (for European options). In 1996, M. Broadie and P. Glasserman showed how to price Asian options by Monte Carlo. An important development was the introduction in 1996 by Carriere of Monte Carlo methods for options early exercise features. Methodology In terms of theory, Monte Carlo valuation relies on risk neutral valuation.Marco Dias: Real Options with Monte Carlo Simulation Here the price of the option is its discounted expected value; see risk neutrality and rational pricing. The technique applied then, is (1) to generate a large number of possible, but random, price paths for the underlying (or underlyings) via simulation, and (2) to then calculate the associated exercise value (i.e. \\"payoff\\") of the option for each path. (3) These payoffs are then averaged and (4) discounted to today. This result is the value of the option.Don Chance: Teaching Note 96-03: Monte Carlo Simulation This approach, although relatively straightforward, allows for increasing complexity: *An option on equity may be modelled with one source of uncertainty: the price of the underlying stock in question. Here the price of the underlying instrument \\\\ S_t \\\\, is usually modelled such that it follows a geometric Brownian motion with constant drift \\\\mu \\\\, and volatility \\\\sigma \\\\,. So: dS_t = \\\\mu S_t\\\\,dt + \\\\sigma S_t\\\\,dW_t \\\\, , where dW_t \\\\, is found via a random sampling from a normal distribution; see further under Black‚ÄìScholes. Since the underlying random process is the same, for enough price paths, the value of a european option here should be the same as under Black Scholes. More generally though, simulation is employed for path dependent exotic derivatives, such as Asian options. *In other cases, the source of uncertainty may be at a remove. For example, for bond optionsPeter Carr and Guang Yang: Simulating American Bond Options in an HJM Framework the underlying is a bond, but the source of uncertainty is the annualized interest rate (i.e. the short rate). Here, for each randomly generated yield curve we observe a different resultant bond price on the option's exercise date; this bond price is then the input for the determination of the option's payoff. The same approach is used in valuing swaptions,Carlos Blanco, Josh Gray and Marc Hazzard: Alternative Valuation Methods for Swaptions: The Devil is in the Details where the value of the underlying swap is also a function of the evolving interest rate. (Whereas these options are more commonly valued using lattice based models, as above, for path dependent interest rate derivatives ‚Äì such as CMOs ‚Äì simulation is the primary technique employed.Frank J. Fabozzi: Valuation of fixed income securities and derivatives, pg. 138) For the models used to simulate the interest-rate see further under Short-rate model; \\"to create realistic interest rate simulations\\" Multi-factor short-rate models are sometimes employed.Donald R. van Deventer (Kamakura Corporation): Pitfalls in Asset and Liability Management: One Factor Term Structure Models To apply simulation to IRDs, the analyst must first \\"calibrate\\" the model parameters, such that bond prices produced by the model best fit observed market prices. *Monte Carlo Methods allow for a compounding in the uncertainty.Gonzalo Cortazar, Miguel Gravet and Jorge Urzua: The valuation of multidimensional American real options using the LSM simulation method For example, where the underlying is denominated in a foreign currency, an additional source of uncertainty will be the exchange rate: the underlying price and the exchange rate must be separately simulated and then combined to determine the value of the underlying in the local currency. In all such models, correlation between the underlying sources of risk is also incorporated; see Cholesky decomposition#Monte Carlo simulation. Further complications, such as the impact of commodity prices or inflation on the underlying, can also be introduced. Since simulation can accommodate complex problems of this sort, it is often used in analysing real options where management's decision at any point is a function of multiple underlying variables. *Simulation can similarly be used to value options where the payoff depends on the value of multiple underlying assetsglobal-derivatives.com: Basket Options ‚Äì Simulation such as a Basket option or Rainbow option. Here, correlation between asset returns is likewise incorporated. *As required, Monte Carlo simulation can be used with any type of probability distribution, including changing distributions: the modeller is not limited to normal or lognormal returns; see for example Datar‚ÄìMathews method for real option valuation. Additionally, the stochastic process of the underlying(s) may be specified so as to exhibit jumps or mean reversion or both; this feature makes simulation the primary valuation method applicable to energy derivatives.Les Clewlow, Chris Strickland and Vince Kaminski: Extending mean-reversion jump diffusion Further, some models even allow for (randomly) varying statistical (and other) parameters of the sources of uncertainty. For example, in models incorporating stochastic volatility, the volatility of the underlying changes with time; see Heston model. Least Square Monte Carlo Least Square Monte Carlo is a technique for valuing early-exercise options (i.e. Bermudan or American options). It was first introduced by Jacques Carriere in 1996. It is based on the iteration of a two step procedure: *First, a backward induction process is performed in which a value is recursively assigned to every state at every timestep. The value is defined as the least squares regression against market price of the option value at that state and time (-step). Option value for this regression is defined as the value of exercise possibilities (dependent on market price) plus the value of the timestep value which that exercise would result in (defined in the previous step of the process). *Secondly, when all states are valued for every timestep, the value of the option is calculated by moving through the timesteps and states by making an optimal decision on option exercise at every step on the hand of a price path and the value of the state that would result in. This second step can be done with multiple price paths to add a stochastic effect to the procedure. Application As can be seen, Monte Carlo Methods are particularly useful in the valuation of options with multiple sources of uncertainty or with complicated features, which would make them difficult to value through a straightforward Black‚ÄìScholes-style or lattice based computation. The technique is thus widely used in valuing path dependent structures like lookback- and Asian optionsRich Tanenbaum: Battle of the Pricing Models: Trees vs Monte Carlo and in real options analysis. Additionally, as above, the modeller is not limited as to the probability distribution assumed. Conversely, however, if an analytical technique for valuing the option exists‚Äîor even a numeric technique, such as a (modified) pricing tree‚ÄîMonte Carlo methods will usually be too slow to be competitive. They are, in a sense, a method of last resort; see further under Monte Carlo methods in finance. With faster computing capability this computational constraint is less of a concern.

Perhaps more important than maintaining the shape, shoe trees also play a crucial part in wicking away moisture caused by sweat - a major cause of lining rot and leather degradation. This is especially important when shoes are worn without socks. Higher quality shoe trees are made from softwood, usually cedar, which helps control odor and absorb moisture.  Types Among wooden shoe trees, there are generally three categories, which correspond to price and quality. = Spring shoe trees = Spring shoe trees The cheapest are wooden shoe tree without a full heel. Although they help with odour, and will help preserve the original shape at the front of the shoe, the narrow knob on the heel puts excess pressure on one section of the heel and prolonged use may deform the shoe. Notwithstanding, this style of shoe tree is popular with high heels because of its flexibility. = Generic shoe trees = Popular in the U.S., the split-toe shoe tree Generic shoe trees are non-lasted shoe trees that are designed to fit a wide range of footwear styles. Generic shoe trees come in many styles; two of the more popular ones are the twin-tube and single-tube shoe tree. The twin-tube shoe tree, cut from a generic last and featuring a fully articulated (round heel), a spring toe and ventilation holes. This style is most popular in England and Europe customers. The single-tube, split-toe shoe tree with overhand handle, works on a spring-spreader mechanism, causing the split toe to expand into the shoe when inserted into the shoe. This style is most popular in the United States. = Lasted shoe trees = Lasted shoe trees At the highest range are lasted shoe trees, which accompany the shoes for which they have the same last. = Plastic shoe trees = Shoe trees may also be made of plastic or stamped sheet metal, with or without a coiled steel spring stem; these are typically cheaper, lighter, and are better suited for traveling. Types lacking a flexing steel spring may use extension springs or adjustable two-piece stems having an over-center mechanical action to wedge them in place. Plastic shoe trees maintain the shape of your shoes but lack the moisture absorbing qualities of wooden shoe trees. Because wooden shoe trees can damage the leather when stored in luggage, plastic shoe trees are often used when traveling, as well as having the added benefit of being lightweight.  When to use  The best time to insert shoe trees is as soon as shoes are removed. After a day of wear, leather shoes may be stretched and contain moisture due to sweat. By inserting shoe trees, the leather will re- form back to its natural shape, and the shoe tree may wick away moisture, which may rot the lining and crack leather. Cedar Boot Trees  Boot trees  Boot trees are shoe trees for boots. Boot trees are often used on ankle-high boots and are similar to standard shoe trees but have a higher ankle area. Their main function is to support the heel counter, which helps preserve the integrity of the higher heel and prevents it from creasing or folding over. The fore part of the boot tree acts as a standard shoe tree and works to gently stretch out the vamp and prevent creasing. Creases that form in the calves of boots can affect comfort when walking. For zip boots, creasing may eventually cause the zip to break. By investing in a pair of boot trees a repair like this can easily be avoided. A boot shaper, on the other hand, has wooden or plastic formers with centre support or wedge that expands to provide the ideal tension for your boots. Some boot shapers come with a trigger that allows easy fitting and hanging.

History At the private boys school Caulfield Grammar in the early 1970s Calvert met vocalist Nick Cave and guitarist Mick Harvey and formed a rock band with other students, playing parties and school functions. The band picked up Cave's friend Tracy Pew on Bass, and after they finished secondary school they named themselves The Boys Next Door in 1977. After making recordings for local independent labels Suicide (a subsidiary of Mushroom Records) and Missing Link, and playing hundreds of live shows, the band left for London in 1980 and renamed themselves The Birthday Party, signing first to 4AD Records and then to Mute Records. After his split with The Birthday Party in 1982, Calvert joined the UK group The Psychedelic Furs, touring the U.S., but never recorded with them. He left before they recorded Mirror Moves in 1984. He returned to Melbourne and in 1985 became a founding member of the rock group Blue Ruin. They recorded five LPs with Calvert and travelled to the UK. Calvert split with Blue Ruin in the late '80s. Blue Ruin reformed with Calvert for some shows in 2006. Guitarist Ben Ling and Calvert have also co-produced the Melbourne band Witch Hats on releases Wound of a Little Horse (2006), Cellulite Soul (2008) and Solarium Down the Causeway (2009).

The emblem features the same design elements as the regional Flag of Hong Kong in a circular setting. The outer white ring is shown with the caption of the official name of the territory in Traditional Chinese and the English short form, \\"Hong Kong\\".  History  = Colonial badge = Colonial badge (1843‚Äì1959) The colonial badge was in use since 1843 in one version or another until it was replaced by the coat of arms granted in 1959. Throughout several revisions, the idea of the badge remained. It depicted three merchants and a pile of cargo on a wharf on the left in the foreground. In the background there was a square-rigged ship and a Chinese junk in the harbour backed by conical hills. Above was the royal arms of the United Kingdom. = Colonial arms = The arms had been in use in Colonial Hong Kong since it was granted on 21 January 1959 and later adopted on the colonial flag in July of that year. The use of the arms by the Hong Kong Government ended in 1997, when it was replaced by the regional emblem. The arms featured two traditional Chinese junks facing each other, and on a red embattled chief a golden naval crown. The crest was a crowned lion holding a pearl, and the supporters were a crowned British lion and a Chinese dragon. The shield and supporters stood on a compartment, consisting of an island, with a scroll bearing the words 'Hong Kong'. The two junks symbolise the importance of Eastern-type of trade on the sea surrounding the colony. The naval crown symbolises Hong Kong's links with the Navy and the Merchant Navy, and the crenulated line acknowledges the brief but valiant defence of Hong Kong against the Japanese during World War II.Flag badges, seals, and arms of Hong Kong / G. C. Hamilton. / Hong Kong : Govt. Press, 1963. In the crest, the pearl held by the lion indicates the small but precious nature of the Colony. It also recalls the romanticised phrase \\"Pearl of the Orient\\" referring to Hong Kong. The lion and dragon supporters show the British and Chinese connections of Hong Kong. The island symbolises the beginning of the colony as an island and represents the maritime and hilly geography of Hong Kong. The small lion standing on the crest alone had featured on the reverse of Hong Kong coinage before the introduction of the Bauhinia design in preparation for the transfer of sovereignty in 1997. The colonial arms has been adopted by a group called the Hong Kong Autonomy Movement (HKAM) as their flag for Hong Kong autonomy. The flag features the old coat of arms against a blue background. The HKAM felt that supporters of Hong Kong autonomy from China needed a symbol around which they could rally. The flag imposed by Beijing on Hong Kong after the handover was inappropriate, as was the old flag under the British, as both failed to represent true Hong Kong autonomy. The old coat of arms was chosen because it is easily recognisable by people in Hong Kong as representing Hong Kong albeit under the British. The HKAM flag has the old coat of arms in the center against a blue ground whereas the old colonial flag had the coat of arms enclosed with a circle on a blue ground with the Union Jack in the canton. Sculpted version of the colonial arms (1959‚Äì1997) =Display= During British rule, the coat of arms were displayed by Government House, the Legislative Council, most courts, and the Central Government Offices. The arms were also in use by aircraft of the Government Flying Service. Current emblem The modern emblem came into use on 1 July 1997, after Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China. =Description= The Regional Emblem of the Hong Kong is round in shape. It bears a red circular edge, an outer ring marked with scripts, a red inner ring with a design of a swaying bauhinia with 5 star-shaped stamens. The swaying bauhinia design at the centre of the inner ring of the emblem is white in colour. It is formed by 5 petals, each with a red 5-pointed star and a red style. The petals are evenly arranged around the central point of the emblem in a clockwise direction. The centre of the bauhinia lies on the central point of the emblem. The outer ring marked with scripts lies between the red circular edge and the red inner ring. The words and characters, on a white background, are red in colour. Evenly arranged in the upper part of the outer ring are the traditional Chinese characters (People's Republic of China Hong Kong S.A.R.) in the standard format for the regional emblem. The bottom of each character points towards the centre of the regional emblem. The English words \\"HONG KONG\\" in the standard format for the regional emblem are evenly arranged further down the outer ring. President of the Legislative Council. =Display and use= The regional emblems are displayed at the Central Government Offices. In addition, the regional emblem is displayed at major government offices and buildings, such as Government House, the Executive Council, the legislative council, the law courts of various levels, District Offices, all border control or check points in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong International Airport and the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices overseas. The official car of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong also bears the emblem of Hong Kong.

James Theodore Bent (30 March 1852 ‚Äì 5 May 1897) was an English explorer, archaeologist and author. Biography James Theodore Bent was the son of James Bent of Baildon House, near Bradford, Yorkshire, where he was born. He was educated at Repton School and Wadham College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1875. In 1877 he married Mabel Hall-Dare and she became his companion, photographer and diarist in all his travels. He went abroad every year and became thoroughly acquainted with Italy and Greece. In 1879 he published a book on the republic of San Marino, entitled A Freak of Freedom, and was made a citizen of San Marino; in the following year appeared Genoa: How the Republic Rose and Fell, and in 1881 a Life of Giuseppe Garibaldi. He spent considerable time in the Aegean archipelago, of which he wrote in The Cyclades; or, Life among the Insular Greeks (1885). Theodore Bent receiving visitors at the Dilmun burial mounds in Bahrain. =Archaeological research= From this period Bent devoted himself particularly to archaeological research. The years 1885-1888 were given up to investigations in Asia Minor, his discoveries and conclusions being communicated to the Journal of Hellenic Studies and other magazines and reviews. In 1889 he undertook excavations in the Bahrein Islands of the Persian Gulf, and found evidence that they had been a primitive home of the Phoenician civilization. After an expedition in 1890 to Cilicia Trachea, where he obtained a valuable collection of inscriptions, Bent spent a year in South Africa, with the object, by investigation of some of the ruins in Mashonaland, of throwing light on the vexed question of their origin and on the early history of East Africa. In 1891 he made, with the surveyor Robert M.W.Swan, the first detailed examination of the Great Zimbabwe. Bent described his work in The Ruined Cities of Mashonaland (1892). In 1893 he investigated the ruins of Axum and other places in northern Ethiopia, which had previously made known in part by the researches of Henry Salt and others. His book The Sacred City of the Ethiopians (1893) gives an account of this expedition. Bent now visited at considerable risk the almost unknown Hadramut country (1893‚Äì1894), and during this and later journeys in southern Arabia he studied the ancient history of the country, its physical features and actual condition. On the Dhofar coast in 1894-1895 he visited ruins which he identified with the Abyssapolis of the frankincense merchants. In 1895 1896 he examined part of the African coast of the Red Sea, finding there the ruins of a very ancient gold-mine and traces of what he considered Sabean influence. While on another journey in South Arabia and Socotra (1896‚Äì1897), Bent was seized with malarial fever, and died in London on 5 May 1897, a few days after his return.Bent explored the island of Socotra with Ernest Bennett, Fellow of Hertford College, Oxford. See The Island of Socotra, J. Theodore Bent, Nineteenth Century, June 1897, (published posthumously). Mabel, who had contributed by her skill as a photographer and in other ways to the success of her husband's journeys, published in 1900 Southern Arabia, Soudan and Sakotra, which she recorded the results of their last expedition into those regions. The conclusions at which Bent arrived as to the Semitic origin of the ruins in Mashonaland have not been accepted by archaeologists.

Not all authors allow multigraphs to have loops. In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a multigraph is a graph which is permitted to have multiple edges (also called parallel edgesFor example, see Balakrishnan 1997, p. 1 or Chartrand and Zhang 2012, p. 26.), that is, edges that have the same end nodes. Thus two vertices may be connected by more than one edge. There are two distinct notions of multiple edges: * Edges without own identity: The identity of an edge is defined solely by the two nodes it connects. In this case, the term \\"multiple edges\\" means that the same edge can occur several times between these two nodes. * Edges with own identity: Edges are primitive entities just like nodes. When multiple edges connect two nodes, these are different edges. A multigraph is different from a hypergraph, which is a graph in which an edge can connect any number of nodes, not just two. For some authors, the terms pseudograph and multigraph are synonymous. For others, a pseudograph is a multigraph that is permitted to have loops. Undirected multigraph (edges without own identity) A multigraph G is an ordered pair G := (V, E) with *V a set of vertices or nodes, *E a multiset of unordered pairs of vertices, called edges or lines. Undirected multigraph (edges with own identity) A multigraph G is an ordered triple G := (V, E, r) with *V a set of vertices or nodes, *E a set of edges or lines, *r : E ‚Üí {{x,y} : x, y ‚àà V}, assigning to each edge an unordered pair of endpoint nodes. Some authors allow multigraphs to have loops, that is, an edge that connects a vertex to itself,For example, see Bollob√°s 2002, p. 7 or Diestel 2010, p. 28. while others call these pseudographs, reserving the term multigraph for the case with no loops.For example, see Wilson 2002, p. 6 or Chartrand and Zhang 2012, pp. 26-27. Directed multigraph (edges without own identity) A multidigraph is a directed graph which is permitted to have multiple arcs, i.e., arcs with the same source and target nodes. A multidigraph G is an ordered pair G := (V, A) with *V a set of vertices or nodes, *A a multiset of ordered pairs of vertices called directed edges, arcs or arrows. A mixed multigraph G := (V, E, A) may be defined in the same way as a mixed graph. Directed multigraph (edges with own identity) A multidigraph or quiver G is an ordered 4-tuple G := (V, A, s, t) with *V a set of vertices or nodes, *A a set of edges or lines, *s : A \\\\rightarrow V, assigning to each edge its source node, *t : A \\\\rightarrow V, assigning to each edge its target node. This notion might be used to model the possible flight connections offered by an airline. In this case the multigraph would be a directed graph with pairs of directed parallel edges connecting cities to show that it is possible to fly both to and from these locations. In category theory a small category can be defined as a multidigraph (with edges having their own identity) equipped with an associative composition law and a distinguished self-loop at each vertex serving as the left and right identity for composition. For this reason, in category theory the term graph is standardly taken to mean \\"multidigraph\\", and the underlying multidigraph of a category is called its underlying digraph. Labeling Multigraphs and multidigraphs also support the notion of graph labeling, in a similar way. However there is no unity in terminology in this case. The definitions of labeled multigraphs and labeled multidigraphs are similar, and we define only the latter ones here. Definition 1: A labeled multidigraph is a labeled graph with labeled arcs. Formally: A labeled multidigraph G is a multigraph with labeled vertices and arcs. Formally it is an 8-tuple G=(\\\\Sigma_V, \\\\Sigma_A, V, A, s, t, \\\\ell_V, \\\\ell_A) where *V is a set of vertices and A is a set of arcs. *\\\\Sigma_V and \\\\Sigma_A are finite alphabets of the available vertex and arc labels, *s\\\\colon A\\\\rightarrow\\\\ V and t\\\\colon A\\\\rightarrow\\\\ V are two maps indicating the source and target vertex of an arc, *\\\\ell_V\\\\colon V\\\\rightarrow\\\\Sigma_V and \\\\ell_A\\\\colon A\\\\rightarrow\\\\Sigma_A are two maps describing the labeling of the vertices and arcs. Definition 2: A labeled multidigraph is a labeled graph with multiple labeled arcs, i.e. arcs with the same end vertices and the same arc label (note that this notion of a labeled graph is different from the notion given by the article graph labeling).

A scaled-up development of the Goblin, the Ghost powered the de Havilland Venom, de Havilland Comet and SAAB 29 Tunnan. On 23 March 1948, John Cunningham, flying a modified Vampire Mk I, which had been furnished with extended wing tips, powered by a Ghost engine, achieved a new world altitude record, having attained a maximum altitude of . Design and development de Havilland Ghost 50 at RAF Museum Cosford The Ghost originated when de Havilland started work on what was to become the Comet in 1943. Frank Halford's first design, the H-1, was just entering production and he was able to meet the power requirements of the Comet by scaling up the H-1. The resulting H-2 used ten larger combustion chambers in place of the Goblin's sixteen smaller ones, using bifurcated \\"split intakes\\" which were fed by each diffuser duct. While the prototype was being built, de Havilland bought Halford's firm and reformed it as the de Havilland Engine Company, renaming the H-1 and H-2 as the Goblin and Ghost respectively. The Ghost was running in 1944, and flew in 1945. This was long before the Comet or Venom was ready for flight. By this point the Ghost had been selected for the Swedish \\"JxR\\" fighter project, which eventually turned into the Tunnan. During the design of the Tunnan, Sweden received German data on swept wing designs via Switzerland and redesigned the plane to incorporate this planform. The Tunnan first flew in this form in 1948. For production versions of the Tunnan, the Ghost was built under licence by Svenska Flygmotor (later to become Volvo Aero) as the RM2. The Ghost was also licence built in Italy by Fiat and in Switzerland by Sulzer Brothers. The Ghost would next be seen when the Comet I first took to the air on 27 July 1949. It was powered by the Ghost 50, which was the interim powerplant, pending the availability of the Avon engine which was to be used in the Comet 2. Several versions of the Ghost 50 were produced, ending with the Ghost 50-Mk.4 installed in the Comet 1XB which was built to test new fuselage construction techniques introduced to address problems with the Comet 1. During development, the Royal Air Force also asked for an improved version of the de Havilland Vampire with greater load-carrying capacity and thus a larger engine. The resulting design was known as the Venom, and shared many features with the earlier Vampire. The Ghost first flew in the Venom on 2 September 1949. By this point the engine had been running for some time and was already at the Mk.103 model of . The Venom was used primarily as a fighter bomber, although some were also produced as night fighters. The Venom was later selected by the Fleet Air Arm for their interceptor needs, and was widely used as the Sea Venom.

It was designed by Leo von Klenze in the neoclassical style, and built from 1816 to 1830. Today the museum is a part of the Kunstareal. From October 2018 until the autumn of 2020 the Glyptothek is closed due to renovation works.https://www.muenchen.de/sehenswuerdigkeiten/orte/119224.html History Detail of one of the niches on the fa√ßade The Glyptothek was commissioned by the Crown Prince (later King) Ludwig I of Bavaria alongside other projects, such as the neighboring K√∂nigsplatz and the building which houses the State Collection of Greek and Roman Antiquities, as a monument to ancient Greece. He envisioned a \\"German Athens\\", in which the ancient Greek culture would be remembered; he had this built in front of the gates of Munich. The Glyptothek is Munich's oldest public museum. The layout of the K√∂nigsplatz complex was designed by the architects Karl von Fischer and Leo von Klenze in 1815, the latter arranged it in the style of a forum, with the Glyptothek on the north side. Colorful frescoes and stuccos made by distinguished artists such as Peter von Cornelius, Clemens von Zimmermann, and Wilhelm von Kaulbach adorned the walls of the museum. Glyptothek, interior 1900 In the few years between 1806 and the opening of the museum in 1830, Ludwig completed a notable collection of Greek and Roman sculpture. Through his agents, he managed to acquire such pieces as the Medusa Rondanini, the Barberini Faun, and, in 1813, the figures from the Aphaea temple on Aegina. The Second World War did not destroy much of the artwork in the Glyptothek; but unfortunately the frescoes did not survive and only lightly plastered bricks were visible after the museum was reopened in 1972. Since the Assyrian Hall erected in the inner court by Klenze in 1864 was not rebuilt, the Assyrian Orthostat reliefs from the palace of king Ashur-nasir-pal II and a lion from the Ishtar Gate of Babylon were moved into the Staatliche Sammlung f√ºr √Ñgyptische Kunst. Architecture The museum was designed in the Classical Greek - Italian style. The portico is Ionic, and the outer walls contain niches, in which 18 original Roman and Greek sculptures stand, six on each wall (except the back). The thirteen rectangular, square or round rooms are arranged around a courtyard, the vestibule in the central building dominates the halls of height. In front of the vestibule is the portico of twelve Ionic columns. The overlying gable includes a group of Johann Martin von Wagner. It represents Athena as protector of the plastic arts. The exterior walls are adorned with sculptures in niches, while the windows are open to the interior courtyard. The sculptures represent mythical or historical representatives of the arts, these are in the front of the K√∂nigsplatz Daedalus, Prometheus, Hadrian, Pericles, Phidias and Hephaestus. On the western and eastern side of the building there are sculptors of the Renaissance and of the times when the Glyptothek was built, including Bertel Thorvaldsen and Antonio Canova, whose works were once on display earlier in the Hall of the Glyptothek but were later moved to the Neue Pinakothek. The museum was originally built completely out of marble. However, during World War II the museum was bombed, and later reconstructed. The walls from the interior are composed of red brick and painted with a light plaster. The interior has domed vaulting. Collections The Glyptothek contains sculptures dating from the archaic age (c. 650 BC) to the Roman era (c. 550 AD). Other notable sculptures, mosaics and reliefs can also be found here. This collection is complemented by the terracotta and bronze collections in the Staatliche Antikensammlung (State Collection of Greek and Roman Antiquities), which is located opposite the Glyptothek. Detail of the Aegina temple figures. Barberini Faun. =Archaic period (700-490 BC)= Among the most famous sculptures covering Archaic Greece are the Munich Kouros (statue of an adolescent from Attica, c. 540 BC), the Kouros of Tenea (statue of an adolescent from Corinth, c. 560 BC) and the temple figures from Aegina (510-480 BC). Of the latter, there are in fact two sets of similar sculptures at the Glyptothek. As archeologists excavated the site at Aegina, these two sets were discovered, and it was later theorized that the original temple was destroyed during the Peloponnesian War and another temple was erected shortly after in its place. The extant temple of c. 500 BC was built over the remains of an earlier temple of c. 570 BC, which was destroyed by fire c. 510 BC. The elements of this destroyed temple were buried in the infill for the larger, flat terrace of the later temple, and are thus well preserved. =Classical period (490‚Äì323 BC)= To the most famous sculptures of Classical Greece belong the portrait of Homer (460 BC), the so-called Munich King (460 BC), who probably represented Hephaestus, the Statue of Diomedes (430 BC), the Medusa Rondanini (440 BC), the Funeral stele of Mnesarete (380 BC), the Statue of Eirene (370 BC), the grave relief of a youth with his hunting dog\\" (360 BC), a portrait of Plato (348 BC), the Alexander Rondanini (c. 338 BC) and the Ilioneus (c. 320 BC). =Hellenistic period (323‚Äì146 BC)= The most famous sculpture representing the Hellenistic period is the Barberini Faun (220 BC). Among the famous Roman copies of Greek sculptures are the Boy with the Goose (c. 250 BC) and the Drunken Woman (attributed to Myron of Thebes; c. 200 BC). =Roman period (150 BC ‚Äì 550 AD)= Emperor Augustus (Augustus Bevilacqua), wearing the Civic Crown. An overview of the room containing the Roman period art with the bust of Emperor Traian (reign 98‚Äì117 AD) in the front. The Glyptothek keeps a large collection of Roman busts, among the most famous ones are the busts of Gaius Marius and Sulla (c. 40 BC), the Emperors Augustus (c. 40 AD), Nero (65 AD), Septimius Severus (200 AD) and his wife Julia Domna (195 AD). A heroised statue portrays Domitian as prince (70/80 AD). With the support of the cultural foundations of the German states, the Glyptothek was able to acquire in 2017 a bust of Caligula (c. 40 AD), excavated in C√≥rdoba in 1937. The Emperor, like the Munich portrait of his ancestor Augustus (Augustus Bevilacqua), bears the corona civica. To the major attractions belong also a colossal statue of Apollo (1st/2nd centuries AD) from a Roman villa in Tuscany, several Roman sarcophagus reliefs and mosaic floors. An imitation of the classical style is the Roman head of a youth in bronze (ca Christ's birth). The Roman period is also represented by several reliefs (Relief of gladiators, 1st century BC) and mosaics (Aion mosaic, c. 200‚Äì250 AD).

The lyrics are sometimes erroneously attributed to Pauline Johnson, perhaps in confusion with her well-known poem, \\"The Song My Paddle Sings\\".Carole Gerson and Veronica Strong-Boag, eds. E. Pauline Johnson, Tekahionwake: Collected Poems and Selected Prose. University of Toronto Press, 2002 It is sometimes sung to keep time while canoeing, and sometimes sung at campfires in a round. It is in Aeolian, or natural minor, but some have performed it with a raised sixth, creating a Dorian feel. Its subject matter is a romanticized vision of nature and the land from the perspective of an Indigenous person, but it remains popular with the non-Aboriginal majority in Canada. Bonnie Dobson sang this song on her 1972 self-titled album. This song appears in the Paul Gross film Men with Brooms (2002). In 2005, the song was partly re-written by Canadian folk singer Dickson Reid and released on his debut album, Sugar in the Snow. It's also a popular song sung in many elementary schools. Lyrics Like most traditional songs the lyrics vary slightly. The following are representative: verse 1: :Land of the silver birch Home of the beaver Where still the mighty moose Wanders at will :Refrain: Blue lake and rocky shore I will return once more boomdidi boom boom ‚Äì boomdidi boom boom ‚Äì boomdidi boom boom boom :High on a rocky ledge I'll build my wigwam (Alternate version: There where the blue lake lies, I'll set my wigwam) Close to the water's edge Silent and still :Refrain :My heart grows sick for thee Here in the low lands I will return to thee Hills of the north :Refrain \\"My Paddle's Keen and Bright\\"Read MacDonald, Margaret; Winifred Jaeger. The Round Book: Rounds Kids Love to Sing. North Haven, Conn: Shoe String Press Inc., 1999, Page 14. . Accessed 20 August 2011. It is related to a similar song \\"My Paddle's Keen and Bright\\" (), written by Margaret Embers McGee (1889‚Äì1975) in 1918, which is used to keep time paddling and is frequently intermingled: :My paddle's keen and bright Flashing with silver Follow the wild goose flight (some people learn another colloquial version: Follow the pale moonlight) Dip, dip and swing :Dip, dip and swing her back Flashing with silver Swift as the wild goose flies Dip, dip and swing Alternative lyrics The lyrics of this song can be quite different depending on who you talk to and what region of Canada they are from. Some possible variations and additional verses: :Deep in the forest Down in the lowlands My heart cries out for thee Hills of the North :Swift as a silver fish Canoe of birch bark Thy mighty waterways Carry me forth :Though I am forced to flee Far from my homeland I will return to thee Hills of the NorthGirl Scouts of the USA, 1960s :High as an eagle soars Over the mountains My spirit rises up Free as a bird A French version, \\"Terre du bouleau blanc\\", was distributed by Orff Canada. \\"Silver Birch\\" in the Scouts and Guiding movement Since the 1930s, the song has been popular with Scouts and Girl Guides. Its origin is unclear. It is sung regularly at Canadian Scout and Girl Guide Camps, including Doe Lake, Camp Maple Leaf, Camp Wenonah (co-educational camp) and Camp Wa-Thik-Ane in Quebec's lower laurentians. The song is also sometimes sung at Boy Scout Camps in the United States, though sometimes \\"eagle\\" is sung in place of \\"beaver\\". Another variation is sung at the opening and closing campfires at Ma-Ka-Ja-Wan Scout Reservation in Pearson, Wisconsin.Confirmed by staff who viewed this page Cuyuna Scout Camp of Crosslake, Minnesota uses this song as one of the three it uses to close its Sunday and Friday night campfire programs, as does Camp Babcock-Hovey in Ovid, New York. The translated Italian version \\"Terra di Betulla\\" is likely frequent campfire song for Italian scouts. Other uses This song is performed by children in American elementary school plays about the First Thanksgiving to typify Native American lifestyle only using the first verses. In the 2019 Brotherhood , directed by Richard Bell‚Äîbased on a true story of tragic canoeing accident in an Ontario, Canada lake at a boys summer camp, that took eleven lives‚Äîthe boys hearty rendition of Land of the Silver Birch as the canoe trip began, is replayed throughout the film in subdued tones, reflecting the survivors' struggle to stay alive in the dark, frigid waters. In 1926, ten boys and a camp counsellor died, when their 30-foot war canoe capsized. Criticism In 2017, school administrators at the High Park Alternative Public School in Toronto, Ontario characterized the song as racist. In a letter to parents they said, \\"While its lyrics are not overtly racist ... the historical context of the song is racist.\\" Other experts disagreed with this assertion and the music teacher who had the song performed at a school concert sued the administration for defamation. However, it appears these experts were commenting on the assertions as they relate to the use of Johnson's work‚Äîbecause it is not known that the song was, indeed, written by Johnson, these criticisms need to be considered in this context.

It was also a term for basic accommodation, usually for gardeners or other workers on an estate. Bothies are found in remote mountainous areas of Scotland, Northern England, Northern Ireland, Wales and the Isle of Man. They are particularly common in the Scottish Highlands, but related buildings can be found around the world (for example, in the Nordic countries there are wilderness huts). A bothy was also a semi-legal drinking den in the Isle of Lewis. These, such as Bothan E√≤rapaidh, were used until recent years as gathering points for local men and were often situated in an old hut or caravan. Etymology The etymology of the word bothy is uncertain. Suggestions include a relation to both \\"hut\\" as in Irish both√°n and Scottish Gaelic bothan or bothag;Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) ¬© Oxford University Press 2009. Bothy. a corruption of the Welsh term bwthyn, also meaning small cottage; and a derivation from Norse b≈´√∞, cognate with English booth with a diminutive ending. Character Most bothies are ruined buildings which have been restored to a basic standard, providing a windproof and watertight shelter. They vary in size from little more than a large box up to two-storey cottages. They usually have designated sleeping areas, which commonly are either an upstairs room or a raised platform, thus allowing one to keep clear of cold air and draughts at floor height. No bedding, mattresses or blankets are provided. Public access to bothies is either on foot, by bicycle or boat. Most bothies have a fireplace and are near a natural source of water. A spade may be provided to bury excrement. The Bothy Code, seen at the 'Tarf Hotel' Bothy, Perth and Kinross Examples There are thousands of examples to draw from. A typical Scottish bothy is the Salmon Fisherman's Bothy, Newtonhill, which is perched above the Burn of Elsick near its mouth at the North Sea.Brian H. Watt, Old Newtonhill and Muchalls, Stenlake Publishing, Glasgow (2005) Another Scottish example from the peak of the salmon fishing in the 1890s is the fisherman's bothy at the mouth of the Burn of Muchalls.C.M. Hogan, History of Muchalls Castle, Lumina Tech Press, Aberdeen (2005)Archibald Watt, Highways and Byways around Kincardineshire, Stonehaven Heritage Society (1985) A further example is the Lairig Leacach Bothy in Lochaber, not far to the east of Fort William. Estate examples The best-known estate bothy is the one in the Royal Gardens at Windsor Castle, which could house about 25 people. It was used by the improver gardeners and disabled ex-servicemen who worked on the estate. Most reasonably-sized estates had a bothy, which housed single men only; in fact, if they got married, they had to give up the accommodation in the bothy. The most famous person to live in a bothy of this type was Percy Thrower when he worked in the Royal gardens. Another example of an estate bothy is the one at Horwood House, which held just five men. There is also one at Attingham Park which is being restored along with the walled gardens. Bothy code Because they are freely available to all, the continued existence of bothies relies on users helping look after them. Over the years, the Mountain Bothies Association has developed a Bothy Code that sets out the main points users should respect: *Bothies are used entirely at your own risk. *Leave the bothy clean and tidy with dry kindling for the next visitors. Make other visitors welcome. *Report any damage to whoever maintains the bothy. Take out all rubbish which you can't burn. Avoid burying rubbish; this pollutes the environment. Please do not leave perishable food as this attracts vermin. Guard against fire risk and ensure the fire is out before you leave. Make sure the doors and windows are properly closed when you leave. *If there is no toilet at the bothy please bury human waste out of sight and well away from the water supply; never use the vicinity of the bothy as a toilet. *Never cut live wood or damage estate property. Use fuel sparingly. *Large groups and long stays are to be discouraged ‚Äì bothies are intended for small groups on the move in the mountains. *Respect any restrictions on use of the bothy, for example during stag stalking or at lambing time. Please remember bothies are available for short stays only. The owner's permission must be obtained if you intend an extended stay. *Because of overcrowding and lack of facilities, large groups (6 or more) should not use a bothy nor camp near a bothy without first seeking permission from the owner. Bothies are not available for commercial groups. Ownership Bothies are usually owned by the landowner of the estate on which they stand, although the actual owner is rarely involved in any way, other than by permitting their continued existence, and by helping with transport of materials. Many are maintained by volunteers from the Mountain Bothies Association (MBA), a charity that looks after 97 bothies in Scotland, the north of England, and Wales.MBA Website, \\"Mountain Bothies Association Website\\", (16 Sept 2009) The location of these bothies can be found on the MBA website, along with information on how people can help. In popular culture The song Am Bothan a Bh'Aig Fionnghuala (\\"Fionghuala's Bothy\\") is a traditional song recorded by the Bothy Band in 1976.Lyr Req: Fionnghula (Bothy Band), the Mudcat Caf√© Bothy Culture is the second studio album by Scottish Celtic fusion artist Martyn Bennett. It was released in 1998. Marion Zimmer Bradley used bothies as a pattern for shelters at Hellers mountains in her Darkover novels. The narrator's bothy is the setting for much of the action in the 1996 suspense novel To the Hilt by Dick Francis. A bothy is featured in the 2013 film Under the Skin. A bothy is featured in the 2012 video game Dear Esther, providing a crucial plot moment in the narration of the unknown main character. The Key-Stone of the Bridge, a novel and audiobook by Craig Meggy, is part homage to Robert Burns, set in Ben Alder Bothy. The Scottish history podcast Stories of Scotland examines bothy culture, heritage and bothy ballads in its first episode.

The Goblin was the second British jet engine to fly, after the Power Jets W.1, and the first to pass a type test and receive a type certificate issued for an aircraft propulsion turbine.Gas Turbines and Jet Propulsion, G.Geoffrey Smith M.B.E., Revised and Enlarged By F.C. Sheffield, Sixth edition 1955, Iliffe & Sons Ltd. Dorset House, Stamford Street, London, S.E.1, p.220 Although it was conceived in 1941 it remained unchanged in basic form for 13 years by which time it had evolved to the Mk. 35 export version. The Goblin was the primary engine of the de Havilland Vampire, and was to have been the engine for the F-80 Shooting Star (as the Allis-Chalmers J36) before that design switched engines due to production delays at Allis-Chalmers. The Goblin also powered the Saab 21R, Fiat G.80 and de Havilland Swallow. The Goblin was later scaled up as the larger de Havilland Ghost, with the model numbers continuing from the last marks of the Goblin. Design and development de Havilland Goblin at RAF Museum Cosford Design of the engine was carried out by Frank Halford at his London consulting firm starting in April 1941.Smith 1946, p.94. It was based on the overall design pattern pioneered by Frank Whittle, using a centrifugal compressor providing compressed air to sixteen individual combustion chambers, from which the exhaust powered a single-stage axial turbine. Compared to Whittle designs, the H-1 was \\"cleaned up\\" in that it used a single-sided compressor with the inlet at the front, and a \\"straight through\\" layout with the combustion chambers exhausting straight onto the turbine. Whittle's designs such as the Power Jets W.2 used a \\"reverse flow\\" layout that piped the hot air back to the middle of the engine, in order to \\"fold\\" it and reduce its length and to reduce the turbine entry temperature, a safeguard necessary for the turbine materials available when Whittle was designing the engines.Note; the subsequent availability of a new turbine material, Nimonic, later made this \\"folding\\" unnecessary. The \\"straight through\\" design was also adopted by the Rover Company for its B.26 engine, later produced in modified form as the Rolls-Royce Derwent. Although it eliminated the Whittle-style \\"folding\\", the Goblin was still a very compact design. The H-1 first ran on 13 April 1942 and quickly matured to produce its full design thrust within two months. It first flew on 5 March 1943 in the Gloster Meteor, and on 26 September in the de Havilland Vampire.Gunston 1989, p.51. It was around this time that de Havilland purchased Halford's company and set him up as the chairman of the de Havilland Engine Company, with the engine name changing from H-1 to \\"Goblin\\", while the new H-2 design became the \\"Ghost\\" ‚Äì de Havilland jet and rocket engines were all named after spectral apparitions. In July 1943, one of the two H-1s then available (actually the spare engine intended as a backup for the one installed in the Vampire prototype) was sent to the United States, where it was selected to become the primary engine of the Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star. This engine was fitted to the prototype P-80, which first flew on 9 January 1944. The engine was later accidentally destroyed in ground testing, and was replaced by the only remaining H-1 from the prototype Vampire.Gunston 1989, p.51. Allis-Chalmers was selected to produce the engine in the US as the J36, but ran into lengthy delays. Instead, the Allison J33, developed by General Electric as the I-40 (their greatly improved version of the J31, itself based on Whittle's W.1), was selected for the production P-80A.

Their first taste of UK chart success was the Asian underground song, \\"Dance with You (Nachna Tere Naal)\\", which became a Top 20 hit, peaking at #12. This led to Sean signing a ¬£1m deal with Virgin Records, under their label Relentless Records. His second single, \\"Eyes on You,\\" was his first solo effort and became a Top 10 hit, peaking at #6.

It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017‚Äì2021, in which it is categorized as a local general aviation facility. The airport is situated in the towns of SmithfieldNorth Central State Airport (SFZ) page from Rhode Island Airport Corp. and Lincoln.

He was a passionate imperialist and believed that Imperial Germany and Muslim unrest were the biggest threats to the British Empire because they wanted to get back their rights.And if they would succeed then British Empire will weaken to rule India. Early life He was the son of the Rev. Alexander Chirol and Harriet Chirol . His education was mostly in France and Germany. Growing up in France with his parents, Chirol lived in the city of Versailles, where he also finished secondary school. In 1869, the young Chirol, already bilingual, moved to Germany, residing in a small town near Frankfurt am Main. By 1870, the Franco-Prussian War had broken out, which Chirol experienced from both sides. He returned to Paris in 1871, just in time to see the Germans enter Paris. Thanks to his good French and German, he was able to come and go easily passing for a citizen of either side, and he began to acquire his taste for adventure and politics. Given the chaos in France, the Chirols returned to their family home in Hove. In April 1872, Chirol joined the Foreign Office where he worked for until spring 1876. Unsatisfied with the slow pace of life in the Foreign Office, Chirol returned to travelling where things were much quicker. Having begun to learn Arabic before he left England, he set off to Egypt arriving in Cairo where he took up residence. In 1879, he set off for Beirut not long after the British had taken control of Cyprus. From there, he travelled inland through Syria with Laurence Oliphant from whom he would later learn to draw. In the Middle East, he took up journalism for the first time, for the Levant Herald, then the leading newspaper in the Near East. Chirol moved on travelling, to Istanbul and later throughout the Balkans. From the travels came his first book, Twixt Greek and Turk. Journalist Chirol began as correspondent and editor of The Times travelling across the globe writing about international events. His first major post was to Berlin in 1892 where he formed many close relationships with the German Foreign Ministry including the Foreign Minister. He lived there until 1896 and reported on Anglo-German relations. Even after returning to London, Chirol travelled back to Berlin and often acted as a backchannel between the English and Germans. Later, he succeeded Donald Mackenzie Wallace as director of foreign department of The Times in 1899. Despite being in charge of The Times foreign line, he still managed to travel a great deal. In 1902, he travelled overland to India heading first to Moscow and on to Isfahan, Quetta, Delhi and, finally, Calcutta, where he met with Lord George Nathaniel Curzon. Chirol and Curzon got on quite well, having first met in Cairo in 1895. Chirol was impressed with Curzon's fine governing calling him \\"a marvellous man for work\\". Chirol's first visit to India inspired a longtime love for the place to which he would often return throughout his life. Towards the end of his trip, he travelled north to Indore where he stayed with Sir Francis Younghusband. After returning to London, Chirol continued working on his next book, The Middle Eastern Question, based on a series of 19 articles by Chirol that appeared in The Times in 1902 and 1903. His book helped to bring the term Middle East into common usage. Chirol dedicated the book to his new friend, Curzon, whom he would soon see again. In November 1903 he sailed to Karachi where he boarded a yacht to tour the Persian Gulf with Lord and Lady Curzon. Other notable guests on the voyage included a young Winston Churchill. Chirol returned to London by Christmas and just as the Russo-Japanese War was breaking out. He later travelled to Washington D.C., where he met with Teddy Roosevelt and many US Congress members, facilitated by his close friend, Sir Cecil Spring Rice.The Spectator: 'Sir Cecil Spring Rice' http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/12th-october-1929/23/sir-cecil-spring- rice After two decades as a journalist he retired from The Times on 21 December 1911 and was knighted shortly thereafter, on 1 January 1912, for his distinguished service as a foreign affairs advisor. He rejoined the Foreign Office as a diplomat and was soon on his way to the Balkans as World War I broke out. World War I Travelling through Greece, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Serbia and Romania, Chirol, along with J.D. Gregory, met with foreign officials and heads of state to help convince them to join the Allied side. In addition, he wrote a stern critique of the Foreign Office's failings in the region, including the ongoing quagmire at Gallipoli. Deprecatory comments in Chirol's book, Indian Unrest, resulted in a civil suit being brought against him in London by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, in the Indian independence movement. Although Tilak ultimately lost the suit, Chirol ended up spending almost two years in India on account of it, missing the bulk of World War I. Later life He later travelled to Paris as part of a government delegation whose job it was to work on terms of peace. Though no longer formally with the newspaper, Chirol continued to write articles occasionally and maintained his wide range of journalistic and diplomatic contacts. In 1924, he travelled to the United States on a lecture tour and he spoke about the growing problems between the Occident and the Orient and warned against American isolationism, which he greatly feared. He spent the remainder of his retired life travelling the world to places like Morocco, Egypt, South Africa and, especially, India. In addition, he published a number of other books. Chirol died in London in 1929 and was missed by many. Major-General Sir Neill Malcolm called him the \\"friend of viceroys, the intimate of ambassadors, one might almost say the counsellor of ministers, he was [also] one of the noblest characters that ever adorned British journalism\\". He was buried in the Brighton Extra Mural Cemetery.

Background The Solemn League and Covenant agreed by English and Scottish Presbyterians in 1643 In the 17th and 18th centuries, politics and religion were closely linked; it is impossible to understand differences between Engagers, Royalists or Kirk Party political views without an appreciation of these distinctions. 'Presbyterian' versus 'Episcopalian' implied differences in governance, not doctrine. Episcopalian meant rule by bishops, appointed by the monarch; Presbyterian structures were controlled by Elders, nominated by their congregations. Arguments over structure or governance of the church were as much about politics and the power of the monarch as religious practice; political divisions often centred on different interpretations of this. The Protestant Reformation created a Church of Scotland, or 'kirk', Presbyterian in structure and governance, but predominantly Calvinist in doctrine. When James VI & I became king of England in 1603, a unified Church of Scotland and England governed by bishops became the first step in his vision of a centralised, Unionist state. Although both churches were nominally Episcopalian, they were very different in doctrine; even Scottish bishops viewed many Church of England practices as little better than Catholicism. Montrose; Royalist commander in Scotland 1644-1645, but a Covenanter general 1638 to 1640 Efforts by Charles I to impose uniform practices led to the 1638 National Covenant, whose signatories pledged to resist liturgical 'innovations. In December 1638, bishops were expelled from the kirk; when Charles attempted to use military force, he was defeated in the 1639 and 1640 Bishops' Wars, which left the Covenanter party in control of Scotland. Calvinists believed a 'well-ordered' monarchy was part of God's plan; as a result, the vast majority of Covenanters agreed monarchy itself was divinely ordered but disagreed on who held ultimate authority in clerical affairs. Royalists and Engagers tended to argue the king held supreme authority, but that did not necessarily mean they supported bishops and individual motives were very complex. Many fought for both Covenant and king at different times, including Montrose. When the First English Civil War began in 1642, Scotland initially remained neutral, but became involved in the Irish Rebellion; the bitterness of this conflict radicalised views in Scotland and Ireland. The Covenanter faction known as the Kirk Party, led by Argyll saw religious union with England as the best way to preserve a Presbyterian kirk and in October 1643, the Solemn League and Covenant agreed a Presbyterian Union in return for Scottish military support. Royalists and moderates in both Scotland and England opposed union, as did the religious Independents like Oliver Cromwell, who dominated the New Model Army and opposed any state- ordered church. Both Covenanters and their English allies saw the Independents as a bigger threat than the Royalists and when Charles surrendered in 1646, they began negotiations to restore him to the English throne. The Engagement Marquess of Argyll, whose Kirk Party opposed the Engagement The Scots nominated three Commissioners to negotiate with Charles; Lauderdale, Lanark and Loudoun. In December 1647, Charles agreed to impose Presbyterianism in England for three years and suppress the Independents, but his refusal to take the Covenant himself split the Scots. It was not until April 1648 the Engagers achieved a majority in the Scottish Parliament; Argyll's Kirk Party did not trust Charles, objected to an alliance with English and Scots Royalists, and denounced the Engagement as 'sinful.' Most of the Scottish army had been demobilised and efforts to recruit new regiments were undermined when many refused to serve, including their most experienced generals, Lord Leven and David Leslie. The inexperienced Duke of Hamilton was given command, with the Earl of Callendar as his subordinate. When deputy to Leven, Callendar's over estimation of his military abilities had led to constant conflict and this was repeated with Hamilton. His commander of infantry, William Baillie, had direct experience of the New Model Army and doubted their ability to defeat it. After dispersing Kirk Party dissidents at Mauchline Muir in June 1648, a poorly trained Engager army of 9,000 marched into England. The Second English Civil War was intended as a series of Royalist risings in England and Wales, with the Scots providing support. By the time Hamilton's army entered Lancashire in early August, the other revolts had been suppressed and Cromwell routed the Engagers at Preston on 19 August. Hamilton was taken prisoner and executed in March 1649. Aftermath Defeat at Preston led to the collapse of the Engager regime; the Kirk Party took control of Edinburgh and although repulsed at Stirling in September, a new civil war seemed imminent. However, with Cromwell's support, Argyll took control and expelled his Engager opponents, with English troops being withdrawn. The 1649 Act of Classes banned Engagers and Royalists from holding political or military office and established the Kirk Party as the government of Scotland. However, the execution of Charles in January 1649 was viewed by Covenanters as an offence against God; they proclaimed his son Charles II King of Scotland and Great Britain. In the 1650 Treaty of Breda, they agreed to restore Charles to the English throne; in return he accepted the Covenant. Defeats at Dunbar and Worcester resulted with Scotland being incorporated into the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland in 1654.

The town is still widely known, if indirectly, in the Jewish world, for the eponymous Ponevezh Yeshiva. History St. Peter and St. Paul's Church The oldest house in Panevƒó≈æys (1614) Lord's Resurrection Orthodox Church Cathedral of Christ the King Cido Arena Panevƒó≈æys was first mentioned in 1503, in documents signed by the Grand Duke of Lithuania Alexander I, who granted the town building rights to construct a church and other structures. Alexander II is considered the founder of the city, which celebrated its 500th anniversary in 2003. The city lies on the old plain of the Nevƒó≈æis River. The city name means \\"along the Nevƒó≈æis.\\" Throughout the 16th century, the city maintained a status of a Royal town. Communities of Poles, and Karaites, settled in the area as early as the 14th century. A Karaite Kenesa, and a Polish Gymnasium, existed in Panevƒó≈æys until the Second World War (the Polish version of the name of the city was Poniewie≈º). In the 17th century, the part of the city on the left bank of the river started to develop and expand further. The town played an important role in both the November Uprising, and the January Uprising, and the fights for independence continued there in 1864. After the Industrial Revolution, at the end of the 19th century, the first factories were established in the city, and industry began to make use of modern machinery. As products were oriented towards the mass market, banking intensified and commerce increased. The educational system became more accessible, and literacy increased, as well. By the end of 19th century - the beginning of the 20th century, Panevƒó≈æys became a strong economic and cultural center of the region. At the time it was the fourth most important city in Lithuania. It was also a center of operations by local knygne≈°ys (book smugglers). At the end of the book prohibition, one of them - Juozas Masiulis - in 1905 opened the first Lithuanian bookstore and printing house. The building is still a landmark of Panevƒó≈æys, and local people are proud of this heritage, symbolized in a bookstore that has been functional for more than 100 years. Between the World Wars, in the newly independent Lithuania, Panevƒó≈æys continued to grow. According to the Lithuanian census of 1923, there were 19,147 people in Panevƒó≈æys, among them 6,845 Jews (36%) (in Yiddish the town's name was ◊§÷º◊ê÷∏◊†◊ô◊ï◊ï◊¢◊ñ◊©, transliterated as Ponevezh). The Ponevezh yeshiva, one of the most notable Haredi yeshivas in the history of the Jews in Lithuania, was established and flourished in the town. Rabbi Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman (1886‚Äì1969), was its rosh yeshiva (head) and president. Known as the \\"Ponovezher Rov\\", he was also the leading rabbi of Panevƒó≈æys. He managed to escape to the British Mandate of Palestine where he set about rebuilding the Ponevezh yeshiva in Bnei Brak where it still exists in modern Israel. It has a very large student body of young Talmud scholars. The town's population rose to 26,000 between 1923 and 1939. On 15 June 1940 Soviet military forces took over the city, as a consequence of the forced incorporation of Lithuania, into the Soviet Union. A number of political prisoners were murdered near the sugar factory. A large number of residents were exiled to Siberia or suffered other forms of persecution. After Germany attacked the USSR, Panevƒó≈æys was occupied by German forces, as it had been during the First World War. It acquired the status of a district center (\\"Gebietskommissariate\\") within the Reichskommissariat Ostland. During the Nazi occupation nearly all the Jewish population of the town was killed in 1943 during the Holocaust; only a few managed to escape and find asylum abroad. The major massacre was in August 1941 when 7,523 helpless Jews were executed by the Lithuanians assisted by the local police. January Events. In 1944 the city was yet again occupied by the Soviet Union leading to a new wave of political exiles and killings. After World War II, the natural process of the city's evolution was disrupted. The Soviet Communist Party, exercised dictatorial control, and the city was transformed into a major industrial center. During the 1960s and 1980s, several large-scale industrial companies were established. The Soviet authorities also destroyed the old town and only after protests by local people was total destruction of the old city center stopped. The number of inhabitants increased from 41,000 to 101,500 between 1959 and 1979. In 1990, the population reached 130,000. After Lithuania regained its independence, the city's industry faced some major challenges. For some time it was regarded as a place where plastics cooperatives were making large profits. A suburban region, called Plastic Kings Castles by the locals still remains from that era and contains very big and sometimes bizarre houses. After independence, the population of Panevƒó≈æys fell somewhat and for a while most investments went to Vilnius or Klaipƒóda instead. With the economic growth in the early 2000s however, investment reached Panevƒó≈æys. Babilonas real estate project, the largest such project in the Baltic States with an 80 ha land area, has been developed in Panevƒó≈æys since 2004.

Early life Born in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, Smith was one of nineteen children of Latter Day Saint apostle John Henry Smith. His mother, Sarah Farr, was the first of John Henry Smith's two wives (who he had simultaneously for many years). His grandfather, for whom he was named, was also an LDS Church apostle as well as a cousin of church founder Joseph Smith. John Henry Smith and George Albert Smith are the only father and son pair to have been members of the Quorum of the Twelve at the same time, having served in the Quorum together between 1903 and 1910. In his youth, Smith worked at the Zions Cooperative Mercantile Institution (ZCMI) factory and traveled throughout Utah as a salesman. Smith attended high school at Brigham Young Academy, graduating in 1884. He then studied law at University of Deseret (later the University of Utah) for a year. His work as a salesman for ZCMI involved a long trip, starting at Panaca, Nevada and moving north-eastward, with Smith taking grocery orders while his associate, James Poulton, took shoe orders. Smith also gave many impromptu concerts on this sales trip, playing on harmonica and guitar with Poulton accompanying on the flute.Mary Jane Woodger, Against the Odds: The Life of George Albert Smith (American Fork, Utah: Covenant Communications, 2011), p. 34 During this journey Smith would regularly attend LDS Church services on Sundays in the towns he passed through coming north from Panaca. He would be regularly invited to give a talk while visiting.Woodger, Against the Odds, p. 35 Employment and politics In 1894, after returning from serving in the church's Southern States Mission, Smith got a job as assistant to a traveling salesman at ZCMI. He excelled at this enough to be promoted to working in the packing box shop, where he again excelled and was promoted to wholesale grocery salesman for ZCMI's Salt Lake County operations.Woodger. Against The Odds p. 69-70 Smith also served as secretary of the Kanab Cattle Company and a member of the Utah National Guard.Woodger, Against The Odds p. 70 In 1896, he had joined the Republican Party and campaigned for William McKinley, who became President of the United States. He was later present at the Pan American exposition in Buffalo in 1901 and heard the shot that killed McKinley. He was appointed as a receiver for the Land Office in Utah in the years 1898 and 1903. While surveying for a railroad as a young man, Smith's eyesight was permanently impaired by glare from the sun. After 1903, Smith found his frequent travels debilitating and began to show prominent symptoms of physical weakness. He was eventually diagnosed with lupus erythematosus, a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease. From 1898 to 1902 Smith was chair of the Republican committee for the 28th voting district of Utah.Woodger, Against the Odds p. 73-74 In 1902, there were those who sought to convince Smith to run for the United States Senate. He instead deferred to allow Reed Smoot to be the Republican candidate.Woodger, Against The Odds p. 77 In 1920, while serving as president of the church's European Mission, Smith toured England and Scotland as the ZCMI representative to the American Goods Association tour sponsored by the British Chamber of Trade.Against the Odds p. 143-144. In 1921, Smith became a member of the Salt Lake City Chamber of Commerce. In 1923, he served on the reception committee for US President Warren G. Harding's visit to Salt Lake City.Against the Odds p. 148 Smith was known for his patriotism and joined various American patriotic groups. He was also an ardent supporter of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). He was among those closely involved in the 1912 decision for the LDS Church to sponsor scout troops. He also was closely involved in its implementation. Especially in the 1920s, Smith would regularly contact Salt Lake City businessmen to personally urge them to donate money to scouting.Against the Odds p. 150 In the 1920s Smith was elected a member of the BSA Regional Executive Council for the 12th region. This council oversaw scouting in California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah.Against the Odds p. 150 In 1932, Smith was elected a member of the BSA's National Council. He was the first of many leaders of the LDS Church to hold this position. He also received the Silver Beaver Award that year. In 1934, the BSA's National Council awarded him the prestigious Silver Buffalo Award. Smith was an avid genealogist and family historian and was named national vice president of the Sons of the American Revolution in 1922. In 1932, Smith found himself at odds with much of the ZCMI board over plans to cut pensions for retirees as the Great Depression caused disruption for the company. Smith felt that the pensions should be left in place. Being unable to support the chosen course of action, he resigned from the board later that year.Against the Odds p. 161 Starting in 1933 Smith was president of the Utah Society for the Sightless. He continued in this position until 1949. Under his leadership the society built a new home for the blind in Salt Lake City. They also printed the first Braille edition of the Book of Mormon.Against the Odds p. 152  Marriage and family  On May 25, 1892, Smith married Lucy Emily Woodruff, a granddaughter of Wilford Woodruff, in the Manti Temple. The couple later had three children. It was several years after their marriage that the first daughter was born, with the pregnancy starting shortly after Woodruff gave Lucy a priesthood blessing to be a mother.Woodger, Against the Odds p. 71 Lucy had spent much of her time growing up in the household of her grandfather and looked on him as almost more of a father than a grandfather. Smith's son, George Albert Smith, Jr., became a professor at Harvard Business School. George Albert Smith 1890.JPGGeorge Albert Smith, ca. 1890 Lucy Woodruf Smith.jpgLucy Emily Woodruff, wife of George Albert Smith Smith's daughter Emily Stewart, served for a time on the Primary General Board. Louie B. Felt, the general superintendent of the Primary, guided Stewart to take a hospital training course in Denver expand her medical training she already had as a registered nurse. She then became one of the leaders of Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City. She and May Anderson disagreed on how to run the hospital which lead to her resignation from the Primary General Board in 1932.Against the Odds p. 162 Smith's second daughter, Edith, earned a master's degree in history. For much of the 1930s Smith was involved in protecting her husband, George Elliott, from charges of mail fraud connected with alleged fraudulent stock sales by the Salt Lake Mortuary in Montana. Smith's brother, Winslow Farr Smith, was also involved with these charges. Smith felt the charges were baseless charges developed by other morticians who resented the Salt Lake Mortuaey's low prices.Against the Odds p. 164-166 Lucy served as president of the Relief Society in Europe while Smith was the mission president. She also was a delegate to the world council. She was a member of the YW MIA's General Board for 29 years.Against the Odds p. 171 Lucy Smith died in 1937. Smith never remarried, which made him the only man to have not had a living wife while he was serving as church president.  LDS Church service  Just prior to his marriage to Lucy, Smith served as a Mutual Improvement Association (MIA) missionary throughout many areas in Southern Utah. He was set apart as a missionary on September 7, 1891. He was assigned to serve with William B. Dougall, Jr., who was a grandson of Brigham Young. They were assigned to the 4 stakes that covered Juab, Millard, Beaver and Iron counties. The assignment was to increase attendance and participation in MIA, for both young men and young women.Francis M. Gibbons, Georrge Albert Smith: Kind and Caring Christian, Prophet of God (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1990), p. 16 Smith and his new wife, Lucy, were missionaries in the church's Southern States Mission, with J. Golden Kimball as their mission president, from 1892 to 1894. Smith was appointed mission secretary. Initially when Smith left to serve in the Southern States mission on June 23, 1892, he left Lucy behind in Salt Lake City.Gibbons, George ALbert Smith, p. 22 Smith's first assignment in Tennessee was to serve in the Middle Tennessee District, covering the area in and around the city of Nashville. It was intended he would assume the position of mission secretary, essentially chief assistant to the mission president, in August. It was also planned for his wife to join him at that time.Gibbons, George Albert Smith, p. 24 However, Kimball felt that Smith needed more training in the mission field before being joined by his wife, and so did not allow her to join her husband until November.Gibbons, George Albert Smith, p. 25 From November 1892 to August 1893 and from October 1893 to May 1894 Kimball was out of the mission so Smith was acting mission president.Woodger. Against The Odds. P. 63 As was common at the time, Smith was ordained a seventy when he went on his mission. After returning, he was made a member of the third quorum of the seventies presiding council in Salt Lake City, which meant he had specific assignments for conducting missionary outreach in the area.Woodger, Against the Odds p. 74 Smith also served as a Sunday School teacher and then as the organization's superintendent for the 17th WardWard in Salt Lake City, immediately north-west of Temple Square.Woodger, Against The Odds p. 74 For a few years leading up to 1902 Smith served as an assistant to Richard R. Lyman and Joseph F. Merrill in running the Salt Lake Stake's youth program for young men. At the time the Salt Lake Stake took in all of Salt Lake county and was by far the largest stake by membership in the LDS Church. It was looked upon as the \\"flagship\\" stake of the church, and Lyman, Merrill and Smith initiated programs and changes that were adopted elsewhere throughout the church.Woodger, Against The Odds p. 74 Smith then served as head of the youth program for young men in Salt Lake Stake from 1902‚Äì1903. =Apostleship= Smith was called as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1903. In 1907, Smith negotiated the church's purchase of the Joseph Smith farm in Palmyra, New York..Against the Odds p. 157 From 1920 until 1921 Smith served as president of the church's British and European missions. In this capacity, he preached in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Germany. He worked tirelessly to convince the British government to allow the church to send more missionaries and also met with Swiss officials to get permission to send more missionaries to that country. While presiding over the European Mission, Smith had his first airplane flight as part of a journey from Britain to Sweden. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s he was a strong supporter of use of airplanes in travel. J. Reuben Clark, of the church's First Presidency, was an equally ardent opposer of the use of airplanes. Considering how many airplanes crashed in these early years of aviation Clark may well have had a more reasonable approach to the issue. From 1922 to 1935, Smith was the general superintendent of the church's MIA. His counselors were Richard R. Lyman and Melvin J. Ballard. During his tenure, cooperation between the young men and young women's MIA organizations increased. One sign of this was the Young Women's Journal, merging into the young women's MIA-published Improvement Era in 1929.'Against the Odds' p. 149 In 1935 he was succeeded in this position by Albert E. Bowen. His illnesses seem to have come on in large part as a result of many of the difficult circumstances he suffered while visiting stake conferences during the first six years he was an apostle. After his return from Europe in 1921, Smith had a full schedule of stake conference assignments. That year he presided at stake conferences in Utah, Arizona and in Chihuahua state in Mexico. Against the Odds, p. 148 In 1921 Smith became the chairman of the executive board of the Deseret News. He was also on the general board for Religion Classes, which were weekday religious instruction that later merged with the Young Men and Young Women programs. He was also made chairman of the church's Centennial Celebration Committee.Against the Odds p. 148 Smith continued as chair of the Centennial Committee until it work ended in 1930. In 1928, Smith purchased the Hill Cumorah for the church. This was a result of over 20 years of work on trying to get the hill coordinated between Smith and Willard Bean on the part of the church and the local landowners.Against the Odds p. 157-158 In 1930, Smith invited a group of his friends who shared his interest in the history of the LDS Church to his house. They organized the Utah Pioneer Trails and Landmarks Association. Smith was made the first president of this organization. The places a large number of historical markers in the western United States over the next five years.Against the Odds p. 158 The group would eventually erect more than 100 monuments and markers. With the death of quorum president, Rudger Clawson, in 1943, Smith was sustained as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and served in the position for two years. =Church president= With the death of Heber J. Grant, Smith became president of the church on May 21, 1945. When World War II ended, Smith helped send supplies to Europe and was also known for his efforts to revitalize missionary work. He publicly denounced the activities and political influence of the American Ku Klux Klan. Smith dedicated the Idaho Falls Temple on September 23, 1945. Over his lifetime, he traveled approximately a million miles fulfilling church assignments.George Albert Smith, \\"Devotional\\", 1950-01-01. Smith was the first church president to visit Mexico while in office. He went there to complete the reconciliation of and return to the church a group of apostates in Mexico known as the \\"Third Conventionists\\". Also during his presidency the first translation of the endowment ceremony was done. The translation was done by Antoine R. Ivins and Eduardo Balderas, with the approval of the First Presidency. Emotional illness While not common knowledge among contemporary members of the LDS Church, nor even in Smith's day, it was well known to his close friends, church associates, and family members that Smith suffered from chronic depression and anxiety, which at times could be debilitating, including one nervous breakdown that left him largely bedridden from 1909 to 1912. Throughout his life, Smith took to his bed, sometimes for days at a time, with emotional and mental illness related issues. Smith professed that these experiences helped deepen his understanding of the Gospel and personal belief in the existence of God, stating in a 1921 general conference session, \\"I have been in the valley of the shadow of death in recent years, so near the other side that I am sure that for the special blessing of our Heavenly Father I could not have remained here. ... The nearer I went to the other side, the greater was my assurance that the gospel is true.\\" According to Mary Jane Woodger: \\"Those close to George Albert Smith were aware of some emotional problems. Grandchild George Albert Smith V suggests that his grandfather struggled with depression, feeling incompetent, and being overwhelmed. There were times when 'he just could not pull it all together.' Another granddaughter, Shauna Lucy Stewart Larsen, who lived in George Albert‚Äôs home for twelve years as a child, remembers that 'when there was great, tremendous stress, mostly [of] an emotional kind, it took its toll and he would literally have to go to bed for several days.' Grandson Robert Murray Stewart remembers, 'There were problems associated with his mental health, just maintaining control of himself.' Given what seems to be George Albert‚Äôs emotional fragility, physical illness may have been a socially acceptable way for him to retreat, rest, and regroup before tackling his responsibilities again with renewed determination.\\" Death and legacy In March 1951, Smith suffered a stroke that left him mostly paralyzed on the right side of his body, and gradually deteriorated until his death on April 4, 1951, his 81st birthday. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.

He is best known for the series of de Havilland Gipsy engines, widely used by light aircraft in the 1920s and 30s. Career Educated at Felsted, In 1913 he left the University of Nottingham before graduating in order to learn to fly at the Bristol Flying School at Brooklands, later becoming a flight instructor for Bristol. In 1914 he joined the Aeronautical Inspection Department of the War Office Dictionary of National Biography Oxford: O.U.P. On the outbreak of the First World War he joined the Royal Flying Corps where he fought at the front. Recalled to engineering duties he improved and enlarged the water-cooled six-cylinder Austro-Daimler, producing the 230 hp (170 kW) Beardmore Halford Pullinger (BHP). This engine was further developed by Siddeley-Deasy as the Puma. In 1922 he rode a 4-valve Triumph Ricardo in the Senior TT, finishing 13th. That same year he was commissioned to produce a luxury motorcycle for Vauxhall. Based on aero-engine principles, it featured an in-line unit construction four cylinder engine, with shaft drive to the rear wheel. Four examples were made, one exists in a private collection in the Isle of Man. Working for Airdisco, he redesigned the Puma engine as the Nimbus and also developed a V-8 engine based on the company's large stores of surplus Renault engine parts. There in 1924 he designed the first of the long-running Cirrus series at the request of de Havilland.Bill Gunston, World Encyclopedia of Aircraft Engines, 4th Edition, Patrick Stephens, 1898, pp.43-4,85. In 1923 he set up his own consultancy in London,Lumsden 2003, p.54. alongside the equally influential engine designer Harry Ricardo. From 1926 he designed the famous de Havilland Gipsy air-cooled inline engines, repeating the success of the Cirrus. During this period Frank Halford also designed and had built the AM Halford Special racing car which he raced at Brooklands in the 1926 RAC British Grand Prix, as well as in many other races in 1925 and 1926. During the 1930s Halford and Harry Ricardo became interested in the sleeve valve as a method of increasing the allowable operating RPM and compression ratio of piston engines, thereby increasing the power from an otherwise smaller engine. From 1928 Halford worked with D. Napier & Son, eventually producing the Sabre, which became one of the most powerful piston aero engines built, producing 3,500 hp (2.6 MW) from only 2200 cubic inches (36 L) in late-war versions.Lumsden 2003, p.172. During the war he became interested in jet engines, and designed a simplified version of Frank Whittle's centrifugal-flow designs with the air intake on the front and \\"straight-through\\" combustion chambers. Known initially as the Halford H.1, the project was undertaken for de Havilland who produced it as the de Havilland Goblin. Halford's company was eventually purchased outright by de Havilland in 1944. Halford continued working on jets, turboprop and rocket engines.

The battalion participated in combat operations throughout northern Europe until V-E Day. It was one of five tank battalions (all independent) that landed in Normandy on D-Day (6 June 1944). It landed on Omaha Beach supporting the 1st Infantry Division, but was attached to 2d Infantry Division on 15 June 1944, which it supported for most of the remainder of the war. The battalion played a key role in blunting the northern flank of the German attack during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944. The 741st Tank Battalion advanced as far as Plze≈à, Czechoslovakia by the end of the war. The battalion was inactivated in October 1945, then briefly reactivated in 1949 as a reserve unit assigned to the 96th Infantry Division. It was withdrawn from the 96th Infantry Division and inactivated in 1952.Sawicki, pp. 315‚Äì316 Organization World War II Tank Battalion Structure - November 1944. The 741st Tank Battalion followed the standard organization of a U.S. medium tank battalion during World War II.Zaloga, pp. 22-24 It consisted of a Headquarters and Headquarters Company, Service Company, three medium tank companies (Companies A, B, and C) and a light tank company (Company D). The Headquarters Company included the battalion headquarters staff, both officers and enlisted men; an assault gun platoon, consisting of three Sherman tank variants armed with a short-barreled 105 mm assault gun, and an additional three assault guns nominally assigned to each medium tank company, but normally operating as a second gun section in the assault gun platoon; a mortar platoon, equipped with three half-track mounted 81 mm mortars; a reconnaissance platoon with five quarter-ton \\"peeps\\" (jeeps); and the headquarters tank section, consisting of two tanks, one each for the battalion commander and the operations officer. The assault gun platoon was frequently attached to the artillery of the division to which the battalion was attached, especially if the division had to revert to defense or static positions. The Service Company included a headquarters section; a maintenance platoon; and a large battalion supply and transportation platoon, with over 30 trucks to provide logistics for the battalion. Companies A, B, C, and D ‚Äì the tank line companies, both medium and light, all followed the same table of organization. Each company consisted of a headquarters section which, along with a small headquarters staff, also included two tanks (one for the company commander and one for the executive officer); and three five-tank platoons. The medium tank companies were equipped with M4 Sherman tanks, while the light tank company was equipped with M5 Stuart tanks. All four companies had their own maintenance section, which included an M32 Tank Recovery Vehicle, built on a Sherman chassis. Because the Stuart carried a 4-man crew versus a 5-man crew on the Sherman, it had a somewhat smaller personnel strength than the medium tank companies. For the Normandy landings, Companies B and C were equipped with DD tanks. As virtually all these tanks were lost during the assault on D-Day, they were replaced with conventional M4 Shermans as soon as the battalion began receiving replacement equipment. History =Activation and deployment= Crew from Company B, 741st Tank Battalion abandons its M3 Grant tank during the Third Army Louisiana Maneuvers at Fort Polk, Louisiana, 12 February 1943. These tanks were replaced by M4 Shermans before the battalion entered combat in France. (U.S. Army Signal Corps)The 741st Tank Battalion was activated at Fort Meade, Maryland, on 15 March 1942. Its initial cadre was formed from members of the 751st Tank Battalion and complemented by draftees.Vitamin Baker, 1 The battalion criss-crossed the country as it moved from one training station to another developing its maneuver and gunnery skills. Training camps included Camp Young, California, Camp Polk, Louisiana, Camp Pickett, Virginia, and Camp Wellfleet, Massachusetts.Vitamin Baker, 3‚Äì6 At Camp Bradford, Virginia, it also began practicing amphibious training, including loading and unloading aboard Navy craft, and practice assault landings at Little Creek, Virginia and Solomons Island, Maryland.Vitamin Baker, 6 Finally, in August 1943, the battalion arrived at Fort Dix, New Jersey, to make final pre-embarkations preparations. From there, the battalion moved to the embarkation station at Camp Shanks, and boarded the Capetown Castle,Vitamin Baker, 7 departing New York on 20 October 1943 and arriving at Liverpool, EnglandVitamin Baker, 11 on 2 November 1943.Unit Journal 741st Tank Bn, 2 The battalion continued its training in England, where it was selected to become part of the D-Day assault force. Training first with British Valentine tanks specially equipped with the duplex drive amphibious propulsion system beginning in January 1944, they later received similarly equipped M4s with which to continue training.Vitamin Baker, 10‚Äì15 The units loaded out their equipment in late May and waited in port for the final order for the assault landings.Vitamin Baker, 17,23 =D-Day landings and Normandy= Tanks of Company A, 741st Tank Battalion, loaded aboard an LCT, awaiting departure for D-Day invasion, early June 1944. Note the extended air intakes to allow deep water fording while coming ashore during the landings. (U.S. Army Signal Corps) For D-Day, the battalion was attached to the 1st Infantry Division to support the 16th Infantry Regimental Combat Team landings on Omaha Beach. Company A was equipped with M4 Sherman tanks, while Companies B and C were equipped with the amphibious Sherman DD tanks. Company D, equipped with M5 light tanks, and the battalion headquarters were not part of the initial landing force.Yeide, 37‚Äì41 The Company A tanks, along with a platoon of bulldozer-blade equipped Shermans, were brought ashore by LCTs, while the DD tanks were launched from about 6,000 yards offshore, which was considerably further out than originally planned, and in rougher seas than those in which the unit had trained, resulting in the loss of 27 of the 32 DD tanks before they reached shore.Harrison, 309 Only two of the launched DD tanks reached the beach; another three were carried ashore when their LCT was unable to lower its ramp at sea.Harrison, 309AAR, 741st Tank Bn, June 1944 By the end of D-Day, the battalion had three combat ready tanks; 48 had either been sunk or destroyed in combat.Yeide, 53 Personnel losses were nearly as high, with 45 men killed and another 60 wounded during the day's action.Anderson, 207 For its actions on Omaha Beach on 6‚Äì7 June, the battalion was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.DA Pam 672-1, 363 After its initial assault and consolidation of the beachhead with the 1st Infantry Division in Normandy, the battalion was detached from the 1st Infantry Division on 15 June and attached to the 2nd Infantry Division. The initial coordination of the tanks with the infantry units as they began to fight inland in the bocage country of Normandy was not well executed and both infantry and tanks suffered casualties until the tactics and procedures of operating together were put in place. The tankers practiced with infantry and engineers at the platoon and tank/squad level for the remainder of June to perfect their techniques in working together.CARL, AAR 741st Tank Bn, June 1944 During this period, the battalion suffered numerous equipment losses due to tanks mired in the soft boggy soil; and personnel casualties as well, due to artillery barrages when the crews had to abandon the mired tanks. =Breakout= The 741st led the 2nd Infantry Division's assault on Hill 192 on 11‚Äì12 July in the breakout from Normandy. Hill 192, the dominant terrain east of St. L√¥, had to be taken in order for the American forces to liberate St. L√µ and establish an organized front line from which to launch Operation Cobra.Blumenson, pp. 149-152 After taking Hill 192, the 2nd Infantry Division went on the defensive until the start of Operation Cobra. On 26 July, the 2nd Infantry Division, with the 741st Tank Battalion continuing to provide direct fire support, advanced slowly, anchoring the left flank of the main assault of Operation Cobra, which took place to the west of St. L√µ. The division and the 741st advanced together as far as Tinchebray before new orders temporarily sent them on divergent paths. The 2nd Infantry Division was withdrawn from the line in order to reduce the fortress at BrestU.S. Army CMH while the 741st Tank Battalion reverted to 3rd Armored Group control, under whose direction the battalion raced across western France to the outskirts of Paris at Sceaux.AAR, 741st Tank Bn, August 1944741, 21 On 27 August, it was attached to the 28th Infantry Division in order to participate with the division in the Liberation Day Parade through Paris on 29 August, a tumultuous procession around the Arc de Triomphe and down the Champs-√âlys√©es just four days after the Germans had formally surrendered the city.741, 22‚Äì23 After a brief two-day respite, the battalion was on the march again; this time through Compi√®gne, the Aisne valley and Belgian Luxembourg and into the Duchy of Luxembourg,741, 22‚Äì23 reaching the West Wall in Germany by 9 September in the vicinity of Sevenig and Roscheid.AAR, 741st Tank Bn, September 1944Williams, 269 272 On 2 October, the 741st Tank Battalion was relieved from attachment to the 28th Infantry Division and again attached to the 2nd Infantry Division, with which it remained until the end of the war.AAR, 741st Tank Bn, October 1944 =Battle of the Bulge= M4 tank of Sgt. George K. Cuthbert, Jr., Company C, 741st Tank Battalion, burns at the intersection of Karl Heine Str. and Zschochersche Str., Leipzig, Germany, 18 April 1945 after being hit by a Panzerfaust. The entire crewSgt. George K. Cuthbert, Jr, Cpl. Kenneth W. Nickel, Pfc. Charles Lombardo, Pfc. George R. Wilson, and Pfc. William E. Glatt. perished in the battle. The company was attached to the 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division.741, 37AAR, 741st Tank Bn, April 1945 (T/5 R. W. Crampton) In support of the 2nd and 99th Infantry Divisions, the 741st, along with a company of the 644th Tank Destroyer Battalion, was instrumental in helping hold the northern shoulder of the Bulge in vicious fighting in and around Rocherath-Krinkelt during the German Ardennes Offensive (Battle of the Bulge) in December 1944. By now battle-seasoned veterans, tankers from the battalion resisted repeated numerous hard-pressed attacks by spearheading elements of the SS-heavy Sixth Panzer Army from 16‚Äì19 December. Facing superior German Panther and Tiger tanks (among others) supported by infantry, the battalion fought many small unit engagements, deftly stalking the German tanks in twos and threes until they could destroy or immobilize them with shots from the flanks or rear. On 19 December, elements of the battalion were the rear guard of an orderly withdrawal from Rocherath-Krinkelt to positions behind Wirtzfeld to the west and northwest. The resistance put up by the 2nd Infantry Division, along with the attached tanks and tank destroyers, thwarted the northern penetration of the German offensive, delaying their advance by three days, and caused them to side step to a less suitable road network, allowing allied reinforcements to prepare positions further to the west with which to blunt the attack. For their role at Rocherath, Companies A, B, and C of the 741st Tank Battalion were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.Cole, 125The citation is not listed in DA Pam 672-1, the official register of unit citations and campaign credits, and is therefore not listed among unit awards and decorations here. It is however cited in \\"Cole\\", the official U.S. Army history of the Battle of the Bulge, and is claimed in 741, the unofficial unit history published in Germany before the battalion returned to the United States. The citation narrative is quoted in full as follows: \\"Companies A, B, and C of the 741st Tank Battalion are cited for outstanding performance of duty against the enemy from 17‚Äì19 December 1944. During a violent enemy counterattack in the KRINKELT-ROCHERATH area, BELGIUM, personnel inexperienced in combat such as cooks, clerks and drivers, manned deadlined tanks and with superb courage met the headlong plunge of the enemy and inflicted severe casualties upon him, with utter disregard for their personal safety, the officers and men of these three gallant companies faced devastating hostile tank, anti-tank and self-propelled artillery fire and fought on tenaciously against overwhelming enemy forces. Again and again the infuriated enemy threw armor and infantry against the dauntless defenders but for three days and nights these assaults were turned back by the unwavering fortitude of the inspired men, when it became necessary to withdraw to a more tenable defensive position the tank men covered the withdrawal and were the last to leave the scene of the battle. During the bitter three-day engagement they had destroyed twenty seven enemy tanks, five armored vehicles and two trucks. Their indomitable fighting spirit and unflinching devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of the armed forces\\". ‚Äì GO 157, HQ, Third Army, 1 July 1945. See 741: D-Day to V-E Day741, flyleaf =Advance into Germany= After the Battle of the Bulge, the battalion refitted and resupplied in the vicinity of Berg and Robertville, Belgium, still in support of the 2nd Infantry Division ‚Äì A Company was attached to the 99th Infantry Division near Elsenborn, but it was soon returned to battalion control. Beginning on 15 January 1945, the battalion was gradually recommitted to combat operations in support of the 2nd Infantry Division as it once again began advancing eastward into Germany.AAR, 741st Tank Bn, January 1945 In supporting the 2nd Infantry Division, the 741st Tank Battalion followed the division's path, entering Germany at Gem√ºnd on 4 March 1945. It reached the Rhine at Bad Breisig on 10 March, and briefly guarded the bridge at Remagen from 12‚Äì20 March. The division took G√∂ttingen on 8 April and Leipzig on 18 April. The battalion's tanks transported lead elements of the division some 200 miles from 1‚Äì3 May 1945 all the way to the Czech border, and had reached Plze≈à, Czechoslovakia, by 6 May, two days before hostilities ended on 8 May.U.S. Army CMH741, 39AAR, 741st Tank Bn, May 1945 =Post war= The battalion was withdrawn to Germany and briefly took up occupation duties before returning to the United States. The unit arrived in New York on 25 October and was inactivated at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, on 27 October 1945. After several years as an inactive unit, on 1 February 1949, the battalion was redesignated as the 396th Heavy Tank Battalion and allotted to the U.S. Army Reserve. The battalion was activated at Spokane, Washington, on 5 March 1949 and assigned to the 96th Infantry Division. Despite the outbreak of the Korean War, the battalion was not called to active duty and, on 1 March 1952, was again redesignated as the 741st Tank Battalion and inactivated.Sawicki, p. 315 Unit awards and decorations *Presidential Unit Citation, 6‚Äì7 June 1944, War Department General Order 70‚Äì45.DA Pam 672-1, 363 *Belgian Fourrag√®re: 13‚Äì19 December 1944 and 19‚Äì30 December 1944, Department of the Army General Order 43‚Äì50.DA Pam 672-1, 363 *Occupation Credit, 2 May ‚Äì 4 June 1945, Germany.DA Pam 672-1, 363 Notes =Footnotes= References  Bibliography  *Anderson, Jr., Richard C.

She ran a thriving astrological consulting business, gained widespread notability for successfully defending her astrological practice in court, and wrote a number of popular books about astrology, including Astrology: Your Place in the Sun (1927), Astrology: Your Place Among the Stars (1930), and her autobiography, The Bowl of Heaven (1926). While Aleister Crowley ghostwrote her books on astrology, Adams is an acknowledged contributor to Crowley's own astrological text The General Practice of Astrology. She has been described as \\"America's first astrological superstar\\".Bromley, David G. The Future of New Religious Movements, p.50. Mercer University Press, 1987. . Biography Adams was born on 8 February 1868 in Jersey City, New Jersey, to a conservative family. Her father died when she was 15 months old. Before Adams began working as an astrologer full-time, she became engaged to a Mr. Lord, who was believed to be her employer. Although she said that she was initially in love with him, she lost any feelings that she had for him and subsequently broke the engagement. She was the \\"companion\\" of Emma Viola Sheridan Fry (educator, journalist, playwright, suffragist)Ohles, Frederik, Shirley M. Ohles, and John G. Ramsay. 1997.

Thousands of subscribers to her astrological newsletter followed her advice to invest in stocks during the run-up to the Stock Market Crash of 1929. The Crash of 1929, PBS American Experience Evangeline Adams died in 1932. Astrological practice and controversies It was towards the end of her career that Adams took to publishing books and raising her profile within popular media. For most of her working life, she ran a thriving astrological practice based on consultation by person or mail. This grew to employ several assistants and stenographers. For a number of years Adams employed Crowley as a ghost-writer. Their business relationship eventually turned into an acrimonious one, which brought copyright issues of \\"who really wrote what\\", with regards to Crowley's General Principles of Astrology (now settled with the book being attributed to Crowley but with a recognized contribution by Adams). Adams was arrested three times in New York City for fortune telling, in 1911, 1914 and 1923. Although practicing astrology was not legal at that time, all the cases brought against her were unsuccessful and the May 1914 trial brought particular notability due to the Judge's acquittal \\"of all wrong doing\\" and praise of her skill, after she gave him an astrology reading describing the character of his son from his birth data. Adams was well paid by her clients for her predictions. She was said to successfully predict changes in the stock market. However, author Carol Krismann noted that: > Skeptics point out that Adams had no knowledge of economics and that her > predictions were always fuzzy, foretelling disaster but not specific > disasters, and telling that the market would go up when in fact the country > was in a period of remarkable growth in the stock market. People who > believed often forget the erroneous predictions and used the ones that > happened to come true to \\"prove\\" that she was accurate.Krismann, Carol. > Encyclopedia of American Women in Business: A-L. GreenWood Press, 2005. p. > 7. Adams' most infamous failed prediction was that the \\"stocks might climb to heaven\\" a few weeks before the 1929 crash. Investment analyst Kenneth Fisher has written that her few successful predictions were publicized whilst her misses were ignored by those desperate to believe. He described Adams as an \\"obvious quack with no real investment knowledge.\\"Fisher, Kenneth. 100 Minds That Made the Market. Wiley, 2007. p. 265.

He studied at the Glasgow Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music, London, where he studied under Maurice Sons, a pupil of Henryk Wieniawski and leader of the Queen's Hall Orchestra. He modelled his violin playing on Fritz Kreisler. Early in his career, he arranged music for several local silent cinemas. He also played in the cinema trio; and it was here that he met his wife, cellist Dorothy Dorman. In 1922, he broadcast as a solo violinist for the first time. Between 1932 and 1936, he led the Scottish Orchestra in Glasgow under John Barbirolli, then was asked by Sir Thomas Beecham to lead the London Philharmonic Orchestra in succession to Paul Beard, who had joined the BBC Symphony Orchestra. During World War II, McCallum led the National Symphony Orchestra and played with the London Studio Players and the BBC's Overseas Music Unit. After the war, McCallum rejoined Beecham, this time as leader of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. On the First American Tour of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in 1950, Beecham fell ill.

Reuther Liberal Arts Building (viewed from the west) houses the majority of the classes at HFC including math, English, and a variety of foreign language courses. Henry Ford College (HFC) is a public two-year college in Dearborn, Michigan. The institution, established in 1938 by the Dearborn Fordson Public Schools Board of Education, is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. The institution was originally named Fordson Junior College. It adopted the name Dearborn Junior College in 1946, then Henry Ford Community College (HFCC) in 1952, after the Henry Ford Trade School which closed and whose assets were transferred to the Dearborn School Board of Education. The name was changed to Henry Ford College in 2014. Degrees HFC offers a bachelor's degree in Culinary Arts and Hospitality and many associate degrees and certificate programs in a wide variety of liberal arts, fine arts, culinary arts, business, STEM, and health science disciplines, in addition to skilled trades programs (see separate section below). The college also has a Center for Lifelong Learning which offers non-credit courses for personal enrichment or professional development. Other offerings include an honors program and a chapter of Phi Theta Kappa (Alpha Xi Mu chapter). It also holds discipline-specific accreditations for many programs. Online classes In addition to courses held on campus, HFC offers to students more than 100 online courses as well as hybrid courses, which split classroom time with online instruction. These courses provide convenience, for students who cannot, or do not wish to, commute to campus. Skilled trades and apprenticeships The School of Business, Entrepreneurship, and Professional Development offers training programs for people employed in skilled industrial occupations (primarily the apprentice- based skilled trades) and for people interested in entry into skilled trades occupations. Established in cooperation with industry, these programs provide theoretical and practical knowledge and the competencies required to supplement on-the-job training. Programs vary from a single course that quickly provides specific knowledge and skills, to a complete curriculum that provides comprehensive related instruction. Because the programs are employer- based, many programs operate on a plan of three consecutive 15-week semesters in fall, winter, and spring/summer to provide year-round instruction. The School offers a variety of curricula for apprentice-based and similarly skilled industrial occupations. Each major curriculum consists of developmental, apprenticeship foundation, and trade-specific foundation courses. Although generic trade-specific curricula are available for approximately 40 major industrial trade classifications, each sponsoring company can work with the college to modify the curricula to meet its specific training needs. Transferring/graduating HFC guarantees that credits earned at its institution will be accepted in transfers to four-year colleges. The college also guarantees to refund all tuition increases to any student who graduates within four years of starting a program.Tuition Freeze Guarantee Athletics Henry Ford's intercollegiate sports teams include men's baseball, basketball, golf and wrestling, and women's basketball, softball, golf, and volleyball. The school also a nationally-recognized club roller hockey program, and several intramural teams. Financial support As a public institution, the school gets support from several sources: state appropriations, student tuition and fees, local Dearborn School District property taxes, auxiliary activities, and both state and local grants. Enrollment In the most recent academic year, Henry Ford enrolled more than 17,000 students (13,000 per semester) and had nearly 1,000 employees, including full-time and part-time. Campuses Henry Ford offers classes on two campuses in Dearborn, Michigan. The main campus is located on the southwest corner of Ford Road and Evergreen, just north of the University of Michigan-Dearborn campus. The East Campus is home to two buildings - HFC's Michigan Technical Education Center (M-TEC) and the state-of-the-art nursing building. East Campus is located on Schaefer Road just north of Rotunda.

The 116th episode overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 14, 2004. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. In the episode, Cartman masquerades as a robot, named AWESOM-O, for Butters in an attempt to obtain an embarrassing video tape of himself that is in Butters' possession. While Butters is thrilled to have found a new best friend, Hollywood is after the phony robot to develop their next big blockbuster and the U.S. Army believes AWESOM-O is a new secret weapon. Plot Cartman plays a prank on Butters by disguising himself in a crude cardboard suit as a robot named \\"A.W.E.S.O.M.-O 4000\\" and by putting himself in a crate \\"from Japan\\" on Butters's doorstep. Cartman is planning to befriend Butters so that he can discover his most embarrassing secrets, which will allow him to blackmail him and/or embarrass him in school. Butters falls for the trick and reveals highly embarrassing personal secrets. However, just as Cartman is about to reveal his identity, Butters mentions that he himself knows one of Cartman's secrets: Butters has a videotape of Cartman doing a Britney Spears dance routine to a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake while dressed as her and making out with the cutout, which he plans to show to his classmates the next time Cartman plays a prank on him. Cartman, terrified of Butters' plan of revenge, searches desperately for the tape (while having the robot suit on, or Butters will know AWESOM-O was another prank), but to no avail. Cartman soon begins to starve because Butters believes that, since he is a robot, he does not need to eat. Butters also forces the robot to do all his chores for him, including some of the more unpleasant tasks. With the agreement of Ms. Cartman, who is willing to temporarily let her son off punishment for trying to exterminate the Jews two weeks prior, Butters' parents (knowing who AWESOM-O really is, but thinking it is an elaborate game that Butters is in on) decide to let Cartman come along with Butters on a trip to Los Angeles to see his aunt. Cartman realizes that he will have to accompany Butters on the trip, in order to keep up his disguise. Upon arriving, he is so hungry and worn out after wearing the suit for a whole airplane ride that he makes up an excuse to use the bathroom and proceeds to eat toothpaste. During their visit to Universal Studios Hollywood, two movie producers find out about the \\"robot\\" and decide to hire him to create movie ideas. Cartman, as the robot, comes up with over two thousand terrible, nonsensical film concepts (800 of which would star Adam Sandler), which the movie producers all find brilliant. To make matters worse for Cartman, the fortune that he makes from the movie ideas is donated to charity by Butters, who believes that AWESOM-O has no need for the money. Meanwhile, the U.S. military hears about AWESOM-O, and decides to capture it and make it into a weapon. Cartman flees the movie studio in panic after a film producer tries to engage in sexual activity with him, thinking that he may also be a \\"pleasure model\\". The military captures Cartman by shocking him and conveying him to a secret base. Cartman tries to explain that he is really just a kid, but the military believes he is a robot with artificial intelligence enabling him to think like a human, even possessing the memories of a nonexistent eight-year-old child. A scientist, moved by this, attempts to save Cartman, who is about to reveal that he is a human when Butters shows up to rescue him. He has to maintain his disguise, allowing the military to kill the rebellious scientist. Butters pleads with the military to spare AWESOM-O, and the general is touched. Just as it appears he will get off undetected, Cartman farts, and his attempts to cover it up cause everyone‚Äîincluding Butters‚Äîto suspect and finally discover his true identity. Butters carries out his promise and shows the video to the whole town, as well as the movie producers and the military, at a special screening. The theater is filled with wall-to-wall laughter. As Butters finally celebrates his revenge and the military general calls Cartman a \\"little faggot,\\" Cartman, ridiculed and upset, simply uttering, \\"Lame.\\" Production \\"Awesom-O\\" has one of the shortest production cycles in South Parks history, being produced in just three days while series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone attended a wedding in Hawaii. The episode starts with a cold open stating that an old episode of the show will \\"not been seen tonight\\" because of \\"tragic events in Hawaii\\". The name of Cartman's robotic alter ego is derived from Honda's ASIMO humanoid robot. The song \\"Let Me Tell You About My Robot Friend\\" sung by Butters in the episode is a parody rendering of \\"Girlfriend\\" by Harry Nilsson. Home release \\"Awesom-O\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Parks eighth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 29, 2006. The set includes brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode. The episode was also released on the two-disc DVD collection A Little Box of Butters.

Over the years, they have recorded both sacred and secular music as a solo act for various record companies, including Capitol Records, RCA Victor Records, Columbia Records, Decca Records, Vocalion Records, Stop Records, and many other smaller independent labels. However, in the mid-1950's, along with their solo career, they began lending their vocal talents to featured artists as background vocalists in recording sessions. They are widely known for providing background vocals for Elvis Presley, in live appearances, recordings and feature films from 1956 to 1972. The group has worked in the recording studio, on stage, and on television with many country, gospel and rock and roll artists. Their background voices can be heard on at least one Grammy winning recording every decade from the awards inception through the mid 2000's. The first in 1959 and the last in 2007, for a span of 6 decades. Group history =Early years= The history of the Jordanaires can be traced back to the early 1940s, and the original Foggy River Boys, which were made up of the Matthews brothers, all ordained ministers: Bill (b. LaFollette, Tennessee, 1923), Monty (b. Pulaski, Kentucky, 1927), Jack, and Matt. In 1948, Matt and Jack left to become full-time preachers and were replaced by Bob Hubbard (b. Chaffee, Missouri, 1928), also a minister, and bass singer Culley Holt (b. McAlester, Oklahoma, 1925), and pianist Bob Money. After three years Money was replaced as pianist by Gordon Stoker. At that time, they formed the new group as the Melodizing Matthews, in Springfield, Missouri, but soon changed the name to the Jordanaires, after Jordan Creek in Missouri. This starting lineup lasted until 1949; at that time, Bob Hubbard was drafted and was replaced by Hoyt Hawkins. Later that year, Monty and Bill Matthews left. Hawkins switched to baritone, and new lead Neal Matthews was recruited. Don Bruce came in as a new first tenor; however, he was drafted the next year. The group narrowed to a quartet, with Stoker taking over as first tenor. They became members of the Grand Ole Opry in 1949. They recorded for Capitol Records in the early 1950s, and began providing vocal accompaniment behind solo singers in Nashville, Tennessee. The lineup changed again in 1954, with Culley Holt leaving and new bass Hugh Jarrett coming in. The quartet became well known in the southern gospel realm, and what made them stand out from other quartets of that time was how they would bring spirituals (such as \\"Dry Bones\\") to a predominantly white audience. While continuing to turn out gospel albums of their own, the group become better known for the signature background harmonies they have provided on dozens of secular records. Jarrett remained until 1958; at that time, he was replaced by Ray Walker. =With Elvis Presley= On October 3, 1954, a teenage Elvis Presley made the drive from Memphis to Nashville to make his one and only performance on the Grand Ole Opry. Debuting his high-energy brand of rockabilly with \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\\" it was his first live performance on a radio broadcast. He had just recorded his first record at Sun studios, That's All Right just a few weeks prior. In 1955 the Jordanaires played a show in Memphis with Eddy Arnold to publicize their new syndicated TV series, Eddy Arnold Time (for the program the group used the name Gordonaires). They sang \\"Peace in the Valley\\", and when the show was over, Elvis Presley, an emerging singer, talked with them and said, \\"If I ever get a recording contract with a major company, I want you guys to back me up.\\"Graham, Charlotte \\"The Jordanaires\\" (February 22, 2003), The Clarion-Ledger (Jackson, MS), \\"Religion,\\" p. 1E. He was on Sun Records at that time. On January 10, 1956, Presley recorded his first session for RCA with guitarist Scotty Moore, bassist Bill Black, and drummer D. J. Fontana. \\"I Got a Woman\\", \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", and \\"Money Honey\\" were recorded. Presley asked his new label RCA Victor if the Jordanaires could appear on the recordings. The next day Gordon Stoker was called by Chet Atkins to do a session with a new young singer named Elvis. RCA had also just signed the Speer Family. Atkins asked Stoker to sing with Ben and Brock Speer so he could use them. The recording session for \\"I'm Counting on You\\" and \\"I Was the One\\" was the first session Presley did with vocal background. By April 1956, \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" was No. 1. After having done several more recording sessions in New York with Moore, Black, and Fontana, Presley flew to Nashville on April 14, 1956, to record \\"I Want You, I Need You, I Love You\\". Stoker was called again, to sing a vocal trio with Ben and Brock Speer. After the session, Presley took Stoker aside and told him (not knowing, at the time, why all the Jordanaires were not there) that he had wanted the Jordanaires. This time, Stoker saw to it‚Äîand Presley used the quartet on nearly every one of his recording sessions for the next 14 years. The quartet also appeared in some of Presley's movies, and on many of his television appearances. As Presley was about to start performing at the Hilton in Las Vegas, the Colonel's office called for the Jordanaires to work with Presley in the shows. They had 35 recording sessions already booked for the dates he needed, so they could not go. They got in touch with the Imperials, who had done the background vocals for Presley's album How Great Thou Art along with them, and the Imperials took the place of the Jordanaires. =Patsy Cline= The group appeared on all of Cline's Decca sessions from her first in November 1960 to her last in February 1963, during which time they backed her on songs such as: *\\"A Poor Man's Roses (Or a Rich Man's Gold)\\" *\\"Always\\" *\\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\\" *\\"Crazy\\" *\\"Crazy Arms\\" *\\"Faded Love\\" *\\"Foolin' Around\\" *\\"Half As Much\\" *\\"Have You Ever Been Lonely (Have You Ever Been Blue)?\\" *\\"Heartaches\\" *\\"I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love with You)\\" *\\"I Fall to Pieces\\" *\\"Leavin' On Your Mind\\" *\\"Love Letters In The Sand\\" *\\"San Antonio Rose\\" *\\"Seven Lonely Days\\" *\\"She's Got You\\" *\\"Someday (You'll Want Me To Want You)\\" *\\"South of the Border (Down Mexico Way)\\" *\\"Sweet Dreams\\" *\\"That's My Desire\\" *\\"The Wayward Wind\\" *\\"True Love\\" *\\"Walkin' After Midnight\\" (1961 recording) *\\"You Belong to Me\\" *\\"You Made Me Love You (I Didn't Want To Do It)\\" *\\"Your Cheatin' Heart\\" =After Elvis and Cline= The lineup consisting of Gordon Stoker, first tenor and manager, Neal Matthews, second tenor and lead, Hoyt Hawkins, baritone, and Ray Walker, bass, would be the group's most stable lineup, lasting throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In January 1978 the group performed a medley of Presley's songs on the NBC TV special Nashville Remembers Elvis on His Birthday. The group changed again in 1982, when Hoyt Hawkins died. His replacement was Duane West, formerly of Sonny James' backup group, the Southern Gentlemen. In 1990, the group provided backing vocals for Presley's former Sun Records labelmate Johnny Cash on his Mercury Records album Boom Chicka Boom. The group has also recorded with the Swedish group Vikingarna. The lineup remained constant for the rest of the decade, with West leaving due to an illness in 1999 and his death in 2002. His replacement was Louis Nunley, formerly of the Anita Kerr Singers. The Jordanaires were among hundreds of artists whose material was destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. =Deaths= Neal Matthews died on April 21, 2000. He was replaced by new lead Curtis Young. Hugh Jarrett died at 78 on May 31, 2008, from injuries sustained in an auto accident in March. Gordon Stoker died at 88 at his Brentwood, Tennessee, home on March 27, 2013, after a long illness. His son Alan confirmed that the Jordanaires were formally dissolved, per his father's wishes.

The oldest and most popular event of the Junior Orange Bowl International Youth Festival is the Junior Orange Bowl Parade in downtown Coral Gables. History Known as \\"The Largest International Youth Sports and Arts Festival,\\" the Junior Orange Bowl Youth Festival blossomed in 1948 when the first Junior Orange Bowl Parade journeyed through beautiful downtown Coral Gables. This was the wonderful beginning of a festival that is totally dedicated to \\"Celebrating Youth\\". The Junior Orange Bowl has grown into a year-long youth festival, offering community, academic, and athletic events for youth and families. The first Junior Orange Bowl Queen, Sandy Wirth, was crowned in 1951 starting a tradition of shaping and mentoring young community leaders. The 9 - 14-year- old girls are judged on poise, personality and presentation. Preliminary pageants are held throughout Miami-Dade, Broward, and Monroe Counties, as one queen, two princesses, and one little sister is chosen to be the Junior Orange Bowl community ambassadors each year. The Royal Court regularly volunteers at community service projects to develop leadership and philanthropic values in addition to their duties to be present and represent the Junior Orange Bowl at festival events. =Tennis= The sixties marked the introduction of several new events. In 1962 the Junior Orange Bowl International Tennis Championship was established for boys and girls that are 12 & 14 and under. Over the years the draw has included several great players who have gone on to gain stardom on the professional circuit. Tennis greats Chris Evert, Jimmy Connors, Mary Joe Fernandez, Monica Seles, Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf have all played in the Junior Orange Bowl tournament. Today the International Tennis Championship draws over 1,500 players from 75 countries and is widely known as one of the most respected youth tournaments in the world. =Golf= 1964 was the inaugural year for the International Golf Tournament, and the Girl's tournament was added in 1977. Top U.S. and foreign players 18 years and younger compete in this event which is now recognized as one of the world's most prestigious junior golf tournaments. This invitational has produced such professional stars as Andy North, Craig Stadler, Hal Sutton, Mark Calcavecchia, Bob Tway, Billy Mayfair, Willie Wood, and Jose Maria Olazabal. The Golf tournament continues to draw rising champions; Tiger Woods was the 1991 winner. =Other events= The early and mid-eighties saw more new events added to the festival as the Junior Orange Bowl began to develop its academic programs with the Creative Writing and Photography Contests. The National Basketball Classic was also added and has grown to include varsity, junior varsity, and middle school tournaments. Another great addition has been the Sports Ability Games, which caters to children with physical Disabilities and includes a three (3) day series of events. 1990 was a landmark year in the Junior Orange Bowl's history with the success of the festival's first-ever nighttime parade. Over 150,000 spectators attended this historic event. In 1993, a Pre-Parade show was added to the already exciting parade line-up. 1999 marked the emergence of the Cross Country Invitational, featuring some of South Florida's top middle and senior high school runners. The 2016 festival season featured the inaugural Robotics Competition. The first Robotics Competition to be hosted in Miami-Dade County, where 101 teams and 500 participants were a part of the event. The 2018 Festival is marked with the addition of a new International Soccer Cup. The International Soccer Cup will host soccer players ages 8‚Äì18 from local, national, and international club teams to compete in this inaugural event. The 2018 Festival Season is the 70th Anniversary of the prestigious Junior Orange Bowl. Currently, a focus is on developing educational and developmental opportunities for the students and athletes in the South Florida community. Community investments will be made to better serve the South Florida youth and tie in the great success of the competitive events for which the Junior Orange Bowl is best known.

Bosch licensed the concept to many automobile manufacturers. There are several variations of the technology offering technological development and refinement. D-Jetronic (1967‚Äì1979) Analogue fuel injection, 'D' is from meaning pressure. Inlet manifold depression (vacuum) is measured using a pressure sensor located in, or connected to the intake manifold, in order to calculate the duration of fuel injection pulses. Originally, this system was called Jetronic, but the name D-Jetronic was later created as a retronym to distinguish it from subsequent Jetronic iterations. D-Jetronic was essentially a further refinement of the Electrojector fuel delivery system developed by the Bendix Corporation in the late 1950s. Rather than choosing to erradicate the various reliability issues with the Electrojector system, Bendix instead licensed the design to Bosch. With the role of the Bendix system being largely forgotten D-Jetronic became known as the first widely successful precursor of modern electronic common rail systems; it had constant pressure fuel delivery to the injectors and pulsed injections, albeit grouped (2 groups of injectors pulsed together) rather than sequential (individual injector pulses) as on later systems. As in the Electrojector system, D-Jetronic used analogue circuitry, with no microprocessor nor digital logic, the ECU used about 25 transistors to perform all of the processing. Two important factors that lead to the ultimate failure of the Electrojector system: the use of paper-wrapped capacitors unsuited to heat-cycling and amplitude modulation (AM radio) signals to control the injectors were superseded. The still present lack of processing power and the unavailability of solid-state sensors meant that the vacuum sensor was a rather expensive precision instrument, rather like a barometer, with brass bellows inside to measure the manifold pressure. Although conceptually similar to most later systems with individual electrically controlled injectors per cylinder, and pulse-width modulated fuel delivery, the fuel pressure was not modulated by manifold pressure, and the injectors were fired only once per 2 revolutions on the engine (with half of the injectors being fired each revolution). The system was last used (with a Lucas designed timing mechanism and Lucas labels super-imposed on some components) on the Jaguar V12 engine (XJ12 and XJ-S) from 1975 until 1979. K-Jetronic (1973‚Äì1994) Mechanical fuel injection, 'K' stands for , meaning continuous. Commonly called 'Continuous Injection System (CIS) in the USA. K-Jetronic is different from pulsed injection systems in that the fuel flows continuously from all injectors, while the fuel pump pressurises the fuel up to approximately 5 bar (73.5 psi). The volume of air taken in by the engine is measured to determine the amount of fuel to inject. This system has no lambda loop or lambda control. K-Jetronic debuted in the 1973.5 Porsche 911T in January 1973, and was later installed into a number of Porsche, Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Lotus, Ferrari, Peugeot, Nissan, Renault, Volvo, Saab, TVR and Ford automobiles. The final car to use K-Jetronic was the 1994 Porsche 911 Turbo 3.6. Fuel is pumped from the tank to a large control valve called a fuel distributor, which divides the single fuel supply line from the tank into smaller lines, one for each injector. The fuel distributor is mounted atop a control vane through which all intake air must pass, and the system works by varying fuel volume supplied to the injectors based on the angle of a moving vane in the air flow meter, which in turn is determined by the volume of air passing the vane, and by the control pressure. The control pressure is regulated with a mechanical device called the control pressure regulator (CPR) or the warm-up regulator (WUR). Depending on the model, the CPR may be used to compensate for altitude, full load, and/or a cold engine. The injectors are simple spring-loaded check valves with nozzles; once fuel system pressure becomes high enough to overcome the counterspring, the injectors begin spraying. K-Jetronic (Lambda) First introduced in the Volvo 265 in 1976 and later used in the DeLorean in 1981. A variant of K-Jetronic with closed-loop lambda control, also named Ku-Jetronic, the letter u denominating USA. The system was developed to comply with U.S.A. state of California's California Air Resources Board exhaust emission regulations, and later replaced by KE-Jetronic. KE-Jetronic (1985‚Äì1993) Electronically controlled mechanical fuel injection. The engine control unit (ECU) may be either analog or digital, and the system may or may not have closed-loop lambda control. The system is based on the K-Jetronic mechanical system, with the addition of an electro-hydraulic actuator, essentially a fuel injector inline with the fuel return. Instead of injecting fuel into the intake, this injector allows fuel to bypass the fuel distributor, which varies the fuel pressure supplied to the mechanical injection components based on several inputs (engine speed, air pressure, coolant temperature, throttle position, lambda etc.) via the ECU. With the electronics disconnected, this system will operate as a K-Jetronic system.Robert Bosch GmbH (1985). Electronically Controlled Gasoline Fuel-Injected System with Lambda Closed-Loop Control - KE- Jetronic. Commonly known as 'CIS-E' in the USA. The later KE3 (CIS-E III) variant features knock sensing capabilities. L-Jetronic (1974‚Äì1989) Analog fuel injection. L-Jetronic was often called Air-Flow Controlled (AFC) injection to further separate it from the pressure-controlled D-Jetronic -- with the 'L' in its name derived from , meaning 'air'. In the system, air flow into the engine is measured by a moving vane (indicating engine load) known as the volume air flow sensor (VAF) -- referred to in German documentation as the LuftMengenMesser or LMM. L-Jetronic used custom-designed integrated circuits, resulting in a simpler and more reliable engine control unit (ECU) than the D-Jetronic's.Baggeroer, Artgur B. L-Jetronic fuel injection. July 1985. General OneFile. Web. 23 July 2012. L-Jetronic was used heavily in 1980s-era European cars, as well as BMW K-Series motorcycles. Licensing some of Bosch's L-Jetronic concepts and technologies, Lucas, Hitachi Automotive Products, NipponDenso, and others produced similar fuel injection systems for Asian car manufacturers. L-Jetronic manufactured under license by Japan Electronic Control Systems was fitted to the 1980 Kawasaki Z1000-H1, the world's first production fuel injected motorcycle. Despite physical similarity between L-Jetronic components and those produced under license by other manufacturers, the non-Bosch systems should not be called L-Jetronic, and the parts are usually incompatible. LE1-Jetronic, LE2-Jetronic, LE3-Jetronic (1981‚Äì1991) This is a simplified and more modern variant of L-Jetronic. The ECU was much cheaper to produce due to more modern components, and was more standardised than the L-Jetronic ECUs. As per L-Jetronic, a vane-type airflow sensor is used. Compared with L-Jetronic, the fuel injectors used by LE-Jetronic have a higher impedance. Three variants of LE-Jetronic exist: LE1, the initial version. LE2 (1984‚Äì), featured cold start functionality integrated in the ECU, which does not require the cold start injector and thermo time switch used by older systems. LE3 (1989‚Äì), featuring miniaturised ECU with hybrid technology, integrated into the junction box of the mass airflow meter. LU1-Jetronic, LU2-Jetronic (1983‚Äì1991) The same as LE1-Jetronic and LE2-Jetronic respectively, but with closed-loop lambda control. Initially designed for the US market. LH-Jetronic (1982‚Äì1998) Digital fuel injection, introduced for California bound 1982 Volvo 240 models. The 'LH' stands for - the hotwire anemometer technology used to determine the mass of air into the engine. This air mass meter is called HLM2 (Hitzdraht-LuftMassenmesser 2) by Bosch. The LH- Jetronic was mostly used by Scandinavian car manufacturers, and by sports and luxury cars produced in small quantities, such as Porsche 928. The most common variants are LH 2.2, which uses an Intel 8049 (MCS-48) microcontroller, and usually a 4 kB programme memory, and LH 2.4, which uses a Siemens 80535 microcontroller (a variant of Intel's 8051/MCS-51 architecture) and 32 kB programme memory based on the 27C256 chip. LH-Jetronic 2.4 has adaptive lambda control, and support for a variety of advanced features; including fuel enrichment based on exhaust gas temperature (ex. Volvo B204GT/B204FT engines). Some later (post-1995) versions contain hardware support for first generation diagnostics according to ISO 9141 (a.k.a. OBD-II) and immobiliser functions. Mono-Jetronic (1988‚Äì1995) Digital fuel injection. This system features one centrally positioned fuel injection nozzle. In the US, this kind of single- point injection was marketed as 'throttle body injection' (TBI, by GM), or 'central fuel injection' (CFI, by Ford). Mono-Jetronic is different from all other known single-point systems, in that it only relies on a throttle position sensor for judging the engine load. There are no sensors for air flow, or intake manifold vacuum. Mono-Jetronic always had adaptive closed-loop lambda control, and due to the simple engine load sensing, it is heavily dependent on the lambda sensor for correct functioning. The ECU uses an Intel 8051 microcontroller, usually with 16 kiB of program memory and without advanced on-board diagnostics (OBD-II became a requirement in model-year 1996.)

Vis is centered on 90.3 square kilometers of land. Its widest point spans 17 kilometers and from north to south its maximum length is 8 kilometers. It is approximately 45-55 kilometers from the Dalmatian coastline to the island of Vis. The coastline of Vis measures 76.7 kilometers long and is marked by bays, coves and natural ports.Komi≈æa - Komi≈æa, Otok Vis, Dalmacija, Hrvatska Climate Komi≈æa experiences warm and temperate winters with warm to hot summers with the landward breeze making it the most moderate climate in the Republic of Croatia. The climate allows for Tropical and Mediterranean vegetation, including palms, carobs, olives, grapes and lemons. The average rainfall is about per square meter. The island of Vis has a number of natural sources of drinking water from the natural spring water reservoirs. The island is also home to twelve distinct types of island vegetation. Vis has been marked as one of the ten most environmentally preserved islands in the Mediterranean by the World Organization for Environmental Protection. Landmarks Church of Saint Nicholas Fort of Komi≈æa The settlement of Komi≈æa was first mentioned in the 12th century. In the 13th century, the BenedictinesFootprint Croatia by Jane Foster established the St. Nicholas Monastery on elevated ground above the settlement. The oldest part of the monastery is a single-naved Romanesque church with a semi-circular apse dating from the 13th century. In the period between the 14th and 17th century a large five-naved church was built; its central nave dates back to the beginning of the 16th century and the large Baroque sanctuary to 1652. Two high square towers in Romanesque style are what is left from the original monastery fortifications; the tower above the church facade was converted into a bell tower in 1770. The citadel in the port was built in 1585. The church of Our Lady of PiratesCroatia by James Stewart consists of three single-naved churches connected via internal arches. The oldest of the three is the middle church (16th century), while the side churches were built in the 17th and the 18th centuries. The church features Baroque altars, an organ from 1670 and a 17th-century silver relief of Our Lady of the Rosary. The fortified church of St. Roch (Rocco) was erected in 1763, and the church of Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows (the New Church) dates back to 1756. The Art Nouveau building of the Community Centre from the beginning of the 20th century is a work by the architect A. Bezic; the Memorial Centre was designed by S. Planic, and the author of the reliefs and mosaics is B. Mardesic. The Gallery of Duro Tiljak has been open in Komi≈æa since 1966, and since 1984 also the Gallery of Boris Mardesic. Komi≈æa is well known for its close proximity to the island of Bi≈°evo, which is visited by 10,000 tourists each year who come to see the unique Blue Grotto. Bi≈°evo, in the early 1900s with a population of about 200 residents, was noted for bee-keeping and wild honey production. Popular sights also include the St. Nicholas' Convent monastery from the 13th century, the Kastel (Venetian Tower) in the harbor from the 16th century and the Baroque sanctuary from the 16th century. There is also the annual celebration of Komi≈æa's fishing heritage, Ribarska Noƒá (Fisherman's Night). The festival features fireworks, many types of traditional food, souvenir shops, ice cream stands, and a children's kayak race. Winemaking Today winemaking is done mostly for personal consumption. The money generated by winemaking is not enough for a commercial industry. The grape harvest is performed in mid- September, with the grapes being field crushed and then fermented for 3‚Äì10 days. This is then pressed once and barrel aged for about 2‚Äì4 months. The pressed mash is reconstituted with water and allowed to ferment for a few more days and is pressed again, with this pressing being distilled and used to make the famous \\"grappa\\". Generally the vines are sprayed once with insecticide and then blue stoned (copper sulfate) about four times during the growing season. The distillation of rosemary oil results in the production of up to 24,000 pounds oil per year. Fishing tradition In the early 20th century many Komi≈æini fishermen emigrated to America and settled in Washington state. They were among the first to introduce modern fishing methods and helped pioneer the North Pacific salmon fishing industry. In the earliest days of the 20th century these intrepid men fished the fertile waters of Puget Sound. By 1920 they were voyaging from their home ports of Everett, Seattle, Bellingham, Gig Harbor and Anacortes, on wooden vessels typically of no more than 60'. Equipped with only a compass and often highly inaccurate charts to navigate by, they traveled to the abundant Alaskan salmon fishing grounds of Prince William Sound, Southeast Alaska and False Pass, on the edge of the Bering Sea. This perilous journey covered thousand miles, often taking weeks, and from which countless men did not return. Descendants of these men still fish the same waters and take the same perilous journeys today.[www.purealaskasalmon.com/our-story-pure-alaska- salmoncompany][www.portofeverett.com/docs/nmr_fishing.pdf][www.croatia.org/.../croatians/...croatians.../FISH- FISH%] Komii≈æni fishermen also emigrated to California's San Pedro / Long Beach area and Monterey California's Cannery Row (immortalized in Steinbeck's novel of the same name) and were highly successful in the then thriving California sardine fisheries of the first half of the 20th century. Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana is home to another group descended from Komi≈æini fishermen who left Dalmatia over a century ago.Croatians in California, 1849-1999 by Adam S. Eterovich As a result of this influence it is still local custom to serve at least one meal every day that includes seafood. Traditionally these fishermen used the falku≈°a, a unique wooden sailboat that is tapered narrowly on both ends.Hrvatsko Brodovlje by Mithad Kozlicic  Notable residents  * Ranko Marinkoviƒá (1913‚Äì2001), an acclaimed Croatian novelist and dramatist born in Komi≈æa.

The 46 defense was originally developed and popularized with the Chicago Bears by their defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan, who later became head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles and Arizona Cardinals. Unlike most defensive formations that take their names from the number of defensive linemen and linebackers on the field (i.e. the 4-3 defense has 4 linemen and 3 linebackers), the name \\"46\\" originally came from the jersey number of Doug Plank, who was a starting strong safety for the Bears when Ryan developed the defense, a role typically played in the formation as a surrogate linebacker.Mackall, Dave. Q&A; with Doug Plank (October 19, 2006), The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. Retrieved on February 16, 2008.  Description  The 46 defense was an innovative defense with a unique defensive front, designed to confuse and put pressure on the opposing offense, especially their quarterback. Compared to a 4-3 base defense, the 46 dramatically shifts the defensive line to the weak side (the opposite end from the offense's tight end), with both guards and the center \\"covered\\" by the left defensive end and both defensive tackles. This front forced offenses to immediately account for the defenders lined up directly in front of them, making it considerably harder to execute blocking assignments such as pulling, trapping and pass protection in general. Moreover, the weak side defensive end would be aligned one to two yards outside the left offensive tackle, leaving the opposing tackle man-on-man when trying to block the pass rush. Another key feature of the 46 is that both outside linebackers tend to play on the strong side of the formation. To avoid confusion, the strong and weak side linebackers (who are no longer lined up on opposite sides) are often renamed the 'Jack' and 'Charlie' linebackers, respectively. The linebackers line up behind the linemen somewhere between one and three yards from the line of scrimmage. The primary tactic is to rush between five and eight players on each play, either to get to the quarterback quickly or disrupt running plays, although dropping some players back into pass coverage after seemingly indicating that they will blitz (see zone blitzing) is another method of creating confusion. Ryan would use all of these rushers to out-man and overwhelm the offense. Another major key to the 46 is the ability of the cornerbacks to play man free and bump and run coverage. Bump and run can allow the defense to take away the quarterback's immediate decision-making ability, by disrupting the timing of short routes needed to make a quick throw to beat the 46 defense.Coaching Football's 46 Defense (The Art & Science of Coaching Series) (Paperback) by Rex Ryan The formation was very effective in the 1980s NFL because it often negated a team's running game and forced them to throw the ball. This was difficult for many teams at the time because most offensive passing games centered on the play-action pass, a situation that often favored the defense even further with the quarterback lined up to receive the snap from directly behind the center. Currently, the 46 is rarely used in professional and college football. This is largely because of multiple receiver and spread formations.Jaworski et al., pp. 189-190 The eight man line that the 46 presented was most effective against the two back, two wide receiver sets common in the 1980s. A weakness of the 46 defense is that with eight defensive players lining up near the line of scrimmage and only three in the secondary, it leaves areas open for receivers to catch passes. Also, timed passes can be thrown before the players blitzing have a chance to reach the quarterback. When the Miami Dolphins gave the Bears their only loss of the 1985 season, Miami exploited these weaknesses with quarterback Dan Marino's quick release of the ball, and their receivers' ability to beat the one-on-one coverage of Chicago's cornerbacks. Another problem with the 46 defense is that most teams do not have enough impact players to run the 46 as effectively as the Bears and Ryan's other two major successes, the late 1980s Philadelphia Eagles for which he was head coach and the 1993 Houston Oilers for whom he was defensive coordinator, did. Those teams fielded some of the best front-seven defenses ever, and included such players as Jerome Brown, Mike Singletary, Steve McMichael, Richard Dent, Dan Hampton, Clyde Simmons, Reggie White, Otis Wilson, Seth Joyner, William Fuller, and Wilber Marshall. In today's game, the 46 defense is often simplified to its main component of walking the strong safety up to the line of scrimmage as an eighth man in the box to help contain the run. Defenses today may also run safety blitzes and corner blitzes at crucial moments without committing wholly to the \\"46\\" defense. Up front, teams still use the concept of the \\"T-N-T\\" alignment, where two defensive ends are covering (lined up directly across from) the guards, and a nose tackle is covering the center. In the case of a zone-blocking scheme, this makes it difficult for the offensive linemen to reach any of the linebackers on the second level. Lining up This is where defensive players would line up against a normal Pro Set offense.Ryan and Walker, p. 9. * Defensive ends: The weak side defensive end lines up one to two yards outside the weak side offensive tackle. During run plays, his objective is to protect against reverses and counters. Otherwise, on pass plays, he goes after the quarterback. The strong side defensive end lines up on the outside shoulder of the strong side guard. His objective is to make sure that the offensive guard in front of him does not push him inside and does not get released to block the linebacker.Ryan and Walker, p. 24 and p. 29. * Defensive tackles: The weak side defensive tackle lines up on the outside shoulder of the guard. His main objective is the same as the strong side defensive end - to avoid being pinched inside or letting the guard release to block the linebacker. The other defensive tackle essentially becomes a nose guard and lines up in front of the center. * Linebackers: The jack linebacker lines up on the outside shoulder of the strong tight end and just slightly behind the line of scrimmage. This allows him to contain runs on the outside, to blitz, or to drop into multiple coverages on the pass. The charley linebacker also lines up slightly behind the line of scrimmage, but on the inside (rather than outside) shoulder of the tight end. This allows him to cover the tight end and make it difficult for the tight end to achieve a quick release. The middle linebacker lines up about four to four and a half yards behind the line of scrimmage and directly in front of the strong offensive tackle.Ryan and Walker, Chapter 7. * Safeties: The strong safety lines up four to four and a half yards off the line of scrimmage and stands directly in front of the weak side tackle. The free safety lines up about ten to twelve yards away from the line of scrimmage and will stand directly in front of the weak side guard. * Cornerbacks: The corners will line up on the line of scrimmage in bump and run coverage, or at times will line up seven to eight yards off of the line in front of their receivers in man-free coverage. When three or more receivers are used by the offense, the defense makes what is called a jayhawk adjustment. The charlie linebacker will step back to where the middle linebacker was in the normal alignment, the middle linebacker will move to where the strong safety was aligned and the strong safety will move out to cover the third receiver. If the offense uses a fourth receiver, the middle linebacker lines up in front of the center and the charlie linebacker would cover the fourth receiver. To note, there is nothing particularly innovative about this particular set of assignments. For example, the strong safety could assume either the charley or the jack linebacker role. The linebacker displaced would line up over the weak side offensive tackle, where the strong safety is normally found.Ryan and Walker, p. 20.

She has also held positions at the International Crisis Group, Connect U.S. Fund, and the Public Interest Declassification Board. In 2012 she ran unsuccessfully for Florida Senate District 4. Soderberg filed the paperwork to run for Congress as a Democrat in the 2018 midterm elections in Florida's 6th congressional district.http://soderbergforcongress.com/?reqp=1&reqr;=MzWkpzIipzI0p2WypTWuqTIlMzLhpTW6  Education and early career  Soderberg was born in Santurce, Puerto Rico, where her father, a civil engineer, was working on a project, and grew up in Baltimore and Tulsa. She attended Vanderbilt University, spent her junior year in Paris, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in French and Economics. She spoke fluent French and \\"wanted to do something international but wasn‚Äôt sure what\\" so she ended up taking a \\"boring\\" job at a bank. From 1982 to 1984, she worked as a Budget Analyst at the Bank of New England in Boston, where she prepared its budget and made regular reports to the Board of Directors regarding loan portfolios. She was accepted to Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service in Washington, D.C., where she took a class with Madeleine Albright (who later became Bill Clinton's Secretary of State), who told her to get into politics. She graduated in 1984 with a Master of Science degree, where she concentrated on international economics and political risk analysis.  Political career  = Early career = Albright got her a job counting delegates for Walter Mondale's campaign from 1983 to 1984 ahead of the 1984 presidential election, which he lost. She served as foreign policy advisor to Senator Edward M. Kennedy in the U.S. Senate from 1985 to 1988 and 1989 to 1992. (She took a small break to work as the deputy issues director for foreign policy for the Dukakis campaign ahead of the 1988 presidential election.) = Clinton administration = In 1992, George Stephanopoulos, the Clinton campaign's communications director, asked Soderberg to join Clinton‚Äôs campaign in the 1992 presidential election. She accepted and moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, for eight months to manage foreign policy. After Clinton won the election, she was the Staff Director at the National Security Council. From 1993 to 1997, she was the Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the third-ranking NSC official at the White House. She is the first woman in the position, and was responsible for day-to-day crisis management, briefing the President, developing U.S. national security policy at the highest levels of government, and handling issues regarding the press and U.S. Congress. She engaged the IRA and helped negotiate ceasefire in Northern Ireland in 1994, which she pointed to as her proudest achievement in diplomacy. In 1997, Clinton nominated her to be the Alternate Representative to the United Nations as a Presidential Appointee, with the rank of Ambassador. Her responsibilities included representing the United States at the UN Security Council, participated in missions to key conflict areas, and promoted U.S. national security policy. Soderberg participated in a UN mission to Indonesia and East Timor in November 2000. She also negotiated key United Nations' resolutions regarding the Middle East and Africa, conducted shuttle diplomacy in Latin America, assisted in the development of the Administration's policies toward political and economic normalization with Vietnam, and advised on policies toward China, Japan, Russia, Angola, the Balkans, and Haiti. = Later career = She is currently President and CEO of Soderberg Global Solutions and Director of the Public Service Leadership Program at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville. From 2001 to she was Vice President for Multilateral Affairs of the International Crisis Group, where she advocated conflict prevention at the United Nations and other multilateral institutions. Although she had moved to Jacksonville, Florida, in 2004, she served as President of Connect U.S. Fund, a Washington, D.C.-based foundation that promoted responsible global engagement, from 2009 to 2013. In that capacity, she advocated conflict prevention at the United Nations and other multilateral institutions. She also served as President of the Sister Cities Program of the City of New York from 2002 to 2006. She is also Director of the Public Service Leadership Program at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, which encourages students, who are often first-generation students and refugees, to pursue careers in public service, including in government and at nonprofit organizations. She also teaches two courses in American foreign policy. Soderberg was a foreign- policy adviser to Michael Bloomberg during his second mayoral term, when he was receiving regular briefings on foreign policy from Soderberg, Henry Kissinger, and other experts. One source called her \\"Bloomberg's Condi\\" and spurred rumors that he was contemplating a 2008 presidential campaign. In 2011, Jacksonville Mayor Alvin Brown appointed Soderberg to the Jacksonville International Business Coalition, and in 2013, he appointed her to the Board of the Jacksonville Port Authority. After Lenny Curry defeated Alvin Brown in the 2015 mayoral election, the new mayor requested she resign, which she did \\"with deep regret\\" with two years remaining on her four-year term. In 2011, she was appointed by President Barack Obama to serve as Chair of the Public Interest Declassification Board (PIDB), an advisory committee established by the U.S. Congress to promote public access to U.S. national security decisions. In 2012 PIDB published a report calling for an overhaul of the U.S. government classification system. Soderberg wrote that the system was \\"outdated and incapable of dealing adequately with the large volumes of classified information generated in an era of digital communications and information systems\\". She is on the Board of Advisors to the President of the Naval Postgraduate School and Naval War College. She is Vice Chairman of the Board of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy. = Florida politics = Soderberg was a candidate for Florida Senate District 4 in the 2012 elections. She ran against Aaron Bean, former Florida State House Representative, in the newly open district. She ultimately lost but outperformed traditional voting patterns by 6 points. It was reported on July 12, 2017, that Soderberg had filed paperwork to run for Congress as a Democrat in the 2018 midterm elections in Florida's 6th Congressional District.http://soderbergforcongress.com/?reqp=1&reqr;=MzWkpzIipzI0p2WypTWuqTIlMzLhpTW6 The current incumbent Ron DeSantis officially announced his candidacy for Governor on January 5, 2018.

The affair caused severe embarrassment to the Fox administration and resulted in the resignations of Carlos Rojas, the head of the presidential acquisitions committee, and at least three members of Rojas' staff. Background In June 2001, the Mexican newspaper Milenio reported that the president's office had spent around US $440,000 to redecorate two cabins in the presidential compound, Los Pinos. Among the items bought were embroidered towels at $400 apiece and a set of sheets costing at least $1,500. The spending came to light after Milenio reporters utilised Compranet, a Mexican government website established to make government procurement more transparent, to scrutinise the expenditure of the presidential office. Milenio's report caused immediate controversy, as Fox had promised during his election campaign to run an austere government and rein in excessive spending. Fox responded by instructing Francisco Barrio, the chief government auditor, to investigate the expenditures. Barrio reported that he had found irregularities including overpricing, purchases of items that had not been ordered and improper down- payments. Journalists carrying out follow-up investigations found that business addresses listed on expenses reports were false, and that the telephone numbers of suppliers used by the government had been disconnected. Fox acknowledged that the expenditures were of importance to all Mexicans and promised that those found responsible would be fired. He accepted the resignation of Carlos Rojas, the head of the presidential acquisitions committee and a longtime friend of the president. Three members of Rojas' staff also resigned and three more were suspended. The president sought to turn the expenses controversy to his advantage by saying the fact that his own government had put the expenditures into the public domain proved that it was committed to transparency.

It was centered on the transfer of 500 million pesos (US$53 million) to the PRI candidate for the 2000 Presidential Elections, Francisco Labastida Ochoa, from Pemex, Mexico's national oil company. A year long of intense investigations, hearings, and negotiations occurred in 2002, but no one was prosecuted by the Procuradur√≠a General de la Rep√∫blica (PGR) in the end. The National Electoral Institute (IFE) still found PRI guilty of violating the electoral law and fined them a huge sum of over 1 billion pesos (US$97 million) for its failure to report the campaign funding diverted from Pemex. The fine was considered the largest in history, equal to the financing the PRI would have received from the fed in 2003 and half of 2004. Pemex and the Mexican government = Mexico's nationalization of the oil industry = President L√°zaro C√°rdenas nationalized the oil industry in Mexico in 1938 as a result of dispute between the labor union and the petroleum companies. Before then, the oil industry was dominated by foreign companies with foreign capital that resisted the formation of unions. When the Mexican Petroleum Workers Union's (STPRM) was finally formed in 1935, they demanded fair working conditions and increased wages, which was supported by President C√°rdenas' recommendation to bring the issue to the arbitration board. The union members issued a strike when their needs were not met, which caused a petroleum shortage in the country for a short period. The arbitration board eventually sided with the union, and the Supreme Court ordered that the companies should meet the workers' demands. However, the companies protested, and C√°rdenas offered a deal to end the strike if the companies paid 26 million pesos for the loss of wage incurred by the strike. When neither option passed, C√°rdenas decided to create the national oil company, Pemex. The expropriation was an acid test of the newly announced Good Neighbor Policy by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Despite concerns that this will sour relations between United States and Mexico, the two were more cordial than ever before and even ended up in the Latin American countries joining the United States on the allied side. Since then, the Mexican government has shared very close relationship with Pemex. The government even created a research arm for Pemex called the Mexican Petroleum Institute (IMP) to encourage national capabilities, consequently turning Pemex into an \\"elite super-agency\\". Pemex had essentially become the government's tool to promote Mexico's development through economic and social initiatives. Pemex is significantly affected by the Mexican constitution and other laws, which prevents it from pursuing domestic joint ventures or other equity related contracts that threaten Mexico‚Äôs patrimony. The restrictive nature of the company combined with its complicated relationship with the Mexican federal government leave its managers with few responsibilities. Yet, the political fragmentation in Mexico suggests that no single entity has strategic dominance over the company, especially after the 2000 elections. Its inability to exercise various economic strategies under a government that does not have a strong hold of the company has turned it into ‚Äúan instrument for the state‚Äôs financial engineering‚Äù. Thus, the Mexican government has been very dependent on Pemex financially, as the company‚Äôs short-term revenues are used to filling in federal budget holes. In total, Pemex‚Äôs financing of the Mexican government adds up to around 40% of Mexico‚Äôs federal budget. = 2000 presidential election = The 2000 Presidential Election in Mexico marked the end of PRI‚Äôs reign of power in the Mexican government. Until then, the PRI had ruled the Mexican government since Francisco Madero in 1910, and had built a national political system with the belief that they will always rule. The election was a politically significant moment in history due to the victory of Vincente Fox from the National Action Party (PAN) and since it marked the independence of the congress from the PRI. Fox's victory was unexpected due to the PRI's reign, but not entirely unprecedented. In the midst of efforts to make Mexico a truly democratic nation, citizens projected the need for change in the government through their votes. Analysis of the voting results show that 28% of voters chose the PRI for the candidate, but 50% for the party, whereas 52% chose the PAN for the candidate and 35% for the party. Comparing between candidates, an overwhelming 66% of voters who voted for Fox said that they cast their ballots for change in the nation, whereas Labastida received 15% and Cuauht√©moc C√°rdenas of the PRD received 18%. Supporters of PAN and many university graduates cast their ballots for Fox based on their belief that a true democracy should elect leaders, which Fox perfectly represented through the change he would bring to the nation in the democratic context. In order to promote their candidate Francisco Labastida, the PRI used its network throughout the nation. Most notably, the director or Pemex, Rogelio Montemayor Seguy, allegedly transferred $127 million to Labastida and other campaigns by the PRI. Despite the efforts, the election results gave Fox 42.5% of the votes, 36.1% for Labastida. Investigations = Fox's anticorruption efforts = Vicente Fox, as promised during his presidential campaign, made efforts to clarify past corruptions during his presidency. His first few years in office were high in public profile due to all the news related to allegations of corruption followed by his pledge to pursue it. The initial allegation began in January 2002, when the Office of the Comptroller General (SECODAM) reported illegal laundering of more than 120 million pesos (US$13 million) from PEMEX's operating funds through the Mexican Petroleum Workers Union's (STPRM) account to Francisco Labastida's presidential campaign in 2000. The high-ranking officials that were allegedly found guilty include Rogelio Montemayor, and labor leader Senator Carlos Romero Deschamps of the PRI party. The PGR conducted two different investigations. The first was on whether the funding for the campaign came from public funds and if the agreement between Pemex and the union are legitimate, and the second was on whether the electoral laws had been violated. Investigation by SECODAM revealed that a portion of the 1.6 million pesos (US$172 million) that had been illegitimately transferred from PEMEX to STPRM in 2000 was also sent to the Labastina campaign. In September 2002, the government issued arrest warrants against Montemayor, union treasurer and federal deputy Ricardo Aldana Prieto, and Romero Deschamps. It also requested that the two union leaders have their legislative immunity stripped by the Congress. Montemayor resisted extradition by fleeing to the United States for two years and returning to Mexico in September 2004. Despite Fox's pledge, the government began withdrawing its allegations over time. Money laundering charges against officials of STPRM were soon withdrawn, and in July 2003, the PGR special unit claimed that the illegal source of the funds were unidentified due to insufficient evidence. Three other individuals, including a government official and a PEMEX employee, were pardoned after being accused of mishandling half of the funds diverted to the campaign. Within the remaining members of PEMEX, the former director of PEMEX, Ra√∫l Mu√±oz Leos, was fined 862 million pesos (US$82,000) and restricted from maintaining public posts for the next ten years. Eventually, the IFE could only provide evidence that the PRI did not report 500 million pesos (US$53,000), which clearly surpassed the campaign's funding limits, and fined the PRI for 1 billion pesos (over US$53,000) in March 2003. Vicente Fox was often accused by PRI legislators for witch-hunting based on false accusations. Although many investigations occurred, the lack of prosecutions made people wonder if the government had made a deal with the PRI for leniency. One of the many rumors said that the deal was made to cover the Amigos de Fox case, which involves the president himself. = Results of the investigation = Executives from PEMEX who were declared innocent: Rogelio Montemayor (ex director of the administrative corporative), Carlos Juaristi Septien (ex director of the financial corporative), and Julio Pindter Gonzalez (subdirector of labor relations). From the union, three men were declared innocent of money laundering and organized delinquency, but they were accused of electoral fraud and illegal exercise of the public trust: Carlos Romero Deschamps (leader of the union), Ricardo Aldana (union member), Jesus Olvera Mendez (union member). From the PRI, four men were declared innocent from money laundering and organized delinquency, but they were accused of electoral fraud. It is important to mention that they were collaborators (directly involved in the campaign) of Francisco Labastida. They were: Carlos Aldama (ex secretary of elections), Jorge C√°rdenas Elizondo (ex secretary of financial department), Alonso Bret√≥n Figueroa (sub secretary of financial department), and Joel Hortiales Pacheco (ex technical secretary of financial department).  Media coverage  Despite the severity of the scandal, news stories about corruption was not at all prevalent during the scandal or after. It is interesting to see that a few stories deal with the punishment of corrupt government officials. In particular, Pemexgate had less than 40 articles related to corruption in the newspaper Milenio while other scandals reach until 200 scandals. The surprisingly small number of Pemexgate or Amigos de Fox related articles raises to suspicion. In 2000, El Universal published 927 articles related to Pemex's corruption. Many of El Universal's articles explicitly discuss the corruption related to the election. An article published on September 27, 2002, titled 'PRI, corresponsable del Pemexgate: Robles' openly discusses the PRD's report on diverted funds from Pemex to Labastida, and calls for further investigations. Rosario Robles Berlanga, the national leader of the PRD, says, \\"Este asunto no se queda solamente en los l√≠deres petroleros, ni tampoco en quienes estaban al frente de la paraestatal en ese momento, sino tambi√©n tiene que ir a fondo hacia la investigaci√≥n de la campa√±a presidencial del PRI\\" (\\"This issue is not only left to the Pemex officials, nor to those who were in charge of the state at that time, but also has to go deep into the investigation of the presidential campaign of the PRI\\"). Additionally, the article lists names of the individuals who were allegedly involved in Labastida's presidential campaign. El Universal published significantly fewer articles regarding the corruption in Labastida's campaign in 2000, the year of the elections. However, few of them openly discuss their lack of support for Labastida. In an article published on June 15, 2000, a Pemex official named Ramiro Berr√≥n Lara denied his support for Labastida in the upcoming elections, despite Labastida's pressure towards Pemex workers to vote for him.

He is a student in the Xavier Institute and a member of the former Hellions squad therein. After M-Day, he was one of only 28 students to retain his powers. He is best friends with Julian Keller (Hellion) and is extremely close to and protective of Cessily Kincaid (Mercury). Despite his earlier appearances as a stereotypical bully, he has evolved into a good- natured (though extremely boastful) and fiercely protective friend to most of the school's students. Publication history Rockslide first appeared in New Mutants vol. 2 #3 and was created by Nunzio DeFilippis and Christina Weir. Fictional character biography An Italian-American mutant from Boston, Santo was sent to the Xavier Institute where he befriended Julian and the would-be Hellions. He was originally advised by Iceman, but was selected by Emma Frost to be part of her prized Hellions squad. Vaccaro and the rest of the Hellions went on to win the field tournament and were declared the best squad at the end of the school year. Santo dreams of being a super-human wrestling star and enjoys murder-mystery television programs (such as Medium starring Patricia Arquette and Murder, She Wrote).New X-Men #28 He is also a fan of Dance Dance Revolution.New X-Men #21 During the summer vacation, Julian, from a well-to-do background, invited his friends to his home. The Hellions ran into trouble quickly, as his and Cessily's appearances disturbed people at the airport. After a brief struggle, the group was allowed to board, and made their way to California, where Julian originates. Soon, the team encountered the 'Kingmaker', from whom they each received a trial wish. Santo's wish was to become a World-class Champion in superhuman wrestling. However, when the Hellions eventually refused a permanent deal with the Kingmaker, the Kingmaker shattered Santo with a laser blast. Julian used his telekinesis to piece Rockslide back together, and together the Hellions defeated the Kingmaker.New X-Men: Hellions #1-6 (2005‚Äì2006) =Decimation= After the effects of M-Day, he was one of the few students who didn't lose their powers. The depowered students and staff were sent to their homes. One bus was bombed by anti-mutant religious zealot Reverend William Stryker, and Santo's former teammate and friend Brian (Tag) was among those killed. The X-Men held a funeral for those students whose parents would not accept them, and Santo reflected upon how he had \\"failed\\" by not being able to save those killed. With the mutant population drastically decreased, the government sent the Sentinel O*N*E* Squad to watch over the school, which began housing as many remaining mutants as would take refuge. All of the remaining students were placed by Emma Frost into an all-out brawl, and the ones deemed to be the best were to be assigned to become a group of in-training X-Men. Santo made the team and began training to become an X-Man. William Stryker continued his terror attacks against the school. Santo's teammate Josh (Elixir) ended Stryker's plans by killing him. The New X-Men, with the help of David (Prodigy), then made the connection between Stryker and Nimrod. The team leader, Nori (Surge), then decided that the team would find and destroy the robot. When the team confronted Nimrod, Rockslide revealed how much the death of his fellow schoolmates had affected him when he intercepted an attack by Nimrod meant for Hellion crying \\"Not again!\\" He was obliterated by the attack, fueling the rest of the team in their eventual defeat of Nimrod. Julian and Mercury tried desperately to awaken and to piece him back together, but Rockslide's remains were initially unresponsive. Thankfully, even in his shattered form, he was able to survive, and was finally put back together, only to become larger and more rugged than his previous form. Rockslide is later seen talking to Match and Anole about their abilities and how useful or useless they would be if they joined the New X-Men team, indicating Match and Anole may be possible candidates for admission onto the team. He was at the memorial service for all the students lost in Stryker's attack on the Institute. Rockslide sees the Young Avengers on television, learning about them for the first time, to his fellow students' surprise. He decides that the New X-Men should beat them up, with himself fighting Hulkling. Fellow students Loa and Anole tell him that Hulkling would win. Rockslide accompanied the X-Men when they jumped from the Blackbird to save Cessily from the Facility. He helped with great enthusiasm during the fight, and in the aftermath, made fun of Shadowcat and her powers, saying that being an X-Man must be \\"really hard\\". Kitty then jokingly threatened to kill him. =Quest for Magik= Santo and the other students were captured by Belasco, and taken to Limbo. While hiding from Belasco, along with Blindfold, Match, Loa, Anole, Wolf Cub, Pixie, and Gentle, Santo was unsure what to do. As demons approached the group, Santo fought them off, but then seemingly exploded when he tried to shoot his fists at them. Santo then seems to reconstitute himself in a magma rock form that is also impervious to magic and beats the badness out of Illyana who then helps them to rescue their fellow students and kill Belasco. Back home, Rockslide threatens to quit if Pixie and Anole aren't made part of the New X-Men.New X-Men #41 (October 2007) =World War Hulk= Rockslide is one of the students that goes up against the Hulk when he attacks the Institute. He knocks over the Hulk so the other students can hold him down, but is knocked away when Hulk regains his strength. When Rockslide attacks him alone, it appears that Hulk knows who he is and what he can do. The Hulk rips off both of Rockslide's arms, steps on him, then tears off his legs. He then rids Rockslide of his limbs by throwing them a great distance, ridding Rockslide of his powers and the ability of ambulatory function. His limbs were eventually located after Hulk leaves. Santo has stated that as a kid he pretended he was the Hulk. =Children of X-Men= Rockslide is seen playing pool with X-23 and Anole; he and X-23 try to convince Anole to let them cut his other arm off. After Santo calls Anole a sissy, Anole gets offended and pushes him out the window while Rockslide proclaims \\"I swear I didn't know! Don't be so sensitive!\\" After Rockslide refuses to blow himself up, Anole calls him a sissy to get him to do it. Anole then offers to try and blow up Santo himself. Beast and Colossus supervise Santo's brief training on exploding and regenerating. Santo later agrees to stay up with Indra because he is worried that he is going to die and while having an indoor campfire, Santo points out that it doesn't matter how old they are, they are mutants and someone is going to come gunning for them, and when they do he wants to go down fighting. Later, he outs Anole as gay to some of the other students, though Loa was already aware and says that everyone already knew of his orientation. =Messiah Complex= Some of the New-X-Men decide to launch a pre-emptive strike against the Purifiers. After spying on the Purifiers, they are ambushed by the Reavers; Rockslide and X-23 manage to damage Lady Deathstrike‚Äôs armor. Pixie then manages to teleport the team out and are spread between Washington and the Institute. He was later seen aboard the X-Jet with Iceman and the New-X-Men during the Sentinel attack on the mansion. Later, he is seen talking with Dust about honoring the dead. They are joined by Mercury and as they approach the cemetery they find Predator X feasting on the bodies of dead mutants much to their horror. He holds the creature back so the others can escape, knowing that he can't be killed by it, though it does make short work of him. =Young X-Men= Santo meets up with Blindfold at a coffee shop and she tells him about her premonition of soon-to-be-formed Young X-Men squad, including the death of one of their future teammates, though he appears to take no heed. Just as predicted, Cyclops offers Santo the position, but claims that he was not planning on recruiting Blindfold. Santo demands that she be added to the team, stating that Blindfold's premonition included both him and her, and threatened to reject Cyclops' offer if she was not recruited as well.Young X-Men #1 It is later revealed that Cyclops is really Donald Pierce in disguise manipulating the Young X-Men to attack the original New Mutants, as Blindfold predicted, Wolf Cub is killed in the final confrontation with Pierce, which impacts Santo greatly.Young X-Men #5 =X-Infernus= Santo and Mercury are watching a training session between Pixie and Nightcrawler when Pixie stabs Kurt with her soul dagger. They run in and move Pixie away from Kurt's unconscious body, Beast enters and Pixie regains her senses. When she removes her dagger, Magik's soulsword emerges from his chest and Magik teleports in ready to reclaim her sword.X-Infernus #1 Rockslide takes on Illyana, thinking he is still resistant to magic, forgetting that it was only when he was composed of Limbo's terrain. Illyana shocks him by easily defeating him. After he reforms, the gathered X-Men hold a meeting and he along with Mercury are put on a team of X-Men being sent to Limbo due to their resistance to magic, but only if he reforms from Limbo rock.X-Infernus #2 In Limbo, Rockslide reforms out of Limbo's terrain as the team enters Belasco's castle to assist Pixie. Finding Illyana defeated by Witchfire and Pixie transformed into a demon, Rockslide and Mercury are forced to fight Colossus and Wolverine who become magically mind-controlled.X-Infernus #3 =Utopia= Rockslide moves with the X-Men when they are forced out of U.S. soil by Norman Osborn. Still a student, Rockslide dreams of becoming a full-fledged X-member and goes on vigilante missions with Anole in the cover of darkness. He is on Utopia during the attacks of Selene's Transmutant slaves as well as Bastion's Nimrod Sentinels from the future. When Wolverine decides to re-open the school in order to give the kids a life without violence, Santo agrees to go back to the school. Under new guides such as Chamber, Santo has settled down as a kid for the first time since House of M. =Wolverine's School= When Wolverine reopens the school, Santo is sent back to Westchester to study alongside his friends. His best friend is Anole and he has almost lost all contact with his former best friend Hellion, although they all reside in the school. In the pages of \\"House of X and Powers of X,\\" Rockslide became a resident of Krakoa when it was established as a mutant paradise.House of X #6. Marvel Comics. During the \\"Empyre\\" storyline, Rockslide, Loa, and Anole go to Arrako Point on Krakoa and meet with the High Summoner of Arrako where he teaches them the game of weakness which gets interrupted when a Cotati fleet approaches Krakoa.X-Men Vol. 5 #11. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities In his initial appearance, Santo's body was composed completely of granite; with a look very similar to that of the Thing. This granted him superhuman strength, endurance, durability and the ability to fire his hands as projectiles. In the Hellions mini-series, he was shattered by the Kingmaker and put back together by Julian, much like how a disembodied Emma Frost was reanimated by Jean Grey in the first New X-Men series. Santo's body was later obliterated by Nimrod. Again with Julian's assistance, he was eventually able to put himself back together. This time his appearance is larger and more rugged. Rockslide in his Limbo rock form. In the Quest for Magik arc, Santo attempts to fire his fists off in Limbo but Blindfold reveals that aspect of his powers doesn't work anymore. Although he is blown up again, Santo returns as a large lava type \\"golem\\". His molten rock form, being from Limbo, is also resistant to magic. This is shown when Darkchild tried to stop him from attacking her and when Belasco tries to zap him with magical energy, but they both have no effect. Beast's suspicion is that after Nimrod shattered Santo, Nimrod must have atomized most of his original body and dissolved him in some sort of disembodied psychic state. Santo, in theory, is able to re- form himself as a \\"golem\\" from some kind of ambient earth matter and obtain that earth matter's properties. The first time his body was destroyed, he was able to reform from solid rocks and obtained a larger and rugged rock body. The second time, he reformed from Limbo's molten rocks and obtained the ability to generate and maintain heat from within, and also some magic resistance. The third time, he reformed from the school's grounds after exploding himself. Santo's original ability to fire off his limbs is seemingly lost in his new reformed bodies. Instead, the energy used to propel his limbs is now explosively released from his entire body, obliterating his form, from which he can recover.New X-Men #42 During Kuurth, Breaker of Stone's attack on Utopia, Gambit unlocked Rockslide's potential energy to create a \\"living bomb\\", making \\"one of the largest mutant-generated force blasts recorded\\".Uncanny X-Men #542 =Personality= Santo is typically depicted as superficially brash, oblivious, and inconsiderate. Originally, he was introduced as a stereotypical bully. However, he cares deeply for his friends, recalling the deaths of the depowered students, especially Tag, which usually motivates him to perform feats of incredible strength or bravery. He also has a strong sensitivity for his teammates, such as when Dust continued to \\"beat herself up\\" over the death of Icarus as well as recognizing that he is not supposed to see her without her abaya. He is very protective of his teammate Mercury. Santo also has a strong sense of honor, telling Anole and Pixie that he would quit the team if they were not included on the roster. Other versions =House of M= In this reality, Santo was once again a champion superhuman wrestler. In other media =Television= Rockslide made a cameo appearance in the Wolverine and the X-Men animated series. In the episode \\"Hindsight\\" Pt. 1, he was among the mutants that were captured by the Mutant Response Division. =Film= Rockslide appears in the early concept art of the 2014 film X-Men: Days of Future Past. His powers can be seen manifested by a future Sentinel in the final assault against the surviving mutants and remaining X-Men, thus is presumably deceased as the future Sentinels use mutant powers to kill mutants with their own individual abilities.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt established it in January 1942, with Executive Order 9024.Executive Order 9024 - Establishing the War Production Board (January 16, 1942) The WPB replaced the Supply Priorities and Allocation Board and the Office of Production Management. The WPB directed conversion of industries from peacetime work to war needs, allocated scarce materials, established priorities in the distribution of materials and services, and prohibited nonessential production. It rationed such commodities as gasoline, heating oil, metals, rubber, paper and plastics. It was dissolved shortly after the defeat of Japan in 1945, and was replaced by the Civilian Production Administration in late 1945. In 1942-45, WPB supervised the production of $183 billion worth of weapons and supplies, about 40% of the world output of munitions. Britain, the USSR and other allies produced an additional 30%, while the Axis produced only 30%. One fourth of the US output was warplanes; one fourth was warships. Meanwhile, the civilian standard of living was about level. Organization The first chairman of the Board was Donald M. Nelson, who served from 1942 to 1944. He was succeeded by Julius A. Krug, who served from 1944 until the Board was dissolved. The national WPB constituted the chair, the Secretaries of War, Navy, and Agriculture, the lieutenant general in charge of War Department procurement, the director of the Office of Price Administration, the Federal Loan Administrator, the chair of the Board of Economic Warfare, and the special assistant to the President for the defense aid program. The WPB had advisory, policy-making, and progress-reporting divisions. The WPB managed twelve regional offices, and operated one hundred twenty field offices throughout the nation. They worked alongside state war production boards, which maintained records on state war production facilities and also helped state businesses obtain war contracts and loans. left The national WPB's primary task was converting civilian industry to war production. The WPB assigned priorities and allocated scarce materials such as steel, aluminum, and rubber, prohibited nonessential industrial production such as nylons and refrigerators, controlled wages and prices, and mobilized the people through patriotic propaganda such as \\"give your scrap metal and help Oklahoma boys save our way of life.\\"War Production Board It initiated events such as scrap metal drives, which were carried out locally to great success. For example, a national scrap metal drive in October 1942 resulted in an average of almost eighty-two pounds of scrap per American. WPB order M-9-C related to the conservation of copper, and in May 1942 The Film Daily reported that this would apply to the production of new motion picture sound and projection equipment, but not to the delivery of items already produced. Effects The WPB and the nation's factories effected a great turnaround. Military aircraft production, which totaled 6,000 in 1940, jumped to 85,000 in 1943. Factories that made silk ribbons now produced parachutes, automobile factories built tanks, typewriter companies converted to rifles, undergarment manufacturers sewed mosquito netting, and a roller coaster manufacturer converted to the production of bomber repair platforms. The WPB ensured that each factory received the materials it needed to produce the most war goods in the shortest time. From 1942 to 1945 the WPB directed a total production of $185 billion worth of armaments and supplies. At war's end, most production restrictions were quickly lifted, and the WPB was abolished on November 3, 1945, with its remaining functions transferred to the Civilian Production Administration.

This originated in the American Football League in the 1960s, one of whose earliest experts was Willie Brown of the Oakland Raiders. Mel Blount of the Pittsburgh Steelers specialized in this coverage to such a point as to cause numerous rule changes (see below) strictly limiting when and where a defender may make contact with a potential receiver in order to make it easier for receivers to run their routes and increase scoring. In contrast, under NCAA rules, contact is allowed anywhere on the field as long as contact is in front of the defender and a pass is not in the air.  Technique  This play works well against routes that require the receiver to be in a certain spot at a certain time. The disadvantage, however, is that the receiver can shed contact and get behind the cornerback for a big play. This varies from the more traditional defensive formation in which a defensive player will give the receiver a \\"cushion\\" of about 5 yards to prevent the receiver from getting behind him. In the NFL, a defensive back is allowed any sort of contact within the 5 yard bump zone except for holding the receiver, otherwise the defensive back can be called for an illegal contact penalty, costing 5 yards and an automatic first down, enforced since 1978, and known colloquially as the Mel Blount Rule.

He has been a member of the student body at the Xavier Institute, a member of the Hellions training squad, and a supervillain as a part of Selene's Coven. Fictional character biography Kevin Kevin Ford panics when his powers first manifest. His father tries to calm him down and Kevin's power reduces him to dust. A talented artist, Kevin lives in a scrap yard for a while and turned unwanted scrap into beautiful art. He is found by Danielle Moonstar and brought to the Xavier Institute,New Mutants vol. 2 #3 (September 2003) where he begins to develop friendships with Laurie Collins, David Alleyne, and Sofia Mantega.New Mutants vol. 2 #5 (November 2003) When Donald Pierce attacks them and impales Laurie, Kevin lashes out and uses his power on Pierce. To stop him from killing Pierce, Moonstar shows him his worst fear - using his power on an innocent person. Frightened by the physiological pleasure he experienced when using his power on Pierce, he leaves the Institute.New Mutants, vol. 2 #6 (December 2003) Some months later Emma Frost persuades him to return, and he joins the New Mutants squad under the codename Wither. Clashing with Elixir, the current object of Laurie's affections, Mercury of the Hellions reaches out to him, having developed a crush on him.New X-Men - Academy X #3-4 He is arrested by the FBI for killing his father. While the Hellions try to rescue him, the New Mutants stop them, fearing the consequences of involving the Institute in a fight with the FBI. Kevin sees this as a betrayal, and he switches to the Hellions squad.New X-Men - Academy X #5-6 He discovers Elixir's former relationship with Wolfsbane and reveals it to the school, successfully ending Josh's relationship with Laurie.New X-Men - Academy X #12 Kevin spends some time vacationing with the Hellion squad. They get caught up with the powerful 'Kingmaker' who grants people their wishes in return for favors later. Kevin spends some time without his powers due to drugs supplied by their new ally. However, once the Hellions discover the favor is stealing a biological weapon, they rebel. Kevin loses access to the drugs. He uses his powers to destroy the weapon.New X-Men: Hellions #1‚Äì6 (2005‚Äì2006) After M-Day, Kevin believes he has lost his powers like most of the mutant population. When he touches Laurie's hand, however, it withers. After a session in David Alleyne's Danger Cave, Kevin overhears Julian Keller referring to him as \\"dangerous.\\" Kevin again runs away from the institute, unaware that Julian also wanted to help him..New X-Menvol.2 # 22 Kevin goes to Mutant Town, and lives in the company of Selene, in disguise as an old lady. After seeing Selene shot by the police, he kills two policemen in a rage. Wither and Selene embrace as Kevin accepts Selene's offer to be her \\"king\\" as they fade away, presumably to Selene's dimension.New X-Menvol.2 # 32 Wither lives a life of luxury with Selene but he still has feelings for Laurie and because of this is still reluctant to use his powers. Using illusions of Elixir and Laurie, Selene is able to get him to renounce these inhibitions.X-Necrosha: The Gathering #1 Wither is among Selene's Inner Circle, dispatched to retrieve Selene's mystical knife from the X-Men. During the resulting fight, he is distracted by Dust, her transient form proving difficult for him to affect. However, when Onyxx attacks, Wither uses his powers to disintegrate his rocky form, killing him instantly. During a quarrel with Eli Bard, Wither transforms, revealing that Selene has used her powers to make him an immortal vampire, much like Bard. Bard is killed immediately after their argument by Selene herself. Elixir and Wither face against one another. Wither accuses Elixir of failing to save Wallflower. This causes him to switch from his Gold Healing form to his Black Death form, which overwhelms Wither's destructive power. Elixir reluctantly kills him, completely disintegrating his body.X-Force vol. 3 #25 Years later, Wither resurfaced in the newly-founded mutant nation of Krakoa, having been presumably reborn by the hand of The Five, a group of mutants capable of combining their powers into a process of resurrection, brought together by Charles Xavier as part of his plans for mutant ascension. He was seen talking to Bevatron with his old Hellions Squad, living on the Akademos Habitat..New Mutants vol. 4 #1 Powers and abilities Kevin, \\"killing\\" Laurie. Wither decays, and eventually disintegrates, organic matter by touch--a power which is involuntary. With extended contact he would reduce almost anything--or anyone--organic to dust. As a result of his power he is only able to wear clothing made of synthetic textiles. This power is even more difficult to deal with due to Kevin's self-styled interpretation that his ability wants him to use it. It has a \\"hunger\\", which gives Kevin a desire to use it, though this could just be a psychological aspect of his power. He is also sometimes shown to see things in their decayed form, such as live pigeons appearing to be decayed through his eyes. He had the ability to put out fire with his bare hands in a few issues. During the Necrosha crossover Wither was somehow able to disintegrate and kill Onyxx, despite his granite skin.X-Force, vol. 3 #23 During a later confrontation with Eli Bard, Wither shows also that he now can turn himself to a vampire-like being, due to Selene's manipulation.X-Force, vol. 3 #24 Other versions =House of M= Wither works alongside Elixir as an interrogator for S.H.I.E.L.D. Wither uses his power to decay a part of his victim nearly to death, at which point Elixir steps in and uses his power to heal the victim. The process is apparently extremely painful. Wither also wears a containment suit, although Elixir comments that he doesn't need it and only wears it for psychological effect. =X-Men: The End= Wither saves Joanna Cargill from a Warskrull posing as Genesis. After he kills the Warskrull he hopes Dani can forgive him for using his powers to kill. He is killed in the explosion of the X-Men's mansion.

A fourth person, Mark Haydon, was convicted for helping to dispose of the bodies. The trial was one of the longest and most publicised in Australian legal history. Most of the bodies were found in barrels in an abandoned bank vault in Snowtown, hence the names given in the press for the murders. Only one of the victims was killed in Snowtown itself, which is approximately north of Adelaide, and neither the twelve victims nor the three perpetrators were from the town. Although motivation for the murders is unclear, the killers were led by Bunting to believe that the victims were paedophiles, homosexuals, or \\"weak\\". In the case of some victims, the murders were preceded by torture, and efforts were made to appropriate victims' identities, social security payments and bank accounts. Although initially the notoriety of the murders led to a short-term economic boost from tourists visiting Snowtown, it created a stigma, with authorities considering a change of the town's name and identity. Investigation Initially, the body of Clinton Trezise was found at Lower Light in 1994, although no connection to Bunting was made at this time. Similarly, the death of Thomas Trevilyan in 1997 was initially treated as a suicide. It was police inquiries into Elizabeth Haydon's disappearance which eventually led them to Snowtown, and on 20 May 1999, the remains of eight victims were found by the South Australian Police in six plastic barrels in a disused bank vault. For this reason, the murders were dubbed the \\"bodies in barrels murders\\". It is believed that the bodies had been held in several locations in South Australia before being moved to Snowtown in 1999. Prosecutors believe that the killers moved the bodies after they became aware of the ongoing police investigation. Two more bodies were found buried in the backyard of Bunting's house in Adelaide. Police later arrested and charged Bunting, Wagner, Vlassakis and Mark Haydon on 21 May 1999 for the murders. At the time of the arrest, Vlassakis lived in Bunting's home. Trials and verdicts The trial of Bunting and Wagner lasted almost twelve months, the longest in the history of South Australia. In December 2003, Bunting was convicted of committing eleven murders, and Wagner of ten murders, of which he had confessed to only three. Vlassakis pleaded guilty to four of the murders. In 2004, Haydon was convicted on five counts of assisting with the murders (of which he admitted to two). The jury did not come to a decision on two murder charges against Haydon, and another charge of assisting murder, at which the senior prosecutor, Wendy Abraham, indicated that she would seek a retrial on those charges. The final count against Bunting and Wagner‚Äîthat of murdering Suzanne Allen‚Äîwas dropped on 7 May 2007, when a jury had been unable to reach a verdict. Justice Brian Ross Martin determined that Bunting was the ringleader, and sentenced him to 11 consecutive terms of life imprisonment without the possibility of release on parole. Wagner was sentenced to 10 consecutive terms under the same conditions, and at his sentencing, he stated from the dock: \\"Paedophiles were doing terrible things to children. The authorities didn't do anything about it. I decided to take action. I took that action. Thank you.\\" Vlassakis was sentenced to four consecutive life sentences with a non-parole period of 26 years and Haydon was sentenced to 25 years with no possibility of parole for 18 years. More than 250 suppression orders prevented publication of the details of this case. In early 2011, a judge lifted the remaining orders in response to a request by the producers of the film Snowtown, a dramatisation depicting the murders and the events leading up to them.

John Justin Bunting (born 4 September 1966 in Inala, Queensland) was found to be the leader of the perpetrators. When he was 8 years old, Bunting was beaten and sexually assaulted by a friend's older brother. He is reported to have \\"enjoyed weaponry, photography and anatomy,\\" and grew to develop a strong hatred of paedophiles and homosexuals. At age 22, Bunting worked at an abattoir and reportedly \\"bragged about slaughtering the animals, saying that's what he enjoyed the most\\". Bunting moved to a house in Salisbury North, South Australia in 1991 and befriended his neighbours Mark Haydon and Robert Wagner. Wagner's romantic partner, Vanessa Lane, a.k.a. Barry Lane, was a male cross- dresser with a history of paedophilia. Robert Joe Wagner (born 28 November 1971 in Parramatta, New South Wales) was befriended by Bunting in 1991. Bunting encouraged Wagner to assist in the various murders. James \\"Jamie\\" Spyridon Vlassakis (born 24 December 1979), along with his mother and half- brother, lived with Bunting and was gradually drawn into helping with the murders. Vlassakis, 23, helped torture and kill his own half-brother, Troy Youde, and his stepbrother, David Johnson. He confessed in 2001 to four murders, including Johnson's, and became a key witness for the Crown. The detail he provided, supported by other evidence, helped convict Bunting and Wagner. Vlassakis was sentenced in 2002 to a minimum of 26 years and is held in isolation in an unidentified South Australia prison. Mark Ray Haydon (born 4 December 1958), an associate of Bunting, was initially the subject of \\"suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication\\" and could not therefore be identified as anything other than an alleged perpetrator. In January 1999, he reportedly rented the abandoned state bank building at Snowtown. A jury deadlocked on the murders of Haydon's wife, Elizabeth Haydon, and of Troy Youde. The murder charges were not retried when Haydon pleaded guilty to helping the serial killers dispose of the bodies of Elizabeth and Youde. Community impact The notoriety of the murders led to a short-term economic boost from tourists visiting Snowtown, but created a lasting stigma.Snowtown: Living with a death penalty The Age 7 May 2011 The Age reported in 2011 that Snowtown would be \\"forever stigmatised\\" due to its association with the murders. Shortly after the discovery of the bodies in Snowtown, the community discussed changing the name to \\"Rosetown\\", but no further actions were taken. , one shop in Snowtown was selling souvenirs of the murders \\"cashing in on Snowtown's unfortunate notoriety\\". The house in Salisbury North where Bunting lived and buried two bodies was demolished by its owner, the South Australian Housing Trust. The bank, with a four-bedroom attached house, was placed on auction in February 2012 but only reached half its reserve price of $200,000. After holding an open house which raised $700 for charity through charging an entrance fee, the property sold later that year on 27 September for just over $185,000 with the new owners intending to live in the house while running a business from the bank. A plaque will be installed to commemorate the victims.

Strands of Elementary Mathematics =Number Sense & Numeration = Number Sense is an understanding of numbers and operations. In the number sense and numeration strand students develop an understanding of numbers by being taught various ways of representing numbers, as well as the relationships among numbers. Properties of the natural numbers such as divisibility and the distribution of prime numbers, are studied in basic number theory, another part of elementary mathematics. Elementary Focus *Fractions and Decimals *Place Value *Addition and subtraction *Multiplication and Division *Counting Money *Counting *Representing and ordering numbers *Estimating *Problem Solving To have a strong foundation in mathematics and to be able to succeed in the other strands students need to have a fundamental understanding of number sense and numeration. =Measurement = Measurement skills and concepts are directly related to the world in which students live. Many of the concepts that students are taught in this strand are also used in other subjects such as science, social studies, and physical education In the measurement strand students learn about the measurable attributes of objects, in addition to the basic metric system. Elementary Focus * Standard and non- standard units of measurement * telling time using 12 hour clock and 24 hour clock * comparing objects using measurable attributes * measuring height, length, width * centimetres and metres * mass and capacity * temperature change * days, months, weeks, years * distances using kilometres * measuring kilograms and litres * determining area and perimeter * determining grams and millilitre * determining measurements using shapes such as triangular prism The measurement strand consists of multiple forms of measurement as Marian Small states \\" Measurement is the process of assigning a qualitative or quantitative description of size to an object based on a particular attribute.\\" =Equations and formulas= A formula is an entity constructed using the symbols and formation rules of a given logical language. For example, determining the volume of a sphere requires a significant amount of integral calculus or its geometrical analogue, the method of exhaustion; but, having done this once in terms of some parameter (the radius for example), mathematicians have produced a formula to describe the volume: This particular formula is: : An equation is a formula of the form A = B, where A and B are expressions that may contain one or several variables called unknowns, and \\"=\\" denotes the equality binary relation. Although written in the form of proposition, an equation is not a statement that is either true or false, but a problem consisting of finding the values, called solutions, that, when substituted for the unknowns, yield equal values of the expressions A and B. For example, 2 is the unique solution of the equation x + 2 = 4, in which the unknown is x. =Data representation and analysis= An example histogram of the heights of 31 Black Cherry trees. Histograms are a common tool used to represent data. Data is a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables; restated, pieces of data are individual pieces of information. Data in computing (or data processing) is represented in a structure that is often tabular (represented by rows and columns), a tree (a set of nodes with parent- children relationship), or a graph (a set of connected nodes). Data is typically the result of measurements and can be visualized using graphs or images. Data as an abstract concept can be viewed as the lowest level of abstraction, from which information and then knowledge are derived. =Basic two-dimensional geometry= Two-dimensional geometry is a branch of mathematics concerned with questions of shape, size, and relative position of two-dimensional figures. Basic topics in elementary mathematics include polygons, circles, perimeter and area. A polygon that is bounded by a finite chain of straight line segments closing in a loop to form a closed chain or circuit. These segments are called its edges or sides, and the points where two edges meet are the polygon's vertices (singular: vertex) or corners. The interior of the polygon is sometimes called its body. An n-gon is a polygon with n sides. A polygon is a 2-dimensional example of the more general polytope in any number of dimensions. A circle is a simple shape of two- dimensional geometry that is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the center.The distance between any of the points and the center is called the radius. It can also be defined as the locus of a point equidistant from a fixed point. A perimeter is a path that surrounds a two-dimensional shape. The term may be used either for the path or its length - it can be thought of as the length of the outline of a shape. The perimeter of a circle or ellipse is called its circumference. Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape. There are several well-known formulas for the areas of simple shapes such as triangles, rectangles, and circles. =Proportions= Two quantities are proportional if a change in one is always accompanied by a change in the other, and if the changes are always related by use of a constant multiplier. The constant is called the coefficient of proportionality or proportionality constant. *If one quantity is always the product of the other and a constant, the two are said to be directly proportional. are directly proportional if the ratio \\\\tfrac yx is constant. *If the product of the two quantities is always equal to a constant, the two are said to be inversely proportional. are inversely proportional if the product xy is constant. =Analytic geometry= Cartesian coordinates Analytic geometry is the study of geometry using a coordinate system. This contrasts with synthetic geometry. Usually the Cartesian coordinate system is applied to manipulate equations for planes, straight lines, and squares, often in two and sometimes in three dimensions. Geometrically, one studies the Euclidean plane (2 dimensions) and Euclidean space (3 dimensions). As taught in school books, analytic geometry can be explained more simply: it is concerned with defining and representing geometrical shapes in a numerical way and extracting numerical information from shapes' numerical definitions and representations. Transformations are ways of shifting and scaling functions using different algebraic formulas. =Negative numbers= A negative number is a real number that is less than zero. Such numbers are often used to represent the amount of a loss or absence. For example, a debt that is owed may be thought of as a negative asset, or a decrease in some quantity may be thought of as a negative increase. Negative numbers are used to describe values on a scale that goes below zero, such as the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales for temperature. =Exponents and radicals= Exponentiation is a mathematical operation, written as bn, involving two numbers, the base b and the exponent (or power) n. When n is a natural number (i.e., a positive integer), exponentiation corresponds to repeated multiplication of the base: that is, bn is the product of multiplying n bases: :b^n = \\\\underbrace{b \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times b}_n Roots are the opposite of exponents. The nth root of a number x (written \\\\sqrt[n]{x}) is a number r which when raised to the power n yields x. That is, :\\\\sqrt[n]{x} = r \\\\iff r^n = x, where n is the degree of the root. A root of degree 2 is called a square root and a root of degree 3, a cube root. Roots of higher degree are referred to by using ordinal numbers, as in fourth root, twentieth root, etc. For example: * 2 is a square root of 4, since 22 = 4. * ‚àí2 is also a square root of 4, since (‚àí2)2 = 4. =Compass-and-straightedge= Compass-and-straightedge, also known as ruler-and-compass construction, is the construction of lengths, angles, and other geometric figures using only an idealized ruler and compass. The idealized ruler, known as a straightedge, is assumed to be infinite in length, and has no markings on it and only one edge. The compass is assumed to collapse when lifted from the page, so may not be directly used to transfer distances. (This is an unimportant restriction since, using a multi-step procedure, a distance can be transferred even with collapsing compass, see compass equivalence theorem.) More formally, the only permissible constructions are those granted by Euclid's first three postulates. =Congruence and similarity= Two figures or objects are congruent if they have the same shape and size, or if one has the same shape and size as the mirror image of the other. More formally, two sets of points are called congruent if, and only if, one can be transformed into the other by an isometry, i.e., a combination of rigid motions, namely a translation, a rotation, and a reflection. This means that either object can be repositioned and reflected (but not resized) so as to coincide precisely with the other object. So two distinct plane figures on a piece of paper are congruent if we can cut them out and then match them up completely. Turning the paper over is permitted. Two geometrical objects are called similar if they both have the same shape, or one has the same shape as the mirror image of the other. More precisely, one can be obtained from the other by uniformly scaling (enlarging or shrinking), possibly with additional translation, rotation and reflection. This means that either object can be rescaled, repositioned, and reflected, so as to coincide precisely with the other object. If two objects are similar, each is congruent to the result of a uniform scaling of the other. =Three- dimensional geometry= Solid geometry was the traditional name for the geometry of three-dimensional Euclidean space. Stereometry deals with the measurements of volumes of various solid figures (three-dimensional figures) including pyramids, cylinders, cones, truncated cones, spheres, and prisms. =Rational numbers= Rational number is any number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction p/q of two integers, with the denominator q not equal to zero. Since q may be equal to 1, every integer is a rational number. The set of all rational numbers is usually denoted by a boldface Q (or blackboard bold \\\\mathbb{Q}). =Patterns, relations and functions= A pattern is a discernible regularity in the world or in a manmade design. As such, the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner. A geometric pattern is a kind of pattern formed of geometric shapes and typically repeating like a wallpaper. A relation on a set A is a collection of ordered pairs of elements of A. In other words, it is a subset of the Cartesian product A2 = . Common relations include divisibility between two numbers and inequalities. A functionThe words map or mapping, transformation, correspondence, and operator are often used synonymously. . is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs with the property that each input is related to exactly one output. An example is the function that relates each real number x to its square x2. The output of a function f corresponding to an input x is denoted by f(x) (read \\"f of x\\"). In this example, if the input is ‚àí3, then the output is 9, and we may write f(‚àí3) = 9. The input variable(s) are sometimes referred to as the argument(s) of the function. =Slopes and trigonometry= The slope of a line is a number that describes both the direction and the steepness of the line. Slope is often denoted by the letter m. Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that studies relationships involving lengths and angles of triangles. The field emerged during the 3rd century BC from applications of geometry to astronomical studies.R. Nagel (ed.), Encyclopedia of Science, 2nd Ed., The Gale Group (2002) United States In the United States, there has been considerable concern about the low level of elementary mathematics skills on the part of many students, as compared to students in other developed countries.Liping Ma, Knowing and Teaching Elementary Mathematics: Teachers' Understanding of Fundamental Mathematics in China and the United States (Studies in Mathematical Thinking and Learning.), Lawrence Erlbaum, 1999, . The No Child Left Behind program was one attempt to address this deficiency, requiring that all American students be tested in elementary mathematics.Frederick M. Hess and Michael J.

Canales was born in Kingsville, Texas.http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004704/Laura-Canales.html Early years Laura Canales was raised in Kingsville, Texas, a small ranching town located fifty miles southwest of Corpus Christi, Texas. She attended Henrietta M. King High School in Kingsville, where she was well known for her remarkable vocals.http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004704/Laura-Canales.html After graduation, her father, Perfecto, encouraged her to continue her pursuit of a tejano music career. She made her recording debut in 1973 with Los Unicos while simultaneously singing with renowned Texas conjunto and norte√±o group Conjunto Bernal. In the mid-1970s, Canales was a founding member of tejano band Snowball & Company, which also went by the name, Felicidad. The band released several full-length albums and singles under both group names on San Antonio label, Fireball Records, including a cover of the song Midnight Blue, the first regional hit of Canales' career. Snowball choose the recording engineer & producer Paul Westbrook since he was recording and producing most of the hits in the Tejano music scene in those early days. Members included Laura Canales (lead vocals), Oscar Soliz (keyboards, accordion, bass, harmonica), Miro Valdez (guitar, vocals), Juan Rodriguez (bass, vocals, accordion), and Balde Mu√±oz (drums, percussion). The band was managed by Oscar Mu√±oz. Success In 1981, Canales married drummer Balde Mu√±oz and formed the group Laura Canales & Encanto. After signing with Freddie Records, the group enjoyed enormous success. The group's single, S√≠ Viv√≠ Contigo, was their first major hit. In 1983, Texas Governor Mark White honored her with the Yellow Rose of Texas Award, the state's highest honor for artists. From 1983 to 1986, Canales won both best female entertainer and female vocalist honors at the Tejano Music Awards, a record that stood until Selena broke it in the 1990s.http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004704/Laura-Canales.html In 1987, Canales did a cover of Jos√© Jos√©'s Te Quiero Asi with Mazz's Joe Lopez which appeared on the band's album Beyond. In 1989, Canales and Balde Mu√±oz divorced. Canales subsequently quit Encanto and went into semi- retirement. She did manage a comeback during a surge in international popularity of Tejano music during the early 1990s and made appearances with the tejano band, Los Fabulosos Cuatro. As a solo artist, this comeback yielded several well-known hits, including Cuatro Caminos, Dame La Mano, and Dile a Tu Esposa. Later years Eventually, Laura Canales began preparing for life beyond Tejano music. Remembering a promise to her mother, she enrolled in classes at Texas A&M; University- Kingsville.http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3443700020.html Canales graduated with Bachelor's degrees in Psychology and Speech Therapy in 1997. Shortly thereafter, Canales began taking graduate classes at Texas A&M; University-Kingsville, working toward a Master's degree in Communication Science Disorders.http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004704/Laura- Canales.html During her breaks from university coursework, Canales began yet another comeback by participating with the Leyendas y Raices Tour which included fellow Tejano performers Carlos Guzman, Augustin Ramirez, Sunny Ozuna, Freddie Martinez, Mario Montes, and Grupo Sierra. In 2000, Canales became part of the first class of inductees to the Tejano Roots Hall of Fame.http://www.tejanorootshalloffame.org/inductees00.html Illness and death It was while attending graduate school that Laura Canales first began experiencing problems with her gall bladder.

It established him as a major fantasy novelist and created the character of Druss, who would appear in several subsequent books. It was the first novel by Gemmell, and in The Drenai saga. Gemmell got the idea for the book in 1976. He was being tested for cancer, and to take his mind off it he tried writing a book, which he called \\"Against the Hordes\\". The fortress and its attackers, the Nadir, were metaphors for him and the cancer. In the end, he was found not to have cancer after all and he forgot about the book, which he claims wasn't very good anyway. However, in 1980, a friend of Gemmell's read the manuscript and told him that the story had potential. Encouraged, Gemmell set to work rewriting the book that would become known as \\"Legend\\". It was accepted by Century Hutchinson late in 1982. In 1984 Century Communications produced a game for the ZX Spectrum computer based on the novel also called Legend. The novel was included as part of the pack and acted as a form of copy protection for the game.http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0006571  Plot  The Drenai Empire is under threat. The tribal Nadir people have been united for the first time by the great warleader Ulric, who has forged a massive empire in the North. The Drenai leader Abalayn is trying to negotiate new treaties with Ulric, but war is brewing and an over 500,000 strong Nadir army marches on the fortress of Dros Delnoch, gateway to the Drenai heartlands. Dros Delnoch is the greatest fortress in the world, a narrow pass guarded by six high walls and a great keep, but under Abalayn its complement of defenders has been reduced to less than 10,000 men under the leadership of an unfit General. The fate of the Drenai hinges on the defence of Dros Delnoch. If the fortress can hold the Nadir horde for three months, the Drenai general Magnus Woundweaver might be able to gather and train a Drenai army. However, given the odds, no-one truly believes that Delnoch can be held. The novel follows the stories of two men who find their destiny at Dros Delnoch. Regnak Wanderer (Rek for short) an ex-army officer and natural 'baresark', seeing a war brewing, resigned his commission because he lacked the courage to risk his life and took to a life of wandering. Rek is an idealist and eventually he returns to Delnoch at the persuasion of the woman he falls in love with and finds his destiny as the Earl of Bronze. The other man is the greatest hero of the Drenai people - Druss the Legend. His death was foretold defending Delnoch and while given the choice to avoid it and fall into senility Druss (and his once possessed axe Snaga) marched to the great fortress to defend his people one last time. In this story Druss is in his sixties and much weaker than his prime but still a formidable warrior and an inspirational leader to the Drenai. The story also flicks into the perspective of several defenders during different stages of the siege as time goes on. It also follows The Thirty, a group of 30 warrior priests of the light whose purpose is to fight and die (except for one priest that leaves to continue the order at the end of each great battle) for the greater good and their people, the Drenai.

Paola is renowned for the ƒ¶al Saflieni Hypogeum, the Basilica of Christ the King (the biggest church in the Maltese Islands), Antoine de Paule Square and its shopping centres, the Good Friday procession, and its football club, Hibernians FC. Mariam Al-Batool Mosque, the only mosque in Malta, as well as an Islamic Cultural Centre are found in Paola. The country's correctional facilities and the largest burial grounds, the Addolorata Cemetery are also in this town. The town is a commercial centre in the Southern Harbour area of Malta, about 5 km from the capital Valletta. It is named after Grand Master Antoine de Paule, who laid the foundation stone in 1626. To encourage migration to Paola, de Paule gave indemnity to the debts of the families who moved there. This account was recorded for the first time by de Solidanis in the eighteenth century. He says that in 1750 the village was not yet its own parish (as it fell under the parish of Tarxien).http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Scientia%20(Malta)/Scientia.%2015(1949)4(Oct.-Dec.)/01.pdf p. 174. Paola was almost deserted due to a local disease, but became increasingly habitable after intervention by captain Hunn.MacGill, Thomas (1839), \\"A handbook, or guide, for strangers visiting Malta\\", p.131. There are two parish churches, one dedicated to Christ the King and the other to Our Lady of Lourdes. The feast of Christ the King is celebrated on the fourth Sunday of July and Our Lady of Lourdes is celebrated on the first Sunday after 17 August. The parish also has a Franciscan church dedicated to Saint Anthony, in the Gƒßajn Dwieli zone of the parish. St. Ubaldesca Church is the oldest church in Paola and was the first parish church there. In 2008 the church underwent minimal restoration. Villa Perellos, which is dedicated to the homonymous grand master, is a landmark of historical importance for the locality. History =Prehistory= Although Paola was founded in the 17th century, several megalithic remains have been found within the locality. The Hypogeum The Hypogeum of ƒ¶al-Saflieni The Hypogeum has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Hypogeum is a large complex of rooms hewn out of the limestone about below the surface. It appears to have been used as a burial site, and also as a temple. Neolithic man carved out the Hypogeum using only antlers and stone picks as tools, and in semi darkness. The Hypogeum is made up of three levels, which are superimposed upon each other. The upper level resembles the earlier rock-cut tombs found elsewhere on the Islands. The middle level, hewn out during the temple period (3800 - 2500 B.C.) is made up of numerous chambers. Many statuettes, amulets, figurines and vases were recovered here. The most famous figurine is that of the so-called Sleeping Lady, a reclining figurine, perhaps meant as a representation of eternal sleep. It is on display at the National Museum of Archaeology, Valletta Kordin Temples The Kordin Temples were located on a high plain that overlooks the Grand Harbour: *Kordin I ‚Äì The temple was excavated in part by A.A. Caruana, and later by Sir Themistocles Zammit in 1908 and finished by T. Ashby and T.E. Peet in 1909. It was poorly preserved and consisted of small and irregular rooms. Kordin I was left open to the elements. Bombings during the Second World War and construction on the site have obliterated all of the remains. *Kordin II ‚Äì The temple was first investigated by Cesare Vassallo in 1840. A.A. Caruana started to excavate the site properly in 1892. The excavation was continued by Albert Mayer in 1901 and finished by Ashby and Peet in their campaign of 1908‚Äì9. The chronology was difficult to figure out, and whether all of the building could be dated to the temple period is debatable. Kordin II must have been in use during the entire temple period since pottery throughout this period's phases were found during its excavation. Kordin II was damaged by the air bombardments of the Second World War and the new buildings that were constructed since. *Kordin III ‚Äì This is the only temple on Kordin still in existence today, and it is of the standard ƒ†gantija-phase 3-apse design. It is the only temple whose forecourt, which is in front of the concave fa√ßade, has a stone pavement, as is the entrance passage leading to the central court. Behind the temple and contemporary with it, are small rooms possibly used for storerooms or the like, or even an irregular, lobed minor temple. One of the most noted feature of Kordin III is the 2.75-metre-long 'trough' lying across the entrance to the left apse. It has seven deep transverse grooves produced by grinding. It is made of hard limestone brought from over 2 kilometres away so it is highly probable that it is for grinding corn (a multiple quern) and contemporary with the temple rather than for grinding 'deffun', the traditional Maltese roofing material, which would make it considerably more recent. Kordin III is in a walled area next to the Church of St. Anthony and is kept locked to give it maximum protection.Columbia-Lippincott Gazetteer, 1952 Edition. p. 1425. Other Several other remains from pre-history to classic antiquity remain in Paola. =Order of St. John= Antoine de Paule was appointed Grand Master of the Order of St. John on 10 March 1623, when he was 71 years old. On 20 July 1626, to address a growing population, he set up a new town on the hill known as Tal-Gƒßerien (literally: of the caves) which was named Casal Nuovo (meaning: new town) since it was funded during the rule of the Order. The town was later named Casal Paola to bear the family name of the Grand Master. To present date, the town is still referred to by this name. The town's coat of arms originally consisted of a white and red octagonal cross contrasted against a white and red background. During the Military Order, the town became the spiritual successor of the neighbouring town Tarxien and still depended for military tactics by the Chief of Army of Zejtun. During his rule, De Paule built a church in the town, dedicated to St. Ubaldesca who was a Sister of the Order of St. John, and this church was the first parish church of the town.\\"Tal-Gƒßerien\\", Pope Urbanus VIII issued a Bull that gave permission for this church to be built. This Papal Bull was issued from the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome on 31 July 1629. An extract from this Bull reads as follows: \\"we accept this request and to the afore mentioned Antonius, with the Apostolic authority granted by this Bull, we give the authority that in the mentioned town in a location of his preference, as long as it is comfortable and just, a church can be built in honour of the afore- mentioned Saint.\\" On 12 November 1629, the Council of the Order of St. John decided to effect what was written on the Bull. The laying of the first foundation stone of this church was celebrated in grand style by Grand Master de Paule himself on Sunday 25 August 1630. \\"On the day of Sunday, the 25th day of the month of August 1630, which is the feast of the king Saint Ludovico, the Most Serene and the Most Revered Grand Master Fra Antoine de Paule went to the town, which for the past four years had taken the name of his family and which was established in the land of Marsa, and he was accompanied by numerous Venerable Gran Cruci as well as by numerous brethren from our Order and in front of a crowd of people he laid the first stone of the church which was to be built for the grace of God and the Holy Virgin Ubaldesca, sister of our Religion, with the permission of the Most Reverend Prior of the church, Fra Salvatur Imbroll, who was adorned with pontifical clothes and according to the rites of the Holy Roman Church. This was done with the apolostic authority given by the Magnificent His Holiness from Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, on the 3ist of July 1629 and which was written in the public deed of the Notary Lorenzo Grima.\\" The church was enlarged in 1900 to accommodate the growing population of Paola and it became a parish in 1910, when it was dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. A new and larger church, the one dedicated to Christ the King, was eventually built to replace it in Antoine de Paule Square, the town's main square. Since then, the church has undergone restoration and its interior is adorned with gold guilding and a niche holding the parish's titular statue of Christ the King.

Friend derived his style from the Iyengar style of yoga and reintroduced elements of Hindu spirituality into a more health-oriented Western approach to Yoga. Style of yoga The Anusara style emphasizes a set of Universal Principles of Alignment which underlie all of the physical asanas and are connected to philosophical aspects of the practice. The school's ideology is \\"grounded in a Tantric philosophy of intrinsic goodness\\".Principles of Anusara yoga philosophy The term \\"Anusara (a-nu-sar-a), means 'flowing with Grace,' 'flowing with Nature' and 'following your heart,'\\" as interpreted from the Sanskrit ' (‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§∏‡§æ‡§∞), meaning \\"custom, usage, natural state or condition\\". Instructors who are certified to teach Anusara are exclusively associated with the Anusara School of Hatha Yoga, formed in 2012, after John Friend and Anusara Inc. were embroiled in a scandal that resulted in Friend's stepping down from his role in Anusara. Friend transferred all rights to the name ‚ÄúAnusara‚Äù to the newly formed school and dissolved Anusara, Inc.

It now has over 800 teachers worldwide.Anusara Yoga site ASHY's Vision is \\"To foster a unified community that inspires and supports all practitioners of Anusara yoga from local to global\\" and its Mission is \\"To provide the structure that promotes and sustains the growth of Anusara yoga‚Äôs philosophy and methodology.\\" Founder John Friend starting a workshop in Copenhagen, June 2010, while he was still associated with Anusara John Friend (born May 30, 1959) started practicing yoga postures as shown in the book Integral Yoga Hatha by Swami Satchidananda at age 13. He lived in Ohio until 19 years old, and then moved to Texas. Before becoming a yoga teacher, Friend worked as a financial analyst until he quit in 1986 to teach yoga full-time. In the years following he traveled to California to study with Judith Lasater, and began to focus on Iyengar yoga. Friend was a popular teacher in the Iyengar style and, during the 1990s, served on the board of the Iyengar Yoga Organization for four years before leaving to found Anusara, Inc. in 1997. Since 2012, Friend has had no role in Anusara nor the training and certifying of teachers in the Anusara School of Hatha Yoga. =2012 scandal and exit from Anusara= In February 2012 an anonymous author published online accusations against Friend. The allegations accused Friend of being associated with a Wiccan coven made up of Anusara teachers and employees, and that Friend engaged in sexual relations with women in the coven, several of whom were married. Friend was also accused of de- funding employees' benefits plans without notifying them, and for arranging delivery of marijuana shipped for his own use to Anusara's main office. Friend soon announced his resignation as officer and director of Anusara Inc. In September 2012, Friend returned to teaching a set hatha yoga sequence of 108 asanas called \\"The Roots\\" based on Anusara's Universal Principles of Alignment.

In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression: :* In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor. :* In k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of k nearest neighbors. k-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until function evaluation. Since this algorithm relies on distance for classification, normalizing the training data can improve its accuracy dramatically. Both for classification and regression, a useful technique can be to assign weights to the contributions of the neighbors, so that the nearer neighbors contribute more to the average than the more distant ones. For example, a common weighting scheme consists in giving each neighbor a weight of 1/d, where d is the distance to the neighbor.This scheme is a generalization of linear interpolation. The neighbors are taken from a set of objects for which the class (for k-NN classification) or the object property value (for k-NN regression) is known. This can be thought of as the training set for the algorithm, though no explicit training step is required. A peculiarity of the k-NN algorithm is that it is sensitive to the local structure of the data. Statistical setting Suppose we have pairs (X_1,Y_1), (X_2,Y_2), \\\\dots, (X_n, Y_n) taking values in \\\\mathbb{R}^d \\\\times \\\\\\\\{1,2\\\\\\\\}, where is the class label of , so that XY=r \\\\sim P_r for r=1,2 (and probability distributions P_r). Given some norm \\\\\\\\cdot\\\\ on \\\\mathbb{R}^d and a point x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d, let (X_{(1)},Y_{(1)}), \\\\dots, (X_{(n)}, Y_{(n)}) be a reordering of the training data such that \\\\X_{(1)}-x\\\\ \\\\leq \\\\dots \\\\leq \\\\X_{(n)}-x\\\\ Algorithm thumbrightExample of k-NN classification. The test sample (green dot) should be classified either to blue squares or to red triangles. If k = 3 (solid line circle) it is assigned to the red triangles because there are 2 triangles and only 1 square inside the inner circle. If k = 5 (dashed line circle) it is assigned to the blue squares (3 squares vs. 2 triangles inside the outer circle). The training examples are vectors in a multidimensional feature space, each with a class label. The training phase of the algorithm consists only of storing the feature vectors and class labels of the training samples. In the classification phase, k is a user-defined constant, and an unlabeled vector (a query or test point) is classified by assigning the label which is most frequent among the k training samples nearest to that query point. A commonly used distance metric for continuous variables is Euclidean distance. For discrete variables, such as for text classification, another metric can be used, such as the overlap metric (or Hamming distance). In the context of gene expression microarray data, for example, k-NN has been employed with correlation coefficients, such as Pearson and Spearman, as a metric. Often, the classification accuracy of k-NN can be improved significantly if the distance metric is learned with specialized algorithms such as Large Margin Nearest Neighbor or Neighbourhood components analysis. A drawback of the basic \\"majority voting\\" classification occurs when the class distribution is skewed. That is, examples of a more frequent class tend to dominate the prediction of the new example, because they tend to be common among the k nearest neighbors due to their large number. One way to overcome this problem is to weight the classification, taking into account the distance from the test point to each of its k nearest neighbors. The class (or value, in regression problems) of each of the k nearest points is multiplied by a weight proportional to the inverse of the distance from that point to the test point. Another way to overcome skew is by abstraction in data representation. For example, in a self-organizing map (SOM), each node is a representative (a center) of a cluster of similar points, regardless of their density in the original training data. K-NN can then be applied to the SOM. Parameter selection The best choice of k depends upon the data; generally, larger values of k reduces effect of the noise on the classification,Everitt, Brian S.; Landau, Sabine; Leese, Morven; and Stahl, Daniel (2011) \\"Miscellaneous Clustering Methods\\", in Cluster Analysis, 5th Edition, John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., Chichester, UK but make boundaries between classes less distinct. A good k can be selected by various heuristic techniques (see hyperparameter optimization). The special case where the class is predicted to be the class of the closest training sample (i.e. when k = 1) is called the nearest neighbor algorithm. The accuracy of the k-NN algorithm can be severely degraded by the presence of noisy or irrelevant features, or if the feature scales are not consistent with their importance. Much research effort has been put into selecting or scaling features to improve classification. A particularly popular approach is the use of evolutionary algorithms to optimize feature scaling. Another popular approach is to scale features by the mutual information of the training data with the training classes. In binary (two class) classification problems, it is helpful to choose k to be an odd number as this avoids tied votes. One popular way of choosing the empirically optimal k in this setting is via bootstrap method. The -nearest neighbor classifier The most intuitive nearest neighbour type classifier is the one nearest neighbour classifier that assigns a point to the class of its closest neighbour in the feature space, that is C_n^{1nn}(x) = Y_{(1)}. As the size of training data set approaches infinity, the one nearest neighbour classifier guarantees an error rate of no worse than twice the Bayes error rate (the minimum achievable error rate given the distribution of the data). The weighted nearest neighbour classifier The -nearest neighbour classifier can be viewed as assigning the nearest neighbours a weight 1/k and all others weight. This can be generalised to weighted nearest neighbour classifiers. That is, where the th nearest neighbour is assigned a weight w_{ni}, with \\\\sum_{i=1}^n w_{ni} = 1. An analogous result on the strong consistency of weighted nearest neighbour classifiers also holds. Let C^{wnn}_n denote the weighted nearest classifier with weights \\\\\\\\{w_{ni}\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n. Subject to regularity conditions on the class distributions the excess risk has the following asymptotic expansion :\\\\mathcal{R}_\\\\mathcal{R}(C^{wnn}_{n}) - \\\\mathcal{R}_{\\\\mathcal{R}}(C^{Bayes}) = \\\\left(B_1 s_n^2 + B_2 t_n^2\\\\right) \\\\\\\\{1+o(1)\\\\\\\\}, for constants B_1 and B_2 where s_n^2 = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n w_{ni}^2 and t_n = n^{-2/d}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n w_{ni}\\\\\\\\{i^{1+2/d} - (i-1)^{1+2/d}\\\\\\\\}. The optimal weighting scheme \\\\\\\\{w_{ni}^*\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n, that balances the two terms in the display above, is given as follows: set k^* = \\\\lfloor B n^{\\\\frac 4 {d+4}} \\\\rfloor, :w_{ni}^* = \\\\frac 1 {k^*} \\\\left[1 + \\\\frac d 2 - \\\\frac d {2{k^*}^{2/d}} \\\\\\\\{ i ^{1+2/d} - (i-1)^{1+2/d}\\\\\\\\}\\\\right] for i=1,2,\\\\dots,k^* and : w^*_{ni} = 0 for i = k^*+1,\\\\dots,n. With optimal weights the dominant term in the asymptotic expansion of the excess risk is \\\\mathcal{O}(n^{-\\\\frac 4 {d+4}}). Similar results are true when using a bagged nearest neighbour classifier. Properties k-NN is a special case of a variable-bandwidth, kernel density \\"balloon\\" estimator with a uniform kernel. The naive version of the algorithm is easy to implement by computing the distances from the test example to all stored examples, but it is computationally intensive for large training sets. Using an approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm makes k-NN computationally tractable even for large data sets. Many nearest neighbor search algorithms have been proposed over the years; these generally seek to reduce the number of distance evaluations actually performed. k-NN has some strong consistency results. As the amount of data approaches infinity, the two-class k-NN algorithm is guaranteed to yield an error rate no worse than twice the Bayes error rate (the minimum achievable error rate given the distribution of the data). Various improvements to the k-NN speed are possible by using proximity graphs. For multi-class k-NN classification, Cover and Hart (1967) prove an upper bound error rate of :R^* \\\\ \\\\leq \\\\ R_{k\\\\mathrm{NN}} \\\\ \\\\leq \\\\ R^* \\\\left(2 - \\\\frac{MR^*}{M-1}\\\\right) where R^*is the Bayes error rate (which is the minimal error rate possible), R_{kNN} is the k-NN error rate, and is the number of classes in the problem. For M=2 and as the Bayesian error rate R^* approaches zero, this limit reduces to \\"not more than twice the Bayesian error rate\\". Error rates There are many results on the error rate of the nearest neighbour classifiers. The -nearest neighbour classifier is strongly (that is for any joint distribution on (X, Y)) consistent provided k:=k_n diverges and k_n/n converges to zero as n \\\\to \\\\infty. Let C_n^{knn} denote the nearest neighbour classifier based on a training set of size . Under certain regularity conditions, the excess risk yields the following asymptotic expansion ::\\\\mathcal{R}_\\\\mathcal{R}(C^{knn}_{n}) - \\\\mathcal{R}_{\\\\mathcal{R}}(C^{Bayes}) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{B_1\\\\frac 1 k + B_2 \\\\left(\\\\frac k n\\\\right)^{4/d}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\{1+o(1)\\\\\\\\}, for some constants B_1 and B_2 . The choice k^* = \\\\lfloor B n^{\\\\frac 4 {d+4}} \\\\rfloor offers a trade off between the two terms in the above display, for which the k^*-nearest neighbour error converges to the Bayes error at the optimal (minimax) rate \\\\mathcal{O}(n^{-\\\\frac 4 {d+4}}). Metric learning The K-nearest neighbor classification performance can often be significantly improved through (supervised) metric learning. Popular algorithms are neighbourhood components analysis and large margin nearest neighbor. Supervised metric learning algorithms use the label information to learn a new metric or pseudo-metric. Feature extraction When the input data to an algorithm is too large to be processed and it is suspected to be redundant (e.g. the same measurement in both feet and meters) then the input data will be transformed into a reduced representation set of features (also named features vector). Transforming the input data into the set of features is called feature extraction. If the features extracted are carefully chosen it is expected that the features set will extract the relevant information from the input data in order to perform the desired task using this reduced representation instead of the full size input. Feature extraction is performed on raw data prior to applying k-NN algorithm on the transformed data in feature space. An example of a typical computer vision computation pipeline for face recognition using k-NN including feature extraction and dimension reduction pre-processing steps (usually implemented with OpenCV): # Haar face detection # Mean-shift tracking analysis # PCA or Fisher LDA projection into feature space, followed by k-NN classification Dimension reduction For high-dimensional data (e.g., with number of dimensions more than 10) dimension reduction is usually performed prior to applying the k-NN algorithm in order to avoid the effects of the curse of dimensionality. The curse of dimensionality in the k-NN context basically means that Euclidean distance is unhelpful in high dimensions because all vectors are almost equidistant to the search query vector (imagine multiple points lying more or less on a circle with the query point at the center; the distance from the query to all data points in the search space is almost the same). Feature extraction and dimension reduction can be combined in one step using principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), or canonical correlation analysis (CCA) techniques as a pre- processing step, followed by clustering by k-NN on feature vectors in reduced- dimension space. In machine learning this process is also called low- dimensional embedding.Shaw, Blake; and Jebara, Tony; \\"Structure preserving embedding\\", in Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Machine Learning, ACM, 2009 For very-high-dimensional datasets (e.g. when performing a similarity search on live video streams, DNA data or high- dimensional time series) running a fast approximate k-NN search using locality sensitive hashing, \\"random projections\\",Bingham, Ella; and Mannila, Heikki; \\"Random projection in dimensionality reduction: applications to image and text data\\", in Proceedings of the seventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, ACM, 2001 \\"sketches\\" Ryan, Donna (editor); High Performance Discovery in Time Series, Berlin: Springer, 2004, or other high-dimensional similarity search techniques from the VLDB toolbox might be the only feasible option.  Decision boundary  Nearest neighbor rules in effect implicitly compute the decision boundary. It is also possible to compute the decision boundary explicitly, and to do so efficiently, so that the computational complexity is a function of the boundary complexity.  Data reduction  Data reduction is one of the most important problems for work with huge data sets. Usually, only some of the data points are needed for accurate classification. Those data are called the prototypes and can be found as follows: # Select the class-outliers, that is, training data that are classified incorrectly by k-NN (for a given k) # Separate the rest of the data into two sets: (i) the prototypes that are used for the classification decisions and (ii) the absorbed points that can be correctly classified by k-NN using prototypes. The absorbed points can then be removed from the training set. = Selection of class-outliers = A training example surrounded by examples of other classes is called a class outlier. Causes of class outliers include: * random error * insufficient training examples of this class (an isolated example appears instead of a cluster) * missing important features (the classes are separated in other dimensions which we do not know) * too many training examples of other classes (unbalanced classes) that create a \\"hostile\\" background for the given small class Class outliers with k-NN produce noise. They can be detected and separated for future analysis. Given two natural numbers, k>r>0, a training example is called a (k,r)NN class-outlier if its k nearest neighbors include more than r examples of other classes. = CNN for data reduction = Condensed nearest neighbor (CNN, the Hart algorithm) is an algorithm designed to reduce the data set for k-NN classification. It selects the set of prototypes U from the training data, such that 1NN with U can classify the examples almost as accurately as 1NN does with the whole data set. Calculation of the border ratio. Three types of points: prototypes, class-outliers, and absorbed points. Given a training set X, CNN works iteratively: # Scan all elements of X, looking for an element x whose nearest prototype from U has a different label than x. # Remove x from X and add it to U # Repeat the scan until no more prototypes are added to U. Use U instead of X for classification. The examples that are not prototypes are called \\"absorbed\\" points. It is efficient to scan the training examples in order of decreasing border ratio.Mirkes, Evgeny M.; KNN and Potential Energy: applet, University of Leicester, 2011 The border ratio of a training example x is defined as : where is the distance to the closest example y having a different color than x, and is the distance from y to its closest example x' with the same label as x. The border ratio is in the interval [0,1] because never exceeds . This ordering gives preference to the borders of the classes for inclusion in the set of prototypes U. A point of a different label than x is called external to x. The calculation of the border ratio is illustrated by the figure on the right. The data points are labeled by colors: the initial point is x and its label is red. External points are blue and green. The closest to x external point is y. The closest to y red point is x' . The border ratio is the attribute of the initial point x. Below is an illustration of CNN in a series of figures. There are three classes (red, green and blue). Fig. 1: initially there are 60 points in each class. Fig. 2 shows the 1NN classification map: each pixel is classified by 1NN using all the data. Fig. 3 shows the 5NN classification map. White areas correspond to the unclassified regions, where 5NN voting is tied (for example, if there are two green, two red and one blue points among 5 nearest neighbors). Fig. 4 shows the reduced data set. The crosses are the class-outliers selected by the (3,2)NN rule (all the three nearest neighbors of these instances belong to other classes); the squares are the prototypes, and the empty circles are the absorbed points. The left bottom corner shows the numbers of the class-outliers, prototypes and absorbed points for all three classes. The number of prototypes varies from 15% to 20% for different classes in this example.

One such algorithm uses a weighted average of the k nearest neighbors, weighted by the inverse of their distance. This algorithm works as follows: # Compute the Euclidean or Mahalanobis distance from the query example to the labeled examples. # Order the labeled examples by increasing distance. # Find a heuristically optimal number k of nearest neighbors, based on RMSE. This is done using cross validation. # Calculate an inverse distance weighted average with the k-nearest multivariate neighbors. k-NN outlier The distance to the kth nearest neighbor can also be seen as a local density estimate and thus is also a popular outlier score in anomaly detection. The larger the distance to the k-NN, the lower the local density, the more likely the query point is an outlier. Although quite simple, this outlier model, along with another classic data mining method, local outlier factor, works quite well also in comparison to more recent and more complex approaches, according to a large scale experimental analysis. Validation of results A confusion matrix or \\"matching matrix\\" is often used as a tool to validate the accuracy of k-NN classification. More robust statistical methods such as likelihood-ratio test can also be applied.

He also studied the four gospels and the epistles. Demetrius, 12th Patriarch of Alexandria, ordained him deacon, then a priest over the church of Alexandria. He was successful in the ministry and was faithful in all that was entrusted to him. He followed Origen as head of the Catechetical School of Alexandria.

He is most noted for being one of the founders of both Northwestern University and the University of Denver. The John Evans professorships, the highest honors bestowed on faculty members at both Northwestern University and the University of Denver, are named for him. By bringing railroad service to Denver from several directions, he was responsible for the growth of Denver from a settlement to a city. Evans was forced to resign the governorship in 1865 for his role in instigating the Sand Creek massacre, one of the worst massacres of Native Americans in U.S. history. Early life and education Evans was born in Waynesville, Ohio on March 9, 1814 to Rachel and David Evans, a farmer, hardware store owner, and real estate investor. He began his study of medicine at Clermont Academy in Philadelphia and he graduated from Cincinnati College with a degree in medicine in March 1838. Career =Medicine= Attica, Indiana, where Evans developed a successful medical practice, strategized about opening an asylum, and where his children were born. He married Hannah Canby (1813‚Äì1850) and moved to West Milton, Ohio in December 1838. He moved in July 1839 to Attica, Indiana, where he established a medical practice with Isaac Fisher. He practiced medicine and decided to build an asylum for the insane. The Evans family moved to Indianapolis in 1843 to better focus his lobbying efforts with the Indiana legislature. On January 15, 1844, a bill was passed that allowed for a state asylum to be established and Evans was named as one of the commissioners to have the asylum built. From his research of successful asylums, he determined that fresh food and water as well as a country setting were important. Beginning in 1846, he oversaw the construction and became the first superintendent of the Indiana Central State Hospital in 1845. Mercy Hospital He taught at Rush Medical College in Chicago and then moved there in 1848. He wrote about and developed a program for quarantine for cholera, which he spoke about to Congress. To reduce trauma that babies received through the use of forceps during birth, he invented an obstetrical extractor. He was owner and editor of a medical journal. He was a founder of Lakeside Hospital and brought the Sisters of Mercy to staff the hospital, later named Mercy Hospital. He founded the Illinois State Medical Society. To ease seasickness during travel, he patented a suspended bed for ships in 1872 in England, France, the United States, and Italy. =Education= On June 4, 1850, he was one of the group of Methodists who founded Northwestern University, and was elected the first president of its Board of Trustees. While he lived in Evanston and later lived in Colorado, he donated money and land to fund the university's expenses after it opened in Evanston, Illinois in November 1855. Governor Evans donated land across from his house in Denver and in March 1864 obtained a charter from the territorial legislature to found the Territory's first college, the Colorado Seminary, which later became the University of Denver. Evans served as the Chairman of the University of Denver Board of Trustees until his death on July 2, 1897. Evans donated land in southeast Denver for a new University of Denver campus in 1890. The area is now called University Park. =Investments= Evans began investing in real estate, banking, and railroads in Chicago, which was foundational to his becoming wealthy. He helped establish the Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad. Due to the success with his railroad and real estate investments, he no longer practiced medicine by the mid-1850s. He helped establish the Denver Pacific Railroad to link to Union Pacific's transcontinental line at Cheyenne, Wyoming. He was elected president of Denver Pacific Railroad in 1868 and the railroad connection was completed in 1870. Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad was incorporated in 1875, which brought rail service on two railroad lines to Colorado's mining region. In the 1880s, he built the Denver and New Orleans Railroad. Railroad service into Colorado helped Denver grown to more than 100,000 people by the 1880s from a frontier town of just a few thousand people. =Politics= He was an alderman for Chicago from 1853 to 1855. He focused on education, public health, and urban development. His wealth garnered him a fair amount of political power. He was one of the founders of the Illinois Republican Party due to his belief that slavery was wrong and became a personal friend of Abraham Lincoln after he campaigned for him in 1860. Lincoln appointed Evans, the second Governor of the Territory of Colorado. He took his oath in Washington, D.C. on April 11, 1862 and arrived in Denver by stagecoach on March 16,1862 and began work as the governor on March 26th. While he was governor, he helped establish the legal system, educational institutions, economy and infrastructure of the Colorado Territory. He also promoted Colorado's statehood, but its citizens overwhelming voted against it in September 1864 because the men of the state would be subject to military service for the Civil War and because the territory did not have the population to support running the Colorado without the support of the federal government. He was also the territory's superintendent of Indian Affairs, but did not consider how greatly Native Americans' lives were impacted by the way in which settlers thwarted their access to resources that they needed to survive. Evans strategy was to create treaties that allocated land for white settlers from Native American tribes. Railroad tracks He believed that constructing railroads from the east and through Colorado was important for the territory's growth. He worked with survey crews to define the best routes. He worked on a enforcing a treaty where Native Americans were assigned to reservations. Native American tribes‚Äîthe Arapaho, Cheyenne, Kiowa, Ute people and Sioux‚Äîwere indigenous to Colorado and hunted throughout the area. Hostilities grew as settlers came to Colorado and there was concern that the Native American people would join the Confederate army during the Civil War. He lobbied for railroads for Colorado in Washington, D.C. and he was instrumental in having the Union Pacific Railroad create a link to Denver, having a railroad line connect to San Francisco, and another line from Denver to Galveston, Texas on the Gulf of Mexico. =Sand Creek Massacre= Denver, 1859. During its early history, Cherokee and Arapaho often camped in the area. Citizens of Denver feared that tribes were gathering to over-run Denver. An order by Evans to shoot on sight any member of any tribe had been approved by Lincoln. Evans issues a proclamation in August 1864 that authorized \\"all citizens of Colorado... to go in pursuit of all hostile Indians [and] kill and destroy all enemies of the country.\\" Because of the lack of the ability to defend Denver because of the men fighting in the civil war, Evans ordered that so-called \\"friendly\\" \\"Indians\\" should present themselves to various forts for their \\"safety and protection,\\" and those who did not were \\"hostile\\" and should be \\"pursued and destroyed.\\" Camp Weld, September 28, 1864 Chief Black Kettle had shared with Native Americans that it was important that they made peace with the settlers or they would be crushed. He met with Lincoln and was very proud to have been given a large American flag in the fall of 1864. There were only a few Native Americans, including Black Kettle, that accepted Evan's offer of amnesty. That year, Governor Evans appointed John Chivington as Colonel of the Colorado Volunteers. Chivington and his men knew of the band of Cheyenne and Arapaho led by Black Kettle, who had reported to Fort Lyon as ordered by Evans but left when there were no provisions for them there. Black Kettle and his group then camped along Sand Creek in the east central part of the Territory. This area was within Arapaho and Cheyenne territory according to the Fort Wise Treaty of 1861. Black Kettle at Sand Creek, Buffalo Bill Center of the West On November 29, 1864, Colonel Chivington ordered 700 cavalry troopers to attack Black Kettle's peaceful encampment, when most of the men were away hunting. They killed about 28 unarmed men and 105 women and children and wounding many more during the Sand Creek massacre. A few Cheyenne, including Black Kettle, were able to escape. Governor Evans decorated Chivington and his men for their \\"valor in subduing the savages.\\" Two U.S. Congressional committees and one military committee were formed to investigate the massacre, which found guilt on the part of the U.S. Government in 1865.\\"Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site Study Act of 1998,\\" Public Law 105‚Äì243, 105th Congress Evans was accused of a cover-up. He was forced to resign as Governor in 1865 and Chivington's political ambitions were ruined. Personal life John Evans House, Denver, about 1870s. When the Evans first came to Denver, settlers established themselves in tents and simple low-roofed cabins. Then, they constructed simple frame houses. A house of brick was a rarity in Denver's early years. Evans married Hannah Canby in 1838. They settled in Attica, Indiana where sons Joseph and Davis were born, in 1839 and 1841 respectively. Evans, raised in the Quaker faith, converted to Methodism, after hearing a talk by Matthew Simpson, a Methodist Episcopal minister. He became a member of the Freemasons. His daughter Josephine was born and his sons died while in Attica. She was the only child of four children born the Evans and his wife to survive childhood. Hannah contracted tuberculosis soon after the family moved to Chicago in 1848. She died on October 9, 1850. Hannah Canby Evans and their sons are buried in the old cemetery in Attica. On August 18, 1853, he married for the second time to Margaret Patten Gray. She was the sister-in-law of a fellow trustee of Northwestern University. In 1855, he moved to a large house in Evanston, Illinois, which was named for him in 1854. In 1855, Evans and his wife had a son, William Gray Evans, whose efforts led to the development of Moffat Tunnel and the Denver Tramway Company. He came to Denver in 1862 and had a house at 14th and Arapahoe. Evans Memorial Chapel built by John Evans after the death of his daughter, Josephine Evans Elbert. It is located on the University of Denver campus In 1871, their daughter Anne was born. She played a key role in the development of the Central City Opera, Civic Center Park, the Denver Public Library, and the Denver Art Museum. John's daughter, Josephine, married Samuel Hitt Elbert. She died as a young woman and Evans built the Evans Memorial Chapel in her memory. In 1868, John Evans and Samuel Elbert purchased land near Evergreen, Colorado for a summer retreat and ranch called Evans‚ÄìElbert Ranch. Denver's Riverside Cemetery Evans was in poor health in the last year of his life and his wife became the executor of his estate in November 1896. He died in Denver on July 2 or 3 in 1897. Legacy John Evans' daughter, Josephine Evans Elbert, was married to Samuel Hitt Elbert, the sixth Governor of Colorado Territory from 1873 to 1874. Mount Evans is named in Evans honor, and Mount Elbert is named in honor of his son- in-law. In 1963, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum. During the 21st century, Evans's legacy came under renewed scrutiny for his beliefs regarding Native Americans. Colorado State Historian David Halaas said, \\"When it came to Indians, Evans believed they didn‚Äôt have souls, that they were heathen savages, they were infernal‚Äîall words that he used to describe Indian people.\\" See also *History of Colorado *Law and Government of Colorado *List of Governors of Colorado *Territory of Colorado *University of Denver *Northwestern University Notes References External links * Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site Study Act of 1998 *The Governors of Colorado @ Colorado.gov **Biography of John Evans @ Colorado.gov * 1814 births 1897 deaths Colorado Mining Boom Evanston, Illinois Governors of Colorado Territory Colorado Republicans Northwestern University faculty People from Waynesville, Ohio People of Colorado in the American Civil War University of Denver people American Methodists American people of Welsh descent University and college founders Illinois Republicans 19th-century American politicians ","title":"John Evans (Colorado governor)"},{"id":"1775402","text":"Mercedes-Benz has sold a number of automobiles with the \\"560\\" model name: * 1986-1989 R107 ** 1986-1989 560SL * 1986-1991 W126 ** 1986-1991 560SEC ** 1986-1991 560SEL ** 1989-1991 560SE * 2013-current W222 ** 2018 S 560 4MATIC ** 2018 Mercedes-Maybach S 560 4MATIC ** 2018 S 560 e Plug-In Hybrid * 2014-current C217 ** 2018 S 560 Coupe 4MATIC ** 2018 S 560 Cabriolet 4MATIC 560 ","title":"Mercedes-Benz 560"},{"id":"1775403","text":"James Lockyer (born December 21, 1949) is a lawyer and a prominent social justice activist in Toronto,James Lockyer is the founding partner in LCP-Law Canada.

Most information known about him comes from his large surviving correspondence. Only one original letter survives to this day; the remaining letters are excerpted in the works of Eusebius. Called \\"the Great\\" by Eusebius, Basil of Caesarea and others, he was characterized by the Catholic Encyclopedia as \\"undoubtedly, after St. Cyprian, the most eminent bishop of the third century... like St. Cyprian, less a great theologian than a great administrator.\\" Early life Dionysius was born to a wealthy polytheistic family sometime in the late 2nd, or early 3rd century. He spent most of his life reading books and carefully studying the traditions of polytheists. He converted to Christianity at a mature age and discussed his conversion experience with Philemon, a presbyter of Pope Sixtus II.Chapman, John. \\"Dionysius of Alexandria.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 6 Apr. 2013 Dionysius converted to Christianity when he received a vision sent from God; in it he was commanded to vigorously study the heresies facing the Christian Church so that he could refute them through doctrinal study. After his conversion, he joined the Catechetical School of Alexandria and was a student of Origen and Pope Heraclas. He eventually became leader of the school and presbyter of the Christian church, succeeding Pope Heraclas in 231. Later he became Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria & Patriarch of the See of St. Mark in 248 after the death of Pope Heraclas. Work as Bishop of Alexandria Dionysius was more an able administrator than a great theologian. Information on his work as Bishop of Alexandria is found in Dionysius' correspondence with other bishops and clergymen of the third century Christian Church. Dionysius‚Äô correspondences included interpretations on the Gospel of Luke, the Gospel of John and the Book of Revelation. During 249, a major persecution was carried out in Alexandria by a polytheist mob, and hundreds were assaulted, stoned, burned or cut down on account of their refusal to deny their faith. Dionysius managed to survive this persecution and the civil war that followed. In January 250 the new emperor Decius issued a decree of legal persecution. Out of fear many Christians denied their faith by offering a token polytheist sacrifice, while others attempted to obtain false documents affirming their sacrifice. Others who refused to sacrifice faced public ridicule and shame among their family and friends, and, if found by the authorities, brutal torture and execution. Many fled from the city into the desert, where most succumbed to exposure, hunger, thirst, or attacks by bandits or wild animals.\\"Saint Dionysius\\", The College of Saint Dionysius Dionysius himself was pursued by the prefect Aurelius Appius Sabinus, who had sent out an assassin to murder him on sight. Dionysius spent three days in hiding before departing on the fourth night of the Decian decree with his servants and other loyal brethren. After a brush with a group of soldiers, he managed to escape with two of his followers, and set up a residence in the Libyan desert until the end of the persecution the following year. He supported Pope Cornelius in the controversy of 251, arising when Novatian, a learned presbyter of the Church at Rome, set up a schismatic church with a rigorist position on the readmittance of Christians who had apostasized during the persecution. In opposition to Novatian's teaching, Dionysius ordered that the Eucharist should be refused to no one who asked it at the hour of death, even those who had previously lapsed.Butler, Alban. Lives of the Saints, Vol. XI, 1866 In 252 an outbreak of plague ravaged Alexandria, and Dionysius, along with other priests and deacons, took it upon themselves to assist the sick and dying. The persecutions subsided somewhat under Trebonianus Gallus, but were renewed under Valerian who replaced Gallus. Dionysius was imprisoned and then exiled. When Gallienus, took over the empire he released all the believers who were in prison and brought back those in exile. Gallienus wrote to Dionysius and the bishops a letter to assure their safety in opening the churches.\\"The Story of Abba Dionysius\\", Coptic Orthodox Church Prophetic exegesis About AD 255 a dispute arose concerning the millennialist views taught in Refutation of Allegorists by Nepos, a bishop in Egypt, which insisted on the interpretation of Revelation Chapter 20 as denoting a literal \\"millennium of bodily luxury\\" on earth. Because he was taught by Origen, Dionysius succeeded through his oral and written efforts in checking this Egyptian revival of millennialism. He offered some critical grounds to reject the Book of Revelation, such as an alleged difference in style and diction from John's Gospel and Epistles. Dionysius main position was to claim it was not written by John: \\" 'I could not venture to reject the book, as many brethren hold it in high esteem,' \\" yet he ascribed it to another John - some \\"holy and inspired man\\" - but not the apostle John. His impact was felt in later years concerning the canonicity of the Apocalypse, causing much dialogue in the church, lingering in the East for several centuries. Thus it was that certain leaders began to retreat from millennialism in precisely the same quantity as philosophical theology became influential. Legacy Basil of Caesarea writes to Pope Damasus I about aid sent by Dionysius, to the church at Caesarea.

History Khazar kingship was divided between the Khagan and the Bek or Khagan Bek. Contemporary Arab historians related that the Khagan was purely a spiritual ruler or figurehead with limited powers, while the Bek was responsible for administration and military affairs. In the Khazar Correspondence, King Joseph identifies himself as the ruler of the Khazars and makes no reference to a colleague. It has been disputed whether Joseph was a Khagan or a Bek; his description of his military campaigns make the latter probable. A third option is that by the time of the Correspondence (c. 950‚Äì960) the Khazars had merged the two positions into a single ruler, or that the Beks had somehow supplanted the Khagans or vice versa. Some sources refer to the Khazar Bek as ishad (a G√∂kt√ºrk military rank) or Malik (Arabic for \\"king\\", also used as a high rank). He was theoretically the subordinate of the Khagan but in reality controlled the military and civil government for the Khazar khaganate.

It is based on the 1998‚Äì2005 Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W220), though it rides on an shorter wheelbase. Sales in Germany started in August 1999 for the CL 500 V8. The C215 exterior design and active suspension was previewed by the Mercedes-Benz F200 concept in 1996. The CL-Class is offered as seven models: the V8-powered CL 500, the V8 powered naturally aspirated CL 55 AMG, the supercharged V8-powered CL 55 AMG, the V12-powered CL 600, a limited-edition V12-powered CL 63 AMG, and the bi-turbo V12-powering the CL 600 bi-turbo and the CL 65 AMG. All models seat four. Exterior design produced a for a regular models and 0.29 for AMG. Features and equipment The CL- Class coup√©s come equipped with the very latest in Mercedes-Benz technology, and along with the S-Class sedans the CL coup√©s receive new technological features. C215 was the second car (after the W220 S-Class) with Distronic: the first worldwide radar-assisted Autonomous cruise control system. It was the first car in the world with both low beam and high beam (Bi-Xenon) High Intensity Discharge headlamps. The C215 was standard equipped with the hydraulic Active Body Control (ABC) system. It is technically more advanced than standard Airmatic air suspension found on the W220 S-Class sibling, and keeps the car level even in fast corners, provides a comfort and sports setting. Also, the car height can be increased by using a button, increasing ground clearance (3 settings) for driving on difficult terrain, lowers automatically at higher speeds. From 1999 through 2003, the V12-equipped cars featured a cylinder deactivation system called Active Cylinder Control. The feature was dropped when the bi-turbo V12 was introduced. This disactivation feature allowed the CL 600 to get better fuel economy than the comparable CL 500 (when not equipped with ACC itself, an option for the V8), especially on the road where the six-cylinder operation could be effectively used. Essentially, the engine is two Mercedes six-cylinder series engines mated to a common crank with separate engine monitoring systems. =Safety= CL 600 In 2003, the cars were upgraded with Pre-Safe precrash system and a newer electronics package that included a DVD-based navigation system instead of the CD-based COMAND system. Also, the engine options changed. The CL 55 AMG became supercharged allowing the car to accelerate from 0-60 mph in 4.27sec according to Motor Trend and the V12 CL 600 had turbochargers added and a slight engine reduction, from 5786 cc to 5513 cc. Both cars produced the distinction, again, was the quietness of the CL 600 as compared to rather noisy CL 55 AMG. The more powerful CL 65 produced . The top speed of the car was limited to . Electronic Stability Program (ESP) and Brake Assist were standard features for difficult driving conditions and emergency maneuvers. The C215 CL-Class added standard front and rear side curtain airbags. In total, the C215 features 8 airbags: 2 frontal (driver and passenger), 4 side airbags (one for each passenger, optional for rear seats) and 2 window-airbags. LED brake lights were also standard issue on the C215. LED brake lights illuminate faster than conventional bulbs. =Comfort and convenience= CL 65 AMG *Distronic cruise control, which could maintain a set distance between the CL-Class and any vehicle in front. *Speedtronic adjustable speed limiter for not exceeding a set speed on roads with speed limits. *Keyless Go, a smart key entry and startup system. *Rain-sensing windshield wipers. *Light sensors to turn the headlights on and off automatically, depending on lighting circumstances. The instrument display and the COMAND screen's backlight and colour also adjust automatically depending on the ambient light situation. *Parktronic visual and audible parking aid, with sensors in the front and rear bumpers. Also, the passenger side mirror can swivel down automatically when engaging reverse, to help see the curb. *Automatically heated exterior mirrors. *Fully automatic climate control system with pollen and charcoal filters and optional separate rear-seat climate controls. *COMAND system combines the controls for audio systems, the television, the navigation and the telephone. COMAND based cars offer higher quality audio compared to the Audio 10 system. *Optional BOSE sound system. *Summer Open/Close - Ability to open and close all four windows and the sunroof at the sametime upon entry and/or exit from the vehicle. *Self opening and closing trunk. *Self-closing doors. *Electrically adjustable seats are standard. Optional were the memory function for the seats (standard in many countries on the larger engine models) and the multi-contour backrests with massage function. *Easy entry/exit function. *Auto-dimming interior and driver's side exterior rear view mirrors to prevent being dazzled by cars behind. *bi-xenon headlamps *Linguatronic voice recognition system which can be used to control the audio system, navigation system, and a cellular telephone through voice commands. Limited Editions CL 63 AMG, one of only 26 produced. The CL 63 AMG is the rarest C215 CL-Class of all. It was produced only in November 2001, presented at Frankfurt International Motor Show same year and just 26 examples were ever built for sale. Each car cost ‚Ç¨272,000 when new. Some UK examples were registered in March 2002. The V12-powered CL 63 AMG was only sold in Europe and Asia. Mercedes-Benz never offered the C215 CL 63 for sale; all were sold exclusively through AMG. Its naturally aspirated V12 engine developed 326 kW. In 2000 Mercedes-Benz presented CL 55 AMG F1 Limited Edition model. With production limited to only 55 numbered examples, cars sported lighter carbon-ceramic brake discs with special eight-piston Brembo calipers. Model was based on a standard naturally aspirated CL 55 AMG with identical performance values but better stopping power. Available only in metallic silver with black and silver leather interior with an option of sports bucket seats. F1 Limited Edition logos can be found on an illuminated door sills and on a carbon-fibre finished centre console along with a series number.

Definition An active moiety is a molecule or ion, excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt (including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds), or other noncovalent derivative (such as a complex, chelate, or clathrate) of the molecule, responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. An NCE is a molecule developed by the innovator company in the early drug discovery stage, which after undergoing clinical trials could translate into a drug that could be a treatment for some disease. Synthesis of an NCE is the first step in the process of drug development. Once the synthesis of the NCE has been completed, companies have two options before them. They can either go for clinical trials on their own or license the NCE to another company. In the latter option, companies can avoid the expensive and lengthy process of clinical trials, as the licensee company would be conducting further clinical trials and subsequently launching the drug. Companies adopting this model of business would be able to generate high margins as they get a huge one-time payment for the NCE as well as entering into a revenue sharing agreement with the licensee company. Under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, all new chemical entities must first be reviewed by an advisory committee before the FDA can approve these products.

Greys Court is a Tudor country house and gardens in the southern Chiltern Hills at Rotherfield Greys, near Henley-on- Thames in the county of Oxfordshire, England. Now owned by the National Trust, it is located at , and is open to the public. William Paul, Esq. of Bray (1673-1711), by John Closterman; his father James Paul bought Greys in 1688.

The mainly Tudor-style house has a courtyard and gardens. The walled gardens contain old-fashioned roses and wisteria, an ornamental vegetable garden, maze (laid to grass with brick paths, dedicated by Archbishop Robert Runcie on 12 October 1981) and ice house. Within its grounds are the fortified tower built circa 1347, the only remains of the medieval castle, overlooking the gardens and surrounding countryside, as well as a Tudor wheelhouse. The house remains furnished as a family home, with some outstanding 18th-century plasterwork interiors. It is a Grade I listed building. History John de Grey, 2nd Baron Grey de Rotherfield, one of the original founder Knights of the Garter, was granted a license to crenellate his Rotherfield house in 1346, when he also considerably enlarged the group of buildings. The estate passed to the Crown in 1485 and was granted to Robert Knollys in 1514 for an annual rental of a red rose, remaining in the Knollys family until 1642, during which time the current house and its associated buildings were constructed. Sir William Paul bought the house in 1686 and it passed via his son William's daughter's dowry to Sir William Stapleton, 4th Baronet in 1724. Between 1935 and 1937 the house was occupied by Evelyn Fleming, mother of the author Ian Fleming. In 1937 the house was bought from the Stapletons by Sir Felix Brunner and his wife Lady Brunner (n√©e Elizabeth Irving), the granddaughter of the Victorian actor-manager Sir Henry Irving. In 1969 the family donated the property to the National Trust, where Lady Brunner continued to live until her death in 2003. Use as a filming location The house appeared in a series 3 (2012) episode of Downton Abbey when Crawley family visit the property, known to them as Eryholme. The house was used by the Dowager Countess' late husband as a hunting lodge. Robert, the Earl of Grantham, was considering moving there with his family as he was about to lose Downton to debt and taxes. It also appeared in the ITV series Agatha Christie's Poirot in 2013. In the adaptation of Elephants Can Remember it is used as the home of one of the people Ariadne Oliver visits while investigating the case. The episode was screened on 9 June 2013.

She is best known for The Borrowers series of low fantasy novels (1952 to 1982), which is named after its first book and, in turn, the tiny people who live secretly in the midst of contemporary human civilisation. Norton won the 1952 Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising The Borrowers as the year's outstanding children's book by a British author. For the 70th anniversary of the Medal in 2007 it was named one of the top ten winning works, selected by a panel to compose the ballot for a public election of the all-time favourite. Norton's novels The Magic Bed Knob; or, How to Become a Witch in Ten Easy Lessons and Bonfires and Broomsticks were adapted into the 1971 Disney film Bedknobs and Broomsticks.

She married Robert Charles Norton on 4 September 1927 and had four children, two boys and two girls; her son, also named Robert Norton, became a printer and Microsoft executive. Her second husband was Lionel Bonsey, whom she married in 1970. She began working for the War Office in 1940 before the family moved temporarily to the United States.

She was born into the third generation of the prosperous and influential Ikoma clan in about 1538 and her father was known as Iemune. Before Kitsuno became Oda Nobunaga's concubine, she was first wed to Yaheji Dota who died in the battle of Akechi. After the loss of her husband, Kitsuno returned to her family's home, Ikoma mansion. It was there that she met Oda Nobunaga.  Concubine of Oda Nobunaga  It was believed that Oda Nobunaga was charmed by Kitsuno's beauty at first sight, and immediately took her as his concubine. Nobunaga was officially married to Lady N≈ç, the daughter of Sait≈ç D≈çsan, but it was believed that theirs was not a happy marriage, especially since N≈çhime could not conceive. It is often thought that Kitsuno was Nobunaga's most beloved concubine and that she probably had a higher position than N≈çhime. In 1557 Kitsuno gave birth to Nobutada and later Nobukatsu and Tokuhime (Lady Toku). In 1564, Kitsuno moved to Kori Castle (in present-day K≈çnan, Aichi). She suffered due to the difficulty of her childbirths, and in 1566 she died at the age of 29. Even though Nobunaga is often regarded as a callous and bellicose figure, it is said that Nobunaga mourned her throughout the night and had her buried within view of his castle. Her body was cremated and buried in the cemetery at Kyusho temple (the Ikoma family temple), in Tashiro town. Nobunaga gave his son Nobukatsu the area in which Kyusho temple lies in order to protect it and Kitsuno's tomb, out of respect for his treasured concubine.

Like most of Infocom's games, it was released for several popular computer platforms of the time, such as the Apple II and PC. As the title indicates, the game is based on the 1975 novel Sh≈çgun by James Clavell. It is Infocom's thirty-third game. Plot The game reproduces many of the novel's scenes, few of which are interconnected in any way. The player assumes the role of John Blackthorne, pilot-major of the Dutch trading ship Erasmus. During a voyage in the Pacific Ocean in the year 1600, the Erasmus is shipwrecked in Japan. Blackthorne must survive in a land where every custom is as unfamiliar to him as the language. After learning some of the society's ways, he is drawn into a political struggle between warlords and falls in love with a Japanese woman. Eventually he embraces Japanese life and is honored as a samurai. Feelies Infocom continued its tradition of feelies, or extra items included in the game package. The feelies included with Sh≈çgun were a map representing John Blackthorne's \\"known world\\" of 1600, and The Soul of the Samurai, a booklet describing the history and significance of samurai swords. Notes By 1989, Infocom no longer categorized its games according to estimated difficulty level. Sh≈çgun could be said to fall anywhere from Infocom's former \\"Standard\\" level to \\"Expert\\". Players who are intimately familiar with the novel, of course, may find the game to be much easier than those who have not read the book. Sh≈çgun features several illustrations in the style of Japanese Ukiyo-e woodcuts. While graphics of any kind were disdained in Infocom's early years, four of their final games included at least incidental illustrations and images. In sharp contrast to Douglas Adams' close work with Steve Meretzky on Infocom's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy game, James Clavell contributed little to the design of the game, although he and Dave Lebling met several times. He treated the game as a traditional licensing agreement rather than a collaboration.http://waxy.org/2008/04/milliways_infocoms_unreleased_sequel_to_hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galax/#comment-1650044 Consequently, the game contains many scenes from the novel presented verbatim or made thinly interactive. Dave Lebling has said that he considers Sh≈çgun the worst game he was ever responsible for overall, although he is proud of several of the timing puzzles. Reception Dave Arneson gave Sh≈çgun a negative review in Computer Gaming World. He wrote that the linear nature of the game and poor hints contributed to guess-the-verb and trial-and-error gameplay, and that the illustrations‚Äîwhile \\"nice to look at\\"‚Äîdid not provide information to play the game. Arneson praised the game's large size, but concluded that Sh≈çgun was only \\"mildly interesting\\" and inferior to Zork Zero.

The company can then be sold to a person or group of persons who wish to start a company without going through all the procedures of creating a new one. Reasons for buying Common reasons for buying a shelf corporation include: * To save the time involved in taking the steps to create a new corporation. * To gain the opportunity to bid on contracts. Some jurisdictions require that a company be in business for a certain length of time to have this ability. * To show corporate longevity in order to attract consumers or investors. * To gain access to corporate credit. These reasons are open to criticism. Many years ago, it would take months to properly incorporate a business. However, it is now quite easy, at least in Australia, Canada, the United States and Western Europe, to do so. In fact, it can now be done in as little as a couple of hours in some jurisdictions. In Australia, a new company can get registered within 10 minutes. A corporation might end up \\"on the shelf\\" precisely because of a bad business history. It is questionable whether a shelf corporation improves access to capital, since creditors and investors look into a company's history as part of due diligence. A number of consortia \\"produce\\" and sell shelf corporations, promoting the fact that the new buyer can at the same time have a corporation with a long history, and yet have complete control over the establishment of the corporation's board of directors and shareholder profile. One item to be aware of is the re-aging of the shelf corporation. If the credit bureaus learn about the company being under new management, they will list it on their reports, effectively \\"re-aging\\" the company. Examples A Reuters report described Wyoming Corporate Services as an example of a vendor of shelf companies, which were literally stored in mailboxes labelled as \\"corporate suites\\" in the main room of a brick house a few blocks from the Wyoming State Capitol. Over 700 companies were available at prices depending on their age, ranging from $5,995 for a six-year-old company to $645 for one recently created. It is one of scores of similar businesses setting up shop, primarily in Delaware, Wyoming, and Nevada due to regulatory considerations. Another example is Companies Incorporated, which has shelf corporations in several states in the United States as well as offshore companies.

Carhart, 530 U.S. 914 (2000), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court dealing with a Nebraska law which made performing \\"partial-birth abortion\\" illegal, without regard for the health of the mother.. Nebraska physicians who performed the procedure contrary to the law were subject to having their medical licenses revoked. The Court struck down the law, finding the Nebraska statute criminalizing \\"partial birth abortion[s]\\" violated the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, as interpreted in Planned Parenthood v. Casey and Roe v. Wade. The Court would later uphold a similar, albeit federal statute in Gonzales v. Carhart (2007). History LeRoy Carhart, a Nebraska physician who specialized in late-term abortions, brought suit against Don Stenberg, the Attorney General of Nebraska, seeking declaratory judgment that a state law banning certain forms of abortion was unconstitutional, based on the undue burden test mentioned by a dissenting opinion in Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health. and by the Court in Planned Parenthood v. Casey.. Both a federal district court and the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Carhart before the case was appealed to the Supreme Court. The Nebraska statute prohibited \\"partial birth abortion\\", which it defined as any abortion in which the physician \\"partially delivers vaginally a living unborn child before killing the unborn child and completing the delivery.\\" The most common type of abortion performed is suction- aspiration abortion which consists of a vacuum tube inserted into the uterus; others consist of what is known as \\"D&E;\\" (dilation and evacuation), which is usually used during the second trimester because of the increased size of the fetus. The procedure dilates the cervix, dismembers the fetus, and then removes the body parts with non-vacuum instruments, and, in some cases, uses curettage inside the uterus so that the remaining fetus can be evacuated. Dr. Carhart wanted to use a modified version of this called \\"D&X;\\" (Dilation and Extraction), which, rather than commencing curettage inside the uterus, extracts part of the fetus first and then begins the process of dismemberment. Carhart stated that he wanted to perform this procedure because he believed it would be safer and would involve fewer risks for the women; it lowered the risk of leaving potentially harmful fetal tissue in the uterus, and it minimized the number of instruments physicians needed to use. Experts in fetal development provide markedly different assessments of the kind and degree of pain (if any) experienced by the fetus (see Fetal pain). Although in the second and third trimesters the nervous system is largely in place, the level of consciousness or awareness of the fetus is a matter of debate. Experiments aimed at measuring fetal pain have yielded results that are somewhat open to interpretation, given that measurable reactions of the fetus to stimuli may not correspond directly to an adult experience of pain. The medical and scientific questions surrounding partial-birth abortion are impacted in the public arena by political and special interest considerations, resulting in a certain degree of media hype surrounding this case. Proponents of abortion rights on the one hand and the right-to-life on the other both decry what they describe as myths regarding this procedure that have passed into mainstream American debate on the issue. U.S. Supreme Court ruling The case was argued in 2000. The first issue was the lack of an exception for the woman's health. The state of Nebraska took the position that D&X; abortions were never medically necessary, meaning that an exception was not needed. Secondly, it was inquired on whether or not the law could be construed to apply to other forms of abortion, in which case it would violate the \\"right to privacy\\" interpreted from the Constitution, as described in the Roe and Casey decisions. The law had never been certified to the Supreme Court of Nebraska, as it had been challenged two days after the law was passed. =Opinion of the court and concurring opinions= Justice Stephen Breyer, in writing the opinion of the Court, cited Planned Parenthood v. Casey and said that any abortion law that imposed an undue burden on a woman's \\"right to choose\\" (right to abortion) was unconstitutional. He said that causing those who procure abortions to \\"fear prosecution, conviction, and imprisonment\\" was an undue burden, and therefore declared the law to be against the Constitution. Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David Souter, and Sandra Day O'Connor all agreed that the law was unconstitutional, but Ginsburg wrote a separate opinion, as did O'Connor. Ginsburg stated plainly that a state could not force physicians to use procedures other than what they felt in their own judgment to be the safest, that this was part of the \\"life and liberty\\" protected under the Constitution. O'Connor agreed, saying that any such procedural law would have to be applied only to prevent unnecessary partial- birth abortions, and would have to include an exception for the health of the woman (as this law did not). Justice Stevens also filed a separate opinion. He noted that government had no right to force doctors to perform any procedure other than what they felt would be the safest. =Dissents= Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented. Kennedy claimed this type of law was allowed by their ruling in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which allowed laws to preserve prenatal life to a certain extent. He called Sandra Day O'Connor's opinion a \\"repudiation\\" of the understandings and assurances given in Casey. Justice Kennedy also detailed what he deemed a constitutionally protected alternative to partial-birth abortion. In a short separate opinion, Chief Justice Rehnquist stated that he did not join Casey but felt that Justice Kennedy had applied its precedent correctly, and thus joined his opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas read his dissent from the bench when the decision was announced, stating that abortion was not a right contained in the Constitution, and sharply criticized the majority and concurring opinions. Chief Justice William Rehnquist, along with Antonin Scalia, and Thomas had consistently said that they did not believe abortion is a protected right, and had pointed out that \\"privacy\\" is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. Thomas also pointed out in his dissenting opinion that even if abortion was a woman's right, the law in question was not designed to strike at the right itself. He reminded the others that many groups, including the American Medical Association, had concluded that partial-birth abortion was very different from other forms of abortion, and was often considered infanticide. Thomas further noted that the gruesome nature of some partial-birth abortions has caused personal trauma in the doctors performing them. In his dissent, Justice Scalia recalled his prior dissent in Casey in which he had criticized the undue burden standard as \\"doubtful in application as it is unprincipled in origin.\\" What constitutes an undue burden is a value judgment, argued Scalia; it should therefore be no surprise that the Court split on whether the Nebraska statute constitutes an undue burden. Scalia moreover chastised Kennedy for feeling betrayed by the majority. Scalia declared that the Stenberg decision was not \\"a regrettable misapplication of Casey,\\"--as Kennedy claimed--but \\"Casey's logical and entirely predictable consequence\\". Denouncing the undue burden standard of Casey as illegitimate, Scalia called for Casey to be overruled. Effects of the decision By a 5-4 majority, the Nebraska law was struck down, as were all other state laws banning partial-birth abortion. In 2003, however, the federal government enacted a Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. This law did not include an exception for the health of the woman, as Justice O'Connor said it must. Congress inserted findings into the law saying that the procedure is never needed to protect maternal health. Although several federal judges struck down this federal law, citing the precedent of Stenberg v. Carhart, it was eventually upheld by the Supreme Court in Gonzales v. Carhart. The Supreme Court's decision in Gonzales v. Carhart concerns similar questions as those in Stenberg, but this time in the context of a federal statute. The decision in Gonzales v. Carhart has narrowed the holding in this case; the cases are largely indistinguishable and can be explained only by the replacement of Justice O'Connor with Justice Samuel Alito, who voted to uphold the law.

It is located on the west bank of Hooghly River, Belur, West Bengal, India and is one of the significant institutions in Kolkata. This temple is the heart of the Ramakrishna Movement. The temple is notable for its architecture that fuses Christian, Islamic, Hindu and Buddhist art motifs as a symbol of unity of all religions. In 2003 Belur Math railway station was also inaugurated which is dedicated to Belur Math Temple. Belur Math from Ratan Babu Ghat  History  In January 1897, Swami Vivekananda arrived in Baranagar, Calcutta with his small group of Western disciples. Two monasteries were founded by him, one at Belur, which became the headquarters of Ramakrishna Mission and the other at Mayavati on the Himalayas, in Champawat District, Uttrakhand, called the Advaita Ashrama. These monasteries were meant to receive and train young men who would eventually become sannyasis (religious ascetic) of the Ramakrishna Mission, and to give them a training for their work. The same year the philanthropic activity was started and relief of the famine was carried out. Swami Vivekananda's days as a parivrajaka (wandering monk) before his visit to Parliament of Religions, took him through many parts of India and he visited several architectural monuments like the Taj Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri palaces, Diwan‚ÄìI‚ÄìKhas, palaces of Rajasthan, ancient temples of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and other places. During his tour in America and Europe, he came across buildings of architectural importance of Modern, Medieval, Gothic and Renaissance styles. It is reported that Vivekananda incorporated these ideas in the design of the Belur Math temple. Swami Vijnanananda, a brother-monk of Swami Vivekananda and one of the monastic disciples of Ramakrishna, who was, in his pre-monastic life, a civil engineer, designed the temple according to the ideas of Vivekananda and Swami Shivananda, the then President of Belur Math laid the foundation stone on 16 May 1935. The massive construction was handled by Martin Burn & Co.. The mission proclaims the Belur Math as, \\"A Symphony in Architecture\\".

The campus also houses a Museum containing articles connected with the history of Ramakrishna Math and Mission. Several educational institutions affiliated with the Ramakrishna Mission are situated in the vast campus adjacent to Belur Math. The Belur Math is considered as one of the prime tourist spots near Kolkata and place of pilgrimage by devotees. The ex-president APJ Abdul Kalam regarded Belur Math as a \\"place of heritage and national importance.\\" = Sri Ramakrishna Temple = thumbright The marble statue of Ramakrishna at Belur Math The design of the temple was envisioned by Swami Vivekananda and the architect was Swami Vijnanananda, a direct monastic disciple of Ramakrishna. Sri Ramakrishna Temple was consecrated on 14 January, the Makar Sankranti Day in 1938. The Ramakrishna temple at the Belur Math is designed to \\"celebrate the diversity of Indian Religions\\"Dutta(2003) p.104 and resembles a temple, a mosque, a church if seen from different positions. The architectural style and symbolism from a number of religions have been incorporated into the design of the temple at Belur Math, to convey the \\"universal faith\\" in which the movement believes. The temple is considered as a prime example of the importance of \\"material dimension\\" of religion. The main entrance of the temple, has a facade influenced by Buddhist styles in the Buddhist stupa at Sanchi & the main entrance of the Ajanta Caves.The structure which rises over the entrance is modelled on the Hindu temples of South India with their lofty towers. The windows and balconies inside the temple draw upon the Rajput (Hindu) and Mughal (Islamic) style of north India. The central dome is derived from the Renaissance architecture of the Duomo of the Florence Cathedral. The ground plan is in the shape of Christian cross. The height of the temple is and covers a total area of . The temple mainly is built of chunar stone and some portion in the front is of cement. The high entrance of the temple is like a South Indian Gopuram and the pillars on both sides represent Buddhistic architectural style.

Swami Vivekanda's Samadhi at Belur Math on the shore of Hugli river at Howrah, where swami's ash was placed. The Swami Vivekananda Temple stands on the spot where Swami Vivekananda‚Äôs mortal remains were cremated in 1902. Consecrated on 28 January 1924, the temple has in its upper storey an alabaster OM (in Bengali characters). Beside the temple stands a bel (bilva) tree in the place of the original bel tree under which Swami Vivekananda used to sit and near which, according to his wish, his body was cremated. On 4 July 1902 at Belur Math, he taught Vedanta philosophy to some pupils in the morning. He had a walk with Swami Premananda, a brother-disciple, and gave him instructions concerning the future of the Ramakrishna Math. He left his body (died) in the evening after a session of prayer at Belur Math. He was 39. Vivekananda had fulfilled his own prophecy of not living to be forty-years old. = Holy Mother's temple = The Holy Mother's temple is dedicated to Sarada Devi, the spiritual consort of Ramakrishna.The holy mother's temple is right at the entrance of Belur Math . The temple is over the area where her mortal remains were consigned to flames. The temple of the Holy Mother was consecrated on 21 December 1921. = Swami Brahmananda's temple = Another temple dedicated to Swami Brahmananda‚Äîa direct disciple of Ramakrishna and the first president of the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission‚Äîis situated near Holy Mother's temple. = Ramakrishna Museum = The famed, two-storey Ramakrishna Museum hosts artifacts used by Ramakrishna, Sarada Devi, Swami Vivekananda, and some of his disciples. These include the long coat worn by Vivekananda in the West, Sister Nivedita's table, and an organ of Mrs Sevier's. The museum chronicles the contemporary growth of the movement, and the Bengalese. The museum has a realistic recreation of the Panchavati ‚Äî the clutch of five sacred trees of the Dakshineswar Kali Temple where Ramakrishna practised sadhana (spiritual disciplines). The black stone bowl from which Ramakrishna took payasam (a sweet Indian dish) during his final days, while suffering from throat cancer, and the pillow he had used, in the house in Calcutta where he spent his last few months, are on display. Ramakrishna's room in the house, where he distributed ochre clothes to 12 disciples anointing Vivekananda (then Narendranath) as their leader, has also been shown with a model of Ramakrishna bestowing grace on his disciples, and the footwear used by Ramakrishna has been put on the model. The room at Dakshineswar where Ramakrishna lived has been recreated with display of clothes and other objects used by him, the tanpura used by Vivekananda to sing to his master, and the copies of two charcoal drawings sketched by Ramakrishna are on display. Sarada Devi's pilgrimage to Chennai, Madurai and Bangalore has also been exhibited, along with items used by her then, in 1911. The museum showcases a huge replica of Swami Vivekananda in the front of the Chicago Art Institute, where the famous Parliament of the World's Religions was held in September 1893. Alongside the same display, is a letter by Jamsetji Tata, Swami Vivekananda's co-passenger on the trip, that reveals an important and well-known work of Tata's, which was inspired by Swamiji: the founding of the Indian Institute of Science at Bangalore. The wooden staircase and the lotus woodwork of Victoria Public Hall in Chennai, where Vivekananda gave inspiring speeches to a large congregation, have been brought over. A few displays away from this is a show on Miss Josephine MacLeod, who met Swamji in the U.S. in 1895 and served India for 40 years thereafter. She played an important role in the Ramakrishna movement. At this enclosure is a crystal image of Swamiji that was done by Paris jeweler Ren√© Lalique.  Activities  The Belur Math conducts medical service, education, work for women, rural uplift and work among the labouring and backward classes, relief, spiritual and cultural activities. The center also celebrates annual birthdays of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Sarada Devi and other monastic disciples. The annual celebrations of Kumari Puja and Durga Puja are one of the main attractions. The tradition of Kumari puja was started by Vivekananda in 1901.

II c. 11), the long title of which is \\"An Act of Free and General Pardon, Indemnity, and Oblivion\\".Charles II, 1660: An Act of Free and Generall Pardon Indemnity and Oblivion., Statutes of the Realm: volume 5: 1628‚Äì80 (1819), pp. 226‚Äì34. British History Online, Date. Retrieved 27 February 2007. This act was a general pardon for everyone who had committed crimes during the Civil War and Interregnum with the exception of certain crimes such as murder (without a licence granted by King or Parliament), piracy, buggery, rape and witchcraft, and people named in the act such as those involved in the regicide of Charles I. It also said that no action was to be taken against those involved at any later time, and that the Interregnum was to be legally forgotten.An act of free and general pardon, indemnity and oblivion History The Indemnity and Oblivion Act fulfilled the suggestion given in the Declaration of Breda that reprisals against the establishment which had developed during the English Interregnum would be restricted to those who had officiated in the regicide of King Charles I. The passage of the Indemnity and Oblivion Act through the Convention Parliament was secured by Lord Clarendon, the first minister of King Charles II, and it became law on 29 August 1660 during the first year of the English Restoration. The lands of the Crown and the established Church were automatically restored, but lands of Royalists and other dissenters confiscated and sold during the Civil War and interregnum were left for private negotiation or litigation, meaning that the government would not help the Loyalists in regaining their property. Disappointed Royalists commented that the Act meant \\"indemnity for [Charles'] enemies and oblivion for his friends\\". Historians, on the other hand, have generally praised the King and Clarendon for the generosity and clemency of the Act, in an age not normally noted for mercy.Kenyon, J.P. The Stuart Constitution 2nd Edition Cambridge University Press 1986 p.336 Twenty years later, during the Popish Plot, Charles tried unsuccessfully to stand against the relentless demand for the execution of Catholic priests, and reminded the public sharply of how many of them had previously benefited from his reluctance to shed blood.Kenyon, J.P. The Popish Plot Phoenix Press Reissue 2000 pp. 174‚Äì5 The act is often viewed from the perspective of those who were not pardoned and thus condemned to death. However, the debate in Parliament continued almost every day for over two months and names were added and taken off the list of those who were not to be pardoned. Initially there were only seven on the list:House of Commons Journal Volume 8, 5 June 1660, Proceedings against Regicides That the Seven Persons who, by former Order, are to be excepted out of the Act of general Pardon for Life and Estate, be named here in this House. Resolved, That Thomas Harrison be one of the Seven Persons.House of Commons Journal Volume 8, 5 June 1660. Thomas Harrison, William Say, John Jones Maesygarnedd, Thomas Scot, John Lisle, Cornelius Holland, and John Barkstead. On 7 June, the Commons, mindful of the Declaration of Breda, stated they as the Commons could add to the list others who would not be covered by the general pardon. They immediately added John Cooke, Andrew Broughton, Edward Dendy, and the \\"Two Persons who were upon the Scaffold in a Disguise\\" (i.e. the executioners).House of Commons Journal Volume 8, 7 June 1660 On 8 June, the Commons voted \\"That the Number of Twenty, and no more, (other than those that are already excepted, or sat as Judges upon the late King's Majesty) shall be excepted out of the Act of general Pardon and Oblivion, for and in respect only of such Pains, Penalties, and Forfeitures, (not extending to Life) as shall be thought fit to be inflicted on them by another Act, intended to be hereafter passed for that purpose\\".House of Commons Journal Volume 8, 8 June 1660 House of Commons Journal Volume 8, 8 June 1660 The twenty who punishment did not extend to life were added to the list.

His father was Ikoma Chikashige. Chikamasa was appointed one of the three ch≈´r≈ç (arbiters) by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Career In 1566, he became a retainer of Oda Nobunaga when he attacked Mino Province. He worked under Hashiba Hideyoshi (Toyotomi Hideyoshi) from then on, and was involved in various battles such as the Battle of Nagashino, the battle against Ishiyama Hongan-ji and the battle against the Saika party at Kii Province. In 1582, he served Hideyoshi after Nobunaga died, and was active in several battles such as the Battle of Yamazaki, the Battle of Shizugatake, the Siege of Odawara, and the Battle of Bunroku. He was given lands in Sanuki Province yielding 171,800 koku of rice because of his service. In Hideyoshi's last years, Ikoma Chikamasa, Nakamura Kazuuji, and Horio Yoshiharu were appointed to the position of ch≈´r≈ç under Toyotomi. In 1600 at the Battle of Sekigahara, Chikamasa was part of Ishida Mitsunari's force while his son, Ikoma Kazumasa was part of Tokugawa Ieyasu's force. Chikamasa remained at Sanuki and sent his retainers in his stead to attack Tanabe castle in Tango Province. He chose this strategy to preserve the Ikoma clan regardless of which side prevailed. Because Kazumasa fought in Ieyasu's force, Ieyasu allowed Chikamasa to rule his existing domain after the battle, but Chikamasa took responsibility for fighting on the losing side by transferring the headship of the family to Kazumasa. He became a priest and withdrew to Mount K≈çya. He was soon permitted to return to Sanuki Province. In 1603, he died in Takamatsu castle.

According to pro-Chalcedon sources, after Proterius of Alexandria, has been installed as patriarch after the Council of Chalcedon, he was murdered at Timothy's instigation at the baptistery during Easter,Philip Jenkins,Jesus Wars (2010) pp 222 . In the Anti-Chalcedon Sources, Proterius was murdered on the order of the Byzantine General in Charge of Egypt after a heated exchange http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/zachariah04.htm In 460, the Emperor expelled him from Alexandria and installed the Chalcedonian Timothy III Salophakiolos as patriarch. An uprising in 475 again brought Timothy II back to Alexandria, where he ruled as patriarch until his death.

Studdy Bonzo, on a postcard George Ernest Studdy (Devonport, 23 June 1878 ‚Äì 25 July 1948) was a British commercial artist. He is best remembered for his creation of Bonzo the dog, a fictional character in the early 1920s that first appeared in The Sketch Magazine. Biography Studdy was born on 23 June 1878, in Devonport, Devon, England. He was the second of three children of Ernest and Constance Studdy. His father was a lieutenant in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. During his childhood, his foot was accidentally pierced by a pitchfork, which later prevented him from following his father into the army. He pursued his education at Clifton College, Bristol, and then Dulwich College in London while living with his aunt. He left the College and England in the summer of 1896. He worked as a stockbroker with the Thames Iron Works. He had always dreamed of going back to school, so with ¬£100 given to him from his aunt, he attended night classes at the Heatherley School of Fine Art in London to study drawing as well as studying animal anatomy at Calderon's Animal School. After art school, he shared a studio with several friends from art school while working to complete a portfolio. He was able to sell a few of his sketches to local newspapers and magazines. A few newspapers later commissioned Studdy to draw action scenes to go along with articles on the Boer War. In 1900, as Studdy's sketches started to gain popularity, Comic Cuts, Boys Own Weekly and Pick-Me-Up began to publish Studdy's sketches regularly. It was about this time that he started his long relationship with Valentine & Sons postcards of Dundee. One of the first set they published was a series of six sketches called \\"The Evolution of the Motor Car\\".(Fitzpatrick) In 1912, Studdy married Blanche Landrin. That same year he signed a contract with The Sketch to produce a weekly full-page drawing.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/studdy_george.htm When war broke out, he was commissioned by Gaumont to produce a series of short films called Studdy‚Äôs War Studies. Studdy later introduced Bonzo into his sketches. His Bonzo character was a chubby little white pup with sparse black spots, a stubby tail, and big blue eyes. Bonzo became the inspiration for much commercial merchandise, such as cuddly and mechanical toys, ashtrays, pincushions, trinket boxes, car mascots, jigsaw puzzles, books, calendars, candies, and a profusion of postcards. Bonzo's massive popularity allowed Studdy and his wife to live a very comfortable life until he died in 1948.(Fitzpatrick)http://www.bonzo.me.uk/bio.htmhttps://illustrationchronicles.com/George- Studdy-s-Bonzo-Bonanza-Tales-of-a-Superstar- Doghttp://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/541044/index.html References  External links *George Studdy and Bonzo Dog reference website *G.

Life Four different sources speak of Saint Apollonius of Rome: *a record of the trial incorporated into the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius of Caesarea (265-340); *chapters 40 and 42 of the De Viris Illustribus by Saint Jerome (347-420), *two versions of the Passio of Apollonius, one Greek, the other Armenian, which were discovered in the late 19th century.Enciclopedia dei Santi: Sant'Apollonio di Roma These sources present Apollonius as an illustrious Roman, even, it seems, a senator, and an exceedingly talented man, well versed in philosophy. He was denounced as a Christian to the Pretorian Prefect Perennius. Summoned to defend himself, he read to the senate, according to Saint Jerome, \\"a remarkable volume\\" in which, instead of recanting, he defended the Christian faith. As a result, he was condemned to death on the basis of the law established by the Emperor Trajan. The sources say he was subjected to two investigations, the first by the Prefect Perennius, the second, three days later, by a group of senators and jurists. The hearings were conducted in a calm and courteous manner. Apollonius was permitted to speak with only rare interruptions, aimed at getting him to tone down his remarks, which were making him liable to punishment. Apollonius was not afraid to die, because, he said: \\"There is waiting for me something better: eternal life, given to the person who has lived well on earth.\\" And he argued for the superiority of Christianity's concepts of death and life. The sources disagree on the manner of his death. The Greek Passio says he died after having his legs crushed, a punishment inflicted also on the slave who denounced him; but in the Armenian account he is decapitated. Veneration Apollonius was not mentioned in the earliest Christian martyrologies, not being at first the object of individual commemoration. In the Middle Ages he was confused with two other saints, Apollo of Alexandria and the Apollonius who was martyred with Saint Valentine and whose feast is on 18 April. As a result, this date was attributed also to Saint Apollonius of Rome, even in editions of the Roman Martyrology, the latest editions of which have, however, restored the date of 21 April. The account in the Roman Martyrology (21 April) is as follows: :At Rome, commemoration of Saint Apollonius, philosopher and martyr. Under the Emperor Commodus, he defended, before the Prefect Perennius and the Senate, the cause of the Christian faith in a finely argued address, and then, after being condemned to death, confirmed it by the witness of his blood.Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 88-209-7210-7). Earlier editions of the Roman Martyrology had, under 18 April, the following text: :At Rome, blessed Apollonius, a senator under Emperor Commodus and the prefect Perennius. He was denounced as a Christian by one of his slaves, and being commanded to give an account of his faith, he composed an able work which he read in the Senate. He was nevertheless beheaded for Christ by their sentence.

Typically, a talk box directs sound from the instrument into the musician's mouth by means of a plastic tube adjacent to their vocal microphone. The musician controls the modification of the instrument's sound by changing the shape of the mouth, \\"vocalizing\\" the instrument's output into a microphone. Overview A musician using a talk box A talk box is usually an effects pedal that sits on the floor and contains a speaker attached with an airtight connection to a plastic tube; however, it can come in other forms, including homemade, usually crude, versions, and higher quality custom-made versions. The speaker is generally in the form of a compression driver, the sound-generating part of a horn loudspeaker with the horn replaced by the tube connection. The box has connectors for the connection to the speaker output of an instrument amplifier and a connection to a normal instrument speaker. A foot-operated switch on the box directs the sound either to the talk box speaker or to the normal speaker. The switch is usually a push-on/push-off type. The other end of the tube is taped to the side of a microphone, extending enough to direct the reproduced sound in or near the performer's mouth. When activated, the sound from the amplifier is reproduced by the speaker in the talk box and directed through the tube into the performer's mouth. The shape of the mouth filters the sound, with the modified sound being picked up by the microphone. The shape of the mouth changes the harmonic content of the sound in the same way it affects the harmonic content generated by the vocal folds when speaking. The performer can vary the shape of the mouth and position of the tongue, changing the sound of the instrument being reproduced by the talk box speaker. The performer can mouth words, with the resulting effect sounding as though the instrument is speaking. This \\"shaped\\" sound exits the performer's mouth, and when it enters a microphone, an instrument/voice hybrid is heard. The sound can be that of any musical instrument, but the effect is most commonly associated with the guitar. The rich harmonics of an electric guitar are shaped by the mouth, producing a sound very similar to voice, effectively allowing the guitar to appear to \\"speak.\\" The effect produced by talk boxes and vocoders are often conflated by listeners. However, they have radically different mechanisms for achieving the effect. Talk boxes send the carrier signal into the singer's mouth, where it is then modulated by the singer themselves. On the other hand, vocoders process both the carrier and the modulator signal integrally, producing the output as a separate electric signal. In addition, they are also more common in different genres: a talk box is often found in rock music due to its typical pairing with a guitar, whereas vocoders are almost always paired with synthesizers, and as such, are ubiquitous in electronic music. History =Singing guitar= In 1939, Alvino Rey, amateur radio operator W6UK, used a carbon throat microphone wired in such a way as to modulate his electric steel guitar sound. The mic, originally developed for military pilot communications, was placed on the throat of Rey's wife Luise King (one of The King Sisters), who stood behind a curtain and mouthed the words, along with the guitar lines. The novel-sounding combination was called \\"Singing Guitar\\", and employed on stage and in the movie Jam Session, as a \\"novelty\\" attraction, but was not developed further. Rey also created a somewhat similar \\"talking\\" effect by manipulating the tone controls of his Fender electric guitar, but the vocal effect was less pronounced.ProSoundWeb. Forum: Recording Engineering & Production. Thread: JUNE is \\"Ask Bob Heil\\" Month! Message: 347458. Bob Heil responds about the origin of the Talk Box. Posted June 6, 2008 =Sonovox= Another early voice effect using the same principle of the throat as a filter was the Sonovox, invented by Gilbert Wright in 1939. Instead of a throat microphone modulating a guitar signal, it used small transducers attached to the performer's throat to pick up voice sounds. The Sonovox was marketed and promoted by the Wright-Sonovox company, an affiliate of the Free & Peters advertising agency. The Sonovox was used in many radio station IDs and jingles produced by JAM Creative Productions and the PAMS advertising agency of Dallas, Texas. Lucille Ball made one of her earliest film appearances during the 1930s in a Path√© Newsreel demonstrating the Sonovox. The first use in music was a score by Ernst Toch in the Paramount Picture \\"The Ghost Breakers\\", in June 1940.Letter from Gilbert Wright to Melville Clark, 28 April 1940. The Sonovox also appeared in the 1940 film You'll Find Out starring Kay Kyser and his orchestra, Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, and Peter Lorre. Lugosi uses the Sonovox to portray the voice of a dead person during a seance. The Sonovox was used in films such as A Letter to Three Wives (1949), Possessed (1947), The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947), The Good Humor Man (1950), the voice of Casey Junior the train in Dumbo (1941) and The Reluctant Dragon (1941). It was heard on the piano in Sparky's Magic Piano, and the airplane in Whizzer The Talking Airplane (1947). The Sonovox was also used to give the impression instruments \\"talking\\" in the children's album Rusty in Orchestraville (1949). British rock band The Who included a piece on their 1967 album, The Who Sell Out, that consisted of the days of the week \\"spoken\\" by electric guitar chords using the Sonovox. This recording was in fact a radio jingle created by PAMS. =Talking steel guitar= Pete Drake, a Nashville-based player of the pedal steel guitar, used a talk box on his 1964 album Forever, in what came to be called his \\"talking steel guitar\\". The following year Gallant released three albums with the box, Pete Drake & His Talking Guitar, Talking Steel and Singing Strings, and Talking Steel Guitar.REVIEW: Adams, Greg. [ Forever] @ Allmusic Drake's device consisted of an 8-inch paper cone speaker driver attached to a funnel from which a clear tube brought the sound to the performer's mouth. It was only loud enough to be useful in the recording studio. Another prominent use of the talking steel guitar appears in The Ventures' Christmas Album, released in 1965. In the song \\"Silver Bells\\", Red Rhodes spoke through a talk box, distorting the phrase silver bells. =Kustom Electronics Talk Box (The Bag)= The Kustom Electronics device, \\"The Bag,\\" was the first mass market talk box and was housed in a decorative bag slung over the shoulder like a wine bottle. It used a 30-watt driver and was released to the mass music market in early 1969, two years before Bob Heil's Talk Box became widely available. The Bag is claimed to have been designed by Doug Forbes, who states that exactly the same concept (speaker attached to a plastic tube and inserted into the mouth) had previously been patented as an artificial larynx. John Kay of Steppenwolf used the Kustom Electronics Talk Box (The Bag) in studio recordings and live performances beginning in 1969. On the album Steppenwolf Live recorded in January 1970, the Kustom Bag talk box can clearly be heard on the tracks \\"From Here To There Eventually\\", \\"Hey Lawdy Mama\\" and \\"Twisted\\". Kay was observed using a Kustom Electronics talk box on stage in Charlotte, North Carolina in June 1970 and at two shows in New Jersey (Wildwood and Cherry Hill) in 1971. Steppenwolf appeared on the live music TV shows The Midnight Special and Don Kirshner's Rock Concert and lead guitarist Bobby Cochran as well as John Kay used the Kustom Bag. Two other early examples of a Kustom Electronics talk box being used on studio recordings are Sly and the Family Stone's \\"Sex Machine\\" from their album Stand! and Al Kooper with Shuggie Otis' \\"One Room Country Shack\\" from their album Kooper Session, both released in 1969. The band Iron Butterfly used a talk box in the song \\"Butterfly Bleu\\" from the album Metamorphosis in 1970. Alvin Lee used a talk box for the Ten Years After song \\"I Say Yeah\\" from the album Watt in 1970. Young-Holt Unlimited featured a talk box on their song \\"Wah-Wah Man\\", also released in 1970, on the album Born Again. Stevie Wonder first used a talk box on his album Music of My Mind in early 1972. The Osmonds used a talk box on their 1972 track \\"Hold Her Tight.\\" John Renbourn used a talk box on the song \\"Back on the Road Again\\" in 1972 on his \\"Faro Annie\\" album. The Crusaders featured a talk box on the album \\"Southern Comfort\\" in 1974 ‚Äì notably on the song \\"Greasy Spoon\\". Jeff Beck used the Kustom Bag talk box on \\"She's A Woman\\" from his 1975 release Blow by Blow, and was seen using it for the song on BBC television program \\"Five Faces of the Guitar\\" in 1974 in which he also explains its use to the host of the show. =Heil High-Powered Talk Box= The first high-powered Talk Box was developed by Bob Heil. Heil came up with the first high-powered Talk Box that could be reliable when used on high-level rock stages. His first Heil Talk Box was built for Joe Walsh's Barnstorm tour. Heil and Walsh, both avid ham radio operators (K9EID and WB6ACU, respectively), along with Walsh's guitar tech \\"Krinkle\\", combined a 250-watt JBL driver and suitable hi-pass filter which was used for Walsh's single \\"Rocky Mountain Way\\". Walsh gives credit to Bill West, an electrical engineer, Nashville steel guitarist and first husband of country-music legend Dottie West, for inventing the talk box for him in a 2006 interview with Howard Stern. Pete Townshend, in his 2012 autobiography Who I Am, claimed to have invented a version of the Talk Box during a Who tour of the US in 1976. \\"I built a speaker in a small box, attached a tube and put the tube in my mouth, allowing me to speak music.\\" In 1988, Heil sold the manufacturing rights to Dunlop Manufacturing, Inc., which currently builds the Heil Talk Box to the exact standards that Heil designed in 1973. The 1974 hit single \\"Tell Me Something Good\\", performed by Rufus and Chaka Khan and written by Stevie Wonder, which peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100, was among the earliest hits to use the guitar talk box. The classic rock artist Peter Framptom made extensive use of the talk box in his music. In an interview for the 1999 DVD Live in Detroit, Peter Frampton says he first heard the talk box in 1970 while sitting in on sessions for George Harrison's All Things Must Pass. While he sat next to Pete Drake in the album sessions at Abbey Road studio, he heard Pete using it with a pedal steel guitar. Frampton said in the same interview that the sound it produced reminded him of an audio effect he loved listening to on Radio Luxembourg in the later 1960s. Frampton acquired one as a Christmas present from Bob Heil in 1974. It was a hand-built Talk Box in a fiberglass box using a 100-watt high-powered driver. This was the Heil Talk Box used for the Frampton Comes Alive tour and album.Lux, Joanna. and David Dayen \\"Peter Frampton: More Alive Than Ever\\" ‚Äì G4 Media ‚Äì Thursday, 13 June 2002Green, Douglas. \\"Pete Drake: everyone's favorite\\" Baron, Josh.\\"I'm In You: Peter Frampton Still Feels Like We Do\\" ‚Äì Relix ‚Äì Monday, 25 October 2004 He then promptly locked himself away in a practice space for two weeks, and came out with some mastery of it. Due to the success of the albums Frampton and Frampton Comes Alive!, and particularly the hit singles \\"Do You Feel Like We Do\\" and \\"Show Me the Way\\", Frampton has become somewhat synonymous with the talk box. Peter Frampton also now sells his own line of custom-designed \\"Framptone\\" products, including a talk box. In 1972 Todd Rundgren used a Talk Box on the album Something/Anything? on the instrumental track, \\"Breathless\\". Over a synthesized background his VCS3 synthesizer repeatedly \\"sings\\" the words \\"I am so breathless\\", which can be taken as a reference to the Talk Box. In 1975, Nazareth lead singer Dan McCafferty used a talk box in the popular single \\"Hair of the Dog\\". Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry used a talk box in the band's highly popular songs \\"Sweet Emotion\\" from the album Toys in the Attic and the live version of \\"Walk This Way\\" from the album Live! Bootleg. He also used it in the theme song from the Spider-Man 90's cartoon. In 1976, Steely Dan guitarist Walter Becker recorded the talk box effect atop an already- recorded Dean Parks solo in \\"Haitian Divorce\\", on the album The Royal Scam. It was also used in a solo section of \\"East St. Louis Toodle-Oo\\", on Steely Dan's 1974 album Pretzel Logic. Ronnie Montrose used a talk box on the title track from his 1976 album Jump On It. Also in 1976, the band Ruby (featuring Tom Fogerty) used a talk box on the track \\"Running Back To Me\\". David Gilmour of Pink Floyd used the talk box on \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" from their 1977 Animals album, and on \\"Keep Talking\\" from 1994's The Division Bell. The band Stillwater used a talkbox on their song \\"Mind Bender\\" in 1977. Also from 1977, Johnnie \\"Guitar\\" Watson used talk box and the Meters used one on their track \\"Funkify Your Life\\". Roger Troutman, lead singer of the R&B; group Zapp, used the talk box (first with a Minimoog synthesizer, and later a Yamaha DX100) on the group's first hit single in 1980, \\"More Bounce to the Ounce\\", and in numerous other songs including Tupac Shakur's \\"California Love\\". Matthias Jabs, lead guitarist for Scorpions, has used the talk box in many of their songs, most notably the 1980 song \\"The Zoo\\". Joe Walsh used a talk box in the song \\"Space Age Whiz Kids\\" on the 1983 album You Bought It You Name It, in \\"I Broke My Leg\\" on the 1985 album The Confessor, and also in \\"Half of the Time\\" on the 1987 album Got Any Gum?. Walsh, along with Don Felder, did a dual talk box guitar solo in the song \\"Those Shoes\\" from their 1979 album, The Long Run. The 1986 Daryl Hall hit \\" Foolish Pride\\" features the talk box played by English guitarist Richard Morcombe. Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora used the Heil Talk box in many of the band's songs, including 1986's \\"Livin' on a Prayer\\" from Slippery When Wet, 2000's \\"It's My Life\\" from Crush, 2002's \\"Everyday\\" from Bounce, 2007's \\"We Got it Goin' On\\" (Lost Highway) and 2009's \\"Bullet\\" (The Circle). Lead guitarist Slash of the hard rock band Guns N' Roses used a talk box in \\"Anything Goes\\" off their album Appetite for Destruction, released in 1987, and in \\"Dust and Bones\\", from their following record, Use Your Illusion I. M√∂tley Cr√ºe's Mick Mars used a talk box in \\"Kickstart My Heart\\" off their 1989 release, Dr. Feelgood. NJS musician Teddy Riley used talk box also. Brian May was asked in an interview whether the song \\"Delilah\\" was recorded using a talk box on Queen's 1991 Innuendo record. May answered: \\"Yes, I finally succumbed and used one ... I suppose there‚Äôs no other way to make the meow sounds, meow, meow, meow.\\" Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine used a talk box on their song \\"Wake Up\\" in 1992. Bob Hartman, from Petra, used the talk box during the 1993 song \\"Underneath the Blood\\", from their Wake-Up Call album. Metallica used a talk box during the solo on \\"The House Jack Built\\", from the 1996 album Load. The Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl used a talk box during their song \\"Generator\\" off their 1999 release, There Is Nothing Left To Lose; his use of the device was partly inspired by Grohl's admiration of Peter Frampton and Joe Walsh. Dream Theater guitarist John Petrucci used the talk box for live performances of the song \\"Home\\", from the band's 1999 album Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory. Avenged Sevenfold vocalist M. Shadows used a talk box in their song \\"Lost\\" off their 2007 self-titled album, Avenged Sevenfold. In Godsmack's cover of the Joe Walsh song \\"Rocky Mountain Way\\", frontman Sully Erna used a talk box. Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains, Adam Jones of Tool, Slash, the Eagles, Chromeo, plus dozens of other groups continue to keep the Heil Talk Box in their song sets. The talk box was used in Elton John's 1975 album Rock of the Westies, on the song \\"Dan Dare (Pilot of the Future)\\", as played by Davey Johnstone. =ElectroSpit= Producer Bosko, who played talk box on Big Boi's 2010 album Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty, conceived an alternative to the cumbersome and unsanitary talk box in mid-2014, imagining a neck-worn electronic system that would be easier to use. Bosko showed the ElectroSpit prototype in 2016, and launched a Kickstarter campaign in June 2018.https://medium.com/kickstarter/reinventing-instruments-winning-a-grammy- and-beating-the-odds-artiphon-and-electrospit- creators-f08d93e03f68https://newatlas.com/electrospit-esx1-mobile- talkbox/55099/ The device sends sound into the mouth by way of electromagnetic transducers placed against the throat, allowing the user to shape the sounds of a synthesizer, guitar or any other electronic source.

He began writing it in 1948, but it was not quite complete when he died in 1955 (with reputedly many portions having been written in the home of his friend Frances Wickes).http://rs5.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/2010/ms010257.pdf It was edited and released posthumously in 1957 by editor David McDowell. Agee's widow and children were left with little money after Agee's death and McDowell wanted to help them by publishing the work. Agee won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1958 for the novel. The novel was included on Time's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. Plot The novel is based on the events that occurred to Agee in 1915 when his father went out of town to see his own father, who had suffered a heart attack. During the return trip, Agee's father was killed in a car accident. The novel provides a portrait of life in Knoxville, Tennessee, showing how such a loss affects the young widow, her two children, her atheist father and the dead man's alcoholic brother. New version University of Tennessee professor Michael Lofaro claimed the version published in 1957 was not the version intended for print by the author. He discussed his work at a conference that was part of the Knoxville James Agee Celebration (April 2005). Lofaro tracked down the author's original manuscripts and notes and has reconstructed a version he says is more authentic. Lofaro's version of the novel, titled A Death in the Family: A Restoration of the Author's Text, was published in 2007 as part of the 10-volume set The Collected Works of James Agee (University of Tennessee Press). Lofaro is also the author of Agee Agonistes: Essays on the Life, Legend, and Works of James Agee (2007). =Differences= According to Lofaro, McDowell altered the original text in a number of ways: *Removed the original opening, a nightmare scene, and instead started the novel with \\"Knoxville: Summer of 1915,\\" a previously published short work of Agee's that was not intended as part of the novel. *Altered the order of the book, which was intended to be chronological. *Some chapters were removed. *Some chapters were chopped up. *Some chapters were moved and presented as flashbacks. *The number of chapters was changed from 44 short chapters to 20. Adaptations The novel was adapted into All the Way Home, a 1961 Pulitzer Prize-winning play by Tad Mosel. The movie All The Way Home (1963) was adapted by Philip H. Reisman, Jr. from the Agee novel and the Mosel play. It was filmed in the same neighborhood where Agee grew up in Knoxville. Produced by David Susskind and directed by Alex Segal, it stars Robert Preston, Jean Simmons and Pat Hingle. A live version of the play aired on television in 1981 starring Sally Field and William Hurt. It was broadcast live on NBC from the Bing Theatre on the campus of the University of Southern California. A TV movie filmed in Tennessee and starring Annabeth Gish, aired on PBS in 2002. Samuel Barber wrote Knoxville: Summer of 1915 (1947, revised 1950) on commission from the American soprano Eleanor Steber, who had asked for a work for soprano with orchestra.

As a producer Costey's credits include Sigur R√≥s, Frank Turner, Muse, Foster the People, Swirlies, Santigold and Biffy Clyro. He has occasionally worked as a DJ and musician on these albums as well. Biography At age 16, Costey became a disc jockey on a local radio station before going on to attend the Berklee College of Music in Boston. While working at Q Division Studios as an assistant, he learned about classic recording techniques and started working with producer Jon Brion whom he credits as an important influence and future collaborator. His first steady gig as a producer was with Boston indie band Swirlies whose repertoire expanded from American shoegaze rock into dance music and electronica under Costey's tutelage. The albums and EPs Costey made with Swirlies helped establish him as a go-to producer for indie bands and brought him to work with Sebadoh, Madder Rose, and Pavement during the 1990s. After college Costey moved to New York City, and in 1995 started working at Philip Glass's Looking Glass studio. Within six months Costey was the facility's head engineer. At the same time, he worked with bands such as Bowery Electric and the Lilys at Michael Deming's Studio 45 in Hartford, Connecticut. After he relocated to Los Angeles, Costey and Brion collaborated on the Fiona Apple track Brion was producing for the soundtrack to Pleasantville as well as contributing a remix of Cheap Trick's \\"Surrender\\" for the Small Soldiers soundtrack. He later engineered and mixed Fiona Apple's album When the Pawn.... His work on the Fiona album attracted the attention of producer Rick Rubin who loved the sound of When The Pawn... and hired Costey to mix Audioslave's 2002 self-titled debut and Rage Against the Machine's 2003 live album, Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium. In 2003, Muse recruited Costey to produce their breakthrough third LP, Absolution. His most recent credits include Foster the People, Birdy, Young the Giant, Chvrches, Phantogram and Kimbra. He also produced Death Cab for Cutie's eighth studio album, Kintsugi, which was released on March 31, 2015. Rich Costey is managed by Lucas Keller and Chelsea Avery at Milk & Honey for the world. Awards In 2008, the Foo Fighters album Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, which Costey mixed, won the award for Best Rock Album at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards. The album also won Best International Album at the 2008 Brit Awards.

He is best known for his controversial work with Edmund Gurney at the Society for Psychical Research, his short films from 1897 to 1903, which pioneered film editing and close-ups, and his development of the first successful colour film process, Kinemacolor.  Biography  = Birth and early life = Smith was born in Cripplegate, London in 1864. His father Charles Smith was a ticket-writer and artist.Hall (1964), p. 92. He moved with his family to Brighton, where his mother ran a boarding house on Grand Parade, following the death of his father. It was in Brighton in the early 1880s that Smith first came to public attention touring the city's performance halls as a stage hypnotist. In 1882 he teamed up with Douglas Blackburn in an act at the Brighton Aquarium involving muscle reading, in which the blindfolded performer identifies objects selected by the audience, and second sight, in which the blindfolded performer finds objects hidden by his assistant somewhere in the theatre.Hall (1964), pp. 92-94. The Society for Psychical Research (SPR) accepted Smith's claims that the act was genuine and after becoming a member of the society he was appointed private secretary to the Honorary Secretary Edmund Gurney from 1883 to 1888. In 1887, Gurney carried out a number of \\"hypnotic experiments\\" in Brighton, with Smith as his \\"hypnotiser\\", which in their day made Gurney an impressive figure to the British public. Since then it has been heavily studied and critiqued by Trevor H. Hall in his study The Strange Case of Edmund Gurney. Hall concluded that Smith (using his stage abilities) faked the results that Gurney trusted in his research papers, and this may have led to Gurney's mysterious death from a narcotic overdose in June 1888. Following Gurney's death, his successors, F. W. H. Myers and Frank Podmore, continued to employ Smith as their private secretary. In 1889, he co- authored (with Henry Sidgwick and Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick) the paper, Experiments in Thought Transference, for the society's journal.Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, volume 6 (1889-90), pp. 128‚Äî70. Blackburn publicly admitted fraud in 1908 and again in 1911,The Daily News, 5 September 1911, cited in Hall (1964), p. 123. although Smith consistently denied it.Hall (1964), pp. 120-123. = At St. Ann's Well Gardens = Smith at work In 1892, after leaving the SPR, he acquired the lease of the St. Ann's Well Gardens in Hove from the estate of financier and philanthropist Sir Isaac Lyon Goldsmid, which he cultivated into a popular pleasure garden, where from 1894 he started staging public exhibitions of hot air ballooning, parachute jumps, a monkey house, a fortune teller, a hermit living in a cave and magic lantern shows of a series of dissolving views.Hall (1964), pp. 169-72. Smith also began to present these dioramic lectures at the Brighton Aquarium, where he had first performed with Douglas Blackburn in 1882. Smith's skilful manipulation of the lantern, cutting between lenses (from slide to slide) to show changes in time, perspective and location necessary for story telling, would allow him to develop many of the skills he would later put to use as a pioneering film maker developing the grammar of film editing. Smith had attended the Lumi√®re programme in Leicester Square in March 1896 and spurred on by the films of Robert Paul, which played in Brighton for that summer season, he and local chemist James Williamson acquired a prototype cine cameras from local engineer Alfred Darling, who had begun to manufacture film equipment after carrying out repairs for Brighton-based film pioneer Esm√© Collings. In 1897, with the technical assistance of Darling and chemicals purchased from Williamson, Smith turned the pump house into a film factory for developing and printing and developed into a successful commercial film processor as well as patenting a camera and projector system of his own. Both he and his neighbour Williamson would go on to become pioneering film makers in their own right creating numerous historic minute-long films. On 29 March 1897, Smith added animated photographs to the end of his twice-daily programme of projected entertainment at the Brighton Aquarium, as an outlet for his burgeoning film production. Many of Smith's early films, including The Miller and the Sweep and Old Man Drinking a Glass of Beer (both filmed in 1897) were comedies thanks to the influence of his wife, Laura Bayley, who had previously acted in pantomime and comic revue. However Smith also corresponded with special effects pioneer Georges M√©li√®s whose influence can be seen in The X-Rays and The Haunted Castle (both 1897) the later of which, along with The Corsican Brothers, Photographing a Ghost and, perhaps his most accomplished work from this time, Santa Claus (all 1898), include special effects created using a process of double-exposure patented by Smith. Many of Smith's films were acquired for distribution by Charles Urban for the Warwick Trading Company and the two began a long business relationship with a joint show of Smith and M√©li√®s' films at the Alhambra Theatre, Brighton in late 1898 and early 1899. In 1899 Smith, with the financial assistance of Urban, constructed a glass house film studio at St. Ann's Well Gardens, ushering in a highly creative period for him as a film maker. That year he shot the single scene The Kiss in the Tunnel (1899) which was then seamlessly edited into Cecil Hepworth's View From an Engine Front - Train Leaving Tunnel (1899) to enliven the staid phantom ride genre and demonstrate the possibilities of creative editing. The following year he experimented with reversing in The House That Jack Built (1900), developed dream-time and the dissolve effect in Let Me Dream Again (1900) and pioneered the use of the close-up with Grandma's Reading Glass, As Seen Through a Telescope and Spiders on a Web (all 1900). Film historian Frank Gray describes this experimental period, from 1897 to 1900, as Smith's laboratory years. In 1902 Smith collaborated with old friend Georges M√©li√®s at the Star Films studio in Montreil, Paris, on a pre-enactment of the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra commissioned by Charles Urban of the Warwick Trading Company after rival company Mutoscope and Biograph acquired the rights to film the actual event. In 1903 Charles Urban left the Warwick Trading Company to form the Charles Urban Trading Company taking the rights to Smith's films with him, at what marked the end of his most active period as a film- maker. = At Laboratory Lodge = In 1904, A. H. Tee took over the lease on St Ann's Well Gardens, and Smith moved to a new home in Southwick, Sussex, dubbed Laboratory Lodge, where with finance from Charles Urban, he went on to develop the Lee-Turner Process, which had been acquired by Urban following the death of Edward Raymond Turner in 1903, into the first successful colour film process, Kinemacolor.Hall (1964), p. 172. A Visit to the Seaside (1908), the first motion picture in Kinemacolor Smith proved the new process, which abandoned the three-colour approach of Edward Turner in favour of a two-colour (red-green) process, with early test films such as Tartans of Scottish Clans (1906) and Woman Draped in Patterned Handkerchiefs (1908) before giving a trade demonstration of A Visit to the Seaside (1908) on 1 May 1908, followed by public demonstration from early 1909 as far afield as Paris and New York, for which Smith was awarded a silver medal by the Royal Society of Arts. In 1910 Urban founded the Natural Colour Kinemacolor Company, which successfully used the process to produce over 100 short features at its studios in Hove and Nice, until it was put out of business by a 1914 patent suit filed by William Friese-Greene, which ended Smith's film career. = Later life and death = In the late 1940s he was rediscovered by the British film community, being made a Fellow of the British Film Academy in 1955. Smith died in Brighton on 17 May 1959.Hall (1964), p. 173. Hove Museum has a permanent display on Smith and Williamson.

It centers on a young woman named Silvia played by Cruz. The movie engages in word play and pun and rhapsodises on the juxtaposition of old and new in Spain and many other emotional contrasts such as erotic desire and food.Ham Ham Plot In a lone building on a busy road going through an arid desert in Spain, the beautiful Silvia spends her evenings making potato omelettes to sell at the factory where she works sewing men's underwear. Her mother Carmen works as a prostitute in a roadside brothel nearby. Jos√© Luis, pampered son of the factory owners, has been seeing Silvia on the side and when she tells him she has missed two periods, he picks up a soda can tab from the ground to serve as an engagement ring and promises he will stand by her. He cannot promise marriage until he can convince his wealthy parents that she will be a suitable bride. Appalled, his mother Conchita refuses approval but his father Manuel refuses to intervene. Conchita then decides to get rid of Silvia, by finding somebody to seduce her. She picks Ra√∫l, an aspiring bullfighter and part-time model. After his advances are repulsed a few times Ra√∫l is genuinely smitten by Silvia, and he starts to woo her in earnest. Meanwhile Conchita comes to desire Ra√∫l for herself. Alarmed at the failure of her ploy, she gives Ra√∫l a motorcycle as an enticement. Enraged by all this, Jos√© Luis forces himself upon Silvia to revenge himself against Ra√∫l. Desperate to keep Ra√∫l, Conchita seduces him at the isolated ham warehouse that she supervises. Jos√© Luis arrives and is furious. Seizing upon hams to use as weapons, the two men fight, which results in the death of Jos√© Luis, while Ra√∫l is badly wounded. With Conchita weeping over her injured lover, her husband Manuel arrives with Silvia. The two comfort each other, he having lost his son and she her fianc√©.

When he was 16, he arrived in the United States, graduated from the Juilliard School of Music and worked as a lounge pianist. During World War II, while he was serving as the musical director for the USO's New York City branch of the USO, he met Jack Paar, and the two remained friends for years. In 1954‚Äì55, Melis was the pianist when The Morning Show on CBS was hosted by Paar. Then Paar moved from mornings to late night, and from 1957 to 1962, Melis served as the musical director of The Tonight Show during Jack Paar's tenure as host. He also wrote the music for Paar's theme song, \\"IM4U\\" (lyrics by Sev F. Marino), and he performed with Paar on other shows, including Parr‚Äôs Startime (1960). One of his routines on Paar's shows was the \\"telephone game,\\" in which Melis would improvise a musical number based on the last four digits of an audience member's telephone number.

The Buccaneers is the last novel written by Edith Wharton. The novel is set in the 1870s, around the time Edith Wharton was a young girl. It was unfinished at the time of her death in 1937, and published in that form in 1938. Wharton's manuscript ends with Lizzy inviting Nan to a house party to which Guy Thwarte has also been invited. The book was published in 1938 by Penguin Books in New York. After some time, Marion Mainwaring finished the novel following Wharton's detailed outline of the novel in 1993. Plot The story revolves around five wealthy and ambitious American girls, their guardians and the titled, landed but impoverished Englishmen who marry them as the girls participate in the London Season. As the novel progresses, the plot follows Nan and her marriage to the Duke of Tintagel. The novel begins with three socially ambitious families looking for the status needed for their daughters to live successful lives complete with European titles. The young women's fathers' money is very attractive to European aristocrats to maintain their version of wealth: collections of art, property, and societal status. While some girls live in unhappy marriages, they often take lovers to make their marriages work- or they file for divorce. While these young women were not in the best of situations with high expectations from the dukes, some fall in love such as Nan. Nan eventually falls in love with Guy Thwarte.Edith Wharton (1915) Reception in 1938 of incomplete novel  Edith Wharton's final novel circulated positive and negative reactions from critics. It was often referred to by The New York Times as the \\"unfinished novel.\\" The main questions asked by critics were: \\"Is this really her legacy?\\" and \\"Was there enough left of the book to publish in the first place?\\" According to close friends to Wharton such as her literary executor Galliard Lapsey stated the story was brought to her intended conclusion. There were also positive remarks regarding the unfinished story. According to literary critic May Lamberton Becker, The Buccaneers was one of her greatest works and one of the greatest works of the period. Lamberton-Becker also stated, \\"To the last, Mrs. Wharton kept faith with her public, even in the novel for whose complete she could not stay. The Buccaneers is complete as far as the story goes, and may be read without the sense of final frustration that attends to so many unfinished novels. By far, the greater part, all indeed but the climax, the conclusion, and the scenes by which these were to be directly approached, are not only in print, but in what amounts to final form. What was to happen in these unwritten chapters her own synopsis- unusually rich in detail and in emotional undercurrent-leaves in no manner of doubt.\\" Time Magazine also wrote an editorial on her last novel in 1938. It begins with, \\"Death last year ended Edith Wharton's work on a novel that might have been her masterpiece.She has written 29 chapters of a book apparently planned to run about 35 chapters. The story had reached its climax; the characters were at a moment in their careers when they were compelled to make irrevocable decisions. While Mrs. Wharton left notes suggesting how she intended to end the novel, she gave no hint of how she intended to solve its moral and esthetic problems.\\" Lastly, there were critics who became defensive of Wharton's last work. Literary critic Christopher Money referred to critics who responded negatively to Wharton's last work as a \\"low class lot\\", and respected her humor towards the upper elite.Money, C (1938). \\"Edith Wharton's Unfinished Novel,\\". Saturday Review. p. 10 Money even complimented Wharton's literary executor on his \\"eloquent, but surely unnecessary apology for the publication of this incomplete novel.\\"  Reception for the 1993 Marion Mainwaring's complete version  The criticism for Mainwaring's finished novel was harsh in 1993. In The New Yorker, John Updike stated regarding the completed ‚Äúwe have a text that in no typographical way discriminates between her words and Wharton‚Äôs, and that asks us to accept this bastardization as a single smooth reading unit.‚Äù Secondly, In The New Republic, Andrew Delbanco likened Dr. Mainwaring's efforts to an act of ‚Äúliterary necrophilia.‚Äù Also, in a Globe review, Katherine A. Powers wrote that certain sections of ‚ÄúThe Buccaneers‚Äù showcased ‚ÄúWharton at her finest: subtle figures and tropes, eagle-eyed irony and a pathologist‚Äôs acuity in matters of class and morality. But there are also sketchiness, lacunae, and a central implausibility, this perhaps the reason she never could complete the work... (Mainwaring's editions) were frankly no help. Under her pen, the narrative loses its ironic torque, the Prince of Wales strolls in, and the story, lobotomized and docile, becomes a blueblood infatuated gush.‚Äù There has been chapter by chapter analysis of the novel to find the key differences between Mainwaring's and Wharton's writings. Lee Sigelman has written on the question of \\" Did Mainwaring do what Wharton would have done herself?\\". After following her writing patterns of Wharton's other works such as Ethan Frome, The House of Mirth, and The Age of Innocence he concluded it was easy to see where Edith Wharton's version ended and where Marion Mainwaring's began due to Edith Wharton's methodical writing style and patterns. The analysis of Wharton's twenty-nine chapters indicated a standard progression of her words and according to Lee Sigelman, \\"...the \\"completed\\" version of the Buccaneers reveals the substitution of Mainwaring for Wharton as an author caused a decisive break from her well established pattern.\\" The different words and number of words were tracked in the Buccaneers to measure the \\"vocabulary richness\\". It is understood to be a reasonable characteristic to understand the writer's thought process and writing style. Critics such as Sigelman also question if Wharton's vocabulary was just richer than Mainwaring's twelve chapters she completed for the novel. Mainwaring's statement back to these critics was, \\"The argument that she was a great writer and how dare I? Well, I don‚Äôt think she was always a great writer, at least not as great as some. I wouldn‚Äôt have attempted this with a George Eliot or a Jane Austen novel. ‚Ä¶ Edith Wharton was not at her stylistic best here; that made it easier for me.\\" Mainwaring was not well known before her work with the Buccaneers, but she was known for being a translator and scholar. 1995 miniseries Independently of Mainwaring's completion, screenwriter Maggie Wadey was commissioned to adapt and finish the novel for a television version co-produced by the BBC and American PBS broadcaster WGBH; it was screened on BBC 1 in the UK and in the Masterpiece Theatre series in the United States during 1995. This serial adaptation was directed by Philip Saville and executive produced by Phillippa Giles. Wadey's version of The Buccaneers, ending with the inclusion of homosexuality as well as its climatic romantically dramatic showiness and seemingly \\"happy ending\\", received widespread criticism from both the BBC viewing public and Wharton fans and scholars alike. The general protest was that Wadey's development was far too unrealistic and stereotypically \\"Hollywood\\" in its closing development and end as Guy Thwaithe and the Duchess, Annabel \\"Nan\\", literally go riding off into the sunset to live happily ever after. This is starkly different from the ending of every one of Wharton's previous novels which all have markedly realistic and distinctly solemn endings for all of their characters and plot lines. Many viewers felt that in using this ending, the BBC was \\"selling out\\" to American Hollywood. While Wadey's BBC ending was at the heart of the controversy, both Mainwaring's and Wadey's endings were heavily criticized for their \\"sensationalism\\" and perceived lack of \\"trueness\\" to Wharton's style of work and both writers independently made the claims that they sought to romanticize and \\"Americanize\\" the story, despite it having been penned by American novelist Wharton to explore the intersections and clashes of class, commerce and marriage in Old and New World cultures and high society. A companion book to the BBC series was published by Viking in 1995 (). For this book, Angela Mackworth-Young revised and completed the novel based on the screenplay of Maggie Wadey. A television series titled The Buccaneers (1956), produced for ITC Entertainment, has no relation to the Wharton novel.

She was noticed after winning several beauty pageants like the Miss Madras contest (1999), which marked her entry into the film industry. After appearing in a supporting role in the 1999 Tamil film Jodi, she had her first lead role in the 2002 film Mounam Pesiyadhe. She later rose to fame starring in the successful films, Saamy (2003), Ghilli (2004) and Aaru (2005) in Tamil cinema and Varsham (2004), Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana (2005) and Athadu (2005) in Telugu cinema. she secured her first South Filmfare Best Actress Award for Varsham in 2004. She went on to win the award two more times for Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana (2005) and Aadavari Matalaku Ardhalu Verule (2007). In 2010, she made her Bollywood d√©but in Khatta Meetha. She was seen in her career best performances in Abhiyum Naanum (2008), Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa (2010), Kodi and '96 (2018) for which she won critical acclaim and various accloades. Early life Trisha was born to Krishnan and Uma in Chennai (then known as Madras) into a Tamil Palakkad Iyer family. She completed schooling at the Sacred Heart Matriculation School in Church Park, Chennai, and later pursued a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) course at the Ethiraj College for Women (Chennai). She ventured into modelling and appeared in several print and television commercials. In 1999, she won the \\"Miss Salem\\" beauty pageant, and later the same year, the Miss Madras contest. She had also won the Miss India 2001 pageant's \\"Beautiful Smile\\" award. Trisha had aspired to become a criminal psychologist initially, and resisted the thought of pursuing acting, as she wanted to complete her studies first. She also appeared in Falguni Pathak's music video Meri Chunar Udd Udd Jaye as Ayesha Takia's friend, which was directed by Radhika Rao and Vinay Sapru. She was later approached for an acting role in Tamil movie Lesa Lesa by Indian film director Priyadarshan, which marked the beginning of her professional career as an actress. During her college course, she had occupied herself with a tight shooting schedule, which made it difficult to continue with her education. However, she compensated by attending summer classes. Film career =Early career 1999‚Äì2003= Soon after her pageant success, Trisha began her acting career in a supporting role as Simran's friend in Jodi. The first project she accepted was the Priyadarshan-directed Lesa Lesa, with the promotional posters for the film, also creating an offer to star in the A R Rahman musical hit, Enakku 20 Unakku 18 (2003). However both the projects' releases were severely delayed, and her first release was Ameer's Mounam Pesiyadhe opposite Surya Sivakumar. The film became a moderate success at the box office and managed to gain credentials for Trisha, with critics claiming that she was \\"undoubtedly a refreshing new find, with sparkling eyes and appealing demeanour\\", also going onto praise the dubbing artiste, Savitha Reddy, who has since regularly dubbed for Trisha. Manasellam, her second project, saw her play a cancer patient; but the film went unnoticed despite positive reviews for the film and the actress. Her subsequent release was the Hari-directed police film, Saamy with Vikram. She played a soft-spoken college-going Brahmin girl and received positive feedbacks for her performance, with Sify's reviewer citing that she was \\"appealingly sensual\\" and looked \\"glamorous\\", and another critic writing that she looked \\"very pretty\\" and suited the role. The masala flick became the biggest blockbuster of the year, grossing 16 crores, and landed Trisha new offers, including several high-budget productions. Lesa Lesa, which was supposed to be her d√©but, released next. The romantic musical, based on the 1998 Malayalam film Summer in Bethlehem, fetched generally positive reviews. Following Lesa Lesa, she appeared in Alai which proved unsuccessful at the box office. Then released her Enakku 20 Unakku 18 which was unsuccessful commercially but was a well noticed film because of its music and visuals and helped her career =2004‚Äì2008= In 2004, she d√©buted in Telugu cinema with M S Raju's romance-action film Varsham, which turned her into an overnight sensation. Critics lauded her performance as Sailaja, a middle-class girl who becomes a film star on her father's insistence; Jeevi from Idlebrain claimed that she was \\"beautiful\\" and a \\"big plus to the film\\", labelling her performance as \\"natural\\", while Sify noted that she had \\"transformed herself into a fine actress with immense screen presence\\". A critic from fullhyderabad.com praised her, citing that she had shown why Tamil Nadu was \\"busy building her a temple\\", further adding that she looked \\"so fresh and fine, you feel like gifting her to the roses\\". While the film was highly commercially successful, running for over 175 days theatres, being declared a \\"sensational hit\\" and becoming one of the highest-grosser of the year, Trisha was given the Telugu Filmfare, as well as the Santosham Award for Best Actress. She was also offered the same role in its Tamil remake Mazhai, which she however declined. Later that year, she enacted the female lead opposite Vijay in the action comedy film Ghilli. She played the character of Dhanalakshmi, a helpless girl, whom a Kabaddi player tries to save from the clutches of an influential thug, who wants to marry her, with most critics agreeing that her performance was overshadowed by Vijay and Prakash Raj's in particular. The film eventually emerged the highest-grossing Tamil film of the year, celebrating a 175-days-run, too, and remains Trisha's biggest commercial success so far. She next appeared in a small role in Mani Ratnam's political drama Aayutha Ezhuthu, starring as part of an ensemble cast that included Siddharth, Madhavan and Surya. The film, despite favourable reviews, performed poorly at the box office, while she was again outshone by the three lead male actors. In the following two years, Trisha had 12 releases overall, which all but one featured her as the female lead. She was part of two male-oriented action-masala flicks Thirupaachi and Aaru, directed by Perarasu and Hari, which both offered only limited roles for her, with the former becoming a major commercial success. In her second Telugu project, the sentimental drama Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana, she starred alongside Siddharth. The film, being Prabhu Deva's directorial d√©but, opened to rave reviews, with Trisha receiving unanimous praise for her portrayal as the village girl Siri, which earned her three Best Actress prizes, including her second consecutive Filmfare Award and her first Nandi Award. Idlebrain noted that she was \\"just great. Her tender looks, innocent face and Telugu traditional costumes make her a treat to watch\\", further labelling her expressions and \\"naughty antics\\" as excellent, while Sify wrote of Trisha that she was \\"amazing as Siri [...] It is her career best performance and she has excelled throughout.\\" The film eventually secured eight Southern Filmfare Awards, the most ever by any Telugu film, while also emerging highly successful at the box office.Latest from Tollywood (9 January 2005). TotalHollywood. Accessed 5 April 2008. Trisha later went on to reprise the role in its Tamil remake as well. Her subsequent releases, N Lingusamy's Ji and Aathi, which saw her pairing with Ajith Kumar and Vijay, respectively, were both critical and economical failures, while Aaru was a moderate success and was received well by critics.Andhra Pradesh (10 December 2005). The Hindu. Accessed 5 April 2008. The successes of Varsham and Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana led to Trisha being cast in the third consecutive M S Raju film, with the producer stating that she was \\"one of the most talented and beautiful actress I have ever worked with\\", going on to draw comparisons to the works of Savitri, Nargis and Sophia Loren. The film, Pournami, directed by Prabhu Deva again, featured her in the titular role alongside a star cast and bombed at the box office. Her sole Tamil release of 2006, Unakkum Enakkum, the remake of Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana, where she acted opposite Jayam Ravi, did very well at the box office. She starred in the Telugu film Stalin with Chiranjeevi, following which her Telugu film Sainikudu with Mahesh Babu was released. Her next release was Aadavari Matalaku Ardhalu Verule where she was cast opposite Venkatesh. The film, Selvaraghavan's first Telugu venture, was a family entertainer and received good response especially from the family audience. Trisha's performance was critically acclaimed and won her accolades, eventually resulting in her third Filmfare win. In Kireedam with Ajith Kumar, Trisha tried comedy and received rave reviews. Kireedam opened with high expectations and received good reviews from media and was declared a success. Her 2008 Tamil films, Bheema and Kuruvi failed to succeed at the box-office. In Telugu Krishna with Ravi Teja, opened to rave reviews, and became a blockbuster. Her other release Bujjigadu starring Prabhas, directed by Puri Jagannadh was released during Summer and made a decent run. Trisha was praised for her performance in Radhamohan's Abhiyum Naanum. King starring Akkineni Nagarjuna directed by Sreenu Vaitla was a December release and it became a blockbuster. =2009‚Äìpresent= Her 2009 films Sarvam with Arya and Sankham opposite Gopichand did not do well and became just average grosser. Trisha had a major role, starring as a Syrian Christian Malayali girl Jessie, in Gautham Menon's 2010 Tamil romantic drama film Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa, which was a big commercial success at the box office. The film centres around the complicated relationship between a Syrian Christian Malayali girl and a Tamil Hindu assistant director, who falls in love with her, only to be met by her indifference and reluctance as they belong to different religions and her strict conservative family will never consent to their marriage. Her performance was well received by critics, earning her the 2010 Vijay Award for Favourite Heroine. Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff commented, \\"Trisha is a revelation. Shorn of her filmi make-up, she dazzles in Nalini Sriram's simple costumes.\\" Sify remarked, \\"Trisha looks good and delivers her career best performance in a knock-out role.\\" Namo Venkatesa was her sole Telugu release in 2010. In the same year, she starred in Manmadhan Ambu with Kamal Haasan and R Madhavan and made her d√©but in Bollywood with the Priyadarshan film Khatta Meetha. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews from critics and Box Office India declared it an average performer at the box office. She was part of two commercially successful ventures in 2011, Theenmaar in Telugu and Venkat Prabhu's Mankatha in Tamil. The latter was the highest-grossing Tamil film of the year and in Trisha's career. She had two Telugu releases in 2012-Bodyguard, a remake of the same-titled Malayalam film, which saw her being paired with Daggubati Venkatesh for the third time, and Dammu opposite Jr NTR-and two Tamil releases in 2013-Samar starring Vishal, and the comedy drama Endrendrum Punnagai starring Jiiva. She signed on two \\"women-centric\\" bilingual projects featuring female lead casts, titled Rambha Urvasi Menaka and Kannaale Kannan. Although both films were commenced, they were stalled in 2013. Her releases in 2015 included Yennai Arindhaal opposite Ajith Kumar, Thoongavanam with Kamal Haasan, Bhooloham with Jayam Ravi in Tamil. She also acted in the horror film Aranmanai 2. In 2018, she acted in a Malayalam film Hey Jude with Nivin Pauly making her Malayalam debut. She played a leading role in a Tamil romantic drama '96 opposite Vijay Sethupathi and received praise from critics. Janani K of India Today praised her performance as career best. She is currently shooting three films, Bhogi, Garjanai and Petta opposite Rajinikanth. Other work and endorsements An ardent animal lover, Trisha has been the Goodwill Ambassador of PETA. In 2010, Trisha collaborated with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) in issuing a public appeal to domesticate stray dogs rather than craving for pedigreed foreign breeds. She was also the Goodwill Ambassador for the \\"Angel for Animals\\" campaign organised by PETA in 2010, encouraging people to adopt homeless dogs. PETA praised Trisha for her work, and sent her an appreciation letter highlighting her animal rescue work and efforts to encourage people to adopt Indian community dogs.

Her mother Uma Krishnan, had been offered various roles by several Tamil film makers and actors including Kamal Hassan, but turned them down, as she wanted to concentrate on Trisha's career. She accompanies Trisha on film shoots, events, and functions, and they have appeared together only in a commercial advertisement. About her relationship with her mother, Trisha remarks, \\"She has been the pillar of my strength and has stood by me like a rock through thick and thin.[...] Everyone in the industry and my friends know how close I'm to my mom.\\" On 23 January 2015 Trisha became engaged to Varun Manian, a Chennai-based businessman. In May 2015, she confirmed that the couple had ended their engagement.

The releases proved to have limited commercial appeal. \\"Keep It Simple, is packed with vigorous, pitchy bursts\\" notes Amanda Petrusich in her Pitchfork review, noting the album \\"doesn't perfectly reflect the band's fast-and-fierce live show . . Get Some was recorded by Rhoderick Cole in his Charlottesville mansion.

Glide Magazine said of the album that the group take \\"a tack similar to that of Old Crow Medicine Show, the Punk Brothers, The Howlin' Brothers and other modern outfits that draw from the past to make an impression in the present.\\" They went on to say that theirs is \\"a sound once heard on back porches throughout the heartland, now brought to life with the stirring enthusiasm of would-be rock stars performing for appreciative audiences.\\" New Material - Lineup Change (2018-2019) In January of 2018, the band saw the exit of Ferd Moyse and Brian Gorby, to focus on family and other musical projects. Face to face with the possibility and fear of having to hang it all up, David recruited long-time friend and former band-mate from a previous project, Beau Dodson for charismo, drums/percussion and vocals. Chris Stevens, who had sat in on bass for Hackensaw in the past, was brought on full time, adding bass to the line-up once again after a stint without. To round out the new line-up, Chris recommended his astonishingly talent band-mate and pal Caleb Powers for fiddle and vocals. In December of 2018 the reformed team entered the studio to record a five song EP, due to be released in the spring of 2019. Charismo (the instrument) Brian Gorby on charismo with The Hackensaw Boys, Legacy Credit Union Stage--Birmingham, Alabama June 15, 2008. A distinctive aspect of the Hackensaw live-performance experience is the percussion instrument known as a \\"charismo\\". Invented and played by former band member Justin \\"Salvage\\" Neuhardt, who also performed on spoons and the musical saw, it is described as \\"a home-made tin can contraption.\\" As founder Sickmen remembers it: Calvin James Pynn of The Tartan (Radford University) states \\"Neuhardt's charismo\\" is the \\"most notable\\" of the group's instruments: In an interview with Scott Simon of N.P.R. Neuhardt himself explains how it came to be: Brian Gorby, Neuhardt's friend and former bandmate in the percussion-heavy jam-band Humble Sacrifice, has carried on the charismo's tradition in the Hackensaw Boys as their touring percussionist. With funk influences, Gorby uses the charismo to bring a rambunctious flair to the band's old-time style. Musical style As former member and founder Bullington puts it \\"we can play an old folks home in the afternoon and then play for a bunch of punk rockers, or whoever else might still be up and ready for a good time, or some music at midnight. They all seem to enjoy it equally.\\" Fellow founder Sickmen claims \\"the original intent of the band . . was to bring old-time Appalachian country punk rock.\\"\\"Hackensaw Boys: Not a Traditional Oldtime Band\\" by T.J. Jones (with interview by Lydia Loveless), Carbondale Rocks; February 16, 2012. Band member Jesse \\"Baby J.\\" Fiske questions the importance of assigning a specific style: \\"We're not really an old-time band either. As long as we speak to someone, it doesn't really matter what the genre is.\\" The group largely performs original material, with a traditional feel. As former member Shawn Galbraith, banjo player, puts it: \\"We play original material provided by different members of the band. There are some traditional elements to our sound for sure, but we always try to maintain some uniqueness.\\"\\"The Hackensaw Boys to play at 123 Pleasant Street\\" interview by Hunter Homistek, The Daily Athenaeum > A&E; November 17, 2011. \\"I don't think many people would call us a traditional oldtime band,\\" states bandleader David Sickmen: \\"I'd say our songs are about ninety percent originals.

Following the purchase of MES by British Aerospace in November 1999 to form BAE Systems, Tracor became BAE Systems Integrated Defense Solutions. Following a 2005 reorganisation, the company became BAE Systems Sensor Integration, part of Electronics and Integrated Solutions. History Tracor was founded in 1954 as Associated Consultants and Engineers. Tracor was the brainchild of physicist Richard N. Lane, its first president. He recruited Frank W. McBee, Dr. Chester McKinney, and Jess Stanbrough as its founders, and these four added an attorney friend, Harry Pollard, and machinist Byron Grisham, Jr. Early contracts included sales to Union Carbide and the United States Navy. The company's early focus on research and development soon expanded to the manufacture of instruments and components. In 1960 the company was renamed Texas Research Associates and in 1962 merged with Textran Corporation to become Tracor. Dr. D. Van Holliday was one of Tracor's founding employees In 1976, Tracor became the first Austin, Texas, based company on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1981, Tracor created Rokar International in Jerusalem, Israel for the development of advanced electronics for military and commercial applications. Tracor was acquired by Westmark Systems in 1986. Westmark was soon in financial difficulties partly because the $866 million deal was highly leveraged but also due to a collapse in oil prices. Westmark filed for bankruptcy protection in 1989 and in 1991 Tracor was split from the company. In 1993, Tracor increased its size dramatically with the acquisition of Vitro Corporation from Penn Central Transportation Company for $94 million. In 1994, Tracor purchased GDE Systems Inc. from the Carlyle Group. (GDE Systems was originally the General Dynamics Electronics Division before it was spun off.) In February 1996, Tracor acquired AEL Industries, an electronic warfare systems and components manufacturer which became part of the Tracor Aerospace division in March 1997.http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=247048 Tracor had a 30-year history of support of the Aegis defense system on United States Navy cruisers and destroyers. Tracor had great success in its later years designing and producing flare and chaff cartridges and their dispenser systems for military aircraft in defense against infrared- and radar-targeting missiles. =GEC takeover= General Electric Company plc announced its intention to acquire Tracor in April 1998 and to merge it with a North American subsidiary. Following a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) (to ensure there were no national security implications) GEC completed the transaction in June 1998. The relatively quick decision, particularly for such an important defense contractor, was due to the relationship which already existed between GEC and the Defense Department. A condition of the purchase was that GEC must appoint a \\"proxy board\\". This is a mechanism where the company is run locally by American managers and was employed in this case due to the many sensitive projects which Tracor was involved in. The General Electric Company plc was a British company, not affiliated with the similarly named company which is based in the United States. It has since been renamed to Marconi plc. The acquisition was as a major expansion of GEC's defence division, GEC-Marconi (later Marconi Electronic Systems), however seven months later GEC announced the demerger of Marconi Electronic Systems (including the North American defence businesses) which would then merge with British Aerospace (BAe) to form BAE Systems. This process was completed on November 30, 1999. Commentators have described Tracor as the jewel in crown of GEC-Marconi North America. =BAE Systems= In the new company GEC's North American defense businesses were merged with BAe's U.S. interests to form BAE Systems North America. In the years since, BAE Systems has pursued growth in America more aggressively than any other area in order to take advantage of the large U.S. procurement and research budgets. Today BAE Systems Inc. (of which Tracor is a large part) is the largest foreign player in the U.S. defense market.

It was released in 1990 on Sub Pop. An early version of the album had been recorded in the traditional manner (instruments and vocals recorded separately, then mixed in the studio). However, the band and the label decided that it did not fit with their vision, so it was re-recorded \\"live in the studio\\" direct to two-track, with the exception of \\"Love Whip.\\" The phrase \\"Smoke 'em if You Got 'em\\" or \\"Smoke if You Got 'em\\" predates this album and is slang for \\"do what you want, if you have the means.\\" The first phrase was popular during World War II, meaning to take a break.

He was born April 14, 1943 at New Westminster, British Columbia and worked as a teacher. Skelly, the son of Robert Daniel Skelly and Dorothy Graham, was educated at the University of British Columbia. In 1965, he married Sonia Alexandra Shewchuk. He has a daughter, Susan Kathleen Skelly, born 1973; and a son, Robert Mark William Skelly, born 1975. Susan married Michael Ramsay, and they have three children: Rebecca Ruth, born 2001; Sarah- Grace Victoria, born 2002; and Maria Anne Heather, born 2010. He served in the BC Legislature from 1972 to 1987. The longest-serving member for Alberni constituency in history, he was elected five times. He was elected leader of the British Columbia New Democratic Party in 1984 and was Opposition Leader in the BC Legislature until 1987. He resigned as MLA in early 1988 and was elected to the House of Commons of Canada representing the Federal riding of Comox‚ÄîAlberni from 1988 to 1993. During his campaign in the 1986 election he showed such great gains against then Premier Bill Bennett that the Social Credit Party became alarmed and convinced Bennett to resign, replacing him with Bill Vander Zalm. The Social Credit Party then went on to win the election. While the NDP failed to gain any seats under Bob Skelly's leadership, neither did they lose any (Social Credit won 47 seats to the NDP's 22 in the newly enlarged BC Legislative Assembly). The NDP had dropped in popular vote from the previous election, though they scored a higher percentage than in the elections they won in 1972, 1991 and 1996. The NDP vote fell in each election after 1979 until the 2005 election. Following the election, the distribution of electoral districts in the province was declared to be biased in favour of Social Credit, suggesting that Skelly would have won if this hadn't been the case. The courts then ordered a fair redistribution. In 1986 Skelly resigned as NDP leader and in the following year, a party convention acclaimed Michael Harcourt as his successor. Skelly went on to federal politics and was elected Member of Parliament for the federal riding of Comox‚ÄîAlberni in the 1988 federal election under the banner of the New Democratic Party. He ran for a second term but was defeated in the 1993 general election in which the New Democratic Party collapsed to nine seats..

He was the winner of the first International Chopin Piano Competition in 1927. The family moved frequently during his early childhood. When they settled down in Moscow in 1914, he was sent to music school. He studied with Elena Gnesina, a pupil of Ferruccio Busoni. At the same time, he studied composition with Alexander Gretchaninov and achieved admirable results. In 1921, Oborin was accepted into Moscow Conservatory as a student of piano and composition. He completed his piano studies in 1926. In the same year, news reached Moscow of the First International Fr√©d√©ric Chopin Piano Competition, to be held in Warsaw in 1927, and his piano teacher Konstantin Igumnov immediately thought of him. After winning first prize in the competition, he gave concerts in Poland and in Germany. Until 1945 he performed exclusively in Russia and taught at the Moscow Conservatory at the same time. In 1935 he played his first concert with the violinist David Oistrakh, with whom he continued to collaborate all of his life. Aram Khachaturian dedicated his Piano Concerto in D flat to Oborin,Aram Khachaturian, Onno van Rijen and wrote \\"When I was working on my concerto I dreamed of hearing it played by Lev Oborin. My dream came true in the summer of 1937. The wonderful performance by this outstanding pianist ensured its success\\".Source: CD insert from ASV platinum (?CD PLT8510) (\\"Khachaturian Gayaneh Suite, Piano Concerto, The Valencian Widow Suite\\"): authors, Robert Matthew-Walker, Noel Goodwin. During the years 1941 to 1963, Oborin played in a piano trio with David Oistrakh and the cellist Sviatoslav Knushevitsky, achieving international fame. Khachaturian's three concertos, one each for piano, violin and cello, were written for the individual members of this trio. He gave first public performances of the works of several modern composers, including Khachaturian, Shebalin, Myaskovsky, Prokofiev (including the Violin Sonata No. 1 with Oistrakh), and Shostakovich. He trained many pianists, including Vladimir Ashkenazy (winner of the second prize at the 1955 Chopin Competition), Anatoly Dokumentov, Mikhail Voskresensky, Minoru Nojima, Dmitri Sakharov, Alexander Bakhchiev, Andrei Egorov, Lev Natochenny, Boris Berman, Eduard Miansarov and Olga Kiun.

Announced in October 1998, several Unix vendors were involved; IBM provided POWER and PowerPC support from AIX, Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) provided IA-32 support, and Sequent added multi-processing (MP) support from their DYNIX/ptx system. Intel Corporation provided expertise and ISV development funding for porting to their upcoming IA-64 (Itanium Architecture) CPU platform, which was yet to be released at that time. The focus of the project was to create an enterprise-class UNIX for IA-64, which at the time was expected to eventually dominate the UNIX server market. By March 2001, however, \\"the explosion in popularity of Linux ... prompted IBM to quietly ditch\\" this; all involved attempted to find a niche in the rapidly developing Linux market and moved their focus away from Monterey. Sequent was acquired by IBM in 1999. In 2000, SCO's UNIX business was purchased by Caldera Systems, a Linux distributor, who later renamed themselves the SCO Group. In the same year, IBM eventually declared Monterey dead. Intel, IBM, Caldera Systems, and others had also been running a parallel effort to port Linux to IA-64, Project Trillian, which delivered workable code in February 2000. In late 2000, IBM announced a major effort to support Linux. In May 2001, the project announced the availability of a beta test version AIX-5L for IA-64, basically meeting its original primary goal. However, Intel had missed its delivery date for its first Itanium processor by two years, and the Monterey software had no market. With the exception of the IA-64 port and Dynix MP improvements, much of the Monterey effort was an attempt to standardize existing versions of Unix into a single compatible system. Such efforts had been undertaken in the past (e.g., 3DA) and had generally failed, as the companies involved were too reliant on vendor lock-in to fully support a standard that would allow their customers to leave for other products. With Monterey, two of the key partners already had a niche they expected to continue to serve in the future: POWER and IA-64 for IBM, IA-32 and IA-64 for SCO. The breakdown of Project Monterey was one of the factors leading to a lawsuit in 2003, where SCO Group sued IBM over their contributions to Linux. IBM sold only 32 Monterey licenses in 2001, and fewer in 2002.

They are situated on the edge of the Berkshire Downs above the village of Streatley and overlooking the Goring Gap. Together they comprise an outstanding area of 27 hectares (67 acres) of downland and woodland with many attractive walks and views. Lardon Chase, and a part of the Holies known as Holies Down, are also designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. The properties lie within the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and in an area known for the presence of several Neolithic and Iron Age forts. Lardon Chase and Lough Down comprise a spur of downland which lies to the west of Goring and Streatley. Since it was acquired by the National Trust, the land has been managed by a mixture of scrub clearance and cattle grazing, so as to encourage the growth of chalk-loving plants. The Holies is a woodland fringed grassy coombe which is separated from Lardon Chase and Lough Down by the B4009 road from Streatley to Newbury. Before acquisition by the National Trust, the Holies was used for motorbike scrambling and turf stripping, resulting in considerable damage to the ground. The National Trust is encouraging the natural recolonisation of the area by chalk-loving plant species. The slopes of all three properties form one of the largest remaining areas of chalk grassland in the county and support a wide range of flowers and butterflies. Plants found in the grassland include autumn gentian, clustered bellflower, blue fleabane, vervain, common rock-rose, horseshoe vetch, kidney vetch, marjoram, yellow-wort, purging flax, wild carrot, chalk milkwort, stemless thistle, eyebright, mouse-ear hawkweed, salad burnet, ragwort, wild thyme, hairy violet, squinancywort, hawkweed ox-tongue, common spotted orchid and pyramidal orchid. Scattered bands of hawthorn scrub provide shelter for insect life and several butterfly species can be found, including chalkhill blue, marbled white, adonis blue, grizzled skipper and dingy skipper. All three properties are interconnected and accessible from a car park located on the B4009, or by steeply climbing footpaths from Streatley village. The Holies is also accessible (on foot only) from the A329 road south of Streatley, whilst Lough Down can be accessed from the ancient track of The Ridgeway on its northern boundary. Access is free, and available at all times. The properties adjoin the Goring & Streatley Golf Club.

He was in command of Fort Dearborn in Chicago during the Battle of Fort Dearborn. Heald was a captain stationed in Fort Wayne, Indiana prior to his appointment at Fort Dearborn, where he relieved the fort's first commander, John Whistler in 1810. The following year, Heald traveled back to Fort Wayne in order to marry Rebecca Wells and returned to the fort with his bride. On August 9, 1812, Heald received orders from General William Hull to evacuate the troops from Fort Dearborn, leaving behind all the supplies at the fort. This meant that the Potawatomi would take the supplies and sell them to the British. Heald decided, therefore, not to leave the fort. On August 15, a group of Miami Indians led by his wife's uncle, Captain William Wells, arrived from Fort Wayne to provide assistance. A band of Potawatomi attacked the column, killing many civilians and soldiers. The ones they did not kill were held for ransom and sold to the British who then set them free. Heald and his wife were both wounded, Heald being shot through the hips. The Healds made their way across Lake Michigan and eventually arrived at Fort Detroit, then in British hands, where they surrendered. The British transported them to Buffalo, New York, where they were ransomed back to the Americans. Heald was promoted to major shortly after his release, and was given a disability discharge in 1814.

Since the late 1960s, when he helped to organise the Scratch Orchestra, he has been associated with the English school of experimental music. Skempton's work is characterised by stripped-down, essentials-only choice of materials, absence of formal development and a strong emphasis on melody. The musicologist Hermann-Christoph M√ºller has described Skempton's music as \\"the emancipation of the consonance\\".M√ºller 1998.  Life  Skempton was born in Chester and studied at Birkenhead School and Ealing Technical College.Potter, Grove. He started composing before 1967, but that year he moved to London and began taking private lessons in composition from Cornelius Cardew. In 1968 Skempton joined Cardew's experimental music class at Morley College, where in spring 1969 Cardew, Skempton and Michael Parsons organised the Scratch Orchestra. This ensemble, which had open membership, was dedicated to performing experimental contemporary music by composers such as La Monte Young, John Cage and Terry Riley, as well as by members of the orchestra itself. One of Skempton's early works, Drum No. 1 (1969), became one of the \\"most useful and satisfying\\" pieces in the repertory of the Scratch Orchestra.Parsons 1980, 13. Through the Scratch Orchestra Skempton met numerous composers and performers, including Christopher Hobbs, John White and various Systems artists, and the pianist John Tilbury. However, tensions arose during the politicising of the Scratch Orchestra in the early 1970s, when Cardew and a number of other important members pushed the ensemble in a Maoist direction. Skempton, Hobbs, Parsons, White and many others refused to be associated with this political line, and the break-up of the Orchestra was accompanied by (in Parsons's words) \\"a split between its 'political' and 'experimental' factions\\".Michael Parsons. Note to Piece For Cello and Accordion. From LMJ 11 CD COMPANION, Not Necessarily \\"English Music\\" Contributors' Notes. Since 1971 Skempton has been working as a music editor, performer (of his own compositions, on piano and accordion), and teacher. He now teaches composition at the Birmingham Conservatoire. In 1974 Skempton and Michael Parsons formed a duo to perform their own works. The 1980s saw an increase of interest in Skempton's music, which led to more commissions and permitted him to compose more for larger forces.Parsons 1987, 16. Lento, an orchestral work composed in late 1991, became one of Skempton's most widely recognised pieces. In the 1990s important recordings of his works started appearing, such as a disc of piano music recorded by his old friend and former Scratch Orchestra colleague John Tilbury, released on Sony Classical in 1996,MacDonald 1996. and Surface Tension, a recording of miscellaneous works released on Mode Records. Skempton was the winner in the Chamber Scale Composition category at the Royal Philharmonic Society Music Awards in 2005 for his string quartet Tendrils (2004).  Works  Skempton's style is characterised by a concentration on quality of sound and economy of means,Parsons 1980, 12. absence of development in the conventional sense, and concentration on sonority. Many of his pieces are quite short, lasting no longer than one or two minutes.Hill 1984, 8. Although the compositional methods are clearly experimental, involving, for example, aleatory methods, there is a marked emphasis on the melody in many pieces. Some of his earlier piano works, such as Saltaire Melody (1977) and Trace (1980), have become favourites with the public. Formative influences on Skempton's music included the works of Erik Satie, John Cage and Morton Feldman. For example, A Humming Song (1967), an early piano piece composed before Skempton started lessons with Cardew, is a miniature with static, gentle sound. The harmonic structure consists of eight symmetrically arranged pitches, out of which six are selected for use in the piece. Chance procedures are then used to determine the order and number of occurrences of individual pitches. The pianist is asked to sustain certain pitches by humming.Parsons1980, 12. Another early piece, Drum No. 1 (1969), composed for the Scratch Orchestra, consists of just a few written instructions to the performers and is clearly inspired by similarly realised works by La Monte Young, whose music Cardew was enthusiastically propagating in the late 1960s.Parsons1980, 13. The score of May Pole (1971), a piece for orchestra, consists of a chance-determined sequence of chords. Each performer chooses a note from a chord, and chooses the moment when to play that note. The later the choice, the softer the dynamics.Score and instructions reproduced in Pace 1997, 9. Skempton later called such pieces \\"landscapes\\" that \\"simply project the material as sound, without momentum.\\"Parsons 1987, 21. Other early works include two pieces for tape, a medium Skempton rarely used later: Indian Summer (1969) and Drum No. 3 (1971). The early 1970s saw a slow shift from static, abstract pieces to pieces with more clearly defined rhythmic and harmonic structures, although the methods and forms Skempton used remained unorthodox. For instance, in the series of Quavers piano pieces (1973‚Äì75) the music consists solely of repeated chords with no pauses between them. In addition to \\"landscapes\\" two other categories appeared, dubbed \\"melodies\\" and \\"chorales\\" by the composer. The \\"melodies\\" are single melodic lines either with simple accompaniment (Saltaire Melody, for piano (1977)) or suspended in space (later works such as Trace for piano (1980) and Bagatelle for flute (1985)). \\"Chorales\\" are works where material is presented primarily (or solely) using chords. An example is Postlude (1978), for piano, in contradistinction to Eirenicon 3 (1978), also for piano, which is a \\"landscape\\". The earlier \\"melodies\\" were apparently composed at the instrument, intuitively, whereas the later ones evolve from a series of written pitches.An email interview with Howard Skempton conducted by Malcolm Atkins between November 2002 and February 2003 It was also in the 1970s that Skempton started composing chamber works, although these were almost always for two performers, since they were written to be performed by the duo of Skempton himself and Michael Parsons. These pieces included a number of horn duos, pieces for two drums, and a duet for piano and woodblocks. Finally, in the 1970s Skempton started playing accordion and composing for this instrument. In 1980 Skempton composed Chorales, his first major work for orchestra. It was commissioned by the Merseyside Youth Orchestra. The composer described it as \\"essentially the same as what I was doing before, but on an orchestral scale\\".Parsons 1987, 19. Although the work is clearly a \\"chorale\\" in the sense Postlude and similar pieces are, during the 1980s Skempton's range expanded greatly, leading to works such as The Durham Strike (1985), which is a set of piano variations that is longer than any of the previous piano pieces, Images (1989), a large cycle of piano works for a TV documentary, and chamber works scored for larger forces than those used previously. Skempton's first major success came in 1991 with the premiere of Lento (1990), an orchestral piece that gained a larger audience for the composer. During the 1990s and the 2000s Skempton started composing longer works for larger forces. These include several concertos, among which are some for instruments rarely used in the western tradition: the hurdy-gurdy (Concerto for hurdy-gurdy and percussion (1994)) and the accordion (Concerto for oboe, accordion and strings (1997)). Some of the later works explore non- standard instrumentation: Alveston (2007) is scored for four trumpets, Horizons (2001) is scored for oboe and harp, Ballade (1997) is a pieces for saxophone quartet and string orchestra.

The lake is around 46 km¬≤, and the reservoir is around 29 km¬≤, with total level of 1,790 feet and a capacity of 3.9 tmc ft. History Osman Sagar was created by damming the Musi River in 1920, to provide an additional source of drinking water for Hyderabad and to protect the city after the Great Musi Flood of 1908. It was constructed during the reign of the last Nizam of Hyderabad State, Osman Ali Khan, hence the name. A princely guest house called Sagar Mahal, overlooking the lake and now a heritage building, was built as a summer resort of the last Nizam. Its location on the banks of the lake offers wonderful views. Telangana Tourism Department operates a resort in the building. The breeze of the lake is very pleasant and has been popular with the locals since the Nizam's time. When Nizam consulted Sri Sir M.Visheswaraya regarding the twin problems of heavy floods in monsoon and acute shortage of water during summer, the latter designed a plan for construction of dam which needs high engineering skills in those days. This simple yet elegant solution solved both the problems for Hyderabad. Tourist spot It is a popular tourist destination, especially in monsoon season when the reservoir is full. Its parks, resorts, and amusement park are a major attraction.

Mierdman, also known as Stephen Mierdman, Steven Mierdmans, Stephen Myerdmann, and Steven Mierman, was born in Hooge Mierde. He first printed in Antwerp from 1542 to about 1546, becoming a freeman of the city in November 1543. Some time after 1546, to escape proceedings for having printed heretical books, he went to England. In July 1550, Mierdman, who had already taken out letters of denization, was granted a royal licence for five years \\"to print various books hitherto unprinted\\" and to \\"employ printers, English and foreign.\\" While printing in London from 1549-1553, he printed a number of books in Latin, English, French, Italian and Dutch, the majority being Protestant tracts, many of them by members of the Dutch Reformed Church. On the accession of Queen Mary, Mierdman had to uproot himself once again. He settled in Emden, printing there from 1554-1558. In Emden he met Willem Gailliart, who would take over his printing shop after Mierdman's death, at Emden, in 1559. The number of books which bear Mierdman's imprint on the title page or colophon are but a small part of his extremely large output; he worked for a number of stationers and printed many books bearing fictitious imprints, such as \\"Niclaes van Oldenborch.\\" References *Nijhoff, W. and Kronenberg, M.

This allows different methods for card sharps to cheat or may be used for magic tricks. To be effective, the distinguishing mark or marks must be visible on the obverse sides of the cards, which are normally uniform. Casinos alter playing cards used at table games before they are sold or given away to prevent cheaters from buying them to cheat at table games. Card marking is often used to cheat when gambling or for card tricks. Many casinos, particularly those in Las Vegas alter the decks of cards they sell to tourists ‚Äì either by punching holes through the middle of cards or trimming their edges ‚Äì to prevent cheaters from returning to the game tables after buying the cards and then slipping the favorable cards into their hands when playing. Marked cards can be used regardless of who shuffles and deals the cards. Some more sophisticated marked-cards scams involve additional manipulative skills to steer the cards into the correct positions once the desired cards have been identified. History Historically, the first attempts to mark playing cards involved bends, crimps and tiny pinprick bumps known as \\"blisters\\", resembling the Braille script. Later, when the first designs appeared on the backs of playing cards, cheats began altering the designs on the backs of cards. Hustlers have used various inks, pigments and scratches, to add or remove lines or patterns from the back of the card design. Some varieties of card marking include block-out work, cut-out work, scroll work, shade work and tint work. More recently, science and technology have also enhanced marked-card techniques. Modern technologies are variations of shade techniques.Traditional block-out and cut-out work have the disadvantage that they must be read close-up, because the marks are small. On the other hand, another advantage of luminous and juice marked-card technology is that they can be read close-up or from across a table. Processes =Block-out= In brief, block-out work is simply using the same color ink as the back of the card and coloring in small white areas of the card. For example, sometimes people add ink to the flowers on the back of a card by making the petals narrower or blocking out a bird on the back design. =Tinting= By subtly tinting different body parts of this small \\"angel\\" feature on the back of a playing card - the head for an ace, the left wing for a king, etc. - the card's rank can be discerned. The two is left unmarked. A more subtle variation on blocking, card backs can be marked by lightly tinting certain areas of a detail. Rather than blocking out the entire petal on a flower detail, the petal is washed with a light ink of a similar colour to the card ink. =Cut-out= As far as cut-out work is concerned, people sometimes use a razor to scrape off some of the printed areas of the card, such as adding (cutting out) a white bird to the back design. =Shading= *Luminous marking - These can only be read by using special gimmick sunglasses or by wearing contact lenses. The original luminous systems used red lenses and greenish ink on the back of red cards, though more recent variations use chemicals applied to the cards. *Video-luminous marking - Video-luminous cards use marks that can not be seen by the human eye, even through a luminous filter. The marks can only be read by using custom-designed electronics and filters and displayed on a TV monitor in another room to a partner. Then the card values may be signaled or transmitted to the player who needs to know. Video-luminous does not have to be used for cheating. They may be used for magic or by a poker house or person who may want to analyze a card game after the fact. If collusion is suspected, the recorded images of the marked cards may be played back later to detect any unusual play. If a player consistently folds a good hand when a partner plays a better hand, then it can be assumed that collusion is taking place in the game. Since these marks cannot be seen by the human eye, there is no chance of detection of the marks, even by knowledgeable players, during the game. Often such marked decks will only be introduced by the house when suspected colluders are seated. *Juice-marking - The marks are only visible when a person is trained to read the marks. No filtered sunglasses are required, although glasses can be used to make it easier to spot these marks. *Tintwork or shade - This technique uses a tint solution to mark cards, but the marking patterns vary depending upon the back design of the cards being marked. *Daub - A special paste is used by a player to mark someone else's deck, on the fly, while the cards are being used during a game and even while being watched. This eliminates the need to switch in a pre-marked deck of cards. *Juice dust - An advanced type of daub, it may be used to make an ad hoc juiced deck. Like daub, it also allows a player to mark someone else's deck, on the fly, while being watched. The main advantages of juice dust are that it will not dull the finish of the cards and that it works on both paper and 100% plastic playing cards. It is not necessary to mark the entire deck in order to gain an advantage in most types of poker - even marking just one rank (especially the aces) is enough to gain a significant advantage in a game such as Texas hold 'em. Detecting marked cards Some marked cards can be identified by performing the gamblers' riffle test (also known as \\"going to the movies\\"). Looking at the back of the cards while they are being riffled, the marks will \\"dance\\" around the back of the cards like an old-fashioned cartoon, provided that the viewer knows what sort of marks to look for. The riffle test is less effective for detecting cards marked with luminous and juice methods. Reflected light off the back of the card will reveal cut-out work (scratches or white ink), as well as many inks or solutions that tend to dull the finish on playing cards because they are alcohol-based. Only the highest quality solutions will not burn the finish of cards. Placing a drop of alcohol on a card and then looking at the finish by reflecting light off the back reveals the dulling effect that these cheap solutions can cause.

He graduated from University College Cork with a degree in Irish and in English. Background Spillane grew up in the Cork suburb of Wilton, in a family of five boys. He was educated in Col√°iste an Spioraid Naoimh, Bishopstown. Raised by his mother, she influenced his musical nature and taught him a variety of Cork songs including \\"The Banks of My Own Lovely Lee\\" and \\"The Lonely Woods of Upton\\". A shy child who shunned the spotlight, he got his first guitar at the age of fifteen and joined his first band in school. When he first began his main influences derived from artists like the Beatles, Neil Young, Planxty and Bob Dylan. His beginnings were more rock than anything else until he had a change of heart. \\"When I started out with rock bands, I sang in an American accent. Then I heard real Americans sing the blues and it made me feel like a fraud. Ever since then, the most important thing for me is to be true to who I am and where I come from.\\" After finishing the leaving cert he took a hiatus to briefly work as a clerk in the Bank of Ireland, but his old band lured him back to his real calling, music. He hopped in a van with his band 'Sabre' and toured around Ireland playing rock music. It all fell apart according to Spillane but it was no matter as at that point he had realised that trad was what he really wanted to immerse himself in and began his career as a professional musician at the age of 20. Musical collaborations and beginnings In Spillane's early career he was involved with several bands but most notably were Nomos and The Stargazers. Taken under the wing of renowned whistle player Noel Shine, Spillane spent several years playing with the local jazz vocal group The Stargazers. It was at this time he studied in UCC obtaining a degree in Irish and English. It was in 1992 when the young trad band Nomos changed Spillane's life. The band was made up of concertina player Niall Vallely, Donegal fiddler Liz Doherty (replaced by Cork fiddle player Vince Milne on the second album), bodhr√°n player Frank Torpey, and Gerry McKee on mandocello and bouzouki. Spillane played acoustic guitar and fretless electric bass while also contributing songs to the group. Together they toured the world and produces two albums Set You Free and I Won't Be Afraid Anymore. Spillane then left to pursue a solo career. Celebration of the Irish language John Spillane at the 2010 National Celtic Festival, Portarlington, Victoria Spillane is an advocate of the resurgence of the Irish language having released two albums almost entirely in Irish. The first being a collaboration with Irish poet Louis de Paor under the pseudonym \\"The Gaelic Hit Factory\\". The album of the same name was critically acclaimed and Spillane and De Paor combined their talents to win the Realta Irish song contest two years in a row. The second being the recent double platinum selling album Irish Songs We Learned at School which was recorded with students from a school in Ballincollig and features thirteen traditional Irish songs. Spillane is noted to have followed the release (and continues to do so) with a school tour to promote the Irish language through music to young people. A song from the album was featured on the 2013 compilation album Larry Kirwan's Celtic Invasion. Spillane in Africa In October 2007 asked by TG4, Spillane filmed a twelve-day musical visit to Senegal in West Africa. It was part of a series called Ceoilchuairt which sent different musicians to different parts of the world to interact with musicians from different cultures and learn from them. An excerpt from his journal describes an experience from that trip: \\"Another day found us on the Isle de Gor√©√©, the chief station for the deportation of slaves from West Africa to the Americas. A World Heritage Site and a museum to the appalling history of man's inhumanity to man. \\"If all the sea were ink, and all the sky were made of paper, there would not be enough ink or paper to write down the human suffering caused by the Slave Trade.\\" The show itself was repeated due to its popularity and Spillane has since collaborated with TG4 on a documentary about emigration.

He is the founder of Haro Bikes and was one of the most important early innovators of BMX freestyle. He began biking in his high school sophomore year when he ran out of money riding dirt bikes. His father bought him a Honda 100 and he stripped the bike down to compete in motorcycle races. He won over 50 motocross trophies by 1975. Around 1976, he got into BMX biking by racing his brother's bike out behind a bike shop in San Diego. After moving to Stockton, California as a result of his parents' divorce, Bob really got started racing and riding for a sponsor for Molina's Bike Shop. He was one of a small group of BMX'ers in that town to perform many of the common tricks. In 1978, Haro teamed up with R. L. Osborn to form the very first freestyle BMX team, which made its debut at ABA's Winternationals in Chandler, AZ. In 1981 Bob Haro and Bob Morales traveled on tour together performing shows all over the Midwest, Eastern United States, and parts of Canada to enthusiastic crowds. Also, in 1981, Haro was involved in the Steven Spielberg production of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial as a stunt rider. In 1981 Bob Haro designed the first frame and fork tailored to freestyle BMX. The frameset was manufactured by the bicycle company Torker and became commercially available in 1982 and was marketed as the Haro Freestyler. He stopped riding in 1985 after four knee surgeries and, in 1987, he was inducted into the American Bicycle Association Hall Of Fame. In 1993 he founded his own company, Haro Design, Inc., a design and marketing company in Cardiff, CA. Bob Haro also invented the style of Flatland BMX. In 2012, as part of the London Olympic Games, Bob Haro choreographed the Dove bike sequence in the Opening ceremony.

Two coats of arms are given the equal status in the Provincial Assembly Decision on the Appearance and Usage of Symbols and Traditional Symbols of AP Vojvodina adopted in 2016. The Assembly of Vojvodina adopted the Coat of arms of Vojvodina on 28 June 2002. Coat of arms is based on the historical coat of arms of the Serbian Vojvodina from the flag of Zemun National Guard from 1848. The Assembly adopted the Traditional coat of arms on 15 September 2016. Description The three fields of the coat of arms of Vojvodina bear the coats of arms of 3 historic regions of Vojvodina, granted in the 18th century: *Baƒçka. The coat of arms of Baƒçka was granted by Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor (1657-1705) in 1699. It was later (1861) retained for the Batsch-Bodrog County. In blue field on a green grass stands Saint Paul wearing blue shirt and brown toga with golden nimbus holding in dexter a downpointed silver sword with golden hilt and in sinister a black book (Bible). The Baƒçka-Bodrog county was divided between Yugoslavia and Hungary after World War I. The northern part of it was later incorporated into B√°cs- Kiskun county of Hungary, that also uses the coat of arms with St. Paul in its dexter half. *Banat. The golden lion rampant on red holding a sabre was the coat of arms of the Banat of Temeswar (Serbian: Tami≈°ki Banat). It was an Austrian crown land, its governor responding directly to the Emperor, and existed from 1718, when the area was taken over from the Ottoman Empire, to 1779, when it was abolished. The coat of arms of the Tami≈° Banat is derived from the oldest arms of the Habsburg family, which were: Or a lion rampant gules armed langued and crowned azure. The arms denote the land as the Emperor's personal possession (hence the lion, only without the crown, and the colours, or and gules reversed and azure excluded, or in its place), which is situated at the border with the Ottoman Empire (hence the sabre in lion's paw). The coat of arms is nowadays used only in the part of Banat in Vojvodina. The coat of arms of the part of Banat in Romania is partly based on it, too: gules over waves azure a bridge with two arched openings or wherefrom issuing a demi-lion or holding a sabre in its right forepaw. Half of the lion also appears on the arms of Timi»ô County in Romania. *Srem. The third coat of arms is that of Srem, granted in 1747 by Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. The modern Croatian county of Vukovar-Syrmia uses the same coat of arms. The three white stripes on blue, representing the three rivers of Srem: Bosut, Sava and Danube. A deer rests close to a green poplar (topola) tree. The tree changed throughout history. In the original grant the tree was a cypress tree. The modern Croatian design preferred it to make it an oak tree, which is abundant in the region and is a kind of a national symbol. Similarly, the poplar is connected to Serbia (The royal family stems from a place named Topola). Historical coat of arms The historical coat of arms of Serbian Vojvodina was adopted in 1848. In its central part is a Serbian cross. On the left and right side are a small coats of arms of the four historical regions of Serbian Vojvodina: Srem (upper left), Banat (upper right), Baƒçka (bottom left), and Baranja (bottom right). On the top is a Crown of Saint Stephen. The crown was placed on the coat of arms because the first intention of Serbs was to create Serbian Vojvodina, which would be autonomous region within the Kingdom of Hungary, but since the war between Serbs and Hungarians started, the intention was changed into one that Serbian Vojvodina should be completely separated from the Kingdom of Hungary and directly subordinated to Vienna. On March 17, 2015, the Assembly of Vojvodina failed to meet two-thirds of votes on the legislation of parallel use of the historical coat of arms and flag from 1848.http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/politika/aktuelno.289.html:539049-Demokrate- pogazile-rec-i-grb –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—ò—Å–∫–∏ –≥—Ä–± –°—Ä–ø—Å–∫–µ –í–æ—ò–≤–æ–¥–∏–Ω–µ –∏–∑ 1848.jpgCoat of arms of Serbian Vojvodina from 1848, with four emblems, used by the Zemun's People Guard File:–ì—Ä–± –°—Ä–ø—Å–∫–æ–≥ –í–æ—ò–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –Ω–∞ –°–ª—É–∂–±–µ–Ω–æ–º –±–∏–ª—Ç–µ–Ω—É –∏–∑ 1848.jpgCoat of arms of the Serbian Duchy of Official bulletin from 1848 Coat of arms of Serbian Vojvodina.svgCoat of arms of Serbian Vojvodina from 1848 File:–ê—Å–∏–≥–Ω–∞—Ç –∏–∑ 1848. –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–µ. –≥—Ä–± –°—Ä–ø—Å–∫–µ –í–æ—ò–≤–æ–¥–∏–Ω–µ.jpgFour emblems on the coat of arm of Serbian Vojvodina from 1848 See also *Flag of Vojvodina *Coat of arms of Serbia References Culture of Vojvodina Vojvodina Vojvodina Vojvodina Vojvodina Vojvodina Vojvodina Vojvodina ","title":"Coat of arms of Vojvodina"},{"id":"1775829","title":"Terry McGovern (actor)"},{"id":"1775833","text":"An anti-Mormon political cartoon from the late 19th century. Anti-Mormonism is discrimination, persecution, hostility or prejudice directed against the Latter Day Saint movement, particularly The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints (LDS Church). The term is often used to describe people or literature that are critical of their adherents, institutions, or beliefs, or physical attacks against specific Saints or the Latter Day Saint movement as a whole. Opposition to Mormonism began before the first Latter Day Saint church was established in 1830 and continues to the present day. The most vocal and strident opposition occurred during the 19th century, particularly during the Utah War of the 1850s, and in the second half of the century when the practice of polygamy in Utah Territory was widely considered by the U.S. Republican Party as one of the \\"twin relics of barbarism\\" along with slavery. Modern-day opposition generally takes the form of websites, podcasts, videos or other media offering alternative views about Mormonism or non-violent protest at large Latter-day Saint gatherings such as the church's semiannual General Conference, outside of Latter-day Saint pageants, or at events surrounding the construction of new LDS temples. Opponents generally believe that the church's claims to divine origin are false, that it is non-Christian, or that it is a religion based on fraud or deceit on the part of its past and present leaders. The FBI began tracking anti-Mormon hate crimes in the United States in 2015 and have noted an increase in incidents over time. Origin The term, \\"anti- Mormon\\" first appears in the historical record in 1833 by the Louisville (Kentucky) Daily Herald in an article, \\"The Mormons and the Anti-Mormons\\" (the article was also the first known to label believers in the Book of Mormon as \\"Mormons\\").Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. \\"Mormon\\". In 1841, it was revealed that an Anti-Mormon Almanac would be published. On August 16 of that year, the Latter Day Saint Times and Seasons reported the Mormons' confidence that although the Anti-Mormon Almanac was designed by \\"Satan and his emissaries\\" to flood the world with \\"lies and evil reports\\", still \\"we are assured that in the providence of God they will ultimately tend to the glory of God‚Äîthe spread of truth and the good of the church\\".Times and Seasons, vol. 2 no. 20, August 16, 1841, p. 513. Mormonism had been criticized strongly by dozens of publications since its inception, most notably by Eber D. Howe's 1834 book Mormonism Unvailed. The Latter Day Saints initially labeled such publications \\"anti-Christian\\",cf. Latter Day Saints' Messenger and Advocate, vol. 3, no. 1, October 1836, p. 319. but the publication of the Almanac and the subsequent formation of an \\"Anti-Mormon Party\\" in Illinois heralded a shift in terminology. \\"Anti-Mormon\\" became, on the lips of the church's critics, a proud and politically charged self-designation.A similar party would arise in Utah in 1883, professing to be \\"'anti-Mormon' ... to the heart's core.\\" Cf. Jennifer Hansen, Letters of Catharine Cottam Romney, p. 76. See also Liberal Party (Utah). Today, the term is primarily used as a descriptor for persons and publications that oppose the LDS Church, although its precise scope has been the subject of some debate. It is used by some to describe anything perceived as critical of the LDS Church.Some examples of Mormons expressing this sort of sentiment are as follows: \\"Are You an Anti-Mormon? \\", AntiMormon.KeepRight.net, accessed June 2006. \\"Correspondence between James White and Dr. Louis Midgley\\", SHIELDS-Research.org, accessed June 2006. & \\"How I define an Anti-Mormon\\", FAIR Message Boards, accessed June 2006. Siding with the latter, less-inclusive understanding of the term, Latter-day Saint scholar William O. Nelson suggests in the Encyclopedia of Mormonism that the term includes \\"any hostile or polemic opposition to Mormonism or to the Latter-day Saints, such as maligning Joseph Smith, his successors, or the doctrines or practices of the Church. Though sometimes well intended, anti-Mormon publications have often taken the form of invective, falsehood, demeaning caricature, prejudice, and legal harassment, leading to both verbal and physical assault.\\" =Reaction= Many of those who have been labeled \\"anti- Mormon\\" object to the designation, arguing that the term implies that disagreement or criticism of Mormonism stems from some inherent \\"anti-Mormon\\" prejudice, rather than being part of a legitimate factual or religious debate. Eric Johnson, for example, makes a distinction between \\"personal animosity and intellectual dialogue\\". Johnson insists that he is motivated by \\"love and compassion for Mormons\\", and that while he \\"[might] plead guilty to being against Mormonism\\", he finds the suggestion that he is anti-Mormon \\"both offensive and inaccurate.\\" Stephen Cannon elaborates, > It is also helpful to know that Mormons are a group of people united around > a belief system. Therefore, to be \\"anti-Mormon\\" is to be against people. > Christians who desire to communicate the Gospel of Jesus Christ to Mormons > are never to come against people of any stripe. Yes, evangelical Christians > do have strong disagreements with Mormonism, but the argument is with a > belief system and not a people. The LDS people are no better or no worse > than any other group of people. Any dispute is to be a disagreement with the > \\"ism\\", not the \\"Mormon\\". James White, meanwhile, rejects the term because of a lack of reciprocal terminology. He wrote to one LDS apologist, \\"If you will identify yourself as an anti-Baptist, I'll let you call me an anti-Mormon.\\" Even some members of the church who write negatively about it, especially those who call into question its divine nature, have had their writings labeled anti-Mormon. Ex- Mormons who write about the church are likewise frequently labeled anti- Mormon, even when their writings are not inflammatory in nature. The debate on who is \\"anti-Mormon\\" frequently arises in Mormon discussions of authors and sources.E.g.: ; ; Stephen Cannon has argued that use of the label is a \\"campaign by Latter-day Saints to disavow the facts presented by simply labeling the source as 'anti-Mormon'\\". Critics of the term also claim that the LDS Church frames the context of persecution in order to cultivate a persecution complex, or that Mormon authors promote the ideal of a promised heavenly reward for enduring persecution for one's beliefs. Those individuals and groups who challenge Mormonism, particularly those who approach the challenge from an evangelical Christian perspective, would generally sustain that they do, in fact, have the best interest of the Mormon at heart; and for the most part can legitimately claim to understand what the church teaches, since many challengers of Mormonism come from an LDS background. In addition, they often declare that highly charged words such as \\"hatred\\" and \\"bigotry\\" are employed to an excessive degree to describe any challenge to a truth claim, and often cite this reactionary response as part of a Mormon \\"persecution complex.\\" History lithograph of Smith's body about to be mutilated (Library of Congress). Mormonism, or the Latter Day Saint movement, arose in western New York, the area where its founder, Joseph Smith, was raised, during a period of religious revival in the early 19th century. Smith claimed to have several visions involving God, Jesus and angelic Native American prophets. These claims were often not received well by those in the community, as evident in the following excerpt from Smith's account of LDS Church history: > ... one of the Methodist preachers ... treated my communication ... with > great contempt, saying it was all of the devil, that there were no such > things as visions or revelations in these days; that all such things had > ceased with the apostles, and that there would never be any more of them. I > soon found, however, that my telling the story had excited a great deal of > prejudice against me among professors of religion, and was the cause of > great persecution, which continued to increase; and though I was an obscure > boy, only between fourteen and fifteen years of age, and my circumstances in > life such as to make a boy of no consequence in the world, yet men of high > standing would take notice sufficient to excite the public mind against me, > and create a bitter persecution; and this was common among all the sects‚Äîall > united to persecute me. While the claims of a divine call often received a cold shoulder, the eventual publication of the Book of Mormon,Latter-day Saints consider the Book of Mormon, which Smith stated that he translated from golden plates, to be a work of scripture of similar importance to the Bible. and the official organization of the Church of Christ in 1830 were met with increased opposition on various fronts. Title page of one of the earliest anti-Mormon publications, E. D. Howe's Mormonism Unvailed: Or, A Faithful Account of that Singular Imposition and Delusion, from its Rise to the Present Time (1834), which claimed that the Book of Mormon was written by Solomon Spalding. In New York and Pennsylvania, anti-Mormonism dealt mainly with issues including whether or not Smith actually had the gold plates; whether those plates belonged to the people rather than Smith; whether or not Smith ever really had had visions (at least ones of theological import); Smith's treasure-digging episodes; and alleged occult practices by Smith. In Ohio, anti-Mormons focused on the ill-fated banking efforts of the Kirtland Safety Society and other failed economic experiments including the United Order. In Missouri, once the gathering place of the Latter Day Saints, Mormons tended to vote as a bloc, wielding \\"considerable political and economic influence,\\" often unseating local political leadership and earning long-lasting enmity in the sometimes hard- drinking, hard-living frontier communities. These differences culminated in hostilities and the eventual issuing of an executive order (since called the Extermination Order) by Missouri governor Lilburn Boggs declaring \\"the Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State.\\" Three days later, a renegade militia unit attacked a Mormon settlement at Haun's Mill, resulting in the death of 18 Mormons and no militiamen. The Extermination Order was not formally rescinded until 1976. In Nauvoo, Illinois, persecutions were often based on the tendency of Mormons to \\"dominate community, economic, and political life wherever they resided.\\" The city of Nauvoo had become the largest in Illinois, the city council was predominantly Mormon, and the Nauvoo Legion (the Mormon militia) had grown to a quarter of the size of the U.S. Army. Other issues of contention included polygamy, freedom of speech, anti-slavery views during Smith's presidential campaign, and the deification of man. After the destruction of the press of the Nauvoo Expositor and institution of martial law, Joseph Smith was arrested on charges of treason against the state of Illinois and incarcerated in Carthage Jail where he was killed by a mob on June 27, 1844. The persecution in Illinois became so severe that most of the residents of Nauvoo fled across the Mississippi River in February 1846. In 1847 Mormons established a community hundreds of miles away in the Salt Lake Valley in Utah. Beginning in 1849, every Federally appointed official left Utah under duress. In 1857 President Buchanan concluded that the Mormons in the territory were rebelling against the United States. In response, President Buchanan sent one-third of the United States army to Utah in 1857 in what is known as the Utah War. =Early publications= Much of this anti-Mormon sentiment was expressed in publications during the early part of LDS Church history. In his 2005 biography of Joseph Smith, Richard Lyman Bushman cites four 1838 pamphlets as anti-Mormon: Mormonism Exposed by Sunderland, Mormonism Exposed by Bacheler, Antidote to Mormonism by M'Chesney, and Exposure of Mormonism by Livesey.Bushman, pp. 398‚Äì402. The first was the work of Origen Bacheler, who had no direct contact with the body of Mormons, and contained the contents of a debate between the author and Parley Pratt, with Pratt's side omitted. Bushman describes the author's rhetoric as indistinguishable from that uttered by \\"scores of other polemicists of his time,\\" providing a glimpse into the kind of material considered anti-Mormon. The pamphlet described Joseph Smith as a \\"blockhead,\\" a \\"juggling, money-digging, fortune-telling impostor\\" and, along with the Book of Mormon witnesses, as \\"perhaps the most infamous liars and impostors that ever breathed. ... By their deception and lies, they swindle them out of their property, disturb social order and the public peace, excite a spirit of ferocity and murder, and lead multitudes astray on the subject in which, of all others, they have the deepest interest.\\" He voiced outrage at \\"the miscreants who are battening on the ignorance and credulity of those upon whom they can successfully play off this imposture.\\" He described the Book of Mormon as, \\"the most gross, the most ridiculous, the most imbecile, the most contemptible concern, that was ever attempted to be palmed off upon society as a revelation.\\" He believed the religion \\"can be viewed in no other light than that of monstrous public nuisances, that ought forthwith to be abated\\" and that the Mormons were \\"the most vile, the most impudent, the most impious, knot of charlatans and cheat with which any community was ever disgraced and cursed.\\" Antidote to Mormonism describes Mormons as \\"miserable enemies of both God and man‚Äîengines of death and hell.\\" He described combat with them as being \\"desperate, the battle is one of extermination.\\" Bushman describes the characteristics of these anti-Mormon materials as sensationalizing actuality:Bushman, p. 401. British author Arthur Conan Doyle's A Study in Scarlet (1887), the novel in which the famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes made his first appearance, includes a very negative depiction of the early Mormon community in Utah after its migration westwards and the foundation of Salt Lake City. Mormons are presented as violent, rigidly intolerant and corrupt, systematically terrorizing members of the church and forcing polygamous marriage on Mormon girls against their will Later in his career, Conan Doyle apologized to the Mormons for his depiction of their religion. During a 1923 tour of the United States, Doyle was invited to speak at the LDS Church's Salt Lake Tabernacle; while some individual Mormons remained deeply upset over the negative depiction, in general the Mormons present received him warmly. Page D1. Reprinted at historytogo.utah.gov by the Utah State Historical Society. Forms Vehement opposition to the LDS Church comes from individuals or groups associated with the Christian countercult movement, which is mostly an evangelical Christian phenomenon. In the 21st century opposition to Mormonism has become frequent among Secular or New Atheist groups. =Religious anti-Mormonism= Among those with religious motives, Daniel C. Peterson has identified two major streams of modern anti-Mormon thought. The first is \\"traditional anti- Mormonism\\", typified by Rev. Wesley Walters, Jerald and Sandra Tanner, and (to a certain extent) self-proclaimed \\"Bible Answer Man\\" and \\"cult expert\\" Walter Martin. Anti-Mormons in this category, \\"anxious to be taken seriously by at least a portion of the scholarly community,\\" generally try to explain Mormonism in naturalistic terms. They appeal to \\"Joseph Smith's environment and his (wicked or pathological) character, perhaps assisted by a co- conspirator or two\\", as a sufficient explanation for Mormon origins.Introvigne, pp. 154,158. Cf. also Peterson, pp. 231‚Äì260. \\"New Age anti-Mormonism\\", according to Peterson, \\"is quite different. It admits the presence of supernatural events in the founding events of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and is quite willing to acknowledge continuous supernatural influence in the life of the Church today.\\" However, \\"unlike faithful Latter-day Saints, New Age anti-Mormons see the supernatural agents involved in the founding and progress of the Church as demonic, occultic, diabolical, luciferian.\\"Introvigne, p. 154. This \\"New Age anti-Mormon\\" grouping includes Ed Decker, Loftes Tryk, James R. Spencer and many others. According to Introvigne, New Age anti-Mormonism emerged in the 1980s largely as a result of the rise of Third-wave Pentecostalism and its emphasis on spiritual warfare.Introvigne, pp. 159‚Äì161. Cf. fn. on p. 158 for a few exceptions to the 1980s date. Traditional anti-Mormons, according to Peterson, are those who \\"are content to argue that Mormonism is untrue\\" and \\"incompatible with the Bible.\\"Peterson, pp. 231‚Äì260. While some may believe that Satan was indirectly involved in the founding of the LDS Church, they place little emphasis on his role. For them, naturalistic and historical explanations are always preferable to supernatural ones.Introvigne, p. 158. Among the most prominent of the traditional anti-Mormons are Jerald and Sandra Tanner. Both former members of the LDS Church, the Tanners converted to evangelical Protestantism and in 1964 founded the Modern Microfilm Company to \\"document problems with the claims of Mormonism and to compare LDS doctrines with Christianity.\\" In 1983 they turned their company into a non-profit organization and renamed it the Utah Lighthouse Ministry. The Tanners' work has included \\"publishing [reprints of] many hard-to-find Mormon historical documents\\" and \\"[debating] virtually every significant topic in Mormonism\\".Foster, Lawrence (1984) \\"Career Apostates: Reflections on the Works of Jerald and Sandra Tanner\\", Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, 17 (2), 35,39. During their prolific career they have published more than two hundred items on a variety of social, doctrinal, and historical issues. Despite the high caliber of some of their work,\\"Jerald is a brilliant analyst of detail, with an almost uncanny ability to spot textual inconsistencies which call for explanation. His analysis showing that a pamphlet attributed to Oliver Cowdery was, in fact, a clever forgery, is only one example of research and analysis that would do credit to any professional historian.\\" Foster, Lawrence (1984) \\"Career Apostates: Reflections on the Works of Jerald and Sandra Tanner\\", Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, 17 (2), 47. the Tanners have been criticized on a number of points: notably for the vitriolic tone of some of their more polemical pieces, their resistance to change, and their unauthorized publication of several copyrighted documents.See also , , , In recent years, the apologists' wrath toward the Tanners has somewhat subsided. In their study of anti-Mormon \\"word games\\", for example, Daniel C. Peterson and Stephen D. Ricks have nothing negative to say about them. Instead, they enlist them as allies against New Age anti-Mormons like Ed Decker, whose fabrications the Tanners have denounced on more than one occasion.Peterson and Ricks, 13 fn. 39, 14 fn. 42. Perhaps the most controversial of the traditional anti-Mormons, however, was Walter Martin. Martin saw Mormons as deceivers who \\"pose as Christians\\". He called them \\"anti-Christian\\" and \\"a cult infiltration\\" and said they secretly harbor a \\"deep contempt for Christians\\". He further accused them of being egomaniacs and \\"cultists\\".Cited in Peterson and Ricks, pp. 5, 9‚Äì11. See also Millet, Robert (2005). A Different Jesus? The Christ of the Latter-day Saints. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans, 178‚Äì179. Martin left as his legacy the Christian Research Institute. New Age anti- Mormons have generated considerably more controversy than the previous category. The most prominent of their number, Ed Decker, is the producer of The God Makers and The God Makers II, as well as being the author of the books by the same name. The God Makers has attracted criticism not only from Latter- day Saints,According to Michael Griffith, \\"Even as anti-Mormon books go, THE GODMAKERS is one of the worst, most inaccurate attacks on Mormonism ever written.\\" . Says Introvigne, \\"the second book and film are worse than the first: they include an explicit call to hatred and intolerance that has been denounced as such by a number of Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish organizations.\\" Introvigne, p. 154. but from traditional anti-Mormons as well.His writings were described by Carl Mosser in Saints Alive in Jesus: Ed Decker ‚Äì The Godmakers as follows: > Decker is infamous for the mistakes he makes describing Mormon doctrine, the > sensationalist claims he has made about Mormon rituals and leaders, and the > generally uncharitable attitude with which he conducts his ministry.

The Mormon will be repulsed and hardened, the Christian > misinformed. See also Tanner, Jerald and Sandra (1993). Problems in The Godmakers II. Salt Lake City, UT: UTLM. The film is generally considered acerbic and misleading, and has even provoked bomb threats against LDS meetinghouses and death threats against members.Peterson and Ricks, pp. 4‚Äì5 fn. 6. In other publications Decker has asserted that the source of Mormonism is Satan and that the spires on the LDS temple \\"represent an upside down nail, pointing defiantly toward heaven‚Äîas if to impale the Lord Jesus anew when he comes in the clouds of glory!\\"Introvigne, pp. 158, 164. Furthermore, Decker sees Mormonism as a Satanic political conspiracy with roots in Hinduism and Baal worship.Peterson and Ricks, pp. 13‚Äì14. When Decker was denounced by Jerald and Sandra Tanner, he went so far as to accuse them of being in the pay of the LDS Church and even of being \\"demonized\\" themselves. Decker and his associates offered to exorcise the Tanners' demons, and expressed great sadness when they refused.Introvigne, pp. 166‚Äì167. The Christian writer William Schnoebelen asserted that \\"the marks on the Mormon Temple garments 'are held together by a subtle occult web of sexual energy which is activated by pressure from the two highest grips in the LDS Temple endowment.'\\" Tom Kellie similarly insisted that \\"the wives of Mormon apostles were compelled to submit to a special sexual type of operation.\\"Introvigne, p. 162. Decker later decided that Kellie was \\"either a deceiver or not working with a full deck.\\" Other New Age anti- Mormons have called Mormons \\"pagans\\" and Mormonism \\"a fountain of slime\\". Protests Protesters outside the site of the LDS general conference in 2006. Protesters have been visible as \\"street preachers\\" at LDS General Conferences, outside of LDS pageants, and temples. At the recently constructed Sacramento temple, for example, protesters dispersed pamphlets to visitors who came to take a guided tour. They also held up signs directing people to websites critical of the LDS Church. Notably, protesters also made an appearance at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. One group that actively organizes peaceful protests, a non-profit organization called Mormonism Research Ministry, insists that its activities are not \\"anti- Mormon\\". > Our goal at MRM is not to be antagonistic. In fact, whenever a > representative of MRM speaks publicly on this subject, we often emphasize > how Christians should reflect a Christ-like attitude when sharing their > faith. We must be firm in our convictions but compassionate and patient as > well. ... It is true that, just as some Mormons want nothing more than to > ridicule and insult those with whom they disagree, some Christians have done > the same. This is wrong and always will be wrong. Some other individuals have been seen throwing copies of the Book of Mormon on the ground, stepping on them, and portray using temple garments, which LDS hold sacred, as toilet tissue, and other similarly offensive actions. However, nearly every evangelical ministry, including those that actively challenge truth claims of Mormonism, vehemently condemns this sort of offensive and belligerent behavior, and further object to being placed in the same category as those few who engage in such behavior. As a result of organized protests at Mormon events, a number of Latter-day Saints, and even non-Mormons, have begun to counter-demonstrate at events (by singing hymns, for example). Despite the disrespect evinced by some protesters, at least one Latter-day Saint scholar has called on his fellow Mormons to \\"love the street preachers\\". =Secular anti-Mormonism= Opposition to Mormonism has been more prominent in the 21st century from New Atheism perspectives. Richard Dawkins, Bill Maher and John Dehlin are among those who more prominent individuals who have used media appearances or podcasts to oppose the Institutional LDS Church and its doctrines and policies. Legal In March 2014, a court case was brought against LDS Church president Thomas S. Monson in the United Kingdom. Monson was accused by disaffected member Tom Phillips of breaching the Fraud Act 2006. The summons alleged that two men were induced to pay tithes to the LDS Church by church teachings which are objectively untrue. The alleged untrue teachings were: * Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon from ancient gold plates and it is historically accurate; and * Native Americans are descended from Israelites who left Jerusalem in 600 BC. The court case was tossed out before trial.Mormon leader \\"Thomas Monson fraud case thrown out\\", BBC News, 2014-03-20. The judges dismissed the case with stark language.\\"Thomas S. Monson, LDS Church President, Escapes Fraud Trial, British Court Drops Case\\", Huffington Post, 2014-03-20. Violence Tangible acts of violence against Latter-day Saints are considerably less common in the United States today than they were in the 19th century. The first significant violent persecution occurred in the early 1830s in Missouri. Mormons tended to vote as a bloc there, wielding \\"considerable political and economic influence,\\" often unseating local political leadership and earning long-lasting enmity in the frontier communities. These differences culminated in the Missouri Mormon War and the eventual issuing of an executive order (since called the extermination order within the LDS community) by Missouri governor Lilburn Boggs, which declared that \\"the Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State.\\" Three days later, a renegade militia unit attacked a Mormon settlement at Haun's Mill, resulting in the death of 18 Mormons and no militiamen. The extermination order was not formally rescinded until 1976. After the destruction of the press of the Nauvoo Expositor in Nauvoo, Illinois, Joseph Smith was arrested and incarcerated in Carthage Jail where he was killed by a mob on June 27, 1844. The persecution in Illinois became so severe that most of the residents of Nauvoo fled across the Mississippi River in February 1846. Even after Mormons established a community hundreds of miles away in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, anti-Mormon activists in Utah Territory convinced U.S. President James Buchanan that the Mormons in the territory were rebelling against the United States; critics pointed to plural marriage as a sign of the rebellion. In response, President Buchanan sent one-third of the American standing army in 1857 to Utah in what is known as the Utah War. More recent persecution against Mormons in the U.S. has occasionally taken the shape of acts of vandalism against church property (see Protests against Proposition 8 supporters).Cf. At an LDS Church building in Orangevale, Sacramento County, vandals spray painted \\"No on 8\\" and \\"No on Prop 8\\" on the front sign and sidewalk. An affiliate group of the radical Trans/Queer organization Bash Back!, claims credit for pouring glue into the locks of an LDS Church building and spray painting on its walls. An internet posting signed by Bash Back!'s Olympia chapter said: \\"The Mormon church ... needs to be confronted, attacked, subverted and destroyed.\\" According to the Chicago Tribune, the acts of vandalism against the LDS Church appear to be in retaliation for support of Proposition 8. Police reported that nine church buildings were also damaged in Utah that month. The Anti-Defamation League released a statement condemning the \\"defacement and destruction of property.\\" In November 2008, the United States Postal Service delivered envelopes containing white powder to two LDS Church temples‚Äîthe Los Angeles California Temple and the Salt Lake Temple‚Äîand to the Knights of Columbus' national headquarters in New Haven, Connecticut, prompting a hazardous materials response and a federal domestic terrorism investigation. The LDS Church blamed opponents of the marriage ban for sending the hoax mailings, while a group that also supported the measure condemned \\"acts of domestic terrorism against our supporters.\\" LGBT rights groups, such as Equality Utah and Equality California, have spoken out against the use of violence in protests, and note that the source of the \\"white powder\\" mailings has not been determined. In Latin America, however, hatred of Mormons has often taken on a much deadlier form. In May 1989, members of a terrorist organization called the Zarate Willka Armed Forces of Liberation murdered two Mormon missionaries in La Paz, Bolivia. Another Bolivian terrorist group, the Tupac Katari Guerrilla Army, claimed responsibility for two attacks against Mormon chapels. The Latauro Youth Movement in Chile conducted 27 small-scale bombings against LDS meetinghouses in 1992. The MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base lists 149 individual attacks that have been carried out against Mormon targets in Latin America since 1983. It also lists a 2001 chapel-bombing in Croatia. Responses =Official= Although a position on anti-Mormonism is not part of the official doctrine of the LDS Church, it has been mentioned specifically in a number of general conference talks made by church general authorities. Marvin J. Ashton, speaking as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, began a fall 1982 conference by relating an experience he had with a protester outside Temple Square. He went on to declare \\"[t]o the world, and especially to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\\" that \\"there is no time for contention.\\" He then quoted Robert Frost in his prescribed response to anti-Mormonism: > The poet Robert Frost once defined education as \\"the ability to listen to > almost anything without losing your temper or your self-confidence.\\" > Probably we will never be free of those who are openly anti-Mormon. > Therefore, we encourage all our members to refuse to become anti-anti- > Mormon. In the wise words of old, can we \\"live and let live\\"? Carlos E. Asay of the Presidency of the First Quorum of the Seventy spoke in the fall 1981 conference concerning opposition to the LDS Church. He describes \\"Lucifer\\" as the source of at least some anti-Mormon and apostate groups, relates an experience of a Mormon convert being excommunicated and encourages the avoidance of \\"those who would tear down your faith\\": > Since the spring of 1820, Lucifer has led a relentless attack against the > Latter-day Saints and their leaders. A parade of anti-Christs, anti-Mormons, > and apostate groups have appeared on the scene. Many are still among us and > have released new floods of lies and false accusations. These faith-killers > and testimony-thieves use personal contacts, the printed word, electronic > media, and other means of communication to sow doubts and to disturb the > peace of true believers. Two months ago we received a tender letter from a > bishop. He informed us that he had been involved in an excommunication of a > recent convert. The new convert had fallen under the influence of a very > dedicated apostate who was successful in destroying the convert's testimony. > It seems that, to discredit Joseph Smith and subsequent prophets, the > apostate cited changes made in Church publications over the years. The > approach used by the apostate is common among those who are more interested > in shadows than in light. Their logic, if followed, would have them burning > the New Testament because Luke's account of the gospel is not exactly like > Matthew's or because the book of Acts reports two differing versions of > Paul's vision on the road to Damascus. (See Acts 9:1‚Äì9 and Acts 22:4‚Äì11.) > Belief in modern prophets and continuous revelation is absent in the lives > of many apostates. They would pin their hopes for salvation upon things > other than those related to living prophets and living faith. ... Avoid > those who would tear down your faith. Faith-killers are to be shunned. The > seeds which they plant in the minds and hearts of men grow like cancer and > eat away the Spirit. Gordon B. Hinckley, the president of the LDS Church, related a story in the fall 1997 conference in which he read from the letter of an ex-Mormon who left the church at the urging of his fianc√©e, whom the letter-writer indicates is anti-Mormon. Hinckley describes the situation in the letter as a \\"terrible tragedy\\" and states that he \\"believe[s] the writer still has a testimony of this work. That testimony has been with him since the time he was baptized, but he has felt neglected and of no consequence to anyone.\\" A passage from an early Mormon epistle addresses a claimed tendency of ex-Mormons to criticize the church of which they are no longer a part: > [A]postates after turning from the faith of Christ ... have sooner or later > fallen into the snares of the wicked one, and have been left destitute of > the Spirit of God, to manifest their wickedness in the eyes of multitudes. > From apostates the faithful have received the severest persecutions ... > \\"When once that light which was in them is taken from them, they become as > much darkened as they were previously enlightened, and then, no marvel, if > all their power should be enlisted against the truth,\\" and they, Judas like, > seek the destruction of those who were their greatest benefactors. Although > sometimes mistaken for a direct quote from Joseph Smith, this passage occurs > in the book as part of \\"Excerpts from an Epistle of the Elders of the Church > in Kirtland to Their Brethren Abroad\\", edited by Oliver Cowdery and F. G. > Williams as published in The Evening and the Morning Star. In 1985, Vaughn J. Featherstone, a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of the LDS Church, addressed students at the church-owned Brigham Young University, calling anti-Mormon material \\"theological pornography that is damaging to the spirit,\\" stating that \\"none of it is worth casting an eye upon. Do not read the anti-Mormon materials. That is not the way you resolve questions about the truthfulness of the restored gospel.\\" =Apologetic= Mormon apologetics and members vary both in their perception of criticism and opposition, as well as what they see as falling under the umbrella of anti- Mormonism. Hugh Nibley, the author of voluminous works in response to books deemed anti-Mormon, including a chapter on how to write an anti-Mormon book, explained why he thinks ex-Mormons criticize the church: > Apostates usually become sometimes feverishly active, determined to prove to > the world and themselves that it is a fraud after all. What is that to them? > Apparently it is everything‚Äîit will not let them alone. At the other end of > the scale are those who hold no rancor and even retain a sentimental > affection for the Church‚Äîthey just don't believe the gospel. I know quite a > few of them. But how many of them can leave it alone? It haunts them all the > days of their life. No one who has ever had a testimony ever forgets or > denies that he once did have it‚Äîthat it was something that really happened > to him. Even for such people who do not have it anymore, a testimony cannot > be reduced to an illusion. Davis Bitton presented criteria on how to identify anti-Mormon material in a 2004 paper published for the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) entitled, \\"Spotting an Anti-Mormon Book.\\" He specifies inaccuracy, telling Mormons what they believe, strong preference for negative information, always showing \\"the church, its leaders, its people, and its beliefs in the worst possible light,\\" participating in anti-Mormon activities, denouncing the church, engaging in \\"behavior defiantly contrary to church standards,\\" unjustly claiming to be a Latter-day Saint, and indulging in \\"snide, disrespectful, cruel comments about the Saints and those they sustain as prophets\\" as characteristics of anti-Mormon books and authors. Additionally, he singles out publishers such as the Utah Gospel Mission and the Utah Lighthouse Ministry as being \\"anti-Mormon, at least in intent.\\" In another FARMS review, this time of New Approaches to the Book of Mormon: Explorations in Critical Methodology by Brent Lee Metcalfe, Bitton reveals more of his thoughts on the subject: > I am not entirely comfortable with labeling this an anti-Mormon work, for I > don't see hatred of the Church and a determination to destroy as the prime > motive behind it. On the other hand, whatever the intention of individual > authors, the label is not entirely misapplied either. In any case, one thing > is sure: the compilation will be exploited by the Mormon-haters. Others consider the definition of anti-Mormonism rather fundamentally: those in opposition to or against the LDS Church. While not including those who simply believe differently, it includes those who are actively engaged in opposing the LDS Church. Thus, a person's intelligence, honesty, qualification or accreditation do not make them anti-Mormon. Anti-Mormon arguments are those in opposition to the claims and institutional aims of the LDS Church, and anti-Mormons are those who spend a significant amount of time opposing the church via such arguments or otherwise. Many members of the LDS Church believe that since the church is sanctioned by God, Satan and his followers will seek to destroy it, with some even seeing this opposition as evidence that the LDS Church has divine origins. Some avoid anti-Mormon material, while others analyze and criticize it, such as William J. Hamblin, who addresses anti- Mormon attacks on the geography and archeology of the Book of Mormon in \\"Basic Methodological Problems with the Anti-Mormon Approach to the Geography and Archaeology of the Book of Mormon.\\" Other prominent LDS Church members note that the opposition from anti-Mormonism can actually be beneficial. As Hugh Nibley expressed it, \\"We need more anti-Mormon books. They keep us on our toes.\\" Michael R. Ash of the Foundation for Apologetic Information and Research (FAIR) dissected this viewpoint in \\"The Impact of Mormon Critics on LDS Scholarship,\\" concluding that the accusations of critics are helpful in encouraging and stimulating further research. Orson Pratt also seemed to invite criticism when he said: > Convince us of our errors of doctrine, if we have any, by reason, by logical > arguments, or by the word of God, and we will be ever grateful for the > information, and you will ever have the pleasing reflection that you have > been instruments in the hands of God of redeeming your fellow beings from > the darkness which you may see enveloping their minds. =Evangelical= Regarding the subject of Christian anti-Mormonism, Richard Mouw (President of the Fuller Theological Seminary) stated in 2004 at the Salt Lake Tabernacle in Salt Lake City, > I am now convinced that we ... have often seriously misrepresented the > beliefs and practices of the Mormon community. Indeed, let me state it > bluntly to the LDS folks here this evening: we have sinned against you. The > God of the Scriptures makes it clear that it is a terrible thing to bear > false witness against our neighbors, and we have been guilty of that sort of > transgression in things we have said about you. We have told you what you > believe without making a sincere effort first of all to ask you what you > believe...Indeed, we have even on occasion demonized you, weaving conspiracy > theories about what the LDS community is 'really' trying to accomplish in > the world., Mouw's remarks generated mixed reactions from members of the > evangelical community, ranging from heartfelt agreement to biting criticism. > , Mouw is not the only Christian calling for moderation. Similar pleas have been issued by David Rowe,Rowe, David L. (2005). I Love Mormons: A New Way to Share Christ with Latter-day Saints. Grand Rapids, MI: Baker. Carl Mosser, Francis J. Beckwith, Paul Owen,Mosser, Carl, Francis J. Beckwith, Paul Owen (2002). The New Mormon Challenge. Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan. Craig Blomberg,Blomberg, Craig and Stephen E. Robinson (1997). How Wide the Divide? A Mormon and an Evangelical in Conversation. Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity, 31‚Äì32. and others. Some church and parachurch groups have also made efforts to repair relations with the Mormons. In the 1980s, Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority \\"took some small steps toward Evangelical-Mormon cooperation for a shared social, political, and ethical agenda\\".Blomberg, Craig and Stephen E. Robinson (1997). How Wide the Divide? A Mormon and an Evangelical in Conversation. Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity, 25. More recently, a Pentecostal congregation in Provo, Utah held a public ceremony of repentance for its negative attitudes and actions toward the Latter-day Saint community.Dean Merrill, \\"A Peacemaker in Provo,\\" Christianity Today, February 2000. In 2001, the organization Standing Together, based in Lehi, Utah, was founded by a Baptist minister for the purpose of \\"building bridges of relationship and dialogue with ... The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\\" Standing Together hosts public seminars in which Evangelical scholar Greg Johnson and LDS scholar Robert Millet \\"communicate how they have maintained their friendship and at the same time discussed candidly their theological differences and concerns for one another.\\" However, Standing Together is most recognized for their activities at General Conference, where they literally stand together, taking up space to deny its use by those who come to be disruptive influences. Some traditional Christian churches and ministries, however, have expressed varying degrees of concern about the movement to abandon what they consider to be valid and cogent challenges to Mormon doctrine and teaching for the sake of \\"peaceful co-existence,\\" and yet at the same time do not wish to be categorized with the fringe Christian elements that seek to be openly disruptive and antagonistic toward the LDS community. =Political= In 2011, Rick Santorum was asked if Jon Huntsman and Mitt Romney would have problems in the 2012 presidential election cycle as Mormons. Santorum answered: > \\"I hope not. ‚Ä¶ I hope that people will look at the qualities of candidates > and look at what they believe and what they're for and look [at] their > records and then make a decision.\\" Joe Biden said, in a long response to a University of Pittsburgh student's question about how his own religious faith affected his philosophy of government: > I find it preposterous that in 2011 we're debating whether or not a man is > qualified or worthy of your vote based on whether or not his religion ... is > a disqualifying provision. ‚Ä¶ It is not. It is embarrassing and we should be > ashamed, anyone who thinks that way.\\" See also * American Party (Utah) * Anti-Christian sentiment ** Anti- Catholicism ** Anti-Protestantism ** Persecution of Eastern Orthodox Christians ** Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses * A Victim of the Mormons * Criticism of LDS Church * Ex-Mormon * Freedom of religion in the United States * Latter Day Saint martyrs * Latter Day Saints in popular culture * Mormonism and Christianity * Phrenology and the Latter Day Saint Movement * Portrayal of Mormons in comics Notes References  * External links * Basic Methodological Problems with the Anti-Mormon Approach to the Geography and Archaeology of the Book of Mormon published by the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) * Celsus and Modern Anti-Mormonism published on Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research * Anti-Mormon internet hub * Article on Anti-Mormon Publications published on LightPlanet.com * Anti-Mormon ‚Äì Evangelical Protestant view of how the term \\"anti-Mormon\\" is misused * Old Themes and Stereotypes Never Die: The Unchanging Ways of Anti-Mormons published on Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research * Tabernacle on Trial: Mormons Dismayed by Harsh Spotlight ‚Äì The Wall Street Journal By Suzanne Sataline, February 8, 2008; Page A1 * Anti-Mormonism and the Question of Religious Authenticity in Antebellum America (PDF) * Some Themes of Counter-Subversion: An Alalysis of Anti-Masonic, Anti-Catholic, and Anti-Mormon Literature * History of the Latter Day Saint movement Criticism of Mormonism Mormonism-related controversies Mormon studies Mormonism Mormonism Religious discrimination in the United States ","title":"Anti-Mormonism"},{"id":"1775844","text":"The Castro of Monte Valinhas, alternately the Castro of S√£o Jo√£o de Valinhas, is an archaeological site in Portugal, in the civil parish of Santa Eul√°lia, in the municipality of Arouca, notable for the discovery of important traces of human remains from the last 2000 years. History Its situation, overlooking the open-spaces in the valley, was used by successive communities throughout the centuries (since the Neolithic until the Middle Ages) for protection and defence. Although some artifacts may have indicated a presence since the Bronze Age, the reality is that there has not been any correspondent confirmation beyond the Iron Age. It was in this period that a defensive structure (castro) was established over Monte Valinhas, as well as along the southern and southeastern flanks, taking advantage of the granite rocks that exist there. Later, during the Roman period, the area was reoccupied, possibly after the 1st century: artifacts that include fragments of ceramics and glass, lithics and metals were discovered during archaeological investigations. Its strategic location attracted early settlers, but more important, medieval settlement during the Reconquista era, who utilized the hilltop and built a castle that lasted until the late 12th century or early 13th century, when it was abandoned. Archaeological study of the area began in at the end of the 1980s, by a team of investigators coordinated by Ant√≥nio Manuel Silva, whom identified the walled compound. These studies also concluded the investigations into the circular castro structure, discovering a fireplace in one of the human residences.Centro de Arqueologia de Arouca (2002), p.8 The site remains unclassified, and under study since 1996.

College softball is normally played by women at the Intercollegiate level, whereas college baseball is normally played by men. As with other intercollegiate sports, most college softball in the United States is played under the auspices of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) or the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). The NCAA writes the rules of play, while each sanctioning body supervises season-ending tournaments. The final rounds of the NCAA tournaments are known as the Women's College World Series (WCWS); one is held on each of the three levels of competition sanctioned by the NCAA. The 2007 Women's College World Series took place in Don E. Porter Hall of Fame Stadium in Oklahoma City near the site of the National Softball Hall of Fame in June after the regular season was over. The first NCAA Women's College World Series was held in 1982, while the first- ever WCWS was held in 1969 in Omaha, Nebraska (sponsored by the Amateur Softball Association and the Division of Girls' and Women's Sports) and annually thereafter. The tournament now starts with 64 teams from 16 different regions that compete in a double elimination round to start off the championship, called regional. The sixteen winners then enter a 'super regional', usually held at the higher seed's home ground, for a best-of-three series. The eight winners then enter a modified double elimination tournament to determine which team is the national champion. Instead of being a 'true' double-elimination tournament, the tournament is split up so there are two brackets, though the losers switch brackets. The winners of each of the brackets move onto a best-of-three championship. The tournament is largely dominated by Pac-12 Conference teams, who have combined to win 21 of the 27 NCAA Division I championships through 2008, including 10 wins from UCLA (1995 championship vacated) and 8 from University of Arizona. From 1969‚Äì79 and 1982‚Äì87, the WCWS was held in Omaha, Nebraska, where the Men's College World Series originated. In 1980‚Äì81, it was played in Norman, Oklahoma. In 1988‚Äì89, it was held in Sunnyvale, California. The finals have been played at the Amateur Softball Association's Don E. Porter Hall of Fame Stadium in Oklahoma City since 1990. Over 600 NCAA member colleges are sponsors of women's softball programs. The women's softball championships are held in divisions I, II, and III. Fast-pitch softball became an Olympic discipline starting with the XXVI Olympiad of 1996. However, the International Olympic Committee discontinued both softball and baseball as Olympics sports after the XXVIII Olympiad in 2008. In 2004 the International Softball Federation (ISF) held the first World University Softball Championship just two months after the 2004 Olympic competition. It was an eight country championship, with Team USA defeating Chinese Taipei for the gold medal. In 2006 the F√©d√©ration Internationale du Sport Universitaire (FISU) held the second World University Softball Championship in Taiwan, and in 2007 softball was added to the World University Games of FISU.  Junior College Softball  The National Junior College Athletic Association was founded on May 14, 1938, due to the fact that track teams from two year colleges wanted a chance to compete in the NCAA, they were rejected, thus resulting in the creation of the NJCAA which became open to all sports, although, women's sports were not part of the organization until 1975. Junior college softball programs compete with in the NJCAA or the national junior college athletic association, Within the NJCAA there are divisions I, II,& III just like the NCAA. Amongst the divisions, there are regions and conferences each team gets divided into, At the division I level there are 19 regions, At the division II level there are 18 regions and at the division III level there are only 9 regions, given it is the lowest grade of ‚Äúcompetition.\\" Every year at the end of the regional championships there is a national tournament as well. The Division I tournament is held in St. George, Utah Division II tournament is held in Clinton, Mississippi Division III tournament is held in Rochester, Minnesota. Getting recruited to play softball in college is difficult for anyone no matter what division a player wants to play in. According to the NCSA, only about 8% of high school softball players will compete at the college level, and approximately 1% will play Division 1 ball. So, why NJC AA? Junior colleges recruit thousands of elite athletes every year. In fact, many junior colleges are considered ‚Äúfeeder‚Äù schools for Division I universities. DI college coaches will turn to trusted junior colleges each year to fill roster spots. For many athletes, junior college or ‚ÄúJUCO‚Äù is a great way to knock out some core classes while honing athletic skills before moving on to a four-year university, as well as getting paying time. A softball player recruited into a big-time school as a freshman will likely face a lot of adversity to receive a starting spot and playing time. The junior college route allows athletes to secure playing time as freshmen and sophomores. There are many ways for athletes to become recruited although women's sports tend to be neglected. Although Flo Softball, really helps the cause. They are a softball recruiting page devoted to helping athletes get to the next level. Now to bring it back to JUCO level, they have a Junior College hot 100 sophomore list where softball players playing in any divisions I, II or III can get exposure and hopefully get recruited by big-time schools. Ideally softball players like to be recruited out of high school to a bigtime program. But, Jennifer Mckibben is there to help keep athletes motivated. Mckibben is a true Juco product herself.

Originally from Syria, where his brother was a prefect in Edessa, he became a monk in his early years and spent sixteen years in the Egyptian desert of Scete, where he was ordained a deacon in the monastery of St. John the Short. Afterward, he went to a monastery near Alexandria and continued to practice asceticism. When Pope Peter IV of Alexandria was enthroned on the See of St. Mark, he made Damian a private secretary, during which Damian earned much esteem for his goodness. After Peter's death in 569,Walsh, Michael J., \\"Damian of Alexandria\\", A New Dictionary of Saints: East and West, Liturgical Press, 2007 the bishops unanimously agreed to ordain him a patriarch. In addition to pastoring the church, he wrote many epistles and discourses, including a reaffirmation of the miaphysite and non-Chalcedonian views. He reigned for almost thirty-six years. Controversies While serving as Patriarch, Damian performed some controversial actions in trying to complete his predecessor's attempt to depose Patriarch Paul II of Antioch by traveling secretly to Antioch to install a replacement Patriarch. Although this action did not have the support of all the Syrian bishops, Damian had enough support to convene a meeting and choose a replacement. However, the Chalcedonian patriarch, probably Gregory of Antioch, discovered the plan and prevented it, forcing Damian and his colleagues to flee. Damian then went to Constantinople, where he consecrated some bishops and took part in a church council, which he later repudiated. The Synaxarium entry for Damian recounts the following two theological controversies in which he was involved:\\"The Departure of St. Damianos\\", Synaxarium readings at the Coptic Orthodox Church Network, accessed 20 July 2010. *The first involved some Melitians who drank wine before Communion, claiming that Jesus had given the disciples two cups at the Last Supper and that only for the second did he say \\"This is My Blood.\\" Damian explained that the first cup was the cup of the Jewish passover, which Jesus nullified with the second cup. Damian also informed them that the church canons ban those that eat before communion from partaking of the Eucharist. Damian's counsel persuaded some, but those who rejected his teaching were driven away. *The second involves Damian's dialogue with Patriarch Peter of Antioch, in which Damian accused his colleague of tritheism and was in turn accused of Sabellianism. Although Damian pulled support for his understanding of the Trinity from the Bible and from the teaching of the early church fathers, he was never able to persuade Peter and, as a result, he ordered that Peter's name not be mentioned in the Divine Liturgy while Peter remained alive. The schism between the Alexandrian and Antiochene churches lasted for almost a decade after Damian's death.Alois Grillmeier, Theresia Hainthaler, O.C. Dean, Christ in Christian Tradition, Vol.2, Pt.4, pp.75-81. Damian was very active in fighting views that he considered heretical, including not only tritheism, but also the Chalcedonians, Pope Leo's Tome, Bishop Julian of Halicarnassus, the Agnoetae, the Melitians, the Acephali, the Gaianites (supporters of a rival to Theodosius I), Stephen of Alexandria and Paul of Beth Ukame. The Barsanuphians split from the Acephali during the time of Damian and established their own episcopal hierarchy., p. 191. Although most of Damian's writings are lost, he did influence many writers in his own time, such as John of Parallos, who, like Damian, focused on combating heresy.

History The high school was established in 1938 due to the rapid expansion of nearby military posts at Fort Lewis. The cornerstone of the first Clover Park High School was laid June 28, 1938. According to the 1981 Clover Park yearbook, Klahowya, on February 23 of that year a fire destroyed the gym (where the fire had been started), the music center and the business department. Junior Alfred Shropshire was arrested and convicted for starting the fire. One wing of the original school is now used for the school district's Student Services Center. The class of 1963 was the leading edge of the Baby Boom and was the largest graduating class of CPHS. The class of 1964 was actually larger, but in 1963, the class of 1964 split in half and formed the rival school Lakes High School. Approximately 1100 students are enrolled each year. Their school mascot is the Warriors and the colors are kelly green, gold, and white. During the 2014/2015 school year the current principal, Tim Stults, took the reins from the former principal, John Seaton. In 2006, CPHS was listed in the OSPI (Washington State Office of Public Instruction) document The High Schools We Need: Improving an American Institution.http://www.k12.wa.us/research/pubdocs/HighSchoolsWeNeed.pdf The OSPI document states, \\"Clover Park is committed to maintaining high expectations for rigorous performance from students.\\" According to OSPI the evidence of effectiveness: > (1) Between 2002 and 2010, WASL scores increased by 30.4 percent in reading, > 4.4 percent in math, 43.7 percent in writing, and 6.9 percent in science. > (2) Over the past seven years, student achievement increased and the gaps > narrowed between the racial, ethnic, gender, cultural, and economic class > groups within the school. > (3) The annual dropout rate declined from 14.1 percent to 5.5 percent > between 2001 and 2010. > (4) The school successfully made adequate yearly progress in all areas in > 2005 and was not mandated to do a plan for improvement. > (5) The college retention rate of students who received the Bill and > Melinda Gates Scholarship as high school juniors averaged more than 75 > percent in each year 2002-2004. > (6) Retention of highly qualified faculty has increased over the last five > years. > Students Aerial photo of Clover Park High School. The building in the upper left is part of the old high school, which now houses the Clover Park School District administrative offices. Out of the approximate 1100 student body, 68 percent are minorities, and 69 percent receive a free or reduced lunch. 10.2% of the student population is transitional bilingual. 69% of the teachers hold master's degrees and 100% are considered \\"highly qualified\\" according to No Child Left Behind Guidelines. Smaller Learning Communities Program In August 2003, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation promised $540,000 over five years to the school to \\"support personalized learning environments where all students achieve.\\" The school is thus sometimes referred to as a \\"Gates Grant school,\\" in reference to the donation. The highly diverse school used the grant to engage in major restructuring as part of the \\"Smaller Learning Communities Program\\" (SLCP) which is intended to help large schools create smaller and safer communities within themselves. The program has received criticism, as parents complained that dividing the school into separate \\"houses\\" limited the selection of courses, and that attempts to \\"Raise the Bar\\" for all students had the effect of \\"dummying down\\" the challenges available to more able students.,Smith (WA09) - Press Release - Smith Announces Education Grants CPHS is now recognized as a leader in high school reform by the School Redesign Network at Stanford University and OSPI for the improvements in student learning and for narrowing the achievement gap.

During his reign, despite being barred from the city of Alexandria, he met with the Patriarch of Antioch as they worked to arrange the unification of their two churches. Life He was one of the great noblemen of Alexandria. Before he became a Pope, he was an overseer of the patriarchal court, then he became a priest for the church of Alexandria. Shortly afterwards, he was unanimously selected by the bishops and clergy of the Coptic Church to succeed Pope Damian of Alexandria as Patriarch. His biography was written by Severus Ibn al-Muqaffa in his History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria. His name does not appear in the standard biographical dictionaries of the Christian church. One possible reason for this omission is the fact that, as indicated in the History, the influence of the Council of Chalcedon's decisions were very strong at the time, both in Alexandria and in the court of Constantinople. Not only were Coptic bishops of this time not officially recognized, they were also forbidden to enter Alexandria. The Coptic church in Alexandria was understandably troubled by this arrangement, which was instituted under the reign of Tiberius II Constantine, and his local adjutant named Belisarius. This persecution continued after the death of Tiberius under his son, Maurice. After the murder of Maurice by Phocas, who had overthrown him earlier, the situation deteriorated still further. A citizen of Alexandria who adhered to the Council of Chalcedon's edicts, Eulogius of Alexandria, wrote a defamatory letter to Photas regarding Anastasius. Photas responded by issuing an order to his prefect in Alexandria that the important church of Cosmas and Damian, and all its dependent churches, be turned over to Eulogius, who became the recognized Patriarch of Alexandria. Anastasius, deeply saddened by this, left for a nearby monastery. With the increasing difficulties his church was facing domestically, Anastasius turned more of his attention toward improving relations with other churches. This led to closer contacts with the Church of Antioch. Athanasius I Gammolo, the new Patriarch of Antioch, did not share the support of the edicts of Chalcedon that his predecessor had. When Anastasius learned of Athanasius's succession there, he wrote him a letter commending him on his wisdom in retracting his predecessor's errors, and urged him to help establish closer relations, and perhaps even unity, between the churches of Alexandria and Antioch. Upon receiving the letter, Athanasius convened a council of his bishops regarding the proposal, and they decided to send a delegation to Alexandria to see if it would be possible to unite the two churches. Athanasius, with five of his bishops, set sail for Alexandria. The delegation arrived, and met with Anastasius, presumably outside of the city, as Anastasius was still barred from entering the city, possibly in the monastery in which Anastasius was staying. On the arrival of the delegation, Anastasius summoned all of his bishops and clergy. The leaders of the two churches embraced each other with a kiss of peace, and declared their two churches to be united in doctrine. The two patriarchs remained in the monastery for a month thereafter, discussing a wide variety of topics, including implementing their newfound unity. At the end of the month, Athanasius returned to Antioch. Anastasius spent the remaining years of his patriarchate attending to the affairs of his church, including its now closer relationship with Antioch. He also wrote prolifically on matters of theology. He is said to have written enough to have one book put out every year of his reign, presumably twelve books for the twelve years of his reign. Over the years, however, many of these writings have been lost. Veneration Anastasius is considered a saint by the Coptic Church. His feast day is celebrated on 18 December.Holweck, F. G.

A betaine is a specific type of zwitterion. Historically, the term was reserved for TMG (trimethylglycine) only. Biologically, TMG is involved in methylation reactions and detoxification of homocysteine. The pronunciation of the compound reflects its origin and first isolation from sugar beets (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris), and does not derive from the Greek letter beta (Œ≤), however, it often is pronounced beta- INE or BEE-tayn. In biological systems, many naturally occurring betaines serve as organic osmolytes. These are substances synthesized or taken up from the environment by cells for protection against osmotic stress, drought, high salinity, or high temperature. Intracellular accumulation of betaines permits water retention in cells, thus protecting from the effects of dehydration. This accumulation is non-perturbing to enzyme function, protein structure, and membrane integrity. Betaine is also a methyl donor of increasingly recognised significance in biology.  Glycine betaine  The chemical structure of trimethylglycine The original betaine, N,N,N-trimethylglycine, was named after its discovery in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris) in the nineteenth century.DNA Methylation and Complex Human Disease, Michel Neidhart It is a small N-trimethylated amino acid. It is a zwitterion, which cannot isomerize because there is no labile hydrogen atom attached to the nitrogen atom. This substance may be called glycine betaine to distinguish it from other betaines.  Commercial uses  Phosphonium betaines are intermediates in the Wittig reaction. The addition of betaine to polymerase chain reactions improves the amplification of DNA by reducing the formation of secondary structure in GC- rich regions. The addition of betaine has been reported to enhance the specificity of the polymerase chain reaction by eliminating the base pair composition dependence of DNA melting.

Tom Wilkinson portrayed him in live-action in the film Batman Begins. Falcone was also played by John Doman in the television series Gotham. John Turturro is scheduled to portray the character in The Batman. Publication history Carmine Falcone made his debut in the four-part story Batman: Year One written by Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli in 1987. In the comics, Falcone is a powerful Mafia chieftain nicknamed \\"The Roman\\", where his stranglehold over Gotham City's organized crime is referenced as \\"The Roman Empire\\" at least once. In Batman: Year One, his penthouse is designed in a Roman architectural style. Falcone appeared in the mini-series Batman: The Long Halloween by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale. The character is based on Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone from the 1972 film The Godfather. Loeb stated in an interview that he paralleled the Falcone family to that of the Corleone family: Falcone's power and wisdom akin to Vito Corleone, his son Alberto's personality and appearance that of Fredo Corleone, and his daughter Sofia's temper matching that of Sonny Corleone. Lastly, his elder son Mario's deportation to Sicily, physical appearance and desire to legitimize the Falcone family are all traits shared with Michael Corleone. Fictional character biography In a flashback in The Long Halloween, gangster Vincent Falcone brings his dying son, Carmine (who had been shot several times by his rival, Luigi Maroni), to Thomas Wayne. Fearing Maroni would finish the job at a public hospital, he begs Wayne, one of the city's best doctors, to perform surgery at Wayne Manor. A young Bruce Wayne watches his father save Falcone's life. Years later at Thomas and Martha Wayne's funeral, Carmine Falcone, in gratitude for Thomas having saved his life and now part of his father's crime family, tells Bruce that he can always ask a favor of him should he need it. In Batman: Year One, Falcone is shown to be the most powerful figure in Gotham City, with the unidentified mayor, the city council, GCPD Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb, Detective Arnold Flass, and much of Gotham's police force in his pocket and all of the city's criminal outfits under his control. His power comes under attack with the arrival of the mysterious vigilante Batman, who is actually Bruce himself. In one scene, Batman publicly crashes Falcone's dinner party to announce that all of the corrupt attendees will be delivered to justice.Batman #404. DC Comics. Despite Loeb's desperate attempts to stop him, Batman's attacks on Falcone's organization become even more brazen; at one point, Batman invades Falcone's home, strips him to his underwear, and leaves him hogtied to his bed. Humiliated, Falcone decides to have Batman killed. Batman is too elusive, however, and further embarrasses Falcone by rescuing a thief calling herself Catwoman when the mobster and his henchmen catch her trying to rob them. In the process, Catwoman leaves Falcone permanently scarred when she scratches him with the metal claws of her costume. Finally, Falcone orders his nephew Johnny Viti to kidnap the family of Detective Jim Gordon, Batman's ally, but the attempt is foiled. When Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent's investigations start threatening his power, Falcone orders an unsuccessful hit on Johnny out of fear that he might talk. The failed hit results in the Falcone family getting embroiled in a mob war with Viti's boss Carla in Chicago, who despite being Carmine's sister is enraged by her brother's actions. The war serves only to further diminish Falcone's influence in Gotham. During The Long Halloween, the weakened Falcone family is targeted by a serial killer named Holiday. Falcone demonstrates his wiliness by using a careful mix of murder and influence to protect his family from police investigation.Batman: The Long Halloween #3 The situation changes when Batman and Dent discover one of Falcone's warehouses, containing millions in stockpiled cash. They burn the money, striking a blow against Falcone he cannot ignore. This drives him to take desperate measures, hiring costumed \\"freaks\\" in the form of what becomes Batman's Rogues Gallery. Infuriated by Dent's efforts to disrupt his operations (and convinced that Dent is secretly Holiday) he persuades his former rival Sal Maroni to kill Dent while standing trial for murder. Falcone arranges for Maroni to obtain a vial of acid, which he hurls at Dent during a court proceeding on August 2, Falcone's birthday. The acid disfigures the left side of Dent's face, leading to him becoming Two- Face. At the story's climax, Two-Face leads the rest of Batman's Rogues Gallery (consisting of Catwoman, Joker, Mad Hatter, Penguin, Poison Ivy, Scarecrow, and Solomon Grundy) on a raid of Falcone's private penthouse. Two- Face then personally kills Falcone following a coin flip that lands on the scarred side.Batman: The Long Halloween #11. DC Comics. Falcone's son Alberto ultimately confesses to all of the Holiday killings in an attempt to be accepted into the family business.Batman: The Long Halloween #8. DC Comics. In Batman: Dark Victory, Falcone's grave site is robbed and his body goes missing. His finger is cut off and sent to his daughter, Sofia Gigante, the new leader of the Falcone family. She recognizes this as a \\"old-style message\\", signifying that someone is out to take everything away from the Falcones. Alberto is placed under house arrest to keep him safe, and he begins to hear his father's voice in the home. Ultimately, the dead body of corrupt District Attorney Janice Porter, a former ally of Carmine's, ends up in Alberto's bed while he is sleeping. His father appears in a mirror, calls him a failure, and urges him to commit suicide. Knowing that his father abhorred suicide, Alberto figures out that the voice is part of a ruse, and shoots the mirror: The voice of his father turns out to be Calendar Man, who then shoots him as he tries to escape. When Batman and Gordon investigate, they find secret passages for the Calendar Man to move freely about the house. They then learn that Scarecrow had laced Alberto's cigarettes with fear toxin. Not until the end is it revealed that Two-Face has Falcone's body in his possession, having frozen it using Mr. Freeze's cryogenic technology. Selina Kyle briefly visits the grave at the conclusion of the story, where it is revealed that she believes that Falcone is her biological father and is determined to learn the truth.Batman: Dark Victory #10. DC Comics. =The New 52= In 2011, \\"The New 52\\" rebooted the continuity of the DC Comics universe. Carmine Falcone appears in the second issue of Batman Eternal. He is depicted as a former mobster determined to reclaim his empire after Commissioner Gordon, the man who took everything from him, is framed for mass murder.Batman Eternal #2. DC Comics. Falcone's plot to retake control of Gotham City progresses well, as he is shown to control Gotham's Mayor, Sebastian Hardy (who has managed to stay in office for five years thanks to Falcone's influence), while also taking advantage of Gordon's downfall to bribe members of the GCPD to do his dirty work. While Falcone and Mayor Hardy instruct the police to hunt down Batman, Falcone family soldiers begin attacking arms caches belonging to his chief rival Penguin.Batman Eternal #3. DC Comics. It is revealed at the conclusion of the story that Falcone was unaware of the larger plot against Batman, and was simply informed that he would have a chance to strike by an anonymous letter sent to him by the true mastermind. =DC Rebirth= In \\"DC Rebirth as part of the \\"War of Jokes and Riddles\\" storyline, which takes place after the events of Zero Year, Falcone is contacted by the Joker with strict instructions to kill the Riddler within an hour. His men ultimately fail to complete the assignment, leading the Joker to have Falcone's men assassinated. The Penguin then takes over his business interests on Joker's behalf.Batman #26 (July 5, 2017). DC Comics.

In other media =Television= John Doman as Carmine Falcone in Gotham * Carmine Falcone appears in the TV series Gotham portrayed by John Doman. He is depicted as a veteran Mafia Don who has Mayor Aubrey James (Richard Kind), Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb (Peter Scolari), and specific members of the Gotham City Police Department in his pocket as well as Victor Zsasz as a go-to hitman. He also claims that Detective Jim Gordon's (Ben McKenzie) late father Peter, who previously served as Gotham's district attorney, was also on his payroll. Falcone's crime family includes associates such as accountant Arthur Penn (Andrew Sellon) and hitman Victor Zsasz (Anthony Carrigan). Throughout the first season, Falcone faces several threats to his power: his lieutenant Fish Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith) is secretly planning to overthrow him; Gordon vows to bring him down; and his main rival Sal Maroni (David Zayas) is encroaching on his territory. Falcone enlists small-time criminal Oswald Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor), one of Fish's men, as a spy. Falcone also becomes enamored of a young woman named Liza (Makenzie Leigh) who is secretly working for Mooney. He later strangles Liza to death when he discovers where her allegiances lie. As punishment for her treason, he has Mooney imprisoned and gives control of her nightclub and the remnants of her gang to Cobblepot. Bent on ruling Gotham himself, Cobblepot instigates a turf war between Falcone and Maroni. In the season finale, \\"All Happy Families Are Alike\\", Falcone is wounded by Maroni's men and Cobblepot and his enforcer Butch Gilzean (Drew Powell) go to the hospital to finish him off. Gordon foils the assassination attempt, however, and takes Falcone, Cobblepot, and Gilzean to Falcone's safehouse ‚Äì where Mooney and Maroni are waiting, having formed an alliance. During the meeting, Mooney double-crosses Maroni by shooting him in the head, which leads to a fight between Maroni's men and Mooney's gang. While the criminals are distracted, Gordon, Bullock, and Falcone manage to escape back to Gordon's apartment. Falcone announces his intention to retire and leave Gotham, and gives Gordon a knife that was given to him by Gordon's father. In the second season, Falcone emerges from retirement to help Gordon escape Blackgate Penitentiary, where he had been jailed on a false charge. He then uses his criminal contacts to smuggle Gordon out of Gotham so that he can clear his name. In the third season, Falcone's son Mario Calvi (James Carpinello) gets engaged to Gordon's ex, Dr. Leslie Thompkins (Morena Baccarin). When an attempt is made on Mario's life, Falcone tortures one of the captured assassins and learns that the Court of Owls arranged the hit. He meets with the group's representative, Kathryn Monroe, and demands that they leave Mario alone, saying that the group owes him for letting them use the Indian Hill property for their experiments. Kathryn withholds a dark secret about Mario and states that he and those on his side will not win against the Court of Owls if they come after them in retaliation. After his son's wedding, he learns from Gordon that Mario is infected with the Tetch virus and he's willing to kill Leslie. He tells Gordon to bring his son in alive. In \\"Mad City: Ghosts\\", Carmine Falcone attends his son's funeral after his death at Gordon's hands. In a talk with Leslie Thompkins, Carmine tells Leslie to let him carry the burden of Mario's loss as he had done with other burdens. This leads to Carmine Falcone ordering Victor Zsasz, who's still loyal to him, to carry out a hit on Gordon. After visiting GCPD Captain Nathaniel Barnes at Arkham Asylum, Leslie tells Carmine Falcone to call off the hit since Mario would've acted the same way that her ex did. Carmine comments that he knows that Leslie still loves Gordon. When Zsasz shoots up Gordon's apartment, Carmine arrives and tells him that the hit has been cancelled. After Gordon apologizes to him about killing Mario, Carmine replies \\"If it were up to me, you'd be dead\\" before leaving. Gordon later confronts Carmine believing that he ordered a hit on his father. Carmine reveals that it was Gordon's uncle Frank Gordon who did it on behalf of the Court of Owls. In the fourth season, Gordon heads to Carmine's retirement villa in Miami in order to solicit his help in removing Penguin from power, but Carmine refuses as he is dying from a terminal illness. Carmine's daughter Sofia follows Gordon back to Gotham, where she helps him bring down Penguin. When a gang war threatens to erupt without a boss to keep the peace, Carmine returns to Gotham after being contacted by Penguin and plans to bring Sofia home to protect her. Before he can, Carmine is gunned down by assassins, who Sofia hired in order to assert her control of the city's underworld. Sofia is later shot in the head and left comatose by Leslie when she goes after Gordon. With Carmine and Mario dead, Sofia disabled, and a new criminal named Jeremiah Valeska becoming Gotham's new boss, it appears that the Falcone crime family has met its end. * Carmine Falcone appears in the Justice League Action episode \\"Time Share\\", voiced by Jason J. Lewis. Chronos, Batman, and Blue Beetle go back in time to Batman's first fight against Carmine Falcone and his men, which was also his first case as the Dark Knight. Chronos manages to tip off Falcone, which results in him and his men ambushing Batman. Batman and Blue Beetle stop Chronos from altering the outcome and getting Batman killed while secretly helping the past Batman catch Carmine Falcone, keeping themselves unseen to avoid changing the future. Carmine Falcone and his men are ultimately arrested by the police, preserving the time stream. =Film= * Carmine Falcone appears in Batman Begins played by Tom Wilkinson. He controls Gotham City's criminal underworld, flooding the city with drugs and crime, and serves as a symbol of Gotham's rottenness and corruption. With most city officials and cops either on his payroll or simply afraid to cross him, Falcone is effectively above the law, with few in the city willing to challenge his power. He has Joe Chill (Richard Brake), the murderer of Thomas and Martha Wayne, killed in public for threatening to testify against him, depriving Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) of his chance to exact revenge. Following Chill's death, Bruce confronts Falcone and tells him that not everyone in Gotham is afraid of him. Falcone simply orders his men to beat the young billionaire, and tells him that real power comes from being feared; he even points an empty gun at Bruce and tells him that he could kill him then and there, and no one, including the numerous public officials he's entertaining, would stop him. This inspires Bruce to travel the world in a journey that culminates in his transformation into Batman. During his absence, Falcone goes into business with Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy) and his mysterious benefactor Ra's al Ghul (Liam Neeson), using his influence to smuggle a hallucinogenic chemical compound into Gotham. In return, Crane, who runs Arkham Asylum, falsely diagnoses Falcone's henchmen as insane when they are arrested, keeping them out of prison and protecting Falcone. Batman breaks up one of Falcone's drug shipments and turns him over to the police. While in custody, Falcone tries to blackmail Crane into giving him a cut of what he believes to be profits from the smuggling operation. In response, Crane sprays Falcone with his fear toxin, driving him insane. He then has Falcone incarcerated in Arkham Asylum, where he lies catatonic, mindlessly muttering the word \\"Scarecrow\\". * In The Dark Knight, it is mentioned that Falcone is still in Arkham, and that Sal Maroni (Eric Roberts) has taken over his crime family. * Carmine Falcone appears in Batman: Year One voiced by Alex Rocco. He is first seen hosting a dinner party with Gotham City's corrupt politicians and his fellow crime bosses, which Batman crashes to announce his presence to the criminal underworld. Later on, Batman catches Falcone, strips him naked, and ties him up in his bed after dumping his car in the river. When Falcone makes plans to dispose of Lt. James Gordon for investigating his criminal activities, their meeting is interrupted by Batman and Catwoman, who defeat Falcone's bodyguards and hand him over to the police. While in the hospital recovering, Carmine orders his nephew, Johnny Viti, to have Barbara Eileen-Gordon and James Gordon Jr. killed, which Batman foils. Corrupt cop Arnold Flass finally brings about Falcone's downfall when he cuts a deal with prosecutors to testify against the mob boss. * Carmine Falcone is set to appear in The Batman portrayed by John Turturro. =Video games= * Tom Wilkinson reprises his role as Carmine Falcone in the 2005 video game version of Batman Begins. In the game, Batman sabotages Falcone's drug smuggling operation at the Gotham Docks to show him that there is now something on the streets worse than his criminal empire, before using a crane to lift Falcone's car into the air (with Falcone in it) to capture him and leave him for the cops. A later level has Batman infiltrating a building used by Falcone's crime family as a front for selling stolen and smuggled goods. * Carmine Falcone's crime family is featured in DC Universe Online. In the villain campaign, Killer Croc mentions that he has been hired by the Falcones to put an end to their competitor Bane's drug trafficking operations. Some of the Falcones are seen in a cutscene with Penguin at the Iceberg Lounge where he makes plans to take advantage of the ongoing gang war in Gotham. * The Falcone Crime Family (specifically Carmine) are mentioned several times in Batman: Arkham City. Scanning several items related to the Falcone and Maroni families offer stories about them. The exposition reveals that the Falcones won the war with the Maroni family by first offering to parlay with them in a meeting at their restaurant, only to have gunmen shoot up the building. The few survivors fled to Bludhaven, leaving the Falcones in charge of Gotham's underworld. One of Hugo Strange's interview tapes reveals that the Falcone family gave the man who would become the Joker the Red Hood costume he wore during his fateful first encounter with Batman. Another tape reveals that Harvey Dent, during his time as District Attorney, prosecuted a Falcone family soldier who scarred him with acid, turning him into Two-Face. A boat can be found while searching Amusement Mile, containing an invoice from a Falcone- owned shipping company for Dr. J. Crane, saying the first of fifteen shipments of \\"Live Insects for Medical Purposes\\" have arrived. If the player visits Calendar Man as Catwoman, he hints at Carmine being her father. * The Falcone Crime Family (specifically Carmine) are also mentioned a few times in Batman: Arkham Origins. One of Edward Nygma's extortion tapes, specifically regarding Alberto Falcone, reveal that Black Mask and Carmine Falcone were old acquaintances. In addition, it is revealed through dialogue that Carmine Falcone was forced to give up his involvement in arms smuggling after Oswald Cobblepot abducted and tortured Alberto as a warning. It was also implied that Carmine would have been notified about any potentially untreated psychological issues regarding Alberto by psychologist Harleen Quinzel as a threat to ensure Alberto continued with Hugo Strange's therapy sessions. * Carmine Falcone appears in the mobile game Batman: Arkham Underworld, voiced by Jon Polito. Though not appearing physically, Falcone mentions that he is under heat from the newly-elected district attorney Harvey Dent and will occasionally pop up after completed missions (specifically ones that involve attacking his businesses to build the player's own criminal empire) to either express his admiration of the player's \\"moxie\\" or give thinly-veiled threats warning the player to back off. * Carmine Falcone appears in Batman: The Telltale Series, voiced by Richard McGonagle. He is shown to be part of a clique that includes Mayor Hamilton Hill, Thomas Wayne, and Martha Wayne. Acting as the muscle for the group, Falcone takes complete control of the city's criminal underworld shortly after the Waynes are murdered. First appearing during a fundraiser for Harvey Dent's mayoral campaign at Wayne Manor, Falcone meets with Bruce and tries to build a partnership with him to keep Dent in check, alternating between calm negotiating and threats before finally giving up and leaving. As Batman, Bruce moves to take down Falcone by raiding his penthouse and subduing his men, before interrogating Falcone himself about a shootout near the docks. While Falcone admits ownership of the building it took place in and the chemical agents stored there, he denies having anything to do with the shootout, saying someone else is manipulating him. He also confirms recent allegations made against the Wayne family before Batman either leaves him to be arrested by the GCPD or administers a savage beating in full view of the police. Falcone is taken into custody, with the GCPD receiving enough evidence on his criminal empire to put him away for life. He is visited in the hospital by Bruce, who wishes to find out whether he had anything to do with his parents' murder. Falcone admits that Joe Chill was one of his hitmen, but denies ordering a hit on the Waynes, claiming that he considered them and Bruce family. GCPD Sergeant Renee Montoya bursts in and shoots him dead before he can reveal the true culprit. It is later revealed that his death was organized by the Children of Arkham.

Work with United Nations Roche launched an exhibition of the Chernobyl disaster for the 15th Anniversary of the nuclear accident in the UN Headquarters in New York in 2001. The Chernobyl legacy was demonstrated through digital imagery, photographs and sculpture. Entitled Black Wind, White Land, the exhibition was a month-long, cross- cultural event featuring the works of artists who depicted the suffering caused by the disaster. It was deemed an outstanding success by the UN and had its European Premiere in Dublin in 2002. She continues to work with the United Nations to highlight the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. Over the last decade she has contributed to UN-sponsored conferences and symposia on the fallout of Chernobyl. She has addressed Ambassadors to the UN General Assembly, the UNESCO conference on Chernobyl, and the Manchester International Peace Festival. Roche has provided advice and suggestions to the UN Needs Assessment Mission and has made several submissions on how NGOs could best be helped in their attempts to deliver humanitarian aid to the most affected areas in Belarus, Ukraine and western Russia. In July 2003, she was the keynote speaker at the launch of the International Chernobyl Research and Information Network (ICRIN) in Geneva, Switzerland. The ICRIN is am initiative joint-sponsored by the UN and the Swiss Agency for Development and Co- operation. Roche was appointed to represent NGOs on the Steering Committee of the ICRIN. To mark the 18th Anniversary of the tragedy in April 2004, Roche was invited to speak at the UN General Assembly at their headquarters in New York and to screen the Oscar award-winning documentary Chernobyl Heart. In 2004, Chernobyl Children International received official NGO status by the U.N.The 2015 World of Children Award Honorees She was also invited by the UNDP to sit on their organising committee, and act as the keynote speaker at the International Chernobyl Conference which was held in Minsk in April 2006 (to mark the 20th Anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster). On 26 April 2016, the 30th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, Roche made a landmark address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York. In an unprecedented move, the Belarusian UN delegation provided her with their speaking time at the General Assembly discussion on Chernobyl in recognition of the international role Ireland and Chernobyl Children International has played in helping the victims of the Chernobyl catastrophe. It was the first time an ordinary person (non- diplomat/non-political figure) was extended the honour of speaking at the UN General Assembly during a country's allocated time. On 8 December 2016, as a direct result of her address, the United Nations ratified the \\"Persistent Legacy of Chernobyl disaster\\", a symbolic element of which is the implementation of the \\"International Chernobyl Disaster Remembrance Day\\" Honours and awards Roche was awarded the European Woman Laureate Award following the release of the documentary film 'Black Wind, White Land' (1993) which highlighted the Chernobyl children's suffering. In the same year she received the title of the Republic's Person of the Year.

Early life and education Ladenburg was a member of the well-known Jewish in Mannheim. He was educated at a Realgymnasium at Mannheim and then, after the age of 15, at the technical school of Karlsruhe, where he studied mathematics and modern languages. He then proceeded to the University of Heidelberg where he studied chemistry and physics with Robert Bunsen. He also studied physics in Berlin. He got his Ph.D. in Heidelberg.  Academic career  In 1873, Ladenburg went to Kiel as professor of chemistry and director of the laboratory, remaining there until 1889 when he went to the University of Breslau in the same capacity. He was made an honorary member of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain in 1886 and received the Hanbury Medal for original research in chemistry in 1889. Ladenburg isolated hyoscine, also known as scopolamine for the first time in 1880. In 1900 Ladenburg founded the Chemische Gesellschaft Breslau, which he managed until 1910. He was also awarded the prestigious Davy Medal in 1905 \\"for his researches in organic chemistry, especially in connection with the synthesis of natural alkaloids\\". Ladenburg also addressed the relation of religion and science in a book he published in 1904, where he dealt with the topics of \\"Science and spiritual life\\" and Christianity.  Research  Prismane (isomer of benzene) In Ghent, Ladenburg worked for 6 months with August Kekul√© who introduced him to structural theory. They worked on the structure of Benzene. Ladenburg's theory that benzene was a prismatic molecule turned out to be wrong. His proposed structure was eventually realised in 1973 in the molecule prismane. Ladenburg visited England, and then went on to work for 18 months in Paris with Charles- Adolphe Wurtz and Charles Friedel on organosilicon compounds and tin compounds. He then returned to Heidelberg to teach. Family His son, Rudolf (1882‚Äì1952), became an atomic physicist. Other Son Eric died in boating accident in the early 1900's.

The bank became TD Bank, N.A. on May 31, 2008. In August 2004, Toronto-Dominion Bank became the majority owner, renaming it \\"TD Banknorth, N.A.\\", all remaining shares of TD Banknorth were acquired by Toronto-Dominion Bank on April 20, 2007. Its operating companies were Banknorth Connecticut, Peoples Heritage Bank (in Maine), Banknorth Massachusetts, Bank of New Hampshire, Evergreen Bank (in New York), Hudson United Bank, Banknorth Vermont, and Bancnorth Insurance Group. The majority of these companies were branded as TD Banknorth of State (example \\"TD Banknorth of Maine\\"). On April 10, 2008, TD Banknorth merged with New Jersey‚Äìbased Commerce Bank to form TD Bank, with joint headquarters in Cherry Hill, New Jersey and Portland, Maine. The legal name of the bank was changed to TD Bank, N.A. on May 31, 2008, with all TD Banknorth branches outside of New England and all Commerce Bank branches being rebranded in the fall of 2008. The remaining branches, in New England, took on the new name in September 2009. History TD Banknorth in Burlington, Vermont The origins of Banknorth Group, now TD Bank, lie in a number of local Maine savings banks, and in Vermont dating back to 1802 with Woodstock National Bank. =Portland Savings Bank= The Portland Savings Bank was established in 1852, and was initially open only on Wednesdays and Saturdays from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Albion K. Parris, Portland‚Äôs mayor, was the first President. Support of community and public projects was an important objective of the bank. It weathered the great fire of Portland and the financial panics in 1873 and 1878, and at its 50th year in 1902 had 24,000 depositors, deposits of almost $10,000,000, and a staff of nine. In 1906, a branch on Congress Street joined the Head Office branch, and nineteen years later all business moved to Congress Street. The Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression gravely threatened the bank. To handle the number of properties it came to own through foreclosure, the bank established a ‚ÄúReal Estate Department‚Äù or property management division. Returning to prosperity with the post-war mortgage boom, Portland Savings was revolutionized under the leadership of Roger Lambert, CEO from 1965 to 1981. He encouraged the creation of a more dynamic board of directors and established a wide array of bank services, following the model of the commercial banks. He expanded Portland Savings‚Äô portfolio of commercial loans and introduced innovative retail products such as money market certificates. Between 1965 and 1981 the bank grew from 2 to 13 branches across Maine, with assets increasing from $63 to $294 million =People‚Äôs Savings Bank= People's Savings was founded in 1875 in Lewiston, Maine. A conservative but successful bank, it prospered with the local mill economy. Early in the twentieth century the bank innovated by opening $1 accounts for all babies born in the area, on condition that there were no withdrawals for ten years. The policy lasted into the 1970s. Christmas and vacation clubs were also established. Local banks suffered greatly from the decline of the mill economy in the 1920s and 1930s, but enjoyed a recovery during World War II, with industrial renewal and a defense bond business. In the post-war period People's helped finance the new industries that were gradually replacing textiles in the local economy. =Rockland Savings Bank/Heritage Savings Bank= Rockland Savings was established in 1868 in Rockland, Maine, (following attempts in 1855 and 1861). In 1974, it changed its name to the Heritage Savings Bank. In 1978, it merged with: * Penobscot Savings, Bangor, founded in 1869 and a pioneer in savings for children in association with the local school system. A ‚Äúsmall conservative bank in a small conservative city,‚Äù it did not expand its branch system until 1961, when a second office was opened. * Waterville Savings, founded in Waterville in 1869. =Franklin County Savings Bank & Trust Co.= Franklin County Savings Bank was founded in 1899 in St. Albans, Vermont. The bank maintained the name Franklin County Bank until the merger with Lamoille County Bank & Trust Company (1875) in the early 1970s. After the merger, the bank adopted a new name, Franklin Lamoille Bank. The bank also incorporated a holding company named Banknorth. Woodstock National Bank was founded in 1802 and merged into the Howard Bancorp. The Woodstock National Bank maintained its name until June 1999 when it merged into its sister bank First Vermont Bank & Trust Company. =Granite Savings Bank & Trust Company= The Granite Saving Bank & Trust Company was founded in Barre, Vermont in 1885. The bank's original office, located on North Main Street in Barre, is now the home for a senior citizen group. The current headquarters is 36 North Main Street, Barre. Banknorth Group Inc. planned to maintain the name until it was purchased by Peoples Bank (Maine). In 2000, Granite Savings Bank & Trust merged with its sister bank The Howard Bank, a change some customers never noticed until their statement arrived. =The Howard Bank N.A.= The Howard National Bank & Trust Company of Burlington, Vermont, was founded in 1870. The Bank bought out a few banks and took them under the Howard Bank name. The Bank changed and shortened its name when it became a more statewide banking company. The Bank also created a banking holding company as \\"Howard Bancorp\\" in 1995, and in 1996 the Howard Bancorp merged with Banknorth Group Inc. In the deal, Howard Bancorp decided to take on the Banknorth Group name. =First Vermont Bank & Trust Company= The First Vermont Bank & Trust was founded in 1906. The Company bought Franklin Lamoille Bank and was one of the first banks to offer on-line banking for the tellers. However, when Howard Bancorp purchased Banknorth Group, management found it too expensive to upgrade the systems of the new division. In 1999, the bank acquired Woodstock National Bank and in 2002, all three Vermont banks were merged into Banknorth N.A. Vermont, a division of Banknorth N.A. The oldest component that Banknorth currently has recorded for the Vermont banking company is Woodstock National Bank. All the Vermont banking companies date to the 1800s with the exception of First Vermont Bank from 1906. =Merger of Portland/Peoples/Heritage= \\"The late 1970s and early 1980s were difficult years for the thrift industry. As inflation and interest rates soared into double digits, savings banks in Maine and elsewhere found themselves forced to pay higher interest rates to attract depositors while maintaining a large portfolio of long-term low-interest mortgages.\\" In 1981, Portland Savings declared a loss and recognized a pressing need for consolidation in the local banking market. The following year Portland and People's arranged a merger, and the new bank adopted the People's name. In 1984, Peoples and Heritage merged as Peoples Heritage, a billion dollar institution with Wes Bonney as the first President. The new bank, with a total of 35 branches, moved quickly to expand its ATM network, introduce innovations such as Cashline phone banking, and develop an emphasis on commercial loan, a new development for a traditional savings bank. In 1986, in an effort to acquire capital for expansion, Peoples dropped its charter as a mutual bank and rechartered into a public corporation. With its new resources the bank planned to grow its asset base from $1 billion to $4 billion within five years. This would be accomplished through acquisitions, an expanded branch network, and a rapid increase in commercial lending and real estate. In 1988, Peoples Heritage reorganized itself as a bank holding company in order to gain greater flexibility in making bank and non-bank acquisitions. Acquisitions in the period were: * Northeast Leasing: 1987 * Six branches from Casco Northern Bank: 1989 * First Coastal Bank, Portsmouth, NH: 1989 * Merchants National Bank of Dover * First National Bank of Portsmouth, founded 1824 * Oxford Bank & Trust Company from Bank of Vermont (As part of Bank of Boston's purchase of Bank of Vermont, regulators required it to sell the Oxford Bank & Trust component.) (5 branches - 1988). * Had a $100 million personal trusts department, the first venture of Peoples into this area. Recession and crisis In 1989, the Maine real estate market collapsed. In this period of crisis, William J. Ryan became the new President and CEO. In 1990, the recession resulted in 111 bank closures or mergers in New England. Peoples‚Äô stock began to fall as serious problems emerged with bad loans, particularly in the faltering real estate sector, but also in the commercial realm. In the period 1990 to 1992, Peoples was losing money, and federal regulators issued a cease and desist order restricting the bank's freedom in the loans area. In response, the management team was shaken up, and special teams were assigned to loans review and restructuring. The bank opened an innovative storefront retail real estate office to move foreclosed properties. Recovery began by mid-1992. The bank had aggressively reduced its portfolio of non-performing loans, and all discernible asset quality trends were positive, resulting in a favorable impact to the bottom line. In 1993, the bank again became profitable, and it re-capitalized with a rights offering in Q4 1992, generating $38 million in new capital. Recovery and expansion In 1993, the Peoples management held a retreat to plan strategy for future growth. Bill Ryan proposed a doubling of assets to $5 billion through a maximization of market share in Maine and acquisition of other community banks in the region. The plan resulted in the following acquisitions during the 1990s: * Mid-Maine Savings, Auburn, Maine, 1993 * Bankcore, Inc / North Conway Bank, North Conway, New Hampshire, 1995 * Bank of New Hampshire, 1995, second largest bank in New Hampshire, founded in 1875, with assets of 1.7 billion. The acquisition increased the size of Peoples by 1/3 to $4.2 billion. As well, it established People's credentials as a commercial bank. Terms of the merger allowed The Bank of New Hampshire to keep its name and management structure. * Family Bancorp, Haverhill, Massachusetts, 1996 * Atlantic Bancorp, Portland, Maine, 15 branch operation with assets of $470, 1997 * CFX, Keene, New Hampshire, 1997, originally Cheshire County Savings Bank, 1897. The acquisition doubled People's assets to $10 billion. NH branches became part of The Bank of New Hampshire, while Massachusetts branches joined Family Bancorp. * Springfield Institution for Savings (SIS) 1998, Springfield, Massachusetts - 1.8 billion in assets, included Glastonbury Bank and Trust Company of Glastonbury, Connecticut * Banknorth Group of Burlington, Vermont (1870), agreement reached in 1999 Peoples becomes Banknorth Former Banknorth logo The Banknorth acquisition was the most significant to date, and with it Peoples assumed the Banknorth name. Banknorth Group Inc. was headquartered in Burlington, Vermont. The company was the holding company for: Franklin Lamoille Bank (1899) in St. Albans, The Howard Bank N.A. (1870) in Burlington; Stratevest N.A. (Investment & Managements) in Burlington (FLB, THB, GSB, FVB, FNB, FMB, EB), Granite Savings Bank & Trust Company (1885) in Barre; Woodstock National Bank (1802) in Woodstock, First Vermont Bank, & Trust Company (1906) in Brattleboro, and Farmington National Bank (1854), Farmington, New Hampshire. The merger increased Peoples' assets to $17 billion and gave it a larger presence in Massachusetts, Vermont, and through Evergreen Bank (Glens Falls, (1853), in New York. The completion of the merger was delayed by regulatory review, but on May 10, 2000, Banknorth Group Inc of Portland, Maine came into being. ‚ÄúThe Banknorth acquisition brought into the fold eight separate community banks (Franklin Lamoille Bank N.A., The Howard Bank N.A., and First Vermont Bank N.A. in Vermont; Bank of New Hampshire under the charter of Farmington National Bank in New Hampshire, Oxford Bank & Trust, a division of Peoples Heritage Bank, and Peoples Heritage Bank in Maine; First Mass. Bank in Massachusetts, GBT, a division of First Mass Bank in Connecticut, and Evergreen Bank in New York), with 101 branches, together with an investment management firm, Stratevest, that oversaw some 4 billion in assets and a freestanding mortgage-lending unit.‚Äù The new organization renewed its program of acquisitions. ‚ÄúAs Banknorth expanded across the map of New England, the message remained the same: community banking values, enhanced by the resources of a major banking organization, create a better bank.‚Äù Acquisitions in the period included: * Andover Bancorp, $1.8 billion company, 15 branches in Essex and Middlesex counties, Massachusetts, 2001 * MetroWest, 17 branches in Boston western suburbs, slightly less than $1 billion in assets, 2001 * Ipswich Bancshares, 8 branches north of Boston, 2002 * Warren Bancorp, Essex County, Massachusetts, 2002 * Community Insurance Agencies, Inc. May 2002 * Bancorp Connecticut, seven branches and $663 million in assets, 2002 * American Savings Bank, New Britain, Connecticut, 2003. Added $4 billion in assets and 47 branches in central Connecticut. * CCBT Financial Companies, Parent company of Cape Cod Bank & Trust, with $1.4 billion in assets and 26 branches in Barnstable and Plymouth Counties, Massachusetts, 2003 * Boston Federal Savings Bank, subsidiary of BostonFed Bancorp, Inc., with $1.7 billion in assets and $1.2 billion in deposits, and 16 branches in Middlesex, Norfolk, Essex, and Suffolk Counties, Massachusetts, 2004 In the 1990s and early 2000s, the emphasis was on the development of a financial services company in a true community bank setting. In 1997, the bank launched what would become Banknorth Insurance Group, and by 2002 built the largest insurance brokerage group in New England. By 2002, Banknorth Investment Management Group had grown out of the trust business of the Bank of New Hampshire and Banknorth Vermont's consolidated trusts operation, Stratevest. On December 31, 2001, the holding company, Banknorth Group, Inc., merged its seven subsidiary banks into one bank, Banknorth NA under the Peoples Heritage Bank charter dating back to 1852, with one OCC charter. Using locally relevant trade names retained the local identity in each state. TD acquisition On August 26, 2004, TD Bank Financial Group announced it had signed an agreement with Banknorth to acquire 51% of the outstanding shares of the company for a total of $3.8 billion US. Banknorth shareholders approved the transaction at a special meeting of shareholders on February 18, 2005, and final approval was announced on March 1, 2005. In connection with the transaction, Banknorth changed its name to TD Banknorth Inc. and reincorporated in Delaware. All remaining shares of TD Banknorth were acquired by Toronto-Dominion Bank on April 20, 2007. Continued growth In July 2005, TD Banknorth announced that it had acquired Hudson United Bank, based in Mahwah, New Jersey. Hudson United had earlier acquired numerous regional banks. The acquisition significantly expanded TD Banknorth's presence in both Connecticut and New York and extended the franchise into northern New Jersey and Philadelphia as well. TD Banknorth announced acquisition of Interchange Financial Services Corp in April 2006, adding 30 branches in Bergen and Essex counties of New Jersey. In January 2006, the company finalized acquisition of Boothby & Bartlett Company, a central Maine insurance agency in Waterville. Banknorth added a sister company, TD Ameritrade, which was formed after the Ameritrade Holding Corporation acquired TD Waterhouse USA from Toronto-Dominion Bank in 2006. On November 20, 2006, TD Bank Financial and TD Banknorth entered into an agreement in which TD Bank would acquire all remaining shares of TD Banknorth held by the public for US$32.33 per share in cash. This was completed on April 20, 2007, and TD Banknorth became a wholly owned subsidiary of TD Bank. On October 2, 2007, Toronto-Dominion announced its plans to acquire Cherry Hill, New Jersey‚Äìbased Commerce Bancorp, pending shareholder and regulatory approval. The combined company was to be known as TD Commerce Bank, but in March 2008, Commerce Bank & Trust Company of Worcester, Massachusetts filed a lawsuit against TD Banknorth, to bar the bank from using the name TD Commerce Bank in its existing Massachusetts branches. On May 2, 2008, federal Judge F. Dennis Saylor granted a preliminary injunction, prohibiting the use of the TD Commerce name in Massachusetts branches. Toronto-Dominion then dropped plans to add the Commerce name to its banking operation and instead chose to operate all its branches as \\"TD Bank\\".

Bush on January 11, 2002. Brownfields are defined as, \\"A former industrial or commercial site where future use is affected by real or perceived environmental contamination.\\" The Brownfields Law amended the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) by providing funds to assess and clean up brownfields, clarifying CERCLA liability protections, and providing funds to enhance state and tribal response programs. Other related laws and regulations impact brownfields cleanup and reuse through financial incentives and regulatory requirements. An Executive Take The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act was a response to the 1980 act entitled The Superfund, which forced industries to pay for their own toxic spills and general pollution. President Bush cited in his address, on January 11, 2002, that \\"American cities have many such eyesores; anywhere from 500,000 to a million brownfields are across our Nation.\\" In turn, this bill was created to put an end to the excess regulations and litigations many entrepreneurs incur when revitalizing dilapidated fields. Benefits This act allows cash poor parties financial assistance, settling for smaller payment amounts, and alternative payment methods. This act also allows parties with property adjacent to the brownfields‚Äîwhich may contain hazardous wastes that infect their real estate‚Äîrelief from the stipulations they would previously been accountable for. Additionally, the property owners whose groundwater is contaminated by erosion, upon passing the Act, are now exempt from installing remediation systems and having any further inspections. Previously responsible parties are now exempt from the Superfund's legislation. Innocent landowning parties can now be defended so long as they intend to fully cooperate with natural resource restoration, comply with restrictions on property, and not impede on the integrity of the ruling institution. Exemptions Groups that are looking to dispose of less than 110 gallons or 200 pounds of hazardous waste are exempt from this act, so long as the disposal occurred before April 1, 2001. The National Priorities List, a branch of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), also states that groups operating with fewer than 100 full-time employees are also exempt from former Superfund agreements. Additionally, the president retains the ability to override any exemptions he deems necessary due to maltreatment of natural resources. The president may also override any failed requests that were submitted by previously responsible parties, or current landowners. In Section 221 of the act, anyone owning land adjacent to contaminated property that is releasing hazardous substances is also exempt from the stipulations previously required by The Superfund of 1980. Stipulations Landowners, upon passing The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownsfield Revitalization Act, are responsible to proceed with an \\"all appropriate inquiry\\" in which they ask previous owners of the nature of the lands use. Additionally, to carry out an all appropriate inquiry, the current landowner must take the customary steps toward protecting human activity from the contaminated area on the property and salvaging any natural resources contaminated by the contamination. Finally, the act requires an EPA administrator to make known any contamination upon the property publicly available within two years from discovery. Funding Two sources of funding were derived from Section 104(k) within Subtitle A and Section 128(a) within Subtitle C of this Act that establishes $250 Million per year for brownfields revitalization. Specifically, $200 million per year for brownfields assessment, cleanup, revolving loans, and environmental job training, and $50 million per year to assist State and Tribal response programs. The Environmental Protection Agency's Brownfields Program collaborates with other EPA programs, federal partners, and state agencies to identify and leverage resources that can be used for brownfields activities. These collaborations lead to a process of engagement reliant upon public‚Äìprivate partnerships to turn dilapidated properties into viable economic redevelopments or \\"green-space\\" throughout the country. Funding criteria include the extent to which the money will be used to protect human health, and the environment, spur redevelopment and create jobs, preserve open space and parks, represent a \\"fair\\" distribution between urban and rural areas, address \\"sensitive populations\\", and involve the local community. Land Revitalization Due to the issuance of the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA/Superfund) signed 1980 and subsequent court decisions imposing cleanup liability on a wide range of entities involved with a contaminated property, people began to avoid the redevelopment, reuse, and revitalization of properties identified with previous commercial or industrial business practices. One of the most significant hurdles cities, communities, and private sector players face when trying to acquire and redevelop contaminated property is the lack of capital to provide essential early-stage activities such as site assessment, remediation, response action, and cleanup. This Act provides a solution to those hurdles by providing increased funding for site evaluation and cleanup, Superfund liability reform and brownfields liability clarifications, and new limitations on EPA authority as it relates to state response programs. =Project Cycle Description= The life cycle of a brownfield project begins when an eligible entity identifies a brownfield property in its community and also identifies the community's redevelopment needs and goals. This property then undergoes an All Appropriate Inquiry or Environmental Site Assessment to assess the potential liability associated. If a recognized environmental concern is found, the extent of historical contamination associated with the property is assessed. Once the extent of historical contamination is delineated in all directions, the site undergoes remediation to make the land protective of human health and the environment. When the cleanup of a site is accomplished, the property is ready for redevelopment or revitalization. If no liabilities or recognized environmental concerns are found within the All Appropriate Inquiry or Environmental Site Assessment the property can skip the assessment and remediation stages within the project cycle and go directly to redevelopment. =Public-Private Partnership through Brownfields Redevelopment= Public‚Äìprivate partnerships have been defined as long-term relationships between fundamentally different sectors that are focused on the development of infrastructure required for rendering of services and a more effective rendering of public services, seeking to ensure social economic development at national, regional and local levels. The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act has created a new platform for multi-sector collaboration by creating a process of engagement between entities. A mechanism within this platform includes state response program grants authorized by CERCLA Section 128(a)(1) that seek to protect human health and the environment by encouraging the voluntary investigation and cleanup of properties by establishing memorandum of agreements/understandings with state environmental authorities. When a brownfields site is in a state response program, the responsible party is protected from enforcement. This protection and the available resources to provide environmental site assessments and limited cleanups are the attributes that encourage the revitalization of historic sites with an industrial past. In Texas, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has a Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP) that provides administrative, technical, and legal incentives to participants for investigation, cleanup, and redevelopment. Discovery Green In 2004, a public-private partnership to secure a site in downtown Houston, Texas was formed by the Brown Foundation, the Kinder Foundation, the Wortham Foundation, the Houston Endowment, Inc., and the City of Houston to create the Discovery Green Conservancy. This group envisioned turning an undeveloped and underused parking lot with a long history of industrial occupants into a downtown city park. The Discovery Green Conservancy is a private nonprofit organization formed to raise funds, operate and care for this park. Typically, sights with an industrial past equate to environmental issues. The affected property assessment of this site revealed soils impacted by metals and petroleum hydrocarbons, and groundwater impacted by volatile organic compounds. To remediate this site, impacted soils were properly disposed of at an offsite permitted recycling facility and groundwater was treated with an in-situ bioremediation microorganisms. When the site was remediated to be protective of human health and the environment, it received a VCP Certificate of Completion and construction on the park began. Discovery Green is now a beautiful, vibrant 12-acre park in the heart of downtown Houston that opened to the public in April 2008. The total cost to acquire the land that became Discovery Green was approximately $57 million, and the total cost to build, landscape, and complete the project was approximately $125 million. Since opening in 2008, the park has helped drive convention activity and has served as a catalyst for $625 million in downtown development. =Ongoing Issues= The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act exemplifies collaborative approaches to encourage voluntary environmental improvements, an increasingly prominent alternative to traditional regulatory models of environmental protection. However, issues such as the stigmatization of sites, limited amount of awarded grant funds, and disparity in award funding are common hurdles the Brownfields policy currently faces. To resolve these issues the Brownfields Utilization, Investment, and Local Development (BUILD) Act of 2013 was introduced to the 113 Congress on March 7, 2013. This Act proposes to expand eligibility, increase funding for remediation grants, and give priority to small communities including Indian Tribes, rural and low-income areas with a population of less than 15,000.

Named for the first enduring European post in the area of modern-day Edmonton, the park is the largest living history museum in Canada by area. It includes both original and rebuilt historical structures representing the history of Edmonton (including that of post-horse Indigenous people), and is staffed during the summer by costumed historical interpreters.  History  The history of Fort Edmonton Park's conception goes back as far as 1912 where the Women's Canadian Club proposed that they keep and preserve Fort Edmonton, which was still standing since 1830 just south of the Alberta Legislature Building. This idea however was unsuccessful, and in 1915 the remains of the old fort were torn down, amidst opposition from citizens who wished to see the old structures relocated so that they could be cherished for their heritage value. A renewed interest after the Second World War began the momentum that saw the park begin construction in 1969 under the direction of the Fort Edmonton Foundation. The Foundation's Master Plan of 1968 envisioned a park that would present a cross-section of the Edmonton area's history from the distant geological past, to the areas that it currently embodies, and even an area that would prophesy Edmonton's future. This original plan speculated that the completed park would be spread over ten phases. By 1987, however, it became clear that the park had evolved incompatibly with the ambitious 1968 plan, and the Master Plan was amended to focus instead on the four sections that had materialized to date. The fort was the first portion of the park to open in 1974, originally accessible directly by road. 1885 Street opened by the late 1970s, followed by 1905 Street in the early 1980s, and then 1920 Street by the beginning of the 1990s. A working steam train has transported visitors from the park's entrance to the fort since 1977. Each street was opened as a work in progress, and the latest version of the park's development plan calls for still more additions, especially to 1920 Street.  Description  Costumed staff from various eras partake in a parade (as seen on 1905 Street).As of 2008, Fort Edmonton Park is made up of four sections, each representing an era, all spread over 158 acres (0.639 km2).Fort Edmonton Park  Edmonton Sights The park is located along the south bank of the North Saskatchewan River in southwestern Edmonton. The first era is represented by the fort of 1846, followed by 1885 Street, 1905 Street, and 1920 Street. Visitors may board a fully functional steam train at the park's entrance which transports them across the length of the park to the fort, from which they proceed on foot and abstractly move forward through time by visiting all four eras. Aside from the train, visitors may also ride horse-drawn carriages, streetcars, and automobiles in the appropriate eras. Rides on the train and streetcars are free with admission; however, rides on horse-drawn vehicles typically require a fee, and rides in the automobiles are at the discretion of the park staff who drive them. From May long weekend through to Labour Day, and Sundays in September, visitors may also interact with costumed historical interpreters. These personnel utilize a variety of techniques to reveal the lifestyles and attitudes of the era that they represent. Additionally, throughout the year, public tours may be booked with non-costumed interpreters. = 1846 Fort ‚Äì Fur Trade Era (1795‚Äì1859) = A painting of Fort Edmonton by Kane (1849)York boatThe Rowand House dominates the other buildings along Fort Edmonton's courtyard.Chronologically, the first phase of Fort Edmonton Park is the eponymous Hudson's Bay Company fort, representing the fur trade era. The fort is not the original; it has been rebuilt using a scale plan diagram drawn by British Lieutenant Mervin Vavasour, who visited the Fort in the mid-1840s. Other accounts, such as the journals of the fort's denizens, or the artwork of Paul Kane, were used to flesh out the Vavasour Plan. A Cree camp is found just outside the fort's palisade, itself a representation of the indigenous First Nations, whose trade of furs and provisions was vital to the historical fort's operation.  Notable features ; York Boat : A replica York boat is displayed near the river and is sometimes moored in the water. Another York boat may be seen under construction within the walls of the fort. ; The Rowand House : The imposing residence of John Rowand and his family, this massive structure was one of the largest houses in present-day western Canada in its own time. The house has four levels, and they are (starting from the bottom): one for servants, one for dining and business, one for the family and guest rooms, and a garret for storage. ; The Men's Quarters : Directly opposite of the Rowand House on the fort's courtyard, several apartments make up the residence of the Hudson's Bay Company's labourers. Some quarters are also the workspace of the fort's skilled tradesmen. Many beds furnish these quarters, as each small apartment was to house several working men and, if married, their families. ; The Clerks' Quarters : Historically, this was a building for the fort's educated clerks to dwell in. The second floor, which would have had the clerks' bedrooms, was mistakenly not built in this reproduction. Instead, this building is almost entirely a dining hall, which would have been an important but not all-encompassing portion of the original. This building is among several in the park that are rented out for private functions.Fort Edmonton Park: Venue Rentals Retrieved on 31 January 2009 ; The Indian House/Trade Store : A common sight in Hudson's Bay Company posts, this was the point of trade for fur brought by natives who bartered them for European goods. The working men of the fort would toil in counting, storing and eventually transporting the furs to Hudson Bay, where they could be shipped to England and sold. ; Aboriginal camp : To date, the main depiction of aboriginals in Fort Edmonton Park has been through a small Cree camp, located just outside the fort. One of the potential upcoming expansions for the park is a larger post-horse aboriginal village. = 1885 Street ‚Äì The Settlement Era (1871‚Äì1891) = While the fort may have been the first European establishment in the Edmonton area, it was not until the second half of the 19th century that settlers either moved out of the fort or came from some distance to work the land on self-sustaining farms. 1885 Street represents the beginning of a town, displays the establishment of telegraph and printing press media, and references major political events such as the North-West Rebellion of 1885.  Notable features  Covered wagon Panorama of a section of 1885 Street ; Covered wagon : This type of vehicle was used to carry settlers and their belongings overland from Winnipeg or Ontario. The wagons were made narrow to permit passage along the meagre trails. ; Jasper House Hotel : While the original hotel is still in use by a different name at its original site in downtown Edmonton, Fort Edmonton Park's iteration reproduces the first building in the city to be made entirely of brick. It is rented out for private functions. ; McDougall Methodist Church : An original structure that was moved to Fort Edmonton Park, this church, built in 1873, was one of the first structures built outside of Fort Edmonton. It displays the prominence of Methodists in early Edmonton's community, a tradition carried on in this era by Reverend George McDougall from the first Protestant missionary in the region, Reverend Robert Rundle, who had lived in Fort Edmonton during its fur trade years. ; The North-West Mounted Police Outpost : A replica of the office used by officers of the North-West Mounted Police (precursors to the present-day Royal Canadian Mounted Police). ; The Ottewell Homestead: A reconstruction of an original house paired with an original barn from the same era, this house is indicative of the lifestyle of homesteaders who populated the Edmonton area in the late 19th century. Live animals are kept at the site. = 1905 Street ‚Äì The Municipal Era (1892‚Äì1914) = A view of 1905 StreetIn this time, Edmonton was established as a city, and in 1905 was selected as the site of the Alberta Provincial Legislature. This coincided with an economic boom that Edmonton enjoyed at the time. The darker side of the boom was that the lack of housing available necessitated a tent city, which may be seen on 1905 Street. Another important event in Edmonton, the opening of the University of Alberta in 1908, is often referenced on this street.  Notable features ; Tent City : Due to Edmonton's economic boom in the early years of the 20th century, the large influx of newcomers to Edmonton arrived to find no housing available. Fort Edmonton Park's tent city reflects the temporary solution that people used until houses could be built. This historical reproduction found a contemporary parallel in 2007, when economic prosperity in the province of Alberta meant that many of the poor could not afford rising rent costs, and a tent city was erected in downtown Edmonton populated by about two hundred homeless people.Edmonton homeless pitch new tent city ; Rutherford House : This was the house of Alexander Cameron Rutherford, the first Premier of Alberta and a major figure in the University of Alberta's inception. It was moved to Fort Edmonton Park from its original location in south Edmonton. It is distinct from Rutherford's later residence located on the University of Alberta campus.Streetcar ; Streetcar : The Edmonton Radial Railway Society operates a streetcar with service to both 1905 Street and 1920 Street. This service first becomes available at the junction of 1885 Street and 1905 Street. No fare is required to use the streetcar. Additionally, vintage automobiles may be seen operating on this street and 1920 Street. ; Masonic Hall : Located at 1905 Street is a replica of a 1903 Masonic Hall, which was originally built at 100 Avenue and 102 Street. Opened in 1986, the Masonic Museum is located on the second floor and features Masonic regalia, furniture and historic artifacts. Food services are located on the lower floor. = 1920 Street ‚Äì The Metropolitan Era (1914‚Äì1929) = A portion of 1920 Street This street depicts Edmonton during and following the First World War. Whereas previous eras showed small businesses as making up nearly the entirety of Edmonton's commerce, Metropolitan Edmonton relies on larger business chains. Edmonton of this era also sports modern technology such as airplanes.  Notable features The Mellon Farm: distinctive as the only structure original to the park site Edmonton, Yukon and Pacific Route train in the park ; Blatchford Field Air Hangar: A replica of the hangar present at the current Edmonton City Centre Airport, Blatchford Field was the first \\"Air Harbour\\" in Canada.Heritage Community Foundation: Blatchford Field Retrieved on 31 January 2009 This incarnation of the building doubles as a rental space for private functions. A replica biplane like that flown by aviator Wop May will be displayed at the hangar site.Fort Edmonton Park: Blatchford Field Air Hangar Retrieved on 31 January 2009 ; Hotel Selkirk: An approximation of a hotel that once stood in the core of present-day downtown Edmonton, this building actually functions as a real hotel within the park, allowing visitors to stay overnight.Fort Edmonton Park: Hotel Selkirk and Johnson's Cafe Retrieved on 31 January 2009 ; Mellon Farm: This building is an original. It was located close by to its current location because the land that Fort Edmonton Park sits on was once owned by the Mellon family.Fort Edmonton Park: Mellon Farm Retrieved on 31 January 2009 ; Al-Rashid Mosque:The Al-Rashid Mosque has the distinction of being the first purpose-built mosque in Canada.Canadian Society of Muslims: Al-Rashid Mosque Retrieved on 31 January 2009 Though it was built in 1938, outside of 1920 Street's apparent range, its move to Fort Edmonton Park saved it from demolition. Historically, many Muslim immigrants to Canada chose to live in Edmonton because they had heard that a mosque was there.Fort Edmonton Foundation: Al Raschid Mosque Retrieved on 31 January 2009 ; 1920 Midway & Exhibition : A recreation of a 1920s midway opened at the end of 1920 Street, near the park's entrance, in 2006. Various games of skill may be found on the midway, and a carousel featuring hand-carved horses is housed just inside of a permanent pavilion nearby.

After graduating from Fair Lawn High School, she worked as a receptionist in New York when a photographer discovered her, and she became an international cover girl.\\" Her father was a merchant marine captain. Perkins was working as a receptionist at a New York City advertising agency when she caught the eye of a visiting photographer with a resultant career as a model; by 1958, Perkins was an international cover girl.\\"New Picture\\", Time, A friend and photographer Walter Karl Gluck took a photo of Millie and sent it to producer George Stevens, who was conducting a very public search for the girl to play the title role in The Diary of Anne Frank. \\"Stevens' choice was an 18-year-old model from Fair Lawn, N.J. named Millie Perkins.\\" In 1958, she was vigorously pursued, and then selected, to appear in her first film, The Diary of Anne Frank. Perkins had never studied nor sought to be an actress, but George Stevens saw her in Gluck's photo and on the covers of several magazines and tried to convince her to read for the part. Finally, she flew to Hollywood for a screen test, and with much fanfare, landed the role of Anne Frank in George Stevens' 1959 film The Diary of Anne Frank. Perkins received almost universally excellent reviews for her portrayal of Anne although the film was less of a box-office success than expected. Perkins on a visit to Israel in 1959 After her work with George Stevens, Perkins was placed under contract to 20th Century Fox. She was one of the promising young stars of Hollywood, but the studio contract system, which was coming to an end, was a poor fit for Perkins, who had come of age with the Beat Generation in 1950s New York City. George Stevens would later state: \\"Millie did not fit in. She was 10 years too early.\\" Suspended for refusing the lead in the 1960 film Tess of the Storm Country ‚Äì Perkins saw the film as a B-picture and a step back career-wise ‚Äì Perkins was cast by 20th Century Fox in the 1961 film Wild in the Country, playing the supporting role of the girlfriend to star Elvis Presley ‚Äì she would later play Gladys Presley in the 1990 miniseries Elvis; the studio then dropped Perkins. Joshua Logan personally selected Perkins for the female lead in the 1964 film Ensign Pulver, but the film was a failure; Perkins would not appear in another mainstream film release for almost 20 years. She played the female lead in both of Jack Nicholson's inaugural productions The Shooting and Ride in the Whirlwind ‚Äì shot side by side in 1965 ‚Äì and in 1968 co-starred in Wild in the Streets which was written by her then- husband Robert Thom. =Later career= In 1976, Perkins moved to Jacksonville, Oregon, with her two daughters by Robert Thom, Lillie and Hedy; in 1977, People magazine reported that Perkins \\"conducts a drama-therapy workshop every Tuesday night in her living room and often speaks to high- school drama groups in the area.\\" By 1978, Perkins was sufficiently far off the Hollywood radar that the Screen Actors Guild had her on their inactive list and that September, Hollywood column \\"Ask Dick Kleiner\\" responded to the query: \\"What ever happened to Millie Perkins?\\" with \\"Millie Perkins died recently\\"; a letter from Perkins herself resulted in a January 1979 retraction by Kleiner, although the columnist maintained: \\"almost everyone in Hollywood believes that [Perkins] died.\\" In 1982, however, it was reported that Perkins was teaching drama at Southern Oregon University. In 1983, Perkins returned to features to play Jon Voight's ex-wife in Table for Five. She then played the mother role for the next 20 years, such as Sean Penn's mother in the fact- based film At Close Range, the mother of Charlie Sheen's character in the 1987 movie Wall Street, the bereft Jewish mother in the 1996 film The Chamber, and Andy Garc√≠a's mother in the 2005 film The Lost City. =Television work= Perkins made her television debut in 1961 as a guest star on Wagon Train. As with her film work, her television appearances were sporadic until the 1980s, from when she had appeared on a variety of television shows, including seven episodes of Knots Landing (over the period 1983‚Äì1990) and four episodes of Any Day Now (1998‚Äì2002). She portrayed character Glenda Vandervere in Murder, She Wrote (season two, episode 12: \\"Murder by Appointment Only\\") (01/05/1986). Perkins retired from acting after a 2006 six-episode arc on the television soap opera The Young and the Restless. Recent to her retirement, she was honored in the 2004 action-adventure video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, in which one of the storyline girlfriends to protagonist Carl \\"CJ\\" Johnson, voiced by Orfeh, was named after her. =Marriages= On April 15, 1960, she married actor Dean Stockwell. They divorced on July 30, 1962. She later married writer and director Robert Thom, who wrote the script for the popular 1968 movie Wild in the Streets, in which she appeared. They had two children: Lillie Thom (b. 1966) and Hedy Thom (b. 1969). Perkins and Thom had been separated for some time when Thom died in 1979.

He entered the University of Uppsala in 1677, and after gaining his degree entered the government office of land-surveying. He was sent in 1681 on professional business to Livonia, then under Swedish rule. A dissertation read at Leipzig in 1687 brought him the offer of a professorial chair in the university, which he refused. Returning to Sweden he executed commissions of land-surveying directed by King Charles XI, and in 1699 he became head of the whole department. In 1702 he was ennobled under the name of Dahlstjerna. He wandered over the whole of the coast of the Baltic: Livonia, R√ºgen and Swedish Pomerania, preparing maps which still exist in the office of public land-surveying in Stockholm. His death, which took place in Pomerania on his forty-eighth birthday, is said to have been hastened by the disastrous news of the Battle of Poltava. Dahlstierna's patriotism was touching in its pathos and intensity, and during his long periods of professional exile he comforted himself by the composition of songs to his beloved Sweden. His genius was most irregular, but at his best he easily surpasses all the Swedish poets of his time. His best-known original work is Kungaskald (Stettin, 1697), an elegy on the death of Charles XI. It is written in alexandrines, arranged in ottava rima. The poem is pompous and allegorical, but there are passages full of melody and high thoughts. Dahlstjerna was a reformer in language, and it has been well said by Atterbom that in this poem \\"he treats the Swedish speech just as dictatorially as Charles XI and Charles XII treated the Swedish nation.\\" In 1690 was printed at Stettin his paraphrase of the Pastor Fido of Guarini. His most popular work is his G√∂tha k√§mpavisa om Konungen och Herr Peder (\\"The Goth's Battle Song, concerning the King and Master Peter\\"; Stockholm, 1701). The King is Charles XII and Master Peter is the tsar of Russia. This spirited ballad lived almost until our own days on the lips of the people as a folk-song.

Formally known as the \\"International Copyright Act of 1891\\", but more commonly referred to as the \\"Chace Act\\" after Sen. Jonathan Chace of Rhode Island. The International Copyright Act of 1891 was created because many people shunned the idea of literary piracy. It was the first U.S. congressional act that offered copyright protection in the United States to citizens of countries other than the United States. The act extended limited protection to foreign copyright holders from select nations. It was also important for American creators since they were more likely to have international copyright protection in countries that were offered the same protection by the United States. The Act empowered the President to extend copyright to works of foreign nationals. The act was passed on March 3, 1891, by the 51st Congress. The Act went into effect on July 1, 1891. On July 3, 1891, the first foreign work, a play called Saints and Sinners by British author Henry Arthur Jones, was registered under the act.  Background = The protection of foreign works = During the time when the United States was just beginning to develop a literary tradition of its own, this nation refused to protect foreign works. As a result of this, American works were unprotected abroad and domestic publishers had to compete with each other for cheap editions of foreign works. Prior to the International Copyright Act, the first national copyright law was passed in 1790 and provided a copyright protection for 14 years, but only for authors who were citizens or residents of the United States. In order to get copyright protection in the rest of the world American authors were required to gain residency in the country in which they desired copyright protection. For example, Mark Twain obtained residency in Canada to protect his publication of The Prince and the Pauper. To protect foreign literature in the United States, British authors would have an American citizen serve as a collaborator in the publishing process, and then have the book registered in Washington, D.C. under the collaborator's name. It was not until the 1830s that the pressure to extend American copyright to foreign authors first developed. Both American and British authors and publishers joined forces and pushed for a bilateral treaty between the United States and England. Famous authors such as Charles Dickens came to the United States to show their support for international copyright. Their biggest problem were American printers that already were protected by a high tariff on imported works, and who had no wish to pay royalties to English writers or publishers. The United States discussed international copyright with Great Britain over the years. Congress requested correspondence to this effect in 1842. There was a proposed treaty in 1853 under Millard Fillmore, and consideration of its ratification continued into an extension provided during Franklin Pierce's presidency in 1854. Nonetheless, in the United States, only works published in the United States could be restricted with copyright. Authors including Mark Twain, Louisa May Alcott, Edward Eggleston, and Bill Nye wrote letters in the mid-1880s to the Century requesting international copyright. These letters to the journals had a strong effect on this issue, as did the American Copyright League that was formed in 1883. The League was a great supporter of an International Copyright Act and, at the Madison Square Theater in 1885, the League sponsored readings by American authors in aid of the League's cause. In 1885, United States Senator Joseph Roswell Hawley introduced a bill aimed at extending copyright to foreign authors for consideration by Congress. A chief difference between the Hawley Bill and the eventual Chace Bill was Hawley's removal of publisher and book-sellers' interests in the copyright process. It was ultimately unsuccessful, though Mark Twain involved himself in the lobbying process and influenced President Grover Cleveland's thinking on the matter. Cleveland asked Congress for legislation to this effect in his State of the Union address that December. = \\"National treatment\\" = While the United States was refusing any protection for foreign literary works, more and more countries in Europe started adapting the principle of \\"national treatment\\". This principle meant that each nation that signed the treaty was obligated to protect works produced by nationals of all other treaty members on the same terms that it protects its own nationals. In 1884, academics, writers and diplomats met in Berne, Switzerland, to begin the work to form a multilateral copyright treaty. This was based on the principle of national treatment together with minimum standards so that a member country would be free to treat the copyrighted work of its own nationals however they chose to, but when it came to the works from other treaty members it would have to obey certain minimum standards. The treaty was signed in 1886 but the United States was not one of its founding members. American representatives had attended the Bern conference only as observers and it would take another 5 years until the United States took its first step to protect foreign works. = Effects of the Act=  \\"The manufacturing clause\\"  Ever since the first national copyright law in 1790, the United States had required certain \\"statutory formalities\\" to acquire copyright protection. These formalities served as a test of an author's intention to claim protection for his or her work. The International Copyright Act of 1891 now applied these formalities to foreign publishers as well, but added an extra requirement called the \\"Manufacturing Clause\\". The Manufacturing Clause required that all copies of foreign literary works should be printed from type set in the United States if they were to have American protection. This was an obvious concession to American printers, since they might otherwise have opposed the Act. When the International Copyright Act of 1891 was finally passed, foreign authors had to have their works in Washington, D.C. \\"on or before the day of publication in this or any foreign country.\\" This too would create a problem, but by the early 1900s British authors were granted American Copyright since it was published abroad thirty days from its deposit in Washington, D.C. This would then allow American publishers time to release an authorized edition.  Provisions of the Act  The International Copyright Act of 1891 instituted important changes in copyright matters. One of the most extensive changes was that from the date the Act went into effect, all books were required to be manufactured in the United States in order to obtain American copyright. However, foreign authors had a better chance of protecting their works than before. This Act was the first step that the United States took towards an international copyright that could benefit foreign authors as well as domestic. Throughout time, the United States had been somewhat of a copyright outcast since they had not joined many international treaties or conventions. However, as the United States became a major exporter of copyrighted materials this changed. Even if there's still no such thing as an \\"international copyright\\" that will automatically protect an author's rights throughout the world, The International Copyright Act of 1891 was the first step to a number of international copyright treaties and conventions that the United States is now a part of (e.g. Berne Convention, Universal Copyright Convention, WIPO).

Early life He was from a rich family of great influence and his cousin was the chief of the imperial court at Alexandria, Egypt. He was very well educated and he studied the holy scriptures and excelled in their interpretation. Because of his knowledge, his righteousness and his charity toward the poor, he was ordained a deacon. By consensus he was chosen to be patriarch, although he never lived in any monastery. He remained in Alexandria all the days of his papacy, not intimidated by the authority of the Melkites. Sassanid conquest of Egypt from 618‚Äì621 Shortly after the ordination of Pope Andronicus, the Persian King Khosrau II and his army came with mighty power against the army of the Romans, and destroyed them utterly, and annihilated them. They took possession of the land of the Romans, and the cities of Halab & Antioch in Syria, and took captive the land of Jerusalem, Idumaea, and the land of Egypt. The Persians invaded outside the City of Alexandria, were there are 600 inhabited monasteries. The monks were independent, and insolent without fear, through their great wealth; and they did deeds of mockery. But the army of the Persians surrounded them on the west of the monasteries, and no place of refuge remained for them; and so they were all slain with the sword, except a few of them, who hid themselves, and so were safe. And all that was there of money and furniture was taken as plunder by the Persians; and they destroyed 600 monasteries located outside of Alexandria, which have remained in ruins to this day. When the people of in the City of Alexandria heard what they had done, because of their fear, they opened the gates of the city for them. King Khosrau II saw in a night dream someone saying to him, \\"I have delivered to you the city. Do not destroy it. But kill its heroes for they are hypocrites.\\" He arrested the Governor of the city, and tied him up in chains. He ordered the elders of the city to bring forth the men, from 18 to 50 years old to come forward to give everyone twenty denari, and to enlist them as soldiers for the city. 80,000 men came forward and he killed them all by the sword. Afterward, the Persian King with his army invaded Upper Egypt. He passed by the city of Niciu, which is also called Ibshadi. He heard that there were some 700 monks living in cells and caves. So he sent his troops and surrounded them, and when the sun rose, they entered and slew all of them with the sword, and not one of them remained. King Khosrau II continued to kill and imprisoned many Christians until Byzantine, Emperor Heraclius conquered Egypt and drove him out. After Pope Andronicus had accomplished six years in his patriarchal office, and had suffered from the Persians, and seen all these disasters, which he encountered and patiently endured, he went to his rest, and departed to the Lord in perfect peace, holding fast to the right faith, the faith of his fathers, on the 8th of Toba (January 16, 623).

The school is operated by the Whitgift Foundation, along with Whitgift School and Trinity School of John Whitgift.  History  School grounds, with Croydon Minster in the background The school was founded in 1889 by the Sisters of the Church. The \\"Old Palace\\" itself was for 500 years the summer residence of the Archbishops of Canterbury. In the 19th century the Archbishops ended their residence at Croydon Palace and used Addington Palace, also in Croydon, instead. The Palace was sold and subsequently used as a bleaching factory, amongst other things. The building was rescued by the Duke of Newcastle in 1887 and given to the Sisters Of The Church who used it for educational purposes. In 1945, the school became a Direct Grant Grammar School and in 1975, became a fully independent day school for girls. The school joined the Whitgift Foundation in 1993. The school merged with Croham Hurst School, a former independent school, in 2008. It is also home to a suspected ghost - The Green Lady - who was said to have lived there around the time of Queen Elizabeth I.  Grounds  The school building was for centuries the summer palace of the Archbishops of Canterbury. It began life as the manor house, part wooden from at least the 12th century, and stone from the 14th century. The core of today‚Äôs palace was built in the 15th century. The guardroom ‚Äì once a reception room, now a library ‚Äì dates from the time of Archbishop Thomas Arundel (1396-1414), and is one of the earliest uses of brick in Britain. Archbishop John Stafford (died 1452) built what is now one of the finest medieval great halls left in southern England. A number of monarchs from Henry VI to Elizabeth I banqueted under its high arched-brace roof, each sitting on Stafford‚Äôs stone throne, part of which survives against the west wall. Elizabeth made numerous visits, and her bed, always travelling with her, was set down in what is now known as Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs room, a large 15th-century first-floor space, with moulded ceiling joists. The chapel dates from the 15th century, and includes a gallery pew in dark oak often referred to as ‚ÄòQueen Elizabeth‚Äôs Pew', built by Archbishop William Laud. Beneath this is a Norman font gifted in Victorian times from St George‚Äôs Church, Southwark, the same font where Charles Dickens had Little Dorrit christened. The school also houses modern, purpose-built facilities including seven laboratories, a heated indoor swimming pool, and an Art and Technology building. In 2001 a building for the Junior Department and one housing the Sixth Form and P.E. area were opened. The school also benefits from access to Whitgift Foundation grounds and facilities.Old Palace of John Whitgift School, Croydon, Surrey  Notable alumni  *Jane Featherstone - Television Producer *Sarah Jones - Labour MP for Croydon Central from 2017 *Helen Young - weather forecaster and television presenter Houses All students are assigned to one of four houses named after notable people associated with the Palace.

It covers of Central Florida. It is located three miles (5 km) east of Ocala and southeast of Gainesville. The Ocala National Forest, established in 1908, is the oldest national forest east of the Mississippi River and the southernmost national forest in the continental U.S. The word Ocala is thought to be a derivative of a Timucuan term meaning \\"fair land\\" or \\"big hammock\\". The forest is headquartered in Tallahassee, as are all three National Forests in Florida, but there are local ranger district offices located in Silver Springs and Umatilla. Geography and ecology The Ocala National Forest lies between the Ocklawaha and St. Johns rivers in Central Florida. In descending order of land area it is located in parts of Marion, Lake, Putnam, and Seminole counties. The Ocala National Forest is in the southeastern conifer forests and the Florida sand pine scrub ecoregions. Dry, sandy areas support Florida longleaf pine sandhills and Florida peninsula inland scrub. Longleaf pine sandhills are woodlands dominated by longleaf pine (Pinus palustris). Inland scrub consists of sand pines (Pinus clausa) growing amid shrublands of evergreen oaks. Both of these pine communities are sustained by frequent fires. The Ocala National Forest contains a high proportion of remaining inland scrub habitat and is noted for its sand pine scrub ecosystem. The forest contains the largest concentration of sand pine in the world as well as some of the best remaining stands of longleaf pine in central Florida. Where fire is absent, southern coastal plain oak domes and hammocks can grow. These are small stands of thick evergreen oaks. The forest contains several slow-moving rivers and numerous wet \\"prairies\\". Blackwater rivers support southern coastal plain blackwater river floodplain forests of baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) along their banks. The forest's spring-fed rivers support southern coastal plain hydric hammocks, hammocks of evergreen and hardwood trees, near their floodplains. The prairies are Floridian highlands freshwater marshes. Southern coastal plain nonriverine basin swamps are large, seasonally flooded depressions of baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) and swamp tupelo (Nyssa biflora). The Ocala National Forest receives more visitors than any other national forest in the Sunshine State. Millions annually visit the forest, which is one of Central Florida's last remaining traces of forested land. The forest‚Äôs porous sands and largely undeveloped character provide an important recharge for the Floridan Aquifer. The Rodman Reservoir system forms most of the northern and north western border as part of the Ocklawaha River Basin. The Ocala Forest is also known for having over 600 natural lakes and ponds. Between the river boundaries of this Forest lie central highlands, coastal lowlands, swamps, springs and hundreds of lakes and ponds. Near the Juniper Prairie Wilderness and Juniper Springs is \\"The Yearling Trail\\", the location where The Yearling was filmed. Ocala has a wide variety of wildlife. The black bear population has its highest concentration here. Alligators, white-tailed deer, wild boar, and numerous small animals, including squirrels, bats, coyote, gray fox, red fox, opossum, raccoon, river otter, bobcat, skunk, southeastern pocket gopher, and nine-banded armadillo can be found as well. The sandy soil is home to the gopher tortoise. The United States Navy's Pinecastle Bombing Range in the Ocala National Forest is the only place on the East Coast where the Navy can do live impact training. The Navy drops nearly 20,000 bombs a year at the site, a few hundred of which are live. The Pinecastle Bombing Range is a fenced area, with the eastern edge of the range located about west of State Road 19 and the Camp Ocala campgrounds, and one-half mile (800 m) west of the Farles Lake campground. F/A-18 Hornet jet fighters and other aircraft take off from Naval Air Station Jacksonville or from aircraft carriers off the Florida coast, fly low over the forest, and drop their bombs in the middle of the range. P-3 Orion and P-8 Poseidon aircraft will also use an instrumented range in the southeast quadrant of Lake George to conduct aerial mining training utilizing inert 500lb mines. All air-to-ground exercises using conventional ordnance up to and including MK 82 bombs and five-inch (127 mm) Zuni rockets are authorized. Napalm and High Explosive Incendiary (HEI) are prohibited. Live ordnance is restricted to the Live Ordnance Impact Area; inert ordnance is used on all other targets. Pinecastle targets have also been certified for laser operations. The Navy has used the area for target practice for 50 years under a special use permit from the U.S. Forest Service. The ghost town of Kerr City is in the forest. It is located on County Road 316 just west of State Road 19. Activities The Ocala National Forest offers an accommodating climate for year-round recreation. The mild winters are fine for family camping while a summer canoe trip down a palm-lined stream is a cool way to spend an August day. The temperatures for the dry months of November through February range from a daily average of to a high of . The summer season is much warmer and wetter. Short afternoon thundershowers often raise the humidity to about 90% while the temperatures range from to . The average rainfall is approximately per year. Water plays an important part in a variety of recreational opportunities in the forest. Activities range from canoeing, boating, fishing, skiing, snorkeling, scuba diving, swimming and the use of personal watercraft. Several boat ramps are available in the forest. Many hiking trails run through the forest including the Florida Trail, Salt Springs Observation Trail, Lake Eaton Sinkhole Trail, St. Francis Trail, and Yearling Trail. Hidden Pond in the Juniper Prairie Wilderness portion of the Ocala National Forest. Yearling Trail sign within the forest. Bicyclists can travel along a challenging long ride on the Paisley Woods Bicycle Trail. Because this trail is not paved, bicycles need to be suited for rough terrain. Mountain bikes are ideal and encouraged for this environment. The Ocala National Forest offers many locations to ride Off Road Vehicles. Currently, two trail systems offer a variety of recreation experiences: (1) the Ocala North OHV Trail System offers a longer experience with six distinct trail loops totaling and (2) the Wandering Wiregrass OHV Trail in the Southeast portion of the forest offers shorter day-use riding with a trail length of . A new trail system was added in 2008 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the forest. It is part of the south trail system off FR 573.. A small trail long called the Scrubjay and a longer trail long called the Centennial may be accessed from trailheads off FR 573, SR 40 and the Big Scrub Campground. There are areas that are restricted to off road vehicles; a detailed forest map can help provide information on areas open to off road vehicles. There are many trails for horseback riding in the forest. Forest riding trails are actually old roads wide, marked at intervals with painted spots ‚Äì called blazes ‚Äì on the trees. Some of the best trails include the One Hundred Mile trail and the LAM trail. The Ocala National Forest is a wildlife management area, in which hunting and fishing activities are managed by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. A permit is required for all hunters (except those indicated as exempt) to hunt in this area. A Quota Hunt Permit may also be required during certain time periods or certain game.

Gielis suggested that the formula can be used to describe many complex shapes and curves that are found in nature. Gielis has filed a patent application related to the synthesis of patterns generated by the superformula. In polar coordinates, with r the radius and \\\\varphi the angle, the superformula is: :r\\\\left(\\\\varphi\\\\right) = \\\\left( \\\\left \\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{m\\\\varphi}{4}\\\\right)}{a} \\\\right ^{n_2} \\\\+ \\\\left \\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{m\\\\varphi}{4}\\\\right)}{b} \\\\right ^{n_3} \\\\right) ^{-\\\\frac{1}{n_{1}}}. By choosing different values for the parameters a, b, m, n_1, n_2, and n_3, different shapes can be generated. The formula was obtained by generalizing the superellipse, named and popularized by Piet Hein, a Danish mathematician.  2D plots  In the following examples the values shown above each figure should be m, n1, n2 and n3. 480px A GNU Octave program for generating these figures function sf2d(n, a) u = [0:.001:2 * pi]; raux = abs(1 / a(1) .* abs(cos(n(1) * u / 4))) .^ n(3) + abs(1 / a(2) .* abs(sin(n(1) * u / 4))) .^ n(4); r = abs(raux) .^ (- 1 / n(2)); x = r .* cos(u); y = r .* sin(u); plot(x, y); end  Extension to higher dimensions  It is possible to extend the formula to 3, 4, or n dimensions, by means of the spherical product of superformulas. For example, the 3D parametric surface is obtained by multiplying two superformulas r1 and r2. The coordinates are defined by the relations: : x = r_1(\\\\theta)\\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\cdot r_2(\\\\phi)\\\\cos\\\\phi, : y = r_1(\\\\theta)\\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\cdot r_2(\\\\phi)\\\\cos\\\\phi, : z = r_2(\\\\phi)\\\\sin\\\\phi, where \\\\phi (latitude) varies between ‚àíœÄ/2 and œÄ/2 and Œ∏ (longitude) between ‚àíœÄ and œÄ.  3D plots  3D superformula: a = b = 1; m, n1, n2 and n3 are shown in the pictures.

Parish church The church of Saint John the Baptist's Head. Trimingham parish church is St John the Baptist's Head. This dedication dates to the medieval period, when a life size alabaster head of the saint was kept at the church. St John's shrine altar was visited by pilgrims who came to the church rather than make the journey to Amiens Cathedral, where a relic, said to be the real head of John the Baptist, was kept. The alabaster head did not survive and although it is unknown exactly what happened to it, it has been suggested that it was probably destroyed by Anglican reformers as a result of the 1538 Injunction against images during the reign of Henry VIII. Another theory is that the head was destroyed as a result of a further injunction which was rigorously imposed in 1547, during the early weeks of the reign of Edward VI. Today an alabaster head survives in the Victoria and Albert Museum and it is thought that the head at Trimingham was exactly like the head in the museum collection. The village hall is called 'pilgrim shelter' as a reminder of Trimingham's past as a site of pilgrimage. The church has a short tower which is thought to be unfinished. It has heavy buttresses on the west elevation which suggest that a fault in the construction of the church may well have been the reasoning for the unfinished tower. The nave to the east cuts around the buttress to embrace it. This peculiarity may be partly the result of a restoration by Thomas Jekyll in the 1850s. Pevsner states in his survey book, that Thomas Jekyll completely rebuilt the nave of which the most notable feature is the way that the tower buttresses on the east side project into the nave.Norfolk 1: Norwich and North-East, By Nikolaus Pevsner and Bill Wilson The church's rood screen has four figures on either side of the entrance to the chancel: St Edmund with his arrow, St Clare with her book and monstrance, St Clement with his anchor and crozier, and St James in his pilgrim's robes. On the south side are St Petronella with her book and keys, St Cecilia with her garland of flowers, St Barbara with her tower, and St Jeron with his hawk. The east window of the church is credited to H Wilkinson and dates from 1925.Norfolk 1: Norwich and North-East, By Nikolaus Pevsner and Bill Wilson the window depicts 'Christ in Majesty' flanked by St Michael and St Gabriel, with the symbols of the four Evangelists surrounding them.

Before the show, a large area of the park had been a quarry. It was transformed into a park with exhibition sites for the show, and has remained, hosting horticultural events on a regular basis, including the ‚ÄúBundesgartenschau‚Äù and the IGA (Internationale Gartenbauausstellung), both garden festivals. The Killesbergpark bordered for many years the city's fairgrounds. In 2007, Messe Stuttgart moved to new ground close to Stuttgart Airport. Every July the park hosts the popular Lichterfest Stuttgart. Thousands of lanterns are placed around the park, decorating the park for a variety of family activities throughout. After dark, there is a fireworks show accompanied by music. Visitors often bring blankets to sit on for the show. Killesberg railway Since its opening, the park has been home to the 381-millimetre (15-inch) narrow-gauge Killesberg railway. In the summer months, visitors can see two diesel and two steam locomotives, which have been fixtures in the park since 1950. The horticultural show of 1939 saw the opening of the railway, when two borrowed steam engines from Leipzig traversed a short stretch of track. During World War II, the steam engines were returned to Leipzig for use there. New locomotives were purchased, and today there are two diesel and three steam engines in use. Killesberg tower Completed in 2001 the Killesberg Tower is a 40m high observation tower, overlooking the park. It was designed by J√∂rg Schlaich, using cable-stayed bridge technology.Killesberg Tower. Structurae. Retrieved 2009-11-11. Other features From the 1950s until the 1980s there was a chair lift for visitors to enjoy views of the fairgrounds and parklands. The twenty-metre high Bismarck tower stands one kilometre south-west of the exhibition halls. It was built on the Gaehkopf, the highest point in northern Stuttgart, giving good views of Stuttgart itself and in all directions. It was one of many towers built to commemorate Otto von Bismarck. The building of over 410 Bismarck towers worldwide was planned, and 238 were actually built. The building of the tower was begun in 1902 by the students of the technical university in Stuttgart. The Stuttgart Bismarck tower was opened on 16 July 1904. In 2004, for its 100th anniversary, it was comprehensively renovated.

He was an influential literary figure of the Swedish Enlightenment. Dalin, Olof von (Svenskt biografiskt handlexikon) Background Olof Dalin was born in the parish of Vinberg in Halland. His parents were Jonas Dalin and Margareta Birgitta Auseen. His father was the parish minister. His birth name prior to knighthood was Dahlin. Olof Dalin's father had taken his name from his hometown, Dalstorp in the County of √Ñlvsborg. He was closely related to Andreas Rydelius (1671‚Äì1738), Bishop of Lund, and he was sent at a very early age to be instructed by him. Carl Linnaeus was one of his fellow-pupils. Career Den Svenska Argus December 13, 1732 In 1723, while studying at Lund University, he first accompanying his stepfather, Severin B√∂ckman, to Stockholm and in 1726 he entered into public office there. Under the patronage of Baron Claes R√•lamb (1682‚Äì1751) he rapidly rose to favor, and his skill and intelligence won him a golden reputation. In the 1730s, Dalin wrote plays for the theatre, inspired by French dramas and much admired by his contemporaries. In 1733 he started the weekly Svenska Argus, on the model of Joseph Addison's The Spectator, writing anonymously till 1736. Svenska Argus was a champion of the Enlightenment and aimed to raise the level of culture in Sweden . His next work was Tankar √∂fver Critiquer (1736). Skriftst√§llare. Olof Dalin (Svensk litteraturhistoria i sammandrag) He became Royal Librarian (1737‚Äì39) and was later appointed Rikshistoriograf (National Historiographer) (1755‚Äì56). With the avowed purpose of enlarging the horizons of his cultivation and tastes, Dalin set off, in the company of his pupil, Baron R√•lamb's son, on a tour through Germany and France, in 1739-1740. Upon his return, the shifting political life at home caused him to write his famous satirical allegories, Sagan om H√§sten and Aprilverk (1738), that were very popular and inspired countless imitations. During the early part of his life, he was universally admitted to be facile princeps among the Swedish poets of his time. His dramas were also of interest, particularly his comedy of Den afvundsjuke (1738). He also wrote a tragedy, Brynilda (1759), and a pastoral in three scenes upon King Adolphus Frederick's return from Finland. His didactic epos of Svenska Friheten appeared in 1742. Hitherto, Addison and Alexander Pope had been his models. In this work he draws his inspiration from Thomson, whose poem, Liberty, he emulated. In 1742, he was made a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Dalin started publishing his Swedish history, Svea Rikes Historia in 1747. He would die before this work was complete.Andrew Ramsay‚Äôs and Olof Dalin‚Äôs influence on the Romantic Interpretation of Old Norse Mythology (Lars L√∂nnroth. Gothenburg University) On the accession of King Adolphus Frederick of Sweden in 1751, Dalin received the post of Tutor to the crown prince - afterwards Gustavus III. He had enjoyed the confidence of Queen Louisa Ulrika, sister of Frederick the Great of Prussia, while she was crown princess, and she now made him secretary of the Swedish Academy of Letters, founded by her in 1753. His position at court involved him in the queen's political intrigues, and separated him to a vexatious degree from the studies wherein he had hitherto been absorbed. He held the post of Tutor to the crown prince until 1756, when he was arrested on suspicion of taking part in the attempted coup d'√©tat that year, and was tried for his life before the diet. He was acquitted, but was forbidden to show himself at court on any pretense. This period of exile, lasting until 1761, Dalin spent in the preparation of the third volume of his great historical work, the Svea Rikes historia, that related events up to the death of King Charles IX of Sweden in 1611. The first two volumes appeared in 1746-1750; the third, in two parts, in 1760-1762. Dalin had been made a noble in 1751, and made privy councillor in 1753. In 1761, he once more took his place at court. During his exile, however, his spirit and his health had been broken. In a fit of panic, he had destroyed some manuscripts of his best unpublished works, and this he constantly brooded over. In 1763, he died at his house in Drottningholm. Posthumous works In the year 1767, his writings in belles lettres were issued in six volumes, edited by his half brother, J. C. B√∂kman. Amid an enormous mass of occasional verses, anagrams, epigrams, impromptus and the like, his satires and serious poems were almost buried. But some of these former, even, are found to be songs of remarkable grace and delicacy, and many display a love of natural scenery, and a knowledge of its forms.

He represented the Social Democrats as a member of the Danish parliament (Folketinget) from 1971 until his death. Auken held a degree in political science from the University of Aarhus and also taught there for a period in the very early 1970s. He was Minister of Employment from 1 October 1977 to 10 September 1982 in the Cabinet of Anker J√∏rgensen II, III, IV, and V. In 1987 Svend Auken succeeded J√∏rgensen as leader of the Danish Social Democrats, at that time an opposition party to the government of Prime Minister Poul Schl√ºter. After making big gains in the 1990 general election, he was subsequently unable to put together a workable coalition, partly because of bad personal relations with prominent politicians in the traditional coalition party of the Social Democrats, Det Radikale Venstre (The Social Liberal Party of Denmark). His position as leader of the Social Democrats was challenged in 1992 by Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, who went on to win the internal election. That gave Auken the dubious distinction of being the first Social Democratic leader since 1910 to not become prime minister. (Subsequently, this has happened to Mogens Lykketoft, leader from 2002 to 2005, as well.) Poul Nyrup Rasmussen went on to become Prime Minister of Denmark in 1993, and Auken served as Minister for the Environment from 25 January 1993 to 27 September 1994 in the Cabinet of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen I and was Minister for the Environment and Energy from 27 September 1994 to 27 November 2001 in the Cabinet of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen II, III and IV. After the defeat of Rasmussen's government in the general election of 2001, Svend Auken continued to serve as a member of the Danish parliament. He was the EU-affairs spokesman of his party until his death, and he maintained a high profile on environmental issues. Svend Auken was generally acknowledged to be one of the most naturally gifted and charismatic Danish politicians of his generation, and he is sometimes referred to as \\"the best Prime Minister Denmark never had\\".Obituary in Jyllands-Posten 5th paragraph, 4 August 2009 He is one of the few Danish politicians to be honoured in the United States House of Representatives..

The landmark Tagblatt-Turm was designed by architect Ernst Otto O√üwald, and is one of Germany's earliest high-rises, constructed between 1924 and 1928 and made from crushed stone and cement. It was the tallest building in the city after the old 1905 city hall, and the highest office building in Germany. Its modern design caused controversy during construction, however, the building has since been recognized as a cultural and architectural landmark. The earliest high-rise office building erected from cement and steel was the Zeiss Building in Jena, built by the Dywidag company of Nuremberg in 1912 to house Zeiss' corporate headquarters. From 1928 to 1943, the tower was the seat of the editorship and publishing house of the Stuttgarter Neues Tagblatt, a local newspaper; the building derives its name from this original tenant. After World War II until 1978, the tower served as the headquarters for the two newspapers Stuttgarter Zeitung and the Stuttgarter Nachrichten.

One hypothesis for Narcisse's account was that he had been administered a combination of psychoactive substances (oftentimes the paralyzing pufferfish venom tetrodotoxin and the strong deliriant Datura), which rendered him helpless and seemingly dead. The single greatest proponent of this possibility was Wade Davis, a graduate student in ethnobotany at Harvard University, who published two popular books based on his travels and ideas during and immediately following his graduate training. However, subsequent scientific examinations (using tools of analytical chemistry alongside critical review of earlier reports) have failed to support the presence of the claimed key pharmacologically active compounds in the supposed zombie preparation, which was central to the phenomena and mechanism reported by Davis. No further supporting evidence has appeared. Biography Narcisse admitted himself to the Schweitzer Hospital (operated by American medical staff) in Deschapelles, Haiti, on April 30, 1962.Gino Del Guercio (1986). The Secrets of Haiti's Living Dead. Harvard Magazine, Jan-Feb 1986. He had a fever and fatigue, and was spitting up blood. Doctors could find no explanation for his symptoms which gradually grew worse until he died three days later. He was pronounced dead, and held in cold storage for about a day before burial In 1980, a man identifying himself as Clairvius Narcisse approached Angelina Narcisse in the city of L'Est√®re and said he was her late brother, convincing her and several other villagers by using a childhood nickname and sharing intimate family information. He claimed that he'd been conscious but paralyzed during his supposed death and burial, and had subsequently been removed from his grave and forced to work at a sugar plantation. Per this account, after his apparent death and subsequent burial on May 2, 1962, his body was recovered and he was given a paste possibly made from datura, which at certain doses has a hallucinogenic effect and can cause memory loss. The bokor who recovered him then, as stated, reportedly forced him, alongside others, to work on a sugar plantation until the master's death two years later. When the bokor died, and regular doses of the hallucinogen ceased, he eventually regained sanity and returned to his family after another 16 years. Narcisse was immediately recognized by the villagers and his family. When he told them the story of how he was dug up from his grave and enslaved, the villagers were surprised, but they accepted his story because they believed his experience resulted from the power of voodoo magic. He was seen as the man who was once a zombie. It has been further argued that Narcisse had broken one of the traditional behavioral codes by abandoning his children and was made into a \\"zombie\\" as a punishment. When questioned, Narcisse told investigators that the sorcerer involved had \\"taken his soul\\". The instigator of the poisoning was alleged to be Clairvius's brother, with whom Clairvius had quarreled over land and inheritance. This case puzzled many doctors because Narcisse's death was documented and verified by the testimonies of two American doctors. The case of Narcisse was argued to be the first verifiable example of the transformation of an individual into a zombie. Narcisse's story intrigued Haitian psychiatrist Lamarque Douyon. Though dismissing supernatural explanations, Douyon believed there was some degree of truth to tales of zombies and he had been studying such accounts for decades. Suspecting zombies were somehow drugged and then revived, Douyon reached out to colleagues in America. Davis traveled to Haiti, where he obtained samples of powders purportedly used to create zombies. Hypothesis and research Based on the presumption that tetrodotoxin and related toxins are not always fatal, but at near-lethal doses can leave a person in a state of near-death for several days with the person remaining conscious, tetrodotoxin has been alleged to turn human beings into zombies, and has been suggested as an ingredient in Haitian Vodou preparations. This idea appeared in print as early as the 1938 non- fiction book Tell My Horse by Zora Neale Hurston, which reported multiple accounts of purported tetrodotoxin poisoning in Haiti, by a Bokor (voodoo sorcerer).Hurston, Zora N., 2008, Tell My Horse, Modern Classics series, New York, NY: Harper Perennial, 2008. The concept was subsequently popularized in the 1980s by ethnobotanist Wade Davis.Wade Davis, 1985, The Serpent and the Rainbow. However, subsequent research has discredited the tetrodotoxin-zombie hypothesis by using analytical chemistry-based tests of multiple preparations, and review of earlier reports (see below). After various anthropological investigations of \\"zombie\\" stories in various cultures‚Äîincluding Narcisse and a handful of others‚Äîreports appeared that Narcisse received a dose of a chemical mixture containing tetrodotoxin (a pufferfish toxin) and bufotoxin (a toad toxin) to induce a coma that mimicked the appearance of death. He was then allowed to return to his home where he collapsed, \\"died\\", and was buried. The Canadian ethnobotanist Wade Davis, who did research related to the implication that tetrodotoxin was present,Davis, Wade, 1988, \\"Letters: Zombification\\" [Response to W. Booth, \\"Voodoo science\\"], Science, 240(4860), 24 June 1988, pp. 1715‚Äì16, , see , accessed 26 July 2105.Booth, W. 1988, \\"News and Comment: Voodoo science,\\" Science, 240(4850), 15 April 1988, pp. 274‚Äì77, , see , accessed 26 July 2105. hypothesized how this might have been done. The bokor (sorcerer) would have given Narcisse a powder containing the tetrodotoxin through abraded skin. Narcisse would then have fallen into a comatose state, closely resembling death, which resulted in his live burial.\\"American Scientist Interviews: Wade Davis on Zombies, Folk Poisons, and Haitian Culture.\\" American Scientist 75.4 (1987): 412‚Äì14. Print. His body would then have been recovered and he would have been given doses of Datura stramonium to create a compliant zombie-like state, and set to work on a plantation. After two years, the plantation owner died and Narcisse would have simply walked away to freedom. Skepticism While in these popular accounts, and in Haiti, tetrodotoxin is thought to have been used in voodoo preparations, in so-called zombie poisons, subsequent careful analysis has repeatedly called these accounts and early analytical studies into question on technical grounds; moreover, they have failed to identify the toxin in any such preparation,Kao, C.Y., and T. Yasumoto, 1986, \\"Tetrodotoxin and the Haitian zombie.\\" Toxicon, 24: 747‚Äì49.Kao, C.Y., and T. Yasumoto, 1990, \\"Tetrodotoxin in 'zombie powder.'\\" Toxicon, 28: 29‚Äì132.Terence Hines, 2008, \\"Zombies and Tetrodotoxin,\\" Skeptical Inquirer (online), Volume 32.3, May/June 2008, pp. 60‚Äì62, see , accessed 25 July 2015. such that discussion of the matter of tetrodotoxin use in this way has all but disappeared from the primary literature since the early 1990s. Kao and Yasumoto concluded in the first of their papers in 1986 (and remained unswerving on the matter in their later work) that \\"the widely circulated claim in the lay press to the effect that tetrodotoxin is ... causal agent\\" in a \\"zombification process\\" is, in their view, \\"without factual foundation.\\" Kao, of the State University of New York, on interview on the matter in 1988, stated, \\"I actually feel this is an issue of fraud in science\\". A supporter of Wade, Bo Holmstedt of the Karolinska Institute, more restrained, stated that it was \\"not deliberated fraud,\\" rather that it was \\"withholding negative data\\" and therefore \\"simply bad science.\\" Davis responded formally to the charges, arguing the variability of the preparations (as cause for Kao's inability to find the toxin in any) and possible ineptitude in dissolving the toxin by the otherwise admittedly expert Kao, and speculating on the presence of \\"other ingredients\\" in the preparations to \\"enable transport across the blood‚Äìbrain barrier\\" thus providing the needed \\"reduction of three orders of magnitude\\" of the amount needed to result in the claimed effects, and arguing that \\"only when the bokor ‚Ä¶ causes others to believe the victim is dead and then revived\\" do his efforts become apparent, and that only a single \\"success ‚Ä¶ would be sufficient to support the cultural belief in the ‚Ä¶ phenomenon.\\" As of 1990, his critics were unpersuaded, and no literature to support the original contentions has yet appeared as of 2015, although lively popular description, especially on the web, continues. Cinema Narcisse's story was loosely adapted into the The Serpent and the Rainbow, a 1988 American horror film directed by Wes Craven. Zombi Child, a 2019 French drama film, is also inspired by his story.

His nickname from his NFL days was \\"The Hutch\\". Hutcherson died on December 18, 2013, after more than a decade-long battle with prostate and bone cancer. Ken Hutcherson is survived by his mother, wife, and four children. Football career =College career= Hutcherson attended Anniston High School. He played linebacker for Livingston University (now the University of West Alabama) from 1970 to 1973. He was a starting outside linebacker for the Tiger's 1971 NAIA National Championship team, and was an All-American both his junior and senior seasons. He was the NAIA National Player of the Week in 1972 when he made 21 tackles against Southern State. Hutcherson was named GSC Defensive Player of the Year in 1972, and was an All-GSC and All-Alabama Small College selection. In 1973, he led his team with 86 tackles. In 1985, he was inducted into the West Alabama Tigers Athletics Hall of Fame. =Professional career= Hutcherson was selected in the fourth round (97th overall) of the 1974 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys, after dropping because he was seen as an undersized player. He tore cartilage in his knee during rookie orientation practices in the spring. He overcame the surgery to report on time to training camp. He was a backup outside linebacker and a standout on special teams. On September 9, 1975, he was traded to the San Diego Chargers in exchange for a seventh round draft choice (#186-Greg Schaum). He was released by the Chargers after being hampered with a leg injury during the season and was claimed by the Green Bay Packers, who placed him immediately on the injured reserve list. The Seattle Seahawks selected him from the Packers roster in the 1976 NFL Expansion Draft. On September 7, 1976, he was placed on the injured reserve list with torn knee ligaments. The next year, he couldn't pass the Seahawks physical exam and left the team. Pastoral career After ending his football career, Hutcherson conducted theological studies at Cascade Bible College in Bellevue, Washington in 1979. After finishing his studies, he served eight years as director of high school ministries at Westminster Chapel in Bellevue. In 1984, he started the multicultural Antioch Bible Church in Kirkland, Washington, along with Mark Webster and Dwight Englund. Hutcherson accepted the position of senior pastor in 1985 and was ordained in 1986. Regarding the modern day Christian church, Hutcherson believed \\"the greatest need today in the church - which does not seem to be important in the average church - is the training of people in evangelism, discipleship and the responsibility they have for the church and responsibility they have for God.\\" In early 2010, Hutcherson shot a video for the I Am Second organization, in which he shared his testimony. In the video, Hutcherson talked about his experiences with racism growing up in the Deep South in the 1950s and 60s, and revealed that he grew to hate white people. The hatred, however, left him feeling empty and that's when he \\"ran into Jesus Christ.\\" Hutcherson and Rush Limbaugh were close friends, and the two spent a good amount of time together. Publicly, Hutcherson would often call in to The Rush Limbaugh Show around NFL playoff and Super Bowl time. He also officiated at Limbaugh's fourth wedding in June 2010. On his show of December 19, 2013, one day after Hutcherson's death, Limbaugh reflected on what Hutcherson meant to him and on the impact his death would have on others: \\"He was a man, folks. There was no complaining. There was no bleeding on people. There was none of that. He didn't want his relationship with anybody to be defined, even in what turned out to be the latter months of his life, by his illness. He was a devout Christian. He was a devout practicing Christian. And, as such, I don't think that he feared death because of that. But he's gone now, and it's a great, great loss for his congregation and his family because he's a unique individual. Nobody can be replaced when they're gone, but he's created an especially huge void for a lot of people because he was a counselor to people in trouble, no matter what the problem was.\\" Hutcherson also made frequent appearances on Glenn Beck's programs. On December 17, 2013, Beck posted a 10-minute video on his website, in which he talked at length about his relationship with Hutcherson. Beck tweeted the same day: \\"I just spoke to Hutch tonight. He is dying. He promised me that he will wait until I can get there Friday. Pray for his sweet wife and children.\\" Hutcherson would die the next day. Often a sparring partner of Hutcherson's, gay activist and The Stranger reporter Eli Sanders wrote a blog post one day after Hutcherson's death, entitled: \\"Ken Hutcherson's Last Goodbye (To Me)\\". In the post, Sanders revealed that Hutcherson had sent him a New Testament Bible in the mail in April 2011 and had embossed his name on the front. Inside, Hutcherson wrote: \\"Eli, now you can know what we are talking about! - Dr. Ken Hutcherson, Rom. 12:1-2\\". In the post, Sanders wrote, \\"I will miss him.\\" Battling cancer Hutcherson battled prostate and bone cancer for 13 years before passing away on December 18, 2013. In July 2013, Hutcherson told TheBlaze.com: \\"I've had cancer for 13 years and I have been condemned to die for five. Cancer is one of the greatest things that ever happened to me.\\" Hutcherson went on, saying: \\"God trusts me to suffer for him. There's nothing that can touch me that's not filtered through the hands of God. What cancer has done is given me an absolute focus on Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior.\\" Hutcherson also told KVI host John Carlson in July 2012, \\"As a Christian, my perspective about living and dying is totally different from most. I believe in Christ, that he is sovereign; God is in control. And I believe the Bible, which tells me in Romans 8:28-30, there's nothing that comes to me that isn't for my best. There's nothing that can touch me that is not for my best. Everything that makes me more like Christ that comes into my life is for my best.\\" Opposition to homosexuality =Objections to homosexuality becoming a civil right= Hutcherson strongly objected to suggestions that opposition to discrimination based on sexual orientation bore a resemblance to the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. An opinion piece by Hutcherson published in The Seattle Times on March 29, 2004, stated, \\"It has been said loudly and proudly that gay marriage is a civil rights issue. If that's the case, then gays would be the new African Americans. I'm here to tell you now, and hopefully for the last time, that the gay community is not the new African-American community.\\" On March 2, 2006, Hutcherson and King County Executive Ron Sims, himself a Baptist minister and a supporter of gay marriage, met at Seattle Town Hall to debate publicly the question \\"Is the gay rights movement the new civil rights movement?\\" The debate, sponsored by The Stranger, drew around 800 people. On April 25, 2008, Hutcherson, along with approximately 100 other people, protested at Mount Si High School during the Day of Silence event. =Anti- discrimination legislation= Hutcherson was a vocal opponent of state anti- discrimination laws that were based on sexual orientation. On February 9, 2006, Tim Eyman lodged referendum Initiative 65, which sought a public vote to repeal the Murray Anderson Civil Rights Bill before it could take effect on June 7, 2006. Hutcherson supported the initiative and conducted petition signature gathering at his home church. When the June 6, 2006 deadline arrived, the campaign announced they had failed to collect the 112,400 signatures required to qualify for the ballot. Hutcherson proceeded to lodge his own ballot initiative on January 19, 2007. Initiative 963 proposed removing any reference to sexual orientation from existing anti-discrimination legislation. The initiative required 224,800 valid signatures be collected by the July 6, 2007 deadline in order to qualify for the ballot. On January 27, 2007, The Seattle Times reported that Hutcherson had allied with a network of churches, including Watchmen on the Walls, that were tied to conservative evangelical Slavic communities in Washington State and California that had been active in opposing same-sex marriage. On June 29, 2007, Hutcherson told The Seattle Times that he had dropped the initiative at the urging of Pastor Joe Fuiten, who argued that the time was not right for the campaign, and asked instead for his help in opposing domestic partnership rights for gay and lesbian couples. Microsoft In 2005, the Seattle weekly newspaper The Stranger reported that Hutcherson persuaded Microsoft to withdraw support for the Washington anti-discrimination bill that would have made it illegal to fire an employee due to their sexual orientation. Hutcherson had reportedly told the Microsoft general counsel that 700 evangelical Microsoft employees attend his church, and all of them opposed the bill. He added that if Microsoft did not withdraw support of the bill, he would organize a national boycott of the software maker. Sometime after the meeting, Microsoft changed its long held position on the issue from support to neutral stating that anti- discrimination was not a priority for that legislative session. A few weeks later, after protests from Microsoft employees and advocacy groups, Microsoft's gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender employee resource group, the company reversed itself and pledged to support future anti-discrimination legislation. The Anderson Murray Civil Rights Bill was passed in the Washington State House on January 20, 2006, in the Senate on January 27, 2006, and signed into law by Governor Christine Gregoire on January 31, 2006. When the bill was passed, Hutcherson again called for a boycott, but no such organized effort emerged. On January 25, 2006, Hutcherson called for supporters to take action against Microsoft for reinstating its support of the Washington State Anti-Discrimination bill by driving down the company's stock price. Hutcherson asked that supporters purchase one or two Microsoft shares over the following months with the goal of selling them on May 1, 2006. Market experts stated that the \\"buy-and-dump\\" plan had no realistic chance of affecting Microsoft stock while legal scholars warned that the plan could be considered illegal market manipulation. Microsoft maintained its support of the bill and on May 1, 2006 Microsoft shares closed up 14 cents on the previous day's close. On November 13, 2007, Hutcherson addressed the Microsoft Annual Stockholders meeting. During the question and answer session, he referred to previous discussions with Microsoft executives regarding their support for anti-discrimination legislation in Washington State and threatened further action against the company without clearly specifying the policy position or activity he hopes to change. Hutcherson half-jokingly stated \\"I could work with you, or I could be your worst nightmare, because I am a black man with a righteous cause, with a host of powerful white people behind me...\\". After Hutcherson's comments, one attendee asked what shareholders could do to help the company to oppose Hutcherson. Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith responded, \\"As a company, we've had a clear policy with respect to the way we treat our people, and we believe in that policy. It's a policy that's founded on non-discrimination, it's a policy that we believe has served our employees well, it's served our shareholders well, and I think that was reflected last year when all of our shareholders were asked to vote on that policy, and over 97 percent of you and all of our other shareholders stood up and agreed with us. And I think that it is precisely in that form that shareholders have the opportunity to continue to make their views known, and we very much appreciate that support\\". On November 16, 2007, an interview appeared in The Daily Telegraph, a UK newspaper, where Hutcherson described his plan to ask millions of evangelical activists, Orthodox religious and other allies, to purchase Microsoft shares and demand a return to 'traditional values'. He described Microsoft as just the first company to be targeted in a larger campaign that would attempt to force American corporations to support only biblically-based social policy positions. In the article, Hutcherson alleged that there were \\"256 Fortune 500 companies alone pouring millions upon millions of dollars into pushing the homosexual agenda...\\" but he did not cite his source for the number. In a January 12, 2008 radio interview on Sirius OutQ with Michelangelo Signorile, Hutcherson once again claimed that Microsoft was advocating in support of same-sex marriage. On January 8, 2008, Hutcherson announced details of his \\"Buy Three, Donate One\\" campaign which asked supporters to purchase three shares of Microsoft stock, donate one share to the \\"AGN Financial Network,\\" and prepare to vote on a Shareholder Proposal that would be presented at the next Microsoft Stockholders Annual meeting in November 2008. =Hate crimes legislation= On April 17, 2007, Hutcherson was scheduled to participate in a press conference hosted by Exodus International opposing passage of the federal Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007. The event, to be held at the National Press Club, was intended to put pressure on lawmakers to drop the legislation which proposed adding sexual orientation and gender identity to the currently protected classes of race, color, religion and national origin. The press conference was cancelled in the wake of the Virginia Tech shooting. The Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007 passed the House on May 3, 2007, by a vote of 237 to 180. On June 18, 2007, Hutcherson and 29 other African-American pastors in the High Impact Leadership Coalition publicly opposed the Senate's hate crimes bill, then named the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act, on 1st Amendment grounds. =Same-sex marriage= On May 1, 2004, Hutcherson organized a \\"Mayday for Marriage\\" rally against same-sex marriage. The highly publicized effort drew an estimated 20,000 supporters from around the Puget Sound region to Safeco Field in Seattle, Washington. Later, in October 2004, he organized another \\"Mayday for Marriage\\" rally in Washington, D.C. which attracted an estimated 140,000 participants. * Hutcherson, Ken, \\"Here Comes the Bride : The Church: What We Are Meant to Be\\". 2000. * Hutcherson, Ken, \\"Before All Hell Breaks Loose : Preparing for the Coming Perilous Times\\". 2001. * Hutcherson, Ken, \\"Enough Faith: You've Already Got What It Takes to Make a Difference\\". 2006. * Hutcherson, Ken, \\"Hope Is Contagious: Trusting God in the Face of Any Obstacle\\". 2010.

Vamman was born in Aberdeen, Washington, on 17 October 1919. He attended Pomona Junior College in California before enlisting in the Naval Reserve on 17 February 1941 at Long Beach, Calif. After his initial duty at the Naval Reserve Aviation Base Long Beach, Seaman 2d Class Vammen was transferred to naval air station at Pensacola, Fla., on 27 March. On 3 April, he was discharged at his own request to accept an appointment as an aviation cadet. Vammen reported to NAS Pensacola, on 4 April for flight training. Detached on 19 August and transferred to NAS Miami, for further training, Vammen was appointed a naval aviator (heavier-than-air) on 23 September. Completing his instruction on 20 October, he accepted the rank of ensign that day. Assigned to Advanced Carrier Training Group, Pacific Fleet, soon thereafter, Vammen continued his training until joining Torpedo Squadron 6 (VT-6), based on the aircraft carrier Enterprise (CV-6), on 28 April 1942. He joined the ship within two weeks of the completion of the famous Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, 18 April 1942, and just before his carrier and Hornet (CV-8) proceeded south toward the Coral Sea to meet an expected Japanese thrust. The two flattops were too late to assist Lexington (CV-2) and (CV-5) in the critical Battle of the Coral Sea which took place from 4 to 8 May. Although she missed the Coral Sea action, Enterprise--\\"The Big E\\"--did participate in the pivotal Battle of Midway one month later. Ensign Vammen, by that point assigned to Scouting Squadron 6 (VS-6), did not take part in the strikes of 4 June against the Japanese carrier fleet. He received his baptism of fire, however, soon enough. On Friday evening, 5 June, Vammen--flying a Douglas SBD-3 Dauntless, with Aviation Machinists' Mate 2d Class M. W. Clark in the rear seat--took off with eight other planes of VS-6, as part of the strike launched to locate and sink what had been erroneously reported as two enemy carriers. Subsequently, the SBDs from Enterprise and Hornet found and attacked what they reported to be a \\"Japanese CL\\" (light cruiser)-- a ship that turned out to be the destroyer Tanikaze. The Dauntlesses that made the dusk attack failed to score any hits with their 500-pound bombs on the twisting, turning destroyer. Vammen, who had never received instruction in night carrier recoveries, made his first night landing--not on Enterprise, but on Hornet. The next morning, on 6 June, Vammen joined Hornet's planes in attacking the fleeing Japanese heavy cruisers Mogami and Mikuma, a strike that inflicted such severe damage on the latter that she sank later that day. Unfortunately, Vammen and his gunner failed to return from that mission. For his part in the Battle of Midway, however, Ensign Vammen--cited for \\"courage and unflinching devotion to duty\\"--was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, posthumously. In 1944, the destroyer escort USS Vammen (DE-644) was named in his honor.

He may himself have been part Khazar. According to Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus' De administrando imperio, the Khazars sought to make Levedi the paramount ruler of all the Hungarian tribes, but he refused, possibly because he was childless or because his close ties to the Khazar government were resented by other Magyar leaders. Instead, Levedi proposed √Ålmos and his son √Årp√°d as leaders of the Magyars. The Magyar settlement between the Volga river and the Urals the mountains were named Lebedia soon to become Levedia after Levedi.http://www.grozerarchery.com/magyar.htm  Name and title  The only source of Levedi's life is the De administrando imperio, a book written by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus around 950. According to historian Omeljan Pritsak, Levedi's name, which was actually a title, derived from the Turkic expression \\"alp edi\\", or \\"brave lord\\". The Hungarian historian Gyula Krist√≥, who refuses Pritsak's theory, says that Levedi's name is connected to the Hungarian verb \\"lesz\\" (\\"be\\"). A similar proper name (Lewedi) was recorded in a Hungarian charter, issued in 1138. When writing about Levedi, Porphyrogenitus emphasized \\"the illustriousness of his race\\".Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio (ch. 38), p. 171. Porphyrogenitus's narration suggests that Levedi was born between around 800 and 815, because he seems to have been older than √Ålmos who was born in the 820s. Levedi bore the title \\"voivode\\", which is of Slavic origin. When using that title, Porphyrogenitus always referred to the heads of the seven Magyar tribes. Historian Dezs≈ë Paizs says that Levedi was the head of the Megyer tribe, but his theory has not been widely accepted.

Born in Ferrol, Galicia, she excelled in literature and was the first woman to attend university in Spain. She was also a pioneer and founder of the feminist movement in Spain. Life Her father, √Ångel del Arenal, was a liberal military officer who was often imprisoned for his ideology and opposition to the regime of Ferdinand VII. He fell ill in prison and died in 1829, when Concepci√≥n was aged 8. She moved to Arma√±o (Cantabria) with her mother, and then to Madrid in 1834, to attend the school of the Count of Tepa. Against her mother's wishes in 1841 she went to Law School at the Central University (now the Complutense University of Madrid), becoming the first woman in Spain to attend University, where she was forced to wear masculine attire. She also attended political and literary debates, unheard of at the time for a woman. She graduated and in 1848 she married lawyer and writer Fernando Garc√≠a Carrasco. They had three children: a daughter that died shortly after birth, and two sons, Fernando (b. 1850) and Ram√≥n (b. 1852). In her later years, her health being a permanent cause of concern, Concepci√≥n Arenal lived with her son Fernando and Fernando's second wife, Ernestina Winter. Concepci√≥n Arenal and her husband collaborated closely on the liberal newspaper Iberia until Fernando's death in 1859. Penniless she was forced to sell all her possessions in Arma√±o and moved into the house of violinist and composer Jes√∫s de Monasterio in Potes, Cantabria, where in 1859 she founded the feminist group Conference of Saint Vincent de Paul in order to help the poor. Two years later the Academy of Moral Sciences and Politics awarded her a prize for her work La beneficencia, la filantrop√≠a y la caridad [Beneficence, philanthropy and charity]. It was the first time the Academy gave the prize to a woman. In later years she published poetry books and essays such as Cartas √° los Delincuentes [Letters to delinquents] (1865), ‚ÄúOde against slavery‚Äù (1866), El reo, el pueblo y el verdugo, o, La ejecuci√≥n p√∫blica de la pena de muerte [Convicts, the people and the executioner, or, The execution of the death sentence] (1867). In 1868 she was named Inspector of Women's Correctional Houses and in 1871 began fourteen years of collaboration with the Madrid-based magazine The Voice of Charity. In 1872 she founded the Construction Beneficiary, a society dedicated to building cheap houses for workers. She also worked with the Red Cross helping the injured of the Carlist War, working in a hospital in Miranda de Ebro, later being named Secretary General of the Red Cross between 1871 and 1872. In 1877 she published Penitentiary Studies. Concepci√≥n Arenal died the morning of 4 February 1893 of chronic bronchitis in Vigo, where she was buried a day later. Her epitaph is her personal motto: \\"To virtue, to life, to science.\\"  Contributions to feminism  Concepci√≥n Arenal is one of the pioneers of feminism in Spain. Her first work about women's rights was La Mujer del Porvenir [The woman of the future] (1869) where she critics the theories defending the inferiority of women based on biological reasons. She defended women's access to any level of education, although not to any job because she considered that women were not skilled to be an authority figure. She neither support women's political involvement because they were at risk of suffering retaliation and neglecting their family. However, later she also wrote: > ‚Äúa serious mistake, and one of the most harmful, to impress upon women that > her sole mission is to be wife and mother; it amounts to tell her that she > can be nothing by herself and to annihilate her moral and intellectual self‚Äù She had a close relationship with krausism intellectuals. She was admirer of Fernando de Castro's work about women's education and also she was a member of Ateneo Art√≠stico y Literairo de Se√±oras directors‚Äô board keeping up to date with the progress made by Asociaci√≥n para la Ense√±anza de la Mujer (Association for Teaching Women). Years later, she collaborated regularly with Bolet√≠n de la Instituci√≥n Libre de Ense√±anza [Journal of the Institution of Free Teaching] submitting articles about criminal and feminist topics. In 1882 Arenal participated-although she was not present- in the Congreso Pedag√≥gico Hispano-Portugu√©s-Americano [Congress of Hispanic-Portugues-American Pedagogy] hold in Madrid and led by Rafael M¬™ de Labra. She presented a paper about ‚ÄúLa educaci√≥n de la mujer‚Äù [Women's education] in the fifth section of the congress dedicated to Concepto y l√≠mites de la educaci√≥n de la mujer, y de la aptitud profesional de √©sta [The concept and limits of women's education and her professional aptitude]. The section dealt with the debate of the similarities and difference between women and men's education, what tools were necessary to organize a good education system for women, what aptitudes women had for teaching and other jobs and women's physical education. The vice- president of this round table was Emilia Pardo Baz√°n. Arenal's position was supporting women's education without limitation. Legacy Arenal's achievements were extraordinary in a largely traditional Spain, focusing her work on those marginalised in society. She wrote not only extensively on the state of prisons for both men and women, but also on the role of women in society in works such as La Mujer del Porvenir [The Woman of the Future] (1869), The education of women, The current state of women in Spain, The work of women, La mujer de su casa [The woman of the house] (1883) and Domestic service. It is this work which made her known as the founder of the feminist movement in Spain. A monument to Concepci√≥n Arenal was erected in 1934 in Madrid, and the Library of Law, Political Sciences and Labour Relations of the University of Santiago de Compostela bears her name. Ideologically, Arenal was a reformist deeply rooted in Christian doctrine.

It was designed by and Philippe de La Gu√™pi√®re, and constructed from 1764 to 1769. It is located on an elongated ridge between the towns of Leonberg, Gerlingen and Stuttgart in Baden- W√ºrttemberg. History Charles Eugene von W√ºrttemberg succeeded his father Charles Alexander as Duke of W√ºrttemberg in 1737, when was only nine. The Duchy of W√ºrttemberg was ruled by a regency council until 1744, when Charles Eugene reached the age of majority at 16. His reign would be marked by economic difficulty, political strife, and extravagance. By the 1760s, Charles Eugene's policies and ambitions had met with failure. He had failed to achieve increased rank and prestige from the War of the Austrian Succession or the Seven Years' War, and had diplomatically isolated W√ºrttemberg because of his jostling and means of acquiring war funds. He had repeatedly withdrawn funding from the construction of his palaces, one of which was Monrepos, in Ludwigsburg. Charles Eugene turned his attention back to Stuttgart and, in 1763, he hired of architects led by Philippe de La Gu√™pi√®re to plan a new palace that received the name \\"Solitude\\". Friedrich Christoph Hemmerling was named head gardener and charged with its design and creation. =Construction= Priority during construction went towards the two wings next to the palatial building until they were completed in 1766. It was from these that the Duke closely monitored construction. La Gu√™pi√®re departed from W√ºrttemberg for his native Paris in 1768. He was succeeded as court architect and as director of construction at Solitude by his student, Reinhard Heinrich Ferdinand Fischer. In 1770, Charles Eugene established the Hohe Karlsschule on the grounds of Solitude Palace. It was at this school that Friedrich Schiller studied in his youth and wrote The Robbers. The school moved into Stuttgart in 1775, the same year the Duke himself shifted his attention to nearby Hohenheim Palace in 1775. The last grand function held at Solitude took place in 1782, after which maintenance of the grounds ceased. From the 1830s, however, King Charles I renovated the palace, while Queen Olga met with her relatives in the palace. =Post-monarchy= Resting at the Steps, by Hugo Charlemont Solitude was abandoned in the 20th century, the gardens fell into disrepair, and the ceiling frescoes by Nicolas Guibal were largely destroyed by water damage. The palace was used in times of war as a military hospital; during World War I, 23 soldiers died on its grounds. Between 1972 and 1983, the government of Baden- W√ºrttemberg restored the palace's interiors. From May 1968 to 1986, an autonomous dorm was located in today's academy building. Many of the residents were musicians, actors and dancers, as well as social workers, architects and engineers. Professor K.R.H. Sonderborg from the Stuttgart Art Academy, the conductor Manfred Schreier and the actress Bettina Kupfer were frequent guests. Grounds and architecture The palace seen from the northwest, on the Solitude Palace's complex is made up by a primary palatial structure, two outbuildings, and some avenues. There was also an extensive garden, laid out by Friedrich Christoph Hemmerling along preexisting paths. Reinhard Heinrich Ferdinand Fischer drew up plans for massive expansions to the garden and palace complex from 1766 to 1772 that closely followed the principles of French horticulturalist Antoine-Joseph Dezallier d'Argenville. The south garden was used for the entertainment of residents and visitors to Solitude and offered a hedge maze, theater, orangery, riding hall, a chinoiserie house, and zoos. The surrounding forests were carefully manicured to facilitate the style of coursing. The grounds were allowed to fall into disrepair from 1770 onward. Castle Solitude was designed by a working group at the ducal court led Philippe de La Gu√™pi√®re, though Charles Eugene was actively involved in the planning. The Duke desired the palace to be designed in the Rococo style, like his earlier project at Schloss Favorite. By 1763, however, the Rococo style had gone out of vogue in favor of Neoclassical architecture, and Solitude's interiors reflect this. At first, Charles Eugene intended to build an unassuming hunting retreat. He later changed his mind, and construction would last seven years and cost around a million florins. Construction was directed by La Gu√™pi√®re and . From 1764 and 1768, Charles Eugene constructed the , a long road from Solitude Palace to Ludwigsburg and its palace. Use of the Avenue was reserved for the royal household. In 1820, the Avenue became the standard reference for measuring distance in the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. =Main building= Palatial building, looking south The main palatial building follows a standard Rococo plan, consisting of a large, oval-shaped hall with two halls that end in a pavilion. It is surrounded by a terrace supported on a series of arches that rises to the beletage, with a belvedere and staircases on either side. The center of the building is the White Hall, whose walls are clad in stucco marble and passed through via six French doors, flanked by Corinthian columns. The stucco work, by , Johann Adam Bauer, and Ludovico Bossi, is made up by oval-shaped windows connected by flowery garlands and topped by trophies of arms and frescoes. Above the north and south entrances into the White Hall are, respectively, the coat of arms of the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg and those of Duke Charles Eugene. The ceiling fresco was painted around 1768 by Nicolas Guibal and glorifies Charles Eugene's reign with personified virtues, flanking the Ducal coronet, triumphing over their inverse aspect as Greco-Roman deities represent highlights of the Duke's reign. Peace overcomes War, Bacchus and Ceres hold grapevines to symbolize local viticulture, and Apollo, leading various forms of art personified, celebrates W√ºrttemberg's cultural achievements. On top of the cupola is a viewing platform accessed by a hidden staircase in the north end of the White Hall. Some stone cartouches bearing statements from Charles Eugene are also found on the lower facade of the main building. Immediately to the west of the White Hall is the six rooms of the Ducal Apartment, which was used for impressing visitors. The first is an antechamber decorated with green and gold-painted stuccowork. Following this is the Marble Hall, the only room of the suite in the Neoclassical style and where Charles Eugene greeted guests, which leads into the Palm Room, so named for the golden stucco palm trees that frame its windows. The Palm Room serves as the entrance to the bedroom, to the south and decorated like the antechamber, and to two cabinets to the north. The first of the latter is the Writing Cabinet, painted in shades of gray and ornamented with more golden stucco. The second, and smaller, is the Library Cabinet, whose walls are painted in a mimicry of woodgrain. The east wing consists of drawing rooms for visitors, namely two halls and four cabinets. The first room is the Assembly Room, painted blue and decorated with more golden stucco, and spanning the entire width of the building. Beyond is the Music Room, painted white and decorated with mirrors, yet more stucco, and overdoors painted by court painter Adolf Friedrich Harper. Attached to the Music Room are four themed cabinets: the Picture, Red, Green, and Yellow Cabinets. The Picture Cabinet displays over 30 landscape paintings on its wall panels. The \\"basement\\" of the main building is divided exactly in half by and entered through an oval chamber directly beneath the White Hall. The walls of this chamber are covered with more trophies of arms. After 1771, the apartments were made up by a loggia, a vestibule, two cabinets, and a bedroom. =Wings= Adjacent to the palatial building are two semicircular buildings. The Western Wing contained amenities, while the Eastern was the actual royal apartment. The Duke resided on the ground floor, and his mistress on the second floor with the ducal chapel. An additional ten houses were built on either end of the wings. Since 1990, these buildings have housed the Akademie Schloss Solitude. The , displaying works by the Stuttgart sculptor , is also located here. The palace chapel was constructed in a combination of the Rococo and Neoclassical styles. It is painted white in its entirety, except for the fresco on the flat ceiling painted by Guibal in 1766, and paired columns flank each window. Just above the columns, on the cornices are putti wielding the Arma Christi. At the chapel's entrance is the Ducal box, part of Charles Eugene's suite.

Plot synopsis (issues #1-12) =Issues #1-3: Introduction= In the present the reader is introduced to Alice Cohen as she receives her inheritance from her recently deceased grandmother. This inheritance consists of a lone house in an area of Brooklyn where all the other buildings have been torn down. One of the first things that Alice discovers is a walled off section in the basement from which a voice calls to her to read stories. Alice's first choice for this is her grandmother's diary. Alice owes money to Prince, a violent drug dealer who is determined to find and make an example out of her. Using violent methods Prince finds out Alice's location from Tilt (a friend of Alice's) who races to warn Alice that Prince is coming for her. Not long after Tilt's warning Prince arrives and breaks into the house. In desperation Alice and Tilt break down the brick wall in the basement and release The Monolith. The resulting fight is short. The depression era portions of these issues show how and why The Monolith was created. Alice's grandmother (also named Alice) is a factory worker who rooms with others trying to get through those tough times. Her closest friends are Rabbi Rava, Han, and Peter. The events leading to The Monolith's creation begin when the textile factory that Alice works in is firebombed by the Mafia. Peter, who also works on the side in organized crime, confronts those responsible and is murdered. Deciding that Peter's death should not be in vain Alice and her friends create a golem using knowledge Rabbi Rava has learned. Peter's blood is one of the ingredients used in its creation and as a result his personality is the basis for The Monolith's. They send their creation to hunt down those responsible for Peter's murder. After a time The Monolith begins to hunt down and kill all criminals with no distinction made for the degree of their crime. Seeing their creation is out of control Alice, Rabbi Rava, and Han seal The Monolith in a bootlegger tunnel located beneath the house they live in. =Issues #4-5: Battle with a demon= In the present the lawyer overseeing Alice's grandmother's will gets her a job working for NYCAT (the New York Citizen's Assistance Team). NYCAT is a non- profit organization that helps lower income people in the New York area. While Alice is dealing with her first day at this job, The Monolith leaves the house to seek out a demon that lies hidden beneath a church. This demon is named L'ono Nero and has remained in its place of hiding for decades. The Zavatinni family has been cursed all that time to guard and protect it. Giovanni Zavatinni (the current guardian) is seeking to rid himself of this curse and aides The Monolith in the fight against L'ono Nero. In 1935 the Rocco Family is seeking revenge for the deaths of their fellow mobsters at the hands of The Monolith. Having learned the truth of its creation they seek out The Monolith's creators. Rabbi Rava is kidnapped, beaten and dropped off at the church that hides L'ono Nero. The mobsters tell the current guardian to give the Rabbi to L'ono Nero. The guardian doesn't do this but the Rabbi dies of his injuries anyway. Their brief conversation reveals that the Rocco Family has already killed Han. Alice is also taken to the church but is set free by the guardian =Issues #6-8: Batman= An arsonist calling himself the Incinerator begins to target the Arab-American and Muslim American community of New York City. His first target is a home for recent Arab Muslim immigrants in Bedford-Stuyvesant that was built through the efforts of NYCAT and the Wayne Foundation. This event gets the attention of Batman and he begins to investigate. Both Batman and The Monolith track the Incinerator to his next target. In the resulting fight Batman is injured and The Monolith brings him back to the house. There Alice tells Batman the Monolith's origin. Batman's reaction is to tell Alice and The Monolith not to get in his way. After a time Batman comes to the realization that he needs The Monolith to find The Incinerator. The two of them locate The Incinerator's next bomb in the New York Mosque where he has tied an Imam to the bomb to make it harder to disarm. After dealing with the bomb both The Monolith and Batman track The Incinerator to The World Trade Center site. The Incinerator is planning to blow himself up but is stopped and arrested for his crimes. =Issues #9-10: Iron golem= In 1934 mobsters kidnap Alice and Rabbi Rava. The Rabbi is forced to create a golem made of iron for these mobsters after they threaten to kill Alice if he doesn't. Rabbi Rava performs the ceremony but purposely misspeaks the words. The golem awakens anyway, but is nearly mindless and kills the mobsters. It is at this point that The Monolith arrives to rescue his creators. During the fight the iron golem is covered in molten steel and frozen when the steel hardens. It is then thrown into the East River by The Monolith. In 1987 the iron golem is found by scuba diving salvagers and sold. In the present Tilt has just been diagnosed as being HIV positive. Alice takes her to a dance club to take her mind off of this. In the middle of this club is a statue that is actually the iron golem still encased in its steel prison. When a gang fight starts in the club, blood is spilled on the iron golem, causing it to awaken. During its resulting rampage The Monolith arrives to protect Alice and Tilt. =Issues #11-12: The end= Alice gets a call from a woman NYCAT helped into a woman's shelter saying that the shelter isn't a shelter. This call leads Alice to a modern slave ring headed by a group of corrupt police officers. The leader of this group turns out to be Orlando Ruiz (a man Alice has just started to date) who captures Alice. Ruiz injects Alice with heroin to keep her compliant and puts her on the slave block. Knowing that Alice is in trouble Tilt and the Monolith track her to the warehouse where she and the other women are being held. They rescue Alice and bring her back to the house to recover. The final pages of issue twelve show Alice, Tilt and the Monolith celebrating Christmas. They engage in a snowball fight and then go back inside the house. The series ends with The Monolith remembering who he was in life and saying \\"My name was Peter.\\" Other appearances While The Monolith was still being published, Gray and Palmiotti were also writing Hawkman. In issue #33 of that series, the Monolith and Alice guest starred in a story featuring the Monolith joining with Hawkman and Hawkgirl to defeat Solomon Grundy.

The novel takes the form of a fictitious memoir.  Plot summary  The Algerine Captive tells the story of the upbringing, early career, and later enslavement of fictional Boston native, narrator Updike Underhill. The first volume chronicles Updike Underhill's youth and early adulthood in America; the Preface suggests that its aim is to \\"at least display a portrait of New England manners, hitherto unattempted.\\" Tyler, Royall. The Algerine Captive Or, The Life and Adventures of Doctor Updike Underhill. New York: The Modern Library: 2002. p. 6. After detailing his family history, Underhill describes his birth, childhood, and early education. Upon the encouragement of a local minister, Underhill's parents agree to prepare the narrator for college by placing him under the minister's tutelage. Underhill's classical education, through which he learns Greek and Latin, provides him with the ability to recite copious lines of poetry, which his countrymen ridicule.Crain, Caleb (2002). \\"Introduction\\". In Royall Tyler, The Algerine Captive or, The Life and Adventures of Doctor Updike Underhill, pp. xxvii. New York: Modern Library. Not only is he mocked for his spouting of Greek poetry, which is unintelligible to all but himself, but he is actually challenged to a duel after writing an unintentionally insulting Greek-inspired ode to a young lady. Luckily for Underhill, the duel is discovered and preempted by the local sheriffs and constables before it can take place. This volume also gives an account of Underhill's failed attempt to serve as a teacher in a village school, follows his travels through the Northern and Southern states as a physician, and discusses his service as a surgeon aboard a slave ship that heads to Africa by way of London. In the final chapter of this volume, while Updike is on the African coast nursing five sick slaves back to health, he is captured and taken as a slave to Algiers. In the second volume, Updike describes his enslavement and gives an account of the country in which and the people among whom he is confined. By setting Algiers in opposition to America, this part of the novel leads Underhill to comment on and formulate his conception of what it means to be American. When he is freed at the novel's conclusion, therefore, the message he imparts to the reader is a nation- building one: \\"My ardent wish is, that my fellow citizens may profit by my misfortunes. If they peruse these pages with attention they will perceive the necessity of uniting our federal strength to enforce a due respect among other nations...BY UNITING WE STAND, BY DIVIDING WE FALL.\\" Tyler, Royall. The Algerine Captive Or, The Life and Adventures of Doctor Updike Underhill. New York: The Modern Library: 2002. p. 226.  Form of novel  Numerous formal elements distinguish The Algerine Captive. The novel's division into two volumes allows for a natural break in the narrative between life in America and in North Africa. It is thought the two volumes also differ greatly in tone: Volume 1 follows the format of \\"a satire and a picaresque,\\" whereas Volume 2 is dominated by \\"earnestness\\" and abolitionist sentiment. In addition, each brief chapter within the two volumes begins with an epigraph and an \\"Argument,\\" which details the proceedings of the chapter in a summary, which sometimes misleads the reader by inaccurately representing the chapter's contents. Reception The Algerine Captive was popular enough that it was reprinted in England, becoming only the second American novel to achieve that distinction.

The palace is located in the center of Stuttgart on the Schlossplatz in front of the Jubil√§umss√§ule column and K√∂nigsbau. Public tours of the building are only permitted by special arrangement, as the building contains some government offices. Once a historic residence of the Kings of W√ºrttemberg, the New Palace derives its name from its commissioning by Duke Carl Eugen of W√ºrttemberg to replace the Old Castle in the early years of his reign. Originally, Charles commissioned Nikolaus Friedrich Thouret, but architects Leopold Retti, Philippe da la Guepi√®re, Reinhard Heinrich Ferdinand Fischer would contribute to the design, history, and construction of the palace. History =Background= In 1737, then Duke of W√ºrttemberg Charles Alexander died leaving his nine year old Charles Eugene as Duke prematurely. He was not yet old enough to rule the Duchy, so he was sent to be educated and study in the court of then King of Prussia Frederick the Great while the court of W√ºrttemberg was run by magistrates. In 1744, Charles Eugene came of age at 16 years of age, and returned to Stuttgart to assume his throne. Upon arriving, he desired a new residence proper residence which is convenable to his royal dignity and the amplitude of his royal household\\" in the city of Stuttgart and even threatened to move the capital back out of Stuttgart to Ludwigsburg Palace. The W√ºrttemberg Diet, who had lost the traditional role of capital of the Duchy for decades to the smaller and unfortified Ludwigsburg, insisted that the palace and seat of the power be moved back into Stuttgart because it would mean increased pride and political and economic power coming to rest in the city once again. So it was that Charles Eugene decided to build his palace upon the Schlossplatz. However, there was some debate over the palace as the Duchy already had the large and expensive residence at Ludwigsburg, and some, like W√ºrttemberg's Oberbaudirektor Johann Christoph David Leger, argued that expansion of a previous residence like the Old Castle would suffice. Plans nonetheless went forward, and architects across Europe jumped at the chance to design the Duke's palace and submitted drafts directly to Charles, including renowned architects Alessandro Galli da Bibiena and Maurizio Pedetti as well as Balthasar Neumann, designer of the world-famous W√ºrzburg Residence. =Construction= On 3 September 1746 the cornerstone was laid under the New Palace's first build master, Leopoldo Matteo Retti whose uncle, Donato Giuseppe Frisoni, had worked on Ludwigsburg Palace. Retti, who picked the site of an old crossbow shop for the New Palace, planned for the courtyard to face the nearby Karlsschule Stuttgart and New Lusthaus south of the palace, the Garden Wing to face the Ducal Apartments in the Corps de logis, and for the City Wing to contain the guest and state rooms. However, when construction began, it began under the direction of Johann Christoph David Leger as Retti was working on a commission in Ansbach until 1748. The following year, the facades of the Corps de logis and Garden Wing were completed, while work on the interiors would last until 1750. Unfortunately, Retti, whose work had been inspired by the Baroque architecture of France, died of an unknown illness 18 September 1751. After Retti's death, construction of the palace fell to Parisian architect Philippe de La Gu√™pi√®re, a friend of Retti. A connoisseur of then modern architectural theory, Philippe was inspired by his time in his native France and especially the magnificent Palace of Versailles, and took the palace in this direction. Under La Gu√™pi√®re, the City Wing facade was finished in 1756 as well as a dome over the central structure in 1760 with decorations to the Corp de logis following in 1762. Unfortunately, a fire destroyed the interior of the Garden Wing, which La Gu√™pi√®re had just finished, on the night of 13‚Äì14 November of that same year. Following the fire, an annoyed Charles Eugene decreed the speedy conclusion of construction of the White Room and Mirror Gallery for the celebration of his birthday (11 February) the following year. In 1764, construction ceased because the Duke moved his residence to Ludwigsburg and remained there for a decade. In response, La Gu√™pi√®re left the Duke's court in 1768 and returned to Paris. In 1775, the Duke returned to Stuttgart and hired Reinhard Heinrich Ferdinand Fischer to repair the Palace. He would do so until his death in 1793 and his era would see the central pavilion of the Marble Hall in the Corps de Logis was decorated with a fresco by Nicolas Guibal. Czar Paul I of Russia and his wife Sophie Dorothea of W√ºrttemberg, one of Charles Eugene's nieces, visited the castle in 1775. When Charles Eugene died in 1793, New Palace was given more much needed repairs. 1789 saw the completion of the City Wing and the Garden Wing in 1791 during the rule of Frederick II Eugene, Duke of W√ºrttemberg (construction elsewhere could continue into the 19th Century). In 1806, as the palace was finally nearing completion, Napoleon Bonaparte visited the New Palace. Eleven years later, von Thouret redecorated some of the rooms of the Red Marble Hall during the visit of Czar Alexander I. When Duke and then King Frederick I died, William I moved the seat of his power back to the New Palace and hired Giovanni Salucci and later his pupil Ferdinand Gabriel and charged them with renovating the palace's Grey and Yellow Marble Halls in 1836. In 1840 and 1841 and from 1852 to 1854, the court painter Josef Anton Gegenbauer painted three frescoes in the rooms created next to the staircase on the ground floor with scenes from the history of the Duchy and the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. Under Duke Charles I and his wife Olga only minor changes were made to the castle, mainly made in the royal living area and by Joseph von Egle were executed. William II renounced the residency of the Dukes in the New Palace, and the palace was somewhat opened to the public for the first time. =Use after 1918= After Wilhelm II of W√ºrttemberg abdicated his throne on November 30, 1918, the palace passed into state ownership. In 1919, the German Foreign Institute used the ground floor and some of the garden wing to house their offices and showrooms and some of the first and second floors became the headquarters for the local police. In the early 1920s, nearly the entire first floor became a museum displaying the royal Kunstkammer, majolica collection, and former living places of the kings of W√ºrttemberg. On 15 April 1920, Richard von Weizs√§cker, future President of Germany, was born in the attic of the palace. When the German Foreign Institute moved out in 1928, the remaining unused portions of the palace were converted into German military and ancient antiquity museums. When the police headquarters moved out in 1926, the second floor housed the offices of the antiquities collection and historic preservation authorities. In the World War II air raids on February 21, 1944, Neue Schloss was almost completely burned to the ground by Allied bombs, leaving only the facade standing. For many years, preservationists fought to rebuild Neue Schloss (once, it was nearly demolished in favor of a hotel) until 1957 when finally it was agreed in the Baden-W√ºrttemberg Landtag that the castle would be rebuilt - by one vote. Since the reconstruction that began in 1958 under the careful direction of Horst Linde, the castle has been used by the State's government, starting with the Corps de logis (Now used for representation by the State Ministry) and the two wings of the castle. The only part of the castle that was not fully restored was an air raid shelter under the building that was demolished in 1958. Today it is used by the State Ministries of Finance and Education and is now open to the public via regular guided tours.

Originally an all-girl institution, Walton became co-educational in 1977. Walton, Bayside High School, Samuel J. Tilden High School, Abraham Lincoln High School, John Adams High School, Andrew Jackson High School, and Grover Cleveland High School were all built during the Great Depression from one set of blueprints, to save money. Walton's colors were sky blue and white. Its motto, Semper fidelis, means 'always faithful'. The school seal was an open book supported by the torch of learning, and the school crest contains the head of Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom. The wildcat was the mascot used by the Walton's sports teams. Today the sports teams are composed of the students of each of the small mini-schools within the Walton Educational Campus. The building is in the same neighborhood as the Bronx High School of Science and DeWitt Clinton High School. From the mid-1980s to its closing in 2008 it was one of the lower-performing high schools in the city. Walton was operated by the New York City Department of Education. The building now houses a host of mini-schools for academic support. History Walton High School is named after Mary Walton, a wife of General Lewis Morris, a member of the Continental Congress and a signer of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, as well as one of the first members of New York State's Board of Regents. Mary Walton was the mother of ten children, four of whom fought in the American Revolutionary War. The Walton and the Morris families owned land in the west Bronx from the 17th until the 19th century. Mary Walton operated a \\"dame school\\", teaching little girls of the colonial period to read, write, do basic mathematics, and keep house. Mary Walton was buried next to Saint Ann's Church in the South Bronx. Mary A. Conlon, an elementary school principal of P.S. 30 (located next to Mary Walton's burial place), founded Walton as one of the first all-girl schools in New York City. The New York City Board of Education accredited Walton as an all-girl high school on April 19, 1923. The first graduation took place in January 1926 with 126 girls. In 1930, the current building on Jerome Avenue and West 195th Street was constructed as Walton's new home, using the same structural design as Abraham Lincoln High School and Samuel J. Tilden High School, both in Brooklyn. The school moved to its new home in 1932. Conlon continued as principal until her death in 1936, when Marion Cahil Heffernan (an assistant principal of economics at Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn) took over. By 1933, the student population had peaked at approximately 6,000. It was noted as the second-largest high school in the world behind its brother school, DeWitt Clinton. It was also noted that it was the largest high school in the world for girls. Walton was a prestigious all- girl institution throughout much of its history, with a high graduation rate. Its students were often inducted into the Arista honor society. Many of Walton's graduates went on to Ivy League colleges and universities. For many years the school's yearbook was named the Periwinkle, a small blue flower. With the change in demographics of the surrounding neighborhoods came the change in the overall level of excellence for which Walton had been known. The demise and eventual closing of this school saddened those who remembered Walton as it was. In 1966, Mrs. Heffernan retired after serving thirty years as principal. The school appointed its first male principal, Daniel Feins, the former assistant principal of social studies at Christopher Columbus High School. Walton continued as an all-girl school until 1976, when the administration elected to become a co-educational high school. On September 9, 1977, boys were officially admitted to the school; however, it wouldn't be fully co-educational until 1979, when the final all-girl class graduated. In 1980, Marjorie Kipp was appointed as the new principal, and three years later, the school's pool was closed due to a deterioration from the skylight. In 1984, Phyllis Opochinsky founded the \\"Pre-Teaching Academy\\" (students work with other peers with classwork and homework, assist teachers in classrooms, write term papers on their experience in pre-teaching,Sharing Success Pre- teaching and earn college credit through Lehman College). In 1986, Angel D. Orengo became the first male to have the school's valedictorian honor. In 1990, Kipp retired and a new principal, Mrs. Nicola Genco (an assistant principal of guidance at Alfred E. Smith High School) was appointed. During her tenure she addressed security issues, employed more than twenty school safety officers and helped gain funds for the school to be renovated. In 1994 the school's $54 million modernization was officially launched and completed in 1998. Genco also oversaw faculty turnover by terminating some teachers and hiring others she deemed more qualified. Programs such as the Pre-Teaching Academy and Humanities aided Walton's good reputation. Principal Genco and her administration implemented the Walton Plan to target lateness and loitering around campus, and to encourage the faculty to show interest in every student's progress. In 1997, Walton was named a New American High School for serving as a model for schools nationwide that have achieved high levels of success. The next year, the School Construction Authority had declared the completion of Walton's renovation. Principal Genco was concerned that not all of the building's modernization were complete. She and the SCA held a meeting and the agency threatened to close the school down. Genco consulted the news media, such as WABC-TV, WNBC-TV, the New York Daily News, etc. She addressed issues like the peeling paint around the building, lack of heat, poor architecture, and the mismanagement of the pool. In 1999, the SCA agreed with Genco, shortly before her retirement, to repair the school's roof. In 2002, another principal persuaded the agency to modernize the exterior of the building which was completed in 2005. However, the swimming pool, with mini- columns and beautifully tiled, was never repaired despite the SCA contract. On April 19, 1998, Walton celebrated its 75th anniversary by throwing a birthday party inside the lunchroom and holding a luncheon at Maestro's Restaurant for all the graduating classes throughout the school's history. The Periwinkle (yearbook) also acknowledged the anniversary. In 1999, Valerie Vallade, an alumna of Walton, was appointed as the sixth principal and increased the graduation rate. She retired in 2002, when Patricia Friedman (former Assistant Principal of English) was appointed as Interim Acting Principal. However, truancy and unlawful activity increased. Allegedly, some faculty members berated Friedman for this and called for her resignation. A new principal, John Tornifolio, took over in 2004. In that year, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the Department of Education labeled Walton as an \\"Impact School.\\" More than twenty School Safety Officers were assigned and surveillance cameras were installed around campus. Walton High School faced a phase-out in 2005 because of overcrowding and criminal activity. Numerous advocates, such as the Walton High School Alumni Association, failed to persuade the New York City Department of Education to keep the school running. The school graduated its final class in June 2008. =Organizational houses= For many years, Walton was divided into eight theme houses: *Apollo House *Hercules House *Jupiter House *Mercury House *Orion House (Special Education) *Pre-Teaching House *Ulysses House *Welcome House (for incoming freshmen) Demographics When Walton opened in 1923, the school was entirely White. When Mary A. Conlon died in 1936, the school was 80% White and 20% African-American. The June Class of 1938 yearbook, however, shows no black women in any of the group photos and only three among the photos of the graduating class. In the mid-1960s, Hispanic students started to enroll in sizable numbers, and by the end of the 1960s, Walton's ethnic makeup was 40% White, 40% African-American, and 20% Hispanic. .

Borrowing heavily from Depeche Mode, they are one of few recent bands dedicated to making traditional synthpop music. Along with such bands as Page, S.P.O.C.K, Sista Mannen P√• Jorden and Kiethevez they define the sound of the Swedish synthpop movement. Heavily influenced by acts like Yazoo, The Human League, Depeche Mode, Rational Youth and Robert Marlow, Richard Jomshof and Leslie Bayne started the band in 1988 under the name Pole Position. Robert Enforsen joined the band as lead vocalist in 1989, and the band released their first demo, at which point they changed their name to Elegant Machinery, a name derived from the album by DATA, a British synthpop group of the 1980s led by Norwegian Georg Kajanus. Due to Leslie Bayne's stagefright, Johan Malmgren joined the band as a tour musician in 1992. He later became a permanent member. The band was very successful in Sweden, with a number of successful singles and various awards. In the rest of Europe, their biggest break into the mainstream was with the single Process, which reached number 5 in the Spanish charts.  Breakup, reunion and breakup  Elegant Machinery disbanded in 1999. In 2001, the band temporarily reunited (with Johan temporarily replaced by Jarmo Ollila of Daily Planet) for their first-ever American appearance, followed by a performance in Mexico. Over the next few years, the band performed a number of times in Europe. In October 2004, after a successful gig at Romo Night in Gothenburg, the band decided to work on new music. Johan, Richard, and Robert have been joined by original member Leslie Bayne. In November 2007, it was announced that the band had signed with German label Out of Line. A new single \\"Feel the Silence\\" was released in January. The current line-up consists of Robert Enforsen, Richard Jomshof and Leslie Bayne. In early April 2011, there were rumours that the band had split once again. This was later confirmed by the group's management. Jomshof denied the rumours that the split had anything to do with his political career with the Sweden Democrats and cited other personal differences as reasons for the breakup. In 2016, Robert Enforsen and Leslie Bayne reformed Elegant Machinery with new part-time member Jonas Kr√∂jtz. They released a new EP on October 14, 2016 entitled, \\"I\\"  Side projects  During the band's hiatus, Robert Enforsen worked on a number of side projects, including Enforce, Hype, Gobble & Gag, and Red Light District. Meanwhile, Johan Malmgren joined the Swedish band S.P.O.C.K as a keyboardist, programmer and composer. Johan and Robert also produced the debut album \\"Lost in a Maze\\" of the Swedish-British band Univaque in 2004.

Folding is the sharp-edged bending of paper webs or sheets under pressure at a prepared or unprepared bending point along a straight line according to specified dimensions and folding layouts. Paper can be folded with either a buckle or a knife; thus, there are generally three types of folding machines: buckle folders, knife folders or a combination of these two types. Whilst buckle folding is the more popular of the two methods, knife folding is sometimes preferable. Folding machine models vary in sophistication, with high-end machines capable of processing more complex folding jobs and unusual paper forms (in terms of density and size). Organizations required to undertake mass mail-out campaigns often employ folding machines to improve efficiency. However it is very commonly used finishing process across the printing industry. Buckle folders Illustration of buckle folding machine configuration Buckle folders work by feeding the paper at high speeds until it can move no further; the reaction of the paper is to buckle. High friction rollers then grip the paper and push it through a pair of folding rollers. The paper is squeezed between the rollers in the process which results a fold. Attached rubber provides the rollers with the required grip. The front edge of the paper is then finally placed into a \\"pocket\\"‚Äîa result of the rollers pressing together with the aid of a spring. Knife folders Knife folding process principle A knife folder works by striking the paper with a knife between two rollers. This knife is not sharp enough to cut through the paper and simply strikes and creases the paper along the line where the fold is required. Ideally, knife folding is used with thick paper, for \\"cross folds\\" (commonly employed for maps and also known as a \\"French fold\\") or if the paper has been stitched during the folding process; stitched sheets can ruin high friction rollers. Paper folders Folding machines exclusively used for folding paper are commonly referred to as paper folders. These machines are typically used for creating letter folds (C Folds) and accordion folds (Z Folds). Other commonly used folds include a half fold, fold-out, double parallel fold, gate (brochure) fold, and right angle fold. The fold type in a buckle folder is set by adjusting folding plates. Most paper folders allow for a wide range of fold types. Right angle folds require the paper to rotate 90 degrees also known as an 8-page or a right angle. More folds can be accomplished by the use of a 16-page and 32-page unit. Entry- level paper folders require that the folding plates be adjusted manually, with fold settings specified on the folding plates. Higher-end paper folders will electronically adjust the folding plates for added precision and convenience. Both usually have fine tuning knobs for precise adjustments. Most paper folders push paper into the machine by use of a friction wheel; this grabs paper using friction. Friction-feed paper folders do not work well with glossy paper as the friction wheel slips on the paper's surface. Pneumatic paper folders are preferable for folding glossy paper. =Pneumatic folding machines= Pneumatic paper folders push paper into the machine using a vacuum. These folders are often referred to as air-powered paper folders. This method makes it possible to fold most types of paper. Most pneumatic paper folders include a built-in compressor. These folders can have as many as sixteen folding plates or several knife folds depending on the imposition, these are adjusted manually or electronically, depending on the machine. =Feeding systems= There are 2 types of feeding systems used by folders, pile and continuous. The first is flat pile, in which the paper is placed on a feeding table and each sheet is then transported into the machine by friction or an air-controlled suction-wheel. A variation of this is palletized feeding, in which an entire pallet full of paper may be placed on the feeding table. The second type is called \\"continuous\\"; this involves the sheets being placed onto a belt, on a table or rollers, that takes it around the end of the machine, then each sheet is individually pushed into the machine by an air- controlled suction-wheel. The sheets of paper will be separated by blowing air between them. Folder inserters Folder inserters are designed for mailing bills, checks and other material. Folder inserters take paper, fold it, insert it into an envelope and seal the envelope. Folder inserters are available in several designs, many equipped with multiple feed trays for several sheets of paper. Many have the ability to include inserts and return envelopes. These are mixtures of knife and buckle folders. Folder sealers Paper folder sealers are used to fold special pressure-sensitive paper. As the paper is folded, pressure rollers roll along the edge of the paper, bursting open tiny glue pockets that seal the letter shut. Pressure sealed documents are typically opened by tearing off a perforated side or tearing open the sealed portion of the letter. Documents that have been folded and sealed do not require an envelope for mailing and are often used for mailing bills, invoices and other mailed documents.

Early life Claude Hulbert was born in Fulham in West London on Christmas Day 1900. He was the younger brother of Jack Hulbert. Like his brother he received his formal education at Westminster School and Caius College, University of Cambridge, where he was a member of the Footlights Comedy Club as an undergraduate.Obituary for Claude Hulbert, 'The Times', 24 January 1964. Career He began his professional career on the English stage. His first theatrical credit was in the revue His Little Trip in the Strand Theatre in 1920.Obituary for Claude Hulbert, 'The Times' 24 January 1964. The next year he appeared in the London revue Fantasia. In 1924, he was quite successful in the George Grossmith-Guy Bolton musical comedy Primrose, which led to a string of musical comedy roles for him from 1925 to the 1930s, including Sunny, Oh Kay, Song of the Sea and Follow a Star. Hulbert also was a hit on radio, thanks to his spontaneous manner of delivery, along with his nervous excitability and a stutter. In 1939, he returned to the London stage in the farce, Worth a Million. Subsequently, he was seen in Cole Porter's Panama Hattie (1943). In the 1950s, he appeared in numerous farces and in repertory theatre. In 1959, he made quite a splash as Lord Plynne in Frederick Lonsdale's Let Them Eat Cake Although popular, his motion picture career was less successful than his brother's. He began by supporting the Aldwych farceurs before being handed his first lead in a weak B-film with Renee Houston and Binnie Barnes, Their Night Out (1933). His most successful solo film of the mid-1930s was Hello Sweetheart (1935); like most of Hulbert's starring comedies, however, its ambition was strictly small-scale; it seemed that British studios simply didn't see him as a major star. His flagging career was helped with Wolf's Clothing (1936), which starred him as a dithering diplomat, and Honeymoon-Merry-Go-Round (1940), where he played a bumbling bridegroom who unintentionally becomes an ice-hockey star. He became a very capable partner for Will Hay after the comedian decided he wanted to do without his famous \\"stooges\\", Moore Marriott and Graham Moffatt. Hay's two films with Hulbert, The Ghost of St Michael's (1941) and My Learned Friend (1943), were the most successful of his later vehicles. Hulbert's film appearances, though, became scarcer as the 1940s wore on. In 1951 Hulbert starred in audio recording of the play The Ghost Train, which was commercially released by Decca Records (Release Catalogue No.LK4040). In 1952 he starred in the West End in the title role in Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, directed by his brother Jack. Personal life He was married to the actress Enid Trevor.Recording of Hulbert and Trevor performing together in a 1930 audio recording entitled 'Airman', and 'Raspberries'. https://youtube.com/watch?v=fBYwd7zlHUkObituary for Claude Hulbert, 'The Times', 24 January 1964.

History The Toledo Yacht Club is among the oldest yacht clubs in North America. The Toledo Yacht Club was founded in 1865 with the name of Toledo Boat Club when two rowing clubs, the Undines and the Naiads, joined together and turned their attention to sailing. The Toledo Yacht Club was incorporated on October 3, 1885. In 1904, the club readopted the name Toledo Yacht Club. Clubhouse The first club house was erected in 1878 on Gard Island near the mouth of the Ottawa River. In 1890, a more elaborate structure with sleeping rooms and a second floor was built. In 1896, a rival club, the Ohio Yacht Club, unsuccessfully attempted to take over the Toledo Yacht Club's Gard Island lease. Later that year, the two clubs merged under the name Toledo Yachting Association, maintaining city quarters in the Neptune Building in Toledo, Ohio. When Bay View Park was developed, a 25-year lease was granted to the Toledo Yachting Association, and a wood frame club house was erected at the present site of the club in 1903. In 1906, fire completely destroyed the club and all of its historic contents. By 1908, a new steel reinforced concrete Spanish style clubhouse was built on the site. This historic building still remains basically the same, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 1976. 1920 Postcard of Toledo Yacht Club in Toledo, Ohio Organization The Toledo Yacht Club is a member owned corporation. It consists of a membership body, a Board of Trustees and a Bridge of Officers who are elected individually. The Bridge Officers also serve as Trustees on the Board. =Officers= The Toledo Yacht Club is led by its chief executive, the Commodore. Next are the Vice Commodore and Rear Commodore. The club has a Financial Secretary, Treasurer, and Recording Secretary. These officers are collectively known as the Bridge. The previous year's Commodore serves as the Fleet Commander and Trustee, and there are five additional Trustees on the Board. Additional titles of Fleet Surgeon and Historian are assigned by the Commodore, however, they are not members of the Board of Trustees. The title Past Commodore is given to members who have served in the office of Commodore. Past Commodores are eligible for membership in the International Order of the Blue Gavel. A. L. Smith was named the first Commodore in 1865. A full succession list of Toledo Yacht Club Commodores and their respective years of service will be added at a later date. =Membership= Membership in the Toledo Yacht Club is divided into several classes, defined by the club Constitution and By-Laws.

He often inflated the scale of the buildings relative to the figures to make them more impressive.  Biography  He was born in Ferrol, Galicia. In 1812, he was enrolled at the military academy in Santiago de Compostela, where he assisted his father, who was a professor there.Briuef biography and works @ Arte Espa√±a. He went to Madrid in 1820 to study at the \\"Reales Estudios de San Isidro\\" (now part of the Colegio Imperial de Madrid). Three years later, he went to C√°diz to enlist in the army fighting the \\"Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis\\" sent by the Duke of Angoul√™me. He was wounded and briefly held as a prisoner of war.Brief biography @ the Museo del Prado website. Afterwards, he remained there to study at the \\"Escuela de Bellas Artes\\". In 1830, he went to San Juan, Puerto Rico, with his brother Juan (died 1863), who was also a painter, where they decorated the Teatro Tapia and remained there for a few more years, working as scenographers.Biography @ MCN Biograf√≠as. Upon his return to Spain in 1833, he made the acquaintance of the Scottish painter David Roberts, who had a decisive influence on his style. He settled in Madrid in 1834 and became a member of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando the following year. In 1840, he was named honorary court painter to Queen Isabella II. During the regime of Baldomero Espartero, from 1840 to 1844, he left his wife and young child and lived in self-imposed exile in France and Belgium, using artistic affairs as an excuse for his absence. After travelling through Europe, he returned in 1845 and obtained the chair of landscape painting at the Academia, where he later became the director. He returned to Galicia for an extended stay in 1849 and made extensive travels throughout Spain until 1852, when he began to suffer from liver disease. He died in Madrid two years later, aged only forty-seven.

Career Barclay was educated at Harrow School, before going on to read Classics at Trinity College, Cambridge, where his first foray into show business was via the Amateur Dramatic Society.'Cambridge Tripos Examination Results', Times, 25 June 1962, p. 7. He then appeared in Cambridge Footlights revues alongside Tim Brooke-Taylor, Bill Oddie, John Cleese, Graham Chapman, David Hatch, Jonathan Lynn, Jo Kendall and Miriam Margolyes. He was offered a job as a BBC radio producer and soon afterwards put together the team who produced the BBC Home Service comedy show I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again (four series starting 1964). Moving to television, Barclay oversaw Associated-Rediffusion Do Not Adjust Your Set (1967‚Äì69). Following the ITV franchise changes of 1968, Barclay moved to London Weekend Television (LWT) for whom he produced the Doctor... series (1969‚Äì77). One episode in that series involved a hotel proprietor and his wife and was written by John Cleese. Barclay said at the time that he thought there might be a series in the characters, but nothing came of it. Later, Cleese created Fawlty Towers for the BBC. In 1975, he produced the Donald Sinden/Elaine Stritch sit-com Two's Company, which received the \\"Best Situation Comedy\\" BAFTA nomination in 1977. Barclay became Head of Comedy at LWT in 1977 and supervised various successful series including No, Honestly, A Fine Romance (1981‚Äì84). In May 1980 he unveiled Metal Mickey as a show \\"with the appeal of Star Wars, the Daleks and Mork and Mindy\\"The Guardian, Situations vacant; 27 May 1980. Following criticism at the Edinburgh International Television Festival of what was seen as casual racism the LWT series Mind Your Language (1977‚Äì79; 1986), Barclay commissioned No Problem!, transmitted by Channel 4 during 1983‚Äì85, the first original black-made sitcom for British TV (an earlier series featuring a black family, The Fosters (ITV, 1976‚Äì77), had been a remake of a US show). Barclay left LWT in 1983 and formed Humphrey Barclay Productions, which produced the media satire Hot Metal (ITV, 1986‚Äì1988), medical sitcom Surgical Spirit (ITV, 1989‚Äì95), and black sitcom Desmond's (Channel 4, 1989‚Äì94). In 1996, he returned to LWT as Controller of Comedy and, in 1999, became Head of Comedy Development for Granada Media International. Though already in partial retirement, in April 2002, he joined Celador Productions as Development Executive. Inheritance In 2000, Barclay was adopted into the royal family of Tafo, a village which is a three-hour drive north-west of Accra in the Kwahu region of Ghana, while there to attend the funeral of his friend, the actor Christopher (Gyearbuor) Asante. As a chief of the community, he now bears the title of Nana Kwadwo Ameyaw Gyearbuor Yiadom I, Nkosuohene of Kwahu-Tafo.\\"Humphrey Barclay Biography\\", Friends of Tafo. Barclay is active in helping to raise funds for the community, which has had unemployment levels of over 80%. He has teamed up with Ikando Volunteers to help provide skilled volunteers to the community. Barclay is in the line of descent of the Barclays of Mather and Urie, a Scottish lairdship. He is a descendant of David Barclay of Youngsbury (1729‚Äì1809), a Quaker banker who famously manumitted all of the slaves he acquired in English Jamaica as the result of a debt. In 2016, through an introduction via Verene Shepherd, the Jamaican historian of diaspora studies, Humphrey Barclay met with a distinguished African-American descendant of one of the slaves freed by his ancestor.

A file folder in open position. Punched pockets used in some file folders. A file folder (US usage) (or folder in British and Australian usage) is a kind of folder that holds papers and money together for organization and protection. File folders usually consist of a sheet of heavy paper stock or other thin, but stiff, material which is folded in half, and are used to keep paper documents. Files may also contain other things like magazines, cased in music cd's, etc. sometimes mostly not used for any official use, rather used as normal storage in a home. They are often used in conjunction with a filing cabinet for storage. File folders can easily be purchased at office supply stores. File folders are usually labeled based on what is inside them. Folders can be labeled directly on the tab with a pen or pencil. Others write on adhesive labels that are placed on the tabs. There are also electronic label makers that can be used to make the labels. File folders can be made from plastic or paper. When paper is used, it is preferable that it is made from paper pulp with long cellulose fibre, such as kraft paper or manila paper.  Terminology  File or folder are other terms used for file folders, but file folders is a common name for the item in the United States. Manila folders are likely the most common, but file folders come in many different forms. In the United States, letter and legal sizes are common. The exact way to refer to this kind of folder is somewhat unclear. There is no internationally standard term. The term file folder seems to be one that dominates North American language, but does not seem as common in other countries. As stated, some refer to file folders simply as folders, but in North America, this is confusing because folder can refer to several different things. Others use the term manila folders, but this is confusing because not all file folders are made of Manila hemp. This type of folder is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a \\"vanilla folder.\\" Another commonly used folder type is the hanging folder, which has hooks on all four corners that slide over a rail. Normally, hanging folders are used to file one or more manila folders, and it is not a common practice to put loose sheets directly into hanging folders. When some documents need to be retrieved, the corresponding manila folder(s) are removed from the hanging folder. The hanging folder itself is left in its place on the rails. Occasionally, the term for the item changes based on its context. Some may refer to file folders as files when they are being used for storage. For example, one might say, \\"Would you get me the file on the Patterson case?\\" Or someone might say, \\"That information is with the files on the insurance claims.\\" File folder or just folder seems to be how many refer to the item when it is being purchased or not containing any paper yet. For instance, someone might say, \\"Would you give me an empty folder from the box? I need to make a file on the Thompson estate.\\" Or someone might say, \\"When you run to the store would you get me some legal size file folders?\\" Then again, office furniture that holds paper documents is invariable referred to as a Filing cabinet or simply a file cabinet, and never a folder cabinet. The terms are even more distorted in their digital counterparts. In computing, the word \\"folder\\" (or, in some cases, \\"file folder\\") is often used as a synonym for \\"directory\\", while the word \\"file\\" is universally used for actual data items on a disk (sometimes called \\"documents,\\" especially on the Apple Macintosh). In Unix-like systems, this is resolved to some degree by the creed \\"everything is a file\\"; folders are themselves just a special type of file, and many commands (to copy, delete, move, or rename) can be executed without knowing whether the file identifies an entire folder or not.  Tabbed file folders  = Tab style/cut = Leitz File folders can have tabs in them. Tabs are often helpful when many files are being stored together and there needs to be an easy way to differentiate them. The tabs can be on the top of the folders (common in business offices) or on the end/side (common in medical offices). Tab sizes vary and are designated based on the size of each tab in proportion to the total length of the folder. They can be: *Straight cut. There is one long tab. *1/3 cut. There are three tab positions, each is approximately 1/3 of the total length of the folder. Essentially, tabs are cut to be in the left, center, or right positions. *1/5 cut. Similar to the 1/3 cut, except there are five tab positions, each being 1/5 of the total length of the folder. *2/5 cut. There are only two tab positions, the right and the right of center (ROC) positions. ROC is somewhat like a left position, but doesn't extend to the end of the folder because the tabs are only 2/5 of the total length. *1/2 cut. There are two tab positions, left and right. = Tab positions = Because tabs can be cut in different positions, the position of the tab can be referred to as well. For instance, for the 1/3 cut style, folders with tabs in the farthest right position are considered to have a tab in position number three.

Based in Toronto, Innocence Canada identifies, advocates for, and helps exonerate individuals who have been convicted of a serious crime which they did not commit and to preventing future wrongful convictions through education and justice system reform. Founded in 1993 out of the volunteer network that helped exonerate Guy Paul Morin, Innocence Canada has been involved in twenty- one of twenty-six exonerations in Canadian history, including other high- profile cases such as those involving David Milgaard, Steven Truscott, Rom√©o Phillion, and several victims of disgraced pathologist Charles Smith.  History  Innocence Canada was founded in February 1993 as the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted (AIDWYC) by a group of volunteers who organized the Justice for Guy Paul Morin Committee after Morin's 1992 wrongful conviction. Founded the same month that Morin was released on bail pending appeal, the AIDWYC decided to broaden its mandate. Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter, who was wrongly convicted in the United States, served as executive director of AIDWYC for over a decade until resigning in 2005. In 2009, the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted received a one million dollar donation from Ian Cartwright, a retired judge from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. It also set up the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted Foundation, a registered charity, in July 2010. The grant led to AIDWYC establishing a legal education program on wrongful convictions for groups such as police, law school students, and prisoners. By Fall 2016, the funding from the Cartwright grant began to dry up. In September 2016, the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted was denied $250,000 a year funding from the federal government. In the same month, it announced that due to lack of funds, it would have to stop taking on new cases, lay off staff, and move out of its downtown Toronto office. At the time, it had a backlog of 85 cases, 16 of which were deemed likely wrongful convictions by Innocence Canada's staff, including three convicted using expert testimony of disgraced pathologist Charles Smith. In October 2016, the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted rebranded as Innocence Canada, and adopted a new logo consisting of 21 tally marks, one for each of the exonerations they were involved in. In December 2016, Ontario Attorney General Yasir Naqvi announced that the Ontario government would provide $825,000 in funding over three years, while the Law Society of Ontario would add another $75,000 over the same time period. Despite this funding, Innocence Canada still projected a $150,000 per year shortfall which it hoped to make up through charitable donations. Other funding includes a decade of $230,000 annual donations from the Law Foundation of Ontario, which pledged to continue this funding and add funds for future legal education programs by Innocence Canada. = Notable cases = Cases that Innocence Canada has been involved in include those of David Milgaard, Guy Paul Morin, Steven Truscott, seven victims of the disgraced pediatric forensic pathologist Charles Smith, Rom√©o Phillion, and Thomas Sophonow. It also worked on the case of Anthony Hanemaayer, who had been convicted for a crime actually committed by serial rapist and killer Paul Bernardo, whose confession had not been passed on to Hanemaayer. It has been involved in twenty-one of twenty-six exonerations in Canadian history.  Work  Applications to Innocence Canada can be made by the convicted person or another interested party and/or through the recommendation of a lawyer. In addition, Innocence Canada has been invited to provide expertise to several public inquiries related to cases or causes of wrongful convictions in Canada.http://www.justice.gov.nl.ca/just/publications/lamercontents.pdf Finally, Innocence Canada offers accredited Continuing Professional Development (CPD) educational seminars for Canadian lawyers in an effort to prevent future wrongful convictions. Innocence Canada is also working to increase the number of educational opportunities for the public, members of police services and the judiciary on issues related to the prevention of wrongful convictions. Innocence Canada is a member of the Innocence Network, a collective of organizations dedicated to providing pro bono legal and investigative services to individuals who have been wrongly convicted and to preventing wrongful convictions. The Network is composed of innocence organizations across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, The Netherlands, New Zealand and Ireland. Innocence Canada estimates that it receives 3.5 million dollars worth of pro bono legal work from Canadian lawyers each year. It has an annual budget of $500,000 to $600,000, much of which is used to pay for expert witnesses and lab tests. Each case roughly takes eight to nine years to see to completion.

The following month, the band recorded a session for John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show,Rollerskate Skinny at the BBC's Keeping It Peel site and their debut album Shoulder Voices (awarded CMJ Magazine's album of the month), was released in October that year. Another EP, Threshold, was issued in early 1994. The band toured with bands such as Mercury Rev, Smashing Pumpkins, Mazzy Star, Hole and Pavement. They were also invited by Perry Farrell to join the 1994 Lollapalooza tour. The increased media coverage as a result of the tour saw the band sign a major-label deal with WEA. Shields was asked to leave the band and moved to Chicago. The band's first release on WEA was their second album, 1996's Horse Drawn Wishes. This was followed by the \\"Speed to My Side\\" single, but the band split up before any further releases. Legacy All of the members of Rollerskate Skinny have gone on to other musical projects. Ken Griffin moved to New York City and formed the band Kid Silver, releasing the album Dead City Sunbeams in 1999.Robbins, Ira & Reno, Brad \\"Rollerkate Skinny\\", Trouser Press In 2004 Ken, along with former members of Philadelphia band Aspera, formed Favourite Sons who signed to Vice Records. Ken's latest project is the New York-based band August Wells Since the demise of Rollerskate Skinny, Ger and Steve worked on the project Walker. Stevie since started the band Empire, now known as The Radio, which released its debut album in 2005. Jimi Shields went on to form Lotus Crown, and then later Wounded Knees with Suzanne Thorpe, formerly of Mercury Rev. Ger Griffin begun recording again under the name Super Electric, and in a 2011 interview admitted that there is a third, unreleased Rollerskate Skinny album that may yet see the light of day, and stated that although the members have all put their past differences behind them and remain friends, that a reunion isn't on the cards. This 'third album' eventually saw the light of day in 2019 via a post on the Facebook group 'Rollerskate Skinny Are Criminally Underrated', (with the blessing of the band members) . Group member Ken Griffin gave the eight songs their titles and entitled the album 'Throwing Stars'. Rollerskate Skinny remains influential on the Irish music scene. In 2004, Hot Press magazine readers voted Horsedrawn Wishes No. 14 on a list of the 100 greatest Irish albums, and The Irish Times named it No. 7 in a similar list in 2008 (with My Bloody Valentine's Loveless taking the No. 1 spot).

Headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado, the Association currently has over 3,000 members from all over the contiguous United States, Canada, and Australia. In 2004, WPRA members competed for nearly $5 million in total prize money at rodeos in the United States and co- sanctioned Canadian Professional Rodeo Association (CPRA) events in Canada.  History  Formed as the Girls Rodeo Association (GRA) in 1948, several of the original members were female ranchers who had been forced to take over family operations as husbands and fathers were called to service in World War II. Though women had played an important role in rodeo's formative years in the mid-to-late nineteenth century, competing and winning against their male counterparts, by the time of the GRA's formation women's role in rodeo had been reduced to beauty pageants, with prizes (instead of prize money) such as cigarette cases. These women were exceptionally competent riders and ropers, whose skills had been honed working the open ranges of the American west, and they found it demeaning to be pushed to the extreme edges of rodeo. On February 28, 1948, determined to stake their own special place in rodeo, 38 women met in San Angelo, Texas, to form the GRA, with the primary purpose of advancing the position of women in rodeo everywhere. They drafted rules and created a point system for determining year-end champions. Then they went to work, persuading rodeo committees and producers to hold women's contests according to GRA rules. Committees were given the option of choosing which event they would hold, and most picked barrel racing. In its inaugural year, the GRA had 74 members and held 60 events. In its first year, it paid out $29,000 to contestants. In the beginning, the women were performers in the events of calf roping, bronc riding, and barrel riding. The events and membership grew, and in 1981, the name of the Association was officially changed from the GRA to the WPRA. Their next major goal was to promote equality between the women's barrel race and the other events held at PRCA rodeos by demanding prize money equal to the other men's events. They achieved their goals in 1985, becoming the first professional women's sports organizations to have fiscal equality with their male counterparts. The WPRA is now the \\"oldest women's sports association in the country and the only one governed entirely by women\\".  Current events and structure  The WPRA's primary sanctioned event is barrel racing. Contestants on horseback run a cloverleaf pattern around three barrels set in a triangle in the arena. The quickest time determines the winner, with five second penalties assessed for each tipped barrel. The majority of the WPRA's barrel racing events are held in conjunction with Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) events. Contestants are ranked nationally, based on how much money they earned in competition. The top fifteen contestants at the end of the rodeo season are invited to compete at the National Finals Rodeo, held in December each year at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. The WPRA also has an All Women's Division which sanctions rodeos exclusively for women. These All Women's rodeos feature five events - breakaway calf roping, tie-down calf roping, team roping, bareback riding and bull riding - in addition to the barrel race. Contestants count points earned in competition to qualify for the Women's National Finals Rodeo formerly held each October at the Cowtown Coliseum in Fort Worth, Texas. The top fifteen contestants in each event (team roping headers and heelers qualify separately, not as a team) qualify to compete at the Women's Finals and compete for cash and prizes. This event will now also take place in Alvarado, Texas.

The name Friedrich‚ÄìAlexander comes from the university's first founder Friedrich, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, and its benefactor Christian Frederick Charles Alexander, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach. FAU is the second largest state university in the state of Bavaria. It has 5 faculties, 24 departments/schools, 25 clinical departments, 21 autonomous departments, 579 professors, 3,457 members of research staff and roughly 14,300 employees. In winter semester 2018/19 around 38,771 students (including 5,096 foreign students) enrolled in the university in 265 fields of study, with about 2/3 studying at the Erlangen campus and the remaining 1/3 at the Nuremberg campus. These statistics put FAU in the list of top 10 largest universities in Germany. In 2018, 7,390 students graduated from the university and 840 doctorates and 55 post-doctoral theses were registered. Moreover, FAU received 201 million Euro (2018) external funding in the same year, making it one of the strongest third-party funded universities in Germany. FAU is also a member of DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) and the Top Industrial Managers for Europe network. History Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, founder of FAU The university was founded in 1742, in Bayreuth by Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, and moved to Erlangen in 1743. Christian Frederick Charles Alexander, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach (one of the two namesakes of the institution) provided significant support to the early university. From the beginning, the university was a Protestant institution, but over time it slowly secularized. During the Nazi era, the university was one of the first that had a majority of Nazi supporters in the student council. In 1961, the business college in Nuremberg was merged with the university in Erlangen, so now the combined institution has a physical presence in the two cities. An engineering school was inaugurated in 1966. In 1972, the school of education (normal school) in Nuremberg became part of the university. Schloss Erlangen The castle in the center of Erlangen, known to many simply as the Schloss, is home to a large part of the university's administration =Timeline= Below is a short timeline of FAU from its inception to its present form: * 1700‚Äì1704: The Schloss of the Margraves at Erlangen is built. * 1743: Friedrich, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, issues an edict whereby the university recently founded in Bayreuth is transferred to Erlangen. It has the four faculties of Protestant Theology, Jurisprudence, Medicine and Philosophy. * 1769: The University at Erlangen is given the new name of Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t in honour of Alexander, Margrave of Ansbach and Bayreuth. * 1818: The library of the University of Altdorf, dissolved in 1809, is moved to Erlangen. * 1824: The first hospital is built. * 1825: The university moves into the Schloss. * 1920: The WiSo Faculty (Business Administration, Economics & Social Sciences) is established. * 1927: Science is taken out of the Faculty of Arts thus creating the new Faculty of Science. * 1961: The FAU acquires a further faculty through merger with the Nuremberg College of Economics and Social Sciences (founded in 1919). The university's name is now Friedrich-Alexander Universit√§t Erlangen-N√ºrnberg. * 1966: The Faculty of Engineering is established. (FAU is thus the first of the traditional universities of the old federal republic to incorporate engineering as an independent faculty.) * 1972: The Teacher Training College in Nuremberg is incorporated into the Faculty of Education. * 1993: The FAU celebrates its 250th anniversary. * 1994: The Free State of Bavaria purchases for the university 4.4 hectares of land in Erlangen previously owned by the US military. The area is now called R√∂thelheim Campus. * 2000: The Bavaria- California Technology Centre opens its headquarters at the University of Erlangen-N√ºrnberg. * 2000: Inauguration of the Research Centre in Clinical Molecular Biology in Erlangen. * 2001: Opening of the R√∂thelheim Campus on the site of the old artillery barracks. * 2004: Inauguration of the new building at the WiSo Faculty of Business Administration, Economics & Social Sciences in Nuremberg. Campuses =FAU Busan campus= FAU is the first German university to establish a branch campus in Busan in the Republic of Korea. In November 2009, its campus project received approval from the Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology. The FAU Busan Branch Campus offers a Graduate School with a master's degree program in Chemical and Bioengineering and a research center. In 2014, the university announced its intention of working toward making the Busan-Jinhae Free Economic Zone an educational hub. To this end, FAU Busan works internationally with various companies and universities. =Library= The University Library Erlangen-N√ºrnberg is the library system of the Friedrich Alexander University and is a regional library for the region of Middle Franconia. As an academic universal library, it offers its users a wide range of specialist literature from all faculties and a variety of services. With approximately 5.4 million volumes, it is Bavaria's largest library outside the state capital Munich. Large parts of the media stock are also accessible in interregional lending. The University Library is a member of the Bibliotheksverbund Bayern (Bavarian library union). Faculties The Kollegienhaus, the historical central building and lecture hall of the University at the borders of the Schlossgarten In February 2007, the senate of the university decided upon a restructuring into five faculties. Since October 2007, the FAU consists of: * Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences, and Theology * Faculty of Business, Economics, and Law * Faculty of Medicine * Faculty of Sciences * Faculty of Engineering The following faculties were part of the university (sorted in the order in which they were founded): * Theological faculty * Law faculty * Medical faculty * Philosophical faculty I (philosophy, history, and social sciences) * Philosophical faculty II (languages and literature) * Science faculty I (mathematics and physics) * Science faculty II (biology, chemistry, and pharmaceutics) * Science faculty III (geography, geology/mineralogy/paleontology) * Business- and social sciences faculty (1961) in Nuremberg * Technical Faculty (1966) * Pedagogical faculty (1972) in Nuremberg Logo of the University Hospital Old University Library (Erlangen) =Faculty of Engineering= Inception In 1962, after lengthy debate, the Bavarian parliament decided to establish a Faculty of Engineering in Erlangen. Then, the University of Erlangen thus won out against the city of Nuremberg, which, for decades, had been demanding the establishment of a college of engineering in Nuremberg. Since the expansive areas of building land required for this project were not available in the center of Erlangen, the foundations for a new university campus were laid in the south east of the town in 1964. The formal establishment of the Faculty of Engineering, then the seventh faculty at the University, took place in 1966. What was unique at the time was that the various engineering departments were subsumed, as a faculty, into the main university rather than constituting an independent university. Present status The Faculty of Engineering at FAU is a young educational and research institution. Since its foundation in 1966. The Faculty has five departments: * Electrical, Electronic and Communication Engineering * Chemical and Biological Engineering * Materials Science and Engineering (This Department was ranked at 10th best in the world according to the Quantitative Ranking of Engineering Disciplines (QRED).) * Mechanical Engineering * Computer Science The Faculty has close connections both with other natural sciences and with traditional subjects at the university. The Faculty of Engineering currently concentrates on the following research fields: * New Materials and Processes * Life Science Engineering and Medicine Technology * Energy Technology and Mobility * Modeling and Simulation * Optics and Optical Technologies * Information- and Communication Technologies * Micro-/Nano-electronics Research =Major research areas= FAU claims leadership in a number of research topics. The current eight such major research areas are: *New Materials and Processes *Optics and Optical Technologies *Molecular Life Science and Medicine *Health Technology *Electronics, Information and Communication *Energy, Environment and Climate *Language - Culture - Region *Cohesion ‚Äì Transformation ‚Äì Innovation in Law and Economics =Excellence initiative= The Excellence Initiative by the German federal and state governments to promote science and research at German universities aims to promote cutting-edge research and to strengthen the higher education and research in Germany to improve its international competitiveness and to make top performers in academia and science visible. As part of this initiative, FAU was awarded the contract for the Erlangen Graduate School in Advanced Optical Technologies (SAOT), which received 1.9 million euros of annual funding for the next five years. The Cluster of Excellence 'Engineering of Advanced Materials and Processes' (EAM) was also established at FAU as part of the initiative and has been approved in the second round. EAM is funded with 40 million euros. Cluster of Excellence 'Engineering of Advanced Materials The Cluster of Excellence 'Engineering of Advanced Materials ‚Äì Hierarchical Structure Formation for Functional Devices' (EAM) is the only interdisciplinary research collaboration of its type in Germany to focus on the investigation of functional materials and their processing at all length scales. The main research focus is on the fundamental and applied aspects of designing and creating novel high- performance materials. It is part of the Excellence Initiative of the German Research Foundation. Erlangen Graduate School in Advanced Optical Technologies The Erlangen Graduate School in Advanced Optical Technologies (SAOT) was founded in 2006. SAOT‚Äôs scientific focus lies on optics and optical technology, two fields which are considered key technologies of the 21st century. SAOT is currently funded with seven million euros. =Research institutions= Central institutions Interdisciplinary centers Research centers and centers of excellence Partnerships FAU is the first German university to establish a branch campus in Busan in the Republic of Korea. FAU has contacts with approximately 500 universities all over the world, including many of the world's top universities like the University of Cambridge, Duke University, UCL, Imperial College London and many more.

El Pa√≠s, 22 June 2019. after to 1981) (Ferrol, 1910 ‚Äì Santiago de Compostela, 1990) was a Spanish philologist, academic and writer. He was the first Professor of Galician Language and Literature at the University of Santiago de Compostela. He was a member of the Royal Galician Academy, the Lisbon Academy of Sciences, and also an honorary member of the Galician Language Association. He was one of the main theorists of contemporary Galician reintegrationism and his works on this field are considered a primary reference. Many consider Carballo Calero as one of the most prominent figures of the twentieth century Galician intelligentsia. Youth and first involvement in politics In his student years, Carballo Calero participated in the Spanish left-wing republican movements opposing the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera. In 1926, he moved to Santiago de Compostela to study for degrees in Law and Philosophy and to do his compulsory military service. While there, he became acquainted with the ideas of Galicianism, and his political activism become an integral part of his life. In the late 1920s, he became friends with Soviet spy Ignace Reiss through mutual artist friends, while Reiss was stationed in Amsterdam. In 1931, he joined the Partido Galeguista (\\"Galicianist Party\\") and contributed to the draft of the first Galician Statute of Autonomy alongside intellectuals such as Alfonso Daniel Rodr√≠guez Castelao. He also collaborated with left-wing nationalist organizations such as Esquerda Galeguista (\\"Galician Left\\") and with political publications such as Claridad (\\"Clarity\\") and Ser (\\"To Be\\"). He completed his college studies in 1936. Ostracism and eventual incorporation to the University Following the Francoist revolt and the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Carballo Calero became a volunteer combatant for the Spanish Republic, achieving the rank of lieutenant in the Spanish Republican Army. He was captured by the Francoists and convicted on the grounds of \\"secessionism\\" and sentenced to sixteen years in the jail of Ja√©n (Spain). Yet, he was released in 1941. He returned to his natal city of Ferrol, where he worked as a private tutor as he was banned from holding any public position, including teaching. He re-established contact with the Galicianists and began his doctoral studies, eventually getting his PhD in 1955. His thesis was published in 1963 with the title Historia da literatura galega contempor√°nea (\\"History of contemporary Galician literature\\"). In 1958, he was invited to join the Real Academia Galega (\\"Royal Galician Academy\\"). In 1965, he was allowed to hold public positions again, and moved to the Galician capital Compostela where he taught Galician language and literature at the Rosalia de Castro high school, while he started to also teach at the University of Santiago de Compostela. Finally, in 1972, he became the first ever university professor in the field of Galician Linguistics and Literature. At that stage, Carballo Calero can be considered the world expert in the work of poet Rosalia de Castro. He also became an editor and publisher, promoting classic Galician writers. \\"Reintegracionism\\" Through his university research on Galician language, he became interested in etymology and the works of Manuel Rodrigues Lapa. This research, combined with his vast knowledge of the history of the Galician-Portuguese language led him re-interpret Galician classics and to develop the theory of what would become contemporary \\"reintegracionism\\": in short, the idea that had been stated in the past but never scientifically systematised that Galician and Portuguese languages were not just the same language in the past, sharing a common origin, but still are the same language today. Carballo Calero became the chief supporter of that view. With the end of Francoist Spain in 1977, Galicia became an autonomous community with Galician as its official language along with Spanish. It was then urgently required to establish a fixed standard form. As professor of Galician language and literature, Carballo Calero was appointed to lead the group of experts that should prepare the new norms for Galician. The first draft was produced in 1979 with the title Normas ortogr√°ficas do idioma galego (\\"Orthographic norms of the Galician language\\"). These norms recommended a gradual approach to Portuguese, using Portuguese as the most suitable orthographic reference for spoken Galician while allowing for a number of different solutions in case of doubt. However, this approximation to Portuguese was perceived by some pro-Spanish conservative groups as a possible political stance. Consequently, the norms were revoked without Carballo's consent by means of a special law (the Decreto Filgueira). In light of those events, Carballo Calero resigned his position in 1980. A new set of norms was passed in 1982 by the newly created Instituto Galego da Lingua (\\"Galician Institute for the Language\\") and the Royal Galician Academy, of which he was still a member. Carballo Calero had by then helped to create the Galician Association for the Language (1981) to counteract what he thought to be an attempt to \\"damage\\" the language. He became an open critic of the new decisions on Galician language which he considered to be merely \\"political and not scientific\\". He even stated that the new norms and linguistic laws provoked a situation which \\"is anti-hygienic and goes against the economy\\" (in Uma voz na Galiza, 1984). In 1984, he was awarded the Medalla Castelao ‚Äì the greatest civil award in Galicia. Also, he was invited to join the Consello da Cultura Galega (\\"Council for the Galician Culture\\"), but he declined the invitation. Carballo Calero died in Santiago de Compostela in 1990.

It uses a simple Archimedes' screw to mix (clockwise) and to lift the concrete to the delivery chute. Ready-Mix Concrete is concrete that is manufactured in a batch plant, according to a set engineered mix design. Ready-mix concrete is normally delivered in two ways. First is the barrel truck or in‚Äìtransit mixers. This type of truck delivers concrete in a plastic state to the site. Second is the volumetric concrete mixer. This delivers the ready mix in a dry state and then mixes the concrete on site. Batch plants combine a precise amount of gravel, sand, water and cement together by weight (as per mix design formulation for grade of concrete recommended by the Structural consultant), allowing specialty concrete mixtures to be developed and implemented on construction sites. The first ready-mix factory was built in the 1930s, but the industry did not begin to expand significantly until the 1960s, and it has continued to grow since then. Ready-mix concrete is often used over other materials due to the cost and wide range of uses in building, particularly in large projects like high rise buildings and bridges. It has a long life span when compared to other products of a similar use, like road ways. It has an average life span of 30 years under high traffic areas compared to the 10 to 12 year life of asphalt concrete with the same traffic. Ready-mix concrete, or RMC as it's also known, refers to concrete that is specifically batched or manufactured for customers' construction projects, and supplied to the customer on site as a single product. It is a mixture of Portland or other cements, water and aggregates: sand, gravel, or crushed stone. All aggregates should be of a washed type material with limited amounts of fines or dirt and clay. An admixture is also added to improve work-ability of the concrete and/or increase setting time of concrete (using retarders) to factor in the time required for the transit mixer to reach the site/ place of casting. Ready-mixed concrete is used in construction projects where the construction site is not willing, or not able, to mix concrete on site. Using ready-mixed concrete means product is delivered finished, on demand, in the specific quantity required, to the specific mix design required. For a small to medium project, the cost and time of hiring mixing equipment, labour, plus purchase and storage for the ingredients of concrete, added to environmental concerns (cement dust is a particular airborne health hazard and nuisance) may simply be not worth it when compared to the linear cost model of ready-mixed concrete, where the customer pays for what they use, and lets someone else do the work up to that point. For a large project, outsourcing concrete production to ready-mixed concrete suppliers means delegating the quality control and testing, material logistics and supply chain issues, and mix design, to specialists who are already set up for those tasks, trading off against introducing another contracted external supplier who needs to make a profit, and losing the control and immediacy of on-site mixing. Ready-mix concrete is bought and sold by volume ‚Äì usually expressed in cubic meters (cubic yards in the US). Batching and mixing is done under controlled conditions. In the UK, ready-mixed concrete is specified either informally, by constituent weight or volume (1-2-4 or 1-3-6 being common mixes) or using the formal specification standards of the European standard EN 206+ A1, which is supplemented in the UK by BS 8500\\\\. This allows the customer to specify what the concrete has to be able to withstand in terms of ground conditions, exposure, and strength, and allows the concrete manufacturer to design a mix that meets that requirement using the materials locally available to a batching plant. This is verified by laboratory testing, such as performing cube tests to verify compressive strength and supplemented by field testing, such as slump tests done on site to verify plasticity of the mix. The performance of a concrete mix can be altered by use of admixtures. Admixtures can be used to reduce water requirements, entrain air into a mixture, add small fibres of PPP to improve surface durability, or even superplasticise concrete to make it self-levelling, as self-consolidating concrete, but the use of admixtures requires precision in dosing and mix design, which is more difficult without the dosing/measuring equipment and laboratory backing of a batching plant, which means they are not easily used outside of ready-mixed concrete. Concrete has a limited lifespan between batching / mixing and curing. This means that ready-mixed concrete should be placed within 30 to 45 minutes of batching process to hold slump and mix design specifications in the USA,ASTM C 94 and AASHTO M 157 though in the UK, environmental and material factors, plus in-transit mixing, allow for up two hours to elapse. Modern admixtures and water reducers can modify that time span to some degree. Ready-mixed concrete can be transported and placed at site using a number of methods. The most common, and simplest, is the chute fitted to the back of transit mixer trucks (as in picture), which is suitable for placing concrete near locations where a truck can just reverse in. Dumper trucks, crane hoppers, truck-mounted conveyors, and, in extremis, wheelbarrows, can be used to place concrete from trucks where access is not direct. Some concrete mixes are suitable for pumping with a concrete pump. In 2011, there were 2,223 companies employing 72,925 workers that produced RMC in the United States. Advantages and disadvantages of ready-mix concrete * Materials are combined in a batch plant, and the hydration process begins at the moment water meets the cement, so the travel time from the plant to the site, and the time before the concrete is placed on site, is critical over longer distances. Some sites are just too far away; however, the use of admixtures, retarders and cements like pulverized fly ash or ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) can be used to slow the hydration process, allowing for longer transit and waiting time. *Concrete is formable and pourable, but a steady supply is needed for large forms. If there is a supply interruption, and the concrete cannot be poured all at once, a cold joint may appear in the finished form. *The biggest advantage is that concrete is produced under controlled conditions. Therefore, Quality concrete is obtained, as a ready-mix concrete mix plant makes use of sophisticated equipment and consistent methods. There is strict control over the testing of materials, process parameters and continuous monitoring of key practices during the manufacturing process. Poor control on the input materials, batching and mixing methods in the case of site mix concrete is solved in a ready-mix concrete production method. *Speed in the construction practices followed in ready mix concrete plant is followed continuously by having mechanized operations. The output obtained from a site mix concrete plant using a 8/12 mixer is 4 to 5 metric cubes per hour which is 30-60 metric cubes per hour in a ready mix concrete plant. *Better handling and proper mixing practice will help to reduce the consumption of cement by 10 ‚Äì 12%. Use of admixtures and other cementitious materials will help to reduce the amount of cement as is required to make the desired grade of concrete. *Less consumption of cement indirectly results in less environmental pollution. *Ready mix concrete manufacture have less dependency on human labours hence the chances of human errors is reduced. This will also reduce the dependency on intensive labours. * Cracking and shrinkage. Concrete shrinks as it cures. It can shrink inch (1.59mm) over a 10 foot long area (3.05 meters). This causes stress internally on the concrete and must be accounted for by the engineers and finishers placing the concrete, and may require use of steel reinforcement or pre-stressed concrete elements where this is critical. * Access roads and site access have to be able to carry the weight of the ready-mix truck plus load which can be up to 32 tonnes for an eight-wheel 9 m¬≥ truck. (Green concrete is approximately 3,924 pounds per cubic yard, or 2,400 Kg/m¬≥). This problem can be overcome by utilizing so- called \\"mini mix\\" trucks which use smaller 4 m¬≥ capacity mixers able to reach more weight restricted sites. Even smaller mixers are used to allow a 7.5 tonne truck to hold approximately 1.25 m¬≥, to reach restricted inner city areas with bans on larger trucks. Metered concrete As an alternative to centralized batch plant system is the volumetric mobile mixer. This is often referred to as on-site concrete, site mixed concrete or mobile mix concrete. This is a mobile miniaturized version of the large stationary batch plant. They are used to provide ready mix concrete utilizing a continuous batching process or metered concrete system. The volumetric mobile mixer is a truck that holds sand, rock, cement, water, fiber, and some add mixtures and color depending on how the batch plant is outfitted. These trucks mix or batch the ready mix on the job site itself. This type of truck can mix as much or as little amount of concrete as needed. The on-site mixing eliminates the travel time hydration that can cause the transit mixed concrete to become unusable, These trucks are just as precise as the centralized batch plant system, since the trucks are scaled and tested using the same ASTM (American standard test method)ASTM (American standard test method) like all other ready mix manufactures. This is a hybrid approach between centralized batch plants and traditional on-site mixing. Each type of system has advantages and disadvantages, depending on the location, size of the job, and mix design set forth by the engineer. = Transit mixed ready mix vs. volumetric mixed ready mix = *A centralized concrete batching plant can serve a wide area. Site-mix trucks can serve an even larger area including very remote locations that standard trucks cannot. *The batch plants are located in areas zoned for industrial use, while the delivery trucks can service residential districts or inner cities. Site-mix trucks have the same capabilities. *Volumetric trucks often have a lower water demand during the batching process. This will produce a concrete that can be significantly stronger in compressive strength compared to the centralized batch plant for the same mix design using the ASTM C109 test method. *Centralized batch systems are limited by the size of the fleet. It may take upwards of 10 minutes to batch and load out one 9 - 12 yard (6 - 9 m¬≥) truck depending on the plant size and type. They are unable to change mix designs in the middle of an individual batching process, but can quickly offer a greater range of mixes overall as a central yard has more stock capacity for different types of cement, aggregates, and admixtures than a single truck has room for on site. *Volumetric mixers can seamlessly change all aspects of the mix design while still producing concrete, as long as the raw materials are on site. They can continuously mix quality concrete for an indefinite time while being continuously loaded with fresh materials. They can produce 1 yard of concrete in as little as 40 seconds depending on the mix design and batch plant size outfitted. *Centralised batching, using the same supply of materials over a long period (a fixed plant will likely have a fixed set of suppliers in its locality), the same scales which can be calibrated by weighbridges, the same measuring equipment for admixtures, moisture etc, and often the same batching operator, can have tighter tolerances for mixes, use a centralised lab to design and verify dozens of mixes to different specifications across multiple jobs for that plant, and can therefore produce a very predictable, consistent result for major projects. Each plant will have a batching recipe book (or equivalent automated batching program) to batch and load any quantity of any mix design on demand. *Centralized batching can scale quickly with less movement than on site mixers, using aggregate trucks, cement tankers and ground stocks to achieve up to 240 cubic metres an hour from a single plant. This allows consistent large-scale pours across a site quickly, as supply logistics for cement, water, and aggregate are fixed to a single point with greater storage capacity, and therefore easier to scale, and more tolerant of short supply interruptions. *For small loads (orders under 10 yards) transit mixers typically return to their batch plant after each delivery. Volumetric trucks can go directly from job to job until a truck is emptied, reducing traffic and fuel consumption.

It is the headquarters of the Cuttack district. The name of the city is an anglicised form of Kataka which literally means The Fort, a reference to the ancient Barabati Fort around which the city initially developed. Cuttack is known as the Millennium City as well as the Silver City due to its history of 1000 years and famous silver filigree works. It is considered as the judicial capital of Odisha as the Orissa High Court is located here. It is the commercial capital of Odisha which hosts many trading and business houses in and around the city. Cuttack is famous for its Durga puja which is the most important festival of Odisha. Cuttack is also the birthplace of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. The city is categorised as a Tier-II city as per the ranking system used by Government of India. The old and the most important part of the city is centred on a strip of land between the Kathajodi River and the Mahanadi River, bounded on the south-east by Old Jagannath Road. The city, being a part of the Cuttack Municipal Corporation consisting of 59 wards. Cuttack stretches from Phulnakhara across the Kathajodi in the south to Choudwar in north across the Birupa River, while in the east it begins at Kandarpur and runs west as far as Naraj. Four rivers including Mahanadi and its distributaries Kathajodi, Kuakhai, Birupa run through the city. Further Kathajodi is distributed into Devi and Biluakhai which often makes the geographical area look like fibrous roots. Cuttack and Bhubaneswar are often referred to as the Twin-Cities of Odisha. The metropolitan area formed by the two cities has a population of 1.862 million in 2018. Cuttack, an unplanned city, is characterized by a maze of streets, lanes and by-lanes which have given it the nickname of a city with Bauna Bazaar, Tepana Galee and i.e. 52 markets and 53 streets.  Etymology  The name Cuttack is derived from Sanskrit meaning capital, fort and military establishment or a cantonment. The city was known as Bidanasi Katak (meaning Bidanasi Military Base) during the days when Barabati Fort was in existence. Bidanasi is now one of the localities of the city. In the ancient time, capitals were often called as Cuttack like Bidanasi Cuttack, Ayodhya Cuttack, Mathura Cuttack, Varanasi Cuttack, etc. Being the Capital it has been simply called as Cuttack instead of Bidanasi Cuttack. Established in 989 CE, by Maharaja Markata Keshari, Cuttack was the seat of government in Odisha for close to a thousand years before its burgeoning size forced the creation of a new capital at Bhubaneswar in 1948. The two cities are collectively referred to as the Twin Capitals. Cuttack is famous for its unique silver filigree works (Tarakasi), and woven textiles and horn works. It is famous for its Dussehra celebrations across India only after Kolkata. It is also famous for \\"Dahibara\\", a local delicacy made using black gram and potato curry and also for \\"Chhena poda\\" and \\"Rasagola\\", local dessert made of unripened curd cheese made from water buffalo or regular cow milk.  History  The earliest written history of Cuttack may go back to the Keshari dynasty. As stated by the distinguished historian Andrew Stirling, present-day Cuttack was established as a military cantonment by king Nrupa Keshari of Keshari dynasty in 989 CE. Stirling based his opinion on the Madala Panji, a chronicle of the Jagannath temple of Puri. The reign of Maharaja Markata Keshari was distinguished for the stone embank built to protect the new capital from flood in 1002 CE. Historical and archaeological evidence suggests Cuttack becoming capital of a kingdom founded by Raja Anangabhimadeva III of Ganga dynasty in 1211 CE. After the end of Ganga rule, Odisha passed to the hands of the Suryavamsi Gajapati dynasty (1434‚Äì1541 CE) under whom Cuttack continued to be the capital of Odisha. After the death of Raja Mukunda deva, the last Hindu king of Orissa, Cuttack first came under Muslim rule and later under Mughals, who made Cuttack the seat of the new Orissa Subah (imperial top-level province) under Shah Jahan. By 1750, Cuttack came under Maratha rule and it grew fast as a business centre being the convenient point of contact between the Marathas of Nagpur and the English merchants of Bengal. It was occupied by the British in 1803 and later became the capital of Odisha division in 1816. From 1948 onwards, when the capital was shifted to Bhubaneswar, the city remained the administrative headquarters for the state of Odisha. The introduction of the Sharadiya Utsav tradition in the city dates back to the visit of Saint Chaitanya in the 16th century when the consecration of the idol of Durga by using the mask pattern was conducted in his presence at Binod Behari Devi Mandap. The remains of the old moated Barabati Fort still exist in the heart of Cuttack.

Early U.S. Army career Robert G. Cole was born at Fort Sam Houston, in San Antonio, Texas, to Colonel Clarence F. Cole, an Army doctor, and Clara H. Cole on March 19, 1915. He graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in San Antonio in 1933 and joined the United States Army on July 1, 1934. On June 26, 1935, he was honorably discharged to accept an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. Cole graduated with the class of 1939 and returned home to marry Allie Mae Wilson. He was appointed a second lieutenant to the 15th Infantry at Fort Lewis, Washington in 1939, and remained there until his transfer to the 501st Parachute Infantry Battalion at Fort Benning, Georgia, in 1941. In March 1941, he earned his jump wings. Rapidly advancing through the ranks at Fort Benning as the parachute infantry battalions were expanded to regiments, he was a lieutenant colonel commanding the 3rd Battalion of the 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment on June 6, 1944, the date of his unit's first combat jump. D-Day operations Lt Col. Cole parachuted into Normandy with his unit as part of the American airborne landings in Normandy. By the evening of June 6, he had gathered 75 men. They captured Exit 3 at Saint-Martin-de-Varreville behind Utah Beach and were at the dune line to welcome men from the U.S. 4th Infantry Division coming ashore. After being in division reserve, Cole's battalion had guarded the right flank of the 101st Airborne Division attempts to take the approaches to Carentan. On the afternoon of June 10, Cole led 400 men of his battalion single file down a long, exposed causeway (Purple Heart Lane), with marshes at either side. A hedgerow behind a large farmhouse on the right was occupied by well dug-in German troops. At the far end of the causeway was the last of four bridges over the Douve River flood plain. Beyond the last bridge was Carentan, which the 101st had been ordered to seize to effect a linkup with the 29th Infantry Division coming off Omaha Beach. During the advance Cole's battalion was subjected to continuous fire from artillery, machine guns and mortars. Cole's battalion, advancing slowly by crawling or crouching, took numerous casualties. The survivors huddled against the bank on the far side of the causeway. An obstacle known as a Belgian gate blocked nearly the entire roadway over the last bridge, allowing the passage of only one man at a time. Attempts to force this bottleneck were futile, and the battalion took up defensive positions for the night. During the night, Cole's men were exposed to shelling by German mortars and by a strafing and bombing attack by two aircraft, causing further casualties and knocking Company I out of the fight. However the fire from the farm slackened and the remaining 265 men infiltrated through the obstacle and took up positions for an assault. With the Germans still resisting any attempt to move beyond the bridges, and after artillery failed to suppress their fire, Cole called for smoke on the dug-in Germans and ordered a bayonet charge, a rarity in World War II. He charged toward the hedgerow, leading only a small portion of his unit at first. The remainder of the battalion, seeing what was happening followed as Cole led the paratroopers into the hedgerows, engaging at close range and with bayonets in hand-to-hand combat. The German survivors retreated, taking more casualties as they withdrew. The assault, which came to be known as \\"Cole's Charge,\\" proved costly; 130 of Cole's 265 men became casualties. With his battalion exhausted, Cole called for the 1st Battalion to pass through his lines and continue the attack. However, they were also severely depleted by mortar fire crossing bridge #4, such that they took up positions with 3rd Battalion rather than proceeding. There, on the edge of Carentan, they were subjected to strong counterattacks by the German 6th Parachute Regiment during the morning and afternoon. At the height of the attack, at approximately 1900, Cole's artillery observer managed to break through radio jamming and called down a concentration by the entire Corps artillery that broke up the attacks for good. At 0200 on June 12 the 506th PIR passed through their line and captured Hill 30 to the south of Carentan. From there, led by Company E, the 2nd battalion of the 506th PIR (Band of Brothers) attacked north into Carentan at daylight as part of a 3-battalion assault. The German 6th Parachute Regiment, virtually out of ammunition, had abandoned the town during the night, leaving only a small rear guard. By 0730 of June 12 Carentan was captured. Death & Medal of Honor Grave, Netherlands American Cemetery and Memorial, Margraten, the Netherlands.LTC Cole was recommended for a Medal of Honor for his actions that day, but did not live to receive it. On September 18, 1944, during Operation Market Garden, Colonel Cole, commanding the 3rd Battalion of the 502d PIR in Best, Netherlands, got on the radio. A pilot asked him to put some orange identification panels in front of his position. Cole decided to do it himself. For a moment, Cole raised his head, shielding his eyes to see the plane. Suddenly a shot was fired by a German sniper in a farmhouse only 300 yards away, killing Cole instantly. Two weeks later, he was awarded the Medal of Honor for his bayonet charge near Carentan on June 11. As his widow and two-year-old son looked on, Cole's mother accepted his posthumous award on the parade ground, where Cole had played as a child, at Fort Sam Houston. LTC Cole is buried at Netherlands American Cemetery and Memorial, in Margraten, the Netherlands. =Medal of Honor citation= > For gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his own life, above and beyond > the call of duty on 11 June 1944, in France.

At the peak of planning, 158 families had put themselves on a waiting list to move into the town. In the early stages of the project, Miller and Barwacz were invited to establish the townsite at Spencer, South Dakota as there were many available lots, but this offer was rejected in favor of the site near the I-90 / US 81 interchange. As planning progressed, this project was the subject of much \\"pro\\" and \\"con\\" discussions, the \\"pro\\" discussion coming from various organizations including the National Association of the Deaf.

By 2007, a number of factors combined that led Miller and Barwacz to dissolve the Laurent Company (which had been coordinating efforts to build the town) and relocate to Indiana: Miller and Barwacz had exhausted their own funds, the main \\"angel investor\\" that Miller had been depending on for $10 million in funding was unable to deliver, and most importantly to Miller, he had serious concerns over the quality of the education his children were receiving at the South Dakota School for the Deaf in Sioux Falls.

Nadel and starring Elvis Presley, Shelley Fabares, and Bill Bixby. Written for the screen by Arthur Browne Jr., the film is about the heir to an oil fortune who trades places with a water-ski instructor at a Florida hotel to see if girls will like him for himself, rather than his father's money. Clambake was the last of Presley's four films for United Artists. The movie reached number 15 on the national weekly box-office charts. Plot Scott Hayward (Presley) rebels against the plans and expectations of his father, extremely rich oil tycoon Duster Hayward (Gregory). He drives to Florida in his red 1959 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray Racer to find himself. When Scott stops for gas and refreshments, he encounters Tom Wilson (Hutchins), who is on his way to take a job as a water skiing instructor at a Miami hotel. A chance remark by Tom gives Scott the idea to switch identities with Tom so he can find out how people react to him as an ordinary person rather than as a millionaire. Tom has fun staying at the same hotel and pretending he is rich. Shortly after, hotel guest Dianne Carter (Fabares) insists on taking a lesson minutes after Scott checks in with his new \\"employer\\". However, once they are out on the water, Dianne proves herself to be an expert skier, performing fancy maneuvers to gain the attention of wealthy young playboy James J. Jamison III (Bixby). Later, Dianne confesses to Scott that she is a gold digger, assuming that he is one, too. Scott agrees to help Dianne land Jamison, but ends up falling for her himself. Scott persuades boat builder Sam Burton (Merrill) to allow him to rebuild Burton's Rawhide, a high-performance boat that was damaged when raced at high speed, and drive it in the annual Orange Bowl Race, which Jamison has won the last three years. Scott sends for some \\"goop\\", an experimental coating one of his father's companies spent a lot of money trying (and failing) to perfect. Between his day job and working on the goop at night, Scott is run ragged, but he thinks he has fixed the goop's major flaw: losing its strength in water. With no time for testing before the race, he applies it to the boat's hull and hopes it will hold the Rawhide together. Duster learns where his son is and comes to see what he is doing. To Scott's surprise, his father is enormously proud of what he is doing. Meanwhile, Jamison proposes to Dianne. Scott enters the suite before she can give Jamison an answer, but the playboy informs Scott they are getting married right after he wins the race. Dianne, however, decides to give up her scheme and return home. In the race, Jamison takes the lead in his boat, the Scarlet Lady, but Scott passes him at the finish line. Scott then offers to give Dianne a lift. On the drive, he gives her an engagement ring he bought with the winnings from the race. Dianne insists that Scott take it back, but agrees to marry him. This prompts Scott to confess to Dianne who he really is. She does not believe him at first, but when he shows her his driver's license, she faints.

The water- skiing and Corvette-driving double for Presley was Artie Warren. (Warren was then employed at Leo Benz's Ski School for water skiers.) Lee Majors connived his way in as an extra in the film, playing a mustachioed waiter in the lounge scene about 22 minutes in. He confirmed this in 2017, at the 2017 Florida Supercon fan convention. Production After numerous delays, principal photography on Clambake began on March 22, 1967. As Presley began the last decade of his life, Clambake was the last film for which he was able to demand and receive a salary of $1 million. The relative lackluster box-office performance of this movie, combined with his desire to do more serious, less commercial films, meant that studios were no longer willing to guarantee him a seven-figure paycheck for his performance. In her 1985 book Elvis and Me, on which Sandra Harmon collaborated with her, Priscilla Presley writes that by the time filming began on Clambake, Elvis' growing distress with the quality of his films led to a despondency accompanied by overeating that had his weight balloon from his normal 170 lb (77 kg) to 200 lb (91 kg). (Elvis, Albert Goldman's 1981 biography of Presley, corroborates this statement Priscilla made to Harmon.) A movie studio executive ordered him to lose the weight in a hurry, marking the introduction of diet pills to his already excessive regimen of medications. During this time, owing to the involvement of Larry Geller, a hair stylist who later became one of \\"The Guys\\" (also called the \\"Memphis Mafia\\"), as Presley called his entourage, in his life, Presley was growing increasingly interested in religious studies and spirituality, and was reading a great deal on the subjects. Colonel Tom Parker felt that these pursuits were distracting Elvis from his performance, and he ordered the singer not to read any books while the film was being shot; there is no evidence to indicate that Presley complied with the directive. Production was halted for nearly two weeks in the middle of filming when Elvis fell and hit his head in the mansion where he was living during the shooting, resulting in a mild concussion. Although set in Florida, only some second-unit stock footage was shot there - including the prominent use of the Miami Marine Stadium, where the climatic speedboat race was filmed, with California close- ups of Elvis and Bill Bixby cut in. Virtually the entire film was shot in southern California (resulting in the scene with the sun seemingly setting over the ocean in the east). Several exterior \\"Florida\\" scenes also have very conspicuous California mountains in the background. Other bloopers include oil fields in Florida. The boats in the boat garage have registration numbers starting with \\"CF\\" (California) and not \\"FL\\" (Florida). In Japan, the film was released under the alternate title Blue Miami (rendered in Japanese script), a reference to the earlier Presley film Blue Hawaii. Soundtrack The soundtrack album reached number 40 on the Billboard album chart. Reception The film premiered in October 1967, but did not have a wide release until December. The New York Times' Howard Thompson called the film \\"a real Christmas clinker\\" and a \\"silly, tired little frolic,\\" remarking that \\"even staunch Presley admirers‚Äîand we're one of them when he delivers the likes of Fun in Acapulco and Viva Las Vegas‚Äîwill have to strain to justify this one.\\" Thompson panned everything in the film, including the co-stars, music, predictable finale, the overuse of rear-screen projection, and the obvious location shots of the West Coast of the U.S. Variety ran a positive review, declaring it one of Presley's \\"top offerings to date, backed by a legitimately-premised story line, melodic songs, acceptable acting and winding with a spectacular water race. Film has all the makings of being one of Presley's heaviest grossers.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Like most Presley pictures, this one ... is pleasant and unpretentious yet has a synthetic appearance. The starlets look lacquered, the sets plasticized and there's much reliance on process work.\\"Thomas, Kevin. \\"Presley Has a 'Clambake'\\". Los Angeles Times. November 1, 1967. Part V, p. 13. The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that Presley \\"floats amiably through a flimsy story enlivened only by an occasional touch of humour and an engaging performance from James Gregory as a drawling Texan oil millionaire.\\" The review thought that \\"the only really jarring note is the very unpersonable heroine.\\" Filmink felt Presley and Fabares had none of the chemistry they showed in Girl Happy. Presley himself considered Clambake to be his worst movie. In popular culture In the 2005 miniseries Elvis, a scene depicts a frustrated Presley (played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers) on the set of Clambake, filming the \\"Who Needs Money\\" motorcycle scene. Presley also mentions to Colonel Parker that he only signed on to do the movie because he [Parker] told him to, and that he needs the money.

Richard Stanley Nickel (May 31, 1928 ‚Äì April 13, 1972) was a Polish American architectural photographer and historical preservationist, who was based in Chicago, Illinois.

Crystal where a young Richard attended grammar school at St. Cyril and Methodius. It was here that Richard first became fascinated by light as he stared at the saintly figures drawn in stained glass. Nickel would tell a reporter in 1969 \\"That makes an impression on you that you never completely forget. It might be subconscious and, at some point, something triggers it\\". The family moved to a second floor apartment at 2457 N. Rockwell in the Logan Square community, while Nickel was in fifth grade and enrolled at St. John Berchman's School.They All Fall Down: p. 32 At the time the neighborhood was predominately Polish, and years later Nickel described it as the \\"Polish neighborhood where I became happily abnormal\\". The family lived near Logan Boulevard, an area lined with historic mansions and wide parkways that would later become recognized as a Chicago Landmark. More important was his father Stanley's acute interest in photography which Richard would take up as well. In 1948 after leaving the Army, Nickel was given a victory medal and subsequently enrolled at the Institute of Design, which became part of IIT- The Illinois Institute of Technology. The school was housed in the former Chicago Historical Society building, located at 632 N. Dearborn Street (Northwest corner of Dearborn and Ontario streets, now called the Excaliber nightclub).They All Fall Down: p. 39 Nickel married a young Polish American girl named Adrienne Dembo at St. Wenceslaus church, noted for its Art Deco design, on June 10, 1950.They All Fall Down: p. 44 Shortly after Richard was recalled to serve in the Korean War.They All Fall Down: p. 45 After Richard's return a few years later, he was a changed man, with recurring nightmares he was still in Korea.

HABS‚ÄîHistoric American Buildings Survey. During the urban regeneration of the 1960s and 1970s, scores of 19th century buildings in Chicago were being demolished. Among these were the works of Louis Sullivan and of other architects designing in the Prairie School style. By this time many of the buildings were neglected, with little public interest in their retention. Nickel encountered Sullivan's work while photographing the architect's buildings for a school project at the IIT Institute of Design in Chicago under Aaron Siskind. Studying and photographing Sullivan's buildings quickly became an obsession for him. Ultimately, he devoted much of his life to photographing them, hoping to produce a comprehensive photographic compendium. Some were documentation projects for the federal HABS‚ÄîHistoric American Buildings Survey. Richard Nickel came to believe that such buildings were an important part of Chicago's architectural and cultural heritage. Realizing that the pace of urban renewal and development seriously threatened many of these historic buildings, Nickel campaigned and lobbied for their preservation. Celebrated buildings such as the Garrick Theater and the Chicago Stock Exchange were torn down despite the best efforts of Nickel and others to preserve them. However, after Nickel's death, his crusade gained momentum and was responsible for many of Sullivan's buildings eventually being spared. Of the ongoing threat to Chicago's buildings Nickel said \\"Great architecture has only two natural enemies: water and stupid men.\\" In the cases where he was unable to protect a building, Nickel extensively photographed both its interior and exterior to archive the craftsmanship and attempt to preserve the buildings' character in his images. He also stripped some of the doomed buildings of their distinctive ornamentation before their destruction. Dozens of such items were sold to Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) and are still on display. Richard Nickel documented many of the architectural masters of Chicago, photographing the work of Burnham & Root, Holabird & Roche, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, C. F. Murphy Associates, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. =Residence= Nickel's home at 1810 West Cortland Street in Bucktown, Logan Square (Chicago) served as his base for photography and salvage operations. Infatuated with the brick building's front elevation, simple floor plan, and history, Nickel referred to it as his \\"Polish Palazzo\\".reservationchicago.org: \\"Success Story\\" He worked hard to restore the building. Death and legacy Richard Nickel was killed on April 13, 1972, while attempting to salvage more architectural items when a portion of the old Chicago Stock Exchange building collapsed on him. He is buried in Chicago's Graceland Cemetery, not far from Louis Sullivan. The 1994 book by Richard Cahan, They All Fall Down: Richard Nickel's Struggle to Save America's Architecture, is about Nickel's lifelong effort, with friend and architect John Vinci, to preserve Chicago's architectural heritage. Richard Cahan and Michael Williams co-edited a collection of Nickel's photography, titled Richard Nickel's Chicago: Photographs of a Lost City. =Works= Nickel's black-and-white photos have been displayed at the Art Institute of Chicago and elsewhere. The Richard Nickel Committee and Photographic Archive, a non-profit organization was devoted to preserving the photographer's work for more than 40 years, and holds the copyrights for most of his pictures. Nickel died without completing a book that he had begun in the 1950s, of his large collection of photographs of Sullivan's work that he took. The book was finally completed and published in 2010, The Complete Architecture of Adler & Sullivan ‚Äî by Richard Nickel, with Aaron Siskind, John Vinci, and Ward Miller. \\"Richard Nickel's Study of Louis Sullivan Is Published\\" (Dec. 2010) Richard Nickel Archive Richard Nickel's works, which include negatives, photographs, and research papers, have been donated to the Ryerson and Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago by the Richard Nickel Committee in 2010.Department of Public Affairs of the Art Institute of Chicago: \\"Donation of the Richard Nickel Archive\\" (17 Nov. 2010) The Richard Nickel Archive collection is accessible to the public at the Art Institute, along with a finding aid to the collection.Ryerson and Burnham Libraries: Richard Nickel Archive Finding Aid Also, more than 1,300 images from the Richard Nickel Committee's donated collection are available for viewing online at the Ryerson and Burnham Libraries' website pages for the Richard Nickel Archive.Ryerson and Burnham Libraries: Richard Nickel Archive Numerous duplicate photographs have been donated over time to other institutions, including The Arts Club of Chicago, the Society of Architectural Historians, Landmarks Illinois, and Preservation Chicago.

Diphenoxylate is an opioid and acts by slowing intestinal contractions; the atropine is present to prevent drug abuse and overdose. It should not be given to children due to the risk that they will stop breathing and should not be used in people with Clostridium difficile infection. Medical use Diphenoxylate is used to treat diarrhea in adults; it is only available as a combination drug with a subtherapeutic dose of atropine to prevent abuse. It should not be used in children due to the risk of respiratory depression. It does not appear harmful to a fetus but the risks have not been fully explored. It should not be taken with other central depressants like alcohol, as they can increase its risks. It should not be used for people with diarrhea caused by an infection, for example with Clostridium difficile infection, since the slowing of peristalsis can prevent clearing of the infectious organism. Adverse effects The drug label has warnings with regard to the risk of respiratory depression, anticholinergic toxicity and opioid overdose, the risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance that people with severe diarrhea always run, and toxic megacolon in people with ulcerative colitis. Other adverse effects include numbness in the hands and feet, euphoria, depression, lethargy, confusion, drowsiness, dizziness, restlessness, headache, hallucinations, edema, hives, swollen gums, itchiness, vomiting, nausea, loss of appetite, and stomach pain. Pharmacology Diphenoxylate is rapidly metabolized to difenoxin; it is eliminated mostly in feces but also in urine. Like other opioids, diphenoxylate acts by slowing intestinal contractions, allowing the body to consolidate intestinal contents and prolong transit time, thus allowing the intestines to draw moisture out of them at a normal or higher rate and therefore stop the formation of loose and liquid stools; the atropine is an anticholinergic and is present to prevent drug abuse and overdose. History and chemistry Diphenoxylate was first synthesized by Paul Janssen at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1956 as part of a medicinal chemistry investigation of opioids. Diphenoxylate is made by combining a precursor of normethadone with norpethidine. Loperamide (Imodium) and bezitramide are analogs. Like loperamide, it has a methadone-like structure and a piperdine moiety. Society and culture =Pricing= In 2017 Hikma Pharmaceuticals raised the price of its liquid formulation of generic diphenoxylate-atropine in the US by 430%, from $16 to $84.00. =Regulation= In the United States, drugs containing diphenoxylate combined with atropine salts are classified as Schedule V controlled substances. For label updates see FDA index page for NDA 012462 (Diphenoxlate by itself is a Schedule II controlled substance.) It is on Schedule III of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, only in forms that contain, according to the Yellow List: \\"not more than 2.5 milligrams of diphenoxylate calculated as base and a quantity of atropine sulfate equivalent to at least 1 per cent of the dose of diphenoxylate\\". Research Diphenoxylate and atropine have been studied in small trials as a treatment for fecal incontinence; it appears to be less efficacious and have more adverse effects when compared with loperamide or codeine.

He is a press officer for the North American Animal Liberation Press Office, a former director of the Animal Defense League of Los Angeles, and an advisor to SPEAK, the Voice for the Animals. Vlasak came to public attention in 2003, 2004, and again in 2008, when he made statements favorable to the use of violence against animal researchers. He and his wife were banned from entering the United Kingdom in 2004, on the grounds that their presence, according to the Home Secretary, \\"would not be conducive to the public good.\\" Education and career Born in Austin, Texas, Vlasak graduated with an M.D. from the University of Texas Medical School at Houston in 1983. He is board certified in General Surgery and is licensed as a medical doctor in California. He was an animal researcher himself, and saw no problem with it at the time. According to the Los Angeles Times, he conducted research on dogs' arteries in a laboratory at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, during or after which the dogs were killed. Political activism Inspired by his now (2008) ex-wife Pamelyn Ferdin, who was a president of Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty in the U.S., Vlasak became active in promoting animal rights in 1993. He became a spokesperson for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, although he is no longer a member, and was a board member of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. His principal role in the animal liberation movement is as a liaison between the movement and the public, publicizing the movement's \\"underground\\" activities in his role as a press officer. He acknowledges his medical background provides a \\"certain amount of credibility\\" to the movement.Range McDonald, Patrick, Monkey madness at UCLA , LA Weekly, August 8, 2007. In 2005, Dr. Vlasak spoke at length to the Committee on Environment and Public Works's investigation into Eco-terrorism. In his summation, Dr. Vlasak said: =Sea Shepherd activism= Vlasak has been active in opposing the seal hunt in Canada, which occurs every year, mostly in March and April. He was punched in the face by sealers during the 2005 hunt on Prince Edward Island, which he attended on behalf of the Sea Shepherd Conversation Society. No charges were brought in connection with the attack.\\"Crew attacked and arrested\\" , Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, March 31, 2005, retrieved January 17, 2008. Vlasak was Sea Shepherd's treasurer for many years. During the same hunt, he was one of 11 activists convicted of violating Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans regulations, because they watched the hunt without a permit. He was sentenced to 22 days in prison, which he served in a Prince Edward Island jail in 2006.Jerry Vlasak Seeks Permission to Enter Canada to Serve His Jail Sentence , Animal Friends Croatia, retrieved January 17, 2008. =Conviction= Vlasak was convicted in Los Angeles in 2006 of \\"targeted protesting\\" for demonstrating against euthanasia at animal shelters outside the home of a Department of Animal Services employee. He was sentenced to 30 days' electronic monitoring. He has appealed the decision.Gordon, Larry. \\"Animal rights group says it flooded house,\\" Los Angeles Times, October 30, 2007. Views on violence Vlasak has been criticized for appearing to legitimize the use of violence against animal researchers. He told an animal rights conference in 2003: Following the August 2, 2008 firebombing of a house belonging to University of California Santa Cruz animal researchers, Vlasak was quoted as saying \\"This guy knows what he is doing. He knows that every day that he goes into the laboratory and hurts animals that it is unreasonable not to expect consequences.\\" In response to a restraining order obtained by UCLA in 2006, Vlasak was quoted as saying \\"It's laughable that someone willing to face a 30-year sentence for arson will be put off by a restraining order. It's not going to have any effect.\\" Newsweek reported \\"The ALF Press Office's Vlasak say that the plan will be ineffective, in part because it circumscribes the actions of only five above-ground protesters. 'There [are] 150 more who remain' that can say and do what they want, Vlasak says.\\" =Interview with The Observer= The controversy continued in July 2004 when Jamie Doward of The Observer wrote that Vlasak had told him during an interview: \\"I think violence is part of the struggle against oppression. If something bad happens to these people [animal researchers], it will discourage others. It is inevitable that violence will be used in the struggle and that it will be effective.\\"Doward, Jamie. \\"Kill scientists, says animal rights chief\\" , The Observer, July 25, 2004. Vlasak responded in a press release that the allegations were part of a smear campaign against him. He wrote: \\"I was outraged by Jamie Doward's article in the Observer stating that I, a medical doctor who spends my entire life SAVING lives, is calling for or encouraging the assassination or killing of any being, human or non human.\\" He continued: > People have been killed over absolutely ridiculous things like oil, power > and money. It would be \\"speciesist\\" of me to say that in a battle for the > moral and ethical high ground ... that there will never be casualties. I'm > not encouraging or calling for this, I am simply stating that the animal > rights movement is and has been the most peaceful and restrained movement > the world has ever known considering the amount of terror, abuse and murder > done to innocent animals for greed and profit.

He told the BBC's Today program: \\"I am personally not advocating, condoning or recommending that anybody be killed. I am a physician who saves lives. I spend my entire day saving people's lives. All I am saying, in a historical context, violence has been used against us as animal rights campaigners and against the animals and is no different from us using violence on the other side.\\"Today, interview with Jerry Vlasak, BBC Radio 4, July 26, 2004, cited in Best, Steven. \\"Who's Afraid of Jerry Vlasak?\\" Animal Liberation Press Office, undated, retrieved January 17, 2008.

It is a modification of the aldol condensation.Jones, G. Org. React. 1967, 15. A Knoevenagel condensation is a nucleophilic addition of an active hydrogen compound to a carbonyl group followed by a dehydration reaction in which a molecule of water is eliminated (hence condensation). The product is often an Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ketone (a conjugated enone). General Knoevenagel layout In this reaction the carbonyl group is an aldehyde or a ketone. The catalyst is usually a weakly basic amine. The active hydrogen component has the form * Z‚ÄìCH2-Z or Z‚ÄìCHR‚ÄìZ for instance diethyl malonate, Meldrum's acid, ethyl acetoacetate or malonic acid, or cyanoacetic acid. * Z‚ÄìCHR1R2 for instance nitromethane. where Z is an electron withdrawing functional group. Z must be powerful enough to facilitate deprotonation to the enolate ion even with a mild base. Using a strong base in this reaction would induce self-condensation of the aldehyde or ketone. The Hantzsch pyridine synthesis, the Gewald reaction and the Feist‚ÄìBenary furan synthesis all contain a Knoevenagel reaction step. The reaction also led to the discovery of CS gas. Doebner modification The Doebner modification of the Knoevenagel condensation. Acrolein and malonic acid react in pyridine to give trans-2,4-pentadienoic acid with the loss of carbon dioxide. With malonic compounds the reaction product can lose a molecule of carbon dioxide in a subsequent step. In the so-called Doebner modification the base is pyridine. For example, the reaction product of acrolein and malonic acid in pyridine is trans-2,4-Pentadienoic acid with one carboxylic acid group and not two.  Scope  A Knoevenagel condensation is demonstrated in the reaction of 2-methoxybenzaldehyde 1 with the thiobarbituric acid 2 in ethanol using piperidine as a base.1,3-Diethyl-5-(2-methoxybenzylidene)-2-thioxodihydropyrimidine-4,6(1H,5H)-dione Abdullah Mohamed Asiria, Khaled Ahmed Alamrya Abraham F.

The single was both the second from their landmark Cloud Nine LP, and the second of their \\"psychedelic soul\\" tracks penned by Whitfield and former Motown artist Barrett Strong. Featuring all five Temptations - Dennis Edwards, Eddie Kendricks, Paul Williams, Melvin Franklin, and Otis Williams - trading verses and harmony lines, \\"Runaway Child, Running Wild\\" paints a tale of a young boy (presumably a preteen) who runs away from home after being punished for playing hooky i.e. absence from school without permission. The boy wanders the dark streets alone, eventually realizing he cannot survive on his own, but cannot find his way home, and ends up lost, frightened by strangers, unfamiliar landmarks, and his own thoughts. \\"Runaway child runnin' wild,\\" the Temptations tell the boy during the chorus, \\"you better go back home/where you belong\\". The Temptations alternately express and depict his fears, with the tension of the record building to a climax over the first five minutes of the record. At this point, the vocals fade out, and the record briefly gives voice to its young protagonist, who cries desperately for his mother before fading into the mix. \\"Runaway Child\\" then segues into an extended instrumental passage, during which Earl Van Dyke's Hammond organ, Joe Messina's electric guitar, and Dennis Coffey's distorted wah-wah pedal guitar take center stage for four minutes. After the instrumental builds the song up to a second climax, the track is stripped to the bassline and repeating hi-hat figure, and The Temptations return to the mix to issue one final admonition to the runaway: \\"Listen to your heart beat/it's beating much too fast/go back home/where you belong\\".

It is located at the junction of the R194 and R164 regional roads north of Kells, near the border with County Cavan. It was part of the Kells Poor Law Union. The Borora river flows through the village. Its population in 2011 was 116 people. Tidy Towns Winner 2006 Origins of the name According to the Annals of the Four Masters, the name M√°gh nEalta was introduced into Ireland about 2000 BC when Partholon, a Greek, gave that name to a treeless fertile plain in Dublin. Because the description also described its location, the area now known as Moynalty got the name also. The name was initially used to describe the manorial lands and settlement in the area. The Synod of Kells in 1152 restructured Catholicism on Ireland, replacing a monastic system of directing the Irish Church with a system of parishes, dioceses and archdioceses. As the old manorial village had embraced the name of the surrounding plain, the new parish assumed that name also. Moynalty in 2006 Current village The village was built by the grandson of James Farrell who purchased the lands of Moynalty and its hinterland in 1790. That grandson John Arthur completed the building of Moynalty Village in 1837 and it is to some extent based on a Swiss design. The village was built on one side only earning it the saying \\"All To One Side Like The Village Of Moynalty\\". It was only after 1900 that houses were built on the river side of the village. The Donore Hoard of bronze artifacts, a bronze chain, plates, and a door knocker, decorated in an 8th- century style, were discovered in the townland of Donore, Moynalty during an excavation in 1984. The items have been housed in the National Museum of Ireland since June 1985. There was a small lace-making industry in Moynalty. This lace making industry supplied Lace to the wife of King George at Buckingham Palace in London. The village has become a familiar face in the national Tidy Towns competition. Moynalty was awarded with the title of Best Kept Town in All of Ireland in 2011. The village also hosts the Moynalty Steam Threshing festival, held every August since 1975.http://www.moynaltysteamthreshing.ie/index.php/component/content/article/17-threshingnews Transport Bus √âireann route 108 provides three journeys a day (one on Sundays) to Kells and three journeys a day (one on Sundays) to Bailieborough in County Cavan via Mullagh Onward connections to Dublin and Dublin Airport are available at Kells.

He serves as Vice President of Research Oncology at Genentech in South San Francisco, California. Research Mellman's work has examined the role of endocytosis in cell metabolism and human disease. He was among the first to characterize the endosomal system. Later projects include investigation of LDL cholesterol receptor internalization, cellular sorting machinery, and the cellular basis for immunity. He is an authority on the cell biological mechanisms and function of dendritic cells, the cell type responsible for initiating the immune response, an interest that dates back to his postdoctoral period at Rockefeller University in the lab of Ralph Steinman, who won the Nobel Prize in 2011 for his discovery of dendritic cells. Early life and education Mellman grew up in New York, where he lived until he enrolled at Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio. While in college he maintained an interest in music but focused on the rapidly expanding field of cell biology. Working with David Miller, he began to study Chlamydomonas and found that a significant amount of the cell wall consisted of extensin. After leaving Oberlin, he enrolled in the graduate program at the University of California, Berkeley, but later transferred to Yale University to switch to research more applicable to people. At Yale, he studied the genetics behind vitamin B12 metabolism under the guidance of geneticist Leon Rosenberg. He became interested in endocytosis and did a postdoc with Ralph Steinman and Zanvil A. Cohn at Rockefeller University and started characterizing endosomes.

It is a small (about 160 g) alpine lagomorph that lives in boulder fields of central and southern Alaska (U.S.), and in parts of Canada, including northern British Columbia, Yukon, and western parts of the Northwest Territories. It is closely related to the American pika (O. princeps), but it is a monotypic form containing no recognized subspecies. It is asocial, does not hibernate, and spends a large part of its time in the summer collecting vegetation that is stored under rocks (\\"haypiles\\") as a supply of food for the winter. Some individuals have been observed collecting and consuming dead birds as sources of fat and protein. Thousands of trips are made during July and August to collect vegetation for winter. Description =Appearance= The appearance of collared pikas is similar to other members of the genus Ochotona. On the dorsal side of their bodies, they have dull grayish fur with gray patches on their shoulders and nape creating a distinguishable collar,MacDonald, Stephen O. and Jones, Clyde. 1987. ‚ÄúMammalian Species: Ochotona collaris.‚Äù https://www.jstor.org/stable/3503971 while on the ventral side they have an opaque white-colored fur.Leininger, C. 2009. \\"Ochotona collaris\\" (On-line), Animal Diversity Web. Accessed October 03, 2014 at http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Ochotona_collaris/ Their winter pelts are similar to O. princeps, but during the other seasons, O. collaris' fur is a darker gray and is less thick than in the winter; consequently, they only have one annual molt. During the summer, young that resemble the size of an adult are fully gray, while actual adults have brown stains around their heads or necks. Some features that are helpful in identifying O. collaris from O. princeps are the creamy-colored fur over the facial gland, which is brown in O. princeps; and in addition, the skull size of O. collaris is broader with a shorter nasal area, a greater tympanic bullae, and different teeth morphology than those of O. princeps. =Characteristics= They are petite in size with longer hind limbs than their fore limbs, with their hind limbs being about 2.9 to 3.1 cm. They have five digits on each front foot and only four on each hind foot. The soles of their feet are covered with long fur, while still exposing their digital pads on the soles of their feet and their curved claws. They range between 130 and 200 g in body mass and 17.8 to 19.8 cm in length. For both male and females, the average weight is around 157 g, with maximum growth rates increasing moving toward the northern parts of collared pika territories. They have constricted, flat skulls with no supraorbital processes, slender zygomatic arches, and 26 teeth. While some mammals have reduced clavicles for more range of motion, the collared pika has a well-developed clavicle supporting the scapula. They do not have a pubic symphysis therefore it does not have a pubic arch within its pelvic girdle. In addition, an interesting characteristic about the male collared pika is that it has no scrotum and the location of its testes is not visibly apparent. This indicates no sexual dimorphism; consequently, one must examine the pseudocloaca for evidence of specific genitalia to distinguish the sex of the collared pika. Distribution and habitat/ecology =Geographic distribution= O. collaris is distributed over a wide range of terrain that encompasses the west side of the Northwest Territories, almost all of the Yukon Territory, northern British Columbia, and the central and southern parts of Alaska. Around 60% of collared pikas are found in regions of Canada, with most of them being in Yukon.Kukka, Piia M., McCulley, Alice, Suitor, Mike, Eckert, Cameron D. and Jung, Thomas S.. 2014. ‚ÄúCOLLARED PIKA (OCHOTONA COLLARIS) OCCUPANCY IN TOMBSTONE TERRITORIAL PARK, YUKON.‚Äù http://www.env.gov.yk.ca/publications- maps/documents/PikaSurveyReport2013.pdf More specifically, in Alaska, they occur most frequently in ranges around the Yukon-Tanana uplands and Chigmit Mountains, to the head of Lynn Canal near Skagway; in Canada, they occur from Richardson Mountains, south into northwestern British Columbia and west close to the Mackenzie River of the Northwest Territories. Of the 30 existing species of pika, only two inhabit North America, O. collaris and O. princeps. In relation to the location of distribution of the American pika, O. collaris is located farther north of those regions and is separated by 800 km. This gap encompasses both British Columbia and Alberta, Canada. =Fossil history= In central Alaska, within the Pleistocene deposits, preserved specimens of collared pika were found along with some dung pellets; in addition to central Alaska, the Yukon territory also contained some fossilized specimens. The studies of the size variation of the fossils showed that the morphology of Pleistocene pikas was flexible with the alteration of environments from early to middle Pleistocene in both Alaska and Yukon. In 1973, during the isolation of the Wisconsin glaciation, O. collaris may have become its own species separate from O. princeps. =Habitat and ecology= A collared pika in Hatcher Pass, Alaska Collared pika colonies are mainly found in the mountain regions and they typically inhabit rock slides near areas of vegetation and fields of meadows. Due to these talus sites, the species‚Äô range distribution is broken into several condensed areas. Their homes have a range of about 30 m in diameter with caches and dens distancing from 30 to 70 m. The way organisms respond to climate change can be a distinct and peculiar characteristic, so patterns between closely related species, such as the collared pika and the American pika, are important. Collared pikas, like most other pikas, choose to live around rock slides to use the rocks as protection against the high temperatures they must endure throughout the day; they are referred to as cold-adapted lagomorphs. Behavior Collared pikas are diurnal herbivores and spend time foraging through vegetation during the summer. This species is known as an ecotone species for the way that it keeps its shelter and food storage separate from each other. This process of gathering and foraging for vegetation to add to their caches is referred to as ‚Äúhaying‚Äù, which is what they spend most of the day doing. They spend no time burrowing because they use their talus sites for protection and habitation. They are most active during the morning and late afternoon. Each individual within this species preserves its own territory and its own vegetation cache or haypile, and defends it with full force. Therefore, the collared pika is seen as an asocial species and prefers solitude. During the cold winters, the collared pika does not hibernate, but instead stays active, counting on its food sources for energy and survival, and uses the snowpack as a means of insulation. The distance in which the collared pika ventures out to forage is highly dependent on level of predation risk.Morrison, Shawn, Barton, Luc, Caputra, Peter, Hik, David S.. 2004. ‚ÄúForage selection by collared pikas, Ochotona collaris, under varying degrees of predation risk.‚Äù http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/z04-024#.VDKy1SldX1s When gathering food, pika rarely travels more than 10 m away from its talus site. Gathering begins to take place around the end of June or beginning of July and increases at a constant rate as time progresses. Collared pikas tend to have multiple haystacks of vegetation throughout their home range and often dwell in the same site annually. However, although it has multiple haystacks, it mainly focuses on one while the others are much smaller and localized caches. As observed, collared pikas are likely to use whatever is near the rockslides, such as leaves, flowering plants, berries, or anything else they can find to add to their food caches; even feces of other animals have been found within the haystacks of collared pikas. The food caches have been seen to be similar to the size of location of storage. This species is often kleptoparasitic and takes food from others. During their rest periods, collared pikas have been found to sit on rocks and expose themselves to the sunlight.Kays, Roland W., Wilson, Don E.. ‚Äú 2009. Mammals of North America: (Second Edition).‚Äù Princeton University Press. (Pg. 36) https://books.google.com/books?id=YjIIRZwbWIEC&printsec;=copyright&source;=gbs_pub_info_r#v=onepage&q;&f;=false Reproduction Collared pikas generally mate with their nearest neighbors and are believed to be facultatively monogamous, but they have also been predicted to participate in polygynandry and reproduce with multiple partners, because males often travel to territories of several females during the spring before mating season begins. The males receive the females around the end of spring. However, the pinnacle of the mating season arises in May and early June. Collared pikas, both male and female, are reproductively developed at one year of age and give birth to two or three young each year in their nests within the talus. They typically produce one litter per year, but may produce two litters without successful weaning. Although both can reproduce at one year of age, the male‚Äôs reproductive success is reliant on acquiring habitat and drawing females. The female is the one that yields the most parental investment and is burdened by energetic constraints during gestation and lactation. Sexual dimorphism makes perceiving how much the male invests in nurturing the young difficult. The female‚Äôs gestation period lasts about 30 days and produces a litter of blind and almost hairless offspring. The young remain in the nest around 30 days before they are weaned and emerge to the surface. Juveniles remain on the natal territory for only a short time (a few days) before they become independent and disperse to find their own territories. Juvenile pikas can achieve the size of an adult around 40 to 50 days. Parturition timing for northern alpine herbivores is vital due to the brief snow-free timeframe and lack of food sources. The parturition time of most collared pikas is often synchronous in terms of breeding, however there has been a study that has identified some correlation between variation in initiating the first litter and the variation of timing of the snowmelt. Upon finding some asynchronous breeding among pikas, due to not being able to predict snowmelt, this type of breeding could ensure some success in breeding. Communication Collared pikas are a fairly vocal species. Not much is known about the vocalization of collared pikas, but many studies on the American pika indicate a function of both a defensive mechanism and a warning signal against predators. As a collared pika prepares to call, it sits with a hunched back and points its nose upward. Collared pika calls sound like a recurring single sharp note with each series varying in loudness and is similar to the American pika‚Äôs short call. When interacting on a territory, collared pikas use a softer call than their normal vocalizations. Both males and females can emit vocalizations from some sort of fixed position within their home ranges, especially during the period of gathering. This territorial call informs neighboring collared pikas of haypile possession. Adult males specifically have their own call that sounds like a strong series of ‚Äúkie‚Äù calls and clicking during mating season. Population and conservation status The collared pika within the talus sites where it resides and stores up food caches The estimated population density is roughly around 6.4 to 7.2 individuals per hectare. In various regions of the Yukon, the range is around one to four pikas per hectare. Both collared pikas and American pikas are commonly believed to be philopatric species. In addition, research data have shown that young collared pikas rarely disperse over 300 m away from their original den, and adults hardly ever leave an established territory. No population trend is known, but the population of collared pikas has experienced a decline since 1995 in the Yukon area, and is proposed to have a higher probability of extinction within that specific area in 10 to 15 years. Due to collared pikas being a cold-adapted species, their resilience to climate change is limited, so they have a high risk of extirpation of any populations found at lower altitudes and lower in latitude. Consequently, collared pikas have been recognized as an indicator species for the effect of climate change on alpine ecosystems. =Lifespan= The lifespan of O. collaris can be up to 7 years in the wild. The mortality rate is high during winter and they have suffered from a continuous reduction of population over time. The struggle to survive the winters and the fast-rate climate variations have affected their growing season and availability of resources, especially from the negative impact of not having snowpacks to keep them insulated or to keep their food and shelters hidden from predators. =Predation= Collared pikas are defenseless against predators and can only hide within cracks or crevices in the mountainous areas where they live; the rocks of the terrain are their only shelter. One of the main predators of the collared pika found in south-central Alaska is the ermine, but also include martens, weasels, foxes, eagles, coyotes, and other various birds. Collared pikas have also been found to be the victims of parasitism to fleas and parasitic helminthes such as Sarcocystis species, which have been found in their striated muscles. =Conservation risk= O. collaris has been classified as of least concern for conservation status according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, yet as said by the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada, as a result of collared pikas inhabiting areas with fast climate changes and their sensitivity to climatic variation, they are considered of special concern. Currently, no actions are being taken to preserve this species, and no threats have been acknowledged against this species. Nevertheless, the collared pika may be susceptible to the negative effects of climate change, and some investigation should be instigated to monitor the negative effects of the new unlimited, year-round hunting rules that allow for the hunting of collared pikas.

It is celebrated in honour of Haile Selassie's 1966 visit to Jamaica. Visit of Selassie to Jamaica Haile Selassie had already met with several Rasta elders in Addis Ababa, and had allowed Rastafari and other people of African descent to settle on his personal land in Shashamane. Haile Selassie visited Jamaica on Thursday, April 21, 1966. Some 100,000 Rastafari from all over Jamaica descended on Palisadoes Airport in Kingston,Dread, The Rastafarians of Jamaica, by Joseph Owens ISBN having heard that the man whom they considered to be God was coming to visit them. They waited at the airport playing drums and smoking large quantities of marijuana. Today the Rastafari celebrate that Haile Selassie visited Jamaica on . When Haile Selassie's Ethiopian Airlines flight landed at the airport at , the crowd surrounded his plane on the tarmac. The day had been overcast and stormy. After about half an hour, the door swung open and the emperor appeared at the top of the mobile steps. A deafening tumult was heard from the crowd, who beat calabash drums, lit firecrackers, waved signs, and sounded Abeng horns of the Maroons. All protocol was dropped as the crowd pressed past the security forces and onto the red carpet that had been laid out for the reception. Selassie waved from the top of the steps; some interpreters have claimed that he shed tears, although this is disputed. He then returned into the plane, disappearing for several more minutes. Finally Jamaican authorities were obliged to request Ras Mortimer Planno, a well-known Rasta leader, to climb the steps, enter the plane, and negotiate the Emperor's descent.Catch a Fire: The Life of Bob Marley by Timothy White p. 15, 210, 211. When Planno reemerged, he announced to the crowd: \\"The Emperor has instructed me to tell you to be calm. Step back and let the Emperor land\\"Black Heretics, Black Prophets: Radical Political Intellectuals p. 189 by Anthony Bogues After Planno escorted the African monarch down the steps, journalists were puzzled by Selassie's refusal to walk on the red carpet on the way to his limousine (hence grounation, Iyaric equivalent of foundation, \\"uplifted\\" with the sound of the word ground in the sense of \\"making contact with the soil\\"). He was then driven to the King's House, the residence of Governor-General Clifford Campbell.White, p. 211. As a result of Planno's actions, the Jamaican authorities were asked to ensure that Rastafari representatives were present at all state functions attended by His Majesty,Rastafari: From Outcasts to Culture Bearers Page 86 by Ennis Barrington EdmondsVerbal Riddim: The Politics and Aesthetics of African-Caribbean Dub Poetry, page 83 by Christian Habekost and Rastafari elders, including Planno and probably Joseph Hibbert, also obtained a private audience with the Emperor,Edmonds, p. 86 where he reportedly told them that they should not immigrate to Ethiopia until they had first liberated the people of Jamaica. This dictum came to be known as \\"liberation before repatriation\\". At a dinner held at the King's House, Rastas claimed that acting Jamaican Prime Minister Donald Sangster had stamped his foot at Lulu, Haile Selassie's pet chihuahua, who, they swore, had responded with the roar of a lion.White, p. 211 Defying expectations of the Jamaican authorities,Reggae Routes: The Story of Jamaican Music by Kevin O'Brien, p. 243. Selassie never rebuked the Rastafari for their belief in him as the Messiah. Instead, he presented the movement's faithful elders with gold medallions bearing the Ethiopian seal ‚Äì the only recipients of such an honour on this visit.\\"African Crossroads ‚Äì Spiritual Kinsmen\\" Dr. Ikael Tafari, The Daily Nation, Dec. Meanwhile, he presented some of the Jamaican politicians, including Sangster, with miniature coffin-shaped cigarette boxes.  Impact  Rita Marley, Bob Marley's wife, converted to the Rastafari faith after seeing Haile Selassie in his motorcade en route to the King's House. She claimed, in interviews and in her book No Woman No Cry, that she had seen a stigma on Haile Selassie's hand as he waved to the crowd, and was instantly convinced of his divinity.No Woman, No Cry, Rita Marley, p. 43. For years afterward, Planno, who became a spiritual guru of Bob Marley, would give out enlarged photographs of himself with the Emperor on the steps of the aeroplane.Before the Legend: The Rise of Bob Marley ‚Äì p. 145 by Christopher John Farley The great significance of this event in the development of the Rastafari religion is that, having been outcasts in society, its adherents gained a measure of respectability for the first time.This Is Reggae Music: The Story of Jamaica's Music ‚Äì p. 193 by Lloyd BradleyEdmonds, p. 86.Habekost, p. 83. With Rasta having become acceptable, reggae music became commercially viable, leading in turn to the further global spread of Rastafarianism. Haile Selassie is thought to have encouraged the Rastafari elders to learn about the Ethiopian Orthodox faith while in Jamaica, and in 1970, he dispatched Archbishop Laike Mandefro to establish a mission in Jamaica. Mandefro was formally invited by Joseph Hibbert, one of the original founders of the Rastafari Movement, to teach the Rasta community, and in 1971 Mandefro named Hibbert as a \\"Spiritual Organizer\\". During this time, Mandefro pointedly refused calls to demand that the Rastafari renounce their faith in Haile Selassie's divinity, and some 2,000 Rastas accordingly received Orthodox baptisms.Barry Chevannes, \\"The Apotheosis of Rastafari Heroes\\", in Religion, Diaspora and Cultural Identity by John W. Pulis, p. 345. Because of Haile Selassie's visit, April 21 is celebrated as Grounation Day. The \\"Abu Ye! Abu Ye Abu ye! Abu ye!\\" chant is an element of Grounation Day festivities.

In some ninja clans it was known as the , or \\"seven ways of going\\" (one form of ninjutsu that has a person play a role much like an actor does in impersonating people). A ninja had to appear either as a priest, samurai, merchant, craftsman, performer, puppeteer, or farmer. To accomplish this, the ninja was a well studied sociologist, observing people in other towns for long periods of time until, just like actors, ninjas could blend into the crowd. They acted like either one of the major social classes to spy on people. Ninja thus sometimes carried one or two costumes to look like the other classes and kunoichi were specialists at Hensojutsu due to the importance of close contact missions. It also included the art of camouflage, such as mesh covered with leaves, grass, mud, bark etc. It is heavily reliant upon shadows and form manipulation..such as crouching to resemble a rock, twisting to match a bush, and also includes various ways one can \\"meld\\" into foliage to virtually disappear. This is different from other methods in that the ninja needs only to appear like someone else for a short period of time. Ninja typically must learn the character traits of another class quickly and then impersonate the members of that class. For instance, if workers were walking in large numbers toward a worksite, using this skill the ninja observes the worker, copies the same clothing and walking style of the workers, then follows the crowd in just like the other workers. A good ninja ought to be able to impersonate anybody in terms of appearance.

Ballintra lies on the northern bank of the Blackwater river. (The river is sometimes referred to as Ballintra River). The river rises in the hills that lie inland from the town, and flows through a number of small lakes before spilling over a small waterfall in a gorge behind the village. The Irish meaning of Ballintra Baile an tSratha, means town by the low-lying land along a river, the village is situated close to Rossnowlagh and Murvagh beaches. The village is situated in a limestone area, and there are a number of quarries in the area. History =Built heritage= Evidence of prehistoric settlement in the area include a number of ringforts (for example in nearby Moneymore townland) and a megalithic wedge tomb (in Ballymagrorty townland). Much of the village itself was laid-out in the late 18th and early 19th century, with the town's bridges dating from the 1780s and 1790s, and Ballintra's Anglican, Catholic and Methodist churches dating to 1795, 1845 and 1896 respectively. =Irish language decline= The 1911 census records only a handful of people in Ballintra who were Irish speakers. In his paper \\"Irish Speaking in the Pre- famine Period\\", Dr. Garret Fitzgerald remarks that \\"near Ballintra the language seems to have disappeared by the time of the Famine. Around Ballyshannon it also seems to have been almost extinct\\". As late as 1960, up to a few dozen native Irish speakers remained in Tamhnach a' Mhullaigh (known in English as Townawilly or Tawnawully). The Irish scholar and campaigner M√°irt√≠n √ì Cadhain visited the area in 1957 to record folklore stores in Irish from a family in the area. =Developments= The 2016 census indicates that approximately 35% of homes in Ballintra were built in the early 20th century or prior, with a further peak in building (20% of homes) built in the 1970s. The latter includes a number of social housing units built by Donegal County Council in the 1970s. Other developments include a bypass road built in the early 1980s. In the 20 years between the 1996 and the 2016 census, the population of the village decreased by 12%, from 217 to 191 residents. Amenities Ballintra Church of Ireland Ballintra Roman Catholic church Ballintra has one public house, a grocery store, a takeaway, a hairdresser, two primary schools (St. Ernan's NS and The Robertson NS), and three churches (Methodist, Church of Ireland, and Roman Catholic).

On her entry to parliament in 2005, a newspaper claimed that she might have the \\"most varied CV of any newcomer to Parliament\\", including extensive travels, and work as an extra in India in Bollywood movies and as an administrative research assistant to the Tower of London's master of armouries.\\"New MPs: Darien Fenton\\", Kevin Taylor, 24 September 2005, The New Zealand Herald In 2014 she admitted that her varied experiences in the 1970s had also left her with a heroin addiction, and that the New Zealand health- funded methadone programme '\\"...saved my life\\"'.\\"Darien Fenton: 'It's a miracle I survived\\", 9 February 2014, The New Zealand Herald Before entering parliament she was active in the trade union movement, and held the offices of National Secretary of the Service & Food Workers Union Nga Ringa Tota (SFWU), and vice-president of the Council of Trade Unions. She is also the Vice- President of the Labour Party Union Affiliates Council. Member of Parliament Fenton stood as a list candidate for the Labour Party in the 2005 election, being ranked 43rd, and was elected to Parliament. In 2006, her Minimum Wage and Remuneration Amendment Bill, which extended the minimum wage to contractors, was drawn from the member's ballot. The bill was sent to select committee, but the committee could not reach agreement on whether it should be passed. It was subsequently voted down by the National coalition government after the 2008 election. In the 2008 election she stood unsuccessfully against National Party leader John Key in Helensville. Due to her place of 33 on the Labour list, she was returned to parliament. In 2009 Fenton's Employment Relations (Statutory Minimum Redundancy Entitlements) Amendment Bill was drawn from the member's ballot. It was defeated at its first reading in May 2010. In 2011, Fenton received public backlash when she commented on Sir Peter Leitch (known as The Mad Butcher for his chain of butchery shops) after he publicly stated he supported Prime Minister John Key. Fenton stated she would \\"never go near him again\\" and would refuse to buy anything from his stores. Fenton later apologised for her comments on the Labour Party blog. In 2012, Fenton backed a bill that would have stopped libraries from charging for access to material and the internet. It failed at its first reading 61‚Äì60. In May 2014, Fenton announced she would not stand for re-election at the . Since leaving Parliament Fenton has returned to Union activism currently working as National Campaign Director for the Meat Workers Union. In this role she has been campaigning for key changes in workplace safety legislation before Parliament putting greater responsibility on workplace management to ensure injured and ill employees can get access to medical treatment.

It was later also used in ceramics.  History  The earliest cong were produced by the Liangzhu culture (3400-2250 BC); later examples date mainly from the Shang and Zhou dynasties. Interest in the jade shape developed during the 12th-13th century Song dynasty. The shape continued to be used in ceramic and metalwork for centuries.BBC TV documentary: China in Six Easy Pieces (2013) presented by Lars Tharp http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b036r5cx  Description  In form, a cong is a straight tube with a circular bore and square outer section with more or less convex sides. The outer surface is divided vertically or horizontally such that the whole defines a hollow cylinder embedded in a partial rectangular block. Proportions vary - a cong may be squat or taller than it is wide. The outer faces are sometimes decorated with mask-like faces, which may be related to the taotie designs found on later bronze vessels. Although generally considered to be a ritual object of some sort, the original function and meaning of the cong are unknown. Later writings speak of the cong as symbolizing the earth, while the bi represents the heavens. The square represents the earth and a circle represents the heavens.

Primarily a right fielder and center fielder, Bell batted from the right side and threw with his right hand. He is 6'2\\" tall, and during his playing career, he weighed 215 pounds. Amateur and minor league career Bell is one of only eleven players to play in both the Little League World Series and the Major League World Series. In 1980 and 1981 Bell played for Belmont Heights Little League in Tampa, Florida, winning the US championship and losing to Taiwan in the world championship game both years. (Bell is also the only player to appear in the LLWS twice and later in the big-league World Series.) When he reached C. Leon King High School in Tampa, Bell attracted the attention of the Toronto Blue Jays. Toronto selected him in the second round of the 1987 June draft, with the 49th overall pick. Bell signed with Toronto, and made his debut that same year in the New York‚ÄìPenn League. He emerged as a top prospect with the Myrtle Beach Blue Jays the next year, when he was named to the South Atlantic League All-Star team. Bell's .344 batting average earned him the league batting title, and he also displayed substantial power, hitting 29 doubles, five triples, and 12 home runs in only 352 at bats. His success helped him earn a late-season promotion to class AA. Although he continued to advance, Bell struggled for the next two seasons, batting .242 at AA in 1989 and .261 at AAA the next year, but drawing walks at an extremely low rate. Despite being younger than most players in those leagues, he re-emerged as a top prospect in , repeating AAA with the Syracuse Chiefs. That year, Bell batted .346 with 22 doubles, 12 triples, 13 home runs, 57 walks, and 29 stolen bases. Bell made the International League All-Star team and won the International League Most Valuable Player award, and Baseball America magazine named him the Minor League Player of the Year. Major league career =Toronto= Bell made his Major League debut on June 28, 1991, starting in left field in a 3-1 loss to the Seattle Mariners.06/28/91 Box Score, Retrosheet.org Bell was slated to be the Jays' starting left fielder in 1992, but broke his wrist in the second game of the year and ultimately appeared in only 61 games that year as the Blue Jays' fourth outfielder.https://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-22/sports/sp-4226_1_blue-jays Toronto won its division that year and advanced to the World Series, defeating the Atlanta Braves in six games to capture its first championship. On Fan Appreciation Day in , the team played a trick on Bell. During a break between innings, they announced that a vehicle would be given to a lucky fan, and then outfielder Joe Carter (accompanied by Dave Winfield) drove Bell's green Ford Explorer out onto the field.Wangrin, Mark. \\"Fool born every minute in MLB \\", the San Antonio Express-News, published June 13, 2006, accessed December 8, 2007. =San Diego= Shortly before the beginning of the season, the Blue Jays traded Bell and Stoney Briggs to the San Diego Padres, in exchange for veteran outfielder Darrin Jackson. It was in San Diego where Bell first established himself as an everyday player. He was still somewhat unrefined as a player, batting .262 and striking out more than five times as often as he walked in , but he also displayed a good base of pure skills by hitting 21 home runs and stealing 26 bases. Bell improved his batting average to .311 in 1994, despite off-the-field distractions. On April 25, Bell and pitcher Scott Sanders were arrested in New York City before a game against the New York Mets, as police claimed that the pair had offered undercover policewomen $20 in exchange for oral sex.\\"Mets acquire Hampton, Bell from Astros for Cedeno, Dotel\\", Associated Press, published December 24, 1999, accessed April 25, 2006 The charges were ultimately dropped on October 25.\\" SPORTS PEOPLE: BASEBALL; Padres Are Cleared\\", The New York Times, published October 25, 1994, accessed April 25, 2006. In December, Bell was part of a 12-player trade between the Padres and the Houston Astros. Along with Bell, the Padres sent Doug Brocail, Ricky Guti√©rrez, Pedro A. Mart√≠nez, Phil Plantier, and Craig Shipley to Houston, receiving in return Ken Caminiti, And√∫jar Cede√±o, Steve Finley, Roberto Petagine, Brian Williams, and Sean Fesh. =Houston= After Bell joined the Houston Astros, his last name, hitting skills and speed positioned him in Houston's vaunted lineup of \\"Killer B's\\", established by Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio. This group of players helped lead the franchise to a new level of success that included a string of playoff appearances and second- place finishes that commenced in the 1990s.\\"Chris Burke is the latest 'Killer B'\\", mlb.com, published October 14, 2005, accessed April 25, 2006. Bell went on to enjoy one of the finest seasons of his career in 1995, with a .334 batting average that was fourth-highest in the league. He drew consideration in the Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) voting, placing fourteenth place with 12 points. The team won three straight National League Central division championships from 1997‚àí99. Bell's year-to-year performance varied considerably, but he peaked in 1998. That season, he batted .314 with 41 doubles and 22 home runs, good for an OPS of .855 as the Astros won a franchise-record 102 games. After the Killer B's had gained national attention, journalist Dayn Perry cheerfully noted in 1999 that the Astros, \\"in pursuit of arcane history, used eight players whose last names began with 'B.'\\" including Bagwell, Paul Bako, Glen Barker, Bell, Sean Bergman, Lance Berkman, Biggio, and Tim Bogar. However, Bell's performance slipped substantially that year, and his .236 batting average and .656 OPS made him considered to be one of the worst everyday players in the league. He compounded the problem in an ill-timed confrontation with manager Larry Dierker on July 22. Dierker had returned to the field that day after having recovered from a near-fatal grand mal seizure during a game on June 13 and subsequent emergency brain surgery. Bell was upset that Dierker had moved him from second to sixth in the batting order, ranting after the game that \\"it's a slap in the face to be dropped to the sixth spot. I'm to the point now that I feel like I'm not wanted.\\"Dierker wins in return as Bell sounds off\\", Associated Press, published July 22, 1999, accessed April 25, 2004. Many Astros fans were upset that Bell had chosen to criticize Dierker on a day honoring him, and Dierker ultimately pulled Bell from the starting lineup later that season. At that point, the Astros viewed Bell as an expensive liability, and on December 23, they traded him and star pitcher Mike Hampton to the New York Mets for Roger Cede√±o, Octavio Dotel, and Kyle Kessel. When assembling this trade, the Astros let it be known that they would not trade Hampton unless a trade partner was willing to also take Bell in the deal. =New York= Bell was unfazed by the deal. When informed that he'd been traded to the Mets, he said, \\"Christmas came early for me. I'm very happy. I told my agent I'm going to run, I'm so excited.\\" With Bell as their starting right fielder, the Mets made the playoffs as the National League Wild Card. On August 22, Bell got the opportunity to pitch the eighth inning of a blowout against the Padres. His first pitch, which Bell described as an eephus pitch,\\"Derek Bell's \\"eephus\\" pitch \\", ESPN was clocked at 47 MPH, and he ultimately surrendered three hits and three walks, giving up four earned runs and one unearned run (resulting from an error by catcher Todd Pratt).\\"08/22/05 Box Score\\", Retrosheet.org Bell sprained his ankle during the first game of the NLDS, and missed the remainder of the playoffs. The Mets defeated the San Francisco Giants in the NLDS and the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS, but were defeated in five games by the New York Yankees in the World Series. Following the season, Bell's contract with the Mets expired and the team made no effort to retain his services. He later signed a two-year contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates in the offseason, following the World Series. =Pittsburgh= In spring training , Bell learned that he would have to compete for the Pirates' starting right field job. Despite hitting .173 the previous season‚Äìhis worst as a regular player‚ÄìBell did not feel that he needed to prove he was worthy of being a starter. On March 18, Bell told reporters: > Nobody told me I was in competition. If there is competition, somebody > better let me know. If there is competition, they better eliminate me out of > the race and go ahead and do what they're going to do with me. I ain't never > hit in spring training and I never will.

If it is [a competition], then I'm going > into 'Operation Shutdown.' Tell them exactly what I said. I haven't competed > for a job since 1991. Bell left the team on March 29, was released on March 31, and never played in the majors again. The Pirates ended up paying him $4.5 million not to play for them. Bell moved onto his yacht, Bell 14 (his name and uniform number), a 58-foot Sea Ray 580.Pearlman, Jeff. \\"Yo Ho Ho!\\", Sports Illustrated, May 22, 2000 New York Post writer Tom Keegan described the incident by calling Bell \\"the perfect Pirate given that he lives on a boat and steals money.\\" Alleged drug use On April 20, 2006, Derek Bell was charged with felony cocaine possession and possession of drug paraphernalia, after police found a warm crack pipe in the back seat of his car during a traffic stop.

Under the influence of signal detection theory, absolute threshold has been redefined as the level at which a stimulus will be detected a specified percentage (often 50%) of the time. The absolute threshold can be influenced by several different factors, such as the subject's motivations and expectations, cognitive processes, and whether the subject is adapted to the stimulus.Absolute Threshold.\\" Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology. 2001. Retrieved 14 July 2010 from Encyclopedia.comhttp://m.livescience.com/33895-human-eye.html The absolute threshold can be compared to the difference threshold, which is the measure of how different two stimuli must be for the subject to notice that they are not the same. Vision A landmark 1942 experiment by Hecht, Shlaer, and Pirenne assessed the absolute threshold for vision. They tried to measure the minimum number of photons the human eye can detect 60% of the time, using the following controls: * Dark adaptation ‚Äì the participants were completely dark adapted (a process lasting forty minutes) to optimise their visual sensitivity. * Location ‚Äì the stimulus was presented to the right eye to an area where there is a high density of rod cells, 20 degrees to the left of the point of focus (i.e., 20 degrees to the right of the fovea). Roughly this degree of eccentricity (about 20 degrees) has the highest rod density across the whole retina. However, the corresponding location on the right retina, 20 degrees to the left, is very near the blind spot. * Stimulus size ‚Äì the stimulus had a diameter of 10 minutes of arc (1 minute=1/60th of a degree). Although not explicitly mentioned in the original research paper, this ensured that the light stimulus fell only on rod cells connected to the same nerve fibre (this is called the area of spatial summation). * Wavelength ‚Äì the stimulus wavelength matched the maximum sensitivity of rod cells (510 nm). * Stimulus duration ‚Äì 0.001 second (1 ms). The researchers found that the emission of only 5-14 photons could elicit visual experience. However, only about half of these entered the retina, due to reflection (from the cornea), absorption, and other factors relating to transmittance of the ocular media. The researchers estimated that 5 to 14 of the estimated 500 rods in the test area would each absorb one photon, with a 4% chance that one rod would absorb two photons. A second absolute threshold for vision involves the minimum photon flux (photons per second per unit area). In this case the light covers a wide field over an extended period of time instead of being concentrated on one spot on the retina in a short burst. Knowing the pupil diameter and the wavelength of the light, the result can be described in terms of luminance (~0.000001 candela per square meter or 10‚àí6 cd/m2) or retinal illuminance (~0.00002 Trolands). By including estimates for the probability of an average photon being absorbed by an average rod cell, the threshold stimulation for the rods is approximately one photon absorption per second per 5000 rods. In terms of total absolute power sensitivity, Denton and Pirenne in the Journal of Physiology in 1954 found that for diffuse, extended sources i.e. a relatively large (~ 45-degree wide source, as viewed by the subject) frosted glass aperture, and a long (5 second) observation and decision time, the human eye could begin to reliably distinguish the lit from unlit glass at a power level of approximately 7.6 x 10‚àí14 watts / steradian-cm2 at the eye for green (510 nm) light. This power level was dependent on the wavelength of the light used according to the usual luminosity curve. For white light, the absolute sensitivity found was 5.9 x 10‚àí14 watts / steradian-cm2. This base sensitivity varied only about 0.03 log steps between monocular (one-eyed) or binocular (two eyed) vision. In 1972 Sakitt conducted an experiment that combined elements of signal detection and threshold theory. Two key elements of the study were a high tolerance for false positives and a multiple-choice option on deciding whether or not a light was seen. In the classic studies described above, the tolerance for false positives was so low that threshold was biased upward. Based on statistical analysis of a large number of trials, 6 photons each absorbed by one rod near-simultaneously looked \\"very bright,\\" 5 photons looked \\"bright,\\" 4 photons \\"a moderate light,\\" 3 photons \\"a dim light.\\" Two observers were able to see 2 photons as \\"slightly doubtful if a light was seen.\\" One observer saw a single photon as \\"very doubtful if a light was seen.\\" Zero photons were seen as \\"did not see anything.\\" Hearing The absolute threshold of hearing is the minimum sound level of a pure tone that an average ear with normal hearing can hear with no other sound present. The absolute threshold relates to the sound that can just be heard by the organism.Durrant J D., Lovrinic J H. 1984. Bases of Hearing Sciences. Second Edition. United States of America: Williams & WilkinsGelfand S A., 2004. Hearing an Introduction to Psychological and Physiological Acoustics. Fourth edition. United States of America: Marcel Dekker An example of this would be hearing a watch ticking twenty feet away from you in a quiet room. The threshold of hearing is generally reported as the RMS sound pressure of 20 ŒºPa (micropascals) = 2√ó10‚àí5 pascal (Pa). It is approximately the quietest sound a young human with undamaged hearing can detect at 1,000 Hz.Gelfand, S A., 1990. Hearing: An introduction to psychological and physiological acoustics. 2nd edition. New York and Basel: Marcel Dekker, Inc. The threshold of hearing is frequency dependent and it has been shown that the ear's sensitivity is best at frequencies between 1 kHz and 5 kHz. Humans typically have a lower hearing threshold for their own names. Dennis P. Carmody and Michael Lewis studied this phenomenon in 2006 and found that brain regions respond to the person's name differently than they do to a random name. Odor The odor detection threshold is the lowest concentration of a certain odor compound that is perceivable by the human sense of smell. The thresholds of a chemical compound is determined in part by its shape, polarity, partial charges and molecular mass. The olfactory mechanisms responsible for a compound's different detection threshold is not well understood, as such, these thresholds cannot yet be accurately predicted. Rather, they must be measured through extensive tests using human subjects in laboratory settings. Touch The absolute threshold for touch is a bee's wing dropping onto a person's cheek from one centimeter (.5 inches) away. Different parts of the body are more sensitive to touch, so this varies from one body part to the next (20). As people age, the absolute threshold for touch becomes larger, especially after age 65. In general, women have a lower absolute threshold and are more sensitive to touch than men. However, it also seems to vary from person to person. Even individuals experience long-term variation within their own absolute threshold for touch. This could potentially affect how sensory disorders are evaluated by medical professionals. In 1974, Ulf Lindblom studied how the speed of a stimulus affects absolute threshold. A WaveTek stimulator was used to measure absolute threshold of touch by \\"tapping\\" a participant's finger pad with a 2 mm diameter probe. Lindblom found that on average, there was a 27% difference in threshold level between slow and fast mechanical pulses on a participant's finger pad. The threshold for rapid pulses was 5 ¬µm, and 80 ¬µm for slow pulses. Lindblom's study shows that humans are more sensitive to fast stimulation than slow stimulation, at least for touch. Taste In 1999, J. A. Stillman, R. P. Morton, and D. Goldsmith performed a study testing absolute threshold of taste and found that automated testing of taste was just as reliable as traditional testing. Additionally, they found statistical significance of the right side of the tongue having a lower absolute threshold than the left side. This finding leads to the possibility that the right hemisphere of the brain is better at processing gustatory stimuli than the left. Being deprived of calories for a short time increases sensitivity to and decreases absolute threshold for sweet and salty foods. Other factors such as pregnancy and smoking can influence taste sensitivity. Sensory Processing Disorder Main article: Sensory Processing Disorder Some people have an abnormally high or low absolute threshold for one or more senses that interferes with their quality of life. They tend to avoid stimulation, seek after it, or perhaps not notice it at all. This is a symptom of can be diagnosed as a sensory processing disorder, also known as sensory integration dysfunction, which is common in people with autism.

Campbell (born December 31, 1981)http://m.espn.go.com/nfl/playerinfo?playerId=8440 is a former American football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the Washington Redskins in the first round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He played college football at Auburn. Campbell also played for the Oakland Raiders, Chicago Bears, Cleveland Browns, and Cincinnati Bengals. College career A 2000 graduate of Taylorsville High School in Taylorsville, Mississippi, Campbell went on to play college football at Auburn. As a starter, he had a different offensive coordinator every year, finally finding success in his senior year when he led the Tigers to an undefeated season in 2004 and was named the SEC Player of the Year and MVP of the SEC Championship Game. Campbell previously held the record for the longest touchdown completion in Auburn football history, an 87-yard pass to Silas Daniels in a 2004 matchup versus Louisiana Tech, a record that is now held by Cam Newton, who completed a 94-yard pass to Emory Blake on October 2, 2010 in their victory over Louisiana-Monroe. Campbell graduated from Auburn with a degree in public administration. =Statistics= { class=wikitable style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! rowspan=2Season !! rowspan=2Team !! colspan=10Passing !! colspan=4Rushing - !

The Redskins traded up in the draft to get Campbell, surrendering a third round pick in the 2005 NFL draft, along with first and fourth round picks in 2006. Campbell didn't play in his rookie season, sitting on the bench behind Mark Brunell and Patrick Ramsey. On November 13, 2006, Campbell was named the Redskins starting quarterback, and on November 19, 2006, Campbell made his first career start. Despite losing in his first start to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Campbell was praised for his poise. On November 26, 2006, Campbell had his first win of his pro career, leading the Redskins to a 17‚Äì13 victory over the Carolina Panthers. Campbell completed 11 passes on 23 attempts for only 118 yards, with two touchdowns and one interception. Campbell threw a 66-yard touchdown pass to tight end Chris Cooley in the fourth quarter. Campbell in 2006. On August 18, 2007, Campbell was tackled at the knee by Pittsburgh Steelers' DE Brett Keisel in the second preseason game. Initially, the injury looked severe but Campbell eventually walked off the field on his own. Trainers said that Campbell's ligaments were not torn and announced his injury as a bruised knee. On December 6, 2007, Campbell dislocated the patellar ligament of his left knee during a game against the Chicago Bears. The injury did not require surgery but Campbell did not play for the remainder of the season. Toledo Blade archives When Joe Gibbs retired for a second time at the end of the 2007 season, the Redskins hired Jim Zorn, first as offensive coordinator and then naming him head coach. Zorn said at the time he would also serve as quarterbacks coach. The Redskins started the season 6‚Äì2, prompting observers to declare Campbell one of the NFL's elite quarterbacks, and the \\"tough love\\" approach from head coach Jim Zorn a success. The team, however, then went on to lose six of their remaining eight games to end the season 8‚Äì8, missing the playoffs. At the end of the season, it was unclear if the Redskins were on the road to improvement or decline. Questions arose on the future of Campbell as the starting quarterback for the Washington Redskins. Despite pursuing other quarterbacks in the offseason, the Redskins were unable to acquire Jay Cutler or Mark Sanchez, opting to start Campbell for the last year of his contract. Campbell and the Redskins ended 2009 with a 4‚Äì12 record, one of the worst in Redskins' history. The often rocky relationship Campbell had with head coach Jim Zorn ended with Zorn's firing. New Washington head coach Mike Shanahan said the Redskins would tender Campbell an offer leading up to the 2010 free agent period, ensuring that if he signed with another team, Washington would receive draft picks in compensation. =Oakland Raiders= After the Redskins acquired Donovan McNabb, Campbell was traded to the Oakland Raiders on April 24, 2010 for a fourth round pick in the 2012 NFL Draft. On the same day, Campbell received a one-year contract extension through the 2011 season.Rick Maese and Jason Reid, \\"Redskins trade Jason Campbell to Raiders\\", The Washington Post, April 25, 2010. Raiders owner Al Davis compared Campbell to former Raiders quarterback Jim Plunkett. In the opening game on the road against the Tennessee Titans, Campbell had an unspectacular start to his Raiders career as the Raiders were routed 38‚Äì13. He would complete 22 of 37 passes for 180 yards and throw one touchdown and one interception. Campbell and rookie offensive linemen Jared Veldheer, playing in the unfamiliar role of center, would also suffer multiple miscues and combine for three fumbles, losing one. The offense as a whole would fail to click until the fourth quarter when Campbell completed 7 of 9 passes in a 12-play, 72-yard drive that culminated in a 7-yard touchdown pass to Darren McFadden. In week two against the St. Louis Rams Campbell would endure another lackluster performance, completing 8 of 15 passes for a mere 87 yards and an interception. At half-time he was benched in favor of his backup, Bruce Gradkowski, in the hope of providing the Raiders offense with the spark it desperately needed. Gradkowski would go on to lead the Raiders to a tight 16‚Äì14 victory. Following Campbell's less than inspiring performances in the first two weeks, the Raiders' coaching staff decided to go with Bruce Gradkowski as the starting quarterback and demoted Campbell to the role of backup. The offense would show a marked improvement in the Week 3 and 4 match- ups against the Arizona Cardinals and Houston Texans respectively. Gradkowski would throw for 255 and 278 yards albeit in losing efforts. During the Week 5 home game against the Chargers, Campbell would come off the bench late in the first quarter to replace an injured Gradkowski. Behind a solid game by running back Michael Bush, Campbell was vastly improved as he completed 13 of 18 passes for 159 yards and a touchdown. Aided by a touchdown on a blocked punt in the first quarter and a forced fumble returned for a touchdown late in the fourth quarter, the Raiders would win the game 35‚Äì27 and snap a 13-game losing streak against the Chargers dating back to 2003. After his improved play in the relief effort against the Chargers and with Gradkowski injured, Campbell was re-installed as the starter for the Week 6 match-up against the cross-Bay rival San Francisco 49ers. The Raiders were unable to find any spark on offense as Campbell once again struggled, completing just 8 of 21 passes for 83 yards and throwing two interceptions. The Raiders would go down 17‚Äì9 to then winless 49ers. Although coming off of his worst performance as a Raider, Campbell was assured the start against the division rival Denver Broncos in Week 7 due to Gradkowski's continuing struggles with the shoulder injury he sustained against the Chargers. Campbell and the Raiders started hot against the Broncos, jumping out to a 24‚Äì0 lead by the end of the first quarter and never let up in a 59‚Äì14 rout. The 59 points scored was a new franchise record. Campbell would complete 12 of 20 passes for 204 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions for a QB rating of 127.9. Campbell would throw a 43-yard touchdown pass to tight end Zach Miller on the game's opening drive and a 19-yard touchdown pass to running back Darren McFadden. Ironically, while Campbell was benched by coach's decision, the Raiders lost all three of the games that Campbell did not play in, as the Raiders finished the season at 8‚Äì8 and missed the playoffs. They were able to sweep all six division games, and Campbell ended the season with his second-highest quarterback rating of any season (84.5). In 2011, Campbell started the first 6 games, leading Oakland to a 4‚Äì2 record before suffering a collarbone injury. To replace him, the Raiders traded draft picks to the Cincinnati Bengals for veteran quarterback Carson Palmer. =Chicago Bears= Campbell signed with the Chicago Bears on March 13, 2012 to a one-year contract as a backup to Jay Cutler. In Week 10 against the Houston Texans, Campbell replaced Cutler, who had gone down with a concussion. In the game, Campbell completed 11 of 19 passes for 94 yards and a 70.9 passer rating. On November 16, Cutler was ruled out of the Bears-San Francisco 49ers game, meaning Campbell would start the game. The Bears went on to lose 32‚Äì7; although Campbell had a 13-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall in the third quarter, he also threw two interceptions and was sacked five times. =Cleveland Browns= Campbell in 2013 On March 26, 2013, Campbell signed a two-year contract with the Cleveland Browns. On September 18, 2013 it was announced that previous 3rd string quarterback Brian Hoyer would start ahead of Campbell for the team's next game on September 22, 2013 against the Minnesota Vikings, as starting quarterback Brandon Weeden sat with a thumb injury. On October 23, it was announced Campbell would receive his first start as a Brown Week 8 vs the Kansas City Chiefs. The outing resulted in a 23‚Äì17 loss for the Browns, although Campbell's performance was viewed favorably, passing for 293 yards, 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. In week 9 Campbell snapped the Browns 11 game losing streak to the Ravens, throwing for 262 yards and 3 scores on his way to AFC offensive player of the week honors Campbell ended the 2013 season 1‚Äì7 as a starter for the Browns. On March 12, 2014, Campbell was released by the Browns, along with fellow quarterback Weeden. = Cincinnati Bengals= Campbell at Bengals training camp in 2014. On March 19, 2014, Campbell signed a one-year deal worth $1.5 million with $400,000 guaranteed with the Cincinnati Bengals. He served as a backup to starter to Andy Dalton, only appearing in four games as a late game replacement for Dalton. =Retirement= In April 2015, Campbell strongly hinted at retirement, declining offers from multiple teams. He was approached by the Indianapolis Colts in November 2015, but declined to come out of retirement to be a backup to Matt Hasselbeck, who was starting in place of an injured Andrew Luck. =Career statistics= { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! rowspan=2Season !! rowspan=2Team !! colspan=10Passing !! colspan=4Rushing - !

The station is owned by Entercom and airs an adult hits radio format known as \\"Jack FM.\\" Studios and offices are on Second Avenue South in Minneapolis. KZJK has an effective radiated power of 100,000 watts. The station's transmitter is on the KMSP Tower in Shoreview, with an auxiliary transmission facility located atop the IDS Center in Downtown Minneapolis. History =Early Years as KRSI- FM= On July 1, 1962, the station signed on as KRSI-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1963 page B-100 It was co-owned with KRSI by Radio Suburbia. The two stations simulcast most of their programming, and were affiliates of the ABC Radio Network. KRSI was a daytimer at that time, so KRSI-FM allowed the station to be heard around the clock, even when the AM had to sign-off. KRSI-FM had a limited range, broadcasting at 15,000 watts from a 250-foot (76 meter) tower, located east of the Twin Cities, in Somerset, Wisconsin. The result was a spotty signal in parts of the metropolitan area, even after the power was doubled to 30,000 watts in the late 1960s. Partly due to signal limitations and impatient management, the 104.1 FM frequency went through many format changes throughout its history. In February 1968, KRSI-AM-FM was bought by Park Communications, a radio company with stations in New York City, Los Angeles and other cities. From 1968 until 1973, KRSI-AM-FM played a mix of Top 40 hits and oldies as \\"Request Radio.\\" In Spring 1969, KRSI-AM-FM ranked as the #3 station in the Minneapolis ratings, behind WCCO and WDGY. By 1971, KRSI-AM-FM moved away from oldies and toward contemporary hits. =Rock/Top 40 KFMX= In March 1973, KRSI became the first affiliate of Drake-Chenault‚Äôs automated ‚ÄúGreat American Country‚Äù format. Both stations moved from their studios in St. Louis Park to new facilities in Eden Prairie (which today is still home to 950 AM).St. Louis Park Historical Society - Twin Cities Music The FM station broadcast in stereo for the first time and moved to an album rock/Top 40 hybrid format, soon changing its call letters to KFMX.Broadcasting Yearbook 1974 page B-114 KFMX went through a succession of different formats and transitions throughout the rest of the decade. For a brief time, it played free form rock, going up against KQRS-FM. KFMX began playing disco music at night in 1978, soon adopting the format full-time and becoming \\"Disco 104.\\"Broadcasting Yearbook 1981 page C-127 By this time, the AM station was playing rock/Top 40 and new wave music as \\"Musicradio I-95.\\" KFMX gave up disco in February 1980 as the fad faded in popularity, and both stations switched to an adult standards/\\"Music of Your Life\\" simulcast, with KFMX becoming KRSI-FM once again. (The KFMX call letters would go to 94.5 in Lubbock, Texas later that year and they remain there to this day.) =KJJO= In September 1981, the FM station switched to country music, as \\"K-JO Country\\", adopting the KJJO call letters.Broadcasting Yearbook 1982 page C-129 It was up against established country stations in the Twin Cities, market leader WDGY, low-rated KTCR-AM-FM and soon, KEEY. KJJO was never very competitive as a country station. In September 1983, after playing \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\" by Bob Seger for 48 hours straight, the station launched a new classic hits format, \\"Twenty Years of Rock and Roll.\\" It was now calling itself \\"K-JO 104.\\" KJJO's ratings improved with the classic hits format, but the station was still not making much of an impact in the market. In 1986, KJJO transformed yet again and introduced a hard rock format, to go head-to- head with the classic rock-leaning KQRS-FM. The KJJO call letters were retained, with the station now calling itself \\"Hot Rockin' 104\\" (later \\"Rock 104\\"). At its peak, the hard rock format pushed KJJO into the top 10 in the local Arbitron ratings. KJJO was not very consistent with the harder format, though, as it went back and forth between heavy metal and mainstream album rock. In the fall of 1988, KJJO's AM counterpart became a network affiliate of the syndicated heavy metal \\"Z-Rock\\" format. =Modern Rock KJ104= By 1990, KJJO began adding more alternative rock songs to its play list. Eventually, KJJO ditched the heavy metal and mainstream rock altogether and became a full- fledged modern rock station. At first, KJJO called itself \\"104FM,\\" but later used the moniker \\"KJ104.\\" During the station's modern rock run, the playlist became more adventurous. Over time, KJ104 garnered positive word of mouth in the Twin Cities area, though ratings were still mediocre. The station's manager complained in the local media that KJ104's listeners were not filling out the Arbitron ratings diaries, the results of which are used to measure a radio station's success. =Back to Country as \\"Thunder 104\\"= In the summer of 1992, KJJO announced it would switch back to country music, which was increasing in popularity, amid a large outcry from KJ104's dedicated modern rock fans.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1992/RR-1992-08-14.pdf At 6 a.m. on September 8, after signing off the modern rock format by playing \\"It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\\" by R.E.M., \\"Thunder 104\\" debuted. As a country station, ratings went up slightly, but the station could not compete with the established country leader KEEY (\\"K102\\"), or WBOB (\\"BOB 100\\"). To set itself apart from the competition, KJJO evolved into a classic country format as \\"Classic Country 104,\\" and ratings slightly improved. Meanwhile, several former KJ104 employees were working at bringing the rock format back to the local airwaves, which culminated with the debut of REV 105 in April 1994. A month prior to this, hard rocker KRXX became KEGE \\"The Edge,\\" and was soon the highest-rated modern rock station in the country, succeeding where KJJO, as KJ104, failed. =Smooth Jazz and Modern AC= With K102 and BOB 100 firmly establishing in the country format, KJJO gave up on country and flipped to smooth jazz on March 28, 1995, under new call letters KMJZ.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1998 page D-239 During this time, ownership transferred several times; Nationwide Communications, a subsidiary of Nationwide Insurance, bought both the AM and FM stations from the estate of longtime owner Roy H. Park. Nationwide Communications was bought by Jacor in October 1997, which spun the station off to Infinity Broadcasting in June 1998, and would be renamed CBS Radio in December 2005.https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-06-05.pdf On September 24, 1998, at 4 p.m., the station changed format once again, to Modern AC as WXPT, \\"104-1 The Point.\\" The first song on \\"The Point\\" was \\"The Way\\" by Fastball. Radio & Records October 2, 1998 After gradually adding in songs from the 1980s throughout the course of 2000, WXPT shifted to a full-fledged '80s hits format on November 17, 2000, and rebranded as \\"Mix 104.1.\\" The first song on \\"Mix\\" was \\"Beat It\\" by Michael Jackson.Radio & Records Nov. 24, 2000 While never a dominant station, \\"Mix\\" was a modest ratings and financial success, as the station's transmitter woes were finally resolved by the move to KMSP-TV's antenna array in Shoreview, Minnesota, where most of the market's big FM stations have their transmitters. CBS Radio later sold WXPT's longtime sister station at 950 AM to a local group, which turned it into KTNF, a progressive talk station. =Jack FM= At 9 a.m. on April 21, 2005, after a few hours of stunting, \\"Mix 104.1\\" flipped to \\"Jack FM.\\" The first song on \\"Jack\\" was \\"Get The Party Started\\" by P!nk.Radio & Records April 29, 2005 On May 10, 2005, three weeks after the format change, the call letters were officially changed to KZJK. KZJK has a larger playlist compared to other radio stations. While many stations commonly have 200-400 songs in rotation, the Jack format has three or four times that number. The Twin Cities version of Jack plays an occasional current or recent hit, while most Jack FM affiliates stick with songs from the past, primarily hits from the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. CBS Radio to Merge with Entercom The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th. KZJK-HD2 KZJK broadcasts an HD Radio signal. Its HD2 signal originally carried a smooth jazz format, but on December 26, 2011, fellow sister station WLTE's former \\"Lite FM\\" adult contemporary format moved to KZJK-HD2 after WLTE flipped to country music as KMNB. In addition to its regular programming, KZJK-HD2 carries all-Christmas music from mid-November to midnight on Christmas. References * Amy Carlson Gustafson (April 22, 2005).

Day and Seres specialized in religious works, such as those by Robert Crowley, which were largely related to theological controversies of the time. By 1550, Day and Seres were busy and successful enough to amicably separate their businesses. Seres afterwards joined partnership for a time with the printer and translator Anthony Scoloker, and in 1553 received letters patent for the printing of psalters, primers and prayer- books.http://www.copyrighthistory.org/cgi- bin/kleioc/0010/exec/ausgabe/%22uk_1553a%22http://www.copyrighthistory.org/cgi- bin/kleioc/0010/exec/showmax/%22uk_1553a_im_001_0001.jpg%22 However, he lost this privilege after the accession of Queen Mary to the throne in July 1553, when the entire religious climate of the country changed. He seems to have sought safety on the Continent. His letters patent were renewed with the accession in 1558 of Elizabeth I. In his old age he assigned his business for a yearly rental to Henry Denham who became a member of the Stationers' Company in 1560.

It stands on the corniche, overlooking the west bank of the River Nile. Establishment The Luxor Museum was inaugurated in 1975. It is a two-story building. The range of artifacts on display is far more restricted than the country's main collections in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo; this was, however, deliberate, since the museum prides itself on the quality of the pieces it has, the uncluttered way in which they are displayed, and the clear multilingual labeling used. The museum was conceived by the Egyptian Ministry of Culture, which hired Dr. Mahmud El Hakim, a top Egyptian architect, to create the plans in 1962. The installation of the museum art works came later and was finished between 1972 and 1975. Collection Among the items on display are grave goods from the tomb of the 18th dynasty pharaoh Tutankhamun (KV62) and a collection of 26 New Kingdom statues that were found buried in the Luxor statue cache in the nearby Luxor Temple in 1989. The royal mummies of two pharaohs ‚Äì Ahmose I and Ramesses I ‚Äì were also put on display in the Luxor Museum in March 2004, as part of the new extension to the museum, which includes a small visitor centre.

She is a member of the New Zealand Labour Party and was a Member of Parliament from 2005 general election until her retirement in 2017. Early life Sue Moroney was raised in the Waikato. Her parents farmed 66 acres of land to provide an income for their family of seven. She grew up in Walton and attended Walton Primary School and also spent time in Matamata. Her family are keenly involved in horse racing. During her maiden speech Moroney quipped: \\"our family never had Michael Joseph Savage on our wall, but we did have a very tasteful mural of a horse race over our fireplace.\\" Moroney previously worked as a trainer of health and safety personnel, and held a number of positions in the union movement. Politics Moroney has been endorsed as a candidate by the Labour Party on a number of occasions. In the first MMP election of 1996 she contested the seat of and was 31st on the Labour list. In the 2002 election she again contested but chose not to stand for the list. In the 2005 election Moroney again contested Piako and, while unsuccessful in the electorate, was ranked 42nd on the Party List and was elected to Parliament as a list MP. In the 2008 general election she was the Labour candidate in the seat of Hamilton East and was returned to parliament due to her list placing of 22. =Member of Parliament= Sue Moroney was, with Shane Jones, one of two newly elected members of parliament to move and second the Address in Reply to the Governor General's speech from the throne at the opening of the 48th Parliament. On 31 October 2007 Moroney was announced as the new Junior Government Whip, replacing Darren Hughes who became a Minister outside Cabinet. Sue Moroney drafted a private members bill that entitled workers to their meal and rest breaks which, along with another private members bill in the name of Labour colleague Steve Chadwick, was the basis for the 'Breaks and Infant Feeding Act' which passed in August 2008. The Labour Party entered Opposition after the 2008 General Election and Moroney became the Opposition Spokesperson for the portfolios of Women's Affairs and Early Childhood Education. Moroney is a member of the Transport and Industrial Relations select committee. Moroney had a private members bill in the ballot to extend Paid Parental Leave to six months from fourteen weeks. It was defeated after the 2015 election by a 60‚Äì60 vote with the National Party government and ACT voting against the bill. She also sponsored a petition signed by 15,808 others calling on the government to reinstate pay equity reviews for school support staff and social workers, and develop a plan to end the 12% gender pay gap in New Zealand. Moroney presented the \\"Waikato Trains Now!\\" petition signed by 11,500 people to the House of Representatives on 1 April 2010, on behalf of the Campaign for Better Transport group. The petition called for a passenger rail service from Hamilton to Auckland. In early 2011 Labour Leader Phil Goff announced a reshuffle of his caucus. Moroney was moved to a higher rank in the party caucus and gained the responsibility for Aged Care. Women's Affairs was passed on to first term MP Carol Beaumont. Following the resignation from parliament of Darren Hughes, Moroney was further promoted to the front bench taking on the senior portfolio of Education and passed Aged Care onto Steve Chadwick. Following the resignation of David Shearer in 2013 and the election of David Cunliffe as party leader, Moroney was elected as Chief Whip. Only five months after its defeat, Moroney had another private members bill drawn from the ballot to extend Paid Parental Leave to six months from 18 weeks. The bill also allocates 'work contact hours' for parents wanting to keep in contact with their workplace during their leave, to no detriment to their parental leave entitlements. the bill passed its first reading in Parliament on 16 September 2015 by 61 votes to 60, with support coming from New Zealand First, the Greens, the Maori Party and United Future. The bill is currently at committee stage. In the November 2015 Labour Party caucus reshuffle, Moroney was promoted to the Labour Party shadow cabinet by leader Andrew Little. In her promotion, Moroney picked up the Transport portfolio and associate spokesperson on Industrial Relations and Safety. On 30 April she announced she would not be standing in the 2017 election, saying, \\"\\"I made my decision after being notified last night that I had lost support from the party's ruling council for an electable position on the Labour Party list\\". Personal life Her family is prominent in racehorse owning and training. Her brother Paul Moroney who is a prominent horse trainer/owner was involved in the controversy surrounding Owen Glenn contributing to the New Zealand First party, by giving an affidavit supporting Mr Glenn's version of events. Moroney is married with two sons.

She was built by Henry Eckford of Sacketts Harbor, New York, during the summer and winter of 1812-13, launched 6 April 1813 and entered service 13 days later, Sailing Master Flinn in command. History Built under the personal supervision of Commodore Isaac Chauncey for duty as a dispatch boat on Lake Ontario carrying messages to Niagara, the schooner was seldom used as she was designed. Instead she saw considerable action on the Great Lakes throughout the War of 1812. Actively employed in Chauncey's squadron, she assisted in the assault on York, Canada, carrying some of General Henry Dearborn's troops and sailing close inshore to cover the troops with precision fire. A month later, after bringing supplies to troops at York, she joined in the attack on Fort George on 27 May, once again carrying troops and using her gun to advantage. She wreaked havoc among the English troops and forced them to withdraw, blowing up the fort behind them. Continuing operations on Lake Ontario, Lady of the Lake captured the English schooner Lady Murray with a cargo of ammunition off Presqu'ile, near Brighton, Ontario on 16 June and then operated as a dispatch and supply boat throughout the summer. On 11 September, the schooner was part of the American squadron that engaged the British under Captain Sir James Yeo in an inconclusive, three- hour-long range battle in Lake Ontario. She fought again with the squadron 17 days later off York in a short but fierce engagement that forced the British to retreat into Burlington Bay. In her last combat on 5 October 1813, she assisted three other American ships in attacking and capturing British schooners Confiance, Hamilton, , and cutter off False Ducks, Lake Ontario. In 1814, 'The Lady of the Lake' was used as a look-out vessel between the Gallows & Kingston after the ice broke up. On Apr 24, 1814, she ran close into Kingston, Ontario while noting and reporting the condition of the Enemy‚Äôs current fleet, new ship builds in progress and batteries.[1] For the remainder of the war she carried dispatches between Sackets Harbor and Fort Niagara. Following the end of the War of 1812, she was placed in ordinary at Sackets Harbor and remained there until sold at public auction on 2 February 1826. References * 1\\\\.

It is also called a symmetrical aldol condensation as opposed to a mixed aldol condensation in which the electrophile and nucleophile are different species. For example, two molecules of acetone condense to a single compound mesityl oxide in the presence of an ion exchange resin:Ketone Condensations Using Sulfonic Acid Ion Exchange Resin N. Lorette; J. Org. Chem.; 1957; 22(3); 346-347. :2 CH3COCH3 -> (CH3)2C=CH(CO)CH3 \\\\+ H2O For synthetic uses, this is generally an undesirable, but spontaneous and favored side-reaction of mixed aldol condensation, and special precautions are needed to prevent it. Preventing self-condensation In many cases, self- condensation is an unwanted side-reaction. Therefore, chemists have adopted many ways to prevent this from occurring when performing a crossed aldol reaction. =The use of a more reactive electrophile, and a non-enolizable partner= If acetophenone and benzaldehyde are put together in the presence of aqueous NaOH, only one product is formed: 450px This occurs because benzaldehyde lacks any enolizable protons, so it cannot form an enolate, and the benzaldehyde is much more electrophilic than any unenolized acetophenone in solution. Therefore, the enolate formed from acetophenone will always preferentially attack the benzaldehyde over another molecule of acetophenone.Clayden, Jonathan. Organic Chemistry. Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York, pp. 689-720. =Making enolate ion quantitatively= When nitromethane and acetophenone are combined using aqueous NaOH, only one product is formed: 350px Here, the acetophenone never gets a chance to condense with itself, because the nitromethane is so much more acidic that the nitro \\"enolate\\" is made quantitatively. A similar process can also be used to prevent self-condensation between two ketones. In this case, however, the base used needs to be more powerful. A common base used is Lithium diisopropyl amide (LDA). Here it is used in order to perform the crossed condensation between acetone and cyclohexanone.Clayden, Jonathan. Organic Chemistry. Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York, pp. 689-720. 300px The deprotonation step using LDA is so fast that the enolate formed never gets a chance to react with any unreacted molecules of cyclohexanone. Then the enolate reacts quickly with acetone. =Silyl enol ether formation= Using LDA will not work when attempting to make enolate ion from aldehydes. They are so reactive that self- condensation will occur. One way to get around this is to turn the aldehyde into a silyl enol ether using trimethylsilyl chloride and a base, such as triethylamine, and then perform the aldol condensation. Here this tactic is employed in the condensation of acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde. A Lewis acid, such as TiCl4, must be used in order to promote condensation.Clayden, Jonathan. Organic Chemistry.

It was also the final major engagement between American forces and insurgent forces in New Mexico during the war. Background In August 1846, New Mexico fell to American troops under Stephen Watts Kearny. When Kearny departed for California, Colonel Sterling Price was left in command of American forces in New Mexico. In January 1847, Price learned of a Mexican revolt in the territory and confronted the rebels at the Battle of Ca√±ada and Battle of Embudo Pass as his forces moved on to Pueblo de Taos, the center of insurrection activity.Hughes, J.T., 1847, Doniphan's Expedition, Cincinnati: U.P. James Another American force fought the New Mexicans at Mora, on the east side of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. On 1 Feb., his force of 478 men reached the summit of Taos Mountain, covered in two feet of snow, and on 2 Feb., Rio Chiquito, the entrance to Taos Valley.Price, S., 1847, Col. Sterling Price's Official Report on the Revolution in New Mexico, in The Conquest of California and New Mexico, Cutts, J.M., 1847, Philadelphia: Carey & Hart, pp. 223‚Äì231 On 3 Feb., Price marched through Don Fernando de Taos and then found the rebels had strongly fortified Pueblo de Taos. Siege Price ordered Lt. Dyer to set up an artillery battery, consisting of a 6-pounder and the howitzers, 250 yards from the western flank of the church and began firing at 2 PM and continued for two and a half hours before retiring to Don Fernando for the evening. Early on 4 Feb., he placed Capt. Burgwin's 1st Dragoon Regiment, and Major Clarke's light artillery, in the same position he had the battery the evening before, Capt. St. Vrain's and Capt. Slack's mounted men were placed to prevent escape towards the mountains or Don Fernando, and the remaining men were placed 300 yards from the northern wall along with Lt. Dyer's artillery battery. This placed the front and eastern flank of the church in a crossfire. The batteries started firing at 9 AM, which failed to breach the church walls, so by 11 AM, Price ordered a storming of the church. Capt. Burgwin and Capt McMillin charged the western flank of the church, while Capt. Agney, Lt. Boon, and Capt. Barber the northern wall. The roof of the church was set fire, but Capt. Burgwin was mortally wounded while moving through the corral at the front of the church. A hole was cut in the western wall which permitted shells to be thrown in by hand, while the 6-pounder was placed so it could fire grape into the town. By 3 pm, the 6-pounder was placed sixty yards from the church and widened the hole after ten rounds, after which it was placed ten yards away and fired three rounds of grape into the church. This allowed Lt. Dyer, Lt. Wilson and Taylor to take possession of the church, followed by the rebels abandoning the western part of the town. The Taos Pueblo, an 1893 illustration. Those trying to escape into the mountains were pursued by Capt. Slack and Capt. St. Vrain, killing many before night fell. The rebels surrendered the next day, giving up one of the insurrection leaders, Tomas Romero, a Pueblo Indian. Aftermath Two of the accused rebellion leaders, Pablo Montoya and Tom√°s Romero, were captured in the fighting. Romero was shot by Private Fitzgerald in the guard room at Don Fernando before being brought to trial.Lavender, David, Bent's Fort, Doubleday and Company, Inc., Garden City, NY 1954 p. 293 Montoya was convicted of treason and hanged at Don Fernando on 7 Feb.

A typical application of such a packet level interface is between a framer (for optical network) or a MAC (for IP network) and a network processor. Another application of this interface might be between a packet processor ASIC and a traffic manager device. Context There are two broad categories of chip-to-chip interfaces. The first, exemplified by PCI-Express and HyperTransport, supports reads and writes of memory addresses. The second broad category carries user packets over 1 or more channels and is exemplified by the IEEE 802.3 family of Media Independent Interfaces and the Optical Internetworking Forum family of System Packet Interfaces. Of these last two, the family of System Packet Interfaces is optimized to carry user packets from many channels. The family of System Packet Interfaces is the most important packet-oriented, chip-to-chip interface family used between devices in the Packet over SONET and Optical Transport Network, which are the principal protocols used to carry the internet between cities. Specifications The agreements are: * SPI-3 - Packet Interface for Physical and Link Layers for OC-48 (2.488 Gbit/s) * SPI-4.1 - System Physical Interface Level 4 (SPI-4) Phase 1: A System Interface for Interconnection Between Physical and Link Layer, or Peer-to-Peer Entities Operating at an OC-192 Rate (10 Gbit/s). * SPI-4.2 - System Packet Interface Level 4 (SPI-4) Phase 2: OC-192 System Interface for Physical and Link Layer Devices. * SPI-5 - Packet Interface for Physical and Link Layers for OC-768 (40 Gbit/s) * SPI-S - Scalable System Packet Interface - useful for interfaces starting with OC-48 and scaling into the Terabit range History of the specifications These agreements grew out of the donation to the OIF by PMC-Sierra of the POS-PHY interface definitions PL-3 and PL-4, which themselves came from the ATM Forum's Utopia definitions. These earlier definitions included: * Utopia Level 1, an 8 bit, 25 MHz interface supporting OC-3 and slower links (or multiple links aggregating to less than 200 Mbit/s). * Utopia Level 2, a 16 bit, 50 MHz interface supporting OC-12 or multiple links aggregating to less than 800 Mbit/s. System Packet Interface or SPI as it is widely known is a protocol for packet and cell transfers between PHY and LINK layer devices in multi-gigabit applications. This protocol has been developed by Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF) and is fast emerging as one of the most important integration standards in the history of telecommunications and data networking. Devices implementing SPI are typically specified with line rates of 700~800 Mbit/s and in some cases up to 1 Gbit/s. The latest version is SPI 4 Phase 2 also known as SPI 4.2 delivers bandwidth of up to 16 Gbit/s for a 16 bit interface. The Interlaken protocol, a close variant of SPI-5 replaced the System Packet Interface in the marketplace. Technical details =SPI 4.2= The SPI 4.2 interface is composed of high speed clock, control, and data lines and lower speed FIFO buffer status lines. The high speed data line include a 16-bit data bus, a 1 bit control line and a double data rate (DDR) clock. The clock can run up to 500 MHz, supporting up to 1 GigaTransfer per second. The FIFO buffer status portion consists of a 2 bit status channel and a clock. SPI 4.2 supports a data width of 16 bits and can be PHY-link, link-link, link-PHY or PHY-PHY connection. The SPI 4.2 interface supports up to 256 port addresses with independent flow control for each.

It is noted for its unique organic architecture and location on cliffs above the Pacific Ocean. It is part of the Swedenborgian Church of North America and serves as a memorial to the 18th century scientist and theosopher, Emanuel Swedenborg. History The church was designed by Lloyd Wright (son of Frank Lloyd Wright) in the late 1940s and was built between 1949 and 1951. Wright departed from the tradition of using masonry in order to \\"achieve a delicate enclosure that allows the surrounding landscape to define the sacred space\\". Additions were built in later years, including a tower and a visitor center, the latter of which had been lost in a landslide during the 1960s. Architecture and design As with many of Wright's buildings, the chapel features geometric designs and incorporates the natural landscape into the design. The Wayfarers Chapel is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Because of its scenic location, the church is very popular for weddings. In popular culture The church was featured in the Fox teen drama television series The O.C., as the site of weddings and funerals. It was also featured briefly on the American science fiction television series Sliders,The O. C. Filming Locations and in an episode of The Rockford Files (2 Into 5.56 Won't Go). In addition, the chapel was part of the final marriage scene in Innerspace, an episode in season four of 90210. The chapel was featured in one of the final scenes in the 2014 movie Endless Love, as well as being featured in the ABC television series Revenge.

The bi is a type of circular ancient Chinese jade artifact. The earliest bi were produced in the Neolithic period, particularly by the Liangzhu culture (3400‚Äì2250 BCE).Teaching Chinese Archaeology, object 3 - NGA Later examples date mainly from the Shang, Zhou and Han dynasties. They were also made in glass. Description A bi is a flat jade disc with a circular hole in the centre. Neolithic bi are undecorated, while those of later periods of China, like the Zhou dynasty, bear increasingly ornate surface carving (particularly in a hexagonal pattern) whose motifs represented deities associated with the sky (four directions) as well as standing for qualities and powers the wearer wanted to invoke or embody. As laboriously crafted objects, they testify to the concentration of power and resources in the hands of a small elite. Meaning Later traditions associate the bi with heaven, and the cong with the earth. Bi disks are consistently found with heaven and earth-like imagery, suggesting that the disk's circular shape also bears symbolic significance as this description explains: Function Bi disc with a dual dragon motif, Warring States period From these earliest times they were buried with the dead, as a sky symbol, accompanying the dead into the after world or \\"sky\\", with the cong which connected the body with the earth. They were placed ceremonially on the body in the grave of persons of high social status. Bi are sometimes found near the stomach and chest in neolithic burials. Jade, like bi disks, has been used throughout Chinese history to indicate an individual of moral quality, and has also served as an important symbol of rank. They were used in worship and ceremony ‚Äì as ceremonial items they symbolised the ranks of emperor, king, duke, marquis, viscount, and baron with four different Guis and two different bi disks. In war during the Zhou dynasty period (c. 1046‚Äì256 BCE), bi disks belonging to the leaders of the defeated forces were handed over to the victor as a sign of submission. Qianlong Emperor and the Bi In 1790 AD, the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty had an ancient bi inscribed with a message. He also wrote a poem entitled: \\"Verses Composed on Matching a Ding- ware Ceramic with an Ancient Jade Bowl Stand\\". It reads as follows: \\"It is said there were no bowls in antiquity / but if so, then where did this stand come from? It is said that this stand dates to later times / but the jade is antique. It is also said that a bowl called wan is the same as a basin called yu, but only differing from it in size\\". He also wrote: \\"This stand is made of ancient jade / but the jade bowl that once went with it is long gone. As one cannot show a stand without a bowl / we have selected a ceramic from the Ding kiln for it\\". He has also included the day, and year on the disc. The Qianlong emperor assumed the bi was a bowl stand, so he found a bowl and engraved it with messages to match the ones he engraved on the disc. This bi disc was also used for the Qianlong Emperor's funeral, and was also used for high status people's funerals as well.A History of the World in 100 Objects (object 90).

Diodorus Siculus related that they once became friends with Androgeos, a son of Minos, and that was why Aegeus had Androgeos assassinated, fearing that Pallas and his sons could use this friendship to get assistance from the powerful Minos against him.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica (Book 4, Ch. 60) The Pallantidae and their father marched against Theseus and Aegeus in order to seize the throne; according to Plutarch, one half of them under command of Pallas openly marched on Athens from Sphettus, while the other half laid in ambush near Gargettus. However, their herald Leos warned Theseus of their schemes and Theseus pre- emptively ambushed the Pallantides and killed all those at Gargettus, whereupon the other half retreated.Plutarch, Theseus (Ch. 13) Other sources state that Theseus killed all the fifty Pallantidae as well as Pallas.Pseudo- Apollodorus, Bibliotheca (Epitome of Book 4, Ch. 1, sect. 11)Pausanias, Description of Greece (Book 1, Ch. 22, sect. 2; Book 1, Ch. 28, sect. 10) A tradition saying that he spared their sister, Aricia, whom he kept as slave, is followed in Jean Racine's Ph√®dre but is not supported by extant genuinely ancient sources.

Starring Vincent Price and Elizabeth Shepherd, it tells of a man haunted by the spirit of his dead wife and her effect on his second marriage. The screenplay by Robert Towne was based upon the short story \\"Ligeia\\" by American author Edgar Allan Poe and was the last in his series of films loosely based on the works of Poe. Tomb of Ligeia was filmed at Castle Acre Priory and other locations with a mostly English cast. Plot Verden Fell (Vincent Price) is both mournful about and feels threatened by the death of his first wife, Ligeia. He sensed her reluctance to die and was concerned about her near- blasphemous statements about God (she was an atheist). Alone and troubled by an eye condition that requires him to wear dark glasses, Fell shuns the world. By accident, he meets a headstrong young woman, Rowena (Elizabeth Shepherd), who pursues him even though she is apparently betrothed to an old friend, Christopher Gough (John Westbrook). Against Fell's better judgement, he marries Rowena. Ligeia's spirit seems to haunt their mansion, previously a medieval abbey, and nocturnal visions and the sinister presence of a cat (which may be inhabited by the spirit of Ligeia) distress Rowena. The cat, who first appears at Ligeia's burial, wounds and appears to attempt to kill Rowena several times and Fell unsuccessfully orders its destruction. Ultimately he must face the spirit of Ligeia and resist her or perish. The climax of the film takes place when Fell has a showdown with Ligeia, now in the form of a cat. Fell is blinded by Ligeia, but gets the upper hand and strangles the cat, while the tomb around him burns down, due to an accident. Fell and Ligeia perish and Gough and Rowena start a new life together. Cast Production =Script= Because the original story was so short, Towne read all of Poe's work and decided to expand on Poe's themes, particularly mesmerism and necrophilia. The film would be about a woman who had hypnotised the protagonist and he was making love to a body under post hypnotic suggestion. \\"Literally being controlled by someone who was dead,\\" said Towne, \\"which is gruesome notion but perfectly consistent with Poe.\\" Towne says he \\"tried to have my cake and eat it too\\" by writing a script where the events could be explained naturally (via post hypnotic suggestion) and supernatural (possession). Towne later said \\"Roger and I were really a classic mismatch. It was very painstaking, the script for Tomb of Ligeia. In fact I worked harder on... [that] than on anything I think I have ever done. And I still like that screenplay. I think it's good.\\" =Casting= Roger Corman was initially reluctant to use Vincent Price in the lead role, being worried he was too old for a character who was 25 to 30 years old; his preference was for Richard Chamberlain. Towne later said the film \\"was a little dull. I think it would have been better if it had been with a man who didn't look like a necrophiliac to begin with... I love Vincent. He's very sweet. But, going in, you suspect that Vincent could bang cats, chickens, girls, dogs, everything. You just feel that necrophilia might be one of his Basic Things. I'd felt the role called for an almost unnaturally handsome guy who the second wife could easily fall in love with. There should also be a sense of taboo about the close tie he had with his first wife ‚Äì as though it was something incestuous, two halves of the same person.\\" However Price's casting was a condition of AIP investing in the film, and Corman relented. Robert Towne had specifically requested Price not be cast, and when Corman broke the news he told the screenwriter, \\"Don't worry, Bob, I've got Marlene Dietrich's make-up man!‚Äù Corman ended up giving Price a wig and using more makeup on him than usual to make him look younger. Nevertheless, he later remarked that Price's casting still \\"did change the orientation of the film quite a bit.\\" Release The Tomb of Ligeia was released in the United Kingdom on November 1964. It was later distributed in the United States on January 1965. Roger Corman later said that \\"all of the Poe films made money, but Tomb of Ligeia made the least amount. I think it was because the series was just running out of steam and also because it was overly complicated.\\"\\"Supernal Dreams: Joe Dante talks Poe with Roger Corman & Daniel Haller\\" By Lawrence French Cinemafantastique April 2, 2008 accessed 8 July 2014 Corman later gave Martin Scorsese permission to use a clip from the film in Mean Streets. =Critical= Howard Thompson in The New York Times of 6 May wrote: > Mr Corman at least cares about putting Mr Poe ‚Äî or at least some of the > master's original ideas ‚Äî on the screen.

(2003) The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms. OUP. (entry for admissible decision function) (or at least sometimes better and never worse), in the precise sense of \\"better\\" defined below. This concept is analogous to Pareto efficiency. Definition Define sets \\\\Theta\\\\,, \\\\mathcal{X} and \\\\mathcal{A}, where \\\\Theta\\\\, are the states of nature, \\\\mathcal{X} the possible observations, and \\\\mathcal{A} the actions that may be taken. An observation x \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is distributed as F(x\\\\mid\\\\theta)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and therefore provides evidence about the state of nature \\\\theta\\\\in\\\\Theta\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. A decision rule is a function \\\\delta:{\\\\mathcal{X}}\\\\rightarrow {\\\\mathcal{A}}, where upon observing x\\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}, we choose to take action \\\\delta(x)\\\\in \\\\mathcal{A}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. Also define a loss function L: \\\\Theta \\\\times \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}, which specifies the loss we would incur by taking action a \\\\in \\\\mathcal{A} when the true state of nature is \\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta. Usually we will take this action after observing data x \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}, so that the loss will be L(\\\\theta,\\\\delta(x))\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. (It is possible though unconventional to recast the following definitions in terms of a utility function, which is the negative of the loss.) Define the risk function as the expectation :R(\\\\theta,\\\\delta)=\\\\operatorname{E}_{F(x\\\\mid\\\\theta)}[{L(\\\\theta,\\\\delta(x))]}.\\\\,\\\\\\\\! Whether a decision rule \\\\delta\\\\,\\\\\\\\! has low risk depends on the true state of nature \\\\theta\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. A decision rule \\\\delta^*\\\\,\\\\\\\\! dominates a decision rule \\\\delta\\\\,\\\\\\\\! if and only if R(\\\\theta,\\\\delta^*)\\\\le R(\\\\theta,\\\\delta) for all \\\\theta\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, and the inequality is strict for some \\\\theta\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. A decision rule is admissible (with respect to the loss function) if and only if no other rule dominates it; otherwise it is inadmissible. Thus an admissible decision rule is a maximal element with respect to the above partial order. An inadmissible rule is not preferred (except for reasons of simplicity or computational efficiency), since by definition there is some other rule that will achieve equal or lower risk for all \\\\theta\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. But just because a rule \\\\delta\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is admissible does not mean it is a good rule to use. Being admissible means there is no other single rule that is always as good or better ‚Äì but other admissible rules might achieve lower risk for most \\\\theta\\\\,\\\\\\\\! that occur in practice. (The Bayes risk discussed below is a way of explicitly considering which \\\\theta\\\\,\\\\\\\\! occur in practice.) Bayes rules and generalized Bayes rules =Bayes rules= Let \\\\pi(\\\\theta)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! be a probability distribution on the states of nature. From a Bayesian point of view, we would regard it as a prior distribution. That is, it is our believed probability distribution on the states of nature, prior to observing data. For a frequentist, it is merely a function on \\\\Theta\\\\,\\\\\\\\! with no such special interpretation. The Bayes risk of the decision rule \\\\delta\\\\,\\\\\\\\! with respect to \\\\pi(\\\\theta)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the expectation :r(\\\\pi,\\\\delta)=\\\\operatorname{E}_{\\\\pi(\\\\theta)}[R(\\\\theta,\\\\delta)].\\\\,\\\\\\\\! A decision rule \\\\delta\\\\,\\\\\\\\! that minimizes r(\\\\pi,\\\\delta)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is called a Bayes rule with respect to \\\\pi(\\\\theta)\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. There may be more than one such Bayes rule. If the Bayes risk is infinite for all \\\\delta\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, then no Bayes rule is defined. =Generalized Bayes rules= In the Bayesian approach to decision theory, the observed x\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is considered fixed. Whereas the frequentist approach (i.e., risk) averages over possible samples x \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, the Bayesian would fix the observed sample x\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and average over hypotheses \\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. Thus, the Bayesian approach is to consider for our observed x\\\\,\\\\\\\\! the expected loss :\\\\rho(\\\\pi,\\\\delta \\\\mid x)=\\\\operatorname{E}_{\\\\pi(\\\\theta \\\\mid x)} [ L(\\\\theta,\\\\delta(x)) ]. \\\\,\\\\\\\\! where the expectation is over the posterior of \\\\theta\\\\,\\\\\\\\! given x\\\\,\\\\\\\\! (obtained from \\\\pi(\\\\theta)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and F(x\\\\mid\\\\theta)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! using Bayes' theorem). Having made explicit the expected loss for each given x\\\\,\\\\\\\\! separately, we can define a decision rule \\\\delta\\\\,\\\\\\\\! by specifying for each x\\\\,\\\\\\\\! an action \\\\delta(x)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! that minimizes the expected loss. This is known as a generalized Bayes rule with respect to \\\\pi(\\\\theta)\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. There may be more than one generalized Bayes rule, since there may be multiple choices of \\\\delta(x)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! that achieve the same expected loss. At first, this may appear rather different from the Bayes rule approach of the previous section, not a generalization. However, notice that the Bayes risk already averages over \\\\Theta\\\\,\\\\\\\\! in Bayesian fashion, and the Bayes risk may be recovered as the expectation over \\\\mathcal{X} of the expected loss (where x\\\\sim\\\\theta\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and \\\\theta\\\\sim\\\\pi\\\\,\\\\\\\\!). Roughly speaking, \\\\delta\\\\,\\\\\\\\! minimizes this expectation of expected loss (i.e., is a Bayes rule) if and only if it minimizes the expected loss for each x \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X} separately (i.e., is a generalized Bayes rule). Then why is the notion of generalized Bayes rule an improvement? It is indeed equivalent to the notion of Bayes rule when a Bayes rule exists and all x\\\\,\\\\\\\\! have positive probability. However, no Bayes rule exists if the Bayes risk is infinite (for all \\\\delta\\\\,\\\\\\\\!). In this case it is still useful to define a generalized Bayes rule \\\\delta\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, which at least chooses a minimum-expected-loss action \\\\delta(x)\\\\\\\\!\\\\, for those x\\\\,\\\\\\\\! for which a finite-expected-loss action does exist. In addition, a generalized Bayes rule may be desirable because it must choose a minimum-expected-loss action \\\\delta(x)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! for every x\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, whereas a Bayes rule would be allowed to deviate from this policy on a set X \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{X} of measure 0 without affecting the Bayes risk. More important, it is sometimes convenient to use an improper prior \\\\pi(\\\\theta)\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. In this case, the Bayes risk is not even well-defined, nor is there any well-defined distribution over x\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. However, the posterior \\\\pi(\\\\theta\\\\mid x)\\\\,\\\\\\\\!‚Äîand hence the expected loss‚Äîmay be well- defined for each x\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, so that it is still possible to define a generalized Bayes rule. =Admissibility of (generalized) Bayes rules= According to the complete class theorems, under mild conditions every admissible rule is a (generalized) Bayes rule (with respect to some prior \\\\pi(\\\\theta)\\\\,\\\\\\\\!‚Äîpossibly an improper one‚Äîthat favors distributions \\\\theta\\\\,\\\\\\\\! where that rule achieves low risk). Thus, in frequentist decision theory it is sufficient to consider only (generalized) Bayes rules. Conversely, while Bayes rules with respect to proper priors are virtually always admissible, generalized Bayes rules corresponding to improper priors need not yield admissible procedures. Stein's example is one such famous situation. Examples The James‚ÄìStein estimator is a nonlinear estimator of the mean of Gaussian random vectors which can be shown to dominate, or outperform, the ordinary least squares technique with respect to a mean-square error loss function. Thus least squares estimation is not an admissible estimation procedure in this context. Some others of the standard estimates associated with the normal distribution are also inadmissible: for example, the sample estimate of the variance when the population mean and variance are unknown.

The car was exhibited at the Paris Motor Show in 1947, but by then had already been under development for more than five years. Volume manufacturing was initially hampered by strikes and shortages of materials, but production got under way late in 1948, with buyers taking delivery of 203s from early 1949. The 203 was Peugeot's first new model launched after World War II. During its twelve-year production run nearly 700,000 203s of all variants rolled off the assembly line in Sochaux, France. Between the demise of the 202 in 1949 and the launch of the 403 in 1955, the 203 was the only model produced by Peugeot. The body Peugeot 203 4-Door Berline (1948 - 1952 version) The 203 was the first monocoque bodied production Peugeot. The car was eye catchingly modern and bore a marked resemblance to the American Chevrolet Fleetline fastback, although its wind cheating profile also reflected the streamlining trend apparent in some of Europe's more modern designs, including some of Peugeot's own 402 model, from the 1930s. The 4-door saloon was the major seller, but from 1950 a commodious 4-door version (Commerciale) and a 6-seat (Familiale), with three rows of seats, were also offered on a wheelbase lengthened by to . By taking the trouble to extend the wheelbase for the estate and family versions, the company set a pattern which they would follow with several succeeding generations of large family Peugeot estates such as the 404 and 504. In October 1952 the Paris Motor Show welcomed a modified 203 which now featured hinged quarter light windows (described in contemporary sources as \\"d√©flecteurs aux vitres\\") on the front ends of the front doors and an enlarged rear window on the saloon versions. This upgrade also saw the removal of the speedometer from the centre of the dashboard to a position directly ahead of the driver. Until 1953 the protruding fuel filler cap was rather exposed. (From 1953 it was recessed and protected by a flap.) Publicity shots from the early 1950s tend to avoid showing the rear of the car from the right side. That changes with 203s displayed at the 1953 Motor Show, after which the hitherto protruding fuel filler cap was sunk a couple of centimeters lower into the rear wing, and gained the protection of an opening flap set flush with the line of the bodywork. Along with improvements to the existing cars, Peugeot introduced a 2-door 203 coup√© at the end of 1952, although this was not as successful as hoped and quietly disappears from the brochures a year later. There were several low volume cabriolet and coup√© conversions produced by outside specialists in collaboration with Peugeot available during the 203's production run, though removing the roof from an early monocoque design necessitated extensive body strengthening which added to the car's weight and reduced the performance. For a number years the leading edge of car's nose carried an angular, forward-leaning chrome lion bonnet ornament - the lion image being Peugeot's trade mark. That was removed for 1959, due to safety concerns, and the logo was incorporated into a baguette shaped flatter emblem on the car's nose. A military variant was developed and presented to the military who showed little interest. The prototype was converted into a factory fire engine for the Peugeot plant. Engine and running gear 203 Familiale (family estate with 3 rows of seats) Peugeot 203 Cabriolet The 1290 cc four-cylinder engine was unusual in its 'oversquare' cylinder dimensions, and was noted for the hemispherical form of the combustion chambers included in the light metal cylinder heads. At launch, a power output of (41 hp) was claimed, which was increased in 1952 to (44 hp) for the October 1952 Paris Motor Show. Peugeot advertising pointed out that the increase in power came without any penalty in terms of fuel economy or car tax (which was a function of the unchanged cylinder capacity). Reference was made to a change in cylinder design but there was no change in the compression ratio which remained at 6.8:1. Advertised top speed increased, in 1952, from to : the longer estate versions were significantly slower. 0-60 time was 20 seconds, and fuel consumption was . The column-mounted gear change controlled a four- speed manual gear box: power was delivered to the rear wheels using a propeller shaft driving through a worm-and-wheel gearset at the differential. Possibly the most significant upgrade occurred in March 1954 with a new four speed gear box featuring synchromesh on all forward speeds. Cars delivered between 1949 and 1954 came without synchromesh on the bottom ratio. Suspension was independent up front byway of a transverse leaf spring, while the rear suspension was coil springs with Panhard rod. Commercial The 203 was a massive hit in France. In a move which under some conditions might be expected to have encouraged discounting of the predecessor model, the 203 was already depicted and advertised vigorously on the final page of the sales brochure distributed to potential purchasers of the Peugeot 202 in October 1947, nearly a year before the 203 could be offered for sale. There seems to have been a good deal of pent-up demand by the time the 203 was actually launched, and the practicality, price and reliability of the car wooed many motorists. 200 were coming off the production line each day by 1950, and that year the 203 achieved 34,012 domestic sales, commanding 19.5% of the French auto-market, where it was second only to the (far smaller and cheaper) Renault 4CV in terms of unit sales. Peugeot 203 Home market success was followed by the export of 203s, notably to West Germany. Six years into its production run a growing body of data on second-hand sales became available. In early 1954 it was noted that in France the 203 lost value more slowly than any other French car generally available, thanks to a combination of virtues including a reliable, economical engine, well judged equipment levels including the sun roof, good manoeuvrability helped by an unusually tight turning circle (possible because of its \\"old-fashioned\\" rear-wheel drive lay-out), and not withstanding a rather unfriendly gear box which during the summer of 1954 would be replaced by Peugeot's new all-synchromesh \\"C2\\" transmission. The strongest domestic manufacturers in the 1950s were Citro√´n and Renault who in the ten years after 1945 concentrated on different areas of the market from Peugeot. The success of the 203 was therefore a tribute both to the excellence of the product and to the absence from its sector, in its early years, of mainstream competitors. A powerful mainstream competitor appeared in 1951 with the launch of the Simca Aronde, but with the post-war economy finally beginning to experience useful growth there seems to have been ample capacity in the market for both cars. By 1955 when Panhard gained access to the Citro√´n dealership network, the 203 was well established in the market place and Peugeot themselves had moved beyond their one model policy. The 203 nevertheless continued to sell well till the end of the decade. The end The final Peugeot 203 rolled off the production line at the Peugeot Sochaux plant on Thursday, 25 February 1960. Three months later, at the end of May, the model disappeared from the price lists. A month after the production of the last 203, Peugeot launched the 403-sept which was a version of their larger newer 403 model with the smaller 7CV (7 fiscal horsepower) engine from the 203. At the time of the 203's demise, this stripped down version of the Peugeot 403 was presented as the replacement for the 203, though it could be argued that the spacious front-wheel-drive 1300 cc Peugeot 304, which appeared only in 1969, or indeed the consecutively named Peugeot 204 more directly occupied the market niche which in the early 1950s the 203 had made its own. Australian production The 203 was released on the Australian market in September 1949. The 203 was also assembled in Australia, beginning in mid 1952, and thus becoming the first Peugeot model to enter production in that country.

She trained at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. She has often played characters who fell into the trope of a dumb blonde with a high-pitched voice in the UK, notably in the Birds Eye Beefburger TV advertisements, directed by Alan Parker, in the early 1970s. She also played Trillian in the 1981 television adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Personal life Dickinson was born in Washington, D.C., and grew up in Maryland. Her father, Harold F. Searles, was a psychoanalyst, and her mother, Sylvia, was a nurse. In 1969, Dickinson met her first husband, Hugh Dickinson (whose surname she still uses as her stage name), moving to his native United Kingdom with him the following year. They were married for five years. She married the British actor Peter Davison on 26 December 1978, and they were divorced in 1994. Together they composed and performed the theme tune to the 1980s children's programme Button Moon.

It was introduced, under the brand name Pepsi Free, in 1982 by PepsiCo as the first major-brand caffeine-free cola sold in years. A sugar-free variant, originally known as Diet Pepsi Free, was also introduced. The \\"Pepsi Free\\" name itself was phased out in 1987, and today these colas are known simply as Caffeine-Free Pepsi and Caffeine-Free Diet Pepsi. Background When it was first introduced, Caffeine-Free Pepsi's label background was red, but to avoid any confusion with Coca-Cola, the background color was changed to gold in 1987. As part of Pepsi's changing their background to blue in 1998, Pepsi Caffeine Free's background changed to blue with the letters outlined in gold. In 2008, the caffeine-free version reverted to a gold background. Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola labels also have a gold background. The logo letters are bordered in red for the regular variety, in the case of the diet variety, they are entirely red in color. In popular culture Two cans of Pepsi Free are seen, at separate times, in the 1983 film Mr. Mom. Two-liter bottles and 6-packs of cans of Pepsi Free appear in a refrigerator case behind Sylvester Stallone‚Äôs character in the grocery store scene in the 1986 film Cobra. Pepsi Free was the subject of a scene in the 1985 film Back to the Future. Upon entering a caf√© in 1955, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) asks for a Tab (Coca-Cola's first version of a sugar-free soft drink, which was not available until 1963) and is told that he cannot have a \\"tab,\\" unless he orders something. He then asks for a Pepsi Free (also not available in the 1950s) and is told, \\"If you want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it!\\" (\\"Free\\" is here being mistaken for gratis.) Finally, he asks for \\"something without any sugar in it,\\" and is served black coffee. A can of Diet Pepsi Free can be seen beside Marty's alarm clock towards the beginning of the movie when Doc (Christopher Lloyd) calls him to remind him to meet him at the mall. The can is also seen toward the end of the movie when Marty wakes up in the morning at his house in 1985. When introduced, Pepsi Free was available in cans, 2 liter bottles, and 20 ounce glass bottles. Caffeine-Free Pepsi is currently available in cans, 16 oz. plastic bottles and 2 liters, though availability varies from store to store (for instance, 16 oz. bottles are typically only available in convenience stores, and some grocers may only have the product in 12 oz cans, if they carry it at all).

Kuitert in 1969 Harry M. Kuitert (November 11, 1924 in Drachten ‚Äì September 8, 2017 in Amstelveen) was a significant theologian of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands (GKN). Harry Kuitert - baptised Harminus Martinus - was a rector at Scharendijk (Zeeland) and a student pastor at Amsterdam before he became a professor of theology. In Zeeland he witnessed the great flood of 1953 which inundated large parts of this Dutch province. In 1967 he succeeded the illustrious theologian G. C. Berkouwer as professor of systematic theology at the Free University (VU) in Amsterdam, and in 1989 he retired from this chair. Kuitert in the course of his life moved from Reformed orthodoxy to Reformed middle orthodoxy following his mentor and Ph.D. supervisor Berkouwer, for whom he wrote his dissertation on the Divine Co- Humanity (Dutch: medemenselijkheid, Afrikaans: Medemenslikheid) (De mensvormigheid Gods (1962); German edition 1967). Then, after writing voluminously, critically, and yet appreciatively on Karl Barth, Kuitert later also moved on to a totally unorthodox stance on Jesus Christ, skipping neo- orthodoxy altogether. Kuitert developed his views beyond those of Berkouwer whose views seemed definitive. According to Ecumenical News International, Kuitert, after his own emeritation in 1989, and by now the most widely read theologian in the Netherlands, broke completely with Berkouwer and \\"Middle Orthodox\\" tradition (the theological mainstream of the reformed church) in his book, Jesus, the Inheritance of Christianity (1998). \\"Jesus supported the Jewish view of God, so he never saw himself as God on earth. He is not a Second God, nor the Second Person of the Holy Trinity,\\" said the 80-year-old Kuitert, adopting publicly an informal unitarian stance on the key doctrine of Christian faith, much to the grief of those who continue to love and appreciate the work of Kuitert's mentor Berkouwer. Another widely read book, both by Protestants and Catholics, is his Het algemeen betwijfeld christelijk geloof (1992), translated as I have my doubts: how to become a Christian without being a fundamentalist (1993). In this book he gives a succinct overview of the gaps he perceives between tradition, dogma, the classic Christian theological themes and the questions of people nowadays. His avowed goal is to go back to the purposes behind the classic forms of Christian doctrine in order to enable the faithful to renew and develop their faith facing the 21st century. His works have been translated into several languages. Critics have argued that this book is an exercise in refined agnosticism, and that Kuitert can no longer be properly considered a Christian theologian.

It was built to disperse exhaust gases from the Kennecott Utah Copper smelter at Garfield, Utah. Waste gases The Garfield Smelter Stack was completed in 1974, replacing several earlier smokestacks, the tallest of which was high. The extra height was needed to meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act of 1970, to disperse waste gases according to new standards. In response to new emissions limits and anticipated future state and federal standards, Outokumpu and Kennecott had conducted flash converting pilot tests from 1985 at Outokumpu's research facility in Finland. With the introduction of strict new environmental regulations in the state of Utah, the smelter's maximum permissible sulphur emission was decreased to per year from the earlier . In 1995 a new, cleaner flash smelting furnace was commissioned. By 2004, the annual average SO2 emissions from the stack were 161.5 lb/h (73 kg/h), below the permitted average annual level of 211 lb/h (96 kg/h) (with a three-hour permitted SO2 limit of 552 lb/h (250 kg/h)). The off- gases from the flash smelting furnace contain 35-40% sulfur dioxide. They are cooled and cleaned in a waste-heat boiler, electrostatic precipitator and scrubbing system before being sent to the sulfuric acid plant. The acid plant produces either 94% or 98% sulfuric acid with tail gas containing typically 50-70 ppm sulfur dioxide, resulting in a measured sulfur fixation of greater than 99.9%. In 2006 the company produced and sold approximately of sulfuric acid, made from the formerly released gas. The acid recovery plant is designed to also recover waste heat from the process to produce electrical power. Approximately 24 MW of electrical power is generated, representing 70% of the smelter‚Äôs electrical requirements. Design and construction The stack is in diameter at the bottom with walls, and rises directly from the ground. At the top it is in diameter and thick. A large fiberglass duct passes up the stack and carries gases to the top. of concrete and of steel were used in its construction. Construction commenced on August 26, 1974 and finished on November 17, an 84-day concrete pour. It cost $16.3 million at the time to build, the equivalent of $78.7 million in 2015 dollars. The top can be accessed by a Swedish-built elevator that crawls up a gear track on the inside surface. It takes 20 minutes to ascend the stack, although workers only need to travel up to the 300-foot level each day, to service the air-sampling station. The Garfield Smelter Stack is the tallest free-standing structure west of the Mississippi River, the fourth tallest smokestack in the world and the forty-third tallest free-standing structure on earth. It is the only operating smelter chimney left in Utah.

Manufactured in France by Clerget-Blin and in Great Britain by Gwynnes Limited they were used on such aircraft as the Sopwith Camel and Vickers Gunbus. In the 1920s Pierre Clerget turned his attention to diesel radial engines and finally produced a H-16 engine before he died in 1943. Rotary engine development (spark ignition) Cylinder head of a Clerget 9J, showing the two valve rockers and the induction pipe from the rear of the engine What distinguished the Clerget rotary engine from its rivals (Gnome and Le Rh√¥ne) was that the Clerget had normal intake and exhaust valves unlike the Gnome, and the connecting rod arrangement was much simpler than the Le Rhone. A source of failure among the Clerget engines were the special-purpose piston rings, called obturator rings. These were located below the gudgeon or wrist pin, to block heat transfer from the combustion area to the lower part of the cylinder and overcome their subsequent distortion. These rings were often made from brass and only had a lifespan of a few hours. The Clerget engines were considered reliable but they cost more per unit to produce than their rivals. Unlike other contemporary rotaries in which the ignition system was either switched on or off to provide a rudimentary form of engine speed control, the Clerget featured a throttle. The Bentley BR1 and Bentley BR2 rotaries were designed as improvements of the Clerget, while sharing some of the earlier engine's distinctive design features. =Design features= The Clerget rotary engines were air-cooled with either seven, nine or eleven cylinders. They were fitted with a double thrust ball race, which enabled them to be used either as a pusher or as a tractor engine. The engines worked on a four-stroke cycle. The chief points of difference from other rotary engines were: * The pistons were of an aluminium alloy. * The connecting rods had a tubular section. * The inlet and exhaust valves were mechanically operated by means of separate cams, tappets and rocker arms. The direction of rotation was counter (anti)-clockwise as seen from the propeller-end of the engine. Between any two consecutive firing strokes, the engine turned through 80 degrees. Like many other rotary engines of the period they were made chiefly of steel, for strength and lightness. =Rotary engine types= ;Clerget 7Z :(1911) 80 hp (60 kW), seven-cylinder. ;Clerget 9B :(1913) 130 hp (97 kW), nine-cylinder. ;Clerget 9Bf :(1915) 140 hp (104 kW), nine-cylinder long stroke version of the Clerget 9B.

She was a significant patron of Irish writer James Joyce. Life Harriet Shaw Weaver was born in Frodsham, Cheshire, the sixth of eight children of Frederic Poynton Weaver, a doctor, and Mary (n√©e Wright) Weaver, a wealthy heiress. She was educated privately by a governess, Miss Marion Spooner, until 1894, initially in Cheshire and later in Hampstead. Her parents denied her wish to go to university. She decided to become a social worker. After attending a course on the economic basis of social relations at the London School of Economics she became involved in women's suffrage and joined the Women's Social and Political Union. In 1911 she began subscribing to The Freewoman: A Weekly Feminist Review, a radical periodical edited by Dora Marsden and Mary Gawthorpe. The following year its proprietors withdrew their support from it and Weaver stepped in to save it from financial ruin. In 1913 it was renamed The New Freewoman. Later that year at the suggestion of the magazine's literary editor, Ezra Pound, the name was changed again to The Egoist. During the following years Weaver made more financial donations to the periodical, becoming more involved with its organisation and also becoming its editor. Ezra Pound was involved with finding new contributors and one of these was James Joyce. Weaver was convinced of his genius and started to support him, first by serialising A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in The Egoist in 1914. When Joyce could not find anyone to publish it as a book, Weaver set up the Egoist Press for this purpose at her own expense. Joyce's Ulysses was then serialised in The Egoist but because of its controversial content it was rejected by all the printers approached by Weaver and she arranged for it to be printed abroad. Weaver continued to give considerable support to Joyce and his family (approaching a million pounds in 2019 moneyAccording to Prof. Finn Fordham of Royal Holloway College, editor for Oxford Classics of Finnegans Wake, BBC Radio Three, 18 June 2019.), but following her reservations about his work that was to become Finnegans Wake, their relationship became strained and then virtually broken. However, on Joyce's death, Weaver paid for his funeral and acted as his executor. In 1931 Weaver joined the Labour Party but then, having been influenced by reading Marx's Das Kapital she joined the Communist Party in 1938. She was active in this organisation, taking part in demonstrations and selling copies of the Daily Worker. She also continued her allegiance to the memory of Joyce, acting as his literary executor and helping to compile The Letters of James Joyce. She died at her home near Saffron Walden in 1961, aged 85, leaving her collection of literary material to the British Library and to the National Book League.

Released in the United Kingdom in 1979 and in the United States in February 1980, the book was an international success. It reached No. 1 on the New York Times best- seller list. The sequel to Kane and Abel is The Prodigal Daughter, in which Florentyna Kane is the protagonist. Kane & Abel is among the top 100 best- selling books in the world, with a similar number of copies sold as To Kill a Mockingbird and Gone with the Wind. In 2003, Kane and Abel was listed at number 96 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.\\"BBC ‚Äì The Big Read\\". BBC. April 2003, Retrieved 18 November 2012 Plot summary The book tells the stories of two men born worlds apart. They have nothing in common except the same date of birth (18 April 1906 in the book, and 1901 in the miniseries based on it) and a zeal to succeed in life. William Lowell Kane is a wealthy and powerful Boston Brahmin while Abel Rosnovski (originally named W≈Çadek Koskiewicz) is a Pole who was born in a situation of great poverty and eventually migrated to the United States. William follows the steps of his father, Richard Kane, to become a successful banker. When William was still a child, Richard dies in the Titanic disaster, leaving William fatherless and heir to the Kane & Cabot bank. William displays extraordinary discipline and intelligence as a young man at St. Paul's School and later at Harvard. His mother, Anne, marries Henry Osborne, who turns out to be interested in gambling and women (One of the godparents of William). William hates Henry from the beginning and spends most of the time at Harvard and at his best friend Mathew Lester's home. William dreams of becoming the chairman of Lester's bank one day. Henry spends every last penny of Kane's mother's money on the pretext of speculation. Anonymous notes warn Anne (who has been impregnated by Osborne, a matter which causes William some worry‚Äîuntil he finds out that he can toss Henry out easily without any money) about her husband whose real name is Vitorio Tossana. She hires a detective to find out the truth, and miscarries fatally from the shock‚Äîafter which Kane ejects Henry from his home. W≈Çadek Koskiewicz is born in a forest and raised by a trapper family. When he grows up and is found to have exceptional intelligence, Baron Rosnovski asks him to become a companion to his son Leon so Wladek might prove to be a competition to him. W≈Çadek agrees to go to the Baron's castle on the condition that he can bring along his elder sister Florentyna. Soon afterwards, World War I breaks out. Germans attack Poland and capture the Baron, his staff and son in his castle. Leon dies by the hand of a soldier. Before dying, the Baron hands Wladek his silver band of authority. W≈Çadek realises that the Baron was his father when he finds that, like him, the Baron also had a missing nipple. Florentyna, W≈Çadek's beloved sister, who was now his only family, is raped 17 times and killed brutally in front of young W≈Çadek by Russian soldiers. W≈Çadek was then moved to Siberia from where he manages to escape to Turkey after facing many hardships. There he nearly loses his hand (a Hudud punishment for theft) for stealing food but is luckily rescued by two British diplomats, owing to the silver band given by Baron which he wore on the hand. They transfer him to the Polish consulate from where, with their help, he migrates to America and assumes the name Abel Rosnovski (as inscribed on the silver band). He starts his life as a waiter in the Hotel Plaza, while taking night classes in economics at Columbia University. While Abel is working there, Davis Leroy, owner of the Richmond group of hotels, is impressed by his work and appoints him manager of his flagship hotel. Abel converts the ill-managed hotel to a profit-making one and buys stock in the chain. During the Great Depression, the hotel needs a backer and Davis, unable to find one, commits suicide, leaving the remaining shares in the Richmond Group to Abel. Before committing suicide, Davis mentions that Kane & Cabot was the bank that didn't support him. Abel thus plans for revenge and considers Kane his arch rival who was responsible for the death of his closest friend. The bank gets him an anonymous backer. Abel assumes it to be David Maxton, owner of Stevens' hotel. During this time, Abel catches up with his old time friend, George Novak and marries Zaphia‚Äîboth Polish emigres he had met on the ship-journey to the United States from Turkey in his earlier life. Abel changes the name of the hotel from Richmond to Baron and builds up a successful hotel chain. By collaborating with Henry Osborne, who had by now entered politics, Abel plans to ruin Kane and his bank. Abel begets a daughter, named Florentyna in memory of his dead sister, while Kane has a son, Richard and two daughters, Virginia and Lucy. Both Kane and Abel had volunteered to serve during World War II. Abel during World War II had saved Kane's life in France, unaware of each other. He divorces Zaphia when he returns home from the war. Meanwhile Kane's bank and Lester's bank merge and a provision is made that anyone who has a share of 8% can summon board meetings. Abel tries desperately to obtain 8% of the bank's stock but Kane manages to thwart his attempts. They unknowingly meet each other many times throughout the novel. Florentyna Rosnovski, daughter of Abel Rosnovski and Richard Kane, son of William Kane, happen to meet and fall in love without knowing about the rivalry between their fathers. They get married despite vehement protests from their fathers and start a chain of boutique stores named Florentyna's. Finally, after Kane exposes Abel's dealings with Osborne and thwarts his ambition to be named Ambassador to Poland (the position goes to John Moors Cabot), Abel manages to obtain enough shares of the bank and ousts Kane from power. In 1967, Kane decides to forgive his son and daughter-in-law and expresses his wish to meet them. Both he and Abel observe the grand-opening of the New York branch Florentyna's, from outside, and they wave at each other. He dies before he is able to see them and his grandson William. Finally Jeffrey's yarn is unwoven as Abel comes to know that his backer was not David Maxton, but William Kane. Filled with remorse, he reconciles with his daughter and son-in-law. Abel dies soon after, and bequeathes everything to his daughter Florentyna, except his silver band of authority, which he leaves to his grandson, whom Florentyna and Richard have named \\"William Abel Kane\\". Adaptations In 1985 was made into a CBS television miniseries titled Kane & Abel starring Peter Strauss as Rosnovski and Sam Neill as Kane. The series was adapted into Doordarshan series Junoon which completed 510 episodes and ran for 5 years between 1994-1998. Another Indian adaptation titled Kismat (\\"Destiny\\"), produced by YRF Television, was set in Bombay in post-independent India.

Life He went into business early in Mary's reign in partnership with John Tisdale, in Holborn. He was important as one of the first printers to print Italian works in England ‚Äì the other being John Wolfe, who printed at roughly the same time as Charlewood. He was a member of the Grocers' Company until about 1574, though he took out licences to print books. From 1562 to 1593 he printed continuously and issued a very large number of books. His address was the Half-Eagle and Key in the Barbican, and in one of the Marprelate tracts it is stated that as printer to the Earl of Arundel he had a press in the Charterhouse. He was known to be one of the ring-leaders of the gang of printers who printed copies of texts to which they had no rights. His widow married James Roberts, who thus succeeded to the business. A fictitious foreign imprint of Venice helped the sales in England of a book in a foreign language. Charlewood obviously hoped that this stratagem would provide easier and increased sales for these books, which would allow the printing of a larger and more profitable edition. His hopes were apparently not realised since none of them were reprinted in Italian in Great Britain until modern times. Printed works Charlewood printed several books by Italian authors, showing the popularity of the Italian language in England at the time. Works by Giordano Bruno include: De la causa, principio, et uno (1584), De l'infinito universo et mondi (1584), De gli heroici furori (1585), and Cabala del cauallo Pegaseo (1585). These four works and two others were all published during or immediately following Bruno's visit to Oxford University. They were obviously the backlog of works which he had accumulated during his years of wandering and exile. He also printed Amorous Fiammetta (1587) by Giovanni Boccaccio, of which only 4 copies are known to exist.

Parc Prison is operated by G4S, and is the only privately operated prison in Wales. History The site was previously occupied by Parc Hospital, a psychiatric hospital. Parc Prison was procured a Private Finance Initiative contract in January 1996. The new prison, which was built by Costain Group at a cost of ¬£82 million, opened in November 1997. However, from its opening, Parc Prison was beset with problems. Failures in the prison security technology, anti-English racism from Welsh inmates, and a high number of suicides were all highlighted as concerns by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons in a 1999 report. However, in March 2001, a new report from the Chief Inspector noted a major improvement in standards. In August 2004, the Independent Monitoring Board issued a report stating that Parc Prison had been rated as the worst-performing privately run prison in Wales and England. The report criticised the lack of separate healthcare facilities for juveniles at the prison, the inadequate level of dental provision for all prisoners, and issues of staff morale. In January 2013, the Ministry of Justice announced that an additional houseblock would be constructed at Parc Prison, increasing the overall capacity of the facility. In February 2014 a prisoner was found dead in his cell at the prison. Current state Parc Prison holds Remand and Sentenced Category B Adult males, juveniles and young offenders. All cells in the prison are equipped with in-cell sanitation, natural and forced ventilation, and in-cell electrics. The prison states that all wings are equipped with hot-water boilers, PIN telephones, pool and table tennis tables, showers, laundry facilities, and association areas. Education at Parc Prison is provided by an in-house education department. A range of subjects are offered including English, maths, information technology, art, music, hospitality and languages, plus a range of vocational qualifications. Qualifications up to and including Open University courses are available. The prison's industries complex comprises nine workshops including carpentry, metalwork, graphic design and print, and industrial cleaning. All other workshops are dedicated to manufacturing contracts with local companies. Other facilities at the prison include a library, gym, fitness room, and a multi-faith chaplaincy.

They include some of the most primitive known meteorites. The C chondrites represent only a small proportion (4.6%) of meteorite falls. Some famous carbonaceous chondrites are: Allende, Murchison, Orgueil, Ivuna, Murray, Tagish Lake, and Sutter's Mill. Composition and classification Some carbonaceous chondrites. From left to right: Allende, Yukon and Murchison. Carbonaceous chondrites are grouped according to distinctive compositions thought to reflect the type of parent body from which they originated. These C chondrite groups are now each named with a standard two-letter CX designation, where C stands for \\"carbonaceous\\" (other types of chondrites do not begin with this letter) plus a capital letter in the spot X, which is very often the first letter of the name of a prominent meteorite‚Äîoften the first to be discovered‚Äîin the group. Such meteorites are often named for the place where they fell, thus giving no clue as to the physical nature of the group. Group CH, where H is for \\"high metal\\" is so far the only exception. See below for name derivations of each group. Several groups of carbonaceous chondrites, notably the CM and CI groups, contain high percentages (3% to 22%) of water, as well as organic compounds. They are composed mainly of silicates, oxides and sulfides, with the minerals olivine and serpentine being characteristic. The presence of volatile organic chemicals and water indicates that they have not undergone significant heating (>200 ¬∞C) since they were formed, and their compositions are considered to be close to that of the solar nebula from which the Solar System condensed. Other groups of C chondrites, e.g., CO, CV, and CK chondrites, are relatively poor in volatile compounds, and some of these have experienced significant heating on their parent asteroids. =CI group= This group, named after the Ivuna meteorite (Tanzania), have chemical compositions that are close to that measured in the solar photosphere (aside from gaseous elements, and elements such as lithium which are underrepresented in the Sun's photosphere by comparison to their abundance in CI chondrites). In this sense, they are chemically the most primitive known meteorites. CI chondrites typically contain a high proportion of water (up to 22%), and organic matter in the form of amino acids and PAHs. Aqueous alteration promotes a composition of hydrous phyllosilicates, magnetite, and olivine crystals occurring in a black matrix, and a possible lack of chondrules. It is thought they have not been heated above , indicating that they condensed in the cooler outer portion of the solar nebula. Six CI chondrites have been observed to fall: Ivuna, Orgueil, Alais, Tonk, Revelstoke, and Flensburg. Several others have been found by Japanese field parties in Antarctica. In general, the extreme fragility of CI chondrites causes them to be highly susceptible to terrestrial weathering, and they do not survive on Earth's surface for long after they fall. =CV group= NWA 3118, CV3 This group takes its name from Vigarano (Italy). Most of these chondrites belong to the petrologic type 3. CV chondrites observed falls: *Allende *Bali *Bukhara *Grosnaja *Kaba *Mokoia *Vigarano =CM group= The group takes its name from Mighei (Ukraine), but the most famous member is the extensively studied Murchison meteorite. Many falls of this type have been observed and CM chondrites are known to contain a rich mix of complex organic compounds such as amino-acids and purine/pyrimidine nucleobases. CM chondrite famous falls: *Murchison *Sutter's Mill *Aguas Zarcas *Jbilet Winselwan =CR group= The group takes its name from Renazzo (Italy). The best parent body candidate is 2 Pallas. CR chondrites observed falls: *Al Rais *Kaidun *Renazzo Other famous CR chondrites: *Dar al Gani 574 *El Djouf 001 *NWA 801 =CH group= \\"H\\" stands for \\"high metal\\" because CH chondrites may contain up to as much as 40% of metal. That makes them one of the most metal-rich of any of the chondrite groups, second only to the CB chondrites and some ungrouped chondrites such as NWA 12273. The first meteorite discovered was ALH 85085. Chemically, these chondrites are closely related to CR and CB groups. All specimens of this group belong only to petrologic types 2 or 3.\\"Carbonaceous chondrite\\" Meteorite.fr: All About Meteorites: Classification =CB group= Gujba meteorite, a bencubbinite found in Nigeria. Polished slice, 4.6 x 3.8 cm. Note the nickel-iron chondrules, which have been age-dated to 4.5627 billion years. The group takes its name from the most representative member: Bencubbin (Australia). Although these chondrites contain over 50% nickel-iron metal, they are not classified as mesosiderites because their mineralogical and chemical properties are strongly associated with CR chondrites. =CK group= This group takes its name from Karoonda (Australia). These chondrites are closely related to the CO and CV groups. =CO group= The group takes its name from Ornans (France). The chondrule size is only about 0.15 mm on average. They are all of petrologic type 3\\\\. Famous CO chondrite falls: *Ornans *Kainsaz *Warrenton *Moss Famous finds: *Dar al Gani 749 =C ungrouped= The most famous members: *Tagish Lake Organic matter Murchison meteorite Ehrenfreund et al. (2001) found that amino acids in Ivuna and Orgueil were present at much lower concentrations than in CM chondrites (~30%), and that they had a distinct composition high in Œ≤-alanine, glycine, Œ≥-ABA, and Œ≤-ABA but low in Œ±-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) and isovaline. This implies that they had formed by a different synthetic pathway, and on a different parent body from the CM chondrites. Most of the organic carbon in CI and CM carbonaceous chondrites is an insoluble complex material. That is similar to the description for kerogen.

Like gymnemic acid, it is a sweet inhibitor or taste modifier.  Chemistry  Chemically, lactisole is the sodium salt of 2-(4-methoxyphenoxy)propionic acid.  Natural occurrences  This acid has been isolated from roasted Colombian arabica coffee beans. Anti-sweet properties At concentrations of 100-150 parts per million in food, lactisole largely suppresses the ability to perceive sweet tastes, both from sugar and from artificial sweeteners such as aspartame. A 12% sucrose solution was perceived like a 4% sucrose solution when lactisole was added. However, it is significantly less efficient than gymnemic acid with acesulfame potassium, sucrose, glucose and sodium saccharin. Research found also that it has no effect on the perception of bitterness, sourness and saltiness. According to a recent study, lactisole acts on a sweet taste receptor heteromer of the TAS1R3 sweet protein receptor in humans, but not on its rodent counterpart. As a food additive The principal use of lactisole is in jellies, jams, and similar preserved fruit products containing large amounts of sugar. In these products, by suppressing sugar's sweetness, it allows fruit flavors to come through. In the United States, lactisole is designated as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (Fema number: 3773) and approved for use in food as flavoring agentJECFA \\"Specifications for Flavourings\\" up to 150 ppm.

It combines physics, AI, and genetic algorithms to create realistic animations. Unlike Euphoria, also developed by NaturalMotion, Endorphin is not an engine, but a 3D animation tool for Microsoft Windows. At the heart of the software is an adaptive behaviors module which assigns context-sensitive motions to characters based on their surroundings --- for example, football players could be programmed to automatically tackle when near another player, or a swordsman could swing to attack nearby enemies. This automatic behaviour generation differentiates the software from competitors, and reduces the burden on animators to individually select behaviours for each agent in a large scene. Registered users on Naturalmotion's website can attain a free learning edition of Endorphin, however it lacks the feature to export the animation to popular CAD Software, a feature only available in the full version of the program. It has been used in movies and video games such as Troy, Poseidon and Tekken 5. As of 2014, Endorphin is no longer supported by NaturalMotion.

It was written by Dennis Spooner and directed by Henric Hirsch. In the serial, the First Doctor (William Hartnell), his granddaughter Susan (Carole Ann Ford), and teachers Ian Chesterton (William Russell) and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) arrive in France during the period of the French Revolution known as the Reign of Terror, where they become involved with prisoners and English spies. Initially interested in writing a science fiction story, Spooner was asked to write a historical serial by script editor David Whitaker. He eventually decided to focus on the French Revolution, a setting first suggested by Russell. Hirsch underwent great stress during the serial's production; he collapsed during filming of the third episode, and was replaced until the following week. The serial premiered with 6.9 million viewers, maintaining audience figures throughout the six weeks. Response for the serial was mixed, with criticism aimed at the story and historical inaccuracies. Two of the six episodes remain missing after the BBC wiped them from archives. It later received several print adaptations and home media releases, with animated versions of the missing episodes constructed using off-air recordings. Plot The First Doctor (William Hartnell), his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) and her teachers Ian Chesterton (William Russell) and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) arrive outside Paris in 18th-century France and venture to a nearby farmhouse. They find it is being used as a staging post in an escape chain for counter- revolutionaries during the Reign of Terror. They are discovered by two counter-revolutionaries, D'Argenson (Neville Smith) and Rouvray (Laidlaw Dalling), who knock the Doctor unconscious and hold the others at gunpoint. A band of revolutionary soldiers surrounds the house and both D'Argenson and Rouvray are killed during the siege. The soldiers capture Ian, Barbara, and Susan and march them to Paris to be guillotined. The soldiers set fire to the farmhouse, and the Doctor is saved by a young boy (Peter Walker), who tells him that his friends have been taken to the Conciergerie Prison in Paris. He sets off after them. Ian, Barbara, and Susan are all sentenced to death as traitors. Ian is confined in one cell, while the women are taken to another. Ian's cellmate is an Englishman named Webster (Jeffry Wickham), who tells him that there is an English spy, James Stirling, highly placed in the French Government, who is now being recalled to England. Webster dies, and a government official named Lemaitre (James Cairncross) arrives and probes any conversation between Ian and the dead man. Lemaitre crosses Ian's name off the execution list. En route to the guillotine, Barbara and Susan's transport is hijacked by two men, Jules (Donald Morley) and Jean (Roy Herrick), who take them to a safe house. They are told that they will be smuggled out of France through the escape chain. Jules and Jean reassure Barbara that they will try to reunite them with Ian and the Doctor. They are then joined by another counter-revolutionary, named L√©on Colbert (Edward Brayshaw). The Doctor reaches Paris and exchanges his clothes for those of a Regional Officer of the Provinces. He heads for the Conciergerie, but finds his companions gone; Ian has successfully stolen the key to his cell and escaped. Lemaitre arrives and takes the Doctor to visit Maximilien Robespierre (Keith Anderson) to report on his province. Ian follows Webster's words and finds Jules Renan, who turns out to be the man sheltering Barbara and Susan; the latter is ill in bed. When Barbara takes Susan to a physician (Ronald Pickup), they are recaptured by revolutionary police. Ian meets Colbert only to find he is the mole in the escape chain and there are armed troops waiting for him. Jules rescues Ian, killing Colbert in the process. They return to Jules' house and are stunned to meet Barbara. The Doctor has returned to the Conciergerie, where Lemaitre reports that Robespierre wishes to see him again the following day. Lemaitre ensures that the Doctor spends the night in the Conciergerie in order that he remain in Paris for his second audience with Robespierre. He is still there when Barbara and Susan are brought in as prisoners. With Susan too weak to be moved, he engineers Barbara's release on the pretext that she can be trailed to lead the security forces to the core of the escape chain. Robespierre suspects his deputy, Paul Barras (John Law), is conspiring against him and asks Lemaitre to track Barras to a secret assignation at an inn outside the city. When Lemaitre heads back to the Conciergerie, he privately unmasks the Doctor as an impostor. Lemaitre insists that the Doctor help him find Jules's house. With Susan held in the prison as a hostage, the Doctor takes him to Jules. Once there, Lemaitre reveals that he is in fact the English spy James Stirling. In response, Ian relays Webster's message and Stirling realises that the secret assignation at an inn on the Calais Road is where the conspiracy will take place. Jules, Ian and Barbara head to the inn and overhear Barras conspire with a young general, Napoleon Bonaparte (Tony Wall), in the indictment and overthrow of Robespierre. The following day, Stirling arranges Susan's release from prison. The coup against Robespierre has begun. Stirling heads for Calais and England, while Jules and Jean lie low as they measure the future. Meanwhile, the Doctor and his companions return to the TARDIS.  Production  = Conception and writing = In late 1963, the eighth serial of Doctor Who was set to be titled Doctor Who and the Red Fort, a seven-part story set during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and written by Terry Nation. However, by January 1964, little work had been done on the serial, and Nation was busy writing The Keys of Marinus. Script editor David Whitaker was later assigned to the episode, possibly about the Spanish Armada, with Gerald Blake to direct; however, this was soon scrapped, and Whitaker asked Dennis Spooner, a friend of Nation, to write an episode instead. Although Spooner was originally interested in writing a science fiction story, Whitaker was seeking a historical serial after John Lucarotti's Marco Polo and The Aztecs. Spooner was given four possible subjects, eventually deciding to focus on the French Revolution, a setting first suggested by actor William Russell. Spooner was officially commissioned by Whitaker on 2 April 1964, following Spooner's submission of a 23-page breakdown for the serial. Hungarian director Henric Hirsch was chosen to direct the serial after producer Verity Lambert saw his work on First Night, while Stanley Myers composed the serial's incidental music. Myers created 28 minutes of music for the serial, taking cues from French music such as the national anthem \\"La Marseillaise\\". = Characters and casting = Actor and lyricist James Cairncross portrayed Citizen Lemaitre, having been recommended to Hirsch by production assistant Timothy Combe, recalling his stage performances. The Conciergerie jailer was played by Jack Cunningham, who was also suggested by Combe. Spooner created the jailer character to add humour to the serial's heavy plot. Combe also recommended Neville Smith as D'Argenson and John Barrard as the shopkeeper, after working with both on Z-Cars, as well as Roy Herrick as Jean, having attended drama school together, and Tony Wall as Napoleon after seeing his theatre work. Donald Morley, cast as Jules Renan, previously performed alongside Jacqueline Hill in The Shrike, while Peter Walker, cast as the young child, featured in Hirsch's television play Bloomsday. Ronald Pickup, who played the physician, heard about the role from his friend Frank Cox, director of previous serial The Sensorites. Keith Anderson, cast as Maximilien Robespierre, had written to Hirsch prior to his casting, mentioning his appearance in an episode of Sergeant Cork. = Filming = Outdoor filming for the second episode‚Äîa first for the show‚Äîtook place on 15 June 1964. Led by cameraman Peter Hamilton, a crew shot inserts of the Doctor, played by Brian Proudfoot in William Hartnell's absence, walking to Paris; Denham, Buckinghamshire was selected as the location by Combe due to the \\"French-looking\\" lanes, particularly the avenues lined with tall trees. Inserts of Russell for the second and third episodes were recorded at Ealing Studios Stage 3A from 16‚Äì17 June, in preparation for Russell's holiday. Further inserts were recorded on 18 June at Ealing Studios Stage 3. Rehearsals for the first episode took place from 6‚Äì9 July. Hirsch had a difficult time working with Hartnell, partly because he was a foreigner, as well as his nervousness as a director. Weekly recording for the serial began on 10 July at Lime Grove Studio G. Planning for his other projects and difficulty with rehearsals led Hirsch to feel unwell, and he collapsed during filming on the third episode. Lambert placed Combe in charge until a replacement director could be found; documentation indicates that John Gorrie, director of The Keys of Marinus, oversaw production of the third episode, though Gorrie has no memory of the event. Following discussions with Combe, Hartnell became more understanding towards Hirsch's situation; Hirsch returned to direct the final three episodes at the Television Centre, Studio 4, splitting some of the workload with Combe. Educational film company Gateway Films provided 80 feet of silent 35 mm footage from the film The French Revolution for the final episode.  Reception  = Broadcast and ratings = Episode is missing The Reign of Terror received smaller audiences than previous serials due to the warmer weekends, but still maintained a position within the top 40 shows for the week. The first episode was broadcast on BBC1 on 8 August 1964, and was watched by 6.9 million viewers. The following two episodes maintained these figures, despite the latter's shift to the later time of 5:30pm. The fourth episode was broadcast at 5:15pm (due to coverage of the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo) to 6.4 million viewers, while the final two episodes again shifted to 5:30pm to 6.9 and 6.4 million viewers, respectively. The Appreciation Index dropped slightly over the six episodes: the first received 58, while the second and third received 54 and 55, respectively; the fourth and fifth episodes received 53, before rising to 55 for the final episode. The score of 53 was the lowest for the show at the time, but still considered reasonable. The original master tapes for episodes 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 were wiped on 17 August 1967, and the master tape for episode 4 was wiped on 31 January 1969. The telerecording prints of the serial were junked by BBC Enterprises in 1972. The sixth episode was returned to the BBC by a private collector in May 1982, and the first three episodes were located at the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation (CyBC) in late 1984. The fourth and fifth episodes remain missing, existing only as off-air audio recordings from 1964; the CyBC's copies were stored in a vault but destroyed in a bomb attack during the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus. The existing episodes were screened as part of the National Film Theatre's Bastille Day schedule on 14 July 1999, with links between the episodes by Carole Ann Ford. = Critical response = The serial was criticised for its historical inaccuracy. MMG Oborski, secretary of the Napoleon I Society, wrote that the BBC \\"has a certain duty to educate, or at least not to misinform children\\", citing the serial's fictional depiction of a meeting between Napoleon and Paul Barras to overthrow Robespierre. In response to another complaint about the English accents used in the serial in September 1964, Whitaker explained that \\"there is nothing worse than Frenchmen speaking in broken English to each other\\". Writing for the Daily Worker, Stewart Lane described the serial as a \\"half- baked royalist adventure\\". Retrospective reviews of the serial were mixed. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times wrote positively of the humour and Hartnell's increased role, but felt that Susan was \\"at her weakest\\". SFXs Ian Berriman felt that the serial is \\"really rather dull\\" after the first episode, noting that it assumes the audience is aware of the history of the French Revolution. Christopher Bahn of The A.V. Club stated, after a compelling beginning, the serial \\"[stretches] too little story over too many episodes\\", criticising the plot for \\"retreading the same basic plot\\".  Commercial releases  =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Ian Marter, was published in hardback by W. H. Allen in March 1987, with artwork by Tony Masero. The paperback version was published by Target Books in August 1987. An audio version of this serial was released on CD by BBC Audio in February 2006, with Ford providing linking narration and an interview. This was later included in The Lost TV Episodes: Collection 1 box set in August 2010, alongside an additional CD with interviews and original camera scripts. =Home media= The serial was released on VHS by BBC Video in November 2003, containing the four existing episodes of The Reign of Terror alongside unreleased episodes of The Faceless Ones and The Web of Fear. 2 Entertain released the serial on DVD in January 2013, with animation of the missing episodes by Theta Sigma and Big Finish Productions; the release featured several special features, including audio commentary and documentaries. Ian Jane of DVD Talk praised the detail of the animation.

Career Jerry Goodman was born on March 16, 1949, in Chicago, Illinois. His parents were both members of the string section of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and his uncle was the noted composer and jazz pianist Marty Rubenstein. Jerry was trained in a conservatory before he began his musical career as The Flock's roadie and subsequently as a violinist. After his 1971 appearance on John McLaughlin's album My Goal's Beyond, he became a member of McLaughlin's original Mahavishnu Orchestra lineup until the band broke up in 1973, and was viewed as a soloist of equal virtuosity to McLaughlin, keyboardist Jan Hammer and drummer Billy Cobham. In 1975, after Mahavishnu, Goodman recorded the album Like Children with Mahavishnu keyboard alumnus Jan Hammer. Starting in 1985 he recorded three solo albums for Private Music -- On the Future of Aviation, Ariel, and the live album It's Alive with luminaries such as Fred Simon and Jim Hines‚Äîand went on tour with his own band, as well as with Shadowfax and The Dixie Dregs. He scored Lily Tomlin's The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe and is the featured violinist on numerous film soundtracks, including Billy Crystal's Mr. Saturday Night and Steve Martin's Dirty Rotten Scoundrels . His violin can be heard on more than fifty albums from artists ranging from Toots Thielemans to Hall & Oates to Styx to Jordan Rudess to Choking Ghost to Derek Sherinian. Goodman has appeared on four of Sherinian's solo records - Inertia (2001), Black Utopia (2003), Mythology (2004), and Blood of the Snake (2006) In 1993, Goodman joined the American instrumental band, The Dixie Dregs, fronted by guitarist Steve Morse. Goodman appeared on one studio recording Full Circle (1994), and the live album \\"California Screamin'\\" (2000). In 1996 Session violist and producer Ray Tischer featured Goodman on the award-winning CD Canciones del Sol/Britt Bossa Orchestra (band)Ray Tischer violist/producer on Tischer's original instrumental Toca del Angel.
