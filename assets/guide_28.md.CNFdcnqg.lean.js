He was well known for his jazz-influenced, proto-pop art paintings of the 1940s and 1950s, bold, brash, and colorful, as well as his Ashcan School pictures in the early years of the 20th century. With the belief that his work could influence the sociopolitical environment of America, Davis' political message was apparent in all of his pieces from the most abstract to the clearest.Patterson, J. (2009). Stuart Davis's painting and politics in the 1930s. The Burlington Magazine, 151465‚Äì468. Contrary to most modernist artists, Davis was aware of his political objectives and allegiances and did not waver in loyalty via artwork during the course of his career. By the 1930s, Davis was already a famous American painter, but that did not save him from feeling the negative effects of the Great Depression, which led to his being one of the first artists to apply for the Federal Art Project. Under the project, Davis created some seemingly Marxist works; however, he was too independent to fully support Marxist ideals and philosophies. Despite several works that appear to reflect the class struggle, Davis' roots in American optimism is apparent throughout his lifetime.  Life and career  Stuart Davis was born on December 7, 1892, in Philadelphia to Edward Wyatt Davis, art editor of The Philadelphia Press, and Helen Stuart Davis, sculptor.Passantino, p 441 Starting in 1909, Davis began his formal art training under Robert Henri, the leader of the Ashcan School, at the Robert Henri School of Art in New York under 1912.Cooper, Philip. Cubism. London: Phaidon, 1995, p. 120. During this time, Davis befriended painters John Sloan, Glenn Coleman and Henry Glintenkamp. In 1913, Davis was one of the youngest painters to exhibit in the Armory Show, where he displayed five watercolor paintings in the Ashcan school style.C√©cile Whiting, \\"Stuart Davis\\", Oxford Art Online In the show, Davis was exposed to the works of a number of artists including Vincent van Gogh, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso. Davis became a committed \\"modern\\" artist and a major exponent of cubism and modernism in America. He spent summers painting in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and made painting trips to Havana in 1918 and New Mexico in 1923. After spending several years emulating artists in the Armory Show, Davis started moving toward a signature style with his 1919 Self-Portrait, in the collection of the Amon Carter Museum of American Art. In the 1920s he began his development into his mature style; painting abstract still lifes and landscapes. His use of contemporary subject matter such as cigarette packages and spark plug advertisements suggests a proto-pop art element to his work. Among Davis' practices was his use of previous paintings. Elements of harbor scenes he painted in Gloucester, Massachusetts can be found in a number of subsequent works. Another practice was painting series, works with similar structures, but with altered colors or added geometric embellishments, essentially creating variations on a theme. Some commentators suggest that this aspect of his work parallels his love of jazz in which a basic chord structure is improvised upon by the musicians. In 1928, he visited Paris, France for a year, where he painted street scenes. In 1929, while in Paris, he married his American girlfriend, Bessie Chosak. In the 1930s, he became increasingly politically engaged; according to C√©cile Whiting, Davis' goal was to \\"reconcile abstract art with Marxism and modern industrial society\\". In 1934 he joined the Artists' Union; he was later elected its President. In 1936 the American Artists' Congress elected him National Secretary. He painted murals for Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration that are influenced by his love of jazz. US postage stamp of 1964 featuring 'Detail Study for Cliche' by Stuart Davis In 1932 Davis was devastated by the loss of his wife, Bessie Chosak Davis who died after complications from a botched abortion. Also in 1932 Davis executed a mural commission for Radio City Music Hall which the Rockefeller Center Art Committee named \\"Men Without Women\\" (after Ernest Hemingway's second collection of short stories completed the same year). According to Hilton Kramer in a 1975 piece on the work in the New York Times the artist was happy neither with the location in which the mural was placed or the title it was givenKramer, Hilton.

The New York Times. https://www.rockefellercenter.com/blog/2016/08/30/stuart-davis-whitney/ In 1938, Davis married Roselle Springer and spent his late life teaching at the New York School for Social Research and at Yale University. From 1945‚Äì1951, Davis worked on The Mellow Pad, an abstract work inspired by jazz music. In 1947‚Äì52, two works by Stuart Davis, For internal use only (1945) and Composition (1863) (c. 1930) were featured in the Painting toward architecture crossover art and design exhibition, in 28 venues.Preece, R. J. (July / August 2017). Rethinking Painting toward architecture (1947‚Äì52). Sculpture magazine / artdesigncafe. Retrieved March 22, 2020. He was represented by Edith Gregor Halpert at the Downtown Gallery in New York City. One of his last paintings, Blips and Ifs, created between 1963 and 1964, is in the collection of the Amon Carter Museum of American Art. The US Post Office in 1964 issued a stamp featuring 'Detail Study for Cliche' by Davis. Davis died of a stroke in New York on June 24, 1964, aged 71.  Style  Davis' interactions with European modernist works in 1913 had a significant impact on his growth as an artist. The realist Robert Henri had trained Davis to paint in a realist fashion since Davis' youth, however Davis' excursion with European modernists caused him to raise the modernist flag instead. Stuart Davis did not switch to modernism out of spite for Henri, but rather out of appreciation for the many forms of art that exist. The love and adoption of European modernism morphed into political and social isolationism that was a staple of American [...] in the 1920s and 1930s. Davis never joined an art group during the 1920s and became the sole author of Cubism which used abstract colors and shapes to show various dynamics of the American cultural and political environment. From 1915 to 1919, Davis spent summers in Massachusetts where his art work had intense color palettes paired with simple designs, trademarks of several artists that Davis admired at the Armory Show. The early 1920s saw many American artists abandon modern art, but Davis continued to try to discover ways to implement his knowledge of shapes and colors into his art work. By the end of the 1920s, Davis had done more work and research into Cubism and its various levels of sophistication than any other American artist at the time. During the 1930s and 1940s, Davis attempted to make is work with Cubism altered and more original. While working on several murals for the Federal Art Project, Davis tried to find alternatives to traditional Cubist structure. The emergence of Abstract Expressionism in the 1940s made some question whether Davis was still the greatest modernist in the country; however, this test did not shake his resolve as he continued to develop his own painting style.  Mentors  Davis was first professionally trained by Robert Henri, an American realist. Henri began teaching Davis in 1909. Henri did not look highly upon American art institutions at the time, which led to him joining John Sloan and six other anti-institutional artists (known as \\"the Eight\\") to put on an exhibit at the Macbeth Gallery in 1908. Through his vocal rejection of academic norms in painting, Henri encouraged Davis and his other students to find new forms and ways to express their art and to draw on their daily lives for inspiration.  Inspirations  Davis was born during the Progressive Era, a time when America had a growing sense of optimism about itself as a nation through its technologies and management in the material and social realm. Through this, Davis had a great sense of pride in being American and led to him creating several works centered on a \\"Great America\\". After his training from Henri, Davis would walk around the streets of New York City for inspiration for his works. His time amongst the public caused him to develop a strong social conscience which was strengthened through his friendship with John Sloan, another anti-institutional artist. Additionally, Davis frequented the 1913 Armory Show (in which he exhibited his work), to further educate himself on modernism and its evolving trends. Davis acquired an appreciation and knowledge on how to implement the formal and color advancements of European modernism, something Henri did not focus on, to his art. In 1925, the Soci√©t√© Anonyme put on an exhibit in New York with several pieces by the French artist Fernand L√©ger. Davis had a large amount of respect for L√©ger because like Davis, L√©ger sought the utmost formal clarity in his work. Davis also appreciated L√©ger's work for the subject matter: storefronts, billboard and other man-made objects. In the early 1930s after returning from a trip to Europe to visit several art studios, Davis was re-energized in his identity in his specific work. Previously, he saw Europe as a place bursting at the seams with talented artists, but now he felt as if he was of the same caliber if not greater than his European counterparts. According to Davis, his trip \\"allowed me to observe the enormous vitality of the American atmosphere as compared to Europe and made me regard the necessity of working in New York as a positive advantage.\\"  Quotes  \\"The act of painting is not a duplication of experience, but the extension of experience on the plane of formal invention.\\" \\"[Modern art] is a reflection of the positive progressive fact of modern industrial technology.\\" \\"I don't want people to copy Matisse or Picasso, although it is entirely proper to admit their influence. I don't make paintings like theirs. I make paintings like mine.\\" \\"It was amber.\\" Public collections Among the public collections holding work by Stuart Davis are: *Addison Gallery of American Art (Andover, Massachusetts) *Amon Carter Museum of American Art (Texas) *Art Gallery of the University of Rochester (New York) *Art Institute of Chicago *Block Museum of Art (Northwestern University, Illinois) *Brooklyn Museum (New York City) *Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) *Cleveland Museum of Art *Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art (Arkansas) *Currier Museum of Art (New Hampshire) *Dallas Museum of Art (Texas) *Dayton Art Institute (Ohio) *Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco *Robert Hull Fleming Museum (University of Vermont) *Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art (University of Oklahoma) *Harvard University Art Museums *Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (Washington, D.C.) *Honolulu Museum of Art *the Hyde Collection (Glens Falls, New York) *Indiana University Art Museum (Bloomington, Indiana) *Johnson Museum of Art (Cornell University, Ithaca, New York) *Krannert Art Museum (University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, Champaign, Illinois) *Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art (Kansas City, Missouri) *Maier Museum of Art (Randolph-Macon Woman's College, Virginia) *Metropolitan Museum of Art *Montclair Art Museum (New Jersey) *Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (Texas) *Museum of Modern Art (New York City) *National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) *National Portrait Gallery (Washington, D.C.) *Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art (Kansas City, Missouri) *Nevada Museum of Art *Norton Museum of Art (West Palm Beach, Florida) *Oklahoma City Museum of Art (Oklahoma) *Orange County Museum of Art (Newport Beach, California) *Palazzo Ruspoli (Rome) *Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (Philadelphia) *The Phillips Collection (Washington, D.C.) *Pierpont Morgan Library (New York City) *Pomona College Museum of Art (California) *Portland Museum of Art (Maine) *San Diego Museum of Art (California) *Sheldon Art Gallery (Lincoln, Nebraska) *Smithsonian American Art Museum (Washington, D.C.) *Springfield Museum of Art (Ohio) *Tacoma Art Museum (Washington) *Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum (Madrid) *U.S. Library of Congress (Washington, D.C.) *University of Kentucky Art Museum *Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (Richmond) *Wadsworth Atheneum (Hartford) *Walker Art Center (Minnesota) *Westmoreland Museum of American Art (Greensburg, Pennsylvania) *Whitney Museum of American Art (New York City) *Yale University Art Gallery (Connecticut) Selected works Image:Davis_garage_no_1.jpgGarage No. 1, 1917, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, DC.

It is a weak copyleft license, characterized as a middle ground between permissive software licenses and the GNU General Public License (GPL), that seeks to balance the concerns of proprietary and open-source developers. As such, it allows re-licensing. MPL software can thus be converted into a copyleft license such as the GPL or to a proprietary license (example: KaiOS). It has undergone two revisions: a minor update to version 1.1, and a major update to version 2.0 with the goals of greater simplicity and better compatibility with other licenses. The MPL is the license for Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Thunderbird, and most other Mozilla software, but it has been used by others, such as Adobe to license their Flex product line, and The Document Foundation to license LibreOffice 4.0 (also on LGPL 3+). Version 1.1 was adapted by several projects to form derivative licenses like Sun Microsystems' own Common Development and Distribution License. Terms The MPL defines rights as passing from \\"contributors\\", who create or modify source code, through an optional auxiliary distributor (itself a licensee), to the licensee. It grants liberal copyright and patent licenses allowing for free use, modification, distribution, and \\"exploit[ation]\\" of the work, but does not grant the licensee any rights to a contributor's trademarks. These rights will terminate if the licensee fails to comply with the license's terms and conditions, but a violating licensee who returns to compliance regains its rights, and even receiving written notice from a contributor will result in losing rights to that contributor's code only. A patent retaliation clause, similar to that of the Apache License, is included to protect an auxiliary distributor's further recipients against patent trolling. The contributors disclaim warranty and liability, but allow auxiliary distributors to offer such things on their own behalf. In exchange for the rights granted by license, the licensee must meet certain responsibilities concerning the distribution of licensed source code. Covered source code files must remain under the MPL, and distributors \\"may not attempt to alter or restrict recipients' rights\\" to it. The MPL treats the source code file as the boundary between MPL-licensed and proprietary parts, meaning that all or none of the code in a given source file falls under the MPL. An executable consisting solely of MPL-covered files may be sublicensed, but the licensee must ensure access to or provide all the source code within it. Recipients can combine licensed source code with other files under a different, even proprietary license, thereby forming a \\"larger work\\" which can be distributed under any terms, but again the MPL-covered source files must be made freely available. This makes the MPL a compromise between the MIT or BSD licenses, which permit all derived works to be relicensed as proprietary, and the GPL, which requires the derived work as a whole to be licensed under the GPL. By allowing proprietary modules in derived projects while requiring core files to remain open source, the MPL is designed to motivate both businesses and the open-source community to help develop core software. The one exception to covered source files remaining under the MPL occurs when code under version 2.0 or later is combined with separate code files under the GNU GPL, GNU Lesser GPL (LGPL), or GNU Affero GPL (AGPL). In this case, the program as a whole will be under the chosen GNU license, but the MPL-covered files will be dual-licensed, so that recipients can choose to distribute them under that GNU License or the MPL. The initial author of MPL code may choose to opt out of this GPL compatibility by adding a notice to its source files. It is explicitly granted that MPL-covered code may be distributed under the terms of the license version under which it was received or any later version. If code under version 1.0 or 1.1 is upgraded to version 2.0 by this mechanism, the 1.x-covered code must be marked with the aforementioned GPL-incompatible notice. The MPL can be modified to form a new license, provided that said license does not refer to Mozilla or Netscape. History Version 1.0 of the MPL was written by Mitchell Baker in 1998 while working as a lawyer at Netscape Communications Corporation. Netscape was hoping that an open-source strategy for developing its own Netscape web browser would allow it to compete better with Microsoft's browser, Internet Explorer. To cover the browser's code, the company drafted a license known as the Netscape Public License (NPL), which included a clause allowing even openly developed code to be theoretically relicensed as proprietary. However, at the same time, Baker developed a second license similar to the NPL. It was called the Mozilla Public License after Netscape's project name for the new open-source codebase, and, although it was originally only intended for software that supplemented core modules covered by the NPL, it would become much more popular than the NPL and eventually earn approval from the Open Source Initiative. Less than a year later, Baker and the Mozilla Organization would make some changes to the MPL, resulting in version 1.1, a minor update. This revision was done through an open process that considered comments from both institutional and individual contributors. The primary goals were to clarify terms regarding patents and allow for multiple licensing. This last feature was meant to encourage cooperation with developers that preferred stricter licenses like the GPL. Not only would many projects derive their own licenses from this version, but its structure, legal precision, and explicit terms for patent rights would strongly influence later revisions of popular licenses like the GPL (version 3). Both versions 1.0 and 1.1 are incompatible with the GPL, which led the Free Software Foundation to discourage using version 1.1. For these reasons, earlier versions of Firefox were released under multiple licenses: the MPL 1.1, GPL 2.0, and LGPL 2.1. Some old software, such as the Mozilla Application Suite, is still under the three licenses. Therefore, in early 2010, after more than a decade without modification, an open process for creating version 2.0 of the MPL began. Over the next 21 months, the MPL was not only changed to make the license clearer and easier to apply, but also to achieve compatibility with the GPL and Apache licenses. The revision team was overseen by Baker and led by Luis Villa with key support from Gervase Markham and Harvey Anderson. They would publish three alpha drafts, two beta drafts, and two release candidates for comment before releasing the final draft of version 2.0 on January 3, 2012.

He has been performing throughout the United States and Europe since 1993. Davis regularly works with music producer Alex Gibson, who produced his last five studio albums. In 2009, TV channel HDNet broadcast the first six-episode season of \\"Sex, God, Rock 'n Roll\\", a comedy sketch show written, directed, and hosted by Davis; a second season with Davis and co-host Kandyse McClure began airing in 2012. Davis is a contributing member of philosopher Ken Wilber's Integral Institute, and appears as a fictionalized character in Wilber's novel Boomeritis. His single Already Free (2008) was featured as the end theme of the Showtime series I Can't Believe I'm Still Single, and was also used in the feature film Drillbit Taylor. A precursor to the HDNet series \\"Sex, God, Rock 'n Roll\\" existed in the form of a 12-part web series, The Stuart Davis Show (2007), select episodes of which were co-written with Steven Brill. Ken Wilber has called Davis \\"the finest singer/songwriter of his generation\\" Early life Stuart Evan Davis was born in Des Moines, Iowa in 1971, the youngest of three brothers. His family moved to Lakeville, Minnesota when he was a young boy, and he was formally introduced to music when his father got him a guitar and taught him three chords. By the time he had graduated high school he'd recorded his first album and was soon playing shows around Minnesota. Early influences include: Elvis Costello, Richard Thompson, XTC, and Bob Dylan. Musical career =1990s= The first two albums in the Stuart Davis catalogue, Idiot Express and Big Energy Dream, are social and romantic critiques featuring simple acoustic guitar progressions and minimal instrumentation characteristic of folk music. His third release, Self-Untitled, received airplay on some alternative and public stations with the songs \\"Universe Communion\\" and \\"Only Changing Drugs\\". With his fourth album, Nomen Est Numen, Davis shed his folk roots. The music featured driving bass lines, electric guitars, and richer vocal harmonies characteristic of alternative/pop, and lyrically it was more intellectual and subversive. Between Nomen Est Numen and his fifth album, Kid Mystic, two important events happened to Davis. First, he was introduced to Zen Buddhism by his drummer Dave King, and became a practitioner of zazen, or sitting meditation. The second was his discovery of the book Sex, Ecology, Spirituality, by Ken Wilber. Their influence would soon send Davis on an entirely new trajectory. As the title implies, on Kid Mystic Davis begins to explore some ethereal territory. The pace and structure of the songs are much different, and the lyrics are more image-conscious and laced with metaphor. Death and dying play a major role, implicitly or explicitly, on a majority of the tracks, and instead of playing as simply a collection of songs, it is more a unitive work. The tagline of his subsequent studio album, Bright Apocalypse, is \\"13 Songs About God,\\" and uses some of the same structural and thematic material. The thirteen songs construct a sort of dialogue with the divine; much of the album is sung in second person, and in several of the songs the divine speaks back in whispers. =2000s= His eponymous seventh album, popularly known as the Silver Album or Silver/Naked, for its cover art featuring a nude Davis adorned in silver paint, is built around a trilogy of songs that close the album called \\"Dive\\", \\"Swim\\", and \\"Drown\\". They were inspired by the book Grace and Grit, another work by Ken Wilber, and \\"tell the story of a soul going back home.\\" The album also contains the song \\"Ladder\\", which is featured as the bumper music on Wilber's audio program Kosmic Consciousness. Beginning in 2003 Davis began working with Alex Gibson, who produced that year's Bell. Gibson was able to procure the services of world-renowned drummer Abe Laboriel Jr. (Lady Gaga, Paul McCartney, Paul Simon), and Davis's affiliation with Gibson would continue to give him access to some of the most accomplished session musicians in the industry. Bell was followed by ¬øWhat, a radical sonic departure in the Davis discography, which features performance poetry by Saul Williams on \\"April Showers, April Tears\\", beat-boxing on \\"Easter\\", house- influenced synth bass lines on \\"Dirty Purity\\", dissonant sampled loops on \\"Voodoo Dolls\\", and the spare, haiku-like \\"Glass\\". ¬øWhat is filled with haunting effects and vocals throughout, and features songs mostly composed of sampled loops and sequenced rhythms. He expressed the wish to make a video with actress Parker Posey for his song \\"Parker Posey\\", which tells the story about a condescending director pitching a movie role to Posey that is beneath her ability, so he can break her into the upper echelon of Hollywood A-list actresses. His next album, Something Simple, leads off with the single \\"Already Free\\", which was featured as the end theme of the Showtime series I Can't Believe I‚Äôm Still Single, and was also used in the movie Drillbit Taylor. It peaked at 154 on the Billboard singles chart in 2008. Davis worked with a new roster of musicians for this project, including Wendy Melvoin on guitar, Ed Kowalczyk on backing vocals, and Sean Hurley (John Mayer, Pitbull) on bass. Hurley previously contributed on ¬øWhat. Joe Viglione noted the influence of Al Green and Elvis Costello on Something Simple and wrote that the song \\"Deity Freak\\" \\"is as infectious as it gets.\\" He wrote that Something Simple \\"demands a number of spins before it reveals itself and some of the mystery still remains, which is the kind of intangible quality usually indicating that something special is going on.\\"Joe Viglione, review Allmusic =2010s= After taking a few years off from music to concentrate on his television and screenwriting projects, Davis went back into the studio with a new band to record Music For Mortals. The album features a collection of songs written over the course of the last year of his father's life, and explores themes found in several \\"books of the dead.\\" Once again it was produced and engineered by Alex Gibson (David Lee Roth, Sting, Ben Folds), and features musicians Blair Sinta (Alanis Morissette, Annie Lennox) on drums, Joel Shearer (Christina Aguilera, Dido) on guitar, Justin Meldal-Johnsen (Tori Amos, Beck) on bass, and Nathan Jenkins (Beyonc√©, Slim Thug) on various instruments, electronic programming, additional production & engineering. The first single from the album is called \\"Beautiful Place\\". Television career In 2006 Davis created a 12-episode web series for the website Integral Naked called The Stuart Davis Show. It features Stuart and two \\"clones\\" that represent competing and divergent voices of his personality. The show deals with subjects such as open marriage, Death Day, The Secret, and the tragedy at Virginia Tech. After completing a year of The Stuart Davis Show, Davis began developing a new venture called Sex, God, Rock 'n Roll. While his first series was a loosely designed and spiritually influenced topical sitcom, the new show followed a more conventionally formatted late-night talk show with an opening monologue, news segment, and interview, with occasional pre-recorded parody commercials. It was picked up by Mark Cuban's network HDNet for the 2009 television season and ran for 6 episodes. The televised version omitted the interview segments, but these were included as extras on the season's home video release. For season 2, Davis redesigned the show into five segments including the Sexy Word (with Mariann Gavelo [Casa de mi Padre]), news (with co-host Kandyse McClure of Battlestar Galactica), musical studio performance, Rocktails (McClure), and closing monologue. One of the high points of season 2 was a sit-down interview with Kermit The Frog. Among other topics the two discussed Kermit's new movie (The Muppets), sex life, and spiritual practice. Season 2 ran for 6 episodes in the winter of 2012 on HDNet. Other artistic pursuits =Constructed language= Davis is the developer of a constructed language called Is. Among its unique characteristics are that words are \\"conjugated in altitudes,\\" or levels of consciousness. =Calligraphy= Davis paints calligraphy, often using the medium to explore his fascination with crows. One of the most common styles he employs is to paint the crows using tiny strokes composed of his constructed language Is. Because of the microstroke method, these paintings can take a long time to complete. He also typically burns the edges so that they have an uneven and charred perimeter. =Books and screenplays= Davis also has written several screenplays, one of them with Steven Brill, and published an audiobook called Love Has No Opposite, which he describes, in the introduction, as a tome that \\"some might consider a Blog-ography...a biography minus sequence, thematic continuity, and facts.\\" A book with a title similar to his television program, Sex, God, Rock 'n Roll: Sacred Comedy for Profane Sensibilities, remains unpublished but is the source of many of the spoken word segments read by Davis at shows in 2012. A foreword to the book is contributed by philosopher Ken Wilber. Personal life Davis has long been an advocate of the probability of extraterrestrial life, in part fostered by his friendship with the late John E. Mack, and his fascination with the subject has manifested in the songs \\"Universe Communion\\", \\"Shades of Grey\\" and \\"They‚Äôre Already Here\\". He discussed his esoteric viewpoints as a guest on the late-night radio show Coast to Coast AM in 2012. He has served as a charter member of Ken Wilber's spiritual think-tank Integral Institute (II), and was a contributor to II's multimedia sister site Integral Naked.

A man participating in limbo in London. Limbo is a popular dance contest, based on traditions that originated on the island of Trinidad. The aim is to pass forwards under a low bar without falling or dislodging the bar. The dance originated as an event that took place at wakes in Trinidad. It was popularized in the 1950s by dance pioneer Julia Edwards (known as the First Lady of Limbo) and her company which appeared in several films, in particular Fire Down Below (1957), and toured widely in the Caribbean, Europe, North America, South America, Asia, and Africa in the 1960s and later. Rules A horizontal bar, known as the limbo bar, is supported by two vertical bars. All contestants must attempt to go under the bar with their backs facing toward the floor. When passing under the bar, players must bend backwards. No part of their body is allowed to touch the bar, and no part other than their feet may touch the ground. They must not turn their head or neck to the side. Whoever knocks the bar off or falls is eliminated. After everyone has passed under the bar in this manner, the bar is lowered slightly and the contest continues. The contest ends when only one person can pass under the bar. History The word 'limbo' dates back to the 1950s. It is conjectured that limbo is a West Indian English derivative of 'limber'. Merriam‚ÄìWebster lists the etymology as \\"English of Trinidad & Barbados; akin to Jamaican English limba to bend, from English limber\\". This dance is also used as a funeral dance and may be related to the African legba or legua dance.Limbo Dance.

Cambridge, MA: South End Press, 2007. The limbo dates back to the mid to late 1800s in Trinidad. It achieved mainstream popularity during the 1950s. An alternative explanation of the name is suggested; that the version of the limbo performed in nineteenth century Trinidad was meant to symbolize slaves entering the galleys of a slave ship, or a spirit crossing over into the afterworld, or \\"limbo\\", but no literary reference is known to substantiate this postulated linkage. Dr Alan Rice elaborates on the supposed link the dance has with the slave trade: \\"Africans were forced to dance on deck for exercise. Many took advantage of this to bond and communicate with their shipmates by dancing steps remembered from their past in Africa. This was to continue in the Americas in dances, religious ceremonies and other musical forms that used cultural traditions from Africa. One such dance was the limbo in the Caribbean. The limbo spoke directly of the limited space in the slaving ships and the African ability to escape it.\\" Popularization Limbo dancer attempting lowered pole. Limbo played as a children's game in a Virginia school. Traditionally, the limbo dance began at the lowest possible bar height and the bar was gradually raised, signifying an emergence from death into life. In its adaptation to the world of entertainment, troupes began reversing the traditional order. According to a 1956 newspaper report, the dance was revived in 1944 by Edric Connor. It became a popular entertainment in Trinidad and was adopted as a physical fitness exercise by American troops. Hal Boyle, \\"Limbo Dance Is Way To Reduce\\", Oil City Derrick Newspaper Archives, June 30, 1956, p.6 In the 1950s, choreographer and dancer Julia Edwards added a number of features that are now considered standard, such as human 'bars' formed by the limbs of other dancers and the use of fire in the performance of limbo. \\"Julia Edwards\\", Aspiring Minds Trinidad and Tobago. Retrieved 20 May 2019 A film, Julia and Joyce, by Trinidadian-American Sonja Dumas, was released in 2010. It traces the evolution of limbo dancing and the contribution of Edwards to its popularity. \\"Trinidad and Tobago Facts\\", Trinidad and Tobago Embassy, United States. Retrieved 20 May 2019 Limbo dancers generally move and respond to a number of specific Afro-Caribbean drum patterns. As Limbo gained popularity as a tourist activity and a form of entertainment, pop music began using Caribbean rhythms to respond to the emerging craze in the United States. One example is the song \\"Limbo Rock\\" (recorded by Chubby Checker), which became a number 2 charted hit on the Billboard Top 100, from which emerged the popular quote/chant that is associated with limbo which Checker also helped to popularize: \\"How low can you go?\\" Limbo was brought into the mainstream by Trinidadian Calypsonian Brigo (Samuel Abrahams) with his popular Soca song \\"Limbo Break\\". Limbo is considered the unofficial national dance of Trinidad and Tobago, which refers to itself as the land of limbo, steelpan (steel drums), and calypso. After a preparatory dance, the dancer prepares and approaches the bar, lowering and leaning back their body while balancing on feet akimbo with knees extended backwards. The dancer is declared \\"out\\" and loses the contest if any part of the body touches the stick or pole that they are passing beneath, or if the hands touch the floor. When several dancers compete, they go under the stick in single-file; the stick is gradually lowered until only one dancer, who has not touched either the pole or the floor, remains. As Limbo spread out of Trinidad and Tobago to the wider world and the big screen, limbo became a major part of the tourism package in several other Caribbean islands, such as Barbados and Jamaica. In Jamaica, the trendy limbo music of the 1950s was often based on a clave rhythm. It is also widely heard in Jamaican mento recorded in the 1950s, in songs such as \\"Limbo\\" by Lord Tickler and Calypsonians, or \\"Limbo\\" by Denzil Laing & the Wrigglers, as well as many other songs not directly related to the limbo dance itself. Limbo's continued significance in Trinidadian and Tobagonian culture ia clearly demonstrated in festivals and social events across the two islands, including performances by popular dance troupes at the Prime Minister's Best Village Competition, and during the Carnival season in Trinidad and Tobago. When performing for tourists, professional limbo dancers often invite spectators to participate after their own presentation of the dance. The massive popularity of limbo has emerged directly from this audience participation. In recent years, limbo dancing has been conducted as a social \\"icebreaker\\" game for tourists at Caribbean and other tropical resorts. The winning dancer often receives a prize. World record The world record for lowest limbo dance is held by Dennis Walston, who successfully attempted a bar in March 1991. The world record for lowest female limbo dance is held by Shemika Charles, a 26-year-old woman from Trinidad who lives in Buffalo, NY. On 16 September 2010, she successfully danced under a bar above the ground. Shemika Charles-Campbell also holds her third world record for the Farthest Distance Limbo Under 12 inches. The record setting limbo was completed under vehicles and measured a distance of 12.67ft (3.8 meters). The record was attained on 9 October 2020 in her home country Trinidad and Tobago.

It describes a practical joke allegedly perpetrated in 1824, by a retired ship carpenter named Lozier. According to the story, in the 1820s a rumor began circulating among city merchants that the weight of the urban district was causing southern Manhattan Island to sink, near the Battery. It was believed that by cutting the island, towing it out, rotating it 180 degrees, and putting it back in place that Manhattan would be stabilized, and that the thin part of the island could be condemned. Surprisingly, the main concern was not the futility of the idea but of Long Island's being in the way. Lozier finally assembled a large workforce and logistical support. At a massive groundbreaking ceremony, Lozier did not show up, but hid in Brooklyn and did not return for months. The story did not appear in any known newspapers (although the press supposedly did not report on such pranks in that era) and no records have been found to confirm the existence of the individuals involved. This has led to speculation that the incident never occurred and the original report of the hoax was itself a hoax, which is the conclusion Joel Rose suggests in his book, New York Sawed in Half: An Urban Historical (2001). The hoax was first documented in Thomas F. De Voe's (1811-1892) volume The Market Book (1862), as conveyed by his uncle who was Lozier's supposed associate, and was told again in Herbert Asbury's work All Around The Town: Murder, Scandal, Riot and Mayhem in Old New York (1934, reissued as a Sequel to Gangs of New York). Another condensed retelling occurs in the 1960s Reader's Digest book, Scoundrels and Scallywags: 51 Stories of the Most Fascinating Characters of Hoax and Fraud (1968).

Korah or K√≥rach (Hebrew: ; Arabic: ), son of Izhar, is an individual who appears in the Book of Numbers of the Hebrew Bible and four different verses in the Quran, known for leading a rebellion against Moses. The name Korah is also used for at least one other individual in the Hebrew Bible: Korah (son of Esau). Pronunciation and etymology His name is pronounced Q√≥ra·∏• in Standard Hebrew, or Q≈çra·∏• in Tiberian Hebrew. Some older English translations, as well as the Douay‚ÄìRheims Bible, spell the name Core, and many Eastern European translations have Korak. The Arabic equivalent of the name is ŸÇÿßÿ±ŸàŸÜ, pronounced QƒÅr≈´n. It comes from a root meaning \\"Baldness; ice; hail; frost\\".  In the Hebrew Bible  =Genealogy= The Punishment of Korah and the Stoning of Moses and Aaron. Fresco by Sandro Botticelli in the Sistine Chapel, 1480‚Äì82. Exodus cites Korah as being the son of Izhar son of Kohath son of Levi. lists his three sons. Korah's brothers through Izhar were Nepheg and Zichri. connects this Korah with Hebron, Uzziel and Amram, who were his father's brothers (Izhar son of Kohath). 1 Chronicles , and , repeat this genealogy; however, this reference could have been inspired by the Exodus genealogies. Hebron is the patriarch from whom the region is named. Numbers traces this lineage back further to Levi, son of the patriarch Israel. According to , his lineage goes: \\"Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi,\\" making him the great-grandson of the patriarch Levi and the first cousin of Moses and Aaron. =Rebellion= indicates that Korah rebelled against Moses along with 249 co-conspirators and were punished for their rebellion when God sent fire from heaven to consume all 250 of them. Korah's Reubenite accomplices Dathan and Abiram were also punished when God caused the ground to split open beneath their feet swallowing them, their families, anyone associated with Korah, and all their possessions. Furthermore, the Israelites who did not like what had happened to Korah, Dathan and Abiram (and their families) objected to Moses, and God then commanded Moses to depart from the multitude. God then smote 14,700 men with plague, as punishment for objecting to Korah's destruction (ff.) \\"Notwithstanding, the children of Korah died not\\" (). In rabbinical literature The rabbis of the Talmudic era explained the name \\"Korah\\" as meaning \\"baldness.\\" It was given to Korah on account of the gap or blank which he made in Israel by his revolt.Sanhedrin 109b Korah is represented as the possessor of extraordinary wealth, he having discovered one of the treasures which Joseph had hidden in Egypt. The keys of Korah's treasuries alone formed a load for 300 mules.Pesachim 119a; Sanhedrin 110a He and Haman were the two richest men in the world, and both died on account of their rapacity, and because their riches were not the gift of Heaven.Numbers Rabbah 22:7; compare Exodus Rabbah 51:1 On the other hand, Korah is represented as a wise man, chief of his family and as one of the Kohathites who carried the Ark of the Covenant on their shoulders.Tanhuma, ed. Buber, ·∏≤ora·∏•, Supplement, 5; Numbers Rabbah 18:2 =Cause of revolt= According to the Rabbis, the main cause of Korah's revolt was the nomination of Elizaphan, son of Uzziel, as prince over the Kohathites,Numbers 3:30 Korah arguing thus: \\"Kohath had four sons.Exodus 6:18 The two sons of Amram, Kohath's eldest son, took for themselves the kingdom and the priesthood. Now, as I am the son of Kohath's second son, I should be made prince over the Kohathites; however Moses gave that office to Elizaphan, the son of Kohath's youngest son\\".Numbers Rabbah 18:1; Tanhuma, ·∏≤ora·∏•, 3 Korah asked Moses the following questions: \\"Does a tallit made entirely of techelet need fringes?\\" To Moses' affirmative answer Korah objected: \\"The blue color of the ·π≠allit does not make it ritually correct, yet according to your statement four blue threads do so\\".Numbers 15:38 \\"Does a house filled with the books of the Law need a mezuzah?\\" Moses replied that it did; whereupon Korah said: \\"The presence of the whole Torah, which contains 175 chapters, does not make a house fit for habitation, yet you say that one chapter of it does so. It is not from God that you have received these commandments; you have invented them yourself.\\" He then assembled 250 men, chiefs of the Sanhedrin, and, having clad them in tallitot of blue wool, but without fringes, prepared for them a banquet. Aaron's sons came for the priestly share, but Korah and his people refused to give the prescribed portions to them, saying that it was not God but Moses who commanded those things. Moses, having been informed of these proceedings, went to the house of Korah to effect a reconciliation, but the latter and his 250 followers rose up against him.Numbers Rabbah 18:2; Tanhuma l.c.; compare Targum Pseudo-Jonathan to Numbers 16:2 Korah consulted also his wife, who encouraged him in the revolt, saying: \\"See what Moses has done. He has proclaimed himself king; he has made his brother high priest, and his brother's sons priests; moreover, he has made you shave all your hairCompare Numbers 8:7 in order to disfigure you.\\" Korah answered: \\"But he has done the same to his own sons.\\" His wife replied: \\"Moses hated you so much that he was ready to do evil to his own children provided the same evil would overtake you\\".Midrash Aggadah to Numbers 16:8; Yalkut Shimoni Numbers 750; compare Numbers Rabbah l.c.; Tanhuma l.c.; Sanhedrin 110a Modern Jewish reform and secular interpretations of the Korah revolt supply new causes for the revolt to reflect new agendas and concerns of the authors. =Korah's parable= Moses and Korah, 1466 manuscript miniature, National Library of Poland. Korah incited all the people against Moses, arguing that it was impossible to endure the laws Moses had instituted. He told them the following parable: \\"A widow, the mother of two young daughters, had a field. When she came to plow it, Moses told her not to plow it with an ox and an ass together;Deuteronomy 22:10 when she came to sow it, Moses told her not to sow it with mingled seeds;Leviticus 19:19 At the time of harvest she had to leave unreaped the parts of the field prescribed by the Law, while from the harvested grain she had to give the priest the share due to him. The woman sold the field and with the proceeds bought two sheep. But the first-born of these she was obliged to give to Aaron the priest; and at the time of shearing he required the first of the fleece also.Deuteronomy 18:4 The widow said: 'I cannot bear this man's demands any longer. It will be better for me to slaughter the sheep and eat them.' But Aaron came for the shoulder, the two cheeks, and the maw.Deuteronomy 18:3 The widow then vehemently cried out: 'If you persist in your demand, I declare them devoted to the Lord.' Aaron replied: 'In that case the whole belongs to me',Numbers 18:14 whereupon he took away the meat, leaving the widow and her two daughters wholly unprovided for\\".Numbers Rabbah 18:2-3; Tanhuma, ·∏≤ora·∏•, 4-6 The question how it was possible for a wise man like Korah to be so imprudent as to rebel is explained by the fact that he was deceived through his own prophetic ability. He had foreseen that the prophet Samuel would be his descendant, and therefore concluded that he himself would escape punishment. But he was mistaken; for, while his sons escaped, he perished.Numbers Rabbah 18:7; Tanhuma, ·∏≤ora·∏•, 12 =Destruction of Korah= At the time of Korah's engulfment, the earth became like a funnel, and everything that belonged to him, even linen that was at the launderer's and needles that had been borrowed by persons living at a distance from Korah, rolled till it fell into the chasm.Yerushalmi Sanhedrin 10 1; Numbers Rabbah l.c. According to the Rabbis, Korah himself underwent the double punishment of being burned and buried alive.Numbers Rabbah l.c. 14; Tanhuma, ·∏≤ora·∏•, 23 He and his followers continued to sink until Hannah prayed for them;Genesis Rabbah 98:3 and through her prayer, the Rabbis declare, Korah will ascend to paradise.Avot of Rabbi Natan 36; Numbers Rabbah 18:11; compare Sanhedrin 109b Rabbah bar bar Hana narrates that while he was traveling in the desert, an Arab showed him the place of Korah's engulfment. There was at the spot a slit in the ground into which he introduced some wool soaked in water. The wool became parched. On placing his ear to the slit, he heard voices cry: \\"Moses and his Torah are true; and we are liars\\".Bava Batra 74a; compare Tanhuma, ed. Buber, ·∏≤ora·∏•, Supplement  Other references  Korah is referenced in the New Testament in : \\"Woe to them! They have taken the way of Cain; they have rushed for profit into Balaam's error; they have been destroyed in Korah's rebellion.\\" (NIV) The rebellion of Korah is also made reference to in chapter 11 of 2 Meqabyan, a book considered canonical in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. Korah is mentioned in the 1768 edition of the New England Primer. Here, as part of an alphabet, we read that \\"Proud Korah's troop was swallowed up\\" which is a paraphrasing of . Korah is also mentioned by Irenaeus of Lyons in his anti- Gnostic work Adversus Haereses (Against Heresies), written in about 180. He criticized the excuse that some evil people in the Bible were credited with obtaining their power from God. Specifically he wrote there are some who: :declare that Cain derived his being from the Power above, and acknowledge that Esau, Korah, the Sodomites, and all such persons, are related to themselves. The Dead Sea Scrolls also provide additional details about Korah, though which Korah is not certain. Quranic reference Korah is also mentioned in the Quran by the name of Qarun (Arabic: ŸÇÿßÿ±ŸàŸÜ QƒÅr≈´n). He is recognized as wealthy, and became very arrogant due to his pride and ignorance.Worldreminder.com He gave the credit of his wealth to his knowledge instead of to Allah (God).Al-Qasas 28:76 The Quran states he was punished due to his extreme arrogance by being swallowed by earth along with all his great material wealth.Al-Qasas 28:78-81 In the Malay and Indonesian language, the term for treasure is \\"Harta Karun\\", meaning Karun's treasure.

The Governor of Virginia during the conflict was John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore‚ÄîLord Dunmore. He asked the Virginia House of Burgesses to declare a state of war with the hostile Indian nations and call out the militia. The conflict resulted from escalating violence between British colonists, who, in accordance with previous treaties, were exploring and moving into land south of the Ohio River (modern West Virginia, Southwestern Pennsylvania and Kentucky), and American Indians, who held treaty rights to hunt there. As a result of successive attacks by Indian hunting and war bands upon the settlers, war was declared \\"to pacify the hostile Indian war bands\\". The war ended soon after Virginia's victory in the Battle of Point Pleasant on October 10, 1774. As a result of this victory, the Indians lost the right to hunt in the area and agreed to recognize the Ohio River as the boundary between Indian lands and the British colonies. Although the Indian national chieftains signed the Treaty of Camp Charlotte, conflict within the Indian nations soon broke out. Some tribesmen felt the treaty sold out their claims and opposed it, and others believed that another war would mean only further losses of territory to the more powerful British colonists. When war broke out between the colonials and the British government in 1776, the war parties of the Indian nations quickly gained power. They mobilized the various Indian nations to attack the colonists during the Revolutionary War.

Although they were the most powerful Indian nation in the Northern Colonies, other tribes also made claims to the area and often hunted the region. Contention over the Ohio Country was one of the causes of the Seven Years' War between France and Britain, which ended with France ceding notional control over the entire area at the Treaty of Paris in 1763. When, in accordance with the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1768), British officials acquired the land south of the Ohio River from the Iroquois, many other Ohio Indians who had hunted in these lands refused to accede to the treaty and prepared to defend their hunting rights.\\"I likewise advised them to withdraw the Senecas of Ohio from thence and settle them nearer their natural friends as at present by their Connections with others they bring disgrace & suspicion on their own confederacy, and this I was the readier induced to do, as Kayashota the chief of those on Ohio, a man of universal influence was present & had privately assured me that it was agreeable to him.\\" Sir William Johnson to the Earl of Dartmouth, (Johnson Hall, Nov. 4, 1772) Johnson, Sir William in: Documents, Relative to the Colonial History of the State of New York (Lon.Docs.: XLIII), vol.

This immediately brought them into direct contact with Native Americans. Of the upper Ohio Valley, especially the Allegheny River, George Washington wrote in his journal for Saturday, Nov. 17, 1770, \\"The Indians who are very dexterous, even their women, in the Management of Canoes, have there Hunting Camps & Cabins all along the River for the convenience of Transporting their Skins by Water to Market.\\" In September 1773, a then obscure hunter named Daniel Boone led a group of about 50 emigrants in the first attempt by British colonists to establish a settlement in Kentucky County, Virginia. On October 9, 1773, Boone's oldest son James, age 16, and a small group of men and boys who were retrieving supplies were attacked by a band of Delawares, Shawnees, and Cherokees. They had decided \\"to send a message of their opposition to settlement‚Ä¶\\"John Mack Faragher, Daniel Boone James Boone and Henry Russell, a teenage son of future Revolutionary War officer William Russell, were captured and tortured to death. The brutality of the killings shocked the settlers along the frontier, and Boone's party abandoned their expedition. By December, the incident had been reported in Baltimore and Philadelphia newspapers. The deaths among Boone's party were among the first events in Lord Dunmore's War. For the next several years, Indian nations opposed to the treaty continued to attack settlers, ritually mutilated and tortured to death the surviving men, and took the women and children into slavery.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 89‚Äì96, quote on 93; Lofaro, American Life, 44‚Äì49. Early the next year, a field surveyor named William Preston sent a letter of report to the head engineer of the frontier fort construction, namely George Washington, which indicates his understanding of circumstances just prior to the outbreak of Dunmore's War: > FINCASTLE May 27. 1774. > DEAR SIR > Agreeable to my Promise I directed Mr. Floyd an Assistant to Survey your > Land on Cole River on his Way to the Ohio, which he did and in a few Days > afterwards sent me the Plot by Mr. Thomas Hog.

Among the settlers was Captain Michael Cresap, the owner of a trading post at Redstone Old Fort (now Brownsville, Pennsylvania) on the Monongahela River. Under authority of the colonial government of Virginia, Cresap had taken control of extensive tracts of land at and below the mouth of Middle Island Creek (now St. Marys, West Virginia.) He went there in the early spring of 1774 with a party of men to settle his holdings. Ebenezer Zane, afterwards a famed \\"Indian fighter\\" and guide, was engaged at the same time and in the same way with a small party of men on lands which he had taken up at or near the mouth of Sandy Creek (now Ravenswood, West Virginia). A third and larger group that included George Rogers Clark, who later became a general during the Revolutionary War, had gathered at the mouth of the Little Kanawha River (now Parkersburg, West Virginia.) They were waiting there for the arrival of other Virginians expected to join them before they moved downriver to settle lands in Kentucky. Clark's group began to hear reports that hostile Indian nationals were robbing and occasionally killing traders, surveyors and others traveling down the Ohio. They concluded that hostile nations of the Shawnee-centered Ohio confederacy were bent on all-out war. The group decided to attack the Ohio Indian village called Horsehead Bottom, near the mouth of the Scioto River (now Portsmouth, Ohio) and on the route to their intended destination in Kentucky. Few in the group had experience in warfare. After some discussion, the group selected Cresap, whom they knew was about fifteen miles (24 km) upriver. They knew he was intending to follow them into Kentucky, and he had combat experience. They sent for Cresap, who quickly came to meet with the group. After some discussion, Cresap dissuaded them from attacking the Shawnee. He thought that while the actions of the Shawnee-Ohio confederates were hostile, he did not believe war was inevitable. He argued further that if the group carried out its plans, he did not doubt their initial success, but war would then surely come. They would be blamed for it. He suggested the group return upstream to Zane's small settlement at \\"Zanesburg\\" (the future Wheeling) for a few weeks to see what would develop. If the situation calmed, they could resume their journey to Kentucky. The group agreed. When they arrived, however, they found the whole area in an uproar. People were panicked by the stories of the survivors of the Indian attacks. They were upset by what they viewed as Indian savagery. Fearing for the lives of women and children, the British colonists from the frontier flocked to the tiny town for protection. Cresap's group was swelled with volunteers spoiling for a fight. Word of the group's arrival and plans had now reached Fort Pitt and Capt. John Connolly, the garrison commander, sent a message asking that the volunteers remain in Zanesburg a few days. He had sent messages to the local tribes to determine their intentions.\\"I hope you will prevail on the Delawares, and the well affected part of the Mingoes, to move off from the Shawanese.\\" Lord Dunmore to Captain John Conolly.

A flurry of correspondence resulted, first, with the group saying they would wait for further word from Connolly. Before their message reached Fort Pitt, Cresap received a second message from Connolly that said the Shawnee-Ohio tribes had signaled they intended war. Cresap called a council on April 26. After he read Connolly's letter aloud, the assembly declared war against the Indians. After spotting some Indian canoes on the river the next day, settlers chased them fifteen miles (24 km) downriver to Pipe Creek. There settlers engaged them in battle, with a few casualties on each side. The following day, Clark's party abandoned the original idea of proceeding to Kentucky. Expecting retaliation, they broke camp and moved with Cresap's men to his headquarters at Redstone Old Fort. =The Yellow Creek Massacre= Immediately after the Pipe Creek attack, settlers killed relatives of the Mingo leader Logan. Up until this point, Logan had expressed peaceful intentions toward the settlers. He and his hunting party were camped on the west bank of the Ohio at Yellow Creek, about 30 miles above Zanesburg (near present day Steubenville, Ohio) and across the river from Baker's Bottom. On April 30 some members of the hunting party (Logan was not among them) crossed the river to the cabin of Joshua Baker, a settler and rum trader. The visiting Mingo included Logan's younger brother, commonly known as John Petty, and two closely related women. The younger woman was pregnant and also had an infant girl with her. The father of both these children was John Gibson, a well-known trader. Once the group was inside Baker's cabin, some 30 frontiersmen, led by Daniel Greathouse, suddenly crowded in and killed all the visitors except the infant. When Logan heard of the massacre, he was led to believe that Cresap, not Greathouse, was the man responsible for attack. However, many people familiar with the incident (including Clark) knew that Greathouse and his men were the ones who had killed the party. Settlers along the frontiers realized that these killings were likely to provoke the remaining Indian nations of the Ohio Country to attack. Settlers remaining on the frontier immediately sought safety, either in blockhouses or by fleeing eastward across the Monongahela River. Many even traveled back across the Allegheny Mountains. Their fear was well founded. Logan and small parties of Shawnee and Mingo soon began striking at frontier settlers in revenge for the murders at Yellow Creek. On 5 May 1774, the Shawnee delivered the following message: > Brothers: [directed at Captain Connolly, Mr. McKee, and Mr. Croghan] We have > received your Speeches by White Eyes, and as to what Mr. Croghan and Mr. > McKee says, we look upon it all to be lies, and perhaps what you say may be > lies also, but as it is the first time you have spoke to us we listen to > you, and expect that what we may hear from you will be more confined to > truth than what we usually hear from the white people.

Dunmore's expedition =Mobilization and movements= Early in May 1774, Dunmore received word that fighting had begun at Yellow Creek and other points on the Ohio. He requested the legislature to authorize general militia forces and fund a volunteer expedition into the Ohio River valley. According to historians Eric Hinderaker and Peter C. Mancall in At the Edge of Empire (2003): > With the new forces, Dunmore advanced toward the Ohio where he split his > force into two groups: one would move down the Ohio from Fort Pitt (now > Pittsburgh, PA), 1,700 men led by him, and another body of 800 troops under > Colonel Andrew Lewis would travel from Camp Union (now Lewisburg, WV) with > the two forces rendezvousing at the mouth of the Great Kanawha River.Lewis's > guide and chief scout was the pioneering hunter and trapper Matthew > Arbuckle, Sr. Under this general plan, Dunmore traveled to Fort Pitt and > duly proceeded with his forces down the Ohio. On September 30, he arrived at > Fort Fincastle (later Fort Henry), recently built at Zanesburg at his > direction. The force under Lewis, now 1,100 strong, proceeded from Camp > Union to the headwaters of the Kanawha. From there, he continued downriver > to the appointed rendezvous, reaching the river's mouth (October 6) where he > established \\"Camp Pleasant\\" (soon to be known as Point Pleasant). Not > finding Dunmore there, he sent messengers up the Ohio to meet him and tell > him of the arrival. On October 9 Dunmore sent a dispatch announcing his > plans to proceed to the Shawnee towns on the Scioto. He ordered Lewis to > cross the Ohio and meet him at the Shawnee towns. =The Battle of Point Pleasant= On October 10, before Lewis began crossing the Ohio, he and his force were surprised by warriors under Chief Cornstalk. The Battle of Point Pleasant raged nearly all day and descended into hand-to- hand combat. Lewis's army suffered about 215 casualties, of whom 75 were killed, including Lewis's brother, and 140 wounded. His forces defeated the Ohio Confederacy warriors, who retreated across the Ohio, having lost about 40 warriors.Roosevelt, Theodore (1889). Chapter XI \\"The Battle of the Great Kanawha\\" Captain George Mathews of the Virginia militia was credited with a flanking maneuver that initiated Cornstalk's retreat.Herndon, G. Melvin (1969). George Mathews, Frontier Patriot. The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 77, No. 3 (Jul., 1969) pp. 311-312 =Treaty of Camp Charlotte= Dunmore and Lewis advanced from their respective points into Ohio to within eight miles (13 km) of the Shawnee towns at Pickaway Plains (present Pickaway County, Ohio) on the Scioto. Here they erected the temporary Camp Charlotte on Scippo Creek and met with Cornstalk to begin peace negotiations. By the terms of the Treaty of Camp Charlotte (19 October 1774), the Shawnee agreed to cease hunting south of the Ohio and to discontinue harassment of travellers on the River.What the exact terms of the treaty were, is not now fully known - no copy of the treaty can be found. Although Chief Logan said he would cease fighting, he would not attend the formal peace talks. It was here that an agent of Chief Logan (possibly Simon Girty) recited a speech by Logan which became one of the most famous speeches in Indian and Ohio history, dubbed, Logan's Lament. After the Mingo refused to accept the terms, Major William Crawford attacked their village of Seekunk (Salt Lick Town, near present Steubenville, Ohio). His force of 240 men destroyed the village.Butterfield (p. 99) and O'Donnell (p. 710) write that Crawford and his men did not participate in the Battle of Point Pleasant, while Miller (p. 311) writes that Crawford led 500 men into the battle. These operations, and the submission of the Shawnee at Camp Charlotte, virtually closed the war. =Fort Gower Resolves= In early November, 1774, the army of Virginians arrived back at the point of land formed by confluence of the Ohio and Hocking Rivers and to the makeshift base camp they had established several weeks earlier named Fort Gower (so named for Earl Gower, a British Lord). There they were informed that the Continental Congress in Philadelphia had enacted a boycott of English goods in response to the Coercive Acts. Recognizing the significance of what was essentially an act of rebellion, the Virginians, in a declaration of the increasing spirit of independence among the colonists, addressing King George and their fellow Virginians, wrote and had published what came to be known as the Fort Gower Resolves. Among the soldiers present were many Virginians that would go on to become famous during the revolution: William Campbell, George Rogers Clark, William Crawford, Simon Kenton, Andrew Lewis, Daniel Morgan, William Russell, Adam Stephen and many others. \\"At a Meeting of the Officers under the Command of his Excellency the Right Honourable the EARL of DUNMORE, convened at Fort Gower*, November 5, 1774, for the Purpose of considering the Grievances of BRITISH AMERICA, an Officer present addressed the Meeting in the following Words: *Situated at the Junction of the Ohio and Hockhocking Rivers, 200 miles below Fort Dunmore. [It is actually about 120 miles below] > GENTLEMEN: Having now concluded the Campaign, by the Assistance of > Providence, with Honour and Advantage to the Colony, and ourselves, it only > remains that we should give our Country the strongest Assurance that we are > ready, at all Times, to the utmost of our Power, to maintain and defend her > just Rights and Privileges. We have lived about three Months in the Woods, > without any intelligence from Boston, or from the Delegates at Philadelphia. > It is possible, from the groundless Reports of designing Men, that our > Countrymen may be jealous of the Use such a Body would make of Arms in their > Hands at this critical Juncture.

But as the Love of Liberty, and Attachment to > the real Interests and just Rights of America outweigh every other > Consideration, we resolve that we will exert every Power within us for the > Defence of American Liberty, and for the Support of her just Rights and > Privileges; not in any precipitate, riotous, or tumultous Manner, but when > regularly called forth by the unanimous Voice of our Countrymen. Resolved, > that we entertain the greatest Respect for his Excellency the Right > Honourable Lord Dunmore, who commanded the Expedition against the Shawanese; > and who, we are confident, underwent the great Fatigue of this singular > Campaign from no other Motive than the true Interest of this Country. Signed > by Order, and in Behalf of the whole corps, , Clerk. The Resolves were published in the Virginia Gazette Dec. 22, 1774. It was the first time colonists had asserted that they were prepared to use force of arms against the Crown to secure their rights - acts which, if executed, would be treason. These resolves were virtually a Declaration of Independence in Ohio by Virginia backwoodsmen six months before the shot in Concord 'heard round the world' and fully a year and a half before the peal of the Liberty Bell announced the freedom of the colonies. Aftermath Dunmore's militia then retreated over the Alleghenies proceeding by Redstone Old Fort and the Great Crossings of the Youghiogheny River to Fort Cumberland, and then to the Virginia capital. The peace did not prevail for long following this treaty, however. On March 24, 1775, a band of Shawnee who apparently did not recognize the Ohio river boundary attacked Daniel Boone in Kentucky along the Wilderness Road. And in May 1776, as the American Revolution got underway, the Shawnee joined renegade Cherokee chief Dragging Canoe in again declaring war on the Virginia colonists. These were the Cherokee‚ÄìAmerican wars of 1776-1794. File:CampCharlotte1.JPGTreaty of Camp Charlotte location spot. File:CampCharlotte2.JPGTreaty of Camp Charlotte location plaque.

A stack buffer overflow occurs when a program writes to a memory address on the program's call stack outside of the intended data structure, which is usually a fixed-length buffer. Stack buffer overflow bugs are caused when a program writes more data to a buffer located on the stack than what is actually allocated for that buffer. This almost always results in corruption of adjacent data on the stack, which could lead to program crashes, incorrect operation, or security issues. Typically, buffer overflow protection modifies the organization of stack-allocated data so it includes a canary value that, when destroyed by a stack buffer overflow, shows that a buffer preceding it in memory has been overflowed. By verifying the canary value, execution of the affected program can be terminated, preventing it from misbehaving or from allowing an attacker to take control over it. Other buffer overflow protection techniques include bounds checking, which checks accesses to each allocated block of memory so they cannot go beyond the actually allocated space, and tagging, which ensures that memory allocated for storing data cannot contain executable code. Overfilling a buffer allocated on the stack is more likely to influence program execution than overfilling a buffer on the heap because the stack contains the return addresses for all active function calls. However, similar implementation-specific protections also exist against heap-based overflows. There are several implementations of buffer overflow protection, including those for the GNU Compiler Collection, LLVM, Microsoft Visual Studio, and other compilers. Overview A stack buffer overflow occurs when a program writes to a memory address on the program's call stack outside of the intended data structure, which is usually a fixed-length buffer. Stack buffer overflow bugs are caused when a program writes more data to a buffer located on the stack than what is actually allocated for that buffer. This almost always results in corruption of adjacent data on the stack, and in cases where the overflow was triggered by mistake, will often cause the program to crash or operate incorrectly. Stack buffer overflow is a type of the more general programming malfunction known as buffer overflow (or buffer overrun). Overfilling a buffer on the stack is more likely to derail program execution than overfilling a buffer on the heap because the stack contains the return addresses for all active function calls. Stack buffer overflow can be caused deliberately as part of an attack known as stack smashing. If the affected program is running with special privileges, or if it accepts data from untrusted network hosts (for example, a public webserver), then the bug is a potential security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject executable code into the running program and take control of the process. This is one of the oldest and more reliable methods for attackers to gain unauthorized access to a computer. Typically, buffer overflow protection modifies the organization of data in the stack frame of a function call to include a \\"canary\\" value that, when destroyed, shows that a buffer preceding it in memory has been overflowed. This provides the benefit of preventing an entire class of attacks. According to some researchers, the performance impact of these techniques is negligible. Stack-smashing protection is unable to protect against certain forms of attack. For example, it cannot protect against buffer overflows in the heap. There is no sane way to alter the layout of data within a structure; structures are expected to be the same between modules, especially with shared libraries. Any data in a structure after a buffer is impossible to protect with canaries; thus, programmers must be very careful about how they organize their variables and use their structures. Canaries Canaries or canary words are known values that are placed between a buffer and control data on the stack to monitor buffer overflows. When the buffer overflows, the first data to be corrupted will usually be the canary, and a failed verification of the canary data will therefore alert of an overflow, which can then be handled, for example, by invalidating the corrupted data. A canary value should not be confused with a sentinel value. The terminology is a reference to the historic practice of using canaries in coal mines, since they would be affected by toxic gases earlier than the miners, thus providing a biological warning system. Canaries are alternately known as cookies, which is meant to evoke the image of a \\"broken cookie\\" when the value is corrupted. There are three types of canaries in use: terminator, random, and random XOR. Current versions of StackGuard support all three, while ProPolice supports terminator and random canaries. =Terminator canaries= Terminator canaries use the observation that most buffer overflow attacks are based on certain string operations which end at string terminators. The reaction to this observation is that the canaries are built of null terminators, CR, LF, and -1. As a result, the attacker must write a null character before writing the return address to avoid altering the canary. This prevents attacks using \`strcpy()\` and other methods that return upon copying a null character, while the undesirable result is that the canary is known. Even with the protection, an attacker could potentially overwrite the canary with its known value and control information with mismatched values, thus passing the canary check code, which is executed soon before the specific processor's return-from-call instruction. =Random canaries= Random canaries are randomly generated, usually from an entropy-gathering daemon, in order to prevent an attacker from knowing their value. Usually, it is not logically possible or plausible to read the canary for exploiting; the canary is a secure value known only by those who need to know it--the buffer overflow protection code in this case. Normally, a random canary is generated at program initialization, and stored in a global variable. This variable is usually padded by unmapped pages, so that attempting to read it using any kinds of tricks that exploit bugs to read off RAM cause a segmentation fault, terminating the program. It may still be possible to read the canary, if the attacker knows where it is, or can get the program to read from the stack. =Random XOR canaries= Random XOR canaries are random canaries that are XOR-scrambled using all or part of the control data. In this way, once the canary or the control data is clobbered, the canary value is wrong. Random XOR canaries have the same vulnerabilities as random canaries, except that the \\"read from stack\\" method of getting the canary is a bit more complicated. The attacker must get the canary, the algorithm, and the control data in order to re-generate the original canary needed to spoof the protection. In addition, random XOR canaries can protect against a certain type of attack involving overflowing a buffer in a structure into a pointer to change the pointer to point at a piece of control data. Because of the XOR encoding, the canary will be wrong if the control data or return value is changed. Because of the pointer, the control data or return value can be changed without overflowing over the canary. Although these canaries protect the control data from being altered by clobbered pointers, they do not protect any other data or the pointers themselves. Function pointers especially are a problem here, as they can be overflowed into and can execute shellcode when called. Bounds checking Bounds checking is a compiler-based technique that adds run-time bounds information for each allocated block of memory, and checks all pointers against those at run-time. For C and C++, bounds checking can be performed at pointer calculation time or at dereference time. Implementations of this approach use either a central repository, which describes each allocated block of memory, or fat pointers, which contain both the pointer and additional data, describing the region that they point to. Tagging Tagging is a compiler-based or hardware-based (requiring a tagged architecture) technique for tagging the type of a piece of data in memory, used mainly for type checking. By marking certain areas of memory as non-executable, it effectively prevents memory allocated to store data from containing executable code. Also, certain areas of memory can be marked as non-allocated, preventing buffer overflows. Historically, tagging has been used for implementing high-level programming languages; with appropriate support from the operating system, tagging can also be used to detect buffer overflows. An example is the NX bit hardware feature, supported by Intel, AMD and ARM processors. Implementations =GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)= Stack-smashing protection was first implemented by StackGuard in 1997, and published at the 1998 USENIX Security Symposium. StackGuard was introduced as a set of patches to the Intel x86 backend of GCC 2.7. StackGuard was maintained for the Immunix Linux distribution from 1998 to 2003, and was extended with implementations for terminator, random and random XOR canaries. StackGuard was suggested for inclusion in GCC 3.x at the GCC 2003 Summit Proceedings, but this was never achieved. From 2001 to 2005, IBM developed GCC patches for stack-smashing protection, known as ProPolice. It improved on the idea of StackGuard by placing buffers after local pointers and function arguments in the stack frame. This helped avoid the corruption of pointers, preventing access to arbitrary memory locations. Red Hat engineers identified problems with ProPolice though, and in 2005 re-implemented stack-smashing protection for inclusion in GCC 4.1. This work introduced the \`-fstack-protector\` flag, which protects only some vulnerable functions, and the \`-fstack-protector-all\` flag, which protects all functions whether they need it or not. In 2012, Google engineers implemented the \`-fstack-protector-strong\` flag to strike a better balance between security and performance. This flag protects more kinds of vulnerable functions than \`-fstack-protector\` does, but not every function, providing better performance than \`-fstack-protector-all\`. It is available in GCC since its version 4.9. All Fedora packages are compiled with \`-fstack- protector\` since Fedora Core 5, and \`-fstack-protector-strong\` since Fedora 20. Most packages in Ubuntu are compiled with \`-fstack-protector\` since 6.10. Every Arch Linux package is compiled with \`-fstack-protector\` since 2011. All Arch Linux packages built since use \`-fstack-protector-strong\`. Stack protection is only used for some packages in Debian, and only for the FreeBSD base system since 8.0. Stack protection is standard in certain operating systems, including OpenBSD, Hardened Gentoo and DragonFly BSD . StackGuard and ProPolice cannot protect against overflows in automatically allocated structures that overflow into function pointers. ProPolice at least will rearrange the allocation order to get such structures allocated before function pointers. A separate mechanism for pointer protection was proposed in PointGuard and is available on Microsoft Windows. =Microsoft Visual Studio= The compiler suite from Microsoft implements buffer overflow protection since version 2003 through the command-line switch, which is enabled by default since version 2005. Using disables the protection. =IBM Compiler= Stack-smashing protection can be turned on by the compiler flag \`-qstackprotect\`. =Clang/LLVM= Clang supports three buffer overflow detectors, namely AddressSanitizer (-fsanitize=address), -fsanitize=bounds, and SafeCode. These systems have different tradeoffs in terms of performance penalty, memory overhead, and classes of detected bugs. Stack protection is standard in certain operating systems, including OpenBSD. =Intel Compiler= Intel's C and C++ compiler supports stack-smashing protection with options similar to those provided by GCC and Microsoft Visual Studio. = Fail-Safe C = Fail-Safe C is an open-source memory-safe ANSI C compiler that performs bounds checking based on fat pointers and object-oriented memory access. =StackGhost (hardware-based)= Invented by Mike Frantzen, StackGhost is a simple tweak to the register window spill/fill routines which makes buffer overflows much more difficult to exploit. It uses a unique hardware feature of the Sun Microsystems SPARC architecture (that being: deferred on-stack in- frame register window spill/fill) to detect modifications of return pointers (a common way for an exploit to hijack execution paths) transparently, automatically protecting all applications without requiring binary or source modifications. The performance impact is negligible, less than one percent. The resulting gdb issues were resolved by Mark Kettenis two years later, allowing enabling of the feature. Following this event, the StackGhost code was integrated (and optimized) into OpenBSD/SPARC. A canary example Normal buffer allocation for x86 architectures and other similar architectures is shown in the buffer overflow entry. Here, we will show the modified process as it pertains to StackGuard. When a function is called, a stack frame is created. A stack frame is built from the end of memory to the beginning; and each stack frame is placed on the top of the stack, closest to the beginning of memory. Thus, running off the end of a piece of data in a stack frame alters data previously entered into the stack frame; and running off the end of a stack frame places data into the previous stack frame. A typical stack frame may look as below, having a return address (RETA) placed first, followed by other control information (CTLI). (CTLI)(RETA) In C, a function may contain many different per-call data structures. Each piece of data created on call is placed in the stack frame in order, and is thus ordered from the end to the beginning of memory. Below is a hypothetical function and its stack frame. int foo() { int a; /* integer */ int *b; /* pointer to integer */ char c[10]; /* character arrays */ char d[3]; b = &a; /* initialize b to point to location of a */ strcpy(c,get_c()); /* get c from somewhere, write it to c */ *b = 5; /* the data at the point in memory b indicates is set to 5 */ strcpy(d,get_d()); return *b; /* read from b and pass it to the caller */ } (d..)(c.........)(b...)(a...)(CTLI)(RETA) In this hypothetical situation, if more than ten bytes are written to the array , or more than 13 to the character array , the excess will overflow into integer pointer , then into integer , then into the control information, and finally the return address. By overwriting , the pointer is made to reference any position in memory, causing a read from an arbitrary address. By overwriting RETA, the function can be made to execute other code (when it attempts to return), either existing functions (ret2libc) or code written into the stack during the overflow. In a nutshell, poor handling of and , such as the unbounded strcpy() calls above, may allow an attacker to control a program by influencing the values assigned to and directly. The goal of buffer overflow protection is to detect this issue in the least intrusive way possible. This is done by removing what can be out of harms way and placing a sort of tripwire, or canary, after the buffer. Buffer overflow protection is implemented as a change to the compiler. As such, it is possible for the protection to alter the structure of the data on the stack frame. This is exactly the case in systems such as ProPolice. The above function's automatic variables are rearranged more safely: arrays and are allocated first in the stack frame, which places integer and integer pointer before them in memory. So the stack frame becomes (b...)(a...)(d..)(c.........)(CTLI)(RETA) As it is impossible to move CTLI or RETA without breaking the produced code, another tactic is employed. An extra piece of information, called a \\"canary\\" (CNRY), is placed after the buffers in the stack frame. When the buffers overflow, the canary value is changed. Thus, to effectively attack the program, an attacker must leave definite indication of his attack. The stack frame is (b...)(a...)(d..)(c.........)(CNRY)(CTLI)(RETA) At the end of every function there is an instruction which continues execution from the memory address indicated by RETA. Before this instruction is executed, a check of CNRY ensures it has not been altered. If the value of CNRY fails the test, program execution is ended immediately. In essence, both deliberate attacks and inadvertent programming bugs result in a program abort. The canary technique adds a few instructions of overhead for every function call with an automatic array, immediately before all dynamic buffer allocation and after dynamic buffer deallocation. The overhead generated in this technique is not significant. It does work, though, unless the canary remains unchanged. If the attacker knows that it's there, and can determine the value of the canary, they may simply copy over it with itself. This is usually difficult to arrange intentionally, and highly improbable in unintentional situations. The position of the canary is implementation specific, but it is always between the buffers and the protected data. Varied positions and lengths have varied benefits.

Lloyd was the first prolific and successful singer-songwriter for music hall in the United Kingdom. He wrote more than 1,000 songs, many of which were performed by himself and others. One of his compositions, Not for Joseph was the first comic song to sell more than 100,000 copies. He established his own theatre company, opened a theatre in London, performed for royalty and toured extensively, touring North America in 1893-94. Early life Born Arthur Rice Lloyd, he was born into a musical family in Edinburgh. His father was Horatio Lloyd, a comic actor based at the Theatre Royal, and his mother, Eliza Horncastle, was a member of the Pyne and Harrison Opera Company. The family lived at 7 Annandale Street, a large Georgian flat at the top of Leith Walk.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1839 From an early age, the young Arthur expressed a desire for a career on the stage, however his father was initially resistant. In 1856 Arthur's father agreed to send his son to the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, where Arthur's uncle, (his father's brother, Fred) was a leading actor. He spent two seasons at the Theatre Royal after which he performed with his father in Scotland. While on a break from the theatre, Arthur tried his hand at the music hall, giving his first appearance at the Minerva Hall in Glasgow. He secured an engagement at Glasgow's Whitebait Music Hall in March 1861 and following a successful season, he headed to London where he gave his debut at the Sun Music Hall in Knightsbridge on 12 October 1862.

In this style, performers relied less on copying burlesque, and instead sought inspiration in their everyday experiences and the colourful characters of daily street life. Audiences loved to join in the chorus and \\"give the bird.\\" Banham, M., The Cambridge Guide to Theatre, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 768 Lloyd achieved great success with his character-songs in the 1870s. He wrote songs for his own performances, as well as for other artists. His repertoire specialised in Cockney songs with many titles devoted to the subject of costermongers. Unlike other music hall composers, his songs were not entirely dependent on the performer's ability to mimic Cockney accents and mannerisms, but rather the lyrics used a \\"quaintness of fancy\\" and humour.

The history of the pipe style is traced to the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century. Some churchwarden pipes can be as long as 16 inches (40 cm). In German the style is referred to as \\"Lesepfeife\\" or \\"reading pipe,\\" presumably because the longer stem allowed an unimpeded view of one's book, and smoke does not form near the reader's eyes, allowing one to look down. Such pipes were very popular as an Oriental influence from the seventeenth century onwards in Europe. They remained most popular in Eastern Europe, as an emblem of the Hussars, cavalry troops with roots in Hungary and Poland, whose employment and influence spread from Russia to France and England during the Napoleonic Wars and brought the pipes with them as part of their characteristic dress. It was even known as the \\"Hussar pipe\\" at the time. Engraved portraits exist of men smoking such an instrument. This long stem pipe type has its origins in the Ottoman Empire, geographically and historically. Churchwarden pipes generally produce a cooler smoke due to the distance smoke must travel from the bowl to the mouthpiece. They have the added benefit of keeping the user's face further away from the heat and smoke produced by combustion in the bowl. They are also more prone to breakage since more pressure is placed on the tenon when the pipe is supported around the mouthpiece. Long ago, churchwarden pipes were made of clay and were common in taverns, and sometimes a set of pipes would have been owned by the establishment and used by different clients like other service items (plates, tankards, etc.). Clay churchwarden pipes were also used during the pioneer era in North America. Many clay pieces of these pipes have been found by archaeologists, giving rise to the myth that the long stems of the clay churchwarden pipes would, for sanitation purposes, be broken off by the next client of the tavern or saloon who wished to smoke. However, there is no evidence to support this claim. In fact, pipes were cleaned by being placed in iron cradles and baked in ovens. Examples of such clay pipes can be seen at the historic Fort Osage museum in Fort Osage, Missouri. Churchwarden pipes were reputedly named after churchwardens, or night watchmen of churches in the time that churches never locked their doors. These \\"churchwardens\\" could not be expected to go all night without a smoke, so they had pipes that were made with exceptionally long stems so the smoke and the pipe wouldn't be in their line of sight as they kept watch. Churchwardens experienced a surge in popularity after the release of Lord of the Rings film trilogy in 2001, since many of the characters smoke churchwardens.

The organisation was made up of all members of the Conservative Party who were 30 years old or younger. Conservative Future was founded in 1998. By 2006, it was the largest political organisation on British campuses and the estimated membership, including members on campuses and through constituency associations may once have totalled 20,000. Conservative Future Scotland was the independent sister organisation of CF in Scotland. Internationally, Conservative Future participated in the centre-right International Young Democrat Union. Within Europe, it was a founder member of the European Young Conservatives. Conservative Future founder and former Leader of the House of Commons, William Hague was announced as the Honorary President at the 2012 Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham. It also sent delegates to the National Conservative Convention, the parliament of the party's voluntary wing (Voluntary Party). 2015 was the last year CF sent delegates to the NCC. History Conservative Future was formed on 7 October 1998 as part of a major series of cross-party reforms introduced by then party leader William Hague. Part of the reforms including the merging of the three movements that specifically handled youth affairs within the party: the Young Conservatives, the Conservative Collegiate Forum, and the National Association of Conservative Graduates. The merger of the organisations into a single body was controversial and opposed by most members and officers of the three organisations at the time. A key change was that whereas members of the party 'opted in' to join the three organisations, under the new unified organisation membership would be automatic for all members under 20. The name 'Conservative Future' stems from the title of the party reforms 'The Fresh Future' and was only intended to be temporary. The first national chairman was the last head of Conservative Graduates, Donal Blaney, followed by Gavin Megaw, who had been the chairman of Conservative Students in its last year of existence. At its launch, the party's national performance and dwindling activist base led to the closure of most former Young Conservative branches and student branches struggled to attract members. As formal membership records were not kept on a national database there have never been any accurate membership figures for the youth organisations before or after the creation of Conservative Future. In 1999 Conservative Future attracted national attention following a re-branding exercise that used the slogan \\"CFUK\\", a twist on the French Connection FCUK brand. The CFUK branding was to be used on promotional material for university branches from late August to mid October 1999 but the threat of court proceedings from French Connection over breach of copyright led to Conservative Future withdrawing the promotion in early October, just before the end of the campaign. In 2002, Conservative Future gained two positions on the national executive committee of the National Union of Students, marking their first return in seven years. This was followed up by a national tour of universities, called 'Politics Unplugged', which involved ten Shadow Cabinet members and was aimed at making politicians more approachable. CF gained further traction in 2003 and 2004, after it was announced that the party announced it would scrap university tuition fees. In 2004 alone, membership rose by 3,000, but stagnated at 15,000 members until the election of David Cameron as party leader. Cameron's election was seen to be emblematic of a change of Conservative Future's image to 'cool', replacing the symbolism of the 'Tory Boy' stereotype of previous years. This occurred most dramatically from 2006 onwards, particularly in northern England. Described by Geordie Greig as 'counter culture', this change is ascribed to 'Saatchi-isation', named for former Party Chairman Maurice Saatchi, and ideological alignment to the so-called 'Notting Hill Set' of the party leadership. Controversy and closure On 19 November 2015, the entire executive of the organisation was suspended, and the youth wing taken under direct control by the Conservative Party. Conservative youth materials for Freshers packs no longer feature Conservative Future branding. This followed months of newspaper speculation and eventually an expos√© on BBC 2 Newsnight, after which the entire Executive of CF was removed, one member of which was an elected councillor in Essex. Allegations of bullying, sexual crime and even blackmail were made, centring on Mark Clarke, a [2015] executive with Unilever plc. Clarke headed both Road Trip 2015 and (2006-2008) Conservative Future. Clarke was expelled from the Conservative Party \\"for life\\" after senior members of the Conservative Party considered an internal report. Allegations against Clarke had included assertions that his behaviour had led to the suicide of a young activist and that Clarke had plotted to blackmail a Cabinet Minister, Robert Halfon MP, over an affair Halfon was conducting with another Road Trip 2015 activist and Conservative Future National Chair, 30-year-old Alexandra Paterson, a public relations employee and Ayn Rand devotee. Sam Armstrong, another prominent Conservative Future member, and associate of Mark Clarke, was later acquitted of rape, and became Communications Director for the Henry Jackson Society. Purpose CF's purpose was to encourage Conservative Party values and assist in local and general elections. Conservative Future is aided in its aims by Members of Parliament (MPs) and Prospective Parliamentary Candidates (PPCs) with visits to branches. They participated in lectures, debates and many more activities. Many members of Conservative Future branches often went on to contest local and national elections, and the organisation as a whole was, by the end of its active life, increasingly turning to the internet to attract new active members. Conservative Future also played an important role in the party's campaigning. Described as the Conservative Party's 'shock troops', CF made a major contribution to the parliamentary by-election victories in Crewe and Nantwich in 2008 and Norwich North in 2009. They were significantly more numerous, visible, and active than Labour's young supporters in the 2008 London mayoral election, in which young voters were one of the key demographics of Boris Johnson's vote. Michael Rock, Chairman of CF from 2008 to 2010, said that one of CF's virtue is being able to take part in stunts and activities that older members can't. A contingent from Conservative Future went to the United States to campaign for John McCain in the 2008 presidential election. Organisation =Branches= Conservative Future branches varied in structure. It had branches at most British universities (many of which disaffiliated with CF and are still active); others are affiliated with city and town associations and aim to attract members from the non-student population. Some branches bring together both types of organisation. Newcastle-under-Lyme and Keele University Conservative Future is an example of a hybrid university and town branch. Some County areas operate, in effect, as one large branch, so that their members have more opportunities to get involved. While some CF branches still actively exist within local Parties, most have fallen into abeyance along with CF nationally. =Regional College= The Regional College included a voting body of Regional Chairmen from across the UK who co-ordinated campaign and membership activity in their regions, and chaired their Regional Executives. It was chaired by the Regional College Chairman, who was elected by fellow Regional Chairmen to one term, and represented the Regional College on the CF National Executive. The position was first established in December 2011, when then Northern Ireland Regional Chairman, Matthew Robinson, was elected as the inaugural Regional College Chairman. The last Regional College Chairman was Chris Rowell. The last elected Regional Chairmen (elected in 2014) were as follows: *North West England - Anthony Harrison *North East England - Isaac Duffy *Yorkshire and the Humber - Chris Rowell *West Midlands - Kurt Ward *East Midlands - Samuel Armstrong *Eastern - Chantelle Whyborn *South West England - Will Elliott *London - Luke Springthorpe *South East England - Theodora Dickinson *Northern Ireland - Ben Manton *Wales - Ryan Hunter Non-voting members of the Regional College also included; the Northern Conservative Future Partnership Chairman and representatives from the Conservative Future Scotland National Executive. =Former National Chairmen= * Donal Blaney (1998‚Äì1999) * Gavin Megaw (1999‚Äì2000) * Tom Bursnall (2000) * Hannah Parker (2001‚Äì2002) * Justin Tomlinson (2002‚Äì2003) * Paul Bristow (2003‚Äì2005) * Nick Vaughan (2005‚Äì2006) * Mark Clarke (2006‚Äì2008) * Michael Rock (2008‚Äì2010) * Ben Howlett (2010‚Äì2013) * Oliver Cooper (2013‚Äì2014) * Alexandra Paterson (2014‚Äì2015)* suspended References External links * Official Conservative Future site * Official Conservative Future Scotland site Organizations established in 1998 Student wings of political parties in the United Kingdom Student wings of conservative parties Youth wings of Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe member parties International Young Democrat Union 1998 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Conservative Future"},{"id":"608644","text":"Meredith College is a women's liberal arts college and coeducational graduate school in Raleigh, North Carolina. Meredith enrolls approximately 1,600 women in its undergraduate programs and 300 men and women in its graduate programs. History Meredith College students and faculty, 1948 Main building in 1930s Chartered by the First Baptist Church the Baptist Female University opened in 1891 in a facility in downtown Raleigh. In 1904, the name was changed to Baptist University for Women. The name \\"Meredith College\\" was chosen in 1909 to honor Thomas Meredith who was the founder of the Baptist newspaper The Biblical Recorder. In 1997, the college moved away from a direct connection with the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina.N.C. committee escrows Meredith College funds Meredith began construction at the current location on Hillsborough Street near North Carolina State University in 1924, and students began attending classes there in 1926. The campus covers and is located in close proximity to both Raleigh-Durham International Airport and Research Triangle Park. In 1980 an angel was chosen as the school sports mascot, but in the summer of 2007 this was changed to the \\"Avenging Angels\\". Academics 37 majors are offered at Meredith, as well as licensure, graduate, and pre- professional programs. According to U.S. News & World Report the most popular majors are Psychology, Biology/Biological Sciences, Business Administration and Management, Interior Design and Social Work. Upon completion of an undergraduate major, students can receive a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Social Work. The John E. Weems Graduate School is coeducational. Undergraduate students who wish to study engineering can participate in a five-year dual-degree program, whereby they can receive degrees from both Meredith and North Carolina State University's College of Engineering. To do this, students must major in either chemistry or mathematics at Meredith. Through this arrangement, students receive a B.A. from Meredith in chemistry or mathematics and a B.S. from NCSU in engineering. The college's Undergraduate Research Program supports student/faculty partnerships for the purposes of academic research and creative activity in all fields. College funds support these projects and underwrite travel costs for students presenting their work at conferences. The college hosts an annual one-day research conference in April to present work of Meredith students. In 2001, Meredith became the first women's college to adopt a campus-wide laptop program through the Meredith Technology Initiative.

In Spring 2013, the laptop program was discontinued, and the wireless network on campus began major upgrades. Student life Main entrance and building Jones Chapel Meredith College is noted for its traditions, which range from the Honor Code at the beginning of each student's time at Meredith to Cornhuskin', a yearly weeklong festival encouraging competition between graduating classes. Each student has the opportunity to enroll in the \\"Big Sis, Little Sis\\" program, which has a junior \\"big sister\\" pair up with one or two \\"little sisters\\" as a mentor and friend. Meredith College also holds events in February of each year to celebrate its Founder's Day and to encourage giving by alumnae, families, friends, and current members of the community. During each college generation, faculty will perform Alice in Wonderland for the students, keeping their involvement in the production a secret up until the students see them on stage. A Meredith woman can be spotted by her class ring, a black onyx with an engraving of the Meredith shield. The current design, the work of Meredith alumna Ann Lovell, has been the same for every Meredith onyx since 1953. Today, this small symbol connects all Meredith women, reminding them of their connection to history and to all other women that wear the Onyx ring. \\"Ring Dinner,\\" when the students first receive their Onyx, is held in the fall of junior year and is one of the most important traditions at Meredith College. Meredith College is also noted for its Honor Code, which each student signs at an Honor Code ceremony at the beginning of her first semester at Meredith. Rankings and classifications Meredith College is ranked #60 in the category of Best Undergraduate Teaching by U.S. News & World Report, is ranked #119 by Forbes among \\"In The South\\", and is categorized by The Princeton Review in the Best Southeastern category. Meredith College was ranked #5 among regional colleges in the South in the 2016 edition of U.S. News & World Report's Best Colleges rankings. Meredith College is not included in this ranking as a southern regional university. Athletics Meredith athletes compete in basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track and field and volleyball. In August 2014 Meredith College announced the addition of track and field and in September 2019 announced the addition of golf as well as field hockey. A member of the USA South Athletic Conference since 2007, Meredith has claimed tournament titles in lacrosse, soccer and tennis, two regular season soccer championships, and three consecutive cross country championships.

His thought both moved beyond and was critical of the modern tradition, whether rationalist or empiricist. His thought may be classified as personalist, as his writings focused primarily on the nature of human beings. He viewed persons in terms of their relationality and agency, rather than the modern tendency to characterize them in terms of individualism and cognition. He made contributions in the fields of political science, religion, education, and philosophy in a long career of writing, teaching, and public speaking. After retirement he became a Quaker. Life Macmurray was born on 16 February 1891 in Maxwelltown in Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland, into a strict Presbyterian family. His father was employed by the Inland Revenue Department as an excise officer. In 1899 the family moved to Aberdeen, where the young Macmurray attended Aberdeen Grammar School (1903 to 1905) and Robert Gordon's College (1905 to 1909). He was educated at the University of Glasgow, earning First-class honours in Classics and was awarded a Snell Exhibition to attend Balliol College, Oxford in 1913. His tutor at Balliol was A. D. Lindsay. When war with Germany was declared in 1914, Macmurray enlisted in the Royal Army Medical Corps. In August 1915 he was sent to France with the 58th Field Ambulance as part of the 19th (Western) Division of the British Expeditionary Force. In June 1916 he was awarded a commission as Second Lieutenant in the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders and was sent to the Battle of the Somme. Macmurray married Elizabeth Hyde Campbell in London during a three-day leave in October 1916. He was seriously wounded in battle near Arras on 28 March 1918 and was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry. While on leave recovering from a broken ankle in 1917, Macmurray was invited to give a sermon in an unidentified North London church. He preached on the importance of preparing for post-war reconciliation with the enemy rather than exacting vengeance. The sermon was coldly received by the congregation and Macmurray saw their reaction as indicating a lack of true Christianity in the institutional churches. Because of this experience, Macmurray determined not to be a member of any church, while continuing to maintain his strong Christian convictions. After the war, Macmurray completed his studies at Balliol, obtaining a distinction in the Shortened Honours Course of Literae Humaniores in 1919, as well as winning in the John Locke Scholarship in Mental Philosophy in the same year.Oxford University Calendar, 1925, p.211Who Was Who, 1971-80, London : A. & C. Black,1981, p.506 He worked as a Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Manchester from 1919 to 1920, followed by two years as Chair of Philosophy at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. In 1922 he returned to Balliol as a Fellow and Tutor, succeeding his former tutor A.D. Lindsay as Jowett Lecturer in Philosophy. He left Oxford to become Grote Professor of Mind and Logic at University College London, the position he held from 1928 to 1944. He then moved to the University of Edinburgh, where he held the Chair of Moral Philosophy until his retirement in 1958. Macmurray and his wife had no children. After his retirement, they moved to the village of Jordans, Buckinghamshire, where they both joined the Society of Friends. In 1970 they returned to Edinburgh, where Macmurray died on 21 June 1976. Philosophy The main themes in Macmurray's philosophy are the primacy in human life of action over theory, and the essentially relational nature of human beings. These themes are the basis for his Gifford Lectures delivered in 1953 and 1954 at the University of Glasgow, and entitled The Self as Agent and Persons in Relation respectively. The overall title given to the two lecture series was The Form of the Personal. Macmurray summed up his philosophy in the introduction to The Self as Agent: \\"The simplest expression that I can find for the thesis I have tried to maintain is this: All meaningful knowledge is for the sake of action, and all meaningful action for the sake of friendship\\". Macmurray rejected mind-body dualism and argued that the nature of human beings is personal, rather than mechanical or organic. He argued for the importance of emotion as motivating action, and looked to infancy and early childhood for evidence of the universal desire for relationship. He distinguished between society and community, with society being for organizations to achieve particular purposes, while community is an end in itself. In dismissing the Cogito and its legacy of the primacy of thought over action, Macmurray saw himself as breaking with the western philosophical tradition. However, he acknowledged the influence of Kant and Marx on his thinking, along with Christianity. On the other hand, he had no sympathy for, and did not engage with, the type of academic philosophy that was dominant during the latter part of his career. Broadcasting and other work His friendship with the educator Kenneth C. Barnes resulted in his becoming a governor of Wennington School. He was well known in Britain before World War II for his BBC radio broadcasts on philosophy, some of which were published in his first book, Freedom in the Modern World (1932). Influence Macmurray' s work has been largely neglected in academic philosophy. However, he has been influential in other fields, including theology and psychology. Recent years have seen the publication of the first full-length biography and a book-length critical study of his religious philosophy, as well as volumes of selections from his works and books and articles about his work. Tony Blair contributed the foreword to one of the anthologies, in which he described Macmurray's philosophy as \\"immensely modern... in the sense that he confronted what will be the critical political question of the twenty-first century: the relationship between individual and society\\".

A proof of concept is usually small and may or may not be complete. Usage history The term has been in use since 1967.\\"proof, n.\\" OED Online. Oxford University Press, March 2020. Web. 15 April 2020. In a 1969 hearing of the Committee on Science and Astronautics, Subcommittee on Advanced Research and Technology, proof of concept was defined as following: One definition of the term \\"proof of concept\\" was by Bruce Carsten in the context of a \\"proof-of-concept prototype\\" in his magazine column \\"Carsten's Corner\\" (1989): The column also provided definitions for the related but distinct terms 'breadboard' (a term used since 1940\\"bread, n.\\" OED Online. Oxford University Press, March 2020. Web. 15 April 2020.), 'prototype', 'engineering prototype', and 'brassboard'. Examples = Filmmaking= Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, 300, and Sin City were all shot in front of a greenscreen with almost all backgrounds and props computer-generated. All three used proof-of-concept short films. In the case of Sin City, the short film became the prologue of the final film. Pixar sometimes creates short animated films that use a difficult or untested technique. Their short film Geri's Game used techniques for animation of cloth and of human facial expressions later used in Toy Story 2. Similarly, Pixar created several short films as proofs of concept for new techniques for water motion, sea anemone tentacles, and a slowly appearing whale in preparation for the production of Finding Nemo. = Engineering= In engineering and technology, a rough prototype of a new idea is often constructed as a \\"proof of concept\\". For example, a working concept of an electrical device may be constructed using a breadboard. A patent application often requires a demonstration of functionality prior to being filed. Some universities have proof of concept centers to \\"fill the 'funding gap'\\" for \\"seed-stage investing\\" and \\"accelerate the commercialization of university innovations\\". Proof of concept centers provide \\"seed funding to novel, early stage research that most often would not be funded by any other conventional source\\". = Business development= In the field of business development and sales, a vendor may allow a prospect customer to try a product. This use of proof-of- concept helps to establish viability, to isolate technical issues, and to suggest overall direction, as well as providing feedback for budgeting and other forms of internal decision-making processes. In these cases, the proof of concept may mean the use of specialized sales engineers to ensure that the vendor makes a best-possible effort. = Security= In both computer security and encryption, proof of concept refers to a demonstration that in principle shows how a system may be protected or compromised, without the necessity of building a complete working vehicle for that purpose. Winzapper was a proof of concept which possessed the bare minimum of capabilities needed to selectively remove an item from the Windows Security Log, but it was not optimized in any way. = Software development= In software development, the term proof of concept often characterises several distinct processes with different objectives and participant roles: vendor business roles may utilise a proof of concept to establish whether a system satisfies some aspect of the purpose it was designed for. Once a vendor is satisfied, a prototype is developed which is then used to seek funding or to demonstrate to prospective customers. The key benefits of the proof of concept in software development are: *possibility to choose the best technology stack for your software( application or webplatform ) *getting a higher probability of investors' interest in the future software product *simplifying and making it easier testing and validating ideas for the software's functionality *receiving valuable feedback of a target audience(users) even before building a full-scope system *onboarding first clients before an official software release A steel thread is technical proof of concept that touches all of the technologies in a solution. By contrast, a proof of technology aims to determine the solution to some technical problem (such as how two systems might integrate) or to demonstrate that a given configuration can achieve a certain throughput. No business users need be involved in a proof of technology. A pilot project refers to an initial roll-out of a system into production, targeting a limited scope of the intended final solution. The scope may be limited by the number of users who can access the system, the business processes affected, the business partners involved, or other restrictions as appropriate to the domain. The purpose of a pilot project is to test, often in a production environment. = Drug development= Although not suggested by natural language, and in contrast to usage in other areas, proof of principle and proof of concept are not synonymous in drug development. A third term, proof of mechanism, is closely related and is also described here. All of these terms lack rigorous definitions and exact usage varies between authors, between institutions and over time. The descriptions given below are intended to be informative and practically useful. The underlying principle is related to the use of biomarkers as surrogate endpoints in early clinical trials.See for example the introductory discussion on pages 3 to 9 of: In early development it is not practical to directly measure that a drug is effective in treating the desired disease, and a surrogate endpoint is used to guide whether or not it is appropriate to proceed with further testing. For example, although it cannot be determined early that a new antibiotic cures patients with pneumonia, early indicators would include that the drug is effective in killing bacteria in laboratory tests, or that it reduces temperature in infected patients‚Äîsuch a drug would merit further testing to determine the appropriate dose and duration of treatment. A new anti-hypertension drug could be shown to reduce blood pressure, indicating that it would be useful to conduct more extensive testing of long-term treatment in the expectation of showing reductions in stroke (cerebrovascular accident) or heart attack (myocardial infarction). Surrogate endpoints are often based on laboratory blood tests or imaging investigations like X-ray or CT scan. * Proof of mechanism or PoM relates to the earliest stages of drug development, often pre-clinical (i.e., before trialling the drug on humans, or before trialling with research animals). It could be based on showing that the drug interacts with the intended molecular receptor or enzyme, and/or affects cell biochemistry in the desired manner and direction. * Proof of principle or PoP relates to early clinical development and typically refers to an evaluation of the effect of a new treatment on disease biomarkers, but not the clinical endpoints of the condition. Early stage clinical trials may aim to demonstrate Proof of Mechanism, or Proof of Principle, or both. A decision is made at this point as to whether to progress the drug into later development, or if it should be dropped. * Proof of concept or PoC refers to early clinical drug development, conventionally divided into the phases of clinical research Phase I (\\"first-in-humans\\") and Phase IIA. Phase I is typically conducted with a small number of healthy volunteers who are given single doses or short courses of treatment (e.g., up to 2 weeks). Studies in this phase aim to show that the new drug has some of the desired clinical activity (e.g., that an experimental anti-hypertensive drug actually has some effect on reducing blood pressure), that it can be tolerated when given to humans, and to give guidance as to dose levels that are worthy of further study. Other Phase I studies aim to investigate how the new drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolised and excreted (ADME studies). Phase IIA is typically conducted in up to 100 patients with the disease of interest. Studies in this Phase aim to show that the new drug has a useful amount of the desired clinical activity (e.g., that an experimental anti-hypertensive drug reduces blood pressure by a useful amount), that it can be tolerated when given to humans in the longer term, and to investigate which dose levels might be most suitable for eventual marketing. A decision is made at this point as to whether to progress the drug into later development, or if it should be dropped. If the drug continues, it will progress into later stage clinical studies, termed Phase IIB and Phase III. Phase III studies involve larger numbers of patients‚Äîcommonly multicenter trials‚Äîtreated at doses and durations representative of marketed use, and in randomised comparison to placebo and/or existing active drugs. They aim to show convincing, statistically significant evidence of efficacy and to give a better assessment of safety than is possible in smaller, short term studies. A decision is made at this point as to whether the drug is effective and safe, and if so an application is made to regulatory authorities (such as the US Food and Drug Administration FDA and the European Medicines Agency) for the drug to receive permission to be marketed for use outside of clinical trials. Clinical trials can continue after marketing authorization has been received, for example, to better delineate safety, to determine appropriate use alongside other drugs or to investigate additional uses.

It is the second tallest building in New Jersey. Completed in 2004, the tower was designed by C√©sar Pelli. It houses offices, a cafeteria, a health unit, and a full-service fitness facility including a physical therapy clinic. The building is in the Exchange Place area close to a PATH station and is accessible by the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail at the Essex Street and Exchange Place stops. The tower sits on the waterfront overlooking the Hudson River and Lower Manhattan and is visible from all five of the New York City boroughs. On a clear day, the building may be visible from as far away as Highlands, New Jersey south and Bear Mountain, New York north. Originally intended to be a dedicated use building for Goldman Sachs' middle and back office units, lower than projected staffing levels at the bank following the global financial crisis forced Goldman to seek occupancy from other tenants to avoid forgone rental income. Royal Bank of Canada currently shares the space, with plans for other professional service firms to take occupancy as well in the near future. History Originally the tower was meant to be the centerpiece of an entire Goldman Sachs campus at Exchange Place, which was to include a training center, a university, and a large hotel complex. Many of the company's Manhattan-based equity traders refused to move away from Wall Street, delaying the occupation of the building's top 13 floors, which remained vacant until early 2008. Once a derelict and mostly industrial part of Jersey City, the Exchange Place area forms part of New Jersey's Gold Coast, a revitalized strip of land along the formerly industrial west bank of the Hudson. Economic development in the 2000s spurred large-scale residential, commercial, and office development along the waterfront. Although the location was largely rejected by the company's financial executives, 4,000 Goldman Sachs employees made the move to the building, including much of the company's real estate, technology, operations, and administrative departments. The building is certified under LEED-NC Version 2.0 of the U.S. Green Building Council. The building has been surrounded by pedestrian protective scaffolding since 2010. The company completed construction of another tower in 2010 to house the bulk of their sales and trading departments. It is located at 200 West Street in Lower Manhattan just north of Brookfield Place (formerly the World Financial Center), almost directly across the water from 30 Hudson. Under their \\"Venice strategy\\", Goldman Sachs works in conjunction with NY Waterway to shuttle workers between the two buildings on private ferries. The building was used in 2016 by the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign to symbolize Goldman Sachs and Hillary Clinton's ties to the company.Staff (January 29, 2016) \\"Bernie Sanders Ad Attacks Goldman Sachs, Wall Street Contributions\\" RealClearPolitics Gallery See also * List of tallest buildings by U.S. state * List of tallest buildings in Jersey City * List of tallest buildings in New Jersey * List of tallest buildings in New York City * List of tallest buildings in the United States * International Finance Centre Tower 1 in Hong Kong, designed similar to the Goldman Sachs Tower * 200 West Street in Lower Manhattan, Goldman Sachs global headquarters References Notes External links * C√©sar Pelli buildings Goldman Sachs Skyscraper office buildings in Jersey City, New Jersey Office buildings completed in 2004 Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certified buildings 2004 establishments in New Jersey ","title":"30 Hudson Street"},{"id":"608682","text":"Owens Park is a large hall of residence located in the Fallowfield district of the city of Manchester, England. The hall is owned by the University of Manchester and houses 1,056 students. Owens Park is a significant part of the Fallowfield Campus of the University of Manchester. The terms 'Owens Park' and 'Fallowfield Campus' are sometimes used interchangeably.  History  The hall, designed by Building Design Partnership, and built in 1964‚Äì66, is most notable for its tower,Owens Park Tower - SkyscraperPage.com which is a local landmark. It has a fibreglass relief, Cosmos I, by Mitzi Cunliffe, at the base. A 2001 plan by the University of Manchester to demolish the tower in 2004 was subsequently abandoned as a result of protests by current and past residents. In 2005 a refurbishment programme was planned; no action has yet been taken.. It was announced in 2014 that Owens Park is due to be demolished as part of the plans to redevelop the Fallowfield Campus with brand new student accommodation. Organisation Owens Park in 1975 Owens Park comprises five main residential blocks (Tower, Tree Court, Green Court, Little Court, and the Mall), an entertainment block (referred to as \\"The OP\\"), where the weekly Owens Park BOP ('Big Old Party') used to take place, and an administration/library block. It also contains a computer cluster available to all students of the University. The residential blocks are internally sub- divided into 'houses', each now housing approximately 30-40 students. In the past, Tree Court was exclusively female, whilst the other blocks housed only male students. Now all block are of mixed sex, though any given floor in a house is single sex with exception to the tower. Each house has a supervising tutor and a common room. Each floor in a house has its own bathroom and kitchen (though the kitchen closest to a common room is often used by the whole house rather than its intended floor). The halls are catered during the week. There are generally rivalries between adjacent houses and other halls of residence, these can be contested in sporting events such as football as each halls of residence generally have a team. Football matches are held each Wednesday and the occasional Saturday (for cup matches). Owens Park Students' Association (OPSA) organises leisure and sporting activities, and is run by a committee formed of current students living in the hall. Notable residents Radiohead guitarist Ed O'Brien was a resident during his time at university in Manchester, as was Rik Mayall.https://theconversation.com/young-gifted-and- punk-my-mad-days-with-rik-mayall-28026 The Chemical Brothers played their first gig at the Owens Park BOP. The comedian Jack Whitehall also lived in the Tower. Other residents included Peter Hammill and Chris Judge Smith who formed Van der Graaf Generator in 1967 while living there.Christopulos, J., & Smart, P. (2005). Van der Graaf Generator, The Book: A History of the Band Van der Graaf Generator 1967 to 1978, page 1. Phil and Jim Publishers. The BOP Prior to September 2009 Owens Park BOP (Big Old Party) was a night held in Owens Park every Friday in the Owens Park tower's ballroom for students of the University of Manchester. The BOP generally had a theme and from September 2008 charged ¬£1 entry to residents, which had caused some outrage amongst residents as previously it had been free. It had a charge of ¬£3.50 for all other entrants. Only students were allowed to enter the BOP and a student card must have been presented upon entry. The BOP was a popular student night out due to its low cost of drinks and transport as most of the BOP's customers were residents of local student halls of residence. However, Owens Park residents had been known to have become disgruntled both at the terrible music often played by the DJs and the students from other halls of residence coming to the event with the large queues this created to gain access. The BOP usually had a theme each week such as a western theme or a dead celebrity theme causing large numbers of students to dress up for the occasion. The BOP was set out very much like a classic school disco except with the inclusion of the sale of alcohol. As a customer entered they were greeted with the main tower bar with its own DJ and a vast amount of seating; however, the main draw of the BOP lay in the large hall upstairs. Upstairs there was a second bar and a foyer-like drinking area, and next door there was a large conference hall. The large hall had a disco-like atmosphere and professional DJ on the stage, with small amounts of seating at the sides. The BOP was generally open from 8 pm till around 2 am; however, times had been known to vary. The BOP was run by the Owens Park Student's Association Executive Committee (OPSA). The Committee is also in charge of running all other hall activities such as the pub quiz, karaoke, sports, and hall pub and club outings. The BOP is known on a larger scale for being the venue of the Chemical Brothers' first gig. After its 2009 move to a pub outside Fallowfield, the Jabez Clegg, attendances steadily declined. Following many rumours the last ever BOP took place on 25 January 2013, bringing an end to its 25-year run.

Michael Straczynski. He has also worked with author Peter David on The Incredible Hulk and Supergirl. He had a creator-owned series, Kin, which he wrote himself, published by Top Cow Productions in 2000. Writer Geoff Johns, who has collaborated with Frank, has opined that Frank's rendition of Superman is the best of his generation and that the only other artist in the same league with Frank in this regard is Curt Swan. Comics career =1990= Gary Frank began his professional career in 1991, illustrating covers and interior short stories for publications such as Doctor Who Magazine and Toxic!. This led to a stint at Marvel UK in 1992 as regular series' artist on Motormouth & Killpower. It was on that series that he began a long-running collaboration with inker Cam Smith, who would continue to ink Frank's work for many years. In 1992, Frank was recruited by Marvel Comics to illustrate covers for The Incredible Hulk, beginning with issue No. 400. Shortly thereafter, he was hired as the series' ongoing artist beginning with issue No. 403 (March 1993) and ending with No. 425 (Jan. 1995). During his initial time at Marvel, Frank contributed covers, interiors and pin-up illustrations for various series, such as X-Men Unlimited, the Sabretooth Special, X-Men Classic, X-Men Prime, and Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme, among others. He drew covers for Acclaim Comics' Ninjak and Harris Comics' Vampirella. In 1996, Frank and Smith were hired as the art team on DC Comics' new Supergirl ongoing series, which re-teamed Frank with writer Peter David. Frank's run as penciller ended with issue No. 9 (May 1997), although he continued to provide covers for the series until issue No. 21. Other assignments for DC included a Birds of Prey one-shotManning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 275: \\"Writer Chuck Dixon and artist Gary Frank paired two birds of a feather in December [1996]'s special Black Canary/Oracle: Birds of Prey No. 1.\\" and the DC/Marvel Amalgam Comics one-shot, Bullets and Bracelets. In 1997, Frank and Smith moved to Image Comics, where they, along with writer John Arcudi, were hired as the new creative team on the Wildstorm title Gen¬π¬≥, beginning with the epilogue story in issue No. 25. Their run on the series was praised for its dark, realistic style in both writing and art; however, the drastic change in tone and style alienated many longtime fans who had grown accustomed to the more fantastical and cartoonish approach of the Brandon Choi/J. Scott Campbell run. The Arcudi/Frank/Smith tenure on the series lasted two years, until issue No. 41 (July 1999). It was during this run, in 1998, that Wildstorm head Jim Lee moved his studio and all its properties to DC Comics. Therefore, issues No. 25‚Äì36 were published by Image and issues No. 37‚Äì41 were published by DC/Wildstorm. =2000s= In 2000, Frank worked on various assignments for both DC and Marvel, including issue No. 7 of Tom Strong under DC's America's Best Comics imprint and writing and penciling a two-page X-Men story in X-Men: Millennial Visions, his final collaboration to date with inker Cam Smith. Kin, a six-issue miniseries created, written and penciled by Frank, was published under Image's Top Cow imprint. The story tells of a secret government agency named S.I.A. who discovers that a race of neanderthal men exists in the mountains of Alaska and proceed to eliminate them to obtain their technology, which developed differently from that of the rest of the world. The book's protagonist, S.I.A. agent Trey McAloon, is opposed to the agency's plans and confronts them about it, while the book's other main character, Alaskan Park Ranger Elizabeth Leaky, establishes contact with one of the neanderthals. The miniseries' conclusion was open-ended, with questions left unanswered, but so far no sequel or continuation of the story has been announced. The trade paperback collection of Kin entitled Kin: Descent of Man includes six pages of additional story that were not featured in the original issues. In 2000, Frank began his first collaboration with J. Michael Straczynski, the television writer and creator of Babylon 5. Frank served as penciller on Straczynski's Midnight Nation, a 12-issue limited series published by Top Cow from 2000 to 2002 under their now-defunct Joe's Comics imprint. The first issue of the series included a five-page interview with Frank and Straczynski. One of the inkers on the series was Jon Sibal, with whom Frank would begin a long-running artistic collaboration that continues to this day. On 16 July 2002, it was announced that Frank had signed an exclusive contract with Marvel. His first work under this contract was a two-issue story arc on The Avengers issues No. 61‚Äì62, written by Geoff Johns and inked by Jon Sibal. In 2003, Frank re-teamed with Straczynski on Supreme Power, a revamp of Marvel's superhero team Squadron Supreme,Manning \\"2000s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 316: \\"Writer J. Michael Straczynski and artist Gary Frank took a surprisingly dark reassessment of the Squadron Supreme.\\" published under their mature-audience Marvel MAX imprint. With its realism and mature storytelling, the series became Marvel's first MAX title to sell over 100,000 copies, making it their best-selling mature-readers series of all time. The series ran for 18 issues from October 2003 to October 2005. During his run on Supreme Power, Frank provided covers for a diverse number of Marvel series such as Silver Surfer No. 7; Wolverine/Punisher No. 2; The Incredible Hulk No. 75; issues No. 4 and 6 of the Supreme Power spin-off miniseries, Doctor Spectrum; The Amazing Spider-Man No. 515 and 517; Black Panther No. 10; and numerous others, as well as two pages of interior art for the Avengers: Finale one-shot. On 10 May 2007, having worked several years on a Marvel exclusive contract, Frank signed a new one with DC Comics. He served as the artist on Action Comics with writer Geoff Johns. The creative team produced the \\"Brainiac\\" storyline in which Superman's adopted father Jonathan Kent was killed.Cowsill, Alan \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 335: \\"In Action Comics story arc 'Brainiac', writer Geoff Johns and artist Gary Frank added another definitive chapter to one of the most iconic runs in the history of the comic.\\" Frank and Johns continued to work on Superman in the Superman: Secret Origin six-issue mini-series. The story features what Johns and DC Executive Editor Dan DiDio called a \\"definitive\\" telling of the origin story of Superman, dealing with his life in Smallville, his first adventure with the Legion of Super-Heroes as Superboy, and his arrival in Metropolis and at the Daily Planet.Cowsill \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 339: \\"Writer Geoff Johns and artist Gary Frank approached the story from a different angle than previous envisioners.\\" =2010s= In 2012, Frank and Johns collaborated on Batman: Earth One, an original graphic novel set on Earth-one of the DC Multiverse. The novel is the first in a series of graphic novels that redefines Batman. Since 2017, Johns and Frank have worked together on Doomsday Clock, a limited series featuring Superman and Doctor Manhattan. Work in other media In 1990, prior working in the comics industry, Gary Frank produced a book titled Rovers: Portrait of a Football Team, which featured caricatures of a number of Bristol Rovers F.C. players from the 1989‚Äì90 season. He wrote it in conjunction with then-Rovers player Geoff Twentyman. Frank's artwork was featured during the finale of the TV series Smallville when the character Chloe Sullivan is shown reading a Superman comic book to her son.

History Yulluna (also known as Yalarnga, Yalarrnga, Jalanga, Jalannga, Wonganja, Gunggalida, Jokula) is an Australian Aboriginal language. The Yulluna language region includes the local government boundaries of the Shire of Cloncurry. Kayardild (also known as Kaiadilt and Gayadilta) is a language of the Gulf of Carpentaria. The Kayardild language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Mornington Shire Council. The first European explorer to visit the region (and Australia) was the Dutch Willem Janszoon (whose name is also written as Jansz) in his 1605‚Äì06 voyage. His fellow countryman, Jan Carstenszoon (or Carstensz), visited in 1623 and named the gulf in honour of Pieter de Carpentier, at that time the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Abel Tasman also explored the coast in 1644. The region was later explored and charted by Matthew Flinders in 1802 and 1803. The first overland expedition to reach the Gulf was the Burke and Wills expedition, led by Robert O'Hara Burke and William John Wills which left Melbourne, Victoria in August 1860 and reached the mouth of the Bynoe River in February 1861. Geography The land bordering the Gulf is generally flat and low-lying. To the west is Arnhem Land, the Top End of the Northern Territory, and Groote Eylandt, the largest island in the Gulf. To the east is the Cape York Peninsula and Torres Strait which joins the Gulf to the Coral Sea. The area to the south (like the Cape York Peninsula, part of Queensland) is known as the Gulf Country. The Gulf Country supports the world's largest intact savanna woodlands as well as native grasslands, known as the Carpentaria tropical savanna. The woodlands also extend up the west and east coast of the Gulf. They are dominated by Eucalyptus and Melaleuca species from the family Myrtaceae. The climate is hot and humid with two seasons per year. The dry season lasts from about April until November and is characterized by very dry southeast to east winds, generated by migratory winter high pressure systems to the south. The wet season lasts from December to March. Most of the year's rainfall is compressed into these months, and during this period, many low- lying areas are flooded. The Gulf is prone to tropical cyclones during the period between November and April. The gulf experiences an average of three cyclones each year that are thought to transport sediments in a clockwise direction along the Gulf's coast.Harris, P.T., Heap, A., 2009. Cyclone-induced net sediment transport pathway on the continental shelf of tropical Australia inferred from reef talus deposits. Continental Shelf Research 29, 2011-2019. In many other parts of Australia, there are dramatic climatic transitions over fairly short distances. The Great Dividing Range, which parallels the entire east and south-east coast, is responsible for the typical pattern of a well- watered coastal strip, a fairly narrow band of mountains, and then a vast, inward-draining plain that receives little rainfall. In the Gulf Country, however, there are no mountains to restrict rainfall to the coastal band and the transition from the profuse tropical growth of the seaside areas to the arid scrubs of central Australia is gradual. In September and October the Morning Glory cloud appears in the Southern Gulf. The best vantage point to see this phenomenon is in the Burketown area shortly after dawn. It has been hypothesized that the Gulf experienced a major asteroid impact event in 536 AD.Richard A. Lovett (3 February 2010). Giant Meteorites Slammed Earth Around A.D. 500?. National Geographic News. National Geographic Society. Retrieved 3 March 2013. Coral reefs The Gulf of Carpentaria is known to contain fringing reefs and isolated coral colonies, but no near-surface patch or barrier reefs exist in the Gulf at the present time.Veron, J.E.N., 2000. Corals of the World. Australian Institute of Marine Science, Townsville. However, this has not always been the case. Expeditions carried out by Geoscience Australia in 2003 and in 2005 aboard the RV Southern Surveyor revealed the presence of a submerged coral reef province covering at least in the southern Gulf.Harris, P.T., Heap, A.D., Wassenberg, T., Passlow, V., 2004. Submerged coral reefs in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia. Marine Geology 207, 185-191. The patch reefs have their upper surfaces at a mean water depth of , were undetected by satellites or aerial photographs, and were only recognised using multibeam swath sonar surveys supplemented with seabed sampling and video. Their existence points to an earlier, late Quaternary phase of framework reef growth under cooler-climate and lower sea level conditions than today.  Major rivers  In the Top End the Roper River, Walker River and Wilton River flow into the Gulf. The Cox River, Calvert River, Leichhardt River, McArthur River, Flinders River, Norman River and the Gilbert River drain the Gulf Country. A number of rivers flow from the Cape York Peninsula into the Gulf, including Smithburne River, Mitchell River, Alice River, Staaten River, Mission River, Wenlock River, and Archer River.  Industry  Extensive areas of seagrass beds have allowed commercial shrimp operations in the Gulf. Zinc, lead and silver is mined from the McArthur River zinc mine and exported via the Gulf. Another zinc mine, Century Zinc is in the gulf on the Queensland side of the border. It exports its product through the port facility at Karumba. The cattle industry is also a very important part of the regional economy in the gulf. According to the then Chairman of the Gulf of Carpentaria's Commercial Fisherman's Organisation, Gary Ward, the number of sightings of Indonesian vessels fishing illegally in the gulf's waters increased in early 2005. By 2011 the numbers of illegal fishing boat interceptions had declined significantly with the cause attributed to enforcement efforts and education programs in Indonesia. =Major port plan= In 2012, a major new port located to the west of Karumba and rail connection to the North West Minerals Province was proposed by Carpentaria Rail. The advantages of a port at Karumba compared to Townsville was that it was three or four days closer to Asia via shipping routes. Additionally, expansion is taking place of the Bing Bong Port which services the McArthur River zinc mine, awarded the Northern Territory Earth award.  Physiography  The Gulf is one of the distinct physiographic sections of the larger (and surrounding) Carpentaria Basin province, which in turn is part of the larger East Australian Basins physiographic division.

McCain (DDG-56) is an currently in the service of the United States Navy. She is part of the Destroyer Squadron 15 within the Seventh Fleet, and has her homeport at the Yokosuka Naval Base in Yokosuka, Japan. The destroyer was involved in a collision with the tanker ship Alnic MC on 21 August 2017 off the coast of Singapore, which resulted in the deaths of ten of her crew, and left another five injured. Naming This warship was originally named after John S. McCain, Sr., and John S. McCain, Jr., both admirals in the United States Navy. John S. McCain, Sr. commanded the aircraft carrier , and later the Fast Carrier Task Force during the latter stages of World War II. John S. McCain, Jr. commanded the submarines and during World War II. He subsequently held a number of posts, rising to Commander-in-Chief of the United States Pacific Command, before retiring in 1972. These men were, respectively, the grandfather and father of Vietnam War Navy captain and later Senator John S. McCain III. On 11 July 2018, just 1 1/2 months before John McCain died, at a rededication ceremony, Senator John McCain was added as a namesake, along with his father and grandfather. The ship's nickname is \\"Big Bad John\\", and has the motto \\"Fortune Favors the Brave\\". Service =Construction and commissioning= John S. McCains keel was laid down on 3 September 1991, at the Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine. She was launched on 26 September 1992, sponsored by Cindy McCain, the wife of Senator John McCain III, and was commissioned on 2 July 1994, at the Bath Iron Works with Commander John K. Ross as the first Commanding Officer. The former President of the United States, George H. W. Bush, was the ceremony's principal speaker. McCAIN's maiden deployment was from 10 November 1995 to 10 May 1996 to the 5th and 7th fleets. After the ship returned to her home port of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii she shifted to a forward-deploy port in Yokosuka, Japan in 1997. =2000s= In January 2003, John S. McCain deployed to the Persian Gulf. She launched 39 Tomahawk missiles in support of the invasion of Iraq and was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for her service. John S. McCain was awarded the Navy Battle E for DESRON 15 in 2003 and again in 2004. On 16 February 2007, John S. McCain was awarded the 2006 Battle Effectiveness Award. On 11 June 2009, a Chinese submarine reportedly collided with the towed sonar array of John S. McCain near Subic Bay, Philippines. The incident caused damage to the array but was described as an \\"inadvertent encounter\\". In June 2009, John S. McCain pursued the North Korean cargo ship Kang Nam 1 toward Burma in enforcement of the new United Nations resolution of an arms export embargo against North Korea. The vessel was suspected of carrying arms for the Burmese junta government. Kang Nam 1 returned to North Korea without delivering her cargo to Burma. In July 2009, the destroyer berthed at Yokohama's international passenger terminal on a goodwill tour. The ship was opened to the public on 22 July 2009. =2010s= In March 2011, in company with the aircraft carrier , the ship was deployed off northeastern Honshu, Japan to assist with relief efforts after the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake. During that time, the ship may have been exposed to leaking radiation from the Fukushima I nuclear accidents. In April 2013, John S. McCain was sent to South Korea during escalating tensions between the Koreas. In June 2014, John S. McCain was sent to Subic Bay to perform in CARAT (Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training) exercises. On 2 October 2016, USS John S. McCain and made the first port visit by U.S. Navy ships to Cam Ranh Bay since end of the Vietnam War in 1975. In August 2017, John S. McCain sailed within of Mischief Reef in the South China Sea, exercising a claim to freedom of navigation. China, claiming sovereignty over the reef, expressed its \\"strong dissatisfaction\\" in response to the action. A US Navy representative reported that a Chinese frigate had sent at least ten radio messages warning that the John S. McCain was in Chinese waters, to which the US ship replied that it was \\"conducting routine operations in international waters.\\" =2017 MV Alnic MC collision= At 5:24 a.m. on 21 August 2017, John S. McCain was involved in a collision with the Liberian-flagged Alnic MC off the coast of Singapore and Malaysia, east of the Strait of Malacca. According to a United States Navy press release, the breach \\"resulted in flooding to nearby compartments, including crew berthing, machinery, and communications rooms.\\" Ten US Navy sailors died as a result of the crash, which prompted the Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) of Singapore to start a multi-agency SAR effort as the agency responsible for coordinating SAR operations within Singapore's Maritime Search and Rescue Region (MSRR). The Singapore Transport Safety Bureau (TSIB) also launched a marine safety investigation following the collision in accordance with the International Maritime Organisation's Casualty Investigation Code in Singapore's capacity as a coastal state, and published its final report on 8 March 2018. The U.S. Navy announced on 24 August 2017 that it had suspended search-and-rescue efforts for survivors in the open sea to focus on the recovery of the remains of the missing sailors still inside the flooded compartments of the ship. By 27 August U.S. Navy and Marine Corps divers had recovered the remains of all 10 sailors. On 12 September 2017, the United States' charge d'affaires Stephanie Syptak-Ramnath expressed thanks for Singapore's support during the SAR operations. Throughout 2018, she was under repair in drydock and by November 2018, the ship left drydock and was transferred to a pier to continue her repairs. The repairs were completed in October 2019.USS John S. McCain transfers from dry dock to pier following collision repairs Retrieved December 10, 2018. Investigation into the collision showed that an overly complex touchscreen system used for throttle control and training deficiencies had contributed to a loss of control of the ship just before it crossed paths with a merchant ship in the Singapore Strait, prompting a decision by the Navy to revert ships of this class to mechanical throttle controls fleetwide. =Awards= * Navy Unit Commendation - (Oct 1997-Apr 1998) * Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation - (2001, Apr 2012-Dec 2013) * Battle \\"E\\" - (1998, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2010) * Humanitarian Service Medal - (11-31 May 2011) 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake * James F.

Only Barnes Hall, the oldest residence hall at CMU, is not directly connected to a residential restaurant. The original section of Barnes Hall is also the only part of any residence hall on campus that has community bathrooms. Some residence halls are designated as official Residential Colleges, associated with a particular academic department, allowing students who choose to live there opportunities for study and collaboration with other students from similar programs. *Calkins Hall ‚Äì Business *Herrig Hall ‚Äì Music *Emmons Hall ‚Äì Health Professions *Woldt Hall ‚Äì Science and Engineering *Sweeney Hall ‚Äì Education and Human Services *Larzelere Hall ‚Äì Honors Program *Barnes Hall ‚Äì Leader Advancement Scholars & Public Service Residential Community *Troutman Hall ‚Äì Multicultural Advancement/Cofer Scholars CMU offers only co-ed residence halls, with Sweeney Hall converting from females only in the fall of 2010. Since the Fall 2005 semester, Calkins Hall, home of the Business residential college, is co-educational, after a long history of being females only. The other residence halls are either co-ed by building or by floor. In the fall of 2007, Beddow and Thorpe Halls became co-ed due to a decline in students requesting to live in single-gender residence halls. In the fall of 2009, Merrill Hall was added as a co-ed residence hall, leaving Sweeney Hall to be the only same gender hall on campus. Construction began on two more buildings, Celani and Fabiano, near the East Quad in the spring of 2005. The buildings are somewhat similar in design to the New Towers which opened in 2003. On December 1, 2005, one of the buildings was named The Ben and Marion Celani Residence hall to recognize the generosity of Detroit area businessman Thomas Celani and his wife Vicki. On April 20, 2006, the remaining building was named the Fabiano Family Residence Hall, recognizing their contribution to the school. John S. Fabiano served on the board of trustees 1999‚Äì2004, and also owns the Fabiano Brothers Inc, an alcohol distribution company. These two new halls opened for the fall semester of 2006, along with a new Residential Restaurant to serve the residents of the six East Area halls.

It makes light colored wines and ros√©s with very fruity aromas, strong acidity and tannins. The name Grignolino derives from the word grignole which means \\"many pips\\" in the local Piedmontese dialect of the Asti region. The abundance of pips, or seeds, contributes to the strong, bitter tannins associated with the wine. Modern winemakers try to avoid the excess tannins with gentle and slow pressings. Grignolino has three Denominazione di origine controllata (DOCs) that produce wine from it - Asti, Monferrato Casale, and Piemonte Grignolino. J. Robinson et al \\"Wine Grapes\\" First Edition pg 438 Penguin Books Ltd. 2012 History Ampelographers believe that the grape is native to the Monferrato hills located between the towns of Asti and Casale. The name Grignolino derives from the word grignole which means \\"many pips\\" in the local dialect of the region. J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 334 Oxford University Press 2006 Wines Producers in the Asti region try to model Grignolino on the wines of Beaujolais and those made from the Dolcetto grape in the Cuneo. These light bodied, pale colored wines are made to be consumed young and while waiting for the brawnier, Nebbiolo and Barbera based wines of the region age. While the grapes are relatively low in alcohol at around 11-12% ABV, they do have a significant amount of tannins due to the abundance of pips, or seeds. Modern winemaking techniques try to minimize the amount of tannin extraction by utilizing slow and gentle pressings. Wines made from Grignolino can have noticeably strong acidity and fruity aroma with alpine notes. Grignolino is highly prone to mutation, creating a significant amount of clonal variation. These different clones of Grignolino can impart different aromas and flavor characteristics ranging from green herbal, leafy notes and vegetable stock to raspberry and fruit. The grape is also highly reflective of its terroir and the different types of vineyard soils that it may be planted in. Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 113 Harcourt Books 2001 Grignolino is also prone to millerandage, with clusters (or even grapes within a single cluster) at different stages of ripening. The severity of the millderandage varies from year to year and can dramatically affect the quality and yield totals of any given vintage. J. Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 209 Mitchell Beazley 1986 =Wine regions= Grignolino is primarily planted in the Asti province of Piedmont and is rarely found outside this region. One notable exception is the California producer Heitz Wine Cellars that grows a limited amount in their Napa Valley vineyard. Grignolino is also grown in the Santa Clara Valley at Guglielmo Winery in Morgan Hill. Guglielmo produces a dry Grignolino rose and also a red wine, both 100% Grignolino. Additionally, Grignolino is grown and blended with Dolcetto by Ripken Vineyards and Winery in Lodi, CA.

The leaves of the grape vine are five-lobed with bunches that are long but compact, and deep green grapes that ripen in mid-late October in the Northern Hemisphere. In 2008, Gr√ºner Veltliner plantations in Austria stood at , and it accounts for 32.6% of all vineyards in the country, almost all of it being grown in the northeast of the country. Thus, it is the most-planted grape variety in Austria. Some is made into sparkling wine in the far northeast around Poysdorf. Along the Danube to the west of Vienna, in Wachau, Kremstal and Kamptal, it grows with Riesling in terraces on slopes so steep they can barely retain any soil. The result is a very pure, mineral wine capable of long aging, that stands comparison with some of the great wines of the world. In recent blind tastings organized by the Austrian Wine Marketing Board, Gr√ºner Veltliners have beaten world-class Chardonnays from the likes of Mondavi and Maison Louis Latour. Outside of Austria, Gr√ºner Veltliner is the second most widely grown white grape variety in the Czech Republic, encompassing approximately and resulting in approximately 11% of Czech wine production.Wine of Czech Republic: Statistics and Charts , accessed July 1, 2011 In recent years a few US wineries have started to grow and bottle Gr√ºner Veltliner, including wineries and vineyards in Massachusetts, Oregon, Maryland, the North Fork of Long Island AVA and Finger Lakes AVA regions of New York State, Napa Valley, Clarksburg AVA, Monterey AVA and Santa Ynez Valley AVA in California, Ashtabula County, Ohio, Southern New Jersey winery Bellview Winery, Pennsylvania, and along the Lake Michigan Shore AVA of Southwest Michigan. Gruner Veltliner is also planted in Australia, particularly in the Adelaide Hills wine region in South Australia, as well as the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, Canada. Some ampelographers (such as Hermann Goethe in his 1887 handbook of ampelography) have long assumed that Gr√ºner Veltliner is not related to the other varieties with \\"Veltliner\\" in their name (such as Roter Veltliner), or that it is only distantly related. A first DNA analysis in the late 1990s secured Traminer as one parent of Gr√ºner Veltliner, but was not able to identify the other parent among the candidates studied. The other parent was later found to be an originally unnamed variety of which only a single, abandoned, very old and weakened vine was found in Sankt Georgen am Leithagebirge outside Eisenstadt in Austria. The grape is therefore referred to as St. Georgener-Rebe or \\"St. Georgen-vine\\".J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 449-450 Allen Lane 2012 Gr√ºner Veltliner has a reputation of being a particularly food-friendly wine and is a popular offering on restaurant wine lists.Robinson, Jancis Vines, Grapes & Wines Mitchell Beazley 1986 It is made into wines of many different styles - much is intended for drinking young in the Heuriger (bars serving new wine) of Vienna, a little is made into sparkling wine, but some is capable of long aging. The steep vineyards of the Danube (Donau) west of Vienna produce very pure, mineral Gr√ºner Veltliners intended for laying down. Down in the plains, citrus and peach flavors are more apparent, with spicy notes of pepper and sometimes tobacco. History Location of Eisenstadt in the Burgenland region of eastern Austria near the town of Sankt Georgen am Leithagebirge where the surviving parent vine of Gr√ºner Veltliner, St. Georgener-Rebe, was found. Gr√ºner Veltliner has been believed to date back to Roman times, with its name being derived from Veltlin (Valtellina) in northern Italy, though ampelographers and wine historians have yet to find a link between the grape and the Italian commune. The grape is likely indigenous to Austria.T. Stevenson, ed. The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia (5th Edition) pgs 54,403, 448-451 Dorling Kindersley (2011) The current name appeared in a document for the first time in 1855; before that time it was known as Wei√ügipfler.Wein-Plus Glossar: Gr√ºner Veltliner, accessed 2013-01-22 Only by the 1930s was Gr√ºner Veltliner established as the standard name of the grape. Until the Second World War it was regarded as just another Austrian grape. It took Lenz Moser's Hochkultur system of vine training to really get the best out of it, and it expanded quickly in plantation from the 1950s to later become Austria's most planted variety. In recent years, Gr√ºner Veltliner has seen an uptick in interest following the results of a 2002 wine tasting organized by Masters of Wine Jancis Robinson and Tim Atkin. Here Gr√ºner Veltliner from Austria beat out several highly acclaimed white Grand cru wines from Burgundy. =Pedigree= Through Savagnin, Gr√ºner Veltliner is either a grandchild or a half-sibling of Pinot noir (pictured). In 2007, DNA analysis confirmed that Gr√ºner Veltliner was a natural crossing of Savagnin (Traminer) and an obscure Austrian grapevine from the village of Sankt Georgen am Leithagebirge located outside Eisenstadt in the Burgenland region of eastern Austria. The vine was first found in 2000 in an overgrown part of a pasture in a location where there had not been any vineyard since the late 19th century, and is assumed to have been the last vine in this location for over a century. Local experts were not able to determine the variety of the vine. Only when it was threatened to be ripped out in 2005 additional samples were taken and later analyzed at Klosterneuburg. Genetic analysis in the following years by Ferdinand Regner was able to determine that St. Georgener-Rebe is a parent variety to Gr√ºner Veltliner.Elternteil des Gr√ºnen Veltliners gefunden, Der Winzer 2009-08-06 Pressemappe zum Pressegespr√§ch ‚ÄûVater (-rebe) des Gr√ºnen Veltliner gefunden‚Äú, 2009-08-06 St. Georgener-Rebe was once known under the synonym Gr√ºner Muskateller but appears to have no direct relationship to the Muscat family of grapes. In February 2011, the single surviving vine of St. Georgener-Rebe, thought to be over 500 years old, was vandalized and severely cut in several places by an unknown assailant. The vine survived with the Austrian government designating the vine as a protected natural monument. Ampelographers are currently propagating cuttings of the vine for vineyard plantings and commercial cultivation.Nick Stephens \\"Unique, Ancient St Georgen Vine Vandalized \\" Bordeaux Undiscovered, February 15th, 2011 =Relationship to other grapes= Through its parent, Savagnin, Gr√ºner Veltliner is a half sibling of Rotgipfler and is either a grandchild or a half-sibling to Pinot noir which has a parent-offspring relationship with Savagnin. The nature of this relationship is unclear since DNA profiling has not yet determined between Pinot and Savagnin which grape is the parent and which grape is the offspring. Despite having the name Gr√ºner Veltliner, the grape has no known connection to other Veltliner grapes including Roter Veltliner and Fr√ºhroter Veltliner. The grey-berried vine Grauer Veltliner (also known as Veltliner Grau) was once thought to be a distinct grape variety but DNA evidence in 1996 showed that it was color mutation of Gr√ºner Veltliner. Viticulture Gr√ºner Veltliner being hand harvested at Hahndorf Hill vineyard in the Adelaide Hills. Gr√ºner Veltliner is a mid-ripening grape variety that usually does not have an issue achieving physiological ripeness in most of the northern European wine regions where it is grown. The vine can be very fruitful and high yielding producing small, yellowish-green berries. Gr√ºner Veltliner is very susceptible to the viticultural hazards of downy and powdery mildews as well as infestation from a species of rust mites that feed on grape leaves. While Gr√ºner Veltliner can grow on a variety of vineyard soils, wine expert Oz Clarke notes that the grape tends to thrive on soils with high loess content.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 114 Harcourt Books 2001 While newer vineyards have been experimenting with a variety of vine training systems, in Austria Gr√ºner Veltliner has been historically trained in the Lenz Moser style developed in the 1920s. Known as the \\"high culture\\" or Hochkultur method because of how relatively high () the vine trunk is allowed to grow, the goal is to reduce vine density by spacing the vines in wide rows that are 3.5 meters (11.5 ft) apart.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pgs 335, 399-400 Oxford University Press 2006 Wine regions Gr√ºner Veltliner is most closely associated with Austria where it is the most widely planted grape variety in the country, covering almost a third of all Austrian vineyards, with 17,034 hectares (42,092 acres) in cultivation in 2012. The grape is authorized in five Districtus Austriae Controllatus (DAC) regions‚Äîthe Weinviertel where it is the only permitted grape variety; Leithaberg where it can be made as a varietal or blended with Pinot blanc, Chardonnay and Neuburger; Traisental, Kremstal and Kamptal where it is planted with Riesling. The grape is also found in the Donauland (now known as the Wagram region) and in the Wachau region of Lower Austria. Along the Danube river warm air currents come in from the Pannonian Basin to the east and blow westward, warming the vines. This area tends to produce more full bodied wines with peach flavor notes. Gr√ºner Veltliner is widely planted in the vineyards along the Danube in Wachau. The Weinviertel region in the northeast, along the border with the Czech Republic and Slovakia, is home to more than half of all Austrian Gr√ºner Veltliner with 8,529 hectares (21,076 acres) reported in 2012. Here the grape can achieve very high yields (up to 100 hectoliters/hectare or 5.7 tonnes/acre) and can produce simple, quaffing wines with fresh acidity and crisp fruit as well as base wine for sparkling sekt. But in vineyards on favorable locations where the yields are restricted, wine producers can make examples of full-bodied, dry Gr√ºner Veltliner that has pepper, mineral and citrus notes that can develop Burgundian wine traits as they age. In the vineyard area around Lake Neusiedl along the border with Hungary there is 1,272 hectares (3,143 acres) of Gr√ºner Veltliner planted along the east side of the lake and 882 hectares (2,179 acres) planted in the Neusiedlersee- H√ºgelland \\"hill country\\" on the west side. Here some sweet Auslese and botryized Trockenbeerenauslese styles of Gr√ºner Veltliner can be produced. In Krems-Hollenburg, located just east of Krems an der Donau, one of the oldest vineyards in Austria still being used for commercial wine production is home to old vines of Gr√ºner Veltliner that are more than 150 years old. =Other European wine regions= Gr√ºner Veltliner is known as Veltlinske Zelen√© in Slovakia where it is the most widely planted white grape variety in the country. The grape's 3,805 hectares (9,402 acres) represent almost one-fifth of all grape plantings in the country. Across the border in the Czech Republic, the local synonym for Gr√ºner Veltliner is similar, Veltlinsk√© zelen√©, with 1,713 hectares (4,233 acres) in production as of 2011. In Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol wine region of north east Italy, along the border with Austria, virtually any grapevine with Veltliner in its name (particularly Veltliner bianco) is likely to be Gr√ºner Veltliner. At one point Fr√ºhroter Veltliner was planted in old vineyards of the Alto-Adige but most of those vines have been uprooted and replaced with other varieties. Gr√ºner Veltliner is a permitted variety in the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) wines of Valdadige DOC and Valle Isarco DOC. A Gr√ºner Veltliner from the Willamette Valley wine region of Oregon. In Germany, Gr√ºner Veltliner is the grape behind the historic Hansenwein produced in the village of Plochingen located outside Stuttgart in the W√ºrttemberg wine region. In France, the grape is not permitted in any Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) wine however there are a few hectares of Gr√ºner Veltliner being cultivated on an experimental basis in the country. There is 1,439 hectares (3,556 acres) of Gr√ºner Veltliner planted in Hungary where the grape is known as Z√∂ld Veltlini. The majority of these plantings are found in the western wine regions around Lake Balaton, the northern vineyards in the foothills of the M√°tra mountains and the southern wine regions of Tolna County and Kuns√°g. Some plantings of Gr√ºner Veltliner can also be found in Bulgaria. =In the New World= In recent years, plantings of Gr√ºner Veltliner have been expanding in the New World wine regions of Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada. In New Zealand, the grape was first planted in the Gisborne region on the North Island where the first commercial bottle of the wine was released by Coopers Creek Vineyard in 2008. From here plantings of Gr√ºner Veltliner spread to the South Island wine regions of Marlborough and Central Otago. It is grown in Central by Ata Mara vineyards one of the southernmost vineyards in the world. The first bottle of Gruner Veltliner was produced by Ata Mara in 2013. Central Otago has a climate similar to the region of Wachau in Austria with hot day time temperatures and cool nights. In Canada, Gr√ºner Veltliner is found in British Columbia. Across the border in the United States, the grape is planted on a small scale in California, Washington State, Oregon and New York. In Oregon, the grape is found in the American Viticultural Areas of the Chehalem Mountains, Eola-Amity Hills, Willamette Valley and Umpqua Valley. In the Umpqua Valley, Reustle Prayer Rock Vineyards is believed to be the first winery in the United States to produce a commercial Gr√ºner Veltliner with their 2005 release.Dan Berger \\"Go Ahead, Say It: Umpqua Better You Should Taste It\\" Appellation America.

October 12th, 2006 An Australian Gruner from Hahndorf Hill Winery in the Adelaide Hills In Australia, Gr√ºner Veltliner has seen an increase of interest and plantings which has led wine expert James Halliday to speculate that the grape may be \\"the next big thing\\" in Australian wine.James Halliday Gruner veltliner ‚Äì the next big thing? Australian Wine Companion. June 3, 2011 One of the earliest Gr√ºner Veltliner plantings in the country was in the Adelaide Hills wine region in the state of South Australia in 2008 by Hahndorf Hill Winery. The grape planting is part of an extensive effort of Adelaide Hills grower, chaired by Henschke's viticulturist, Prue Henschke, to make Gr√ºner Veltliner a signature variety for the region. Here the region's large diurnal temperature variation allow the grape to build sugar levels during the warm days but maintain a balance of acidity during the cool nights.Valerina Changarathil, Gruner Veltliner wine grape variety to be grown in Adelaide Hills Adelaide Now, January 25, 2011 The first varietal bottling of Gr√ºner Veltliner in Australia was released in 2009 by the Canberra winery Lark Hill followed by Hahndorf Hill in 2010. Styles Gr√ºner Veltliner can be produced in a variety of styles from simple jug wine meant to be consumed soon after the vintage to ageworthy wine that can continue to develop in the bottle. According to wine expert Oz Clarke, Gr√ºner Veltliner is usually not very aromatic in its youth, developing more tertiary aromas with age. Instead the grape often shows white pepper, lentil and celery note with some examples showing citrus notes and more full bodied examples having what Clarke describes as a \\"honeyed weight\\" to them. According to wine expert Tom Stevenson, Gr√ºner Veltliner is often lightly fruity with noticeable spice and characteristic white pepper note. Well-made examples from favorable vintages can have a similarity to Chardonnay produced in Burgundy. And, like Chardonnay, the variety can be made in an overly oaky and \\"fat\\" style. Unoaked examples can exhibit a minerality similar to Riesling. Master of Wine Jancis Robinson notes that Gr√ºner Veltliner is usually produced dry with spicy, peppery notes. It is often full-bodied and with age can take on aromas and flavors similar to white Burgundies.

Kaplan was also involved in Jewish affairs and was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. He contributed substantial sums of money to the Jewish Memorial Hospital in Boston and Brandeis University. He received numerous awards and honorary degrees, including the Amistad Award of the American Missionary Association and honorary degrees from Wilberforce University, Hebrew Union College, and Lincoln University. He and his wife Emily fought in support of civil rights for all. He was one of the last in a long line of American Jews who held a leadership role in African American civil rights groups.

It is a method of memory-mapped file I/O. It implements demand paging, because file contents are not read from disk directly and initially do not use physical RAM at all. The actual reads from disk are performed in a \\"lazy\\" manner, after a specific location is accessed. After the memory is no longer needed, it is important to \`munmap(2)\` the pointers to it. Protection information can be managed using \`mprotect(2)\`, and special treatment can be enforced using \`madvise(2)\`. In Linux, macOS and the BSDs, \`mmap\` can create several types of mappings. Other operating systems may only support a subset of these, for example, shared mappings may not be practical in an operating system without a global VFS or I/O cache. History The original design of memory mapped files came from the TOPS-20 operating system. \`mmap\` and associated systems calls were designed as part of the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) version of Unix. Their API was already described in the 4.2BSD System Manual, even though it was neither implemented in that release, nor in 4.3BSD. Sun Microsystems had implemented this very API, though, in their SunOS operating system. The BSD developers at U.C. Berkeley requested Sun to donate its implementation, but these talks never led to any transfer of code; 4.3BSD-Reno was shipped instead with an implementation based on the virtual memory system of Mach.  File-backed and anonymous  File-backed mapping maps an area of the process's virtual memory to files; i.e. reading those areas of memory causes the file to be read. It is the default mapping type. Anonymous mapping maps an area of the process's virtual memory not backed by any file. The contents are initialized to zero. In this respect an anonymous mapping is similar to \`malloc\`, and is used in some \`malloc(3)\` implementations for certain allocations. However, anonymous mappings are not part of the POSIX standard, though implemented by almost all operating systems by the \`MAP_ANONYMOUS\` and \`MAP_ANON\` flags.  Memory visibility  If the mapping is shared (the \`MAP_SHARED\` flag is set), then it is preserved across a fork(2) system call. This means that writes to a mapped area in one process are immediately visible in all related (parent, child or sibling) processes. If the mapping is shared and backed by a file (not \`MAP_ANONYMOUS\`) the underlying file media is only guaranteed to be written after it is msync(2)'ed. If the mapping is private (the \`MAP_PRIVATE\` flag is set), the changes will neither be seen by other processes nor written to the file. A process reading from or writing to the underlying file will not always see the same data as a process that has mapped the file, since the segment of the file is copied into RAM and periodically flushed to disk. Synchronization can be forced with the \`msync\` system call. mmap(2)ing files can significantly reduce memory overhead for applications accessing the same file; they can share the memory area the file encompasses, instead of loading the file for each application that wants access to it. This means that mmap(2) is sometimes used for Interprocess Communication (IPC). On modern operating systems, mmap(2) is typically preferred to the System V IPC Shared Memory facility. The main difference between System V shared memory (shmem) and memory mapped I/O (mmap) is that SystemV shared memory is persistent: unless explicitly removed by a process, it is kept in memory and remains available until the system is shut down. mmap'd memory is not persistent between application executions (unless it is backed by a file).  Example of usage under the C programming language  #include #include #include #include #include #include #include #include /* Does not work on OS X, as you can't mmap over /dev/zero */ int main(void) { const char str1[] = \\"string 1\\"; const char str2[] = \\"string 2\\"; pid_t parpid = getpid(), childpid; int fd = -1; char *anon, *zero; if ((fd = open(\\"/dev/zero\\", O_RDWR, 0))  -1) err(1, \\"open\\"); anon = (char*)mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READPROT_WRITE, MAP_ANONMAP_SHARED, -1, 0); zero = (char*)mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READPROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0); if (anon  MAP_FAILED  zero  MAP_FAILED) errx(1, \\"either mmap\\"); strcpy(anon, str1); strcpy(zero, str1); printf(\\"PID %d:\\\\tanonymous %s, zero- backed %s \\", parpid, anon, zero); switch ((childpid = fork())) { case -1: err(1, \\"fork\\"); /* NOTREACHED */ case 0: childpid = getpid(); printf(\\"PID %d:\\\\tanonymous %s, zero-backed %s \\", childpid, anon, zero); sleep(3); printf(\\"PID %d:\\\\tanonymous %s, zero-backed %s \\", childpid, anon, zero); munmap(anon, 4096); munmap(zero, 4096); close(fd); return EXIT_SUCCESS; } sleep(2); strcpy(anon, str2); strcpy(zero, str2); printf(\\"PID %d:\\\\tanonymous %s, zero-backed %s \\", parpid, anon, zero); munmap(anon, 4096); munmap(zero, 4096); close(fd); return EXIT_SUCCESS; } sample output: PID 22475: anonymous string 1, zero-backed string 1 PID 22476: anonymous string 1, zero-backed string 1 PID 22475: anonymous string 2, zero-backed string 2 PID 22476: anonymous string 2, zero-backed string 2  See also  * Virtual memory for when there is more address space than physical memory * Paging for the implementation of virtual memory * Page cache for a disk caching mechanism utilized by mmap * Demand paging for a scheme implemented by mmap  References   Further reading  *Description from POSIX standard *Differences: **DragonFly BSD **FreeBSD **NetBSD **OpenBSD **illumos **Mac OS X **Solaris **HP-UX **QNX *Windows **MapViewOfFile win32 function is somewhat equivalent to mmap. *More example source code: ** SharedHashFile, An open source, shared memory hash table implemented using mmap().

Methamphetamine psychosis, or long-term effects of stimulant use in the brain (at the molecular level), depend upon genetics and may persist for some time. The most common causative agents are substituted amphetamines, including substituted cathinones, as well as certain dopamine reuptake inhibitors such as cocaine and phenidates. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of stimulant psychosis vary depending on the drug ingested, but generally involve the symptoms of organic psychosis such as hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, and thought disorder. Other symptoms may include mania, erratic behavior, and aggression. Cause =Substituted amphetamines= Drugs in the class of amphetamines, or substituted amphetamines, are known to induce \\"amphetamine psychosis\\" typically when chronically abused or used in high doses. In an Australian study of 309 active methamphetamine users, 18% had experienced a clinical level psychosis in the past year.McKetin R, McLaren J, Lubman DI, Hides L. The prevalence of psychotic symptoms among methamphetamine users. Addiction 2006;101(10):1473‚Äì8. Common amphetamines include methamphetamine, ephedrine, MDMA, as well as substituted cathinones like methcathinone, MDPV, and mephedrone, though a large number of other related compounds have been recently synthesized. Methylphenidate is sometimes incorrectly included in this class, although it is nonetheless still capable of producing stimulant psychosis. The symptoms of amphetamine psychosis include auditory and visual hallucinations, grandiosity, delusions of persecution, and delusions of reference concurrent with both clear consciousness and prominent extreme agitation. A Japanese study of recovery from methamphetamine psychosis reported a 64% recovery rate within 10 days rising to an 82% recovery rate at 30 days after methamphetamine cessation. However it has been suggested that around 5‚Äì15% of users fail to make a complete recovery in the long term. Furthermore, even at a small dose, the psychosis can be quickly reestablished. Psychosocial stress has been found to be an independent risk factor for psychosis relapse even without further substituted amphetamine use in certain cases. The symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis are very similar to those of the acute phase of schizophrenia although in amphetamine psychosis visual hallucinations are more common and thought disorder is rare. Amphetamine psychosis may be purely related to high drug usage, or high drug usage may trigger an underlying vulnerability to schizophrenia. There is some evidence that vulnerability to amphetamine psychosis and schizophrenia may be genetically related. Relatives of methamphetamine users with a history of amphetamine psychosis are five times more likely to have been diagnosed with schizophrenia than relatives of methamphetamine users without a history of amphetamine psychosis. The disorders are often distinguished by a rapid resolution of symptoms in amphetamine psychosis, while schizophrenia is more likely to follow a chronic course.McIver C, McGregor C, Baigent M, Spain D, Newcombe D, Ali R. Guidelines for the medical management of patients with methamphetamine-induced psychosis. Drug and Alcohol Services: South Australia 2006. Although rare and not formally recognized,American Psychiatric Association. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, DSM-IV-TR. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association; 2000. a condition known as Amphetamine Withdrawal Psychosis (AWP) may occur upon cessation of substituted amphetamine use and, as the name implies, involves psychosis that appears on withdrawal from substituted amphetamines. However, unlike similar disorders, in AWP, substituted amphetamines reduce rather than increase symptoms, and the psychosis or mania resolves with resumption of the previous dosing schedule. =Cocaine= Cocaine has a similar potential to induce temporary psychosis with more than half of cocaine abusers reporting at least some psychotic symptoms at some point. Typical symptoms of sufferers include paranoid delusions that they are being followed and that their drug use is being watched, accompanied by hallucinations that support the delusional beliefs. Delusional parasitosis with formication (\\"cocaine bugs\\") is also a fairly common symptom. Cocaine- induced psychosis shows sensitization toward the psychotic effects of the drug. This means that psychosis becomes more severe with repeated intermittent use. =Phenidates= Methylphenidate and its analogues (e.g., ethylphenidate, 4F-MPH, and isopropylphenidate) share similar pharmacological profiles as norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors. Chronic abuse of methylphenidate has potential to lead to psychosis. Similar psychiatric side effects have been reported in a study of ethylphenidate.. No studies regarding psychosis and 4F-MPH or isopropylphenidate have been conducted but given their high DAT binding and cellular uptake activity, the possibility of stimulant psychosis exists. =Caffeine= There is limited evidence that caffeine, in high doses or when chronically abused, may induce psychosis in normal individuals and worsen pre-existing psychosis in those diagnosed with schizophrenia. Diagnosis =Differential diagnosis= Though less common than stimulant psychosis, stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines as well as the dissociative drug phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust) may also cause a theorized severe and life-threatening condition known as excited delirium. This condition manifests as a combination of delirium, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, delusions, hallucinations, speech disturbances, disorientation, violent and bizarre behavior, insensitivity to pain, elevated body temperature, and hysterical strength.\\"White Paper Report on Excited Delirium Syndrome\\", ACEP Excited Delirium Task Force, American College of Emergency Physicians, 10 September 2009 Despite some superficial similarities in presentation excited delirium is a distinct (and more serious) condition than stimulant psychosis. The existence of excited delirium is currently debated. Transition to schizophrenia A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis by Murrie et al found that the pooled proportion of transition from amphetamine- induced psychosis to schizophrenia was 22% (5 studies, CI 14%‚Äì34%). This was lower than cannabis (34%) and hallucinogens (26%), but higher than opioid (12%), alcohol (10%) and sedative (9%) induced psychoses. Transition rates were slightly lower in older cohorts but were not affected by sex, country of the study, hospital or community location, urban or rural setting, diagnostic methods, or duration of follow-up . Treatment Treatment consists of supportive care during the acute intoxication phase: maintaining hydration, body temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate at acceptable levels until the drug is sufficiently metabolized to allow vital signs to return to baseline. Typical and atypical antipsychotics have been shown to be helpful in the early stages of treatment. In the instance of persistent psychosis after repeated use of stimulants, there are cases in which electroconvulsive therapy has been beneficial. This is followed by abstinence from psychostimulants supported with counseling or medication designed to assist the individual preventing a relapse and the resumption of a psychotic state.

It is mainly grown in the Gaillac and Limoux regions in the southwest of France. Total French plantations of Mauzac stood at in the year 2000. In Gaillac its aromatic wines are blended with Len de l'El to create mildly sweet and sparkling white blended wines. Since the late 1980s, some Gaillac producers have created an interest in Mauzac by producing better wines. In Limoux, Mauzac is a compulsory part of the Blanquette de Limoux, where it may be blended with Chenin blanc and Chardonnay. However, in Limoux, plantations of Mauzac are decreasing at it is losing ground to Chardonnay. The grape is also one of the seven permitted white varieties in Bordeaux wine. Mauzac buds and ripens late, and was traditionally picked quite late, when temperatures had dropped in Limoux. This allowed for slow fermentation which preserved residual sugar for a \\"natural\\" second fermentation in the spring, creating a sparkling wine. Today, it is more common to pick Mauzac earlier, giving a more crisp wine with higher acidity, but also without much of its particular aromas.

One of the features of the opening ceremony was the absence of all Liberal or Venizelist members. The anti-Venizelist campaign, in spite of all statements to the contrary, did not appear to have died down. On January 5, Athens was the scene of another wanton act of political vendetta - the murder of Colonel Fatseas, a prominent Venizelist officer. Resumption of war The intention declared in the royal speech at the opening of the Chamber of resuming the war against Kemal was supported by an official report issued on January 10 of a renewal of the Greek offensive to the northeast of Smyrna and in the Brussa area, and the same day the Greeks occupied Belejik. On the following day the Greek Liberal organ Patris published a letter from Nice, where Venizelos was residing at the time, confirming the Greek statesman's final decision to retire from politics. This decision was naturally not displeasing to the supporters of King Constantine, who a little later found another cause for jubilation when the king of Italy received the newly appointed Greek minister to Rome (January 13). Thus Italy was the first among foreign Allied and neutral powers to recognize King Constantine. But the enthusiasm was soon damped by the joint representations made on the 20th to the Greek government by the British and French ministers in Athens on the transformation of the Chamber into a National Assembly. This action by the two Allied governments was declared to be based on the rights of the powers in question as guarantors of the constitution of Greece, rights which they considered as still existent, since the Treaty of S√®vres, in which they were surrendered, had not yet been ratified by all the signatories. Early in February the Allied Supreme Council invited the Greek and Turkish governments to attend a conference to be held in the latter part of the month in London with the object of bringing about peace between the two countries. The invitation was coldly received in Athens, and was the cause of a split in the Dimitrios Rallis cabinet on the score of wounded personal vanities. Dimitrios Gounaris, minister of war, the real leader of the Constantino faction, who, in deference to Allied public opinion, which had stigmatized him as a pro-German, had after the defeat of the Venizelists been compelled to renounce his claims to the premiership in favor of the less compromised Rallis, after being also refused the presidency of the Greek delegation to the London conference, resigned, bringing about a ministerial crisis. New government The Rallis cabinet was succeeded by a new governmentGale Encyclopedia with Nikolaos Kalogeropoulos, of no outstanding political ability, but having the reputation of an Entente-phile, as premier and minister of foreign affairs, Gounaris resuming his post as minister of war, Petros Protopapadakis - finance and supplies, Th. Zaimis - education, Petros Mavromichalis - agriculture and national economy, Tsaldaris - interior and communications, Theotokis - justice, Rallis Jr. - marine. Apparently Gounaris continued to press his claims to be chief Greek delegate at the London conference, but according to the Greek press, \\"on learning the unfavorable impression created in London by the reports of his intention to represent Greece\\", he agreed to the nomination of Kalogeropoulos. Meanwhile, the promises held out to the Greek masses by the Constantinists in the course of their electoral campaign, for the early cessation of hostilities and of mobilizations, the reduction of taxation, and the regulation of the labor question on lines proposed by the Socialist Party, which supported the anti-Venizelist campaign, not having been redeemed, internal unrest among the urban proletariat began to manifest itself in a series of industrial strikes (gas, electric light, tramway and electric railway workers) in Athens, and threatened to develop into a general stoppage of work all over the country (February 12). The Liberal Party which had up until then held itself aloof from politics decided, in view of the fact that the fate of Greece and of her new territorial acquisitions were in the balance in London, to renounce its attitude of passive opposition, and in all matters of national importance which possessed an international aspect, to join the \\"united national front\\". This, together with certain declarations made by Venizelos to the foreign press in which he declared his wholehearted support of the national aspirations, gave birth to rumors regarding a rapprochement between the ex-premier and King Constantine. But the rumors were short-lived, for Venizelos, on February 16, denied their truth. London conference On February 18 the Greek delegation, headed by the premier Kalogeropoulos, and including a number of economic and military experts, arrived in London. The conference opened on the 21st, and the Supreme Council heard the Greek delegation.A Region of Death by Stavros Stavridis a Historian/Researcher at the National Center for Hellenic Studies and Research at Latrobe University in Bundoora, Victoria in Australia. The Greek premier declared that Greece was prepared and willing to clear Anatolia of the Turkish Nationalists. After also hearing Turkish delegations both from Constantinople and Angora, the Supreme Council proposed the dispatch of an international commission of inquiry to study on the spot the general situation in Smyrna and Thrace. Kalogeropoulos referred this proposal to Athens, where it was rejected by the National Assembly. As Kalogeropoulos appeared not to be invested with full powers to bind his self on behalf of the Greek government, the Supreme Council demanded the dispatch to London of a new Greek plenipotentiary. After protracted negotiations as to his being accepted as persona grata by the Allies, Gounaris arrived in London on March 9. Three days later the Supreme Council formulated proposals for the solution of the Greco-Turkish difficulty and for a modification of the S√®vres Treaty. It was proposed that the demilitarized zone of the Straits should be reduced to the following lines: on the European side - Gallipoli peninsula and the coast along the Sea of Marmora as far as Rodosto; on the Asiatic side - from a point opposite the isle of Tenedos to Kara-Bigha (west of Panderma), including the islands in the Sea of Marmora and the European and Asiatic shores of the Bosporus; the expression \\"demilitarized\\" zone was to mean that whereas the Allies might send troops to this zone, both Greece and Turkey should be deprived of this right; the east coast of the Sea of Marmora was excluded from the demilitarized zone; the Allied troops occupying Constantinople were to be withdrawn, after the Allies had satisfied themselves of the bona-fide peaceful intentions of the Turks; Turkey was to have an equal voice on the international committee established to control the Straits, receiving two votes instead of one; and if Turkey's attitude on the whole proved satisfactory, she would, in all probability, be offered the honorary presidency of the commission. Turkey was also to receive a place on a voting basis instead of in an advisory capacity on the financial commission; Thrace was not to be internationalized, and as for the Smyrna area it was considered desirable to leave the Greek and Turkish inhabitants in their own districts; the sovereignty of the sultan over the vilayet of Smyrna was to be restored, the city of Smyrna to be occupied by Greek troops, but elsewhere in the vilayet order should be maintained by local gendarmes under Allied officers; a Christian governor should be appointed, chosen by the League of Nations; a revision of this status to be granted after five years if applied for to the League of Nations; Turkey should be included in the League of Nations if she consents to ratify a modification of the S√®vres Treaty on the above lines. After London The Greek and Turkish delegations on receiving these proposals from the Supreme Council left London to submit them to their respective governments. Simultaneously with the departure of the Greek delegation from London a royal decree called up the 1913, 1914, and 1915 classes of Greek reservists, and King Constantine issued a proclamation declaring Greece's intention to continue the war against the Kemalists in order to ensure the pacification of the Orient. On March 23 a New Greek offensive was launched in Asia Minor. The Hellenic troops advancing in two separate lines in the neighborhood of Ushak and Brussa, compelled the Turkish forces to retreat. The Greek offensive continued successfully, and on March 27 and 28 the Greeks occupied two important strategical points, Afium-Karahissar and Eski≈üehir. On April 1 Gounaris, emboldened by the fact of his being \\"officially\\" recognized by the Allies in London, at last assumed the premiership on the resignation of Kalogeropoulos, who received the portfolio of finance. Some time previously Kalogeropoulos had ceded the portfolio of foreign affairs to Georgios Valtatzis, who remained foreign minister under Gounaris. Immediately upon the reconstruction of the cabinet King Constantine left for the front accompanied by the prince Andrew and prince Nicholas. A further mobilization of officers of the 1910-13 classes was ordered. The Turks showed stubborn resistance to the east of Eskishehr, and on April 4 it was reported that the Greeks had suffered a severe check. By this time the renewed outbreak of hostilities on a large scale in Anatolia convinced the Allies that no replies to the proposals of the Supreme Council were to be expected from the Greek and Turkish governments.Complete History of the World War I Internal situation The internal situation in Greece, notwithstanding all official assurances to the contrary, continued to be serious, particularly in Macedonia, Salonica, and Crete, and consequently on April 12 martial law was proclaimed and a censorship of the press reintroduced. During the month of May the military situation in Anatolia remained indefinite, the Greeks suspending their offensive in order to prepare for a renewal of operations on a larger scale. On May 18 the Allied high commissioners issued a proclamation regarding the neutrality of Constantinople and the Straits. By the beginning of June the preparations for the new Greek offensive were near completion, and on the 11th King Constantine once more left for Smyrna accompanied by the Diadoch, Prince Nicholas and Prince Andrew, the premier, Gounaris, the minister of war, Theotokis, and General Dousmanis, chief of the general staff. On June 20 the Allies despatched a note to Greece renewing their offer of intervention between the two warring parties. The Greek government, after having submitted its decision to King Constantine in Smyrna for approval, replied by a note dated June 25 in which it in effect refused the proffered negotiations. Preparations for the new offensive were continued. The Greeks in the meantime evacuated Ismidt, thus considerably weakening the defensive of the Kemalists. In the early part of July the Greeks made some progress in their offensive, occupying Nicaea and advancing from Brussa to Yenisher, reoccupying by July 15 Afium Karahissar, evacuated in the spring retreat, and three days later Kutahia, an important key position. The battle of Kutahia ended in a rout of the Kemalist forces with a great haul of booty and prisoners for the Greeks, the fall of Eskishehr, and the general retreat of the Turks. Renewal of offensive About the middle of August the Greeks renewed the offensive in the direction of Angora and Koniah. The Greek troops crossed the river Sakaria where they met with strong resistance from the Turks, and by the middle of September the Turks were able to check the Greek onslaught. On September 4 it was officially announced that owing to ill-health King Constantine was obliged to move from Eskishehr to Brussa. This was the first veiled intimation of a reverse suffered by the Greek forces, and it was followed, five days later, by the further announcement that the general staff had decided for the time being \\"to suspend the efforts of the Greek armies\\", a decision which was followed by the complete withdrawal of Greek troops to the west of the Sakaria river. A statement to the effect that the Greek government had requested Lord Robert Cecil to invite the mediation of the League of Nations between Greece and Turkey was officially repudiated, but at the same time Greek government circles did not deny that Greece had informed Britain of the conditions on which she was prepared to make peace with Angora (September 20). Gounaris actually contemplated visiting London in connection with the possibility of Britain consenting to act as mediator. The National Assembly On October 3 Nikolaos Stratos, one of the chiefs of the opposition and leader of the National Reformist Party, had an audience of the king, and demanded the convocation of the National Assembly so that the latter should take a responsible decision regarding the general political situation and the desirability of requesting foreign mediation in the Turkish-Greek conflict. The National Assembly was hurriedly convened on October 16, and after hearing a statement by the premier, granted Gounaris a vote of confidence and endorsed his decision to visit London and Paris. After meeting with a cold reception in Paris, Gounaris and Valtatzis (the foreign minister) arrived in London on October 27 and saw the Marquess Curzon at the British Foreign Office. At the suggestion of the British foreign secretary a meeting of the foreign ministers of Great Britain, France, and Italy to be held at a future date was proposed to discuss the Near Eastern questions. As Gounaris' mission to London had failed to bring about any definite results the Greek premier and foreign minister left London for Rome, where lately a less hostile attitude to Greece had been noticeable. In the meantime internal party strife continued in Greece, and great excitement was caused in Athens by the election in Constantinople in December as Ecumenical Patriarch of Mgr. Meletios Metaxakis, the ex-archbishop of Athens, deposed in 1920 in consequence of his Venizelist sympathies. On December 21 an attempt was made in Athens to assassinate Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis, the ex-regent and prominent Venizelist. End of the year The year 1921 closed for Greece with the same indefinite conditions as at its opening. The war waged for over two years in Asia Minor was as far from a conclusion as ever; and the internal political and economic situation was once more critical. It is intelligible, therefore, that rumors of King Constantine's second (this time voluntary) abdication should have found currency in Greece.

History  The SSC provides specialized competence in space subsystems, space and satellite operations, rocket and balloon systems including experiment equipment, launch services, aerospace engineering services as well as airborne maritime surveillance systems. Through its wholly owned subsidiaries ECAPS and NanoSpace, the SSC is also engaged in the development of environmentally friendly propulsion systems and micromechanical systems for space applications. From its facility Esrange Space Center in Northern Sweden, the SSC launches sounding rockets and high- altitude balloons for research in the areas of microgravity, astrophysics, astronomy and atmospheric studies. One notable program during the late 1980s/early 1990s was a joint project with the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies using SSC's MASER rocket to lift aloft various experiments requiring microgravity environments, at a low cost. This was during a period when U.S. Space Shuttle flights along with associated planned experiments were still being disrupted by the aftermath of the Challenger disaster. At Esrange SSC operates one of the world's busiest civilian satellite ground stations, communicating with both telecom and scientific satellites. The SSC's facility Stockholm Teleport provides satellite communication services, and the wholly owned German company LSE is specialised in satellite control and ground station services. The SSC runs a global ground station network, PrioraNet, in which its US subsidiary Universal Space Network plays a big part. On 1 July 2011, the SSC sold its satellite division to the German space company OHB which then formed a Swedish subsidiary named OHB-Sweden. In February 2013, a government audit was released by the Swedish National Audit Office which concluded that \\"Swedish space investment is distributed among multiple organizations that operate as stovepipes with no real communication between them and no common ambition.\\" While approximately is spent each year on Swedish space initiatives, the audit report calls for additional \\"government oversight of the European Space Agency (ESA) and a review of the Swedish Space Corporation's structure and mission.\\" The SSC announced on 21 September 2020 that it was not renewing its contract to help operate Chinese satellites from its ground stations, and that it would cease doing business in China altogether.

It marked their first release with Warner Bros. Records after an unpleasant split with Roadrunner Records. It was released on July 9, 2002. As with their first full-length album, Worship and Tribute was produced by Ross Robinson and mixed and engineered by Mike Fraser. It peaked at #82 on the Billboard 200 on July 27, 2002, remaining on the chart for three weeks. It is recognized as one of the greatest post-hardcore albums and one of the greatest albums of the 2000s. Production and style Originally, Worship and Tribute was to have twelve songs with the last song entitled \\"Convectuoso.\\" The band, however, had recorded the song with their previous label, Roadrunner Records, for the \\"Ry Ry's Song\\" single. Since Glassjaw abruptly ended their contract to sign with Warner Bros., Roadrunner retained the rights to that song and refused to let the newly rerecorded \\"Convectuoso\\" be released on the final album despite being on promotional copies. Vocalist Daryl Palumbo has stated that while Glassjaw's debut album was filled with negativity, Worship and Tribute is much more optimistic in tone. Regarding the album title, Palumbo expressed how the bands that influenced Glassjaw have shaped their musical identity and are therefore being honored through Glassjaw's music: :\\"You are only a sum of all of your influences and that's what we are. . . I think that we're original and I think that what we're doing is different and that's something I always knew we had on our side, but no matter how original you are you're still just a sum of your influences.\\" Guitarist Todd Weinstock has regarded continuity as the biggest difference between Glassjaw's debut album and Worship and Tribute, noting \\"EYEWTKAS was just kind a bunch of songs written over years and when we got signed we were like 'okay we got some songs we can throw together.' With Worship we went into it with the intentions of writing an album that made sense as a unit as opposed to a bunch of songs, some of which may have even been written four years earlier!\\" He also noted that, due to the fact that the album was written around the time of the September 11 attacks, its tone was affected by the tragedy. Promotion and touring \\"Cosmopolitan Bloodloss\\" and \\"Ape Dos Mil\\" were released as singles. Music videos for both tracks were included on the CD. In addition, a second version for \\"Ape Dos Mil\\" was later released. \\"Cosmopolitan Bloodloss\\" was released to Active rock radio on September 27, 2002.Maxwell 2002, p. 127 \\"Ape Dos Mil\\" was released to Modern rock radio on February 11, 2003. Dave Allen joined Glassjaw as bassist following the recording of Worship and Tribute. The band then toured extensively, including festival tours such as Warped Tour, Ozzfest and SnoCore. Daryl Palumbo's Crohn's disease brought heavy burden onto Glassjaw's touring schedule in promotion of Worship and Tribute. On October 1, 2002, he was rushed to a Paris hospital and Glassjaw's European tour schedule was postponed for December. However, on December 5, as Glassjaw returned from a US flight, Palumbo relapsed and was again rushed to a London hospital and forced the cancellation of the rescheduled dates. Palumbo was ordered to take two months off, and the European dates were rescheduled for a second time in April 2003. From June to August, the group went on the 2003 edition of Warped Tour. The band performed the album in full at the Sonisphere Festival at Knebworth on the 10th anniversary of the album's release. Packaging The original 2002 CD release of the album did not include a front insert, but rather a clear film sheet that had a picture of a record player arm. The disc itself was designed to look like a vinyl record, and the inside tray included a picture of a record player. The overall product is supposed to look like a vinyl record being played on a record player. The album was reissued for the first time on vinyl format in 2011 for Record Store Day. The record was packaged in a clear plastic sleeve with a picture of a record player arm printed on the front of the sleeve. It also included a sheet with the picture of the record player printed on it. This first pressing is known for its PVC sleeve which caused a chemical reaction and damaged the record within it. The vinyl version was reissued again in 2014, with 1,000 copies pressed on clear vinyl. Critical reception Allmusic's William Ruhlmann gave Worship and Tribute a positive review, noting \\"Cosmopolitan Bloodloss\\" an AMG Track Pick. He described Glassjaw as \\"more interesting than their metal peers\\" and reflected \\"Glassjaw can pound it out like the best of them, but the fun comes in never knowing what variation the band will throw in next.\\" Billboard called the album \\"innovative.\\" Pitchfork referred to the album as a \\"genre-defining work.\\" NME declared Worship and Tribute to be \\"the greatest ‚Äòunderground breakthrough‚Äô album since Deftones.\\" The Long Island Press called it \\"the album that helped rethink, reshape, and expand the boundaries of the genre\\". Mehan Jayasuriya of PopMatters noted \\"Worship and Tribute addressed many of these lyrical flaws [of Glassjaw's debut album] and introduced a wider palette of sounds to the band‚Äôs arsenal; in so doing, however, it lost sight of much of the momentum and focus that made the band notable in the first place.\\" Adrien Begrand, also of PopMatters, gave an in-depth review where he acknowledged the band's talent in select songs but also stressed the poor quality of Worship and Tribute as a whole: \\"They've shown they're a smart band, both musically and lyrically, but on Worship and Tribute, listeners are stuck with 40 percent inspiration, 60 percent filler.\\" Kludge included it on their list of best albums of 2002. The January 2008 issue of Alternative Press (AP #234) included Worship and Tribute on its \\"10 Essential Albums We‚Äôre Waiting For Follow Ups to.\\" The issue also hyped the oncoming Head Automatica album. NME listed the album as one of \\"20 Emo Albums That Have Resolutely Stood The Test Of Time\\". Sputnikmusic listed the album at No. 15 in their list of the Top 100 Albums of the 2000s. Paste listed the album at No. 7 in their list of the 25 Greatest Punk Albums of the 2000s. =Awards= *Nominated for a Best Recording Package Grammy in 2003. *In 2007, Kerrang! named Worship and Tribute an \\"album you must own.\\" Track listing All music written by Glassjaw; all lyrics written by Daryl Palumbo. * \\"Two Tabs of Mescaline\\" ends at 6:12. After 1 minute and 30 seconds of silence, at 7:42, an untitled hidden track begins. The hidden track is kept on track 11, even on the Japanese version where the bonus track, \\"El Mark\\", follows. However, on the advance CD, \\"Two Tabs of Mescaline\\" is only 6:12, while the hidden track is placed at the end of \\"Convectuoso\\" (5:45). B-Sides There are 7 B-sides from Worship and Tribute: * \\"Convectuoso\\" ends at 5:48. The hidden track follows it, beginning at 7:15. * The song \\"Neo Tokyon\\" was recorded for the album. The band played it live before the album came out and it hadn't been heard since.
