It honors all Kern County residents who served in the armed forces, both in peacetime and in war. It is located in downtown Bakersfield, at the corner of Truxtun Ave. and S St. The memorial is adjacent to the Kern County Visitors Bureau, Bakersfield Amtrak Station, and Beale Memorial Library. It is also in between the two segments of Mill Creek. Description The memorial was designed by John Cohrs. It is a circular plaza, with two paths. The outer path is level while the inner path ascends to a second level. In the center is a fountain, with both granite and glass spiraling upward to a point. The inscription on the granite reads \\"To honor all those who served.\\" At night, lights in the fountain reflect off of the glass in rotating colors of red, white, and blue. The fountain is also used to cover the noise of the busy Truxtun Avenue, which is directly adjacent.The Memorial Site . Kern Veterans Memorial Foundation. Accessed: 04-22-2010. Along the outer path of the memorial are nine flags. They are: United States of America, State of California, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, Merchant Marines, and POW/MIA. In between the flag poles will be the wall of valor (a part of phase II). It list the names of those people who were killed or missing in action during wartime. The names are etched in glass panels, and painted in gold for visibility.Veterans Memorial Looking to Improve 1 Year After Debut. KERO. November 10, 2008. Accessed: 04-22-2010. The Kern Veterans Memorial Foundation describes the symbolic design of the memorial as: The memorial also contains a kiosk, which allows a person to search for the names of a veteran. It contains information about the veterans: years of service, awards received, and brief biographical description. This unique onsite database allows someone to visualize the people who served in our armed forces. During the planning of the memorial, the Department of Veterans Affairs listed about 350 Kern County veterans who were killed or missing in action. With the work of citizens, especially the Achieve class at Bakersfield High School, an additional 657 veterans were discovered for a total of approximately 1007. That class also researched the 1007 veterans for information used in the kiosk.Mayer, Stephan. Cataloging Our Casualties. The Bakersfield Californian. March 4, 2007. Future Phase II will involve constructing the final parts of the memorial. After about six months on display, the wall of valor was removed so new panels could be ordered with any previously omitted names added. Also, in response to a public suggestion, the names will be painted in gold so they can be easily seen in the daylight. The kiosk, currently housed in a temporary wooden structure, will be replaced with granite walls and a stainless steel roof. As of 2008, the Kern Veterans Foundation was about $300,000 short of reaching their goal. There is currently no construction date, but will most likely start when enough funds have been raised.

The story is set on the night between 22 and 23 December 1989, the time of the Romanian Revolution. It follows a Militia unit which one man abandons to take part in the revolution, and the other members have to search for him. The film uses subtle humour and was shot in a cinéma vérité style with handheld camera. The film premiered in competition at the 2006 Locarno International Film Festival. It received two Gopo Awards and was nominated for nine more. Plot The film begins with a scene of an armoured personnel carrier (APC) and a military checkpoint in the background. Two men come out of it, one in civilian clothing, the other in a Militia (Miliţia) uniform, and light up cigarettes. Suddenly, the soldiers manning the checkpoint open fire and kill all of the APC's occupants. The film then cuts to a Militia night patrol in Bucharest. Out of enthusiasm, one of the men, Costi Andronescu, abandons the mission and decides to fight for the cause of the Revolution at the Television building. His CO, Lt. Neagu and the rest of the fireteam search for him during the confusing night of 22 December 1989. Costi meets a group in a truck on their way to defend the TV station. He is in uniform and greeted as a brother and told \\"you are a civilian now\\" and he swaps items of uniform with the other men for civilian clothing. He and an unnamed Gypsy are asked to step down as they need to take an injured soldier to hospital after the truck is flagged down. Costi and the Gypsy end up in a villa with soldiers and fighters under Army command. The villa is under attack by what are presumed to be forces loyal to the Communist regime and the two men are ordered to defend it. At one point, however, they realize that the \\"enemy\\" are also Army soldiers and try to explain the situation to one of the officers at the scene, only to be branded \\"terrorists\\" and \\"Arabs\\". Costi is found to be partly in uniform, which further aggravates their situation. He receives a mild beating and the two are confined in the cellar. Later a Colonel checks out Costi's bona fides and he is allowed to go. Meanwhile, his CO Lt. Neagu (who treats Costi and his men like sons) has been driving all over the city until he calls at Costi's mother's place where they watch TV, smoke cigarettes and wait for him to turn up, fearing he is dead. Eventually he turns up, they drive back to base. The film ends with them in the same standoff seen at the beginning, sitting in their APC while regular army soldiers ask them to identify themselves at the checkpoint. The men are unsure what to reply, but decide to give their Militia password several times (\\"the paper will be blue\\"). The film ends just before the soldiers start shooting.

His graduate work with Alan Fersht resulted in the seminal application of phi-value analysis to the study of barnase, a bacterial RNAse used in many protein folding studies. Development of phi value analysis in combination with extensive protein engineering enabled an understanding of the kinetic intermediates during protein folding of barnase. In subsequent postdoctoral work at the University of Basel, he studied how mitochondria refold proteins after importing them. In 1996, he moved to Northwestern University. In 2012, he moved to The University of Texas at Austin. Matouschek currently studies the proteasome, the degradation machinery of eukaryotic cells, and the mechanisms by which the proteasome is able to unfold and translocate proteins. Scientific career =Cambridge (1988-1993)= At Cambridge, Matouschek was a graduate student under Sir Alan Fersht from 1988 to 1992. In 1989, he pioneered the use of phi value analysis in combination with protein engineering in order to study the transition state of the bacterial protein barnase. By engineering mutations in carefully chosen portions of barnase and computing the ratio between the energetic destabilization introduced by a mutation in the transition state of barnase versus that of the same mutation to barnase's native state, he was able to gain insight about the transition state of barnase and its folding pathway. After receiving his PhD in 1992, Matouschek continued his work with Fersht, serving as a research fellow at the Centre for Protein Engineering for an additional year. =University of Basel (1993-1996)= At the University of Basel, Matoschek was a postdoctorate fellow under Gottfried (Jeff) Schatz. =Northwestern University (1996-2012)= =The University of Texas at Austin (2012-present)= Matouschek was recruited to The University of Texas at Austin in 2012.

It is located on the Port Madison Indian Reservation in Washington state and was founded in 1983. The museum currently occupies a facility opened in 2012. History The Suquamish Museum opened in 1983 as the Suquamish Museum and Cultural Center, then only the second tribal museum in the state of Washington. In 2009 the Suquamish tribe launched a capital campaign to construct a new facility, enlisting Senator Patty Murray and former Washington Secretary of State Ralph Munro to help lead the effort. The new facility opened in 2012 and is triple the size of the original building. Constructed at a cost of $6 million, the purpose-built structure is set in a small botanical garden on the Port Madison Indian Reservation and consists of two galleries, a gift shop, a 50-seat auditorium, and a climate-controlled storage room used to house artifacts not on display. The facility was designed by the Seattle architectural firm Mithun and is a LEED Gold certified building. In 2013 it received a citation from the Washington Council of the American Institute of Architects. Operations =Collection= The main entrance to the Suquamish Museum, pictured in 2014 In addition to a large repository of photographs documenting tribal life from the 1860s to the present, the museum's collection includes 496 archaeological artifacts recovered from the site of the former Old Man House, a massive, long longhouse that served as the Suquamish capitol until its destruction in the late nineteenth century. Originally in the custody of the Burke Museum at the University of Washington, the artifacts, which include harpoon points, smoking pipes, and jewelry, were transferred to the Suquamish tribe in 2013. In 2014, the Port of Seattle transferred additional artifacts to the museum, including crockery and glass bottles, discovered during archaeological excavations in the 1970s at the Baba'kwob site, a pre-contact village located in what is now Seattle's Belltown neighborhood. The controversial transfer was contested by the Duwamish, an unrecognized tribe and historic Suquamish rival who claim ownership of the artifacts. Suquamish ritual paraphernalia on display at the Suquamish Museum in 2014 =Exhibitions= The museum's main gallery features a permanent exhibit titled \\"Ancient Shores – Changing Tides\\" that showcases drawings, documents, and historic photographs related to the Suquamish Tribe, contemporary and historic crafts, and interpretative panels and multimedia elements. The centerpiece of this exhibit is a 300-year-old carved canoe that was last used in the 1989 Paddle to Seattle, the first of a now annual series of canoe journeys through the Salish Sea undertaken by tribal members. A second gallery is used to house rotating exhibits from the museum's permanent collection, or items on loan from other museums, including traveling exhibits from the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES). Exhibits have included a SITES display \\"Native Words, Native Warriors\\", chronicling the history of Native Americans in the U.S. armed forces. =Management= The Suquamish Museum is governed by a five-member board of directors appointed by the Suquamish Tribal Council. The galleries and auditorium of the museum are open daily during the summer, and five days per week the rest of the year. The museum's storage vault is open to tribal members and accredited researchers weekly.

Aspects of Christian meditation was the topic of a 15 October 1989 document of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. The document is titled \\"Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on some aspects of Christian meditation\\" and is formally known by its incipit, Orationis formas.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 82 (1990) 362-379Vatican website: LETTER TO THE BISHOPS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH ON SOME ASPECTS OF CHRISTIAN MEDITATION October 15, 1989 The document issues warnings on differences, and potential incompatibilities, between Christian meditation and the styles of meditation used in eastern religions such as Buddhism.The meeting of religions and the Trinity by Gavin D'Costa 2000 page 152 The document warns of fundamental errors in combining Christian and non-Christian styles of meditation. Referring to the constitution Dei verbum the document emphasizes that all Christian prayer and meditation should \\"proceed to converge on Christ\\" and be guided by the gift of the Holy Spirit. It reaffirmed that the Church recommends the reading of the Scripture prior to and as a source of Christian prayer and meditation. Similar warnings were issued in 2003 in A Christian reflection on the New Age which characterized New Age activities as essentially incompatible with Christian teachings and values. Warnings This document of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stresses the differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches. It warns of the dangers of attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading, and may result in the loss of the essential Christocentric nature of Christian meditation.Catholicism in dialogue: conversations across traditions by Wayne Teasdale 2004 Page 74 The letter warns that \\"euphoric states\\" obtained through Eastern meditation should not be confused with prayer or assumed to be signs of the presence of God, a state that should always result in loving service to others. Without these truths, the letter said, meditation, which should be a flight from the self, can degenerate into a form of self-absorption. The letter warns against concentration on the self, rather than on Christ, and states that: > Christian prayer, ..., the communion of redeemed creatures with the intimate > life of the Persons of the Trinity, based on Baptism and the Eucharist, > source and summit of the life of the Church, implies an attitude of > conversion, a flight from \\"self\\" to the \\"You\\" of God. Thus Christian prayer > is at the same time always authentically personal and communitarian. It > flees from impersonal techniques or from concentrating on oneself, which can > create a kind of rut. The letter also warns that concentration on the physical aspects of meditation \\"can degenerate into a cult of the body\\" and that equating bodily states with mysticism \\"could also lead to psychic disturbance and, at times, to moral deviations.\\" Structure The document has seven sections: Papal references Pope John Paul II later referred to the document in addresses at a general audience in 1999 and to a particular group in 2003, using it as an example of how Christians need to focus their prayers. He referred to it also when saying, in the letter with which he marked the closing of the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000, that, by opening our heart to the love of God, prayer also opens it to the love of our brothers and sisters, and makes us capable of shaping history according to God's plan.Apostolic Letter Novo millennio ineunte Related announcements In 2003, the Vatican issued further warnings regarding New Age practices including meditation.Los Angeles Times, February 8, 2003 New Age Beliefs Aren't Christian, Vatican Finds Monsignor Michael Fitzgerald stated at the Vatican conference on A Christian Reflection on the New Age that the \\"Church avoids any concept that is close to those of the New Age\\".

They are distributed by BCP Imports and are normally worn as bracelets. Silly Bandz retail in packages with themes, such as princesses or animals, and fashion accessories. Similar shaped silicone bands are also available under other brand names from a variety of companies. Silly Bandz are an iconic piece of pop culture and were very popular in the early 2010s.  Origin and concept  Silly Bandz come in many different shapes and colors. On a wrist, they function like a regular bracelet, and when taken off they revert to their original shape. They are often worn many at a time and are traded like other collectibles. They can also be used for their original intent--as a regular rubber band. Silly Bandz come in variety packs and are very popular for children under the ages of 13 years old. Silly Bandz teach children how to collect things they are passionate about. Coming in different shapes, animals, and colors leads to an endless cycle of fun for children. The original shaped silicone rubber bands were created in 2002 by the Japanese design team Passkey Design, Yumiko Ohashi and Masonar Haneda. They made the bands in cute animal shapes to encourage sustainability by discouraging people from treating the rubber bands as disposable. Sold under the brand name Animal Rubber Bands, they won the Best Design award at the 2003 Japanese National Competition. These bands were not widely distributed in the United States, but in 2005 they were local hits in Guilford, Connecticut and at the Design Store at the New York City Museum of Modern Art. Robert Croak, owner of Toledo, Ohio-based BCP Imports (known for distributing the Livestrong wristbands), encountered the bands on a business trip and decided to re-purpose them as a toy by making them larger and thicker, and marketing them as a kids' fashion accessory.  Distribution and reception  Several different brands of Silly Bandz type shaped silicone bands The first Silly Bandz sets were sold online in November 2008. In early 2009, Learning Express in Birmingham, Alabama became the first retail store to stock Silly Bandz. By fall they were a strong seller, and became widespread across the Southern United States. Popularity began to move up the East coast of the United States, reaching New Jersey, Long Island, and Staten Island in November the same year. Silly Bandz are sold in packages with different themes, including princesses and animals. In August 2010, Silly Bandz sold their product in 8,000 stores across the U.S., and many stores in Canada carry Silly Bandz too. In September 2010 Quiznos had Silly Bandz in their kids meal. Seven spots on Amazon's April 22 list of best-selling toys and games were occupied by the bracelets. By December, Sillybandz controlled the top 25 list of toys for Amazon.com One December 2010 article said that brands like Logo Bandz, Cool Bandz, Zany Bandz and Googly Bandz, sold by Wal- Mart, were easier to find than Silly Bandz. In late 2010 and 2011 Silly Bandz released themed packs in collaboration with celebrities like Justin Bieber and Kim Kardashian. In late 2011 Zoo Games released video games based on Silly Bandz for Nintendo DS and iPhone. In spring and summer 2011 Winter's brand chocolates of Peru included Silly Bandz, marketed in South America as Animaligas, in displays and packages of Chin Chin chocolates. One parent attributed the toy's success to their being easily lost and broken, and said that, \\"If your friend has the princess kind, then you have to have the princess kind, too.\\" Seth McGowan, a toy industry analyst for Needham & Company, said it is refreshing that the \\"lowest of technologies\\" is also the one that is the most appealing, to children.

They could be modified to suit local needs; for example, dressers in the Scottish Highlands may have a \\"porridge drawer\\"--a tin lined drawer into which freshly made porridge was emptied and left to cool. When cold, slices of the porridge could be cut out and taken out of the house for later consumption. Gradually the purely utilitarian function of the dresser was supplemented with other functions, such as a means of displaying the best crockery in a farmhouse. Once it became a means of display the dresser could also be found in dining rooms where it served as sideboard and a place to store and display dinner ware. In the 19th century various different styles of ceramics would evolve to fill the plate racks of the Welsh dressers of Wales and to meet the needs of the Welsh market. Furthermore, many local traditions of what constitutes the proper care and display of the items on a Welsh dresser would come to assume an important role in the culture of North Wales in particular.

He was a teacher and his methods are the standard for the German School. One of his famous students is Erik Herbermann, author of the Dressage Formula. Von Neindorff was author of a book, The Art of Classical Horsemanship. Von Neindorff first learned the art of riding from his father, Egon von Neindorff, and later from Felix Bürkner, Richard Wätjen, Ludwig Zeiner, Otto Lörke and also Alois Podhajsky. Von Neindorff founded the first riding school to be established after World War II, initially concentrating on jousting. In 1949, he moved his school to Karlsruhe, where he remained until his death. He was awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz and the German Rider Cross in Gold.  Foundation  In 1991, Egon von Neindorff founded the \\"EGON-VON- NEINDORFF-STIFTUNG\\" (foundation), which was later joined by the State of Baden-Württemberg and the city of Karlsruhe. Its goal is the preservation of Classical Dressage up to the level of High School by training horses and talented riders along with special efforts in supporting younger riders. The foundation continues his teachings at the historical site in Karlsruhe, a former Telegraph Casern in the west of Karlsruhe, covering a closed area of approximately 10.000 square meters. Offered are horses of various training levels to the public. Riding lessons for groups (adults and children) take place on a daily basis. Othe offers include private riding lessons, vaulting lessons, and training of seat and posture in longing lessons.  Association  The Association for Classical Riding Art following Egon von Neindorff was founded in 1989. Its goal is to sustain the Classical Dressage as it is taught at the Institute and to preserve it for the future. It works towards keeping the spirit alive of the interaction between man and horse, as taught by Egon von Neindorff and lived and demonstrated by him throughout all of his life.

The energy policy of Pakistan is formulated and determined by the federal, provincial, and local institutional entities in Pakistan, which address the issues of energy production, distribution, and consumption of energy, such as gas mileage and petroleum standards. Energy policy requires the proper legislation, international treaties, subsidies and incentives to investment, guidelines for energy conservation, taxation and other public policy techniques. Several mandates and proposals have been called over the years to overlook the energy conservation, such as Neon signs were banned and the official weekend was extended from one to two days in an attempt to conserve electricity (Gillani, 2010) and reducing the electricity load used by industrial units by 25% during peak hours (Aziz, 2007), but no comprehensive long-term energy strategies were implemented. Since 1999, many legislative provisions were adopted for energy conservation including the seeking energy from various renewable energy sources. There is also an intense criticism about the unequal distribution of energy, the irresponsible usage of energy sources, and the country's new plan which is aimed to raise country's dependence on imported oil for power generation to 50% by 2030. After much public criticism, the long-term energy security policy was announced in 2013 through the introduction of equal cutting-edge energy transmission network, minimising financial losses across the energy system and aligning the ministries involved in the energy sector as well as improving the governance of energy sources. Studies and policy implementation recommended by AEDB, Water ministry (as policy enforcer), the NEPRA regulates the energy sources network as well as determining the financial prices of the usage of energy. Government-specific energy-efficiency incentive programs also play a significant role in the overall energy policy of Pakistan. As of 2013 Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has announced a determined and aggressive energy policy to meet the energy challenges and energy management. Energy authorities and institutions *Government of Pakistan **Ministry of Water and Power **Private Power & Infrastructure Board **Alternative Energy Development Board *Industrial energy sector **Electricity sector in Pakistan **Electricity in Pakistan *Energy and power regulatory authorities **Water and Power Development Authority **National Electric Power Regulatory Authority *Energy corporations **Electricity and energy corporations in Pakistan *Karachi Electric History In the 1960s, a large civilian energy input and infrastructure was built by the Pakistan military, with the financial funds provided by various countries and international monetary sources. In the 1960s, much of the energy was produced by the hydroelectric dams and thermal power stations. In the 1970s, Pakistan's energy consumption expanded to nuclear power sources with the establishment and commissioning of first nuclear power station in Karachi. In the 1980s, the dependence on nuclear sources further grew and the military continued engineering and building the nuclear power infrastructure. In 1994, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) launched the country's first ever and largest energy conservation program to produce 13,000 MW and issues 70 Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs) and Letters of Intent (LOIs) to Independent Power Producers (IPPs). This 1994 energy policy brought a decisive shift in Pakistan's diverse energy sources. In 1994, out of the total installed capacity of 11000 MW, ~60% of energy was produced from the hydroelectric power sources while nearly ~40% was produced from the thermal and nuclear sources. According to the economic statistics provided by economist, Sartaj Aziz, this mix was reversed from 60:40 to 30:70 in favour of thermal capacity based on imported fuel. Every year, this ratio went down further to 20:80 in winter months as hydropower generation was reduced due to lower water flows in the rivers. Controversially, the energy policy depended less on renewable energy sources and dependence on imported oil increased that created a permanent fault in country's energy conservation system. By 1995, only 27 IPPs were able to generate ~6,335 MW of electricity. By 1998, the ratio was stabilised by the policies enforced by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. In 2001, the military government led by President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, while contributing to the growth of domestic demand for electricity through large-scale provision of bank loans for the purchase of air-conditioners and home appliances (share of domestic energy consumption had jumped to 46% of the total by 2008), did not add any new capacity to the energy system. In 2012 Pakistan's first wind power installation came online at the FFCEL Wind Energy Project in Jhimpir. Policy overview =Energy policy: 2008–10= In 2005, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz announced the long-term energy security program which was aimed to the development of the power infrastructure from all energy sources. This policy relied on privatising the energy sector by international mega energy corporations. Controversially, this program was aimed to raise dependence on imported oil from the Arab countries for power generation to be increased by 50.1% by 2013. In 2006, Prime Minister Aziz held conversation with the officials of the Saudi Ministry of Petroleum and invited Ali Al-Naimi to invest in country's energy sector. In 2007, Prime Minister Aziz allocated ₨. 12.5 billion for power production-related projects which remained unused. In his last policy statement, Prime Minister Aziz further called for banning the Neon lights, Neon signs, and to close the market places by 9 pm; such policy enforcement was harshly resisted by the left-wing parties, such as Pakistan Peoples Party, Communist Party and the labour unions. =Energy Policy: 2010–13= After the general elections held in 2008, the mismanagement and weak policies led to an intense repetitive cycle of loadshedding in the country. Responding to a massive demonstration against the loadshedding and the growing power shortages in the country, Prime Minister, Yousaf Gilani announced the \\"energy policy\\" on 22 April 2010. The policy was announced after the Prime Minister, Gilani had held a three-day national energy conference in Islamabad with energy experts that discussed the causes of the power crisis in Pakistan and possible steps to relieve it. With immediate effect, the gaseous Neon lights and the signs were banned and the official weekend was extended from one to two days in an attempt to conserve electricity. Under this policy, several attempts were made by Gilani government to privatise the energy sector. Devised by the Finance Minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh, the programme failed to resolve electricity shortage, which private energy companies failed to maintain and upgrade despite being part of their contract. After much criticism and public demonstration in 2012, the PPP government decided to nationalised the energy sector and issued clear directives to regulate the energy corporations to produce the power generations. =Energy Policy: 2013–18= Musadik Masood Malik was appointed Federal Minister, Water and Power of the Pakistan Government in May, 2013. Within two months, he was replaced by Abid Sher Ali who served in the role until the ministry was abolished in September, 2017. In its place a Ministry of Energy was created. Awais Leghari served as the first energy minister of the country until the end of the government's tenure. The 2010 amendment to Pakistan's Constitution (para. 3), empowered each province to formulate the policy framework for the development of public and private sector power generation. This has led to the formation of dedicated provincial departments and empowered public sector companies specialized in renewables to foster and execute power projects through public, private and public–private partnership modes using indigenous power resources.Asian Development Bank, Access to Clean Energy Investment Program: Summary Sector Assessment: Energy, p.2 This tenure's energy policy was aimed at aggressively building power generation capacity through early- harvest projects in CPEC. A total of 10,973 MW of power was added by the government during its tenure, mostly via private sector investments. In terms of public sector projects conducted by provincial governments in view of the 2010 amendment, KPK government led with the addition of 1,670 MW to the national grid. It was followed by Sindh and Punjab governments which contributed 935 MW and 580 MW respectively. Balochistan government didn't inaugurate any public sector power project during its tenure. However, despite the massive addition of power to the national grid, glaring issues existed in the power sector. There was no viable overhaul done to the electricity transport infrastructure which lead to episodes of plant tripping and extended blackouts during the summer months. Furthermore, there was still a wide demand and supply gap during high temperature months which led to periodic, planned load-shedding. Finally, the issue of circular debt was still attached to the power sector and reached a record high of Rs. 922 billion in March, 2018. Conservation and consumption Due to rising demand and a failing power infrastructure severe electricity shortages have occurred in Pakistan. This has led to widespread rolling blackouts that have paralysed industry and led to protests and rioting. Power outages can last 6–8 hours a day in the cities and many more in the rural areas. According to Mahnaz Parach of Network for Consumer Protection \\"Children can't do their homework. Housework doesn't get done, as washing machines and other appliances cannot work. When you go home from work, you have no idea whether there will be electricity at home. Your whole life is disturbed.\\" Experts have warned of an impending energy crisis since 2006. Speaking at a Seminar 'Fueling the Future: Meeting Pakistan's Energy Needs in the 21st Century' held in Washington, D.C. in June 2006 then energy adviser to the prime minister of Pakistan Mukhtar Ahmed stated that the country was taking steps to address the energy shortage. Pakistan Electric Power Company estimates that there is a shortage of 6 gigawatts or about 60% of its total generation. One of the main reasons of the shortage is thought to be the failure of past governments to anticipate growth in need and the delay in implementation of projects to increase power production. In addition there is widespread power theft and lack of investment in the existing power grid. The United States has made improving Pakistan's power infrastructure one of its top priorities. US special envoy Richard Holbrooke, while describing the power situation in Pakistan as \\"unacceptable,\\" has stated that the US would go to its \\"absolute limits\\" to help Pakistan overcome the crisis. =Power sources and electrical energy = Measures are aimed at cutting consumption by 500 megawatts. The official weekend has been extended from one to two days. Neon signs and decorative lights have been banned. Power has been cut to government offices by 50% and air conditioners will only be allowed to be switched on after . Street markets have been asked to close early. Commercial centres except drug stores will be closed at and wedding celebrations will be limited to three hours. The government will pay off its debt to power producers allowing them to pay fuel suppliers. Power supply to Pakistan's commercial capital Karachi will be decreased by 300 megawatts to allow fairer distribution of power to the remaining parts of the country. Tube wells will not be allowed to operate from to . The measures will be reviewed on 30 July 2010. =Consumption by computers= Since the early 1990s, the country has observed the highest growth rate in usage of computers that effect the supply of the electricity produced in the system. In a survey published by the Express Tribune, around ~30 million citizens (out of 180 million), uses the internet on daily basis; the internet penetration in the country has reached 16% as of 2013. =Variations by regions= In the days following the announcement, traders in Lahore rejected the government's decision and kept the markets open after in defiance of the ban. Shops were kept open in other cities also after . Kashif Shabbir, president of the Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce warned the situation would get worse if authorities used force to implement the decision. There was confusion over implementation of the two-day weekend, and many banks and educational institutions remained open. Commenting on the defiant mood of the traders, an editorial in Dawn urged everybody to find middle ground. Reacting to the decision to curtail power supply to Karachi, the \\"City of Lights\\", leaders of various political parties in the Provincial Assembly of Sindh condemned the decision and some of them called it \\"a conspiracy to create a law and order situation.\\" Former Nazim of Karachi, Naimatullah Khan warned that curtailing the power supply of the city could lead to street battles between protesters and law enforcement. Some analysts have predicted that reduction in the banks' workweek to 5 days will result in revenue losses. The prevailing energy crisis in Pakistan is taking away 2 percent (or Rs 380 billion) of the economy, despite the government has spent Rs 1.1 trillion as subsidies on the sector in the last four-year which accounts for 2.5 percent of the total volume of economy.Economic cost of energy crisis estimated at Rs380bn, The News, 1 June 2012 During June 2012, President Asif Ali Zardari had said that the government realised the enormity of the challenge of energy shortage and was determined to overcome it in the shortest possible time.Disengagement not an option: President Zardari , Geo News, 1 June 2012 International co-operation Pakistan is already importing small quantity of electricity from Iran to supply power to Gwadar town. Pakistan is also actively considering to import electricity from India and Tajikistan. World Bank offered to finance for conducting the feasibility study to import 1200 MW power from India. Pakistan is also exploring to import PNG via pipe line through Wagha border from India. India would import the required LNG and re-gasified LNG (RLNG) would be pumped through its pipelines up to the border point. Iran–Pakistan gas pipeline is pending for a long time to receive PNG from Iran for the needs of both Pakistan and India.

Cape Fear Museum of History and Science is a museum located at 814 Market Street in downtown Wilmington in southeastern North Carolina. Founded in 1898, it is the oldest history museum in the state. Museum scope The Cape Fear Museum was founded in 1898 by the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy to preserve artifacts relating to the Civil War. Today, it is owned and operated by New Hanover County New Hanover, North Carolina. The Museum moved to its current location in 1970. The Museum's building is a combination of an historic structure—a 1930s Works Progress Administration armory—and a 1990s expansion. The museum has a collection of more than fifty two thousand artifacts, the vast majority of which are in storage. The Museum currently collects artifacts relating to the history, science, and cultures of the Lower Cape Fear, defined as a 50-mile radius around the city of Wilmington. In addition to New Hanover, the adjacent counties are Brunswick and Pender. The extended region encompasses portions of Columbus, Bladen, Sampson, Duplin, and Onslow counties. =Exhibits= On the first floor of the Museum, visitors can explore The Michael Jordan Discovery Gallery which examines the region's ecosystems. There are natural history displays, with a section on native plants and wildlife in the region, such as deer, beavers, foxes, a woodpeckers, and the unique Venus flytrap carnivorous plant. The weather is also discussed. There is a small exhibit on Michael Jordan, the basketball superstar from Wilmington. Visitors can also see a Simmons Sea- skiff, a locally built boat in the lobby. And, castings of the bones of a Giant Ground Sloth are on display. The lobby also includes the \\"Arrivals\\" exhibit which showcases the varied ways people experienced arriving in the Lower Cape Fear over time. The Museum's main exhibit, Cape Fear Stories starts on the first floor. The first section of the exhibition, Land of the Longleaf Pine, examines the history of the region from the first inhabitants through the American Revolution. The exhibits then explore the 19th century, including the American Civil War, and, after visitors go upstairs, they can learn about the history of the racial violence that wracked the city in 1898, about segregation, and learn some of the region's 20th century stories. The Museum also hosts traveling exhibits and temporary exhibits. Currently (August 2015) the Museum's temporary exhibits were all researched, curated, designed and fabricated by the Museum's staff. The exhibits are Reflections in Black and White, and Make it Work, an exhibit about simple machines and maritime work An in-house exhibit on Smoking is on display in the Collections Selection space.

History In 1991, Ecotrust, an American charity based in Portland, Oregon, was established with the purpose of developing a conservation-based economy in the Pacific Northwest. Founder Spencer Beebe set out to work with Indigenous people in the world's largest intact coastal temperate rainforest, located in northwestern BC. He soon realized that he needed a Canadian partner organization and, in 1994, asked one of his Canadian Ecotrust board members, Jacqueline Koerner, to take the lead on founding Ecotrust Canada. Jacqueline became Founding Chair; soon environmental journalist, Ian Gill, became the organization's first executive director. In 1995, Ecotrust Canada received charitable status, marking the beginning of its journey toward building resilient economies in rural, remote, and Indigenous communities.\\"Ecotrust Canada History\\" In 2010, Ian Gill left his position as President of Ecotrust Canada to assume the role of CEO of the newly founded Ecotrust Australia, operated as a separate yet affiliated organization.\\"Former Vancouver reporter moving to Sydney to launch Ecotrust Australia\\", The Vancouver Sun, Vancouver, 24 March 2010.

Basu was West Bengal's minister for education till May 2014 and was then assigned the tourism portfolio. He was elected as an MLA, from the Dum Dum constituency in 2011 Assembly Election of West Bengal. Early life Bratya Basu was born in Calcutta to professor Dr. Bishnu Basu and educational administrator Dr. Neetika Basu. His early name was Bratyabrata Basu Roy Chowdhury. He came from the \\"Basu Roy Chowdhury\\" family at Ulpur (now In Faridpur, Bangladesh). He studied Bangla at Presidency College and Calcutta University. Career Bratya Basu started his career as a sound operator for the theatre group Ganakrishti and soon started writing and directing plays with the group. The themes of his writings focus on political fantasy, nature-human relationships, connection between music and life, ethical values and its lack, conflict between love and revolt, bonding between time and culture. Bratya Basu joined City College, Kolkata as an assistant professor in the department of Bengali. But his passion for theatre could not confine him to the teacher's room of a college. He launched his career as a dramatist with the play Ashaleen (1996) (or Ora Panchjon), described by theatre critics as the first postmodernist Bengali play. His noted plays thereafter include Aranyadeb, Shahar Yaar, Virus-M, Winkle-Twinkle, etc. These plays are not only popular but also unique in different genres of modern literary theatre and subject to manifold interpretations. His other important plays include Ruddhasangeet, Chatushkon, Hemlat - the Prince of Garanhata, Krishna Gahobar, Sateroi July, Bikele Bhorer Sorshey Phool, Supari Killer, Boma etc. A compilation of his plays has been published in three volumes in 2004, 2010 and in 2016 respectively. He has even directed three films - Raasta which has a theme of youth moving into terrorism, Teesta a film on society and the failure of romance, Tara and acted in many films which include Kaalbela, Icchey, Sthaniyo Sambad, Hemlock Society, Muktodhara etc. Basu has bagged many awards and recognition.

He has also been awarded Gajendra Kumar Mitra-Sumathanath Ghosh Memorial Award 2018, conferred by Mitra & Ghosh Publishers Pvt. Ltd. for his contribution in Bengali Literature. Hemlat, The Prince of Garanhata has won the critical acclaims from academic researchers for the adaptation. Sam Kolodezh of the University of California, Irvine, Drama and theatre heaped praise on Bratya's adaptation. Formerly Associate Professor, Kuwait University and a Life-member of Shakespeare Society of Eastern India, Antony Johae is so moved by the contemporary Indianization of Shakespear's mastertext that he lectured across India on Hemlat. Mr. Johae has contributed a research paper on Hemlat in the Vol-V, No.VIII of The International Journal of Cultural Studies and Social Sciences, edited by Dr Prof Amitava Roy., formerly Shakespeare Professor of Rabindra Bharati University and president and co founder of Shakespeare Society of Eastern India and Prof Ronan Paterson., an actor, director and a producer for theatre, film in Britain and Ireland and an extensive writer on Shakespeare. Bratya Basu has created his own space in contemporary theatre by moving beyond its existing boundaries. He has formed the theatre group Kalindi Bratyajon in 2008. The first theatrical production of Bratyajon was Ruddhasangeet (2009), a play on the Rabindrasangeet exponent Debabrata Biswas's journey of bitter struggle throughout his life in the prevailing system. The play received instant critical and popular acclaim and has so far staged more than a record 150 shows to packed houses. After producing \\"Boma\\" in 2015, a period piece that rips off the masks of the Bengali freedom fighters which reveals jealousies, greed for power and internal conflicts Basu has interestingly produced another untold history of Bengal spanning 1757 and 1764. The play, \\"Mir Jafar\\" showcases the power politics and game of minds to unravel the complexities in which 'Mir Jafar' continues to retain the emblematic representation and throne of the 'Universal betrayer' in all societies in all times. =List of plays written and directed by Bratya Basu= * Ashalin (Indecent) Produced by Ganakrishti * Aranyadeb (The Phantom) Produced by Ganakrishti * Shahar Yaar (Friend in the ) Produced by Ganakrishti * Chotuskon (The Quadrangle) Produced by Ganakrishti * Virus- M Produced by Ganakrishti * Page 4: It's also a game Produced by Lokokrishti * Hemlat- The Prince of Garanhata (Adaptation from ‘Hamlet’ by William Shakespeare) Produced by Ballygunj Swapnasuchona * Krishnagawabhar (The Blackhole) Produced by Niva Arts * Sateroi July (17 July) (Original play: 'They Shall Not Die' by John Wexley, Manusher Adhikare by Utpal Dutta) Produced by Ganakrishti * Ruddhasangeet (Song of the Outcast)(Play on Rabindrasangeet exponent Debabrata Biswas) Produced by Bratyajon * Canvasser (Adaptation from a short story of Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, Written by Sekhar Samaddar) Produced by Kalindi Bratyajon * Byomkesh (Adaptation from a short story of Late Saradindu Bandyopadhyay, Written by Ujjal Chattopadhyay) Produced by Kalindi Bratyajon * Cinemar Moto (Like a Movie) Produced by Kalindi Bratyajon * Ke?

The surface of the ellipsoid represents the locus of the endpoints of all stress vectors acting on all planes passing through a given point in the continuum body. In other words, the endpoints of all stress vectors at a given point in the continuum body lie on the stress ellipsoid surface, i.e., the radius-vector from the center of the ellipsoid, located at the material point in consideration, to a point on the surface of the ellipsoid is equal to the stress vector on some plane passing through the point. In two dimensions, the surface is represented by an ellipse. Once the equations of the ellipsoid is known, the magnitude of the stress vector can then be obtained for any plane passing through that point. To determine the equation of the stress ellipsoid we consider the coordinate axes x_1, x_2, x_3\\\\,\\\\\\\\! taken in the directions of the principal axes, i.e., in a principal stress space. Thus, the coordinates of the stress vector \\\\mathbf T^{(\\\\mathbf n)}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! on a plane with normal unit vector \\\\mathbf n\\\\,\\\\\\\\! passing through a given point P\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is represented by :T_1^{(\\\\mathbf n)}=\\\\sigma_1n_1, \\\\qquad T_2^{(\\\\mathbf n)}=\\\\sigma_2n_2, \\\\qquad T_3^{(\\\\mathbf n)}=\\\\sigma_3n_3\\\\,\\\\\\\\! And knowing that \\\\mathbf n\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is a unit vector we have :n_1^2+n_2^2+n_3^2=\\\\frac{T_1}{{\\\\sigma_1}^2}^2+\\\\frac{T_2}{{\\\\sigma_2}^2}^2+\\\\frac{T_3}{{\\\\sigma_3}^2}^2=1\\\\,\\\\\\\\! which is the equation of an ellipsoid centered at the origin of the coordinate system, with the lengths of the semiaxes of the ellipsoid equal to the magnitudes of the principal stresses, i.e. the intercepts of the ellipsoid with the principal axes are \\\\pm\\\\sigma_1, \\\\pm\\\\sigma_2, \\\\pm\\\\sigma_3\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. * The first stress invariant I_1\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is directly proportional to the sum of the principal radii of the ellipsoid. * The second stress invariant I_2\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is directly proportional to the sum of the three principal areas of the ellipsoid. The three principal areas are the ellipses on each principal plane. * The third stress invariant I_3\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is directly proportional to the volume of the ellipsoid. * If two of the three principal stresses are numerically equal the stress ellipsoid becomes an ellipsoid of revolution.Timoshenko Thus, two principal areas are ellipses and the third is a circle. * If all of the principal stresses are equal and of the same sign, the stress ellipsoid becomes a sphere and any three perpendicular directions can be taken as principal axes. The stress ellipsoid by itself, however, does not indicate the plane on which the given traction vector acts. Only for the case where the stress vector lies along one of the principal directions it is possible to know the direction of the plane, as the principal stresses act perpendicular to their planes. To find the orientation of any other plane we used the stress-director surface or stress director quadricTimoshenko represented by the equation :\\\\frac{x_1^2}+\\\\frac{x_2^2}+\\\\frac{x_3^2}=1\\\\,\\\\\\\\! The stress represented by a radius-vector of the stress ellipsoid acts on a plane oriented parallel to the tangent plane to the stress-director surface at the point of its intersection with the radius-vector.

The school is part of the Durant Community School District, and has an enrollment of approximately 300 students in grades nine through 12. Located at 408 Seventh Street in Durant (approximately two miles south of Interstate 80), Durant High School draws students from areas of southeastern Cedar County, northeastern Muscatine County and western Scott County, plus the community of Stockton. History The current Durant High School was completed in 1957, the same year the school fielded its first competitive football team. There have been many additions and renovations to the buildings in the years since. Durant High School is a participant in a whole-grade sharing agreement with the nearby Bennett Community School District. Each district is responsible for its own elementary school, while Bennett sends its junior high and high school students to Durant. This agreement has been in place since the 2005-2006 school year. Athletics Durant (teams were Durant-Bennett from 2005 to 2008) sports teams are known as the Wildcats; their uniforms display the school's colors of blue and gold. As of 2020, Durant is classified as a 2A school (Iowa's second-smallest tier schools) in some sports, and 1A (smallest tier schools) in others, according to the Iowa High School Athletic Association and Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union. The school is a member of the 13-team River Valley Conference (RVC), which comprises similar-sized schools from communities in eastern Iowa. Prior to joining the RVC and its predecessor, the Cedar Valley Conference, in 2008, Durant was a member of the Eastern Iowa Hawkeye Conference (EIHC), a league that dated to the 1950s. The school fields athletic teams in 13 sports, including: * Summer: Baseball and softball. ** Softball - 2013 Class 2A State Champions * Fall: Football, volleyball, and boys' and girls' cross country. ** Boys' Cross Country - 2001 Class 1A State Champions2020 Cross Country State Book ** Girls' Cross Country - 4-time State Champions (1996, 1997, 2000, 2002) * Winter: Boys' and girls' basketball and wrestling. * Spring: Boys' and girls' track and field; and boys' and girls' golf. ** Boys' Golf - 1985 Class 2A State Champions2019-20-Golf Stat Book Durant enjoys its biggest rivalries with neighboring school Wilton. =Successes= Throughout the school's history, Durant has enjoyed great success in many of its sports, earning many EIHC and CVC conference titles and producing all-state athletes that have enjoyed success at the collegiate level and in their careers. In recent years, volleyball has been the most successful sport for Durant-Bennett, with the Wildcats winning 35 consecutive games to date in the EIHC and CVC. The 2007 team posted a perfect 35-0 regular season record prior to the state tournament. While the Wildcats have traditionally struggled in football, the 2006 team posted a 6-3 regular season record and qualified for the state playoffs for the first time in school history. In recent years the school's softball program has become a powerhouse in softball, winning multiple CVC titles. In 2012, the Wildcats placed third at the state softball tournament, and topped it in 2013 by winning the state championship. The Wildcat cross country program has also experienced some successes since the new millennium. The boys program captured a state title in class 1A in 2001 Controversy In the fall of 2009, Durant High School principal Monica Rouse was placed on administrative leave, beginning several years of turmoil in the Durant community. Durant school officials cited a failure on Rouse's part to maintain accurate student records, a lack of professional judgement and inability to be a positive leader or role model, and the school board agreed to consider firing Rouse.Beaudette, Cynthia, \\"Durant School Board upholds firing of Rouse,\\" Muscatine Journal, March 30, 2010.

Accessed 04-22-2010 On March 30, the school board agreed to terminate high school principal Monica Rouse's contract; Iowa law allows entities such as school boards to reject administrative law judges' rulings, since they are non-binding. Rouse appealed the Board's decision in Cedar County District court. On March 11, 2011, Judge Nancy Tabor sided with Rouse and ordered the district to reinstate her as principal, saying, \\"Ms. Rouse was a competent and devoted principal\\". The courts re-affirmed this ruling on May 11, 2011. The Board appealed this decision to the Iowa Appellate Courts. On January 19, 2012, The Iowa Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's ruling that Rouse should get her job back. The Durant School Board appealed this to the Iowa Supreme Court. On April 11, 2012, the Iowa Supreme Court voted not to hear the appeal, affirming the lower courts decisions. The board allowed Rouse to return to active employment, but in a reduced capacity. The board placed restrictions on Rouse's access to the building, educational records, and communication with students and staff. Rouse file an action against the board claiming a hostile work environment. That action, a contempt of court order, and other suits against the board were settled in December 2012 with the school board agreeing to pay Rouse approximately $850,000 in addition to her salary and benefits from the 2009 through 2012 school years, bringing her total compensation to about $1.25 million.

A powerful magnate in south-western England, he was the first post-Conquest earl of Cornwall. Brian was born in about 1042, a son of Odo, Count of Penthièvre. Brian joined in the Norman Conquest of England, along with his brothers Alan the Black (Alain le Noir), and Alan the Red. Godwine and Edmund, sons of Harold Godwinson, escaped after the Battle of Hastings to Leinster, where they were guests of Diarmait. In 1068 and 1069 Diarmait lent them the fleet of Dublin for attempted invasions of England. At midsummer (perhaps 26th June) in 1069 Brian and Alan led a force that defeated a raid by a fleet of 64 ships on the mouth of the River Taw in Devon. Later in the same year Brian and William fitz Osbern were sent to relieve sieges at Shrewsbury and Exeter by English forces rebelling against Norman lordship. They were too late to save the former but a sally by the defenders of Exeter drove the English into the path of Brian and William who \\"punished their audacity with great slaughter\\". After defeating Harold's sons, Brian's forces went north to counter the rebellion by Eadric the Wild, while William the Conqueror's army travelled west; the two armies joined and won the Battle of Stafford. Brian received grants of land in Suffolk and Cornwall, although the first mention of him as Earl of Cornwall was not made until 1140, by his nephew Alan, 1st Earl of Richmond who had been given the same title by King Stephen and may have been trying to improve the legitimacy of his new rank.; p. 126 Brian's name is often associated with the construction of Launceston Castle. Brian may have left England soon after the battles of 1069, or perhaps following the rebellion of Ralph de Gaël in 1075. In any case, his estates became part of the grants made by King William to Robert of Mortain. Brian may have lived the rest of his life as a semi-invalid in and near Brittany, staying with his wife.Keats-Rohan, K. S. B. (2002) Domesday Descendants (2002), p. 221 E. A.

Douma is a administratively part of Batroun District and is known for its location in a valley surrounded by mountains. It stands at an altitude of 1150 m. Almost all of its houses are covered in red tiles. It has a temperate climate and an abundance of vineyards and olive and apple groves. History Douma witnessed different civilizations including ancient Greece, ancient Rome and Turkey. However, the Ottoman Empire left the largest impact on Douma's inhabitants. In the town square sits a sarcophagus, bearing a Greek inscription recording that this was the burial place of Castor, who died in 317 AD. The village had been abandoned until the 16th century, during Ottoman rule, when the modern village was founded by the Greek Orthodox Christian clan of Maalouf, who migrated to the Byblos and Keserwan areas from the Hauran. The family continues to inhabit the village until the present day. In 1880 the Ottoman mutasarrif of Mount Lebanon, Rustum Pasha, appointed a municipal council to administer Douma, the sixth locality to receive a council in Mount Lebanon. A road in Douma, 2009 The Great Famine of Mount Lebanon during World War I precipitated a wave of emigrants from Douma to the Americas and their remittances significantly contributed to boosting the village's economy. Most infrastructure and houses in Douma were built between 1881 and 1914, largely financed by emigrants from the village in Brazil, Argentina and the United States. In the 1920s, the leaders of Syria who had just rebelled against the French, were detained and exiled to Douma of Lebanon.

The airfield was formerly named Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Crows Landing or NALF Crows Landing when operated by the U.S. Navy. As of January 2011 Airport-data.com reports this airport status as closed permanently. It began in late 1942 as an auxiliary air station to Naval Air Station, Alameda, and was used to train Navy fighter pilots. Pilots of F4F Wildcats, TBF and TBM Avengers trained here first in Link and Panoramic trainers, then eventually in actual planes. Later, pilots in R4D Skytrains and R5D Skymasters (Navy versions of the Army's C-47 and C-54) trained here. After the war the station was placed in caretaker status. By the year 2000, the Navy had completed an EPA cleanup project and transferred most of the facilities to Stanislaus County with plans to convert it into a business park. As of 2013, the County (with NASA partners) had cleared all of the abandoned and decaying building structures save for the historic control tower. In addition, Stanislaus County is currently seeking a CEQA consultant to assist with environmental impact analysis. During 1956 and 1957 this base trained pilots from Moffett to land on carriers. They also trained pilots in the use of TACAN for navigation.  Facilities  The airport has two runways with concrete surfaces: 12/30 is , and 17/35 is . History In late 1942, the Navy chose a site in the San Joaquin Valley, 71 miles southeast of NAS Alameda, for an auxiliary air station. An 804-acre parcel of land was purchased for $86,708, and ground was broken on December 1, 1942. The site was located near the agricultural community of Crows Landing, with a 1940 population of 363, which consisted of a gas station, country store, and a freight train stop. During construction, the project was known as NAAF Patterson for the nearest post office, six miles to the north. After the Navy decided to include a post office on the station, the base was commissioned on May 25, 1943, as NAAF Crows Landing. On 18 June 1943, VC-36 became the first unit assigned. A detachment of Alameda's CASU 6 also arrived in support. For the next nine months, Crows Landing hosted various carrier units. These units included VC-65, and elements of CAG 28, CAG 18, and CAG 11. In the meantime, a detachment of CASU 37 replaced CASU 6 and Crows Landing was upgraded to an NAAS. Up to the spring of 1944, multi-engine patrol aircraft were based at NAAS Vernalis, 18 miles to the northwest. The Navy realized that Crows Landing's 7,000-ft. concrete runways would be better suited for the heavier weight multi-engine aircraft than Vernalis's asphalt runways; thereafter, Vernalis was designated for carrier units and Crows Landing for multi-engine types. In March 1944, the first multi-engine squadron, VPB-137, arrived from Alameda with PVs. From June to November, the station embarked on an expansion project that added housing, a hangar, and other improvements. The runways were widened from 150 to 200 ft. The station's ramp that initially was 200 x 400 ft. was enlarged by a 1200 x 200-ft. and a 1890 x 260-ft. section. In August 1944, the first PB4Y-2 Privateer squadron, VPB-118, arrived from Camp Kearny. In January 1945, Crows Landing added six enlisted barracks, a warehouse, and a 100-man ground training building. From February 2, to March 27, 1945, a VRE-1 Detachment with 12 R4Ds was based at the station. VRE-1 was one of the Navy's three evacuation squadrons that transported wounded men from combat areas in the South Pacific to the various naval hospitals in the U.S. In addition, Oakland's VR-4 and VR-11 used Crows Landing for training throughout the station's existence. Control tower of Crows Landing in 2011 Crows Landing's isolated location prompted the Navy to run ten liberty buses a day to Modesto and Patterson. Navy men were allowed to use the swimming pool at Patterson High School. In June 1945, the station's complement stood at 27 officers and 185 men - squadron personnel added an additional 245 officers and 1220 enlisted men. Available billeting accommodated 268 officers and 2116 men. Patrol squadrons that passed thought the station during the war included VPB-115, 122, 101, 103, 107, 133, 140, 118, and 108. The PV operational training squadron, VPB-198, also spent time aboard. Patrol squadrons were supported by PATSUs 8-2, 8-4, 8-5, and 8-7. Other units that operated and trained at Crows Landing were VJ-12 and ABATU 105. By war's end, the station was valued at $4 million. Crows Landing was decommissioned on 6 July 1946, becoming an OLF (Outlying Field) to Alameda and later Moffett Field. In recent years, the Navy maintained a permanent detachment at the field that supplied crash equipment and refueling services for naval aircraft from the stations in the area. With the closing of Moffett, the Navy turned Crows Landing over to NASA's Ames Research Center in 1993.

Cat massage may be used to calm an anxious animal. Cat massages may also lower the blood pressure of the owner, acting as a relaxation technique for both parties. Cat massage is useful in breeding familiarity and intimacy between the owner and a feline. Massaging the cat may also allow the owner to look for abnormalities that might appear on the cat's skin and in finding areas of tenderness or swelling that could be the signs of a serious condition. Massage can increase the mobility and flexibility in cats who suffer from arthritis. It may also be an alternative way to hasten the rehabilitation of a cat that has undergone surgery. Massage therapy may have a positive impact on the cats' digestive system and their coat and skin. Drawbacks Although massage therapy is highly recommended for cats, cat owners are recommended to avoid massaging cats that are feverish or those who have cancer. Massage should not be performed over open wounds, around unstable fractures, or when a cat is experiencing pain that is not yet appropriately controlled. Massage should be applied with caution in cats with blood-clotting problems. Do not massage directly over tumors. Techniques Stroke the cat, checking for skin abnormalities or parasites of any kind. Owners should consider the likes and dislikes of their cat during the entire massage. Cats should not be forced into having massages. A common place to start is behind the ears, as cats may be more receptive to receiving affection in this area. Areas where the cat has shown an antipathy toward being petted should be avoided. For example, if the cat does not like to have its stomach petted the owner should not attempt to massage this area. Pet owners are advised to apply gentle massages to their cats, and if they wish to give their pet a deeper massage they should have a professional demonstrate proper technique for the owner to learn and apply at home. Effleurage and friction are both good techniques in massaging cats. After the cat has shown it is relaxed, the owners may start to pet it from the head to the tail, by using their open and relaxed hand. This is the effleurage technique. While practicing this movement, owners can look for abnormalities such as lumps or bumps. The effleurage stroke is helpful in stimulating blood circulation and warming up the tissue. Circular friction may be performed down the cat's body by using one's fingertip to draw small circles on its skin, including the tail.

Launching on August 9, 2010, it was owned by the Arlington-based Allbritton Communications as a locally focused companion to its other media properties in Washington, including Politico and WJLA-TV. The site combined original reporting with that of independent blogs and contributions from WJLA's reporters and staff. Despite having growing readership, TBD suffered from poor profitability, which led to a series of staff cuts and a shift in focus after only 6 months in operation. TBD.com was shut down entirely in August 2012. History Plans for the site were first announced in October 2009. The site was intended to serve as the broadcaster's main news site for Washington D.C. area news, replacing the existing websites for WJLA-TV and its sister cable channel NewsChannel 8. The official name of the new site, TBD.com, was unveiled on April 22, 2010. Site editor Erik Wemple had already used the name TBD in staff e-mails prior to the announcement, in this case alluding to the phrase \\"To be determined\\", but felt that the name would also fit the site's goal. TBD.com would use a non-traditional approach to local news inspired by its sister website Politico; Jim Brady stated that its format would \\"combine what makes the Web interesting and what makes TV such an effective medium.\\" The site started with around 50 staff members, including about 20 reporters and seven members of a community engagement team, and would highlight major, area-wide news and micro, neighborhood-level information. It would feature real-time reporting on stories, featuring content curated from independent blogs, along with original reporting from the site's staff and contributions from WJLA-TV and NewsChannel 8 reporters. TBD.com officially launched on August 9, 2010, and replaced the websites for both WJLA-TV and NewsChannel 8. On the same day, NewsChannel 8 also re-launched itself as a television extension of the new site, known as TBD TV. TBD.com grew quickly, amassing 1.5 million unique viewers by January 2011. Major changes to the site's management were made as early as February 2011; WJLA's station manager Bill Lord took over control of TBD.com, and Saul Carlin was brought in to serve the new position of digital news director. Additionally, WJLA severed its ties to the website by bringing back its own website at WJLA.com, and TBD TV returned to its previous NewsChannel 8 branding. Erik Wemple stated that the changes were made to \\"more align the properties and to get more uniformity of management and direction,\\" and to allow WJLA to return to having its own distinct online identity catered more to its television audience. No jobs were lost as part of the changes. While TBD.com's readership steadily increased after its launch, the site struggled to sell advertising; ad sales were handled by WJLA's sales staff, who were inexperienced in selling advertising on digital platforms. As a result, Allbritton announced on February 23, 2011 that it would be making major changes to TBD.com and eliminating all but 8 positions at the site. Existing TBD.com employees were required to re-apply for the 8 remaining positions at the site, while most of its former staff were reassigned to work on WJLA.com instead. Additionally, TBD would also change its scope to only cover arts and entertainment. TBD.com would eventually be discontinued in August 2012, with the TBD.com domain name redirecting to the website of WJLA- TV. In 2014, Sinclair Broadcast Group would acquire Allbritton's stations, including WJLA and News Channel 8; also part of the deal was the TBD.com domain, which Sinclair would apply in 2017 to the website of its digital broadcast network, TBD. Staff Jim Brady, a former executive editor of The Washington Post's website, ran the site with editor Erik Wemple, former editor of the Washington City Paper. Steve Buttry, named Editor & Publisher's 2010 Editor of the Year for his leadership in transforming a newsroom to adapt new technology and engage the community in deeper ways, was the site's director of community engagement. He led a team of community hosts and social media and mobile producers. Steve Chaggaris, formerly political director of CBS News, was the site's director of TV projects.

The variable t is an angle measure. Animation of the act of unrolling the circumference of a unit circle, a circle with radius of 1. Since , the circumference of a unit circle is . In mathematics, a unit circle is a circle of unit radius—that is, a radius of 1. Frequently, especially in trigonometry, the unit circle is the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin (0, 0) in the Cartesian coordinate system in the Euclidean plane. In topology, it is often denoted as because it is a one-dimensional unit -sphere. If is a point on the unit circle's circumference, then and are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle whose hypotenuse has length 1. Thus, by the Pythagorean theorem, and satisfy the equation :x^2 + y^2 = 1. Since for all , and since the reflection of any point on the unit circle about the - or -axis is also on the unit circle, the above equation holds for all points on the unit circle, not only those in the first quadrant. The interior of the unit circle is called the open unit disk, while the interior of the unit circle combined with the unit circle itself is called the closed unit disk. One may also use other notions of \\"distance\\" to define other \\"unit circles\\", such as the Riemannian circle; see the article on mathematical norms for additional examples. In the complex plane The unit circle can be considered as the unit complex numbers, i.e., the set of complex numbers of the form : z = e^{it} = \\\\cos t + i \\\\sin t = \\\\operatorname{cis}(t) for all (see also: cis). This relation represents Euler's formula. In quantum mechanics, this is referred to as phase factor. Animation of the unit circle with angles Trigonometric functions on the unit circle All of the trigonometric functions of the angle (theta) can be constructed geometrically in terms of a unit circle centered at O. Sine function on unit circle (top) and its graph (bottom) The trigonometric functions cosine and sine of angle may be defined on the unit circle as follows: If is a point on the unit circle, and if the ray from the origin (0, 0) to makes an angle from the positive -axis, (where counterclockwise turning is positive), then :\\\\cos \\\\theta = x \\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad \\\\sin \\\\theta = y. The equation gives the relation : \\\\cos^2\\\\theta + \\\\sin^2\\\\theta = 1. The unit circle also demonstrates that sine and cosine are periodic functions, with the identities :\\\\cos \\\\theta = \\\\cos(2\\\\pi k+\\\\theta) :\\\\sin \\\\theta = \\\\sin(2\\\\pi k+\\\\theta) for any integer . Triangles constructed on the unit circle can also be used to illustrate the periodicity of the trigonometric functions. First, construct a radius OA from the origin to a point on the unit circle such that an angle with is formed with the positive arm of the -axis. Now consider a point and line segments . The result is a right triangle with . Because has length , length , and length 1, and . Having established these equivalences, take another radius OR from the origin to a point on the circle such that the same angle is formed with the negative arm of the -axis. Now consider a point and line segments . The result is a right triangle with . It can hence be seen that, because , is at in the same way that P is at . The conclusion is that, since is the same as and is the same as , it is true that and . It may be inferred in a similar manner that , since and . A simple demonstration of the above can be seen in the equality . When working with right triangles, sine, cosine, and other trigonometric functions only make sense for angle measures more than zero and less than . However, when defined with the unit circle, these functions produce meaningful values for any real-valued angle measure – even those greater than 2. In fact, all six standard trigonometric functions – sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant, as well as archaic functions like versine and exsecant – can be defined geometrically in terms of a unit circle, as shown at right. Using the unit circle, the values of any trigonometric function for many angles other than those labeled can be calculated without the use of a calculator by using the angle sum and difference formulas. coordinates of certain points Circle group Complex numbers can be identified with points in the Euclidean plane, namely the number is identified with the point . Under this identification, the unit circle is a group under multiplication, called the circle group; it is usually denoted . On the plane, multiplication by gives a counterclockwise rotation by . This group has important applications in mathematics and science. Complex dynamics Unit circle in complex dynamics Julia set of discrete nonlinear dynamical system with evolution function: :f_0(x) = x^2 is a unit circle.

Arzika contested for and lost the National Chairmanship of the Social Democratic Party to Ambassador Babgana Kingibe in June 1990. He was included in the Elders Committee of the SDP until it was scrapped by General Sani Abacha in November 1993. After the failure of the Nigerian Third Republic with the assumption of power by General Sani Abacha, he became a member of the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) formed in May 1994. Along with Balarabe Musa and few others in the North, they championed the cause of the return to power of the presumed winner of the 12 June 1993 elections Chief MKO Abiola until Abiola died in 1998. In 1998, Arzika joined with a group of prominent politicians headed by Chief Solomon Lar known as G18 from Northern Nigeria to ask General Sani Abacha to resign from office and return Nigeria to civil rule. The group later expanded to include other prominent politicians from Southern Nigeria (G34) headed by former Vice President Alex Ekwueme and continued with the agitation. With the sudden death of Abacha and Abiola, the new Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar announced that the Military will handover power to civilians in May 1999 and political activities resumed. The G34 then expanded to become a pan Nigeria group which became the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Arzika chose to remain in Sokoto to organize the party and was its first State Chairman. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) won Presidential elections in 1999 and its candidate- Arzika's former boss General Olusegun Obasanjo returned to power. Minister of Communications In June 1999 Arzika was appointed Minister of Communications in Obasanjo's first cabinet. He published a formal telecommunications policy in May 2000. Prior to the official policy release, Arzika said the changes would help Nigeria add two million fixed and 1.2 million mobile lines over the next two years. At the time, Nigeria had about 500,000 connected fixed and mobile phone lines for a population of over 108 million. The policy essentially remained in force for the next ten years. The telecommunications environment at the time was dominated by the state-owned Nigerian Telecommunications (NITEL). Although Private Telecoms Operators (PTO) were allowed to provide service, typically using wireless links, the PTOs complained that NITEL denied them access to the network, or failed to provide sufficient access lines, and charged excessively for connections. Speaking in June 2000, the NITEL Managing Director Emmanuel Ojeba said that NITEL would address these problems, and planned to expand network capacity by about one million lines per year. Arzika promised to provide telephone service in all the local government areas. At the opening session of the second Africa Internet Summit in September 2000, Arzika said the Nigerian government had identified access to telecommunications as a critical factor in the development of all aspects of the nation's economy. Arzika pushed to liberalize the telecommunications sector. In early 2001 the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) auctioned licenses for GSM mobile carriers. NITEL obtained a licence, and well as Econet and MTN. Arzika also made a strong case for expanding NITEL to transform it into a \\"viable, reliable and technologically sound company to enable it to meet the demands of government's deregulation and privatisation policies\\". In December 2000, Arzika said that plans to privatize NITEL had received a favorable reaction both within and outside the country. In January 2001 President Obasanjo approved a merger of NITEL and the state-owned mobile carrier M-Tel, and confirmed the appointment of Emmanuel Ojeba as the Chief executive. Until then Ojeba had been in an acting capacity for almost a year. In March 2001, Arzika visited the People's Republic of China accompanied by Ojeba and met with his counterpart Mr Wu Jichuan, where they discussed approaches both countries were taking to ensure rapid telecoms growth. In April 2001 Arzika ordered the removal of Ojeba from his position as managing director of NITEL ahead of his scheduled retirement in June 2001 as part of the \\"process of reinvigorating the much-criticised national carrier\\". Speaking in May 2001 in response to allegations that NITEL had executed inflated contracts, a NITEL spokesman said Arzika \\"is the only minister ... that has not bothered to influence any decision in the company, so how then could anyone allege that he was in the know how?\\" In June 2001 Arzika resigned from the cabinet. He was replaced by Mohammed Bello.  Later life  After his resignation from the Federal Cabinet, Arzika retired from politics and returned to his farming and commodities business in Sokoto. He remained an active member of the local community in Sokoto and Tambuwal. He was an active member in the Sokoto State Educational Development Foundation, Sokoto State University Governing Council and Tambuwal Educational Development Council. Arzika was instrumental to the establishment of Federal Government Girls College Tambuwal and Community School Tambuwal. Arzika was an avid squash player, Chairman of the Sokoto State Squash Racket Association and cyclist until an injury forced his retirement from the game in 1999. Despite a spinal injury which affected a part of his leg, he was a committed swimmer. He read very widely and travelled all over the world. He maintained an active life until he developed heart problems in 2015 and died shortly afterward. Arzika was married to Fatima (Inno) daughter of former President Shagari with whom he had six children; she died in 2007. He married Hadiza (Yar Mafara) and they had seven children; she died in the ADC plane crash of 2006. He was later married to Sadiya and Amina. He was survived by 12 children (one died in the ADC plane crash) and several grand hildren. In 1979 he received the Officer of the Order of the Federal Republic (OFR) national award.

Educational capital can be utilized to produce or reproduce inequality, and it can also serve as a leveling mechanism that fosters social justice and equal opportunity. Educational capital has been the focus of study in Economic anthropology, which provides a framework for understanding educational capital in its endeavor to understand human economic behavior using the tools of both economics and anthropology.  Cultural capital and educational capital  The term educational capital is a concept that expands upon the theoretical ideas of French sociologist and anthropologist Pierre Bourdieu who applied the notion of capital to social capital, cultural capital, and symbolic capital.Bourdieu 1986 Pierre Bourdieu and Basil Bernstein explore how the cultural capital of the dominant classes has been viewed throughout history as the \\"most legitimate knowledge.\\"Bourdieu and Bernstein 1977 How schools choose the content and organization of curriculum and instructional practices connects school knowledge (both commodified and lived) to dynamics of class, gender, and race both outside and inside our institutions of education.Apple 1989 Although Bourdieu went into great detail in his discourse on social, cultural and symbolic capital, he does not appear to consider the importance of educational capital as critical in and of itself. Bourdieu does however, mention academic capital in Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste: Arjun Appadurai's exploration of knowledge and commodities and issues of exclusivity and authenticity is also relevant to the discussion of cultural capital and educational capital. In The Social Life of Things: Commodities in Cultural Perspective, Appadurai suggests “...commodities represent very complex social forms and distributions of knowledge.”(41)Appadurai 1986  Economic theories and models of educational capital practices  = Ritual economy in education = In her article \\"Gifting the Children: Ritual Economy of a Community School,\\"Halperin 2008 Rhoda Halperin explores the practices of an urban community school through a ritual economy perspective. McAnany and Wells define ritual economy as \\"the process of provisioning and consuming that materializes and substantiates worldview for managing meaning and shaping interpretation.\\"McAnany and Wells 2008 McAnany and Wells note that ritual and economy are linked but are not reducible to one another and suggest three critical areas of inquiry: 1) economic practice, i.e., provisioning and consuming; 2) resultant elements of practice, i.e., materialization and substantiation; and 3) the important social role of ritual practice in shading meaning and contouring the interpretation of life experiences.McAnany and Wells 2008 Halperin calls the intersection of ritual economy and ritual kinship in the community school \\"gifting the children.\\"Halperin 2008 The primary entity that is produced, acquired, and consumed is the public community charter school (a nonprofit corporation) that consists of a building and a collection of educational practices and programs. Gifting the children entails a \\"complex set of morally driven (and ritualized) informal, intergenerational economic practices: modeling survival strategies by combining work in the formal wage economy with informal work on odd jobs...providing actual resources such as food, sometimes housing, clothing and school supplies.\\"(251) = Ritual kinship and practical kinship in education = Relationships similar to ritual kinship and practical kinshipBourdieu 1980 can play a critical role in education.Halperin 2008 Studies have shown that in many poor communities, godparents or \\"secular godparents\\" are expected to help with children's schooling.Kemper 1982Mintz & Wolf 1950Nutini 1984Nutini & Bell 1980 Community volunteers serve as secular godparents to help fulfill the needs of the children that parents are unable to meet: school supplies, clothing, food, as well as counseling, time, affection, trust, and \\"...inputs of resources for the future well-being of children and for their responsible citizenship.\\" Halperin 2008 Halperin suggests that ritual kin \\"materialize things differently from other kin, biological and fictive...they are generous (often beyond their means)...and are generous with time.\\"Halperin 2008 In the community school setting, Halperin observes many different forms of practical (fictive) kinship Bourdieu 1980 that are particularly ritualized (i.e., adoption, child foster care (temporary and permanent), and various other forms of nonbiological or extra- biological kinship. In The Logic of Practice, Bourdieu describes the concept of practical kinship: = Gift economy in education= In his book The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies, Marcel Mauss examines the nature of gift exchange and gift economy. Mauss describes a system of total services that Pacific and North American tribes participate in where economic transaction is only one component, noting that other actions take place such as \\"acts of politeness: banquets, rituals, military services, women, children, dances, festivals, fairs\\"(5)Mauss 1990 Mauss developed a theory of the three obligations: 1) obligation to reciprocate presents received; 2) obligation to give presents; and 3) obligation to receive presents. Mauss contends that \\"To refuse to give, to fail to invite, just as to refuse to accept, is tantamount to declaring war; it is to reject the bond of alliance and commonality.\\"(13)Mauss 1990 Gift economies also take place in educational settings. In some schools, the community provisions school supplies to school children through gifts, \\"Parents model gifting for their children who, in turn carry the practices of gifting to the next generation. We could speculate that the worsening conditions of Late Capitalism will create greater and greater demand for gifting.Halperin 2008 Unlike the gifting rituals in archaic times that were designed to strengthen elite power, the rituals in the community school serve as \\"...leveling mechanisms with loose expectations of reciprocity in many different forms and at much later times\\" (258)Halperin 2008 The only thing the community elders expect in return from the children is for them to \\"give back\\" to the community at some point in their lives. Instead of social inequality and hierarchy, the intended outcome of the gifting economy at the community school is social justice and equal opportunity.Halperin 2008 In the school environment, gifting is also viewed as an investment strategy: Schools can also engage in gifting the public by providing kids a prospect for a productive life and by keeping them out of jail. Gifting also involves sacrifice by the community volunteers and founders of schools who sacrifice time, family, and health in the name of community, kids, education, and heritage preservation and conservation.Halperin 2008 Gifting the children is much more than charity in that it insures kids' abilities to give back to the community.Halperin 2008  Examples  = Local knowledge = The literature in anthropology suggests that local knowledge Geertz 1983Gramsci 1971 can play a pivotal role in the success of schools by sustaining community participation in education. The main goal of community schools is to produce citizens who are skilled through curriculum in which local knowledge holds an equal place with credentialed knowledge, thus \\"creating a balance between school and community\\"(261).Halperin 2008 The Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci believed that all people are “organic intellectuals,”Gramsci 1971 in other words, being an intellectual is not just reserved for the elite or upper classes. Gramsci stressed the significance of intellectuals being part of everyday life. In Gramsci's view, intellect is not based solely on academic knowledge, “...the mode of being of the new intellectual can no longer consist in eloquence…but in active participation in practical life, as a constructor, organizer, 'permanent persuader' and not just a simple oratore…”(10).Gramsci 1971 Gramsci further argues that the purpose of education should be \\"to create a single type of formative school (primary-secondary) which would take the child up to the threshold of his choice of job, forming him during this time as a person capable of thinking, studying and ruling - or controlling those who rule.\\"(40)Gramsci 1971 Gramsci contends that in order for schools to be successful, it is critical that students actively participate in their own learning and, in order for this to occur, the school must relate to everyday life. HalperinHalperin 2008 suggests that children can act as organic intellectuals when school administrators utilize the children's desires and personal information to impact and inform the power structure, “Anytime there was an opportunity, the kids were quoted, whether it was to woo a candidate during a job interview or to convince a member of the school board that the school was indeed necessary” (258). Halperin Halperin 2008 connects the informal educators in the community school with Gramsci's ideas of the role of the organic intellectual, “Intersections of kin work and paid work blur distinction s between work and family in the school and in the community at large….Employing community kin, insuring job stability, and keeping the peace are also priorities. These practices are all forms of resistance to capitalism, globalization, and several forms of hegemony including, but not limited to formal school structures and conventional disciplinary practices” (252). Gramsci helps to link theory with practice, with his creation of working class intellectuals actively participating in practical life, that are assisting in developing a counter hegemony that would undermine existing social relations.Gramsci 1971 In The Essential Foucault: Selections from Essential Works of Foucault, Michel Foucault also offers alternatives for thought and new courses for active learners in education in his discussion of the reshaping of the self, “…even for the slave or for the mad, under situations where the models of selfhood are imposed from outside, a certain self-crafting is required…and each crafting of a relation with the self arises out of, and entails, a crafting of one’s relations to others – be they one’s superiors, one’s pupils, one’s colleagues…” (xxi)Rabinow and Rose 2003 This idea is similar to Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s Rousseau 1979 understanding of the child as an “active” learner and also Paulo Freire’s conscientization.Freire 2007 American anthropologist Clifford Geertz Geertz 1983 also posits the importance of the local knowledge and common sense of people involved in everyday life: The preceding literature suggests that school orientations and professional development led by community leaders and residents that instruct teachers about community heritage might lead to a more successful educational experience and outcomes for children and the community. An important objective of heritage preservation is to help people in a community develop a collective identity. David LowenthalLowenthal 1985 suggests that “Remembering the past is crucial for our sense of identity…to know what we were confirms that we are” (p. 197). Good and GoodGood & Good 2008 argue the importance of memory, suggesting that “…ways of framing that which is hidden or left unspoken…suggest the importance of an increasing body of writing on memory, traumatic memory, and memory politics and of methods aimed at observing or retrieving remainders of violence or traumatic historical events” (2008:15). In engaging with the past it is important that we do not forget the youth in the community that are the future of the community. They are stakeholders as well as the adults, and they too need a voice. Makagon and Neuman Makagon and Neuman 2009 suggest that the narrative realm can be enlarged through citizen storytellers who “…can be anyone who wants to create a documentary about historical or contemporary life…the concept is based in the idea of democratizing the means of representing interests, issues, experiences, and the concerns of people who do not have access to media but have stories they want to tell”(55). Coming to terms with the past is critical both for elders but also for youth and its impact on their evolving identity. = Credentialed knowledge = In contrast to local knowledge, \\"credentialed knowledge\\" is knowledge that is determined to be \\"legitimate.\\" In other words, credentialed knowledge is that which is included to be suitable for learning in public (and private) school curricula. It is the knowledge that is sanctioned by local, state, and federal authorities. It is also the knowledge that discipline specific associations (e.g., National Council of Teachers of Mathematics; International Reading Association; Council for Exceptional Children) advocate as essential to their particular academic discipline. Curricula in K-12 schools are guided by both national and state policy-makers, including private companies who publish school textbooks, programs, and materials. Often, local knowledge as described previously is minimized or not included altogether.  Measuring educational capital  In the recent age of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, educational capital at the national, state, and local levels has been measured by high-stakes testing that have determined the educational effectiveness of individual states, school districts, schools, and teachers. The learning outcomes of students have also been evaluated by these once-per-year standardized assessments, often determining whether they have attained the appropriate level of growth from one year to another. Children can be passed to the next grade level of retained based on their performance on these assessments. A growing sentiment among conservative politicians and some businesses is that the purpose of public education is to provide the private sector with individuals who are trained to perform whatever job required. To this end, an emphasis on job or career specific training has begun to permeate the rhetoric with respect to educational policy. A recent reform in public K-12 is the public support of Charter Schools. Charter schools are supposed to be alternatives to public school such that they provide students with innovative curricula and educational experiences. Since state legislatures began passing charter legislation in the 1990s, nearly 3,000 new schools have been established. Some of these schools are funded by specific businesses, corporations, or individual benefactors that espouse particular ideals or goals for the education of children and youth. Chartering permits schools to \\"... run independently of the traditional public school system and tailor their programs to community needs.\\" US Charter Schools, 2010 Even though all charter schools are not exceptionally innovative and some schools operate similarly to traditional public schools, policymakers, parents, and educators are looking at chartering as a way to increase educational choice and innovation within the public school system.US Charter Schools, 2010  References   Bibliography  * Appadurai, Arjun (1986) Commodities and the Politics of Value.

A native of Vermont, Nathaniel Fillmore farmed in Bennington until he was in his mid-twenties when his brother Calvin and he moved to western New York. Duped by unscrupulous land agents, their titles proved defective and they lost their new farms. Nathaniel Fillmore became a tenant farmer and occasionally taught school; his family's circumstances were so dire that they sometimes relied on the charity of their landlords to survive. Over time, Fillmore's fortunes turned for the better. While living in Niles, New York he became prominent enough in the community to serve in local offices including justice of the peace. While living in Niles, he followed the advice of his wife and procured a clerk's position for their son Millard in the law office of Judge Walter Wood, who was also their landlord. This clerkship began Millard Fillmore's training to become an attorney, and placed him on the path to a legal and political career that culminated with the presidency. Nathaniel Fillmore eventually bought a farm in East Aurora, which he developed into a successful venture, and which he continued to work on until well into his later years. Millard Fillmore became president in 1850, and his father visited him at the White House in 1851. Nathaniel Fillmore died in East Aurora in 1863 and was buried at East Aurora Cemetery. Early life Nathaniel Fillmore Jr. was born on April 19, 1771 in Bennington, Bennington County, Vermont, to Nathaniel Fillmore Sr. and Hepzibah Wood. He was educated in Bennington, and worked on his father's farm as a young man. After his marriage, Fillmore began farming in Bennington. Shortly thereafter, Nathaniel and his brother Calvin Fillmore were approached by land agents offering tracts in Western New York state. Unhappy with trying to make the stony ground of their Vermont farms productive, they quickly grabbed the opportunity and moved to Cayuga County, New York, sight unseen. Move to New York According to biographers of Millard Fillmore, \\"The Fillmore brothers moved their two families to their new homeland nestled deep within a timber-laden forest. Location was not their greatest problem. Nor was the dense clay they unearthed once the land was cleared. Their greatest setback came with the realization that faulty surveying coupled with corrupt local government officials had left them with virtually nothing.\\" The Fillmore brothers lost their land because of defective titles. Duped, tired, and poor, Nathaniel eventually became a tenant farmer while occasionally teaching school, working the soil for landlords and taking their charity when necessary to survive. Over time, Nathaniel Fillmore's fortunes changed; he became prominent enough while living in Niles, New York that he served as a justice of the peace for eleven years. He eventually purchased a farm in East Aurora, New York which he developed into a productive enterprise, and on which he continued to be active until well into his old age. While living in Niles, Fillmore followed his wife's advice to secure a clerk’s position for their son Millard in the law office of their landlord, Judge Walter Wood. Though Millard did not complete the clerkship, it set him on the eventual path to a successful legal and political career that carried him to the presidency. Later life Millard Fillmore assumed the presidency in 1850, and Nathaniel visited him at the White House in 1851. President Fillmore and his wife anticipated this visit more than any other, and were concerned that some circumstance requiring Fillmore's attention might prevent it. The other guests at the formal reception Nathaniel Fillmore attended expected to see someone elderly and infirm, given that Millard Fillmore was then 51 years old. They were surprised to meet a man, then approaching 80, who noticeably resembled Millard Fillmore, and was in such good health that he did not appear old enough to be the president's father. Questioned by a guest who wanted to know how to raise a son to become president, Nathaniel Fillmore alluded to his one-time poverty by replying \\"Cradle him in a sap trough.\\" Death and burial He died in East Aurora, New York on March 28, 1863. He was buried at East Aurora Cemetery, also known as Pioneer Cemetery. Family In 1796, the 25 year-old Fillmore married sixteen year-old Phoebe Millard, daughter of a prominent physician, in Bennington. Together, they had nine children: *Olive Fillmore (1797–1883) *Millard Fillmore (1800–1874) *Cyrus Fillmore (1801–1889) *Almon Fillmore (1806–1830) *Calvin Fillmore (1810–1879) *Julia Fillmore (1812–1891) *Darius Fillmore (1814–1837) *Charles Fillmore (1817–1854) *Phoebe Fillmore (1819–1843) After Phoebe died in 1831, he remarried to Eunice Love in 1834. =Distinction= He was the first of only four fathers (the other three being George Tryon Harding, Joseph P.

It is one of a number of methods for robust regression.  Description of method  Instead of the standard least squares method, which minimises the sum of squared residuals over n points, the LTS method attempts to minimise the sum of squared residuals over a subset, k, of those points. The unused n - k points do not influence the fit. In a standard least squares problem, the estimated parameter values β are defined to be those values that minimise the objective function S(β) of squared residuals: :S = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n r_i(\\\\beta)^2, where the residuals are defined as the differences between the values of the dependent variables (observations) and the model values: :r_i(\\\\beta) = y_i - f(x_i, \\\\beta), and where n is the overall number of data points. For a least trimmed squares analysis, this objective function is replaced by one constructed in the following way. For a fixed value of β, let r_{(j)}(\\\\beta) denote the set of ordered absolute values of the residuals (in increasing order of absolute value). In this notation, the standard sum of squares function is :S(\\\\beta) = \\\\sum_{j=1}^n r_{(j)}(\\\\beta)^2, while the objective function for LTS is :S_k(\\\\beta) = \\\\sum_{j=1}^k r_{(j)}(\\\\beta)^2.  Computational considerations  Because this method is binary, in that points are either included or excluded, no closed-form solution exists. As a result, methods for finding the LTS solution sift through combinations of the data, attempting to find the k subset that yields the lowest sum of squared residuals. Methods exist for low n that will find the exact solution; however, as n rises, the number of combinations grows rapidly, thus yielding methods that attempt to find approximate (but generally sufficient) solutions.

Only one British seaman, a crewman from Suworow, was killed.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, pp.507-8. However, Suworow's sails and rigging were so badly cut up that Captain had to tow her.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.529.

He was affiliated with Eastern Michigan University (known as Michigan State Normal College prior to 1956) for most of his life, beginning his association with the school as a student in 1910 and retiring as the school's athletic director in 1963. Biography Rynearson was born in Three Oaks, Michigan. He was the son of Isaiah Rynearson and Grace Ann McCarten. He attended Michigan State Normal College from 1910 to 1914 and played for the football, baseball, and basketball teams. He was the captain of the basketball team his junior and his senior year, during which time the team achieved a record of 17–8. Eastern Michigan University records also list Rynearson as the basketball team captain for the 1916–17 season, in which the team's record was 15–1. Rynearson played three years of minor league baseball from 1913 to 1915 for the Kalamazoo Kazoos in the Southern Michigan League (1913–1914) and the Brantford Red Sox in the Canadian League (1915). The 1916 Michigan State Normal College yearbook, The Aurora, lists Rynearson as an assistant coach of the football team, and he assumed head coaching responsibilities in 1917. Over the course of his career, he coached at least one year in every varsity sport at Michigan State Normal, including football, basketball, baseball and track. In 28 years as the head football coach, Rynearson compiled a record of 114–58–15. He led the 1925 and 1927 football teams to undefeated 8–0 records. Between 1925 and 1927, his teams compiled a record of 22–1 and outscored their opponents by a combined score of 405 to 31. In 17 years as the basketball coach, he compiled a record of 141–100. During a four-year stretch from 1917 to 1921, he led the basketball team to a combined record of 48–9, including a one-loss season in his first year as the coach. He also served as athletic director from 1948 to 1963. Rynearson continued to live in Ypsilanti, Michigan in his later years. In November 1966, the National Football Foundation awarded him the Willie Heston Award, given each year to an individual personifying the leadership qualities developed by football. Rynearson suffered a heart attack on January 28, 1967, and died one week later at St. Joseph Hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan. His funeral was held at St. John's Catholic Church in Ypsilanti. In September 1969, Eastern Michigan dedicated its new football stadium as Rynearson Stadium. The Eastern Michigan football program has played its home games at Rynearson Stadium since the 1969 season. In 1976, Rynearson was posthumously named one of the inaugural members of the Eastern Michigan University Athletic Hall of Fame. Football coach Football team photo from the 1916 MSNC yearbook. Following the smallpox-shortened 1916 season, during which he was an assistant coach, Rynearson was hired to replace Elmer Mitchell as head coach. Although Rynearson's offense was more effective, outscoring opponents 111 to 82, more than half of the scoring came in a single game, a 63–0 rout of Central Michigan, and the team ended the season with a 3–4 record. After the shortened three-game 1918 season was coached by Lynn Bell, Rynearson returned to coach the 1919 squad to their first winning season in four years. After another winning season in 1920, other coaches assumed the duties for four years, during which the team managed a 9–15–4 record. Because of the multiple breaks in his coaching time periods, Rynearson is one of a select group of college football coaches with non-consecutive tenure. Rynearson's return in 1925 sparked the most successful period in school history. From 1925 through 1930, the team achieved a 40–4–2 record, including perfect seasons in 1925 and 1927. From 1925 through 1927 they outscored opponents 405 points to 31 and registered 19 shutouts. They won the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association Championship in 1925, and won the Michigan Collegiate Conference championships in 1927, 1928, 1929, and 1930. Although less dominant, Rynearson's teams continued to have success throughout the 1930s, never having a losing season until the teams of 1940 and 1941 combined for a 2–10–3 record. The 1943 and 1945 teams (there was no team in 1944) were again successful, combining for a 7–0–1 record. However, following the end of World War II, Rynearson's teams again struggled, and he ended his coaching career on a streak of three losing seasons from 1946 through 1948. His 26 seasons as head coach are double those of the next-longest serving coach, Fred Trosko, and no Eastern Michigan University football coach has reached even half of Rynearson's win total of 114 games.\\"> Basketball coach Rynearson served as men's basketball coach for MSNC from 1917–1921, 1925–1932, 1935–1940, and 1944-1946. In his 18 years as the men's basketball head coach, he compiled a record of 160-129. During a four-year stretch from 1917 to 1921, he led the basketball team to a combined record of 48-11, including a one-loss season in his first year as the coach and the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association Championship in 1921.

Kyunggi High School was the first high school of Gyeongseong at the time, and Kyungbock High school was named the second. Its main building was built on June 20, 1921. In 1938, the school changed its name to Kyungbock Middle School, meaning that it is located close to Gyeongbok Palace. In 1946, right after emancipation from the Japanese Colonial Rule, the school extended its admission to younger students. It educated students of grades 7-12 at the time. 7 years later, the school divided its curriculum into middle school and high school courses.

History Wigwam Mills was founded in 1905 by Herbert Chesebro, Robert Ehany, and Lawerance Bentz in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, a year after the Sheboygan Knitting Company burned to the ground. All three founders were employees of the company and purchased equipment and recruited employees from their former company. The new company was founded under the name \\"Hand Knit Hosiery Company.\\" It made socks and headwear, primarily from wool, for the residents and lumbermen of the area. At the time the company was supplied by numerous nearby wool mills. By 1922, Herbert Chesebro gained partial control of the company after purchasing Bentz's share. The company flourished under Chesebro. When the stock market crashed, the hosiery industry struggled in the difficult economy of the Great Depression. After Herbert's death, the company had bank loans totaling $100,000. With the help of J.W. Hansen of the Citizens Bank, the company stayed in business. In 1936, Robert Chesebro, Sr. gained complete control of the company after working at the company for 12 years. The company devoted up to 75% of its capacity to knitting for the troops overseas. By 1945 the company had expanded its line to include baseball hosiery, anklets, hockey caps, mittens, and socks for all types of activities. The company prospered for the next 65 years knitting socks, headwear, and other knit products. On January 1, 1957, the company changed its name from Hand-Knit Hosiery to Wigwam Mills, based on the popularity of the brand. The company continued under the leadership of Robert Chesebro, Sr., and eventually the third generation of ownership, Robert Chesebro, Jr. The 1980s saw growth in many areas for Wigwam. A new logo and more technical synthetic fibers were becoming more specialized. Wigwam developed the Poly-Wool line of performance socks as well as the overnight success—Moraine. From the mid-1980s through the late 1990s the Wigwam 622 slouch socks became very popular. They were worn by kids, tweens, teens, college students and adults. Not only as athletic wear but everyday fashions too. Rolling one's jeans and khakis to show off the slouch socks, wearing the socks over skinny jeans, ankle length skirts and dresses, and ankle length cotton pants, both styles since they stopped at the ankle showed off the socks, were popular styles. Also two other very popular styles were one wearing the socks over leggings with Keds or boat shoes with oversized tees, oversized sweaters, an oversized sweater or oversized sweatshirt over a turtleneck. And two wearing the white color of the socks over opaque tights with a babydoll or skater dress and white Keds or in warmer weather with bike shorts showing from under the babydoll or skater dress with the white Keds. In the 1990s, the company developed the Ultimax and INgenious brands. Each featured a patented sock technology. In 2007, both brands were brought under the Wigwam brand umbrella. Ultimax became Wigwam Pro and INgenious became Wigwam Fusion. In May 2020, the company announced it would lay off 85% of its employees, due to the coronavirus pandemic, effectively ending production.

Description The scientific name Turbo cornutus, literally means \\"horned turban,\\" and it is characterized by a hard, ventricose, spiny, imperforate shell of which the length varies between 65 mm and 120 mm. It has a large, thick, green-gray shell with irregular incremental striae and spiral lirae. The shell has about 5-6 whorls, which turn clockwise and have horny protuberances. The body whorl is ventricose, somewhat bicarinate, armed about the middle with two spiral series of erect tubular spines, and frequently a smaller accessory row above. The lower series of spines is sometimes absent. The thickness and shape of the shell and the horns vary greatly according to environmental conditions. The sutures are deeply impressed. The oblique aperture is rounded and is about 3.5 cm in diameter, and is green or red-brown. The thin inside lip of the shell is not smooth, but rough and granular. The broad columellais flattened and somewhat grooved, produced and channelled at its base. Turbo cornutus develops an operculum, which is calcareous, concave and brown within. It contains four whorls. The nucleus measures one-third the distance across the face. The operculum itself bears a deep, spiral groove and is also granular on the convex outer surface. This outer surface is white or tinged with brown and olive, more or less sharply asperate with elevated points, and with a spiral rib commencing in an axial elevation and terminating at the margin of increment. When separated from the attached animal, the inner side of the operculum is flat, with a somewhat smooth spiral.G.W. Tryon (1888), Manual of Conchology X; Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia Due to an anatomical quirk of growth of gastropods, the anus is located on its head. As marine snails, they breathe through gills. Distribution This marine species occurs off the Mascarene Basin, the Philippines,Jeju Island and China. According to Fukuda 2017, Turbo cornutus should be restricted to the species endemic to southern China and Taiwan. The species in Japan is Turbo sazae. Habitat and reproduction Turbo cornutus can be found in relatively shallow coastal waters (up to 30 meters deep). It can be found around China. It feeds on various kinds of algae. Young horned turban shells eat red-turf algae, while adults eat larger seaweed. Turbo cornutus spawns from August to September, although the gonads begin to mature from May. Larvae have a very short period as free-floating plankton at approximately five days, after which they settle and begin to develop a shell. The planktonic and early shell- growing stages are highly dangerous times for young horned turban shells, and they are eaten in large numbers. Consumption \\"Sazae\\" for consumption in Japan. Turbo cornutus is enjoyed as a delicacy in Japan, where it is known as \\"sazae.\\" After cooking, the corkscrew-like animal can be drawn out of its shell using its hard operculum, or hard, rocky lid, to which it is firmly attached. The operculum is not edible, and must be discarded along with the animal's shell after eating. References * Hooper, R (2007). \\"Horned turban shell\\". The Japan Times. Retrieved on 2010-07-06.

The solid, large shell has an ovate-pointed shape. This is a very variable species. The color pattern of the shell is cream, irregularly maculated with greenish and brown, and broken lines of black. The apex is almost always pink. The six whorls are convex, separated by subcanaliculate sutures. The upper two whorls are smooth, the lower spirally lirate and radiately more or less squamose striate. The lirae are sometimes subequal and nearly smooth. The main body whorl has 20 distinct spiral ribs, mostly flat-topped, some with fluted scales. The body whorl contains about thirteen lirae, which are generally wider than their interstices, and of which the subcoronal and one or two median ones are more prominent. The penultimate and last whorl bear numerous elevated vaulted scales upon the lirae. The aperture is pearly white or brownish tinted within, about half the length of the shell. It is round-ovate, angled above, dilated and subchannelled below. The columella is thickened, somewhat flattened and grooved below the narrow deeply perforating umbilicus. T The operculum is flat inside with 5 whorls. Its nucleus is situated one-third the distance across the face. The outer surface is convex, with coarse obtuse granules, which are largest upon the higher part, nearly surrounded by a marginal series of fine oblique wrinkles. The color is white, more or less tinged with flesh color upon the outer half, and with a narrow marginal orange line.G.W. Tryon (1888), Manual of Conchology X; Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia Distribution This species and its subspecies are distributed in the Red Sea and in the tropical Indo-West Pacific off Aldabra, Chagos, Madagascar, the Mascarene Basin, Mozambique and Tanzania; off Andaman Islands and Nicobar Islands, East India, the Philippines; off Australia (Northern Territory, Queensland, Western Australia).

His works have been performed throughout Canada and Europe by ensembles like the Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony, the Renaissance Singers, the Scholars of London, Symphony Hamilton, the Waterloo Chamber Players, and the Wellington Winds among others. Early life and education Born in Tuberose, Saskatchewan, McDonald studied at The Royal Conservatory of Music where he earned an associate diploma in 1951 and a licentiate diploma in 1953. Among his teachers were Murray Adaskin (music composition) and Lyell Gustin (piano). A grant from the Canada Council enabled him to pursue further studies in Paris from 1957-1960 with Nadia Boulanger (composition) and Jean Casadesus (piano). He also studied composition in the summers with John Cage, Darius Milhaud, and Stefan Wolpe. Career In 1963 McDonald won the Leschetizky Debut Prize which led to his New York City recital debut at Town Hall. In 1966 McDonald formed a piano duo with Garth Beckett,Ned Powers. \\"Knabe piano returns home to Gustin House\\".

Birdwatching For birdwatchers, the Mantanani Islands are great for seeing birds that usually nest on islands, because of their relative lack of terrestrial predators, and are rarely or unpredictably seen on the mainland. There are several trails through the center of the Mantanani Besar island in addition to open beaches along the coasts where birds can be spotted. Mantanani Besar is the only place in Malaysia to see the Mantanani scops owl. The islands are also home to four breeding pigeon species that include the Pied imperial-pigeon, Grey imperial- pigeon, Pink-necked green pigeon and Metallic pigeon. An additional two pigeon species visit the island occasionally from the mainland and they include the Nicobar pigeon and the Black-naped fruit dove. Emerald Doves can also be seen on the island.

The Plankton I Expedition - Sozopol 15 days: July 20 - August 3, 1970. In this first expedition of the Plankton program,Plankton I, Boat Dju II Papazov set out to determine whether zoo-plankton can provide sufficient nutrition to survive on in extreme conditions. On board Dju II (a conventional dinghy), he spent 15 days alone off the coast of Sozopol in the Bay of Burgas in the Black Sea, eating nothing but plankton. Despite some weight loss, it was determined that plankton can potentially sustain humans in distress. The Plankton II Expedition - Across the Black Sea 26 days: May 25 - June 6, 1972. Papazov undertook this expedition along with his wife, Julia Gurkovska (nicknamed Dju, giving her name to all the boats in the Dju series). In 26 days, they crossed the Black Sea from Varna to Sochi, aboard a standard keel-less lifeboat, Dju III. This was a continuation of the first plankton experiment, with their on-board diet supplying only 50% of required daily nutrition. Relying on zoo-plankton for the rest was shown to significantly reduce the expected exhaustion in their organisms. This was the first crossing of the Black Sea with a vessel of this caliber.Plankton II, Boat Dju III The Plankton III Expedition - Across the Atlantic 63 days: May 8 - July 16, 1974. This was the first truly daring expedition that Papazov and his wife undertook.Researchers to sail Atlantic using plankton for food On an 8-metre keel-less lifeboat (dubbed Dju IV), they set out to cross the Atlantic from Gibraltar to Cuba. The journey was a grueling test of endurance. The two-person crew had to keep 4-hour steering shifts around the clock to ensure the boat didn't flip over in the turbulent Atlantic. Unlike most yachts, Dju IV was originally a ship's lifeboat, made of two sheets of plastic bolted together. It was designed to withstand a few days at sea at most, and lacked a weighted keel, which made it prone to flipping and guaranteed that such a flip would be irreversible. The Plankton III voyage marked the first long-haul trip of such a lifeboat.Plankton III, Boat Dju IV The journey ended successfully in Santiago de Cuba. The Plankton IV Expedition - Across the Pacific 140 days (100 days at sea): March 17 - August 3, 1976. After crossing the Atlantic, Papazov and his wife planned to cross the Pacific in a similar way. Leaning on their experiences with Dju IV, they outfitted their next lifeboat much more carefully. It sported a full deck, an outboard engine which powered a lit compass and their radio and a water pump. The crew had to maintain around-the-clock steering, and faced numerous technical problems. In the first days of the expedition, the boat's radio antenna broke, cutting off communication with the outside world and making issuing a distress call impossible. Later the steering oar also broke, and finally, 1000 miles from Callao, the aluminum mast snapped in a storm, leaving them to complete the bulk of their journey with a makeshift mast. Despite all obstacles, they consecutively reached the Marquesas, Tahiti, and Samoa. After 100 days at sea, their journey ended successfully in Fiji, 14,800 km from their starting point in Peru.Plankton IV, Boat Dju V Around Europe With Tivia 91 days: September 6 - December 9, 1978. Having decided to sponsor Papazov's next voyage, the Bulgarian National Television purchased a two-mast yacht, model \\"Conrad - 45A\\", built in Gdańsk, Poland in 1978. In exchange, Papazov was tasked with sailing the yacht from Gdańsk to Burgas along with a BNT filming crew. The yacht, named Tivia, took the journey around Europe in the winter of 1978, going through the Baltic Sea, the Bay of Biscay, the Mediterranean, and finally the Black Sea. The crew consisted of Doncho Papazov, Julia Papazova, their 5-year old daughter Yana, Simeon Idakiev, Boris Siriyski, Rumen Kostov and Peter Andonov. Simeon Idakiev wrote a book about the voyage, capturing all the difficult and comic moments. The Plankton V Expedition - Around the World 777 days: April 29, 1979 - June 14, 1981. Among increased marital strains, Doncho and Julia began preparing for their around-the-world expedition.Plankton V, A cruise around the world with the \\"Tivia yacht\\"(sic) No longer on a life boat, the journey would be undertaken on Tivia, and would take two years. Doncho and Julia took their daughter Yana (then 6), tested in the Europe expedition, along for the journey,Bulgarian family sails high seas triggering some cautions from their family and various child welfare advocates. One of the experiments they conducted as a continuation of the Plankton program was teaching the Grade 1 curriculum while at sea. Stage I: Sozopol - Gibraltar - Canary Islands - Martinique - Venezuela - Curaçao - Panama The Papazov family was joined by Harry Mladenov and Stoyan Miladinov from BNT from Sozopol to Gibraltar, and they shot a documentary about the expedition. Stage II: Ecuador - Tahiti - Tonga - Rarotonga - Fiji - New Guinea - Torres Strait - Port Darwin (Australia) Stage III: Port Darwin - Mauritius - Reunion Island Stage IV: Reunion Island - Durban - Cape of Good Hope - Cape Town Stage V: Cape Town - St. Helena - Brazil Stage VI: Brazil - Azores - Gibraltar Stage VII: Seuta - Algiers - Istanbul - Sozopol The Impossible Route Expedition 164 days: January 1, 1988 - June 13, 1988.

M. W. Greer (born August 23, 1957) is an American playwright. He is the author of Burning Blue, written in 1992 and premiered at the King's Head Theatre on London's fringe in 1995. Early life Born David Milne Willard III in Patuxent River, Maryland. His father, Daniel David Milne Willard, was a test pilot at the United States Naval Test Pilot School. His mother, Suzanne, daughter of Navy test pilot Seymour Anderson Johnson and Alice Virginia Kelley, was a homemaker. In 1965 his mother remarried Vice Admiral Howard E. Greer of Tyler, Texas, and the family moved to Yokosuka, Japan, where his stepfather was stationed with the Seventh Fleet. In 1968, stepfather Greer was Commanding Officer of the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Hancock which is now in the National Air and Space Museum. After more than 20 different schools in 17 cities, Greer graduated from Radford High School in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1975. He began his university education at the United States Naval Academy (Class of 1980) before bilging out and transferring to Oregon State University where he jumped ahead a year, made the Dean's List and earned a bachelor's degree in Architecture/Landscape on the same day he was commissioned an ensign in the Navy. The U.S. Navy After reporting to Pensacola, Florida, for flight training Greer earned his wings in 1982 and reported to an anti-submarine warfare helicopter squadron in San Diego, California, where he flew the now obsolete Kaman SH-2 Seasprite. In 1983 Greer was transferred to the Naval Information Office on Fifth Avenue in New York City where he was responsible for promoting the Navy to the major media outlets and assisted in the planning of the Statue of Liberty Centennial celebrations. In 1986 he left the U.S. Navy. Acting and other interests Greer worked as a freelance graphic designer for various magazines and illustrated a couple of travel books (the Rum & Reggae series) for his friend, Jonathan Runge. For a time he worked for a multi-media production company and then managed the office of a small computer networking company in exchange for a sofa-bed to sleep on while he studied acting at The Orchard. After unexceptional performances in several off-off Broadway productions in New York, a small role in a Nantucket production of The Normal Heart and small roles in The Westport Country Playhouse production of A Few Good Men, he decided this was not his calling. 1990s and 2000s In 1992 Greer wrote his first play, Burning Blue, which opened at The King's Head on London's fringe in 1995 to great critical acclaim. West End producer, Robert Fox took it to The Theatre Royal, Haymarket, where the play received Evening Standard nominations and the production won two Olivier Awards for John Napier's set design and David Hersey's sound design. The play opened in Cape Town and then Johannesburg in 1996. Burning Blue then opened in Tel Aviv’s Beit Lessin Theatre where it also won critical praise and played to full houses for 18 months. In 1998 John Hickok returned to the helm directing the American premiere in Los Angeles at the tiny Court Theatre where it was an instant hit with the Los Angeles Times. Kevin Otto (from the South Africa production) reprised his role as Lt. Dan Lynch, and Martin McDougall – who originated the role of Lt. JG Charlie Trumbo in London – returned to play the role again. They were joined by Tim DeKay who wowed the critics with his portrayal of Lt. Will Stephensen originally played by Irish Actor/Director Ian FitzGibbon in the London.

It is one of the eight social justice tribunals in Ontario. Any person who believes they have been discriminated against under the Ontario Human Rights Code may bring an application to the Tribunal.  History  The Ontario Human Rights Code was the first law of its kind in Canada. It took effect on June 15, 1962, bringing together various laws dealing with different kinds of discrimination, and adding some new protections. The Ontario Human Rights Code of 1962 replaced the province's existing anti-discrimination legislation, including: * Fair Employment Practices Act, 1951 which prohibited discrimination based on race and religion in employment; * Female Employee's Fair Remuneration Act, 1951 which prohibited an employer from paying a female employee less money for the same work done by a man in the same establishment * Fair Accommodation Practices Act, 1954 which prohibited discrimination in public places on racial, religious or ethnic grounds; * Ontario Anti-Discrimination Commission Act, 1958 which created a commission to administer the above acts and develop educational programs; The Ontario Human Rights Commission was created to administer the Ontario Human Rights Code.  Current structure  = Ontario Human Rights Commission (\\"OHRC\\") = Since June 30, 2008 all new complaints of discrimination are filed with the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario. However, the OHRC has the right to be informed of all applications before the HRTO and receives copies of all applications and responses. In matters affecting broad public interest, the OHRC may take its own cases to the Tribunal or intervene in human rights cases before the Tribunal. The OHRC also develops policies and provides targeted public education, monitors human rights, does research and analysis, and conducts human rights inquiries. = Human Rights Legal Support Centre = The Centre offers human rights legal services to individuals who file applications with the Tribunal. Services may include legal assistance in filing applications, providing advice, and legal representation at mediations and hearings. The Centre does not provide legal services to respondents and only represents 12% of applicants before the Tribunal. Services are prioritized, especially full representation, to clients who are particularly disadvantaged and who would have difficulty navigating the human rights system without assistance. Applicants with unmeritorious cases or who could otherwise afford legal representation are not represented. = Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario (\\"HRTO\\") = This administrative Tribunal determines whether or not an applicant's rights have been violated. The Tribunal is aimed at providing quick and direct access for applicants and a fair dispute resolution process for all parties, including respondents. The Tribunal is able to handle a large volume of complaints without accumulating a backlog, applications are processed quickly, there is high level of transparency to the Tribunal's decision-making. Transparency is achieved through the public availability of procedural and substantive written decisions. There is a significantly greater volume of final decisions decided on their merits; the Tribunal's rulings on discrimination appear impartial; and public interest remedies are routinely awarded where discrimination is found. Criticisms of the Tribunal include: * Unnecessary complexity in forms * Insufficient use of mediation * Low general damage awards * Complex procedures and processes  Process  An individual who has experienced discrimination may file a claim with the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario. Applicants to HRTO may be eligible for legal assistance from the Human Rights Legal Support Centre. The parties can choose to first attempt to resolve the matter through mediation. If the mediation is unsuccessful or if the parties choose not to attempt mediation then a preliminary hearing may be ordered if, for example, there is a question as to whether HRTO has jurisdiction to decide the allegations. A summary hearing may be ordered if there appears to be no reasonable prospect that the application can succeed. Hearings before HRTO are legal proceedings. Within 21 days after receiving the notice of hearing, the parties must provide each other with disclosure, with any documents that are relevant to the application with the other party. No later than 45 days before the hearing date, parties must: # Send the other party a list of witnesses, a statement of each witness' intended evidence, and a list of documents that will be presented at the hearing. If documents have already been provided to the other party, they do not need to be sent again. # Send HRTO the witness list, witness statements, and copies of all documents that will be used at the hearing. Prior to the hearing, the adjudicator will give the parties the option of trying mediation/adjudication. If they agree, the adjudicator will work with them to attempt to resolve the dispute through mediation. If it is not successful, the hearing will proceed with the same adjudicator, who will not consider anything heard or said in the mediation. The adjudicator will hear the evidence of both parties before making a decision. Although the Ontario Human Rights Code says that HRTO's decisions are final and binding on the parties, HRTO may agree to reconsider a final decision if: * a party has new facts that were not available at the time of the hearing which could change the result of the HRTO's decision * a party did not receive notice of the hearing and was unable to participate, through no fault of the party * the decision conflicts with the HRTO's procedure or case law and involves a matter of general or public importance There is no right as a matter of law to appeal a HRTO decision. However, under limited circumstances, a dissatisfied party may make a request for judicial review to the Divisional Court. Judicial review will only be granted if the Court is satisfied that the decision is unreasonable. This does not mean that the Court merely thinks that HRTO could or should have decided differently.  Standard and burden of proof  In cases before the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal, the ultimate standard of proof is the civil standard, which is on a balance of probabilities or \\"more likely than not\\". This in comparison to the standard of proof that applies in criminal cases, which is guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The burden of proof rests on the party making the allegations. As in criminal cases, it is possible to found a finding on significant or wholly circumstantial evidence. In circumstantial cases, well- established principles apply in the human rights context: # Once a prima facie case of discrimination has been established, the burden shifts to the respondent to provide a rational explanation which is not discriminatory. # It is not sufficient to rebut an inference of discrimination that the respondent is able to suggest just any rational alternative explanation; the respondent must offer an explanation which is credible on all the evidence. # A complainant is not required to establish that the respondent's actions lead to no other conclusion but that discrimination was the basis for the decision at issue in a given case. # There is no requirement that, the respondents' conduct, to be found discriminatory, must be consistent with the allegation of discrimination and inconsistent with any other rational explanation. # The ultimate issue is whether an inference of discrimination is more probable from the evidence than the actual explanations offered by the respondent.  Notable rulings and case law  Due to restructuring in 2008, all applications made after June 30, 2008 are filed with the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal; prior to that date, applications were filed with and heard by the Ontario Human Rights Commission. = Public services, goods, facilities = The Ontario Human Rights Code provides that \\"[e]very person has a right to equal treatment with respect to services, goods and facilities, without discrimination because of race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, marital status, family status or disability.\\"Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990, c.

Racial profiling and discrimination  Nassiah v Peel (Regional Municipality) Services Board (2007) Ms. Nassiah filed an application under the Ontario Human Rights Code alleging that she had been discriminated against in respect of services because of her race with regard to a police investigation into an allegation of shoplifting. The investigating officer was found to have discriminated against Ms. Nassiah when he asked if she spoke English on the basis of her skin colour, used an offensive and profane term to refer to her and threatened to take her to jail, and engaged in a prolonged and heightened investigation whereby Ms. Nassiah was treated with a greater degree of hostility and investigation because she is black, which constituted racial profiling. The Commission wrote: \\"Racial profiling is a form of racial discrimination. There is nothing novel in finding that racial profiling is contrary to the Human Rights Code... It is and always has been contrary to the Code for the police to treat persons differently in any aspect of the police process, because of their race, even if race is only one factor in the differential treatment. What is new (in the last two decades) is the mounting evidence that this form of racial discrimination is not the result of isolated acts of individual \\"bad apples\\" but part of a systemic bias in many police forces. What is also new is the increasing acceptance by the Courts in Canada that racial profiling by police occurs in Canada and the willingness to scrutinize seemingly \\"neutral\\" police behaviour to assess whether it falls within the phenomenon of racial profiling.\\"Nassiah v Peel (Regional Municipality) Services Board, 2007 HRTO 14 at paras 112-113, HR-0954-05 (CanLII).[1] Retrieved 2017-02-08 The Commission cited a significant amount of jurisprudence and academic studies, as well as expert evidence, on the subject of racial profiling upon which it was concluded that racial profiling does in fact exist and does occur in Canada. And it was found that there was a pattern of evidence supporting a higher level of scrutiny and racial profiling in this case. In addition to the systemic remedies ordered to address issues in police training, Ms. Nassiah was awarded $20,000 for general damages and mental anguish.Nassiah v Peel (Regional Municipality) Services Board, 2007 HRTO 14 at paras 100, 107-109, 114-129, 166 184, 212 (CanLII).[1] Retrieved 2017-02-08.

Mr. Phipps filed an application under the Ontario Human Rights Code alleging that he had been discriminated against in respect of services because of his race with regard to an incident with police in 2005. Mr. Phipps was employed by Canada Post and was delivering mail in an affluent neighbourhood. He was wearing his uniform jacket, carrying his mail satchel, and delivering regular mail and flyers. He was stopped by police and had his identity checked, the police then proceeded to trail him and check his identity with a homeowner and a white letter carrier. The police did not check the identity or find suspicious any of the other unfamiliar people in the area, all of whom were white. Applying Nassiah v Peel and other jurisprudence, the Tribunal found that this was a clear case of discrimination, specifically racial profiling.Phipps v Toronto Police Services Board, 2009 HRTO 877 at paras 1-19, T-0475-08 (CanLII).

In June 2007, Sharon Abbott, a newspaper carrier, filed an application under the Ontario Human Rights Code alleging that she had been discriminated against in respect of services because of her race and sex contrary to the Code, with respect to an incident with police that resulted in her arrest. None of the charges upon which she had been arrested resulted in a conviction when she went before a Justice of the Peace. The Tribunal noted that \\"as in many cases alleging racial discrimination, there is no direct evidence that the complainant’s race or colour was a factor in the incident at issue. As a result, the issue of whether the respondents’ actions amount to racial discrimination in violation of the Code falls to be determined in accordance with the well-established principles applicable to circumstantial evidence cases. In the instant case, as in many circumstantial evidence cases, the determination comes down to whether an inference of racial and/or gender discrimination is more probable than the respondents’ explanation\\".Sharon Abbott v Toronto Police Services Board, 2009 HRTO 1909 at para 31, T-0406-08 (CanLII).[1] Retrieved 2017-02-08. The Tribunal found that the applicant's race and/or gender played a role in the officer's failure to take steps to try and de-escalate the situation. They recognized that there is an inherent exercise of power and power imbalance in an interaction between a police officer and the public, and that this may be inappropriately exacerbated when it is combined with a racial and/or gender power dynamic. The Tribunal cited a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada, which recognized that racial discrimination most often does not operate on a conscious basis, but rather emanates from unconscious attitudes and belief systems.R v S (RD), [1997] 3 SCR 484, 1997 CanLII 324 (SCC). In a historical context, some of these attitudes and belief systems include the fact that black persons (and other groups) are expected to \\"know their place\\" and that any black person who talks back or refuses to comply is to be regarded as \\"uppity\\" and needs to be dealt with harshly.

The applicant raised a complaint about human rights issues with a member of the management of his company. Specifically, he felt that he was being mistreated on the basis of his race, by being disproportionately required to perform menial tasks. These complaints were never investigated, never followed up on, and his employment was terminated a month after he made the complaint, allegedly for cause. The company claimed he was fired for spreading false information. However, at no point did anyone ever speak to the applicant to provide him with an opportunity to address the allegations or instruct him to stop, allegedly, spreading the misinformation. The Tribunal found that there was absolutely no evidence to support that the applicant was terminated for this reason and that the respondents had decided to terminate him rather than address his human rights complaint.Morgan v Herman Miller Canada Inc, 2013 HRTO 650 at paras 98-108, 2010-05530-I (CanLII) Therefore, although Mr. Morgan did not have a claim for discrimination, as there was no evidence to support that the company was in fact treating him in a discriminatory manner, the Tribunal found that he did have a claim for reprisal as he was terminated in response to making a human rights complaint, which his employer was obliged to investigate.

Maclean's magazine was accused of publishing eighteen Islamophobic articles between January 2005 and July 2007. The articles in question included a column by Mark Steyn titled \\"The Future Belongs to Islam\\". In April 2008, the OHRC ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the complaint based on the fact that the claim was alleging that the content of the magazine, not the magazine's refusal to provide space for a rebuttal, violated their rights, and the Ontario Human Rights Code does not give the Commission jurisdiction to deal with the content of magazine articles. However, the statement released by the Commission did raise concerns about the article and the need for discussion and a comprehensive approach to the issue of freedom of expression in the context of human rights. In a subsequent interview with the National Post, Chief Commissioner Barbara Hall stated that \\"When the media writes, it should exercise great caution that it's not promoting stereotypes that will adversely impact on identifiable groups. I think one needs to be very careful when one speaks in generalities, that in fact one is speaking factually about all the people in a particular group.\\" In response, the editors of Maclean's denounced Commissioner Hall and her staff for what they called the \\"zealous condemnation of their journalism\\" and stated that in her press release \\"[Hall] cited no evidence, considered no counter-arguments, and appointed herself prosecutor, judge and jury in one fell swoop.\\" Maclean's accused every human rights commission in the country for \\"morphing out of their conciliatory roles to become crusaders working to reshape journalistic discourse in Canada.\\" Mark Steyn, who wrote the article in Maclean's that the complaint was based on, also sharply criticized Hall and the OHRC, commenting that \\"Even though they (the OHRC) don't have the guts to hear the case, they might as well find us guilty.\\" = Abuse of process and costs = Lisa MacDonald v Downtown Health Club for Women (2009)Lisa MacDonald v Downtown Health Club for Women, 2009 HRTO 1647, T-0499-08 (CanLII).[1] Retrieved 2017-02-08.

It runs in a north–south direction from a dead end south of Montegut to a junction with LA 24 in Klondyke. The route travels alongside Bayou Terrebonne, connecting Montegut with the community of Bourg, which is located just beyond Klondyke. LA 24 continues the route into Houma, the parish seat and nearest city. It also connects LA 55 to LA 1 at Larose, located on Bayou Lafourche. LA 55 is known locally as Montegut Road. Route description From the south, LA 55 begins at a dead end on the east bank of Bayou Terrebonne at a point south of Montegut. It heads northward along the bayou on a narrow strip of land within the marshes of lower Terrebonne Parish, passing a series of elevated boat houses. After , LA 55 passes through Point Barre as more traditional residences begin to line the roadway. Soon afterward, LA 55 crosses a vertical lift bridge over the Humble Canal and enters the community of Montegut. later, the area transitions to a closely built residential neighborhood. LA 55 continues northward through town and intersects LA 58 (Sarah Road), which heads west across Bayou Terrebonne and connects to LA 56 north of Chauvin. At the northern limit of Montegut is an area known as Pointe-Aux-Chenes. Here, LA 55 intersects LA 665, which heads to the southeast along Bayou Pointe-Aux-Chenes. The highway then bends to the northwest with Bayou Terrebonne and continues for a final to an area known as Klondyke, just southeast of Bourg. The route ends at an intersection with LA 24, which continues northwest along the bayou toward Houma and east to Larose via the Bourg-Larose Highway. On the southwest, a locally-maintained vertical lift bridge connects to Klondyke Road on the opposite side of the bayou. LA 55 is classified by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD) as a rural minor collector south of Montegut, an urban collector in Montegut north to LA 58, and an urban minor arterial from LA 58 to the northern terminus. Average daily traffic volume in 2013 is reported as 340 vehicles at the southern end, increasing to 4,000 as the highway reaches the populated portion of Montegut, and increasing again to 5,100 north of LA 58. The posted speed limit is generally , briefly reduced to through the center of Montegut. LA 55 is an undivided, two-lane highway for its entire length. History =Pre-1955 route numbering= In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern LA 55 was part of two separate state highways, State Route 81 and State Route 69. State Route 81 followed the current route of LA 55 from the southern terminus through the community of Montegut. Route 81 was designated in 1921 by an act of the state legislature, which defined the first 98 routes of the original state highway system. The highway was originally projected to extend further south to a point on Bayou Terrebonne near Bay La Fleur off Lake Barre. However, it was never constructed south of the Madison Canal at this time, and the route remained the same up to the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering. State Route 69 picked up the route of the modern LA 55 from Montegut to the northern terminus at Klondyke. Like Route 81, it was created in 1921 as one of the original 98 state highways. After reaching Klondyke, Route 69 continued along the present LA 24 corridor through Houma to Schriever. It then continued along the present LA 20 corridor to Thibodaux in neighboring Lafourche Parish. Route 69 also remained in effect until the 1955 renumbering. =Post-1955 route history= LA 55 was created with the 1955 renumbering, following the entirety of former State Route 81 as well as the portion of former State Route 69 to Klondyke, just southeast of Bourg. The route has remained largely the same to the present day, with the exception of a short extension on the southern end. Since its designation, the roadway has been extended across the Madison Canal about further south than the original southern terminus. Future La DOTD is currently engaged in a program that aims to transfer about of state-owned roadways to local governments over the next several years. Under this plan of \\"right-sizing\\" the state highway system, the entire portion of LA 55 south of LA 58 is proposed for deletion as it does not meet a significant interurban travel function.

Newman (October 18, 1887 – April 8, 1986) was an American labor activist. She is best remembered as the first female general organizer of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) and for six decades of work as the education director of the ILGWU Health Center. Biography =Early years= Pauline M. Newman was born in Kaunas, in present-day Lithuania, in the early 1890s. She was the youngest of four children. Her father was a teacher and her mother sold produce in the local market.Orleck, Annelise. Common Sense and a Little Fire: Women and Working-Class Politics in the United States, 1900-1965. University of North Carolina Press. 1995. . Newman fought for her early education. The local public school refused Jews, and Jewish schools refused women. She convinced her father to let her sit in on his classes. She learned to read and write in Hebrew and Yiddish. She also challenged the custom of dividing the congregation along gender lines.Orleck, Annelise. \\"Pauline Newman.\\" Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia. 20 March 2009. Jewish Women's Archive. April 17, 2010. Following the death of her father, Newman, her mother and sisters moved to New York City where her older brother had settled. At age nine, Newman went to work in a brush factory. At 11 she took a job at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory.Orleck, Annelise. Chapter 7: Pauline Newman: Immigration, Jewish Radicalism, and Gender. In Arnesen, Eric. The Human Tradition in American labor History. Scholarly Resources Inc. pp. 107-127. 2004. . Disturbed by the miserable conditions, Newman was drawn to the Socialist Party through the popular Yiddish newspaper The Jewish Daily Forward. At age fifteen, she joined a Socialist Literary Society, and organized after-work study groups at the Triangle factory. These became the basis for the women's unions she would soon organize. =Initial labor activism= In 1907, with New York City in the grip of a depression and thousands facing eviction, the twenty-year-old Newman took a group of \\"self-supporting women\\" to camp for the summer on the Palisades above the Hudson River. There, they planned an assault on the \\"high cost of living\\". In 1908, on New Year's Day, Newman and her band led a rent strike involving 10,000 families in lower Manhattan. These families refused to pay their rent and this strike became the largest rent strike New York City had ever seen, and it triggered decades of tenant activism, which eventually led to the establishment of rent controls. As the leader of the strike, Newman received a great deal of attention and was dubbed by New York Times as the East Side Joan of Arc. Soon after, at the age of twenty-one, Newman won the New York State Socialist Party nomination for secretary of state. Women did not yet have the vote in New York, but Newman used her 1908 campaign as an opportunity to stump for woman suffrage. She believed that women workers needed the political power of the ballot to back up the economic power they had won by joining unions. Using the two together, they would help the working class achieve economic freedom. Newman's campaigns for the vote were always conducted in the context of organizing women workers. For two years after the great rent strike, Newman and other garment workers went shop to shop in Lower Manhattan organizing young women who were growing increasingly discontented with the working conditions such as speedups in the production rate, being charged for thread and electricity, and with having their pay docked whenever they made mistakes. On November 22, 1909, Newman began organizing and preparing for a general strike. In weeks and months that followed, more than 40,000 young women workers in New York left their sewing machines and refused to work. This would be the largest strike created and organized by American women up to that time, and Pauline Newman was a whirlwind at its core. Newman met with some of the city's most powerful and wealthy women, explaining the horrific conditions under which shirtwaist dresses were manufactured. She won the sympathy of many of New York's wealthiest and their mere presence dramatically cut down police brutality against the strikers. =ILGWU organizer= In recognition of her central role in organizing and sustaining the strike, Newman was appointed as the first woman general organizer for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU). From 1909 to 1913, she organized garment strikes around the country, organizing in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Boston, and Kalamazoo, Michigan. In addition, she stumped for the Socialist Party of America in the freezing, bleak coal-mining camps of southern Illinois and continued to campaign for woman suffrage for the Women's Trade Union League. Although, waves of successful strikes were happening all around the United States, it was a lonely and frustrating few years for Newman. She felt that the union leadership had little interest in organizing women and that her work was undervalued and undermined at every turn. Her anger, fears, and doubts sank her into a deep depression following the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of March 25, 1911. A total of 146 young workers lost their lives during the tragedy, most of them immigrant Jews and Italians. Newman, who had worked at the factory for seven years, was friends of many of the victims. Soon after, New York State established the Factory Investigation Commission (FIC). An investigative body with real powers of enforcement, the FIC brought government into the shops to guarantee worker safety. Newman was offered a post as one of the FIC's first inspectors and she gladly accepted. Through this job, she met Frances Perkins, who would later become Franklin Roosevelt's secretary of labor and the first woman to serve in the cabinet post. Newman and Perkins worked together to improve working conditions. Perkins and Newman took state legislators on tours of the worst factories in the state and through this, Newman gained the respect of these political figures, who would call on her for advice or consultation many times over the next half century. Her years on the FIC marked the beginning of a new career path for Newman that would end her days as a street-level organizer. As a result of her ability to speak with equal effectiveness to workers, governmental officials, labor leaders, and educated women reformers, Newman had become a liaison between the labor movement and government. Newman's life was forever changed by her entry into the world of lobbying and legislative politics. In 1917, the Women's Trade Union League dispatched Newman to Philadelphia, to build a new branch of the league. There she met a young Bryn Mawr economics instructor named Frieda S. Miller. Miller, who was chafing at the constraints of academic life, gladly left academia to help Newman with her organizing. Within the year, the two were living together. It was the beginning of a turbulent but mutually satisfying relationship that would last until Miller's death in 1974. In 1923, the two women moved to New York's Greenwich Village, where they raised Miller's daughter together. Though lesbian families were not openly discussed in the 1920s, their family seems to have been accepted by government and union friends and colleagues. =ILGWU Health Center Education Director= In 1923, Newman became the educational director for the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union Health Center. This center was the first comprehensive medical program created by a union for its members. Newman would carry out that position for sixty years, using it to promote worker health care, adult education, and greater visibility for women in the union. She quickly became a beloved and highly respected mentor to young women in the union. In addition, she promoted the cause of women in trade unions through her positions as vice president of the New York and National Women's Trade Union Leagues. From the late 1920s on, Newman worked for and helped to shape government agencies charged with the task of improving working conditions for women workers. She negotiated state minimum wage and factory safety codes during the 1930s and 1940s that exceeded federal standards. She also served on the U.S. Women's Bureau Labor Advisor Board, the United Nations Subcommittee on the Status of Women, and the International Labor Organization Subcommittee on the Status of Domestic Laborers. Newman's access to the federal government had come first through her connection to Eleanor Roosevelt. Newman and Miller were part of the circle of women who surrounded Eleanor Roosevelt in the 1920s and 1930s. They were both regular guests at Val-Kill, the cottage that Franklin Roosevelt built for Eleanor Roosevelt near the family mansion at Hyde Park. During the mid-1930s, Newman visited the White House regularly. In 1936, she received national news coverage when Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt invited her and a group of young women garment and textile workers to stay as guests for a week at the White House. Newman also made a point of reaching out to ethnic constituencies who had been ignored or shut out of trade unions. She worked to bring African American women as well as Mexican American women into previously all-white labor unions. =Post-World War II years= After World War II, Newman and Miller were commissioned by the U.S. Departments of State and Labor to investigate postwar factory conditions in Germany. During the Truman years, Newman addressed the White House Conference on child labor and served as a regular consultant to the U.S. Public Health Service on matters of child labor and industrial hygiene. Newman continued to work for the ILGWU until 1983. Mentorship was Newman's major contributions to the women's labor struggle in the later years of her career. Writing, lecturing, and advising younger women organizers, Newman educated and prepared them for the future. Moreover, during her seventy-plus years with the union, she waged a constant struggle to convince male leaders to acknowledge the needs and talents of women workers. With the revival of the feminist movement in the 1970s, the elderly Newman came to be seen as a feminist hero. In 1974, the Coalition of Labor Union Women honored her as a foremother of the women's liberation movement. In addition, she spoke regularly to historians and reporters and to groups of young women workers, her heavily wrinkled face telling as much as her words about her decades of struggle on behalf of the labor movement. Newman's regular writings also serve as a valuable resource for scholars of women and trade unionism. =Death and legacy= Pauline Newman died on April 8, 1986 at the New York City home of her adopted daughter, Elisabeth Burger. She was 98 years old at the time of her death. Newman's death aroused grief and sadness among the ILGWU and women trade unionists. She had created a space for herself as a negotiator- standing with one foot in the male-dominated labor movement and one foot in the cross-class world of women reformers. She influenced many people during her time. Her contributions as an organizer, a legislative expert, a writer, and a mentor to younger women activists were significant and wide-ranging.

Behrens has received commissions from Adele Marcus, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Ontario Arts Council, and Orchestra London among others. In 1965 the Canada Council commissioned his chamber opera The Lay of Thrym (libretto by C.K. Cockburn) as part of their research program on Viking literature, art, and music in Scandinavian countries. The four-scene opera is based on an Icelandic legend and employs atonality and aleatoric and improvisational techniques. The world premiere of the opera was given at Darke Hall on 13 April 1968 under the baton of the composer. Behrens is the subject of international research by flautist Rebecca Hall, of the University of Malta, and Karin Di Bella of Brock University in Ontario. In January 2019, Di Bella was quoted as saying \\"What’s interesting about Jack’s pieces is that even though they’re more modern in style, they’re still really accessible.\\" External links References Category:Living people Category:1935 births Category:Aspen Music Festival and School alumni Category:California State University faculty Category:Canadian classical composers Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Juilliard School alumni Category:Canadian music educators Category:American opera composers Category:Male opera composers Category:Simon Fraser University faculty Category:University of Saskatchewan faculty Category:University of Western Ontario faculty Category:American male classical composers Category:American classical composers Category:American music educators Category:American emigrants to Canada Category:Pupils of Darius Milhaud Category:Pupils of Roger Sessions ","title":"Jack Behrens"},{"id":"27073063","text":"Allan Douglas Hawke, (born 18 February 1948) is a former Australian senior public servant and diplomat.

The organization is a no-kill shelter committed to rescuing stray and abandoned animals and facilitating adoptions. Animals that are not adopted may remain at the kennel indefinitely without consequence.Lange Foundation Official Website Cheakalos, Christina. A Higher Purr-pose. People, Vol. 55 No. 20, May 21, 2001. Founder Gillian Lange is a recipient of the City of Los Angeles St. Francis of Assisi Award in recognition of her work on behalf of abandoned and neglected animals since 1974. To date, she has helped rescue and place over 20,000 cats and dogs that would have otherwise been destroyed in shelters. The staff at the Lange Foundation have spent the majority of their lives working with animals in a rescue or veterinary setting. The animals at Lange Foundation are housed in open enclosures, with room to walk, stretch, jump, and play. The cat enclosures include an FIV enclosure for cats that test positive for the virus, a \\"Weight Watchers\\" room for overweight cats, and a \\"Teenville\\" room for young cats and kittens. There is also an isolation area for newly acquired animals and a kitchen area where sick and injured animals are housed while they recover. Every animal at Lange Foundation is given a name, microchipped, vaccinated, and sterilized. If an animal is not yet sterilized at the time of adoption, the organization requires proof of sterilization from the adopter at a later date. Funding is provided for those who cannot afford the procedure. The foundation's ultimate goal is to eliminate the need for animal rescue shelters like itself through sterilization. To further this aim, Lange Foundation supports the trap–neuter–return policy, an effort to reduce the number of feral cats in LA county through sterilization.About Us at langefoundation.com Kennel policies A cat that was adopted from Lange Foundation. =Kennel Hours= The West Los Angeles kennel is open to the public 7 days a week, from 11 am to 5 pm.About Us at langefoundation.com =Adopting= Visitors must be 16 years of age to enter the kennel and 21 years old to adopt a pet.

Adoptors must reside in LA county.Cat Adoption at langefoundation.com Courtesy listings In addition to the animals up for adoption at Lange foundation, the foundation's website features adoptable animals from other shelters or individuals. These animals are not affiliated with Lange Foundation but are in need of a home nonetheless.Courtesy Pets at langefoundation.com =Fostering= The kennel is often in need of foster homes for animals that do not thrive in a shelter environment and have not yet been adopted. Candidates for foster care include animals that require a special diet due to illnesses like diabetes, FIV+ cats, kittens that must be bottle fed, and old or injured animals that need special attention. Foster care be short-term or long-term, depending on the animal's particular situation.Fostering at langefoundation.com =Volunteering= Lange foundation gladly accepts volunteers aged 16 and up.

Description (Original description by W.H. Dall) The height of the shell attains 6.2 mm. This a rather rare shell. The small, yellowish white, planorboid shell has a wide umbilicus. The shell consists of about four whorls, including a minute smooth nucleus. The whorls are rounded, barely touching, not constantly contiguous but normally enrolled. The spiral sculpture consists of on the upper side six, on the periphery four, and on the base six rounded threads. The peripheral threads are rather larger than the others, all with narrower interspaces. The axial sculpture comprises first, fine elevated lamellae covering the whole shell evenly and giving it a slightly spongy aspect; secondly, on the body whorl, about ten elevations, not perceptibly continuous over the top of the shell but prominent, over the periphery and reflected backward like incomplete varices. The outer whorl is coiled over these so that the whorl inside only touches the outer one by these prominences. They are not continuous over the base, but within the ample umbilicus are two rows of small prominences corresponding in number to those on the periphery. The circular aperture has a complete circular varix which is radiately crenulated. The apex is sunk below the top of the body whorl. The shell has a thick, rounded lip.Dall W. H. 1889.

Description (Original description by Bush) The shell grows to a length of 3.2 mm. The small shell is opaque white, under a golden brown epidermis. It contains few convex whorls (the tip is broken away) forming a well-elevated spire and large body whorl. The surface is lustrous where rubbed, ornamented with a single conspicuous carina which defines a broad, flattened sutural area and makes the whorls slightly angulated. This is roughened by the crossing of the growth lines, which are elsewhere inconspicuous. On the base surrounding the umbilicus there are also four more prominent carina, about equal in size and evenly separated by wide, slightly concave interspaces. The first one is situated about the middle of the base, and the last one well up in the umbilicus. On all of these, the lines of growth are so conspicuous as to give them a distinctly beaded appearance. At their termination they form distinct points on the somewhat expanded thin edge of the peristome. The aperture within is dull, opaque white, with a narrow, much thinner, semi-transparent, somewhat expanded, sharp-edged border. This gives the appearance of thickening, but there is no raised opaque white line, said by some author to be the distinguishing character of Moelleria.Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, vol. 10, 1899–1900 Distribution This species is distributed in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean.

In the first description of the algorithm,Grady, L.: \\"Random walks for image segmentation\\". PAMI, 2006 a user interactively labels a small number of pixels with known labels (called seeds), e.g., \\"object\\" and \\"background\\". The unlabeled pixels are each imagined to release a random walker, and the probability is computed that each pixel's random walker first arrives at a seed bearing each label, i.e., if a user places K seeds, each with a different label, then it is necessary to compute, for each pixel, the probability that a random walker leaving the pixel will first arrive at each seed. These probabilities may be determined analytically by solving a system of linear equations. After computing these probabilities for each pixel, the pixel is assigned to the label for which it is most likely to send a random walker. The image is modeled as a graph, in which each pixel corresponds to a node which is connected to neighboring pixels by edges, and the edges are weighted to reflect the similarity between the pixels. Therefore, the random walk occurs on the weighted graph (see Doyle and Snell for an introduction to random walks on graphsP. Doyle, J. L. Snell: Random Walks and Electric Networks, Mathematical Association of America, 1984). Although the initial algorithm was formulated as an interactive method for image segmentation, it has been extended to be a fully automatic algorithm, given a data fidelity term (e.g., an intensity prior).Leo Grady: \\"Multilabel Random Walker Image Segmentation Using Prior Models\\", Proc. of CVPR, Vol. 1, pp. 763–770, 2005. It has also been extended to other applications. The algorithm was initially published by Leo Grady as a conference paperLeo Grady, Gareth Funka-Lea: Multi-Label Image Segmentation for Medical Applications Based on Graph-Theoretic Electrical Potentials, Proc. of the 8th ECCV Workshop on Computer Vision Approaches to Medical Image Analysis and Mathematical Methods in Biomedical Image Analysis, pp. 230–245, 2004. and later as a journal paper. Mathematics Although the algorithm was described in terms of random walks, the probability that each node sends a random walker to the seeds may be calculated analytically by solving a sparse, positive-definite system of linear equations with the graph Laplacian matrix, which we may represent with the variable L. The algorithm was shown to apply to an arbitrary number of labels (objects), but the exposition here is in terms of two labels (for simplicity of exposition). Assume that the image is represented by a graph, with each node v_i associated with a pixel and each edge e_{ij} connecting neighboring pixels v_i and v_j. The edge weights are used to encode node similarity, which may be derived from differences in image intensity, color, texture or any other meaningful features. For example, using image intensity g_i at node v_i, it is common to use the edge weighting function :w_{ij} = \\\\exp{\\\\left(-\\\\beta (g_i - g_j)^2\\\\right)}. The nodes, edges and weights can then be used to construct the graph Laplacian matrix. The random walker algorithm optimizes the energy :Q(x) = x^T L x = \\\\sum_{e_{ij}} w_{ij} \\\\left(x_i - x_j\\\\right)^2 where x_i represents a real-valued variable associated with each node in the graph and the optimization is constrained by x_i = 1 for v_i \\\\in F and x_i = 0 for v_i \\\\in B, where F and B represent the sets of foreground and background seeds, respectively. If we let S represent the set of nodes which are seeded (i.e., S = F \\\\cup B) and \\\\overline{S} represent the set of unseeded nodes (i.e., S \\\\cup \\\\overline{S} = V where V is the set of all nodes), then the optimum of the energy minimization problem is given by the solution to : L_{\\\\overline{S},\\\\overline{S}} x_{\\\\overline{S}} = - L_{\\\\overline{S},S} x_{S}, where the subscripts are used to indicate the portion of the graph Laplacian matrix L indexed by the respective sets. To incorporate likelihood (unary) terms into the algorithm, it was shown in that one may optimize the energy :Q(x) = x^T L x + \\\\gamma \\\\left((1-x)^T F (1-x) + x^T B x\\\\right) = \\\\sum_{e_{ij}} w_{ij} \\\\left(x_i - x_j\\\\right)^2 + \\\\gamma \\\\left(\\\\sum_{v_i} f_i (1-x_i)^2 + \\\\sum_{v_i} b_i x_i^2 \\\\right), for positive, diagonal matrices F and B. Optimizing this energy leads to the system of linear equations : \\\\left(L_{\\\\overline{S},\\\\overline{S}} + \\\\gamma F_{\\\\overline{S},\\\\overline{S}} + \\\\gamma B_{\\\\overline{S},\\\\overline{S}}\\\\right) x_{\\\\overline{S}} = - L_{\\\\overline{S},S} x_{S} - \\\\gamma F_{\\\\overline{S},\\\\overline{S}}. The set of seeded nodes, S, may be empty in this case (i.e., \\\\overline{S}=V), but the presence of the positive diagonal matrices allows for a unique solution to this linear system. For example, if the likelihood/unary terms are used to incorporate a color model of the object, then f_i would represent the confidence that the color at node v_i would belong to object (i.e., a larger value of f_i indicates greater confidence that v_i belonged to the object label) and b_i would represent the confidence that the color at node v_i belongs to the background. Algorithm interpretations The random walker algorithm was initially motivated by labelling a pixel as object/background based on the probability that a random walker dropped at the pixel would first reach an object (foreground) seed or a background seed. However, there are several other interpretations of this same algorithm which have appeared in. =Circuit theory interpretations= There are well-known connections between electrical circuit theory and random walks on graphs.P. G. Doyle, J. L. Snell: Random Walks and Electrical Networks, Carus Mathematical Monographs, 1984 Consequently, the random walker algorithm has two different interpretations in terms of an electric circuit. In both cases, the graph is viewed as an electric circuit in which each edge is replaced by a passive linear resistor. The resistance, r_{ij}, associated with edge e_{ij} is set equal to r_{ij} = \\\\frac{1}{w_{ij}} (i.e., the edge weight equals electrical conductance). In the first interpretation, each node associated with a background seed, v_i \\\\in B, is tied directly to ground while each node associated with an object/foreground seed, v_i \\\\in F is attached to a unit direct current ideal voltage source tied to ground (i.e., to establish a unit potential at each v_i \\\\in F). The steady-state electrical circuit potentials established at each node by this circuit configuration will exactly equal the random walker probabilities. Specifically, the electrical potential, x_i at node v_i will equal the probability that a random walker dropped at node v_i will reach an object/foreground node before reaching a background node. In the second interpretation, labeling a node as object or background by thresholding the random walker probability at 0.5 is equivalent to labeling a node as object or background based on the relative effective conductance between the node and the object or background seeds. Specifically, if a node has a higher effective conductance (lower effective resistance) to the object seeds than to the background seeds, then node is labeled as object. If a node has a higher effective conductance (lower effective resistance) to the background seeds than to the object seeds, then node is labeled as background.

Chinatowns exist in most Australian states and territories, especially in the highly-populous and cosmopolitan capital cities but also in rural areas. Many large present-day Chinatowns in Australia have developed out of smaller historical Chinese settlements in Australia dating back to the 19th century. Chinese people first immigrated to Australia in large waves in the midst of the Australian gold rushes (beginning during the 1850s). Many of these people subsequently chose to return to China or were forcefully deported from Australia. The first known Chinese Australian was John Shying, who immigrated to Australia in 1818. Australia has seen significant waves of Chinese and Overseas Chinese immigration for several decades since the 1970s, which was roughly when the White Australia policy (a white nationalist Australian ethnic policy that heavily restricted Asian immigration from 1901 until 1973) was completely dismantled. Australia is a popular destination for Chinese emigrants because of its high standards of living and relatively close geographic proximity to China, as well as because the Chinese Australian community is already well- established. The Chinese government, Chinese companies, and Chinese organisations also have strong interests in Australia and can provide an extensive support network for Chinese immigrants to Australia. Because China (PRC) restricted emigration up until 1983, prior to this year, most Chinese people came to Australia from Hong Kong (then a British colony, now a Chinese SAR), either as native Hongkongers or as Mainland Chinese passing through Hong Kong. Up until 1983, the largest Mainland Chinese immigrant community in Australia has consistently been the Cantonese Australian community, originating from Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province; both Guangzhou and Guangdong are commonly known as \\"Canton\\" in the English language. Most people in Hong Kong are descended from Guangzhou City (whether recently or distantly) and identify as Cantonese. Cantonese people living overseas are most easily recognisable by their usage of the Cantonese language, which belongs to the Chinese (Sinitic) language family. In the present day, the collective Chinese Australian community consists of Chinese people originating from a variety of countries. The largest community of Chinese people in Australia is the Mainland Chinese, largely due to the fact that many Mainland Chinese have been temporarily living in Australia throughout the past few decades in order to attend Australian universities. In Australian censuses, Hong Kong-born, Macau- born, and Taiwan-born people are recorded separately; Hong Kongese and Taiwanese people constitute some significant ethnic Chinese communities in Australia. There are also many Overseas Chinese people in Australia, mostly from Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Australian Capital Territory Woolley Street in Dickson at night, seen sometimes as Canberra's 'Chinatown' A contemporary Chinatown exists at Woolley Street in the Dickson Centre, Australian Capital Territory. The Chinatown has become established fairly recently as a restaurant precinct. New South Wales =Sydney= Sydney's Chinatown. Sydney's Chinatown is the third area to bear that name. Originally in The Rocks area of Sydney, it later moved to the area near Market Street at Darling Harbour and finally to its current location in Haymarket, around parallel streets Dixon Street and Sussex Street. This Chinatown hosts various Chinese cultural activities such as the Chinese Youth League of Australia 澳洲侨青社 Chinese Youth League of Australia and Catholic Mass in Cantonese at the St. Peter Julian's Catholic Church. St. Peter Julian's Catholic Church Other suburban Chinatowns have cropped up over the years in the suburbs of Burwood, Campsie, Ashfield, Auburn, Fairfield, Marrickville, Chatswood, Eastwood, Parramatta, Hurstville and Kingsford. =Newcastle= Hamilton’s Beaumont Street temporarily turns into a Chinatown for a week for Newcastle China Week, which starts yearly on 24 September. https://www.facebook.com/events/beaumont-st-hamilton- nsw-2303-australia/newcastle-china-week-street-festival-beaumont-st- hamilton/231194380829612/ Although no permanent ones exist in the large city, many Asian supermarkets and restaurants are found around the area and the Hunter Region. Plus, a large ethnic cluster of Chinese immigrants and citizens live in the city. Victoria =Ballarat= An extensive historical Chinatown existed in Golden Point, Victoria, a district of the city of the gold field city Ballarat While the settlement no longer exists, it is remembered at nearby Sovereign Hill. =Bendigo= Chinese precinct entrance at Bendigo Several Chinatowns were established in Bendigo during the Victorian Gold Rush of the 1850s and 1860s. These were the Chinese camps, of which there were seven established.Jean Gittins.(1981). The Diggers From China: The Story of Chinese on the Goldfields. Quartet Books Australia. Melbourne. The Ironbark camp in North Bendigo became the most prominent in the 1850s and 1860s. It continued to be the centre of Chinese life in Bendigo until it was ravaged by fire for a second time in 1911. A Joss House, one of Victoria's oldest, is the only thing remaining on the site. After the fire at the Ironbark camp, those Chinese still in Bendigo moved their operations to Bridge St, nearer the centre of Bendigo. This Chinatown survived until 1964 when the council cited its declining use and dilapidated state as reasons for its demolition. A car park was put in its place. In 1991 the Bridge St Chinatown became the site of the Golden Dragon Museum which includes many relics from the city's Chinese heritage.McKinnon, Leigh. (2012). Loong Bendigo's Golden Dragon. The Golden Dragon Museum. . pg 32-40 =Castlemaine= A historic Chinatown existed in Castlemaine during the Victorian Gold Rush in the 1860s near the corner of Mostyn and Union Street (current site of the Albion Hotel) which included as many as five Joss Houses and a Chinese Mission Chapel. =Creswick= A historical Chinatown existed in Creswick during the Victorian Gold Rush in the 1850s.http://www.creswick.net/creswick_history The settlement was depicted in Watercolor paintings artists by Burkitt (1855) and Norman Lindsay (1894). =Melbourne= Melbourne Chinatown entrance at Little Bourke Street Melbourne's Chinatown is in Little Bourke Street. It is notable as the oldest Chinatown in Australia, the oldest continuous Chinese settlement in Australia, and the longest continuously running Chinatown outside of Asia. Suburban Chinese communities, of a mostly Cantonese culture, are in Doncaster, Box Hill, Springvale and Glen Waverley. Melbourne's Chinatown boasts some world-famous cuisine, Flower Drum for example was voted as one of the best Chinese restaurants in the world by the New York Times. It was also the location where the Dim Sim, a popular Chinese-Australian snackfood commonly served in takeaway outlets throughout the country, was first invented by William Wing Young, at his restaurant Wing Lee, in 1945. Gift shops and souvenir shops also make up a large proportion of businesses. Melbourne Chinatown also houses the world's longest annually paraded Chinese dragon in the Melbourne Chinese Museum. This record is believed to have been held by the city since 1978 when the original Dai Loong dragon was commissioned, which was also the first Chinese dragon built in China since 1948. It was 92 metres long, had 6160 scales on its body and was initially paraded with a procession involving over 200 participants. In 2003, it was replaced with a new dragon, the Millennium Dragon, which was deliberately crafted in order to retain the record, and required 8 people to hold its head up. This later dragon is also locally known as Dai Loong, as some parts of the original 1978 dragon were reconditioned for use in the new dragon. Queensland Bilingualism in suburban Fortitude Valley in Brisbane, Australia. Chinatown is located above ground. =Atherton= The Chinatown in Atherton is a heritage-listed settlement. It was built from 1880s to 1920s. It is also known as Cedar Camp. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register in 1992. =Brisbane= The Chinatown of Brisbane is located in the suburb of Fortitude Valley, complete with its own Chinese gateway. Located near the Story Bridge, Chinatown is very popular for Australians too. =Gold Coast= A Chinatown on the Gold Coast is proposed for Southport.Gold Coast Chinatown : precinct plan produced by Economic Development and Major Projects, City of Gold Coast; in partnership with Queensland Government, Chinatown Gold Coast. 2013 The proposed design includes three Peifang gates (arches) at each of the three entrances to Davenport and Young Streets. Chinatown Gold Coast The Chinatown precinct is an integral part of the revitalisation of Southport as an international CBD for the Gold Coast. Chinatown is being developed in partnership with the community, private sector and government. It will offer an authentic Asian experience and create a unique destination on the light rail corridor in the heart of the CBD. This modern Chinatown is focused on Young and Davenport Streets in Southport. It will be a place for the Gold Coast to celebrate its diversity through culture, design, people and food. Chinatown will be an exciting mix of restaurants, cultural festivals and boutique; a place of cultural indulgence and celebration. A statue of Confucius was unveiled and soon, three paifangs - traditional Chinese gateways - will mark the entries to the precinct. South Australia =Adelaide= Adelaide's China Town is located in the Adelaide Central Markets precinct, on Moonta Street, between Grote and Gouger streets. Two impressive Paifang mark the entrances at either end. Adelaide China Town consists mainly of oriental restaurants, grocery stores and markets. Northern Territory =Darwin= The first Chinatown in Darwin existed in the 1880s. A new synthetic Chinatown of Darwin, Northern Territory is in development and it is to be finished in 2010 at a cost of A$90 million. Western Australia =Broome= Broome. Some buildings date back prior to 1900. After Broome was established, a Chinatown area emerged as the town became home to a large Asian population in the late 19th century. =Perth= Perth has a Chinatown on Roe Street in the inner-city suburb of Northbridge. There are many more Asian businesses found on William St, Northbridge than at the official Chinatown. Historically many Chinese (usually of Malaysian, Singaporean or Indonesian background) settled in Northbridge alongside other immigrant groups. The city's low density population and comparatively cheap property encourages migrants to move to the expanding suburbs. Asian students often chose to live in suburbs near universities, such as Bentley, Murdoch and Nedlands.

The story is told in non-chronological order, alternating between Torres's post-9/11 experience of widowhood, pregnancy, media attention and bureaucratic nightmares; and backstory about her and her husband Eduardo (Eddie). Most of the images are drawn by Choi, but photos of Eddie also appear in two sections, as well as a photo of Alissa and her son. The story starts on September 11, 2001, with TV announcements about the attacks on the World Trade Center, where Eddie has just started a new job as a currency trader with Cantor Fitzgerald. Chapters 2 and 3 give the backstory from Alissa and Eddie's first meeting in August 1998 to Alissa's pregnancy and Eddie's new job at Cantor Fitzgerald. Chapter 4 depicts the night before the attacks and suggests conflict between them, although the nature of the conflict is not revealed. Then it depicts Alissa going downtown after the attacks to look for Eddie. Chapters 5 and 6 depict Alissa's continuing search for Eddie until she confirms his death, the funeral planning and her frustrations in dealing with the Red Cross and Cantor Fitzgerald for assistance and benefits. Alissa's son is born in chapter 7, and chapters 8 and 9 deal with the experience of being a 9/11 widowed mother, dealing with the press, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Salvation Army and the Red Cross; and gives more of Eddie's backstory, with him growing up in Columbia, showing him to be strong and a fighter, juxtaposing with how Alissa feels.

A largely self-taught composer, his compositional output includes both vocal and instrumental works such as songs, works for solo piano, choral works, and works for orchestra. Some his compositions were published by Adélard Joseph Boucher and Archambault Musique. His most well known work is his 1944 Messe brève de requiem. Life and career Born in Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures, Mignault received his earliest musical training from his mother who was an organist trained by Romain-Octave Pelletier I. In 1916 he began studying the piano with Alfred La Liberté. He briefly pursued studies at the Université de Montréal but dropped out to pursue private music studies with pianist Léo-Pol Morin and organists Eugène Lapierre and Émile Lambert. In the early 1920s Mignault held organist posts briefly at St-Alphonse d'Youville, St-Étienne, Ste-Cunégonde, Ste-Catherine, and St-Georges in Montreal. In 1924 he was appointed organist at St-Enfant- Jésus Church, a position he held through 1957. He also served as that church's choirmaster from 1944-1957. In 1937 he began working as an organist and pianist for CBC Radio, appearing on radio broadcasts periodically up into the 1950s. He notably succeeded Henri Letondal as artistic director of the CKAC radio program L'Heure provinciale from 1938-1940. In 1943 Mignault joined the music faculty of the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal where he taught solfège and musical dictation through 1961. He also taught voice and solfège for the Montreal Catholic School Board from 1944 to 1957. He died in Montreal in 1961 at the age of 65. His son André Mignault had a successful career as a cellist.

History\\"Pioneer Baptist Church Records of South-Central Kentucky and the Upper Cumberland of Tennessee 1799-1899\\" C.P. Cawthorn and N.L. Warnell pg 290-295 The Church at Good Spring was organized in the year 1842 on the third Saturday in February by Elders Jesse Moon, R.T. Gardner and William Skaggs with the following members: Brown Blair, Mary Blair, Isaac Blair, Lucy Blair, David Blair, Betsy Blair, J.L. Smith, Sarah Smith, Rachel Pace, William Skaggs, J.D. Sanders, Sally Sanders, Thomsas Meredith, Esaline Smith and Pega Davis. An entry made in the Beaver Dam Church Book in March 1842, lists some of the names that went to Good Spring from that church: \\"A petitioning letter from members... naimely (sic) Henry B. Blair and Mary (wife) and sister Rachel Pearce (sic) for letters of dismission which was granted for ministerial aid for the purpose of being constituted into a church to themselves for convenient sake for which is granted and sent to their aid Elder Jesse Moon... \\" The members of Good Spring, before it was formed, had to travel to Rhoda to attend church at Beaver Dam, or go to Nolin Baptist Church. Due to the distance and conditions of travel at that time they thought it expedient to form a church of their own. Aunt Susan Blair was born in the heart of the Forks in the middle of the decade preceding the Civil War and grew to young womanhood there. In a letter written to Charlie Whittle in 1931, she paints a picture of the conditions that existed around Good Spring Church in the olden days, \\"On Sunday we went to church were Good Spring Church now stands. The old house was built of logs and heated with a fire place. My father and the neighbors built it in 1842; and my father and mother were among the first members there. The first preacher I can remember was Uncle Billy Skaggs (William Skaggs). When they had a revival meeting, everybody came and stayed all day. Some would bring the dinner one day and others the next. There were no night services. Sometimes there would be more than the church house would hold; and then they held the service out under the trees. The older women wore homespun, yarn dresses and hats tied with a ribbon under their chins. I was fourteen years old before I had my first pair of dress shoes; and I had to carry them in my hand until I was nearly to the church and then sit down and put them on. When I started home, I had to pull them off and carry them, for they had to last me for three or four years, or until they were too small for me\\" Many of the charter members of this old church were descendants and-or the living existence of the pioneer Baptists who settled Green County and associated with the Brush Creek Church and settlement. Elder William Skaggs married first Lindsey Meredith, a daughter of Joseph Meredith, Sr., who was traveling from Green County. Joseph was the father of Thomas Meredith, a charter member of Good Spring Church. The Sanders family also came from Brush Creek area of Green County at an early date. The Blairs came to Edmonson County from the Cumberland River area of Tennessee. Good Spring Church was a flourishing and a prosperous church until the Government ambushed to the establishment of Mammoth Cave National Park. The church property was acquired by the National Park Service and the church dissolved. The building is yet standing and each year descendants of the pioneers who worshipped there return for their yearly home-coming and dinner on the grounds of what used to be. Good Spring Church had the largest membership of any church in the Green River Association from 1896 to 1900. In the times of 1842 it was built and kicked off the cave's history of a continuous offering with a beautiful view for not just the fact of the matter but it became open to the public and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places NRHP in 1991.

The five, shouldered whorls are angulated and carinated below the middle, swollen just below the suture, which lies in a deep channel. They are crossed, above the peripheral carina by numerous elevated, thin, oblique ribs, which rise into lamellas near the suture, where they join the carina forming small nodules. Between the ribs are fine parallel lines of growth and sometimes a few fine revolving lines. Below the periphery, in line with the posterior edge of the lip, there is a smaller, plain, angular rib, and around the umbilicus there is a strong nodulose rib. Between these ribs, the base is covered with fine revolving lines. Within the umbilicus are radiating raised lines which cross two or three small revolving ribs. The aperture is rounded, with angles corresponding to the ribs.Verrill, A. E. 1880. Notice of the remarkable marine fauna occupying the outer banks off the southern coast of New England.

Description (Original description by M. Schepman) The size of the shell varies between 5 mm and 12 mm. The shell has a depressed, slightly conical shape. It is rather thin. The upper surface is yellowish-white, with ziczac-lines and blotches of yellowish-brown, forming more or less distinct bands, of which one, consisting of triangular white spots and very small blotches, borders the suture. A peripheral band is distinctly articulated with white and brown and an intermediate band of more arrow-headed blotches. The interstices are filled by the yellowish-brown lines, which are often confluent, leaving only small whitish spots. The basal surface is lighter, with scarce markings, of which a band of blotches, bordering the umbilicus, is the most conspicuous. The shell contains about five whorls. The nucleus is smooth. The next two whorls contain a few (3 or 4) lirae, which are slightly irregular, the upper one is beaded. The lirae become less distinct, being broader and flatter on the next whorl, and are transferred in distant striae with smooth interstices. The infrasutural beads, cease on the penultimate whorl. Besides this sculpture, the whole shell has a smooth, shining appearance, with very fine lines of growth. The body whorl has only a few spiral striae near the periphery. The whorls are slightly convex, the last one is a little depressed and much enlarged, but has no keel. The basal surface is smooth, with fine lines of growth and short, radiating striae round the umbilicus, which is large, pervious, funnel-shaped, sculptured with lines of growth and about 9 spiral lirae. The aperture is subcircular, slightly angular above and compressed near the periphery. The outer margin is thin. The columellar margin is sinuous, thickened, slightly reflected above, running without appreciable angle into the basal margin. The interior of the aperture is nacreous.Schepman 1908-1913, The Prosobranchia of the Siboga Expedition; Leyden,E. J.

Description (Original description by Jeffreys) The height of the shell attains 8 mm, its diameter 7 mm. The pure pearl-white, pyramidal shell is moderately solid. It is semitransparent, of a pearly and partially iridescent luster. Its sculpture shows two spiral ridges or keels on the upper part of each of the last three or four whorls, and one on the upper part of the next or smaller whorl, besides several finer but irregular ridges on the base of the last or largest whorl, and numerous minute spiral striae between all the ridges. The principal ridges are placed near the suture of each whorl, both above and below, leaving a broad flattened space in the middle and a narrow excavated space below the suture, thus imparting a tower- like appearance to the shell. The upper whorls are also marked with numerous short and fine longitudinal ribs, which cross the ridges and make them crenelated. The spire is elevated. The apex is semiglobose, prominent and slightly twisted. The seven whorls increase gradually in size. The suture is very distinct. The aperture is nearly circular, but angulated or somewhat notched below by the umbilical ridge. The outer lip is thin and slightly expanded. The inner lip is folded a little back on the umbilicus, and adheres to the columella. Inside, the shell is more or less iridescent. The umbilicus is large but not wide, funnel-shaped, and completely exposing the whole of the inner spire. It is encircled outside by a strong spiral ridge, which is often beaded, and winds like a staircase into the interior. The operculum forms a spiral of about a dozen whorls, the edges of which are imbricated and overlap one another in succession.Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia Distribution This species occurs in the Atlantic Ocean off Iceland to Western Norway off Western Morocco and the West Indies.

Description The height of the shell is 1.95 cm (0.77 inch), its diameter 1.98 cm (0.78 inch). The thin, translucent, umbilicated shell has a globosely conical shape. It is banded and iridescent. The sculpture shows spiral threads numbering from twenty-five to thirty-five, sharply projecting, rounded, and fine on the body whorl. Of these, there are from three to seven feebler than the rest. Those on the base are continued within the aperture. The interstices are much broader than the threads. The whole surface is also fretted by microscopic spirals and stronger longitudinals, which follow the oblique lines of growth. Of the threads, six to thirteen appear on the penultimate whorl. They begin with the second whorl, and there the longitudinals are rather disproportionately strong and regular. The embryonic apex is faintly but coarsely tubercled. The color of the shell is yellowish white, shot on the upper side with a dark iridescence. The spirals are black, clouded, and broken with oblique longitudinal streaks of white. The spire is high and scalar. The apex, porcelanous and scarcely iridescent, is small, high, and mammillate, and consists of the one embryonic whorl, which is a little turned up on its side. The six whorls increase gradually and regularly in size. They are rounded, near the apex a little angulated by one of the spirals. The suture well marked, angulated, but not sharply so. The aperture is rather oblique, rounded, hardly angulated at the upper corner, not in the least descending, brilliantly iridescent within and showing the colored spirals of the outside. The outer lip is thin, slightly puckered at the spirals, a little thickened on the base. The inner lip is thickened and reflected, especially at its junction with the body where it almost covers the umbilicus. The columella is much curved, and thins gradually out to its junction with the base. The umbilicus is large and funnel-shaped on the base, deep, but small further in, contracted by a spiral white columellar pad, and more than half covered over by the columellar lip. The operculum is rather thin, horny, yellow, with ten or twelve very gradual turns, which are strongly defined by a thickened line. It is feebly marked with concentric and with radiating lines.Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia Distribution This marine species occurs off the Kerguelen Islands.

Short Street in Lexington, Kentucky. The congregation was founded c. 1790 by Peter Durrett and his wife, slaves who came to Kentucky with their master, Rev. Joseph Craig, in 1781 with \\"The Travelling Church\\" of Baptists from Spotsylvania, Virginia. First African Baptist of Lexington is the oldest black Baptist church in Kentucky and the third oldest in the United States; it is the oldest black congregation west of the Allegheny Mountains. In 1850 under its second pastor, it had more than 1,800 members, the largest congregation of any in the state. The nineteenth-century Italianate church was constructed in 1856; by 1861 the congregation at this building numbered 2,223 members. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Today the first African Baptist congregation worships at a newer church at 635 Price Road. History Peter Durrett was born into slavery on the plantation of his white father and master, Captain Duerrett of Caroline County, Virginia.H. E. Nutter, A Brief History of the First Baptist Church (Black) Lexington, Kentucky, 1940, accessed 22 August 2010 As a young man of 25, he converted to the Baptist faith and married an enslaved woman who lived on Rev. Joseph Craig's plantation. Peter probably accompanied frontier guide Capt. William Ellis to the Kentucky district in 1779 scouting the subsequent Travelling Church migration.George Washington Ranck, The Travelling Church: An Account of the Baptist Exodus from Virginia to Kentucky in 1781 under the Leadership of Rev. Lewis Craig and Capt. William Ellis, Louisville, KY: self-published by Mrs. G.W. Ranck, 1910, p. 22 (and footnote), accessed 22 March 2020. After their return and upon learning that his wife's master intended to so migrate, Peter asked for help from Duerrett, who traded him to Craig so the couple could stay together. Durrett and his wife migrated in 1781 with their master and others of the largely Baptist Travelling Church from Spotsylvania, Virginia, led by Joseph's older brother Rev. Lewis Craig. Because Durrett helped the military leader, Captain William Ellis, guide the several hundred migrants and their slaves on the arduous 600-mile journey through the Appalachian Mountains, he was known as Old Captain after the trip. By 1784 Old Captain and his wife were members of a Separatist Baptist church at Boone's Creek, where Joseph Craig was pastor. Soon after, Peter Durrett and his wife got permission from Craig to be hired out and moved to Lexington. There they hired themselves to the pioneer John Maxwell, who let them build a cabin on his property at Maxwell Spring in Lexington. This is where Duerrett began preaching to fellow slaves. The 19th-century religious historian Robert Hamilton Bishop noted that Mrs. Durrett was integral to forming the first congregation: > His wife was also particularly active in providing accommodations for the > people, and in encouraging them to be in earnest about the things which > belonged to their everlasting peace. Durrett applied to the local Baptist association for ordination, accompanied by numerous people seeking baptism. He had hesitated to baptize them without ordination. The association did not ordain Durrett, but \\"directed him to go on in the name of their common Master.\\" Durrett began to baptize persons he believed ready. Durrett and his wife gathered about 50 congregants, most of whom he baptized. About 1790, the members united as the First African Church (now known as the Historic Pleasant Green Baptist Church in Lexington),http://www.visitlex.com/afamheritage-trail/04PleasantGreen.php and Durrett began to administer the Lord's Supper. This is the oldest black Baptist church in Kentucky and the third oldest in the United States.\\"First African Baptist Church\\", Lexington: The Athens of the West, National Park Service, accessed 21 August 2010 It is also the oldest black church west of the Allegheny Mountains. Its early congregants were slaves and free blacks from the Lexington area. The congregation bought its first property in 1815. In 1816 it started a religious school, which continued with lay teachers and classes in various locations. The congregation's first deed for land was dated in July 1820, for property purchased by the trustees: Rolla Blue, William Gist, Solomon Walker, and James Pullock, all free men of color. In July 1822 by written covenant, the church was admitted to fellowship by the First Baptist Church of Lexington (a white congregation).John H. Spencer, A History of Kentucky Baptists: From 1769–1885, Vol. II, Cincinnati, OH: J.R. Baumes private printing, 1886, p. 656-7, accessed 23 August 2010 Durrett lived until 1823, when he was said to be near 90. His congregation then numbered near 300.Robert Hamilton Bishop's An Outline of the History of the Church in the State of Kentucky, during a Period of Forty Years (containing the Memoir of Rev. David Rice), Lexington, Kentucky: T.T. Skillman, 1824, pp. 230-233 Durrett was succeeded in 1823 by Rev. London Ferrill, who was appointed preacher by the Lexington city trustees. A former slave from Hanover County, Virginia, he was freed as a young man by his unmarried master's sister, who inherited his estate and named the infant. (He was likely his first master's son, as he is believed to have been of mixed race and was given a distinguishing name by his master's sister.)A.W. Elder, \\"Biography of London Ferrill, Pastor of the First Baptist Church of Colored Persons, Lexington, KY.\\": A.W. Elder, printer, 1854, 12 pgs, online edition, Documenting the American South, University of North Carolina, accessed 6 May 2011 Although not formally educated, Ferrill was a powerful preacher; he worked as a skilled carpenter. He and his wife migrated to Kentucky and settled in Lexington. He was ordained as a preacher by the First Baptist Church (majority white) before being called to the First African Baptist Church, and was a leader among both the white and black communities. Ferrill served nearly 31 years. After his appointment, his church was received into the Elkhorn Association of the Baptist Church. With the continuing growth of Lexington, the First African Baptist congregation attracted many new members, mostly enslaved, but also free blacks. In 1833 the church purchased the former Old Methodist Meeting House and met there for some years. Ferrill led the congregational growth from 280 to 1,820 members by 1850, when it was the largest church in Kentucky, black or white. During the cholera epidemic of 1833, Ferrill was one of three clergy who stayed in the city to care for people; his own wife died during the crisis. He was said to marry slaves with the words: \\"united until death or distance did them part,\\" which reflected the years of many slaves being sold from the Upper South to the Deep South. Louisville was a major shipping point for slaves being transported down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. In 1854 Ferrill died suddenly of a heart attack. His funeral procession of nearly 5,000 persons to his burial at the Old Episcopal Burying Ground of Christ Church was said to be the largest in Lexington after that of the statesman Henry Clay two years before. Ferrill was the only black to be buried there. In 1856 First African Baptist completed their new building, designed in the popular Italianate style with large, arched windows. By the beginning of the American Civil War in 1861, the congregation numbered 2,223. After the war, together with most other black Baptist churches, the congregation withdrew from the Elkhorn Baptist Association, as they wanted to be independent of white supervision. First African Baptist soon joined a state association of black Baptist congregations established after the war. Today the congregation is part of the National Baptist Convention, USA, the largest association of African-American Baptists. In 1987, the First African Baptist congregation sold its historic building downtown to the nearby Central Christian Church, which has used it as a childcare center. They are considering sale of the historic structure. The First African Baptist congregation moved in the 1980s to a new facility at 635 Price Road.Tom Eblen, \\"Much more at stake than another old building\\", The Bluegrass and Beyond, 30 May 2010, accessed 23 August 2010 Honors * The 1856 church building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. * 2008, Christ Church Cathedral named its community garden for London Ferrill, second preacher of First African Baptist. * In 2010 Christ Church helped gain approval for a city monument installed in honor of London Ferrill at the Old Episcopal Burying Ground.

In 1865 he founded the A.J. Boucher Co. in Montreal which published the works of Canadian and foreign composers until it closed in 1975. In 1862, he founded the Société de numismatique de Montréal, serving as the organization's first president. He composed several works for solo piano, of which his most well known are Coecilia, a mazurka caprice; Les Canotiers du St-Laurent, a 'quadrille canadien'; Jolly Dogs Galop; and Souvenir de Sabatier, a suite of waltzes. Most of his compositions were written and published before 1866. Early life and education Born in Maskinongé, Quebec, Boucher's parents died in 1845 when he was 10 years old. He spent the next six years living and studying at the St. Joseph's College and Mother Seton Shrine in Emmitsburg, Maryland. He was particularly influenced by his music teacher at the school, Henry Dielman, who instructed him in the organ, piano, flute, violin, and singing. He then was a pupil at the Séminaire d'Issy-les-Moulineaux near Paris where his foster father, Antoine LaRocque, enrolled him in September 1851. In March 1852, he became a novitiate in the Society of Jesus in Amiens. He returned to Canada the following August where he continued to spend time with the Jesuits for the next six months. Early career Although interested in the religious life, Boucher eventually decided to abandon this career path in order to pursue other interests. After studying law, he became an employee of the Montreal and Bytown Railway where he was later appointed the company's secretary-treasurer in 1854. From 1855 to 1858 he worked for the Commission seigneuriale as a registrar. He then worked for the Trust & Loan Co. as a broker from 1855 to 1859. During the 1850s, Boucher spent time studying genealogy, music, and numismatics, all of which remained lifelong interests. He taught part-time at the Collège Sainte-Marie de Montréal and the school at the Villa-Maria Convent as in instructor in piano and voice. In 1853 he was appointed organist at St. Patrick's Basilica, Montreal where he remained until 1858 when he was appointed to the same position at Saint-Pierre Church. At Saint-Pierre he founded and directed a choir school. In 1860 he founded the Société Ste-Cécile in 1860. That same year he became organist at Saint-Jacques Cathedral, later adding the role of choirmaster to his responsibilities there in 1865. In 1862, Boucher founded the Société de numismatique de Montréal, serving as the organization's first president. He sold his collection of more than 1,700 coins in 1866. In 1863, he founded the short-lived monthly magazine Les Beaux- Arts with a Mr Manseau and Gustave Smith. In 1866, he founded the monthly periodical Le Canada Musical which was first published from 1 September 1866 to 1 August 1867 and later from 1 May 1875 to 1 April 1881. He also founded the Orphéon canadien and the Société Mozart in Montreal. Work in publishing and later career A.J. Boucher music store at the intersection of Saint Denis Street and the place Christin (now Christin Street) in Montreal. We notice scores and religious statues in the window. In 1861, Boucher made his first forray into the music publishing business when he joined the staff of Laurent et Laforce (later Laurent, Laforce & Bourdeau), a newly established publishing and importing house in Montreal. At that time published French music was difficult to obtain in Canada and Boucher joined the company in hopes of remedying this problem. In 1862, he and Manseau established their own publishing company, \\"Boucher et Manseau\\", after purchasing a controlling interest in Laurent et Laforce. The two companies shared premises through 1864. In 1865, Boucher disbanded Boucher et Manseau and founded a publishing company under his own name, the \\"A.J. Boucher Co.\\" Initially the company only sold sheet music, but expanded to include instruments in 1878. The instrument portion of the business was first run by René Hudon who later became the husband of his eldest daughter, Philomène. It was then taken over by Louis- Étienne-Napoléon Pratte in 1879. Pratte later married Boucher's daughter Cécile and became a successful piano manufacturer. The company established partnerships with several European and American publishers and published the works of Canadian and foreign composers until it closed in 1975. Among the Canadian composers Boucher published were Calixa Lavallée, Alexis Contant, Ernest Gagnon, Jean-Baptiste Labelle, Eugène Lapierre, Roméo Larivière, Alfred Mignault, Albertine Morin-Labrecque, Joseph-Julien Perrault, and Charles Wugk Sabatier. In May 1867, Boucher acquired the Gould & Hill publishing company which he continued to operate independently of the A.J. Boucher Co. for a number of years. With violinist and music critic Arthur Lavigne he opened a music store in Quebec City in 1868. That same year he left the post of organist/choirmaster at Saint-Jacques Cathedral to become choirmaster at the Gesù Church where he remained until 1888. During the 1860s and 1870s, Boucher conducted several public concerts in Montreal, many of them with orchestra. He presented performances of Gioachino Rossini's Stabat Mater (1860, 1868), Sabatier's Cantata (1862), David's Le désert (1866), Vincenzo Bellini's La sonnambula (1867), Michael William Balfe's The Bohemian Girl (1867), Gaetano Donizetti's The Daughter of the Regiment (1867, 1882), and Charles Gounod's Gallia (1879). He also conducted many choral concerts. In December 1870 he conducted a concert commemorating the centenary of Ludwig van Beethoven's birth at St-Patrice Hall with a 100 voice choir and an orchestra of 30. Personal life In 1854, Boucher married soprano Philomène Rousseau with whom he had 15 children. She often performed as a soloist in his concert presentations, notably portraying Amina in performances of Vincenzo Bellini's La sonnambula under his baton. Their eldest son, François Boucher, was a violinist, and their son Joseph-Arthur Boucher was a notable bassist, conductor, choirmaster, and bandmaster. Having never retired, Boucher died in Outremont, Quebec in 1912 and was entombed at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal. His eldest daughter Philomène took over the management of A.J. Boucher Co. after his death. She in turn was succeeded by her daughter Mme Joséphine Boucher-Ouimet, who led the company until her death in April 1975. A.J. Boucher Co. closed its doors in May 1975 after 113 years of business.

It is white, dull on the surface, with a bright nacreous gleam shining through. Spirals: On the upper part of the body whorl there are two rows of tubercles, the first and weaker one is close up to the suture. The second is a little lower than the middle, and its tubercles are strong. Of these there are on each row twenty to twenty-five. They are scarcely connected by a spiral thread. The periphery is sharply angulated and defined by an expressed and tubercled carina, the tubercles of which are hardly so strong as those of the second row above, which from its larger points projects quite as much as the carina. On the base there is an infracarinal furrow and three or four sharpish, equally parted, faintly tubercled, spiral threads, the inmost of which is most distinctly tubercled, and defines the umbilical depression. Longitudinals: The apical whorls, except the embryonic one, are crossed by high, sharp, slightly oblique ribs. But these on the later whorls break up into tubercles, between which on the different rows there is a slight irregular connexion by flattened ridges, which are oblique, interrupted, and on the base sinuous. Besides these the surface is roughened by minute wavy irregular lines of growth. The colour of the shell is white, with a translucent layer of porcellanous glaze over brilliant pearly nacre. The spire is high. The flattened apex is small, with the minute inflated 1¼ embryonic whorl rising a little exserted on one side. There are seven whorls projecting out squarely below the suture, flattened in the middle, protuberant at the second row of tubercles, and slightly contracted above the carina. At the carina they are sharply angulated. The base of the shell, which is flatly rounded, has a narrow flattish margin, and in the middle a slight umbilical depression, in the centre of which is a minute umbilical hole almost covered by the columellar lip. The suture is linear. The aperture is scarcely oblique, and very slightly inclined out from the axial line. It is squarish, but rounded on the base and at the angles, a little broader than high, nacreous within. The outer lip is not thin, and has a slight callus just within it. It is slightly sinuated on the base at the outer corner. The columellar lip on leaving the body, bends over very flatly so as to cover the umbilicus, after which it curves round to the left. It has a very blunt tubercle in the middle, is a little reverted, and has a very slight furrow behind it. The umbilicus has a small open depression leading into a minute central pore. The slopes of the depression are obliquely scored by the tubercles of the central basal thread. Watson R. B. (1878–1883). Mollusca of H. M. S. Challenger Expedition.

The color of the shell is faintly iridescent all over, creamy white, flecked with zigzag lines of crimson, which on the upper whorls are narrow and regular, on the penultimate whorl are remote, and on the last are irregular, broken and crowded. On the base there are eleven to twelve elongated radiating crimson spots. The first three whorls are a pale orange-yellow. The spire is rather high, scalar. The apex is small, bluntly pointed. The 6½ whorls show a flat shelf below the suture, angulated at about one-fifth of their breadth, and rounded from the angulation to the suture.

Description (Original description by Paul Bartsch) The size of the shell varies between 10 mm and 20 mm. The shell has a regularly conic shape. It is flesh colored, with squarish maculations of chestnut brown, the latter occupy a zone extending from the periphery to the middle of the whorl, and are separated from each other by a space about equal to the width of the brown spots. On the base, the spiral cords are dotted with maculations of the same color. There are at least two nuclear whorls, apparently smooth. The postnuclear whorls are marked by spiral cords and axial riblets forming tubercles at their junction, thus lending the spiral cords a granulated appearance. Of these cords, 3 occur upon the first, 4 upon the second, 7 upon the third, 8 upon the fourth, and 10 upon the penultimate turn between the periphery and the summit. These spiral cords are separated on all but the body whorl by spaces about equal to the cords in width. On the last turn, however, the sulci are broader and the tuberculated cords are less regular than on the preceding turns. The sutures are slightly constricted. The periphery of the body whorl is decidedly angulated, and marked by a broad spiral cord. The base of the shell is short, slightly rounded, and marked by 14 somewhat flattened spiral cords of somewhat irregular width, increasing slightly in width from the periphery to the umbilical area. The spaces that separate them are also of somewhat irregular width, but in general are almost as wide as the cord. In addition to the spiral sculpture, the base is marked by numerous coarse lines of growth which cut the cords but do not render them tuberculated. The aperture is subcircular. The posterior angle is obtuse;. The outer lip is thin. The columella is strongly curved and reflected over the base as a slight callus at the umbilical area.

It is a blue-black solid that is highly sensitive to air. Preparation The material was first claimed by Ruff and Wallstein who reduced zirconium tetrachloride with aluminium to give impure samples. Subsequently, the problem with aluminium contamination was solved when it was prepared by reduction using zirconium metal: :Zr + 3 ZrCl4 → 4 ZrCl3 When aluminium is used as the reducing agent with zirconium tetrachloride, a series of choloroaluminates are formed, for example [Zr(AlCl4)2(AlCl4)2] and Zr(AlCl4)3. Since the trihalides, such as zirconium trichloride, are comparatively nonvolatile, contamination can be avoided by using a gaseous reductant. For example, zirconium trichloride can be prepared by reduction of zirconium tetrachloride with hydrogen. :ZrCl4 \\\\+ ½ H2 → ZrCl3 \\\\+ HCl Structure Some zirconium halides (ZrCl3, ZrBr3, and ZrI3) have structures similar to HfI3. They also have similar space group (P63/mcm) and hexagonal structure with 2 molecules in the cell. The magnetic susceptibility of zirconium trichloride suggests metal- metal interactions of the unpaired electron on each Zr(III) center. The magnetic moment of ZrCl3 (0.4 BM) indicates considerable overlap of metal orbitals.Wells, A.F. Structural Inorganic Chemistry. Oxford Science Publications, 1975, 5th ed, 417-420.

The species was named after Mr. J.S. Benedict, formerly naturalist of the Albatross party, Description (Original description by W.H. Dall) The size of the shell varies between 23 mm and 39 mm. The depressed, umbilicated shell has an acute apex and a slightly concave outline. It is polished, straw-colored and lineated with red brown and pale pink. Its base is convex, slightly flattened. The periphery is rounded. The nucleus is minute, apparently dextral. The spire contain seven or more whorls. The umbilicus is deep and narrow, with flexuous walls excavated near the carina, which is marginated with an opaque white band. The spiral sculpture begins at the umbilicus. Outside the carina, which is simple, there are two strong broad subnodulous spirals separated by a deep line, then fourteen or more equal smooth flattish spirals with narrower interspaces and obsolete spiral striulae here and there. Then follows a smooth or slightly striate peripheral space. All the preceding are straw-colored. Above the periphery one can see two pink and one straw-colored large smooth and rounded spirals, one smaller smooth one, then three large and two intercalary smaller nodulous spirals separated from the suture by a narrow smooth space. The interspaces are brown, the elevations straw-colored. The early whorls have two or three smooth and one or two nodulous spirals, the former remain constant with growth, the latter increase in number. The radiating sculpture consists of flexuous incremental lines, hardly visible. The rounded aperture is squarish. The white columella is thin, concave, with a small notch at its base.

The large, solid shell is depressed. It contains five to seven whorls. It is light brown with a few touches of white transverse to the whorls on the carina. The umbilical rib is white. The nucleus and interior walls of the umbilicus is dark brown. Several of the spiral grooves above and below are marked by a darker brown than the rest, and appear as brown lines. (Original description by W.H. Dall) The sculpture above, on the nuclear whorls, consists of close-set sharp longitudinal grooves with the ridges between them rounded and more or less beaded or nodulous. They are crossed by more or less evident lines of growth, which, however, are not necessarily coincident with the beading where present. The grooves continue, but do not seem to increase in number, while all sculpture disappears from between them. The interspaces are smooth and flat and only marked by very light lines of growth. The carina is separated from the rest of the whorl by a squarish shallow gutter, somewhat too broad to be termed a groove. The base of the shell rounds up over the periphery so that the most angular edge of the carina is at the top . The base between is flat and rounded, marked by evanescent (partly brown) grooves and transversely by delicate flexuous slightly raised aggregations of the lines of growth at somewhat regular intervals. These slightly crenate the umbilical rib on its inner edge and perhaps form the pronounced, slightly backwardly flexed, striae and ridges which mark the umbilical walls. There is hardly any callus on the body wall at the aperture, which is broken in the specimens at hand. Its form has been made out from the lines of growth. The suture in the later whorls is closely appressed, the carinal gutter would at first sight be taken for it.

Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes, however by the 1990s tornado statistics were coming closer to the numbers we see today. Synopsis In the first three months of the year, the number of tornadoes and tornado outbreaks were low to moderate. Then from April to August each month had over a hundred outbreaks. The fall season saw fewer tornadoes with the exception of a moderate outbreak in November. The killer F4 tornado that struck Piedmont, Alabama on Palm Sunday (a date of infamous tornado outbreaks in 1965 and 1920) killed 22 people, the most since the 1990 Plainfield, Illinois tornado. Events =United States yearly total= January There were a total of 13 tornadoes confirmed and in January. =January 26-27= Four tornadoes touched down in Mississippi, including one F2 tornado that caused seven injuries in the city of Brookhaven, Mississippi. February There were 9 tornadoes confirmed in February. March There were 58 tornadoes confirmed in March. =March 27= The third notable tornado outbreak to occur on Palm Sunday and the second in the Southeastern United States, this deadly series of 27 tornadoes became the most notable tornado event of the year, resulting in 40 fatalities. Two tornadoes were rated F4, including the Piedmont, Alabama tornado that killed 22 people. April 205 tornadoes were confirmed in April. =April 11–15= Tornadoes touched down across several states, resulting in six fatalities. =April 25–27= A widespread tornado outbreak affected much of the United States from Colorado to New York. The outbreak killed at least six people across two states from two F4 tornadoes near Dallas, Texas and Lafayette, Indiana. May 161 tornadoes were confirmed in May. June 234 tornadoes were confirmed in June. =June 13= Four tornadoes (no fatalities) touched down, including an F2 in Jackson, Michigan and another F2 in Olean, New York. =June 18= At least one tornado was confirmed in St. Francis/Portage Lake, Maine and caused two injuries. =June 25–27= Tornadoes on June 25 and June 27 resulted in three fatalities in Missouri and Georgia. July 155 tornadoes were confirmed in July. =July 5= An F4 tornado in Maribel, Wisconsin resulted in no fatalities. =July 27= An F3 tornado killed three people in Limerick, Pennsylvania. August 120 tornadoes were confirmed in August. =August 4 (Canada)= An F3 struck the Aylmer, Quebec area just outside Ottawa. Several homes were destroyed and hundreds others were damaged, extensively. A total of 15 people were injured and damage was estimated at $15 million. It was the first F3 in the Canadian province of Quebec since the Maskinonge/Pierreville area tornado of August 27, 1991. =August 27= Two F3 tornadoes resulted in four fatalities in Wisconsin. September 30 tornadoes were confirmed in September. October 51 tornadoes were confirmed in October. November 42 tornadoes were confirmed in November. =November 26-28= A small but destructive outbreak produced 19 tornadoes across the Southern United States, resulting in six fatalities and 45 injuries. An F3 tore through Shelby and Fayette County, Tennessee, killing three after destroying 28 homes, damaging 300 other homes and badly damaging a high school.

(Original description by W.H. Dall) The small, thin shell is pearly white with faint touches of pale brown, The spire contains 7 whorls with a globular inverted minute nucleus and a rather convex base. The spiral sculpture shows two prominent spirals, one peripheral, simple, sharp, with occasional touches of brown. Against this the suture is laid in the earlier whorls, while in the body whorl it descends below it. The other spiral is above the periphery, and is stronger and ornamented with (on the last whorl) about forty sharp projecting thorn-like tubercles, each inclined a little forward, and alternating brown and white. Between this and the periphery the space is excavated. Above these there are about four (on the earlier whorls one or two) small raised spiral lines separated by much wider interspaces, nodulated with small but prominent nodules at the intersections with the radiating sculpture. All the sculpture grows fainter, and intercalary fine lines appear toward the aperture on the last whorl. The base of the shell has two strong nodulous spirals separated by a deep interspace, the inner one forming the umbilical margin. Outside of these 16-20 fine flattened spiral threads, with about equal interspaces, reach to the periphery and are hardly ruffled by the incremental lines. The radiating sculpture consists of numerous, on the early whorls strong, slightly elevated oblique threads, extending clear across the whorls and reticulating the spirals. These radii grow fainter and finally on the body whorl nearly disappear;. On the base there are only faint flexuous incremental lines. The walls of the narrow umbilicus are flexuous and yellow. The aperture is squarish. The little columella is concave, not toothed. The margin is thin and simple. The upper surface of the whorls, except the sculpture, is flattened. The suture is distinct, not channelled. The horny operculum is multispiral. The soft parts of the gastropod are whitish. The foot is short, pointed behind. The muzzle is rounded. The gill is single. The anus is prolonged into a long free papilla. The eyes are large. The tentacles are long and stout, without frontal lobes. The epipodium has a large anterior lobe, and four cirri all anterior to the operculum and about of equal size. The jaws are separate, squarish, composed of small horny obliquely set rods, whose lozenge- shaped end-sections reticulate the surface under the microscope. The quite minute radula is peculiar. The rhachidian and (on each side) five laterals have broad simple bases with a pear-shaped outline. The cusps, which might be compared to the stem of the pear bent over, are extremely narrow and long and symmetrically serrate on each side with 4-6 serrations. The major uncinus is stout and has a large four-toothed ovate cusp. There are about twenty more slender uncini with scythe-like cusps serrate on the outer edge. Outside of these are two or three of a flat form, like a section of a palm-leaf fan from handle to margin with four riblets, and the distal edge with three or more indentations. Under pressure these uncini have a tendency to split up lengthwise, beginning at the indentations. They are flat and smooth, thinner toward the distal end, and have no distinct shaft.Dall W. H. 1889.

Description (Original description by M.M. Schepman) The height of the shell attains 9 mm. The shell has an elevated-conical shape with nearly straight sides. It is slightly attenuated towards the spire. Its color is yellowish with purple-brown flames and rufous spots on the lirae. The spire contains 7½ whorls. The nucleus is probably smooth, but slightly worn. it is followed by three whorls, each with 3 strong, spiral lirae, of which the basal one is the strongest. They are beaded where they are crossed by concentric ribs, which disappear on the subsequent whorls. These have 3 strong spirals, of which the basal one forms a conspicuous keel, a little above the linear suture, which on the lower whorls is accompanied by a thin thread and a shallow channel between this and the keel. An intermediate spiral, between the first and the second one, becomes on the body whorl nearly a fourth spiral. On the fourth whorl the lirae are still beaded, on the fifth this is only the case with the upper one. The interstices of the last 4 whorls are nearly smooth, with very fine growth-striae and only a few deeper ones, especially on the upper whorls. The base of the shell is rather convex, with 8 lirae, the external one bordering the subperipheral channel, the external 5 lirae are narrow, with broad, smooth interstices, the central 3 are broad, all are ornamented with rufous spots. The base is covered with very fine growth- striae and more remote deeper striae, rendering the central 2 lirae crenulated. The umbilicus is moderately wide, but seen from the base, nearly closed by a very strong, white, striated funiculus. The aperture is depressedly-rounded, with a thin but not quite intact margin, which is crenulated by the external lirae. The columella is cylindrical, very concave, slightly reflected over the umbilicus, its base only very little angular.

Description The height of the shell varies between 18 mm and 35 mm. The thin, light and acutely conical shell is imperforate. It is corneous or flesh-colored, more rarely rich orange, unicolored or sparsely articulated on the basal rilblets with rich brown, and frequently with rather obscure clouded niaculations of pale brown above. The surface is shining, closely sculptured by numerous narrow threads or riblets, which on the spire are contiguous, finely, regularly beaded. They become more separated on the body whorl. The interstices are obliquely striate. The spiral riblets are either granulate or nearly smooth. The base of the shell shows numerous concentric lirulae that are granose or nearly smooth. Their interstices are radiately striate. The elevated spire is slender, its outlines concave. The apex is minute. The apical whorl is smooth and rounded. The suture is linear. Its position is marked by a slightly prominent double granose cingulus above it. There are about eight, flat whorls. The last one is strongly angular at the periphery and convex beneath. The aperture is subquadrate and finely sulcate inside. The subvertical columella is arcuate and cylindrical.

The last whorls show at their top, near the suture, a decumbent rib and a little below the periphery of a protruding, very acute carina. Between this carina and the upper rib, there are some other almost obsolete ribs, sometimes slightly granular. On the body whorl a second carina arises at the corner of the outer lip. The base of the shell is decorated with concentric, flattened, close and uneven ribs. The growth lines are very thin and visible only with a magnifying glass. The round aperture has inwardly a pearly appearance. The columella is very thick and slightly arched. The outer lip is thickened inwardly at a small distance from the edge, which is sharp.

The type specimens were collected by amateur conchologist Mr. Kiheizi Oosima in 1938. The specific name kiheiziebisu is in honour of him. The new species was originally described as Calliostoma kiheiziebisu by the Japanese malacologist Yanosuke Otuka (1903-1950) in 1939. Otukaia kiheiziebisu is the type species of the genus Otukaia Ikeba, 1942.http://www.gastropods.com/Taxon_pages/Family_CALLIOSTOMATIDAE_CALLIOSTOMATINAE.shtml accessed 16 June 2010 Some authors recognize Otukaia as a separate genus.Vilvens & Sellanes (2006). The Nautilus 120(1): 15-20. Description apex of the shell of Otukaia kiheiziebisu. The shell is large, conical, thin, semitransparent, pale cinnamon pink in colour with pearly lustre. The shell has 8.5 whorls. One and a half coils of nuclear portion of whorls are rounded in outline, smooth, polished on the surface. Subsequent whorls are sculptured with four strong, beaded spiral keels and very fine lines, which are only visible under a magnifying lens, and with fine oblique lines of growth. The uppermost spiral keel is situated on the subsutural area. The second and the third spiral keels are dividing the surface of whorl into three parts with unequal interval; the uppermost part the broadest, having angle of about 120° to the middle one, weakly sculptured with a thread and many exceedingly fine spiral lines near the body whorl. The lowest one is the narrowest of them all. The lowest spiral keel is concealed with succeeding whorl. The number of beads on the upper most spiral keel is ca 165-177 on the last whorl, ca 130 on penultimate whorl, ca 80 on the sixth whorl, ca 50 on the fifth whorl, ca 42 on the fourth whorl, ca 28 on the third whorl and ca 19 on the second whorl. The base is sculptured with about 40 spiral threads. The inner surface is smooth, pearly lustrous, ornamented with four spiral dull grooves which correspond to the outer keels respectively. Callus is extending over the umbilicus so as to occlude it completely, giving a shape of oblique columellar end. The height of the shell is 30 mm. The width of the shell is 33 mm. The operculum is small, round, horny, thin, translucent, marked with a fine spiral line which coils about 13 in number. The diameter of the operculum is about 13 mm. Otukaia kiheiziebisu is very similar to Calliostoma kounjiana Yokoyama in general outline, and in sculpture on the surface, but it differs from Calliostoma kounjiana in having the spirally sculptured base and the beaded spiral keels, while Calliostoma kounjiana is quite smooth both on spiral keel and the base. Any other species reported from the northern Pacific has much thicker shell and more complicated sculptures than Otukaia kiheiziebisu.

Description (Original description by W.H. Dall) The height of the shell attains 30 mm. The shell has an acutely conic, with the sides of the spire slightly concave. It contains 10 brilliantly polished whorls. The color of the shell is a rich brick-red. It is mottled near the periphery with whitish fiammules. The white nucleus is translucent and tilted obliquely. The sculpture on the subsequent four or five whorls, of five (5) granular, spiral ridges, separated only by narrow incised lines, with a more conspicuous ridge just above the suture. Subsequently, the ridges become flattened, wider and more or less spirally striate on their tops, while the original five incised lines retain a darker color than the rest of the surface. The suture is not strongly marked, and runs just below the periphery of the preceding whorl. The base of the shell (diameter: 16 mm) is slightly convex, with ten or eleven similar incised spiral lines stronger toward the umbilicus, where the interspaces become feebly nodulous. The last one on the brink of the umbilicus is more strongly so. The umbilicus is moderately large (diameter 2.5 mm) and funicular. Its walls are white, smooth, and slightly excavated just within the basal margin. The white columella is thin, arcuate, ending in a blunt projection separated by a small notch from the basal margin of the aperture, which, with the outer lip, is thin and sharp. The throat is pearly, without lirations or callus on the body. The periphery is subangulate, becoming rounded in the adult. The operculum is thin, horny, multi-spiral, with about 14 whorls. The animal is of a reddish color somewhat like the shell. The sides of the foot are granular. The muzzle is concentrically wrinkled. The tentacles are long and slender, with no epicephalic veil between them. The eyes are large and black, on short but distinct peduncles, behind and above the tentacles. The epipodial lobes contain papillose edges and two or three more elongate processes on each side, but none project from the opercular lobe. The foot is short and rather blunt behind. As contracted from immersion in alcohol, the tentacles and epipodial processes seem smooth, and show no such ciliation as is figured by Adams in Calliostoma, while the absence of the \\"veil\\" is noteworthy.

Description (Original description by W.H. Dall) The size of the shell varies between 8 mm and 20 mm. The small, white shell has an acutely conical shape with a glassy sinistral globular nucleus and five (or more) whorls. The radiating sculpture consists of faint incremental lines. The spiral sculpture on the upper surface of the body whorl consists of seven nodulous revolving lines, beginning at the suture; the first, third, and fifth have larger nodules elongated in the direction of the lines, the second and fourth are more finely and simply evenly beaded. A single fine raised not nodulous thread separates each pair of the preceding. The sixth and seventh spirals are smaller than the fifth and close together. They stretch over a series of more distant swellings, and are concavely impressed between them. As these lines form the periphery, this gives a wavy or scalloped outline to the base, which has about eighteen such waves arranged to a certain extent in pairs, the distance and concavity between them alternating greater and less. The longer waves are articulated with pale brown, and the first and third spirals show traces of a similar articulation. The base of the shell is pretty sharply carinated, flattened, and finely spirally threaded. Some of the threads show faint traces of articulation The columella is nearly straight. The aperture is nearly rectangular. There is no umbilicus or pit.Dall W. H. 1889.

It may be brown, orange-red or a brilliant violet or pale yellowish, with radiating brown flames above. The base of the shell is dotted with brown and whitish. The sculpture though variable is characteristic. The surface of whorls is encircled by spiral lirae uneven in size, and cut into very close compressed granules. There are about 10 such lirae on the penultimate whorl, but the number is variable owing to the greater or less development of interstitial riblets. The base has 10-13 concentric riblets, which have a tendency to split or become double. They are wider than the interstitial furrows. The conical spire is elevated. The apex acute. The sutures are slightly impressed. The seven whorls are slightly convex. There are generally two or three stronger lirae near the middle or periphery, and this gives at times a slightly bicarinate outline to the body whorl. The flattened base is a little convex.

Some of these former Emmaites were George W. Pilipō, Joseph K. Nawahi, and Albert K. Kunuiakea. Missionaries The Missionary Party was a pro-American, pro-business party who developed an unpopular reputation as a rich, White American businessmen. In 1880 and 1882 some Missionaries ran as Kuokoa Party candidates to distance themselves from the stigma of their own party. Interested by this strategy the Missionary Party ran all their candidates as Independents in the elections of 1884 and 1886. A special Missionary group called the Committee of Nine was established to occupy the leadership positions of the Kuokoa Party and favor the Missionary candidates. Two party system In 1884 a two-party system emerged in Hawaii with the consolidation of opposition to the National Party. The general ideology of the Kuokoa Party was, basically, positions other than that of the ruling National Party for the various reasons of individual Independents. Such an example was opposition to King Kalākaua, the range of opposition varied from preferring Queen Emma on the throne, abolishing the monarchy and forming a republic, to annexing Hawaii to the United States. Bayonet Constitution Disappointed with the results of the 1886 elections the Missionaries forced the Bayonet Constitution on the government. The new Constitution slanted elections in the favor of the Missionaries and they departed the Kuokoa party. In the elections of 1887, the Missionary Party renaming themselves the Reform Party and ran candidate as their own party. Native Sons The departure of the Missionaries left a vacuum in the Kuokoa Party that was eventually filled by the Native Sons of Hawaii. The Native Sons was a pro-monarchy, Pro-Hawaiians political organization that supported the National Reform Party. The Kuokoa Party reflected the positions of the Native Sons and became a secondary party for districts without a National Reform candidates.

Life and career Born in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, La Liberté was named after the Canadian sculptor of the same name. He began his piano studies as a teenager with a Miss Malsberg. His later piano teachers included J.-B. Denys, Dominique Ducharme, Romain-Octave Pelletier I, and Émiliano Renaud. In 1902 he entered the Stern Conservatory in Berlin where he studied with such teachers as Ernst Baeker (harmony), Paul Lutzenko (piano), and Wilhelm Klatte (counterpoint and composition) through 1906. The expenses of his education in Berlin were paid largely through grants obtained from the German government after winning a series of piano competitions. He notably played in concert for Wilhelm II at both the imperial court of Berlin and the ducal court of Cobourg. In 1906 La Liberté returned to Canada and began teaching at the Canadian Conservatory of Music in Ottawa in the autumn of 1906. He gave a highly lauded recital at the Monument national in Montreal on 22 November 1906. An admirer of the works of Alexander Scriabin, he began a correspondence with the composer in February 1907 while Scriabin was staying in New York City. Scriabin invited La Liberté to visit him in New York, and La Liberté came to that city for a visit in the summer of 1907. Scriabin convinced La Liberté to return to Berlin, and the composer soon began further studies in that city with Teresa Carreño. He then went to Brussels where he studied composition under Scriabin, becoming one of his close disciples. He gave recital tours in Germany and England from 1908–1910, notably appearing in concert with Emma Albani in London. La Liberté returned to Montreal in 1911 where he opened a private teaching studio. He also was active in that city as a performer where he was a proponent of Scriabin's works. In 1913 he moved to New York City, where he taught as a guest lecturer at several institutions and ran a piano studio. Financial problems related to World War I put an end to his career in America and he once again returned to teaching privately in Montreal. From 1926-1935 he worked as a piano instructor for the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary. He then taught on the faculty of the Conservatoire national de musique for several years. Among his notable pupils were Hélène Baillargeon, Morris Davis, Gérald Desmarais, Hector Gratton, Djane Lavoie-Herz, Antonio Létourneau, Alfred Mignault, Marie-Thérèse Paquin, and Wilfrid Pelletier. Liberté died in Montreal in 1952 at the age of 70. He was made an associate of the Canadian Music Centre posthumously. At the time of his death he was in possession of a number of Scriabin's original manuscripts, including Poem of Ecstasy and Sonata No. 5, and his wife donated them to the Scriabin museum in Moscow in 1972.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1965 to 1969 as a member of the Liberal caucus in opposition. Early life William Alexander Switzer was born September 21, 1920 in Hinton, Alberta to Harvey Alexander Switzer and Edith Amelia Lawrence, or Scottish and English decent respectively. He would attend Edson High School and later the University of Alberta where he would study Pharmacy. Switzer would marry Vivian Gertrude McLeod on July 22, 1946 and had twin daughters named Joan and Janice. Second World War His attendance at university interrupted during his second year by the Second World War where he would enlist in the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1940 as a pilot, attaining the rank of Flight lieutenant between 1940–1945. During the war Switzer would be sent to RCAF Station Borden for training, and would pilot the Hawker Typhoon with the 193 Squadron of the British Royal Air Force based out of England and later France, in a low-level ground-attack role. Switzer participated in Normandy landings in France, with his squadron charged with taking out early warning and communication systems and bomb the Normandy beachhead. Switzer would be part of the July 14, 1944 attack on German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel when his and another aircraft diverted after reports of two enemy staff cars came in. Rommel would experience serious head injuries and would return to Germany to recover, and Adolf Hitler would later provide Rommel with the choice to commit suicide follow his alleged role in the Valkyrie assassination attempt, with the German public told he died of wounds from the incident. Later in the war Switzer's airplane would be hit by anti-aircraft fire during a mission over Falise, he would bail out just in time. He would suffer a broken knee and burns from the crash and be captured by a German patrol the next day, and during transport to an aid station, the patrol was ambushed by American soldiers, which provided Switzer an opportunity to escape. Switzer would crawl for a day towards allied lines until he was found by American soldiers, and was subsequently returned to England for recovery for several months, and later back to Canada by Christmas 1944, ending his service in World War Two. Switzer would fly 135 missions during the Second World War. Switzer would complete his studies at the University of Alberta and open Switzer Drugs in Hinton. Political career Switzer would be elected the first Mayor of his hometown of Hinton in 1958 and serve in the role until 1964. Switzer would contest a seat unsuccessfully for provincial legislature and federal parliament before a successful by-election in 1965. Switzer ran for the Alberta Legislature in the 1952 and 1955 general elections as a candidate for the provincial Liberal party in the electoral district of Edson. He was defeated both times by incumbent Social Credit MLA Norman Willmore. In the Canadian federal election of 1963 Switzer ran as the Liberal candidate in the electoral district of Jasper—Edson. He finished a distant third place to incumbent Hugh Horner. In 1965 Switzer attempted another run for the provincial legislature. He ran as a candidate in a by-election held on March 29, 1965 in the electoral district of Edson after Norman Willmore died in a car accident. Switzer would defeat Alberta NDP leader Neil Reimer and A. W. Leonard, a local grocery store owner for the Social Credit Party by just over 100 votes each, to sit in the 15th Alberta Legislature. Switzer faced Reimer again as well as Social Credit candidate Arthur Jorgensen in the 1967 general election for a seat in the 16th Alberta Legislature. Switzer defeated Jorgensen by over 800 votes while Reimer finished a close third place. Switzer died from a heart attack in office on June 30, 1969. In the subsequent by- election held on October 28, 1969 to fill the vacated Edson seat, Progressive Conservative candidate Robert Dowling would edge out Social Credit candidate Arthur Jorgensen and NDP candidate Grant Notley. Liberal Party candidate R. Woods would come fourth out of fourth. Legacy The Government of Alberta would name the William A. Switzer Provincial Park in his honour in 1974.

It was the United States largest producer of lead and zinc at the time of its merger with Fluor Corporation in 1981. The St. Joseph Lead Company was founded on March 25, 1864 by Lyman W. Gilbert, John E. Wylie, Edmund I. Wade, Wilmot Williams, James L. Dunham and James L. Hathaway in New York City. The company acquired a lead mine at Bonne Terre, Missouri. The mine had numerous problems including Price's Raid by Confederate States Army General Sterling Price. However under first president J. Wyman Jones and new mine manager Charles B. Parsons began using new diamond drilling techniques the business prospered. It nearly went bankrupt February 26, 1883 when a fire destroyed the milling operations. The success of the company prompted many competitors in southeast Missouri including the Doe Run Company and Desloge Consolidated Lead Company which were absorbed by St. Joe. Firmin V. Desloge, patriarch of the Desloge Family in America, remained on the board of directors as well as many of his descendants well into the late 20th Century. By 1923 the company had 250 miles of underground railroad running under Flat River, Missouri, Leadwood, Missouri, Desloge, Missouri, Rivermines, Missouri and Elvins, Missouri. In 1925 it expanded operations to lead, zinc and silver mining in South America including the Aguilar mine in Argentina near the Bolivia border. Its expansion into the zinc operations particularly in the northeastern United States lead it to Northern Ore Company in New York and the New Jersey Zinc Company in New Jersey in 1943.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat;=19430302&id;=RDEbAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=okwEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=2865,2230542 In the 1940s it expanded its Missouri Lead Belt operations to Indian Creek, Missouri, Viburnum, Missouri, Meremec, Missouri and Fletcher, Missouri. Its domination of the Southeast Missouri Lead District gave it control of nearly 70 percent of the United States lead production As the company also branched into the coal industry acquiring A.T. Massey in 1974 it was renamed St. Joe Mineral. In 1981 with metal prices running high Fluor Corporation outbid Seagrams to acquire the company. Shortly after the acquisition metal prices collapsed. The Fluor Corporation would spin the components off with zinc going to the Horsehead Corporation in 1987, lead to the Doe Run Company and coal to Massey Energy.

Based on the structure of the teeth, Uatchitodon was probably a carnivorous archosauromorph. Folded grooves on the teeth indicate that the animal was likely venomous, with the grooves being channels for salivary venom. The teeth are similar to those of living venomous squamates such as Heloderma and venomous snakes. Uatchitodon is the earliest known venomous reptile. Description and species The genus was first named with the description of the type species U. kroehleri by Hans-Dieter Sues in the journal Nature in 1991. U. kroehleri is known from several teeth found from the early middle Carnian Turkey Branch Formation of the Newark Supergroup in Virginia, uncovered from the Tomahawk locality. The teeth average around 10 mm in length. The tooth crown is strongly labiolingually compressed, recurved, and serrated along both the anterior and posterior edges. The serrations are formed from individual denticles, each of which is further denticulated. On both the labial (outer) and lingual (inner) surfaces of the tooth, there is a deep central groove running longitudinally. The grooves form deep invaginations that constrict the inner pulp cavity of the tooth. The grooves do not reach the tip of the tooth. A single tooth from the Petrified Forest Formation of the Late Triassic Chinle Group, found at the Placerias Quarry at St. Johns, Arizona, has been identified as one of Uatchitodon. It is slightly younger than the teeth of U. kroehleri found in Virginia. Venom-conducting teeth were first noted from the Placerias Quarry in the 1980s, but they were not interpreted as belonging to Uatchitodon until 1992. The tooth, known as MNA V3680, differs from those of U. kroehleri in that the grooves are fully enclosed and form tubes within the teeth. There are faint furrows at the sutures that enclose these tubes. The tubes, which are presumably venom canals, end at discharge orifices near the tip of the crown. MNA V3680 is the earliest example of a tetrapod with completely enclosed tooth canals for the delivery of oral toxins, which are seen today in elapid snakes. MNA V3680, along with several other teeth from the Cumnock Formation near Raleigh, North Carolina, represent a second species of Uatchitodon, U. schneideri. This species, although recognized since 1996, remained unnamed until 2010. U. schneideri was named in honor of Vince Schneider of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. The holotype tooth, known as NCSM 24753, was found from a locality referred to as NCPALEO 1906, along with many other teeth and uncatalogued fragments. NCPALEO 1906, better known as the Moncure microvertebrate locality, was discovered and excavated by Schneider. The teeth from the Moncure locality are similar to MNA V3680 in that they all have enclosed venom canals that open at the ends of the teeth. The teeth of U. schneideri can be distinguished from those of U. kroehleri by enclosure of the canals as well as a lesser degree of labiolingual compression. Paleobiology The tubular venom canals of U. schneideri are similar to those found in the teeth of venomous snakes, while the grooved teeth of U. kroehleri are similar to those of living gila monsters. The teeth of U. kroehleri in the Tomahawk locality are older than those of U. schneideri in the Moncure locality and Placerias quarry, suggesting that the grooved teeth of U. kroehleri developed into the tubular fangs of U. schneideri. A similar transition is thought to have occurred in snakes. The earliest venomous snakes appeared in the Miocene epoch with fully formed tubular fangs, but there is no fossil evidence of earlier snakes with grooved teeth. In the development of living venomous snakes, however, the fangs have open grooves before erupting. One they emerge from the gum line, the fangs have enclosed canals. The grooves of U. kroehleri may indicate that it had a lifestyle similar to the living gila monster, chewing prey to pass venom into it. With enclosed canals, U. schneideri may have been able to inject venom in a similar way to venomous snakes. Like venomous snakes, it may have been able to pump venom into its prey through venom glands and compressor muscles.

She was best known as one of the pioneering filmmakers at the National Film Board of Canada (NFB).Martineau, Barbara Halpern. \\"Leading Ladies Behind the Camera.\\" Cinema Canada January–February 1981, p. 23.Barker 2006, pp. 37, 40. Early years and education Jane Smart was born in Ottawa, Ontario to Russel S. Smart and Emma Louise (\\"Louie\\") Parr; her father was a successful, self-made patent attorney. Russell and Louise had four children: Helen (b. 1909), Elizabeth (b. 1913), Jane (b. 1915) and Russell Jr. (b. 1921). The family had a summer house, which they named \\"The Barge\\", on Kingsmere Lake located next door to the future Prime Minister of Canada, William Lyon Mackenzie King.Brooks 2000, p. 198. Jane grew up among the social elite of Ottawa through her father's connections as a lawyer. Her mother often hosted parties for prominent politicians and civil servants. As a result, the children socialized with many members of Ottawa's political class who were or would become important figures in Canadian history, including acquaintances such as Graham Spry, Charles Ritchie, Lester B. Pearson and William Lyon Mackenzie King. The three girls were very close, and when they made their debut in society events, \\"all clever and all attractive\\", were inevitably known as the \\"Three Smart Girls\\", aping the title of the 1936 Deanna Durbin film of the same name. After a private prep school for girls, and later secondary school, in 1931, at the age of 16, Jane travelled to London with her mother and older sister, \\"Betty\\" who was studying piano with classical pianist Katharine Goodson at the University of London.Smart 1987, p. 2. During her formative years, Jane wrote (and published) poetry, drew and painted as well as playing the flute, and while in England, would study art.McInnes 2004, p. 151. Jane Marsh c.1943 Filmmaking career Jane Smart joined the National Film Board of Canada in 1941, initially working as a screenwriter. She proposed a film on the home front, focusing on a small town in Ontario during the Second World War, a project that went into pre-production but was never completed. She also headed a research study on the role of women in wartime. During her research for Work for Women, the original title of the later documentary, Women Are Warriors (1942), Smart created an unpublished report highlighting the difficulties that women faced historically and contemporarily in which she suggests that women are either: \\"1) Put up on a pedestal and hypnotized into thinking they are frail, incompetent and dependent or 2) subjugated for the expediency of 1. lust 2. cheap labour by men.\\" Additionally, she asserts that men think women should never \\"be allowed to use their faculties for anything\\" other than \\"1. to make men comfortable 2. to bear children\\".\\"Jane Marsh.\\" Canadian Women Film Directors Database (femfilm.ca). Retrieved: April 15, 2016. For her first few months, Smart was involved in a number of projects and according to Graham McInnes, a fellow NFB colleague, she was considered a \\"dilettante\\" who was in the NFB as \\"a lark\\". Smart, however, was given more responsibility and served as a writer and production assistant to other filmmakers before she was eventually given an opportunity to direct the short film, Alexis Tremblay: Habitant, working alongside cinematographer Judith Crawley, with work beginning in 1942.St. Pierre, Marc. \\"Women and film: A tribute to the female pioneers at the NFB.\\" NFb.ca, March 4, 2013. Retrieved: April 17, 2016. In her films, Smart used both a docudrama approach that relied heavily on staging events, as well as elements of a compilation documentary with newsreel footage edited to form the background to the dialogue.Morris, Peter. \\"Film Reference Library: Canada Carries On.\\" Canadian Film Encyclopedia. Retrieved: April 17, 2016. Her editing approach and her ability to incorporate a multitude of distinct sequences was \\"instinctual with a powerful artistic and political force.\\"Khouri 2007, p. 181. In contrast with his earlier critical appraisal of her skills and work ethic, McInnes had a new appreciation of Smart. \\"Pretty soon she clicked into her niche as editor, scriptwriter and idea woman for her own program of films on women's activities, and her wayward, unpredictable spirit became totally immersed in a neat, well-turned, no-nonsense film about Link Trainers, and a romantic epic: 'Alexis Tremblay—Habitant'. With her blonde hair flying, her big expressive face, her turtleneck sweaters and corduroy pants, she soon became as grimy and effective as any producer: soon entered and excelled at the ruthlessly competitive film screenings where we all showed our work and mercilessly scarified each other on an ascetic diet of coffee and doughnuts.\\" With the successful completion of her first film, Smart would serve as the \\"de facto\\" executive producer for the Canada Carries On documentary series, helming six productions in two years. The films she spearheaded in this series were the only war propaganda films at the NFB directed by a woman. After an increase in interest in films about \\"the role of women\\", Marsh directed Women Are Warriors (1942), Proudly She Marches (1943) and Wings on Her Shoulder (1943).Wise 2015, p. 20.Women Are Warriors, was changed by supervisors from its original title, Work for Women. The film documented \\"women’s participation in the war effort in England, the USSR and Canada\\".Wise 2015, p. 1953. Marc St-Pierre, a writer for the NFB, claims that because Smart's wartime films are the \\"... only war propaganda films directed by a woman, about women, and speaking directly to women\\" that they are \\"firmly feminist\\" and \\"constitute a key moment in the history of women and film in Canada\\". Film historian Wyndham Wise suggests that Women are Warriors, specifically, promoted the concept that \\"women were not leisurely idlers before the conflict\\". In a dispute with NFB founder John Grierson, Smart, now married and went by her married name as Jane Marsh, asked to be formally named as the executive producer on the Canada Carries On series.Evans 1984, p. 138. Faced with the difficulty in advancing her career, and after a final disagreement with Grierson, Marsh resigned from the NFB in 1944.Armatage et al. 1999, p. 1. Most sources cite struggles with Grierson, either over the furthering of her career or about the direction of the \\"Canada Carries On\\" series.Nash, Mary Teresa. \\"Images of women in National Film Board of Canada films during World War II and the post-war years (1939-1949).\\" PhD dissertation, McGill University, 1983, pp. 201–202. Marsh herself declared, \\"I resigned in April 1944, as Grierson had developed megalomania about the 'Canada Carries On' potential.\\" In a series of meetings with Grierson, priorities and scheduling continually were changed until it became clear that she would not have a \\"free hand\\" in producing the film series. She and others have also claimed that Grierson did not want to have a woman producing Canada Carries On, despite Marsh's qualifications and experience with the series. In a later encounter with Grierson in postwar years, he acknowledged to her that he was wrong, but reiterated that he never would have given a woman that prestigious position. Marsh commented that during the years that Grierson was the NFB's commissioner, women \\"... were so grateful to be working in interesting jobs that they didn’t realize they were slaves\\". After leaving the NFB, Marsh moved to New York to work for the British Information Services, where she created the Act and Fact newsreel short film series for British Information Services.McInnes 2004, p. 152. The films, produced in a 16 mm format, closely followed the compilation documentary format that she had earlier used at the NFB.

While working on the NFB documentary film, Inside Fighting Canada (1942), Marsh met fellow filmmaker James Beveridge who later became a war correspondent in the Royal Canadian Air Force, serving in Europe from 1944–1945. Jane, recently divorced, and with a son, D'Arcy, married James Beveridge after the Second World War but their marriage was short-lived. According to Beveridge's daughter, he recounted that \\"I think Jane couldn't resist a man in an aviator's jacket. They had a brief and disastrous marriage after the war was over.

There is a large population of Japanese expatriates in Indonesia, estimated at 11,263 people . At the same time, there are also identifiable populations of descendants of early migrants, who may be referred to as Nikkei Indonesians or Indonesian Nikkei.; the term \\"Indonesian Nikkei\\" is also used therein to refer to Japanese expatriates who have settled permanently in Japan Migration history Prior to the Tokugawa shogunate's establishment of their isolationist sakoku policy, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) were known to use Japanese mercenaries to enforce their rule in the Maluku Islands. One of Indonesia's early residents of Japanese descent was Saartje Specx, the daughter of Dutch colonial governor Jacques Specx, who ruled Batavia (present-day Jakarta) from 1629 to 1632. 1898 colonial government statistics showed 614 Japanese in the Dutch East Indies (166 men, 448 women). As the Japanese population grew, a Japanese consulate was established in Batavia in 1909, but for the first several years its population statistics were rather haphazard. Their reports showed 782 registered Japanese migrants in Batavia in 1909 (with estimates that there were another 400 unregistered), and 278 (57 men, 221 women) in Medan in 1910. Between ca. 1872 and 1940 large numbers of Japanese prostitutes (karayuki-san) worked in brothels of the archipelago.Yamazaki, Tomoko; Sandakan Bordell Nr. 8; München 2005; Beginning in the late 1920s, Okinawan fishermen began to settle in north Sulawesi. There was a Japanese primary school at Manado, which by 1939 had 18 students. In total, 6,349 Japanese people lived in Indonesia by 1938. After the end of the 1942-1945 Japanese occupation of Indonesia, roughly 3,000 Imperial Japanese Army soldiers chose to remain in Indonesia and fight alongside local people against the Dutch colonists in the Indonesian National Revolution; roughly one-third were killed (among whom many are buried in the Kalibata Heroes Cemetery), while another one-third chose to remain in Indonesia after the fighting ended. In the 1970s, Japanese manufacturers, especially in the electronics sector, began to set up factories in Indonesia; this sparked the migration of a new wave of Japanese expatriates, mainly managers and technical staff connected to large Japanese corporations. In the late 1990s, there was also migration in the opposite direction; many of the Nikkei Indonesians from Sulawesi began migrating to Japan to work in the seafood processing industry. , there were estimated to be about 1,200 of them living in the town of Ōarai, Ibaraki. Furthermore, there was a large outflow of Japanese expatriates in 1998, due to the May riots and the associated political chaos. However, a decade later, the Japanese still made up Jakarta's second-largest expatriate community, after the Koreans. Business and employment The Japanese communities in the Dutch East Indies, like those in the rest of colonial Southeast Asia, remained prostitution-based as late as World War I. The remnant of this prostitution business can be trace in Surabaya's Jalan Kembang Jepun, \\"the Street of the Japanese Flowers\\", located in the city's old Chinatown. Prostitution was outlawed in the Dutch East Indies in 1912, but many Japanese women appear to have continued working in the trade clandestinely. However, by the 1930s, the economic focus of the Japanese community had shifted largely towards agriculture, marine industries, and retailing of imported Japanese products. More recent Japanese expatriates are typically investors connected with electronics manufacturing. Social integration Early Japanese migrants to the Dutch East Indies were classified as \\"foreign orientals\\" by the Dutch government. This status meant they were subject to restrictions on their freedom of movement, place of residence, and employment. However, in 1898, they were reclassified as \\"honorary Europeans\\", giving them formal legal equality with the colonisers and removing those restrictions. Yet despite this formal equality, local peoples' image of the Japanese people in their midst was still not very positive. During the World War II occupation of Indonesia, many Japanese officers took local women as concubines. Children born from such relationships, growing up in the post-war period often found themselves the target bullying due to their ancestry, as well as suffering official discrimination under government policies which gave preference to pribumi in the hiring of civil servants. In Jakarta, Grand Wijaya Center and Blok M have clusters of businesses catering to Japanese expatriates, including restaurants, supermarkets selling imported food products, and the like; Blok M in particular is noted for its concentration of izakaya. Marriage 759 Japanese living in Indonesia have the right of permanent residency; these consist primarily of Japanese women married to Indonesian men. In Bali the number of Japanese residents registered with the Japanese Consulate in Denpasar has increased from 43 in 1987, to 595 in 1995, and further to 1,755 in 2006 and 2,225 in 2010. The consulate receives an annual average of about 100 cases of marriage registration, with over 90 percent of them involving Japanese women who marry local men. It processes between 10 and 12 applications for divorce per year. Some met their husbands in the context of study abroad, either when the husband-to-be was studying in Japan, or when both were studying in an Anglophone country such as the United States or Australia. Others came to Indonesia, especially Bali, as tourists, and met their husbands there. Japan is one of the largest sources of tourists in Bali, and many Japanese women married to Indonesian men are settled there; one scholar who studied the phenomenon in 1994 estimated roughly four hundred resided there at the time. A large number of the tourists consist of young urban women; they see Bali not as an exotic destination, but rather a nostalgic one, evoking the past landscape of Japan and a return to their \\"real selves\\" which they feel are being stifled by life in Japanese cities. Among these, a few come first as tourists, especially to Kuta and Ubud, and then after repeat visits, marry a local man. In some cases, these visits take the form of \\"romance tourism\\" or \\"female sex tourism\\", with women entering into relationships with male sex workers, known colloquially as \\"Kuta Cowboys\\". They use Indonesian and Japanese, or less commonly English when communicating with their husbands, children, and grandchildren, but Indonesian far more commonly than other languages when communicating with other relatives. Media The Daily Jakarta Shimbun is Indonesia's only Japanese language newspaper. It was founded in 1998 by Yasuo Kusano, who was formerly the Mainichi Shimbun bureau chief in Jakarta from 1981 to 1986; he returned to Indonesia after the fall of Suharto, and, finding that many publications banned during the Suharto era were being revived, decided to found a newspaper to provide accurate, in-depth information about Indonesia's new democratisation to Japanese readers. Since then, its circulation has grown from 50 copies to more than 4,000. Portrayals in Indonesian popular culture centred on Japanese characters include Remy Sylado's 1990s novel Kembang Jepun. Set during World War II, it tells a story of a geisha and her Indonesian husband who participates in Supriyadi's anti-Japanese uprising. It was reprinted as a full-length book by Gramedia Pustaka Utama in 2003. Another work with a similar theme is Lang Fang's 2007 novel Perempuan Kembang Jepun, from the same publisher, about a 1940s geisha who becomes the second wife of a Surabaya businessman.

In this episode, a chance encounter with Merlin, David, Hook, and Belle in Camelot gives Merida new hope in her quest to save her triplet brothers from the United clans of DunBroch, as Merida brings Belle along on a dangerous journey that culminates with an invaluable lesson in bravery. In Storybrooke, Regina, Mary Margaret, and David discover the spell that would allow one of Merlin's chosen to communicate with him, but they soon become suspicious of Arthur after he fails to reach the missing sorcerer, and when Emma commands Merida to kill Belle in hopes of forcing Mr. Gold’s heroic transformation, Gold must use his courage to fight for Belle’s life. Plot =Opening sequence= An arrow from Merida is shot in the forest, piercing the glass in the \\"O\\". =Event chronology= The Camelot events take place after \\"Dreamcatcher\\" and before \\"Nimue\\". The DunBroch events take place two years after King Fergus' story in \\"The Bear King\\" and before the events surrounding Merida's coronation in the same episode. The Enchanted Forest events at Granny's Diner take place after \\"Dreamcatcher\\". The Storybrooke events take place after \\"Dreamcatcher\\". =In Camelot / DunBroch= Six weeks earlier in the Camelot dungeon, David, Hook, Merlin and Belle waste no time at all in defeating Arthur's guards, with Hook impressed by Merlin's ability to see the future. They then reach the cell where Lancelot and Merida are being held, with Merlin telling the others that it is enchanted. Belle then gives Merlin a book of spells and makes the bars disappear. Merida tells the rescuers that Arthur took the wisps which she needed to find her brothers, so Merlin suggests that they need to come up with another way to find them. When Belle asks Merida why she was in the dungeon, Merida tells her that the wisps led her to the sea, but the boat she hid out in belonged to Arthur, and that when he found her he then threw her in the cell. Merida then knocks Belle out with a rock and hours later Belle awakes to find herself in a rowboat with Merida. Belle learns that Merida needs Belle's magic to find her brothers. She further explains that the clans kidnapped her brothers so they can force her to relinquish the throne as she is not married. Merida and Belle later stumble upon a witch's home, where they sneak inside to use a cauldron to do a locator spell, which conjures up a futuristic vision of a Southern moor where three men are vying for Merida's hand in marriage, followed by her three brothers brought in by their captors who remove the bags off their heads. Unfortunately, the United Clans also plan to kills Merida's brothers and take DunBroch from Merida. Belle tells Merida its time to change fate, so Belle reads the scroll. As Belle watches Merida practices her archery skills, she's just finished up creating the potion, which will turn Merida into a bear so she can save her brothers. Belle is skeptical about using the spell to change fate, but Merida says otherwise. As they reach the United Clans, Merida threatens to take them out but as she drinks the potion, Belle told her it wasn't the actual potion, then tells Merida that she should have faith in her own fate without magic. When the United Clans' archers aim their arrows at her brothers and fire, Merida showed them who was in charge by aiming and firing her arrow at the executioners' arrows, destroying them, before bluffing her way out of a swordfight with them. The clans then bow down to Merida to acknowledge her as the Queen of DunBroch. With that out of the way, Merida lets Belle return to Camelot to join the others. Finally, back in Camelot, Merlin looks at a candy bar when Emma arrives, and Emma remembers Merlin from their encounter in the real world. Merlin reminds Emma of his warning not to pull Excalibur, in order to protect her loved ones, and continues to stress that because of the darkness now within her, it is imperative for her to heed this warning more than ever before. =In Storybrooke= In the Present Day, Regina informs Mary Margaret that Emma has slipped out information about Merlin, then confirms that she has the Crimson Crown which can be used to summon Merlin, but it has to be the one that was chosen by the sorcerer. When Belle suggests Gold, believing that he is no worse that Emma, everyone else turns a deaf ear saying its a risk they have to take if Gold gets hurt, and a furious Belle storms out. Out in the woods, Gold stares at the chipped tea cup in his hands and says \\"Forgive Me, Belle,\\" then kisses it and breaks the glass in order to take the shards to free himself from the ropes. When Emma arrives to the spot to see if Gold has made any progress, they discovered Gold has escaped. Emma then forces Merida to find him, and threatens the archer by destroying her heart by having Merida kill Belle in order to turn Gold into the hero she needs to release Excalibur. As for Belle, she uses a street map to find out where Emma is keeping Gold, then hears a noise from the elevator, prompting her to take a weapon. She opens it and it's Gold, who warns Belle that Merida's after her by using Gold to turn him into a hero but in order to do that Emma has made Belle a target, and the two race back to the pawn shop to find magic. Around the same time, Regina conjures up a potion with Arthur watching, telling her that David explained everything, then Regina gives Arthur the mushroom. Arthur hesitates and says its best to do it alone, and adds that Merlin only delivered prophecies when he was alone with him. David then tells everyone to step aside so he can be alone, but after Arthur tosses the Crown into the fire instead the cauldron, he tells them the spell did not work. In between the events, Zelena, annoyed with Regina sending healthy food and reading \\"What to Expect When You're Expecting\\" at the hospital, is interrupted by Emma, who then materialized the Wicked Witch to her home for onion rings and take out food, as Zelena asks Emma about why she's important. Emma shows Zelena the Apprentice's wand, as Zelena was the only person to wield it and lived, then offers Zelena freedom and protection in exchange for her assistance, but Zelena tells Emma that she is a bad influence as her darkness is already causing Henry to resent her, and a broken heart can't be forgiven. Claiming to be busy with own family problems, Zelena asks to be sent back to her cell; despite this, Emma tells Zelena that she will take the deal soon. Meanwhile, Belle tells Gold that the coast is clear but before they can make a run for it, Gold tells Belle about his past in the Enchanted Forest during the events of the Ogre Wars and why he sees himself as a coward, but Belle now sees Gold as a hero. When they make it back to the pawn shop, Merida shows up to shoot arrows at Belle, saying that he can't resist the magic. When Merida breaks open the door she walks into a mirror but after she sees their reflection Belle yanks the rug from under her and they escape with a bag containing a potion, then drive to the town line so they can use it, but Belle, worried that Emma will still go after them, demands that she be left out of the car. After she gets out, Belle tells Gold that he still a coward and walks away. Belle then runs into Merida, who then drinks a potion and she turns into a bear and starts chasing Belle, but before she can convince Merida to listen the bear is distracted by Gold, who told Belle to go so he can fight Merida. As the bear sniffs down Gold, he uses an antidote powder to restore Merida back to normal. Despite telling Belle that he didn't know how it worked, Gold told Belle it was her who saved him. The three return to the basement, where Gold agrees to pull Excalibur in exchange for Merida's heart and find out where her brothers are. Gold then pulls Excalibur then places it at Emma's feet, only to have Emma warn Gold that there are heroes around Storybrooke that haven't stopped her, but Gold tells her they're not him. As for the spell, Regina told Mary Margaret that the spell did work, and as suspected by David, Arthur lied to them, believing that he did not want to contact Merlin. Regina believes the only other person who was chosen by Merlin was the Author, meaning Henry, who is brought in to help them, adding that Emma is still inside the darkness and they can save her. Henry then places the mushroom in the cauldron and an image of Merlin appears, informing them that things are worse than he feared. Regina sourly notes they've gotten Merlin's \\"voicemail\\". Merlin says the only way the Dark One can be defeated is by the Nimue, but before he can go any further, Merlin says the Dark One has found him already, and the message is cut short, leading the others to believe that Emma has done something to Merlin. Production Sean Maguire was listed in the credits but was not featured in this episode, while Mckenna Grace was featured in flashback footage but was not credited in the episode. The episode's title was also the original title for the film Brave.Pixar’s ‘Brave’ is Actually ‘The Bear and the Bow’ from Screenrant (May 27, 2009) Reception The episode's numbers remained steady for a fifth week with a 1.5/4 among 18-49s, but slipped a tenth of a point with 4.83 million viewers tuning in, mostly affected by the World Series on Fox and Sunday Night Football on NBC. =Reviews= The episode received positive reviews. Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly notes in her assessment of the review, \\"Bravery was given out in spades tonight on Once Upon a Time, and while Arthur continued to prove he wasn’t the world’s most trustworthy member of the Scooby gang, two of Once’s most underused characters — as well as a relationship that hasn’t been fully explored since last season — got some time to shine.\\"\\"Once Upon a Time recap: The Bear and the Bow\\" from Entertainment Weekly (November 1, 2015) In a review from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, \\"“The Bear and the Bow” is a really compelling episode for Once Upon a Time, and I admit that I wasn't necessarily expecting it to be. However, the separate trajectories towards heroism and self-confidence for both Merida and Gold were genuinely engrossing... The plot (The deception from Arthur) thickens, and it didn't feel like part of the same episode as the rest of the story, considering how singularly focused it is on the Gold/Merida arcs. But it was necessary if next week's episode is going to kick off the search for this mysterious person. So I can't really complain about it. All in all, I thought “The Bear and the Bow” delivered, as Once Upon a Time continues what is gradually becoming one of my favorite first-halves of any season in some time.\\"\\"Once Upon A Time’ Review: Compelling ‘The Bear and the Bow’ Crowns a New Hero\\" from Rickey.org (November 1, 2015) Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club gave the episode positive review, giving it a B-. However, she pointed out that \\"I’m having trouble with Merida’s entry into OUAT season five because I’m just not that invested in the character. Not that she isn’t a plucky little heroine—oh God, she’s plucky!—but because her own backstory and mythology doesn’t offer is a lot. Snow is now a terrible character, but her story was always rich with possibilities: the apple, the mriror, the queen, the hunter, even the dwarves. Everyone knows that story, even if they don’t know they know it. But if you didn’t check out Brave in the theater a few summers ago—which you probably wouldn’t do unless you were a small child or had a small child yourself— you would have no idea where there are bears running around all over the place this episode.\\" Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.3 out of 5 stars.\\"Once Upon a Time Season 5 Episode 6 Review: The Bear and the Bow\\" from TV Fanatic (November 1, 2015) References External links Category:2015 American television episodes Category:Once Upon a Time (season 5) episodes ","title":"The Bear and the Bow"},{"id":"27074255","text":"El Bronco may refer to: *Ramón Álvarez (wrestler), Dominican wrestler *Jaime Rodríguez Calderón, Mexican politician See also * Bronco (disambiguation) ","title":"El Bronco"},{"id":"27074256","text":"The band in performance at WOMEX 19 Mames Babegenush is a Danish Klezmer band formed in 2004 in Copenhagen. Mames Babegenush is the East meeting the North. Strong Scandinavian roots merging with the vibrant dance music of Eastern Europe. From the great ambience of Nordic pine trees to lively weddings in Romania the music of Mames Babegenush gives a sense of both melancholy and ecstatic joy. In the beginning doing quite traditional klezmer music--with inspiration from artists such as Naftule Brandwein, Abe Schwartz and Dave Tarras--but has increasingly developed their own sound. The name means \\"Mom's aubergine salad\\" (baba ghanoush) in Yiddish. History Mames Babegenush was founded in 2004 by a group of friends with an ambition to reform the world music and klezmer scene in Denmark. In the beginning they mainly played at Jewish weddings, bar mitzvahs and other celebrations in Copenhagen. They soon introduced a concept they called klezmer attack, spontaneous, unannounced concerts for unknowing audiences in public spaces, like cafés, parks, bars, or private celebrations. The band increasingly contributed to the world music scene in Denmark, enjoying great underground success within the first two years of the group's existence. The group has since performed all over Denmark, Europe, the US and Argentina, in Copenhagen ex VEGA, Global Cph, Copenhagen Jazzhouse, Stengade 30, Pumpehuset, the Royal Danish Theatre, both Old Stage and the Opera's main stage and TIVOLI, and abroad ex.

The band pushes the perimeter of klezmer to incorporate many cultures, all fragrant with fecund growth and potential. This is joyous music even when it is not” – C. Michael Bailey, AllAboutJazz.com (4.5 of 5) \\"The roaring sextet Mames Babegenush has defined a very organized creative space, in which “Nordic atmospheres” are layered with passion for Eastern European melodies. When listening to the rich and articulated album you hear six musician’s passion, but also their unity and solid competences… The band can build anything on its elements, without hesitating on traditional parts and projecting a flow in new non-dogmatic directions.\\" \\\\- Daniele Cestellini, Blogfoolk \\"This truly is high-end klezmer, which accurately locates the beating heart of the tradition while simultaneously transcending it with inflections from other genres. While the band have one foot firmly in the past, the other is thrust fervently into the future \\" – Tom Nevell, Songlines (5 of 6) Honed across many years of recordings and blistering live shows, the resultant assurance and confidence – in playing and composition – is in full flower... this is the sound of a new Nordic authenticity and milieu.

From 2001 to 2010, of forest were lost in the region. In 2010 Belize had 63% of remaining forest cover, Costa Rica 46%, Panama 45%, Honduras 41%, Guatemala 37%, Nicaragua 29%, and El Salvador 21%. Most of the loss occurred in the moist forest biome, with 12,201 square kilometers. Woody vegetation loss was partially set off by a plus in the coniferous forest biome with 4,730 km2, and at 2,054 km2. Mangroves and deserts contributed only 1% to the loss in forest vegetation. The bulk of the deforestation was located at the Caribbean slopes of Nicaragua with a minus of 8,574 square kilometers of forest lost in the period from 2001 to 2010. The most significant regrowth of 3,050 km2 of forest was seen in the coniferous woody vegetation of Honduras.Daniel J. Redo, H. Ricardo Grau, T. Mitchell Aide, and Matthew L. Clark. Asymmetric forest transition driven by the interaction of socioeconomic development and environmental heterogeneity in Central America in: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. Jun 5, 2012; 109(23): 8839–8844. History The history of most Central American countries involves cycles of deforestation and reforestation. For the Ancient Mayan culture at Copan, Honduras, the process of clearing large amounts of land for their agricultural-based society surpassed the forests' ability to replenish naturally. Besides the clearing of land for farmland, Mayans consumed vast quantities of wood as fuel and building materials, rapidly depleting the natural resources of this area. Eventually, the lack of firewood may have caused health problems among those who were unable to properly cook their food or warm their habitations.Abrams, Elliot M., and David J. Rue. \\"The Causes and Consequences of Deforestation among the Prehistoric Maya.\\" Human Ecology 16, no. 4 (1988): 377-395. By the fifteenth century, intensive Mayan agriculture had significantly thinned the forests, but had not completely decimated them. Before Europeans arrived, forests covered 500,000 square kilometers – approximately 90% of the region. The arrival of the Spaniards caused a sharp decrease in population resulting from the highly contagious diseases introduced by the conquistadores. This reduction in human pressure gave much of the land that had been cleared for cultivation time to recover. Eventually, the forcing of \\"Europe's money economy on Latin America\\" created the demand for the exportation of primary products, which introduced the need for large amounts of cleared agricultural land to produce those products.Myers, Norman, and Richard Tucker. \\"Deforestation in Central America: Spanish Legacy and North American Consumers.\\" Environmental Review: ER 11, no. 1 (1987): 55-71. While the cultivation of some exports such as indigo and cochineal dye worked harmoniously with the surrounding indigenous vegetation, other crops such as sugar required clear-cutting of land and mass quantities of firewood to fuel the refining process, which spurred rapid, destructive deforestation. From the eighteenth to the twentieth century, mahogany exports for furniture became the major cause of forest exhaustion. The region experienced economic change in the nineteenth century through a \\"fuller integration in the world capitalist system\\". This, combined with conflict with Spain, put an even greater emphasis on plantation cropping. Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Europe and North America have become the chief importers of the region's coffee and banana crops, thus putting increasing demand on the land to produce large quantities of these cash crops and perpetuating the clearing of more forest in an attempt to acquire more exploitable farmland. Most recently, as of the 1960s, cattle ranching has become the primary reason for land clearing. The lean grass-fed cattle produced by Central American ranches (as opposed to grain-fed cattle raised elsewhere in America) was perfectly suited for North American fast-food restaurants and this seemingly bottomless market has created the so-called \\"hamburger connection\\" which links \\"consumer lifestyles in North America with deforestation in Central America\\". This demonstrates how the developed world has had an indirect influence on the environment and landscape of developing countries. Logging Logging is another factor that increases deforestation in multiple ways. Though regulated logging is far less detrimental to the forest, uncontrolled logging is prevalent in developing countries due to the demand for timber to house growing populations, and the poor economic situation of those making their living from and in the forest itself. Furthermore, all forms of logging necessitate the building of roads, which generates easy access to those seeking new land to clear for agriculture. The use of wood as the primary fuel for cooking and heating is compounded by developing countries inability to pay high oil prices. As a result, the demand for firewood is \\"one of the most commonly cited causes of deforestation\\".Allen, Julia C., and Douglas F. Barnes. \\"The Causes of Deforestation in Developing Countries.\\" Annals of the Association of American Geographers 75, no. 2 (1985): 163-184. Narco-deforestation The pervasion of the illegal drug trade throughout the region decimates forestland and is primarily fueled by demand for narcotics in North America. Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua have suffered from some of the highest rates of deforestation in the world since 2000 and in 2005 these rates of forest loss began to accelerate, coinciding with an influx of drug trafficking activity. Following the election of Felipe Calderón in 2006 and the ignition of the Mexican Drug War, many Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTO) relocated their operations southward enticed by the porous borders, corruption, and weak public institutions characteristic of Guatemala and Honduras. The sparsely populated forested highlands in these countries harbor little state presence and offer perfect refuge for DTOs looking to evade interdiction. The increased trafficking of cocaine through Guatemala and Honduras is correlated with a rise in the region's rate of forest loss. In the forests of eastern Honduras, the amount of newly detected deforestation is greater than 5.29 hectares while in Guatemala's Petén, extensive amounts of forest loss was matched by an unprecedented number of cocaine flows through the area. According to Dr. Kendra McSweeney from Ohio State University, the baseline rate of deforestation in the region of about 20 km2 per year has accelerated to 60 km2 per year under the narco-effect - a deforestation rate of around 10%. In 2011, the Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve in Honduras was designated as a \\"World Heritage in Danger\\" by UNESCO due to the striking degree of deforestation at the hands of narco-traffickers. Three interrelated mechanisms explain the trend of forest loss following the establishment of a drug transit hub. The first is the clearing of forestland for the construction of clandestine roads and airstrips used by vehicles transporting narcotics, pesticides, and fertilizers. Second, the influx of vast amounts of cash and weapons into areas that are already weakly governed only intensifies the preexisting pressures on forests there. The introduction of narco-capital into these frontiers encourages landowners and other actors in the region to participate in the drug trade, which often leaves indigenous communities bereft of their land and livelihoods. Finally, the large profits to drug traffickers incentivize DTOs to convert forest to agriculture in order to launder these profits. \\"Improving\\" remote land not only allows narco-traffickers to inconspicuously convert their assets into private earnings but also legitimizes the DTO's presence in the area. Though conversion of land within protected forest area and indigenous communities is illegal, traffickers have the political influence necessary to guarantee impunity. As for the indigenous communities marginalized by increased drug trafficking activity, they are powerless in the face of the narcos' violence and corruption; conservation groups in the region are threatened and state prosecutors are bribed to turn a blind eye to illegal \\"narco-zones.\\" According to Dr. Kendra McSweeney from Ohio State University, the baseline rate of deforestation in the region of about 20 km2 per year has accelerated to 60 km2 McSweeney cites Honduras' world's highest homicide rate, explaining that conservationists \\"don't breathe a word of [narco-trafficking], out of fear... they've all been silenced.\\" International environmental groups have pointed to the death of Jairo Mora Sandoval as an example of this sort of silencing of conservationists by narco-traffickers, indicating that the ecological and social effects of the drug trade have been felt throughout Central America. Population growth As the countries of this region continue to develop, the sheer number of people, as well as trade with developed countries, puts pressure on natural resources by creating many of the situations previously discussed, such as the necessary clearing of land for agriculture and housing.Rudel, Tom, and Jill Roper. \\"Regional Patterns and Historical Trends in Tropical Deforestation 1976-1990: A Qualitative Comparative Analysis.\\" Ambio 25, no. 3 (1996): 160-166. Another study shows that population growth and technological development in Central America (the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot) does in fact have a direct impact on the rate of deforestation.Jha, S., and K.S. Bawa. \\"Population Growth, Human Development, and Deforestation in Biodiversity Hotspots.\\" Conservation Biology 20, no. 3 (2006): 906-912 Global impact Similarly to the Amazonian rainforest, the Central American forest also \\"adds to local humidity through transpiration\\".Butler, Rhett. \\"Global Consequences of Deforestation in the Tropics.\\" Rainforests. http://rainforests.mongabay.com/0901.htm (accessed March 28, 2010). Without the extra moisture from transpiration, rainfall totals are significantly decreased. Moreover, with less moisture in the air comes the increased susceptibility to fire. These local ramifications are quite serious and affect the quality of life of the surrounding populations, especially the poor, rural peoples who depend on the land for their livelihoods. In addition to the strain on the local environment, the destruction of the rainforests has \\"a broader impact, affecting global climate and biodiversity\\". Efforts to reverse the effects Many countries have undertaken plans to conserve and replenish the forest in response to the recent upsurge in deforestation. For example, in Nicaragua, forest management consists of shifting from timber to non-timber harvesting alongside sustainable logging methods.Salick, Jan, Alejandro Mejia, and Todd Anderson. \\"Non-Timber Forest Products Integrated with Natural Forest Management, Rio San Juan, Nicaragua.\\" Ecological Applications 5, no. 4 (1995): 878-895. In Costa Rica, logging roads that had once added to the problem of deforestation are being researched as potential avenues of reforestation. Furthermore, in the mid-1990s, \\"damage-controlled logging practices\\" were implemented to prevent rampant illegal logging.Gariguata, Manuel R., and Juan M. Dupuy. \\"Forest Regeneration in Abandoned Logging Roads in Lowland Costa Rica.\\" Biotropica 29, no. 1 (1997): 15-28.

The property is located along the North Branch of the Chicago River at 618 W. Chicago Avenue in Near North Side, Chicago, Illinois. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and as a National Historic Landmark on June 2, 1978. History The two earliest buildings in the complex, the old Administration Building and the Mail Order House, are constructed of reinforced concrete and were designed by Richard E. SchmidtCondit, Carl W., ‘’The Chicago School of Architecture: A History of Commercial and Public Building in the Chicago Area 1875-1925\\", The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1964, c. 1952 p. 186-187 and Hugh Garden, members of the architectural firm of Schmidt, Garden and Martin. The , eight-story Administration Building served as the company's headquarters until 1974, and features sword and torch motifs on the base and vertical piers that rise uninterrupted, culminating in a parapet with motifs similar to the base. A four-story tower was added in 1929 on the northeast corner of the building, with a pyramid roof. The Spirit of Progress Crowning the roof of the Administration Building is a replica of the bronze statue that was originally placed on top of the old Montgomery Ward Building on Michigan Avenue. An adaption of an earlier statue that had topped both Madison Square Garden in New York and the Agriculture Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago was made for the building by the same creators, W. H. Mullins Manufacturing Company of Salem, Ohio and was sculpted by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. The statue is called The Spirit of Progress, and depicts the goddess Diana, dressed in flowing robes, balancing on a globe, and holding a torch in her right hand and a caduceus in her left hand.\\"The Spirit of Progress Story\\", Chicagology. Retrieved July 15, 2016. Forty feet north of the Administration Building is the Mail Order House, also known as the Catalog House, that was the heart of Montgomery Ward's operations. Completed in 1908, the eight-story building was painted white and capped with a flat roof, with an interior that contained miles of chutes, conveyors, and storage lofts within ceiling heights ranging from 12 to . The west facade, following a bend in the river, is almost long and a single floor covers . At one time the building had its own post office branch and a ground-floor shipping platform that could accommodate 24 railroad freight cars. The Catalog House was designated a Chicago Landmark on May 17, 2000. In later years, Montgomery Ward and Company added several warehouses and parking structures, followed by a 26-story office building in 1972, designed by architect Minoru Yamasaki, who also designed the former World Trade Center towers in New York City. Currently After the bankruptcy of Montgomery Ward in 2001, the earliest buildings were converted into upscale condominiums. The project met the Secretary of the Interior's Standards with the exception of the balconies. In 2004, the office tower also was converted to condominiums, now called The Montgomery. The Mail Order House building is now home to restaurants, the Big Ten Network, Wrigley, Echo Global Logistics, David Barton Gym, Allyu Spa, Groupon, Kingsbury Yacht Club boat slips, InnerWorkings, Uptake, Dyson Inc., and 298 luxury condominiums. Bankers Life & Casualty's Chicago offices were also located here for several years, until Groupon's expansion led Bankers to move in late 2011.

Life and career Robert Wiebking was born in Schwelm, Germany in 1870, he emigrated to Chicago in 1881 where his father worked as an engraver for many companies, including the Marder, Luse, & Co. type foundry. In 1884, Wiebking began working for C. H. Hanson, an engraving company. By 1893 he was in business for himself, cutting type matrices for both the Crescent and Independent Type Foundries. In 1900, with H. H. Hardinge, he formed ‘‘Wiebking, Hardinge & Company’’ which ran the Advance Type Foundry. In 1914 the partnership was dissolved and Advance merged with the Western Type Foundry. After Western Foundry merged into Barnhart Brothers & Spindler, Wiebking began working once again for himself. He then designed type and cut matrices for many foundries and, from 1911 to 1926 (with a few exceptions) he cut all of the matrices for Frederic Goudy's designs were cut by Wiebking.

Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 13 November 2006. * . By Gilbert Burnham, Riyadh Lafta, Shannon Doocy, and Les Roberts. The Lancet, October 11, 2006 * Baghdad from GlobalSecurity.org The Iraq War started with a US-led invasion on 20 March 2003, causing much damage to the capital city, Baghdad. The war and collateral damage continued for years. In October 2003, a joint United Nations/World Bank team conducted an assessment of funding needs for reconstruction in Iraq during the period 2004-2007. A study conducted by the Iraqi Central Bureau of Statistics in cooperation with the United Nations, based on surveys conducted in 2004, reported that a third of Iraqis were living in poverty, in spite of the rich natural resources of the country. Al-Askari Mosque '''''''''' The Mosque in 2006 after the first bombing The Al-Askari Mosque was bombed twice, over two years. On February 22, 2006, at 6:55 a.m. local time (0355 UTC) explosions occurred at the mosque, effectively destroying its golden dome and severely damaging the mosque. Several men belonging to Iraqi Sunni insurgent groups affiliated with Al- Qaida, one wearing a military uniform, had earlier entered the mosque, tied up the guards there and set explosives, resulting in the blast. Two bombs were set off by five to seven men dressed as personnel of the Iraqi Special forces who entered the shrine during the morning. At around 8 a.m. on 13 June 2007, operatives belonging to al-Qaeda destroyed the two remaining -high golden minarets flanking the dome's ruins. No fatalities were reported. Iraqi police have reported hearing \\"two nearly simultaneous explosions coming from inside the mosque compound at around 8 a.m.\\" A report from state run Iraqiya Television stated that \\"local officials said that two mortar rounds were fired at the two minarets.\\" As of April 2009, the golden dome and the minarets have been restored and the shrine reopened to visitors.Bombed Iraq shrine reopens to visitors Electricity During the Gulf War of 1991 aerial bombardment caused severe damage to the electric grid that operated the pumping stations and other facilities for potable water delivery and sewage treatment. The sanctions imposed by the UN at the conclusion of the Gulf War exacerbated these problems by banning the importation of spare parts for equipment and chemicals, such as chlorine, needed for disinfection. The invasion of Iraq produced further degradation of Iraq's water supply, sewerage and electrical supply systems. Treatment plants, pumping stations and generating stations were stripped of their equipment, supplies and electrical wiring by looters. The once-capable cadre of engineers and operating technicians were scattered or left the country. Reconstruction efforts faced a nation with a severely degraded infrastructure. In the hot summer of 2004, electricity was only available intermittently in most areas of the city. According to a member of Paul Bremer's staff, the problems with electricity were exacerbated by a surge in the use of air conditioners. Baghdad continues to suffer regular rolling power outages. Baghdad Zoo Within eight days following the 2003 invasion, only 35 of the 700 animals in the Baghdad Zoo survived. This was a result of theft of some animals for human food, and starvation of caged animals that had no food or water. Survivors included larger animals like lions, tigers, and bears. Notwithstanding the chaos brought by the invasion, South African Lawrence Anthony and some of the zoo keepers cared for the animals and fed the carnivores with donkeys they had bought locally. Transportation Traffic problems in Baghdad have increased significantly since the 2003 invasion, credited to the formation of the Green Zone blocking roads, and new laws about automobile ownership. The Baghdad Metro completely stopped service until October 2008. =Bridges= Al-Sarafiya bridge Three of Baghdad's 13 bridges over the Tigris river have been targeted by large explosions. The Al-Sarafiya bridge was destroyed when an abandoned truck bomb exploded on April 12, 2007. At least 10 people were killed and 26 injured, though there were reports of 20 more trapped in cars that had gone off the bridge. Sanitation Haifa street, as seen from the Medical City Hospital across the Tigris River Before the invasion there were 1200 working waste collection trucks. Most of the vehicles were destroyed or lost in the looting that seized the capital after the American invasion. The deputy mayor of Baghdad estimates the city needs 1,500 waste collection vehicles. Buses bombed during the 17 August 2005 Baghdad bombings National Museum of Iraq At the National Museum of Iraq, which had been a virtual repository of treasures from the ancient Mesopotamian cultures as well as early Islamic culture, many of the 170,000 irreplaceable artifacts were either stolen or broken (partially found safe and well later). On April 14, The Iraq National Library and National Archives were burned down, destroying thousands of manuscripts from civilizations dating back as far as 7,000 years.Eskander, Saad. \\"The Tale of Iraq's 'Cemetery of Books' \\" (cover story), in: Information Today; Dec 2004, Vol. 21, issue 11, p. 1-54; 5 pl, 1 color Looting As the American forces secured control of the capital, Iraqi civilians immediately began looting the palaces, as well as government offices. At the important Yarmuk Hospital, not only all beds, but absolutely all its medical equipment, both large and small, was stolen. One other hospital managed to keep on functioning in a manner by organizing local civilians as armed guards. Serious looting was described at National Museum of Iraq, the Iraqi Museum of Modern Art, the University of Baghdad, three five- star hotels: the Al Rasheed Hotel, the Al-Mansour and Babel Hotel, state-owned supermarkets, many embassies, and state-owned factories. Some 8,500 paintings and sculptures were looted.Sabrah,S.A. and Ali, M.,\\" Iraqi Artwork Red List: A Partial List of the Artworks Missing from the National Museum of Modern Art, Baghdad, Iraq, 2010, pp 4-5; Schmidt, M.S., \\"Mohammed Ghani Hikmat, Iraqi Sculptor, Dies at 82,\\" [Obituary], New York Times, 21 September 2011, Online:https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/arts/design/mohammed-ghani-hikmat- iraqi-sculptor-dies-at-82.html By 2010, only 1,500 of the most important works had been returned.King, E.A. and Levin, G., Ethics and the Visual Arts, Skyhorse Publishing, 2010, p. 109 In addition to looting, a number of public monuments were also destroyed. Two important public sculptures were dismantled in the aftermath of the US invasion of 2003; one was the statue of Abu Jafar al-Mansur, the 8th-century Abbasid Caliph and founder of Baghdad and the other was the fountain known Nasb al-Maseera (or the March of the Ba'ath) formerly in Mathaf Square, both dismantled in October, 2005.Shabout, N., \\"The 'Free' Art of Occupation: Images for a 'New' Iraq,\\" Arab Studies Quarterly, Vol. 28, No. 3/4, 2006, pp. 41-53; \\"Mosque blast blow to Iraq treasures,\\" Aljazeera, Online: The art historian, Nada Shabout, notes that the destruction of Iraqi art in the period after 2003, assumed both tangible and intangible forms. Not only were the artworks and art institutions looted or destroyed, but art production also suffered from the lack of availability of art materials and the loss of many intellectuals, including artists, who were forced into exile. The Ministry of Culture has estimated that more than 80 percent of all Iraqi artists are now living in exile.Art AsiaPacific Almanac, Volume 4, Art AsiaPacific, 2009, p. 75 This contributed to an environment that failed to nurture artists, and saw young, upcoming artists operating in a void.Shabout, N., \\"Ghosts of Futures Past: Iraqi Culture in a State of Suspension,\\" in Denise Robinson, Through the Roadbloacks: Realities in Raw Motion, [Conference Reader], School of Fine Arts, Cyprus University, 23–25 November, pp 94-95 Curfew A nighttime curfew was imposed on the city immediately after the invasion.
